Glad you are all enjoying this recipe.  Just wanted to mention a few things in response to some reviews.  First, I mix all ingredients in the pan I melt the butter in. Less dishes. Second, I often use whole wheat flour to cut sweetness and make it a tad more healthy.  Third, it freezes fabulously.  I always make a double batch, remove one from the pan after cooling, wrap it up and pop it in the freezer.  Thanks for all the rave reviews!

3/20  Based on some reviews I've read, I want to clarify something.  I use a regular pot to melt my butter in.  After the butter has melted I proceed with adding the rest of the ingredients in that same pot.  I do NOT get a separate bowl for mixing in.  After all the ingredients are mixed in the pot I pour the batter into a baking pan.  I do NOT mix everything in the pan I'm baking it in.  I do NOT keep the butter and sugar mixture out when mixing the rest of the ingredients.  Hope that helps. 

7/24/10  I'd change the recipe if I could, but I can't figure out how, so I'll mention here that the normal baking time is 30 minutes.  I put 30-40 minutes in the directions because it takes longer when you use whole wheat flour, which I often do.  I'm guessing those who complain about it being dry are just seeing the "cook time - 40 minutes" at the top and overbaking it.

3/16/11  I never claimed this was a Southern recipe & couldn't figure out why some reviews pointed out that it wasn't. Evidently Allrecipes put it in that category.  Sorry!

Very good recipe though I tweaked it a bit.  I reduced the sugar a little, but think it would be fine for the full amount if you like your cornbread a little sweet.  I used powdered buttermilk and water and added 2/3 c. fresh yellow corn.  In my opinion, the ONLY way to cook cornbread is in a preheated cast iron skillet.  It gives it such a wonderful buttery, crisp crust.  I greased my 9 in. skillet with vegetable oil and put it in the oven while I assembled the recipe. When the batter was finished, I poured it into the hot skillet.  I then baked it for 25 minutes.  The result was top notch.  Very moist with perfect texture.

Awesome 5++ stars. To the readers who had dry bread.... 1/4 lb not 1/4 cup butter!!! This might have made a difference if you read it wrong, 1/4 lb is 1/2 cup of butter. Also I put it in my greased preheated iron skillet for 25 min, excellent!!

I made twelve, gorgeous muffins with this recipe and they were not sweet, not dry, and certainly not "cake-like."  I don't like too sweet ANYTHING and even tho' I was tempted to reduce the sugar after reading some of the reviews, sheer curiosity led me to prepare the entire recipe, including the amount of sugar, as is.  Normally I find that I want honey, butter (or both!) on my cornbread, but not this time.  These muffins were buttery, moist, just slightly sweet, hearty and surprisingly flavorful.  They baked up nicely with perfectly risen tops at 375 degrees for about 22 minutes. I swear, once again it's the buttermilk - and the butter, of course!

The recipe is fantastic as written, but after making this recipe a few times I made a few changes.  I used Splenda instead of sugar, whole-wheat flour instead of all-purpose, Smart Balance Light instead of butter, and sour skim milk instead of buttermilk.  Sounds like a lot of substitutions, but the end result was absolutely delicious, and nearly guilt free!  This is the ONLY cornbread recipe that I use, and it comes out wonderful every time.

Really good and easy. Tip: if you don't have buttermilk, decrease the milk by 2 tablespoons, and replace with 2 tablespoons lemon juice. It was a little on the sweet side, I will decrease the sugar a bit next time, as I am trying to decrease the sugar in my familys diet. It held together nicely when sliced, a bonus with messy youngsters :)

If you are a southerner and like the non-sweet, buttery-tasting southern style corn bread, this is not for you. But if you like the sweeter, more cakelike cornbread served in New England and other areas, you'll adore this recipe. Try it for breakfast with butter and maple syrup!

No true Southerner puts sugar in the cornbread.  The secret of Southern cornbread is to heat the fat in a skillet and pour the batter into the hot skillet.

Fabulous! Great flavor and just the right amount of sweet.  (I like it sweet!) Like Jiffy mix except it holds together GREAT, and no bitter chemical aftertaste.  Just loved this.  Also, it was so easy to make, not much more work than a mix anyway!  I followed Bethany's advice and mixed it in the pan I baked it in, but it was so hard to be careful to not slop everything out while stirring together to me it is definitely worth one more dish to mix together in a bowl next time! Thanks for a great recipe!  I won't be buying those chemically mixes any more! :)

(I used 1 c milk and took out 1 TB and added 1 TB apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk, let sit 5 mins, worked great.)

My search for the perfect cornbread on this site is over!  I've tried Favorite Cornbread, Homesteader Cornbread, and Sweet Cornbread and while all are good, this one is the best.  It's got a sweet, cake-like consistency and is very moist. I wouldn't change a thing! I baked it at 350 for 40 minutes until just browned on top.  It's perfect with chili or fried chicken!

First off, read, don't assume.  No where is this claimed to be Southern style cornbread!.  Second, kindly don't rate any recipe that you haven't made exactly as written.  When you make your "changes", you have created an altogether different version so how could you possibly know how it would have tasted.  I have made this bread several times and absolutely love it.  I now bake it in my trusty iron frying pan but follow the recipe exactly as written.  I have made batches for both my 9" and 15" pans.  Mmmmm, cornbread to die for.  I used to have a terrible time getting the center done.  Since switching to an iron frying pan, the bread finishes on time and comes out perfect.  Cut and serve with a pie server.

This is a delicious cornbread recipe but for those of you that never buy buttermilk because NO one drinks it and you do not cook enough to use it up, substituting a cup of whole milk with two tablespoons of cider vinegar gives you the same delicious results.  With two college aged children in my home though, milk is difficult to keep around as well so I keep several cans of evaporated milk around for cooking.  1/2 cup of evaporated milk, two tablespoons of cider vinegar and enough water to make a full cup will make a terrific buttermilk consistency and substitute.  If your recipe calls for whole milk then mix 2/3 cup of water to 1/3 cup of evaporated milk to make a cup of whole milk.

Absolutely delicious ! Easy to make and incredibly yummy ! 
I reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup, and added a small can of green giant mexicorn and a small can of diced jalapenos. 
Ended up baking in a 9" x 9" pan, and only for 25 minutes on the middle rack of the oven. It came out perfect. I am so pleased !
Tasty, just sweet enough, moist, and a keeper !

Delicious!  Couldn't be any easier!  It has that sweet, cornbread taste I was craving!

3/3/08-made again, this time used a cast-iron skillet.  It gave it a delicious crust!  Yum! Only needed to be baked for 30 minutes.

This was very moist with just the right amount of sweetness. My non-cornbread eating hubby loved it, and that's enough to give it 5 stars right there! As soon as it came out of the oven, I rubbed approx. 2TBSP of butter over the top. Yummy!

Quick tip:  I heated the butter in the microwave (45 seconds) and put it in a gallon size Ziploc bag.  I then added all the ingredients as instructed on the recipe.  (Only exception is that I beat the eggs in a separate bowl first.)  After all ingredients were mixed in the bag, I cut the corner off, which made it easy to squeeze the mixture into muffin tins.  This made 17 muffins that cooked in 13 minutes!

To "Kay" the "True Southerner".  I was born and raised in Mississippi and my mother ALWAYS put sugar in her cornbread, as do I.  And I don't see anywhere on this recipe that says it's a southern recipe in the first place. Who cares if it's baked in a skillet or not. Sheesh.  If you don't want sugar in it, then don't put any in there.  This is a very delicious recipe and I'm happy to have tried it, and am adding it to my book.  From a "True Southerner".

stop searching! I don't review often although I cook/bake almost daily from talents of other posters, and will make it several times to make sure I am consistant, to be fair. This is the exception! I made this yesterday on a whim and at the last possible minute, I wanted to make it in the cast iron skillet and only have a 11 3/4 inch so I dared to make a recipe and a half but used 3 eggs (wasnt sure how to half the egg lol) melted the recipes butter in the skillet, leaving the skillet on low and then poured it in the bowl waiting with sugar, whisked in the eggs and buttermilk substitute (1 cup milk- 1TB vinegar), soda, then added dry ingredients and really just moistened them, poured the batter back into waiting skillet, so fast and easy the butter didn't scorch, it made a satisfying sizzle sound going in and put it in the oven at 375 but for only 35 min even with the larger pan, then I got nervous, with unexpected company waiting to eat, knowing i had not taken any time with the poor bread. God bless my harshest critic ( a conniseur 14 yr old son, who is pretty embarrased by anything I do) who came out to the kitchen to take a preview bite,  and his eyes gave him away- HE LOVED IT. really? really mom? That is the best EVER! I was asked by another teen if they could take some home, and had their mom call me saying dont send stuff home, her husband and kids wanted her to make it tonite. It was That good!! Grandmother you leave a legacy! ps I made a second pan, just as good!

This is simply and honestly the best cornbread I have made.  Usually I just follow the recipe on the cornmeal container, but I decided to look up a recipe this time because I had some buttermilk in the fridge that needed used.  Because I was raised on (and prefer) non-sweet cornbread, I just omitted the white sugar all together.  I can't rave enough about how good this is.  Usually I slather butter on my cornbread, but this is so flavorful and moist that I was able to eat it as is.  Wonderful!

Allow me to be #1,322 in the line of reviews. :) I have always had utter failures with EVERY single cornbread recipe that I've ever made from scratch. That's why I used Jiffy Mix for the past 30+ years. For unknown reasons, I decided to try making cornbread One.More.Time. Well, actually, 5 more times! LOL I visited various cooking websites, copied their recipes that were very highly reviewed, made them without changes, took one bite, and promptly tossed the entire pan out! The day after Thanksgiving, I made 4 different cornbreads from scratch and one was worse than the other: bitter, NO corn taste, crumbly, burnt, etc. Why I didn't give up and go back to Jiffy Mix, I don't know why. But, I did a general websearch this time and THIS recipe was at the top of the search. I read 40 reviews, including the original poster.s I made it EXACTLY per instructions, and came out with the most perfect, flawless, tasty cornbread I've had in my life!!!!! THIS recipe is what ALL other cornbreads wish they could be! Grandmother's are always the BEST cooks and this recipe will not only be my ONLY one I use, but I'm emailing it to all my other friends, so they can also make it from scratch and not rely on JiffyMix. God Bless your Grandmother and YOU for sharing this 5 star recipe with the rest of the world!

I'm so excited about this recipe. My grandmother used to make cornbread from scratch and I loved it, but hadn't had any since she passed.  This one came out perfect, my mom even loved it.  It is a little on the sweet side, so if you don't like sweets, I'd suggest cutting back on the sugar.  Also, the second time I made it I used 1 1/4 cup corn meal and 3/4 cup of flour to make the batter less cake-like.

I just tried this recipe last nght and I LOVE it!!!  Being a Southerner, I've grown up on the more dense, less sweet versions of cornbread.  I've tried other recipes similar to this one, but this one has them all beat!  I love the really moist, cake-like consistency of this cornbread - and the sweetness was great, but you can always adjust that down to your liking if it is too sweet.  This is the ONLY cornbread recipe I'm going to use from now on.  (I still have some left over from last night's beef stew.  I'm going to go home and have a piece for lunch - then I'll make a new batch tonight after we finish off the rest with the remainder of our beef stew!!!)  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

This review hails from someone who does not like cornbread --  or, didn't (shout-out to Famous Dave's for preventing me from making this delicious recipe for years). I made 12 muffins, following the recipe exactly, with the exception of using whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. They baked to a perfect light golden brown at 22 minutes, and wow, were they incredibly tasty. 

They were so delicious that my husband convinced me to make a second batch so he could bring some to work. He even volunteered to go to the grocery store for more ingredients (it is that easy??). 

For the second batch, I decided to make them sweeter by using 1 cup sugar, 3/4 cup butter, and a splash more buttermilk. What can I say, they were even more phenomenal. Sweet (but not overly so), moist, and melt-in-your-mouth good. Some reviews have commented on cutting out a portion of the sugar, but I do like things sweeter and thought the additions enhanced the flavor. And, I think we should all agree that they are fat-free if you eat them while doing lunges.

Oh my gosh- terrific taste and perfect texture!  Made it all in one pan. I didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I found a buttermilk substitute on the internet... mix 1 Tablespoon white vinegar OR lemon juice with one cup of milk - let sit 5 minutes.  My family LOVED it!

Delicious!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9"x13" pan.  It was done after about 40 minutes.  I served it to go with chili for a Superbowl party.  I really liked the texture--moist, not gritty.  It was a hit with adults and kids.  Some reviewers think it's too sweet, but I think the sweetness is just about right the way it is.  It also keeps well.  I will be making this again and again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm loving this recipe! I've made it several times over the past 2 months and finally settled on my version based on several reviews I read. Instead of one cup each of flour/cornmeal, I use 3/4 cup four & 1 1/4 corn meal; today I tried 1 cup sour cream instead of either milk or soured milk (or milk with vinegar which I also tried) and the sour cream version has been the most moist! (still have to try the buttermilk). With regards to the suger, 2/3 was way too sweet for me while hubby loved it exactly as is. I tried it with 1/3 and thought it could use more. Today I used 1/2 cup and it is perfectly sweet. I melt the butter in my 7" cast iron pan and then add that to another bowl with the remaining ingredients, that way my pan is nice and buttered/nonstick; then my pan goes in the oven and I turn it on to preheat and heat the pan. Once everything is mixed, I let it sit on the counter for 15 minutes or so while the oven preheats so the cornmeal can absorb all the moisture and flavors (per Paula Deen :) The batter goes into the HOT pan and into the oven...nice crisp outside and moist inside! Thanks for the recipe. Its a keeper :)

tasty and easy recipe. i had to use sour milk in place of buttermilk, which worked fine. since i usually put honey in my cornbread, i was tempted, but very glad i did not adjust the sweetness. it was just right as is. i melted the butter in glass bowl in the microwave and mixed the rest in as directed. baked up in about 30 minutes. very good with chili!

I followed the recipe as directed, except I didn't have any buttermilk (so I used 1 cup milk + 2 T. Vinegar instead).  I made muffins and baked for 15-18 minutes. They turned out great... This recipe is a keeper!

The best cornbread I have ever had, bar none. I added 1/2 tsp baking powder to further lighten up the texture. Made it with an equal measure of Splenda in place of the sugar. Added a Tb of honey, as well. Lightly sweet this way. I found 27 minutes in the oven to be perfect, yielding a light, moist texture. Perfect served piping hot with loads of butter. Pieces can be split and warmed in the toaster later on.

This is an awesome corn bread recipe.  Made even better when baked in a cast iron skillet.  The secret is to preheat the skillet in the oven with either lard or vegetable oil and then pour the batter into the hot pan and bake for 25-35 min depending on size of skillet.  Turned out phenomenally.

5 stars for such an easy quick fix recipe - 4 stars for flavor.

Based on many reviews I decreased the sugar to a very generous 1/2 cup and this was the perfect amount of sugar (not too sweet).  I used a 9-inch cast iron skillet (greased with vegetable oil) and baked the cornbread for 30 minutes.  Cornbread was beautifully golden, moist, and flavorful.  NOTE:  If you overbake the cornbread then it will undoubtedly dry out. Cooking time will vary greatly depending on the size of your pan and your oven's temp accuracy.  Recipe calls for an 8-in pan for 40 mins.  I used a 9-in cast iron pan for 30 mins.  Others have mentioned baking for only 25 mins... the key is not to overbake!

I would give this an easy 4-1/2 stars!  This is really easy to put together and has a wonderful flavor.  I made exactly as the recipe stated and wouldn't change a thing.  I cooked in a cast iron skillet and it took about 25 minutes. Perfectly moist and delicious.

This was very very good cornbread.  My husband and kids loved it!  However, I am born and bred from a long line of southern hillbillies, and this is NOT southern cornbread.  Much sweeter, and more like a dessert.  To me, this cornbread is good if you want it with jelly, honey, or sorghum, etc., but if you want a good beans n' chili cornbread, go for a southern version with more cornmeal and less sugar.  Anyways, this was a huge hit with the family, so I will definitely make it again! :)

This is very delicious, just as written. I did tweak it the second time by adding less sugar and it was perfect for us! But may I say to folks who come and slam the fact that this has sugar in it, please, if you don't like sugar in your cornbread, then simply leave it out of this recipe or move on to a different recipe. Why leave negative comments simply because this recipe is written with ingredients you find out of place?

This is my new favorite cornbread recipe. I omitted about 3 TBSP of the sugar to reduce the amount of refined carbohydrates & used the vinegar/milk trick (stir in about 3 TBSP distilled vinegar into 1C minus 3 TBSP milk & let it sit 5 minutes) since I didn't have buttermilk. Since altitudes and ovens are different for everyone, baking times and temperatures usually vary too, so I just kept an eye on it. I usually have the problem of burned outer edges and a raw inside, but I divided the batter into two 8X5" bread pans and lowered the temperature a bit and it came out beautifully browned and moist, even the next day. It made 8 large slices for me.

I didn't make cornbread with the batter. Instead, I made corn muffins. I didn't have any buttermilk, so I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in a 1-cup measuring cup, then filled to the 1-cup mark with half-and-half cream, and let sit while I finished mixing the batter. I mixed the baking soda in with the cornflour, flour, and salt, rather than adding it in buttermilk. I melted the butter in a small saucepan, and after I stirred in the sugar, I added it to a large mixing bowl, which I already had the 2 eggs in it. I stirred well to mix, then added the lemon infused half-and-half cream; stirred well to mix, then thoroughly stirred in the cornflour mixture. I poured the batter into 14 paper lined muffin tins three-quarters full, and baked them in a 350 degree oven for 20 minutes. I let the muffins sit too completely cool, as the paper liners may stick a bit to the cornbread, and remove some of the cornbread. I just placed unwrapped cooled muffins in the microwave to heat them up a bit.... 4-19-2011 ... This morning I heated the muffins in the microwave for breakfast, and topped them with a No-Cooked Strawberry Freezer Jam, and boy did they taste good!!

Fantastic cornbread--best I've ever had! The one-pan prep is also great. I served these at a chili cookoff and people ate it all up. You can really taste the buttermilk, which helped to cut some of the hotter chilis.

I am from Tennessee and we don't use sugar in our skillet cornbread.  This was good but sweet like a after dinner bread, not a eat with your beans and turnip greens kinda of cornbread.  But I guess each to their own.

This is the best tasting cornbread I have ever made.  I'm sure it has a lot to do with the fact that it has an entire stick of butter and 2/3 cup sugar but what the heck, I don't make it that often so might as well splurge!  Be sure to sort reviews by most helpful and follow the submitter's instructions for the prep.  Mine was done in under 30 minutes so watch closely at the end of cooking time.  So good!

While I made some huge changes to this recipe, they were almost all dietary substitutions, and not to type of ingredient or the proportions, so I absolutely had to give this 5 stars.  When possible, I avoid eating corn, but I was making a new chili and couldn't resist.  And while I didn't have very high hopes for this after all the substitutions, the results were still so incredibly moist and so unbelievably, jaw-droppingly good, that my husband I both agreed that this may be my baking triumph of the year.  WOW.  So, if you need an ultra-light, dairy-free recipe, here's what I did: I used 1/2 cup Smart Balance Light in place of the butter; 1/3 cup + 1 tbs. granulated sugar plus 4 packets of Stevia; 2 eggs; 1 cup unsweetened hemp milk + 1 tbs. lemon juice in place of the buttermilk; 1/2 tsp. baking soda; 1 cup Quaker cornmeal; 1 cup white spelt flour; 1/2 tsp. salt; and per another reviewer, a dash of cinnamon and chili powder.  I prepared and baked it precisely as directed by the author (Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bethany!!!), and it was utterly fantastic.  Plus, I cut it into 8ths instead of 9ths, and each generous portion has only 187 calories.  If cut into 9ths, each slice has only 166 calories.  I'm already planning to make another batch next week and can't wait.  YUM!

This recipe is excellent!  I prepared this in a cast iron skillet (Baked for 25 minutes after preheating skillet in oven while I did everything else.)  I just melted the butter in a microwave bowl and mixed everything in there before I poured it in the skillet.  Also, I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup as my husband is not a fan of sweet tastes and he said I could even cut it a little more.

Excellent!  Better than any recipe either I or any of my friends have
tried.  Nice and moist.  Sweet but not overly so.  Structurally stable --
i.e., it doesn't fall apart as you eat it.  And oh so easy -- I only
needed one pan since I melted the butter in a cast-iron skillet, mixed
everything into it, and stuck it right in the oven.  Warning: I
checked it after 24 minutes and it was already done, way before the 30-40
claimed by the recipe.

Excellent, very moist and tasty. I'd cut the sugar down to 1/2 c next time, it was a little too sweet. Great with spicy chili.

Really good... substituted the buttermilk with lemon and milk. Made them into muffins. These freeze well too, we made extras and popped the rest into a freezer bag. Whenever we need them for dinner, I pull them out, wrap them in a paper towel and microwave them for a minute.

I've made this a few times and it's come out slightly different depending upon how well the soda is mixed into the buttermilk.  The first time, the soda got stuck to the measuring cup and the result was a thick batter and moist cornbread.  The last time, I completely mixed the soda in buttermilk and the batter was far more airy or spongy.  The result was a slightly dryer cornbread.  Both were equally good - just different in terms of texture.

I thought this cornbread was really good.  Yes, it's sweet and yes I am from the south miss lady. So to say that no true southerner would put sugar in it is just silly.  And yes, it's sweet, it says in the title it's sweet.  Y'all need to stop being so negative.  If you didn't want sweet cornbread, why make a recipe that clearly stated it was sweet?  You can plainly see how much sugar is in it.  And I don't think any person should speak for a whole region of the country.

I did not have any cornmeal on hand so I tried corn flour. It was amazing. Buttery, smooth, melt-in-your-mouth.
Thank you for sharing this.

This is a sweeter, richer version of cornbread like kettle corn is a sweeter, richer version of popcorn.  I will still make my regular, less sweet cornbread most of the time, but this is a great alternative when I need something richer.

I have been cooking for 50+ years and this is the best cornbread I have ever made!!! I use this recipe often.  Since I am only cooking for two, I usually divide the recipe between 12 regular muffin cups.  I bake them about 15-20 min.  When cool, I put them in a freezer bag and freeze.  When I need cornbread, I just pop a couple in the micro for a minute or so.  My husband likes the outside toasty, I like a soft moist center, so this works perfect for us. Whether you use the 8" square pan or muffin cups, this is the perfect recipe.

5.5.05 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/76594/grandmothers-buttermilk-cornbread/ ... With adding a cup of creamstyle corn, I may reduce the sugar to a third cup instead of half.  It wasn't too much; but since my cornbread eater (8yrs) will eat the whole thing himself, less would be better, sugar consumption-wise.  Also, with adding the moisture from the corn, I doubt a cup of flour would be too much.  It was very moist, very good, very addicting.  This is our favorite buttermilk cornbread recipe.

This is THE BEST cornbread I have ever tasted! Bar none! And it is so easy to make, and takes so little time to whip up, there's really no excuse for using boxed cornbread mix anymore, with all of the preservatives and fake ingredients that go along with pre-packaged food. This cornbread is moist and dense enough so that it cuts very nicely, with minimum crumbling. I hate it when you try to cut cornbread into nice squares, and it just falls apart in your hands when you try to butter it and eat it. Yuck. That doesn't happen with this recipe. I found that the taste combination was just right - not too sweet, not too corn-mealy. The only thing that I adjusted at all was the flour - I like using 1/2 cup all-purpose flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. I think it gives it a really nice density, and cutting back on white flour is never a bad thing. Thanks for the recipe, Bethany!

This cornbread is excellent!  I am a very inexperienced cook and found the instructions easy to follow and the end result is a very moist cornbread just like I remember from down at my grandmother's in Calhoun, Louisiana.  Thank you for this great recipe. I will never purchase boxed cornbread mix again.

I made a lot of substitutions to this recipe which might have resulted in it being very dry. I used milk and lemon juice as suggested in place of buttermilk, as well as whole wheat flour and 100% whole grain corn meal. Next time, I might try using only 1/2 or 1/4 whole wheat flour, since the corn meal I was using was already 100% whole grain. I also cut back on the ingredients so that it was only for 6 people and reduced the baking time which is where I think the trouble came; I'm pretty sure I overbaked. I cooked for about 25 minutes and it came out very dry. I realize that I've never been very good at estimating the baking time after reducing the ingredients. Maybe for a first time, I should just bake it as written, or at least severely UNDERestimate the time needed to bake and then just keep checking frequently. I want to retry this recipe and I still have corn meal leftover so I will! I think the problem isn't with the recipe but just with what I did so I'm still going to give it 4 stars and will update this after my second try!

Holy cow! I've never made cornbread from scratch before, but I'm eating this right now and it's everything I'd ever want cornbread to be! If you like your cornbread on the sweet side that is. The texture is spot on. It's moist and soft, but sturdy with a crisp top and edges. It's a sweet cornbread, but not overly so. Like others, I was concerned the eggs might start to scramble when I added it to the pot with the melted butter, but I think this isn't an issue as long as you melt your butter on low heat. I made this all in one pot. I will never need to look for another cornbread recipe! Perfect!

I thought, How can over 600 people be wrong? But after trying this recipe, I think the word SWEET should be in caps.  If you like your cornbread more akin to a cake, this recipe is for you, but if you're like me, save your ingredients and try one with less sugar.

I have made this cornbread a gazillion times and it turns out perfect everytime.  I'll take it to functions and people rave.  This cornbread has sugar in it "OH NO"!!!! That being said, I almost always cut the sugar in half in ALL my recipes. Thats just the way we roll. Our tastebuds have adjusted.  Also, I start checking my baked goods at the FIRST given time, in this case it is 30-40 minutes. So I started checking for doneness at 30 minutes. If you wait until 40 minutes, you might just have dry cornbread. And to those of you claiming this doesn't taste enough like corn, I randomly viewed 5 other cornbread recipes on this site. They all either had equal portions of cornmeal to flour or less cornmeal to flour.  Perhaps you haven't eaten a lot of cornbread and expected something different. Perhaps you used a white cornmeal.   I too make it all in one bowl. I nuke the butter in the microwave in a big batter bowl and then add everything to it.

Nice flavor but quite dry.  I followed the recipe to a tee and baked for 30 minutes.  I should have followed another reviewer's tip to sub sour cream for the butter.

Made it for a big supper--about 30 people--and everyone said it was the best cornbread they'd ever had. Even the other cooks in the room raved about it.

I mostly followed the recipe - just melted the butter in the microwave, and then mixed everything up in a bowl, and poured into a greased 8x8 glass baking pan.  30 minutes at 375 was perfect!  As made, this was a sweet cornbread - you don't need to drizzle honey over it (unless you really want to!).  This will be the recipe I use for homemade cornbread from now on.

I am not a fan of corn bread.  Then again I think I have  only had it made from a box.  My husband and son do like it.  They often eat muffins for breakfast.  This recipe can't even be compared to a box.  It was wonderful.  My husband told me to save the crumbs when I gave him a piece. I packed some for my son's (17) school lunch.  He later volunteered that is was a wonderful surprise. I think I will make two batchezs next time and freeze one of them.  Thanks.

YUMMY!  This cornbread was excellent.  It was moist and slightly heavy with just the right amount of sweetness.  This is the best cornbread yet in my opinion.  Only thing I did different is that I didn't have an 8" square pan so I used a 9" pan and cooked for 8 mins less.  Otherwise, I didn't change it at all.  Great Recipe...Thanks!

WONDERFUL recipe!!
I made it exactly as written and it turned out beautifully!  Moist and delicious!!  Just the right about of sweetness and yummy buttery-ness.  I have a cup of leftover buttermilk so I plan on making this again later this week!  the only thing I did different is use a sauce pan instead of a skillet to mix everything.  This just seemed to make more sense and as I said it turner out lovely.  Added plus was that it is super easy to make!

I made the recipe as indicated and it turned out pretty good. The second time it was even better than the first one. It was easy to make, took no time, it had a nice taste and texture and it will be a great addition to your breakfast, lunch, or dinner table.

This is the only cornbread recipe I use anymore.  We absolutely love it! Update-I decided to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and use whole wheat flour. I baked it for 35 minutes. It was still plenty sweet and moist. We like it this way just as much.

Very good.  This uses less buttermilk, cornmeal and more flour than my regular recipe but we love sweet cornbread and this made hubby happy too.  I tell everyone who hasn't tried yet that they are missing out on a great thing if they haven't made cornbread on a cast iron skillet yet.  It forms a great crust at the bottom and it is heaven.  If you do, melt some of the butter in your skillet in the oven, after melted, carefully remove skillet and turn to coat well before adding the butter.

I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup and it was still too sweet for us. It was definitely edible with a good texture and is good for breakfast and snacking but not with savory, dinner foods. I'll stick to more traditional, Southern corn bread recipes, with no sugar.

This recipe is delicious!! Funny story- I am new to cooking and when I smelled the buttermilk I thought I had a bad carton. I didn't realize it's supposed to smell that way! Needless to say I threw the buttermilk out and used 1% milk instead, glad I hadn't ruined the cornbread by putting in bad milk. My bf explained it to me when he got home and now we laugh about it. I'm sure it tastes great with buttermilk too, but we love it with regular milk! GREAT recipe!

I've made this recipe several times since discovering it and it always came out on the dry side. I found that lowering the temperature to 350 degrees and cooking for the same amount of time leaves the bread oh-so moist. I also whisk a nice loooong squeeze of honey before I pour it into the pan.   I pair this with "It's Chili by George!!" for a winner every time. Thank you for such a great recipe!

This is absolutely a 5 Star Rating! This is how cornbread is supposed to taste!  No need to look further, this beats every cornbread recipe I have tried. I added 1/2 can of corn and got rave reviews both times I have baked it as a side with chili.

I cooked 3 slices of bacon in my cast iron cornbread pan and drained out all but 1T of the drippings. The bacon was crumbled into the cornbread, and I added 2/3 cup of sweet corn. I omitted the salt since I added bacon. It cooked in the cast iron for 30 minutes and came out moist and delicious!

No more Jiffy in a box for us!  This was awesome.  The only thing I did different was cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup because I was afraid it would be too sweet,but I think even the 2/3 cup would be fine!  Also, unless you have a cast iron skillet that can be put in the oven, don't bother melting the butter in a skillet.  Why dirty an unneccesary pan?  I microwaved the butter in a large pyrex bowl and mixed everything in from there.  Oh and I had to go to 2 different stores to find buttermilk, but it was worth it.  I made this to go with my traditional football chili and I had one very happy husband for Monday Night Football.  Thank you Bethany's Grandmother!

This is the *perfect* recipe!! I usually alter things in recipes, but this one is perfect as is.  I have never made really tasty corn bread before, but this is THE receipe I always needed!  I melted the butter in the microwave in a large pyrex measuring cup, and then stired & measured things directly into it, and it  was much faster.  It always takes my cornbread a full 40 minutes to cook.

The bread was dry and tasted like there was too much flour.  I wouldn't rule this out because I could taste the potential in the recipe.  Next time I will cut back on the flour, and perhaps increase the butter or buttermilk a bit.

Delicious. Moist. Had great texture and not overly crumbly as my previous favorite cornbread recipe was. This is my new favorite recipe. I did not have buttermilk on hand so I substituted 1/4 cup milk plus 3/4 cup plain yogurt. It made the dough thicker but worked very well. Next time I'll double this recipe.

Loved it! Easy. Doubled the recipe and cooked it in a 9x13. I made this as directed and it was not too sweet. It was not too cakey and did not fall apart. Just so you know how sweet it is, it is sweet but not as sweet as Jiffy. This is the best recipe ever. Ate it with pulled pork one day and white chicken chili a couple days later. Yum! Thank you, Grandmother!

A great recipe for a traditional cornbread! I never have buttermilk around, so I just take one cup of regular milk (minus 2 TBS) and add 2 TBS white vinegar--stir the mixture and let it sit while you prep all the rest of the ingredients. I've also added in other ingredients, depending on what I'm serving this with: chopped jalapenos, diced green chiles, and green onions are all great!

I made this recipe gluten-free.  I used Bob's Red Mill Corn Flour and I used Bob's Red Mill Brown Rice Flour in place of the all purpose flour.  I also wanted to bake it in a 9 x 13 inch baking pan, so I doubled the recipe and baked for 30 minutes exactly.  It turned out perfectly.  The only change I made was to scale back the sugar a tad (doubled the recipe called for 1 1/3 cups and I only added 1 cup), and I think the corn bread is perfect!

Let me first start by saying that I always change recipes to suit my taste, but this recipe is so delicious that I didn't need to change a thing. I made the recipe exactly as is, and all I can say is yummy!! This has become a staple in our household, and I make it all the time. My family practically begs for it. 

If you do not have buttermilk, you can make your own by adding 1 tbsp of white vinegar to a cup of milk. Then you stir it real good, and then let it set for 5 minutes, but not much longer (or it will curdle).

Very good! A few minor changes. I only had masa harina so I used that instead of cornmeal. I melted the butter and added the ingredients one by one as they are listed in the recipe (too lazy to add in the more complex instructed way) and it came out perfect! Thank you for sharing.

1/9/12 YUM!! I've made this recipe 3 times now and it's definitely a keeper! Each time, the people who I was serving it requested the recipe. I used muffin tins for first batch and a 9" cast iron skillet for the other 2 batches. (I didn't have an 8" and the 9" was just fine). Based on reviews, I put the skillet in the pre-heating oven while while preparing the ingredients. I highly recommend doing this if you have cast iron as the slightly browned, crispy crust is a nice touch for both appearance and texture. If you don't have cast iron, don't fret as the cornbread will still taste fantastic!

In terms of the "sweetness" - I suppose that is a matter of taste/preference. As a native Texan, I guess that means I'm not supposed to be a fan of "sweet cornbread", so after reading the reviews...I was a bit leary of using the entire 2/3 cup of sugar.  My fears were unfounded, though, and I'm here to say this recipe is "Dee-lish" as written!  

Oh...I didn't have buttermilk on one occasion and used low-fat milk and fresh lemon juice.  I took out 3 Tbsp of milk and added 3 Tbsp of lemon juice.  Still came out fantastic!
EDIT 9/6/15: I've made this several times for about 3 years now. I want to stress how importance it is to not over-beat the batter or your bread will come out heavy and dense...just beat enough to incorporate...lumps are okay. Trust me. Also, I've made with skim and low-fat milk and it came out just fine. My go-to cornbread recipe.

Best cornbread recipe ever. Perfect as written. Also good with less sugar if you like a less sweet cornbread. Sweetness is an individual preference. I usually make this into 18 muffins (smaller sized - my muffin tin is 30+ years old) and bake for 20 - 25 minutes. Letting the batter stand 5 minutes before filling the muffin tins, makes them rise very well. Thank you for sharing, Bethany.

This is perfect cornbread.  I made two small changes. I used blue cornmeal (I live in the Southwest) and I reduced the amt. of sugar to a half cup.  I have it in the oven right now in muffin top pans so that we can freeze the muffins and then heat them in the toaster. Very convenient.

I used 1/2c sugar but otherwise followed the recipe. Excellent! Served with tortilla soup, and it was gone in a flash.

Wow, what a great recipe! I melted the butter in the microwave, added the sugar and butter to my Kitchen aid mixer, mixed, then added the other ingredients as suggested. Baked in a spring form pan for 30 minutes at 375. Perfect!! I served with homemade split pea and ham soup made from leftovers. I will use this recipe again and again. It would also make a really good toping for chicken potpie if you didn’t want to use the traditional pie curst top. I love recipes that can be tweaked, you can add cheese or jalapeno pepper, cut back the sugar, however it’s a great recipe as is. The only problem is that I can eat the whole loaf, and I love it with butter spread on top, Thank goodness for good metabolism. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my first recipe review, but I had to review because it was so perfect!  I made only once change, which was to put about half as much sugar, but that was only because I wasn't in the mood for a super sweet cornbread, as we were serving it with chili.  Delicious!  Perfect texture and so moist!

This was outstanding.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan and just baked a bit longer.  When it was hot out of the oven, I spread some honey over top and it soaked in.  Everyone RAVED about this cornbread.  I'll definitely make this again.

Great cornbread. Made with powdered buttermilk on a preheated cast iron skillet. Yum. I've already made it twice this week to rave reviews from the family.

This was fantastic, moist and delicious. Definitely a winner. I'm making this again today and going to slightly reduce flour and slightly increase cornmeal for more of a cornmeal flavor. Also going to substitute the salt with Tony Chachere's and add a little Bhut Jolokia infused honey for a spicy twist.

This is the perfect cornbread recipe and SO EASY! I have made it multiple times, and I follow the recipe exactly, except like some other reviewers, I substitute the buttermilk for a little bit less than 1 c. of regular milk mixed with 1-2 Tbs white vinegar. The result is amazing - slightly sweet, though not overly, moist, with a great cornmeal-y taste (this is a good thing). Sometimes, I lightly brush the top of the cornbread with some clover honey to add just a little more sweetness.

I made it the first time and refuse to make the stuff from the box again. I am a bread and butter type of person and almost had half the dish. It tastes so much better baking it in a cast iron skillet (gives it the buttery crust) and the sugar i only used 1/2 cup because of peoples  reviews i read making it sound like it was to sweet. that 1/2 cup does just fine! Thanks Bethanyweathersby

AMAZING!! I have been trying different cornbread recipes and none of them satisfied my taste until this! I mixed all ingredients in the pot I melted butter in which was done easily, quickly, and wasnt messy at all (like other reviews). I did cut sugar to 1/3cup (from reviews) BUT I will use all the sugar next time. We like our cornbread sweet and that was the only thing lacking to us. I didnt have buttermilk so I mixed 1cup milk and 1tbs lemon juice together and sat it out for 10mins. I cooked in 9x9 baking dish sprayed with butter flavored cooking spray for 30 minutes. DELICIOUS.  This is a keeper Finally and I will make this again and again

This recipe was AMAZING! Best cornbread I've ever had. I changed the recipe to make it vegan, and made my own buttermilk using soymilk and lemon, this came out perfect. My husband doesn't usually like baked vegan foods, but he loves this! I use this recipe every single time I make soup. So tasty!!

This was very good!  I will use whole wheat flour the next time (as per the submitter's comments), and I will go just a tad short on the sugar.  You can make changes as you see fit, but this was just delicious--and easy!  I'll be making this one again!  UPDATE:  I used this recipe to make corn dog muffins for my granddaughters.  It turns out that my son and wife also like them, so I have a request for a repeat.  The first time I made them by cutting up the hotdogs into the batter (thinking it would be better for the 18-month-old), but this time I'll make them by just cutting the boiled Hebrew National hotdog to fit into the middle of the muffin.

Personally, I found it to be too sweet and cake-like.  I had to give it five stars anyway because my husband and my son (the pickies) liked it better than any cornbread I'd made before.  My son even ate the leftovers for breakfast!

Very good cornbread!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used one cup of milk with 1 TBS. of vinegar.  I also used half whole wheat flour, half all-purpose flour and reduced the sugar by a couple tablespoons.  I'll make this one again!

I have been missing cornbread since moving to Denmark. This was such a treat!! I reduced the sugar by half which still made it plenty sweet. I made it into muffins because as of yet, I do not own a cast iron skillet. I know - *gasp!* But we loved it anyway. My husband (who had never tried cornbread before) said: "Det smager rigtig godt! Det smelter i munden." (It tastes really good! It melts in your mouth.) High praise. This will be my staple cornbread recipe from now on. We're happy! BTW - they freeze wonderfully. Thanks Bethany!

This cornbread has just the right amount of sweetness and holds together well when slicing.  I made this recipe as listed except used skim milk + 1 tbs lemon juice in place of buttermilk and cooked in an 8.5x4.5x2.5" loaf pan.  I had to increase cooking time to about 1 hr because of the pan size, but the end result was worth it.

Very good crumb and keeps well in the fridge. I did not fancy it too sweet so I reduced to 1/3 cup sugar and that worked fine. Used false buttermilk - cup milk (anything but skim) with 1T lemon juice, sit 10 minutes on counter. I would not change anything, this is fairly rich but a good accompaniment to a veggy & meat meal that has some kind of sauce. Bit dry to eat on its own.

I am from the deep south and made this recipe just as it stands.  After reading many other reviews I did cut the baking time to about 28 minutes, but I did not use my cast iron skillet.  I think it would need to cook longer in the skillet.  It came out great and my entire family loved it, even my Yankee husband that normally does not eat cornbread.  Awesome and will use again!

Yum!  This is the sweet type of cornbread I like to make with chili on a cold winter's night.  I followed the recipe for the most part; however, I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 1 cup of milk + 3/4 tsp cream of tartar.  It worked like a charm.

I have baked this recipe several times n the only time it wasn't fabulous was the ONE time I forgot to add the baking soda. Otherwise, the recipe is " a la perfecta"! The butter makes it oh so crunchy which my husband ( and myself) loves. And we can NEVER eat just one piece! ?? Cyndi g

Still the best cornbread recipe I've made. As said by the op, mix the cornbread up in a separate bowl, then I do use my cast iron skillet, preheated, oiled ,and a bit of butter for flavour-melted in the hot skillet just before you put in the cornbread. Let cool a few minutes before you cut, it will hold together just fine. Thanks Bethany for an awesome recipe, no matter what category it is in!  5 more stars are deserved.

LOVE this cornbread!  I serve it with ham and collard greens for an awesome Sunday dinner!  The first time I made this, I accidentally added baking powder instead of soda at first; instead of throwing out the batter, I just added in the required amount of baking soda and kept the baking powder addition.  Ended up even fluffier and lighter--yum!

This recipe was absolutely fantastic! The batter tasted sweeter that I usually like but once baked the sweetness was bang on perfect! I put the batter into muffin cups, it filled 15 and sprinkled a few kernels of corn ontop, baked for 33 minutes at 375 . I will never use my old recipe again, thank you so much"grandma" :)

I love sweet cornbread. This is the best recipe that I have found. I did have to reduce the cooking time to about 30 minutes. The first time I made this I just happened to check at 35 minutes and it was already over cooked. Just keep a close eye on it the first time you make it and figure out the correct time for your oven.

Fantastic recipe! I've adapted it into a gluten free version and everyone who ever tries it absolutely loves it. I've also made the recipe exactly as is and it is wonderful. The only thing that really needs to be changed is to add eggs slowly while whisking very quickly. If you add the eggs quickly, you'll get solid bits of egg in your cornbread.

To make gluten free:
swap out all purpose flour for a gluten free flour blend (I make my own)
Add 1tsp xanthan gum. Whisk this into the flour blend before adding.

My own special twist:
Swap out half of the butter for coconut oil. Absolutely delicious!

My first time ever making cornbread. I never even ate cornbread so I wasn't sure how it was supposed to turn out but this turned out AWESOME.
Oh and I'm Canadian EH? Trying out new southern foods.

It sure is tasty.  A local specialty grocer had a corn bread with dried cherries in it a few years back and I thought,"I can make that at home!"  But it didn't turn out, because I was using a more normal "Southern" style recipe.  This one is more like cake, so I thought I would try again.  It is terrific with a cup of dried cherries.  I should probably cut back on the sugar since the cherries are sweet, but I haven't done so yet.  I also substitute Greek yogurt for the buttermilk, so the protein count goes way up.  Thanks for the great taste.

I'll never understand why some people have to be so mean...  We love this recipe and have been using it for years!  We don't change a thing but if you want to reduce the sweetness, just use less sugar.  If you are from the south and are used to not having sugar in your cornbread then go find a different recipe.  We ARE from the south and still enjoy the sweet cornbread.  Thank you dearly for sharing such a loved recipe.  The number of high ratings and the sheer standing of this recipe should speak for itself.

I made this recipe exactly as written (except I didn't have buttermilk so I sub'd whole milk with a Tbsp of cider vinegar). Okay so here's the verdict from my hubby who does NOT eat cornbread:  Hubby says I can make this recipe ANY TIME I want!  He says it's the best cornbread I've ever made.  

  I guess this one is a keeper!  

I melted the butter on the stove just as the recipe explains and then added the ingredients into that same pot and mixed well. Then I poured the batter into an 8x8 glass baking dish and baked for 30 min.  Cornbread was very soft, moist and deliciously sweet. If you would rather not have a 'sweet' cornbread, omit or decrease sugar. For us it was the right amount of sweetness.  

   AWESOME cornbread!

I've never had cornbread before(living in another country:),but decided to give this recipe a try as it is very popular and very highly rated.I used YELLOW cornmeal, and maybe it was the reason the finished product had a distinctive harsh sandiness which neither of my family liked.I am not against a chewy result in my baked desserts,and often add steel cut oats to quick breads to make them healthier.But in this bread there was too much to chew:(At present I don't think baking with yellow cornmeal is worth all the efforts.Still thank you for sharing your recipe:)

To make diet-friendly, I did the following: used 1/4 c. applesauce and 1/4 c canola oil.  Used white whole wheat flour and added 1 T baking powder.  Will definitely keep as my go-to cornbread recipe.  Also, I have made with oatmeal flour instead of cornmeal.  I just put old fashioned oatmeal in the blender and pulsed it to flour and added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon too.

This recipe is SO good! The cornbread is so moist and flavorful, our dinner guests loved it and asked for the recipe! We served it with the "terrific turkey chili," which was also really amazing, and a lot of our guests put the cornbread into the chili and ate them together. 

Rave reviews and will definitely make again!

This is a wonderful recipe. I used a baked yogurt drink instead of buttermilk and 1/4C honey instead of sugar, and baked it closer to 40 minutes, as I was using a loaf pan  Slightly sweet, but not very, and quite moist inside.  My new go-to recipe for cornbread, for sure.

super yummy! Though I've made some changes so now it's realllly not traditional corn bread :) I only used 1/4 cup of margarine, added about a 1/4 cup (maybe a bit more) of low fat sour cream, added a 1/2 tsp baking powder and reduced the sugar a bit. I also made in a muffin tin and baked for 17 mins. These are great for my lunches and nice that they have much less fat now. :)

I don't know why some people are complaining that this isn't "true Southern cornbread", because the recipe's author never once claims that this is a Southern recipe!  I, for one, LOVE sweet cornbread!  I have made this recipe numerous times now and my family always devours it.  I've made it as muffins (baked for about 20-25 minutes), but our favorite way to eat this is when I preheat my cast iron skillet in the oven with about 2 Tbs of bacon fat, then pour the batter into the sizzling hot skillet/bacon fat and bake as directed in the recipe.  Thank you for an awesome cornbread recipe, BETHANYWEATHERSBY!

This is an excellent recipe, as is. It has a nice crumb and does well with beans.

However, since developing Type 2 diabetes, I'm always looking to find ways to modify a recipe to lower its impact on my blood sugar. 

What I did here was to use 1/2 c. powdered stevia in place of the sugar. This made a cornbread that had a hint of sweetness, without taking a sugary glycemic index hit...and my family still liked it! The stevia I use says you can use it measure for measure, but I never do--it just seems sweeter than sugar to me. 

It's really hard to make any cornbread that's not going to hit you hard as a diabetic, but at least I feel a little better when I do indulge.

Pretty good!  I used 1/2 sugar and 1/2 honey and also soured half and half instead of buttermilk.  Baked in a mini muffin pan for about 11-12 minutes.  Also mixed diced pickled jalapenos and some cayenne into about half of them...delicious!

This is one of the best things I have ever eaten. The cornbread is so moist and delicious - I could not believe how good this was. I followed the recipe exactly as written - the method of incorporating the hot, melted butter with the sugar and eggs was not something I was used to for making cornbread, but it worked perfectly and my eggs thankfully did not scramble. My cooking time in an 8x8" pan was 30 minutes exactly.

I thought 2/3 cup sugar was too much so I cut back to 1/3.  It was still way too sweet.  Otherwise the texture  was nice and fluffy.  May try it again with no sugar.

Way too sweet for corn bread and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was more like cake. I could have put orange frosting on it and used for a birthday cake.

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever made, so moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, made no substitutions.  I did double the recipe, baked in a 9X13 for 35 min.  Perfect.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is the best cornbread recipe in existence. I used evaporated cane juice, whole wheat flour and made my own buttermilk with apple cider vinegar. I will never use another recipe again. Thank you!

I dont know what went wrong but I followed the instructions step by step and had very high hopes for the taste, based off the reviews but boy was I wrong. It was very sour and too thick. I will not be trying this again. I wouldnt even give this 1 star, but it was required in order to rate.

Awesome!!  Cured a summertime craving for a hearty winter treat.  Due to diabetic restrictions, I used 1/2 C. Splenda and 1/2 C. Sugar.  I also subbed 1 Tbsp of vinegar to the 1 C. of milk because I never have buttermilk.  Doubled the recipe, baked in a 9"x13" aluminum cake pan for 40 minutes excatly and it is perfect!  Thank for a great recipe!

Made exactly acc. to recipe but in muffin tins.  I made 12 muffins and the taste was PERFECT!  They were on the smallish side, so next time will use more batter to make fewer but larger muffins, i.e. 10 or so.  Not as good the next day, but you should have no problem eating them all on the day you make them!  This is my new GO TO cornbread recipe.

This is one of the best buttermilk recipes I've ever made. Delicate, moist and slightly sweet. Like the originator I made everything in the same pot/skillet I melted the butter in. It makes less mess.

This was very good!  I did reduce the sugar to only about a 1/4 cup because I don't like it real sweet.  It was very crumbly.  A friend said if you cut down on the butter it will help that.  I'll try that next time.  Will definately make again and again!

This recipe was fantastic! Moist, full of flavour & quick to make. I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup because of personal preference. And I didn't have any buttermilk so I used a cup of regular milk and added a tbsp of white vinegar to sour the milk, worked very well. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe, I will definitely be making it again!

It was so good, that I just had to leave a review! Easy to mix up, moist and sweet....great with 
chili!  Try it, you won't be sorry.  I will try it with some whole wheat flour next time as someone suggested, but I always try the original recipe first!
Enjoy!

What could I add to all of these excellent reviews that hasn't already been said? This is a delicious cornbread. I have made it as a cake and as muffins, great either way.

This recipie was not what I was looking for, but it sure was good!  As someone else mentioned, this is a New England style, sweet-cake type cornbread.  Perfect if you are used to packaged cornmeal muffin mixes & want something with a similar, though decidedly better, flavor.  I didn't have a dryness problem as some have mentioned.  In fact, I found it perfect eating right out of the pan (& I normally slather butter on my cornbread, then drench in honey or maple syrup).  A nice desert cornbread.

I made this last night to go along with my Grandma's chili.  I was looking for a sweet, cake like bread and I finally found it with this recipe.  It is awesome!  Although I realized halfway though the recipe I only had about 1/3 C of cornmeal so I had to substitute corn flour for the emailing 2/3 C.  I will try it again as written but this is going in my favorites list Thank you!

We made this to go with the Slow Cooker Lentil and Ham soup. It was great. I still have some buttermilk left so I may make another batch to freeze for later. I may try cutting back on the sugar, too.

Made this recipe and one other cornbread recipe to accompany a big pot of black eyed peas and ham hocks. Most of the people liked the results but I wasn't impressed much. I don't think I'll be making it again. I was better than the other recipe I made though!

Holy Cow.  This recipe is super simple, and for how simple it is, it is SOOOOOO good!!!  Just like one reviewer said, because I was using salted butter, I saw no need to add more salt.  I had Whole Wheat Pastry Flour, so I used it.  It didn't do anything to it in subtracting flavor or make it cook weird.  So, it came out healthier (Well, as healthy as a cornbread with buttermilk and a stick of butter can be)…  ;-)  All in all, this recipe is TOTALLY a keeper!!!

I made exactly as stated, only doubling, cooking in a 9x13 pan, then cooling half the bread before wrapping  and freezing for later use. I love sweets, and sweet cornbread, but this was a little too sweet for me, so next time I'll reduce the sugar a little. This is my new favorite cornbread.

This is my new cornbread recipe! It is so delicious and so easy! I melted the butter in the microwave because it seemed easier. I just melted it right in my big mixing bowl and then mixed everything in. I didn't have buttermilk on hand (I never do), so I mixed 1 oz lemon juice with 7 oz low fat milk. Worked great!  Seriously, do not pass this recipe up! It was so moist and delicious, I scraped off the butter because it just doesn't need it... and I always butter bread!

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cornbread. Its the perfect amount of sweet for my taste.  Like some others, I used whole wheat flour to make it a little more healthy.  I also had to adjust the cooking time in my oven to 20 minutes.  I make this with Debdoozie's Blue Ribbon Chili also found on this site, and neither last long in my house :~)

Perfect!  Perfect!  I made this for the 1st time 2 days ago and I made 2 more today.  Instant hit!!  The recipe could not be easier.  I will never buy another store bought cornbread.  I made my own buttermilk using 8 oz milk and 1 table spoon apple vinegar cider.  I can't wait to try this with whole wheat flour.  Thanks for a GGRREATT recipe!!
*************************
Also excellent with whole wheat flour. That's the only way I make it now!!

Wonderful!  The only thing I changed was the sugar...only used 1/4 cup because I didn't want the sugar to overpower the taste of the really good grade of cornmeal that I used.  Next time I may even reduce it some more.  Thanks for a great recipe!  UPDATE:  1-28-19  I've been making this for a few years now and have upped the buttermilk to 1 1/4 C. or so and also the sugar to a heaping 1/4 c.  I also found that for me it was easier to melt the butter in the cast iron skillet on the stove burner and then pour the butter into bowl with the sugar and mix.  Then mix in the rest of the ingredients one by one ending with the flour/cornbread/salt mixture.  Just don't over mix at the last.  Pour into the heated skillet that I leave sitting on the burner while I prepare the cornbread.  When I started doing it this way I started getting lots of compliments!  Always turns out moist and delicious!!

I followed this recipe exactly except that I didn't have buttermilk.  So I used the "acceptable" substitute (Put 1 Tbsp White Vinegar in a measuring cup, then fill to 1 cup with milk and let sit for 5 minutes).  It worked perfectly and this corn bread is wonderful.  It's moist, not crumbly, and has the perfect combination of sweetness without being too sweet.  I couldn't even wait for dinner.  I'm eating this all by itself with butter and it's delish!  Thanks for a wonderful keeper.

Three stars because it's far too sweet for me - I felt like scraping my mouth out after trying it. It is a good recipe IF you cut the sugar in half or less - 1/4 cup worked for me.

Absolutely moist & delicious!!  Now, if you prefer dry and non-sweet cornbread, this isn't for you.  This is a deliciously moist cornbread and was a huge hit at last year's Halloween block party.  :)

What a wonderful moist cornbread. I substitued the buttermilk for lowfat milk. Not quite sure what change it made, but the buttermilk I had on hand was expired so this was a last minute switch. Next time I will make it with the buttermilk. This is a great bread!

I thought this cormbread was wonderful! Just as cornbread should be, dense, moist and delicious. Didn't have any buttermilk, so I made my own with 1 tbsp. white vinegar and enough milk to equal 1 cup. Turned out perfect.

Absolutely wonderful...though I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 (and it's still plenty sweet).  I'll never need another corn bread recipe.  This is a winner!

This is fantastic!  The texture is great, not grainy at all.  It was not to sweet, I worried it would be.  If you make muffins, mine took 20 min.  I made some muffin tops too and they took 15 min.  I was out of milk and I am glad I was out.  I have a recipe I use out of one of my cookbook, but I think this one will take over now.  Thanks so much for sharing!

I love the cornbread at our favorite local Cajun/Creole eatery. A waitress confided that it was a Sara Lee frozen cornbread. (this place has currently gone TexMex and is possibly closing down) I’ve always loved cornbread & muffins, & tried many times to make that perfect recipe. This one came so close to Sara. But somehow, I simply cannot get that super-moist, nearly-cakelike texture; you know – the one that doesn’t need any butter at all added at the table. Then, duh, I realized back when I bought my cornmeal, my only option was self-rising. Naturally, my ‘first’ cornbread came out a tad dry, but tasty nonetheless. Then, my hubby suggested that I add some actual corn, as he remembered from our soon to be gone local Cajun fix. So, for my ‘second’ cornbread, I omitted the baking soda (because of the whole self-rising cornmeal), and added one small can (8.5 oz) of corn – chopped up in my Toastmaster Chopster. Number 2 came out like a brick, a moist brick, but a brick. So for the 3rd & final attempt, I went with half a can of chopped up corn & half the baking soda. It was still a hair drier than I wanted, but to no fault of the recipe. I’m sure if I went with the half can & no baking soda it would be superb. I will make this again, but with normal corn meal. I gave four stars – if only to leave room for my own improvement. Thank you so much for sharing your Grandmother’s recipe.

prefer jiffy mix.  used 1/2 sugar and it was not too sweet.  too dry.  just didn't like it.  suggest using the full 2/3 c sugar but really just forget it.

Yummy yummy.

This is a great recipe for sweet cornbread. I just stuck my cast iron skillet in the oven w/o transferring. Turned out perfect.

Very Moist! I used a pre-heated iron skillet. Cooked 35 minutes. Do not over cook because it will dry out as stated by the bad reviews. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I've been making this cornbread for four years now.  It is currently my favorite.  I've not found a better one.  My taste must have changed, because I like my cornbread on the sweet side and this is perfect.  The texture is out of this world.  Reminds me of the cornbread from kfc only (of course, it's homemade) better.  OCT 2005:   I followed the recipe and did not change a thing.  Very moist and sweet. Although, I was looking for something a little less sweet.  It's good, but not what I was looking for.  I'm going to keep looking.

My family loves this recipe!  The only difference was I didn't use a skillet just used a bowl and melted it in the microwave.  Also with the milk I use regular plus 1 tablespoon of vinegar. I've been making this recipe for sometime.  Tonight I changed the recipe some so my daughter (who is allergic to milk) could have some. I used soy butter and rice milk with vinegar.  Was still really good! Thanks for the recipe!

We had a soup night yesterday(http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Tim-Perrys-Soup-Creamy-Curry-Cauliflower-and-Broccoli-Soup/?prop31=3)and for some reason I thought of having cornbread with it.
I don't often think of cornbread as a dinner side, especially if sweet. But the sweetness complimented the more savory flavours in the soup. I decided to try baking it in a cast iron skillet. 24 minutes later it was ready to eat. Beautiful when served warm.
Confession: I accidentally put double the baking soda in the batter but without duplicate ingredients for a do-over, I had to forge ahead.
I thought it was doomed to taste soapy and it was fine.
While trying out a new slow cooker recipe for scalloped potatoes & Ham. I thought cornbread would make a complimentary side.
 Now, I'm a believer of "read over the "WHOLE  recipe first". I do 99%. But not this time. So I screwed  up on the baking soda amount again, plus I blended the batter silky smooth when it should have had a few lumps. As before, I baked it anyway in a cast iron pan.
     Despite all my blunders, it was perfect. AGAIN! That's not luck. That's a great recipe that has earned an upped rating from me. *****

My family loves cornbread with chili, soup...well they even eat leftovers for breakfast with maple syrup!  I've always used the Jiffy mix as it used to be so cheap and easy to make but at the store last time I noticed that the mix, which was 3 for a $1.00 for decades I think are now 75 cents each--a real rip off in my opinion.  

a few nites ago I decided to try homemade cornbread.  I always double the recipe (or use 2 boxes) so I doubled this.  I've also found reading reviews is one of the best way to try a new recipe so I used one batch worth of sugar, half wheat flour and, as always, added a can of cream style corn (I decrease the milk-and I do it by 'feel' so I can't offer specifics though if you've made corn bread often enough you know how it mixes up and how much liquid you need).

I also use a cast iron pan, buttered and heated for my cornbread.

This was a superior recipe-one of the simplest and best I've tried from this website.  we had cornbread left over and I used it last night in a stuffed acorn squash recipe instead of store bought corn bread stuffing.  An excellent addition.

I read the 'Southern recipes' for cornbread and they seemed heavier on the fat and more complicated...this West Coast family will stick with Bethany's recipe from now on!

Thanks so much for submitting it!!

I followed the recipe exactly, but I think I'll try using whole wheat flour next time. This, by far, is one of the best cornbread I've ever had.  It reminds me of cornbread from upstate New York I'd eat as a child. Dangerously delicious, moist and perfectly sweetened. My family could not stop eating it! Thank you!!!

Wonderful! I think maybe my grandmother fed me this too! lol
I did cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and reduced the time to 25 minutes. Perfect! Thank you again for a delicious cornbread! This will be the recipe for me here out.

Great recipe. I cut the sugar in half and it is still real sweet. I also make this in my Belgian waffle maker or corn dog maker. It makes it better for dipping. It also makes it easier to freeze. I made a double batch the first time and my son walked by me with six pieces on a plate and told me I need to make more corn bread. thank you for providing the perfect recipe. If you don't have buttermilk just sour the milk with lemon juice or vinegar.

The only thing I changed was I used 1 1/2 c corn meal and 1/2 c flour. It turned out great in flavor. Unfortunately, I did not cook the first batch long enough. But, the husband didn't care! He really liked it, as did I. I, too, used my little iron skillet to bake this. Makes a great crust. I will make this again and make sure to cook longer.

I absolutely love this recipe! Perfect exactly as it is, no changes for me and my bunch. I love a sweeter cornbread and the texture is wonderful, no dry cornbread for this gal. The hubs told the kids it was just like what his grandma used to make esp baking it in the cast iron skillet. Thank you so much for sharing it is now the ONLY recipe I use! ~the happy cook

I love this recipe.  I live in the south, and for those who scowl at this recipe for having sugar in it, because no true southerner would add sugar to cornbread, I have this to say. I will take this way of making cornbread over the non-sugar way any day. :-)

Delicious!  I've been looking for quite some time for a perfect corn bread for my taste.  They are either too crumbly, dry or not sweet enough for me.  I like a moist cornbread with some sweetness to it.  I've been married for 34 years and my husband has never liked cornbread.  I've tried dozens of recipes over the years. I always just make it for myself because he refuses to eat it.  I made a Tex-Mex Chicken casserole the other night and wanted some cornbread to go with it.  I thought I would try this recipe.  Well, I couldn't believe my ears when my husband not only ate a piece, but asked for seconds.  You could have knocked me over.  It was moist, held together well and just sweet enough for my taste.  My husband even asked me if there was enough left over for tomorrow!  He said, this bread is terrific! You can bet this will be the only recipe I will ever use again.  Thank you so much for sharing your grandmother's recipe.  She is my hero.

Oh I NEVER write reviews on recipes. After making this corn bread, I feel compelled to register an account to just express how impressed I am!!! This is simply the best tasting corn bread. In fact it has altered my view of how great a piece of corn bread can taste. Love it!!!

Delicious.  Had to make my own buttermilk using a lemon.  Six people were over for dinner and most of us are from the south (Texas, Oklahoma, Florida).  We all loved this recipe.  I'm making again tonight.  Thanks so much.

Update:  I have made this recipe so many times.  I cannot imagine using another one.  Besides it tasting so delicious, it holds together (if you're gentle)--instead of falling apart into crumbs before you can get it from the plate to your mouth.  My husband has never liked cornbread before--he is crazy about this recipe.

This is the best cornbread I've ever eaten.  Let alone made.  I followed the directions almost exactly.  The only addition I made was adding about 1/4 cup of creamed corn.  It would have turned out just as wonderful without the creamed corn as well.  My boyfriend is a Southern raised man who loved this recipe.  This is our cornbread recipe from here on out.

I made this recipe using half a cup of milk,and half a cup of plain yogurt. The result was the moistest,the fluffiest, corn bread I have ever made. It was so good, my husband,the most finicky eater I have ever met  liked it. So far, he's had two helpings.

My cornbread always turned out horrible until I made this recipe. Thank you so much !!!! I made mine a cupcake pan and they came out great and had a little shorter cook time. 

Thank you for making me a cornbread rock star!

Definitely a keeper!!  I did reduce the sugar to a mounded 1/2 C and increased the cornmeal slightly while equally reducing the amount of flour.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used the vinegar and milk trick.  I also baked it in a cast iron skillet.  Awesome cornbread, didn't crumble, was moist and delicious! I will definitely be making this again!

This is hands down the best corn bread recipe I've ever tried. So delicious and fluffy, and if you don't like it sweet, then cut down a bit on the sugar. This is the second time I've made it in as many days ~. It's a hit with the hubby too!

We have made this recipe many, many times and love it! We always make it just like the recipe says. My son recently had to give up dairy products, however, so we just made it tonight with oil instead of butter and almond milk with a little bit of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk. It still turned out amazing, every bit as good as when we've followed the recipe. Love it!

Wow, perfect cornbread recipe! I am from Georgia and LOVE cornbread and this one completely hit the spot. The only slight changes I made were that I browned the butter and added chopped jalapeños (in vinegar). For me, it was the perfect amount of sweet (especially with the spicy from the jalapeños). They turned out beautifully too and were so moist on the inside! Perfection. :)

This cornbread is amazing! I must admit, up until now I've never made a cornbread other than that on the cornmeal can. What a mistake! What a difference! My kids gobbled it up before even tasting any of their other food. It came out moist and fluffy. Beautiful color. Perfect!
I didn't change a thing, followed the recipe exactly. I think it *might* be a bit sweet for some people, but we loved it the way it is. 
Okay, I did change one thing. I didn't use a pot to melt the butter, to be honest, I didn't see the point in dirtying up a pot just to melt butter. I used a large glass bowl and melted the butter in the microwave, and then mixed everything else in right in that same bowl. Most of my pots are hand wash, and the glass bowl I can just pop in the dishwasher. 
Anyway, this is by far the best cornbread I've ever had. And I don't care what "true southerners" do with their cornbread, this one's delicious. ;)

Ok, I like to pick recipes that are 4-5 stars because they are good...except this one! I suppose there is a first time for everything. I agree with some other reviews. It is way too sweet and more like corn cake. I won't make this again. I wish I hadn't doubled the recipe

The first time I made this, it was between breakfast and lunch. I had a piece when it cooled down a little, then I had cornbread for lunch, cornbread for a mid-afternoon snack, cornbread for dinner, cornbread for dessert, and cornbread for a bedtime snack. What was left I had for breakfast the next day. No shame here. It was delicious.

I made this for chili cook-off day at work.  I made 2 batches, one as is, and one with some roasted red peppers and diced jalapenos for people who like a little more heat.  I got a lot of compliments and requests for the recipe AND there were no leftovers!

I've been waiting a long time for a good recipe for cornbread.  I tried many and all were too dry.  Well, this one was moist, and tasty.  I didn't change a thing in the recipe and it turned out great.  Can't wait to make some for my sister's birthday party dinner, Cajun style.

Well, since a lot of people are commenting on Southerner taste, I guess I will too :) I am a Southerner and I absolutely LOVE this recipe! And so does my family! It's easy to make and so delicious! I cut the butter in half and couldn't tell the difference.

Lots of people like sweet cornbread and this is a good recipe for that type of cornbread.  For Kay who gave this one star... I don't seen anything in the recipe claiming that it was southern cornbread.  So your critical review is unfounded.

I've made this numerous times.  Very easy + very delicious.  I've even baked it in a cast iron pan that I preheat in the oven + just before I add the batter + grease it up good with butter.  It gives it a great crust.

I tried this recipe and prepared it as directed, except I used less butter, because I was OUT! It was almost 1/4 lb. I mixed the butter and sugar and quickly added the lightly combined eggs, (I didn't add it to the skillet I melted the butter in because I was afraid the eggs would curdle) Then I added the flour (unbleached bread flour) and yellow corn mill with the buttermilk and baking soda. Cooked in a convection oven for 35 minutes, let it rest a few minutes and devoured it with the chili I made.  It was the best CB recipe I have made in a long time. Maybe because after living in Georgia for almost 30 years, I was missing the sugar! I think my Kansas roots are telling me something.  LOL!  Not dry at all, even without all the butter.

Great cornbread recipe and really easy.  Can be adapted easily to desired sweetness.  I also don't usually have buttermilk on hand so I just use regular milk (skim, whole or whatever we have, even soy) and mix it with 1 T of white vinegar.  I usually do that as my first step and by the time I get to adding the baking soda to it, it has curdled enough.

Awesome cornbread recipe.  Easy to put together, stays moist and tastes great!  I Spread a little butter on a slice and it was to die for! I knew I wouldn't have a lot of time, so I prepared the batter the day before a refrigerated it.  Took it out and cooked a little bit longer than called for and it was perfect.  Served it up with some homemade chili. It really hit the spot. Definitely a keeper.

This was a great recipe! The only thing I did differently was that I used 1/2 a cup of unsalted butter instead of salted and added a 1/4 of a tsp more of salt (total of 3/4 tsp). To grease the pan I used butter which made it nice and crunchy on the outside. I ended up baking it for 36 minutes.

This is our favorite corn bread recipe! We have it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner:)
We always double it and manage to eat most of them throughout the day!
I use powdered buttermilk, and as I am mixing the ingredients on the stovetop, I add the water for the buttermilk after the butter /sugar/eggs...and then the buttermilk powder with the flour and baking soda.....and it mixes fabulously!

Great recipe! The only thing I did differently was to use a buttermilk substitute with 1 Tbsp white vinegar and then add milk to equal one cup total...Hate having to buy a half gallon of buttermilk for just a cup! I used the full amount of sugar and it was perfect in my opinion...I live in VA and many of the restaurants I've been to around here do actually serve cornbread with a little sweet to it...I cooked this in my cast iron skillet which gave it an awesome crust. Highly recommend this recipe!

Turned out GREAT! Baked up beautiful. I did cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and that still left it sweet. Recipe made a full bread loaf pan so I will cut in half next time to fit my little cast iron skillet!

I made chili tonight and so instead of having the usual corn chips or saltine crackers, I made this cornbread instead!

First off, let me say that I substituted the buttermilk with 1/3 cup butter milk and 1/3 cup Greek yogurt. I had meant to use 1/3 cup buttermilk with 2/3 cups Greek yogurt but I was working too fast, lol! Talk about delicious though. I seemed to have made a wonderful mistake by leaving out the other 1/3 cup of Greek yogurt.

Instead of cooking it for 30 - 40 mins like the recipe stated, I did about 20 - 25 until a toothpick came out clean and the edges were nice and golden brown. Once I removed it from the oven, I smeared a tablespoon of unsalted butter of top for added flavor.

My husband said it was the best cornbread he'd ever had, way better than his mom's (which is saying something since his mom is an awesome cook!). It's a win for the both of us and I'll definitely be making this again!

This is perfect.  I did only put 1/3 cup of sugar because of some reviews, but I think 2/3 would be fine.  It was moist and delicious even hours later.  There is nothing cake-like about this.  Cooked it for 25 minutes in a cast iron skillet. Served it with spicy seafood stew.  Delicious! ***************** ETA a few months later - I made this a second time with 2 cups self rising cornmeal mix (has flour in it so I did not add more flour) and milk (I never have buttermilk, so I usually just add 1 tablespoon lemon juice/vinegar and a little under a cup of milk.  let it sit and use it.), the full amount of sugar and it turned out wonderfully as well. 

And FYI, I'm from the South and I like my cornbread on the sweet side. I didn't know true southerners had to remove sugar... I didn't get the memo!  Though like I said I do not find this overly sweet.  The sugar does a great job at keeping it very moist though!

Made this today exactly as written, baked it for 30 minutes, and my husband and I both thought it was outstanding. It's a little sweet and has a wonderful texture, a bit cake-like without being cake. My mother was Southern, so our family recipe is not sweet and the texture is heavier, but this recipe is going to be an alternate favorite. Thanks for sharing, Bethany!

Yay!  This was great.  I used 2 Tbs of lemon juice with regular milk as a replacement for the buttermilk.  I had to cook a little longer, but my pan was smaller (so the bread was thicker).
2015.02.25 - I am trying this with Naples34102's instructions to make it muffins - 375 degrees, but it took me 32 minutes instead of her 22 minutes (I had a tray below my tins, which may be the difference)

Moist and moist. If you suffer from dry cornbread syndrome, this is the cure. Maybe just a little to sweet. I'm going to try it with a 1/2c of sugar next time. Still 5 stars regardless.

I haven't had corn bread since Middle school.  I got soured on the experience when one of my teachers made it at school with a bunch of us.  I hated the taste.  I decided to give it another try as my mother really liked corn bread, it was too sweet for her taste but it was perfect for me.  I loved the sweet taste and seemed to bring out the flavour of the cornmeal.  LOVED IT!!!

Let's look at the recipe. Does it claim to be "southern" cornbread? No! So, all you southerners need not post negative comments about this particular cornbread! And the world will not fall off it's axis if one does put sugar in their cornbread because they happen to like it! Let's not be snobby! I live in the south and I happen to like both kinds! This one is particularly good!

Great recipe!  I followed one reviewer's advice of oiling my cast iron skillet then placing it in the oven to heat up while I mixed the ingredients.   The only change I made was that I used almond milk mixed with 1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar (I let it settle together a bit while I mixed the butter and the sugar)since I did not have any buttermilk. It came out wonderfully. I set the kitchen timer for 25 minutes then checked it with a toothpick in the middle which came out clean.   Immediately after removing the pan from the oven, I rubbed butter across the top of the cornbread while it was still hot. This recipe is truly wonderful, easy and is definitely a keeper.

I really enjoyed this recipe. It is not too cakey and not too dense. I also like that it does not make too much as leftovers are not the best. I made in a large 6 muffin tin pan and was exactly enough. Delicious with chili. I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 3/4 cup of milk with 1/4 cup of sour cream.

I wanted to make a larger batch, but don't have two 8x8 pans.  I made 1 1/2 times the recipe and used a 9x13 pan.  Baked for 30 minutes and it came out perfectly.  Didn't change anything else.  My husband doesn't like overly sweet foods, and even he enjoyed this with our chili. It is a mildly sweet, very moist end product.  This is my new "go to" cornbread recipe.

I love this cornbread. I love it covered in chili, but it's magnificent on its own as well. It tastes a little closer to a corn cake and is sweet, but still crumbles some.

I followed the directions exactly. I used the correct ingredients as written, melted the butter on the stove, mixed everything in the pan, and took it out right at 30 minutes. The recipe is perfect as is.

I'm not sure how other reviewers can take out the sugar, replace the buttermilk, etc and then declare the recipe just "okay". It's kind of like saying, "This cherry pie recipe is awful. I substituted broccoli for the cherries and it tasted horrible!"

I had a cup of buttermilk to use up, so I selected this recipe.  I followed the recipe, but did add about a half cup of canned corn and a 2 oz. jar of pimentos, both well drained.  Mine tested done after 30 minutes.  We liked this and I would make it again.

We tried this version instead of a packaged mix (yuk) and absolutely loved it.  I followed the recipe exactly as written, mixing it all in one skillet and then baking it.  It is a nice and light cornbread and not overly grainy from the cornmeal.  I may try mixing it in a cast iron pan and baking it in the pan too.  This is definitely a keeper.

The technique might seem weird, but when you're not washing three bowls, you'll understand the method to the madness! I like both sweet and non-sweet cornbread, and don't find this one too far on the sweet scale. It's nicely firm and develops a nice little crunch to the top.  Do not overmix or you'll have tough bread, which would be a shame since this recipe really likes being fluffy. Mine came out exactly at 30 minutes, even though the toothpick was completely covered in batter at 25 - so watch carefully because it finishes quickly! This will probably be my go-to cornbread recipe from now on.

By far THE best cornbread I have ever made or had. I especially liked the corner pieces. I thought it was the perfect amount of sweetness. We ate it with chili, but I would also eat it with some butter and honey. I will definitely be making this again and will count this as my go-to cornbread recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and enjoyed these very much. Overall they weren't as sweet as I thought they'd be.  I made 12 normal sized muffins and only need to bake them about 25 minutes, which actually was too long.  I'd give the receipe 5 stars but I'm not convinced that there isn't a better recipe out there.

This recipe is wonderful!  It is so moist and just plain good!  I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe for years.  I like that this is just the right amount of sweet and doesn't fall apart when you eat it.  It is a keeper! Plus it is so easy to make and economical.

My first attempt at making cornbread from scratch and I will look no further for a recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I had no buttermilk, so substituted 2 T of the milk with lemon juice.  I made them as corn muffins simply because I was in a hurry and wanted them to bake a little quicker (approx. 22 minutes, as another reviewer mentioned).  Delicious, sweet and moist and most importantly, my husband and kids loved them!

Delicious!  Not too crumbly, perfectly sweet and oh so yummy right out of the oven.  I just melt the butter in a glass bowl in the microwave and mix everything up in there.  Almost as easy as using a mix and much tastier.

Best cornbread ever! My husband does not like cornbread, or at least he used to not like it. Now, he asks for this on a regular basis. My kids love it too - it's one of those rare things we all agree on. I make honey butter to go with it (half a cup of butter and about 1/4 c honey; soften the butter and then blend with the electric mixer; let sit for an hour or two).

After reading all of the wonderful reviews, I decided to try this recipe after years of using box corn muffin mix to make my cornbread. This cornbread just was not good at all. Very bland, and definitely not sweet. It was also very cakey in texture, and not like a bread at all. I would not use this recipe again.

I made this wonderful tasting cornbread and now it's my favorite! I like a more moist, sweet cornbread and this fit the bill exactly. The only thing I changed was the amount of sugar. I used 1/2 cup instead of 2/3. I also baked it in a cast iron skillet which gave it a nice brown crispy top! My husband loved it!

SO YUMMY! I made this tonight as a side for my KIDS and HUSBAND to go with chili. I HATE cornbread, or at least i DID until this recipe! OMG, SO GOOD! I will use this recipe often (fighting myself from making another batch RIGHT NOW)! The only thing i changed is that i used fat free milk with a touch of vinegar in place of the buttermilk, since i didnt have any on hand.

Delicious and moist!  Hubby loved it, which is saying a lot since he's not really a "bread" person - considering most breads to be too dry.

Best cornbread recipe I have ever used.  The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat pastry flour.  I have made it both ways now and my family (surprisingly) prefers the pastry flour to all purpose white.

Took readers advice and used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 3/4 cup. I suggest checking the bread about 22 minutes. 25 min was a little dark around the edges. Good simple recipe!

One of the better recipes on this site. This recipe turned me into a cornbread lover. I never liked it before, it was always too dry. The buttermilk is the key. I almost always prefer baked goods that use buttermilk. It adds such great moisture yet is lower fat than other options.  It's great! Definately a northern style cornbread, so if you prefer a more savory version this is not for you.

This really is the best cornbread recipe.  Very moist and great flavor.  I added cheddar cheese and chopped jalapeno's to 1/2 of the batter and baked in a muffin pan.  Everyone loved them!

Wow!  I've always made Jiffy like my mom, but no more!!!  This was super easy and amazing.  Here's a buttermilk tip for those like me who never have it.  1 TB of vinegar and add milk to make a cup.  Let it sit for a while til in curdles.  Also I microwaved my butter in my mixing bowl instead of using the stove.

Good in terms of texture, but it was quite bland and a teeny bit dry.  Followed recipe exactly, including the buttermilk and stated amount of butter.  Next time, would add jalepenos or maybe some cayenne pepper to give it a kick.

Update - made this recipe again tonight with the following changes:

- Decrease sugar to 1/3 cup
- Use 1 and 1/3 cup cornmeal and 2/3 cup flour
- Throw in 3 diced jalapenos

This made it taste more like cornbread (and less like cake), and the peppers added a nice kick to balance the sugar.

5 star recipe with the changes!

We love this recipe as is, but I adjust it a bit since I am lactose intolerant.  I change the butter to margarine & use 2% lactose free milk (milk with the lactose removed, not soy milk) with a little bit of lemon to sour it. I also add about half a teaspoon of cayenne pepper, because sweet & spicy flavors awesome & it has pretty red flecks throughout.

The texture was pretty good and it came out moist, but it was far too sweet to be cornbread.

I'm not a big cornbread fan but wanted to try this because it seemed good enough from the reviews. I followed the recipe exact and with the max amount of time it recommended, I put a toothpick in to check and it came out clean. However, when I took it out and it sat - I found the center to be undone. It wasn't until it started to cool down that I noticed it. So I put it back in for another 10 minutes because it already cooled down. When done, it was fully cooked and semi-moist. My husband's family liked it but I'm still not a fan.

Great recipe.  I used 1/4 cup of sugar b/c I wanted to use this in dressing, but when I make cornbread to go with chili or soup I will follow recipe as is.  My children love sweet cornbread.  I tried out a fine white cornmeal this time as well I loved the texture.  I also used 1 Tbsp of baking soda I didn't pay attention to the baking soda amount I have a conversion that I use standard when I don't have self rising flour or self rising cornmeal.  I also didn't have all purpose flour so I used self rising flour and it still turned out perfect, but my corn meal was not self rising so maybe that is why it turned out okay lol

Very good but also very fattening, a stick of butter is a lot! We enjoyed, thanks for the recipe.

Edit: I have made this a few times since. The last time I sub'd unsweetened applesauce for the butter- it didn't come out so well. More dense & chewy rather than light & fluffy when made as written. Will continue to make as written.

This is the most phenomenal cornbread I have ever tried. It is so buttery and sweet you don't need to top it with anything! Also, a trick in case you don't have buttermilk, just use regular milk and add a teaspoon of white vinegar to it. I would not use this in cornbread stuffing, too sweet...

This was my first time making cornbread and I was just blown away at how easy this was to make and how moist, sweet and delicious it came out!! The only thing different I did was to make my own buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand. I made it by mixing 1 1/2 tbsp of lemon juice to 1 cup of milk and letting it sit for 10 minutes before adding it to the mixture per the recipe directions. My room mate made a pot of beans and ham to go with it and we nearly ate it all up in one evening!!

Really good! Didn't change a thing and it was great:)

I only gave it 4 stars though because I know I've had better before. I can't quite put my finger on it, but I don't think it was quite as moist or flavorful as I hoped it would be. (Which is crazy considering all the butter and sugar in this!) I guess I just like a stronger honey taste in my cornbread better. . .

This was perfect cornbread.  Nicely sweet and rich, the perfect accompaniment to a bowl of chili.  

I only had 1/2 cup of buttermilk on hand, so I made up the difference with 2% and added an extra 1/4 teaspoon of baking soda, but the texture was just right.

Thanks for a great recipe!

This was okay.  It's a little too sweet in my opinion (and I LOVE things sweet) and a bit dense.  I think I will try some other cornbread recipes on this site and try to find something a little lighter and fluffier. But the taste was pleasant and it was easy enough to make.

We loved these.  I did make substitutions.... I used eggbeaters, soy sour cream in place of buttermilk, white polenta and added vanilla extract. I got 9 muffins exactly.  I also upped my oven temp to 450 and baked the muffins for 10 minutes then turned my oven to 350 to finish.  This gave the muffins a very rounded top that I was looking for.   A very tasty, adaptable recipe we will be using often.

With a few little tweaks, this recipe was phenomenal and definitely restaurant quality. The result was a crunchy, buttery cornbread with a slightly sweet taste and a slight, warm spiciness at the finish. 

Like others, I used 1/2 cup of sugar, and the sweetness was perfect for me. I added (to the sugar) about 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper. I folded in fresh corn kernels (about 1 ear's worth) just before baking. 

 I preheated an 8-in cast iron skillet in the oven and baked the cornbread in it for about an hour (I think my oven was just a little slow) until golden brown.  Perfection!

Very good.  Definitely too sweet though, so reduce the sugar a bit.  Also, add fresh corn, cut off the cob, if you've got it.  25 minutes in a cast iron skillet.

Made as directed, using whole wheat pastry flour, and milk+lemon juice for the buttermilk.  It is as claimed - sweet and moist.  Quite cake-like; this would be great for breakfast.  It was nice with chili, but next time, I think I would cut back on the sugar for a dinner cornbread.  That's purely personal preference, however.  This recipe is fine as-is.  Easy to make, low on the dirty dishes scale, and the kids will love it.  I added a handful of frozen corn to the batter, which we liked.

This was pretty great cornbread. Moist and flavorful, but not too incredibly sweet. It was very cake like- which isn't bad. I'd definately make it again.

Moist and very easy to make. I did not have buttermilk, so I added 1 Tbsp of lemon juice to a measuring cup and topped it to 1 cup with milk.

Perfect! This turned our quite moist and delicious! I followed the recipe exactly, however, I have a convection oven so I backed the temp to 350 and checked after 25 minutes. It was done. Thanks! My new fave!

This is THE cornbread recipe!!!! I've tried others on this site and this one was the best!!!! Followed the recipe exactly, with the one exception of whole wheat flour substitution. It was wonderful!!!!!!!!! Melt in your mouth, delicious, cornbread! It was so good in my vegetarian chili. If I could give it more stars I would!!!

Very good recipe all around. But I agree with others that have previously reviewed this recipe, if you prefer a less sweeter cornbread only use a third of the recommended amount of sugar. Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing.

Delicious! Served this with red beans and rice. I cut back on the sugar just a bit, melted the butter in a skillet in the oven then poured the batter into the hot skillet before baking. I only had almond milk on hand so I added 2 tbs of lemon juice to that and used it instead of buttermilk. It came out absolutely moist, not too cakelike but not too grainy - will definitely make again!

I really like the flavor, but it was a little dry.  Next time I will try taking it out of the oven sooner.  Also, I used a glass baking dish, I might try metal to see if it makes a difference.

This is amazing! It was easy to prepare, looks great and tastes great! No more buying the box kind!!! I didn't have liquid buttermilk so I used 4 tbsp powdered buttermilk and 1 cup water instead. It also cooked for just 30 minutes. This is a sweet tasting cornbread but not too sweet. I will be making again, again and again.

Easy and moist.  I baked in a cast-iron skillet.  Might be a bit sweet for some people, and didn't taste as much corn as I like, but overall a good recipe.

This recipe deserves twice the stars!  DELICIOUS!  Used gluten free cornmeal & gluten free all purpose flour, 1/2 cup Egg Beaters instead of eggs.  Didn't have buttermilk so used someone's recommendation of 1 c milk and took out 1 TB and added 1 TB apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk, let sit 5 mins.  Used other recommendation for cooking in iron skillet.  PERFECT EVERY TIME!

and it has become my favorite Cornbread recipe as well :) Made it in my special cast iron pan on the stove, it makes it so moist and it's pretty foolproof. Won't ever follow another cornbread recipe again.

This is a great recipe, just what I was looking for!  I preheated oiled skillet, then poured mix in. I cooked for 30 minutes, and used whole wheat flour as some suggested. It was great and my guests all complimented it.

Great sweet cornbread recipe. I didn't change one thing, and I was barely able to get a piece before the family ate it all. Thanks for such a great recipe!

Oh my goodness. WOW! I took the author's suggestions (used the same pot to mix the ingredients in = less dishes, and I used whole wheat flour) and this came out PERFECT. So delicious, so moist. We enjoyed it days later. I served it initially with "Simple Turkey Chili" and two days later by Saturday it was still stellar. We had it with two fried eggs on top and it was so good. I made mine in a loaf pan and baked it for exactly 38 minutes, but again I used whole wheat flour so white flour may need a time adjustment. I'd give it more stars if I could.

This recipe makes me seem like a better cook!  Can I give it 6 stars?

Oh my goodness, my family now begs me to make more of this incredible cornbread!  My husband calls it 'Corncake' b/c it is so yummy and not much like a 'bread'.  Other cornbread recipes have been dry or crumbly but this comes out so perfectly every time.  

Thanks SOOO much for your willingness to give out this recipe that has become a family favorite of ours.  You made me a better cook! :-)

This made DELICIOUS corn bread muffins.  I didn't have buttermilk so added 1 TBSP of white vinegar to 1 cup of milk and let it sit for 5-10 minutes.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  The muffins baked for 20 minutes and came out moist with a crust on top.  This recipe is a keeper!

Excellent bread!  I love the "mix everything in one pan" part, and it tasted really good with a nice texture and sweet but not too sweet. I used white whole wheat flour, next time I'll try it with the white flour.  Either way, great bread.   Also, I don't know what became of my 8" square pan but I couldn't find it so I baked it in a 9" round cake pan and cut it into wedges instead, that worked fine.

I followed the additonal instructions from the poster -  mixed everything in one bowl and baked for only 30". Also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. Was a huge hit with the family and I'll make this again.

Oh. My. Gosh. Bake it for 20-25. Do not substitute the butter!!! Wonderful! Served it with homemade chili. So easy to make. Will be my go-to recipe for cornbread!  I did reduce the sugar to 1/3 c plus a "little more". Thanks for the great recipe!!!

I was concerned that adding the eggs to an already hot skillet would cook the eggs so I melted the butter in a glass bowl in the microwave and followed the recipe from there.   Wonderful texture and flavor!  I usually don't care for cornbread because it's usually so fall-apart crumbly but this version is perfect!  It's not crumbly yet not too moist either.   Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  But to make it easier, melt the butter in a 2 qt. bowl in the microwave.  Then proceed to add the other ingredients as stated in the recipe. No pan to wash, just a bowl for the dishwasher.

I made it as written, and did not care for it at all.  I do like a sweeter cornbread, but this did not have much of a cornbread taste - it tasted more like a bland cake.  I tried this recipe because I had some buttermilk on hand, but I'll stick with the cornbread recipe in my Betty Crocker cookbook - it uses the same 1/2 c. sugar, but the "corn" taste is more evident.

I used plain non-fat yogurt thinned with a little skim milk instead of buttermilk, and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  This was fantastic.  I think I can safely call this the best cornbread I've ever had.

Truly a New England version of corn bread, it is sweet, moist and oh so yummy! I made this 2 nites in a row, it's that good. It's a perfect accompaniament to soups, stews, chowders, pasta and sauce, casseroles, fried chicken and mashed potatoes, scrambled eggs and bacon, baked beans and slaw...tonite it sides with american chop suey and salad. I wanted to add that while I almost always tweak a recipe to suit my tastes, I made this recipe exactly as written, beacuse it needs NO alterations. It is my new 'go to' corn bread recipe! PS~~~I'm thinking of following the suggestion another reviewer, and baking and freezing a bunch. A big thanks to the submitter...you're gran must have been one heck of a cook!

FABULOUS!  This is a FABULOUS recipe and so easy to make.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used a common substitution of 1 Tablespoon lemon juice and enough milk to make 1 cup.  (I used 2% milk).  This couldn't have turned out better.  Hubby loved it!  I made it to go with Chili but if that is going to happen, I need to go hide it.  lol!  Thank you BETHANYWEATHERSBY for sharing such a FABULOUS recipe!

Delicious, buttery and moist!  I used coarse ground cornmeal and soaked it in the buttermilk before adding it and it gave the cornbread a wonderful crunchy texture.  As soon as it came out of the oven, my nephew and I had a piece each and then he had another for dessert!  My new favorite for sharing with our cornbread-loving 89-year-old Dad!

When we had a Chili Cook-Off in my skills class at culinary school, I used this recipe to clinch the win. Well, my chili came in second place, but the cornbread was the real trophy. It was demolished by my classmates and resident chefs in mere minutes! One chef asked if I snuck in a box of Jiffy. The thing is, this recipe is better than Jiffy could ever want to be!

FIRST TIME EVER that my cornbread has been this good!! BEST part was, I used ALL generic ingredients and it still turned out great.  Also used a preheated cast iron skillet. This bread was very light and fluffy and FINALLY, MOIST!!!  Thank you SO much to the person who uploaded this and all the positive raters so that I would make up my mind to try making cornbread ONE MORE TIME.

There is only one change I've made to the steps in this recipe over time: I soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk first. It's incredibly moist, and it works even with whole grain cornmeal. This cornbread recipe has become my favorite in the past couple of years, though it's not traditionally "southern".  I've found myself reaching for this recipe so often, I'm taping it to the inside of my baking cabinet!

Very good. I bake it in a 9" cast iron frying pan in order to get it nice and golden crusty around the edge. I melt the butter in the cast iron as the oven is warming and then add it to the other ingredients in a mixing bowl,then pour back into the cast iron & bake 25 to 30 min.

SIMPLY THE BEST CORNBREAD RECIPE OUT THERE.  I made this recipe last night, exactly as written (minus one egg because I only had one) and its phenomenal.  My family loved it, I loved it, we didn't even need to put butter on it.  We are very easily pleased with cornbreads, we typically make the stuff in the blue box.  This was amazing and will be my cornbread from now on.  And its incredibly EASY to make!  Definitely a pleaser.  KEEP THIS RECIPE!

Oh my goodness this IS goodness incarnate!  It is delicious as is but might try cutting the sugar a bit next time.  Keep forgetting to do this every time I make it-I think it's because it is so yummy the way it is!  To cut grocery costs, we have beans, rice and cornbread every Monday night (bean, rice and cheese burritos on Wednesday with the leftovers) and the cornbread makes this meal a treat and not a deprivation.   We have dessert only on Sundays but with some syrup and butter, it is a wonderful dessert in between Sundays! YUM!

What makes cornbread worthy of five stars?  I have no idea.  This was good, but didn't knock my socks off, or those of my guests.

I had to stop myself from eating the whole pan as soon as it came out of the oven, it was soooo good. I didn't have buttermilk on hand so I put 1 tbsp of lemon juice in a measuring cup and filled it up with milk until it read 1 cup. Leave it to sit for 5 min and your have buttermilk! Also didn't use a saucepan for melting the butter, just put the butter in a ramekin and microwaved it for just under a minute until it was melted, then mixed everything together in a large bowl in the order  directed and poured it into the prepared pan. I used a stoneware square pan and it was perfect for the cornbread. This recipe is going in the 'favorites' pile!

I was skeptical after tasting the batter and seeing how sweet it really was, but after baking and eating it I decided it's one of my favorite new recipes! I thought it was very moist and perfect with or without butter on it. The only thing I changed was that I baked it in a large loaf pan for 40-50 minutes and covered it for the last 10-15 minutes to prevent it from over-browning.

This was very moist and flavorful cornbread, just like my husband likes it.  (I'm more into dry, corny corn bread, myself.)  I didn't have buttermilk, but did have buttermilk powder, so I used that (1 c. water + 4 TBS buttermilk powder).  I didn't bother mixing the baking soda with the buttermilk.  I also added 1/2 c. shredded cheddar and 1/4 c. chopped green onion to the batter before baking.  It did take my oven a full 40 minutes to bake it.  This is definitely a keeper and goes great with chili.

Cornbread couldn't have gotten any easier, it came out moist with a great texture, and came together fast.  I like mine a little sweet without losing the cornmeal texture traditional cornbread has, and this recipe did the trip.

I thought this was a really good, easy-to-make cornbread recipe. Honestly, I can't taste the buttermilk at all. That could be because my store only had 'low fat' buttermilk, though. I used only 1/3 cup sugar per other reviews. I've made it twice, being very careful not to overcook, and both times it was still pretty dry (but I blame that on my living at high altitude).

This was the best cornbreat I've ever had in my life!!  FYI, if you don't have buttermilk you can easily make it yourself by using 1 cup of milk just under the 1 cup mark and then one tablespoon of white vinegar or fresh squeezed lemon juice and then wait about 5-10 minutes for it to thicken a little.

Just did a test run of this recipe since I've never made cornbread from scratch. This was easy and it came out great. I made a few changes based on the reviews I had read (thank you allyson). Since I used a glass pan I set the oven to 350. Used 6 T sugar and 2 T honey (instead of 2/3 c sugar). As many others I used milk (Lactaid, actually) with 1 T. lemon juice instead of buttermilk. Toothpick was clean after 30 minutes. Thanks Bethany for a great recipe.

The best cornbread ever, from a true cornbread lover! My family and I love this bread and I have planned meals around it more than once. I don't find that the bread is overly sweet at all, follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

I didn't have any buttermilk so I used the lemon juice/milk substitute. I doubled the recipe, cooked it at 350 for 40 min. in 12" cast iron skillet (heated it while putting ingredients togehter) and it was delish!!! Crust was incredible and it was so moist.  Thanks for sharing.

Wow. This is the only cornbread recipe I will ever use! This made the most perfect, delicious cornbread muffins ever! My mom said they were amazing, and my boyfriend said it was the best cornbread he'd ever had in his life. I made 12 muffins, because I just prefer muffins when it comes to cornbread, and they only had to bake for around 20 minutes. Absolutely the best cornbread recipe ever!

Wonderfully sweet cornbread. I live in Texas for a while, never took a liking to cornbread. My children asked me to make cornbread for a BBQ. Found this recipe, and now I will eat cornbread. Gets rave reviews wherever I bring it. Easy to make. A keeper.

WOW!  That's good cornbread.  Almost a thousand reviewiers cannot be wrong.  This recipe does not need another good review.  However, I LOVE IT!  I love cornbread.  It's one of my weaknesses.  I've got to say this is EXCELLENT.  Fast, easy and delicious, if only it was not fattening.  In the time it took for the oven to warm, I was able to prepare the recipe.  Yum, I baked it in a pie pan and had three pieces for appetizer, dinner and dessert.  Thank you.

This was a yummy addition to a sunday afternoon bbq. Though everyone loved the cornbread, in the future, I'd definitely use a smaller pan to be able cut off fat squares of cornbread instead of wider, flatter pieces.

EXCELLENT flavour.  My husband made this in the cast iron skillet and it was really yummy.  It came out a bit flat - but I think that was operator error.  Might have to investigate with another batch ;)

Very good cornbread especially if you like it sweet, and I do. I heated my baking pan in the oven while the oven was preheating then put about a tablespoon of butter in the pan to melt, swished it around and then poured the batter in.  Made a nice crunchy crust!

Now I have a reason to buy buttermilk for something other than biscuits!! This was absolutely delciious. It's probably just great as it's written, but I did make a few canges. I reduced sugar to 1/2 cp, added about 1 tbsp honey, added about 1/3 cp leftover corn, and creamed the softened butter rather than melted it. It makes great cornbread muffins. A little sweeter than the cornbread I usually make but so delicious! **UPDATE** I halved this recipe and jazzed it up by adding 1 tbsp minced red bell pepper, 1 tbsp grated cheddar, 2 minced slices of jalapeno from the jar, and 1 tbsp frozen corn. I also was able to cut down the butter a bit because I figured the juice from added ingredients would pick up the slack.

Gooooodness!  That about sums it up.  This is the best cornbread I've eaten and personally made.  I usually make mine a little on the healthier side, using olive oil and plain yogurt in place of the all the butter, but I'm not regretting the calorie consumption one bit.  This reminds me so much of living in Kentucky when I was growing up and eating buttery cornbread at church potluck dinners.  It's great comfort food but definitely not for dieters!  I only made one small modification.  I replaced half of the sugar with honey just because I love the taste of honey in all my breads.  Thanks to Grandmother for the wonderful recipe!

This is without a doubt the best sweet cornbread I have ever had.  I grew up in the south east and cornbread was always a mainstay item in our family.  I've had grandmas, moms, dads, aunts, uncles, and friends.  Sorry family and friends.  This one tops them all.

This is just as easy as a box mix and sooooo much better.  I don't always have fresh buttermilk so I keep the powdered kind in the fridge and follow the directions on the can. This always turns out well

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great.  It was moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  Not too sweet.  I will make it again.

Made over the weekend, and this is the BEST recipe.  I pre-heated a cast iron skillet in the oven until ready and baked for 23 minutes.  Turned out moist and delicious, great re-heated the next day in microwave for 15 seconds. Thanks for a SUPERB recipe

Great recipe!!!  The cornbread stayed moist.  I also added a can of diced chili peppers and made them just perfect!
Thanks for the recipe.

Make sure to use a 1/4 LB butter NOT 1/4 cup.

A 1/4 LB Butter  = 1 stick Butter.

This recipe is fabulous!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, used whole wheat flour instead of white, added a handful of frozen corn kernels to the batter, and baked it in 2 muffin pans (12 muffins total) for 15 min.  Delish!  I put the leftovers in a ziplock bag and thought they tasted better the second day.  *UPDATE* I didn't have buttermilk and used regular milk that I mixed with a splash of vinegar.  Couldn't taste the difference!

Perfect -real- cornbread!! I doubled the recipe, cut into quarters, froze three, and served one for my family of 5. We served it with honey butter(honey and butter mixed...easy!) and everyone gobbled it up! The frozen ones thawed beautifully, and the bread was never too crumbly. One thing to note - the recipe says 1/4 pound of butter - that is 1/2 cup, or 1 stick...not 1/4 cup! :) You can't skimp on the butter!

This is my new cornbread recipe! It had a unique mixing method, but maybe that's what makes it so good. I doubled the recipe and made 24 good-size corn muffins. I think they only took about 15 minutes in my convection oven. If you're like me and don't have buttermilk on hand very often, you can add 1 Tbs. of white vinegar with enough milk to equal 1 cup. Let it sit for 5 minutes before using.  Other than that substitution, I made these as directed, and they were tasty!

This was very good.  Mine would have been cooked in about 25 minutes, so I wish I would have checked it earlier!  But it was actually quite light considering it has buttermilk in it.  I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and otherwise made as written.

rich, moist, soft, very sweet; would scale back the sugar next time I want to make it with dinner, but this would be just perfect with cranberries or blueberries and lemon zest, drizzled with a little honey for breakfast.  i used 1/2 cup whole wheat flour and baked it at 425 for about 25 min.

Excellent cornbread that my family enjoys over and over again! I love recipes where you don't have to change a thing and this is one of them. My family is from the South and my grandma put sugar in her cornbread...this tastes very similar!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Used plain yogurt instead of buttermilk, to cut calories. Used 1/3 c Splenda instead of 2/3 C sugar and it was plenty sweet. Served Boilermaker Chili from this site over it. YUMMY!

This recipe is great--not too sweet and nicely moist.  I decrease the butter by half and use and extra 1/2 cup buttermilk.  I have also made this with 12 oz. plain or vanilla yogurt in place of all the buttermilk and decreased the butter to 1/4 cup: that was even better.  A keeper, for sure.

My family loves this recipe.  I now only use "this" cornbread recipe.  I have made it several times as is.  I've baked it in a cast iron skillet or an 8 x 8 glass dish.  It comes out beautifully and cuts nicely.  We serve it with our monthly new chili recipe!

This is more like cake than real cornbread.  The recipe is very good, but it is just not cornbread as I came to know it in the deep South.

This recipe is fabulous!  For years, my Dad and I made sweet cornbread by mixing cornbread mix and yellow cake mix, but I moved to Ireland and can't get cornbread mix here!  So I found this recipe - it has the same sweetness and cakelike texture, perfect with chili!  Thanks Bethany!

If you're looking for a sweet, moist cornbread recipe, look no further! This is the best I've ever had. My 88 year old father-in-law loves cornbread, (and has eaten a lot of it in his lifetime) says it's the best he has ever eaten. I double the recipe and it makes a nice thick 9x13 pan. I even eat it leftover for breakfast with some butter.

Absolutely wonderful!  I've never made home-made cornbread before and it was a total hit.  Very moist and just slightly sweet.  Yummy!  I doubled this recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan and it turned out perfectly.  However, watch your oven because I took mine out at exactly 30 minutes and I probably could've taken it out a few minutes sooner.  Will definitely make again!

This was a great, easy-to-cook recipe. You'll have most of these ingredients at home-which is always a bonus for me. 

***Be sure to check early, because the estimated cook time (40 min)was longer than mine took. (25 min)***

A friend of mine noted that it might've been even better with real corn...

This recipe is fabulous! I made this for my new husband and he said it was better than his Grandma's (that's a *serious* compliment). It was perfectly moist...don't change a thing. I brought the leftovers into the office and it was a hit with everyone there, too.

I made a bunch of modifications but stuck to the core of the recipe, and both my husband and I LOVED this!  The two of us finished it off in about 24 hours, starting at dinner (to accompany a vegetarian crockpot chili), then breakfast & snacking.  Mmmmm!  Modifications: reduced butter (used 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup low-fat plain yogurt), reduced sugar (used 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white sugar), reduced salt (used less than 1/4 teaspoon), and substituted in some whole wheat flour (1/2 cup whole wheat & 1/2 cup white flour).  Thanks for the recipe!

this was amazing. I am usually not impressed by cornbread but this is sooo good. I made it last night and had some left over and have been snacking on it all day.  It is so moist. the only change I made was using 1/2 cup of sugar and I baked it in a cast iron skillet. just great!

This is SO GOOD!!  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9x13 pan for a family get-together.  I also cut the sugar in half, as suggested by other reviewers.  It was a huge hit - thank you for making me look like a better cook than I really am! :o)

This was amazing and i got reave reviews about it. I followed the recipe exactly. I think maybe next time i will add jalepenos and cheese. Very rich wonderful cornbread. I used a 9x13 pan and i think a thinner cornbread is better.

I thought I made good corn bread until I tried this.  This cornbread is DELICIOUS!  A half cup sugar resulted in cornbread that was plenty sweet without being too sweet.  I also added 1 teaspoon of vanilla.  Bake time in my oven which is very accurate was only 25 minutes.  The end result was a moist, flavorful, and addicting cornbread! Will definately make this again because my recipe is now in the trash!

These are really yummy!  I also used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup plain non fat yogurt.  Everyone loved them!

Really, really good!  I made this twice so far...the first time I accidentally used only 1/2 of the butter and it was still good, though not as tender.  It IS a little sweet; the second time I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  24-25 minutes was long enough in the oven. Very moist...it was GONE in four hours.

The best cornbread recipe EVER! And I thought I didn't like cornbread, until I made this one. I made it yesterday for Thanksgiving primarily for my parents (my Dad deemed this the best he's tasted), but my husband and I flipped over it as well. It was moist and just the right amount of sweetness. Thanks! Oh, I cooked it for exactly 30 minutes and it was perfectly done.

Really good recipe.  Great flavor & texture.  I made it twice & cut it back to one egg though.....It was probably just me but I thought I could taste the eggs in it cause I'm paranoid about too many eggs.  Sweet & golden & buttery, ( I poked holes & added more melted butter over the top after it was done).  Great homemade cornbread.

This recipe is everything the cook says it will be!
SWEET and MOIST. Those that are hating on the sweetness should read the recipe and move on to another if they are adverse to sugar in their cornbread. There is no need to waste time bashing a very fine recipe for what it is!
For those that enjoy the sweetness and the moist texture, make it and enjoy it.

This was Amazingly tasty and easy!  We had 2 different cornbreads and the other got thrown out (couldn't compete) and this one  went so fast this past weekend that there wasn't a photo opportunity.  Will be making again tonight for dinner because I'm totally craving it. No changes and substitutes needed. Perfect Recipe as written.

I made into muffins. I ended up baking them for about 17 min. I was out of cornmeal so I used polenta, and the texture came out a little odd. But the flavor was delicious, and not too sweet like I originally feared when I first read the recipe. Great recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I knew 2/3 cup sugar would be too sweet for my taste so I cut the sugar in half. Also I added one finely diced jalapeno pepper, plus diced red onion. Best cornbread I have ever made!

One of the best cornbread recipe I tried! Just remember to beat the eggs in quickly or temper the eggs - if you don't pay attention or are too slow about it, the eggs can cook in the heat :(

This cornbread was extremely moist and had excellent flavor.  My husband doesn't typically like cornbread b/c it has a tendency to be dry.  He LOVED this recipe!

I made this tonight and my family loved it. I just melted the butter in a glass mixing bowl in the microwave, then mixed everything in that. I used half cup whole wheat flour and half cup regular flour. We don't like our cornbread sweet so I only used 1/4 cup sugar. My son inhaled this bread!  It was pretty soft, even with the whole wheat.

I used about 1/4 cup of sugar rather than the 2/3 cup it called for and that made it sweet enough for me. I don't like cornbread that is too sweet or cake-like; I prefer a little more of a salty, cornmeal-y taste in the balance. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. My cornbread turned out just a little crumbly although really not too dry. It was good but I feel that I need to tweak the recipe some to suit my personal taste and expectations. Thanks for sharing your family's recipe, Bethany!

This recipe was really good and easy!  I made it just as the recipe was written (following the author's updates in her review).  Everyone loved it!

This recipe is simply yummy. I did make adjustments; I reduced the butter and used cream instead of buttermilk but still it is good. No more Boxed Jiffy for me.

This was an awesome recipe! Totally a 5 star! It was sweet without any syrup or honey on top. Although I melted the butter in the microwave and mixed all the ingredients into a large mixing bowl, multiplying the recipe by two, and baked it in a cupcake pan. It was great as cupcakes and easy for kids to make. Loved it!!!

I'm a Southern girl, this Yankee cornbread is excellent and easy!  I poured the batter into a hot greased cast iron skillet and baked for 32 minutes.  Yummy!

I was tired of bland crumbly cornbread so I tried this.  It was great.  I took it to a family gathering and it was loved by all and I was asked for the recipe.  I didn't have buttermilk so I put 1/8 cup of vinegar in measuring cup and filled the rest up with milk and let it set for a few minutes.  Worked great.

Excellent!  Like any recipe, you can tweak this one to taste (quit whining about how sweet it is and reduce the sugar . . .) but the base recipe is just right.  The end result, if you don't overcook it, is a moist crumb, medium density, delicious corn bread.  I served it with sliced avocado, poached eggs and potatoes O'Brien.  Comfort food at its best.  Next time I'll try adding cheddar and jalapeños, maybe some corn kernels.  Can't wait to experiment.  Thank you, Bethany's grandmom!

This Cornbread is the REAL DEAL. I left out the baking soda because it make the cornbread to white in the end. You want it to be buttery and have that cornmeal color as the finish product.
The buttermilk adds so much flavor, and after it's done spread some butter on the top for added flavor and shine, so delicious. My son loves this cornbread every time i make it.

Great and yummy!!! Kids are normally picky but they loved this and ate it all up! I usually cook like 5 minutes less than what recipes calls for so it does not dry out. I cover it in a container after it cools to retain moisture If we do not eat it right away! Store in a ziplock bag and can eat it all day long ??

I made it exactly as the recipe stated except I used margarine rather than butter. I love the one dish only. After reading the reviews I made sure to use a glass dish and to check at 30 minutes. It was super moist, not too sugary like some complained and had a nice light texture to it. A great recipe!

Far too sweet for my (northern) taste, but my husband LOVED it. I mixed and baked it a big cast iron skillet. Worked perfectly. Toasted a slice in butter on a griddle topped with a fried egg, a delish breakfast. I gave it an extra star because of my husband.

Omg! amazing and moist! Tip: I made everything in my La Creuset and then you literally only need 1 pan from start to finish. Start the butter and sugar stovetop and keep going until you are ready to pop in oven...bake 25 min and then pop a few slices of butter on top just because. Simply amazing and wonderful with chilli.

We love this cornbread!  My daughter even said, Why don't we make cornbread more often?  This really is easy and doesn't take that long. After making this one, I am asking the same question.  It is definitely a 5 star all alone. I did cute back to just a 1/2 cup of sugar as I don't like the sweet as some do.  It was just right.  As a side note, we've added a little cheese and some minced jalapenos and it is still good.  This is a keeper to do with what you will.

First of all, and in defense of Bethany, this is the way my Gran used to make it. Exactly. It was always wolfed-down by everyone who was privileged to eat it. My Pa would make it sans sugar. That's the way he liked it and no one else. 
Both were born and raised in the south as were generations before them. Bethany is right when it comes to variables such as what type of flour you use, length of time cooking and your oven. Any baker knows these variables and adjusts accordingly. For me, and I'm sure thousands of others, this recipe is delicious! You might even want to try it "one day old" and crumble it into a glass, add sweet milk to the top of the glass and enjoy. That's if any is ever left over!

Delicious.  You do not need to melt butter in a skillet.  Melt it in the microwave on a low cookmatic level in a large bowl and then add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl.  I do not like for my cornbread to be overly sweet, so I reduced the amount of sugar.

Ok I put mine in a cast iron skillet like another person suggested. I mixed everything in the cast iron skillet like directions say and then baked 25 mins. The best freaking cornbread I've ever eaten and or made.

I liked this recipe. I thought it would be a tid bit too sweet, but honestly, it is just the right amount of sweetness. I poured the mix in my cupcake pan and had 12 total. I bajed it for 20 minutes. I would not change anything on this recipe. It is good just as is. Now, I will try baking it in my cast iron pan with the suggestions posted by others. I will update on my results! Keeper, keeper!

I have tried many cornbread recipes, and this is the one my family likes the best so far. I always cut down on the sugar in recipes, so used 1/2 cup for this one. May cut it down further next time, but that's really due to our personal preference. Some of the reviews said this turned out dry, but I did not find that at all. In fact, I may even cut down on the butter a smidge next time. I did use regular flour (not whole wheat) and baked for just 30 minutes per the author's addendum.

BTW, I grew up in the South and enjoy the non-sweet cornbread there, but this cornbread recipe is still a keeper – indeed, the author does not claim that this is Southern cornbread. If you're going to flame a recipe for not being regionally correct, check your facts first.

Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

These were good.  Watch timing closely, as easy to dry out if over baked.

Grandma knows best! Especially when it comes to baking. Love this classic cornbread recipe. Used a 9x9 pan, so the pieces were a bit smaller. (I just decided to buy an 8x8 pan to use the next time I make this.) Flavor was sweet, and I like that. Texture was good. Quick and easy recipe. I'll make it again and again.

I was out of milk for my regular cornbread recipe, but had buttermilk. Ran across this one, decided to give it a try. This cornbread is SO good ! The only thing I did differently is my 2 tsp. baking powder was already added to the dry mixture, but added the baking soda too. Another thing I did; when the butter was fully melted in my Iron Skillet,  I poured it into batter, returning to Hot pan. This is the absolutely the best cornbread I've ever made, and here's my picture of it. Love it !

I made a double batch of this recipe to bake in 2 separate 8" pans. Before pouring into the pans, I tasted the batter and this is definitely a SWEET cornbread! I made a 3rd batch, omitting the sugar altogether, to stir into the double batch of batter I made. This, of course, cut down the sweetness. I divided the batter up into 3 pans, baked as directed & the bread came out moist with a crisp crust. I will use this recipe again, but will only use 1/4 cup to only 2 Tbls of sugar....just a personal preference.

I make it this way and also gluten free. To do gluten free I use 2 cups of corn meal and add 1 tsp baking soda and the 1 tsp baking powder so it rises. Sometimes I make it with salted butter and cut the salt to 1/4 tsp and it tastes even better with the salted butter. I love this recipe and have made it around 10 times or more. I have even added blueberries one time. You can make it with brown sugar too or honey.

I made this exactly by the recipe.  It was WONDERFUL!  I'm a southerner and my family LOVES good cornbread ....this recipe is not like my Grandmother made but it is DELICIOUS!  It's sweet, has a nice crust and, should you have any leftover, it reheats nicely.

Really excellent.  By far the best I've ever had homemade, and probably ever.  Moist, great crumb, good level of sweetness, formed a great crust.

I have a wheat allergy, so I swapped gluten-free flour for the all-purpose flour.  EVERYONE LOVED IT!  It is the best cornbread I've ever made.

I have tried other cornbread recipes and been disappointed.  I was not disappointed with this recipe.  I used the exact ingredients and followed the recipe exactly (Although, I forgot to set my timer right away, I'm not exactly sure how long I baked this for, but it was closer to 32 minutes than the 40) and it turned out perfect.  It was simple and the cleanup was easy. The taste was very close to the fresh cornbread products I'm used to from good bakeries, etc. and the density and moisture were perfect. My family truly enjoyed this recipe and is asking for it with chili. I don't feel this is sweet, but I will try maybe what folks are calling "a true southern recipe" for cornbread and see if I notice a difference.

Great!  Just needed to be in the oven for about 20 mins and it was done.  I don't like my breads and cakes brown or dried out so like to take them out asap.  Thank you for posting this!

Probably the best cornbread ever.  Don't over cook it!  In my oven a toothpick comes out clean in 25 minutes.  No need to bother with melting butter in the pan and making the batter there.  I go with the traditional baking method of pre-mixed dry ingredients going into the wet ingredients, making the butter that way by melting it in the microwave.

This is exactly what I expected a traditional cornbread to be. I like mine sweeter, which this recipe delivered. Followed recipe to the letter, except for using 2 T vinegar to sour my milk since I didn't have buttermilk. Served along Southern Fried Cabbage, also from this site, which is a great pairing! I will definitely make this cornbread again.

Made this exact for the family once and we all wished there had been more! It's perfect! I always make my cornbread in a cast iron skillet that I preheat with the oven. Then poor the batter straight into the hot skillet! It gives a slight crispness to the outer edge! So yum! And who doesn't love baking in a cast iron! I do like to play, but I didn't change the base of the recipe cause it's perfect! So I've made it several times more adding 3/4-1 cup fresh corn. And another variation was adding diced red pepper and green chilies for a Mexican flare! Love all of it! Great recipe!!!

I cooked this in a square Pyrex bowl and reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup since i prefer my cornbread less sweet.  Any extra butter on the sides of the bread, I brushed over the top when it was done.  Delicious!

This is my absolute go to recipe. I like to make it in a cast iron skillet. I place the pan in the oven while it preheats along with the stick of butter until the butter melts then I follow the directions as written. The bake time in the preheated skillet results in a 25-30 minute cook time and a light bread with a crispy, buttery bottom.

So delicious... For a treat! I'll need to play around with the recipe to reduce the guilt factor, but this is definitely delicious. I used 1 cup self rising corn meal so I reduced the baking soda and salt by half; I also used white wheat flour and 2% milk because that is what I had. Beautiful rise, texture and color! Only baked for 30 minutes in a 9x9 pan.

This is my "go to" cornbread for nearly every family gathering.  My husband smokes a lot of meat (ribs, pulled pork, chicken) and this recipe, along with the sweet restaurant coleslaw round out the menu perfectly.  Its a nice moist bread that is easily adjusted for the amount of sweetness you want or don't want.  I always make extra & we rarely have any left over.

I normally don't like cornbread, but this recipe was fantastic!  I made it with half whole wheat flour and half all purpose, and the texture and density was superb.  I also did all the mixing and baking in just one cast iron skillet.  My cornbread was done in about 25 minutes.  I also added a honey and butter glaze once it was done.  This will definitely be my main cornbread dish from now on!

My husband absolutely raves about this recipe, especially when I cook it in our cast iron pan. Such a lovely, crunchy crust it makes. The only thing I do differently is to mix it in a bowl first, but what's one bowl compared to this lovely result? Yum!

God bless you for sharing this recipe.  I'm a southern cook and a pretty darn good one if I might add.  I know my way around a kitchen, and so does your grandmother.  This is hands down the best cornbread that I've ever eaten.  It actually rivals the cornbread that I've had in restaurants.  The only adjustment that I made was that I cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup.  That was just the right amount of sweetness for me.  Delicious!!!!!

I loved the recipe! My mom never quite had measurements down, but we definitely make "southern cornbread" this way. My fiancé is very picky and if it doesn't taste like his mom's he doesn't like it. He said it was better. He doesn't know I had a little cheat sheet. Thanks.

This was insanely yummy and moist. I mixed the whole thing on the stove in the baking pan over a low flame and added half a can of creamed corn. I then baked as instructed. Delicious!

Just added this to my faves!! Added one can of drained corn and about 1/3C of light Mexican cheese blend. Also, decreased the sugar to 1/4C (mom doesn't care for sweet cornbread).

Great as-is, but I've also made it simply with 1 cup Bisquick mix, 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup sugar, 1/4 cup butter, 1 cup milk, 2 eggs.  Winner winner cornbread and chicken dinner!! :)

The first cornbread that I remember, and the one that has held the standard in my mind, was from Mothers Kitchen in Chatham, N.J. in (about) 1963. I have been a lifelong cornbread lover, but ever in search of the standard set by "Mothers" so many years ago. Well, I can sleep soundly tonight because I have found it, and it is here! I do plan on trying some tweak recipes on it, such as using whole wheat flour, but if it does not pan out I will not be disappointed because, in my most humble opinion, this is the best cornbread recipe ever!

I made this w/ some modifications.
I only used 1/2c of sugar, and used 1/2c sour cream w/ 1/2 of raw milk instead of buttermilk since I didn't have any.
Everything else was kept the same. I also just melted the butter in the microwave. 
This was absolutely delicious though. I think w/ the full amount of sugar, it would've been WAY too sweet for our liking. Even with the 1/2 it was still sweet, but just the right amount and the way we like it.
The texture was awesome. Very airy and cakey. This is definitely a keeper.

Since I had split pea soup going in the crock pot for dinner tonight, I was thinking about how good cornbread bread would be with it, so as soon as I got home from work, I searched for a moist cornbread recipe and found this one.   Didn't have any buttermilk, so I used half sour cream & half milk.  I also cut the sugar down a little and added hunks of cheese to it.  I loved it!  Good recipe!  I do not care for dry cornbread and this was nice & moist.  Thanks, Bethany!

I made this in a bowl instead of the skillet, but with the same order and process. Bethanyweathersby states in her description that this is a sweet cornbread...I am shocked at the negative reviews stating the obvious- that it's sweet. With fresh cornmeal and fresh flour, this turned out better than I could have hoped! This is my new go-to cornbread recipe. Absolutely perfect. Thanks!

I stopped making cornbread years ago and seldom get it in a restaurant.  It's always been dry as sawdust.  This however is absolutely delicious; it's changed my mind at least about a cornbread I can make.  This is moist and very flavorful.  My husband and son loved it.  I highly recommend trying this.  To those who say it's not a southern cornbread.....don't make it.

I live in France, and couldn't find corn meal anywhere! Since the word for corn meal is "semoule de mais" and the word for semolina is "semoule", I did an experiment batch with just plain semolina. Technically, they aren't substitutes because one is made from wheat, and the other from corn, but just sayin', I did it using large grain semolina. And it was delicious. And tasted almost exactly the same. Also, my french friends thought it was amazing and were really impressed. I didn't tell them that it was just dumb luck :) I made a few small changes to make the consistency right, but it was darn good. Thanks for the recipe, we loved it.

Amazingly delicious cornbread! My kids raved about it...that means a lot! Making it 2 nights in a row for dinner and saving the recipe in my real life recipe box. Definitely going to be a regular recipe for weekly dinners. The only change I made was I added an extra 1/3 cup sugar, my family likes their cornbread sweet and it has been hard to find a decent sweet cornbread recipe. Kudos!

Mmmm...the best cornbread I ever made. Perfect density and an excellent excuse to eat lots of butter. I made a mexican version by adding finely chpped hot peppers and cheddar cheese on top. I would have added a photo but it didn't last that long!

I Used skim milk to make my own buttermilk with vinegar, used half barley flour, and cooked in an oiled hot skillet to form nice crust. It came out wonderful and moist, not crumbly. I will probably use less sugar next time though.

Only made one slight change (sour cream for buttermilk) because I didn't have buttermilk, but had a HUGE container of sour cream that I needed to start using. With that one substitution, & everything else done as written, this was a delicious & easy cornbread recipe. Other recipes have been too sweet, too gritty, not sweet enough, or just too dry - this is just about as perfect as homemade cornbread gets!! Paired great with homemade navy bean & ham soup on a cold Montana evening :)

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever had. I

did the muffins at 375 for 20 minutes. I will be making again.

It's a great recipe, just a little too sweet for my tastes. Everything else about it is wonderful--it's not cakey. It has the perfect amount of coarseness and the perfect amount of moisture. Next time I'll probably just reduce the sugar a little bit. Update: I made it again and I didn't have enough butter so I used half butter and half olive oil (less a tablespoon)--in other words 4 tbsp butter/3 tbsp olive oil. Turned out perfectly and maybe even better. Also, be careful. If your pan is too hot after melting the butter, your egg will start to cook a little bit. This happened to me the 2nd time around because I was careless and there were some pretty solid pieces of egg white. I cooked it anyway and it was fine, but I could see a few pieces here and there in the finished product. Didn't affect the taste at all, though. Wonderful recipe.

This is delicious and easy! It is very moist, not as crumbly and dry as the boxed mixes.

Absolutely delicious!  After reading some reviews I baked it in a greased preheated cast iron fry pan. It needed the 30 minutes, but I lowered the temperature to 325 for the last 10 minutes, as it was getting dry on the edges, but still wet in the centre. A great recipe which will certainly become a regular.

After making this cornbread numerous times, I decided to give it five stars.  Everyone in my family, my friends and neighbors all agree that it's the best they've tried outside of a restaurant.  My father in law asked me to give it to his wife!

No tweaks, no changes, no substitutions.  I do cook the bread in a metal pan, and I've had equally good results using a pre-heated cast iron skillet and a metal cake pan - both greased.  This gives it a nice crust on the bottom.

Best Gluten Free cornbread I've ever made!!
I changed the "all-purpose flour" with 'Namaste Gluten Free Perfect flour blend' and made sure cornmeal was GF- otherwise followed directions exactly. We've tried many GF cornbread recipes, and by swapping the flour in this one, by far it's the best! We all loved it, including my non-GF teen who said I should make this every week!So moist & fluffy it was amazing- anyone who cooks GF knows getting anything 'fluffy' is difficult -all others I have made were very dense.

I'm not always overly dramatic about food (lie, yes I am) but I died and went to heaven. Perfection! I will use this recipe often for the rest of my life and, when I'm gone from this world, my kids and grandkids will make this recipe and good memories of being young and holiday dinners and Grammy's homemade cornbread (because I'm totally taking credit for this recipe in my family) will come flooding back to them. Thank you so much for sharing!

I quadrupled this recipe for a chili cook-off today at work and it worked FANTASTIC.  Instead of bothering with a pan, I used a regular size muffin pan with paper liners.  I took the advice of another reviewer and filled a gallon-sized zip-lock bag with the batter and cut off a small section of one of the corners--easiest way to fill the muffin tin, BY FAR.   This quadrupled recipe yielded me approximately 60 individual servings.  I baked as directed, at 375 degrees for 20 minutes and they came out PERFECT.  This will be my go-to cornbread recipe from now on.

Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup (for doubled recipe) pretty dense, but nice and moist and corn-y.  Might be even better with buttermilk (I used milk+vinegar).

GREAT RECIPE!!!!
I've made this twice so far. The first time with baking powder and the second time with baking soda. This was an accident but I really prefer the baking powder than baking soda. Also I tried adjusting the sugar. The sweetness made it more cake like which my husband really loved. But overall, I really enjoyed this recipe. I've made cornbread from scratch before and it was not successful. The first time I tried it the texture and consistency was great and it reminded me of Jiffy Cornbread mix. Jiffy Cornbread comes to mind because it was a brand that my mother used all the time as a child. The second batch I used the baking soda and it changed the taste to me. So I will stick with the baking powder. I would highly recommend this recipe!!!!

I love this recipe.  It is just how you'd expect Grandma's cornbread to be.
I didn't have butter milk so I added the juice of one lemon to the cup of milk and allowed to sit for 10 minutes. As well just a little less sugar. It was de-lic-ious!!!!
Thanks for sharing -BETHANYWEATHERSBY

PERFECT CORNBREAD
Tried multiple recipes...then came across this one. Moist, holds together well, full flavored. 
The only change I made was cutting the sugar to 1/2 cup. Perfectly sweet..though I think the original 2/3 cup would be just as good. Will be serving with Chili for a HUGE CROWD this week. My search for the perfect cornbread is over! Good with and without butter.
Husband and son agree...This is IT!!!
THANK YOU SO MUCH

Excellent recipe. Have made it several times and will make it again for Thanksgiving. To Kay and others, this is not a recipe for Southern cornbread. There is definitely a difference in Northern vs Southern cornbreads and this recipe is a home run for Northern style.

LOVE IT!! This cornbread recipe is sooo addictive, I've already made to twice this week! As another viewer said, I reduced the sugar a tad bit and  I also used half 2% milk and half butter milk and has a really nice ( I find that the full about of butter milk give it a slight sour taste). Last, if you are experiencing dryness it possibly might be due over cooking -- the recipie states to bake it for 30-40 min, however mine were ready in 20 minutes so PLEASE set you oven timer for 20 min and then test with a tooth pick, if after 20 kin it comes out clean then it's done and you can just skip out on the extra time.

Wonderful recipe. My husband is from the south and loves a "good southern cornbread". I bake this in my iron skillet and decreased the sugar to less than 1/4 a cup. It is wonderful. It is also the main ingredient in my Thanksgiving cornbread dressing recipe which is always a hit!

This is so great! So moist, full of flavor and just the right sweetness. I have to admit that I have always used the Jiffy mix, because I always liked the taste and it was so easy to make. I thought it would be too time consuming to make my own and I was sure the taste would be lacking. My husband just loves cornbread and I finally got brave enough to make it from scratch. I came to this site (my main go to) and found this recipe with all of the great reviews and decided I would give it a try to go with my homemade chili. I have to confess that I bought 2 boxes of the Jiffy mix in case it did not come out right.  My husband loved it. He ate almost the whole pan by himself and kept talking about it for days. I have now made this 5 times and I am making it again today to go with my beans and ham hocks. It always turns out fantastic and the flavor is consistent every time! The first time I made it with fresh Buttermilk,  but since we don't ever really use it,  the rest of the carton went to waste. When I went to make it the second time, I bought Sa Co brand cultured buttermilk mix. You just mix it with water to use as a substitute for buttermilk in any recipe.The end result was exactly the same as using the fresh buttermilk. I keep this around all the time now,  so I can make this cornbread any time and no more wasted buttermilk. Besides this, I have made the recipe exactly as written every time as there is no need to change a thing, in my opinion. Thank you Bethanyweathersby fo

I have used no other recipe for cornbread since finding this one.  I've tinkered with it a bit and have arrived at my "forever" cornbread recipe.  I melt the butter in a 10-inch cast iron skillet, which I then use to sauté 1 good-sized jalapeno (cored and diced) and 1 medium shallot (diced); skillet comes off the heat, and I add the remaining ingredients directly to the skillet, mixing carefully with a large wire whisk; bake in skillet (I set timer for 30 minutes, and it's perfect every time.)  Recommend mixing flour and cornmeal together in a bowl before starting (I throw in salt too, to ensure even distribution in mixture) -- doing this allows me to pour all the dry ingredients in at one time (no flour cloud) and speeds up mixing time.  I did this one time with finally ground cheese, but it scorched a bit around the edges/bottom where cheese touched the skillet (husband still enjoyed).  Also tried with garlic -- it was good, but garlic interfered with the "green" (but surprisingly, not hot) flavor of the jalapeno, in my opinion, which is my favorite part of this recipe.  Used food processor instead of dicing jalapeno by hand once (and only once), result was that the flavor of the jalapeno was more evenly dispersed (not bad, necessarily), but the cornbread was green (uhh, no); I've stuck with hand-dicing ever since.

Amazing!  Best cornbread I have ever eaten.  I only changed 2 things.  I used multi-grain flour and organic cane sugar.  I was given a 50 pound bag of white cornmeal, and I was looking for recipes to use it up.  This is by far the best one!  This will now be a staple in our home.

This is the only cornbread recipe I ever use anymore.  I've made it several times.  Try adding a sprinkle of cheddar cheese and/or chopped green chilis for a mexican twist.  The bread always comes out moist and just a little bit sweet. It's a perfect recipe!

I quad-rupled this recipe in order to make 36 servings for a mexican themed party.  

I made it in an extra large pan and increased the baking time to nearly 50 minutes - as it appeared to be done with a firm middle.  Ends up, the middle was too moist and was slightly underdone so I would recommend baking it in smaller pans when making a larger quantity.
Otherwise the recipe was great. I prepared it exactly as the instructions dictated and it was moist and not overly sweet. The adults and kids both loved it.

This was a good cornbread.  We enjoyed it very much. I followed the directions exactly.  I really saved on dishes, though; instead of pouring the batter into a pan I simply baked it in my cast-iron skillet.  Worked beautifully!

This is an excellent cornbread recipe if you like sweet cornbread.  My husband, who ALWAYS puts honey on his cornbread, skipped it with this recipe because he thought it was great the way it was.

Excellent-didn't have buttermilk, so used 2 tablespoons lemon juice in the cup of milk. Followed the recipe exactly and cooked it in a muffin pan for approximately 20-25 minutes. They aren't really big, just a nice size to go with the ground beef stroganoff submitted on this site by Linda Russell. Yum!!

I've been struggling with cornbread for years.  This recipe is awesome but I did sub canola oil for butter.  It's two days later and the bread is still moist.  I started looking for a recipe like this after receiving horribly dry and crumbly cornbread in a restaurant. Thanks so much for this recipe.

This was absolutely the most fabulous cornbread I've ever had, whether from a home chef or restaurant!  It was moist, sweet, delicious, and had a fabulous texture and crumb.  I doubled the servings, then followed the recipe exactly.  I did not add or omit any ingredients, and I used buttermilk, as the recipe states.  I baked the cornbread in a large glass casserole baking dish for exactly 30 minutes.  It was perfectly baked and had a wonderfully golden crust on the bottom.  If you want the best in the world cornbread, use this recipe.  You'll get raves as I did.  Thank you so much for this awesome cornbread, Bethany.

OMG   My husband always likes the Jiffy sweet cornbread.   I dont I like no sugar in mine.    I didnt have any Jiffy so I tried this recipe and wow,   I will never make Jiffy again.

This is wonderful, and as someone who always screws up cornbread, this recipe has proven itself infallible. Two things.  I use fake out buttermilk (combine vinegar with milk) and I let the "buttermilk" and cornmeal "soak" for about five minutes before mixing everything together.  It hasn't failed me yet!

This is soo much better than Fannie Farmer's! (shh)  Thank you Bethany.  I used oil instead of butter.  I used water and added a powdered buttermilk blend culture (for the buttermilk) and a spot of vanilla extract. (Always looking for a way to cut fat/cholesterol)
Baked in a smaller pyrex dish and it took about 45 mins to bake.  
What a delight for breakfast this morning.

I love this recipe and I am a true southerner. I follow the recipe exactly except I put bacon fat in a iron skillet and heat in the oven til very hot, then pour the batter in and bake about 25 minutes. This is the best recipe I have ever had for cornbread. We have it atleast twice a week. Thank you for this awesome recipe.

I was looking for a true New England style cornbread and this is it. I was raised on southern cornbread and but when I moved to Boston , I found they make cornbread a little sweeter and not as crumbly up here. I usually drench my cornbread with honey but this doesn't need it at all . Thanks it's a s good as any I've had in Boston.

This is an amazing recipe! It blew my southern mother-in-law and grandmother-in-law right out of their socks! Thanks for this! (followed the recipe to a T, by the way, except baked it in an 11x7 rectangle dish as I don't have an 8x8 and it still turned out fabulous!!).

Four stars as-is. Five with half the sugar. Cooked in a preheated, oiled cast iron skillet for a crunchy crust. YUM.

I was so skeptical about this recipe. I was unhappy with the family recipe I had been using for more than 30 years. It was unpredictable and usually came out way too crumbly and not much flavor even though it was a buttermilk recipe. After reading the rave reviews, I had to try it and I'm so glad I did. This is now my new 'go-to' recipe. Like others, I did cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup and will probably cut it back to a 'scant' 1/2 cup next time but other than that, it's perfect! Thanks to Bethany for sharing!!

I really love this recipe. Having tasted other family members' cornbread, I was afraid to try it myself since I didn't like theirs. But my daughter and husband insisted. So I came upon this one. I love it. I make it as is. No changes. I use a cast iron skillet to melt the butter and mix sugar in on the stove, then add everything else and bake it in the skillet. Tastes fabulous. Done in 30 minutes every time. Tastes phenominal every time. I am a bit un-PC and occasionally use bacon grease, lard, ect for some of the butter. Tastes great. I am normally a very healthy eater and save my splurges for certain things like this ;)

5 stars just doesn't seem like enough to me. We LOVE this cornbread! I really can't stress enough how yummy it is. I have made this many many times yet for some reason haven't reviewed it yet. The only problem I see with this recipe is that one batch is just not enough. I always double it. I have tried it with the addition of shallots peppers corn cheese but 9 times out of 10 I just make it as written. If you are going to add veggies just saute in the butter in step 1. Also I always put my cast iron skillet in the oven while I'm preheating when the batter is ready pull the skillet out butter it a bit add batter and bake. You will not be disappointed.

Very moist and tasty.  Good on its own, with chili, beef stew, etc.  Used only 1/2 cup of white sugar and added one small can of chopped green chilies.  Thanks, Bethany, for a delicious recipe.

Converted beautifully to gluten free using 1/2 c brown rice flour and 1/2 c gluten-free flour in place of the 1 c regular flour.  Also cut sugar to 1/2 c.

This is probably the best cornbread I have had and I have made. Very consistent each time I've made it. Definitely use the buttermilk or if you don't have any put 1tbsp of white vinegar or lemon juice into a measuring cup add milk to make 1 cup let sit for 5 minutes and your good to go. The buttermilk makes all the difference in the texture. Watch the time on it. Best when it is not overcooked. I don't think I've ever made a batch where there was any left.

This converts well to a gluten free version. I followed the recipe as written but substituted 1 cup of a gluten free flour mixture for the 1 cup of regular flour.  The results are outstanding.  Note:  if you are converting this to gluten free your outcome may depend on the type of GF flour blend you are using.  I used Cup4Cup brand from Williams Sonoma (which contains dairy).  I also found myself without buttermilk on one occasion - I substituted regular 2% milk mixed with 1 Tbsp of lemon juice and the outcome was great.  So far this seems like a fool proof recipe and has become a "go to" standard in our home.  Thanks for sharing this with the community!

This was the first cornbread recipe I've tried and I loved it, sweet and cake like in texture.  I'd love to give it 5 stars but I decided to cut the sugar down to 1/3c after reading other reviews, and I'm so glad I did because it was still sweet, 2/3c would have been way over the top.  I also preheated the tin and it baked nicely in 25 minutes.  This is one of my go to quick recipes now.

We really liked this recipe and we've tried a lot of cornbread recipes. I did change the dry ingredients slighty (1 1/4 c. cornmeal, 1/4 c. all purpose flour, 1/2 c. whole wheat flour). I also substituted applesauce for half of the butter. Came out perfect at 30 minutes. Overall it was delicious.

This recipe is quite sweet but very good! I made it in a muffin pan and it only took around 15 minutes to cook (on 375 degrees). This cornbread is very moist.

I loved this delicious cornbread; perfect for breakfast.  I also love the one-pan technique and have finally found a use for the Magnalite Professional wok that came with my husband!  The bread is plenty moist, quite sweet and not at all greasy.  I like to toast it in a skillet and serve it with tart preserves, or if I really want sugar, with maple syrup.  I had to use reconstituted condensed milk and vinegar because it was 6 am and I had no buttermilk, but it still came out great. I also used medium grind cornmeal which gave it a nice crunch.  I'm going try it with less sugar for a savory accompaniment for barbecued chicken or ribs. Yummilicious and foolproof!

Excellent sweet cornbread. I fake the buttermilk with regular milk and a splash of vinegar, then let it sour for 5 minutes before using.

I love this recipe. I did not find it to sweet at all and I am not one for sweets. I did add a can of creamed corn, increased the corn meal to one and a quarter cup, and cooked it on 350 based on what many of the other reviewers said. It came out AMAZING! Mine took almost the full 40 minutes because of the extra moisture from the creamed corn. This is a keeper :) Enjoy!

This was my first time making Cornbread.  And to be completely truthful, my first time ever tasting cornbread...so I really didn't have anything to compare this too.  I followed the directions to the letter.  It came out nice and moist...and sweet (which I like because I do have a sweet tooth).  I served this as a side to Boston Baked Beans and really enjoyed it... so did my guests.  The recipe was very simple and easy to do.  I will keep this recipe and make it again.

Best cornbread we've ever eaten!  I make this all of the time, it goes great with chili of course and I like it with a turkey dinner.  I don't change a thing about the recipe, it's perfect as is.  A moist, sweet and filling cornbread.

I took the advice of the other reviewers and cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup. I used my new brownie pan--the kind with 12 individual squares--and baked for 20 minutes. this is a delicious, perfectly sweet corn bread. does not fall apart, which is one of my biggest complaints. it is a good way to use up the leftover buttermilk i always have after making buttermilk ranch dressing. Love this. highly recommend

I made this recipe using almond milk in place of the buttermilk. I convection baked in my toaster oven at 375 degrees for 23-26 minutes using the square pan. The cornbread was fabulous--dense, sweet and moist.

I will be the first one to comment on how I feel it's unfair reviewers tweak recipes on the first go around.  Today, I had to eat my cornbread words.  I had a taste for cornbread, this recipe sounded delicious, and I had to MacGyver what ingredients I had on hand to make it.  I had no milk so I used powdered skim milk, added vinegar, had no butter, used butter flavored crisco, and made muffins.  Beleive it or not, they turned out pretty good.  I will cut down on the sugar next time AND make sure I have all the required ingredients.  My fault for only giving it a 4 star score.  I'm sure it will rate a 5+ star score next time.  Thanks for sharing.  It's my new go to.

Fabulous!!!! I made this last night to go with a chili I just whipped together at the last minute and it was the best cornbread I ever made.  I loved how sweet it was - perfect foil for the spicy chili.  Threw in a handful of drained corn niblets left from the chili and swirled them through for a bit if crunch.  MMMMMM

This is the first time I have made corn bread and I thought this recipe was great!  It was simple, yet tasty. Mine came out a little flat though. I think it is because it called for an 8" square pan and I only had a 10" square pan, so next time i will just double the recipe.

So good!  Perfect cornbread!  I know that cornbread has a lot of variations and styles but this was perfect for me.  I was a bit confused by the directions.  I did also read the submitter's review and clarification.  I ended up just melting the butter in the micro and mixing the butter and sugar in a bowl, then going from there.  I made 18 corn muffins but 12 probably would have been better:  mine are a bit small.  I started with 12 but the muffin cups were so full I thought they might run over so I made another 6.  This recipe is a keeper!  I made it to go with Slow Cooker Green Beans, Ham, and Potatoes.

This is amazing, the only recipe for cornbread I am ever going to use again.  I make it exactly as written.  Mine was done in 30 minutes.

Made this for an Easter BBQ.  Looked all over for full fat buttermilk but all I could find was lowfat buttermilk.  Still turned out awesome.  Doubled the recipe and there were no left overs. Multiple people told me it was the best cornbread they ever had.  Also got multiple recipe requests.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

My family loves cornbread and this is a wonderful recipe. I mixed everything in the same pan then poured it in the baking dish. I used the powdered bakers buttermilk and also used Bread Flour instead of All Purpose. I baked it for 35 minutes and it was PERFECT!!! Had a beautiful golden color, and a great rise in the 9 in round pie dish I used. I will be sharing this with all of my family and friends. Thank You for sharing BETHANYWEATHERSY!!!!!

This is probably the best cornbread I've ever had. It was moist and delicious. While I followed the ingredients exactly, I altered the process just slightly. I mixed everything in one large bowl (first wet, then dry ingredients) while my skillet and the oven were preheating. When the oven came to temperature, I put a little bit of melted butter into the skillet, then poured in the batter. The cornbread had a delicious crust as a result. One very minor note of caution--while my crust was golden, it didn't look, initially, as if the cornbread was done. A simple toothpick test at 25 minutes, however, assured me that it was cooked through. The resulting cornbread was light and sweet and I will be making it again (and again and again).

When I read that this cornbread was prepared in a skillet and that eggs were added to the melted butter and sugar combo I was doubtful. But, I did it anyway and was I glad. What a delicious cornbread! A big hit at the dinner table. Next time I'll cut the sugar down a little because this was a little like a dessert. That would be my only change. Bravo and thanks for a great recipe for my Dad's favorite addition to Red Beans and Rice!

Delicious! The only alteration I made was the one that the author told us to- I switched half a cup of the white flour for whole wheat (ie. I used 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup whole wheat) and you'd NEVER know! :)

Followed the recipe as is and thought it was a bit bland and not as moist as I'd have liked. This recipe wasn't the worst, but I don't think I'll be revisiting it.

My first attempt at cornbread and this was PERFECT! The same consistency as my mom's and grandma's but sweeter; although not TOO sweet. It was thick and SCRUMPTIOUS. Put butter on top and served it with some chili. My husband keeps asking me when I'm going to make it again! I melted the butter in the microwave using a pyrex measuring cup, added the sugar and egg to it and then poured it in a bowl and mixed  the dry ingredients with it that way. Great recipe! Thanks! :)

This is the best homemade cornbread I have ever had.  The first time i made it i forgot to add the sugar and it was still delicious.  The only thing i do differently is to add about half a can of corn to it just because I do that to any cornbread recipe.   This is my go to cornbread recipe from now on!!!

My family LOVES this cornbread! I used less sugar the 2nd time I made it but every single one of them noticed and wanted it exactly like the recipe calls for. I don't make it often because of the not so healthy factor but it is one of our fav recipes over all. Thanks for sharing Bethany!

This was a huge hit.  I added a chopped jalepeno as well (seeds removed).  I've also made this with Splenda instead of sugar and it still tastes great.

I made this twice this week. The first time I made it, the entire pan was gone within an hour. The second batch lasted through two meals. Everyone loves this. First time, I did not have enough sugar, so I only used half, and it came out great. The second time I used the full amount, and, honestly, I can't tell much of a difference. I think it was great both way. Amazing with honey butter. Bakes up with a great crust even without a cast iron skillet. This one is a keeper!

i had never made cornbread outside of the usual jiff box mix. this was so so simple. literally took maybe 10 minutes before it went in the oven. i used the liquid buttermilk and followed the directions exactly. my boyfriend and i both absolutely loved it! best part is it's still nice and moist the next day. this will definitely be made again soon!

Delicious.  I cut back on the sugar a bit (scant 1/2 c instead of 2/3 c) and have occasionally made this with only one egg if I happen to only have one on hand.  Wonderful... I make this one again and again.  Thanks for posting!

I eat gluten free and used Cup4cup flour in place of wheat flour. The result was outstanding! This is one of the best cornbreads I've baked in a long time. It's now my go-to cornbread recipe. Yum!

Great cornbread! My only changes were to use 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup + 2tbsp honey, and add corn kernels. It was soooo good!

Very very good. The best I've had so far. I scaled recipe for 14, and it fit a 9x13 perfectly. Followed ingredient list exactly, but melted butter in microwave and put liquid ingredients (+sugar) in mixer and mixed. Then mixed remaining dry ingredients in separate bowl and mixed until just moistened. Baked exactly 30 minutes, just right. Edges a little brown, but that's it. Thank you very much for this recipe!

This is the best cornbread I have ever had.  The second time I made it I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and added about 2 tablespoons of honey.  This made it a bit less sweet but added a hint of honey flavor.  The original recipe was more like corn cake than cornbread!  This is so good that we never put any butter on it when we ate it.  It is perfect all by itself.

As is, this is a great recipe.  One day & went to make it & we were all out of white sugar.  So I used a cup of brown sugar as a substitute.  Been using Brown Sugar ever since.

I thought this recipe was delicious. In fact I like it better than the cornbread recipe I started using from ths site about a year ago. I made this recipe twice once exactly as written which was fabulous and then the second time around I used regular whole milk because that is what I had and I added a dash of nutmeg because that is what I like :). I melted the butter in my cast iron skillet and then poured in the mixture. I mixed ingredients and poured back into cast iron skillet to bake. It took a total of 15 minutes in the oven.

I'll give it 5 stars, because the family loved it.  But I would consider this to be corn cake, not corn bread. I used whole grain, coarse grind corn meal (Bob's Red Mill stone ground). Next time, I will decrease the sugar to 1/4 cup, and use oil, not butter.  It rather clashed with the spicy chili, I must say... I agree with another review that this bakes in less time than the recipe instructions state.  When my toothpick tested clean at 15 minutes, I was glad I hadn't waited longer to check on the cornbread.  I used a preheated cast iron skillet.  Maybe that's why it baked in less time.  The key for me was noticing that at 12 minutes it was showing toasty-brown color on top, and the edges were pulled away and clear of the skillet, indicating that it was done.

Delicious! I followed the instructions exactly and it turned out perfectly. It is a tad sweeter than what I grew up on, but you can always cut back the sugar or use whole wheat flour. My favorite aspect of this recipe is that the bread does not crumble when you eat it, like some other cornbread recipes. We usually eat this with my slow cooker creamy chicken so it can soak up all that delicious sauce...YUM!

The best cornbread recipe I've ever made.  Followed the recipe - no substitutions.  Liked that it was light in texture, sweet, and mild tang (buttermilk).  Yummy.

THANK YOU!!! My Granny used to make "corn-pone" (that's what she called it) with the same ingredients... I could just never quite get the grasp of a handful of this and using a coffee cup to measure the liquids... She's gone now, but now I can make corn pone like she used to! This stuff is delicious!

Made this at least 5X before rating.  It's perfect as written but have added 1 c. frozen corn & sm. can chopped green chilies to bump it up at my house & kept everything else the same.  Don't skip the butter.  It's THE ingredient.

Absolutely awesome as-is!  This Southern girl has a new cornbread recipe (sorry, Grandma).  I had to made my own buttermilk substitute (1 T lemon juice to 1 cup milk, let sit for 5 mins) the first time around, and that worked great.  I did not use the make-in-pan approach b/c I was making mini-muffins.  Instead, I tossed everything into my stand mixer (eggs first, then cooled melted butter and sugar, etc.), and what a breeze.  Big hit with my 1-year-old too!  Stop researching cornbread recipes; this one is it.

This was so good.  i doubled the recipe and used white vinegar and milk instead of buttermilk.  Other than that I didn't change anything.  I will save this and make again for sure.  Way to go Grandmom!

Love it!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  I am always on the hunt for a good cornbread recipe and this is it.  I made it exactly as instructed and it turned out wonderful.  I agree with one of the reviews that it is the perfect level of sweetness.  Not too sweet, not too dry.  I, too, am a cornbread snob and agree with another reviewer in that cornbread should be baked in an iron skillet.  Which I did and it made this recipe all the more better.

This cornbread is fantastic!  Don't change the recipe, don't change a thing.  It is dense, moist, and just flat-out awesome!  Good with barbecue, chili, soul food, and a great complement to coffee in the morning.  I made it for Christmas and my family loved it.

I will never use a pre-mixed cornbread again! This recipe is a huge hit with everyone! I made it in a cast iron skillet, which made the edges a little crispy.  YUM!  Definitely a keeper!

AMAZING!!!  I baked for 30 min, and it came out perfect.  So delicious!  I paired this with New Year Black Eyed Peas & Italian-Style Swiss Chard (both also found on allrecipes), and it was wonderful!  Will be making this again!  No changes to the recipe whatsoever.  it was perfect!  Thank you so much for sharing this!

This cornbread is awesome.  In terms of personal preference I changed a couple things:  I like my cornbread to be a little more "corn-mealy" so I added 1 1/2 cup of cornmeal to 1/2 cup flour.  Also, adding fresh (or frozen) corn is an awesome addition (about a 1/2 to 2/3 cups, depending on personal preference).  Really, truly awesome results:  it was devoured and my guests (some of whom claim to dislike cornbread) had seconds.

The Best cornbread I have ever encountered!  Everybody I have try this Loves it.  I have found however that in an 8 X 8 glass dish, it takes 45 minutes @375 (maybe my oven is off).

I think I might have died and gone to food heaven. For 20 years now, I've been making cornbread by the recipe on the back of the cornmeal canster. And it turs out pretty good, I mean hey, homemade cornbread, what's not to love right? But tonight I wanted something different to mix it up a little and thought I'd try this recipe. OH. MY. SWEET. LORD. I practically sat in the kitchen licking the bowl like a toddler. The taste of the batter is somewhere between cornbread and yellow cake and the bread itself warm from the oven is heaven! It's incredible! I made 12 super huge (1/2c. of batter each) muffins from this recipe and they took 22 mins to cook at 375, exactly as stated. I also did away with the skillet and just microwaved my butter until it was hot in a big ceramic bowl and went from there. Otherwise the only substitution I made was souring my own milk with lemon juice rather than going out to buy buttermilk. No other changes, make it exactly as stated. It's to die for! You will NOT be disappointed by this recipe!

I bumped this up to 14 servings to handle a 9 X 13 pan (I didn't have an 8 X 8).  I kept the sugar at 2/3 cup, and threw in some frozen corn.  It was very good, with those proportions.

Best. Cornbread. Ever. I used whole wheat flour, fat-free milk soured w/lemon juice, and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup. Moist and delicious; held together very nicely.

I baked 25 min in a glass baking dish.  I "made" the buttermilk using 1 TBS of lemon juice and one cup of milk.  Other then that, followed recipe to a T.  First time making cornbread and will do it again:)

This cornbread is very good.  Well received at Thanksgiving dinner.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, including mixing all ingredients in the skillet.  I baked it in a glass pan for 30 minutes.

This was wonderful! My family all agreed that it was the best cornbread they had ever eaten! It was very moist for the first 45 minutes or so and then it started to dry out. If you plan on eating this right away, it will be fine but if not, it will start to dry out. But all in all this is a wonderful, simple recipe!

Followed recipe exactly as written. Baking time was about 33 minutes in an 8x8 pan.  Moist and dense with perfect touch of sweetness.  It complemented the chili's spiciness.  Will make again!

I joined allrecipes.com just to write this review. I'm a guy who has never made corn bread before. I've never made a loaf of bread before of any kind. 
This recipe is easy to follow and the result is absolutely delicious. I found the measurements to be spot on and baked for 30 minutes. The result was cornbread heaven! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

Thank you so much for this recipe! My daughter and I just made it to go with the chili we are having for dinner tonight. I used white whole wheat flour, splenda instead of sugar, and I didn't have buttermilk so I used a substitute. It came out so gorgeous! I tried a little piece and its moist on the inside with just the right amount of sweetness. I will be saving this one :) If anyone is wondering about the substitute... you pour a TBSP of white vinegar or lemon juice into a liquid measuring cup, then add milk to the 1 cup line, stir it, let it sit for 5 minutes and there ya go!

Second time I made it, I did vinegar in milk instead of buttermilk.  It was not liked by most of us....  Apparently you only should use buttermilk in this recipe.  And I would reduce the amount of sugar.

First time I made it:  Very good!  Kids loved it too.  I just hate buying buttermilk.  I never use it fast enough. :)

This was PERFECT! I made it as is and loved it. Also made it the 'southern' way for my bf and he raved about it. I simply increased the cornmeal to 1 1/4 cup cornmeal or so (I eyeballed it) and cut the flour back accordingly so that both came out to 2 cups. I also decreased the sugar to 1/3 cup which was perfect for him =) This was sooooo moist and had a perfect crumb. Yum!! UPDATE: I wanted to bake it in my 12" cast iron skillet so I doubled the recipe. It was too much for the skillet so I put the rest in my 8" skillet and that was perfect. I will do it this way from now on :-) With this method I heat the skillets at 425, when oven is ready I out a Tbsp of butter in each Pan and swirl it around and pour batter in. Turn the oven down to 375 and cook for 20-25 min. Perfection :) I also always add honey to my cornbread, even when it's just Jiffy. I'm convinced it makes them more moist.

I am rating this because our guests loved it and couldn't see any need for changes.   I, unfortunately, found it too buttery - like my cornbread a little less rich.  So, if you like a buttery taste this is it and it definitely is easy to make.

Since my husband loves bacon in his cornbread, I fried two pieces.  Then took some of the fat from that and used it to grease the pan, instead of butter or oil.  I crumbled the two pieces into the batter and it turned out wonderfully. 

As it was my first time making cornbread, I was surprised that the mixture was so runny while pouring it into the pan, but it rose perfectly and had a great texture still.

Finally adding a tablespoon of white vinegar to the cup of milk and letting it sit for 5 minutes is a good substitute for buttermilk.

I followed the notes of BETHANYWEATHERSBY who submitted the recipe and made it all in the pan used to melt the butter and then transfered it to the baking dish. I substituted the buttermilk by putting 1 tablespoon in my one cup measuring cug and then poured in milk.  Wait 5 minutes, good to go. It should be noted that when you eat it straight out of the oven it tastes a lot sweeter than when you let it cool off.  For the people who thought it was too sweet I wonder if they tried it the next day.  Either way it is delicious, and I felt no need to put butter on it.  I will try this again with some lighter substitutions next to make it a bit healthier. will report on my findings

Great recipe! Although, rather than dirty two pans, I just put it in our 12" cast iron skillet from stove top to oven. I also ran out of sugar, and topped it off with honey. Amazing!!

I periodically try the top 20 recipes on this site and this is one I picked. I thought it tasted okay, but I was surprised the recipe didn't have baking powder? In the past I always used the recipe "Golden Sweet Cornbread," from this site which I love. It is similar in taste. However, it isn't so dense, like this one, for lack of baking powder. Some of it got eaten warm and the rest ended up getting tossed. I guess I will be sticking with my usual.

This is now my daughter's favorite cornbread recipe, and my co-workers loved my 'cornbread experiment' where this recipe was challenged: would it work with greens? would it double as shortcake in strawberry shortcake? Everyone thought it was a winner in all respects!

This was really good.  I made these into 12 muffins and baked for 20 minutes.

Excellent!  I made a double batch, baked it in a greased 9 x 13 inch pan, and it was done in 30 minutes.  Any longer and it would have been overdone.  I'm freezing part of it so I hope it freezes as well as the author suggests it will.  This one's a keeper, as written.

My boyfriend is a celiac (allergic to wheat gluten) and so I was looking for a cornbread recipe to use for Eggs Benny. I stumbled upon this recipe and decided to substitute the flour for soy flour. I also realized halfway through that I didn't have any white sugar, so I used brown sugar instead... After all that, I baked it for 30 minutes and was surprised! Despite the strange-tasting batter, the cornbread turned out amazing! Just a tip for anyone using this recipe, use a pot instead of a pan to melt the butter and mix the ingredients into and there will be no mess with blending the ingredients - wheat or no wheat.

Followed another reviews suggestion and cooked in my cast iron skillet for 25 minutes. Followed rest of directions to a T. I like my cornbread sweet and this was perfect for myself and my hubby.

This turned out really good. I followed fairly closely although I added 1 tsp of baking powder with the soda. Full tsp of salt. I used white cornmeal but can't see how that would make a difference. I melted the butter in micro in large bowl (vs a large skillet) and went from there. Used half brn sugar & half white. I did add a few spices and cooked in my hot, lard greased cast iron skillet. At 375 it was done in 25 minutes. Very good, nice crust. Moist and not too sweet for me. Not your typical 'choke on it' dry cornbread (which I do NOT like). I'm thinking some chopped chili or jalapeno peppers would incorporate nicely. Will use this recipe with my minor changes from now on. Love this stuff with a spicy hot bowl of chili - Yum!

Wow!! I made the cornbread into muffins to go with fried chicken and they were amazing together!!! This was the first time I made cornbread not out of a box. I will never buy a box again. I didn't change anything but what I baked it in (muffin pan). I have already been asked by my 10 yr. old to make more!

I don't know why I ever try different cornbread recipes when I really like mine! This one is okay, but I still swear by the Fannie Farmer recipe. This recipe had a very wet batter and I think it made it taste a little "eggy". I also had to cook it quite long to get it cooked through the middle in my 8x8 pan and the edges were very dark brown. Not bad, but I think I'll stick to my old favourite from now on.

Great recipe!  I've never made cornbread before, but this is the best I've tasted by far.  The only thing I will do differently next time is to either bake it longer and hope it doesn't dry out (the middle wasn't completely cooked) or to use a different size pan.  I will definitely be making this again though!  I made this for chili, and am thinking that some green chilies and maybe even a little shredded cheese might be a good addition next time!

This was very good and very easy to make. I found that it was done in about 25 minutes (but I live at high altitude). Next time I would like to play with the flavor a bit and add cheese.

Tastes great, changed a few things however.  I made it with half a stick (1/4 cup) of butter originally and 1/2 cup of sugar with 50/50 cornmeal and flour.  It was great but cakey. Not bad at all.  The second time I realized my butter mistake and added the full amount and 1/2 cup of sugar with 1.25 cups of cornmeal and .75 cup of flour to make it more cornbready.  It was good, I liked the texture more but it was too buttery.  

The third time I kept the cornmeal/flour ratio to 1.25/0.75 and 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of sugar with the rest of the ingredients the same, and it was perfect. That's how I'll make it from now on. THanks!

The first time I made this it was fabulous. Best corn bread ever. The second time I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk and yogurt with a squeeze of lemon, and I used corn flour instead of flour and something went wrong with that combination. It must have been my fault. I'll try it again!

Made as calls for. Turned out delish! I think that maybe I will sub out some of the white sugar and replace with brown sugar next time, to see if it adds anything to the flavor. Will make again!

Made this for our weekly family dinner at my brother-in-law's house. I substituted plain yogurt for the buttermilk, and used 100% organic whole wheat flour. It was *so* good, everyone wanted seconds. Due to the density of the whole wheat, next time I will probably add another 1/4 cup of butter. Still, what an amazing recipe!

Very good corn bread; just a little too much butter for my taste, though. I added creamed corn and diced pimentos to one of the batches I made, it turned out really good! (I had to reduce the amount of buttermilk, though or it would have been too runny)

Very good cornbread! I doubled the recipe and out it in a 8 x 11 inch pan.The only change i made was cutting down the sugar by 1/3 cup after the recipe was doubled making it have a total of 1 cup of sugar. This was plenty sweet and gave the cornbread a sweet but savory taste. MMMM.

Easy, moist, fantastic. I made 3 changes:
1) Used whole wheat flour instead of white
2) Halved sugar (will probably use even less next time, maybe 1/4 cup)
3) Used milk + 1 tbsp lemon juice (let sit for 5 min) instead of buttermilk

EXCEPTIONAL - no tweaking needed AT ALL!  I did cut the recipe in half and cooked it in my mini-loaf pans (made 4 mini loaves), and only had to cook it for about 25 minutes.  The hubby said it was SO much better than any  he has ever made!  Thanks for sharing Bethany!

This recipe was easy and reliable.  I did reduce sugar to 1/2 cup, because I wanted it to be a side dish for dinner and it was plenty sweet.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I mixed some lemon juice with milk and it worked.  The bread was tender and moist.  The only thing i found stranfpge was that the cornmeal was basically uncooked, so it was kind of gritty.  But this is the first time I made it.  Maybe it's supposed to be that way.  Next time I'll try baking it for five extra minutes.

Finally found a recipe that is moist!!  Being from Texas it is slightly embarrassing that I can't cook cornbread but no more!!  However, I did change and add things.  Used half the sugar and doubled the salt.  Also, I added a minced large jalapeno, 1/2 a sauteed yellow onion and 1 cup of frozen kernel corn!!  Yum and I will be making Mexican Cornbread with this recipe next!!

Love it, love it, love it!!  To make it healthier, I split the flour between white and whole wheat.  The cornbread was moist and yummy!  Will try it again and add fresh blueberries to the batter.

Amazing cornbread! I forgot the sugar...and it was STILL good! Made it in an 8" cast iron skillet and a smaller #3 pan as well. It was done in 25 minutes and was absolutely perfect. I will be making this again!!!

I like this recipe because it has buttermilk.  I normally use your basic, but very good "Albers Cornmeal" recipe. Here is what I recommend: butter a cast iron skillet that you have warmed in the oven for about 10 min with 1T butter.  Then add your batter and bake.  I dont understand the sequence of ingredients she has??  All ingredients go in a bowl and mix.  Add to hot skillet and you cant go wrong!

This was yummy! First time making corn bread and I loved it! Used 1/2 c sugar and mixed 1/2 C whole wheat and 1/2 C all purpose flour and still turned out delicious. Used iron cast skillet and baked for 35 minutes. Will definitely make this again.

I tried to get my cornbread fix a week ago, when I saw a ban of it sitting in my bf's kitchen. It was so dry even after a loaded it with butter so I had to make my own. Your grandmothe's recipe is the best I've ever had!!!! I'm so glad I finally got my fix. I love sweet cornbread, because everywhere I've been in barely has sugar and is dry. This was just as moist the next day! I loved it and can't wait to make it again!

Amazing cornbread!

Perfect- very light and moist (not dry, like many cornbread recipes).

As the comments say, I cooked it for less time (25 mins, since I used a bigger pan).

Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

Cornbread is not a recipe which is made in the Netherlands very often (at least not in this fashion). That being said, I really enjoyed this! It is a mixture of bread and cake and though I didn't like the smell, I did enjoy the flavor a lot!!

This cornbread was AMAZING! Nobody could get enough and we finished an entire pan of it between the five of us! We like ours just a little sweet and that's exactly how it turned out. Just a quick word though: if some of the cornbread DOES make it into the second day, microwave it to warm it up and make it soften just a bit. The cornbread only has a shelf life of less than a week. Also, I "made" 1 cup of buttermilk by adding 1 Tbsp of vinegar to 1 cup of milk when I made the second batch and it turned out just as well.

This is great cornbread - moist, not too sweet, and paired well with a green chile strata for breakfast at the B&B.  I will definitely be using this recipe again!
I do think you could cut down on the butter a bit and substitute something less fattening if you want to without any problem, but I haven't tried that yet.

I melt the butter in a medium sized bowl in the microwave for roughly a minute so I don't end up over mixing the batter in the 8x8 pan. Then, I add the sugar and wait for it to cool for a few minutes before adding the eggs, so they won't scramble. I, also, add red and green jalapenos (at least 1 each and if you have only green peppers, that will do just fine), a couple of tablespoons of green onions, and a cup of shredded cheddar cheese before adding the remaining ingredients. Baked it for 35 minutes because we like the golden edges.

I followed the recipe to the T. This is most definitely a 5 star. I paired this up with homemade beef stew and there was nothing left of the cornbread or the stew. I will be using this recipe from now on instead of buying jiffy.

I grew up on the boxed Marie Callenders corn bread, which used to be decently good.  I have tried a lot of different cornbread recipes and never have they tasted this good.  I followed the recipe exactly, but baked it in a 13x9 for about 20-25 minutes and it was amazing!!  My husband grew up on crumbly dry gross cornbread and he loves this, as do both of my kids.   It's very moist and holds together well.
 I make it in a glass 8 cup measuring cup and melt the butter in the microwave to make it easier.  It is plenty sweet enough, just the way cornbread should be.  I have used margerine successfully, but just omitted the salt.  SOOO  worth making over and over!!  Leftovers are wonderful toasted in a toaster over to get them crunchy delicious and topped with a drizzle of honey.

This is a moist cornbread.  I found it a little on the sweet side, but I solved the dilemma by adding wild strawberries to the top and side of each slice.  YUMMY!  I also used 1/2 white and 1/2 wheat flour, so I don't know if that added to the sweetness or balanced it.  Overall, I would make again, but might modify the amount of sugar added.

Now I'll preface this by saying I'm not a Southerner by birth and I do love me some sweet cornbread.  This was unbelievably good.  I LOVE honey butter, but I had some on hand and didn't even use it because these were so delicious on their own, which is probably the highest compliment I can pay.  I halved the recipe and used a medium muffin pan to make cornbread muffins since I lent out my 8x8.  I baked them 14 minutes and they were perfect.  Plus, halving the recipe yielded 7 muffins, which broke down to 183 calories per muffin for those of us counting calories!

I just tried this recipe & could eat it all by myself. My sweetheart loves jiffy cornbread & I take pride in making everything from scratch. I am sure after he taste this cornbread he will never ask me to make jiffy again. I was able to mix everything in a cast iron skillet & just slide it in the oven. thank you so much for sharing.

Thanks, Grandmother. This is an excellent cornbread. 
I used unsalted butter; next time, I'll try salted to find out if the taste is affected.
My 7"X11" pyrex worked fine!

Bethany, this is fantastic. I had tried to make a cornbread listed on the box of a corn bread I purchased. It came out horrible. I tried it again thinking it might have been me. (It sure as He** wasn't me though). So I saw yours on here and thought I'de give it a try. You had great ratings and for good reason. I made yours almost to the tee because of the 2 previous failures. I didn't have the buttermilk so I used regular milk instead, but that was the only change to the recipe. It came out great even with the regular milk. Moist and tasty and froze the extra and it was just as good thawed out. I will try a full grandmother duplicate next time. I thank your grandma and would like to give her a big hug for giving you the recipe to add on here. 

Thanks again,
Damian

There is a reason this recipe has 2,300 + reviews on it.  It is a delicious and moist  recipe.  I was looking to use up some buttermilk, this is a wonderful way to do so.  Thanks Bethany for sharing your grandmother's recipe.  It is a winner!

Excellent!  I didn't have any flour so I substituted Pioneer Baking mix.  Didn't add the salt or baking soda per the recipe since the baking mix already has the leavening agents.

I made this for Easter dinner and this was very good.  I followed the recipe exactly and the cornbread came out perfect.  I didn’t change a thing. There were no leftovers. No more box cornbread for me!  Thanks.

I made this cornbread for a church dinner we had and everyone raved about it.  I love it!  It will be the cornbread recipe I will use again and again.  One note, I don't always have liquid buttermilk so I buy the powdered kind and it works beautifully in this recipe.  Thanks so much for sharing it with the rest of the world!

Perfect with Debdoozer's Blue Ribbon Chili!  Didn't change a thing but I'm thinking kernel corn will be a perfect addition for next time. =)

This was a good way for me to use my impulse purchased buttermilk. My family enjoyed it with our roast chicken, and we loved it warmed the next day. Since that's all it lasted. I will definitely be making this in the future. Though I will say that mine turned out a little dense.. It didn't rise well for some odd reason.

Very Yummy!!! Only change was I reduced the cooking time by 5-8 minutes. Didn't want it to over bake & get too brown on top. It was delicious!

Delicious! Half is gone and it came out of the over 15 minutes ago! Moist and sweet! Not dense or dry like cornbread sometimes is.  Want to try little pieces of bacon next time. Thanks for sharing!

This bread was excellent! I make this recipe with some major substitutions (due to allergies). I use plain soy milk, gluten free flour (from Costco) and a mix of chia seeds and water to replace the eggs. It turns out great ever time! A definite must try! It has become my go to recipe and now I am disappointed when I get anything less!

I have been searching for what seems like forever to find a moist recipe for cornbread. My husband always talks about how his ex-girlfriend's mom was the best cook and she made the most wonderful southern food. I used this recipe and he said that next time I have to make 2 pans, one for him and the other can be for the rest of us. Thanks so much for this recipe and for proving that I can be better than the memory of his ex-girlfriend's mother! I didn't change a thing and I have made it about 4 times in the last month. It comes out perfectly every time.

This was good.  It turned out really dry and I only baked it  30  mins.   Some ovens cook differently so I dont blame the recipe. I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet.  My favorite part was the cornmeal I put in. I used a medium grind cornmeal, it makes it crunchy.

I loved it!!!! I added some drained canned corn to the batter (just because I like it that way). I paired it with a white chili. It was fantastic. The guys I made it for had a serving of cornbread with their salad and again (2 servings this time) with the chili just because it was so good. I'm definitely holding on to this one! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe with us! :)

I've made this recipe a few times making little changes searching for the "perfect" cornbread recipe.  I don't like dense cornbread and I don't like crumbly, dry cornbread.  When I added only 1 tsp of baking powder to this recipe it was PERFECT!

Wouldn't have it any other way.  I moved from Indiana to Georgia, and although my southern room mates prefer their cornbread in a skillet, someway somehow, my giant batches always get eaten.  FYI, I make a 13x9 and increase the recipe by 50%...works like a charm.

Fantastic corn bread! I made it gluten-free by subbing the flour with a GF flour mixture I have (a mix of sorghum flour, tapioca flour and potato starch) and added 1 tsp xanthan gum. I also halved the sugar and it turned out great. Nice and moist!

I always make mediocre cornbread.  I've tried so many recipes--with sour cream, corn flour--you name it, and they never turn out the way I hope they will.  This is by far, the BEST I've ever made, and will continue to be the only one I use.  I made this in a buttered cast iron skillet and it worked great.  This is a sweet cornbread, so if that's not your thing, don't try this one.  :)

delicious with real buttermilk.  I, too, would reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup for adults. Thanks

This was just okay. Not all that the other posters made it out to be...maybe it was because I "made" my buttermilk, I'll try making again with buttermilk and see if it makes it any better.

My husband has used the same cornbread recipe for years and I didn't like it.  I made this one night and he loved it.  And now, he's converted to this recipe because he likes it so much more than the one he has used for years!  This recipe is sweeter and moister than a typical cornbread recipe.  It's wonderful!

To make it a bit more Weight Watchers friendly, I decreased the butter to 1/4 cup and sugar to 1/4 cup as well. Still came out very moist and sweet enough for us. My family loved it and can't wait for me to make it again.

Best cornbread recipe EVER!  I was a bit nervous about the sugar, so I cut it down to 1/2 cup.  It was still so sweet and delicious!  The crust on this bread was crisp while the center was light and fluffy!  MMMMM!  I doubled the recipe and melted my butter in a bowl in the microwave because I was lazy.  I don't think it made a difference.  The bake time was a bit less- only 30 min for a 9x13 pan (doubled recipe).  Rest assured I'll be making this AGAIN!  :)  Thanks for sharing!

The flavor was very nice ( I only used 1/3 cup of sugar, personal preferance) But I found it somewhat dry. Yes I did use the full 1/2 cup butter, but still a little dry. I think it may have been because of my milk, I did not have butter milk so I put 1 tbsp vinegar in milk to sour it (turn it into butter milk) I will try this again soom with real buttermilk and revise my rating if it is any moister.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit!  It makes the perfect amount for our family of six to eat with chili or soup.  I substituted milk for buttermilk because that was what I had.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This cornbread was DELICIOUS.  I did not change a thing and it came out wonderful.  Baked it for 35 minutes.  I don't usually like cornbread, but this is absolutely "THE BEST" ever!!  I did melt my butter in the microwave instead of on the stove.

Although I reduced the sugar in this by one third and used organic corn meal, it was still so delicious I ended up having to make another cake! Even my brother, who is extremely allergic to corn, took an antihistamine tablet just so he could have a piece, and he was not disappointed! Great recipe :)

My husband used to say he doesn't like cornbread. I've made this 3 times. Tonight he says this cornbread makes him want to dance!   I'm not a sweet cornbread fan, but this is so good. You don't mind the sweet. I made the recipe as stated and used a 9" pie pan. So yummy!

Ever have one of those moments when you say, "I need to have...."? Well oddly enough corn bread was it. We are not huge corn bread people but this recipe was very good. The buttermilk was a key ingredient that based my decision to use this recipe. Will make it again when the need calls.

Just finished dinner which was the slowcooker chicken taco soup on this site with this cornbread.  Yummmm.  I actually increased all ingredients except sugar, kept that the same, by 50% because I wanted to bake in my cast iron skillet and was afraid that it would be thin.  So glad I did the increase because it was the perfect thickness.  I didn't increase sugar because several reviewers said it was too sweet.  Glad I didn't because it was the perfect sweetness for us.  I didn't have buttermilk so added 1.5 tbs apple cider vinegar to my milk.  For cast iron skillet baking I greased it up with some butter and stuck it in a preheated oven to get hot while I got everything else ready.  Then poured the mix in the skillet once ready.  I only needed to bake for 20 min.  I think that is the census here, that 20-25 min is plenty.  Easy and tasty.  Thanks.. update 1/5/11 made with buttermilk  the 3 time and 100x better.  Stick with buttermilk.  Soooo goood...

Even though most cornbread seems dry, I still love it.  This however, is the moistest cornbread I've ever had!  I think the buttermilk must be the secret ingredient.  YUM!

I did not use the butter, I used mayo instead. Also I didn't use sugar, as I was making my grandmother's stuffing or Thanksgiving, so I didn't want the cornbread to be sweet. I did use melted bacon grease in a hot iron skillet for baking. I had to double the recipe so we could have half to eat and half for my stuffing.

I followed this recipe to the letter, and it was the best I've ever made!  I've tried many recipies, but this one beat them all by far.  Very moist.  I won't be looking for any more cornbread recipes; this one goes straight into my binder.  Easy to make, too.

Excellent!  I made exactly as written, with the advice given in the comments to mix everything in the same pan that I melted the butter.  I baked for 20 minutes and it was done.  I may try 19 next time, as the edges were a little crisp.  My 2 and 4 year old loved it and so did my husband.  It is rare to find anything that everyone in the family enjoys!

I made this for a group of friends coming over for dinner. I doubled the recipe to fit a 9 X 13 pan It was a HUGE success.  Served it with homemade soups.  I will definately make this many more times.

I made this recipe vegan and it was still fantastic.  I used high quality margarine, EnerG egg replacer, and unsweetened coconut milk with a touch of lemon juice in place of buttermilk.  The corn bread is moist, slightly sweet and the perfect consistency.

Delicious! Just the way I like cornbread. I mixed it all in my cast iron skillet and then baked it in the same skillet. Makes it even better because I hate doing dishes.

I had doubts that something so simple could be so awesome. But, it was! This is not a dry, crumbling cornbread - it's thick and dense and has such a great taste to it. My only suggestion is about the eggs - temper them before adding them to the sugar/butter mixture.

This was really good, but I intended it to have with Chili one night, and it was way too heavy and sweet. We didnt even finish the pan of cornbread because no one wanted it.   This would make something really great for breakfast I think.

I really liked this cornbread alot.  I used 1/2 c coarse cornmeal and 1/2 c regular cornmeal (I love coarse conrmeal in cornbread, gives it an authentic rustic result).  Though next time I will try lightening the flour with cornstarch (add 1-2 T of cornstarch to your cup measurment, then fill remaining with flour), this cuts the gluten factor which gives you a lighter texture.  These weren't as light the next day, reason for the 4 stars, otherwise it would have been a 5 star.  Will definately make again.  Was geat with chili.  Yum!  This site is dangerous for those who are on a diet, like me.

This is absolutely delicious! I made it gluten free by replacing the flour with “Jules Gluten Free Flour” (my favorite). I also took my time taking it out: Turned the oven off once it was done and opened the oven door and moved the rack out (leaving the pan on the rack for 5 to 10 minutes depending on how far it is done). This way it cools slower preventing the center from sinking which is VERY common with gluten free baked foods. I made it yesterday and there is only one piece left! This is a keeper.

Perfect!!!  I used the two tablespoons of lemon juice and 2% milk instead of buttermilk -- didn't want to run to the store.  Baked it in a glass pie pan, we keep losing 8x8's.

I am British and we don't have cornbread over here and I had never made it before. It was more like cake than I imagined cornbread to be. It was still very nice, but was too sweet to go with the chili I had made. It would be very nice for breakfast though, warm with butter.

I made this the first time to go alongside some chili I made for the schools' chili cook off. The chili was a big hit but the cornbread went even faster (and I did earn a trophy for the chili!). My youngest who isn't a bread-head like the rest of us and turns her nose up at "regular" (southern buttery drier) cornbread will DEVOUR this recipe. I've gotten so I make a double batch, bake em both in 9x13 pans, serve one, cut the second in to large cubes and freese it- some I serrve later, some I use for stuffings, crumbs, etc. It is easy, mildly sweet, very moist. Oh, please, just use the buttermilk... it's what keeps it so moist and delicious and buttermilk is not as fatty as people presume. It's worth it (and hey, you're already clogging your arteries with 1/2 cup of butter, right?!). Wish everything I made was so easy/yummy!!

Best corn bread I've ever had!  It tastes exactly like the stuff at Boston Market!  It's super easy to make and soooo tasty!  I made muffins with the batter (instead of a loaf of bread) and it turned out great.  The only thing I had to alter was the cooking time:  25 minutes for a dozen muffins.  Also, it's wonderful just the way it is - I didn't change a thing.  Such a great recipe for bakers of all levels!

This type of cornbread is different than what I'm used to. It was nice and moist, just too dense for what I prefer. I love buttermilk, but it almost gave the cornbread a sour taste. Will definitely give it another shot!

I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and upped the cornmeal to 1 1/2 cups because I like my cornbread less cake-like.

This by far the best cornbread our family has ever had!!  Usually we have the Mexican cornbread from this site, which we love, but decided to try a Southern one to go with our chili.  This did not disappoint!! Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!

You can use half the amt. of butter, sugar and eggs and have a healthier version of grandmothers cornbread. also try nonfat buttermilk, or even skim.  The taste and texture are in the cornmeal itself.

Tastes great, even without any modifications. What i usually do though is substitute half of the white sugar for brown. Another thing that i do is about 10 minutes before its done cooking i melt some butter together with brown sugar and honey and pour this all over the top- you get a nice, sweet, crunchy outer layer.

Best cornbread I've ever had/made. I doubled the recipe, put it in a 9x13'' pan, and found that the toothpick came out clean after 30 minutes.  I had it on convection for the first 20 minutes, and then convention for the final 10.

Excellent corn bread!  I made it per the instructions the first time.  The second time I substituted real dark NY maple syrup for half the sugar.  Both of them turned out wonderful.  I cooked them in preheated cast iron pans.  I will be making this recipe again, and again.  Thank you for posting it!

Great cornbread!  It is now our favorite!  Instead of melting the butter in a skillet I microwaved it in a mixing bowl for a minute.  This way the butter can melt without getting too hot, and stirring the sugar and eggs is easier in the bowl than a skillet.

Very good, but I didn't notice it being "exceptionally moist".  Nice way to use up buttermilk, though.

Substituted the butter, buttermilk, and flour with gluten free/casein free (GFCF) alternatives (vegan margarine, soymilk, and GFCF all-purpose flour) with good results for a GFCF version.

I misplaced my regular Southern Cornbread recipe...and hunted this one up as a substitute.  Very good and close to the one I usually make.  I did however cut way back on the sugar to 1/4 cup and added about 1/2 tsp. of Baking Powder as levening.  To make the assembly easier, I melted the butter in the oven right in my 8X8 pan, and mixed the remaining ingredients in a mixing bowl to save dishes and extra steps. When the butter is melted coat the edges of the pan, pour the remaining butter into batter and stir.  Pour into hot buttered pan and bake according to the listed directions. Very moist and great with Chili.  Now that I have found this recipe I will stop looking for my old one!

To make this slightly more healthy I used 1/4 cup butter 1/4 cup canola oil. I also used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose and added  1/4 flax meal with a few tablespoons water. It turned out wonderfully!

This cornbread is incredible.  Truly.  I made it with white whole wheat flour instead of all purpose, and cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup instead of 2/3, and poured the batter into a pre-heated cast iron skillet for baking, but otherwise left it the same.  Have made it twice now.  Fantastic!

Just wonderful.  Very moist, very delicious!  The best I've ever had.  My husband raved about it.  This is definately a keeper!  Baked it on Sunday and it was still moist and wonderful to eat on Wednesday.   I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13.

Absolutely the BEST I've ever had in my 58 years of life.  I even make it as a gift for friends and everyone loves it.  My modification, however, is a MUST: bake in an iron skillet that has been preheated in oven with 1/4 cup of oil.  Add all ingredients together and pour into preheated skillet.  Better than Grandma's!

I loved this- it was so good!!  I baked it in my 10.5 inch cast-iron skillet.  This was some of the best cornbread I've ever had.  I slightly reduced the sugar.

Best cornbread - hands down! Probably a stick of butter has something to do with that! :-) Did it as written - and wouldn't change a thing! This will be my cornbread recipe of choice from now on. Thanks!

I wanted to learn how to make cornbread because my family loves cornbread. I'm not the biggest fan of cornbread, but I love THIS cornbread! I tried many recipes and the cornbread never tasted good. Then I found this recipe. It is so easy and it turns out great each time. I have neighbors that request this cornbread from me. If I make it and don't make enough for them they get upset! lol. Now I always make double. I've made friends over this cornbread.

This cornbread is fantastic!!  I have made it several times now.  Instead of a large loaf, I usually make small mini-muffins which bake in about 10 minutes or so.  My preschooler son loves them!!

I have made this recipe so many times...to rave reviews.  I make a double batch and use 11X13.  The only thing I do different is that, fresh out of the oven, I rub butter over the top and then sprinkle with sugar...yummy!

Fabulous! My father who doesn't normally like cornbread loved this! Flavor was awesome, however it was a tad dry. Next time I may add some cream corn and see if that moistens it up a little bit. Thank you for the recipe.

Excellent if you're looking for the sweet and moist cornbread, not the dry bland kind. I never buy buttermilk I just add a splash of apple cider vinegar to the regular milk when I measure it out, just stir and let sit for a min or two. I love to add a dollop of sour cream for extra moistness in my cornbread when mixing. And I add a handful or two of shredded cheddar and a spoon or two of the pre diced jalapenos in a jar. Yum yum, sweet and spicey. This is my new favorite cornbread recipe!  Oh and I don't melt the butter in the skillet, I melt it in a pyrex measuring cup in the microwave, stir in sugar, and temper the eggs so they don't scramble.

My whole family loved this recipe. It was easy to make (followed the one pot mixing instructions). My 86 year old aunt who is extremely finicky loooooved this cornbread. One of the very few recipes that I tested that was an easy pleaser without lots of 'tweaking". Works well in muffin cups as well (baked for 25-35 min at 350).

Just make sure to use fine ground cornmeal---we had course ground cornmeal and it was like eating pieces of sand.  Great flavor, but we'll try it with the different version of cornmeal next time.

WOW!  Okay, I do not really like cornbread, but my husband does and always has to have it when we have chili.  I have tried several recipes but they always end up dry and crumbly.  Not so with this recipe!  I used my cast iron skillet- just mixed everything in it and popped it in the oven.  It turned out SO good!  My husband, 3 year old, and 18-month old devoured it.  And I actually sat there just eating cornbread, which I NEVER do!  Thanks so much for this awesome recipe!

I love this recipe.  Each time I cook the cornbread it turns out perfectly.  It usually doesn't last a day in my house because my daughter says it taste like cake, so she eats it up.

Absolutely perfect cornbread. This recipe was great in Cornbread Stuffing with Sausage.  I will never purchase a crappy packaged cornbread mix again ever. I also cut back on the sugar because I was using it in stuffing, but will make it again for a chili side dish and use all the sugar.  Yummy stuff.

Holy awesomeness!  I've tried SO many cornbread recipes from this site, and I'm so glad to finally have found the one I will use from now until eternity.  This was the best cornbread ever.  It was moist (not crumbly) and just sweet enough.  I cooked it in a round cake pan and served it in wedges with a meat version of The Best Vegetarian Chili Ever from this site.  One of my guests asked if he could take some home to his wife because he liked it so much.  I'm going to try it with corn and/or jalepeno or green chilis.  I hate to mess with a perfect recipe, but who knows what genius I'll stumble upon with a little experimentation!?  Give this one a shot, you'll never make anything else.

This recipe is awesome. I made it in a cast iron skillet--might as well, since you need to melt the butter in a skillet anyway. I substituted half of the sugar for honey, and half of the butter for coconut oil to make it healthier. The cooking time with the cast iron skillet is only 25 min. I loved it!

This was the PERFECT cornbread.  I've tried other recipes on here, but I think I've found the last one I'll use.  I used the buttermilk baking powder which is handy to keep around.

This was exactly what I expected after reading all of the reviews - very dense, moist and sweet.  It went perfect with the spicy chili I made.  I don't know that I'd make it again, though, as I realized that I really like a more dry and crumbly cornbread that I can slather with butter and maybe some honey.  It was exactly as the recipe and submitter states, so if that's what you're looking for you definitely won't be disappointed.

In my search for a cornbread recipe to make cornbread stuffing with, this was recommended to me. This was a very good sweet cornbread recipe. It turned out cakelike. I did like the sweetness but think I may experiment with less sugar to see how this turns out. I'm not so sure it would work well for my stuffing with the amount of sweetness, but I did like it. Hubby enjoyed it too.

I have substituted with smart balance butter, regular skim milk, whole wheat flour, and splenda, and it has come out delicious, sweet, and moist every time!! I agree that if you are not into the sweet cornbread (which lucky for me, I AM!!!), this may be too sweet for you.

I accidentally used polenta instead of corn meal for this (I believe the only difference is that the polenta grain is a tad bigger) and the cornbread still came out amazing. Echoing a few other people, it is amazing with honey butter, seriously. So decadent. Never thought I'd use that word to describe cornbread (I'd never been a big fan until recently).

Even though I made a few personal preference changes to this recipe, I chose this recipe because I liked the equal amount of corn meal to flour.  Some recipes have too much flour.  I thought the amount of butter in the recipe would make it moist since corn bread can be a little crumbly.  The changes I made was to lower the baking temperature by 25 degrees because I used a glass pan.  I used milk soured with lemon juice because I never buy buttermilk.  Instead of using 2/3 cup of sugar I reduced the sugar to a total of 1/2 cup.  I used 6 tablespoons of white sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey.  I also let the batter sit for about 5 minutes before putting it in the oven.   I made this recipe last night to go with Slow-Cooked Chili.  It disappeared so quickly that I had to make another today.

Have made this several times, both with and without wheat flour.  It is a little too sweet with white flour, but perfect with wheat!  A real family-pleaser.

This is a great recipe.  The cornbread was moist, sweet (but not too sweet) and full of flavor.  It also held together well - not crumbly at all.  I didn't have buttermilk, but the commonly used substitute of milk and a Tbsp of lemon juice did the trick.  I also baked it in a cast iron pot which let it brown nicely.

Incredible. Perfectly moist, tender crumb, simply amazing! I am so glad I stumbled upon this recipe at last minute! I made mini muffins that turned out fabulous--added a can of diced green chiles to half the batter for fun. Such a hit! This is a favorite now! No more box mixes! EVER. =)

This is the best cornbread I've ever had. I followed the recipe exactly, but baked it in a glass loaf pan, and it came out perfectly. Thanks a million!

Really delicious cornbread.  I whipped this up on a whim right before dinner and it was super fast and easy to toss together and tasted absolutely wonderful with whole wheat flour.  Made sour milk (1TBP vinegar in 1 cup milk) instead of buttermilk.

The first time I tried making cornbread and used this recipe with some changes.  I made buttermilk by using 1 cup 2% milk and 2tablespoons white vinegar (as 1 tbsp did not work), then added two and a half teaspoons of baking powder. Baked it as per directions and presto! YUMMY!!  My husband who said he doesn't like cornbread... had to have his second slice. He is now a BELIEVER. I think I will call this "Bing's Cornbread" recipe.  Thank you Bethany for sharing your special recipe.

This was WONDERFUL!  After eating it, my hubby said, "This is now OUR family cornbread recipe.  So let it be written.  So let it be done."  Nuff said.  I did make some modifications.  I used 1/4 c. butter and 1/4 cup vegetable oil.  Next time I will probably try using Smart Balance Light Butter (as one reviewer suggested).  I made my own buttermilk using 1% milk plus lemon juice.  I also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  It was exellent!  This is definitely a keeper - moist & delicious!

and to think I used to buy boxed cornbread ... I'm *so* ashamed!  I've made this recipe over and over and over again and it just keeps getting better and better.  Have made absolutely no changes to recipe ... I think it's fantastic just the way it is.  Hats off

I will be making this again and again!  Easy to prepare and was ready exactly at 30 minutes so no guessing and adding extra time.  It's nice and sweet, just the way southerners like any corn item.  Held together well and didn't crumble.  I couldn't stop cutting out little pieces while the steaks were on the grill.

Thanks to you and your grandmother my search for a delicious corn bread will stop here.  It helped to read your clarification on preparation.   Thanks to the reviews and other's comments, I mixed the batter in one skillet (only until combined) and then transfered the batter to a preheated cast iron skillet.  It was the best!

This was a really simple recipe and i thought it was ok but my boyfriend loved them. i dont like super sweet corn bread so i only put in half a cup of sugar, which i think changed the taste because they ended up tasting like butter and flour. i also dont like how dense they are but my boyfriend did. i thought they were really good dipped in some goulash i made though

YUMMY and way too easy! I did alter the recipe by adding in a cup of whole kernal corn and I mixed and baked it right in a cast iron frying pan.... It was very yummy and I served it to company too and they even asked for a to-go container.

mmmmmmmm! This is fantastic cornbread!  We don't often have buttermilk on hand, but now I think we will so we can make this cornbread!  I only had half a cup of cornmeal so I halved the recipe and bake in a round glass dish for 20 minutes. It was the perfect for my family of three.  Not much left over though!

Excellent recipe.  Very moist but also very sweet.  I reduced the amount of sugar by about 1/4 cup and reduced the flour by 1/2 cup so it would not be so "cakey".  It was perfect!  Next time I will add some pecans and drizzle honey butter on top.  I should also add that I baked this in a round metal cake pan and the crust was amazing!

This was awesome cornbread.  Next time I will try adding little bits of corn.  I made a double-batch and it was delicious. Only thing is one of them was a little too doughy in the middle but the other one was fine, so it must have been my error.

Very good. Not a crumbly dry cornbread at all. I used whole milk slightly warmed with fresh lemon juice for the buttermilk. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Was the best cornbread I've ever made, crumbly, buttery and delicious, although next time I will cut the sugar in half, because it was a little sweet for my taste.

This was quite delicious, and I was looking for something that would turn out great since I have never made cornbread from scratch. I have to say that I will try other recipes too. Try putting dried cranberries in this before you bake it, just enough to have a good sprinkle through the mix... you won't regret it!

I not a big fan of corn bread without corn in it so I doctored this up a bit.  I also didn't have any corn meal but had Aunt Jemima Buttermilk Corn Meal Mix. It's corn meal, flour, salt and baking powder mixed together.  Two cups of the mix was used instead of 1 cup of corn meal and 1 cup of flour.  I withheld the salt since it was already in the mix. 1 can of cream corn and 4 minced chipotle peppers (remove seeds) were added to the batter to add texture and a little kick.  I used large muffin tins - poured half the batter in the tins - added a small slice of Extra Sharp Cheddar Cheese and then topping it off with additional batter.  Yummy!! I baked them for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.

I am an avid baker and this is my favorite cornbread recipe.  My whole family eats every crumb, every time.  I use a cast iron skillet to mix all the ingredients and follow the recipe exactly.  Make sure that you whisk in the eggs very fast if your butter is hot!  (They cook otherwise!)  Thanks!

This cornbread recipe is sensational. I wouldn't change anything. Texture is sweet and moist just as described. I had used vinegar and milk to substitute for buttermilk and they were still very good. Next time I will try real buttermilk and I'm sure the results will be even better.

No alterations needed, perfect as is.  Healthier version turned out the same, using egg beaters, fat free buttermilk and Splenda for Baking.  WONDERFUL blend of sweetness and corn taste and perfectly moist.

I was in the mood for cornbread - something I haven't eaten since I was little. This came pretty close. Next time I'll try using 1/2 c. sugar as I found it a bit too sweet. Thanks for the recipe!

This is my favorite cornbread recipe. I only use 1/3 c. sugar though, and just make sour milk if I don't have buttermilk. I also bake it right in the skillet. Works great--but don't overcook! Update: I now make this with all-purpose gluten-free flour and it works great! I also reduced the sugar to 1/4 c. or no sugar at all.  I make great gluten-free cornbread stuffing with this--definitely leave out the sugar for that.

I use canola oil and whole wheat flour--it works wonderfully.  Rich and sweet cornbread.  In my iron skillet, it takes just 22 minutes at 375.

This cornbread is awesome! Just sweet enough and very moist. I thought I had over baked it, but it was perfect - a little crispy on the top but soft and moist inside. I followed the recipe exactly.

Mmmm!  This cornbread was fabulous.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1 cup skim milk and removed 2 tbsp.  I then added 2 tbsp lemon juice and let sit for 5 minutes.  Works like magic.  I made this cornbread with a Basic Ham and Bean Soup recipe by J. A. McConville also on allrecipes.  It was a great meal.

yum, yum, yum, i've been cooking for years and lost my recipes in a flood when I moved a couple of years ago. I haven't made cornbread since. Tonight I had Beans on the stove and realized I didn't have bread.. So I ran to the computer and typed in best corn bread.. this one looked the most like what i've made in the past.. It was better!!! My husband (who is not a corn bread lover) loved it. I used 3/4 cup evaporated milk a tablespoon of lemon juice and filled up the cup with water for the buttermilk.. mmm mmmm sooooooo good!

This recipe is so much better than the one on the cornmeal container! This is how real cornbread is supposed to taste.  I made mine into muffins and it worked great (easier to serve).

This was quick and easy.  I even made it gluten and dairy free!  I used almond milk and some lemon juice to make the buttermilk, and I used a sorgham flour blend instead of all purpose flour.  Since I made it GF, I added some baking powder and xanthum gum.  I cooked it in a cast iron skillet in the oven.  Yummy!

I made this cornbread exactly according to directions, and this recipe is delicious!!  I have been looking for a really good sweet cornbread recipe and this one is it! If you like a sweet cornbread, then give this one a try.  I baked mine in a cast iron pan to get the edges crispy.  I will be making this again soon.  Thank you for this recipe!

Pros:
1) Very easy to make
2) Very good taste

Cons:
1) A little too sweet
2) Flavor much too "bready", not enough "corny"
3) Very slightly on the dry side

SO, though very good indeed, this definitely does not deserve a rating of "excellent".

I used:
whole "bulgarian" buttermilk
unsalted butter

This was way too greasy, sweet, and dense for my taste. I like fluffier and less-sweet cornbread. The consistency really threw me off.

I will add my 5 stars to this stellar recipe.  Best cornbread I've ever made -- it's very moist and just delicious.  My son loves cornbread so I've been searching for a really good recipe for awhile -- but the search is over.  I made this last week for a work gathering, along with White Bean Chicken Chili from this site, and both were a hit.

This is one of the best cornbread recipes that I've tried from this website. I could tell from the taste of the batter that it was a winner and it was. My husband loved it. I didn't change a thing except cut it in half and cook it in a loaf pan since we were the only ones eating and it was gobbled up.

This is way too sweet.  It is not cornbread, but corncake.  Genuine southern cornbread does not contain sugar.  It's supposed to be bread, not a dessert!!!

I can't tell you how long I've been searching for a recipe like this!! If you like a sweet, cake-like cornbread, you can't go wrong here!! Absolutely the best.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 1 cup of 1% milk and added 1 tbsp. vinegar.  It was divine.  Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe.

I only made two changes to this great recipe, the first was milk + lemon juice because I didn't have buttermilk, and the second was half wheat flour and half white. I like the hearty/nuttiness wheat provides.
It is a denser cornbread than I am used to, but is super tasty. I had no problems with dryness, and I will definitely make this again.

This was DELICIOUS!! I followed the recipe to a T. I did use course corn meal and it nice and crunchy. So MOIST, it never fell apart, my daughter thinks it's cake and ate it all. I've made other recipes in the past and they were either dry or fell apart but this was the BEST! A definite keeper, I'll never make any other recipe. THANK YOU!!

Unlike so many other cornbreads out there, this was moist and had a wonderful flavor.  Be careful with the amount of sugar you add to the mix.  I think 2/3 of a cup of sugar will work for someone who has a sweet tooth.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar content to 1/2 of a cup. Other than that, this is a fantastic recipe.  10/28/2010 Update:  I baked the same recipe over.  Only this time, I baked it in my Lodge Logic 12 inch cast iron skillet.  Making cornbread in a cast iron skillet is so much better than anything else.  Once you try it, you'll never go back to your former baking pans.

This is WAAAY too sweet for my taste, but my biggest problem is how very greasy and dense it is. It's edible, but I won't be making it again - there are many recipes out there that are much better (and not to mention healthier).

Wow...this came out so good.  Very moist, great flavor.  Made it exactly as the recipe said.  My husband is from Puerto Rico and grew up eating cornbread with coffee rather than with a meal later in the day. He loves this recipe! I sent some with him when he went to visit his family and they loved it, too! Not too sweet, just right.

This recipe is without doubt, the best recipe for cornbread that I've EVER tasted.  It was moist and perfect in texture.  We like ours just a tad bit sweeter, so I’ll adjust accordingly next time.  The flavors blend extremely well, so the only recommendation that I can make to this already PERFECT recipe is make it several hours before. Yummy stuff!!  This will definitely replace my current cornbread recipe – thanks a million for sharing this!

This is the best cornbread recipe I have found!  It is a little sweet so next time I will cut back on the sugar but other than that, it is PERFECT!  I can't believe how moist it is!

Extremely moist and delicious, even the day after baking! This cornbread is dense and pretty sweet., I think it is better served as muffins or as a breakfast treat with butter and honey apposed to being served with chili. I know its a bit unfair to rate recipes that you have altered, but I am going to anyways to let people know that you can change this recipe if you have dietary restrictions and still have it turn out fabulously! Instead of buttermilk I used 3/4c plain soy yogurt and 1/4c plain soymilk. Instead of butter I used non-dairy baking butter, the cornbread turned out excellent! The next time I make this I will follow the recipe exactly to see if I like it better with real butter and buttermilk. Either way, this recipe seems quite foolproof and I was not disappointed at all!

My Granny made excellent cornbread, so I wish I could says your recipe made a cornbread just as good.  However, I cannot...Your cornbread is BETTER!!! This is a moist cornbread.  Normally I slather on a TBSP of butter per slice.  This was so moist it didn't need butter or honey to make it edible (of course a little extra butter never hurts though!).  I made this recipe exactly as stated...can't rate it five stars if I need to change things.  Oh, for other readers...it was just as good the next day too!

Delicious ! I ate those muffins with apple butter and it was perfect. Only thing I did was cutting down the sugar (only used a bit more than half a cup)like I usually do, and I shouldn't have ! It was not as sweet as I would have liked... my bad!

Very good.  If you use a cast iron skillet, feel free to simply spray it with cooking spray (save the calories, and there's no taste difference whatsoever).  Also, this recipe filled my cast iron skillet (which may be on the small side- the iron is naturally molded into 8 separate "slices" of cornbread) as well as one muffin tin (6 muffins).  I baked both side by side for 20 minutes at 375, and all was perfect.

This cornbread was WAY to sweet and the texture was not good. And when I went to put the eggs in the pan, I got scrambled eggs! It was still too wet when I took it out of the oven, even though the top was burned.

I have never liked homemade cornbread. I always use Jiffy as if it would be a sin not to. I have tried previously to make cornbread from scratch and it was a disaster. Not this time. I will be using this for cornbread dressing and any other excuse I can come up with to make it. I am so happy about this. Can't wait for my mother to try this. She will be so surprised. I think I wanna make another batch right now because it was so easy. Scared no more. I got it now. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much. Change the name to Grandmother's Best Buttermilk Cornbread. I am adding this to my collection and putting on my flash drive with the rest.

Yum! I made mine into muffins (made 12 muffins and baked approx. 25 minutes). I'll make this my standard cornbread recipe. I love that I can melt the butter rather than creaming it in the mixer. I don't have to remember to set the butter out ahead of time, and I don't have to wash the mixer.

Mmmmm, I love this cornbread!! I made it in a cast iron skillet as suggested by a previous review. I pre-heated the oven and the cast iron skillet while I prepared the batter, set the timer for 20 minutes and it was probably a minute or two too long. I will definitely make this again. Very good!

This is great and easy. I mixed up the dry ingredients and used powdered buttermilk. I melted the butter, added the 1cup of water the powdered buttedmilk called for, then the eggs and mixed well. I then stirred in the dry ingredients and baked. It was wonderful. I plan to make up several bags of the dry ingredients to have ready right away rather than have to measure every time. Thank you!!

Yummy, yum, yum!  This is our new favorite!  I used to make Amusement Park Cornbread that I believe is from this site....not anymore.
If you do not like a moist cornbread do not try this recipe (I have met many people here in SC that like their cornbread dry, yuck)
Thank you for a great recipe!

I have made this several times now, and my husband says it is "hands down" the best cornbread he has ever had.  I bake it in a preheated cast iron skillet for 25 minutes, and add canned corn, as another member suggested.  I also use 1/2 cup white and 1/2 cup whole wheat flour.

This is the ultimate cornbread recipe. Made it exactly as written. Don't need to change a thing. If the idea of buttermilk is a big turn off rest assured that you will not detect a drop of it. My mother hates buttermilk and she never knew I used it and she loved this cornbread. (I'll never tell either!)

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could.  I guess all the cornbread everyone has made for me came from a mix lol.  This turned out awesome.  My husband and kids raved and my 4 year old daughter, every time she took a bite she shook her head and said HMMM HMMM.  She doesn't even do that with cake haha.  The only things I changed were I used whole wheat flour and I only used a heaping quarter cup of sugar.  It would have been way too much sugar for us.  I absolutely loved it though and it's the first cornbread I've tasted that could go without butter and still be fantastic.  Thanks so much!

EASY, FAST, YUMMY. I halved the amount of sugar, used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Wholesome. I baked it in a pre-heated cast iron skillet, oiled. Cornbread slices nicely. I'll never use boxed mix again! I like to know exactly what's inside what I cook, especially when cooking for my daughter who is sensitive to certain foods (eczema). Her baby brother ate some mashed up in pinto bean juice and loved it. Thanks a bunch!!

These were really tasty...I don't really like the mixing in one pan since it is hard to make sure all the ingredients are incorporated.  I had a muffing that was full of salt bc I didn't mix it enough.  I will make again but I will melt the butter in the microwave and use the Kitchenaid mixer.  Great recipe though!

Love this recipe!  I make it often as pancakes on a hot griddle.  Works best as a smaller (4" or less) pancake.  I serve it with a goulash or thick soup.

Oh my goodness - everyone raved! I replaced the white flour with 'white' whole wheat flour and mixed all the dry ingredients ahead of time (for timing purposes).  Then I just melted the butter and mixed it with the eggs and buttermilk and poured that in.  VERY EASY AND DELICIOUS!  My search for the 'perfect cornbread recipe' has ended!

I am throwing all my cornbread recipes away.  This is perfect! I make it in my cast iron skillet and it comes out moist and delicious.  I added about half cup of corn kernels and loved it. Made it also with a bit less sugar the second time. The family loves it.

This was delicious with   a spicy vegetarian chili! I used smart balance lite in replace of butter, and used half splenda half sugar. I didn't have  buttermilk on hand so I used a little under a cup of low fat milk with 2 tbl of lemon juice. The bread has a soft crumb with a cake like consistency, it was delicious.

I would give 4.5 stars if I could.  This recipe was good - but not the best ever.  I used less sugar(1/2 cup), as suggested by others, added a small can of corn and made them into muffins - rather then a big pan.  All in all - pretty good and rather easy! Thanks for sharing!!

VERY tasty, very moist, but still crumbly as cornbread should be. I am going to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup next time - my husband is a "San Antonio boy" and said this was sweeter than traditional cornbread.

What a delicious, easy and quick recipe! We both loved the result (35 min in a gas oven at 375) and will be making this regularly. Would work well with less sugar, finely chopped fresh herbs or cheese too.

A great recipe that I've made several times and always enjoyed. Recently I decided to try America's Test Kitchen "All purpose cornbread" recipe, seduced by the promise of "more corn flavor" from adding blended corn kernels along with the cornmeal. Phooey on that. The ATK recipe was more work and didn't taste nearly as good as this one.

I thought the Homesteader Cornbread recipe on this site was pretty good, but if I could give this more than 5 stars, I would.  I doubled the recipe and baked in a 13X9 pan - just keep an eye on it, depending on your oven - mine was done to perfection at 28 minutes.  Bottom and sides were a perfect golden brown.  Just the right amount of sweetness and a nice buttery taste.  Not dry and crumbly at all, which I like.  Ahh... this is the one!

Gluten free too!  Personally, I felt this was too sweet, but my cornbread loving hubby said "this is the best cornbread I've ever eaten." Amazingly, he said this with my "altered recipe" - I substituted gluten-free "all purpose flour blend," used half oil for the butter, used Ener-G foods powdered egg substitute for the eggs and real maple syrup for the sugar, cutting down on the milk accordingly. 

He ALSO loved the "original" version, but again, using gluten free flours and adding ground flax seed as an alternative to make healthier. Also used stoneground, whole cornmeal, not refined.

Our friend with celiac disease recently gave me a taste of a "gluten free cornbread" that she thought was good. There was NO comparison!

So, although too rich for my tastes, appears you have a winner regardless.

I thought this was okay; not the best I've had so I will keep looking. I substituted butter for the oil but other than that I made as directed; texture was a bit more firm than I was hoping for, but I may try again with oil and bake less (I did 30 min and it was still a bit wet so I put back in for 5 minutes).

I've tried different cornbread recipe, and this one I'm sticking with.  I do  change it a little bit sometime.  I add a tablespoon of sour cream, about 1/4 cup of frozen corn, and 1/2 a small can of diced green chilis.  It comes out really well and very moist.  My husband loves it too, if there's a thick layer of sugar on top..so I add about 2 tbsp of sugar on top before I bake it.  Really good, even my 2 year old and 8 months old love it.

Yummy!  I have a son who's allergic to cow's milk, so I replaced the buttermilk with 1 cup of soy milk mixed with 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice.  I also substituted brown sugar for half of the white sugar (because I like how brown sugar tastes in corn muffins).  I  poured the batter into 12 muffin cups, then baked it in my (always too hot oven) at 350 for 20 minutes.  They turned out great - cake-like, just the way we like them - moist & sweet.

This is simply amazing. It's very easy to make, and will be a hit with the crowd. Everyone that I have made this for, always goes back for a second piece. I always serve it with cinnabutter (do a search for that on here as well), which is a wonderful complimenting spread.  Edited to add: I'm still making this cornbread, and everyone still LOVES it! However, I wanted to add that last night, I didn't have cornbread. Sent my husband to the store, and he came back with half and half! Lol! Rather than sending him back, I used cold whipping cream and added about 1tbsp of lemon juice. It doesn't come out with the same texture, but rather more fluffy muffin-like. And that substitution is ALSO wonderful if you'd like it fluffier. My mother said she actually preferred it that way, where as my husband and I prefer it the original way. Either one is great though!

I've never made cornbread from scratch and this is good.  As a reviewer had suggested, I baked them in muffin top pans and now have little cornbread saucers.  I also decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and baked them for approximately 13 minutes.  They tasted very good, but were a little dry.  So, I will definitely use this recipe again, but will bake them for slightly less time.  Thanks!

This was really good.  I just did the entire prep and cooking in my cast iron skillet, as suggested by a previous reviewer.  It was really easy that way, and there was only one dish to clean!  I served this with the Honey Butter from this site and it was great.  Thank you!

WOW, no more Jiffy mix for me!  This is definitely the best cornbread recipe I've ever made (and so simple)!  My husband loved it too.  It reminds me of the cornbread the Tippin's Restaurant serves.  It's wonderful.  I followed the directions exactly and wouldn't change a thing.  It took exactly 35 minutes at 375 in the oven in a 8x8 glass baking dish to come out perfectly! Thanks for this recipe, it's a keeper for sure!

This is one of those recipes on allrecipes.com that you don't change one thing on! Hands down, the BEST cornbread I've eaten! I am going to share this recipe with my entire family, mostly southerners who love their cornbread. And this cornbread is extra special if you split it in half and toast it, top it with honey or jam. YUM! Thanks for a keeper recipe, I will be making this again and again for sure. Just can't say enough good stuff about this cornbread.

Great recipe! Skipped the skillet and just melted butter in the microwave on high for 30 seconds, then poured into a large mixing bowl and followed the recipe from that point. Seems to turn out the moistest at 35 minutes.  The perfect sweet cornbread!

I thought this recipe was awesome. My family loved it. I cooked it in the oven for 40 minutes and my did not come out dry, I cooked it in my stoneware pan, I don't know if that helped or not. My kids love Boston Market cornbread and they said it tasted just like it. Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

This is the best made-from-scratch cornbread I have ever eaten. I did what a few other people recommended, adding lemon juice to milk because I didn't have buttermilk. I also added wheat flour because I was short on the cornmeal amount. I doubled the recipe and only had one cup and a little more of cornmeal. I made up the rest of the amount with wheat flour. Everyone commented on how much they loved the texture and taste and when I told them I used wheat flour they said I should do that every time. I also cooked it in a 9 by 13 pan even though I doubled the recipe. It didn't negatively affect the bread. I probably would use a little more cornmeal next time so that it has more corn taste--but not much more. So good!!

I've been looking for a good cornbread recipe for a long time and this is definitely it! I used one pot to melt the butter, add the sugar, let it cool a bit, added the buttermilk, then the beaten eggs and finally the flour, salt and baking soda. I did increase the salt and baking soda to 3/4 t. hoping it would help the bread to be light, rather than dense like most cornbread seems to be. The bread turned out beautiful, light, a little sweet with a thin crispness around the edges. I checked on it at 23 minutes just to see where it was in the baking process and the pick came out clean so I removed it from the oven and checked it again since the baking time was supposed to be approximately 30 minutes. This cornbread is perfect in every way. I shared half of it with an 84 year old neighbor who said it was the best she had ever had.

I ignored the mixing directions and combined dry ingredients, then added the wet ones.  Used almond milk and whole wheat flour.  Next time I will cut back on the sugar.  Best and easiest cornbread ever!

I made this recipe for the first time with dinner tonight.  The only adjustment I made was the amount of sugar added.  I used less due to some of the comments made by other reviewers and that part didn't go over too well with the kids so they drizzled a little honey on it.   Other than that they said it was really good and better than the boxed cornbread!  This is a keeper, thanks!

This was not only very delicious but VERY easy! I only needed to use one bowl - and it took less than 5 minutes to prep and the rest was just baking time. Definitely was a huge hit in our house and I love when I only need to do minimal work for maximum impact!

I really liked this recipe. I made muffins with it instead of the cake, the time for them is thirteen to fifteen min. I also didn't melt the butter in a pan, I just threw it in the microwave. I definitely will be making this again.

I had never made corn bread before and I was so pleasantly surprised. I will never buy a box mix again. This was moist and so so good! My family devoured it.

Made as directed with no changes and it’s pretty delicious. Cooked slightly less than 30min in an 8” square pan. Nice crust fresh out of the oven and my whole house smelled like butter and awesomeness. Thought it was not as sweet as anticipated but was just right for me. Maybe a teeny bit more salt next time, but very good.

We really enjoyed this cornbread recipe.  I have made this recipe many times, and always get great results. To suit our taste, I added 2/3 cup of frozen corn to the mix. Here's a tip you might appreciate: When I buy buttermilk, I always pour 1 cup portions in sandwich bags to freeze for when I need buttermilk. Before, I could never use up my buttermilk, and it always went bad. Now, I finish every carton to the last drop. It thaws out fairly quickly if you put it in a bowl of water.  When thawed, it might look a bit separated, but  just shake it up to incorporate again. Using it in recipes like this or others, hasn't made any difference in the quality or taste of the baked goods.

This is a great cornbread recipe! I used a 10 in black iron skillet, followed the recipe exactly and baked @ 375 for 37 minutes. I tasted the batter and was afraid it was going to be too sweet, but after baking, the sugar caramelized around the edges and on the bottom crust. Great crunch!! My husband told me that this was the best cornbread is ever made (I'm 64 and a really good cook)?? and he told me to throw my other cornbread recipes.  It's great cornbread! Thank you!!

BETHANYWEATERSBY, this is the best corn bread I have ever made!  Thank You!
I made this tonight for tomorrow's New Years dinner, but HAD to try it!  It's so moist, not too sweet, just delicious!
I didn't change a thing!  It is absolutely perfect just like the recipe is written. 
Some people have  a problem with it not being a Southern corn bread...This is NOT a Southern corn bread recipe !  There ARE other recipes on this site that are.  Just my 2 cents.
Happy New Year!

My guests and I liked it.  I happen to use blue cornmeal, which worked fine.  I like that it came out firm.  I took it out of the oven on the early side, which I think was a good move.  We liked the fact that it was a little bit sweet.

I made this exactly as directed. It came out very good.  It is more like a cake because of the amount of sugar.  If I make it again, I will cut the sugar down to 1/2 cup and up the salt to 2 teaspoons.

I liked the texture, and the recipe was quite easy.  However, it is a bit on the sweet side.  I like to actually taste the buttermilk in my cornbread.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar quite a bit.  

It's not bad, but more like a cake than cornbread.

Terrific cornbread and the tastiest of several recipes I've tried. This is the only recipe I'll make from now on though.  Reduced the sugar slightly because not much for sweet and had no buttermilk so subbed with sour cream thinned out with just under a cup of milk. Thanks for the great recipe!!

With the exception of eliminating sugar (just can't do it), and using milk + vinegar instead of buttermilk (only because I didn't have any) this recipe is perfect. The crispiness of the butter baked in the cast iron skillet makes this quite unique and wonderful. I will definitely try it again with buttermilk.

This recipe is awesome. Moist and tasty cornbread that doesn't fall apart when you slice it. I use a cast iron skillet, start with melting the butter, turn off heat then add buttermilk and eggs and quickly add dry ingredients. Then I pop it in the oven. Always turns out great! However, someone mentioned to me recently that he heats up his iron skillet in the oven first, mixes the ingredients aside then adds to the hot skillet and returns to the oven. I have yet to try this. He says that it makes the edges more crispy.

I added a tsp of vanilla and sprinkled smoked paprika on top and placed tamed jalapeños on half of the bread.  This was the best recipe for cornbread I've ever made!  I used an 8 x 8 metal pan and mine was done after 23 minutes.  Make sure to watch yours!  We'll use this recipe every time!

Very simple yet quite tasty. Lends itself well to tweaks, I made it with only 1/4 cup sugar. The main thing is that it is reasonably moist and not prone to crumbling. By all means fry up some bacon or sausage in a cast iron skillet first, pour the batter into the grease on the stovetop, wait until the edges start to pull back and then pop it into the oven.

You could very easily add some caramelized onion, finely chopped jalapeño, some extra corn meal, and make hush puppies.

I've been making this now for awhile. Very often I use it for large gatherings. I multiply the recipe by 6 and make it in a 16X24 pan. Comes out absolutely amazing.   Last week I served butttered corn the nite before I made the cornbread and had a lot leftover so I puréed it and added four cups to my batter for a 16x24  pan.   It was wonderfully moist and had a great texture.   Everyone loved the flavor the corn added to the bread.   I will continue to make this cornbread. It's always a big hit among cornbread lovers and even non cornbread lovers.

Easy and simple recipe to make.  Thought it would compliment the chili I made with it, but actually was the other way around; the chili complimented it!  What more can I say, but that it was delicious, without tweaking the recipe a bit!

Very good, but a bit sweet and cake like.  The recipe fills a 9" cast iron skillet well. I will try it in a 10.25" CI skillet next time for a thinner version.   Half recipe might be a good fit for an 8" or two 6" skillets.  Thanks for the recipe.  It's very good as is, and a good one to adjust or experiment with.  I am thinking of reducing the sugar and adding a few minced jalapenos in the next one.

Absolutely the BEST cornbread ever!  I used my medium cast iron skillet.  I put some vegetable oil in the bottom and put it in the oven while it preheated. Poured the batter in and cooked as directed, maybe a bit less. You have to check it about 5 min before time. Turned it onto a plate immediately and sliced it into pie wedges!  Simply DELISH!!!  Will use this recipe forever!

Search no more for a cornbread recipe! I'd make this a 10 star if I could!  
Sure, you could lessen the sugar, but don't. It's perfect just the way it is! The crumb is just perfect...probably due to the buttermilk. 
I did everything in the same pan I baked it in. Micro'ing, and swirling melted butter up sides of pan to coat it, then mixing the ingredients as stated. While it seemed odd, I promise, it worked great! It DIDNT stick to a 8x8 glass pan. Popped right out. Wasn't dry at all! Next time tripling, and freezing! 
Thanks for sharing this with the world!

I really liked this corn bread! It mixed up very quickly, and was moist and delicious!  It is very forgiving! I had no buttermilk, so I made *clabber milk using whole milk, and it worked great! As I was taking the cornbread to a dinner, I lined my 9" baker with parchment paper, so I could remove it easily and cut it into even servings. I definitely will make it again! 
*Clabber milk- 1 Cup whole milk mixed with 2 teaspoons white vinegar. Let sit until thickened.

Made this for dinner tonight to accompany chili and it was delicious!!! I didn't have any buttermilk so I put a tablespoon of vinegar in my one cup measure and then filled it up with milk. I then followed the rest of the recipe except I used my cast iron pan. I oiled it up and put it in the oven as it preheated. Baked it for 25 minutes at 375 and it was perfect!!

I first made this recipe when I was on the cooking committee to serve lunch to about 35 hungry missionaries. They gobbled it up! It is now my favorite corn bread recipe. It comes out moist, buttery and just sweet enough especially good when eating a spicy meal like chili or taco salad. When serving the luncheon I used real buttermilk but at home I didn't have it and used 1 tablespoon of white vinegar with enough milk added to make 1 cup and it worked out fine. This recipe is easy and does not disappoint.

If I could give this recipe 3 more stars I would. Depending on who I'm cooking for, I reduce the amount of sugar. The other thing I do (not that this recipe needs more butter) is place about 3-4 tablespoons of butter to melt in the pan I'll be baking the cornbread in. If you place that pan in the oven until the butter sizzles, it will fry the edges of the cornbread batter. This gives it those crispy fried corners that everyone loves.

I didn't have buttermilk on hand, so I used half Greek yogurt/half milk.  Worked fine!  First time my husband did not complain about me not using the little boxed sweet cornbread mix.  We think it's delicious!!!

I was looking for a gooey recipe (maybe with cheese and jalapeños)but this had so many good ratings I decided to try it.  This was so delicious and so easy!!   I rarely make cornbread, but this will be my go-to from now on.

I used coarse ground corn meal and only cooked it for 30 minutes, using a circular glass pie dish.  It looked a little pale at the 30 minute mark, which made me wonder if it was fully cooked.  I poked a thin knife into the bread in a few different spots, it kept coming out clean so I let it sit on the counter with foil over the top until dinner.  Everyone said that it was the moistest best textured cornbread that I have made yet.  I agree

First of all, I disagree with the "no true Southerner puts sugar in their cornbread" comment. I am as Southern and as country a cook as you will find. Raised in central Louisiana on a farm by a woman who wasn't afraid to cook anything lol. My momma always put a little sugar in her cornbread and I have had plenty of old Southern cooks who liked it sweet and some who didn't. Why do some folks feel the need to be so condescending? This is a fabulous recipe, as is. As a matter of fact, it is now this family's favorite (including the old ones). Thanks for a great recipe! God bless!!

Oh, my, this was good! I didn't have buttermilk, so I soured some milk with vinegar first. I used an oven-safe pan to melt the butter and after adding the sugar,  I dumped it into a bowl and continued with the recipe. No sooner had I dumped it back into the pan, I decided I wanted corn in it. So I threw in a can of sweet corn. What the heck, right? Maybe it would work. Living dangerously in the kitchen. Anyways, In about 22 minutes it was golden brown, just how I like it. From past experience, I was afraid I'd over cooked it, but it was still very moist.  Wooo hoo, I finally made some decent cornbread!

Forgot to mention, I used Lily white flour, like I use for biscuits. Lily flour is just awesome.

Hello Bethany, thank you so much for sharing your Grandmother's special recipe for cornbread.  I have been trying different cornbread recipes throughout the past year, trying to find one I can make whenever I serve my chilli & my shepherd's pie....they go great together!

 Always check on your baked goods at the first minute marker given. For example, bake 30 to 40 minutes.... you check it at 30 minutes. Everyone's oven varies, altitudes vary, the flour you use  makes a difference in bake time...even the pan you use can make a difference. If it's not completely done, I would suggest continuing to bake in 1 to 2 minute intervals until completely baked.

No, I did NOT make any changes, and yes, I WILL make it again - just as it's published with a slight alteration to the steps of ingredients.  I melted the butter in my mixing bowl (glass) in the microwave, then added the sugar, then added the buttermilk in order to cool the butter/sugar mixture to ensure the egg doesn't "cook" in my slowness, then added the egg, and then followed everything else in the order published by the original author.  We absolutely LOVED it and care not a whit whether or not a "true Southerner" would or would not add sugar - we just like good food and the taste speaks for itself!

I have made this recipe all my life as it was handed down from my mother. She put sugar in everything to enhance the flavor, not sweeten it(and she grew up in Mississippi) only change I made was to add 1 tsp. of baking powder to add fluffiness. This recipe is incredible!

I first made this cornbread about 2 weeks ago.  I made a double batch and froze the second batch. I was a little hesitant about freezing, because I usually don't like any type of "bread" product being frozen....seems to make it too dry when it is reheated. Not this recipe! I reheated the frozen batch and it was just as delicious as a fresh batch. Tonight, I'm making 4 batches to freeze...it's seriously that good! Bethany, this is now the ONLY cornbread recipe that I will be making. Thank you!

I read the less desirable reviews and I don't understand how most of them said it was too sweet, then again, I like my cornbread sweet. There were also complaints of it being dry. I didn't encounter that with this recipe. So delicious straight out of the oven with some butter! I'm sure my friends at the chili dinner tonight will love them just as much too.

Delicious!  I followed recipe and OPs suggestion of doing it all in one pan. I need to get a smaller pan so my bread is a bit thicker.

FABULOUS!  I reduced the sugar, but made up for it with maple syrup.  My husband, our 85 year old neighbor (lots of experience eating cornbread...) and I loved it.  Moist, yet a little crumbly; just like it's supposed to be.

No true Southerner would be as rude as Kay! Never mind people who have no tact, Bethany. I despise cornbread with no sugar in it. THANK YOU for sharing just what I was looking for. They were delicious.

Excellent! Made with half amount of sugar in recipe because we don't like it too sweet. Also didn't have buttermilk so I added vinegar to a bit less than 1 cup milk and let it sit for a while to curdle before using. Baked in 8 inch round cake pan for 30 mins only. This was just what I was looking for and we all loved it. My kids inhaled it! Served with chili. Yummmmmm!

I loved cornbread when I lived in the US and recently have been craving it so I was so pleased to find this recipe.  It has turned out so well and is absolutely delicious.  I think its sweeter than I had previously eaten but can easily be slightly adjusted. As for the bread from my first bake my friends and I are devouring it still warm from the oven with a nice cup of tea. Many thanks Bethany

Excuse me, but I think you left your magical powers in this recipe. I am not usually super crazy about cornbread but my husband on the other hand, is nuts about it. There's a restaurant where he grew up that he swears is famous for their cornbread and he's never had anything that even came close to that, until now. He's so grateful, that he did the dishes and the laundry!

I have always made crappy cornbread, but I made this one this morning and wow I feel like a expert with cornbread now. I did change it a little bit with the butter milk, I used reg 2% milk, used unsalted butter, and last but not least just a pinch of salt. I did double the recipe so I could put in a 9 x 12 pan. Thank you so much for a great cornbread.

It was a little to sweet, next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup. Other than that it was a good recipe. Made in small #6 iron skillet in oven, and had enough batter left to do three muffins. I used evaporated milk and vinegar to make the buttermilk and it made a nice thick buttermilk. I will make again, with less sugar.

I made this last night for my husband's birthday dinner; served it with caldillo (green chile stew.) It was a big hit; everybody loved it. My "foodie" brother in law was impressed; another one wanted to know how it was made. The kids wanted more! Definitely easy and a keeper.

This is definitely a five star recipe! We make this recipe all the time! I make it in a pre-heated cast iron skillet and bake it for 25 minutes. It gets the perfect golden brown crust. Absolutely delicious!

First, I would like to thank the chef and Granny.  I have made this cornbread for an elderly "southern" gentleman who is in poor health.  He doesn't want to eat anything except this bread.  I am glad I found this recipe...I makes him very happy!  My family and I have enjoyed it also.  The only thing I do different is beat the eggs prior to putting in the pan.

Wow! I am impressed. We have significant dietary restrictions in our family, so I tweaked the recipe significantly, yet it still came out fabulous!
I subbed rice milk+lemon juice for the buttermilk, applesauce for the sugar, and spelt for the flour.
Wow! Definitely a keeper! Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding recipe, and very easy.  I use whole wheat flour, cut the butter to 1/3 cup, and the sugar to 1/2 cup.  My family has no idea I cut calories.  Excellent recipe they love to know I have it on the menu.

I doubled the recipe except for reduced sugar to 1 cup, and used a 9" x 13" stoneware. Baked at 400° for 30 minutes. Took to a chili potluck and it was a huge hit. It is sweet, and I may reduce sugar more next time. The buttermilk and melted butter add good moisture, unlike many cornbread recipes.

Tried this recipe today and used the whole wheat flour. The cornbread had a nice crunch but was most and flavorful. I had all the ingredients except the buttermilk so I did what my mom use to do. I added 1 TBS. of white vinegar into my 1-cup measuring cup, filled it the rest of the way with 1% milk, stirred, and let it sit for 5 minutes while I put the rest of the ingredients together. It worked like a charm and I baked it for 35 minutes and it turned out perfect. My brother had the cornbread with the meal and he even commented how good it tasted. That really made my day because he is a very finicky eater and very difficult to cook for. Believe me...this is a great recipe.

We're not huge fans of cornbread, but that's changed with this recipe! I used about 1/3 wheat flour 2/3 white and decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup without problems. Also used good quality cornmeal, so you can really taste the corn flavor. Thanks for sharing. This is excellent!

I love this recipe! It turned out great. My oven is weird so I had to cook it for less time but other than that I had no problems and everyone enjoyed it. :)

Great cornbread recipe. My family loves it. It's a sweet cornbread (which we love) but can be adjusted with results that are just as good. Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I made 3 different recipes on one night. This one was the best to my taste, but then I am a "yankee" so the northern (sweet) corn bread was better for me than the souther (no sugar) recipe I made. The kids loved it. Not overly sweet. I made it exactly as the recipe described except I didn't get all the complicated mixing instructions. I just mixed it all and put it in a greased 8x8 pan. Kept it simple. May make it again but will be looking for a less dense recipe more like the Jiffy corn muffin mix but from scratch. ;)

Tried this last night and loved it.  The few modifications I made was to melt the butter in the microwave, didn't have any buttermilk at home so I put a tablespoon of white vinegar in a cup of milk and let it sit for 5 minutes, and I cut the sugar down to just half a cup.  Was done in 30 minutes and tasted great.  It was still moist and the right amount of sweet.

I'm not sure what it is, but I've made this twice now, and it always comes out flat. Not at all like the picture. My daughter in law had the same problem. After the second time, I looked at the recipe on the cornmeal package and it called for baking powder not baking soda. Could this be the problem? Nobody else seemed to have this problem.

I've made this recipe about 3 times.  It was delicious.  I have made an adjustment.  Accidentally, I used 1c of self rising flour (doubled the recipe).  I went ahead and baked the cornbread and my daughter, who doesn't eat cornbread is now a convert!  She said it tasted light and wasn't dry or heavy.

This cornbread is really wonderful when it's right out of the oven, but very dense & heavy once it has cooled. It is a great recipe that you can tweak to your liking. I've made it as is twice & I'm testing different ratios of the ingredients to achieve the lighter crumb I'm after. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! So much more moist than the standard recipe I had been using. The only thing I varied from the recipe was melting my butter in the microwave instead of a skillet. Everything else I followed to the letter. Sooooo good. I will not be going back to my old recipe!

I have made this twice now and it has turned out amazing both times. Best cornbread my husband and I have ever had. We even made our own cornmeal to use in it which added a whole new level of awesome. =) Totally delicious. Crumbly to just to level cornbread should be but not dry. Sweet enough to eat it plain but not too sweet that you can't drizzle it with honey. Love love love!

Made this yesterday. I used 1/2c regular flour and 1/2 whole wheat flour and regular milk with a bit of lemon juice. It came out pretty good. It was a little drier than expected but I think that may have been due to using the wheat flour (or I'm used to southern corn bread). Overall, I'd make it again and my husband approved.

Awesome recipe! I've made this multiple times and my parents have loved it! I used 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup because it was a little too sweet for me. (Tonight I decided to make 2 batches because my family loves it so much, but I accidentally used Baking Powder instead of Baking Soda for both. The bread didn't rise as well.. so don't accidentally use Baking Powder!!)

This is the recipe you want, just good basic cornbread.  I skipped the saucepan step and melted the butter in the microwave for one minute in a mixing bowl.  Then I and added all the ingredients to that bowl.  Made clean up even easier.

This is the way we like cornbread.  Moist, not too grainy, a hint of sweetness, and a perfect ratio of flour to cornmeal.  I'm not quite sure I would go to all the trouble making it as written.  I whisked the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then added the wet ingredients, folding lightly just until blended.  It came out perfect.  A definite keeper.

I read a review about being southern and this was not a good corn bread.  Well horse hockey.. this is a fabulous recipe.  I am born, bred and now retired here in the south.  And I have to admit that I never liked cornbread before made any other than the Southern way.... but this is a great recipe.  I took a chance cause I like to try new and different recipes and this was sooooo very worth it.  I thought it went perfectly with my little, butt portion, ready to eat ham.  And for breakfast with milk and warmed a touch in the micro.

For literally years I have resigned myself to cornbread that falls apart when you try to get in out of the pan, much less when you try to slap on some butter. This recipe is not only delish it holds together! Last night my husband said "well you finally found a keeper." Thank you Bethany. You've brought cornbread back into my life. 2/4/16-I just wanted to add that I AM a Southerner and I have always used sugar in my cornbread and my Mam'ma did too. That was one of the reasons I liked this recipe. If you don't like a recipe, that's ok, but don't come off all superior acting. Cornbread is cornbread, it's not THAT important. I enjoy the comments and improvements on my recipe.

My sister made this for a family "Chili Night" and I have to say it was the best Cornbread I have ever eaten. It was moist and perfect. The only thing she did differently was to reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup. It was sweet, but not overly so. Highly recommend this recipe.

Made this to bring for Thanksgiving.  It was a hit.  Very delicious, not dry, and just a hint of sweetness from the sugar.  I really should have made a double batch since everyone ate it.  I'm going to make this regularly for myself.  The little amount of time and effort it takes to make this from scratch instead of using a box mix is SO worth it.  I think next time I make I'm going to try adding a can of cream corn and see how it comes out.

Amazing cornbread! I followed the recipe as is except for reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup as other reviewers recommended. It was delicious with only a hint of sweetness. Also, used a 9 inch square pan and it was done in 25 minutes. Moist, delicious and a great addition to our Thanksgiving dinner. Next time I would either find an 8 inch pan or if still using the 9 inch, bake it only 20 minutes to ensure that the side pieces were as moist as the center pieces.

Solid cornbread recipe. I use this for a cornbread sausage stuffing recipe. I triple this recipe, cube the bread and let sit out for 3 or 4 days before thanksgiving to get stale for the stuffing. Its amazing every time :)

Made 1xs as listed. Made it 2xs more with only 1/2 c sugar and no problem esp since we like honey butter on the finished product! Very dense and cake like. Nice taste, easy recipe, thank you!

Finally I have the best cornbread recipe and all the others will be thrown out.  I was lucky enough to have some fresh buttermilk donated by my sisterinlaw who was then lucky enough to enjoy this outstanding cornbread with us.  I added 3/4 cup frozen corn (thawed) and I decreased the sugar a little but next time would put even less sugar, that is, unless I substitute some whole wheat which is an excellent idea.  Good to know it freezes well too.  Thanks.

Just right...not too sweet and was moist and buttery. (I didn't even have to put butter on it.) It also had a nice slightly crispy crust.

This is it! The perfect sweet cornbread recipe! Something soo simple and perfect. I make exactly this recipe and pour the mixture into 2 five inch round corningware dishes and pop 'em in the toaster oven to get more toasty oven goodness with a perfect moist center. I am sure this bread along with the copious amounts of butter i slather on it, will be the death of me. Smiling to the end!

Made this cornbread yesterday.....it wasn't as moist as I had hoped, put oven 5 degrees less than specified due to my oven being very hot - also, cornbread by nature isn't the most moist bread to begin with.  Wasn't too sweet at all - was expecting it to be super sweet because of the comments - the sweetness was perfect.  Would make this again!

I have used this recipe many times. My family loves it. I live it the south but I like my cornbread sweet. Most of the cornbread you get in around here is not very good at all and very dry tasting. Also instead of all purpose flour and baking powder I just use 1 cup of self rising flour and it comes out perfect. Thank you so much for the recipe..

I've been baking cornbread for over 30 years and decided to make this tonight to go with red beans and rice. My family and I agree this is absolutely the best cornbread I've ever made. I didnt change a thing, followed recipe exactly. This is going to become my go-to recipe from now on. Thank you for sharing!

I used the wheat flour alternative and decreased the sugar to one half cup.  I baked it in a 6x10 pan. It baked in about 30 minutes.  I have been baking many versions of corn bread for years and find this one of the best!.  My husband and son agreed. Great recipe.

Great recipe! Family loved it. We even ate the last few pieces the next day as a snack, and it was almost like cake. I had to substitute a little of the buttermilk for regular milk, but it was still delicious. Will definitely be making this recipe again!

Made exactly as is- first time, doubled the recipe and it turned out great, even the bake time was exact. Also put these in greased muffin tins for serving sizes and it was a huge hit! Thanks for the awesome recipe.

aweseome recipe! we've made only a few small changes. 2/3 cup of sugar is way too much. we use 1/2 and it is still sweet and yummy. at 2/3 is was unpleasant to eat, but 1/2 is perfect. also, we use whole wheat pastry flour in place of the white flour, and i brown the butter before mixing the sugar in. in my oven, it's done in 25 minutes--way less the 40 it takes for grandma. :) and good thing! because this has become my little son's favorite food. he has me make it at least twice a week. thank you for the wonderful recipe!

o, and one more thing: instead of buying buttermilk just for this recipe we use 1/2 cup of plain yogurt and 1/2 cup of milk for the liquid. 

thanks again!! love it!!!

Have made this so many times, always gets great reviews!  Kept recipe exactly as listed.   I do find with my convection oven bakes fast, so I cut the cook time so it stays moist.

Doubled the batch as some suggested to freeze it... never made it to the freezer so good.

We also made some mini ones with hot dogs in them delicious. Only used half a cup of sugar and it was enough.

Will make this again for sure.

This was great. Everyone raved. I grilled 2 cobs of corn and added the kernels. It added the wow factor. I also doubled the recipie and baked in a 9 by 13 dish.

I have made this recipe so many times now. It is definitely my go-to cornbread recipe. I love that it's all mixed up in a pan before baking. Makes for a super easy, quick, and delicious add-on for dinner.

Wow!  I normally READ the reviews without contributing.  However, this deserves RAVES!! AS I'm sure so many other recipes do on this site.  This one sent me right here.  It's just the right texture (I'm all about texture) delicate sweetness and density.  I made bundt muffins with this recipe and they were delectable.  My hubby had his with honey (yikes!) but nevertheless, mighty good!  Can't go wrong with this one ladies and gents.

I did cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup because we're trying to reduce sugar in our household, but this cornbread is amazing. Followed the recipe to a T and I love, love, love how this holds up. It's not crumbly, it's thick and moist. Yum! Writing this down to become part of my permanent collection of recipes.

So good - I too will stop searching for a good cornbread recipe! I used gluten-free flour, and, miracle of miracles, these little babies rose and were spongy and golden! I made 6 oversize muffins (you know, the ones in the silicone muffin mold) and 12 mini-muffins. The little ones needed 16 minutes, and the bigger ones took 23 minutes. So perfect, even the baby gobbled them up. Thanks - must be the buttermilk!

Excellent recipe. i substituted brown sugar for white sugar and used corn flour vs corn meal for a smoother texture. but it came out very good.  the true test is when i take it to the office picnic tomorrow...

11/27/2014 - tried it with the cornmeal and it was great, i still used the brown sugar though.  and i used a muffin tin instead of a pan, so for that it took about 15 minutes a pan. check on the brownness and use a toothpick to test doneness.

i'd still give it 5 stars because i don't know of "Southern cornbread" i'm from Maryland, if it tastes good, i'll eat it.

I'd never made cornbread before and don't cook much of anything. Tried this bc my bf loves cornbread, and the recipe worked really well for me. I mixed it all in one big pot as Bethany suggested and followed the directions (doubling everything for 2 pans worth)... it was just right, not too sweet and not dry, imho. And the cornbread fan approved! Thanks for an easy cornbread recipe.

Used 1/4 c smart balance and 1/2 c applesauce and whole wheat flour and truvia bakeing blend, other than that no changes. Came out to 127 kcal per 1/12th of recipe, served with chili, no leftovers! Was wonderful and very easy, mine was not dry and had a great texture not too dense. Will make every time I make chili. Thank you!!

This is now a staple bread when making soup or chilli. I use 1/3 cup of sugar instead of the 2/3 called for and find it just right for my taste buds.

I liked this recipe, but I came up with a few edits. First of all, they were a bit dry, so I used 1 1/3 cups of buttermilk, instead of 1 cup. Second of all, I used 1/3 cups white sugar, instead of 2/3. But other than that, it was wonderful. All the muffins I have made with the modified recipe came out great and got rave reviews!

This recipe is wonderful! I use a cast iron skillet and preheat in the oven with my butter in it. After it melts I mix the butter in with my batter mix. Then I put back into the hot cast iron to cook in the oven. Makes the perfect crust every time!!

Thank you for the recipe.  I had to make it gluten free. So I substituted 2 Tablespoons potato starch and the balance oat flour for the 1 cup of wheat flour.  Turned out awesome.  Grandma's recipes are always the best.  Even used my Grandma's old cast iron frying pan to bake it.
By the way, I detest when people say they changed every ingredient in the recipe and then didn't like it....

Usé 1\2 tz de azúcar en vez de 2\3 tz,y hornee en el microondas en molde de cupcakes individuales, hornee cada bizcochito por 1:00 minuto, la receta es excelente pero me gustaría qué quedara más esponjosa. (=  I used 1 \ 2 cup of sugar instead of 2 \ 3 cup, and bake in the microwave in individual mold cupcakes, bake each Bizcochito by minute 1:00, the recipe is excellent but I would do remain more fluffy.)

This cornbread is amazing!  It was fluffy and cake-like and delicious.  I added some corn kernels to the mixture but kept the other ingredients the same.

I don't own a cast iron skillet but I almost always use stoneware when baking (Parini) and it gives the cornbread that lovely crust on the sides and bottom.  I love this recipe and I will never use another one. It was effortless to throw together and came out perfectly moist and buttery. The only problem is you better exercise ALL of your will power when it comes out of the oven because you're going to want to grab some butter and stand there eating the whole darn thing. You've been warned!!

This recipe doesn't really need another rave review.  But, it's super.  It turns out wonderfully.  Restaurants should start using this recipe !  It's always good with added peppers, or spread with pepper jelly.  Yummy, yummy.

This recipe (sugar and all) was a perfect accompaniment to chili.  It had a nice moist crumb and I did not find it excessively sweet,  Being from Canada, I have zero expertise in the characteristics of a "real" Southern cornbread but I take the word of those in the know that this doesn't qualify.  I think anyone looking for more of a "cake" type cornbread would like this one.  I think it could be easily customized by adding cheddar, green chiles and/or corn (for a Tex Mex take) or perhaps berries (for a sweeter variation).  I will definitely make this again and again.

Followed the recipe exactly, other than added white vinegar to whole milk bc I didn't have buttermilk. It was the best cornbread I've made. It was not too sweet and so moist! It was so easy I will never purchase box mix again. Thanks for sharing.

I just made some homemade chili and wanted a great corn bread recipe to go with it and this one was perfect.    Not to sweet and not to salty, it came out perfectly.   And, thank's to all for their comments, I like to review and try out some of the tweaks, which made the recipe come out even better.

The recipe is perfect as it is. I'm always amazed by people who are so critical and change it up to something completely different- and brag about how wonderful "their version" is. Great recipe Bethany! I'll get a lot of use out of this recipe. It's such a nice extra to so many dishes!

I made this recipe just as written and it was delicious!! it's a sweet corn bread but that's no surprise since it has 2/3 cups of sugar.   I mixed the ingredients in one pan so clean up was easy.  we ate it with our chili tonight and it was perfect.  thanks for taking the time to share the recipe! I will be saving this one :)

Not only is this the best Cornbread recipe I've ever tried, it's the best cornbread I've ever tasted. Not grainy or overly dry, it's perfectly fluffy & has the perfect amount of sweet for my palette.  I melted the butter and added the sugar in the saucepan, but then I poured it in my stand mixer and finished the recipe in that. It went perfect with my steak chili.

Overall, this is good--and NOT cakelike at all, but definitely too sweet for my taste.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and could reduce it further.  I mixed it up as I always do for quickbreads--stir together dry ingredients in one bowl and wet in another while melting the butter in the oven in my cast iron frying pan, mix wet & dry then the butter, and into the frying pan & into the oven.

My husband LOVED this cornbread!  I liked the consistency, and the crust/edges had a nice crisp to them.  Although we don't usually eat sweet cornbread (yes, it's a long held southern view that only Yankees put sugar [of any amount] in cornbread), this was a nice accompaniment to our meal.  I will make it again, just be sure to pair it with appropriate foods.  Appreciate the updates from the author, and since it came out exactly as described, I think anyone having serious problems with this is not following the directions.

100% awesome!  This is the best cornbread I've ever had ~ and I even made them with whole wheat flour.  I also substituted milk and a teaspoon of lemon juice for the buttermilk.   Each time I've made them (as muffins), they came out moist, a little sweet, and oh-so-yummy that  my two teenagers gobbled them up and asked for more.  It's definitely a family favorite now!

This recipe is perfect as written and in my opinion, not too sweet.  I even served it with a side of honey butter.  I read another reviewer's comments and made them into muffins...375 for 20 minutes and they turned out perfectly.  I couldn't have asked for anything better.  Thank you so much for posting this amazing recipe.

This recipe is an "Award Winning"! My in-laws have an annual Chili Cook Off Party for friends and family. There are Five Categories and a trophy for each category winner:  Chili, Soup, Salad, Bread and Dessert. This year, I "competed" in the bread category and baked a double batch of this delicious cornbread. WINNER! My trophy sits proudly on my mantle as I write this review. Everyone voted for this cornbread -- it won hands down over artisan breads of varying deliciousness. Bethany, I confess when asked where I got the recipe I simply said, "Oh, it's Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread". Thanks for a truly delicious recipe that goes GREAT with Chili, anything else, or is great just by itself!!

This is heavenly! Sweet and moist with lovely browned edges. Love it with chili or navy bean soup, or as a snack, buttered and drizzled with honey. I prepared the recipe as is snd baked for 30 minutes. Perfect.

This was the first time I've made cornbread and it turned out great! Just make sure you follow the recipe and melt the butter completely. If the butter isn't fully melted your bread will turn out dense (as I unfortunately discovered on a subsequent attempt at making this recipe). But, as written, this recipe is so tasty!

Replaced the all purpose flour with gluten free and it turned out really good, moist, sweet and buttery. Since I didn't have buttermilk I also used the trick of adding vinegar to the milk. Wonderful!

Awesome! I saw the previous reviews about this being too sweet but followed the recipe exactly. My husband loved it, but I thought it was too sweet. So now, one time he gets it his way and the next I make it with no sugar, and it still turns out wonderful and moist. Also, "southern" cornbread has more cornmeal than flour, and doesn't use eggs, but I prefer this recipe because it is so versatile. I now use this as the basic recipe for so much more...bacon grease in the bottom of the pan (a touch of southern roots), jalapeno and cheddar, tamale pie...so many variations to try. This is definitely a simple, "go to" recipe that I will have in my cookbook as a staple.

My family love this cornbread. I've made it with the sugar and I've made it with honey instead of sugar. Personally, I prefer making it with honey. I like more of a Southern cornbread where it isn't sweet but my family prefers sweeter so I use this recipe for them.  Thank you for sharing it, they always look forward to me making cornbread!

I've served this cornbread to some very finicky dinner guests and it's always a hit. I've used Bob's Red Mill cornmeal, medium grind, rather than a finer grind cornmeal and it produces a great texture with a wonderfully light texture, with just a hint of crunch from the coarser cornmeal. I'm now the designated corn bread baker for our holidays meals, thanks to this recipe!

I usually don't like cornbread but I like this one.  For my most recent batch, I doubled the recipe and cooked it in an 11" cast iron skillet (which I preheated along with the oven).  I first checked it for done-ness at 30 min and it was certainly done, probably had been for at least 5 min (at least).

I made this just as recipe says. No alterations at all. I bake quite often, sometimes twice a week. I like to try new recipes. I do have my own cornbread recipe that my mom and my grandma made. However this recipe was great I loved it! My granddaughters loved it and so did my husband. But not as great as my families recipe. (LOL  :) Just joking) I don't usually put sugar in mine however, it was a different flavor. I will make again. Another recipe when I want a different flavor. Thanks for a great recipe.

This was FANTASTIC!! We like sweet, fluffy cornbread, and this certainly fits the bill! Not dry at all. I actually made it gluten-free using my own gluten free all purpose flour in place of the regular flour. Can't even tell it is gluten-free!

Absolutely fantastic! I made this to go with a giant pot of chili and it was a huge hit. I cooked mine in a muffin tin for 18-20ish minutes. Next time I may experiment with reducing the sugar, but as-is this recipe is the best I've ever had!

I lowered the sugar by 1/4 cup and baked in a glass dish, corn bread turned out really moist and perfectly sweet. I think baking in an cast iron dish would make this corn bread a 5 star.

This is a great cornbread recipe. Just enough sweetness with a slight crunch on the outside and a softness on the inside. It got eaten the minute it came out of the oven!! Had to make two more batches. Thanks grandma.

Real simple recipe to use. As I write this review, I am also enjoying the bread with cup of tea. I substitute butter milk with 1/4 cup milk and 3/4 yogurt. I like the crispy top and moist on the inside. Next time I will try using Splenda to cut down some calorie. Thanks Bethany for sharing this recipe.

goodbye Jiffy!

This thing is amazing. 
I mostly followed the recipe, including the suggestion to butter a skillet and put it in the heating oven while you prep the mix. 
I added a can of corn (drained) for some extra texture and corn-ness.
This is literally the first time I ate cornbread without putting any butter on it (or wanting to, anyway)... thought I *might* have to reduce it next time by a tad (it's really, really buttery... which besides its impact on my dress size, is always a good thing).

As written, I give this four stars because I think it is too sweet. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and still found it way too sweet. However, I thought the texture was excellent and the flavor really nice. I will make it again, reducing the sugar to 1/4 cup.

I reduced the sugar to 1/4C, used 1/2 C flour and 1 1/2 C cornmeal, baked in a pre-heated cast iron skillet and it was fantastic!  My family ate it up and requested it again the next day.

My wife's large Southern family (Tn & So Car) all use sugar in their cornbread.  Took this survey at last years family reunion.  So saying Southerners don't use sugar just does not hold water.  Using your hot, greased iron skillet then baking 35min at 375 degrees is a difference maker.  Wonderful cornbread!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Seldom am I one to EVER write a review...but this is JUST THAT GOOD!!! I  prepared it exactly as written and baked for 30 mins. it is PRECISELY the type of corn bread recipe I've been searching for. It has the perfect  moist texture and sweetness that our family enjoys. Although I'm a Texan, I'm not particularly fond of the more traditional dry, crumbly non sweet version. This is a KEEPER!!!

I am a true southerner and I do like my cornbread sweet my grandmother use to sweeten her cornbread with honey and topped it with honeybutter...Now if you like sweet cornbread follow directions if you like it slightly sweet use half the sugar if you are a "true southerner" like plain cornbread don't use the sugar at all...simple.  Now my family likes this cornbread and I melt my butter in a cast iron skillet and then pour my batter in (my grandmother always made it that way) it comes out the pan easy and have that nice buttery taste to it.

I made this recipe last night. It was entirely too sweet and too cakey. Baked in a cast iron skillet, it rose nicely and had a nice golden crust. Very moist.

I followed the recipe exactly and loved the finished product!!  This is the first time I have tried cornbread from scratch and thought it was very easy and tasted better than any box mix I have tried.  I would not make any changes and plan on making it again.

This has been my "go-to" recipe for cornbread. It's not a Southern cornbread! It's a Northern/New England style. The first time I made this, I felt it was a little too sweet. I like to use honey and butter on top of the cornbread. With the amount of sugar listed, it ended up a bit too sweet, so I cut back to 1/4 cup sugar and it's perfect for us. If you don't like sweet cornbread, this isn't the recipe for you. If you like moist, sweet cornbread, then I highly recommend you try this one!

I was tempted to reduce the amount of sugar like a few reviewers did but I remembered some very sage advice from Ms. Paula Deen that the first time you make a recipe you should follow it to the letter the if you want to make it your own do it later.  I am so glad I did!!  This is perfect cornbread!!! The sweetness level was perfect  I had previously never been able to make cornbread I resorted to the box.  I now have a "go to" recipe and for me there is no tweeking necessary!!  The empty pan spoke volumes as did the trips back for seconds!!

Seriously the best corn bread recipe because it's so easy and so delicious! I make my own honey butter (room temperature butter drizzled with honey and whipped together with a spoon) to serve with it and my family can't get enough!

This was easy, use a big skillet and double the recipe for 9x13 rectangular pan. Grease pan with shortening. Comes out 21/2 to 3 inches thick!! Tastes wonderful. Not too sweet but just right! Watch baking time to 20 min and stop after that when edges pull slightly away and are light brown.

Without question the best cornbread ever! I always make a double batch and freeze one - freezes perfect. It is slightly sweet, if you're not used to it, and ever so moist. Please try it!

As a Brit with an American husband who has lived here in the UK for 30 years, I've been looking for the perfect cornbread recipe - and I've finally found it. Hubby LOVES this cornbread, and it turns out beautifully every time. It keeps well (although it never lasts very long) and is easy to make.

I grew up eating cornbread the way my grandmother used to bake it.  This is more on the sweet-side than what she used to make, but it is still very delicious. This is definitely a pleaser for any true cornbread lover.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I use this recipe exclusively, and have for several years. I have made it so many different ways; sugar-free(Splenda or honey), butter-free(applesauce), gluten-free(sorghum instead of ap flour), dairy free(almond milk and vinegar) and many different combinations of those, not to mention exactly as it is written. No matter how I do it, it comes out GREAT every time.

This is the best. I don't understand the southern cornbread comments. I can't stand southern cornbread, the sugar from the cornbread ends up in the tea and the pecan pie. The nice crust taste from the cast iron pan is the heat caramelizing the sugar of course. This works with most of the combinations people like; Chile; ham; etc. I wouldn't do the REALLY southern thing of putting it in a glass of milk or buttermilk. The southern style does seem to suit that. Overdry is, most often, overcooked.

I don't have anything new to add to the previous reviews; like everyone else I just want to say how much I love this cornbread!  Sweet, moist, soft, and perfect, unlike all the other so-called "sweet" cornbread recipes I've tried. I love that it stays moist without oil, too.

Well, I was born, raised, and still live in the South, but I guess I'm not a true Southerner because I loved this recipe.  It's been my go to ever since I found it! I just reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, but otherwise great!

My family loves this cornbread!! I usually make these as the recipe states - which is great. The best part (other than the soft, delicious taste) is that I've only had to use one pot to make it in and then of course the cooking dish. This could be avoided though if you have a cast iron skillet, I think. Also, many times I have don't have buttermilk on hand so have to make adjustments. These have been the successful adjustments for no buttermilk: put 1 TB lemon juice in a measuring cup then add milk to the 1 cup marker and let stand for about 5-10 minutes.  Or recently I did not have enough milk !! I measured the milk I did have (about 1/2 cup) and added 1.5 Tsp of lemon and let that curdle for about 7 minutes and then added enough sour cream to make it a measured 1 cup. Then I found more milk (one of my kids left a small cup in the fridge from that morning and decided to throw that in) and then just added a bit more cornmeal in the pot (a heaping cup vs. just a cup pretty much) to make up for the wet/dry proportion. Also, this recipe goes great with red beans & rice!

This is absolutely the BEST cornbread, if'n ya like the sweet kind!! This is the only cornbread I make in my house.  I make this in my huge supersized lodge skillet and make it for 24 servings (we have 6 in our family) and it only lasts 2 days once it's made. I also make it for a breakfast/brunch by scattering whole, fresh blackberries over the top and pushing them down a bit into the batter and then sprinkling some "Sugar in the Raw" all over. It ends up being a great sweet treat for the kids and there's never a crumb left. Enjoy!

Made this for a cookout this weekend.  Never made cornbread before.  Thought this was really easy.  I made a double batch because of the number of people.  I mixed everything in one pot and it was so easy.  I split the recipe into 2 and put canned sweet corn in half to experiment. Both turned out great.  I got rave reviews.  My 8 year old thought it was too sweet though.  I will experiment next time and decrease the sugar a little (we compared it to the cornbread you get at Boston Market and it's way sweeter).  However, I liked it a lot.  I just like to experiment. Because I had made a double batch and only had 1 8inch pan, I put the rest in loaf pans.  Turned out great.  Oh, and they baked perfectly at 30 minutes (both batches, with and without the corn).

This is a good and easy recipe.  I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, the salt to 1/4 tsp because I used salted butter, and the butter to 1/4 cup.  The buttermilk gives it a very good flavor.

Very moist and delicious cornbread. Do not over bake! We added chopped jalapeños and shredded cheddar in the batter.  It was fabulous!  Better than the "famous" cornbread at Famous Dave's restaurant!

Didn't have buttermilk so I used the buttermilk powder and regular full fat milk. I always keep the powder on hand for pancakes as I can't get through the carton before it spoils.  Well, DARN GREAT I SAY!
Thank you very much Bethany's Grandmother!  5 big stars!

Very good. I've tried other buttermilk recipes and this was way better. Moist and good buttery flavor. I might try baking it at 350 next time because the edges were too brown. Will def make again!

This recipe is phenomenal.  Used it for cooking for our local homeless shelter.  Quadrupling the recipe fits in a full sized catering pan.  Also, the amount of butter you need is very forgiving.  You can double the butter and be okay.

I made this recipe exactly as shown - no substitutions.  Hubby loved it. He had not been a cornbread fan before but just raved about this recipe and said it was the best cornbread ever. The recipe's a keeper! Moist and tender, not at all crumbly and dry.

It is perfect as is...I love a moister, sweeter corn bread.  This reminds me of the cornbread I've had growing up.  I have also added some thawed frozen corn before and love it as well!

I had a recipe for years that I loved; it had creamed corn and buttermilk, and was cooked in an iron skillet- great stuff. 

One day I didn't have enough ingredients in the house to make my ole standby, so I came to allrecipes in search of a palatable substitute and found this one. OMG! This is the best cornbread I've had in years- it will replace my old recipe. I've already shared this recipe with others, and have made it several times.

It's easy, sweet, moist, and delicious! If you like a sweet cornbread, this is for you!

Great sweet cornbread. I had to substitute corn flour instead of cornmeal because I could not find cornmeal here in Ukraine. So I just used it instead of adding all purpose flour. Turned out great. I actually found myself liking the texture better. Not as crumbly. Also the recipe temperature in Celsius shows 175 degrees. This is really 345 degrees Fahrenheit. For European bakers you might want to bake this recipe at 190 degrees Celsius. Equal to 374 degrees Fahrenheit. Thanks for the great recipe!

we like this recipe. I don't eat refined sugar, so we substituted honey for the sugar and reduced it to 1/3 cup. it is very moist and delicious! I think that next time I make it, though, I will add a little more salt.

This is a fabulous recipe, no tweaking needed. I melted the butter in a large bowl in the microwave and then added the rest of the ingredients the poured it into the pan.  I baked it for 30 min and it came out perfect. The kids loved it with butter and honey. For me and my husband it was sweet and moist enough plain.

Yewoza! I am picky with corn bread. Too sweet, too dry, too crumbly, etc. I made this (30 min ago) it's still warm outta the oven and I am loving it. I used whole wheat four as the cook said he/she does, and added a hanful of frozen corn, but stayed true to the rest of the recipe. Oh yum yum yum. Easy enough to make with my 1 year old 'helping'too! It did take 40 min in the oven with the whole wheat exactly to the min, and comes perfectly out of the pan! My husband is due home for lunch in half an hour (corn bread and chili) and I am going to have a hard time not eating all the corn bread until then! Thank you so so much!

Fabulous corn bread. Use this recipe if you like a moist, dense, sweet corn bread. After making this many, many times, I have made a couple changes that make this corn bread the best I've ever had. I use half honey and half granulated sugar. I also put the baking dish, ungreased, into the oven while it preheats. When it is done preheating, I take the dish out, melt a small amount of butter in the bottom, and then pour the batter into the hot dish. This gives it a fantastic rise in the oven.

Perfect sweet cornbread!!!  This is so easy to make why would you buy a premix??  It is moist, sweet, no bitterness, and easy to freeze and take out what's needed!

I printed this recipe several years ago and it is my go-to recipe for cornbread.  I never keep buttermilk on hand but the substitute I use is 1 cup milk plus 1 tablespoon white vinegar, let sit 10 minutes.  I make sure to start with that step so it is ready when I need it.  I use an iron skillet, mix up the batter, and pop the whole thing in the oven.  

A few tips on some variations:
Using a cast iron skillet, preheat to 365 (I have gas) and cook for 25 minutes
For muffins, cook for 20-25 minutes

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I made muffins rather than the bread and baked them about 15 min.

I made this for home and it was so easy.  I read Bethany's review and did it in one bowl. I baked it as muffins and it took 20 min. It turned out perfect and got rave reviews from my taste testers. I used this same recipe the next morning to make 4 doz for a potluck.  I got rave reviews about how moist and flavorful the cornbread was.  I followed ingredients to the tee. Everything came out perfect.  I made so much I memorized the recipe. It was just that simple!!

best. ever.  You can leave out the sugar if you are southern, but the texture and flavor is still great and this recipe is easy to make.  I melt the butter in a cast iron skillet in the oven then pour the rest of the batter in to cook.  No other changes.  Comes out perfect every time.

Wonderful. Terrific. Fabuloso.....I loved it. I've always loved Jiffy Cornbread. But this evening we were having chilli and I hadn't anymore boxes of Jiffy. I have to admit; I like my cornbread sweet and buttery, so I was very skeptical. I followed the recipe as written with one small addition; I added  2 tbsps of brown sugar. Yummy Yummy Yummy . It was light, fluffy and just perfect. I will never buy another box of Jiffy in my life. Look no further, because this is it! Enjoy!!!

Leave out all the sugar except one TBS. (That's the Texas in me talking). Very fluffy and light. I use an 8" cast iron skillet, ptr-heated in the oven. Gives it an even browning on the bottom and a crispy edge. Use real butter!

Yummy! This is the kind of cornbread that I like. I am picky about cornbread. The buttermilk makes all the difference. It was so good with my white chicken chili. mmmmmmm.

I found the cornbread to be dense.  I changed the recipe some I added two teaspoons of baking powder and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I put all the dry ingredients together. I beat the eggs with a hand mixer for 30 to 40 seconds added to the butter and sugar along with the buttermilk, then added the liquids to the dry ingredients.  Poured everything into a cast iron skillet and baked until golden brown on the top. Just out of the oven I glided butter on the top. It was perfect.

Good - but definitely too sweet (and I'm from Georgia)!  Will follow other reviewers and reduce sugar to 1/2 cup next time.  And there will be a next time!

This is my Go To cornbread recipe since coming across it last year. Yes it is sweet but it's heavenly and moist as can be! A couple tips....I never have buttermilk on hand so I decrease the milk to 3/4 cup then stir in enough white vinegar to equal the full cup (about 2 Tbsps). I let this sit and "marinate" while I'm prepping everything (about 10 minutes or so) as it will turn in to some semblance of buttermilk. As for mixing the egg into the hot sugar-butter concoction I usually whisk the egg in a separate bowl then SLOWLY pour it into the skillet stirring briskly as I go. (I've accidentally scrambled my egg once and ruined the whole thing and had to start over). This recipe is a bit labor intensive until you learn the sequence but overall my family and I think it's worth the effort.

This recipe was GREAT! I just made some to use for a cornbread stuffing, but couldn't resist having a square to myself, it smelled SO good!!! I DID reduce the sugar a little, but other than that, this recipe is a winner! Thanks for sharing! :)

I've been using this recipe for a couple of years now, and I love this recipe, either by itself, or with a main dish. I like to make my milk sour by using cider vinegar, which I believe adds a nicer flavor than regular buttermilk. I also do everything in one dish; my 12 cast iron skillet! The wedges come out moist with crispy edges, but not cake like.

Wow, this is good stuff! Moist and delicious. I made a double batch to cut up for cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving. It kind of made me sad to mangle it like that, but I'm looking forward to seeing how the dressing turns out. Tip: I used dried buttermilk, which you can find in the baking aisle. I hardly ever use all of the real stuff when I buy it, so the dried buttermilk is nice to have on hand for recipes.

Can't stop making this recipe or eating it!!  I love that it is on the sweeter side.  I made it following recipe as is and it earned five stars.  I made it again using bestlife butter (50% less fat than butter) and 1 cup creamed corn.  It was even better! It added moisture, which I felt was an improvement.  It is the best cornbread recipe with or without these changes.  Thank you for sharing it.

A good, classic sweet cornbread recipe...(the people commenting on it not being authentic cornbread since it has sugar are so annoying...who said the southern variety is the real kind - recipes differ according to the region of the country) Ugh! But this is a wonderful dish - my family loved it.

I have never made cornbread before but I do love it. I thought I'd give this a whirl since the reviews were so high. This was fabulous I didn't change a thing just cooked it in a cast iron skillet and it came out perfect. Thanks for a great recipe this is a keeper.

This recipe is gorgeous, especially if you are careful to bake the bread in a well-seasoned skillet and choose the highest quality ingredients. For some the recipe is a little too sweet, so all you have to do is cut back to half a cup of sugar and you're good.

I made this recipe and added a teaspoon of vanilla -- it was awesome.
I also made honey pecan butter and served it with the cornbread.  Everyone that ate it raved about it.  Thanks for a great, simple recipe.

Husband said it was the best cornbread he's ever had.  Next time I'll cut down the sugar a tad.  It was a bit dry (I'm at altitude, and I don't adjust bread recipes, so it's my fault), so next time I will take it out at about twenty-eight minutes.  But overall it was absolutely delicious.  I will definitely be making this one for Thanksgiving.

I made this for the first time as a counterpoint to another cornbread recipe from this site.  I served both to guests for a chili supper.  Everyone loved this bread.  It is moist and holds together well yet still has a nice crumb.  It rose beautifully - a full 2 inches - and was perfectly done at 30 minutes.  It is a no frills recipe and provides a simple and delicately flavored bread.  It went well with the spicy chili and the next day (still moist and soft) it tasted great with a little smear of honey butter.  It's an easy recipe that comes together quickly and gives you a great return on your time investment.

I made cornbread for the first time in my life yesterday. I made this recipe along with another recipe that had creamed corn.  This recipe was our favorite!  It was a really nice color, texture and we realized that we prefer sweet cornbread over southern style.  It will be the one we use from now on.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.  It was delicious and easy to make.  Even my  picky 3 year old loved it!

My husband said it was the best cornbread he's ever had.  That earns this recipe 5 stars from me.  I added two diced jalepenos (most of the seeds and membranes removed) for a little kick.  This one is a keeper.

I made this last night as a side dish to some home made chili...It is deliciously sweet, moist, and rose to perfection. The key is following this recipe exactly..and not making substitutions. Put it in an 8x8 square pan if you like a nice thick piece of cornbread. It is wonderful slathered with butter. I cooked mine for the full 40 minutes. Be sure to grease the pan well with vegetable oil. 

*Note-I have found that milk and vinegar is just NO substitute for good ole buttermilk! Get some! Really! It is so versatile and can be used in many things.

This turned out beautifully, very quick to make, and the buttermillk "makes" it for sure!  I just made it in a bowl after melting the butter in the microwave. Very moist and my family loved it. My own personal preference would be to cut the sugar to maybe 3/4 or 2/3 cups, as I found it to be very sweet for my taste.

This was so good. One of the best I have ever had.  I made a small modification by adding ( mixed in) 1/2 of an 8oz can of drained whole corn kernels and kept the baking time of 30 mins.  So Yum! Thanks on the tip of doing everything in one pan. I mixed it all with a whisk. My own came out moist and not dry like other reviewers. This recipe is a KEEPER!

Absolutely loved this cornbread! I used whole wheat flour as the author later suggested, and buttermilk corn meal (sold in stores next to the regular corn meal). I was really surprised how much I liked it!

This is a GREAT recipe. Only gave it 4 stars because I made the following changes: doubled recipe and poured in 9X13 pan but kept sugar amount 2/3 cup and used sugar in the raw. I also did the buttermilk trick (skim milk w/apple cider vinegar). These came out moist and still really sweet. The next time I make this I will cut sugar down to 1/3 cup.

Great recipe.  Just sweet enough.  Only issue I found with this recipe is that when I added the eggs I had to whisk or mix quickly because my butter/sugar was a bit hot, and  the eggs can scramble.  So melt butter slowly on low heat or prepare to work fast!  Thanks for this recipe.  Definite keeper.

LOVE this recipe! I make it as written. The only thing I do different is I make it in a cast iron skillet. Use either a large skillet or 1/2 of the recipe fits perfectly in a 9 inch skillet. (the original recipe makes a LOT of cornbread) Put the skillet in the oven as you are preheating it. Leave it there for at least 10 min longer to get it good and hot. Right before pouring the mix in, carefully take it out, add 1 T butter and swirl the butter to coat. Add the mix, put it in the oven. The bread will cook much faster than stated on this recipe and you want to take it out just when the center is set so it is not dry. (takes about 20 min) The skillet gives the edges a nice yummy crisp.

Yum! I did use half butter half applesauce and half whole wheat and half all purpose flour to up the nutritional value. It still tasted incredible.

I used whole what flour and was worried about the bread being too sweet, so I just used 1/3 cup of white sugar. I don't think I'll mind it being a little sweet, so I'll probably use 1/3 cup of Splenda and 1/3 cup of white sugar next time.   Mine was ready in 22 mins. I used a dark, nonstick, 8 x 8, square baking pan. It was baked in a conventional oven.

This recipe deserves all 5 stars. It's easy to follow and the cornbread was perfect! The only thing I did that was not mentioned here is sift the flour because to me it makes cakes and bread much fluffier and easier to mix. I served it with some Flatlander chili (also on this site) and my entire family were happy campers. Thank you for posting it!

This is absolutely the BEST cornbread I've ever tasted.  I made it for my family and everyone agreed, it was delicious.  I usually don't rate recipes because they usually don't stand out but this one is above and beyond.  I would highly recommend, it's a keeper!!

Great recipe. It was even better the next day after we had covered our dish in foil and left it out on the stovetop over night. Moist, slightly sweet, with just the right amount of density. Good stuff!

This was fabulous.  It was the perfect combination of crumbly corn bread and cake like corn bread.   I think it could have been a TINY bit sweeter (but that's a personal preference)  but prepared according to the recipe it was just fine.   Made a double batch and brought it to a cookout and let the host freeze the second pan.

UPDATE: MY NEIGHBOR (WHO I SHARED THIS WITH) IS FROM THE DEEP SOUTH. SHE LOVED THIS AND TOLD ME THAT THIS IS EXACTLY HOW CORNBREAD IS MADE IN THE SOUTH. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AN AUTHENTIC CORNBREAD, I GUESS THIS IS IT. :) This was OK... a decent yet basic cornbread recipe. I must confess.... My loyalty goes to bluegirl. Her golden sweet cornbread is the BOMB. Don't get me wrong. This is a fine cornbread. It's just not as sweet as I would have liked it to be (I'm a sucker for sweet cornbread). Because bluegirl's recipe produces a cornbread with a coarse crumb, I decided to try something different this time (I like moist cornbread, but bluegirl's is SOOOO darn good, I can overlook the fact that it isn't). I appreciate the moist, tender texture of this cornbread, but simply put, bluegirl's just tastes better. Thanks anyways, Ms. Weathersby! :-)

Perfect as is when serving with fish, little too sweet for my taste when serving with soup beans, however cutting the sugar is all it took to fix that. If your looking for a good cornbread recipe then this one would be hard to beat, just adjust the sugar to your taste. Thanks Bethany!!

I've been looking for a good, stand-by cornbread recipe. This one is awesome! It's moist, and a little sweet.. though if you like heartier, buttery types, you could leave out some sugar! I've made this twice, and both times it came out beautifully.

Very, very good. Made as recipes says. I did melt the butter in the microwave instead of a pan but it was wonderful.

This is our favorite cornbread recipe, I have tried different ones over the years (and I have tried many) and have decided this is it for our family.  It's very moist, just the right amount of sweetness, goes well with chili or just by itself.  My kids love these as well, they just cannot stop eating them.  I use low fat buttermilk and it's plenty rich.

I hate cornbread, but decided to try this recipe for my husband who loves cornbread.  I actually really like this cornbread though!  It has a nice texture, is moist, and just the right amount of sweetness.  My husband and kids loved it!

So I made a few changes to make the recipe more healthy but it still tasted GREAT. I used half whole wheat and half unbleached white flour. Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and the butter to 6 tbsp (3/4th of a stick). To make up for it, I added a 1/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce. Also I didn't have butter milk so I just added a tbsp of apple cider vinegar on another reviewer's suggestion to 1 cup of regular 2% milk. Baked for 35 minutes (30 would probably have been ok too) and it turned out super yummy! Thanks for the great recipe!

WOW ! This was so good I could eat it all myself ! I made it just like the recipe & it was very good . Forget the rest I found the "Best" ! I only wish My grandmother were still here to enjoy it with me ! I would give this at least 10 stars but you can only let you use 5. So double stars for this cornbread !  I'll probably make it 2-3 times a week ! Try it you'll love it ! *****

I have been using this recipe for years now.  The only change I have made is decreasing the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup plus 1 Tbls sugar.  I have also substituted 1 cup of 2% milk with 2 Tbls lemon juice instead of Buttermilk.

I can't even express how good these were. I made 12 muffins (baked for 21 minutes) and they turned out so well. Golden brown, moist, extra buttery on the bottom and sweeter on top. It was very easy to make--I'll never buy the cornbread mixes I've always used again!

Made with the whole wheat flour, as suggested by the author in her review.  Easy and good, but not wonderful - maybe the whole wheat flour's fault.  Anyway, used Splenda as well, so save on some calories.  Would make again, but hubby did not think it the best.

Really excellent cornbread...very tender and moist.  I made one adjustment and cut the sugar down to a scant half cup.  Still slightly sweet and to me, perfect.

This recipe is officially my go-to cornbread recipe now.  I did 1/2 cup white flour, 1/2 cup wheat and 6 Tbsp. butter.  I loved it and will use it from now on.  Thank you so much for the recipe and your additional comments helped a lot!

Awesome recipe! Great place to start if you haven't made cornbread. I make double batches just exactly as the recipe is written and they turn out great. Great basic recipe to start tweeking the way you like it. Goes good with a nice big glass of milk.

YUMMY cornbread. I used this to make corn dog muffins. Made according to directions then filled 12 muffin slots 2/3 full. Then sliced hotdogs and placed around 5 slices into each slot. Baked at 375 for about 20 minutes or until golden brown.

This was my first attempt at making cornbread. My family is VERY picky about cornbread, but this recipe was a hit! Not too dry, not too moist... I followed another reviewer's suggestion and mixed and baked the whole thing in the iron skillet.

Loved it!  It was easy to prepare (and I'm a real novice cook) and tasted great.  Next time I'll cut down on the sugar, though.  2/3rds of a cup was a bit much.  I think I'll try a half cup.

Loved this recipe! I made it with my gluten free flour mix and added some xanthum gum. It was really good and crispy brown on top. My husband liked it too.

I didn't manage to copy down the instructions for the recipe and just mixed the dry ingredients then add the wet ingredients and stir to combine. I only used about 2 tbsp of butter and 1 tbsp of canola oil and melted them in the skillet in the preheating oven. Also only used 1/3 cup sugar and thought it was plenty sweet enough. Can perhaps reduce to 1/4 cup if you don't have a sweet tooth. Used vinegar+milk for buttermilk. Baked it in cast iron skillet. Overall tasty cornbread. Has a nice crust to it which I enjoyed. Done baking in slightly less than 30 mins. Will be using this recipe again for sure!

I am not a "sweet cornbread" person, but this recipe made me jump the fence quickly. Absolutely the best sweet cornbread ever! Tell Grandmother she did good on this one!

Loved it.  I used fat free buttermilk and half butter, half margarine mix instead of butter.

This is really, really sweet and really plain. More like cake than cornbread. I would significantly reduce the sugar if I made it again. The texture was excellent though, not dry at all.

Thank you for sharing your grandma's recipe...this is my go to cornbread recipe. It's perfect the way it is... sometimes I add 1/4 cup of creamed corn or corn kernels for more texture. YUM!

WONDERFUL!! The only changes I made were to use Whole wheat flour, and make them muffins, instead of a loaf. I cut down baking time to 18 minutes. I was able to make 17 muffins by using a 1/4 cup to fill each one. (Cuts down on calories. 136 calories a muffin.) Thank you so much for sharing. Entire family LOVES them!!

Hands down ~ one of the best cornbread recipes!! I didn't change anything within the recipe...however, my bread was done within 25 minutes. So, I would recommend to watch the bread from 20 minutes on....depending on your oven.  Mine typically runs true to the time suggested on the recipe.  Certainly will be the only recipe I will use for cornbread!!

This recipe is wonderful!! I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 3/4 c. of 2%, a couple dollops of sour cream and the rest half & half. 

I also did 1/3c. whole wheat flour and 2/3c. white. 

This recipe is awesome. Best cornbread ever.

I divided half the batch and put frozen corn and sliced green onions in half and left the other half plain. 

Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Bethany! This will be my cornbread recipe indefinitely.

I melted the butter in my cast iron skillet, mixed all the other ingredients right in it and then popped it in the oven, which I had set to used the convection option.  It was done in about 20 -22 minutes and it was totally awesome!!!!  Crispy on the outside and sweet and moist.    Just wanted to post this as a suggestion for those with those options available.

We loved this recipe!  My husband likes Jiffy corn muffin mix and he said these were better.  Since I don't have an 8x8 pan I made these into muffins.  The recipe yielded an even dozen.  I baked them at 375 for 20-25 minutes and they were perfect.  I have also baked these in a 9 inch round pan using the cooking directions in the recipe and they came out golden brown and cooked through.  Prominent corn flavor with an even coarse crumb...a perfect compliment to turkey chili or on it's own with butter.  Yum!

This is our go-to cornbread recipe, and we love cornbread. I can't even count how many times we've made it now, but it's well over 10. The one alteration we make is to use powdered buttermilk instead of the real thing, simply because it's easier to keep powdered buttermilk on hand (it's found near the regular powdered milk in the baking aisle).

Very good cornbread. I subbed Pamela's Gluten Free Baking Mix for the flour for my gluten intolerant friend, and the cornbread still came out great!

Good recipe.  I cut back to 1/2 cup on the sugar and they were still pretty sweet.  I used a cast iron skillet to bake and it only took 20 min.  Next time I will double the recipe when using a skillet as they were half the size of the picture.

Not only was this great cornbread, I'm addicted to it.  It was done in 30 minutes in my oven so watch the cooking time.  Dense like a homemade cake, sweet, delicious with butter of course.  I made mine in advance, cooled, wrapped and froze for a couple of days.  Thawed on day of use and heated wrapped in foil in a low oven.   I'll never make any other!

Some of the best homemade cornbread I have ever made...my only complaint is that the cook time listed was far too long for my oven, had I trusted the times listed it would have been dry and burnt! I took mine out at 22 minutes.

I made this for the holidays but used gluten free flour instead of regular flour as I have a GF child.  Was wonderful!  I doubled recipe and made into mini cupcakes for serving and baked for less time.  I'm going to make it again today and stick the mini cupcakes into the freezer.

Very, very dense. Nice buttery, corn-y flavor though. Made it twice, as written, thinking I must've goofed the first time, with the same results.  More leavening, maybe?

This cornbread has been a huge hit at two holiday dinners. I substituted whole-wheat flour and raw sugar and followed another reviewer's tip of baking the bread in a cast-iron skillet for 25 min. It came out great.

Simple, delicious, not too fluffy but rich in flavor. I followed the recipe for the most part, substituting only the white sugar for organic Turbinado sugar and adding a splash of Jack Daniels Honey Jack. I doubled the recipe and added an additional 13 minutes to the baking time, turned out great.

I loved this cornbread.  this was my first attempt at making cornbread.  I had it once before when I was in Louisiana.  I think this is a good recipe but my friend thinks that a cornbread recipe should not have sugar.  I loved the sugar - but I may search for a sugarless recipe so I can compare.  (really can't imagine it's will be better)

This was exactly what I was looking for, sweet and moist, as promised!  You wouldn't believe how much cornbread I've thrown out over the past week before finding this recipe. Worked out beautifully even though I used Smart Balance in place of butter and Xylitol instead of sugar.  Thanks to you and your grandmother for this precious recipe!!! Plan to try it again and make gluten free. Will let you know the results!

Followed this exactly, and it came out fantastic! My husband loves cornbread, and when he tried this, he said it was a keeper. Heck, even the kids had some, and they're very picky. Thanks for sharing your grandmother's recipe, Bethany!

AMAZING!!!!  These were sweet and just perfect.  I like a particularly sweet cornbread, so I added more sugar.  I also am on a gluten-free diet and had to substitute for that.  I used King Arthur Gluten-free All Purpose flour (same amount) and added a 1/2 tsp of Xanthan Gum.  The cornbread rose nicely and was moist and not crumbly (a typical problem with gluten-free baked goods).  Just perfection!!!  THANK YOU!!  I wasn't sure I'd ever be able to find a good cornbread recipe ever again.  My husband even said it is better than its "gluteny" counterpart.  This will be my staple cornbread recipe from now on.

This corn bread was good and way simple to make. I made  the breads in a muffin tin. It was so quick. I made them right before dinner. They took 20 minutes to cook but I think next time I'd reduce the baking time a tiny bit. The edges were brown--not burnt at all--just brown. 
I made it all in 1 pan (I used a wok).  I also added corn to the recipe. I like sweet so this was perfect for sweetness but I like more cakey corn bread and this was a bit gritty.

Best cornbread I have ever had, and most certainly ever made.  It even turned out well when I added a little lemon juice to regular 2% milk when I ran out of buttermilk.

This is WONDERFUL!  I made one batch as the recipe and another adding a drained can of kernel corn.  This is the best cornbread I have ever made - not to mention easy!  Forget buying the junky packets from the store anymore.

I made turkey shaped cornbread muffins for Thanksgiving dinner and they were a hit.  They went perfectly with Alton Brown's Honey Butter!

I made the exact recipe. Unfortunately it was very dry, and not sweet at all.

I am 56 years old, raised by a wonderful southern mother, and for the first time in my life found a cornbread I like. This was wonderful, slightly sweet, and moist. Made the best stuffing I've ever made!

This cornbread recipe is awesome! I was so sick of using the blue box to make cornbread. This was 10 times better than any I've ever had. It was super easy to make, and took almost no time at all. My daughter even thought it was cake!!

So easy and so delicious.  I didn't change a thing.  I am now making my second batch because my husband asked for more.  (He is not a lover of cornbread, so this is a giant feather in my cap.)  thanks for a great recipe that I will keep forever.

AMAZING Recipe, I cannot believe it turned out so delicious. The only thing that I added was 8 oz. of canned corn which gave it an wonderful texture.

Just made this for the third time this fall at the request of my kids. I do alter it somewhat. I use whole wheat flour, reduce sugar to 1/2 cup, add a 1/2 cup of frozen corn kernels, 1/3 cup of shredded Mexican cheese and 1/2 cup of diced roasted green chillis. Yum!

Lovely, simple, on the sweet side, which is my preference. Not try.  Very little work.  Perfect crust. The last cornbread recipe I'll need.  (served it with ham & "Dawn's Kale Side Dish" & everything was just right together and super-easy.... ALSO, I put the batter in prepared pan in the fridge 3-4 hours ahead of time & it still came out fantastic.  (I let it warm to room temp. before baking.)

Very delicious.  This was my first time making homemade cornbread, and it was a success with this recipe! My husband LOVED it and he usually doesn't care for cornbread.  The only thing I did different is added one cup of whole kernel canned corn as other reviewers reccomended.  It was fabulous!! We had it with chili and it was the perfect pair!

Perfect, simple cornbread. I cut the recipe in half and put it into a 6-in round glass dish, and instead of using store-bought buttermilk, I did the milk-and-vinegar method in the microwave, draining it slightly before adding (seeing as the recipe uses baking soda, I will use LEMON instead of vinegar next time. derp). Cooked for 31mins at 175C.

Well 2000 people couldn't be wrong, and they weren't!  This was, and is, by far the best cornbread recipe I have tried.  Even my husband agreed, and THAT is saying alot!  I followed the recipe exactly only reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup because my husband loves honey on his cornbread.  Good-bye store bought and hello homemade from now on!  Thank you Bethany!

Super easy to put together!  I substituted whole wheat pastry flour and used 1/3 cup agave syrup in place of the sugar (low glycemic index).  I used pampered chef muffin pan making 12 biscuits and baking 20 minutes....  They turned out great.

If you like sweet cornbread, this is for you.  I actually like the level of sweetness.  I am going to play around with the reviewers ideas of cutting down on calories.  The calories are worth the moist, rich taste of this recipe!!

I do not know who said sweet cornbread isn't from the south..lol My family came from poor farmers in the south that lived on sweet cornbread and buttermilk. I love this recipe. Very easy and quick. I did mine all in a cast iron skillet. Melted the butter and mixed in sugar. I didn't have buttermilk so I added vinegar to the milk before the baking soda and let it sit while melting butter. I then removed from heat added all ingredients and mixed well.!!! It is a hit at my house, which contains three teenage rednecks that are picky about their cornbread..lol I also want to say I used real stone ground cornmeal. I do not know if that makes a difference to others but it does to us. We are all into simplicity and using "real" foods.Not organic or prepackaged... Just saying:)

I've made this twice now and we love it.  I did make a few changes.  I used 1/4 cup sugar (we don't like sweet cornbread) and the 2nd time I did 1 1/2 sticks of butter instead of the called for 1 stick.  It was much more moist, I'll do that again next time!  I also melted the butter right into a cast iron skillet and added all the ingredients directly into the cast iron and popped it into the oven.  Less mess!

This is a great recipe and it came out great the first time I tried it. I did make modification the second time as I used whole wheat: added 1/4 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, used 3/4 cup whole wheat flour and 1/4 cup wheat germ (instead of 1 cup all-purpose flour). I did mix wet ingredients first then dry ingredients. My kids practically inhaled it:)

Delicious.  Tastiest cornbread I've ever had.  I used half all purpose flour and half whole wheat.  I use the Spenda/sugar baking mix in place of sugar and added 2 tablespoons flax seed.  Love it!

Dry and boring.  I made it twice, second one came out salty for some reason.  I cut the baking time to 22 minutes and that was better but salty and not very good.

Just the recipe I was looking for to cook in loaf form, 4.5" X 8.25" in a glass loaf pan! I used 1/2 cup of maple sugar instead of 2/3 granulated sugar.
Excellent!

Just the way I enjoy cornbread - sweet and moist.  And it's really fast to whip up a batch.  I've made it with real buttermilk, but have also used buttermilk substitutes in a pinch (1% milk mixed with 1 3/4 tablespoons of cream of tartar, which didn't sour enough, so I added about 1/8 cup yogurt).  The substitute worked just as well if you don't have buttermilk on hand.

We loved this! Instead of using another dish, I incorporated everything in my skillet, and popped it into the oven. Had no issues with it sticking. The only change I made was to reduce the sugar to ½ Cup. Came out perfect and rounded out our chili dinner nicely. I think this will be a great base recipe too. I plan to add jalapenos, cheese, & green chiles next time I need Mexican Cornbread to go with our meal.

WOW!  thank you!  thanks also for the updated comment, I read through that and was able to avoid reading all the rest of the comments, figuring you were the expert... and you were!  this is my new go-to recipe, exactly as written.  30 minutes tops with the white flour!

Just one more 5 star rating! Followed the recipe exactly except I heated the butter in my cast iron skillet and continued mixing from there in it as well.  I was worried it would stick but I had no problems.  I also worried about the amount of sugar in this recipe, but it was not overly sweet - just perfect. My cornbread recipe from now on!
**UPDATE - try homesteader cornbread.  It is my cornbread recipe from now on!!

5 star recipe all the way!  I LOVED this.  I have never made home-made cornbread ever, and this was easy easy EASY.  I mixed it all in a cast iron (round) pan, and baked it for 30 minutes.  I inverted the pan to put the round cornbread onto a serving dish, but it stuck to the bottom.  I ran a very thin and pliable spatula underneath, and then tried again - popped right out, not a piece broke. Then I cut into slices (I think this cut into 16ths).  Of course, I had to taste one, and OH MY GOODNESS!  I'll leave you with that!

Hands down BEST CORNBREAD EVER!  I prepared exactly as is, except for I baked it for about 30 minutes since my stove seems to be a little hot.  My picky boyfriend even wanted more!  This cornbread is not crumbly or cakey- just right!  Next time I will make 2 or 3 batches and freeze.  Thanks for the awesome recipe, Bethany!

This cornbread was good,  the best so far. I added a small can of creamed corn to recipe for more texture, moistness, and flavor. It wasn't dry around the edges but great in the middle! The leftovers got really hard in the fridge. I like to put honey/ butter on my bread so in all it was pretty good. If anyone had the BEST cornbread recipe EVER i would love to have one that is moist and flavorful! Thanks for posting!

Made a few changes: used regular milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk because I didn't have buttermilk and reduced sweetening to 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup white sugar. Hubby and kids LOVED it but I think it could still use a bit less sugar/honey. I served it with chili and would make it again.

This is best recipe for cornbread I've ever had! I've made this twice in less than a week. The first I made it for a large group of people and they absolutely loved it! The only change I made was to up the sugar to one cup.  We're from Texas and we like our cornbread really sweet (almost like a dessert). The next I made it I didn't melt the butter in the pan.  I melted the butter in the microwave in a glass bowl and proceeded as before. It came out just as wonderful!

I made this about three times in one week and everyone who tried it said it was the best cornbread that they've ever tasted!  I used white cornmeal for mine.  It's so delicious, moist and just...perfect.  Also, instead of buttermilk I substituted 1 cup of milk with 1 tbsp white vinegar mixed in.

I'm a HUGE fan of cornbread.  I've had my share in finding the best.  And I think this may just be the best I've had yet.   I followed the recipe exactly.  Thought it was a little odd to mix in the skillet.  But everything turned out wonderfully. It's a dense but still fluffy cornbread.  Perfectly sweet and tasty.

Holy cow. I have never made cornbread from scratch because the box stuff is just so easy and relatively edible. NEVER again. This was so easy and exceptional. My only 5 star rating I have ever given. I followed the recipe to a T with the exception of doing half brown and half white sugar. 30 minutes exactly!!! Perfect, moist, delicious!

WoW!  Great cornbread.  I made a gluten free version this time because I have an autistic child.  I subsituted the cup of flour with 1/2 cup millet flour and 1/2 cup brown rice flour.  No one can tell the difference!

This is a wonderful recipe, and exactly what I was looking for. I used whole wheat flour, reduced the sugar by half and used RAW sugar.  The regular amount of sugar is not too sweet, but I personally preferred a little less sweet and a little more healthy. The first time I made these I cooked them for 30 min and they were dry, so I made them again and cooked for 18 min and they were much better, could probably go a minute or two shorter even, so I suggest watching them. Great Recipe!

My first time making cornbread and it was a hit. I am not a cornbread person, but my boyfriend is and wanted it homemade. He told me to keep the recipe and I plan to because I loved it. I changed nothing and did it by the recipe.

Absolutely loved this cornbread...it was moist and sweet but not too sweet to me anyway. I made a double batch so I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar and I also used 1/2 whole wheat flour and 1/2 all-purpose flour...it turned out great and it was alittle healthier. My husband who doesn't care for any cornbread .... ate it & said it wasn't bad. Thanks so much Bethany for sharing this recipe with all of us. ITS A KEEPER!!!

This is just a basic good recipe - Nothing wrong with it as far as this native Texas can tell, I personally like my corn bread sweet, just like my tea, personally I might add a bit more butter next time (maybe 2/3 cups) and maybe a little honey but this is a fine starter as far as I can see - Nice job

I've been looking for a cornbread recipe that even comes CLOSE to Safeway's jalapeno cornbread and I found this one because I had a cup of buttermilk to use up! I added a finely diced jalapeno to the batter at the last step and I think this is the recipe I've been looking for! It's easy as heck and it is DELICIOUS! Next time-I'm adding 2 jalapenos! Thank you Bethany! And your grandmother!

Very moist cornbread. I made the cornbread to serve with my meal tonight. These were easy to put together. I followed directions and ingredients to a "T". The only thing I changed was the baking method, which was to make muffins instead of using an 8 inch square baking pan. I poured the batter in each muffin tins that I sprayed with PAM. I baked them up at 375 degrees for 23 minutes. They are a golden yellow color with a nice round top as a muffin should be. The muffins are very moist and tasty. Nothing overpowering at all, only slightly sweet - which I like. I found no need to reduce the sugar amount as others have previously stated in their reviews. I ended up with 14 beautiful muffins. I served them warm along with, "Beef Barely Vegetable Soup," also from this website.

I was in a big hurry.  I melted the butter in a cast iron skillet in the oven while it was preheating, threw everything else in a bowl, mixed well and added it to the skillet when butter was bubbling.  It was probably the best cornbread I have ever eaten and I am almost 70.  Can't wait to make it again.

Excellent cornbread!  Very sweet!  I would probably use a little less sugar next time just as a personal preference. I didn't have buttermilk so I just used some canned milk. Also used butter flavored crisco in stick form instead of butter. Make sure you temper the eggs because they could start to "cook" when you add them to the butter and sugar.  I just kept stiring them and they were fine.

My husband is from WV and cornbread is something he always had and was brought up eating. We live in the east coast now in Canada and I try to make things from home that he enjoys. This was a hit and my kids really like it too. Very moist and didn't change anything. I liked making it all in the pot the butter was melted in. Less cleanup! Thanks for the lovely recipie. :) This will be a regular now in our house!

I changed it to make it Southern by leaving out all the sugar. Not even a teaspoon. I also bake mine in a heavy iron skillet. It is an excellent recipe. With my changes, we loved it. People have different tastes in different parts of the country.

This cornbread is so good!!! We've been using this recipe in my family for a couple of years now, affectionately calling it "corncake," and we LOVE it! It's great exactly as the recipe goes, but you can also tweek it as you like. When I made it today I only use 1/2 cup of sugar, made half of the flour be whole wheat, and subbed in applesauce for the butter (I think I'd only sub applesauce in for half the butter next time). But it's delicious the original way, too, I just like experimenting!

I really love how it held together.  It wasn't as fluffy as some I've made, but those have ended up being so crumbly it was annoying.  This one is a keeper for me.

This is great cornbread.  I reduced the sugar since we don't like our cornbread so sweet.  This recipe is a keeper.

Excellent recipe!!!!!!!  I made this for Father's day and both my husband and father loved it.  My stepmother also couldn't believe it was homemade.  What a simple & delicious recipe!!!  I will never buy Jiffy again!!!!!!!!  I followed the instructions to the "T".  The only thing I did differently was follow the advise of another and drizzle it w/ honey and butter when it was done!!!!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!

I am 8 months pregnant and living in Argentina and have been craving cornbread! There really isn't anything like cornbread here so I decided to find a recipe and make it myself.  This recipe is amazing! It tastes sooo good! I didn't change anything in the recipe. I just checked it frequently in the oven and took it out when I thought it was ready.  I've been making this every few days for the last couple weeks now. LOVE IT!!!

I give this recipe a 5 star cause it tastes just like my grandma use to make and its deliciously good. She use to serve it with home made bean soup with ham  or with milk and a little sugar cause 30 years ago times were hard for people and they made what could stretch the furthest with a large family so what ever it took and this is a great recipe for all. thanks for it

A touch too sweet.  Have made this twice, and going forward will reduce the sugar a bit, but other than that, it's a wonderful and very easy recipe to make.  Great with chili.

Absolutely delicious! I followed the clarified suggestions from the person who submitted this recipe and it really eased on the cleaning. I found it a little sweet for my taste buds so on my second batch I reduced the sugar. I wanted to make this for a picnic, so I greased and put the batter into a muffin tin and they came out perfect for individual servings for the occasion! (If you decide to do this, they will be ready in 15 mins.)

WOW just WOW!
I wanted to make a "mix in a jar" for cornbread for gift giving, and I saw this and thought I would give it a try.
So I made mine like this,
I mixed all the dry ingredients (using only 1/2 c sugar) and powdered buttermilk. (4 tblsp as directed on the package for the 1 c equilivent)

Then I melted 1 stick of butter added 1 cup water (as per the directions on the powdered buttermilk) and two eggs, just put them on top of the dry ingredients.   Mixed until smooth with a vinyl scraper spoon.  Put into a 8" buttered pan, and baked at 375 for 30 minutes.

PERFECTION!! super moist and I think it will go over great as a gift.  Just mix the dry ingredients and put in jars make sure you add a tag with the recipe and there you go!  I am so excited to give this!  Would make great craft show items too or just bring a few with a baked loaf to a pot luck - your host/hostess will thank you for it!

Thanks for the great recipe!

YUM! Would have preferred it a little bit more moist, but will make again and alter accordingly, maybe even add a can of corn.

this is WONDERFUL!  I've made this several times now, and it has become my 'go-to' recipe for cornbread.  I don't own a cast iron skillet (i know, it's crazy!) so I'm so glad to find a recipe that doesnt call for one, that turns out so fabulous!  I like to drizzle honey and butter over the top as soon as it comes out of the oven.  I'm not a big carb or bread eater, but I LOVE this!  thank you!

Followed the recipe exactly as is and came out beautifully!  I did not have an 8 inch square pan, so I used an 8 inch round and it worked great!

This is by far the best cornbread I have ever had.  I even cut the sugar in half due to dieting and found it wonderful.

EXCELLENT.  Moist & buttery.  Reminds me of the Boston Market cornbread in flavor (it's the sweet kind), but much better.  Used 1 c whole milk w/ a tablespoon of lemon juice since I didn't have buttermilk and it came out great.

Yes! I can finally make great cornbread. Finally found a recipe worth keeping. My family loved it, even my husband who doesn't like cornbread. I threw in come sweet corn before putting it in the pan. Yummmmm. Thank you!

I've been making cornbread for 40 years and by far and away this was the best tasting, most moist cornbread ever!    Thank you for submitting this keeper!

BTW: I only had 1/2 cup cornmeal, so did as suggested elsewhere on allrecipes.com and crushed tortilla chips very fine to make up the amount needed.     YEA!

Excellent! It's been years since I've actually made homemade cornbread...this recipe is a winner. Paired it with chili. Try it, you won't be disappointed. I only baked mine 30 minutes so watch your time carefully.

This is a wonderful cornbread I loved it.  It's moist and tasty just as the other reviews state.  The only thing I did different was instead of a pan I melted my butter in a microwave safe bowl large enough to mix all the ingredients in.

Took a chance and made this for the first time for a family get-together. Fantastic as written (I used special medium-ground cornmeal from a health food store). Sweet and so good; my cousin asked for the recipe and said it's the best cornbread she's ever eaten. Yum!

This is absolutely perfect cornbread.  I prefer less sweet cornbread so I just added less sugar and I did not have buttermilk so I used 1% milk and added a little white vinegar.  Yumm!!

Just made this exactly as written. I used the same skillet I melted the butter in (mine is pretty huge) and I whisked everything in after. Baked in a 9X9 brownie pan for 30 minutes exactly, although next time I'll check it at 25. I also agree with other people's comments... less sugar for a savory cornbread (had the full amount of sugar with lentil soup.. it was interesting but not bad). Will make again!

This is a truly classic corn bread recipe.  It carries the right balance between dense and fluffy and it's so tasty you'll find yourself going back for more, like it's dessert.  I cut back on the sugar to half a cup, just personal preference.  I also doubled up on the ingredients, still using an 8x8 pan and adding 15-20 minutes to the baking time and the rise was perfect.

I make this at least every 2 weeks. This is the BEST cornbread recipe I have ever made. The only change is that I microwave the butter in my large glass measuring cup (4 cups) and then mix ALL ingreidents right in the measuring cup. It makes it a lot easier and comes out great. If you use one of those brownie pans from Bed, Bath & Beyond or Michaels, with "pre-cut" squares, your cornbread squares would come out PERFECT!

This was my first Corn Bread, and I can't stop eating it! It has been sitting for a few hours, and that makes it taste even better! I don't think that it is too sweet-people must be using more sugar than what calls in the recipe. The buttery and sweet taste of this bread cannot be beat. Awesome!

I made this for the second time tonight. It's absolutely perfect.  I "retired" from cooking cornbread because it kept turning out poorly.  I really enjoy it and missied it, especially when I ate chili.  So, in December I scoured the web and read lots of recipe reviews.  This is the one I chose to make and it turned out fantastic -- both times.  I wrote at the top of my recipe: "This is it! The best cornbread -- ever!"  

I rarely write online reviews, but I had to do it for this cornbread.  If someone can come up with something this good other people need to know about it.  

Last, I used Saco Buttermilk blend (powdered buttermilk/sour milk) for the the buttermilk and it was perfectly acceptable.  I prepared it as if it were corn starch -- cold water, whisk, continuous stirring.  

Enjoy!

Thanks for the additional comments. Took a double batch to a potluck, rave reviews! My changes: I added a finely chopped up jalapeno pepper.  I used Light Coconut Milk(Trader Joe's)  rather than buttermilk, and only 2/3 cup sugar for the double batch. Plus, spelt flour rather than all-purpose.  It was still very sweet, but bit more dense.

Excellent-- moist, rich, and not dense or bready.  Doubled the recipe, used half sugar half honey, and added about 1/3 c of frozen corn.

I didn't have any of this, I made it for a friend of mine.  She said it was darn good (she actually used a different D-word but I figured it was inappropriate for this site).  Will definitely make this again, and maybe next time I'll get a chance to try it myself.

This was the first time I ever made cornbread, and I have to admit that it was the best! My 96 year old grandmother even said that it tastes really good. And I will admit that I was distracted while making it and didn't add enough butter (I only added 1/4 cup) and you couldn't even tell the difference. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This was my very first try at cornbread. Exactly doubled the recipe and used a 13" cast iron skillet. Used a coarse stone ground corn meal from Bob's Red Mill. Turned out great. Moist. Substantial. Fantastic with my pot of Anasazi beans. Took last three wedges to neighbors. They called yesterday to say it was the best they have ever had. PS: We live in the South (East Texas).
Thanks for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly, and it was very good. Nice and smooth, which is rare with cornbread. I have made it just as written, but when I used 1.5 cups of cornmeal and only .5 cups of flour it had more flavor.

Oh my heavens! I have tried a lot of corn bread recipes (did I say A LOT?) and this is my favorite one I have ever made. My family loves it and wants me to make another batch. I even doubled it the first time. I made no changes except I made my own buttermilk using milk and a tablespoon of vinegar. Everything else was exact. So tasty! Thanks for the recipe!

This cornbread is moist, even when made with organic white whole wheat flour, and cakelike in texture. Sweet is the operative word, though.   Although we do like sweetened cornbread, we do not like it too sweet, so I cut back slightly on the sugar.  I still found it a bit too sweet, but hubby thought that it was just right.

Great cornbread, I prefer it with wheat flour.. for sure decrease the amount of sugar. I went down to 1/2 cup and still to cake like rather than cornbread maybe 1/4 would be better.. LOVED IT.. and definitely and Iron Skillet Keeper!

Excellent!  My husband LOVES this bread.  I used a tablespoon of lemon juice in a cup of milk to "make" my buttermilk and per the original recipe poster used whole wheat flour in place of all-purpose.  DELICIOUS!

Awesome Recipe! I made it "as is". I don't have a cast iron skillet, so I baked it in a 8x8 glass pan. it was SO yummy! I normally could care less about cornbread, I could take it or leave it. I kept going back for more of this, though. I may try to make it as muffins and see how that turns out...

Don't get me wrong, this recipe worked just fine; I just don't think it's at all deserving of the overwhelming 5-star rating.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted 2/3 c plain greek yogurt and 1/3 c milk for the 1 c buttermilk.  Also used wheat flour ILO the all-purpose (as recommended by the author in her own comment).  Cooked for 30 minutes.  It is a little sweeter than I'd like, and pretty dense.  The wheat flour works okay; I'd use it again just for the health benefits, but really it doesn't make the end product "cornbread" like you'd think of...  I'd consider making it again -- probably with a little extra baking soda and maybe AP flour -- but I am still searching for the perfect go-to cornbread recipe.

I love, love, love this cornbread.  Best I've ever had.  When we have chili for lunch at school (I cook), I make this special for my teachers.  I think I have derailed more "diets" with this!  Thank you Bethany!

Very good!  Only made half the recipe, but still put in about 1/2 cups of sugar!  =) It was perfect.

This is definitely Yankee Cornbread and not Southern Cornbread, so if you're looking for that salty cornbread taste don't even try this recipe.  That being said, this cornbread is delicious!  I melted the butter in the microwave and added into a larger bowl that already had the 2/3 c. sugar in it...no point in melting on the stove top when the microwave works just fine and is less hassle.  I also don't have an 8 in. sq. pan, so I used my loaf pan, and it was fine.  I baked it for about 35-40 minutes and it was perfection.  It has a subtle cornmeal flavor to it, accompanied with the perfect amount of sweetness.  The buttermilk is just the icing on the cake!  If you don't have buttermilk on hand, which I normally don't but I lucked out today, sour some milk yourself.  You can do that by adding white vinegar or lemon juice to the milk.  Let it sit for a couple minutes, and it will sour right up.  I just don't think it would have the same great flavor if you didn't use buttermilk or soured milk.

Yippy this was easy and yummy. I added everything to the same dutch oven with enamel coating just like the directions and even backed it with same dish. It got alittle stuck on the bottem but it didn't hurt the flavor. Easy clean up and everything.

I've made this several times for guests, always resulting in rave reviews. So simple to make, and the leftovers are great the next morning when heated up a little and served with some berries and maple syrup.

This was the first time I've made cornbread from scratch.  It was an overwhelming success.  Everyone at the table raved about this recipe.   I followed the original recipe except I couldn't decide if I wanted white or yellow corn meal so I used both.  I used 1/2 c. white corn meal and 1/2 c. stone ground yellow corn meal.  Correction, I just checked the label and I used stone ground white corn meal.  Anyway the mixture of textures added a lot.  This bread was flavorful,, buttery, and just the perfect sweetness.  I also baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet greased with 2 tbsp butter. This is a prefect recipe.

This recipe turned out great!  I made it just as the  recipe dictated.  I was so pleased that it was so moist! The thing I would do differently is to add corn to the mixture. I made it to accompany chili on a wintery evening.  Loved the taste and the sweetness made it great as a dessert with coffee the following       morning.  This will be my standard corn bread recipe from now on!

I am giving this 4 stars because it was wayyyyy too sweet for this Texas girl. We like buttery cornbread in our neck of the woods. I still make this recipe however and only add 2-3 T of sucanat.

Although this was not bad, the crumb is more like that of a cake than the mealy texture of cornbread that I love. I did not like the bitter/sour flavor of the buttermilk and was disappointed that the top barely browned even though it was completely cooked through.

This cornbread is fabulous. I made it using my normal gluten free flour blend and gluten free corn meal and OMG it was the 5 stars it deserves. Hubby (the GF one) adored it. Thanks so much for an excellent recipe! And please don't be afraid to supplement it to be gluten free just as written.

Delicious!  I made it with whole wheat flour and it was very tasty, but I do think it would be better with all purpose flour.  My 8 year old son loved it too!

Made this for New Years Eve to go with some black eyed peas, rice and collard greans. Because I dislike the smell of buttermilk, I used a powdered buttermilk substitute from the baking section at my grocery store.  I thought the taste was ok, but my fiance' liked it.  He asked me to make it again for a football party, so I did, using real buttermilk (while I held my nose).  :-)  Everyone luv'd it including me. Very moist with just the right amt. of sweetness and an overall good flavor. I guess by using real buttermilk, that made the difference.  I even drizzled a little melted butter on it after it had baked, so no one even asked for butter to spread on their pieces.  I made a full size aluminum pan of this by quadrupling the recipe and with that much only a few small pieces were leftover.  Many people went back for seconds or even took some home. I had one friend say that it was the best cornbread that he'd ever eaten and couldn't believe I'd made it, let alone from scratch.  Yes, I'm patting myself on the back.  LOL

This was a great recipe! It was my first time making cornbread and I am very happy with the results. I didn't have a 8 in. pan so I used a muffin pan and only baked it for about 20 minutes. They turned out perfect and in personal sizes. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! I made adjustment to the sugar by cutting the amount in half (not a fan of sweet cornbread), and I am so glad I did.  I made this recipe twice this week and pretty much ate the whole thing by myself.

Beautiful bread, don't change a thing. You can use a tablespoon of vinegar in a cup of milk in place of the buttermilk if you don't have any.

I made this for a family get-together.  They devoured this!  I could hear in the other room that people were talking about it as they ate as well as 3 people asking about the recipe (one while her mouth was full with the cornbread).  Your grandmother got it right!

I followed the recipe for once, but they came out a little crumby and brittle. Flavor was also somewhat lacking, but lots of butter fixes that.   I wish they were more moist, maybe I need to change the recipe some or just try a different recipe?

I just finished making muffins using this recipe.  Fantastic!!!  I didn't have buttermilk, so I used 2 T vinegar and enough milk to make a cup.  Turned out fantastic.  These are going to be great with the homemade bean soup that I'm making with the leftover ham bone from Christmas.  I gave my Mom a taste and she said "How many batches are you making?".  Guess she liked them, too.  Definitely will make again and again.

I have never been much of a cornbread eater, but now I simply can't get enough. I recommend anyone to try this recipe!   I love it, my family loves it, and I'm sure you all will too.

Fabulous recipe!! I have made it several times now and it is the only cornbread my huband wants me to make. I am getting ready to make it for dinner tonite!!  I have made it just the way the recipe says each time, It is DELISH!!!!!! 1/30/11- I just can't give this recipe enough stars---it is the best cornbread recipe ever.

Wow! It's everything I think of when I think "I'm going to make cornbread" - moist, sweet (not too sweet) and delicious. Had me coming back for seconds. Highly recommended.

I used my grandmother's recipe for years, but have now changed to this (Sorry Momo!!!). I have a friend who swore off cornbread, but enjoyed this recipe. Didn't change a thing.

I doubled the recipe, used 3tbls cider vinegar with the 2 cups milk, added 1 cup heavy grated parm. cheese and 1 small can of chopped green chillies a little more flour and corn-meal to compensate for the wet chillies and a little less sugar. Then cooked in a greased pre-warmed dutch-oven (no lid) for 45min. or so. I could tell when it was done when the cornbread started to come away from the edge of the pan. With all the cheese in there the toothpick trick does not work all that well.  Great recipe, you guys are making me look like a pro!!!

FINALLY!!!! A cornbread recipe that my family will eat! I made this to go along with black eyed peas tonight. My son BEGGED me not to make cornbread, unless it was that "little blue box".     After his second helping, he gave his approval, so this one is a keeper!     Thanks,Bethanny! :)

This recipe trumped my grand-mother's recipe.  I did make one slight modification...I cook it in a cast iron skillet and reduce the sugar a to about 1/2 c.  This recipe made me giggle when I first read it.  The first part tells you to work in a skillet and then pour into a baking dish.  I immediately knew this was an OLD recipe and should have been cooked, stove-top, in a cast iron skillet and then transferred into the oven to bake.  It is a light, sweet old-fashioned yummy recipe!  My family loves it so much that I have to double the recipe and make two batches at the same time!!

I was happy to read all the reviews saying this is a sweet cornbread because I usually use butter and honey on mine. In this recipe, I used honey instead of sugar. They turned out beautiful and moist but, as the reviews said, very sweet! Even too sweet for me.  I will use less honey next time but will definitely make this again.

This is really good tasting cornbread.  I make it in the saucepan and then pour the batter into the cake pan.  Its simple, easy, and has very little clean up.  Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent!  Wonderful texture - moist yet dense.  I used 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup applesauce to decrease fat and calories and turned out great!  Baked in preheated cornbread wedge pan for beautiful presentation!  Thank you for sharing.

!!!PERFECT!!! This was the first time I used this recipe and it was quite easy. I used only a little sugar, some in my family like it just a little sweet, but it was just right even for me! I was in a hurry, (turkey already done) so I filled the dough in a very big pan, it was barely an inch high after baking only about 20 minutes, perfect for last minute baking! it got GREAT reviews from everybody, my husband said I have to repeat this every weekend from now on!!! LOve love love it!!!

SO GOOD! I combined this recipe with the "corn dog muffins" recipe on this site using only 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 applesause, eggbeaters and made buttermilk with two tablespoons lemon juice added to skim milk. GREAT cornbread recipe!

Thanksgiving 2010. not very good.  used 1cup fat free milk + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar.  maybe didn't have enough fat content.  or might be the corn meal i used.  not as moist as i had hoped [6/4/12] Used preheated cast iron skillet for 25min.  Used really buttermilk.  It was better than last time but still just ok.

Made this last night, followed the instructions exactly, and it was delicious! I used a loaf pan, and initially put it in for 30 minutes, but it needed about 10 more to be perfect. I had it with red beans and rice, great recipe, thanks!

Almost perfect (I'd give 4.5 stars), but something is missing from the taste that I haven't figured out yet.  With one or two modifications, this recipe will certainly be THE perfect cornbread.  I did follow the suggestion to heat the pan in the oven before putting the batter in for baking, which gave the crust of the bread a wonderfull crisp texture.

Best cornbread ever.  I made a half recipe for my husband and I (made 6 muffins), but wish I would have made the full batch because there were no leftovers!  I didn't have buttermilk, so used a tablespoon of vinegar, placed it in a 1/2 cup measure and filled the rest with milk (since I only did half the recipe).  Worked great, and I'm most definitely making this again.

Followed directions exactly.  The result was good--just nothing amazing. Had it both plain, and topped with honey butter. I thought it had good flavor, but I thought it lacked moisture. I've made better. Will try again, though, to confirm.

It's terrific! I don't think it's at all overly sweet, but I used salted butter, which probably provides a little balance to the sugar. Great texture. Delicious with chili. Super easy and oubles perfectly!

You know how you're always looking for just ONE really good recipe for a particular item and then you say you'll stick with it? This is it for cornbread! The recipe is simple and produced great results as followed. If you're using regular all-purpose flour it really only needs 30ish minutes to bake. I think 40 would dry it out.  I didn't even use a sauce pan, but rather melted the butter in the microwave in a large bowl, and then let it cool on the counter a bit before I mixed in the eggs and other ingredients. I also didn't have buttermilk, so instead used regular milk with a splash of apple cider vinegar, and it turned out fine. This base recipe is so good it would be fun to experiment with other additions. Perhaps cheddar, fresh corn, bacon crumbles, jalapenos...

I make this recipe all the time. I'm from Puerto Rico, and we are used to plain sweet cornbread. This one is not as good as the one you get from a puertorrican bakery but it is almost there. :o)

This is a great cornbread recipe.  I searched the internet for an hour, and most recipes had reviews that said too dry, too bland, etc., or had weird ingredients like goats milk.  This recipe is so easy if you follow Bethany's instructions (in her comment) and do it all in one pot.  I thought for sure the eggs would scramble when I mixed them into the sugar, but they didn't.  Don't let the buttermilk and baking soda sit for very long on the counter because it starts activating and crawls out of its container!  Also an idea to try is to use a roasted cornmeal (like Brinser's Best from Pennsylvania) for a unique flavor.  Thank you Bethany for sharing this recipe!

The best cornbread ever! I tried the recipe as is (oh but I used light brown sugar instead of white) and everyone loved it. The second time around, I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup but it wasn't quite as delicious to me, but everyone still loved it!

This was okay but not great. The heat of the pan I melted the butter in caused the eggs to partially cook even though I mixed them in quickly. The only substantial change I made was to bake the cornbread in the pan I used to melt the butter and mix the batter in--adjusting the baking time accordingly. The flavor and texture were just so-so and there was a slightly unpleasant sheen to the top of the cornbread, probably due to partially melting the sugar into the butter. I'm going to stick with my old recipe after all.

Made this last night and, after reading some of the reviews, was a little dubious about the sugar. However, I added the amount suggested and it worked great.   I did use the suggestion by a couple of people and put it into a hot cast iron skillet - it turned out great - and went very well with a slightly spicy chili.

The reviewers were right...this is the real thing!  Moist, tender, flavorful cornbread; just doesn't get any better than this.  The only thing that I did differently was to bake the cornbread into three mini loaves (for portion control) and baked for 25 minutes.  The two of us ate one loaf (actually 1-1/2) , and I froze the rest.  In my opinion, nothing needs to be changed in this recipe; this is just delicious cornbread!!

Awesome recipe. Very nice texture and flavor. Perfect amount of sweetness without being overboard. I put a brown sugar glaze on top after I pulled it out of the oven and that made this recipe even better. I didn't use buttermilk, but used sour skim milk instead.

This is fantastic! I made exactly as recommended, using wheat flour as suggested by the author. Perfect texture. A little on the sweet side, which is just how I like it. I wouldn't change the thing.

Kay's comment is based upon just another Southern cooking myth. The texture, sweetness and flavor of this cornbread was more than I expected and tasted exactly how my honey loves his cornbread.  I have recently returned to cooking from scratch and am now cooking for two.  I prepared this recipe specifically for my honey as he had asked for sweet cornbread.  I used 1.5 tsp of baking powder as I did not have the 1/2 t. of baking soda and 1/3 cup canned milk and 2/3 c. water with 3 T. white vingar as I did not have buttermilk. I baked the cornbread in a prepared 8 inch cast iron skillet for 40 minutes.  I prepared this along with Country Style Green Beans with Red Potatoes and Baby Back Ribs.  We had no room left for dessert tonight.  My honey said that all of the dishes could not have been prepared any better. There is nothing (almost) better than cooking for someone who loves me and appreciates good cooking.
UPDATE: I have made this recipe again and again in a skillet. Tonight I halved the recipe and used a muffin pan for 6. Filled each section 3/4 full and baked for 15 minutes. Made a deep slit in the tops of each and inserted a thick tab of butter. Perfection!

Loved it, didn't change a thing.  Don't normally like cornbread, but this was excellent.  Made it for a contest at work and the recipe won!  Great compliment to spicy chili.  Two people have already asked for the recipe.

Cut back sugar by 1/2 and it was still sweet and wonderful! My boyfriend asked that I cut it back a little more next time I cook it. Cooked in a cast iron skille and only cooked for 20 minutes. Great recipe!!

My husband loves cornbread and I've always hated it.  I tried this recipe for him and it turns out we both loved it.  I followed the directions exactly and this produced a sweet, delectable easy to slice cornbread.  We enjoyed it with homemade apple butter.

This is a fabulous recipe for sweet cornbread. My daughter says it is better than cake. I do melt the butter in a cast iron skillet and then pour the batter into this skillet to bake. I have found that I only need about 20 minutes to bake. If you bake too long, it will be dry. I cut and freeze wedges for future meals.

delicious. before anyone is tempted to reduce the sugar, understand that the final product has a very subtle sweetness to it. i added a dash of pepper for contrast. good enough to serve to company.

OK flavor but turned out slightly dry (and I did NOT over-bake them). Surprised, given the high rating. Added some shredded sharp cheddar to the batter, which I'd recommend for savoriness.

Very tasty!  Simple to make, and the outside was a little crispy just like I like it.  One change I will probably make is to cut down on the cooking time (although I suspect my oven might be the problem).  I left it in for 26 minutes, and although it was fairly moist, I think it would have been a little moister if I had taken it out 5 minutes earlier.  Overall, a very good recipe that I will definitely make again!

This was so good!  I did decrease the sugar to 1/2 c. and I think it could be even less and still be delicious.  I also used whole wheat flour.

Made this recipe exactly to spec and it was delicious - my family loves sweet cornbread and this was the perfect compliment/offset to a big pot of spicy chili we ate on all weekend.  I was feeding 7 adults and 3 kids and the pan was wiped clean - would need to double it next time!

Love the buttermilk in this, I made my own buttermilk with vinegar (1T cider vinegar in cup then topped up with milk and let sit on bench) I decreased sugar and added 2t chilli powder and 3/4 cup of cheese, most of it in the bread and a little sprinkled over top.  I used half white and half brown flour as we are brown bread fans and this gave it a little more texture which we like.

Good recipe. I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup as I sweeten my corn bread with honey butter and the majority of my household prefers it unsweetened. Also, instead of using buttermilk (because I had none), I used 1 cup of whole milk and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar as a replacement. I've used this substitute for numerous recipes and you can't even taste the difference.

I didn't think this was overly sweet at all. It was reminiscent of Jiffy as far as the level of sweetness, but it was definitely better. I doubled the batter and poured it into a 13x9 pan. Next time will serve with honey butter as I love a sweet cornbread!

This is wonderful cornbread, even using half the suggested sugar, it worked perfectly.  It's moist and plenty sweet and just dense enough to hold together, yet still retains enough grit from the cornmeal to let you know it's a cornbread and not a corn cake.  It was also so easy and clean-up friendly mixing it, as suggested, in the sauce pan I melted the butter in.   Everyone loved it.  Will definately make this again.  Bethany, thank you  for an outstanding recipe.

My initial feeling was that this is good cornbread, but I didn't notice that it tasted substantially different from any other corn bread I'd tried. On day two, however, I began to appreciate it more. It stays moist, unlike other cornbreads. The buttermilk does add something special. I cut back the sugar by about 1/6 of a cup, and I could have cut it back by more without the bread suffering as a result. My husband insists that I make this again soon. Next time, we're going to try using 1/2 cup of wheat flour in place of some of the white flour.

I am a huge fan of cornbread and have searched high and low for the perfect recipe.  THIS IS IT!  I can't believe how great this cornbread tastes - just the right amount of sweetness and its moist and holds together perfectly!  If you use salted butter - there is no need to add additional salt!  You will love this recipe!

This was fantastic!  I used half wheat flour because someone said I could, and I loved it.  So moist.  I don't have any cast iron, so I just made in a square glass pan.  I needed to use up some buttermilk, and this was a fantastic find.  This'll be my recipe for cornbread from now on.

Very good , did as others suggested and used less flour more cornmeal for a less cakey consistency other than that followed the recipe and came out awesome.  I also doubled the recipe with no problem, used a 9X13.

Outstanding. I'm making this again for the second time in two days.  I tweaked it just a bit to make it a tad healthier, using 2 tablespoons of butter and a heaping 1/4 cup of applesauce (to replace the 1/2 cup of butter). I decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and used egg beaters in place of the 2 whole eggs.

I added crumbled crisp bacon, about five strips, and I also added the bacon grease with the butter. This was really good. I made them into muffins and my three kids (10, 6, 3) ate over a dozen of them and over a dozen mini muffins too. My husband got one.

So Good!  My husband  said it was the best cornbread he has ever had!  I have made it twice in 2 weeks.  The first time I made it I wasn't paying attention and doubled the butter.  The second time I stuck to the recipe.  I would have to say the extra butter really made it better.

Love this and so easy to make!  Before sending their RSVP to our BBQ's everyone asks - you WILL have that cornbread, right?? Far and away the star of the show.  Everyone tries to imitate it, but this is the real deal.  Make it your 'family secret recipe!' and enjoy!

Exactly the kind of cornbread I was looking for.  I'm a Yankee through and through and need a sweet, moist cornbread for my chili.  Thanks for sharing!

This is unlike any other cornbread I've ever had! I usually don't have buttermilk on hand, so it was now or never. It was super quick to throw together and cooked up in exactly 30 minutes in my preheated cast iron. I always add butter and honey to my corn bread which was a mistake because this is really sweet by itself! Delicious though, but definitely using slightly less sugar next time. The buttermilk makes it a lot denser than regular corn bread and gives it a great depth of flavor. Adding this one to my recipes!

This recipe was a good compromise between me and my husband.  He prefers sweet corn bread and I prefer the not so sweet.  This was a pretty good combination of both.  I cooked mine in a glass pyrex dish and it turned out with a nice crust all around.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect.

This is incredible!!!! I dont really like cornbread (except for famous daves)... but this is so good, especially with homemade whipped butter.. I only used a half cup of sugar, I dont like it too sweet and I also added a little dash of extra salt but other than that, I followed it completely... this is the way cornbread is meant to be:)

This is the BEST cornbread we have ever had!  It is simple and never fails.  My husband is a Texan who does not like sweet cornbread and he says this is now his all time favorite.  He even wants me to make one and frost it for his birthday!  Thank you Bethany!

Godsend!  I am from the midwest and when I started dating my boyfriend from New Orleans, I tried to pick up some southern cooking skills.  He is the harshest food critic of all time, but when I made this cornbread recipe for him, he nearly died!  Now I practically make it weekly for him.  It is an absolute staple in our apartment!

i LOVE this recipe.  i have tried lots of different cornbread recipes from scratch & this is the best by far!  My husband who is a cornbread fanatic loves the texture and the flavor of this!  i don't usually have buttermilk in the house so i just substituted 1 c of milk with 2 tbsp white vinegar.  the first time i made this i substituted the buttermilk for some whipping cream with 2 tbsp of vinegar.  the batter was thick but it was yummy and rich! both came out perfect!

So yummy! The only thing I change is to bake at 350, but that could just be my oven.  Takes about 25-30 minutes at that temp.  And for those who are confused by the multiple pans, you can always just take a medium sized bowl, melt the butter in it, and start adding ingredients before you dump the finished batter into the greased square pan.   Oh, and I tried reducing the sugar and it's not as good, so I'd recommend keeping it as is.  This is my go to recipe!

I'm not a cornbread fan, but this was really good.  It almost tasted like cake!  I used lemon juice with milk for the buttermilk, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

Very moist with a bit of crunch from the cornmeal.  I like it served warm with butter and maple syrup (maybe it is a Canadian thing?).  My mom used to make "Johnny Cake" which is very close to this recipe and throw in ham, cheese and jalepenos.

The best tasting cornbread I've had in a Long time!  I also used a skillet to bake the bread in and mine took only 21 minutes.  One other change - I used 1/3 cup of sugar and just over a Tbsp. of white Stevia powder (an all natural, zero calorie sweetener).

My husband said, "You made these from scratch!" Yes, Honey I did. Very good. In my oven, I need to watch the cooking time because the bread was slightly over baked.

Mmm, very good.  I was looking for a recipe with at least the same amount of cornmeal as flour, because I like them crunchy.  Made this into muffins, baked 20 mins, and they were yummy and moist.  Now I'll always use this cornbread recipe!

What an excellent cornbread recipe!  I converted this recipe to a gluten-free cornbread recipe and it was by far the best cornbread ever I have had!!!  I have fixed for many, and no one knows it is gluten-free.  I am always just looking for a really good base to my recipes, just like this one, and can convert them on my own. My daughter 11-year-old daughter has Celiac disease, so I work extremely hard perfect recipes for her.  She didnt even like cornbread before this recipe .  .  am thrilled to have found it!  Excellent cornbread!!!

DELISH!! My family devoured it...the entire batch was gone within minutes. I am tripling the the recipe and taking to work for an event. I'm sure they will be a hit! I followed the recipe but used a 13x9 pan, which made for thinner slices but this was a tester batch. Now I can make a larger batch with confidence!

VERY easy, classic cornbread. My new go-to recipe for this. And ... it stays MOIST! Love it, and it got rave reviews from those who tasted it. Tip: Use coconut oil to grease the pan! It adds a lovely, subtle toasted coconut nuance! And it's GOOD for you!

Excellent recipe and I absolutely loved it.  It's cornbread just like my mother used to make.   My grandchildren loved it too.   Thank you, Bethany!! I'd only offer one simple suggestion:  Melt the butter in a pot instead of a skillet.   That will make things much easier when you begin to add the other ingredients and for pouring the mixture into your baking dish or iron pan.

This recipe is delicious as it is written.  However, I find that adding corn kernels and diced jalapeno pepper kicks it up a notch.  I prefer to bake this recipe in a muffin pan.

This cornbread could not have been more delicious! My boyfriend loves cornbread and we've generally loved Jiffy, but couldn't find it. This recipe baked up moist delicious cornbread that rivaled any store brand. We did add some canned sweet corn for flavor!

I just made this to go with chili that my boyfriend was making, I made a double batch exactly to the recipe and there were 25 and now there are only 4 left!  Everyone loved them and everyone had to have seconds!  I've never made cornbread before but this is the recipe that I will always turn to!  Thank you so much!

I had too much buttermilk in my fridge, so I thought this would be a great recipe to use it in. I usually make the Jiffy cornbread from the box, but this recipe was much, much better. My husband remarked that it was even better than Boston Market's cornbread, which he holds in high regard. Very tasty!

These are very good.  My cornbread did not seem as moist as what some of the reviews were saying.  I was looking for a very moist bread like you find at restaurants.  That being said my 7 year old ate 3 pieces of bread in one sitting.

Made a few substitutions cause of the crowd I was gonna be serving it for and due to not having a few things on hand. I did half country crock/half applesauce instead of butter, sour skim milk instead of buttermilk, and subbed in splenda for half of the sugar. I typically wouldn't post a review after having changed so much, since usually recipes that I make these sort of substitutions in never taste as good as the original...but even with all the subs, this came out FABULOUS. You positively cannot screw this recipe up. Will definitely make again as directed just to see how it turns out.

Jiffy who?  I will never make another boxed cornbread again.  This was the BEST cornbread I have ever had.  It was moist and sweet.  We all love this including my extremely picky stepson, who kept asking for me to make it again!  One last thing....it was so easy to make too!

The sugar addition to this recipe is what makes this recipe stand out for me.  It had a sweet and salty flavor that I haven't found in other Cornbread recipes.  Next time I make this I will need to add the sugar and eggs a little quicker though because I think if you wait the sugar tends to sit more at the bottom of the pan when cooking.  Loved it though!

I was so disappointed in this recipe.  While the texture and moistness of the cornbread was perfect, the flavor was completely bland.  The cornbread didn't taste like anything.  I even added a half can of corn for flavor and texture.  I will attempt to alter the recipe, but it in no way deserves such stellar reviews in my opinion.

This was my first attempt at Cornbread without a mix.  I served it up warm at a family gathering.  It recieved RAVE reviews.   The bread stayed together and didn't crumble or get dry.  I will never go back to my mix.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Easy as can be! I too did not have buttermilk and first measured 1.5TBSP of lemon juice and then filled the skim milk to the 1c line and sit for 5 min. Worked fine. Bread perfectly moist even more delicious with butter. I may try adding fresh corn in next time. But did not really miss a cast iron skillet as I thought I must have.

Sweet, moist, and dense!  All the perfect qualities in cornbread!!! I brought it to a super bowl party to pair with some chili and received many compliments on it! I doubled the recipe, added a can of corn, and spread butter on the top when I took it out of the oven.  Other than that, I stuck to the recipe and it was great!

Fabulous recipe - the best cornbread I have made from scratch.  Please read Bethany's latest posts on the steps - it is so easy!  I took others advice and made in a cast iron skillet in the oven - using Crisco to grease and pre-heating it before I put the batter in.  The cooking time was considerably less - just make sure you keep an eye on it.  Four teenage boys polished this off in a matter of seconds - they said it was the best they ever had.

I have made this recipe twice as cornbread Muffins.  My only addition being the fresh zest of one orange.  They are the best CM Muffins that I have ever made!

This cornbread is AMAZING. I made it exactly as specified and it was delicious (of course, anything with an entire stick of butter in it is bound to be pretty tasty :)

Work was having a chili day, so I decided to try this recipe and another (plain recipe) from a different site.  Although this was good, I was a little nervous because we had someone bringing Marie Calendar's cornbread (and I REALLY like that one).  Well, ate a piece of Marie Calendar's with the chili....and then a piece of this one....and liked this recipe better!!!   Yes, it is sweet (not too sweet though), so if you are looking for that plain flavor, this is not the recipe for you.  I will keep this recipe in my files and toss out my other one.  I do like sweetened corn bread and will make it again.  I've never made cornbread before, and this recipe was simple.

Unbelievable!!!!  This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted!!  I tried to follow the recipe exactly but didn't have any buttermilk on hand so I used 1/3 c cream and 2/3 c 2% milk instead of the 1 cup of buttermilk.  I can't imagine it being any better but I'm sure that with the right ingredients, it would be!  Thank your Grandmother for this wonderful recipe and thank you Bethany for sharing it.

Perfect as is. I have made it twice, once in a pre-heated cast iron skillet and baked it for 30 minutes and once in a silicone muffin pan for 20 minutes and it was awesome both times. I added a deseeded jalapeno the second time. I liked it both ways. Next time I might add some cheese.

Fantastic!  I love that this cornbread is moist instead of dry and crumbly.  Doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 cake pan.  Baked up beautiful, thick and stayed in tact when sliced into pieces.  Everyone loved it!

Absolutely delicious. I agree, the only way to cook cornbread is in a cast iron skillet. Followed other reviewers by heating up my pan and cooking it in there - came out wonderfully!

Absolutely perfect!!  This recipe will be "The Cornbread Recipe" in my house.  Great texture and flavor, and it sliced up beautifully.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 1 cup of regular milk with 1 tsp of apple cider vinegar.  Everyone in my family thought it was delicious.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe Bethany!

Fabulous! The best corn bread I have ever tasted. It has just the right amount of sweetness and it was very moist. The only thing I did different was in the mixing process. I pre-whisked the eggs in a bowl before adding to the butter sugar mixture in the skillet. Although I removed the skillet from the heat before stirring in the sugar, as the recipe stated, and stirring the eggs in as quickly as possible, the eggs seemed to start cooking (I saw a few small bits of cooked egg in the mixture) so I immediately added the buttermilk mixture to cool it down. I then added the wet ingredients from the skillet to the bowl of pre-measured and mixed dry ingredients. I baked in an eight inch round pan vs square for the same amount of time. Came out perfect!

Best homemade cornbread that I have ever had other than the boxed Jiffy's. The first time I tried this recipe, it turned out horrible. The cornbread smelled like  spoiled eggs and the crumbs were huge. (I cooked it in a loaf pan the first time) I decided to give it a try again, this time baking it in a casserole dish and it turned out "SUPERB". Five stars for the person who came up with this recipe.

wow..i am still laughing at how ridiculously foolproof this recipe is. Being the health nut that i am, i decided to use canola oil rather than butter. Thing is, i overheated the oil, so when i added the sugar, it crystallized. I figured that it was because the oil was too hot. not wanting to add the egg immediately, i waited a few minutes. however, when i added the egg, the oil/sugar was still too hot. in essence, i scrambled the egg. since i had a whisk in my hand, i quickly whisked the  mixture. it looked rather disgusting at this point, but i was just like whatever and put the rest of the ingredients in. I baked it as instructed and expected a hard, repulsive tasting brick, but omg..it turned out perfectly. there were no egg lumps or whatnot. the cornbread was soft and moist and the crust was so wonderful. i am definitely going to use this recipe again (using my canola oil =) (but i'll try not to scramble the egg or fry the sugar) lol i'm still laughing at myself.

this is amazing and delicious cornbread. It is the BEST! I am a bit of a food snob when it come to homemade cornbread and this is the best one ever. Even my kids and hubby who aren't as big of a fan as I am loved it. There are no changes to make.

This cornbread was pretty good but not a 5 star for me because it was a little too sweet.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe except that I used Egg Beaters for the eggs.  I've never used them before but supposedly they can be used in place of eggs with no noticeable difference.  I don't see how they would have affected the sweetness anyway.  If I decide to try this recipe again, I will reduce the sugar a little...maybe to 1/2 cup...and use real eggs.

I've been looking for a reliable cornbread recipe, and I think I've found it!  It has the "perfect" kind of flavor like the box kind, but it's so much better homemade!  I baked it in a mini scone pan from Williams Sonoma for 27 minutes

It looks very pretty and takes like no time to make. I thought I prepared the recipe as followed... but mine turned out very dense, dry, and unflavorful :(  I wish I liked it better, but I guess our family will just have to stick to Jiffy cornbread. I made cornbread porridge (milk, cornbread, sugar, and nuts heated up together in microwave) the next morning and it was okay. Just not the recipe I was looking for, I guess.

All I have to say is YUMMY!  The best I have ever eaten.  It was moist and soft just the way I like it.  I did cut back the sugar to 1/2 cup just because we like it with butter and honey.  Thank you for such a great recipe.

Unbelievably good!  Some changes I made: I substituted the all purpose flour for Gluten Free APF.  I also used a fraction of the sugar yet included Agave syrup for added sweetness.

These were very good, will be making again. It was moist and just the right amount of sweet.  I also made cornbread muffins and cooked them about 20 minutes.   I'm probably the only person that'd ever done this, but make sure you get REGULAR Cornmeal...and not self rising/cornmeal mix

This is the only cornbread recipe I will use!! It is sweet, moist and delicious!!! It's kind of fattening but it's so good that I refuse to alter the recipe! I use Healthy Blends 50/50 butter.

If you looking for a rich, sweet cornbread recipe, you have found it here!  This was a wonderful treat--my family of four ate the whole pan with dinner.  Even my husband, who claims not to like cornbread, polished off two pieces!  I wouldn't change a thing.

Incredible cornbread!  My family likes a sweeter cornbread (like the Jiffy box mix) and they LOVE this.  I don't always have buttermilk on hand so I soured my milk by adding a tablespoon of vinegar to a cup of milk and letting it sit for a few minutes.  I have tripled this recipe and it just fit into a 9" x 13" pan.  When doing this I had to increase the baking time just a bit.

First, this is a very tasty cornbread.  It has a slightly sweet flavor and is very moist.  I melted the butter, mixed all the ingredients, and baked the cornbread in my old well-seasoned 12” cast-iron skillet and it came out fantastic.  I did mix the flour, cornmeal and salt in a separate bowl but everything else I mixed/melted in the cast iron skillet.  It took 30 minutes to bake and was wonderful.  I allowed it to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes after baking.  Running a knife around the inside edge and then flipping the skillet the cornbread came out of the skillet perfectly.  Not like my grandmothers cornbread and needed a huge wad a butter just to be able to swallow it was so dry.  Definitely a keeper.

This is amazing cornbread - I almost ate a whole pan by myself. The annoying ingredient is buttermilk, which I often don't have on hand, but it's worth it. I tried a recipe on the back of a cornmeal box and it was not good at all compared to this.

Update: If you put a tablespoon of lemon juice in a cup of milk and let it sit for a few mins, it substitutes for buttermilk.

This is an excellent cornbread.  Made it as directed in recipe.  I did, however, find that it was more of a cake like consistency than what I have had for cornbread at restaurants.  Will do again but I also am looking for cornbread with more of a crumbly consistency.  Any ideas?

I've always had my eye out for a good corn bread recipe and now i've found it. I coated a cast iron skillet with bacon grease, preheated it and poured the batter (made exactly like the directions say) in it. It came out wonderfully. My husband even said it was the best cornbread he had ever ate. Thanks for a great recipe.

Cornbread just the way I like it! Sweet and moist. I can't have cow's milk so I substituted 1/2c of goat milk yogurt and 1/2c of soy milk for the buttermilk. I baked it in a cast iron skillet and the crispy edges were so yummy. Just remember to decrease either the baking time or the temperature if you do that.

My husband loved this cornbread. No more boxed mix for us.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of adding a tiny bit of bacon grease to the pan to give the bread a smoky flavor.  Making it again today and will use a cast iron skillet.

Upon reading most top-rated reviews; I have decided to try this recipe only with the following minor tweaks: -    * Used 1/2C All Purpose Flour and 1/2C Wholemeal Flour.  * Mixed 2 TBSP of Cider Vinegar and filled my milk up to a cup; like most people.  * Whisked the dry ingredients, set aside; then followed by wet ones and finally combined both.    My cornbread came out perfect after 35 min of baking for 375 degrees! NO HARD WORK AT ALL IN MAKING THIS WONDERFUL BREAD!!! It is not overly sweet but moist from within.     I really regretted of not doubling the recipe as advised by the recipe submitter coz after 2 hours cooling, I only had a piece left! No wonder this recipe has got raves from most folks...

Great recipe-  turns out perfect every time.  Definitely use a cast iron skillet.  This will provide a better crust on the bottom of the cornbread.  This bread goes very well with jambalaya- I won't make a pot without the cornbread.   I always add a few extra tablespoons of honey for a little more sweetness.  This way, the leftovers are great as breakfast with a little butter and honey.

I have thrown away 2 batches of cornbread using other recipes.  Im glad I didn't give up. This one is a keeper.  It just came out perfect.  I thought I would be able to taste the buttermilk in the finish product, but you can't.  I made these in a cupcake pan.  I mixed 3/4 of the butter into the batter.  Use the remain 1/4 to grease the cupcake pan.  Only took 22min to bake at high altitude (5000 ft).  I pulled them out as soon as the toothpick came out clean.  Edges were golden brown and crunchy.  Moist inside, Not too dense and not overly sweet for me.  Just perfect.   Oh yeah, full recipe makes 14 cupcakes.  Fill each 2/3 full.

Excellent cornbread recipe!  The best part of this recipe is that the cornbread is sweet and moist (even after it cools).  I made it exactly as stated but doubled the recipe (used two large catering bake pans). Put both in the oven and only cooked it for 40 minutes max.  Keep an eye on it.  Don't want the sides to burn.  I used an electric beater to blend it well.

I made this as directed with a couple exceptions.  I used my cast iron pan and let the batter less the salt and flour set while the oven/pan were preheating.  I melted some lard (yes lard, its great for pie crusts) in the pan then added the batter. Also I melted the butter in a glass bowl in the microwave and then added remaining ingredients as called for in the bowl, instead of using skillet on stove top and mixing in skillet. The end result is a super yummy bread that is moist and well balanced, just enough sweetness.  This is a more NE style corn bread, not southern.  But don't let that stop you, its easy and great with BBQ, chili, breakfast, just about anything.

I preheated the cast iron skillet with veg oil as recommended by another reviewer.  Poured the batter into the pan and then drizzled honey on top.  This turned out excellent.  Will make again.

This is the best cornbread ever!  It is dense, sweet and moist.  I entered a pan in the cornbread/chili cook off and won!  People at work were scrapping off the crumbs to get more!  Thanks for a great recipe.

There is a reason this recipe has five stars!! Amazing!   I almost didn't make it because I didn't have a full 1/2 cup of butter. But I read the reviews, and decided to go for it, and subbed a couple of tablespoons of oil for the missing butter. It was still the best cornbread I have ever tasted. This is dangerous good. :)

I lOVE this stuff. It's delicious, it freezes and reheats well and my picky cornbread family loves it. It's sweet, but not too sweet and easily adaptable to whatever palate you are serving. I always use a greased and preheated cast iron to bake it in and sometimes add cheese, bacon or jalapenos (and sometimes all of them!) for a change of pace.

I have made over 50 different variations of cornbread, and this was hands down the BEST cornbread I have ever made. My kids couldn't stop eating it, and before dinner was even over my husband was asking if I could bake more to take with him to work the next day. It was creamy, sweet, and just delicious!! Thank you for adding this recipe, you just added a staple in our household!!

Excellent recipe.  I actually made a mistake with the ingredients and it still turned out very good.  What I did was doubled the batch and doubled everything except for the butter. Very tasty and moist nonetheless.  I will definitely be making this again!

We went to the beach this summer and had some amazing sweet cornbread at a seafood restaurant. I have never liked cornbread but my husband loves it. So I searched on here and found this. While it isnt the same it does the job. Now my husband and I both can enjoy cornbread! I gave it 5 stars because its the only cornbread I like!! Its GREAT!

This recipe was a major hit!  Stayed moist for several days.  The only thing I added was I brushed the top with honey butter once it came out of the oven.  Mmm Mmm so good!

This is one of my favorite recipes! I make them with 1/2c whole wheat flour and 1/2c all purpose, and I cut the sugar back to 1/2c. I prefer them as muffins.

Very good corn bread.  For us it has the perfect flavor.  I had 6 minutes left when I thought it was done, it wasn't so I let it go for the total 30 minutes.  Next time I'll set the timer at 27 minutes and I think that will be perfect.  Thanks for sharing.

I have made this recipe 7 times in the last 2 weeks.  Enough said.  We love it.  I even used an ear of fresh corn in a double batch and it turned out delicious and superbly moist.  A very hearty cornbread.

My advice, "Double it!" This is a recipe the kids will love! I doubled the batch, made one bread a bit smaller than the second and oh my, how beautiful was the larger (i.e. higher) one! The best part was the taste! Phenomenal! I like this recipe with or without the sugar depending on my mood. If you like yours sweet, go all the way with the sugar. If you don't like sweet cornbread, leave it out - you can't go wrong. Awesome either way! Funny story...only had grits last night and no cornmeal. Put it through the coffee grinder, substituted and out came the most delicious cornbread and no one had the slightest idea. I live in Spain where we make do with what we have. Delicious! I will look no further. I have found the perfect cornbread recipe! THANKS!

What an amazing recipe! It's not dry, it's sweet and so tasty! I melted the butter in a cast iron pan, then added the sugar and eggs.  I mixed the rest of the ingredients in a bowl then mixed everything together - right in the pa - then placed it in the over.  PERFECTION!  I should also add that I threw in a handful of frozen corn and used medium coarse corn meal which gave it a nice texture. A keeper.

Oh my gosh, I've been looking for so long for a cornbread recipe like this one!!  It's wonderful, we made NO changes.  Had a few pieces leftover and they were even better the next day.  (Stored them in a ziplock bag and believe it or not they seemed even moister!)

This was my first time making cornbread and I thought it was terrific!  I did not think it was too sweet.  Other than the side pieces, it was very moist.  I suggest checking to see if it is done a few minutes before the time listed.  I definitely plan to make this again.

Like everyone else, I've tried tons of recipes and this has to be the BEST! I have a sweet tooth, so this was the first time I've found a recipe that was sweet AND moist. I served it with my homemade chicken chowder soup. It was great for soaking up the broth! I did have to use up some plain yogart I had in the fridge & it worked great! Every oven and baking dish is different, so I check all my baked recipes 5-10 minutes before the recommended time.

This was yummy, much better than typical mix cornbread. I will use less sugar next time, as it was too sweet for my personal preference.  I did find that refrigeration didn't do it any favors. Be sure to wrap it up tightly!

Perfect - hands down the best cornbread recipe of many I've tried. It is incredibly moist and just sweet enough without tasting like cake. I will never need to try another recipe again. Although I hate it when reviewers include their substitutions, I had to substitute "fake" buttermilk (1 tablespoon vinegar + 1 cup regular milk) and it worked like a charm. DON'T skip the step where you cream the sugar, butter, and eggs together before adding other ingredients, and don't overmix when you add the dry ingredients.

Love this cornbread recipe.  I didn't find it overly sweet and will definitely be making this again.  For me it is the perfect accompaniment for a spicy soup or chili. Cooking time and temperature was pretty much bang on for my oven, 375* for 30 minutes.  Now I only wish I had doubled the recipe. Thanks, Bethany!

This is THE BEST cornbread recipe that I have found on this site!!! Some posters are complaining that this is too sweet??? Isn't cornbread SUPPOSED to be sweet? I grew up drizzling honey over it, fresh out of the oven. I made this to go with a bacon and potato chowder...EXCELLENT!!!

Good recipe but extremely too sweet. Otherwise it would have been 5 stars. I cut the sugar almost half and it was just right. Small dice jalepeno peppers make it even better!

im in love with this recipe! was curious about cornbread, being english, so i searched for a recipe, and came across this one, and im glad i did :) only thing was that none of us in my family could fathom why anyone would eat this with a savoury meal. we did try, and it was just sooo wrong lol but on its own as a snack, breakfast or for after dinner, simply gorgeous :) will play around with it, such as add chopped nuts and honey, but its a great recipe as it is. btw made this today using milk, not buttermilk or milk with vinegar, and it came out just as good. we are believers too now :)

I have been looking for a cornbread recipe that is like Boston Markets.  A little sweet and cakelike.  This is it!!! I made it just like the recipe called for and it was perfect with my chili, thanks for the recipe, Bethany and Grandma.

The best cornbread I have ever made. After making about a dozen times now, we prefer it with 1/2 cup of sugar, but it is very good as written. It is also very good with jalapenos and cheddar mixed in to pair with chili. And one bowl to clean is even better. Thanks for the great recipe!

This is the best sweet cornbread I've ever had (I like both the sweet, cakey kind and the grainy, unsweetened kind.) My husband went insane over this...he was still shoveling it in his mouth as he asked when I'd make it again! Since I didn't have buttermilk I substituted 1 tbsp vinegar for 1 tbsp of the milk and it worked just fine. It only needed 25 minutes in my oven. Delicious! Thank you!

Followed the recipe, but my cornbread did not turn out moist like the others'.  It was dry and crumbly, but the taste was good.  I don't think it's too sweet as some had commented.  Try it for yourself and leave the sugar as is.

Great recipe, perhaps the only thing to add to it is to add corn to the mixture before putting in the oven. It will add to the texture as well as help you get your serving of veggies.

Not too sweet, not too dense. I made this a couple nights ago and my kids DEVOURED it! They were asking to have the last of it for dessert (INSTEAD of ice cream!) This even after I'd accidentally set the temperature too high, making the bread turn out a bit dry. Tonight I'm making it again, but I'll double-check the temp. I've copied this one down. As another reviewer stated, this is now OUR family cornbread!

This was a major hit when I made it for a group of 11.  Very tasty, although I did modify a little.  I increased the cornmeal to 2 cups and reduced the flour to 1 1/2 and baked at 375 not 400.  I also increased the sugar to 1 cup. Excellent with a honey butter spread!

This is a very good cornbread recipe. I replaced 1/2 of the white flour with whole wheat, and it was still very good. I cooked mine in a greased, heated cast iron pan--if I hadn't done that I doubt I would have used any whole wheat flour though. The added grease from the pan counteracted the extra dryness from the whole wheat. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup--personal preference, I wanted my cornbread to be good with chili today, and good with honey for breakfast tomorrow!

This was my first time making cornbread and this is a great recipe. I followed it exactly and had no problems. I did have to make my own buttermilk by adding 1 tbsp of lemon juice to 1 cup of milk and leaving it for 5 minutes. I made them into muffins for a bbq and just reduced the time to 17 minutes. And incase you're wondering, 1/4 pound of butter = 1/2 cup or one block. Enjoy!

This is an excellent cornbread recipe! As recommended, I mixed all of the ingredients together in the skillet and then poured the batter directly into the pan. I also added a small can of sweet creamed corn to the mixture at the very end. This made the bread incredibly moist and very dense... almost like a cornbread pudding! Serve it with butter and it's absolutely delicious! Thank you for sharing your recipe. This one will be tagged as a family favorite!

Outstanding!  I've tried many cornbread recipes and they all turned out too dry for my liking.  This recipe is MOIST and delicious!  It does go stale/hard fast, but it usually gets eaten up the same day I make it.

This cornbread is really good!  I used Xylitol in place of sugar, Home-made yogurt instead of buttermilk, and I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat and 1/2 cup of oat flour instead of all-purpose flour.  As you can see, I made this as healthy as possible.

Very nice recipe. I didnt have any buttermilk on hand so i made my own with a little yogart, skim milk, and a bit of vinegar. I usually just buy a jiffy box of cornbread but this recipe is worth the effort. I followed other reviews and brought down the amount of sugar a bit, but next time i will try the full amount since i dont mind sweet. this recipe also is great because the corn bread looks great when finished. it is not overly crumbly and turns out a great color.

This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted. The recipe is perfect, I just preferred my 10 in. cast iron skillet and baked about 25 minutes. I can't thank you enough, my family simply RAVED about this! My favorite recipe so far on this website :0)

I make double batches of this in a 9x13 pan for my bread co-op I am in and it's ALWAYS a big hit!  It's the best cornbread ever!  I also have had to replace the buttermilk with milk/lemon juice mix when I've forgotten to pick up buttermilk.  I can't tell a difference!  It is SOOOOOO good & moist!  Just the way I like my cornbread!

Awesome recipe. I tried about a dozen corn bread recipes: Jiffy muffin mix, cake mix kinds, the ones on the back of corn meal mixes, and a couple more on this site. THIS is by far the best. My picky foodie husband LOVES it.

I baked this bread for the first time over a year ago. My family loves it! I finally tried making muffins with the recipe. I got 12 muffins and 11 mini muffins. They don't rise very much so you can fill the cups to the top. Of course, they were done faster than the bread.

I just pulled these out of the oven and wanted to try it before serving (always nervous serving something brand new to guests).  It was wonderful.  I did make one major alteration.  Since we can't buy buttermilk here (Japan) I used 3/4 cup fat free plain yogurt with 1/4 lowfat milk.  Otherwise I made as directed.  It is wonderful, and I'm picky about the sweetness in cornbread.  It's slightly sweet but not too sweet.

I have made this recipe 2x. I followed exactly as is and it was fabulous both times. I doubled it and baked it in a quarter sheet cake pan.

With over 1000 people rating this corn bread and 5 stars...this I had to try.   I just took it out of the oven and had my first piece.  It is just as other described...easy to make..great taste. Just simply perfect!   This is one of the few times I actually followed the recipe 'as is'.  No changes are required and the results are fantastic.   If you are thinking of trying this recipe...look no further. Thanks Grandma of Bethany !

Very good recipe!  I did make a simple change to it though. I don't drink milk so I used Vanilla Soy milk. I also used a mixture of white sugar and brown sugar. Thanks for sharing such a great recipe.

AWESOME!!!  The best, moistest cornbread I've had.  It's a little sweet for my taste, but that's just personal preference.  My husband LOVES it as is, and he's not even a cornbread fan.

I have NEVER liked cornbread ... until this recipe! After reading other reviews, I tried it with only half the amount of sugar, and while I really enjoyed it this way, I'm pretty sure I'd like it the original way, as well. I think it just comes down to personal preference, whether you're in the mood for sweet or not-so. Thank you for FINALLY allowing me to enjoy cornbread!

Very good, really liked the buttermilk taste. I used half of the butter and sugar, and found it sweet enough. I also used whole wheat flour instead of AP.

I used this for the cornbread on the Cheap and Easy Casserole recipe on this site.  Very yummy.  Don't have buttermilk?  No problem, put a tablespoon of vinegar into 1 cup of milk and let sit for 10 minutes.  Voila buttermilk substitute!

We never have a reason to keep buttermilk in our house, so we create our own!  In a 1 cup measuring cup, add 1tb lemon juice and fill the remainder of the cup with regular milk.  Let it stand for about 5 minutes and VOILA! Buttermilk!  This is very helpful since we are ADDICTED to this cornbread!  The best we've ever had--it always comes out light and fluffy!  Thank you for submitting this recipe!

Very moist and sweet- delicious! I agree with other reviewers who feel the only way to make cornbread is in a preheated skillet. However I took the advice of another review and preheated my skillet to 375 and found this was too hot and the edges burned slightly. Next time I will only preheat at 325 or for only 5 min at 375

I loved this cornbread! I thought it was the perfect blend of sweet and buttery. It is the perfect accompanyment to fried fish and collard greens. I will make this everytime I fry fish.

Ok so I made my change to it to cut out the fat and cut down on the calories...these were delicious! I just took a can of corn, measured out 1/2 C and put in my food processor; processed until it was fairly smooth (adding water from can as needed). Just replaced the butter with the pureed corn and used whole wheat flour instead of white flour, used 1 egg instead of 2. I also added the rest of the can at the end and folded in. I made in cupcake tins. Each muffin is only 140 calories (12 muffins), 1.5g fat, and 2.33g fiber, 4g protein, .5g sat fat.

WOW...that was awesome!  My kids don't normally like cornbread, but they sure kept asking for more of this.  My husband and I couldn't stop and next thing you know, it was gone.  Again, thanks for the super recipe.

We LOVED this!  It is perfect.  I like sweet cornbread, so I always used the boxed kind, but this is so much better.  It is moist and sweet, but you can actually tasted the buttermilk, too.  It is simple and easy to make and everyone who had it absolutely loved it.  I will definitely make this again - many, many times!!!

Absolutely, hands-down, the best cornbread recipe I've ever made. I found this about six months ago and every time I make it, it disappears very quickly. I like to run a pat of butter over the top of it when it first comes out of the oven. You will not be disappointed with this recipe, it's a keeper :)

I had a brainfart while making this (I'll blame it on my infant son waking up from his nap in the middle of me mixing the ingredients) and totally forgot to add the eggs. It still came out AWESOME! It's more dense than cake like without the eggs, which some may prefer. Also, I melted the butter and mixed the ingredients in my cast iron skillet, as others mentioned they did, and baked it in that. Used fat-free buttermilk powder, too. Great corn bread!

I made this the other day and I didn't like it at all. I followed the recipe exactly and I found that it was just blah.. It didn't look appealing, it wasn't really a rich yellow more of a pale one. maybe I'll try to bake it in a cast iron pan next time.

This turned out terribly, but I think that was because I tried to use too many low-fat, healthy ingredients to substitute into the recipe.  I won't make it again, though.

I really like this cornbread.  My brother eats cornbread a lot and he always says that you know that cornbread is good when it is not breaking up in clumps all over the place.  This one was nice and moist.  It would probably make great corn muffins too.  Would definitely recommend this recipe.

Even with the 1/4 lb of butter, this isn't the moistest cornbread I've ever had. Don't get me wrong, it's good, just not the best. I cut the sugar down to 1/3 c. and it was still plenty sweet enough. I strongly recommend frying this up in a cast iron skillet and topping with extra butter, it makes a big difference.

Best cornbread I ever tasted! Never buying jiffy again either.... Cook time/temp was a bit off for me, but I'll tweak it till it comes out right.  Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I doubled the ingredients and cooked in a cast iron skillet for 1 hour at 350 degrees. I will definetly make these again, but I will reduce, not exclude, the sugar.

This is THE BEST cornbread I have ever had in my life. It is sweet, moist, and perfect hot out of the oven. I baked my batter in a hot 8" cast iron skillet and served it with warm honey butter.  I have made this 4 times, and every one says it is really amazing.  I will never use another recipe!

The best cornbread recipe I've tasted - and I'm from the South. When baked, it got nice and golden on top - crunchy texture - and very soft and buttery on the inside. My husband's eyes rolled back in his head. He'd seen Heaven for a bit. Thanks!

The best cornbread I've ever eaten, and I'm a Southerner!  The only thing I did differently was I melted the butter in the baking pan in the oven while I prepared the other ingredients in a bowl.  I swirled the butter around the hot pan to "grease" it, then added it to my wet ingredients.  Thanks; I will make this recipe a personal favorite!

Amazing! Perfect amount of sweetness for me, though I like things sweeter than most, so might cut down the sugar to 1/2c next time for the others who will be eating it. I didn't have buttermilk, so I used another reviewer's suggestion of replacing 2 tbsp of milk with lemon juice. Baked in pre-heated 12inch cast iron skillet for 25min. Will definitely make again.

OMYGOSH was this good.  My family has been using the same cornbread recipe forever and this was so much better!!  It was just the right amount and sweet and the texture was so much smoother. I used good organic cornmeal, which may have made it even better.    Thanks!!

I don't often review recipes but this one is FABULOUS!! I substituted smart balance for butter, used egg whites instead of eggs and used fat free buttermilk to make it a little healthier. Total crowd pleaser, this is definitely a recipe I'll make over and over!!

I made this recipe the other day and it was so good that we couldn't stop talking about it.  So I decided to make it again last night but didn't have any cornmeal left.  Very disappointed.  So I decided to use semolina (ground durum wheat)it looks similar to cornmeal but it doesn't have the same taste.  Went ahead and made it and it was fantastic.  The only change I made was to use honey instead of white sugar.  Since it tastes so buttery I felt that the honey would add another dimension to the recipe.  It was great.  If I could give it ten stars I would.  I will buy more cornmeal today.

I have been searching for a good corn bread recipe and this is it.  I served it with chili for the super bowl game and received rave reviews.  This bread is very moist and dense.  It doesn't crumble when you cut it and has just the right amound of sweetness.  My husband is still raving about it.

To scale back on calories I used Splenda instead of sugar and used fat free half and half w/tbsp of vinegar in place of buttermilk.  I also used light margarine instead of butter.  These were delicious!

I chose this recipe because the ratings have been very good. I am very happy that I made this recipe! Thank you for sharing the recipe.  Since I am a diabetic I had to reduce the sugar to 1/3 cup and I also used organic yellow cornmeal, King Arthur white wheat flour and organic buttermilk powder with water (use 4 Tbsp. plus 1 cup of water) and the cornbread came out really, really good.

Just perfect!  Using the buttermilk makes all the difference.  I've used regular milk when I didn't have buttermilk and it is so much tastier with the buttermilk.  I always add a splash of vanilla because that's how my grandmother always made hers.  A keeper, I need look no further for a cornbread recipe.

This is my go-to cornbread recipe.  PERFECT!! I melted the 1/2 cup butter in the microwave instead of on the range. I poured the batter into a round pie plate and baked it for just under 30 minutes. Mmmmmm!!  I've also added 2/3 cup drained (squeezed out excess liquid) canned corn and made these into muffins.  So good!

This was delicious cornbread!  I had to make a few changes, because of what I had.  I didn't use buttermilk, because I didn't have any.  So I did the buttermilk substitute of milk/lemon juice (for every one cup of milk, use about two tablespoons less of milk and mix in two tablespoons of lemon juice instead).  Let it sit for a few minutes while it foamed and then poured it in.  Also, the company I was having over who would delight in this dish, wanted creamed corn in it, so without changing any ingredients around, I simply poured in a can of creamed corn and let it cook longer until it was set.  My company loved it and so did we!  Thank you for such a great recipe!  It's a keeper!  *I made this cornbread with Chili Rick's (from this site) and it was delicious together.*

This cornbread was good, a bit on the sweet side for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it! I will definitely use this recipe again but using little less sugar the next time.

I have tried many cornbread recipes from this site and this one is definitely the best I've tried.  It is so moist and has a good flavor!  I only had self-rising cornmeal so I omitted and salt and baking soda.  A keeper for us!

This is excellent cornbread! I give it 4 stars because the instructions could be better. Melt the butter in microwaveable mixing bowl and go from there. Or melt butter and combine it with  sugar in a mixing bowl. A mixing bowl is easier to clean up as well. Great cornbread! The instructions do not specify preparing a baking

This is THE BEST cornbread ever.  It turns out so lovely every single time!  Like others I always decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup, and add 2 Tablespoons lemon juice to my lactose free milk as a substitute for buttermilk.

Fantastic corn bread. I used a ratio of 2:1:1 cornmeal:all purpose flour:whole wheat flour. There was none left after the meal.

Great recipe!  I made this on New Year's Day with collards, black-eyed peas, sweet potato sticks and ham and it was a big hit with our guests.  Probably not something I would make on a regular basis due to the amount of butter, but it will definately be an annual treat.

I LOVED this cornbread! I didn't cook it completely, so the center was a bit soggy on the top, but I gobbled up all the good parts. Delicious. I used powdered buttermilk. First time using the powdered version, but I don't cook with it enough to keep it on hand. It was great, and I will definitely be making it again.

This cornbread is fantastic.   Even my picky husband who generally doesnt like cornbread gobbled it up.  I didn't have any buttermilk so I just added a dash of white vinegar into the skim milk.  It was moist, not dry at all.  Thanks for posting, this is a definite keeper.

I've made this a couple of times, and we love it.  Even my husband, who doesn't like cornbread, will eat this with no complaints.  It is so moist, always perfect with the recipe just as-is.  My nine year old daughter said today, "This cornbread makes my tastebuds feel like they are dancing on rainbows!"  Sums it up pretty well!

We really enjoyed this, and make it often!  Over time, I've made a few changes - sauteed about 1/2c corn in butter along with sliced jalopenos to taste and added those to the batter.  Reduced sugar to taste.  Finally, I preheated my skillet and melted butter on the bottom so that it sizzled when I poured the batter in - it gave a nice crispy crust on the top and bottom.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This is my first attempt at making cornbread.  I was a little skeptical but needed a quick side dish to accompany the dinner I was making.  Much to my surprise, this cornbread is delicious!  It is moist and plenty flavorful.  I followed the recipe exactly.  I didn't have buttermilk - but I made my own.  Put 1 tablespoon white vinegar in a 1 cup measuring cup.  Then add enough milk to make 1 cup.  Let it sit for 5 minutes, and then use it!

Really, really good. A little too sweet for me, that's the only change I'd make is to reduce the amount of sugar.  I used this to make dressing, but I couldn't keep my daughter from eating it. So good. makes 12 muffins. 400 degrees about 18 minutes

Amazing! We love the sweetness, its a great with a spicy chili.

Due to Egg allergies, I substitute the eggs for 2Tbs Ground Flax and 6Tbs water (simmered for 5 mins to give it a egg white consistnacy)

Due to Milk allergies, I use 1Cup homemade frozen corn making sure to get alot of the yummy corn liquids. (If I find the batter too stiff, I'll add some rice milk to get it to the right consistancy)

Turns out fabulous! As its Hubby and Kid approved, it will remail in my recipe repitoire!!

Wow, this was AMAZING. Made it exactly as written and wouldnt change a thing. Great consistency, moist, flavorful with a hint of sweet. This was my first time making cornbread from scratch and I'll NEVER go back to the box or mix again. Thanks for this!

This was so delicous! The only problem was that I think I overmixed it because it got all sticky like dough (not sure if it was supposed to do that, I doubt it), but it still came out really really delicous. I made it for Thanksgiving and it was all gone. I only wished I had doubled the recipe!

It could not have been any easier or any better. Everybody wanted the recipe. I did use heavy cream instead of the half&half or the milk and it gave the bread a richer moist texture.

I made a trial batch before Thanksgiving to try it out and thought it tasted too "cake-like". So for the real thing, I used 1.5 cups of cornmeal and .5 cups of flour. This gave a better, more corny taste. I also tossed in about a 1/2 cup of canned corn (not creamed). Don't worry. The corn will become really soft and disappear into the bread.

I have never reviewed a recipe before, but for this one I had to! I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out perfect! Tasty and moist cornbread. Beautiful texture and color. I greased and floured my pan, and it did not stick at all. Thank you very much for this recipe! It will be added to my favorites!

Really great when you want an old fashioned, sweet cornbread! The first time I made it, I only put 1/2c. sugar in, thinking 2/3 was way too much, but my husband said "I like really sweet cornbread!", so the 2nd time, I put it all in, and it turned out perfectly! Thanks for a great cornbread! We use it for chilis, soups and even breakfast!

i have made this cornbread every time we have soup. both my boyfriend and my mom always request me to make it for them. 

one tip - i've found it's better to grease the pan with shortening (the natural, non-hydrogenated kind). this makes it easier to get out of the pan and doesn't burn the bottom like butter.

Followed the recipe exactly aside from mixing it in the same pan and such (I don't have a cast iron skillet or anything). The flavor is EXCELLENT, but the texture was a bit off for mine. Not sure what happened there...it didn't come out looking like the photos others have shared. Maybe I did something wrong? Maybe I shouldn't have used extra large eggs (all I had)?

This is a great cornbread.  I've made it 3 times and it's always a big hit. I never have buttermilk on hand so I just use the lemon juice in skim milk and it turns out perfectly every time.

Excellent, slightly sweet cornbread.  I followed the recipe to the letter, except I baked it with some extra butter in a cast iron skillet.  It was devoured in one day by my boyfriend and my roommate.  Great with a soup or stew.

The best things about this recipe were its tender crumb and excellent flavor.  I liked the way the ingredients combined easily.  It is well balanced between the corn meal and flour, so that the finished product is not as gritty as some cornbread recipes.  Will make again.

I grew up with my mom making sweet cornbread out of a box.  This is so much better and so easy to make.  I do bake it in a cast iron skillet (because that is the only way to make cornbread).  I also use a milk/vinegar substitute if I don't have buttermilk on hand.  Usually I just put a tablespoon of white vinegar in the bottom of a liquid measure cup and then fill it the rest of the way with the milk.  Delicious.  I have already made it half a dozen times in 2 months.

This was a good way to use up some left over buttermilk.  I too decreased sugar to the sweetness we like.  Very easy to make.

I have made this both the standard way and then also "spiced up" with chopped jalapenos and lots of cheddar and pepper jack shredded cheese mixed in!! It adds a wonderful twist that will be sure to please the men in your house!

This is an excellent, reliable cornbread that's moist, light and slightly sweet. (Actually, I reduce the sugar to 2 Tb, otherwise it's sweeter than I care for a savory cornbread to be.)

I use sour milk instead of buttermilk -- 1 Tb. lemon juice to the milk called for in the recipe, and I let it sit while I mix the dry ingredients.

I made this for lunch today and the whole family really enjoyed it!  However I made a few healthy modifications: I replaced the butter with 1/2 cup canola oil, I used only 1/2 cup sugar (and that was plenty!), and instead of buttermilk I used 1 cup milk, of which I replaced two tablespoons with lemon juice.  This was the simplest recipe ever and it tasted heavenly - plus it was beautiful to look at, all golden and perfect!  And the outside was so crispy and sweet!  I'm definitely going to use this recipe very often.

Tangy, sweet and delicious!  Mine came out a little crumbly, but who cares; the crumbs taste just as good. :) I made the recipe exactly as written, but I'm going to try this a variety of ways in the future: as muffins and in a cast iron skillet that my boyfriend's grandma passed down to him.  Don't try "making" buttermilk; cave in and buy the real stuff or else it won't taste the same.

Fabulous!  By far the best cornbread I have ever made!!  Why anyone would want the dry tasteless kind is beyond me.  I will never make any other cornbread but this one.  I wonder  how this would be made into muffins??

As a southerner, I have to say that this falls short of good cornbread... but as a cornbread cake it's not too bad. We actually make a similar recipe at work and add blueberries to it. It sells well this way, but we've  had some people complain about our labeling the plain version "cornbread."  In the south cornbread is never sweet but rather dense and moist with a deep corn flavor. We use only white cornmeal and never add sugar.

Best cornbread I have ever tasted. I have already made it twice this week. The kids love it and so does my husband. Thanks for sharing. PS to make it easier, I melted the sugar & butter, pulled the pan off the heat and added the other ingredients as instructed. I transfer the mix to the baking dish and clean up is a breeze!

I reduced the flour to 1/2 cup and used 1 cup medium grind cornmeal and 1/2 cup finely ground corn flour as I like a slightly more dense, textured bread. I also didn't have enough butter for baking and for slathering, so I used a mixture of light olive oil and vegetable oil instead, and added a bit of extra salt to make up for flavor, and it turned out wonderfully.

I also soaked the corn meal in buttermilk for about a half hour before mixing the ingredients in baking - I find it helps with the coarser grind, makes things a little moister. 

This turned out dense, moist and not too sweet. Next time, I'll probably cut back on the sugar and perhaps substitute a little honey

Amazing! Two-thirds of sugar is edible, but half a cup is by far better for those who like to add honey-butter to their cornbread. Cast-iron skilet is amazing, heated or not...gives the bread a delicious texture. Moist & delicious...I won't be using another cornbread recipe again!

This recipe is INSANE!! It's quite sweet and rather cake-like but was the perfect compliment to smoked bbq ribs and baked beans. I made it at the cottage for my husband's family reunion and there wasn't a piece left. It was baked in a cast iron skillet (preheat skillet in oven, add 1-2 tbsp oil or butter, allow to melt, swirl pan to coat bottom, pour in cornbread batter and return to oven, cooking for 25-30 minutes or so)... it produced beautiful crust. Also added 1 can (drained) of corn kernels. Excellent, excellent, excellent. My years long quest to find the perfect cornbread is now over!

This was good~ I took some of the other suggestions & subbed in skim milk+1 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar for the buttermilk/ 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour for the white flour (which did alter the color of the cornbread a bit) & reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup b/c I'm trying to cut back on sugar (but this does make it less sweet than maybe what you would get in a restaurant) ... i was worried when I mixed in the eggs & saw bits of it "cooking" even though the heat was off. But it was fine once it baked - it still rose pretty well & i didn't notice any "egginess" to the cornbread ... this does make a more cake-like cornbread ... so for those who prefer a crumblier/rustic texture should look for another recipe ...

I have been looking for a good cornbread recipe for about a year.  I followed the recipe exactly and it's perfect for me.  This is the best, and is closest to my Mom's.  This is the only recipe that I will use.

Absolutely delicious!! I now live in England but have always loved my mother and grandmother's southern cornbread. I brought back my grandmother's cast iron cornbread stick pan on a recent trip to Florida but didn't have her recipe. This recipe more than lives up to the memories I have and I will add it to my list of favourite things to bake. Thank you.  The only amendment I made was to reduce the sugar to 50g.

This recipe made a cornbread that was rich and moist. It turned a nice, gold brown color, rather than the typical yellow. It's also the easiest cornbread I've made, reminiscent of the cornbread I ate at the road house in Seattle. I love sweet breads! 

Very yummy, would compliment any soup or meat.

been searching for recipe for a long time...this is IT!  tweeked a little bit.. reduced sugar to 1/4 c white sugar...1/4 c brown sugar...and added about a TBSP of honey. Wasn't as high as the picture, but very flavorful.  it's more of a dense consistency rather than crumbly.   loved by all! oct 09 ---used preheated cast iron skillet....wow!

First of all, mixing everything in the skillet is not a good idea. I would rather dirty another dish than have to deal with that again. I only put in 1/2 c. of sugar, and it was just right. I put it in muffin tins and cooked it for about 20-25 mins. I would make this again, but maybe with more sugar.

This was just about the best cornbread I've ever made. It it makes allot and I had
plenty of leftovers that we ate for the next three days. This bread was as moist and tasty on day three as it was from the oven.I can't wait to make it again.

I really don't take the time to rate things very often on this site unless I think they are phenomenal. 

This morning I decided to make my boyfriend breakfast and thought cornbread would really complete the meal. This knocked his socks off. He LOVED it. Ate almost the whole thing. 

I did make a few changes though. I used low fat earth balance vegan "butter" instead of regular butter, whole wheat flower instead of white and 1 cup of whole milk (minus 2 tablespoons),replaced with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice instead of the buttermilk because I didn't have any on hand. It came out great! At the end I poured a bit of melted earth balance over the top. 

Will definitely make again! Thanks :]

If I could give it 6+ stars, I would. This was AWESOME!! I have been searching for a sweet, moist cornbread for years! I like my cornbread on the sweet side, so it was perfect. Hey, if you don't like it sweet, use less sugar to what you like. Perfectly moist also. I guess I just don't see how it could be dry??? Mine was cooked perfectly  in an 8x8" glass Pyrex dish, in a gas oven for 33 minutes. They ONLY thing I added extra was 1/2 a cup of sweet corn (well, because I like my cornbread that way and it wasn't going to alter it much). You have to take the pan off the heat and let the butter/sugar cool off a bit before you add your eggs, like many reviewers say, but I already knew that. Heat+eggs=cooked eggs.... not good.

I will make an extra batch dairy-free next time for my 2 & 3 yr old who can not have dairy. I didn't notice the review on making it dairy-free until after I had already baked mine.
We made Cajun pork chops, green Italian salad (family recipe) and grilled peaches with it tonight, but I think I would love it with chili or some nice pulled pork BBQ! YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!

I normally use the Golden Sweet Cornbread recipe on this site (healthier & ingredients are on hand), however, this was a treat! If I have buttermilk on hand, I will definitely be using this recipe! I let the cornbread cool 5 minutes out of the oven, then I squirt honey over in a cross-hatch pattern--keeps it moist.

I'm sorry, but TRUE Southern Cornbread does not have sugar or honey, or any sweetener.  Our friends 'from the north' are the ones who did that.  This goes back 300 years!!

I was very disappointed in this recipe. It was dry. The recipe on the Alber's cornmeal box is far better and doesn't carry 1/4 lb. of butter. Mine would have been even more dry if I hadn't ignored the cooking time and pulled it out of the oven at 28 minutes.

This recipe is super delicious. Very moist, buttery and light tasting (density wise not calorie wise). It is not dry at all. I made it with the slow cooked ribs from this site. They are delicious together. Thanks for the recipe.

very good....I was surprised the amount of sugar didn't completely overwhelm the taste.  Still seems like a lot of sugar though

THE PERFECT SWEET CORNBREAD. VERY CLOSE TO JIFFY BUT WITH MUCH CRISPIER CRUST BECAUSE OF THE AMOUNT OF BUTTER. DEFINITELY NOT A DIET RECIPE BUT EVEN HAVING TO EAT A SMALL PIECE MADE IT WORTH MAKING! I DID TAKE THE LIBERTY OF MAKING A FEW CHANGES. I WILL SHARE THEM AS IT MADE IT EASIER AND QUICKER FOR ME.. MAYBE YOU WILL AGREE!

use self rising flour and self rising cornmeal.. both White Lilly brand. omit the soda and salt.
melt butter in skillet on top of stove (mine is gas so i didn't have to remove from heat... only turned it off)when melted remove from heat and add sugar (this is as sweet as jiffy, for more cornbread-like, i would decrease to 1/2 cup or even 1/4. for more cake like increase to a full cup!) when sugar and melted butter are very mixed, QUICKLY QUICKLY  whisk in eggs... careful, they will start to cook, it's okay if you see some tiny strands of white that look like they are cooking... keep whisking (with WHISK). i ADDED CORNMEAL AND FLOUR RIGHT INTO MY SKILLET AND SLIPPED THE WHOLE THING RIGHT INTO MY PREHEATED OVEN!

my skillet was about 9" round and it almost over cooked at 35 minutes... start watching at 25 minutes. it varies according to our individual oven settings. hope this helps! and thanks to whoever created this great recipe!

Awesome!!!  I made this to go along with a tortilla soup recipe on this site.  It was perfect.  My only advise is to both grease and flour your pan.  I greased mine and it still stuck really bad.  So tastey, though.

We just made this recipe for our house (multiplied the recipe by 6, and it was all gone at the end of dinner). It was amazing! We reduced the sugar to 3/4 of the total and could have reduced a little more. Also used halved the buttermilk with whole milk. We got an amazing caramelized crust, and a soft moist interior. Yum. There's actually no need to change anything else, but next time, we'll use less butter to not torture our arteries as much.

This recipe was so easy and so delicious. I'm usually intimidated by bread recipes but I was looking for something to do with some leftover buttermilk and this doesn't require wheat and it tastes good good good. Mix it with some beans, like me mum used to do!

I get frustrated with people who rate a recipe great but then list the changes they made.  I try always to try the recipe as given first, then make changes.  However, I was intrigued with one reader's adding cheese and bacon and so for my first try on this recipe, I added 1 cup cheddar cheese and 1/2 cup whole kernal corn.  This recipe is obviously divine without my additions becuase it melted in our mouths.  There was no need for the butter I placed on the table.  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe and to those of you trying it for the first time, add anything you like...it'll be delicious.

This is simply the best cornbread ever.  It truly does taste like my grandma's corn bread.  I tried it exactly as the recipe said and it was terrific!  The kids gobbled it up, no left overs for stuffing! Then I tried it using heavy cream instead of the buttermilk and it was yummmmy.  The heavy cream made it thicker and more moist. I like it both ways.  Will make it time and time again! A true family favorite!

The perfect homemade taste. Exactly what I was looking for. 

Be sure to bake in a preheated skillet, only way to do it. =)

I loved this cornbread! I did cut down on the sugar a bit as suggested. I loved the texture of this cornbread (not crumbly). Be sure not to overcook so it won't be too dry. Thanks for this recipe!

As a brit married into an american family I was determined to learn good ol American cooking. This recipe is great - easy to follow and I have now made several variations: Muffins, muffins with corn and my family favourite, I cut back a little on the sugar and add a cup of grated chedder and some pre grilled bacon pieces to the original recipe and make them into muffins. DEVINE!!!

Definitely the best cornbread I've ever made, or tasted, for that matter. I followed the directions exactly and it was wonderful... I considered using less sugar because of the other reviews, but I liked it just how it was. Great recipe!!

I tried this today and followed the recipe exactly. I would decrease the sugar by half next time. The texture was great and it held together well. I think the bread may have had such a strong after taste because the butter and sugar kind of settle in the bottom of the pan by preheating it. I think next time I will try mixing the ingredients first and then pouring them into the pan. I will grease the pan first with Pam or a small amount of butter.

06/08 update: I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup. I melt the butter in a glass dish and add liquid ingredients. I put the dry ingredients into the wet and mix well. I have used milk with 1 TAB of vinegar when I do not have buttermilk. I have cooked the mixture in a greased cast iron skillet, both preheated and cold. Either way it turned out great. I lvoe this recipe.

This is the first recipe that I've tried and didn't feel the need to tweak it afterwards. I only wish I would have made a second pan to freeze because I know this will be the standard cornbread at my home!

I doubled the batch to take to work. It came out absolutely perfect! I also made some honey-butter to take along (1:1 ratio of honey & butter).  Everyone loved it at work and although I thought I made too much, I came home with an empty container.  I made it again to see how long it would stay moist....if you have a pyrex top 3 days is no problem!

I don't even like corn bread. I made this for my husband and when I tried it I ate two pieces. Super Recipe! Thank you so much!
Let me add this:.... I use a cast iron skillet and I do everything called for in the large skillet then when it is all mixed instead of putting it in another pan I just put the whole skillet in the oven! One pan for the entire operation! LESS MESS!!

Very good recipe.  It is sweet and moist.  I am one that always wanted my honey or syrup on my cornbread, but with this recipe, I haven't always used my extra toppings.  It's also great crumbled as a topping in my chili.

Absolutely without a doubt our new favorite.  Not dry, crumbly or too dense.  Light fluffy with great flavor

Great recipe! I do believe the recipe was a little too sweet, especially once I started eating it with chili. So I'd cut that down to 1/2 a cup of white sugar.

If you want to make it more healthy: I used whole wheat flour, halved the butter and substituted somewhere between 1/4 and 1/3 cup of honey and a little extra milk. I won't say it's as good as the original, but it's still pretty awesome. :)

Seriously great cornbread. I always make my Grandma's recipe and she is the best cook and baker I know. This one called for sugar so I decided to give it a try as a change of pace. I am glad I did. I did cut the sugar to 1/3 cup after reading the other reviews. I have a very large cast iron skillet so I melted the butter in the skillet in the preheated oven, mixed everything else together in a separate bowl and poured it all on top of the melted butter in the hot skillet before baking. The result was a very buttery, slightly crispy edged cornbread that went very well with chili. It is also very good reheated. Thank you for the recipe!

This is a very good and solid recipe.  I won't repeat a lot of what others have said but would like to offer a few suggestions.  View the amount of sugar as negotiable based on your personal tastes; I've made this recipe twice, once with the 2/3 c. sugar (too sweet for me), and once with just 1/4 c. sugar (not enough sweetness), so my personal "sweet spot" is somewhere in between.  An additional 1/2 cup of liquid is a good idea for this recipe if you're so inclined.  And I believe others have mentioned decreasing the amount of flour in respect to the amount of cornmeal which will produce a beautiful yellow color.

Delicious cornbread.  I made mine exactly as the recipe called for. I did add half a can of corn and baked in a preheated, buttered cast iron skillet.  It came out great.  Everyone loved it.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I didn't have buttermilk, and I read a review that I can replace buttermilk with 12 oz. of plain yogurt and reduce the butter to 1/4 cup. But I didn't have plain yogurt so I used vanilla flavored yogurt instead. It turned out very good. The vanilla flavor from the yogurt gave it a nice touch. I will make this again!

This is a wonderful recipe.  I cut the sugar in half because I was serving it with the Simple Turkey Chili recipe (from this website, which is also great).  But, get this, I accidentally doubled the flour and cornmeal! It was pretty dense but tasted great. I cut it up into cubes and used it as a sort of moist crouton for the chili (because there was alot of liquid).  The kids didn't even realize I had messed up. I can't wait to try it again with the correct amounts of flour and cornmeal, it will be unbeatable.

I did not have buttermilk and just added milk.  I also didn't seem to have any white flour, so I used whole wheat.  My husband still really liked it.  He said it tasted like a bread you would get at a really well done health food store.  I am going to get myself some buttermilk and do what other had recommended and add 1/2 wheat and 1/2 white flour.  I am sure he would fall over!
 
Yummy either way!

I have never in all my life made cornbread, but for Thanksgiving with my family, I decided to give it a try.  I settled on this recipe from all the recipes available on this site, and I actually even impressed myself! It came out absolutely perfect!  The only substitution I made was using Splenda instead of sugar, since my dad is diabetic. I made 2 8" square pans, and they both were totally gone by the end of dinner!  Now my dad calls and begs for this fabulous cornbread everytime he visits!  My husband requests it at least once a week too! Thanks for a great recipe!

This is the best cornbread I've ever had (and certainly made) - very moist and tasty! I used just under 1/2 cup of sugar, added 1 Tbsp. of honey, and a dash of nutmeg. Everything else was as written.

When I made this recipe for Thanksgiving, it came out great. Was very moist and everyone loved it. I personally heat up the cast iron pan in the oven while making the batter. After it's ready to go in, I pour it in the hot pan, while gives it nice, crunchy, golden-brown edges. Would definitely make this again

This recipe was a little more work than what I usually put into cornbread, but the taste was worth it. Everyone loved the sweet taste and smooth texture. Next time, I will leave the batter a little more lumpy (I stirred it a bit too much) and I will put something additional into the batter like corn or some peppers for a little added kick. I recommend this recipe.

Its a keeper.  I used half the sugar b/c I was using it for stuffing and still loved the way it came out. I don't ever think that I would use any more that half the sugar.

Amazing!  I used a 24-cup mini muffin pan and baked for about 13 minutes, and also used a small cast iron skillet--same batch of batter--and baked for about 18 minutes.  Excellent flavor, texture, and very easy to make.  Mixing the ingredients in the same pan as the butter is a stroke of genius!

Wow, what a great recipe. It's a lot like Boston Market's cornbread. Crisp on the outside but soft and tender on the inside.

This recipe made 12 regular-size muffins. I baked them at the normal temp for about 20 minutes. (I didn't time them exactly; just took them out when they sprang back to my touch.)

I replaced half the flour with whole-wheat pastry flour, and it was subtle enough that you could fool a picky eater.

I'll be making these a lot. Thanks for a great recipe.

The one and only cornbread recipe you will ever need!  I doubled the ingredients and used a 9 x 13 pan.  It is best served warm when you can really taste the butter.  I serve this with chili.

This was just brilliant. Like other reviewers, I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup, which was perfect for us. I also used half whole wheat flour, half regular. 

This was the best cornbread I've ever had. YUM!

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch, and is it ever addicting!  I made the recipe exactly as it's written (except I substituted 1 c. skim milk + 1 Tbsp. cider vinegar for the buttermilk), and even with an oven that doesn't work well, it came out perfectly.  I'll make this every time I make chili from now on, although next time I'll try it out with less butter (just to be healthier, not because it's greasy).

This cornbread is fabulous, sweet and moist.   I've been making it for a couple of years now, and it is my go-to cornbread recipe.  No tweaks to the recipe needed.  I have an oven-ready skillet, and I mix everything in the one pan and pop it in the oven.

Great recipe.  Used a 8X8 baking pan for 35 minutes and it was awesome.  I didn't have buttermilk so I mixed 1T apple cider vinegar with 1c milk.  Other than that, I followed the recipe to a tee and it was great.  Not too sweet at all.

I didn't have any buttermilk, so I substituted fat free sour cream, plus used slightly less butter. My husband's response was "this is perfect." I completely agree.

Very moist and delicious. I reheated this for several days and it did not fall apart or dry out. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used half butter and half olive oil and it was still delicious.

This is an excellent cornbread - gooey and warm and sweet, like it should be.  I added 2 or 3 Tbsp of orange honey and it added some extra yum.

Ok, I tried making your recipe this weekend, and it went TOTALLY wrong!!! It wasn't your fault nor mines, I mean I followed your instructions word for word, but I figured out what went wrong today, you cannot chage the serving amounts, at least not on baking recipes.  If there is a baking recipe for 9 servings, like yours is, you need to leave it like that, b/c I changed it to 4 servings and it required ridiculous things.  i.e. 7/8 egg!!! what is that...so I'm going to try your recipe again tonight. I'll let you know what the fam says!!

I have tried several cornbreads in the last few months and so far this one is the best. I liked the sweetness of it and so did my oldest son. I will make this again.

Yum!! Rich and delicious. I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup and it was very sweet. I also cut the butter a bit and it was plenty buttery. Watch the oven - mine was fully baked in under 25 minutes. I'll be making this again.

These are great, made exactly as the recipe is written. We served them with lentil soup, but suspect they would be terrific with chili.

Just one suggestion,  I like to mix in a can of diced green chiles to mine- adds some great flavor ( don't worry about spicyness,  my 2 and 4 year old love 'em)

PERFECT!  I didn't change a thing, and these were AMAZING!  Per the suggestion of another reviewer, I used a muffin tin: 20 minutes @ 375.  They will definitely be making a regular appearance for Sunday family breakfasts!!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!

I have to say that this really was a great recipe. It's a very nice moist texture. It was a little sweeter than I would like it to be. My eight year old son on the other hand loved it because he says it reminds him of Jiffy cornbread. I will make this again but I will definitely cut down the sugar content.

Everybody loved this cornbread at home!!! Just be sure to follow the recipe just as it is, because the first time I made it, I forgot to mix the baking soda with the buttermilk, and just added it in with the rest of the dry ingredients, and the cornbread came out a little dry and did not rise evenly. But the second time I baked it I followed the recipe completly, and it came out wonderfully moist and very tasty; not too sweet (I ate it with my ribs and pork n' beans) and not too salty (my dad ate it for dessert with a cup of coffee). It was just right.

Wonderful.  I love to cook, but when it comes to cornbread I normally just grab a mix.  Tonight it is cold and snowing a little, did not want to make a trip to the store just for a mix.  This is a great recipe.  My husband said no more mixes for cornbread.  *Just a suggestion: Add cinnamon and vanilla, maybe a touch more sugar and you have a really awesome sweet cornbread which my oldest son requests sometimes.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have tried many a cornbread recipe and this one is the absolute best. If you like your cornbread sweet and moist, not too mealy nor overly cakey, this is the ONE. Try using blue cornmeal and brown sugar, most excellent...everyone I've shared it with has wanted this recipe.

This cornbread recipe was excellent.  I do recommend checking it at the lesser baking time to achive the best results.  It will dry out quickly if you over cook it.

Excellent recipe. Mixed in bowl - baked in preheated 8" cast iron skillet. Took 35 minutes, but my oven is a bit slow. If you like Jiffy cornbread, this is a winner!

I have made this several times now and has turned out awesome each time!  I mix it all in my cast iron skillet and pop in the oven - cook time is alittle less. Best cornbread I have ever had!

Addition:  If you don't happen to have buttermilk... substitute =  1 tablespoon of lemon juice per 1 cup of milk ...    This is how I make this now since I don't usually have buttermilk on hand...same awesome cornbread!

Let me just say, follow the directions very carefully in this recipie. I also want to add that this is a very interesting way to blend all the ingredients.When the bread is finished it has a shiny, crispy,  sweet, and crunchy top. The center's texture is right and not overly sweet.I will make this w/ Thanksgiving dinner.

BIG HIT!  This cornbread was, in my opinion, the best thing on my table at a recent holiday meal.  And everything turned out great, mind you!  I added an ear's worth of fresh corn off-the-cob.  Some said it was nearly cake-like. The whole thing was devoured in no time.

The is good old-fashioned cornbread, the way I remember it from my childhood. I have grown so accustomed to mixes that I forgot what "real" cornbread tastes like. I used less butter, and used only 1/4 cup sugar. Next time I might add a bit more buttermilk; the finished product was a tiny bit crumbly, probably from using less butter. I made it in a cast iron skillet and it was delicious. Bethany thank you for sharing.

This cornbread was good but a little too sweet for my taste.  I reduced the sugar to half a cup and it still seemed a bit sweet for me. Good recipe if you like a sweet cornbread.

I am a big fan of cornbread and this IS the best one yet.  I made into muffins instead (took 23 minutes) and they were perfect.  They ARE sweet, but I like them that way - more Southern style.  Thanks for submitting this!

I cut back the sugar by half, I cut back on the buttermilk (used about 2/3 c) and added a small can of creamed corn. I heated a dab of shortening in some muffin tins (425F), reduced the heat to 375 and added the cornbread batter. Took about 15 minutes. Tasty!

We varied the baking method a bit by using an x-large cookie scoop (1/4 c. capacity) and muffin top pans.  Baked at 375 for 15 minutes. One batch made 10 circles of cornbread...Yummy!  This morning I threw a couple into the toaster for an added treat.  Very quick and easy to put together.  Makes a dense, slightly sweet cornbread.

I'm just starting to cook and was worried about the outcome.  But I am pleased with this recipe.  It tastes very similar to my mothers.  But I was stranded at home since my car is in the shop so I didn't have buttermilk.  I substituted with 1 cup milk and 1 3/4 tablespoons cream of tartar.  Very tasty, not so moist, and I'm not sure if that's because of the substitution or because I cooked longer than 25 minutes.  If the cook time was a bit less, I think things would have turned out better.

I made this cornbread to go with some sweet baked beans. It was delicious!
Unfortunately it was not a good cornbread to go with dinner. I thought it tasted more like something to have for dessert.
But, I am definitely not disappointed. As I now have a wonderful biscuit recipe for Strawberry Shortcake. I think this cornbread would be the best with fruit and whipped cream. I'm trying that next and I can't wait.
This is a keeper in my dessert box! Thanks Bethany!

Yep, this cornbread is great!  Very moist and held together.  I halved the recipe and baked in an 8x4 loaf pan (reducing the cooking time).  Served this with Easy Corn Chowder from this site!

Nice texture. This is more of a cake-like cornbread and not so much your traditional cornbread. I would definitely cut the sugar in half as other readers did, even 1/4 c. of sugar would be sufficient, especially if you wanted a more traditional cornbread. Still a nice recipe though.

My first decent pan of cornbread!  Used 2 eggs and 1/2 c sugar - rather dense and still sweet, but a little on the bland side.  Will probably use 1 egg and some herbs next time for a "dinner" cornbread, but leave as-is for breakfast.

This recipe is excellent. I have searched for a long time to find a good recipe. And this one wins! Very easy to make.It is moist and sweet. It holds together well. I 1 1/2 the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 pan for 25 minutes. It was thick and moist. Enough for a crowd. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wonderful recipe!!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used whole milk instead.  And, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  This is the best corn bread recipe I've ever tried.  Will definately add to my  recipe box!

I've been looking for a great cornbread recipe for quite a while and this is it!!!  Definitely the best I've tried.  I doubled the recipe and only used 1 cup of sugar.  I also made a second batch where I added 1/3 cup grated cheddar and a small can of diced jalapenos.  Fantastic!

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  This recipe is soooo good!  This is the first time I have ever made cornbread, and it turned out absolutely wonderful!  This is by far the best cornbread I have ever tasted.  This cornbread is sooo moist, it just melts in your mouth.  I took it out of the oven at thirty minutes.  If I could rate this cornbread a ten I would.  Thanks sooo much for the recipe!!!  :o)

Moist and delicious.  Modified recipe based on other reviews - used 3 eggs, doubled the amount of flour, salt, and baking soda.  Added 1 tsp of baking flour and added 1 large can of creamed corn.  Baked in 9 x 13 pan for 30 min.

Served it with chicken tortilla soup at a birthday party for 40. Made 2 double batches. In 1 batch I grated 3 jalapeno peppers, for a bit of zest. Both were a hit with the guests. My new favorite cornbread.

Just made this to go with chili, it is very good.  I didn't have buttermilk so I used half and half(we need fat & calories in this cold!)
It was a little dense, but moist.  And I baked it in a cast iron skillet so it had that nice crust.

I agree with another reviewer, it is kind of dense, also too sweet. I like a strong corn flavor but couldn't really taste that. If I make it again I will cut down on the sugar.

the cornbread came out smelling very good. however, i will only give this a 3 star only because mines came out too dry. 30 minutes in the oven made the cornbread too dry and too hard. will attempt to make it again though.

I now know how to make delicious cornbread thanks to this recipe! The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the sugar was a bit too much for my taste, but after reducing the amount, it was fantastic! Thanks for the great recipe.

Made this recently to go with some chili I was making - it really hit the spot!  Soft but not too crumbly.  I like cornbread somewhat sweet, but I didn't find this overly sugary-tasting.  My husband made honey butter to put on and it was a smashing success!  Thanks for a terrific recipe. :)

I’ve made this recipe many times and everyone loves it. I always use only 1/3 cup sugar as I like my cornbread only mildly sweet. When I don’t have buttermilk, I substitute a cup of milk plus 1 teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar—the buttermilk makes it a bit better but the substitute works pretty well too.

I accidentally put 1 whole cup of butter in!!! OMG!

That being said, I also made some other intentional changes. I added 1 tsp vanilla and I used 1/3 cup light brown sugar. I wanted a sweeter muffin and thought the brown sugar would add a nice flavour. To be honest, they taste great, but obviously are too greasy because of my mistake.

Thank you for this recipe and all the extra tips provided! I made this yesterday and it was fantastic! I made a double batch, cooked it in a 9 x 13 pan and put the other half in the freezer. It was so easy to make and love the ease of mixing it all in 1 pot.

I made this the first time to accompany a turkey and sweet potato chili. It got such rave reviews that not this is how we make cornbread around here. Even when I have to make buttermilk for it, it still turns out great. Wonderful recipe!

Made a GF version of this.  It had really good flavor.  Next time I will add Xantham Gum to try and get the texture right.  Can this be baked directly in the cast iron skillet?

Very easy to make with delicious results! If a 14 year old amateur baker like me can make this, you can too:) I would recommend cutting down the sugar a bit (half a 1/3 or less) and adding 1/2 cup of sweet whole kernel corn. I  also thinly coated the pan with butter to make a nice crust. This cornbread recipe was a huge hit with my family and friends

I made it for dinner with chili today. My family gave it a 10/10.
The kids really liked it. I'll keep this recipe for next time. I always try recipes attributed to somebody's grandma.  They're always good.
I meant to take a photo, but forgot. Nothing but a plate of crumbs now.

I’ve made this several times now and tonight was the best yet. Instead of buttermilk I use one cup milk with two tablespoons distilled white vinegar, let it sit for several minutes. I also use a half cup of sugar instead of two thirds. I use my iron skillet to melt the butter for the mix, then stick the pan in the preheated oven a few minutes before I’m ready to pour the batter so it’s hot (but not smoking).

I used Bob's Red Mill Organic 1-for-1 gluten-free flour with good results. I actually made this directly in a cast-iron skillet, hot on the stove, melted the fat (mixed beef and chicken fat instead of butter), dumped it into the batter, mixed well, then poured right back into the skillet and popped it into a 375 oven. Was done in around 25 minutes and went over very well. Thanks!

Best cornbread I ever had. I accidentally used baking POWDER instead. After making it a couple times I noticed my mistake and made it with SODA. The family likes it better with POWDER. It doesn't puff-up when using  POWDER and seems to be more moist.

I need ten stars for this!  Have been making for a year exactly as written and it is the best recipe for corn bread!  You MUST use buttermilk (freeze the extra in one cup sizes and pop into a zip lock for later then just defrost).  For the 8x8 pan, 30 minutes is just right but check with toothpick as all ovens can vary.  Thank you Bethany and bless your grandmother!
PS, the one pot is genius..just make sure it is big enough.

Nice recipe, I made some as is and added Jalapeño to some. I might add a little more cornmeal next time to get the jiffy texture. These were a little on the cake side. But I will definitely make them again.

This corn bread is delicious. It is sweet but I like it that way. I’ve made it twice in the past week and everyone likes it!  I Mads it in my cast iron skillet the first time and in individual sized loaf pans the second. I think I liked it better in the individual loafs (the recipe made 8). I’m making it one more time tonight for a potluck and plan to do muffins and maybe add a can of corn to the mix because I like pieces of corn in my bread.

No changes, other than doubling the recipe and using a 9x13 pan.  I’ve never reviewed an Allrecipe item before but this recipe is FANTASTIC.  Rave reviews from guests.

This recipe, unaltered,  is the best I have tasted. 
I had company of 60, 70 and 80 yr old when I served it for the 1st time.  All raved about it. 
All three people usually put loads of butter on other cornbread and one always put maple syrup on cornbread.    Amazing to me was that no one put any butter  or syrup on this cornbread.    I read a lot of reviews and decided not to modify the recipe.  I am glad I did...it was perfect. Moist and buttery but not like a cake.  Cooked in a hot iron skillet for 35 minutes---directions say 30-40 minutes.  Was perfect !
 There is a reason this recipe is 5K+ 5 stars.

They only change I made was I put about 3-4 Tbsp. of vegetable oil in my cast iron skillet and heated it in the oven.  I melted my butter in the microwave. The rest of the recipe I followed. 
The cornbread was not overly sweet and was very good. My family and I enjoyed it so I will make this recipe again.

Excellent! We made a buttermilk substitute with whole milk and a tablespoon of cider vinegar, but this recipe came out delicious. We made 12 muffins instead of a bread, wouldn't change a thing.

Make it “Southern style“ by adding only 1/2 the sugar and heating an oiled cast iron skillet in the oven prior to baking. Add butter to top once complete. Super!

I am not a cornbread lover. They are so often dry, crumbly, and sometimes gritty. I've even had ones that stick to the roof of your mouth. I hate that! But this recipe is delicious! I've had it multiple times now, and it's a definite favorite among friends too. Very tasty and moist. It's got great consistency and isn't crumbly, but just the right density. You don't even need to douse it in chili or honey! It's perfect as is.

I made no changes whatsoever. This is a phenomenal recipe! I poured the batter into a greased 8" cast iron pan and baked as directed for 40 minutes. The rise, texture, balance of flavors was outstanding. A real keeper! Thanks, Grandma :-)

Excellent texture - moist, not crumbly. Definitely does not need over 30 min bake time.  Max 25 if the 8x8 is ‘wide’ as in true 8x8 interior space.  Very simple flavor, so goes well with other foods.

This can be baked in the skillet.
When baking in a glass dish cooking at 350 vs 375 is better because it stays more moist

I made this for Thanksgiving and got good reviews. It's a little heavier -- more solid -- than I'm used to cornbread being, but still excellent.

This is going to become a classic on my dinner table. It was savory, but not too sweet. I could taste the exquisite flavor of the corn. I followed the instructions as they were, except that I rubbed some butter on top of the bread before putting it on the table. Thank you for sharing this recipe because I have looked for a good cornbread recipe for a long time. None of the store-bought boxed mixes make the cornbread justice.

This was absolutely delicious!  I took it to a Boy Scout camp out and the SPL (Senior Patrol Leader) said he was not a fan of cornbread.  Not only did he have one piece of corn bread, he had FOUR pieces of cornbread.  

I'm making this recipe again for Thanksgiving.

I found this recipe literally seven years ago and have never even wanted to try making another recipe because this stuff is exactly what you want in cornbread- sweet, moist, entirely delicious! I make it to go with Food Network's Chili Con Carne recipe, and the combo is one of my go-to meals. You can't go wrong!

I cannot say enough good things about this recipe. not too sweet, not too oily or sticky. it's perfect! I used to buy cornbread mix at the store, but moving to different parts of the country, it's hard to find what I consider to be good in all places. thank God for Grandma's Sour Cream Cornbread recipe. I make it as a side dish for black-eyed peas, Chili, Split-Pea soup, Beef Stew, etc. you will not be sorry! As a help, if you don't have buttermilk, add a Tbl of apple cider vinegar or white vinegar to your cup of milk. Enjoy!

We make this cornbread every Saturday morning. I usually implement substitutions found in other reviews. For instance, I usually sour whole milk with vinegar, instead of buttermilk, just because we have the ingredients on hand and are a small family that struggles to use up a whole jug of whole milk before it expires. I also always substitute whole wheat flour for all purpose flour just for fiber and nutrition. Have never received a complaint. On rarer occasions I substitute other natural, lower calorie sweetners for sugar. Regarding process, I just mix everything in my Kitchen Aid mixer and pour it into a greased 8 inch pan. A lot of the 1 star reviews suggest this recipe is too dry. They probably need to start checking for doneness earlier, maybe 25 minutes instead of 30, and check it every 5. Enjoy!

I have made this many times and it’s become my go to.  The recipe creator says not to bake the corn bread in the same pan as you melted the butter but I use a non stick pan that is oven safe and it cuts down on an extra mixing bowl so I’ve baked in the pan every time with fabulous results.  So tasty! Also I many times use gluten free flour in place of all purpose and it still comes out excellently!

I love this recipe!  I started making it while cooking at our county jail.  I added some jalepenos  for fun and it was sure a big hit!  I will be serving it up today with red beans and rice.  They will love it!  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Mine turned out dense. Almost more custard-like than bread-like.

Part of the issue was my dough was too wet. Next time I would add more cornmeal or flour to make it firmer.

The othe probelem was this recipe needs more levening. When I read the recipe it seemed odd how little there was compared to every other cornbread recipe I like. I decided to trust the reviews and made it anyway. Big mistake. 

If I made this again I would add a 1 tsp of baking powder and reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup.

So delicious and not crumbly like other recipes nice used over the years! I substituted lactose free butter and make buttermilk with lactose free milk and 1 tbsp of vinegar. Not the same I know but it works for me. Hubby liked it too! Thanks for the sharing the recipe!

We loved it and I will be making this again!!! The only difference that I did was to cook it in a Crock-Pot. Line with foil and nonstick spray. I cooked on high for 90 minutes then checked and cooked another 15 since it wasn't quite done. It was crunchy for the crust and moist in the middle. Great recipe

Yummy! Just perfect!  The texture was spot on, dense enough so it didn’t fall apart. The sweetness was just right. I made this right in a cast iron pan like another reviewer mentioned and baked it 35 minutes. Served it right in the pan, beautiful presentation.

I’ve made this so often and didn’t rate it. Everyone asks For it and it’s gone in no Time. I use less sugar but my crowd likes it that way. Thanks for a great recipe.

I’ve been making this recipe for a few years now and my family really likes it. I use ingredients as listed. To speed prep time up, I melt the butter in an 8 cup glass measuring cup in the microwave, and then add the rest of the ingredients.  (I use a wee bit of the melted butter to grease the baking pan.)

Doubled recipe and used Splenda for a potluck.

Also used the Instant Pot for the prep.  Melted butter on low Sauté till half melted and cancelled program.  Took inner pot out after the butter finished melting.  Added a little of the buttermilk / baking soda mixture to the butter/sugar mixture to cool it down to avoid cooking the egg.  Worked perfectly, and the eggs blended together fine.  Added the rest of the ingredients in order and the depth of the inner pot handled the doubled recipe perfectly.  Poured it all into the prepared baking dish.  Easy peasy!  Can't wait to try the first bite of the baked cornbread.  The batter was sure tasty!  LOL

Everyone loved it!  Sweet and moist as described.  Baked it in a greased, hot iron skillet to get the extra crunchy bottom and edges - so good!  No more Jiffy for us!  This is too easy and good not to make again!

This recipe is fabulous! My husband loves it...and he is not a fan of cornbread. I always make it when I make my famous pinto beans and ham. This is the only cornbread recipe I've ever made that always gets gobbled up and "don't we have any more?"

Thank you for a perfect recipe. And, p.s., I'm from the south and I love it.

My husband says this is the best cornbread he’s ever eaten, and I agree! It’s that good. Thank you for sharing it, Bethany!

I made it exactly as stated, except I melt the butter in a glass bowl in the microwave and then mix the other ingredients in it. Mainly because it’s just easier for me that way.

For those reviewers that dismiss this cornbread as not being "real" Southern cornbread; you're right!  This is (sweet) cornbread, and bears little resemblance to the very good, but unsweet Southern version.  If that's what you're looking for, this is NOT the recipe for you.  I grew up with sweet cornbread, and this is fantastic!! Moist, sweet, a good crumb......just about perfect.  I even cut a piece for myself and eat it in the morning with a cup of coffee.......it's just delicious!

Amazing!!  We call it cornbread cake. I've made this 3 times in 2 weeks. The first time I made it per the directions, each time since I made one change which was I added a full cup of sugar.  This will be my go to cornbread recipe.

Thank you for this recipe, made it before, and will be making it again tonight with a couple tweaks, cutting the sugar in half, and adding some actual corn. I prefer a recipe with butter, instead of oil, and the extra egg ensures this bread will be nice and moist, unless they don't read the instructions and cook it for that 40 minutes lol

And a tip for those I see in their photos have overdone the bottoms of the cornbread, use a cast iron or other heavy bottomed pan, or, at the same time you are putting the pan in (not before then, you want it room temp), put a cookie sheet in under the pan. It'll make it take longer for the pan to heat up, preventing the bottom from cooking faster than the rest of the bread.

Works with gluten-free flour! I've made this several times, with changes based on the ingredients I had. It seems to work  no matter what I do to it. Some of my family can't eat gluten, so I've always used gf flour. I've used Bob's 1 to 1, and a mix I made myself with corn starch, millet, and sorghum. Both work. I grew up eating unsweetened cornbread, so I have tried this recipe with different amounts of sugar. I've come to the conclusion that you can just sweeten it to taste. I've used the full amount, half, a quarter, and an eighth. They all work. I've used granulated sugar, light brown sugar, and dark brown sugar. No problems with any of those. I've also used regular milk and buttermilk. Obviously, the taste changes based on what changes you make to the recipe, but nothing I've tried has turned out bad. It's a reliable, flexible recipe.

Love it. this is my go to cornbread recipe from now on. if you like it a little sweeter as a couple tablespoons of honey right into the batter. I like to bake in a muffin tin at 400 for 15 minutes. they come out perfect.

This was so good that there was nothing leftover and I got requests to make it the following day.  I did add some leftover corn kernels to it.  Otherwise I followed it exactly and baked it in the cast iron skillet I had melted the butter in.

Okay, two things: first off, the kitchen was busy and I forgot the sugar so I mixed it in at the end.  It seems fine but I will see if doing it the correct way changes anything the next time, and there will be a next time.  Also, I made this as part of another recipe.  In an 8 inch pan, I placed a small batch of chili, 8 ounces of shredded cheddar and the cornbread on top and baked it in a 375 oven till it was golden brown.  Brought a whole new dimension to the cornbread.  Thanks!

Prerfect.  Best I’ve had.  Only thing that I did differently was that I baked it in a preheated cast iron pan.

Didn’t have buttermilk so I Used 1/2 milk and 1/2 heavy cream added apple cider vinegar .
Whipped the eggs to form peaks then folded in.
Cut the sugar a bit since don’t like  my cornbread too sweet. This is an awesome recipe!!! A big hit with everyone!! Thanks a million!!!

I used 1/2 cup sugar and it was still too sweet - next time I will be reducing that further, probably to 1/4 cup. It tastes good, but almost like cake. If you have a very strong sweet tooth you'll enjoy it, but for me, even though I'm not from the South,  it was like a dessert.

Followed the recipe to a "T", except we used an 8 inch cast iron skillet to bake.  We have been making various cornbread recipes for more than 30 years.  THIS RECIPE IS THE BEST WE HAVE EVER HAD...BAR NONE.  If you like cornbread you will be missing a great tasting cornbread  opportunity unless you try this recipe.

This was AWESOME!  Reminds me of my mothers Johnny Cake.  I live in the south but grew up in Maine and do not care for the dry/crumbly cornbread around here.  It is great as is, but I think next time I will cut the sugar back some so we can eat it how we are use to...which is drizzled with or dipped into molasses. Cooking time for me was 24 minutes...all ovens are different , altitudes very, and all pans are different.  Cooking in a cast iron skillet, dark metal pan, light metal pan, glass pan, ceramic/pottery pan etc all require different cooking times. For newer bakers, with any  first time baking of a new recipe ...set your timer for much less time than the recipe requires and check.

Oh my goodness, this recipe is amazing! There's a great instant pot chili recipe I use, and I love to serve this with it. Absolutely perfect for guests or any time it's cold and you have that chili and cornbread craving.

Wow! Buttermilk is the “secret” ingredient! We like cornbread a little less sweet so only used half a cup versus 2/3 and boy was it delicious!

This recipe is great on it’s own! Make adjustments to your preference and kind of flour you’re using, but using this recipe as a guide is wonderful. I added jalapeños and cheddar and it’s just as good :)

Ya’ll this is so good.. I don’t change a thing about what goes into this recipe (except for the use of a milk and vinegar “buttermilk”). I’ve tweaked the instructions a little bit after some experience making it (not that I had issues before) just to make it a little easier to work with. As for the dryness some have experienced, bake it for 30 minutes and check it from there. I’ve never had a dry bread. I LOVE the sweetness. Maybe it’s because I’m from the middle of Illinois, but this is not a southern version by any stretch and I’m 100% alright with that. This immediately became my favorite cornbread recipe ever and it is the only one I ever use. Thanks to it, my husband will eat cornbread again and my kids it eat, period. Can’t ask for more than that!

Turned out GREAT!  A little dense. Reduced sugar by choice to 1/2 cup. Would have been good with even 1/4-1/3 C. Depending on your preference. Will use it again for sure.

This is the cornbread recipe I have been searching for!  So easy and delicious!  I skip the skillet part with the butter and sugar and just mix  the ingredients in a mixing bowl in the order listed. (no pre-mixing of anything).  I have made this at least a dozen times and have decided to increase the amount of buttermilk just slightly for an even more moist outcome.

This cornbread is amazing! I don't like sweet cornbread so I used 1/5 cup of sugar. I also didn't have any buttermilk so I used 1 cup of milk with about 1 or 2 tablespoons of vinegar added to make sour milk. I cooked the batter in a preheated cast iron skillet that I had melted butter and a bit of bacon fat into while the oven preheated. It cooked in 30 minutes exactly and came out beautifully golden brown. The bread is fluffy and light, yet substantial. This will definitely be my go-to cornbread recipe, and I can see myself adding corn and green onions to it in the future.

I made this vegan by using Earth Balance plant based butter, a powdered egg replacer (made of potato starch and mixed with water), and I added 2 tablespoons of white vinegar to 1 cup of almond milk to substitute the buttermilk. I accidentally used a 9x9 pan instead of an 8x8 and should have taken it out of the oven a couple of minutes earlier, but it still turned out really good - cakey, sweet, and buttery. Yum!

I made this recipe but decided I didn’t want to use 2 dishes so instead I doubled the recipe and made it all in the pan I melted the butter with. It was a giant ant but boy did it turn out beautiful.  It was the first time I ever got cornbread to turn out for me. This will be on the must make again list.

Followed recipe as is only flaw was the middle wasn't done enough even though the toothpick came out clean, it was my fault I was afraid to over bake. The edges were absolutely yummy, even the in-laws liked it and asked for a second piece. Next time I will bake for just over 30 mins and expect perfect results!

I added just a splash of vanilla extract to it and used soured milk instead of buttermilk but when I soured the milk with apple cider vinegar. The best thing on earth!!!

Very good recipe.  The whole family was impressed.  I substituting honey for some of the sugar, and made it in a cast iron wedge pan for cornbread.

And don't worry about the detractors , it is still good cornbread.

I followed the recipe, but found this cornbread to be too sweet for my taste. I think I would try 1/3 cup of sugar next time instead of 2/3 cup. UPDATE: I tried it with only ¼ cup of sugar and still found it too sweet for me. I'm now in the no-sugar camp, and have been trying other variations (and recipes). But thanks, Bethany, for getting me started!

Delicious! This cornbread was a hit with my family. It has the perfect amount of sweetness, great texture, and a beautiful crust. I didn’t have buttermilk on hand so I added one Tablespoon of white vinegar to a cup of whole milk and made my own. Also, I used a cast iron skillet with a scant quarter cup of melted bacon grease swirled around inside it (and I had it screaming hot from melting the grease in the skillet in the oven) before I added the cornbread batter. That makes a wonderful crust on the bread. I will definitely use this recipe again.

I baked this in a 13" X 13" baking pan and baked at 180°C for about 25 mins. Came out perfectly cooked, slightly dense but still crumby, and the taste is spot on how I remember this soul food should taste like!

This is delicious cornbread and was a favourite at our bbq. I doubled the recipe and it was not dry at all. It is a little sweet but not overly. I melted the butter and mixed all the ingredients in a stainless saucepan, and while doing that I let my cast iron pan warm up in the oven (melting a tbsp of butter to grease the pan). I poured the mixture into the hot cast iron pan and it cooked in around 32 minutes with a nice crisp buttery crust. I will be making this again.

You can adjust the sweetness as you like.

I love this recipe and the only thing I did to adjust it to my taste was. I added 1/2 cup of peaches & cream corn kernels and 1/2 a cup of shredded cheddar cheeses. I cook it in the cast iron skillet I melted the butter in. My family loves it. I also don’t use white sugar so I submitted that with brown sugar. Turns out perfect every time.

Made the original and a GF version to go with chilli tonight at TGIF, both turned out looking perfect.  I’ll have to reserve comments on the flavour until after dinner. The round is GF.

Overall, very good. The texture was perfect -
tender and flaky. I used a 8" cast iron skillet and it did stick on the bottom. I followed the instructions as written. I will make this again with a little less sugar as it was too sweet for our taste.

I made this following the directions and not adding anything else. I did bake it in a cast iron skillet, because that’s what we do ?? This was so good! It’s cake like and a bit sweet. Not like our usual (Texas) cornbread, but I will be making this again!

Awesome recipe as given. Loved it. I made it in an 8x8 pan and it turned out great.  I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own sour milk with just a tad shy of 1c milk and 1Tbl white vinegar.  The  mix turned out easy to do. I f ollowed the author's directions and just made it in the bowl i melted the butter in. Poured it into an 8x8 pan. 

Yes it's sweet. It's supposed to be that's the recipe. If you don't want it as sweet cut back the sugar. As it is it worked out great with a super spicy chili I made. The sweet cornbread cut the heat and it was absolutely delicious. 

HIghly recommend this recipe: Note:I did only bake for 25 minutes. It was done by then and was perfect.

We need to be gluten-free so I used King Arthur measure-to-measure in place of wheat flour. I followed others and mixed it all up in my cast iron skillet and then popped it in the oven. Absolutely delicious! The only change I will make the next time is to add a little more buttermilk. It was slightly dry, but I think that is a function of the gluten-free flour. Cooking in the skillet made it nice and crispy on the outside and only one pan to clean!

I made this twice this weekend.  First time I made it Saturday exactly like the recipe and it was very good although a tad sweet for our taste but still amazing.  My hubby polished it off and asked me to make it again on Sunday to bring to friend's house for dinner. I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and cooked it for 20 mins, I think my oven cooks a little hot.   This recipe is a keeper.  My hubby said please make this again any time.

I like trying recipes as-written first before I make any changes, and I won't be making any changes to this one.  Even 2nd and 3rd day leftovers were moist, and the only reason we had any left by day 3 was because I made 4 batches of it at once.  Glad I did!  It has a nice balance between sweet (for using more as a treat when served with honey butter etc), and not-too-sweet (with chili or bbq, etc).  In my opinion, this is the perfect cornbread, and I'll be definitely using it often.

This made up with the right touch of moist and crumbly. I couldn't see myself adding all of that sugar, so I added 1/2 cup. This one is a keeper.

I made this for super bowl Sunday along with some homemade chili. Everyone loved this cornbread. I followed the recipe for the most part the only thing I did differently was I did add 2/3 cup frozen sweet corn and I cooked the bread in a preheated 8” cast iron skillet in the oven. The bread nice was and light brown on the outside and very moist in the middle. My daughter in-law loves it and asked for the recipe.

I made the cornbread as a side to go with chili. The bread was good but too sweet. Next time I will cut the sugar in half.

I’ve made this cornbread at least a dozen times and always get asked for the recipe!  My boyfriend who typically doesn’t like cornbread absolutely loves this. It’s more moist and slightly more cakey than your typical old grainy dry cornbread which makes it a real winner. I always stick to the recipe exactly as it’s written. The only thing I’ve thought about trying is adding either bacon or corn kernels just to switch it up, so if I try that, I’ll update my review to let you know how it goes.

I tripled this recipe due to a large family gathering, and baked in loaf pans vs the square 8x8 pan. Everyone loved it with their chili. I mixed dry and wet ingredients separately and then combined. I also added a bit of baking powder and vanilla extract.  Next time I think I am going to make it with cheese and jalapeño. Truly delicious cornbread.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I think the buttermilk really kicked it up a notch.

Recipe is delicious as is! Quite balanced in flavour. Absolutely best made in a cast iron skillet,  though have made in muffin cups when necessary. Cut muffins into cubes & leave out to dry for up to 2 days for an incredible corn-bread stuffing. (Place all butter in skillet, heat in oven while prepping bread, mix all dry ingredients with fork, drizzle melted butter on dry ingredients,  mix thoroughly with fork, then add wet ingredients.)

For a sweeter bread, add 2 - 3 more TBS sugar.

For a delicious variation, add 1/2-1 can no-salt-added sweet corn (drained) or 1/2 -1 can cream corn to taste.

Constructed different from any cornbread I've made to date. The result is a finer crumb than my usual rustic cornbread. Sweet and moist. Very sweet! As a matter of fact. I could reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup without changing the batter too much.

Used half the sugar and sub'd almond milk. Baked in 6 mini cake pans which was perfect for the amount in recipe. Turned out moist and just a tad sweet.

I found this recipe to be way too sweet.  About half or less of the amount of sugar is all that is needed. It was almost like a cake instead of cornbread .  I will make it again because it is light and fluffy but with way less sugar!

I now live in New Zealand and only used 1/3 of the called-for sugar and it was still even sweet for the savoury palates of kiwis (and now, me).  It was perfect this way for my family, guests and I.  Best of all, no drying out!  Reheated in the oven/toaster (I know!) and it crunched on the outer, moist on the inner, didn't need butter!
I sprinkled cornmeal in the baking pan, and also topped the uncooked mixture with a bit of sugar and then salt to give it a sweet/savoury taste.  Perfect thank you!

Missed a step for the newbies mate. Soak your polenta/cornmeal flour if you want a less gritty texture. Half the sugar too! Supplement extra virg olive oil instead of all that butter for a light flavour. Small tin of corn kernels added was beautiful. Chilli flakes would have been spectacular.

I made it...used 1/2 cup sugar...still sweet enough.  I preheated a greased iron skillet and baked it in that.  I used coconut oil to grease the pan.  Love it!!

Excellent cornbread. I used 1/2 of the leftover cornbread in my dressing for Christmas-it was also the best I’ve ever made or tasted.

I almost melted all the butter in an 8" skillet in the oven. I poured the butter into a mixing bowl just before it finished melting (so I didn't burn it). I put the skillet straight back in the oven then added the other ingredients to the butter in the mixing bowl. I mixed the buttermilk and the baking soda in a measuring jug before pouring it into the mixing bowl. By the time the mixture was ready, the skillet was hot. The mixture is quite thick so needed leveling. It was perfectly cooked in 30 minutes.

My husband liked it.  He prefers less sugar in his cornbread so I used only half the recipe’s amount.   Texture was fine, the cornbread was nice and moist, and there were no leftovers!

Excellent and super easy. Made half batch into four big bundt muffins, stuffed with pulled pork. Baked 20 min. They were perfect for Christmas brunch!  I’ve tried so many cornbread recipes and this is by far the best for moisture and taste.

I followed the instructions and the only thing i did differently was substitute the sugar for equal sweetener. I was slightly disappointed because i made this cornbread to have with homemade chicken noodle soup which was delicious by the way. I should have had a back up like jiffy or store bought cornbread because i had nothing else to go with the soup not even crackers. I still enjoyed the soup by itself but it's not the same without cornbread. I would not recommend this recipe to anyone because in my opinion it is misleading. I do not want to make it again either unless it's used for cornbread dressing. It's dense texture and bland flavor or lack of flavor will make a perfect base for cornbread dressing. I give this recipe an extra star because it wasn't dry and it was surprisingly moist and had a picture perfect golden look  which was deceiving after i took the first bite i was like wtf!

Outstanding! I'm not a big fan of sweet cornbread, so I added only 2 tablespoons of sugar.  I'm also of the "add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients" school of thought.  It turned out wonderfully!

I was very hesitant with making this recipe since most of my friends/family doesn’t like cornbread. I ended up making it for a Friendsgiving and it turned out to be a huge hit! I will be making this again in the future, for sure!

So easy to make, and not too sweet. I used slightly less sugar, and add some frozen corn kernels. Made as muffins but need to reduce bake time by 5-7 minutes. Yum!

Excellent! I made it exactly as the recipe read.  It’s moist and has just the right amount of sweetness.  It’s definitely “a do again” for our household.

This was easy to make and came out perfectly. I made it the night before Thanksgiving, cooled it completed and stored it in a concealed container at room temperature. Heated it for 20 minutes prior to serving - it was still moist.

I used a roasted corn meal such as  Brinsers and added two teaspoons of baking powder and one tablespoon of lemon juice to activate the baking soda. I realize this is not true southern cornbread but it is good! You might call this cornbread cake.

Finally! We found a cornbread recipe that we actually like. In our house, we like sweet cornbread. This was the perfect combination of not too dense and not too dry. I only baked it for 30 minutes in a glass 8x8. Otherwise, made the recipe exactly as written. Adding to my pile of recipes.

It turned out amazing! I followed the recipe exactly, but just doubled up on everything because I needed to make a larger batch for cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving. Definitely making this again!

Best cornbread I have ever made.  Used white corn meal, not the self rising kind.  Cut the sugar in half.  Was done in 25 minutes in the glass baking dish.  Moist and delicious!

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a pre-headed cast iron skillet (10" with high sides) - it baked up perfectly, moist and sweet and perfect. It held up nicely even when cool (it didn't crumble excessively). I would absolutely make this again, and recommend it. Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! So moist! I used 1/2 cup sugar and it was perfect! I did double the recipe and took me 45 to 50 minutes to bake in a 11 x 9 half size foil tray. I am definitely making this for parties and special events!

Followed the directions exactly except I cooked it in a cast iron skillet. I put the skillet into the oven to heat up to temperature before adding the batter and baking. Cooked 30 min and it came out perfect. I prefer more of a southern style cornbread without sugar and a more pronounced buttermilk flavor. I think this would be perfect for most people though. My husband loved it.

Wonderful recipe! Wouldn't change a thing. Baked it in a pre-heated cast iron frying pan for 30 minutes and it came out slightly crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. In between bites, my husband managed to say, "It's a keeper."

I made this to go with the "best  chili" recipe.  It was REALLY good. The two made a great pair.

I made it as written and wouldn't make any changes in the future.

So good, followed the recipe exactly and it turned out so good. Perfect amount of sweetness and moistness. I thought i messed it up because my eggs scrambled just a little bit but it ended up being fine. I only used one pan for the mixing which made it way easier.

These came out great.  I baked it for 30 minutes and it was done perfectly.  I did not change any ingredients in the recipe.  I used a glass mixing bowl and melted the butter in the microwave, and then mixed the rest of the ingredients into that same bowl in the order of the recipe.

These are also good if you add 1/2 to 1 jalapeno, diced.

I used a 9x13 1/2 because I love the crust and wanted a thinner cornbread.  Mine was still a little less than an inch.  By mistake, I used 1 tsp baking soda instead of 1/2 tsp and it was still great.

Made per recipe in a cast iron skillet.  My guests loved it as did my family.  Now that I know how easy it is I’ll play around with some of the recommendations of others.  I did make my own butter milk using apple cider and milk.

The texture of this recipe was fantastic!  I made it as directed.  It had a cake like texture and crumb.  I will make it again but I may adjust the ratio of AP flour to cornmeal and go heavier on the cornmeal.  I wanted to taste more corn.

I had some extra buttermilk and was looking for a use for it and stumbled on this recipe. I had had been looking for a good sweet cornbread recipe for awhile , so I gave it a try. It came out great and just what I was looking for. I'll be making this for years to come. Thanks for sharing.

This is my go to corn bread recipe. No changes needed, but, depending on what I’m serving it with, I may cut back the sugar. Adding jalapeños to a batch today. Easy prep and great results every time.

I got so many compliments on this cornbread! Most of the people said, "most cornbread is very dry and crumbly, but this isn't! I added 1/4 cup minced jalapenos, and 3/4 cup of cheddar cheese. It's a nice twist on the traditional!

It's delicious! I came across this recipe a few years ago and it's my family's favorite! I have to make a double batch because the kids always want it for a late night snack and/or breakfast.

We’ve made this with sugar and with Splenda blend, with eggs and with egg substitute.  The cornbread turns out amazingly wonderful in every instance!

I used this recipe - without having tried it - to make nine pans of cornbread for my church’s chili cook-off. I cannot tell you what a HUGE hit it was. Everyone was asking who brought the cornbread, and I finally had to post the recipe. It is moist and sweet, without  the bitterness  you often get with a mix. It rises a lot while it bakes so I got 16  2X2 pieces out of each pan. I highly recommend this recipe! I used white flour and baked it for 30 minutes, but note the author’s suggestion of using whole wheat flour and cooking for closer to 40 minutes if you want to reduce the sweetness.  Thank you, Bethany!

This cornbread turned out to be soft, moist and yummy despite using brown sugar and reducing the baking soda to quarter teaspoon. This recipe is a keeper!

This is absolutely the best cornbread on the planet! Made it for the 4th time yesterday. On the 1st try, & again yesterday, I put the baking soda in with the flour mixture instead of mixing it in with the buttermilk as per directions (my error). This didn't make a difference as far as taste goes When done correctly, it sort of reacts w/the buttermilk, & I think it may help with making the batter rise a bit.
I don't own an 8" square pan (or an iron skillet either). Made it in a 9" square non-stick pan, & that worked very well.
Sometimes there were add-ins before baking. My guys like jalapeno peppers sliced up, seeds & all. Used a good sized pepper, & don't ever forget the cheddar cheese......used 2/3 cup of the shredded stuff from the store. Chopped that up in the mini  chopper to make the shreds a bit shorter.
Fried bacon also goes in with the jalapenos as well. Usually make 4-6 thick slices, then crumble it in with the rest of the add ins.
Fear not.....this cornbread is great even w/o add-ins! A keeper in this family for sure!

The three years I was dating my husband, I would make him cornbread from Jiffy Mix and tell him it was homemade. Well for the first time since our wedding and moving in together, he decided he wanted some of “my” cornbread. I refused to admit what I made in the last wasn’t actually homemade so I used this recipe. He said it was the best i have ever made! Whew! My secret is safe!

very sweet with the right amount of moistness.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I substituted 1/2 sour cream mixed with 1/2 milk and it was wonderful.  Thank you for the recipe.

I needed a cornbread recipe I could whip up quickly. This recipe caught my eye. It was good but I didn't cook long enough 30 mins. and came out a little gooey in the middle. Probly needed 5 more mins in oven but otherwise good flavor and. I will make this again and give it more time in the oven next time.

The batter recipe is just perfect.
I don't know about the mixing instructions because I tend to combine my dry and wet ingredients separately and then combine them.
I don't know about the bake time because I pour the batter into a cast iron skillet that has been preheated in the oven with some butter in it, and I use a convection toaster oven, so my bake time is significantly shorter.

I made this exactly as the recipe is written, it was so yummy!!!  I made a honey butter to put on top of it, it was delicious!  I made 1.5x the recipe to make a bigger pan of cornbread, it went really well with some homemade chili!

I used a slightly larger pan and baked it 25 min. We didn’t have buttermilk so we subbed regular milk with lemon juice (sit for 5 min before use). Came out perfect, we had it with chili.

I substituted 1/3 cup honey for the 2/3 cup sugar and used jumbo eggs. It still was sweet enough for us and my wife liked it being a little more cake like.

I would give this recipe a 6 out of 5 stars if I could . Just the perfect consistency, texture and sweetness.
Definitely recommended!
The only change I made was using honey instead of white sugar.

It was really good and I only used 1/2 of the sugar that it requested.  I will definitely keep this recipe.  I wanted to try something different.  I make my own, but I don't measure anything.

This is the only cornbread recipe you will ever need, it's that perfect!  I follow the recipe, but make a couple of small alterations in technique.  One, I mix the buttermilk and baking soda together in a measuring cup before I start doing anything else.  The time that it sits allows it to foam up, and it makes the cornbread so fluffy it comes all the way up to the top of the pan as it bakes!  Also, after I butter my pan, I put it in the preheating oven while I'm mixing up the batter.  I always like to pour cornbread batter into a hot pan, gives a nice crust.  Stop looking for a cornbread recipe, this is it!

This turned out great! I didn’t have any buttermilk so I mixed 1 tablespoon of white vinegar into the 1 cup of milk and let it sit for 10 minutes. I baked in a round cast iron skillet, also because that’s what I had on hand. Other than that I followed the recipe directions. The cornbread turned out perfect! Will definitely make again

Being a Southerner I never dreamed I would like sweet cornbread. This was almost like eating corn cake, if there is such a thing. I questioned the amount of sugar and a couple other measurements in this recipe, but I followed it to a T! I LOVED IT! I served it with Great Northern Bean Soup, Beet & Sweet Onion relish, and fresh spring/green onions!

Came out perfectly.

I added a can of hatch green chilies to kick it p a notch. Baked it in a pyrex bread pan. I was told to try a cast iron skillet which will be in my next bake.

I would have taken a picture of this gorgeous golden bread, but it was gone before I had the chance! Made a double batch to serve with ribs. It was delish plain, with butter, or with honey butter. I subbed vinegar and milk for buttermilk, as I didn’t want to run to the store. I also made sure to beat every ingredient in, as I dislike gritty, lumpy cornbread. It was super smooth... not too sweet... not too moist. Pretty dang perfect! Thank you Allrecipes!

My family loves this and guests request it. It IS like a cake, don’t skip the honey! If you’re looking for a good cornbread recipe Grandmkther’s Buttermilk cornbread (on this site) is perfect, but this is better for those times you’re serving more people and want something sweeter.

It came out great. Just pay close attention at the end of the baking time. I checked on it at 25 minutes and it was still sticky and at 32 minutes it was already deep brown on top. Didn't burn it, but I'd check every 2-3 minutes once you get past 25 minutes.

My go-to cornbread recipe. I cut the butter to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup plain Greek yogurt. Reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup and fold in half a can of creamed corn (about 7 oz.) before pouring into the baking dish. It comes out super moist and flavorful.

I used medium grain cornmeal which gave good texture and a little less sugar than stated.  At 35 minutes, I checked the center and it was not quite done.  It was perfect at 40 minutes.  I was craving for a sweet cornbread as its great to eat with hot coffee.  However, I will try this again without the sugar.

Definitely a northern cornbread.  Although I'm originally from the north, I prefer a much less sweet southern cornbread.

This was really good. I did cut the sugar a bit but will add the full amount next time. I also will add more salt because I like it to be salty too. I baked mine in a cast iron skillet with melted lard-nothing beats the crunch you get from making it that way

I have been making this recipe for at least 8 years. Every time I make it it comes out fabulous. My family likes it a little sweeter so I'll use a cup of sugar and the first time I made it I accidentally used twice the amount of butter! It was so good, was like a dessert! So this is the way I've been making it ever since. I also mix everything in the pan I melt the butter in then pour in my baking pan to cook. Consistent every time!  Delish!

I’ve never made cornbread before. It seems to have its roots in the U.S., but not where I live. I had a feeling it be a perfect accompaniment to some stew I was making. Having said that, I found this recipe was quick, delicious, and easy. Instead of white sugar, I sweetened with 1/2 cup raw honey. Also, didn’t want to buy a whole carton of buttermilk so I just watered down some Greek yoghurt. Even with these subs the bread was moist with a nice cakey texture. I will make this again.

I don’t usually have buttermilk around so I mix 1 cup milk and 1 1/2 tbs white vinegar to sour it.  Then I added 2 tbs thick sour cream (Gaylea Gold),  and 1 1/2 tbs honey.

Sometimes, if I want a bit denser less crumbly cornbread I add an extra egg.  

Even without my modifications, this is the best!

I made this and it came out wonderful.  Moist and just sweet enough.  For those that made it and got scrambled eggs - melt the butter and let it cool for 3 minutes, transfer to a large bowl and mix all ingredients in the bowl and then pour in pan to bake.  If you get scrambled eggs, the butter is too hot and if you mix it in the same pan you have additional heat from the pan.

Only substitution was almond milk. Stuck to the other ingredients as well as directions, so not sure what happened. Flavor was ok, the texture and look were very strange as if i had mixed in olive oil. Also the bottom was sort of caved in, not sure how to best explain it but im considering this try, a fail. Maybe it was my eggs or baking soda. Because of the rating and reviews willing to try again but for now will stick to my recipe for cornbread.

Very good texture and stuck together well.  I used the milk/vinegar trick to make the buttermilk and that worked great.  very tasty :}  I grew up on Southern style cornbread (coarser and not sweet) but this is a real tasty treat of a different nature :D  Thanks for sharing!!  :D

I made this recipe exactly as it says.  It came out perfectly.  We took it to our friends' home to have with the white chili that they made.  It was delish!  They texture was light and densish at the same time.  It was a little to the sweet side which we all loved.  I have saved this recipe and will always use it when I need cornbread.   Thank you for this foolproof recipe!  PS~ I live at 7300 feet in the mountains and was worried it might not turn out well.  Very pleasantly surprised!

Great recipe! I usually make twice the amount recommended to make the pieces bigger. If you do the same, then bake it for about an hour (that's how I do it before it's dry inside).

I've made this several times now, and here's what I've adjusted.  I found that it really could use more leavening....a half of teaspoon of soda for whole pan of cornbread?  I also add 2 tsp. of baking powder.  I do like to use whole wheat pastry flour and I prefer the coarse ground cornmeal--it makes for a heartier cornbread.  Thanks for the recipe, Bethany!

This is my new go-to cornbread recipe I've made it probably 10 times one little thing I do different I Heat a cast iron skillet on the eye of my stove with just a touch of melted butter while I mix the cornbread when the pan is good and hot and the butter is starting to sizzle I pour the mix into the pan and leave it on the stove about 3 to 5 minutes until it starts to make bubbles like a pancake that gives it a very very crisp outer layer it is delicious

SInce I'm not southern, I was more than happy to add all of the ingredients listed in the recipe.  I baked muffins - 300 convection for 20 minutes.  Perfect!  I used muffin liners and the recipe yielded 17 servings of deliciousness.

If you like sweet cornbread, you'll love this recipe! I actually substitute the buttermilk for Instant Pot yogurt (which I do anytime I need buttermilk or sour cream). If you like the taste of honey, using half sugar/half honey is a great switch too. But even just as written, you'll get a fantastic cornbread!!

this recipe was PERFECT. I mixed everything in a mixing bowl and then poured in a cast iron pan, and also made my own buttermilk (2 tbs white vinegar and then add milk to equal 1 cup) but otherwise - absolutely

absolutely the best I've ever had.  For me there is no real substitute for buttermilk.  Just like 'butter', everything is better with buttermilk!  Super moist and tender.

Best homemade cornbread recipe I have tried. Perfectly sweet and moist, gets a little bit crisp around the edges. Delicious! I baked mine for 29 minutes and followed the recipe exactly. I will use this for my go-to corn bread recipe.

Works for mini muffins! I used this for the small mini muffin trays and baked them for 10 - 11 minutes at 400 degrees. Made a double batch and split it because I wanted to add some jalapeños and corn to some of them. Worked out perfectly and both the plain and spicy were delicious! Followed the recipe exactly except on the spicy batch I added 1/4 cup diced canned jalapeños, 1/4 cup canned white corn and 1/2 cup shredded pepper jack cheese. I thought they were going to be too sweet after I tasted the batter but once they were baked, all the flavors melded nicely and for me it was just the right amount of sweetness.

Excellent recipe!  Have made several times & it’s always a hit.  We prefer less sugar, so use 1/3c.  I double the recipe, cook in a cast-iron skillet, & freeze some for later.  Thank you for such a simple & tasty recipe!

This was amazing! Crispy crust and moist on the inside. Topped with some honey butter and this was dangerous to keep around unless you have people to share it with. I made it gluten free as well by using a one for one flour subsitute. I usually like Pamela’s baking mix for my GF flour but Bobs Red Mill one for one is also a good choice. They both turned out delicious in this recipe. Definitely give this one a try!

This is a wonderful recipe! Every time I share it I get raves and requests for the recipe.  I sub coconut oil for the butter (yes, you can taste it and it’s delicious!) and white whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour.  The buttermilk makes this so moist!  I have even made it with half of the sugar and a little Stevia, and you can’t tell the difference.  Just don’t leave out the buttermilk!

Made it as written the first time.   Was very good.  It's light and fluffy.  Made it with a little more corn meal and less flour the secon time for a more dense cake.  Reviews were mixed on the second iteration.  I'll keep tweaking to get to something I can call my own, but the original is a winner as written.  And I may never win the family over now that they've had it.

I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. And I think that this cornbread is still delightfully sweet. (I am not for a overly sweet, dessert-like cornbread).
Made them into muffins to accompany pork ribs and green beans for dinner.

I didn't have butter. Used 1/4 cup of vegetable oil and 3 tbsp margarine. Didn't have cornmeal so used corn flour. Also added 1 tbsp baking powder. Came out nice and light. Yummmm.

A better way to make this recipe. I found the directions confusing, so went back to a more standard, easier way. 
1. Melt the butter in a  9 or 10 inch oven proof skillet (I use Circulon). 2. Combine the dry ingredients. 3. Beat the eggs into the buttermilk and combine with the dry ingredients. 4. Add melted butter to the batter and mix well. 5. Brush remaining butter around the skillet until all sides are coated and pour the batter into the skillet. 6. Bake for 30 minutes. 
Optional changes. We use gluten free all purpose flour and 1/2 cup sugar. So far nobody has been able to tell that it is gluten free. Everybody loves this cornbread.!

This is excellent but I would never use this much sugar.  I think I used about 1/4 cup and that was plenty for our taste.  For the flour I used home-ground Prairie Gold flour.  Gave it some extra texture.  Yummy.

I'm a southerner and I like sweet cornbread.  My mother made cornbread both sweet and savory and she was born and raised in AL.  This recipe is similar to hers.  BUT she would have always poured her batter into a hot oiled skillet.  Still liked the recipe and I will use it again.  Thank you for posting.

My wife requires a gluten free diet.
I made this using gluten free corn meal and gluten free all purpose flour.

She loved it.  Had to make again.  Will need to purchase more buttermilk to make more

The only change I made to this recipe was reducing the sugar from 2/3 cup to 1/3 cup, and everyone raved about it; perfect served alongside a spicy vegetarian chili

Really good.  It does taste a lot like Jiffy.  I cooked it in a preheated iron skillet for 25 minutes.

The only substitution was using apple cider vinegar in milk in stead of actual buttermilk. (1 cup of milk in the recipe take out one tablespoon of milk and replace it with one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar).

This cornbread was soooo good! My boyfriend LOVED it he even took it to work to share with the guys & they LOVED it! I didn't change anything about it and used one pan to melt and cook everything. I will never use another cornbread recipe!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe called for. Don't know if I over baked it or what, but I found it to be very dry, dense and not that sweet. I baked it 35 min, and pulled it out before it browned. I was kind of disappointed with all the rave reviews it had. Might try again.

We loved this recipe, best of many we have tried.  The only thing that I would like is just a little bit more sweet.  How do you sweeten the recipe without changing the overall product?

I've been searching for months for a "go-to" cornbread recipe...and I just found it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out perfectly. I tried many recipes that had more of a cakelike consistency, but I was looking for one that made sweet, "cornmealy" style cornbread instead. After numerous fails and disappointments, I finally found the oneI  Needless to say, my husband and I went back for seconds, and I think he may have even snuck in a third piece when I wasn't looking.  Thanks for the great recipe!

My whole family raved about this the first time i made it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out great! Definitely not a southern cornbread, but I much prefer the sweet "Yankee" cornbread and I love this recipe!

This  is the best cornbread you will ever eat!!! I like to substitute plain yogurt and milk for the buttermilk. Leftovers are great toasted with strawberry jam.

Love the ingredients list. Can't stand the instructions. Each step is fraught with danger. 

I melt the butter and sugar together while preheating. 
Whisk the dry ingredients. 
Whisk the eggs and buttermilk.
Temper the eggs/buttermilk with the melted butter/eggs. 
Combine the custard and dry ingredients. 

Browning the butter is always delicious. I always replace half (or all) the flower with an 8-1 almond meal and coconut flower combination.

Absolutely delicious and easy to make. Thank you for the tip on mixing everything in the pot and not having extra mixing bowls to clean! The flavor and texture was perfect!  I made no modifications and it came out just the way I was hoping for - just enough sweetness. Just one note... mine was completely done at 22 mins had I left it in any longer I think it may have been dry so just watch out on the cooking time.

Love it.  This is now a regular staple with dinner at least once a week.  I play the with the recipe. My husband loves when I substitute the flour with maseca. Make for a dense sweet buttermilk cord bread.

This cornbread won me first prize at a cook off. It is just perfect. Great taste and texture. I pressed a couple of garlic cloves and added that while melting the butter for a little extra flavour.

This recipe is perfect! Very moist, an intense corn flavor and fluffy. I made it with Splenda and whole wheat flour. I can tell I will make it again with other variations such as fennel seeds, or pieces of cheese and salted version. I used a cast iron skillet. It’s a keeper!

SO EASY and SO YUMMY. I'm a southern girl born and bred, but I have no problem with this "non-southern" recipe. Super fast to make which is great when you're worrying about a bunch of other things cooking. Everyone loved it. Made it a couple of months ago and making it again tonight!

I never  made cornbread before, or used buttermilk before, but this sounded so good I had to try it.I followed the recipe exactly.  I used a well seasoned #5 cast iron skillet (8 “diameter, 2” deep) Preheated, with a 1/2 teaspoon of bacon fat for 10 min. at oven temp stated on this recipe. I made  the batter while the skillet preheated. Then I spread the bacon fat all around the inside edges and bottom with a paper towel and quickly added the batter to the “hot” skillet ..Got the sizzle! The cornbread rose to 1+6/8” along the edges and 1+7/8” in the center. Did not overflow, which was a concern, but it was the perfect skillet for the batter amount. I Let it cool for ten minutes and used a silicone spatula to lift out of the pan and put it on a dinner plate. It was still hot, but it had released from the bottom of the skillet, so it was a easy removal. One piece left..so it was a hit! Just used butter on the warm cornbread when we ate it. Yummy...will definitely make again now that we know how good it actually is!

Great recipe, easy too. I usually put Hillshire lil’smokies and make corn dog muffins as a savory snack. Now I don’t need to buy packaged corn bread anymore. Also this allowed me to use whole wheat flour as well. I did follow the instructions to bake them longer than regular flour.

This is now our 'go to' corn bread!  I made it exactly as directed, except that I used a cast iron skillet and mixed & baked in the same pan.  We like sweeter corn bread and this is FABULOUS!

This is plain fantastic and would give it 1000 stars if I could.  I like my cornbread sweet and this has the perfect amount of sweetness.  I sometimes add green chile to this recipe and the results are also amazing.  Thank you for sharing this.  I make it numerous times a month and we all fight over the last piece!

This turned out fantastic.  I had never made cornbread before so I decided to be adventurous and bake it in my 10 inch cast iron skillet.  I placed the skillet in a 375 degree oven while I prepared the batter. I then added about a tablespoon of clarified butter to the skillet to melt before pouring in the batter and baking it for about 20 minutes.  The wedges just glided out of the skillet. I found the end result to be very tasty and my husband ended up eating half of it in one sitting.  My made no changes to the ingredients and will absolutely make it again. Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This is definitely the prettiest corn bread I've made. The only change I will make in the future is cutting down the sugar amount. Otherwise, it was fantastic!

I didn’t have buttermilk so I just used milk with about a tbsp. Of Apple cider vinegar which I let set for a few minutes before adding. This cornbread was amazing and I will definitively be making again!

This is the best cornbread I’ve ever made! Stuck to the recipe as is, didn’t change a thing. As soon as it came out of the oven I brushed the top with butter and served. A perfect sweetness and crumb. This is my new go to recipe I love it!

I made this tonite. I grew up and currently live in the south but love sweet buttery cornbread. This sure fits the bill. Love the texture and the flavor is perfect!  I never make changes or substitutions the first time I use a recipe—seems a bit disrespectful. Ok, I used sour milk instead of buttermilk, but who keeps fresh buttermilk on hand these days lol. Other than that I made as written and it was perfect. My new cornbread recipe. THANKS!!

Was the best corn bread I've made. Granted it was my first time making corn bread, it super easy. I did how ever mix and baked it in a  cast iron skillet. 30 minutes and it was perfect.

I used this cornbread to top a pie made of beans, diced tomatoes, onions, ground beef, chipotle peppers and So Delicious non-dairy cheese. It was awesome. Due to dietary restrictions, I had to make modifications and will share them in case anyone else is dairy/gluten/soy-free and is wondering how it would turn out: swapped in Bob's Red Mill 1 for 1 gluten free flour for standard flour; used coconut milk with a splash of apple cider vinegar instead of buttermilk; used Smart Balace soy-free spread instead of butter; lastly used 1/2 cup sugar because I was concerned the coconut milk had some sweetness to it already. And it was still as fabulous as everyone said it was when following the original instructions! 

Thank you for sharing!

I followed Grandmother's recipe exactly as written and incorporated all her personal changes. 
Oven was 375 degrees for exactly 30 minutes. I did as instructed and melted the butter in the pot, then removed pot from the stove and added sugar, beaten eggs, stirred a few times then added all the other ingredients. Poured in the greased 8x8 pan and baked for 30 minuted. This was so moist and by far the best corn bread recipe I have ever made. I did make my own buttermilk to save money, 1 cup of milk and tsp of white vinegar. Outstanding. DON'T CHANGE A THING WITH THIS RECIPE AND IF YOU DO WRITE YOUR OWN RECIPE AS THIS IS GRANDMOTHER'S

Delicious, old fashioned corn bread!!  my family LOVES this cornbread.  I personally make a few adjustments, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and then I make the whole thing in a cast iron skillet - first melting the butter and stirring the sugar in, followed by the eggs and the remaining ingredients per the directions.  When it’s almost mixed, I add about a cup of corn, frozen or fresh depending on the time of year.  Rave reviews from my family — thank you for sharing!

Delicious cornbread. I made a small modification, though. I preheated a cast-iron skillet with butter and a bit of bacon grease (enough to make the 1/2 C) - until the butter was browned and nutty smelling.  I then added the butter to my batter, and baked in the pre-heated skillet. Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.  The cornbread was delicious, with an awesome nutty crust.

I made this yesterday for the first time ever -  and it came out perfect.   Since I was cooking it in an iron skillet - I needed more batter - so I changed the amounts by 1.5.    So, when it calls for 2 eggs, I put in 3.   It calls for 1 cup of flour, I put in 1 1/2 cups of flour.  I did that all the way down - 
Cooked for 25 minutes in iron skillet - very slightly under, so I cooked for 5 more minutes and it came out perfectly.

Loved this recipe. Very easy to follow. I used 1/2 cup sugar and increased cornmeal by 1/2 a cup.  Had to make my own butter milk by adding a tablespoon of vinegar to 1 cup milk. This recipe turned out lovely! Thanks for sharing.

Very, very good. Perfect texture. I reduced sugar a little, but I do think it would be good with full amount. I used one teaspoon of salt & was fine. Not too salty, nor too sweet.

So quick and easy to make, and all made in the same pan before being put directly into the baking dish.  Less clean up than recipes I've done before, and really good. I loved how crispy the edges were. Yum

My goto recipe for cornbread and everyone comments on it. I never have buttermilk, so I always mix a table spoon on lemon juice to a cup of mix and let it stand for 5 mins before adding in the recipe.

Was so frustrated with the horrid results from recipe on the side of the bag so I came here. I didn’t have buttermilk, so I used heavy cream instead and it was fabulous. I baked it in a cast iron pan. Delicious with chili. Highly recommended.

I followed the recipe, but doubled the ingredients with the exception of the sugar (just used 2/3). I use this to make my cornbread dressing for Thanksgiving and Christmas. It came out just right. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

To all you people making comments about Southerners and this recipe:  I have lived my entire 51 years in Alabama and I'm southern to the core.  And I love cornbread with sugar.  It's not about where you live...it's about individual tastes.   A true Southerner respects those differing tastes.  Don't hate on it just because it isn't your taste.

Easy to make and very authentic taste. The buttermilk makes the difference to set this cornbread apart from other recipes. I like to add one diced jalapeno to mine.

35 minutes of baking, it is burnt and doesn't taste right.  Others reviews all have too many comments about substituting and making changes, etc. so maybe this recipe isn't just right to begin with.  Like the video that goes with it though.

This is wonderful recipe for some good homemade cornbread. Instead of melting butter in the pan, I just put butter in a cup and microwave it for a minute. I then pour the melted butter in an aluminum pan and added some sugar to it.  I did not put that much sugar in the mixture as  I don't care for sweet cornbread. Next, I  added the eggs, baking soda, buttermilk, cornmeal, unbleached flour, and salt into the aluminum pan and then stir  until blended together. This will reduce time of cleaning dishes afterwards. I baked the cornbread uncovered  for 25 minutes rather than 40 minutes to avoid cornbread being so tough and let it cool for at least 15 minutes. Once it's cool, I ate it with some collard/turnip greens and boy was it delicious!!

Best cornbread I've ever made.  I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup otherwise I made it exactly as shown.  (Just trying to cut calories...hahaha).  I made it right in the cast iron skillet.  It had a wonderful little crispy buttery edge and it was moist and delicious.  Thank you!!!!

This should be titled Corn Cake.  It is very , very sweet and you will taste the butter.  This is more like a dessert than a bread.
Even my sweet tooth teenager thought it too sweet.

I made this the way it was stated.  Next time I will decrease the cornmeal and increase the flour as other cooks have.  It was to gritty but delicious.  Family loved it.  Will make this again with the adjustments.

This corn bread was moist, sweet, and delicious. I loved it! The only downside is that even though I saved the leftovers in a ziplock baggie, it just wasn't very good the next day. It was dry and heavy. It must be eaten fresh.

Good cornbread is hard to make but this slightly sweet and moist. I used semolina flour instead because my friend who is a chef said to. It gave  it a good texture and it held together better. I did reduce the sugar by a little but still tasted good.

This was my first time making cornbread from scratch. This recipe came out delicious. I made it with the whole wheat flour, as mentioned in the added comment and I served it with homemade chili.  This will absolutely be my go-to recipe for cornbread.

This is my "go-to" cornbread recipe. It's not low calorie, but it's soooo good! 

I skip the first part about using a skillet. I melt the butter in a large glass bowl and mix everything together in that, our into a buttered glass baking dish and bake.

Very good following recipe exactly! Wouldn't change a thing. It was super easy and super delicious. I doubled the recipe as I knew one batch would be gone too quickly. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This cornbread is perfect. Light, fulffy and sweet. You could use less sugar if you prefer cornbread that isn’t sweet. Buttermilk keeps it moist and delish.

It’s ok as is. But I’d suggest cutting te sugar in half at least. Also, I like to put butter in my pan and put it in the oven. Pour your batter in a hot buttered pan and it’s amazing

This is now my go-to cornbread recipe, yum! Everyone loved it and I even messed the steps up a bit. I did cut the sugar in half because I don't like my cornbread very sweet. I baked it in the cast iron skillet and it turned out so well.

This was my first time making this cornbread and my first time using buttermilk  , my husband will only eat one piece when I make cornbread but with this one he had three so this is a keeper . It's a sweet cornbread and I might try cutting the sugar a little  bit but plan to keep this one .  Teased the  husband saying I could frost it and call it cake .

I followed this recipe exactly and was blown away. I've made it 3 times so far and the only thing I've changed was the baking time. More between 30-35 minutes. I found that the full 40 minutes makes it dry for my liking. Other than that, excellent recipe, and alterations not needed!

SO GOOD and so easy! Hardly more effort than preparing a pkg of Jiffy Mix, and everyone raves about it! I have made it a couple of times with a buttermilk substitute (milk + lemon juice or vinegar), but my family can tell the difference. People who don't know any better still think it's great, but it really is best with true buttermilk.

I'm a southern girl with a very southern husband. This cornbread was accidentally put into the southern category, but it surely rivals any family recipes we have! It doesn't have a greasy or fatty taste. It's very light, in fact, for cornbread. I followed the recipe just as written except I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet instead of a pan. Delicious and perfect! I'm adding it to my favorites!

This is an interesting recipe. Texture seems very spongy but my husband loved it. It is very sweet. Reduce sugar to your taste. I used an iron skillet hoping for a crispy bottom but it wasn't crispy. The top, however; was crisp & brown. One suggestion that might make the texture less spongy is to pour them thinner. I also noticed that as they sat on the counter, the spongy texture was not so spongy.

Oh my!  Call this recipe whatever you like, but for those of you who are looking for  a true "cornbread", this isn't for you.  If you want more of a sweet "cake",  you have found your recipe.

I've been using the recipe from the cornmeal  box to make cornbread for the past 20 years, with disappointing results every time. The end product was usually dry and lacking in flavor. I would always have to ask the next day, "Who wants to finish off this cornbread?" Eventually, the last piece or two would end up in the trash (and I am not one who takes the wasting of food lightly! I would gladly have eaten those last pieces of substandard cornbread myself if I wasn't on a low-carb diet! I cook things like this for my carb hungry family!) I figured it was time for a change. My family loves my homemade chili, which I like to serve with cornbread, so I thought I should find a cornbread recipe that would do it justice. Hallelujah! This is it! Now I know what was missing from my cornbread all this time! Buttermilk and butter! Those made all the difference between "meh" cornbread and "is there any left?" cornbread! From now on, this is my go-to cornbread recipe. My family, my chili, my trash can, and my thrifty-minded conscience thank you!

Cut the sugar in half at least. Other than that, this is a really great recipe! It was tall, fluffy and moist. It had a great crust on the outside too. Absolutely yummy, but too sweet as written.

This is a perfect recipe! Just follow the directions and you will get a beautiful result. In my convection oven this is done in 20-25 minuets.   Without convection it was done in 30 minuets.   This cornbread recipe has turned non-cornbread lovers into believers. My family rents it often for family dinners. Try it! You won’t be sorry.

Now I LOVE cornbread, with butter, with chili, in milk or just straight out of the oven with nothing. This recipe is AMAZING!!!  Thank you so much for sharing...I NEVER want to lose it!

Perfect, if you like it to be a little sweeter you could add some more sugar but for my taste it was perfect. Now make sure you losen it up from the sides before turning. I like flipping it then quickly turning it again so the cracked top faces up when served.

This cornbread is awesome just as is! I am very careful about bake times, so I actually cooked mine for 20 minutes.  My oven tends to run a bit hot anyways. This was moist and awesome, and will definitely make again!

Great recipe! I'd definitely make this again though as someone else suggested, I cut the sugar to 1/2 a cup. I don't like my cornbread overly sweet though it is delicious served with a smidge of butter and honey. 

I took it out of the oven after 30 minutes and it was perfectly browned and very moist but baked through. I made it for Thanksgiving and have a feeling there won't be leftovers.  This recipe was very easy to make, I didn't even need to get my mixer out; a spoon worked just fine. Also, to save washing pots/pans I microwaved the butter  for 2 minutes in a small dish, to melt it. 

Everything mixed up fine in one bowl and then I poured into a greased glass baking dish. Easy clean up. I greased with butter for flavour (as opposed to some other oil). Happy baking!

Fantastic! I'm from NC and we have sweet cornbread there that tastes like this. Plus you add honey butter just out of the oven and man this is good. Perfect with a bowl of chili. This recipe is Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing. I didn't have buttermilk, but I just added a splash of vinegar to my milk and it was perfect.

This was my first time making cornbread, I always had an interest in it. I made it this past weekend and it was a total hit, my husband and two young boys could not get enough of it. The only thing I would say is, because myself and my husband diet all week, we only have Sundays as our cheat day, so I would add a touch more sugar to the recipe, just out of preference. Thank you so much for sharing this, and this will not be the last time I make this !

Followed the recipe with the following adds: added 1/2 C cheese to the batter and poured it into a hot, buttered cast iron skillet. Topped with another 1/2C shredded cheese and baked per instructions. Was the perfect side to a heart beef stew on a chilly fall night. Wonderful!

Wow! This is the best cornbread recipe I have ever tried! I used corn flour instead of cornmeal to make it less gritty. We also made honey butter (butter, honey, vanilla, cinnamon) to go with it and this tasted like a dessert, yum!!! Thank you!!

Yeah, too much sugar. Grandma and my mom use NO SUGAR, or only 1T. We don't like cornbread cake! We want it to be a bread that goes with a meal. For dessert you can then put apple butter, sorgum, or perserves on it.

Really good. Teenagers loved it. Easy to make. I baked mine in a glass 8x8 for 25 minutes, and I wouldn't have cooked it any longer. Perfect.  Will be making again soon. Thanks for sharing!

I made this as written several times and it turns out great.  Southern cornbread doesn’t have sugar, so this is more like a cornbread cake.  If you don’t want the sweetness cut back on the sugar.

Found this recipe to be quite gummy, and too dense for my taste, probably due to the high butter and sugar content. Won't even try tweaking it.

Nice recipe! I softened the butter in a large Pyrex cup then added the other ingredients in order. I used 3/4 cup plain yogurt +1/4 cup milk for the buttermilk and whole wheat for half the flour, then added a tablespoon of flaxseed. Next time I'll cut the sugar in half.

Fantastic and super easy.  The only cornbread I have ever eaten has always come from a box and I was never a fan of it.  I decided to try this to go with dinner and I was not disappointed.  If I knew cornbread could taste so good I would have started making this years ago

I made this in my cast iron skillet. Left out the sugar as I don't like sweet cornbread. Very dry after only 20 minutes in the oven.

This cornbread tastes great. I used canola oil instead of butter because my husband doesn't eat butter. Other than that, I exactly followed the recipe and it came out wonderful.

Made this cornbread to go with pinto beans for dinner.  This was the first I have made cornbread.  The recipe was easy and came out delicious, I did not change anything.  Our whole family loved it!

I have made this for the past 40 years at least (found it Sunset Magazine). My husband loves it. It is so good for breakfast with a hearty egg and sausage casserole. But of course it goes with chili too.

Tasty cornbread. Made in an 8" square glass baking dish. The pieces cut around the perimeter were a tad drier than the other ones. The center pieces were moist, and perfect. Next time, plan to make muffins as others did so that all bake more evenly. This cornbread was served with 'Old Charleston Style Shrimp and Grits', a recipe from this site.

This was great! I used real buttermilk, baked in a preheated, (large) oiled cast-iron pan. Very sweet. Might add less sugar next time. Added 1/2 can of creamed corn, reduced the buttermilk by 1/4 c and added about 1/3-1/4 c extra cornmeal to counteract the liquid. Love it!

The best cornbread I've ever had! I don't know about the others cutting sweetness-I love sweet cornbread so I actually put a little extra sugar in it! My husband and I love it. I'm an Okie, he's a Texan and we like it sweet, I don't care whether that makes us "not true Southerners" as others have said. ;) if you like it sweet and moist, this is your recipe!

Amazing, these are by far the tastiest cornbread muffins I or anyone who's tried these have tasted. They are so soft, moist, not that sweet, and perfect in all different ways. This is now my go to recipe for cornbread. Great job with the recipe, and thanks for posting it, because it's amazing.

AMAZING!!! The only thing I did differently was I didn't have buttermilk so I did a tablespoon of vinegar and then the rest regular milk to make up 1 Cup. I also made mini muffins so this recipe ended up making 24 mini muffins and I cooked them for 15 minutes. This will definitely be my go-to recipe!

I did not make any changes to the original recipe. It is quick and flavourful.  It also toasts well.  I've made this many, many times and it always turns out great.

I would mention to mix only til the ingredients are blended, not to over-mix.  Doing it this way results in a tender-liscious texture..

I'm normally not a cornbread fan because it's too dry for me. However, I needed to bring corn bread to a BBQ potluck, so tried this recipe. It was so easy to make and outstanding! I got rave reviews from everyone!. If you like Southern cornbread you won't like this because its not dry and savory; it's more like  a cake (moist and buttery).  However, I totally loved it (and so did my husband) and didn't even need to put honey and butter on! It is a little too sweet for me, so next time I'll cut back on the sugar. I also substituted some real Class B maple syrup to add a slightly more complex taste profile, and added some shredded jalapeno jack cheese.

Not good at all!
This is way too sweet, 2/3 cup of sugar, yuck! It did not have a very good corn taste at all. I used white corn meal but I doubt that it was the reason. What a waste.

I made this just like it said, however, there is no "cornmeal" here in Malawi so I used maize meal which is basically the same.  It was light with  a little bit of sweetness.

It is absolutely delicious!  We truly enjoyed this cornbread.  I have made it exactly written which I love but I want to make it healthier so I made some modification: used coconut oil instead of butter and use half of coconut flour and half of regular flour.  It is SOOOOO good.

Very good dense cornbread.  I doubled it and put in a 9x13 pan.  I baked at 375 for 30 mins and that was plenty as the edges were near burning and toothpick came out clean.  I think I would lower temp to 350 for a 9x13.  I only had 2/3 cup white sugar so I used 2/3 cup brown too.  (I doubled recipe so needed 1 1/3 cup sugar.

This recipe is a keeper.  I like my cornbread on the sweeter side, so this was perfect.  I didn't change the ingredients at all, but I did bake it in a cast iron pan because I like the crust crispy.  This was definitely NOT cakey or dense.  The texture was perfect in my book.

Changes I made....12" cast iron pan smoking hot on high heat.  Quickly buttered it up.  Poured the mixture into the pan.  Let it cook for maybe a minute.  Put it in the oven at 450° for 18 minutes.  Was perfect.

This was pretty darn good.  I would make it again.  I had some coconut oil that I wanted to use up, so 1/2 butter and 1/2 coconut oil.  Didn't have all purpose flour, so I used bread  flour. Used instant buttermilk. Mis-read recipe and used 1.5 tsp of baking powder.  Mixed all dry ingredients together. Mixed egg and water (from instant buttermilk) together then added in melter butter/oil.   Mixed wet into dry. And it still came out really tasty.  Has a little bit of a coconut taste, which seems to work well.

I've made this countless times - it's our go to! Since I don't keep buttermilk around, I pretty much always sub it for skim milk/splash of vinegar.

Great cornbread. I melted the butter in the microwave and finished the rest in a bowl. Sounded easier to me than using a pan to do the mixing . Using a glass baking dish and a new gas oven, it was ready in 28 minutes.

Delicious!  I did reduce the amount of sugar for health reasons. It is still a wonderful treat with chili! Thank you for sharing it, Bethany>

Very moist, very flavorful. Made it many times. Cook for less time if making muffins.

I made this cornbread again with sour cream.  I still thought it was dry......but thanks for the recipe.   I did use lite sour cream instead of full fat...maybe it would would have been better with that.

I followed the directions except I put all wet ingredients into a separate mixing bowl and combined all dry ingredients into another bowl.  Threw them all together into another bowl and mixed.  Then I heated a cast iron, 10 inch skillet with a 1/4 cup of vegetable oil on a stove on medium heat,  and poured all ingredients in a it simmered for a minute.  Then baked for 5 minutes less then the called recipe.  If you like crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside, this works.

Excellent! I am a born & raised Tennessean. I don't usually eat sweet cornbread. This recipe isn't too sweet & can be modified to be less sweet by reducing the amount of sugar. I always, always? use cast iron for cornbread & did so here. Bakes about 20-25 minutes & turns out beautifully. For those who fuss about true southern cornbread, many use those bags of cornmeal mix (entirely different from boxes of jiffy mix!) Let me assure you guys who use that product that you are indeed using sugar in your cornbread because it's already in those big 5# bags! I think the secret to the success of this recipe is the melted butter & buttermilk. Many in our area do not use eggs in cornbread because of the more cakelike result. I include eggs in my cornbread always because I think it improves texture & also increases the nutritional value of the bread. I recommend the first time you make this recipe, make exactly as written whether you make it in a separate saucepan where you melt the butter or in a bowl. Makes great muffins which are easier to freeze for individual servings portions or for church potluck dinner dinners! Thanks for a great recipe!

I am not usually a big fan of cornbread since I find them dry and blah.  I baked some cornbread with my daughter for her school project using this recipe and we loved it.   It turned out  very moist and flavorful.  The steps are also super easy.   Thanks for sharing :)

Excellent!  Very easy to make--I prepped all the ingredients first and had them "at the ready" to put into the 3 qt skillet.  I wasn't absolutely certain whether I should beat the eggs before adding or beat them in with the warm butter and sugar, so I opted to lightly beat before adding.  The end result was moist, tasty and with a good cornbread sweetness.  Will make again!

Some people are obviously suffering under the impression that only 'Southerners' eat cornbread. A) Not everyone likes corn meal flavored styrofoam. B) There are a lot of 'Southerners' that like a little or a lot of sweetener in their cornbread. C) Cornbread existed long before Europeans got to the New World. Deal with it.

This cornbread was delicious. I liked it even better when I subbed out the white sugar for honey.

I love this recipe.  The only thing I do different sometimes would be when I don't have buttermilk on hand.  My grandma taught me years ago that 1 cup milk and 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar is a great substitute.  I leave this mix in my cast iron skillet and bake it in my convection oven at 25 degrees lower that what is suggested.  Yummy, Yummy, Yummy!

Cut the sugar to 1/2 cup per other reviewers and should have cut the time back!! I made muffins and they were still moist and delicious but very brown on the bottom. I WILL make these again. Loved the one pot convenience and the taste and texture. Thank you!

Made it in my small rice cooker and worked perfectly! Twenty minutes on one side and less than ten on the other. Little editions for half the suggested serving: half a cup minus one tablespoon of soy milk, one tablespoon apple cider, and two tablespoons of yogurt in stead of the buttermilk, and two and a half tablespoons of honey instead of the sugar. The dough was pretty thick this time so maybe I should add more of my "buttermilk". The cornmeal was a little bit dry but the sweetness and the sourness was perfect!

Beautiful cornbread. I reduced the sugar as it was a bit too sweet for my taste. It has a great texture, not crumbly at all.

great recipe - as mentioned i used a cast iron skillet that pre-heated in the oven - my 12 inch (outside diameter) - was just a little bit too large since it resulted in only a 1.25 inch height - perhaps a little more baking soda would have providing a better rise. One tip is to get the final batter in the oven quickly since it gets very dry-like just after mixing so make sure the skillet is ready for it before mixing. With all that, the taste was outstanding - and make sure to use Yellow corn meal, not white

I made this to go with the Roasted Tomato Soup recipe, also from this site. It is so delicious, I had to make sure I froze the leftovers right away or I'd make myself sick eating the whole pan. I almost gave it 4 stars due to a few issues, but then realized I love it regardless, so it still earns 5 stars. 

Issues: 
1.  It seemed strange to prep it in the skillet but then put it in a different, square pan to bake (I used a stone baker). Why not just keep it in the skillet? Next time I will.

2. Very sweet. It's good, but I don't associate cornbread with this amount of sweetness. I didn't put any butter or honey or anything on it. It didn't need it. I'm on the fence about what I think about this... love  the cornbread but would kind of like to at my own sweetness upon serving/eating.

3. The cornmeal ended up grittier in the end result than usual. I think next time I'll let it soak a few minutes in the buttermilk mixture before adding it to the pan.

Otherwise, great! I don't feel I can make it for guests yet until I deal  with the grittiness issue. While cornbread probably should be a little gritty, this was uncomfortably so.

Doubled recipe and baked for 30 min in a 9x13. I melted butter in a large glass dish in microwave vs using a pan and melting. The recipe is super easy. I like my bread a little more moist, but I received a lot of compliments and recipe requests so I must be part of the minority.

I made this tonight because other cornbread recipes turn out dry.  This was perfect!  My husband loved it as well.  Thank you.  This one is a keeper in my book! :)

I followed the recipe exactly and it came out light and moist. My husband thinks this is as good as the cornbread his mother used to make.

I used full-fat yogurt since we didn't have any buttermilk,  added a drained can of jalapeños, and baked for 30 minutes (convection oven) in a loaf pan.  When I tasted-tested it, I wanted a lot more than a taste!  Moist, light, flavorful, and easy to make - recipe seems foolproof and adaptable.  Next time I'm going to try adding rosemary; love versatile recipes like this!

This was amazing! It was very moist, and not crumbly at all. I put slightly less sugar in it as I didn't want a super sweet cornbread. I only had a cup and a half of buttermilk, so I also used half a cup of  slightly soured whipping cream.  :D 

I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 10x13 pan. It ended up needing 40 minutes in the oven.

Yes I will make this again! Got rave reviews! I melted the butter in the microwave rather than in a skillet. Also, I baked it in a 9-inch round pain rather than 8x8 square pan. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

I cut all ingredients in half. Used soured milk instead of buttermilk. I then cooked in a loaf pan for 30 minutes. The bread came out nice but had little rising, ending up being about 1" high when done. The bread was good & I would make again.

This is very easy recipe. I made two batches and the only thing I changed was lowering the amount of sugar in one to lessen the sweetness. I would recommend doing that if you are making it as a side dish, but it if is going to be eaten with something spicy, like chili, the spicy will balance the sweet.

This cornbread tastes like a sweet cake!  My family loves it.  My only recommendation is reducing the sugar in half so that it does not taste like a jiffy mix cornbread.  The sugar can be a little overpowering over the corn meal.  Otherwise, I made it as stated and it was super, super awesome.

I have made this as written many times.  Our family likes cornbread the traditional way and sweet.  This recipe is the sweet variety.  The cornmeal keeps it from getting to cake like and gives it some texture.  It was very moist and not at all crumbly.  If you hate sweet cornbread, then this is not for you.  If you like sweet cornbread or are open to trying it, then this will likely be a keeper recipe for you.  Maybe next time I will try some additions like corn kernels or jalapeños.  We have always had it plain and served with fresh butter and honey. Time to tweak things a bit.

Doubled recipe, didn't have buttermilk so used whole milk with white vinegar mixed in, let sit for 10 min. or so.  Made dozen regular muffins and an 8" pan.  Good cornbread.

More "cake" than "bread", in my opinion, but I just so happen to like cake! It was an excellent accompaniment to a meat/bean/veg chilli.

Made this exactly as the recipe reads.  Was perfection.  I ended up pulling it out of the oven at about 26 minutes.  Will only use this recipe going forward.  Texture, flavor, ease....all 5 star worthy!!

Wouldn't change a thing..except...
By being distracted...after having all the ingredients measured..I dumped the cornmeal into the larger bowl i had put flower in.
So. I said.."how bad can it be" so I just dumped everything in the one bowl. Using sift butter,i didnt even melt that. Didnt mix or beat anything separately. Then..I beat it all with me electric mixer.
It came out perfect. Time and dishes saved..

The corn bread was moist enough, but I found it to be way too sweet and lacking in corn flavor. It was good enough to finish, but I don't think that I'll make it again.

Made this just as directed. It was moist and slightly sweet.  So much better than the package mix.   A great accompaniment with my chilli.

Best cornbread. I was skeptical about the amount of sugar (1 cup seemed a little high compared to the standard cornbread recipe) but it was perfect; not too sweet but just sweet enough. Recipe made 12 generous sized muffins (18 min @ 375).

Delicious, the whole family loved it! Used the same pan that I melted the butter in to mix everything. I cooked it for 30 minutes and it came out great!

My husband found this recipe a few months ago and wanted to try it since I don't like cornbread and he loves it. We made it for Thanksgiving for the entire Southern family and had it requested for Christmas, New Years and the Super Bowl. What a hit!  I changed nothing. Thank you from the whole family.

First time I made it, followed the recipe but baked it in a pre-heated cast iron skillet.  Unfortunately, my skillet is 12" so the bread was good but too thin.  Made it again tonight for a Super Bowl Party, WOW ... Doubled the recipe since we had 20 people, still had leftovers because it made so much.  Just watch the top to know when it's done.  Works great just doubling and putting in a large skillet.

Most recipes just aren't right when using GF flours.  This one turned out excellent.  I melted the butter in my iron skillet and then mixed the other ingredients, stuck it in the oven for 33 min and it was perfect!

I don't believe in making changes to a recipe then rating it so I followed it to the letter.  For me, I would increase the salt next time but other than that it was great.  Thank you!

This is the best cornbread I've ever made-and I didn't change a thing. It is moist and so very tasty. You will love it if you like moist cornbread that is not cakey.
And to those of you who said that "no true southerner puts sugar in the cornbread..." I say, I am NOT a southerner, but we who live north of the Mason Dixon line also like cornbread, but a sweeter version than that of the south.

I had no buttermilk so used 1/3 C milk and 2/3 C sour cream to replace and I added a defrosted bag of frozen corn.

This is a really sweet recipe so next time I do not think I will add 2/3 C sugar but only 1/3.

I followed the recipe exactly and only baked it 30 min.  Had a good flavor, but was too fluffy and crumbly for my taste.  It just falls apart when you try to pick it up or spread butter on it.  I prefer more dense cornbread.  If I make it again, I'll try adding less baking soda and see if that helps.

First time I threw it out as it was too sweet, dry and flavourless.  Second time ignored the sugar and added a can of niblet corn  - tasted better and not dry. I mixed it in a bowl and not a skillet and I also buttered the 8x8 pan and put it in the oven for a couple of minutes to warm up.

Delicious way to use up the rest of the buttermilk I got for another recipe! Baked as 12 full-size muffins for 22 minutes. These are cakey and sweet, and more light than dense.

Fabulous recipe. Very moist and nicely flavored. I made one change and that was to cut the sugar from 2/3 cup down to 1/2 cup. For us it was still a tad bit sweeter than we'd have liked so next batch I will cut sugar in half down to 1/3 cup and go from there. Cooking time was exactly 35 minutes for the toothpick to come out clean. Definitely is my "go to" cornbread recipe!

I melt the butter in a large bowl in the microwave then add in the ingredients as directed, with the addition of a chopped jalapeño.  Then I cook it in a heated cast iron skillet for 25 minutes. It's perfect every time!

I put slightly less than 1/3 cup of sugar and it turns out great.  I soured 2% milk with 1 tsp of vinegar to replace buttermilk.  It was very good!

Hands down the best cornbread I ever ate. But since I am gluten free I had to change the recipe. Instead of flour I used coconut flour. I also added 1 tsp of baking powder. I was afraid it would not work because it was like mashed potatoes instead of a pourable batter. I squeezed the batter into my corn bread pan (cast iron) and lowered the temp by 25 degrees. It took 5 minutes more to cook to a golden brown (I'm at high altitude). The came out beautiful- moist, sweet, and no need for butter. This is my favorite corn bread now.

Used 1c milk + 1tbsp white vinegar, since I didn't have buttermilk. Also used whole wheat pastry flour instead of normal flour. Turned out great! Even the Super picky Boyfriend loved it!

This was a really moist cornbread with just the right amount of sweetness. I did add half a can of sweet corn. I'll be trying it with cream style corn next time. Hubby loves it so will be making again real soon

Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe. I  made it exactly as presented and it was delicious. The density and taste were both perfect for my family - not too dense, but not like a cake either. The sweetness was just right and it was easy to cut - it held together without crumbling. Though some of us added butter and honey, it was excellent without too. This will definitely be my go to recipe for cornbread from here on out! Again, thank you for sharing.

My grandmother and mother was raised in the South. They mixed all the ingredients in a cast iron skillet and baked it. I still make it that way. And, they added sugar. I made this recipe tonight and it was delicious. I used powdered buttermilk and 3/4 cup of sugar. I like sweet bread with honey. Yum!

The taste is good, but very similair to Dutch cake.
I have followed recipe strict, but my version did raise only 1,5 cm (3/4 inch).

This recipe is perfectly sweet with chili. My family loves it. I have made this recipe at least 5 times with no problem. It will not be dry if you know your oven and the climate you live in...just start checking at 30 minutes. Delicious!

Great cornbread recipe!  Slightly sweet.  I let my glass pan preheat in oven before pouring in batter.  When ready to pour in batter I first rubbed butter along all sides of pan and when it started to pool up in bottom of pan I poured in the batter.  Had an excellent crust because of this.  I also added one finely chopped onion, half a fine chopped bell pepper, and 1/4 cup chopped jarred jalapeño.  Then sprinkled cheddar cheese on top.

I loved it but in reading the recipe thought it would be way too sweet so I cut sugar in half.  I still would cut back a bit more although it was still very good; moist and all the right consistencies.

I have made this recipe several times exactly as written (with the exception of reducing the sugar by half per my family's tastes). Perfect every time! I normally double the recipe and bake it in a 10x13 rectangle glass dish. I love that it's prepared in one pan so it's easy to clean up, too.

So so good! It is really sweet which goes really well with chili/soup that has a little kick. I preheat my cast iron pan & then pour the batter in, gives it a nice crust!

I do not have a sweet tooth, my husband has a double sweet tooth!  I was so hesitant to make this as written, but really prefer ratings that make to the exact recipe so I did.  Tasted prior to baking and thought it tasted like cake rather than cornbread. After baking I still thought it was a bit sweet for me but my husband thought I should seek no further...the holy grail of cornbread!  
For health purposes I will try to reduce the sugar a bit but will not alter much because the texture is PERFECT!

I almost never leave reviews for recipes, but I'm making an exception here.  This cornbread is AWESOME.  I did not make any changes, and it came out great -- moist, sweet, delicious.  I've made lots of cornbread, had some buttermilk I wanted to use up so tried this one.  Best I've ever made.  I believe it's better than any cornbread my grandma made.  It's now my go-to.

I decided to use my cupcake pan so I wouldn't have to worry about cutting anything and this recipe as is makes 19 of you do 2 spoonfuls per cupcake. You can also use baking powder if you don't have baking soda, just triple the amount (1 1/2 teaspoon). They taste great but I think I will add a bit more sugar next time. I prefer my cornbread really sweet and it just wasn't quite there.

This was  sickeningly sweet.  Ugh. I should have known when the recipe called for 2/3 cup sugar.  I made it anyway.  This is a mistake I'll never make again.

It is VERY good,  If you like sweet cornbread. Gave it 5 stars because it said "sweet and moist". Next time, I'll drastically reduce the sugar and see how it goes.

This was really good cornbread!  As others stated, it was a bit sweet.  Next time I make it I plan on using 1/2 cup of sugar instead of 2/3 cup.  I used a cast iron skillet and cooked it for 25 minutes at 365 (my oven tends to cook hot).  It came out nice and moist.

Absolutely FANTASTIC!!!!!!  This is my mother's cornbread that I remember growing up in the South.  Light, fluffy, moist, melt in your mouth goodness.  30 minutes in a Griswold cast iron skillet is the perfect cooking time.   If I could, I would kiss you (LOL)!  THANK  YOU SO MUCH!!!!!!!

After years of looking for a recipe that was moist and dense I finally found this.  Now the only cornbread recipe I will ever use.  Sometimes I add minced jalapeños for a spicy version.

Made it tonight to go with ham and beans. The only change that I made was using salted butter and thus omitting the  additional salt called for. It was delicious! The whole family loved it!

Wow! Wonderful recipe my husband and I both agreed is the one we remember from childhood.  I doubled the recipe, baked some in a heavy cast-iron pan and the rest in a 4 c glass baking dish. The resulting texture was different, but both were yummy. Check it at 25 min, definitely done at 30. Light, flavorful, slightly sweet and great firm texture. Best cornbread I've found in 60 years.

Excellent recipe! I was craving cornbread so bad, last time I had some was 8 years ago when I used to live in the US, but my hubby always discouraged me from making it because he didn't like it and didn't care for it. I made this recipe today and boy, I loved it! light and moist, perfect texture and consistency.  The only change I made was lowering the amount of sugar. My kids didn't like mixing this bread with salty foods ( they put it down as soon as they took a bite of the beans I served and reached for the salty bread instead), but they devoured it later as a dessert. This could be a successful option for breakfast, with warm milk and syrup, but as a bread for dinner, I would have to tweak the recipe and make it salty instead. I will definitely make this again as written, but it will definitely be for a sweet breakfast.

This is a very good cornbread recipe. I don't like my cornbread too sweet, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup, but I'll cut it back more next time. Other than that, it was great. The texture is perfect.

Love this recipe. I heavily modify if depending on what I'm out of or who is eating. It still works with as little as half the butter and half the sugar. Also good are a mixture of sour cream and milk if there is no buttermilk in hand. I routinely swap out half the flour with more corn meal or masa hating. Sometimes stir in half cup of corn kernels. Awesome recipe!

Whenever I make this cornbread, it's always a huge hit!  It's always requested at potlucks now.  've always used a buttermilk substitute (1 cup minus 1 tbsp of milk + 1 tbsp of lemon juice) and it's turned out great every time.  I also add a can of corn (drained) into the batter before baking.  Yummy!

I am from the south and my dad used sugar and butter in his cornbread. It was delicious; I use to call it "cake." 

I made this recipe as written and it was the bomb-diggity. It reminded me of my dad's cornbread. Don't skip over this recipe. You'll regret it!

I made this cornbread according to the recipe & it was amazing! My husband said it was a "homerun". Other cooks who don't like to used processed food/mixes should try this recipe. It is easy & quick. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I have tried way too many corn bread recipes. Most are too dry, too much flour, no real taste, no texture and usually disappointing. All I can say about this recipe is that most Grandma's don't go wrong. Truly a home run bread. This just became my go to corn bread recipe to go with my chili. Thank you so much for sharing with those of us wishing we had our own Grandma's recipe. I'd add a + to the five stars by the way.

I followed the directions ALMOST exactly and everyone loved this recipe. I didn't have baking soda so I had to use baking powder. They didn't rise in the muffin pans as much as I had hoped for but regardless, they were crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. I will definitely make this again.

I love the way this recipe turned out. It was moist and not overly sweet.  I have no concerns whether it is a traditional Southern Cornbread recipe as it is delicious; family and friends love it.  I grew up with a thinner unsweetened cornbread with no added flour or leavening agent.  My father crumbled his piece up and added it to his glass of milk and ate the soggy cornbread with a spoon; also a Southern tradition. It's not a matter of right or wrong, southern or northern... its a matter of people free to make a choice as what pleases their pallet no matter where they live.  Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This a a great recipe!  I like moist cornbread, not crumbly and this recipe makes the perfect moist cornbread.  As far as a true southerner not using sugar in a cornbread recipe, I don't believe the title had anything to do with being from the south.

I've made this a bunch of times and I always did the same way until tonight. BAKE IN A CAST IRON SKILLET YOU WON'T REGRET IT!! So always was afraid to just throw it all in there and into the oven. Laziness got the better of me tonight and so glad  it did cuz the crust was just so perfect! I make the recipe as written and always transferred it into a glass baking dish. Never again! That is the only thing wrong with this whole recipe. Oh, the other thing I do is make my own "buttermilk" because it's never something I keep on hand: 1 tablespoon of white vinegar in a glass measuring cup and add enough milk to make 1 cup. My cast iron skillet  is a 12" I think. I was afraid it was too big. It isn't - but only took just shy of 30 minutes to bake to a beautiful golden brown. Don't worry about greasing it: between the butter in the recipe and a well-seasoned pan there was no problem getting the corn bread out - even after completely cooled.

This is our go to corn bread.  I have made it numerous times and usually make it as is.  Sometimes I change it up, decrease the sugar and add a can of chopped green chilis or chopped jalapenos. That makes it extra delicious!

I melted the butter into a cast iron skillet in the oven while preheating.  The first time I made it I followed the recipe. It was way too sweet and you couldn't taste the cornmeal.  Changed to 1/4 c Sugar, 3/4 c flour, and 1 1/4 c cornmeal. Poured batter directly into hot skillet and melted butter. It was fantastic!

I sure did LOVE this! It's easy to follow and delicious. Clean up was easy too. I'm a born and raised New Englander, transplanted in FL. I was raised on sweet cornbread and this recipe is the best one I've ever tried since I was a teenager. I'm sharing it with my daughter bc she's been hunting around for something yummy too.
My husband loves this. We call it "OMG! Cornbread"

Love this recipe.  I make the batter exactly as described.  I do, however change up the pan that it's baked in.  Instead of a round pan or a loaf pan, I make it in two mini-muffin trays. (Usually makes 24). This way there's more crunchy surface area. I bake the trays for 30 minutes.  And to add extra crispness I usually broil on high for one minute (always watching to prevent burning). This recipe is a favourite of mine - and even my foodie friends are impressed.

Love , love, love this corn bread! It is the only cornbread I make anymore. The only thing I change is ,I pour mine into a  9X13 dish, simply because I like slightly thiner pieces. The flavor is so wonderful I usually don't even put butter on my piece. Great with Chili or cowboy gulousch.

After trying a few of the other cornbread recipes on this site, we decided that this one is hands-down our favorite.

Tip to self:  The addition of canned sweet corn and chopped jalapenos take it up another notch.

This is a great recipe! The cornbread came out moist and using buttermilk instead of regular milk did make a difference in the taste. I opted to use less sugar and added 2 tablespoons of honey since I don't like my cornbread too sweet. I made 2 batches and to the second batch I added jalepeños, Seaside cheddar, & corn.

I've been making this for years to rave reviews. Sometimes I add a tablespoon of honey. We love this recipe so much, we made this as well as a jalapeno jelly as a party favor at our wedding a few years ago. We still get requests for it. Enjoy.

Needed to make a good homemade cornbread for my Thanksgiving cornbread dressing and I had plenty of fresh ground cornmeal. Saw the reviews for this one and gave it a try. The recipe is excellent as written, but I had to make a few modifications since this was for a dressing. I increased the salt to a full teaspoon because I used unsalted butter, decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup, and I only needed to bake mine for about 25 minutes. It was so good! Will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful recipe for breakfast corn muffins.  I followed the recipe precisely the first time I made it.  It was a bit too sweet.  The second time...I reduced the sugar by half.   Perfect breakfast muffins!!!

Be sure to follow instructions stirring sugar into butter first.  I didn't once and threw everything together in a bowl, maybe didn't mix it as well as I should have, and it never really rose in the oven...  oops... totally my fault being lazy.  But all the other times, it's delicious and perfect. You can definitely adjust the sugar to your preferences. I usually cut it to 1/4 cup

I made it with grits instead of corn meal and it still came out great.   Also "made" buttermilk using evaporated 2% milk and apple cider vinegar.  Not overly sweet with cake-lIke texture.   Heated my greased pan while preheating oven before adding batter.  Perfect with our Chili.  Probably great base for corn bread stuffing.  Excellent recipe.   30 minutes exactly for perfection.

Made for my boyfriend to go with the boilermaker tailgate chili recipe that's on the site. We loved it the only thing different I do next time is make it in muffin tins so it's easier for my little boy to eat.

I made this recipe exactly as directed, excepted I used an 8" cast iron pan to mix everything up in/bake the cornbread.  Turned out perfectly!  Crispy outer edges, crumbly, buttery deliciousness!  My husband LOVES it and we will definitely be making this again!

This is by far my family's favorite cornbread recipe.   Followed the recipe to the letter the first time.  Wanted to cut back on sugar and butter a bit and found we like it much better.  I used 5 TBSP butter and melted in sm/med cast iron pan. Reduced sugar to 1/2 cup and also added 2 tsp of baking powder. Poured batter back in the cast iron pan.   My convection oven bakes much faster, so I check for doneness about 28 minutes.  Wonderful recipe.  I think the buttermilk is the key ingredient.

If you watch the cooking time this is delicious! It does taste a little different than the Jiffy mix so don't expect it to taste the same, but it's the best cornbread I've made from scratch so far!

Definitely making this again. I HATE cornbread out of the box, so I rarely eat it. After making this I will never eat boxed cornbread again. (not that I ate it much in the first place) All I did to change the recipe was add a little less sugar, and I mixed all my dry ingredients. But I doubt it changed anything. Absolutely WONDERFUL!!

I have made this recipe countless time. Quite often I also add 2 cups of blueberries (fresh or frozen) to a double recipe. Sprinkle 1 Tbl flour over blueberries , put half the batter in the pan, the layer of blueberries and top with the other half of batter. Using this method the berries do not sink to the bottom. A great, great recipe and the only one I go to!

This was the first time I've ever made cornbread and chose this recipe from the high ratings. I used 1/2C sugar, which was perfect. Baked X40 minutes and worried it was overdone. Brought it to a potluck today and it was a major hit - everyone had seconds and loved it, as did I. I'll be making it again.

This was delicious. A tad too sweet for me personally so next time I will decrease the sugar. I am for medical reasons gluten free, so I substituted Bob's Red Mill One for One GF flour substitute and no one knew it was gluten free. Look no further for your next. Yankee style cornbread recipe. Thanks for sharing!!

Just pulled mine out of the oven and I really like how light and lightly sweet it is. It is exactly what I had hoped for. I made it to ultimately try out a wild mushroom stuffing recipe, but will have some in the am for breakfast. My substitutions were minor compared to other reviews: I didn't have baking soda - I misread the recipe and bought baking powder, so substituted 1/2 tea. baking soda for 1&1/2 tea baking powder, and omitted the salt. I also didn't have fresh buttermilk, but since I don't drink it, I saved my last container by pouring it in plastic containers and freezing. I only had a half pint, so defrosted that and used it. No water, no milk, no lemon...

I was skeptical because the recipe calls for sugar, and over all is *very* different than what I grew up with. Wow! A hit with even the pickiest at the table. We liked that it was thick but with a buttery denseness, and not like cake. Delicious - made last Sunday, and making again tonight :)

I used whole wheat flour in place of white flour and used whole milk with 1tablespoon vinegar in place of buttermilk. Very good

This is a really good recipe. Unfortunately, I didn't have buttermilk and had to substitute lemon in milk, but it was still good. I was looking for a recipe last minute and didn't have time to go to the store. Next time I will try the recipe as written.

I really liked this recipe but I think next time I will cut the sugar and add a tiny bit more salt.  I put jalapeños and some shredded cheddar in one batch and it was just as good.  Great recipe "as is" or as a base to start from to try other variations of cornbread.

I made it for my Bible study pot luck and everyone complimented it.  This was my first time making cornbread; thanks for helping me make it a success!  BTW, I made it exactly as written and made my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar rather than store bought.

Amazing, great corn taste and not dry. My extended family requests this for all our get togethers. I add a teaspoon of vanilla to mine...because I usually sneak vanilla into most of my baked stuff. This is easy and my go to.

This is "my dish" now. People always ask me to bring cornbread now, and they have no idea how easy it is! The only time it didn't turn out amazing was when I used butter from the USA... Go Canadian butter!

This is THE BEST CORNBREAD!!
Seriously, I have been making this recipe for a few years now and am ALWAYS asked for the recipe as my guests say it's the best cornbread they've ever had. I even made it once while in the south visiting a friend, they went crazy over it!  Thank you for sharing this recipe, people now think I am a really good cook!  Trying it today using gluten-free flour, we have a family reunion tomorrow and have a few special diets to accommodate.

Followed the recipe as is except I used whole wheat flour (needed to use it up).  Had to bake for 45 minutes at 375.  Came out great!

I followed this recipe as written but made the Buttermilk with 1T white vinegar to one cup milk.  Very good and not too hard to make.  Didn't seem too sweet to me at all. Baked for exactly 30 minutes in a 9 x9 dish. Moist. Not dry at all. Thank you.

I just made this for the first time.  I usually do the Jiffy box but decided to try this.  I read the other reviews and agree that I will not look any further for a new recipe - - this is it.   Followed the recipe, made my own buttermilk with vinegar, and cooked it in my black iron skillet that I heated on top of the stove before placing the batter in.  Cooked in a convection oven at 375 for 20 min, lowered temperature to 350 for 10 more minutes and it was perfect.  Try this one it was worth the different steps.

I made this and followed the recipe except I used 1/3 cup of sugar instead. Glad I did. It was sweet enough.  This is the best corn bread I have ever made. I had two iron skillets. One for cornbread sticks and a smaller 6 inch skillet for cake. It took 30 minutes for the sticks and about 35 to 37 minutes for the cake.  They both came out perfect.

This is an excellent recipe that's really good. I took others suggestions and used less sugar (1/3 cup) but other that that I stick to the recipe. Sure beats jiffy boxed corn bread, and it only takes a couple minutes more to prepare. Try it, you'll like it too!

This is the best cornbread I have ever had. I did increase the cornmeal to 1 1/4 c and decrease flour to 3/4 c as I prefer a less cake-like cornbread. If I could give this cornbread more stars, I would. I can't make enough of this, it is gone in one sitting.

I use 1/2 cup of grape seed oil instead of 1/2 cup of butter. The taste is much better. I tried with butter - the cornbread is too dry, with olive oil - it's sort of heavy and the color of the cornbread was greenish, but with grape seed oil it's moist and just delicious. I will continue using this recipie, it's the best!

Not too crumbly, not too sweet, really fast to make the batter. I took the advice of another reviewer and baked it in a pre-heated 9" cat iron skillet which made the bottom a tad crispy, which I like. This is my go-to for cornbread.

Quick and easy and just right.  I know that some people think that sugar doesn't belong in cornbread, but the amount in this recipe is just right and doesn't make it sweet at all.  If people don't like sugar in their cornbread, then they could just use a different recipe instead of giving a poor review for this one.  I was looking for a recipe that would be moist, and that's exactly how this one came out.  Thank you, Bethany!

I just made this recipe for the second time and it was wonderful!  I received lots of praise for this both times.  I made it exactly according to the recipe, mixing it all in the pan in which I melted the butter.  As for whether it is really Southern or not,  I think it must depend on which part of the South to which we are referring.  I'm a "true Southerner" and we have always preferred our cornbread a little sweet.  I've made lots of cornbread in my life but the flavor of this recipe beats all the others!  Thanks for a great recipe!

A very good recipe for keeping. I made it with 2/3 cup corn meal and filled up to 1 cup with flaxseed meal. It turned out nice and moist and my kids loved it.

I substituted a quarter cup of Crisco for a quarter cup of butter. Used a quarter cup of butter instead of a half cup. Substituted 1% milk for buttermilk. It came out really well. My family raved about it. It tasted like cake. I'll be making this again.

It turned out great! Just like the picture! If you don't have buttermilk, a great substitute would be draining the water from regular salty yogurt, not like fruity yoplait, just regular yogurt.

I followed the recipe as is, but I did double it as I wanted to make it in my 12" cast iron skillet. I mixed and baked  it completely in the skillet and it turned out perfectly. It is just the right sweetness, just the right moistness and it was so good. Everyone loved it and I also had a bit leftover to freeze.

Baking at 7500' made me a skeptic based on other recipes.  This recipe worked great at altitude and delivered it's promise of sweet and moist.  Not sure why anyone has a problem with this recipe.

Love this recipe, I don't care weather it's southern or northern or from the bible belt, I can't stand cornbread that's not a little sweet. I substituted the one cup buttermilk for 1/2 cup buttermilk and half cup creamed corn, turned out awesome! Thanks For Sharing!

As a southern girl, I like this recipe except it is a little too sweet instead of corny. I varied and used an iron skillet. It rises nicely and has a crust.

This is the ONLY cornbread recipe I use.  My husband loves it, and has suggested that I should never experiment with any other recipes.  It has a little sweetness (but not TOO much) and that suits us just fine.  I use a Cast iron Cornbread Wedge pan and this recipe makes 12 wedges.

This is, by far, the best corn bread my family has ever had!  I got rave reviews from my dinner guests and family.   I cut the sugar in half only because of our personal tastebuds, but it's a wonderful recipe.
I love to bake; I am experienced enough to know ahead of time how hot my oven is and what would work in ingredients (to suit what we like to eat), and I compare several recipes before choosing one.   This one was as good as I hoped it would be and is a keeper!  Thank you, Bethanyweathersby, and thank you to your grandmother!!

I doubled the recipe for a 9x13 pan except the salt and the sugar (used 1 cup). Way too sweet still. Most family loved it though. All said reduce the sugar.

I give it four stars because "as is" is pretty average.  I tried a gluten free version by using oat flour (oats in a blender) in place of regular flour. That made it AMAZING. Everything else I kept the same. With the oat flour it created a sweet, slightly nutty, moist, and a lighter textured cornbread. With the regular flour it was super dense and pretty bland. Oh, and did I mention that when it bakes it creates these crispy and delicious edges that transport you to paradise?? 'Caude it does!

I find it difficult to adequately mix the ingredients in a skillet without making a mess, so microwave butter and transfer to a bowl to finish. Otherwise, I make as written. It's my go to recipe for cornbread and is good for using up buttermilk.

I have been looking for a cornbread recipe for years, so glad I finally have found it.   This recipe is on point, I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup, add fresh diced jalapeños for heat,  1/2 cup of sharp cheddar cheese.  It brings me memories of my Mom used to make. Not sure what others are complaining about, it perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

Fantastic!!  I was afraid that 2/3 cup sugar would be too sweet, so I used a little less (just didn't fill up the cup all the way).  (It would have been totally fine with the 2/3 cup!)   I made corn muffins, and they came out perfect in 22 minutes.  Super easy recipe!  Thanks so much for sharing!

I'm not a huge cornbread fan, but I love this recipe.  It's quick,  it's easy and it is awesome! I made to go with some chili and while the chili was really good, the cornbread disappeared.   I had to make two more pans!

After being dissatisfied with cornbread mixes and other cornbread  recipes, this is a winner!!  It turned out well in the end.  

I baked it in the correct size  of pan, but it was sitting on a pizza stone.  (I think that messed things up.)   I took it out after checking the center with a toothpick.  It cooled for 5 minutes.  I flipped it over and a mound of  raw batter was stuck to the center of the pan and the bottom was not done.  I took out the pizza stone, turned the oven back on,  flipped the cornbread back in the pan, and baked it for 10 more minutes.  When I flipped it over, the bottom center had fused back in and the cornbread had a perfect consistency.  It also tasted great.

This recipe was absolutely amazing! It was exactly what I was looking for in cornbread - not too sweet, not too crumbly, and deliciously dense. I didn't change anything and followed it exact. I will never make a different recipe for cornbread :)

This cake surprised me, the texture was perfect, crumbly and moist. I wanted to follow the recipe exactly but autopilot kicked in and I accidentally mixed the sugar in with the dry ingredients as I usually do, instead of into the butter.  I don't think it affected the end result at all. This is a very forgiving recipe. I baked it in a SKILLET after reading the reviews, and let me tell you, if you've never baked anything in a cast iron skillet before you gotta try it. I was so impressed, the rise was even, cook time was faster, didn't stick at all on the sides and bottom (gotta preheat it tho), such a beautiful golden browning on the sides and bottom. I am considering baking all my future cakes in cast iron now! Of course, it could also be due to the recipe that the cake turned out so well. 
I used medium grind cornmeal (Bob's Red Mill) and this may have contributed to the crumbliness. My Guess is a fine grind cornmeal will yield a denser, more pound cake like texture.
I also didn't have all purpose flour on hand and substituted half cup organic whole wheat flour and half cup cake flour.
I melted my butter in the microwave in the bowl I used to mix all the wet ingredients in. Less washing up.
And by the way 375F translates to 190C, not 175 as stated on the website.

This recipe is great!  I make it all the time; it is my go-to cornbread!  I did, however, make one change...by accident at first, but then thought it turned out so great that I permanently amended it.  I used two sticks of butter instead of one.  When I first made the recipe, I misread it as one cup of butter instead of a half cup.  I thought it was buttery, moist and delicious!  On a later date, I made the recipe correctly, and I felt I was missing the moist consistency of the first.  When I make it the original way, it needs a bit of butter when slicing and serving; when I make it with the extra stick of butter, it needs no extra when serving.  I think it just comes down to personal preference and whether you prefer it more crumbly (and probably more true to its origin....hence the one stick of butter in the original recipe) or more moist and cake-like.  Either way, this is a keeper!

This is a northern styed cornbread with sugar, just the way I like it.  Very moist and slightly sweet.  I do, however, reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup for 2/3 cup makes it a little too sweet for me.

It was good and cooked well however I don't think it tasted as 'corny' as I'd like if that makes sense and it was slightly dry. Next time I plan to add a can of white corn kernels to the batter so that you get that extra corn flavor as well as some sweetness to complement it.

I made just as written. Although it is very good cornbread I prefer a less sweet cornbread. If I make again I will reduce the amount of sugar.

Traveled to Santa Fe, NM, ate at "Luminaria."  They served the best (blue) cornmeal muffins I've ever had.  Have been searching for a copycat-type recipe ever since.  Found this recipe with such great comments, so I made this using my blue cornmeal instead of yellow and baked it in a greased, hot, iron skillet.  This is every bit as good as the muffins I had in Santa Fe.

Delicious! I also mixed the whole recipe in a large saucepan, and it cut down on dishes. Doubled the recipe and used a 9x13 lined with parchment. This will be a staple recipe from now on, I haven't found one this moist or sweet until now!

Love,love,love. The only change that I made is the amount of sugar. I only put one third cup. But this is by far the easiest and best cornbread I have tasted. Also I used one pot to do. All the original mixing. Thank you.

This is my go-to cornbread recipe.  I've easily made it a dozen times over the years & it's always a winner.  I catered a rehearsal  dinner, Southern BBQ theme & made this.  It was devoured & several people asked for the recipe.  I don't mix it in the skilled.  I just melt butter in the microwave & then mix in a bowl.  I have done it in pre-heated cast iron & it does give a great crust to the bread!  But normally I just do it in the square pan.  That's it for tweaks.  Perfect as is.

I like to find a basic recipe that fits what I like and make a few adjustments if needed.  I didn't have the buttermilk so used a combination of mexican sour cream and cottage cheese.  I added 1/4 cup + of grated sharp cheddar and used polenta cut cornmeal so it was a little crunchy.  Served it with a bit of butter (just like I always do) and had it with a great mexican meal of black beans and corn.  Yes!  Sufina

Made 2 batches and both were delicious.  Changed one batch a little.  Instead of all butter, did half margarine and half soy oil, also added cheese and jalapenos to that batch and it was good.  Both were light and airy and everyone kept going back for more. Will definitely make again.

My daughter loves sweet corn bread and is very picky, this was perfect.  Cooked it in my 10 inch cast iron skillet and heated the skillet and melted butter in the pan before I pored in the bater to get a nice crunchy crust - served with honey butter.

This one is my go to; I've made it many times. I used this recipe for a BBQ our private club had,  and it was devoured.  I never buy buttermilk, so I just sour the milk  and it's just as moist and delicious.

I made this recipe as muffins. It was the best cornbread muffins I have ever had. I cut the time by about five minutes because appeared done. That was the best decision I could have made. They were extremely moist. This is going to be my go to recipe when I'm ready for cornbread again.

Add a little paprika and some jalapeños if you like spice. All you bakers out there need an oven thermometer because chances are it is not telling you true temp. Perfect recipe!

This is the cornbread I've been trying to re-create for years.  It is so moist and lightly sweetened the way I love.  Thx for sharing!

My go-to recipe. I use some brown sugar instead of all white and reduce sugar when I make for stuffing. Soooooo good.

Made this recipe exactly as noted, except I doubled it for a gathering. It baked for just 30 minutes, and came out perfectly moist and delicious.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I made slight changes, one being that I cut the sugar by 1/3 as not everyone in my family likes sweet cornbread and also I made it in a cast iron skillet. It came out more cake like and not so dense but it was moist, with just a slight touch of sweetness. I will definitely use this as my go to recipe as I can adjust the sweetness or omit it if I want. For those of you who do not use buttermilk often, consider buttermilk powder it lasts a long time in the refrigerator.

This was absolutely the best cornbread I have ever made.  I made it exactly as written without any changes.  My husband even said I outdid myself with this one, which says a lot because he is very picky.  I think using the buttermilk is the trick because the other recipes I have tried did not use it and it always came out dry.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.  I have thrown out all of my other cornbread recipes.

This was highly satisfying cornbread. I followed the notes the original poster put up  - the only change I made was cutting the sugar in half. The flavor was great, not too sweet. I will definitely be making this cornbread again.

I was very glad and surprised that it was not sweeter. Where I live in the south, cornbread is not sweet.
As another review suggested, I made muffins. I like to do this, put each in a ziplock snack bag, then put them in a larger bag and freeze. I then can take out the amount I need and warm them slightly in the microwave.
The reason that i didn't rate it higher is that mine turned out kind of dry.
I make another recipe this way and they are not dry. Maybe a little more buttermilk was needed!

I made this cornbread.  It was very easy.  Quicker than a box...almost.  The only change I made was that I didn't have buttermilk so I used my milk with 1T of vinegar as a substitute.
I may have baked it a little long.  I made it in my cast iron skillet.
Overall it wasn't bad.  Might try it again only bake it for 20 min.

I happen to like sweet cornbread and this one was great! I did however tweak it  to my situation: I rarely use buttermilk - don't judge me - so I used sour milk (half a squeezed lemon per cup of milk).  Also, hot butter in a pan with beaten eggs means scrambled to me, so I used a glass bowl to melt the butter then did the rest exactly according to the recipe. I began checking for done-ness at about 20 minutes and it only cooked it for about 23 minutes. Thank you Bethany it was perfect!

The cornbread was very delicious!  When I took mine out of the oven it was much lighter in color then I thought it would be.  Make sure you serve this warm.  Mine only kept for a few days.  I would definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe exactly.  It baked beautifully - nice and high, moist, good texture.  However, it's just a little too sweet for me.  May try and cut back a little on the sugar but not sure what it might do to the balance of the recipe overall

I use a can of creamed corn instead of the sugar. You can strain the corn out is you don't like the corn-bits but I think it adds something to the overall results. Good stuff when camping and cooked over an open fire in an iron dutch oven. Great in muffin form as well

I've made this 10+ times. Comes out perfect every time.  Today I substituted gluten-free flour and it was just as good.   Kids can't stop eating it and have no idea it's gluten-free.

My daughter needed this for her social studies class. It was perfect. Didn't have any buttermilk, so just used 2/3 cup yoghurt with enough milk to make it the consistency of buttermilk. It was really delicious.

I think this is a wonderful cornbread. I made it just as you do - all in a pot, then into a baking dish for the oven - SMART!

Made it twice now and it comes out a charm - super easy recipe with little room for error, and my whole family loves it! Second time I sprinkled chocolate into the mix and it was very tasty. I love the texture the cornflour gives. I didn't have buttermilk but used the juice of about half a lemon mixed in with milk  and left to sit 5 minutes, and the recipe works fine with that. Highly recommend this recipe!

Really good.  My gluten-free sister in law is living with us currently.  I made it with all-purpose flour and it was delicious.  She made a batch with bob mills all-purpose gluten-free flour  and a pinch of xanthum gum and it was also really good.  In fact, I wouldn't have known a difference if I hadn't tried them side by side.

This is THEE BEST cornbread EVER!!! I have looked and looked for one similar to "Famous Dave's" cornbread... this pretty much fits the bill! Moist and sweet!! Next time I may try and add 1/4 C or so of whole kernel corn... we'll see. Otherwise, PERFECT!!! Fresh out of the oven with butter melted on it.... yummmmm!!!

First of all I'm in Australia and couldn't find cornmeal, it's just not something available here. I ended up using polenta and used a blender to make it a bit finer. It turned out amazing! I was blown away at how yummy it was. My husband is Canadian and has wanted to make this cornbread recipe for a long time. We tried another recipe a few years back and I wasn't impressed. This recipe is something else though! I wish we tried this recipe sooner. It's so lovely! I'm on the hunt for recipes that we can have this cornbread with. There's a reason this recipe has over 4000 reviews and such a good rating. It's perfection in my mouth.

Love this recipe, with changes. I always cut the sugar at least in half (and sometimes use honey or brown sugar),  often use half white and half whole wheat flour, and soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk for about twenty minutes if I'm using a coarser cornmeal. I throw the butter in the pan and put it in the oven to melt to start (saves greasing the pan). Instead of buttermilk, I replace a tablespoon of milk with a tablespoon of white vinegar, stir well, and let sit for ten minutes.

I've also scaled it up to 14 servings (from its current nine), poured it in a jelly roll pan, and baked it for 22 minutes to make bite size servings for a chili cook off, and it worked great.

I have tired other recipes and this is my favourite.  It has more butter and an extra egg and the prefect amount of sugar.  I hate dry bland tasting corn bread.  I served this hot out of the oven with chilli.  My guests couldn't get enough of the corn bread.  This will be my go to "corn bread" recipe from now on.

I doubled the recipe and made it in a 9x13 pan. I completely omitted the sugar, but kept everything else the same. It turned out nice and golden brown. Learned the hard way not to take it out of the oven and immediately try to slice it, it fell apart  :) so note to self- let it cool  a little while!

I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and substituted 1/2 cup whole wheat flour for half of the white flour. I also baked the batter in my trusty 10 inch cast iron skillet and was careful not to overbake. It was moist and delicious--not dry and bland like many other cornbread recipes I've made. When I make it again, I may cut the sugar down to 1/3 cup, because 1/2 cup was plenty sweet for me. Best cornbread recipe I've made, and thanks to everyone's suggestions!

Absolutely delicious.  Only change I made was to reduce sugar by half.  Otherwise it is perfect.  Having a bowl of veggie soup with it right now and getting ready to make another pan.  This is now my cornbread recipe forever!

I doubled the recipe in a 9x13 stoneware and baked for 35 minutes and came out perfect. Wouldn't change a thing. I plan on freezing half of it. I only had 1 1/2 sticks butter and use 1/4 c margarine and worked fine.

I could never replicate my Grandmother's cornbread so when a friend made this I was in HEAVEN! When I made it I just sifted all the dry ingredients together (like my friend did) then added the wet ingredients. Next time I will follow the recipe and see if it comes out different. Thank you -- either way it takes me back to my childhood. Grandmother would have approved!

The flavor was great but my bread turned out very dense. I had to cook it 10 minutes longer than the recipe said because it was still doughy at the bottom. However, my guests loved the cornbread!

As a Southerner mama taught me it's bad manners to criticize a recipe GIVEN to you even if it's not for you. She also said that it's an insult to tell the giver of the recipe how you changed it to make it better. Unless asked to, keep it to yourself & be gracious. If you don't like it say thank you & be on your way.  If you LOVE it tell the chef why and thank him or her.  I have never heard Southerners protest that something was TOO sweet unless they were describing grandma herself.  As in "Grandma is being way too sweet, what's up with that?"

Nice that allrecipes is asking us to rate it and how we might change it. It's probably more than Grandma would do.

I loved everything about it. Thank you!

Excellent.  Follow directions.  Perfectly delicious.  Made in Lodge cast iron skillet.   You don't even have to butter it.   I took a spoonful of butter and smeared overthrow top and let melt down edge of pan.   FYI if u don't have buttermilk add a tsp vinegar to milk and let set 5 min

Super easy. Added all wet ingredients to dry, stirred, then added eggs. Made 6 large muffins. Greased pan with butter and came out perfectly. Glad I didn't use liners. Was a tad sweet. Maybe back off on the sugar next time.

I usually make the cornbread from the box, but this recipe is now the only corn bread I make. It is delicious. I had a couple issues with it being too crumbly, but that was because of my oven, I have to leave mine in an extra 5-7 minutes. Great recipe, Thanks for sharing.

SO YUMMY! I haven't made cornbread in awhile, but this is some of the best I can remember tasting. I made the whole thing in a single cast iron skillet, from melting the butter to baking the batter. I will be making this again!

Great crumb, very moist. Too sweet for us by far but cutting sugar by 1/2 made it about perfect. We always preheat the cast iron skillet with the butter and mix the ingredients in a separate bowl, adding the butter at the end, mixing and returning to the hot skillet quickly. This GA bred, TN raised SOUTHERN girl approves.

Awesome cornbread!!!!! This is my permanent chili companion. I also love the easy clean up as you can mix all the ingredients in one pot before transferring it to a baking dish. I use salted butter so I don't add any additional salt. Check it after 20-minutes to avoid overbaking/dryness!!! Then check at 5-min increments until a toothpick in the center comes out clean. You won't find a better or tastier cornbread recipe.

great recipe and just as fast as the pre-made packages. For a twist,  I made the whole thing from step 1 in a cast iron skillet and stirred in frozen corn kernels then drizzled some honey over it before going into the oven.

This is the ONLY recipe I use. I make it all in one bowl, starting with melting the butter in a large glass bowl and then following the rest of the directions. I have even made it with only 1/3 cup sugar (by mistake) with great results.

Great cornbread recipe.  Not too dry, not too dense. Great flavor. Very easy and way better than the boxed mixes. Works best with actual buttermilk. Not a fan of substituting lemon/vinegar + milk in a pinch. I think this recipe is worth keeping buttermilk on hand for.

Very good!  I didn't have a 9x9 pan so just made it all in my cast iron pan.  Baked for 24 minutes and it was good but I'd try 22 or so next time.  Served with chili. Yum!

This recipe makes a delicious cornbread - moist and a little sweet.  I just made a couple of small changes.  I doubled the recipe and used 1 c sugar and 1/3 c honey; I also used the powdered buttermilk mixed with water as others suggested.  I microwaved the butter in a large bowl and then added the ingredients to that bowl.  I baked it in a 13x9" pan for about 30 minutes.

Love this recipe (and I've tried many), though I never quite make it the same twice. Recently, I substituted half the all purpose flour with corn flour and it was so much more flavorful. Next time I will try just corn flour instead of all purpose. I also prefer to make them as muffins (without paper cups) because then you get more of the lovely crunchy exterior and they reheat lovely individually in the oven. I line the muffin pan with Crisco and cook at 350 (convection) for 20 minutes. One recipe makes one dozen full size muffins, sometimes I stretch it to 18 muffins to make them a little smaller.
I've also tried adding a can or corn, but I find that all the moisture gets sucked out of the corn into the batter and you're left with small chewy bits rather than nice plump corn.

Really good ! Moist and tasty. Found it a little too sweet though.  I will try and cut back on the sugar next time.  We are having a Chili Party at the end of February outdoors in the snow and I will be making a double pan of this.  It will be wonderful with the chili.

I confess to a bit of a sweet tooth so I like my cornbread sweeter than not. A cast iron skillet in the oven while it heats up makes for a wonderfully crispy edge. The batter should sizzle a little when you pour it in the skillet.  Turn the skillet over when it has cooled a bit after cooking and the bread just falls out. Thirty minutes was the perfect cooking time! Really delicious with no tweaks.

This recipe is an excellent base to a tasty cornbread. I followed the recipe exactly and it was good but a bit rich for my liking. I will definitely use less than a 1/2  cup of butter and use a 1/4 cup of sugar. Otherwise it was a very good recipe.

Way too much sugar in this recipe.  This is supposed to be cornbread, not pound cake. Cut the sugar  to perhaps a tablespoon at most otherwise serve it for dessert.

Wonderful recipe! Moist, super buttery, and delicious. 
I followed the recipe exactly and also added some corn kernels, as my family likes corn in their corn bread.  I only had a 9x9  baking dish, I baked it for 30 mins and  it came out beautifully! 
Next time I will add a pinch more salt or use salted butter to help bring out the flavors a bit more. Otherwise it was perfect. I will be making this one again. Maybe even tomorrow.

Absolutely delicious! 
If serving with real maple syrup cut down on the sugar.

Great recipe and easy to make. Used a cast iron skillet like many people suggested and halved the amount of sugar and it turned out wonderfully. Doubt I'll be going back to making cornbread from a boxed mix ever again.

Followed the recipe only used splenda instead of sugar.  Melted butter in cast iron 9" pan, then added the batter.  REALLY stuck to the bottom of the pan.

This is a great cornbread.  It is light but dense which made it the perfect base for an old-fashioned beans and cornbread dish.
Thanks for the recipe, Bethany.

Best cornbread recipe ever!  I followed the directions, but instead of buttermilk, I used 3/4 C yogurt and 1/4 C milk stirred together until it was the same the consistency of buttermilk.

I'm a New Englander, so I guess I'm genetically predisposed to like my cornbread a little sweet. That said, I cut the sugar a little by keeping it at 2/3 cup while increasing all other ingredients by a half. I increased the recipe because I decided to bake it in my 10" cast iron skillet. I pre melted 2 TBSP of butter in the skillet and made sure to cover the sides. I'm glad I kept a close eye on it because it was done baking at about the 25 minute mark. This is THE BEST cornbread I ever made. Next time I might decrease the sugar even slightly more. It's by no means too sweet, but whenever I can cut sugar without compromising taste, I'll do it.

I used half the sugar (used stevia) and  it was  plenty sweet.   The butter made this an exceptional cornbread.  I heated the butter in the  skillet until it was sizzling before stirring in the batter, which created a wonderfully crispy, crunchy crust and the inside stayed moist and tender.

I like a slightly sweet cornbread and this recipe was awesome.  It still has a nice cornbread mouth feel, I don't like my cornbread too sweet or too cake like.

This was very easy to make! I like sweet cornbread and this was very good and moist with just the right amount of sweetness.  I didn't have butter so I used margarine instead and bake it for 30 min. Will make it again!

I made this recipe exactly as written and it turned out perfect! I would definitely make it again and not change a thing. The bread was moist with a perfect consistency. The level of sweet was just right. I prefer my cornbread to be sweet anyway. I hope I never  have to eat cornbread in the south if there's no sugar in it! :P

Made this for dinner tonight.  Everyone LOVED it.  Since I didn't have any buttermilk, I substituted milk with lemon juice.  Baked it in l preheated, buttered iron skillet. Liked how the pieces of this cornbread held together.  It  was so moist, texture was wonderful and fell apart once in your mouth.  No butter needed.  Good bye Jiffy.
Thank you for sharing.  This recipe in a keeper!

I was not sure how this was going to turn out as I have never made corn bread before but I follwed the recipe as is and it turned out great! I do not own a cast iron skillet so I just mixed everything in a bowl and put in my baking pan. Only thing I may adjust for next time is my cooking time by about 5 minutes, put it in for 20 but top was a little harder than I wanted!! Otherwise, super good!!!

This was a great recipe - sweet but not too sweet and very moist.  I think the order of ingredients was a little strange.  I like the idea of combining the melted butter and sugar together, which cools down the melted butter.  But otherwise, I combined all the dry ingredients in a bowl, then added all the wet ingredients (after butter cooled a little) and stirred.  VERY easy and really delicious!

I made this for my family for New Year's day, and everyone loved it. I multiplied the recipe by 1-1/2 and got 16 servings. I baked mine in a HOT, oiled 10" cast iron skillet for 22 minutes. Do NOT overbake! Keep an eye on it for the last couple of minutes.

3/4 cup butter
1 cup sugar
3 eggs
1-1/2 cups buttermilk
3/4 teaspoon baking soda
1-1/2 cups cornmeal
1-1/2 cups all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt

Unbelievably delicious!  I would cut back a bit on the sugar- not because it's too sweet, but just to help with the waist line going forward :) Also, add 1 cup of cooked corn - Amazing. It was pretty much gone between the three of us straight out of the oven.

I thought this was a wonderful cornbread! I took one reviewers suggestion and baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet. I followed the recipe exactly as written. Perfection! Served it with texas chili and it was just fabulous. Thanks for sharing!

Baked it for 30 minutes in a heavy duty metal 8x8 pan. I used whole wheat flour.  It's perfect!  I love that it all got mixed up in the pot, so I didn't have a mixing bowl to wash...  I mixed up some honey & butter to slather on.

Easy and delicious! I made this exactly as written, didn't add a thing. It is a sweet cornbread but not too sweet. It pairs well with soups, stews or a country dinner. I melted the butter in a pan then just dumped in all the ingredients and stirred. Really no need to separate this and that just dump it all in together! Also keep an eye on them while baking, depending on your pan they could be done much sooner than you think. Going into the "favorites" folder for sure!

I substituted gluten-free flour and reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup to use this bath for southern cornbread dressing. Celiac and diabetic friendly version. Even the picky family members are raving.

I made this with gluten-free flour and I had to make 3 more batches over the holidays because it was everyone's favorite food!!  Incredibly moist.  Also I mixed the ingredients right in the cast iron pan that I then cooked it in.  Worked fine.

I really like this recipe! I followed it to a T and it came out great. I did however cut back on the sugar, only adding about 3/4 of what the recipe calls for. I love the texture and moisture. It doesn't leave your mouth dry like many others. Some like that but I prefer a soft texture. However, one time I made these they came out too soft, almost mushy. I did add a bit more buttermilk just to finish off the bottle, but I wouldn't think it was enough to completely change the texture. But maybe, because every other time I've made it without any additions, it came out great!

This is my fiancee's favourite version of cornbread. Whenever she gets a craving, this is what I make. As to baking tips, I saw the author post about the cooking time. The easiest way to judge is to watch the top. It shouldn't get overly dark. If it does, it will be dry and a little burnt. You want it to just start to darken, and for a toothpick stuck in the middle to come out clean.

I am from the Deep South.  Some put sugar in their cornbread - some don't.  I've eaten it both ways at all my relatives' houses.  This recipe is super yummy and I just love it!  It's a great compliment to my vinegar based BBQ sauce/meat and my savory cornbread.  I love eating it both ways :)

This is now my go to recipe for cornbread. The ONLY thing I've changed is that I use 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white. And it makes a GREAT stuffing.

I decided to try and make my wife cornbread again.  I tried once before years ago and failed miserably. Not this time. This recipe was easy to follow and it is delicious. I've saved this as one of my favorites and have been crowned best cornbread maker by my kids.

Very good!  I used my new silicone bakeware making this cornbread today, including the 8" pan.  I didn't use cooking spray and the bread came out of the pan perfectly.  I would say mine turned out a teeny bit dry, so I'll need to continue experimenting with the silicone bakeware, and adjust the baking time a bit (took it out at 30 mins).  I would recommend to other bakers to have all ingredients measured and ready to use as the mixing goes very quickly once the butter is melted.

I made it! Using your tips on mixing all in the same reg pot and 30 minute bake time made the experience quite lovely! I especially liked using alum foil as a 8" pan.  Thank you!

I made this recipe as directed except I added some corn to the batter.  I decided to make them into muffins instead and it made 12.  I baked them for approx. 25 minutes.  Very good!

I am not a fan of cornbread because it is generally dry, however I loved this recipe and will definitely make it again. The only change I made was I used regular milk instead of buttermilk. It was super moist and was great with beans and in my stuffing!

Excellent cornbread!! I just baked it in the iron skillet that I mixed it in and it turned out great.  I did reduce the baking time to 25 min though.  Love the recipe and will definitely be making it in the future.

The only thing I did different was use regular milk because I didn't have buttermilk on hand.   I made this at altitude (8100 ft) with no problem at all. Great flavor, I did not think it was too sweet, and my husband loved it! will make this again! Definitely going in my cookbook!

This was PERFECT!  Not too sweet, very moist and delicious. I made buttermilk substitute with one Tbsp. Vinegar and enough milk to make one cup total.  Cooked for 30 minutes.

Luv this recipe!!! I made this recipe and another recipe using creamed corn . I cooked the muffins 1 day prior to thanksgiving so I was looking for a moist recipe. Happy to say this recipe worked the best. Cornbread was firm, moist, and not greasy like the one made with creamed corn. Very tasty :)

No changes to the recipe ingredients...keep it exactly as is. They're delicious!!!
I made them as muffins. Spray muffin tins. Fill each tin with 1/4 cup of batter.  Bake at 375 for 15-20 min. or until toothpick comes clean. Makes 12 muffins

Last minute chili for dinner...what to have with it? Saw this recipe with 5 stars and went for it. So glad I did. I baked about 25 min when toothpick came out clean. I might add 3-5 min but hubby said not to change anything. That's good enough for me. Oh, yeah, I liked it too. It's a winner.

I made this exactly as they recommended the only mistake I made was adding the baking soda to the flour mixture and then adding it in the wet mixture but everything else is the same. I was worried it might not turn out right but it tasted great.

Did everything in the recipe except for the buttermilk which I didn't have. I made my own by mixing 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 1/2 cup water and 1 tbsp vinegar; let stand for 5 minutes. Mixed everything in one pot where the butter was melted and poured in a square pan. It turned out perfect after 30 minutes. I didn't even test for doneness, I just grabbed it out of the oven and served on the table. It was good! The kids liked it a lot.

Best cornbread recipe I've ever made. I make this on Thanksgiving and Christmas every year and my fiance's family loves it. I always mix the batter in a cast iron skillet and then put the whole skillet in the oven, instead of using a separate baking dish. I learned to bake breads in cast iron from my Irish grandfather - that's how we made Irish soda bread - and I love the extra flavor the cast iron imbues into the bread.

Just made this tonight for Thanksgiving tomorrow. I followed the recipe but doubled it. I used a toaster oven to bake it, so it took a little longer to cook because the middle part was still uncooked. Took about 50min to bake. The sides and top part came out crunchy and the inside was still moist. Love this recipe and will be using it from now on!!

I did it exactly how the recipe said and it turned out delicious. Well, actually instead of putting in a square pan I put the batter in mini muffin pan and baked for only 10 minutes. They came out moist and yummy!

Made it in a cast-iron skillet. Only need to cook for 25 min. Also, didn't have buttermilk, but used whole milk and it was still great! May cut down on the sugar a bit next time.

This was O.K. I would use 1 large egg, or 2 SMALL eggs,  because mine came out quite eggy. If you are looking for a better crust, because this doesn't have a skillet, spray cooking spray into it (lots) and put that in the oven for 2min. Then pore in your batter and a nice crust will come out

Oh my... my boyfriend (a foodie) said it was best cornbread ever.  I used Schoch's (Salinas, CA) non-homogenized, non-pasteurized yogurt instead of buttermilk, and red floriani flint corn polenta from Coke Farm (San Juan Bautista, CA) instead of regular cornmeal.    I also halved the sugar because we don't like ours real sweet.  Plus, I placed the batter into a hot buttered iron skillet to bake instead of square pan.  (Be sure to butter sides of pan too!)  Brown and crispy bottom; textured but not crumbly body.  Can't wait to make again!

Best cornbread I have made yet. I subbed half the white sugar with dark brown sugar because I ran out of white sugar. It's sweeter than most would probably like, but I love it. Very moist. Served with the Lentil Soup Recipe on allrecipes.com. Next time I will fry up some onions and garlic and put it in the batter.

The most beautiful and moist cornbread I have ever made. Followed the directions as written. The next time I will make a few changes. It was a little sweet so I'll cut the sugar down by 1/3. My next time around I'll add about 1/3 cup of canned or thawed frozend corn.

I love the way the bread browed on top beautifully and no cracks. This was an easy recipe that I will make often, especially with this being soup, stew and chili season.

PERFECT! Tasty, moist, and easy.  Then only additions I made were 1 heaping spoon of sour cream and 4 heaping spoons of some left-over black beans and corn.  The bread was so good, it would have still been PERFECT without my additions.

I modified: Used 1 cup butter (by accident the first time, but it came out so good, I just kept making it that way!) and used heavy cream instead of buttermilk. Everyone absolutely raved about it!

Simple and outstanding.
I added a few things for variation:
Try sharp cheddar or crushed chillies for a change in flavor.
For a sweeter version, toss in some blueberries and semi sweet chocolate chips. Awesome.

This has become my go-to cornbread recipe. It always turns out perfectly and is enjoyed by all.  The buttermilk makes all the difference.

Depending on what I'm serving the cornbread with, I sometimes add an extra ingredient, such as a can of whole kernel corn (expect extra baking time if you do this) or some sliced pickled jalapenos across the top.

I'm on a fixed income and cannot afford to risk wasting ingredients. So I changed the assembly technique somewhat and reduced the sugar to 1/2 a cup, because I don't like real sweet cornbread. Here's what I did: melted the butter in a cast iron skillet, then added the sugar as directed. In a mixing bowl, I whisked together the eggs, added the buttermilk, baking soda and salt and whisked those together. Then I folded in the cornmeal and flour.  To that I then poured the butter / sugar mixture and folded that into the batter.  Poured all of that back into the skillet and baked in the 375 degree preheated oven for 30 minutes;  perfect. I just knew that I'd get scrambled eggs if I had tried to whisk those eggs into the hot butter sugar mixture, even though that mixture was 'off' the heat. In spite of those minor changes, I gave this five stars for the end result, 'cause I don't think my changes made that much difference. Best cornbread I've EVER had and I'm 60+ y/o.

I made sure I read some reviews before cooking it and I'm glad I read some of the original posters feedback and how they set the time for 30 minutes, not 40.  Mine took about 33 minutes and it came out perfect.  It got gobbled up with our Cincinnati Chili.

Amazing, moist cornbread. I had never been a fan of cornbread until this recipe - maybe I'd been eating Southern cornbread all this time. I followed the recipe exactly as written. It is moist with just the right amount of sweetness. I baked for 30 minutes in glass dish and it was perfect! My girls could not get enough of it and they're very picky eaters.

I made these for a chili cook-off/potluck so cooked them in a mini muffin tin for ease of serving. I put the timer on for 20 min then got busy with something else and missed the timer.  So the overcooked. BUT they were still fairly moist and light and delicious. In fact I had to surrender my last one to a 3yo who was sad because all the "cupcakes" were gone. I have a new cornbread recipe.

Okay, I've made this a couple more times, keeping an eye on the time. They are amazing!

The most amazing cornbread I have ever tasted! I followed the recipe exactly and wouldn't make any changes. This goes perfectly with turkey chili on a cold day!

Made this for the first time and took it to a Cornbread and Chili Cook-off.  I won 3rd place!  I made it exactly as recommended.  It rose well and was moist and had a delicious flavor.

I made this recipe and it's fantastic. I made a small change with the sugar and I cut down the sugar to a 1/3, and I added a small can of diced chili. My family just couldn't eat enough of it.

It was perfect. I used self rising corn meal, butter, sugar, egg, and buttermilk. It doesn't take long to leave my pan.

I made a gluten free version. I substituted 1/2 cup of coconut flour, and 1/2 cup of rice blend flour, with a table spoon of xanthan gum, in place of the wheat flour.  It was excellent!  I also substituted coconut oil for the butter because it was what I had available.

As suggested,  I doubled the recipe and got 18 cupcakes and an 8x8 pan of cornbread goodness.  I used grits so I lowered baking temp to 360° for 25 mins on cupcakes and 40 for glass pan.  A bit sweet even with 1 total cup of sugar, but not desserty.

J'adore this Yankee cornbread. I cut the sugar down to 1/3c and make it as is. 30 minutes in the oven and it's so tender and delicious that I eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

Oh my GOODNESS!! Words fail me for this recipe. I have to make it so often for my husband that I've memorized it now! Sometimes I add fresh blueberries, sometimes I add raisins: I've even added 3 overripe mashed bananas to it to make it into banana cornbread! Of course, it is magnificent as is, with butter?? This is a winner!!!!??

I doubled the recipe and this turned out fabulous. This recipe is a keeper. As the recipe submitter suggested, I made this in the 1 pot - no need to mix up separately. We prefer this style of cornbread over the traditional southern style.

I made a total of three batches. The first batch I doubled the recipe and it beats Marie Callendars all to heck. I've had this craving for Cornbread lately (no I'm not pregnant) and I couldn't find a recipe I really liked, until now. The third batch I added roasted corn compound to the batter and omitted flour and used self rising cornmeal. By far the best recipe to date. Thank you for sharing.

This is the best cornbread I have ever made. If I could give it more stars I would!!! Other recipes have been to dry or bland. This recipe is moist and flavorful. I made it in a cast iron skillet in the oven. I did mine for 30 min. It could have even pulled it out at 25 min. Next time I'll check it at 25 min. I made mine as is. Melted the butter in a bowl in the microwave and then just kept dumping the ingredients in as suggested. Thank you Bethany for sharing your grandmothers recipe. Delicious!!!

I made it exactly as written with one exception. I used less sugar. I only filled my 2/3 measuring cup 2/3 of the way. It was the perfect amount of sweetness. I baked it in a cast iron skillet and the edges were nice and crispy. Was perfect with our lentil chilli. My husband likes it a bit sweeter, and drizzled some corn syrup on it for dessert, excellent that way too.

There are those who like sweet cornbread and those who don't. I am of the latter group. Sugar in cornbread equals cake in my opinion and should therefore be treated as such served with iceing and as dessert but, since I am in the minority as far as my faimly and friends go, I will defer to their opinions...they loved it.

Wonderful recipe!  I made several loaves for a lunch at my husband's work. The guys could not get enough. His boss took home the leftovers to share with his family.  Huge hit!

I only changed one thing,  I only added 2 tbsp. of sugar. I did that because I don't like sweet cornbread. Otherwise great recipe.

Delicious!  Very moist in the center as written. I will probably cut the butter back to 6 or 7 Tbsp. next time, and a bit less sugar too.

I really liked this recipe for cornbread. It was really moist and fluffy too.  Next time I plan to try making it with honey instead of sugar.

This is the second time I am making this cornbread, the first , I followed the recipe exactly.It was delicious and really simple to make. I made a few tweaks but only because of personal preference. I used whole wheat  flour instead of all purpose; only 1/2 cup sugar and 1 egg, added 2 tbls more buttermilk. (Did not have buttermilk so used the suggestion of another reviewer and added lemon juice to milk). Finally, I added 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper, just for a little zing.
I really like corn bread and think I finally found my go to recipe. I would certainly make again.

this recipe was easy and turned out to be everything described - moist, sweet and delicious. i went the easier route: melted butter in micro and mixed everything in the kitchen aid mixer (in the order described) and it turned out perfectly. i also threw in about 3/4 cup of steamed from-frozen corn because we really like it added. will make this anytime i have buttermilk on hand!

Best cornbread ever!

Made this with no changes. However, did not have buttermilk, instead I substituted it with whole milk and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and let it sit for about 10 mins to let it settle. 

Don't tell my mother, but this was MUCH better than the jiffy cornbread I've eaten growing up and it doesn't require any more effort.

This is by far the best recipe I have used for cornbread.  I have tried it with different types of cornmeal and have found that I get the most compliments about how moist it is when I use Goya's Masarepa.  Thank you for sharing!

Added 12/2016 Since my original post I've found out I have a gluten allergy so I've been making this same recipe while substituting GF flour and it's still the best recipe ever. Nobody can tell it's gluten free and they still ask for the recipe. Also, for the people who say it's dry they are cooking it to long. That's part of what I love about the recipe it's moist and delicious. 

Best Corn Bread Recipe ever! I've made many corn bread recipes and this was the best. Be careful not to over-cook, moist cornbread is so yummy!

I made this cornbread last minute to accompany my chili. It seriously made the meal! I will never make chili without this recipe again. My husband and I are looking forward to having it for leftovers for breakfast.

Loved this recipe! First time i tried it, it was perfect. I think the celcius conversion of the oven temperature is wrong though. Made the inside of my cornbread moist when i tried the second and third time.

So good! I melted the butter in the microwave and bypassed using a skillet altogether. I also added 2/3 cup of drained canned corn and used fat free buttermilk. It turned out delicious! Definite keeper.

I am vegan so I switched some things around. I used almond milk, egg replacer, and olive oil instead of buttermilk, eggs, and butter. I also added fresh corn and reduced the amount of sugar. The bread was a hit!

I have made this at least 30 times and NO ONE just wants one piece.  There is NEVER any left overs.
A recipe I will use for many years to come!  Amazing paired with a salty/spicy dish of any kind!

This is my family's favorite cornbread recipe. I don't change a thing. It's the perfect accompaniment to chili or barbecue or fried chicken.

Instead of the 2/3 cup of sugar I subtracted about 2 tablespoons. I used the plain milk with lemon juice trick to sub for buttermilk (never a problem before).  I used a mini muffin tin and had enough batter left for a small ramkin.  I baked at 360 (reduced heat slightly since they were mini muffins) for about 25 mins. The bottoms were over done, while the rest was ok.  After cooling, the muffins were rock hard!!!  They also had no taste!  I think I will stick to this sites "Best Corn Muffins Ever" recipe.

This recipe was awesome! It went very well with chili. My family also ate the leftover for breakfast the next day! I doubled the recipe and baked it in a glass 9 x 13 inch pan for 30 minutes... Not dry at all! This was a wonderful recipe that I will be making again soon! *Note: I am from the Northeast, and while this isn't what some call "Southern" cornbread, it was amazing!

The best. Got wonderful reviews from family and friends at dinner tonight. Did not change anything on the directions. Next time I will preheat a cast iron skillet before adding the batter. Will make again soon to use up the buttermilk from this batch!

This cornbread is more moist than most.  I don't own a cast iron skillet, so I was happy to find a recipe that turned out well in a glass casserole dish.  Turns out great if you follow the easy directions.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was the best and was devoured quickly by my family, but I thought that it was too bland. If you try making this recipe, add in some corn to make it more flavorful. If you don't have the correct pan, you can use a muffin tin instead.

It's simple,  easy to make.  Thank you. I don't usually like corn bread but I can eat this and enjoy it.   I altered the recipe to add creamed corn for additional texture and flavor.  It's amazing.  My niece thanks you also.

This is an awesome recipe. Simple to follow, and gets very consistent results. I'm not from the South so I don't have a problem with it being sweet.

I live in Saudi Arabia, so I substitute the buttermilk with what they call "Laban," a type of yogurt-like drink. I also use raw sugar in place of white sugar, but that's about it.

Holy crimeny, this recipe is good!  I made buttermilk with milk and lemon juice since I didn't have the "real deal" but beyond that, followed the recipe exactly.  Our oven runs a bit cool so it also took an extra 10 minutes to cook, but it was SO good!  Wow!  The top formed a beautiful golden crust, which was perfect, and it was the most moist cornbread I've ever had, as well as the sweetest.  I ate it without honey or even butter, even cold a day later, and it was still amazing.  This is my new "go to" cornbread recipe.  Thank you for sharing!

Just made this tonight, and wow... moist, delicious, and it baked up exactly as described by Bethany.  I did 2 things different:  I cut the sugar in half, mostly becuase I'm not a fan of really sweet things ( which is just a matter of taste)  and greased the pan with bacon grease and floured it well.  That was a tip from another reviewer... thank you for that tip!  Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly, made sure the oven was preheated, and checked it at 30 min.  I ended up leaving it in about 4 min more to brown the top a bit more, and it came out perfect.   Great combination of ingredients, and good clear instructions!

I tweaked it by frying up bacon in my cast iron skillet, used the bacon grease to grease the pan, continued on in a bowl with rest of recipe ( eliminating sugar) poured that into the skillet and baked for 45 mins.  It was great!

Confession time - I changed exactly half of the ingredients in the recipe. When I got out my cornmeal, I found that the bugs had been chomping on it. I ended up using quick grits. I then discovered I was out of buttermilk and white sugar. Sub cider vinegar + milk and honey. I then decided the chef's suggestion to sub whole wheat was a good one. Usually, I don't like to rate a recipe unless I've made it the way it was intended to be. However, I want myself to know that I liked this recipe the next time I make it! It was great! I'm sure it would be great the way it was written. I would probably cut the sugar down just a smidge, but still, fantastic.

I thought that this cornbread recipe was great.  I am a born and bred Tennessee girl and I loved this recipe!  Also, many of us "true" Southerners DO put sugar in our cornbread.  Loved this recipe!

Fantastic.  I was a little heavy handed with the flour and when all was mixed together it was a bit dryer than I thiiu it should be so I added a touch more of buttermilk and it was fine I just baked it for 35 minutes and it came out perfect.  It is absolutely delicious.

This is a great cornbread recipe. I've never had such great luck with any other recipe. Especially as written. I usually think that with my modifications it would be better. But this is perfect.

With that being said, if you plan on eating this with any sort of sweet topping, like honey butter, cut some of the sugar. It's exceptionally sweet on its own.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it turned out terrific.  Like some others, I added 1/2 of a can of cream-style corn to the listed ingredients and made it in a cast iron skillet.  Twenty-five minutes in the oven and it was moist and delicious.  Now this transplant northern girl can please my southern husband with a knock-out cornbread recipe.  Thanks for posting!

Awesome.  Didn't have buttermilk so had to do the apple cider substitution with regular milk. Made 1.5x the recipe, which was the perfect size for a 12" cast iron skillet. Served with beef stew. Win.

I loved this recipe.  I usually use the Jiffy mix but had some cornmeal in the freezer that I need to use up.  I have made other recipes and were very bland in my opinion.  This is the best recipe ever and very, very easy.

Absolutely amazing and very easy! Didn't have buttermilk on hand so I just added a splash of vinegar to the cup of milk and let sit briefly then followed recipe EXACTLY as written. You'll definitely be hooked!

I love savory more than sweet, so I use the recipe part to a T, except only 1/4 cup of sugar.  Then change up the process a bit. That's why I didn't give it a full 5. For southern style goodness, you want to use the whole stick of butter in the batter, and another 3 Tbsp in your 9" cast iron skillet. Keeps it super moist and, well, buttery! Heat up that extra bit of butter in the pan in the oven while you preheat it and mix the batter in a separate bowl, then carefully pour it into the hot, buttery skillet and bake as directed. The butter will ooze up the sides and over the top of the batter, making a beautiful crust. (If you get interrupted while mixing, though, pull out the pan so you don't scorch your butter.) Also key is the buttermilk...I don't keep that on hand, so I mix a half cup of plain full-fat ("traditional") Greek yogurt with enough whole milk (or even ranch dressing!) to make a cup, then stir in a Tbsp of lemon juice. Then, when you mix in the baking soda, it reacts and foams up really nicely, keeping the bread nice and fluffy.  t's also great with some corn or chilis or grated cheese or all of the above...just stir it into the batter before you pour it into the pan. It's dangerous to have this around the house because I find excuses to have just one more piece (warm and toasty with milk or cream soaked in for breakfast? Yes, please!) so before I know it' it's gone and I have to make more!

I've probably made this 10 times and my hubby and family love it! I follow it to a T and also mix all the ingredients in the same pot that I've melted the butter in. A couple of friends have commented its more like a cake in terms of sweetness and we do sometimes indulge in a piece after dinner like desert! We enjoy this with a spicy BBQ chicken!

This is a great recipe! The only thing is that I left it in the oven for 40 mins and the middle was kind of not done. I had to put it back in the oven for a few. Very good, not dry, and not too sweet! Yummers

My family thought this moist and sweet cornbread was delicious - certainly perfect for the taste of us northerners, but a point of confusion:  375 degrees Fahrenheit is 190 degrees Celsius.  350 is closer to 175 Celsius (it's about 176), so Bethany, what's the oven temp you actually use?

Thank you so  much for this wonderful recipe.  I only changed the recipe slightly due to allergies in our family.  My daughter is allergic to buttermilk but can have regular milk so I add lemon juice to milk and it turned out so delicious.  My family raved!

really tasty and easy recipe. had a craving for cornbread and decided to give this a try. usually i would just follow a package mix but had a pack of cornmeal on hand and wanted to try from scratch. really nice flavour and texture. usually when i've made cornbread from a mix it's really dry and doesn't have a lot of flavour. this was nice and moist but still had a bit of a crumbly texture. i admit i used less sugar as i never really had sweet cornbread before and wasn't sure and it was great. this will be my cornbread standby recipe.

EXCELLENT!  This is IT -- I love, love, love cornbread and am committing to this one forever! My regular AP flour was buggy (!) so I used my self-rising flour even though I'd already added the baking soda.  Also cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  Came out perfectly after 25 minutes in the oven, and I'm SUPER excited for this new go-to recipe!  THANK YOU for sharing this!  :)

Dense, sweet, and moist. Perfect cornbread! I just mix everything together in the cast iron skillet, to save even more dishes. Then when it's mixed, straight to the oven it goes. This cornbread is great with chili, great with fried fish, and even great with butter and honey for breakfast the next morning. A real keeper!

So good! I had chili last night for dinner and wanted to make cornbread on the side. I don't usually make sweet cornbread, but I wanted to try something new. I'm so glad I did. This wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be, which is a good thing - went really well with the spicy chili. This will be my go to recipe for cornbread from now on. Thanks!

Delicious! Typically, I'm not a cornbread fan, but this is wonderful with chili! I like adding some green chili to the batter too!

Thank you! I've been searching for a corn bread recipe without boxes or white flour in the recipe - and this was close enough!  I substituted organic corn flour for the standard white flour, and only used half the sugar (corn is naturally sweet) - it turned out wonderful - very dense, but not dry, and much more "corn-y". My sweet tooth son adds a dollop of honey to his - otherwise a pat of butter and this is corn bread heaven.

MY family LOVES this recipe the way it is!! I never change it when I want regular sweet cornbread, and this by far beats Marie Calendars!! the only time I have ever done anything extra to this recipe is to add one big can (or two little cans) of Ortega chilis to it. Comes out beautifully and the 40 minutes is a must if you add the chilis.

Good recipe, tasty cornbread. I used milk and vinegar for the buttermilk. I will do buttermilk next time because I think it will be even better. I used a casserole dish but cast iron is what I usually bake this kind of bread in. Turned out great.
2nd try: I melted the butter in my cast iron  in 375 degree oven and mixed slightly to dry ingredients, added buttermilk and the eggs so they wouldn't cook. The key is to not over mix. I spooned back into cast iron and set timer to 20 minted to continually check. I believe I have a 12" skillet. Best recipe I have found.

For those true southerners who don't put sugar in their cornbread this isn't a southern cornbread.  For those of us in the rest of the country this is the best cornbread you'll ever eat!  I changed the directions but follow the ingredient list and amounts...I soak the cornmeal in the buttermilk first, then add the butter that I melted in the microwave and the eggs. Next I mix the rest of the dry ingredients in a large bowl and then combine with the wet ingredients. I take a tablespoon of butter and put it in my iron skillet and stick it the oven to melt and heat up the pan. I pour the batter into the iron skillet and bake for about 30 minutes until the cornbread is done.  It's fabulous!

Thanks for your great recipe!!! I am making chicken chili in the crock pot for dinner tonight.  I knew I had to make this to accompany it.  I have made this once before and absolutely think it to be the best sweet cornbread recipe I have ever made!  I can't wait to eat dinner tonight!  I make it just as stated; no changes necessary!

This was a great recipe.  It came out nice and moist.  We as a family enjoy our cornbread slightly sweet like the Jiffy cornbread.  It tasted like that, but it had more moisture than the boxed version.

This is the best cornbread I've ever made. I usually melt the butter in a cast iron skillet, add everything else to it, and bake it in the oven in the skillet. I have also baked these as muffins, which have also turned out excellent. This recipe is a keeper!

My family really enjoyed this cornbread. I did reduce the sugar from 2/3 cup to 2 Tbsp. Also, I accidentally used a full tsp of baking soda this time, so it came out quite high and fluffy. This recipe is a keeper. Maybe now my hubs will buy me a cast iron skillet... ;-)

This is my go-to cornbread recipe.  I get compliments on it all the time. My one ingredient change is to drop the sugar to 1/2 c.  Mix all ingredients in a mixing bowl.  While measuring and mixing the cornbread ingredients, bring 1-2 tbs oil in a cast iron skillet to temperature in the oven. When the skillet is hot, pour in the batter and bake till golden on top.

Fantastic! I made this for a gluten sensitive group by cutting the flour and adding an extra cup of corn flour and it turned out even better than I could have hoped:thick and somewhat grainy, but still very moist and delicious. It vanished almost instantly. Thanks for the great recipe!

I've tried this recipe exactly as it calls. Its absolutely delicious, and a bit sweet. I tried it a second time modified it for lower fat/sugar:
1/2 cup sugar instead of 3/4 cup sugar.
1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup apple sauce instead of 1/2 cup butter.
It turned out great this way! Held it's consistency too. A definite winner.

This recipe was so easy to prepare and it turned out great.  I did not have any buttermilk on hand so I substituted one cup of 2% milk and added one Tablespoon of vinegar. I let that stand while I measured the other ingredients.  Many reviewers have mentioned that sugar should not be added to "real" cornbread.  I thought this had a nice sweetness. I did not add honey or butter when I ate it.  I did not think this was overly sweet. I'm happy that I tried the recipe. And I thank Bethany for sharing her grandmother's recipe.

Yum!!  Just took it out of the oven to go with a batch of chili for dinner.  I stole a few pinches off the outside crust, and it's wonderful!!  Thank you for sharing!  I heated a cast iron skillet as I was preheating my oven with a little butter in the bottom and added the batter to that to bake, and it worked beautifully!

Pretty good, but I did not follow exactly.  Only used 1/4 cup sugar, and ended up adding an extra TBS or two of buttermilk.  I'm usually one of those that says "don't rate it if you didn't make it just as is" but in this case I knew for sure that was too much sugar for my taste.  Baked at temp and time suggested in a cast iron skillet and, with the cut in sugar/slight add in buttermilk, it was alright.

Delicious! I used 1/3 cup of Splenda instead of sugar. However, I did spread honey on top before eating it. I will make it again and use 2/3 cup of Splenda for the full taste of sweetness without the honey.

Awesome! It's a keeper. Sugar could be reduced but I loved it the way it is. I used einkorn flour and finely ground corn meal.

Made the buttermilk by adding one tbsn white vinegar to one cup whole milk.  Then followed the recipe as written to great success. Served with a big pot of black eyed peas to celebrate the new year! Thanks Bethany!

This is my go-to recipe for cornbread! On cold winter days, I turn to this cornbread recipe along with the Creamy White Chicken Chili on this site. When I begin to preheat my oven, I put the butter in the baking pan and allow the butter to melt. Once it has melted, I follow the instructions as written. It really helps to only use the baking pan as the only dish. Also, I never have buttermilk on hand. So I put 1 tbls of lemon juice in my 1 cup measurer and add milk up to the 1 cup line. This works as a fabulous substitute. Thanks for adding!!

Making it now. Looks good however I noticed that the sugar was not included with the steps of mixing it together. I figured it out and added it after I already poured it in the pan. No biggie but u may want to revise it.

My family absolutely loved this recipe as it was moist and delicious! I didn't make any changes to the ingredients posted. However, I didn't want to dirty any other dishes, so I prepared and baked my cornbread in a cast iron skillet. I am a southerner and this is the kind of cornbread my aunts used to make so that we kids would eat it...sweet like cake. I'm not sure it's due to baking in the cast iron skillet or due to high altitudes, but I only baked it for 23 minutes.

This is the best cornbread recipe I have found. I have been serving this recipe to my family and friends for about a year now. The recipe has made it in my personal favorites cookbook. By the way, my true southern friends and extended family request my cornbread! In fact, I cut back on the sugar once and was told not to do that again. Thank you for sharing!

This was tasty cornbread but...the sugar needs to be cut down. I thought this was really much too sweet. Maybe it's because I grew up and still live in the southern U.S...I just like plain moist and buttery cornbread without so much sweetness! The buttermilk addition does add a nice touch. I made mine in a 9" round cake pan instead of an 8" square pan.

Whole wheat flour and half the sugar.. it's the best, most flexible cornbread recipe ever!  Next time, I'll add a small can of green chiles.

I have never replied to a "Rate This Recipe" before but Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread is so exceptionally delicious that I must thank Bethany for sharing it!  I followed your directions exactly and baked for 30 min.  It was perfectly moist with a wonderful texture.  I served it with homemade chili and my family is loved it!  Thank you! PS:  If grandmother has any other recipes like this one, I love to have them!

I have to agree with a prior post, no true Southerner puts sugar in the cornbread.  I always use a tablespoon of left over bacon grease I collect in a canister specifically made for grease that strains it.  Heat it until it's starting to steam or it sizzles when you flick a drop of water in it.  Pour the grease over the cornmeal mix, stir, then put back into the pan while it's still hot, this makes the nice browned crust, then put it into the oven on 400F preferably.  I always use buttermilk as well.  If I want to make the cornbread sweet, I don't use sugar, I use honey.  There are also a bunch of different variations I do with the flavors that can be added.  This recipe above is a Northernized version.

Love this recipe. My only change is I use the Eat Clean Power Flour. I make this for my College Alumni regatta and use the Wilton mini muffins. One recipe makes 3 dozen mini muffins and the cook time is about 15 minutes. Thank you for this wonderful recipe!

I like corn bread that is a little more moist. I followed the recipe exactly, baked it for 30 minutes, and this one came out great. It's moist, but still slightly crumbly. Perfect consistency in my opinion, and tastes great!

I made this last night for my family since it was the first snow of the year, and everyone loved it.  I have never made my own cornbread, just bought Jiffy.  This recipe was easy to follow and had amazing taste.  I followed the directions and cooked my cornbread in a preheated oven for 30 minutes and that was perfect.  I put my batter in a cast iron skillet to cook and it made it moist and fluffy.  Perfect recipe and will definitely use this again especially since it is so easy to make.  Like I said I have never cooked cornbread before and I did it the first time.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was almost like dessert.  If you don't have buttermilk - use 1 c milk (less 2 Tbs) and add 2 Tbs lemon juice - let sit for a minute.  I also added 2/3 c drained canned corn.  Could use less sugar next time as it was great but just a tad too sweet.  Would be great with a layer of salsa as well.

Perfect!  I prepared cornbread muffins using this recipe.  I lined the pan with olive oil and a sprinkle of flour so the bread wouldn't stick to the bottom.  Next time I will reduce the amount of sugar and add corn.  The recipe, as is, was a hit at Thanksgiving dinner.

I just made this for the first time and no sooner had I removed it from the pan to the cooling rack, both of my children (ages 1 & 2) went off like car alarms. They gobbled up the warm sample pieces, meaning, this recipe gets their approval. I followed the recipe almost exactly, only melting my butter in the microwave instead of a pan and used Karen's suggestion of mixing 2 Tbsp lemon juice with milk since I didn't have buttermilk. I'm not sure why everyone says this is too sweet, because for me, it tasted fine, though if you're looking for a more prominent corn flavor that the box mixes have, this isn't the recipe you're looking for.

Today was my first time making cornbread, and this recipe was a huge success! It has simple ingredients, easy-to-follow instructions, and most importantly tastes delicious. I paired the cornbread with roasted red peppers, fingerling potatoes and kale-red bean quinoa topped with honey goat cheese. Yum!

This was great...I was out of baking powder so I tripled the amount of baking soda. I used my cast iron skillet to cook the cornbread. I melted the butter in my cast iron skillet.  After you pour the butter into the batter, some will be left in the skillet and you don't have to grease the skillet. The recipe was great!!!!!

Really very good. My bachelor nephew took all the leftovers home. I followed the recipe exactly. In my oven, 30 minutes of cooking was plenty. Would give a 5 star if it was "spectacular" over "really very good".

I really enjoyed this recipe, as did my husband. The only change I made was cutting back the sugar, though it probably would be fine with the full 2/3 cup of sugar. We like our cornbread on the savory side. I mixed in some additional ingredients, like black pepper and corn. Definitely don't bake it for the full 40 minutes. Mine was finished around the 28 minute mark. I've now wrote down this recipe in my keeper book to use from now on.

I give it 4 stars only because it came out to "cakey" for me but the taste was very good. I will tinker with the recipe to see how I can make it not rise so much.

Absolutely loved this. I added one can of whole kernel  corn to the recipe just to give it some more texture. If you choose to do this be sure to drain the corn first.

Delicious! Made this recipe exactly as written except it only baked for 27 minutes and came out perfectly. It was moist, a little sweet and not too crumbly. This will be my go to cornbread recipe from now on.

I think that the sweetness in this recipe somehow overwhelmed the corn flavor but still is very delicious,next time I'll put less sugar and maybe more corn meal.

I thought this was perfect! I've tried Cook's Illustrated and Alton Brown and neither of these were as moist and delicious as this one. I want to pump it up for a chili cook off - anyone experimented with adding cheese, chiles, or corn kernels? I'd love to add all three, but I don't want the bread to fall apart.

This was delicious. I made the recipe as is except I mixed all of the wet ingredients and all of the dry ingredients separately and then combined them. Next time, I'll cut the sugar back to 1/2 cup as it was a little too sweet for me.

OH, MY GOSH! This is WONDERFUL! I can not believe how good it was/is.
I followed the recipe exactly but added fresh corn and chopped pickled jalepeno in the batter.
I melted butter in a big stainless mixing bowl. I put a little bit of water in a frying pan and put that bowl in the pan. And then I did all the ingredients mixing in that bowl after melting the butter just like the owner of this recipe suggested. 
I was concerned about the amount of sugar, too especially after reading some reviews but I decided to follow one reviewer's advice saying that she doesn't like too sweet stuff but this one is definitely not too sweet. I have to agree with her. I can't stand too sweet stuff either. Well, I don't even use syrup when eating pancakes cause I think they are good enough without syrup. This one, I thought was perfect when it comes to sweetness. Don't get me wrong. It was sweet but it was delicious sweet NOT disgustingly sweet or too sweet.
Mine took a long time actually. It could be our stove or maybe the fact that I added fresh corn and jalepeno, or maybe the pan I used. I didn't have 9X9 pan so I used a bread pan. So it took good 40 minutes at 375 for me. I was worried that it might have dried out but it was PERFECT!
My hubby loved it, too. It went so well with tortilla soup I made from this site. I am definitely making it again. Yum, yum, yum..

Followed the recipe exactly but baked in a preheated cast iron skillet for 20 minutes. It tasted very good and I enjoyed it plain while my kids and husband like to slather butter and honey on it. It was moist while still being cornmeal-y unlike the sweet cornbread recipes that I have had before that basically feel like cake (which isn't bad either!) I would make this again.

I enjoy reading members varieties of the recipes!  How boring it would be to read reviews if they were all the same and all did the exact same thing.  Duh!  SO for my review, I have made this cornbread all my life and I am a grandma that learned it from my grandma.  Buttermilk is always the key in making cornbread.  Flour is another key because it makes it easier to consume without choking.  I make this with white cornmeal, not yellow.  I always use either a lodge cast iron skillet or a lodge cast iron biscuit pan.  I reduce the sugar and I reduce the flour.  In fact, I don't even measure.  I mix everything in a bowl.  I always heat the cast iron pans with oil first before pouring in the batter.  It's fun to play around with this recipe.  You can of course, make changes to suit your preferences and even make additions as in adding corn, etc.

Great recipe- I added a bit more salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, and reduced the butter by 1 Tbsp. I put the batter in a very hot cast iron muffin pan that was well greased with bacon grease. This is now my favorite cornbread recipe.

Made this with my dinner and it was a hit - has that sweet taste my husband loves without being overly sweet. I made it true  to the recipe - except I slowly melted the butter in the microwave, so my mixing container was a glass mixing bowl.  Came out moist and fully baked after 30 mins of baking.  I will make the again with my cast iron.

Great tasting cornbread recipe. Next time I will decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup. Baked it in a 10 inch preheated cast iron skillet which I coated with butter before I poured in the batter. I baked @ 375 for 23 minutes. Excellent!

Followed recipe exactly. Best cornbread recipe I have found. And I've tried quite a few. I like this one because it is Yankee cornbread-nice and sweet and moist. "Corn cake" as my friend from Georgia says. Served it at work and everyone loved it. Someone took to use for their Thanksgiving meal.

I tried this recipe last night.  I had family down for the week and made dinner for them last night.  I searched this site on my iphone and found this recipe.  I was a little apprehensive so I followed the recipe exactly and did not subsitute any ingredients (with exception of adding 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla).  I like a hint of vanilla in my cornbread.  It turned out perfect!!!  And it was great!! Cornbread was moist, not too sweet. I rarely rate anything on the internet and I had to rate this recipe.  My grandaughter and her Mom watched so they could try it themselves.  I will never buy Jiffy mix again.

Hey Bethany, I made this recipe a few times...the first time, it came out amazingly well, but I haven't been able to have much success since.  I've switched the type of corn meal...and I noticed that it baked faster, by about 5 minutes.  Does that make sense?  Didn't think the corn meal could impact it that much.  Any suggestions for which corn meal to use?  It really is a great recipe, just wish I knew what I did to change it so much?!?!

this recipe makes people think i'm an excellent cook! since i use a 12" skillet for this, i always double the recipe. if i'm low on butter, i sometimes use lard in place of some or all of the butter, but the butter makes it taste better. at my wife's request, i once added cinnamon and what i consideted to be too much nutmeg. i hated it, but it was her birthday, and that's how she wanted it. next i want to try it with a can of creamed corn, and then with some cheddar chese and a few jalapeños. it's the first recipe i've used successfully—i only began cooking about 6 months ago.

Best Cornbread recipe ever! I have used this recipe multiple times, and it has come out perfectly every time. I prefer sweet cornbread, as does most of my family, so this is lovely!!!

When I make this, though, I tend to just melt the butter in a big, non-metal bowl in the microwave. It works just as well.

Also, sometimes I'll do a little trick my dad used to do. While the oven is preheating and I'm mixing the batter, I'll put a big cast iron pan in the oven and let it heat up. Once I'm ready, I'll pull it out and pour the batter into the cast iron pan. The pan then goes back in to the oven to bake for 30 minutes. Makes a nice, crispy edge.

I needed cornbread for another recipe (Nana's Squash Casserole) and somehow did not have a Jif mix.  I am a true Southerner and I do like my cornbread sweet so I searched for "sweet cornbread" and this one came up.  It was as close to a Jif mix as I could possibly make.  I baked it for 30 minutes and the edges were brown and pulled away from the pan but the center was not done.  That was okay, because it was going into another recipe immediately but for general consumption, this would have been a problem.  It did stick to the bottom of my pan also.  Instead of melting the butter in a skillet, I used my favorite plastic mixing bowl and melted the butter in the microwave and proceeded to mix everything from there.  I will make this again! ***Update - I tried this again and it came out perfect!  I don't know what I did wrong the first time but the center was cooked through this time and we really enjoyed this cornbread.  No more Jiffy mixes for me!

Delicious! It is sweet, and if you want to add a contrast to the sweetness add something with heat. Perhaps a little hot sauce (sriracha), or jalepeno cheddar cheese (4 ouces give or take). 

I altered the recipes and added 1 tbsp. of onion powder, 1/2 tbsp. of dill and 4 ouces cheddar cheese. (My hubby loves those together.) He really enjoyed it. It was super moist. I cooked it for the full 40 minutes. He said the onion and dill were not that noticable so next time I'll up them both by 1/2 tbsp. and add some heat, by using the jalepeno cheddar.

He said he never had cornbread like this. I love that it's a Grandmother's recipe! Can never go wrong with Grandma's cooking!!!

This wasn't the best corn bread I've ever had, nor the worst.  It was nice and moist, so wasn't lacking there in the least.  I read some of the negative reviews to get a taste for what was going on.  Some reviews said it was too salty so since I used salted butter I didn't add additional salt which was a good call.  Then others suggested cutting back the sugar because it was too sweet.  No I am not Southern and I like a sweet corn bread so I was fine with the sugar amount.  Mine did back up a little but I still found it to be a bit dense and flat in places but overall the texture was decent.  The flavor was the disappointment.  People are right it's quite a bland corn bread, a little sweet, a tiny bit of corn taste but not much.  It was okay with butter and preserves or honey on it but alone it was quite meh.  It did taste quite a bit better after giving it a short rest to cool down.

This recipe makes a very moist, light, nicely texutured cornbread. However next time I make it, I am going to slighty increase the cornmeal to flour ratio and reduce the sugar to half of what is specified.  As it is, this recipe came out too much like cake versus true southern cornbread. With these adjustments, I think I will have cornbread exactly like I want it to be.

This gets 5 stars from the kids and hubby! I tried it with 1/2c of sugar because I thought it might be too sweet. It wasn't, so I'll try it with the full amount of sugar next time. 30 minutes was the perfect amount of time. I like mine a little more "corny", so I might try another recipe for me and keep this one for everyone else...forever:) Thanks for sharing!!!

Nice easy recipe. Very moist. Without the sweetness it would be bland. I added 3/4 cup finely grated zucchini which worked well and made it more visually appealing. Next time will add in chopped jalepeno's to give it more depth.

The first time I made cornbread was when I used the mix from the box. Since then, I've thought I would never make cornbread again because it's hard and bland. Yesterday, I made jambalaya and my husband said it would go well with cornbread.Oh-oh! However, I tried to find out if Allrecipes had something good on it. And I came to this recipe. Based on the good reviews, I decided to give this a try. I never buy buttermilk, so I squeezed 1 lemon and add it with milk until it filled up to 1 cup. Also,I used the iron cast skillet put in the oven. And the result? Oh, my! It's so delicious and soft. I'll absolutely keep this recipe. Thanks, Bethany :)

I thought this was pretty good!  I thought it was a little sweet and I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.  I used regular flour and almond milk instead of cow.  It looked a little light but the taste was great!  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh, I doubled the recipe and mixed everything in the pan I melted the butter in...easy!

My sons have been talking about cornbread lately....so, my girlfriend, who is an excellent cook gave me a recipe.  My guys hated it. It wasn't sweet, you used honey as well as sugar and it had a strange aftertaste.  Found your recipe, I had buttermilk left so I figured I'd give it a try.  In the future, I need to make a double batch! There is only one little square left.  Funny when your two sons, ages 18 and 14 with the elder being over 6'5" gobble food down and ask if you can make more that evening!  Great, great, great recipe!  Thanks for sharing! This will become a recipe that will be asked for a lot!

A-Maze-ing! Seriously very good. I doubled it and divided it in half...one half with corn and one without. I also preheat the skillet in the oven with some of the butter. Then I pour the batter in the skillet, and put directly into the oven...I then cooked it for 30 minutes. It was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

This is very good, though I used vinegar and milk in place of the buttermilk. It ended up bubbling up quite a bit when I added the baking soda. I was never good in chemistry so I don't know if that means they cancelled out? It was still yummy.

Had to cook it a bit longer so that the middle wouldn't be soup. Also, I didn't use a pan to melt the butter or in which to combine the ingredients. A microwavable bowl worked just as well.

I would suggest to lessen the amount of sugar. It's a bit sweet for me.

Wonderful rich flavor, a bit on the sweeter side.  Wife is obsessed, had it for breakfast two weeks running.  :-)  Not dry at all.

Great recipe. Used 1/2 c honey instead of sugar. whole wheat flour instead of white. Mixing everything in the frying pan is brilliant.

This taste pretty close to the sweetness of Jiffy Mix, but it is SOOOOO much better.  Even the next day!  It does not have that bitter taste that a lot of cornbread recipes seem to have.

I used 1/2 cup Splenda Blend instead of sugar.  Also, I used 1/2 cup Pioneer cornmeal and 1/2 cup Bob's Red Mill cornmeal-medium grind.  This added a bit of crunch to the cornbread.

If you are baking in a cast iron skillet, remember to FIRST put your skillet in the oven to preheat.  Take it out when oven is up to temp, spray with oil, then pour batter in.  Mine takes 30 min in a preheated oven/skillet sat on a medium low oven rack.

By far the best recipe for cornbread I have ever used! My family likes their cornbread a little sweet so I chose this recipe when looking. I was using the recipe on the bag of cornmeal...always dry and fell apart, so I went on a search for a good recipe. Read all the reviews and chose this one and I am sooo very glad I did! It is awesome, moist, just sweet enough and doesn't fall apart. My husband raves everytime I make it. Oh, and I make it in a cast iron skillet...WOW!! Thank you for sharing this recipe. And by the way....I didn't alter a thing!

This is a “go to” recipe for me when I want to make cornbread. I like my cornbread sweet and moist, and this is both. Quick and easy to put together. Top marks.

Amazing!!!!! My husband and my two boys, ages five and two request this on a weekly basis. Thank you for the best corn bread recipe ever. Light and fluffy, but with a bite to it! Perfect! (Also subbed whole wheat flour for the white flour so it was a little healthier)

My husband and I love this recipe.. it's my go to cornbread recipe now... don't always have buttermilk but I use plain yogurt or milk without any problems...also tweaking the sugar and baking soda amounts is extremely forgiving.

I absolutely loved it!!  Very easy to make and wasn't too sweet.  I made mine in a cast iron skillet and it cooked up great and it didn't stick at all.  I will most definitely make it again.  The only thing I did different was at the last five minutes of baking it I melted a half a stick of butter on top of it while it was still in the oven.    Thank you Bethany for submitting it.

Perfect cornbread. Seriously - to all the "southerns" who rate this recipe down,  just because you think true cornbread shouldn't be sweet, doesn't make you right.  I melted the butter separately, then mixed all the ingredients in a bowl and poured it in a preheated skillet. Baked it for 30 minutes. The bottom had a great crispiness but the bread was still moist. We ate it with ham and bean soup. Yes, some people don't think it's blasphemy to eat bean soup over sweet cornbread. Shocker!

This is the BEST BEST BEST cornbread recipe ever!! I always hated cornbread because I grew up with my mother making Jiffy cornbread mix. so I never ever wanted to make cornbread because I thought it would taste like the kind I grew up with...until I tried this recipe!!! This recipe has totally changed my mind because IT IS AWESOME!! My family and I now love cornbread. This will now be MY family recipe for corn bread. I will even make some for my mother so she will stop using Jiffy.

Just outstanding.  Added chopped jalapenos and about 1 cup of frozen corn.  Moist and flavorful.  Thanks for my new go to cornbread recipe.     NOTE: I live in Denver, 5280 altitude and made no adjustments.

Made this tonight to have with a 15 bean soup.  It was SOOO good!  My husband and mother-in-law loved it.  I used the powdered buttermilk because I don't know what I would do with the rest of a quart of buttermilk and it worked fine added with the other dry ingredients.  Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly.

Made this with my seven year-old daughter to use up some buttermilk.  We did mix it in a bowl (one of days when we had the bowl, measuring spoons, etc all out and were just trying to figure out what to bake)) then poured it into a 9" round pan.   Baked it for 40 minutes, but I probably should have taken it out a minute or two earlier.  No worries, it was still delicious!  I think...no, I know, I ate the majority of this!  Thanks for sharing!

very good - we like our cornbread a bit sweet, so this was great. Used medium grind corn meal so it was a little crunchy.  Did not have buttermilk so used the old substitution of regular milk with a splash of vinegar.

So easy, so delicious - followed directions exactly. It’s hard to screw up. I like this recipe because the cornbread holds together and can be buttered. Most of cornbread I’ve had crumbles so easily.

It is now the recipe I use everytime I make cornbread.   I too melt the butter in the cast iron skillet and bake my cornbread in that skillet.   My husband loves it crusty and it is perfect!    I follow the recipe just as it is written and love it!

This is the BEST cornbread my family has ever eaten!! I followed the recipe as directed but since I was using a dark coated 8X8 pan (sprayed with Pam), I lowered the oven to 350 and baked it for 25 minutes on Convection Bake.  It came out perfect!  I also used a low-fat cultured buttermilk (instead of a bulgarian buttermilk).  It truly was delicious along with a bowl of Red Beans and Rice! After years of trying other brands in the store where all you add is egg and milk, this is the only cornbread recipe I will ever use from now on!  Thanks Bethany for sharing this AWESOME recipe!!!

Awesome!  I followed the recipe exactly (except made muffins-baked for about 15 minutes) and I had to wait for my husband's seal of approval before I could rate this, but he said that they were "Gooooooood!"  I did have to make my own buttermilk because I forgot to get it at the store but again these were great.

Easy to make and very tasty.  I accidewntly put baking soda with other dry ingredients instead of mixing it with buttermilk...but it still turned out good.  I don't know how and what difference it would have made....  I'll try to follow the direction the next time.

This really sends you back, there’s know cooking like the old cooking. The world is moving too fast, what I wouldn’t give to go back to the days when things were simple and all the food you ate was as good as this. This puts every corn bread recipe and box mix to shame. Add some collards cooked all afternoon on low and you have the best meal in the world.

I didn't have buttermilk so I substituted 1tbsp of lemon juice with skim milk and let it sit for about 5 minutes.  The cornbread turned out great with the buttermilk substitute.

This is the best cornbread I've ever made.  I add a small can of creamed corn to the recipe but that's my only change.  I do the entire recipe start to finish in a lodge cast iron skillet.  Once the ingredients are mixed, I pop the skillet in the oven and bake.  It comes out amazing every single time.

This is a great recipe, super easy and moist with a sweet buttery flavor.  I love both sweet and southern cornbread, but this one is the sweet kind without being to cake-like, some of the sweet ones call for too much flour and this one is just right.  If you wanted it less sweet I'm sure you could add less sugar.  Thanks for a great recipe!

SOOO good!  I actually used margarine because I was doubling the recipe and didn't have enough butter but it was really good with margarine so I can only imagine that it's even better with butter.  Perhaps I'll make it both ways some day to compare... I ended up accidentally overcooking it a bit but I made it to accompany chili so I thought the crunchy factor made it even more enjoyable.  It IS a little on the sweet side so if you don't like sweet cornbread I would suggest reducing the sugar a tad.

A tasty cornbread recipe. At first I thought it was a little bit too sweet, like almost on the verge of being 'cake' sweet, but with a hearty layer of butter it's very yummy. I baked mine for about 35 minutes so it was crunchy on the outside but still moist on the inside. I would make this again but would probably decrease the sugar just a tad.

everyone loved this cornbread. i read many of the reviews, but then just followed the recipe exactly as instructed by the creator, and it turned out great. one note though: the melted butter pan should stay separate from all the other ingredients you mix together. at the end just pour the mix in to the melted butter pan.

This is the perfect cornbread recipe.  It has just enough sweetness to not be overpowering, it's perfectly moist inside and the top has just the right amount of crisp crunch.  It's perfect with a spicy chili or for breakfast in the morning.  I will never use another cornbread recipe ever again.

This recipe was great even though I kinda screwed it up. I started the recipe thinking I had regulars cornmeal. Had to make my own buttermilk as I didn't have any real on hand. When I got to the part to add cornmeal, flour, etc. I looked at my cornmeal bag and it was self-rising. So luckily I hadn't added any salt or flour yet. I added 2 c. Of the self rising mix. Omitted the salt and flour called for on the recipe. It baked for 30 minutes. Top was lightly crispy. It was a dense but sweet cornbread and my guest thought it was exceptional. Served with pork stew and/or with butter and honey. Good both ways. My goof my be my go to recipe but I would like to try this as written. Just wanted to write this review to let cooks know there's a way to use this recipe even if you don't have the exact ingredients. Followed the rest of the recipe as written. Thanks Grandma!

I've been making this for a few years and people now ask for it.  I make it just as like the recipe says except I do pour the batter in a hot buttery iron skillet.  It is just wonderful. I always double the recipe and it never goes to waste.

This is a great cornbread recipe.  The end result is light yet moist and sweet. It is slightly denser on the second day, but still holds together nicely and retains its flavor and moisture.  I love it grilled in a fry pan the second day.

Made this recipe yesterday and followed it as directed.  It was the best cornbread recipe I've prepared.  Took the author's advice and made the batter all in the same pan that I melted the butter.

I have been looking for a moist cornbread recipe that is similar to the cornbread served at Black-Eyed Pea. I am looking no further. I don't usually have buttermilk on hand and the substitution of 2 T vinegar replacing 2 T milk turned out fine. My kids and picky eater husband loved it.

Made this as written except used 2% milk, replacing two tablespoons with lemon juice, and added a cup of frozen corn kernels to the batter.  
Made it to go with Boilermaker Tailgate Chili, but it was so good it was half gone before the chili was ready!  Had to make another batch.

Great recipe.  I added corn to this as well and it came out pretty good.  I couldn't find cornmeal so I just substituted it with a box of Jiffy Corn Mix

I'd never eaten cornbread in my life (I live in Scotland) until my cousin who lives in the States came over for a holiday.  We celebrated a fabulous Thanksgiving dinner and this was my first taste of Cornbread, it was absolutely delicious.  This was the site from where she got took the recipe and I've now joined to find out what other delights I can try. I look forward to many more fantastic recipes.  Thank you

I've been making this recipe for years, and can't believe I haven't rated it yet. My family and friends love this cornbread. It's the only one we eat. Thank you for sharing it. I've added a can of chopped jalapenos and it adds a nice kick. Love this with soup, and stews. It double beautifully, and leftovers are still yummy the next day.

I made this recipe yesterday and I didn't like it. Let me first start by saying that when I make recipes for the first time, I make them exactly as listed. To my dismay, I didn't like the outcome. My cornbread was thick, not light and fluffy; it lacked flavor even with me adding the about of sugar listed in the ingredients. Some may like it but it's just not for me.

I made this gluten dairy soy free and it was so yum for my little one. Want to share: I substituted for 4 eggs - egg whites, for white flour I substituted 1 cup potato flour, 1/4 cup quinoa flour, 1 tsp baking powder,  added 1/4 cup olive oil, for milk I used buttermilk b/c my child can EAT THAT ONCE IT IS BAKED OUT AT 400, (but I   you could try almond milk), and palm oil for the melted butter. I followed all the mixing directions in the above reciped baked at 400 for about 6 minutes (to bake out dairy) and then for the second batch reduced the heat to 350) and baked the 2nd batch for about 6 minutes. This is the most moist,non-chewy 'normal' gluten free bread i've ever had!

After my first time making this it turned out alright. It came out a little too dry and dense for what I was expecting based on the reviews, but I am new to baking so for the next batch I will try cutting the baking time down (I did 30 minutes this time, and it seemed to have possibly overdone it a little bit).  Hopefully the next pan turns out better given that for a lot of people this seems to have worked out amazing!

Wonderful! I am from the south, born and raised, and my momma ALWAYS put sugar in her cornbread, so speak for yourself Kay! Hot skillet or not it doesn't matter, this is a very good recipe and my kids sit anxious by the oven waiting for it to be ready. It's a great alternative to using lard..I personally don't want pig fat in my cornbread.  You don't have to eat pig fat or shun sugar to be from the south..in fact I am enjoying this cornbread right now with my sweet tea and spicy chili that has brownSUGAR in it..*gasp*. 

I also used whole wheat organic flour and cultured raw buttermilk and it turned out amazing! Thanks for sharing and my southern family LOVES your grandmother's recipe!

followed it exactly, and baked for 30 minutes. i would have preferred it to be less cakey and more corn-mealy, but that is simply personal preference. this is a good recipe!

Unless I'm preparing desert, I normally don't cook with granulated sugar so I substituted with equal and reduced the amount to 2 teaspoons.  I also tempered the eggs into the butter and sugar mixture. Turned out moist and tender. Tasted as good as the cornmuffin recipe by Cracker Barrel. I served this recipe with Wendy's Ultimate Chili.  Excellent and Highly recommended.

This is excellent.  I love it.  The husband is kicking off football season with some Chilli so I made this to go with it.  This is even better than the homesteader cornbread on this site.  I did use a little more than half the amount of sugar.  I can't imagine using the whole amount.  I think it would be too sweet.

I have used this recipe twice now. My husband and I love it! It's so delicious and moist. Both times I didn't have cornmeal but I had a sack of Maseca corn flour. Oh and, we pretty much never buy real milk, so I use soy milk, the plain or Vanilla. It works perfectly with this recipe. I'll definitely continue using this recipe every time we want cornbread. Thank you!

Slightly less time, add cheese inside- is a bit dry but maybe just overcooked, no sugar needed

I LOVE this recipe!!  I had never like cornbread until I came across this!  I generally make it in the pan, but today I made mini muffins for my daughter's class.  I made a double batch and it made 108 of them (with enough batter for maybe 6 more, I'm not sure though, I didn't make anymore).  I had to play with the time a little bit.  I started with 10, next batch I went down to 9 and finished with 8 minutes.  They were a little dry with the higher cook time, but not so dry that you can't eat them.  I thought they were perfect at 8 mins.

I usually use premade cornbread from a box. If I planned on using four boxes, do I need to double this recipe to equal four boxes, or is this enough? 

Thanks!

I really don't make cornbread although I do like it. I made this recipe for a birthday party we were going to. I had to taste test if and had a couple, few pieces. It is very yummy. I had to hurry and pack it up before I ate any more. The next time I make it I think I might try and add a small can of drained, crushed corn and see how it comes out. I think this cornbread will be a hit.

I have made this cornbread several times. It is a no-fail recipe. I do combine things in separate containers but it hasn't been a problem. I use the microwave to melt the butter in a pyrex measuring cup and then add the sugar and eggs to it. I combine the buttermilk and soda in another glass cup and then add it to the butter mixture. I then pour all of that over the dry ingredients. I also melt about a tablespoon of butter in my 9x13 baking dish in the oven and then pour the batter into the hot buttered pan. I like my cornbread a bit crispy and prefer thinner pieces. It is a sweet cornbread, almost like a cake but we all love it.

I LOVE this recipe! I've made it in the oven AND in a dutch oven while camping. We also add diced jalapenos sometimes for an extra kick!!

All my friends always request that I make it...it's not dry, not too sweet, and DELICIOUS!!!

I followed the suggestions of other reviewers: decreased the sugar to 1/2 cup and "created" buttermilk using regular milk plus lemon juice.  This is excellent, easy and most cooks likely have all the ingredients on hand.

This recipe for cornbread is one of the best ones I have tried! I followed the recipe exactly, except I baked it for only 25 minutes and then broiled the top at the end, and it came out perfect. It is moist and flavorful. A trick I have done with other cornbread in the past is to add a cup or so of canned sweet corn! And some jalapeno peppers. I haven't tried it with this recipe but I think that the sweet corn would act as at least a partial substitute for the sugar. Anyway, very delicious and I will make again!

My first experience with cornbread was in a Catholic school cafeteria, and since then, I've spent my entire life saying "Ick, I hate cornbread!" But I married a southerner and decided that I really should try to give this humble food a second chance.  And oh my god am I glad I started here.  This recipe was perfect.  To suit my husband's love for the spicier things in life, I added some chopped jalapenos, green chilies and jack/cheddar cheese, but left the essence of the recipe unchanged.  I baked it in a buttered cast iron skillet for about 30-32 minutes.  My husband is still talking about it and insisted that I be sure to leave this review.  And yes, my southern boy always adds sugar to his cornbread, so to each his own I say!

This recipe is perfect and everything that I wanted my cornbread to be! Dense, moist, slightly sweet. I added 1/2 of a chopped fresh jalapeno pepper for a tiny bit of kick and it was delicious.

OMG! This was heavenly!  I read your own comments to other reviews and used 1/2 cup all purpose and 1/2 cup whole wheat. My kids couldn't get enough. I had been looking for a recipe similar to a cornbread I had tried at a restaurant years ago and now have found one that is even better!

I made chili yesterday to take to a friend and thought cornbread would be a great "go-with" Tried your recipe, and OMG!! I've never tasted cornbread this good. Actually, I forgot about having chili for my supper and just ate the cornbread---I couldn't stop. My friend, who was born and raised in Alabama tells me she loves sweet cornbread, so, yes, some true southerners enjoy our Yankee version.

I have never made cornbread before and needed to bring it to a get together.  Thank goodness All Recipes had several to choose from.  I looked at numerous recipes before I decided on this one - after all, everything is good with buttermilk!  I understand why this recipe received high ratings! Everyone raved about how good it was and I shared the recipe with a couple people.  Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I really like the recipe.  I used a teaspoon of Truvia instead of the sugar and added a can of niblets corn, drained. I dusted the top with a little smoke paprika prior to baking. Everyone loved it!

This cornbread made the list of "desert island" food for two of the five diners around our table. It's not necessarily healthy, and could be served as a dessert, but holy cow are these yummy!

Great flavor.  I've been looking for a cornbread recipe as the mix I usually use has gotten really expensive.  I made this recipe the first time as it was written and liked the flavor but not the grittiness of the cornmeal.  The second time I did it as follows and had the great flavor and no grit: 

Put 1 cup cornmeal and 2 cups water in a saucepan.  Bring to a boil, then turn off heat, stir it, and let it sit until it has soaked up all the water.  Then dump it in a bowl and add all the ingredients listed (I melted the butter in the microwave).  Then you cook as directed, although I poured it on top of a pan that was about 1/3 full of homemade chili.  It came out just as good as the mix if not better.  Very moist and yummy!  I serve the cornbread chili casserole over a little chedder cheese and put butter on top.

This was a great recipe. However, I did lower the sugar amount, slightly, to 1/2 C instead of 2/3 C. I thought it was the perfect sweetness and texture. It is a sweet, cake-like cornbread. Normally, I use honey butter, but it was not needed. Great as a side to chili.

LOVED this recipe.  Didn't have any eggs so used 3/4 cups of plain nonfat yogurt and 3/4 cups of mayo as a substitution for the butter, eggs and buttermilk.  Also substituted honey for the sugar, and added a few chopped hot peppers.  Cooked in a preheated cast iron pan and it was delicious.  If it can stand up to my substitutions  you know its good!

Awesome recipe just as it is.This is the kind of cornbread I grew up eating being from New England and I think this is the best way to eat it.My family is now addicted since I've started making this.It is dense and heavy with the perfect moisture level and sweetness.

Very good recipe!! It is very sweet though so if you don't like really sweet cornbread I would suggest using a bit less. Other then that it is a great recipe!

Used this recipe to serve a large chili and cornbread meal. Scaled nicely to 108 servings. Just dumped in 5 lb. sacks of flour and cornmeal instead of measuring. Drizzled with melted butter and honey. Folks were very happy.

It was good.  It all depends on what you are looking for in a cornbread. This one is less moist, more dense, and less sweet other's, which do not use buttermilk. My husband prefers this recipe and my toddlers like both, so YMMV.

I followed the directions to the letter.  I took the suggestion to mix the batter in the same pan used to melt the butter but instead of pouring into a different baking dish I used a large round cast iron pan and simply put it right into the oven.  Came out fantastic!!

This was DELICIOUS!!! My kids who normally HATE corn bread (of the packaged variety) Loved this! My husband even was shocked about how yummy it was!!! I made them as muffins, and we had them with chili. I even put some in the freezer to eat with the leftover chili. YUMMMMM!

Excellent cornbread recipe!  Very easy recipe, but it does take a bit more time to make it from scratch (and I honestly thought it was about equal to Costco's Penguin brand as far as sweet cornbread goes), but if you have the time....or in my case, some extra buttermilk on hand from another recipe....it's worth the effort.  I baked mine in a preheated cast iron skillet....is there any other way?!

Very very good cornbread.  If you are a southerner and like the non-sweet, buttery-tasting southern style corn bread, just omit the sugar.

Yummy cornbread if you leave out the sugar.  I'd give it 5 stars if the directions were clearer.

Quite frankly the best cornbread EVER!  Supermoist and a perfect companion to Blackeyed Peas, or Chili. I followed instructions and melted butter in skillet, mixed dry ingredients together seperate from the eggs and buttermilk then added all ingredients to skillet and then poured into greased pan.  Two changes, I substituted 2/3 cup of instant vanilla pudding for the sugar, and added a dollop more buttermilk.  Used Wondra flour, which is our preference.  Perfectly sweet, moist and delicious! Absolute keeper.

The best cornbread I have ever put in my mouth and I followed the recipe exactly.  Would love to make it more often, but it's not exactly heathy with a full stick of butter.  That being said, it is definitely worth the occasional splurge.  I may try as some reviewers suggested as replace half the butter with applesauce, but I really hate to mess with the perfection of this recipe.  Even my mega picky 16 month old who won't eat anything devoured it.

Didn't have buttermilk, so used "soured" milk (3 Tsp vinegar per cup of homogenized milk - let sit 5 mins) and changed the cornmeal and flour proportions to 3/4 cup of cornmeal and 3/4 cup of flour and added 1/2 cup of corn flour... Makes it very light and still moist... Also recipe is easily doubled to fit in a 8" x 13" pan for 40 mins at 375 degrees.

I've used this recipe on numerous occasions and always have fabulous results. It's a prerequisite for any family holiday we have. If I didn't make it my family would be so disappointed. Recently I've changed the sugar to coconut sugar and it works well and tastes just as good the only difference is it stays moist even after freezing. This is my go to recipe for cornbread and I will never waiver from it!

You won't believe it.  After making a batch that went in seconds for a function, promised my kids I'd bake some for them.  I dropped the whole bowl on the floor!  In my haste to make them again, I accidentally left out the eggs!  You aren't going to believe it, but they baked up great!  Slightly more crumbly, but delicious!   Amazing recipe! I finally found the perfect cornbread!

By far, this is the best cornbread recipe. I first served it with a spicy chili and it was the perfect moist, not too sweet side. The sweetness is more like a muffin, but you can always pare it back if it seems to sweet for you. My oven runs a bit hot, so I only had to cook this for 30 minutes... just be sure to check it every five minutes after 25 minutes of cooking to be sure it doesn't dry out. Finally a cornbread recipe I will use over and over again!

I kept everything the same except I added melted bacon fat from drippings I save in the fridge instead of butter and I used baking powder instead of baking soda and this recipe rocks!  Thank you so much for sharing this one :)

I had leftover buttermilk from the holidays and searched for a recipe to use it up in.  I made this because my grandson loves cornbread.   This is the best I ever ate!  I made it with white whole wheat flour and it was delicious.  All my grandson wanted was the whole pan of cornbread and a jar of honey...happy 7 year old!!!

This was my first attempt at making cornbread and my hubby and I were pretty satisfied.  We ran out of white sugar, so I used a half white sugar/half brown sugar combo, although I did cut back on the total amount of sugar because I figured the brown sugar would make it too sweet and based on other reviews. Everything else we kept the same.  Ironically, this gets 4 stars instead of 5 because we wish it had been sweeter and that the cornmeal grains had been bigger and less cake-like (maybe more like Panera/Dunkin Donuts cornbread/muffins). However, it does get 5 out of 5 stars for being super moist (we baked for 25 minutes).  Really great.  Will make again, but will get the right sugar and keep the recipe amount.  Hopefully, it will be a 5 out of 5 star recipe after that! Thanks for sharing!

GREAT! Has a nice flavor. I made it by the recipe and did not add anything, on my first try. It came out very nice and sweet. (not too sweet, imo, just perfect) Hubby likes with butter! Yum :)

Perfect cornbread. Very moist. Mine only took 25 minutes, so if you had dry cornbread, you may have cooked it too long.

I make this recipe exactly as written and it's the best cornbread I've ever had, much less made myself! Absolutely perfect exactly as written, and I've made it at least 20 times although I rarely bake from scratch, and it's been requested again by everyone who tries it!

Oh my gosh so good! I make these into muffins and serve with chili, or freeze them and have them for breakfast after heating in the microwave :D  My husband wasnt a fan of cornbread but he likes these muffins! These are a sweeter cornbread, but I think it tastes perfect with spicy chili! Thanks for sharing

I've only ever made Jiffy or other packaged corn bread mix. For a family gathering I made this recipe as written.  It was great!  I made the batter and poured it into the baking pan, took it to the party and then baked it to be fresh when we were done barbecuing. Fabulous! Thanks!  I will admit I was a little confused with the instructions but realized it was meant to be all mixed in the pan, hence removing from heat so the eggs don't cook while mixing it in.  It was simple this way and I'll be making corn bread more often now that I know how easy it can be made from scratch and I do appreciate not dirtying more bowls!

This was one of the better recipes I have tried for cornbread.  I am always looking for one that will emulate Marie Callendars and while this one isn't the softer "cakier" type, it had great flavor and was moist.  I don't understand how it could come out dry unless you overbake it.  Thanks for sharing!

Great recipe!  I only used a 1/2 cup of sugar because I don't like sweet cornbread, but that was the only change I made.

This was delicious!  I added an additional 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and it was perfect cornbread.  I also loved how easy it was to make:  no mixing dry ingredients separately from wet ingredients and dirtying a bunch of bowls.  One pan, easy peasy, and YUMMY!

Great recipe, very moist, just a little too sweet for me.  I suggest reducing the amount of sugar.

This is by far the best cornbread recipe I've ever tried.  Made as written, and was fantastic.  Next time I think I'll try with whole wheat flour.

This is the best cornbread recipe yet. Also, for anyone saying this is not southern style cornbread. Speak for yourself! Guess it depends on what area of the south you are from.

I will be making cornbread for the first time.  My questions is, could these be baked a night before thanksgiving or are they best freshly made right before we have dinner?  I'm trying to cut my baking time for Thursday by baking my pies and if possible cornbread the night before.  thanks!!

This cornbread recipe is exceptional. The cornbread it produced is light, fluffy, and buttery. I did halve the amount of sugar as my personal preference is for cornbread to be only slightly sweet.

This is quite good.  I agree with the author, go with the lesser time, and go up from there.  I took mine out at 28 minutes and I think 25 would be my next try.  You cant take back time, start low and build from there.  Really good cornbread, I ate 2 pieces.  Also, I made a nice honey butter to go with it.

Absolutely love it, followed it to a tee, no changes. We live in the North, Eastern Iowa, to be more spot on and it's perfect. I can't stand Jiffy cornbread or any boxed or packaged that is like that...it's a texture thing for me. This tastes perfect and does NOT have that whole texture issue for me. Love it, thank you!

I know this has been out here on allrecipes for years, but I just had to add that I will NEVER make a mix cornbread or use a different recipe. I had always thought that Jiffy Box was terrific(which it is) but this is so easy and tastes so terrific.  Thank you so much for sharing this with the world.

Excellent recipie! This cornbread is moist and slightly sweet. It has the perfect cornbread texture, not too gritty and not too soft. I added a can of drained corn for more flavor and texture. My family absolutely loves it.

“This recipe is the BOMB,” said my dear friend whom I shared this with. She went to Johnson & Wales Culinary School, on a full scholarship! She like to experiment, and bakes this in the oven in here cast iron skillet. She preheats the skillet, while she preheats the oven, then melts butter in the skillet, before she pours the batter in. Delicious, it gives the bottom a bit of crispiness!

Fabulous!! I doubled the recipe and substituted 1/3 cup applesauce for 1 stick of butter; used baking powder instead of baking soda and used 1 cup regular corn meal and 1 cup finer grain corn meal and it was perfect. Moist, sweet, dense with a bit of crunch on the crust. Well worth skipping the box mix and make your own from scratch.

I've probably contributed somewhere around 3 online reviews in my entire life. I joined this website just to say how good this really is. For someone whose culinary expertise is limited to grilled cheese and peanut butter and jelly, it was refreshingly simple and easily the best cornbread I've ever had. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The best cornbread I've ever had. The bread is sweet, moist, and holds together nicely. I had always relied on a box mix for cornbread but wasn't completely happy with it because it left a weird feeling in my mouth- this was the answer to my prayers. Simple and delicious!

Very good recipe. I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 shortening in mine and made it in an iron skillet. I didn't mix the baking soda with the milk because that just didn't make sense to me. I mixed the backing soda with the flour and it turned out just dandy.

Awesome!  Used a muffin tin instead of 8 x 8 square pan.  Also, tried to make a bit "healthier" by using fat free milk, egg whites, and olive oil in place of the butter (used 1/4 cup olive oil).  Turned out great...a moist, dense bread perfect for scooping up that extra bit of chili at the bottom of the bowl. Would be great with fried chicken, too!  My family loves this recipe!

This is pretty darn good!  Super quick to make and very tasty and moist.  A 4 is about the highest I give because I reserve 5 stars for only the rarest 100% absolute best. I'm sure there are knock-your-socks-off corn breads out there. This didn't blow me away, but this will be my go-to recipe from here on out. Made it as directed in recipe.

perfect recipe - moist and a little sweet. used light land of lakes butter, and lowfat buttermilk. after cooking 40 min, put on high in oven to get a more golden top. so good!

I haven't made homemade cornbread in a long time because my husband doesn't like it. Tonight I made chili so I figured now was the time to try some homemade cornbread on him. He said, "I don't normally like cornbread but I will definitely eat this."
It was a great recipe but I did tweak it a bit. I reduced the amount of sugar to 1/4 cup because I felt the amount listed was just too much. I also ground up a can of sweet white corn and mixed all the ingredients in a seasoned cast iron skillet then cooked it in the oven for 23 minutes. It came out perfectly. It held together wonderfully. Had a lightly sweet taste but still tastes like the warm, buttery cornbread my grandma use to make.

This was good, but more like corn cake.  Very sweet.  My husband loved it and I will fix again, but with less sugar next time.

I have NEVER made homemade cornbread only from a mix. I made this and it was SO easy and SOOO good! The only thing different I did was I have a 10 in WELL seasoned cast iron skillet. I melted the butter in that then mixed all ingredients in the same pan and stuck it right in the oven. Turned out PERFECT and one less dish to wash. Hubby told me I outdid myself on this one. Thanks for the recipe! Will absolutely make it again and again. Oh and by the way I am a terrible baker and this turned out picture & taste perfect should say how easy it was!

Let's just say I've made this 5 times in the past week. One for my mom, one for my work, one for my husbands work, and two for us. :) I've noticed that cooking it closer to 30 minutes as opposed to 40 typically results in a fluffier, more moist cornbread.

This cornbread turned out perfectly!! I was a bit aprehensive about the amount of sugar called for, but after reading one reviewer's comment about not needing/wanting to add honey to the finished product, I went ahead and used the full sugar amount. Delicous! Super moist, light yet dense at the same time, and just the right amount of sweet. Great recipe! I'll never again use Jiffy mix!

This was fantastic sweet corn bread and went particularly well with my spicy black bean and chorizo chili. I mixed the ingredients exactly as the recipe suggests and used the cast iron pan cooking method that other reviewers mentioned. It came out a tad dry and probably could have cooked for a few less minutes in the oven (I did 25). But, everyone who tried it loved it and it was the favorite of several cornbreads present at the chili cookoff.

This was the first from-scratch cornbread I have ever made, and it was the best cornbread I've ever had (or pretty close, lol).  I made it completely as it is and will never, ever, buy a mix again.  Thanks Grandmother, lol

Was intrigued to try this recipe to go alongside BBQ Chili and after seeing this being so highly rated I couldn't wait to try.  I followed the recipe except for using a little less sugar and it turned out fantastic!  I love that it held its shape and didn't get all crumbly like other cornbreads can do.  Moist and delicious!  Definitely a keeper!

This was a huge hit with everyone I've made it for. I didn't even like cornbread until I made this recipe. I did make 2 substitutions. I used skim milk instead of buttermilk, and 1/3 cup sugar with about 1/4-1/3 cup honey. I found that it goes great with my husband's chili.

This was fabulous!  I didn't have buttermilk or lemon, so I used a little less regular milk and added a dollop of sour cream.  I have never made cornbread before but I will definitely be doing so again - especially since my husband has already eaten half of it!  Loved the crunchy edges and bottom, so I will probably make them as muffins to get more "outside" bits.

This was my first attempt at making cornbread, and it was wonderful! I made it with a beef vegetable stew... Oh yum! My hubby and kids couldn't get enough of it. I should've doubled the recipe but oh what a great comfort food combo right now cause it's getting cold! Thank you also to the one who wrote the substitution for buttermilk (omit 2 Tbsp. Milk and replace with 2 Tbsp. Lemon juice). What a tasty mid morning snack with jam! Thank you again, this recipe is a keeper!

I have made this lots of times and everyone always loves it!  I have passed on the recipe many times!  I like to melt the butter in my cast iron pan, mix everything else in, and then throw it in the oven.  Gotta love a recipe that doesn't make any extra dishes!

I've made this several times.  My daughter is very picky and she loves this bread.  My husband loves it, as well, and he always said no one could make cornbread like his mother!  I'm from the South and I know my cornbread--this one is top-notch!

I make this with (a little less than one cup of) ricemilk and vinegar with earth balance soy-free butter and it is still good.  This is the best corn-bread recipe I have tried and my family absolutely loves it.  The pan is gone within an hour of baking.  I just mix all of the ingredients in the cake pan I bake it in and that saves me the extra dishes.

This cornbread is absolutely delicious! I like sweet cornbread, so I don't adjust the sugar. I make 1 1/2 batches and spoon it all into a 9x13" pan and bake it for 30 minutes and it is perfectly moist.

This recipe didnt come out good at all. I followed the recipe to the letter. The only thing I can figure is altitude, I could not even make a batter out of this. Also it is to sweet even with just 1/2c sugar.

Really good cornbread recipe.  I used mostly whole wheat flour, regular milk with 1 Tbs lemon juice, and slightly less sugar than called for and it was very good.  I made them into muffins - took 15 min, and mini muffins (7 min).  My kids LOVED them.

Yummy and pretty moist.  I took it with me to the Philadelphia Folk Fest this weekend and my camp site liked it.  It went great with butter and our grilled pork chops.  It was also delicious when I used it with melted cheese like a grilled cheese sandwhich.  I will be making this again.

Very good Cornbread, I have made this many times.  I have added a can of corn or fresh cooked corn (chopped in food processor).    I have used this recipe and modified the sugar, depending what I am making, if I want it sweet (as written) or reducing sugar to 1/3 or 1/2 cup.  Always comes out great.  Thanks!

I made a 1/2 batch since I wasn't sure if my family would like this, but they all loved it and my 9 year old told me that cornbread was his favorite bread.  Thanks for a great recipe.  I'll have to make more next time.

I'm giving this 4 stars because I think it would have been great if I'd done the recipe exactly as called for, but because I didn't have all the ingredients on hand, I used whole wheat flour, 1 % milk and a 8 by 11 pan.  I only baked it 30 minutes but it came out very dry.  I'd give it 3 stars for the way I made it.  I think I should have cut down the baking time since I used a larger pan.  It tasted yummy though and if I microwaved individual pieces before serving it helped to soften it up.  Next time I'm going to try it in a cupcake pan (so my 4 year old will at least try it!) use buttermilk, and cut down the baking time. UPDATE: Still didn't have buttermilk but used a tablespoon of lemon juice as others suggested, used half whole wheat and half regular flour and made in cupcake pan.  I cooked them for about 15 minutes and they turned out great.  My picky boys still prefer the texture of Marie Callendars cornbread mix, but I think these are much tastier!

Made it with buttermilk, almond milk and regular milk all turned out really well. Very sweet, cake like corn bread.

This recipe is easy with staple ingredients. Will make again and again.

Dense and moist like pound cake - not the texture I was looking for, but good flavor.

Very good. I never liked the dry cornbread my mother used to make from the boxed mix. This is very moist and sweet and also a good base recipe if you wanted to add to it. I made it exactly as written except for melting the butter in a mixing bowl in the microwave. I left the batter in the fridge overnight and baked for 40 minutes, since it was cold. It was not dry or overcooked.

Delicious!! Followed the recipe almost exact but used my cast iron skillet to bake it. I also chopped up some jalapeños and added it to the batter which gave it a sweet n spicy combo!!

I picked this recipe over Golden Sweet Cornbread because the reviews for the latter indicated it was rather crumbly. I didn't have buttermilk on hand and used milk and 2 tbsp of yogurt instead. Overall the flavour was excellent, but it gets 4 stars because my cornbread stuck a little to the base of my non-stick pan and it was more crumbly than I expected. Nonetheless delicious! Definitely a recipe to be repeated.

Awesome!  My wife loves cornbread, and me not so much.  I found this recipe to use when I have leftover buttermilk when I make biscuits.  This is so fast and easy to make (even for my wife LOL) and it smells so good.  I tried a piece out of curiosity and well now I am a fan of cornbread.  Much better than the store bought box mixes my wife grew up on.

I just got my lodge logic corn bread pan and wanted to try it out. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used Wheylow instead. Used 1/2 cut white 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal. Self rising flour so as not to mess with the baking powder but I still added a pinch of salt. Didn't use as much butter cause I just put a dab in each corn bread stick to melt it in my oven and then poured what would come out into my mix. Also added onion!! AND used a little vinegar in regular milk cause I didn't have buttermilk. I did bake it at the same temp though!!LOL GREAT!

Excellent taste, however the texture was a little dense for me.  I just prefer a fluffier cornbread.

Absolutely wonderful cornbread. Super super sweet. I was making it to go with Taco Soup and it was too sweet for my tastes with that particular meal. However, I could have just eaten the cornbread for dinner. My husband thought it was a little undercooked, but I think it was simply that it was so moist and sweet that it seemed doughy because it was completely cooked through.

This was weird. It came out really spongy and not crumbly like what I'm used to. It had good flavor but a really strange consistency. The only change I made was to cut sugar to 1/2 cup.

This was the best homemade cornbread I have ever eaten.  The only thing I did differently was to melt the butter in an iron skillet and then poured into a bowl and mixed the rest of the ingredients.  Poured the contents back in the skillet, which was already greased and baked.  It only took 22 minutes to bake in an 8-inch skillet.  Wonderful recipe.  Will make from now on instead of Jiffy mix.

This was the tastiest and moistest cornbread I ever had. I cut down the sugar to a 1/3 cup and it was just sweet enough. I melted the butter in the microwave, then mixed in all of the ingrediants as directed. Instead of baking the cornbread in a pan I made 12 muffins instead and baked them for about 15 minutes. Thanks for the great recipe I will be making this alot.

I followed this recipe exactly.  I used fresh-milled corn and soft-white wheat berries for the cornmeal and flour.  This is hands-down the best cornbread I have ever made.  PERIOD!  I may use a tad less sugar next time, but the texture and taste were nothing short of divine.  I'm completely impressed!

Best. Cornbread.  Ever.  Used the wrapper from the butter to grease the baking dish, melted the butter in the microwave, made buttermilk (1TBspoon vinegar to a cup of milk), mixed everything together, and baked for 30 minutes.  Never buying Jiffy again!

Love this recipe and the family loves it too.  I didn't make any changes other than making the buttermilk myself (1 Tbsp lemon juice to 1 Cup of milk), The recipe is great as written and I will be making this a lot in the future.

I will never buy a box of jiffy again! I used whole wheat flour and baked it for 31 minutes at 375 degrees. I was worried about how this would taste with whole wheat, but this is the best cornbread I have ever tasted.  Thanks for sharing.

This was really, really dry.  I'm not sure why it came out so dry for me.  I followed the recipe exactly, didn't think I over-mixed it, and baked it for 30 minutes.  It definitely did not make a moist cornbread for me.  I won't be making again, unfortunately.

Fabulous recipe!  I've been looking for a moist cornbread recipe and this is it!  I took the suggestions of others & reduced sugar to 1/2 cup & used 1/2 yellow, 1/2 white cornmeal. I made mini loaves & baked in the toaster oven. I made the buttermilk w/milk & lemon juice as another suggested (I let it sit 5 minutes to thicken).  This will be a recipe I will share with family & friends!!  Can't wait to bring some loaves to my parents!!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2c. and added 1/4c. diced jalapeno. Very nice.  It's even better sliced thin and toasted in the toaster.

Just tried this (my first time making corn bread).  Turned out perfect!  The only change I made was to halve the amount of sugar...didn't want really sweet cornbread because I was adding some diced jalapeno and grated cheddar.  Baked in muffin tins for 20 minutes and they turned out moist and tasty.

LOVE this recipe! I make this every time I cook up Chili. It's moist and sweet but not overly sweet. FYI - once I didn't have milk on hand, so I substituted with water and it still turned out awesome!

I loved this recipe!  I did it just as written, and it was moist, dense, and just the right amound of sweet.  Yum!  I melted the butter in the pan on low, so it didn't get too hot (didn't want to cook the eggs when I poured them in the butter).  I did mix the dry ingredients in a bowl, and beat the eggs in a bowl, but just to get that all measured out while waiting for the butter to melt, and then dumped it in.  Very easy and yummy--never buy boxed mix again!

Super recipe!  Really easy and delicious. I substituted fat free yogurt for the buttermilk and it still came out great!  Big hit with the family.

Made the recipe to a T.  I've never  liked cornbread, but made this for my husband who has to have cornbread with his chili. The whole family loved it, including me. This is the only cornbread we make now. It doesnt get better than this.

A tad bit too sweet than what I'm used to for cornbread, but overall an excellent recipe.  This is my second time making.  It's definitely a keeper.

Excellent recipe! My duaghter, who does not eat cornbread, loves this and eats it with the rest of us. My son is begging for more on a daily! The only thing that I did differently, at the request of my husband, is added about one cup of corn. He eats one pan by himself!

Best cornbread recipe I've tried yet! Very moist and good buttery flavor. I used powdered buttermilk instead of regular and turned the broiler on for the last couple minutes of cooking to get a nice browned top.

This is a delicious recipe. I cut the sugar to 1/2c., and think next time will use 1/2c. + 1 tbsp. of sugar for a tad more sweetness. Also, I baked it for 30 minutes @ 375 degrees, and it came out a little dry and crumbly. My oven may run hot, so I'll check it at 20 minutes next time. Will definitely make again though!

This cornbread is delicious!  I baked it in a pre-warmed 9" iron frying pan because it seemed more traditional that way.  My husband skipped the butter he normally puts on everything and said, as he ate his third piece, that he thought with just a little ice cream it would make a dandy dessert!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Awesome recipe! Followed it word for word and it turned out great. Wouldn't change anything about it. Had to make my own buttermilk because I didn't have any in the house (combine 1 cup of milk with 1 Tablespoon of lemon juice or vinegar and let sit for 5 - 10 minutes). Still tasted amazing!

this recipe is unbelievably better than the box stuff (and I like the box stuff).  Super dense and moist, it's amazing.  You can add a tbs. of vinegar to 1 cup of milk as a substitute for butter milk.  You have to try this.

I'll never make any other cornbread again!  Very sweet, buttery, and moist.  It tastes more like cake than cornbread!  Mmm!  I didn't melt the butter on the stove, just in the microwave, and it turned out great.

Ok...I grew up on cornbread for nearly every meal, and never thought it would be possible to find a recipe better than my dads, but I just did.  This is amazing!  Followed the directions exactly and it turned out perfect.  I have made it twice now.  Once in a regular glass dish and the other in a preheated cast iron skillet.  Greate either way but, out of this world in the cast iron!!!  I highly recommend this recipe and have made it my new staple.

Very tasty and easy to make! This is very sweet though, so definitely not for everyone! I couldn't find buttermilk at my grocery store so I used milk and replaced 1 tbsp with lemon juice and let it sit for a few minutes. I also used a pie plate instead of a baking pan.

I made this recipe for a family dinner and it was tasty (I'll never pass up on cornbread!) However, it did turn out a little dry. I only timed it for half an hour after reading the author's revision post but it was still rather crumbly/dry. Next time I think I'll use a shorter time. Other than that, the taste was good and it was simple to make!

I finally found my cornbread recipe! I prefer my cornbread to be not as sweet, so I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup. Loved it! I will definitely make again.

Great cornbread.  Tasted sweet and buttery.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe, but I do like one reviewer's idea of adding fresh corn.

LOVE this recipe!  I mix everything in the cast iron pan and then stick the pan directly in the oven for 25 minutes (I have a convection that cooks things super fast).  Best homemade corn bread I've ever tasted AND there are no dirty dishes to clean!! :)

This is an awesome recipe for homemade southern cornbread!  I cooked mine in a cast iron skillet.  I had to reduce the time for cooking to 25 mins. I melted my butter the in cast iron skillet and I mixed my other ingrediants in a different bowl and poured the final mixture back into the cast iron skillet.  Everyone loved it!  I will never use another cornbread recipe again!

Great recipe! I cut the cook time to 20 minutes and Wah-Lah! It was moist! I actually set the time for 30 minutes but I have a little thing I do-When I can smell the food I have cooking-it is usually done-so when I smelled the cornbread, I checked it and yes-out came a clean toothpick. I removed from the oven and it is great! I like sweet cornbread with chili. This is a really good recipe. Some people may want to cut back on the sugar but I liked it! Thanks for sharing.

Made this recipe for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit!  I was cooking for a large crowd so I doubled the recipe, reduced the sugar to just 1/2 cup (instead of 1 1/3), and add half a small can of corn; otherwise followed the recipe.  Baked it for 30 minutes in a 9x13 pan.  The bread was sweet enough with the reduced amount of sugar and I can't imagine how sweet it would be with the full amount.  It came out super moist and buttery, probably could have used another few minutes in the oven.  After dinner, people were smothering slices of cornbread with my homemade cranberry sauce and eating it like strawberry shortcake!

First time Corn Bread maker...great recipe.  I made it this way 1/4 cup of sugar...I do not like very sweet cornbread nor does my family so 2/3 cups was too much  1/2 cup butter...It was just right  1 cup cornmeal and 1 cup Bisquick.  The Bisquick makes the cornbread rise and fluffier in the inside.   1 cup of half and half with 1 teaspoon of lemon juice. I did not have buttermilk.  I followed everything else.

Made these for Thanksgiving Dinner that I had a week early 11/21.  I followed exactly except added 2 T honey to the batter and made into corn muffins and baked for 15 minutes.  They came out so moist and perfect!  Thanks for a winner!  So easy too and so much better than the Jiffy mix ones.  I am making them to take to a dinner on Thanksgiving day as well!

My 10 yr old son said to me one night, 'Mom, I have to make cornbread for the 4H contest tomorrow.' What?!  What contest?  i only make cornbread from a box!  Found this recipe, he and i made it, and it was fabulous.  He won the blue ribbon!  Now, he wants to make it for every meal.  I love having him in the kitchen with me.  His review: it tastes like cake with no icing!

These were perfect, the other recipe I used the cornbread was to cakey.  These were dense with just enough corn flavor and sweetness, the perfect combination for my tastes.  This recipe is a keeper!!

This turned out nice and moist.  I added some canned corn about half a cup to add some texture to the bread.  Scrumptuous and simple.  Thank you to the added notes.

I'm always leary about cornbread because it can be dry.  This was by far the best cornbread I've ever had.  My husband, who isn't a huge fan of cornbread, said it was great and to make it again.  You can't go wrong with this recipe..it's a winner.

Very good. I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 c, and it doesn't taste overly sweet. Making this in a mini muffin tin worked well, but it sticks to paper liners. Without the liners, it browned nicely.   If you decide to make muffins, position the rack closer to the top so they will brown, and reduce the baking time to 10 minutes for the mini ones, and test with a toothpick. Not overbaking is crucial to keeping them moist  I have tried them less sweet, as well as with a tiny ammount (1/4tsp) of fresh rosemary. Both are delicious with a dab of honey butter or plain!

Let me say this recipe is FANTASTIC!! Speaking as a yankee, not too sure what southern cornbread is supposed to taste like, all I know is from a jiffy box. I found this recipe, tried it out, omg, I will NEVER eat from the box again!! Absolutely the most delicious cornbread any of us have had in this house! I followed the recipe, WORD for WORD, just added a can of sweet kernel corn for texture, came out perfect! 26-30 mins, perfection!

The cornbread came out good but I've had better so I don't know if i will try it again. I liked the fact that it required minimum prep time and easy clean up afterwards. However, I did change the recipe to accommodate to my needs: doubled amounts, used whole wheat flour instead, added 1 C of fresh corn, and decreased sugar by half. The texture was somewhat crumbly. I used a preheated cast iron skillet & total baking time was 25 min. only.

I always use this recipe now for making cornbread!  I often substitue plain yogurt (Greek/European style is ideal for texture) for the buttermilk just because I am more likely to have that on hand.  A friend had made this, and I asked her for the recipe, and it's gotten a lot of compliments in the many times I've made it.  She also tossed in a can of corn to the mixed batter, and that was a nice touch.  I've added some honey or some grated cheese at times for a nice touch, and you could be creative with some fun add-ins to this great base, but it's also completely delicious and wonderful just as it is!

Made this tonight for dinner after having only made cornbread with Jiffy. Never again will I use that because this was simply amazing! The flavor was great and my father just knew it was "that real cornbread" as soon as he saw it. Great recipe.

I love this cornbread!  I've made it three or four times now, and I eat way too many pieces every time.  Last night I made it for a chili cookoff and it got rave reviews.  I've used normal and coarse ground cornmeal and both are good and I've used buttermilk and also soured milk with vinegar.  Both work great.  Thanks!  (I am going to try a little less sugar next time...it IS very sweet, but it's very good.)

Followed the recipe to a tee and it was wonderful, just the right amount of sweetness, I did use whole grain flour and it adds some nice color to the bread.  I new family favorite!

Another perfect cornbread recipe from this site...Did not change a thing....moist and just perfectly sweet. Made for an Oktoberfest along side of chili. My company loved it. Loved the buttermilk aspect in this recipe. Thanks and will make again.

I made muffins out of these and they turned out very nice! I filled a regular muffin tin about 3/4 of the way and baked for 25 minutes. I would had more salt to the recipe, up to to a full teaspoon next time.

This cornbread was delicious and a huge hit at a potluck.  I followed the recipe exactly but had to bake it a little longer - maybe 10 more minutes.  I also added about 3/4 cup of frozen corn (thawed).  I highly recommend this recipe.  I will make it again very soon!

I made this last night with Deb's chili recipe (all from allrecipes).  I added a small can of diced green chilies and about 3/4 cup of whole kernel sweet corn to add a little more flavor and texture.  Served warm from the oven, it was sweet, cake-like, and so delicious!  My boyfriend loved it too.  This recipe is a winner.  Very easy to make!

Delicious golden cornbread! Just made these for a big family BBQ that my sister and I hosted. Easy to make and not too sweet. I followed the recipe exactly but the bread was still a lil dry. I think I'll add a lil oil next time.   Using a cast iron skillet was defnitely a must!

We added whole kernel corn to this because we like it that way. Otherwise made it exactly as called for in the recipe. Very good. Lightly sweet (not overly sweet for us) and we found it quite buttery (could smell the butter in the kitchen). My husband even said it smelled like a batch of hot butered sweet corn as I passed by holding the platter. Thanks for the recipe.

If you like dense cornbread like me, this is the ticket! I did not have buttermilk on hand, so I improvised by adding 2 Tbls of fresh lemon juice to one cup of low fat milk- and let that sit for about 10 minutes. It came out perfect. It is a dense cornbread as I said before, and because of that it was very filling. I doubled the batch and have one in the freezer for a future dinner, and I am so happy I did, because this now my 'go to' recipe for cornbread from now on. I served it with pork and black bean chili and it was a huge hit with everyone. (very picky eaters I might add). LOVE THIS recipe!

My husband loves cornbread and has tried many, many recipes to get a nice, moist result.  I made this exactly as directly and he said it was the best cornbread he has ever tasted or made.  Thank you Grandmother - for the wonderful recipe.  I am sure we will be making this again and again.  Perfectly sweet, and moist.

This has got to be the best cornbread recipe that I've come across yet.  I've been looking for sometime for a sweet, cake like recipe and this is it.  My kids and husband absolutely love it every time I make it.  It is easy to prepare and worth the extra time it takes as oppose to using Jiffy mix.

I love love this recipe! I made this recipe once for a potluck at work and now everytime we have a potluck they beg me to bring my cornbread.   I am not one for following recipes exactly. I always modify them to my liking. However, this recipe is so good I don't change anything when I make it.

Perfect.  What is to add?  Obviously you can add corn of varies types, creamed, whole, mexican or jalapeno's.  Cooking it in a cast iron skillet, I only wish I had one because that would make it cripier, yum yum....  Of course you can variate the sugar But basic recipe I have found.  Delicious!  Thank-you

Very good cornbread. I made it exactly except I forgot to put the salt in. I made this to serve with my chili for a chili contest at my campground.  The cornbread got snatch up quickly and I didn't see any left overs on people's plates.

NOMNOMNOM! I love sweet cornbread! And this was exactly that. If you want just a basic, sweet, insanely moist cornbread than this is the recipe! Great with honey in the morning or with old fashioned pinto beans (just add more salt with the beans).

Most excellent as written.  I thought I would read other reviews and add the corn but the family loved it w/o.  Great recipe as is.

This was a good recipe, but i could really taste the difference between this and a box recipe from the store... :( kinda bummed out about it... I wish there was more buttermilk flavor... but it was lacking.  It still tasted great! like cornbread should... just wish there was more flavor was all. :)

This recipe didn't work very well for me. I followed it exactly, and it was still doughy in the center after the maximum cook time. The top burned by the time it was completely cooked in the center. I'm really disappointed...

DELISH! Moist, sweet, with just enough "crunch" from the cornmeal. Like others, i reduced sugar down to 1/2 cup but I used the rest of the sugar to coat the baking pan (see below).  I didn't change anything else regarding ingredients, but couldn't bring myself to pour raw eggs into hot butter and sugar.  So I lightly whisked the eggs & added them to the buttermilk.  I added the remaining dry ingredients to the pan with the melted butter and sugar mixture and then  mixed in the buttermilk and eggs til moistened thoroughly, and poured them into an 8-inch square pan lightly that I had coated with shortening and sprinkled with granulated sugar.  It makes a delicious crunchy,slightly sweet crust.  Definitely a keeper. Simple and Yummy.

Yum! Absolutely excellent. :) Just a few mistakes, 100% on my part. Didn't have buttermilk or normal milk.. Yeah, so just used half & half and added just a little vinegar (milk + vinegar can kind of be substituted for buttermilk. Asking amount of buttermilk, 1 cup + 1 teaspoon of vinegar). I put the batter into a muffin tray AND a cake pan. Tastes great!

This is really good! Its not at all like the cornbread i had growing up- which is why i like it! This is a sweet bread more like the kind you find individually wrapped at grocery stores sold along side the rotisery chicken.  This recipe is awsome- my boyfriend who doesnt like corn bread even asked for seconds of this!

I loved this grown-up cornbread.  My family tried 3 from this site & it was my favorite.  It placed second with by other 2 family members.  I love that it has whole wheat.  This is a bit healthier than the one the boys liked best.

This is fantastic and I now have to make it on a weekly basis to keep my wife happy. Some substitutions: we use corn flour instead of corn meal because otherwise there are little hard bits in the bread and we were afraid of cracking a tooth. However, that substitution loses some of the texture. To restore it, use 1.5 cups corn flour and 1/2 cup of white flour instead of equal parts.

Delicious, sweet cornbread recipe. Mine ended up a little dry, but that may be my oven more so than the recipe. Will definitely try again!

Mmm-mm-mmm-mm-mm! I can't say enough good things about this cornbread... just, wow. I cut it into eight servings, and my mum ate two in a short sitting!  I reduced the sugar to .5c, added 100g flaked almonds and 1/4c dessicated coconut, the latter because I'm trying to beat the expiry date. It turned out great! I also added 1/4c buttermilk (sour milk where I come from) to counter the added dry ingredients. I had wanted to add a large overripe banana but couldn't find it! And to think I only wanted to bake this because of the banana!  Another website includes a cup of grated cheese, which they said is optional, so maybe next time I'll add it.  This is my first real experience with cornbread (I may have eaten store-bought versions), so when it didn't change colour after 30 minutes I baked it for another 15. Next time I'll reduce the time to 35 minutes and see if it's more moist. But, WOW!

Fantastic!  This cornbread tasted better than Jiffy!  Which I grew up on so I was very pleased...as were my family...coworkers!  It said to bake for 30-40 minutes but I only baked for 30 and I may only bake for 25 next time.  Great recipe!!

Great recipe. 30 mins was perfect. Rubbed some butter over it as soon as it came out of oven. Very moist and even better the next day. Love my new cornbread recipe.

Amazing recipe and super easy to make! I had never made cornbread before and I followed this recipe...it was soooo tasty and easy. Next time I will add a little more sugar and just a smidge less flour, as well as oil as opposed to grease the pan with butter. The butter browned and created a browned edge. All and all, this is a 5 star recipe!

I pan fried in butter with a sealed lid like pancakes to reduce cooking time and make a fun flat hushpuppy/pancake type cornbread. :)  Very tasty recipe both ways!

I've tried many cornbread recipes over the years, and finally hit pay dirt with this one. Just the right amount of sweetness and the best thing...it doesn't crumble. Split a  piece in half and spread with butter and honey....SUPERB !!!

This is definitly a 5 star recipe! FANTASTIC cornbread! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup (personal prefence). Baked for exactly 30 minutes and it was exceptionally moist, not dry or crumbly as some are. I was afraid that without baking powder it would not rise enough. When I poured the batter in the pan it seemed awful thin, but when it finished baking it had risen beautifully. Looking forward to bringing it to a chicken BBQ next week. UPDATE: I subbed maple syrup for the sugar and it was even better!!!!

I made this last week to accompany some chili. Like some others suggested I halved the sugar. They had a nice flavor but were a bit more cake-like than I care for in cornbread. The boyfriend really did not like them at all. I will try a different recipe next time.

I made this to pair with a spicy beef chili I made, and was told by several people it was the "best cornbread they've ever had".  Very moist and good!  I did make slight changes - reduced sugar a bit and added a half can of sweet corn kernels (drained).  Fabulous!

I have made this recipe every Monday for several weeks, and everyone in my family has liked it very much with butter and honey on it.  This week I separated the egg whites, beat them to soft peak stage, and then gently folded them in before spooning the batter into muffin cups.  The finished product was so light and moist that everyone ate them plain, with no butter or honey.

I made the cornbread in a cast iron skillet in the oven, and it was amazing. I followed another reviewer's suggestion and only put it in the oven for 25 minutes. It was cooked perfectly. 40 minutes would have burnt it. Also, I only used 1/3 cup sugar and it was still sweet.

Fantastic cornbread! A few alterations: We use a 12" cast iron skillet to bake it in, and a 1   1/2 recipe version (e.g. 3/4 cup butter) and add a drained can of corn and 1 T Polander's Red Jalapenos to the batter.  So good!

By far the BEST cornbread i have ever made.  Super moist, dense and oh-so sweet!! :)  The only changes I made were: 1) I was out of buttermilk so i replaced it with an equal amount of sour cream. 2) I added a little honey to the batter (because I like it really sweet.) 3) I preheated my baking pan for about 8 minutes before pouring the batter in. and 4) I baked it for only 30 minutes.    Everyone LOVED it...I can't wait to make this again! :)

I keep buttermilk on hand just so I can make this recipe on a regular basis.   I melt the butter in the microwave and do mix all the ingredients in a large bowl just because when I've tried to do it all in my cast iron I make a mess when stirring.   Great recipe that I always get rave reviews on.

I liked this recipe a lot although I did add 1/4 can of whole kernel corn which added to the interest and texture of the recipe. Family declared if they were to spend their carbs on any food, they would eat this cornbread! Love the taste would make again

This is the best cornbread recipe I have tried.  Moist, delicious.  I made indiviual portions and froze the leftovers.  Ate this from the freezer up to 6 wks later and it was still delicous.

I love cornbread and of all the recipes I have tried in my 35 years of cooking (since I was ten?), this recipe takes the prize. I took this to a 4th of July picnic. It was devoured in 5 minutes flat.  I tried it out the night before on my husband and a bunch of teenagers. I doubled the recipe but forgot to double the flour. I loved it - very moist. When I prepared it correctly the on the 4th, it was also very delicious. The difference? On the 3rd it was quite moist and more dense. On the 4th it was still moist enough, but it was a little more crumbly like cornbread usually is. Wish I could give this recipe 10 stars.

So so good. This is like a dessert! I added a bit more cornmeal for the flavor, and a bit less sugar.

This was really good!  I know some people prefer a less sweet cornbread but for me and my fam this was great =)  I paired it up with some honey butter which was so superb! My mouth is watering just thinking about it! -_-; Thanks!

I was looking for a cornbread recipe, found this one and saw it got 5 stars.  I don't care much for cornbread, but LOVE this one! It's awesome! My husband ate 3/4 of one cake, and I attacked whatever was left of it. So I had to make 2 more!  Thanks for an AWESOME recipe!          Karen

Tastes exactly like jiffy mix cornbread. Which is nice since we like that and can't buy it in Canada. Very good. Will reduce sugar slightly and soak corn meal in buttermilk next time.

This corn bread was awesome! I made it as stated and my family raved about it with their mouths full. I will make this over and over again. Goes great with chili or as a substitute for a bun with sloppy joes.

Lordy, Lordy! Best cornbread that I have EVER made! Followed the recipe exactly as written. I lightly mixed after adding the flour/cornmeal. I think that is really the ticket. Well, that and all the butter and sugar. Wooooo!

First time making cornbread myself and it came out perfectly. However it did not have the texture or fluffiness that I expected in cornbread. Would like to try it with chunks of corn in it as well.

I have been looking for a fantastic cornbread recipe and failed for many years; until I found this one.  I just mixed it all in one pot, greased a cast iron pan.  We loved it!  My Mom who doesn't  like cornbread said it was wonderful.  It is great with some chicken or chili.

Amazing! This was moist and everyone at the dinner party loved it. A few people who are not big cornbread fans loved this so I think that's always a good sign. I will make this again for sure!  I did bake mine for only 25 minutes though and it was perfectly done. I think that 30 would have dried it out a bit.

I'm not a big fan of cornbread but thought it would go well with the Old Settlers Baked Beans I just made from this site. Well, it is a perfect match for the beans and I may be a fan of cornbread from now on this stuff is good!

Good, but needs to be tweaked a little for our preferences. I expected it to be buttery and crumbly, not sweet and gritty. The recipe does not state what kind of cornmeal to use so I bought "medium", which made the cornbread gritty. Definitely going to buy the "fine" one next time! Also, the sugar needs to be cut in half as I found it much too sweet. We didn't  have buttermilk but did the old milk-to-lemon juice thing as a substitute. This recipe can easily be tweaked, and I like the suggestion of adding canned corn to the bread.

I made it exactly by the recipe except I melted the butter in a cast iron skillet in the pre-heated oven and then mixed everything in the skillet and baked it that way.  Delicious.

Amazing flavors (made it 1/2c. whole wheat, 1/2c. white flour)!!! Stays wonderfully moist and has the perfect undertone of sweetness to it (I personally cd go w/out syrup, but hubby likes it sweeter)!!! Definitely my new standard cornbread recipe! Thank you so much for sharing!!!

This recipe is okay, and I followed it to a T. It was perfectly golden brown when I took it out of the oven. For having this much cholesterol in it, I was hoping it would be better. It tastes like a basic cornbread recipe that you can make from a box. While the cornbread was tasty, I don't think I will make it again. I have a better recipe that I will stick to.

I've been looking for a sweet, moist, buttery cornbread recipe for awhile. I'm happy to say that i've finally found one! Thanks for an awesome recipe. The only change I made was to make my own buttermilk with milk and lemon juice. Worked great!

Yummy!  I made it exactly as the recipe states and it is awesome.  Like Jiffy Mix but lighter and fluffier.  Delicious!

Amazing!  I don't know what else to say really.  Very simple and the best cornbread I've ever had!  They have a sweetness to them.  You don't need a lot of honey or anything to make these better.  Just eat it plain.

Yup. This is a very good 'yankee-cornbread' recipe. While mixing, I added the soda and buttermilk last, for a little better finish texture. I up'd the servings to 12, for a better rise in a 9 inch skillet ('kindda like a thicker cornbread). I fried a strip of smoked bacon for a little oil in the skillet (ate the bacon) and placed in the oven while preping the mix - gave it a slight rustic taste redolent of an open fire and a terriffic crust. 5 stars! Thanks Bethany!

Made this just today 5/10/10, to go with some white bean and ham soup. I made in muffins and they were absolutely delicious. Some reviews stated that it was too sweet, but it was perfect for me and my family. I even made honey butter to go with them. I will never try another cornbread recipe again, because this is the best.

This was so good!! I didn't have any buttermilk but I made 'sour milk' by putting 1 tbsp vinegar in a measuring cup adding milk to make a cup. A lot of people don't know that buttermilk is low fat! Yes, it's basically skim milk with flavor!! Look it up. I just forgot to pick it up at the market. :-) It turned out perfect. Moist & dense, great texture & almost a crispy crust on top. Yummy! (And I've gone thru more than a few recipes looking for a decent one)

Was Excellent---and shamefully simple to make! My fiance and I devoured half the recipe with steaks and salad, and the other half was gone at breakfast the following day!   This was my first cornbread, so I was cautiously optimistic. The buttermilk was JUST the right ingredient, it adds a fragrance and 'grannie-made' taste that is wonderful. The only thing I would recommend is to bake it for only about 30 min and watch it if you're oven tends to hot.   GL! It was superb.

Truly one of the best recipes I have found for cornbread. Just the right amount of sweetness. I will be trying to make a more savory version with jalapeno juice and dried red pepper flakes. But as it stands, an excellent recipe.

Fantastic. It was moist and didn't taste flaky like most corn breads.   Kept its moisture for a very long time.

That was hands down the best cornbread I have ever eaten. I used powdered buttermilk, otherwise made it as written. Yummy said my tummy! My son liked it so much he actually told me it was good (usually only comments on stuff he doesn't like)

All the cornbread I've had, that I can remember, has been dry and has needed about 3 lbs of butter to remedy.  This was perfect!!!  Nice and moist without taking away from that classic cornbread taste ^_^

Great cornbread. Used a bit less sugar, would probably use even less the next time, didn't have buttermilk so used soured milk and used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. Would make again.

This is the BEST BEST BEST cornbread. Everyone agreed that this was amazing. I used just a half cup of sugar which was perfect as some people topped theirs with honey. Perfect consistency, just the right amount of density and crumble!

Fantastic!  My husband and I loved this recipe.  We had it with homemade chili from this site (It's Chili by George!!).  I reduced the sugar and baked it in a preheated cast iron skillet.  It makes a beautiful, thick, heavy cornbread that holds up well to dipping in chili.

I have tried a couple of different cornbread recipes in the past but they never had the sweetness that I craved.  This one was spot on.  I did follow the advice of a few other reviewers and I used a preheated cast iron skillet to cook the cornbread in (about 25 mins) and it turned out great.

This was OK. I wanted to try a sweet recipe since I had never had one except jiffy mix, which I hate. This is definitively better than jiffy but I still prefer unsweet cornbread. It was also crumbly for some reason. I like to be able to dip my cornbread in my soup, beans, greens or whatever I'm eating. This fell apart.

I just made this and it is by far the best cornbread I have EVER tasted.  I can't believe I just made this...  Bravo - made in one pot also just like the author suggests - which made for super easy clean up.  Super moist and just a bit sweet and buttery!  Once again - YUM - makes my knees buckle just a bit.  I'll make sure I'm sitting down next time I cut a piece - LOL!

very good! Use only half the amount of sugar and if you use it as a base for an enchilada dish then use even less or omit altogether. If you're in a hurry, preheat your cast iron skillet in the oven and bake it in there. Took way less time to cook.

I made this as is and it was just what I want out of my cornbread. I was surprised how moist it was and how easy it was to make. I used a 9X9 pan. Next time I'll try adding corn and cheese.

Oh my - this is THE BEST cornbread I have ever tasted!  I ususally pour tons of honey on my cornbread and I didn't have to use any at all - it was so good!  I made a box cornbread last minute when my in-laws came over a couple days after making this and I thought the box cornbread was so gross after eating this recipe!  I will ONLY make this recipe from now on!!!

Excellent recipe! Now I don't need to buy boxed mixes any more. So many of us are "stressed" for time that we rely too often on boxed foods, when there are quick, easy and delicious recipes available---and this is one!

Awsome!  I didn't have corn meal so I used a small box mix in place of the corn meal and used a little less flour.  It turned out like corn cake- so yummy and moist.  The best mistake I made that day.  :-)

Wow this was (is) good. Dense and moist but not too much so. I did make it in a preheated cast skillet and that made the crust  delicious. Thank you for this one!

Holy moly, this is great cornbread!!!!!  It is incredibly moist, really good, and completely better than the standard cornbread I usually make!  I will be sure to make up a batch every time I have some extra buttermilk on hand!

This was delish!!!  I had some extra buttermilk I needed to use and looked up recipes and glad I came across this gem!  I made chili and this cornbread and it was a hit.  I might add a little more sugar or a bit of honey next time as I like mine a tad bit sweeter.  But this was sooo good!  The perfect texture and easy to make.  Definitely a keeper!

Yum! I did it exactly as the recipe said, except added a can of corn and cooked it in a preheated iron skillet to give it that crispy crust. A great recipe I'd make again and again...my family absolutely loved it.

Wow.  This was my first attempt at cornbread and I don't think I'll ever need to look for another recipe.  I made it exactly as is, only doubled the recipe and added some bacon drippings that just happened be sitting on my stove from the day before.  Just tasted my first bite warm from the oven with some butter on it... mmm...  It's supposed to be for our BBQ dinner tomorrow, but I think I may have to make a second batch before then.  It's too good to just let sit!

Australians don't grow up with cornbread, this recipe was my first attempt and it was great, very easy and very tasty. Like others I cut down the sugar to 1/3 cup and I cooked it in a hot skillet. And I did the trick of melting a couple of spoons of butter over the top, which is not in the slightest bit healthy but oh so tasty. Next time I wil try adding some green chilies. Thanks!

This cornbread is moist yet hardy.  Good for soaking up chili or other main dishes that would complement cornbread.

This corn bread is delicious.  And, also is very easy to make.  I can make it for lunch, as a last minute decision; it goes great with chili.  Thanks for sharing it!

This is the very first thing that I ever baked. It was delicious! I can't believe that I waited till the age of 54 to bake something. It was easy! This is just the beginning. I'm so happy that I discovered  Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread. I can't praise it enough. Thank you!

I've always used Jiffy Cornbread because I thought it was just as good as homemade.  I was wrong, not afraid to admit it.  I absolutely love this recipe and thank Bethany for sharing it.  This is my go to cornbread recipe and I look forward to making and eating it.  I make it exactly as written and it works perfect every time.  I sometimes make muffins instead of cooking in a pan and the only thing you have to change is the amount of time.  I think it takes around 15 to 20 minutes in a muffin pan.

This cornbread had amazing flavor, I wish I would have followed the recipe a little more closely, or just added a bit more liquid (or maybe an extra egg).... mine turned out a little bit too crumbly for my taste, but the flavor was amazing.  I tend to always change recipes, so instead of the 1 cup butter milk I used 1/4 c whipping cream, 2/3 cup organic 2% milk, about 2-3 tablespoons sour cream, and a tablespoon of lemonjuice.  Everything else was basically the same, except I used 1/2 a cup white flour, and 1/2 a cup whole wheat flour.  I did it exactly for 30 minutes, and it was definitely ready.  The only reason I did not give a 5 was b/c i had wished it was a little less crumbly

DELICOUS! I will never consider using another corn bread recipe ever! This is slightly sweet, moist and a wonderful compliment to almost every meal. It is never left over. If you are looking for a "can't go wrong" recipe... this is it! I make it just as recipe states... no modifications.

This cornbread is very fluffy, thick, and full of flavor. After reading reviews, I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup. I did not have buttermilk, so I used what I had, skim milk. Also, used whole wheat flour in place of regular flour. Very good recipe and easy. Will definitely use again. My husband loved it. WARNING: YOU WILL EAT MORE THAN ONE PIECE!!!

OMG I will never use a corn bread mix again!  I have made this three nights in a row - the only thing I don't do is melt butter on stove.  I just melt in microwave and mix everything up in a bowl!  I have never had corn bread this good since my grandmothers...TOTALLY YUMMY!

I have made these a few times and they always come out so good!  Both times I made them, I completely forgot the buttermilk.  So I made my own buttermilk by putting two tablespoons of lemon juice and a little less than a cup of milk in a bowl.  Let it sit for five minutes and its instant buttermilk.  The cornbread still tastes great too!  My husband eats these until they are all gone.  Its a keeper!

Love it!  No adjustments necessary, I've finally found it.  Okay, I did use Splenda/sugar mixture, and a squirt of honey.  Also, heated my Crisco-d pyrex baking dish in the oven while preheating (and with a T of bacon grease in the pan).  Now I'm wondering if I can halve it and just make 6 muffins, since there are only two of us.

We love this recipe! I have been using it for a few years now with only one modification: cutting the sugar back to 1/2 cup. It is still plenty sweet that way. I loved it with 2/3 cup, but some others thought it was too sweet. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly. It is usually ready right at 30 minutes.

This was my first time making homemade cornbread and I must say that it turned out fabulous!! It was tender and moist, and had just the right amount of sweetness.  I made it the first time for Turkey Day and my family raved about it - in fact they even passed up my Granny's cornbread for mine.  I served it with some honey butter which complimented it well.  I will definitely add this one to my favorites!! Thanks so much! ;0)

This cornbread is moist and delicious.  I only gave it 4 stars because it's very sweet. We don't like our cornbread sweet so I've made the recipe with only 1/3 c sugar for a lightly sweet cornbread and I've made it with only 1/4 c sugar for my husband who prefers next to no sweetness in his cornbread.  I've made it in an 8 inch square pan, in a regular muffin pan and in a mini muffin pan. It's always a winner at our house!

Thank you for a great recipe!  Delicious!  I made it just as written I wanted a larger amount though but I didnt have enough corn meal for a double batch so I made a regular batch plus 1/2.  That left the problem of what to cook it in since it would be too much for a 9x9 pan not enough for a 9x13 pan, so I baked it in my new mini loaf pans at 350 for not quite 20 minutes.  Perfection!  I will be using this recipe lots!  No more yucky box mixes for us!

Too dense for me. I like a crispy on the outside cornbread and a bit of fluff on the inside.

This cornbread was absolutely amazing!! I followed the recipe exactly, and it turned out amazingly well.  It was so moist and tasty, that I found no need to add any butter to it when eating it.  We were eating the leftovers a few days later - and it was just as good as the first day!

Used original recipe's ingredients/yield except that... (1) I used 4 TBSPs SACO powdered cultured buttermilk mixed with 1 cup water, and (2) I used 3/4 of the required 2/3 cup white sugar. Baked it using a 9"-diameter, 1-1/2" tall round non-stick baking pan. Served it with "Honey Butter". Love it! NEXT TIME I'll... (1) Lower the oven temp from 375F to about 325F to 350F (2) Use 1/2 cup white sugar instead of 2/3 cup (3) Try another reviewer's ratio suggestion of 1-1/4 cup cornmeal & 3/4 cup flour.
Thanks for the recipe & reviews! :-)

Really delicious cornbread.  Lacking buttermilk, I added 1T white vinegar to the cup of milk and let it 'sour' for a few minutes.  Great flavor and texture to this bread.

Followed the advice of others and cooked in a preheated cast iron pan for 25 minutes.  Other than that I didn't change a thing and it was great!

Came out perfectly!  I added a 1/2 or so of canned corn, and took the suggestion to mix everything in the same pan before pouring into the baking pan.  Baked for 25 minutes.  Delicious!

My boyfriend  who has never baked before made this for me when I was sick. It came out wonderful! (from a girl who grew up eating cornbread) He baked it in a greased preheated cast iron skillet and it came out with a perfect crisp crust and perfect moist texture.  I liked the sweetness of the cornbread but might reduce the sugar next time.

I made it just as written except for two things. First I'm of the old school and I mixed the flour, cornmeal, and salt in a bowl separately before adding it to the liquid. The other change I would not have made, except my oven has gone on the fritz. The repair man said it will take up to two months to repair my oven, possibly sooner. So I cooked the cornbread in a cast iron skillet on the stove for about 30 minutes on low. My children loved it. I was very relieved to see that it turned out. If you do it on the stove make sure it has a lid and butter the pan after it is hot.  Thank you grandma for a wonderfull cornbread!!

This is the only cornbread I make! It's quick and easy and so good. I'd give it 10 stars if I could!

The consistency is too cake / bread - like for my tastes. Also, as written, I find it somewhat too sweet. Still, the buttermilk is a nice touch & next time, I'll replace 1/2 C of flour w/ corn meal & drop sugar to 1/2 C.

The taste between this and the Jiffy was, in my opinion, minimal. But this does have all fresh ingredients.

This has become our favorite cornbread recipe, it came out moist with just the right amount of sweetness and flavor, once you try it you'll know that nothing else will ever measure up to this cornbread recipe. I've made it 3 times in less than a month its delicious.

I have never reviewed a recipe here before but this cornbread was sooo good I just had to put in my two cents worth.  Absolutely, hands down, the very best cornbread recipe I have ever made.  Thank you, Grandmother!

This is a delicious cornbread that is very moist.  I did make some adaptions that increased the nutritional content significantly.  I used 1/4 c. molasses instead of sugar and whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  It still tasted great, but with a lot less carbs and sugar.  The molasses also added iron and other minerals.

It was OK.  I thought it was a little too dense for my taste. A little rubbery/waxy. Personally, I like a lighter texture--more open crumb.  Flavor was good.  I probably won't make again.

This is the best cornbread ever, and I've been making cornbread for 30 years! The only thing I changed was to decrease the sugar to 1/2 cup. My family gobbles it up, and it is a pleasure to serve to company.

Excellent! I love that you mix it in the skillet. I used wheat flour and it was fantastic. Even my kids, who often don't like cornbread, couldn't get enough. Easy and delicious.

I have searched for a great tasting corn bread recipe and this is it!  That said, I did not follow the directions for preparing.  I followed the simple muffin method.  Mix all dry ingredients together in one bowl.  Mix wet ingredients in another (make sure buttermilk and eggs are not straight-out-of-the fridge cold or the butter will get grainy.  I mix the buttermilk and eggs together in a 2-cup measuring cup then microwave for 20 seconds just to take the chill off).  Add wet ingredients to dry and mix JUST UNTIL BLENDED.  Do not overmix!  I baked this at 400 degrees for 25 minutes.  Yum!

Very good. Not the southern-style cornbread that I'm used to but still good.  I thought it was too sweet, even after halving the sugar.  I do think it needed more salt.  And next time, I'll add the eggs last.  I ended up with bits of cooked egg whites in the final product.

This is fabulous!  I made it with wheat flour.  If only there was a way to make it healthier.  I COULD EAT THE ENTIRE PAN!  I made it with a more course cornmeal and it is still fantastic; just a little crunchy

Awesome cornbread. Tastes great, stays together. Even my NC native husband said it's better than he was raised with!  We baked it in an iron skillet like his mama did... [We did cut the sugar a tad]

This recipe is the BEST cornbread I have ever had.  I have searched for a decent recipe and my search is over thanks to Bethany and her grandmother.  It is moist, tasty and easy.

Best cornbread I have ever made!  Didn't have any buttermilk, so used milk and lemon juice and they were fantastic!  Will be making again this weekend!

Great texture and flavor, but just a bit on the sweet side for me. My kids loved it though and it was wiped out fairly quick. I'll try this again and reduce the sugar by 1/3. Definitely nice and moist as far as cornbreads go.

This cornbread recipe is a huge hit in our house!  It's the most flavorful and moist cornbread I've ever tasted.  I frequently make it with whole wheat flour too and it turns out just as yummy.

Love this cornbread! It's light and delicious. I've been looking for excuses to make it the last few weeks. I do like a less sweet cornbread, though, so I only use 1/4 c sugar. I also use 1/2 whole wheat flour.

This is the best cornbread EVER!  It is perfect!  Moist, sweet and wonderful!  I make it with whole wheat flour and I decrease the sugar just a bit.  It is still fabulous!!!  Bethany's suggestions for mixing in the same pan are great. So happy to have this recipe!

The best cornbread recipe I have ever made by far! And so easy, too. I use whole wheat flour instead of all purpose flour and it is still so light and flavorful. Yum!

I made this for dinner this evening, and it was amazing! I didn't change a thing, and I loved it- just the right sweetness, with a dense, moist texture. I will definitely make this again and again.

Yum!  Buttery and sweet.  Make sure to stir vigorously after adding the eggs otherwise you might get some cooked eggs in your batter!

This cornbread is nothing like Jiffy.  If it is I have been making Jiffy wrong-unlike Jiffy this cornbread makes large fluffy pieces that are hearty but moist.  Perfect with every meal, and very easy too make.

This is now my go-to cornbread recipe. The only thing I have done differently is to alter the amount of sugar. I like it to be a little sweet so I only used about half or less of the sugar called for. It's absolutely wonderful, either way. Also used the recipe to make my cornbread stuffing at Thanksgiving - it was a huge hit. So glad I found this recipe! Thanks!

I used Masa instead of corn meal.  It turned out very pretty.  It was too sweet for my family, though.

Made it twice-2 winners! I substitute 1/3 cup honey for sugar (you could add more but it might taste more like cake) and reduced heat to 350.

Very good.  Cooked them as muffins for about 20 minutes.  Added corn to half the batter.  Would make either way next time.  It was sweet, but that's how we like it!!!

Absolutely delicious! I have been looking for a nice corn bread recipe as my son loves corn bread. The store bought ones are just chock full of fat and sugar. This isn't so sweet and it is very moist. So easy to make too! Thanks so much for sharing the recipe. Definitely a keeper!

I made this recipe the first time exactly as written and it was absolutely wonderful.  It was moist and sweet, just like my family loves it.  It went perfectly with the spicy chili it was served with.  Second time I made it I doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13 pan.  When I baked it the edges were getting too done and the center stayed raw so I would suggest sticking with the size pans the recipe calls for.  I will definatley make this recipe over and over again.

This is my new go-to recipe for cornbread!  It is VERY yummy and I always get compliments and requests for the recipe.  Perfect!  I make the recipe exactly as written except I throw in a handful of frozen petite corn just before pouring the batter into the baking pan.  Yum!

Just the way I like it, not sweet and has a coarser texture. Perfect with Pinto beans with Ham.

WOW! This recipe ROCKED! Easy to prepare. Baked up beautifully. I am using this recipe for the cornbread stuffing that I am making on thanksgiving but I am not sure it's going to make it that long. This will be my "house" cornbread from now on. It definitely is sweet and moist. The only thing I did different was use a round glass cake pan instead of an 8 inch sq. pan.

I made a double recipe because of someones comments and I was so glad that I did. This cornbread was UNBELIEVABLE.  Sweet, but not cake-y, and moist.  I served it with "the best vegetarian chili in the world" and everyone LOVED it. I think I'm gonna make it for thanksgiving too :)

WOW!  I decided to try this recipe out on our church congregation at our annual Thanksgiving dinner to see how it went over!!!  It went over fabulously!  Moist and sweet!  One woman came up to me and said that it was the best cornbread she had ever had!  I varied the recipe by using 1/2 cup white flour & 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, doubled the recipe, put it in a 9" x 13" cast iron pan and baked it for 30-35 minutes!  Am now going to make it for our family Thanksgiving Day dinner....thanks for a wonderful recipe!

Followed the recipe to a tee - it was good, but a bit dry.  I made sure not to over cook it.  Guess I'm just used to those bakery muffins that are filled with oil and extra moist.

This is INCREDIBLE! I have made it twice in two weeks and both times everyone raved about it. Where other cornbreads seem to dry out quickly this one seemed even better the next day.

This cornbread was fantastic! I followed the recipe to the letter as it annoys me when folks change the recipe and then review it. They aren't actually reviewing the recipe as printed but their own.   Anyhow, this was totally simple and came out lovely and crispy on the bottom and edges and beautifully moist in the middle. I will definitely make this again!  Thank you , Bethany for sharing your Grandma's recipe.

I was never fond of cornbread but this is absolutely fabulous. I baked with no changes to the recipe. The buttermilk really added to the taste.

This stuff was AMAZING! I mean, CRAZY AMAZING!  The only variance I did from the original recipe was as such: I didn't have buttermilk (not something we keep laying around the house), so I used a substitution I found. 1 tablespoon white vinegar to just under 1 cup milk.  I used 2% for the fat content (almost always when cooking), and just added the vinegar, let it sit for a few minutes, and add as you would buttermilk.  The difference is unnoticeable.  I will be making this every time I make chili.  The recipe I reviewed on this site for Chili is by far the best!!  A great pairing!

This cornbread came out dense, gorgeous and delicious. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because as written it would've been way too sweet. I reduced it to 1/2 cup and it was still a little sweeter than I prefer. It helps to use a small pot/saucepan to melt the butter in and mix your ingredients in there and to preheat your pan while you do. I'll definitely use this recipe again.

I find that sometimes the simplest things to make are the best things to eat. So is the case with this cornbread. It was just flawless—moist, sweet, and classic. I cut down on the sugar by about 1/4 cup so that I could replace it with honey, which added a little more depth of flavor to it. I also found this recipe as easy to throw together as packaged cornbread mixes so I will never go back. I topped my piece with homemade honey butter and devoured it before I even got my chili into the bowl. Very delicious!

Excellent recipe. I added some whole kernel frozen corn and increased the bake time to 1 hour- 40 minutes @ 375 and 20 @   325 as it had browned enough but was not fully cooked.

So easy and absolutely delicious.  I mixed everything in one skillet, like the author suggested and was really worried that the bread would be not be fluffy enough because it just seemed too easy.  It was perfect - the best cornbread recipe I've tried....it's a keeper..thank you for sharing it!

I have never made cornbread before and this was amazing!!!!!! So easy to make. Followed the recipe exactly and was done perfectly in 30 min. The only change I would make as per other reviews as well would be to cut the sugar at least in half to go with a dish such as chili. If you want just for a snack I would leave as is. YUMMY

Very sweet, Very moist. I added 1 1/4 cup of frozen yellow corn (thawed) and it turned out lovely. I think  I will decrease the sugar a bit next time. It tasted a little more like cake than bread that can up well stand next to a savory bowl of chili. Nonetheless, all of my dinner guests ate HUGE pieces and enjoyed it.

Hi all, this is a great recipe, absolutely love it. However, I recently moved to Denver and it doesn't come out quite right, flat, a little underdone and burnt on the top! Any suggestions for high altitude?    Thanks

I've made this three times in one week - it's that good. My husband says this is the best cornbread he's ever had. I didn't change anything in this recipe and don't ever plan to - it's perfect. This will become a staple in my house. Thanks so much for posting it!

This cornbread is great! It is super moist and a bit sweet. Perfect with honey on top. I followed the instructions added in the comments by the recipe's author but had to alter my baking time to be only about 25 minutes. Be careful not to overcook or you may lose the moistness which really makes this cornbread worth it. Very good!

best cornbread we've ever had! but I would suggest melting the butter in a large microwave-safe bowl in the microwave, and then adding the ingredients from there. save a pan! thanks for sharing this great recipe! ** update : the only recipe for cornbread I'll ever use! I've also made a variation by adding a handful of chopped jalepenos and shredded cheddar. Amazing!

This is good cornbread. I will never buy a mix again, thats for sure. I made a double batch and added a well drained can of corn. I also made the bread into corn shaped muffins using preheated cast iron to give the outside a bit of crust. Yummy! I think we will be eating corn bread more often

This was an excellent recipe for sweet cornbread. I am partial to less sweet, more butterery breads but my family loved this. I will definitely make this again, maybe with a few tweaks.

I've been making this recipe for about a year now and it's always absolutely perfect. It rises well (can be an issue with cornbread), is moist and light, and has that hint of sweetness that I LOVE! I just made another batch for dinner along with some honey butter, and it's hard to get better than that. I do not make any modifications to this recipe, and this may be the one and only recipe for which that is true since I love to tinker. It's divine and SO easy!

Had friends over for chili and made this cornbread last night and it turned out wonderful.  I'm not a big fan of cornbread but this was good and our guests raved about it! Made as written and it will be a keeper for us. Thanks

I am a huge Jiffy fan...but now I will never buy another box of it in my life.  This was by far the BEST cornbread I have ever had.  I will make this over and over again from now on!

This is very moist-but I would have halved the sugar.  (I'm not a fan of really sweet cornbreads and this one to me is too sweet.)  Next time I make it I will lessen the sugar and probably love it!

This is by far the best corn bread I have ever had. My mother would make different recipes when I was little and I have tried different recipes also, but this is the best.

I absolutely adore this recipe! The only change I make is that I melt the butter in the microwave, in a mixing bowl, rather than on the stove.  Same concept - I still mix it all up together in the same bowl - but I have more room to multiply the recipe.  Oh, and I also never have buttermilk on hand, so I use the lemon juice and milk trick.  Thanks so much for an AMAZING recipe!

This recipe is PERFECT!! I followed the instructions and quantities exactly and the cornbread was a HIT! The only thing I changed was that I used a non-stick muffin tray to make mini-cornbreads. The recipe makes exactly 24 muffins - perfect individual serving sizes! I had cornmeal and buttermilk left the next day, so I made as many batches as I could with what was left-over and delivered to my neighbours. They all loved it!! Oh, the only other thing I noticed that my cooking time had to be lowered to only 18-20 mins as my oven is pretty powerful.   The cornbread still tastes fresh today - Wednesday (and I made this batch on Monday!).  Amazing recipe!!

Great cornbread recipe.  Perfect consistency with just the right amount of sweetness.  The only thing I did different was fix and bake it in my cast iron skillet.  We had it with Jerre's Black Bean abd Pork Tenderloin Slowcooker Chili (also great), but it would certainly work wonderfully with many other meals.  Thanks Bethany!

This was first cornbread I ever made and it was the best I have ever had.  It was perfect.  Not too sweet, not too bland.  PERFECT.  I made one very small change which was to beat the eggs into the buttermilk before adding it to the melted butter.  That meant no chance of cooked egg!  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe.

The best cornbread recipe I have tried. Very moist. It is sweet, and you can easily cut back on sugar (like 1/2) if you prefer a not so sweet cornbread. It is good both ways.

Delicious! Just what I was looking for. I didn't think this was too sweet at all, but I like my cornbread sweet. I followed this recipe exactly, except that I didn't have buttermilk, so I used the buttermilk substitute(Milk & Lemon). Thanks for this wonderful cornbread recipe. This is definitely my new favorite cornbread recipe.

Fabulous.  I cut back the sugar to 1/2 C., as suggested by other reviewers...still plenty sweet. I made it in a cast iron skillet in a 400 degree convection oven for 35 min.  Perfect. I also added a can of corn niblets.  Excellent with my chili. Will post pic.

This recipe is wonderful and easy. Goes perfectly with chili or by itself.  It is moist enough and sweet enough that you do not need to add honey or butter to eat it. Baked for about 27 minutes...not the full 30.

This cornbread is delicious! It is the perfect sweetness! I used unsalted butter but everything else I kept the same. Also, mine only took about 20-25 minutes to bake.

I had some buttermilk leftover from another recipe and thought I'd find something yummy here to make with it. This cornbread is yummy! Not too sweet, not crumbly at all, cuts perfectly and would make the perfect snack.

This truly is a five star recipe. It is perfect. It is pretty sweet which I like but if you prefer you could decrease the sugar and still have wonderful moist cornbread. No crumbly pieces with this one cuts well and taste great. I didn't have buttermilk so I made sour milk but I can't wait to try it with the real thing.

I made this for my boyfriend tonight and we both loved it!   I grew up down south and my mama taught me to make the unsweetened, flourless cornbread I grew up on.   I like this one much better!   My boyfriend, a yankee who grew up in PA, loved this one better to!   I will be using this recipe from now on!

I was hoping they would taste like "Marie Callender's" corn bread, but they didn't. I probably won't make again.

Years ago, I'd purchased some corn muffins at a grocery store that were slightly sweet and cake-like.  Ever since, I've been trying to duplicate them.  Thanks to this recipe, I have finally done so.  This cornbread is so delicious!  I usually make as an accompaniment to soup or stew.  However, my guilty pleasure is to have it warm, slathered with butter (of course) along with a fresh hot cup of perked coffee.  Heaven!

I've never reviewed a recipe, but this was fantastic! I only added 2 teaspoons of baking powder. It was so yummy after baking for 30 minutes. No more box mixes for me. Think I'll make some more today! Thanks for sharing.

Never made homemade cornbread from scratch. I happened to buy a big bag of freshly milled cornmeal at a county fair and decided this was time. I used PAM in a 9-in and followed recipe except for reducing to 1/2 c. sugar and whole wheat flour instead of white. I also baked for only 20 mins. I couldn't stop taste-testing it. So, I made another batch and gave some to my sister and brother-in-law. YUMMY

This was really good! However, it is VERY IMPORTANT to be sure to melt the butter just as the recipe says. I forgot to do that the second time I made this cornbread and it turned out really tough.

We loved this recipe! I was about 1/4 cup short on cornmeal and added a little extra flour to make up for it, and it still came out perfectly! Beautiful golden brown, very nice density to it, not crumbly, nice flavor. Perfect cornbread, you can bet I'll be using this one again! (And I loved how easy it was to whip up all in one saucepan.)

Absolutely moist, sweet, and delicious! I did not modify the recipe, and it came out fabulous! If you do not like sweet, cornbread, steer very clear, but if you do love sweet cornbread, make this!

I'm mad I can't give this more stars (like 10).  This is the best cornbread ever!  I only tried it because I had only 1 cup of cornmeal left.  I made red beans and rice for dinner and couldn't fathom the meal without cornbread.  This is the only way I will do cornbread from now on.  My whole family (all 7 of us) LOVED it!

I used half of the sugar and it was still to sweet for my family. I tried it again with about 1/4 of the sugar and it was sublime.  Very moist cornbread.

My husband loves to take a piece of cornbread in the morning for his ride into work. He LOVES cornbread, and I have been searching out the "perfect" recipe for it, and this is it. My 18 month old was SCREAMING at him for more. My 5 year old has been begging for more. I think this is a recipe I'll be making several times a week. Thank you so much for sharing!!

I have spent my life saying I don't like cornbread, and then I found myself in possession of 2 lbs of cornmeal and nothing to do with it.  I figured 1,000 reviewers couldn't be wrong, so I tried this recipe.  It came out delicious!  I'm a believer now.

I have tried several cornbread recipes from this site and this one will probably be my go to recipe.  It came out really good with whole wheat flour and cooking in a cast iron skillet.  Thankfully, I couldn't taste the baking soda as I can in many other recipes.  It was a little dense and sweet for my taste so I will probably cut the sugar back next time and sift my flour.  Otherwise this one is a keeper.

Update:  I don't know what I did differently besides lowering the temperature on my oven, but about the 3rd time I made it, but it was WONDERFUL!  This the cornbread recipe for me.  

If you cut the recipe in half it fits perfectly in an 8in cast iron skillet.

This was good, but not the best I have ever had. For some reason, it seemed somewhat dry. Maybe next time I'll add some grated cheese, corn kernels and/or herbs to it. Thanks!

I am holding onto this recipe for good!  I had all of the ingredients on hand, and it was so simple to make.  I cut up the stick of butter and melted it in a large bowl in the microwave.  Also, I mixed the cornmeal with the buttermilk and let it soak for a minute.  Then, I mixed everything together in the bowl, poured it into a deep dish (greased with butter) and baked it for 30 minutes.  Once it came out and cooled for 5 or 10 minutes, I lightly buttered the top to keep it moist.  And moist it was!  So delicious!  I am a midwestern girl, but I had plenty of this with some southern sweet tea...the best!

I don't claim to be a cornbread expert, but I found this one too sweet and cake-like, and I can't fathom all the 5-star reviews.

Beautiful, wonderful sweet cornbread.  I followed some advice from other reviewers:  I only used 1/2 cup sugar and since I didn't have buttermilk I took out one TBSP milk and added one TBSP apple vinegar and let set for 5 min.  So yummy...as we say here in the south, "make you wanna slap your momma."

Very good.  I love the moistness and the density.  Really good if you add some frozen corn kernels.  Keeps well for a few days.

Yum, Yum.  I just melted the butter in the microwave in a big bowl and then proceeded with the rest of the ingredients as stated.  I cooked mine in a 9 in cast iron skillet which only took 25 min in my oven.  Moist, yummy and a very thick cornbread, thanks!

This cornbread came out delicious. I reduced the serving size to four and then cornbread came out really thin in a 13x9in baking pan. It was about 3cm high but was still delicious. Oh, at four servings, I only had to cook it in the oven for 17min.

This comes out perfect every time I make it.  I made it tonight to go with seafood gumbo for the company we had over and everyone raved about it.  The pan was empty in less than five minutes.  Like others, I preheat my cast iron skillet while I'm prepping the batter - it makes for a truly wonderful crust.  Thank you so much, Bethany, for posting this wonderful recipe!

This was fantastic!!No need to ever try a different recipe.  I followed the recipe to the letter.  The *only* thing I had to do different was mix it in my Kitchenaid when it was time to add the flour because I doubled the recipe and it wouldn't fit in my skillet!  Baked the doubled recipe in a 9x13 pan - came out wonderful!!

Great! The only change I'd make is to reduce the sugar just a bit, I like them sweet but they were a bit too sweet for me. Otherwise, great texture and flavor.

I like sweet cornbread, and this fit the bill.  I used egg substitute but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I bet this could easily be turned into Mexican cornbread with some cheese and jalapenos.  Great recipe that can be doubled to fit 9x13 pan.

Wow this was good! If you have a cast iron skillet, that's definitely the way to go! We used a TBS of lemon juice with just under a cup of milk, let it sit for 5 min, and used it in place of the buttermilk. Perfect!

Made for fathers day.  Everyone loved it.  I used the apple cider vinegar and milk instead of buttermilk.  I also added a can of cream corn and  a little honey.  I baked it in a 9x12 nonstick pan for about 2/3 the time.  Since my pan was dark, I decreased the temp by 25 degrees

Wow this bread is awesome.  Dense, sweet, and delicious.  A perfect accompainment to chili.  The only changes I made were to cut the butter by a tbls or so and used milk and lemon juice for the buttermilk.  This is a definite keeper.  Thanks so much.

My fussy husband absolutely loved this recipe.  I took a previous reviewers' advice and used 1tbsp of cider vinegar in the milk instead of buttermilk.  Worked great!

First of all, I can take or leave cornbread..just not my favorite thing in general.  BUT..this recipe is awesome!  So easy!  Everyone loved it at work.  We had 'southern' potluck at work, someone brought red beans and rice, fried chicken, and then a few other things with my cornbread.  I made it in a round cake pan and turned out perfect.

This was absolutely wonderful.  I had this with Paula Deen's Stuffed Red Peppers.  The peppers were a little spicy so the sweet taste of the cornbread was great.  My husband loved it and he's always been happy with traditional cornbread. I ate it cold the next day and it was still great.

Fantastic recipe!  I will actually add a bit more sugar as we like our cornbread sweet.  I doubled the recipe and made 24 muffins.  My boys love them!

EXCELLENT! Cornbread is a favorite of mine, and I'm glad I was able to share it with my kids. Made this with some chili recently and it was destroyed. The only improvement I would make is making it in a cast iron skillet, which I don't have anyway.

Just came out of the oven and, slathered with sweet butter, it is absolutely delicious! I used one full cup of sugar by mistake and it was still fantastic. Very sweet and moist. Will definitely make again!

This recipe is perfect if you like cake-y cornbread. Since I wanted to serve these as lunch, I slightly increased the buttermilk and slightly decreased the butter. I also only used 1/2 cup of sugar. They turned out very yummy!

I have successfully turned the Clemson Sports Car Club into my obedient slaves with this recipe. The guys all love it and can't wait for weekly meetings (yes every week they get fed).

I have coworkers and family and friends groveling at my feet for me to bake this. Undeniably this is a perfect form of bribery. Even my cats try to steal bites of it.

I will never make the cornbread recipe on the cornmeal canister again.  This is by far more superior.  Definitely a great companion to the slow cooker chili on this web site. Both are always gone when I make them for family get togethers.

I have a plea for help: I've made this cornbread using whole wheat flour about 10 times. The first 5 times that I made it, it turned out perfect. I cooked it for the full 40 minutes, and it tasted great and held very well while cutting and eating.  Unfortunately, the last 5 times that I've made this, the substance of the cornbread has dramatically changed. But the only difference in what I am doing with the cornbread is to cook it with whole milk instead of 2%. When I make it now, it does not hold very well, and the bottom crest is very crumbly. It's still delicious; just not very substantive.   I've tried altering the cooking time, etc. What am I doing wrong??

Hands down the best cornbread i have ever had.  I didnt change anything except for the time.  My cornbread was done in 20 min.  So check on it every ten minutes till you know how long it takes in your oven/altitude.  It seems to be different for everyone.  But this is for sure the only cornbread i will make from here on out. Delish!!

hands down THE best cornbread I've ever had. It had just the right balance of sweetness but was tender and didn't fall apart. The only thing I changed was adding a drizzle of honey to the batter at the end. My search for perfect cornbread has ended!

This was the first time that I didn't read the reviews before making a recipe. First of all.... This is the BEST tasting cornbread I have EVER made!! For this I will give it a 5 star*****!  However I doubled the recipe because I am doing a bake sale for my RELAY FOR LIFE team and thought to myself that 1 tesp of baking soda didn't seem like enough for a double batch. But I followed the recipe to the tee (using the serving scale to double my recipe) and the muffins that I made were far from muffin like. More like discs....that taste fabulous!! So I gave it a 4 star! ****!

I have not made homemade cornbread before, but this recipe is excellent.  I added a can of mashed up peaches along with a couple of tablespoons of the peach juice.  The whole family loved it.

Nice & simple.  Quick to make for nights when you don't have dinner planned out.  Fed family of six quite nicely!

I loved how fun and unique this recipe was to prepare; what I would change next time is the baking time. My cornbread turned out a little dry, but I think that may be my oven. Next time I will reduce the baking time and just let it continue to bake while it cools on a rack.

This is very very good cornbread.  I did not give it 5 stars though.  I would give it 4.5 or 4.75 if I could.  The reason is I am looking for a cornbread that is dense and moist and sweet.  This is sweet but crumbly, not dense and moist.  To the recipe's credit it could be me, my oven, or the type of pan I used.  But I watched it carefully and after 30 minutes a toothpick came out covered in batter so I let it go another 6 minutes.  Maybe it only needed 3?  I will try a couple others from this site, they are very similar except they use baking powder, not soda, regular milk, not buttermilk, and vegetable oil, not butter.  Coincidently if anyone out there is from the Rochester, NY area and has ever had cornbread from Beale Street Cafe, THAT'S the type of cornbread I'm looking for!

Great Recipe! My very particular 6 year old loved it. That says it all in my opinion! Really yummy with a bit of heat added-e.g. some type diced pepper with some kick.

The cornbread was ok. My husband and I like a sweeter cornbread and one that is not quite so heavy. I will probably not use this recipe again.

Great old school recipe.  I couldn't wait for someone to bring me some butter cause I was out.  So I used about 1/3 cup of oil and it turned out perfect!!!  Next time I will use the butter for taste but it still turned out terrific.  This is going in my recipe box!!!

This cornbread is amazing!! My father-in-law from Louisiana lives with us and eats cornbread all the time. When I make this, he goes back for thirds and more sometimes! He calls it cornbread cake. I make this for breakfast with a little less sugar, I've even made it for cornbread dressing. No matter how I make it, there is never any leftovers!

Really good cornbread.  I let the corn meal soak in the buttermilk for about 10 minutes, don't know if that made a difference.  As others said, a bit too sweet, so I'll reduce the sugar next time.  Otherwise, moist, buttery, and overall tasty.

This is my new favorite cornbread recipe. It's so easy to make and is just sweet enough without being too sweet. One tip I can offer - when I added the dry ingredients, I gradually whisked in the cornmeal first, then sifted the flour and salt into the pan as I stirred. I had no lumps to deal with and the result was divine! Thanks for a keeper!

I loved this cornbread. I made it just as written and that's just how I like it, but I will have to make one with less sugar and jalapenos because that's how my husband prefers.

Excellent! Tender and moist. I used a 9-inch pan and baked in for 30 minutes and it came out great. I always use Bob's Red Mill Stone Ground Cornmeal and it worked perfectly in this recipe. A keeper!

Very good.  I make this all the time now.  When I don't have buttermilk I use a mixture of lemon juice and milk, as suggested in other reviews, and it works just as well.

Followed instructions to the T.  Turned out very dry and tasted very floury.  Had very high expectations reading all the favorable reviews; plus I don't usually fail at baking.  Disappointing!

My husband thought that this was THE best cornbread ever... next morning I found that the melted butter was still sitting in my microwave!  Glad he thought it was so grand even with the missing ingredient! I also reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and baked in 8 inch square glass pan.

Wonderful thick cornbread.  I might add a little more sugar or some chopped jalapeno's next time for a little more sweet or heat.

A-MAZE-ING!!!! i love this recipe and, more importantly, so did my boyfriend (who i was making it for). i followed the recipe exactly, and the texture is perfect--not dry or crumbly. the flavor is great and it's sweet, but not too sweet. i was given strict instructions (by my boyfriend) to "hang onto this recipe!"

Thanks Grandma, this cornbread was so easy to put together and tasted awesome.  Can be cooked in pan but use your cast iron skillet for that "down home" crunch !

I was looking for recipes to use buttermilk that I had. I found this recipe and decided to make it for my hubby, who loves cornbread. WOW! Now I see why it has a five star rating. It is phenomenal! Really good and just sweet enough. My hubby LOVED it~

Amazing!!! I didn't have an 8x8 pan, so I put foil around my frying pan and baked it in that.  It was delicious!  I have ruined many many Cornbread over the years... but I didn't with this one!  Yeah!

I was a bit unsure about being to mix the batter well in a skillet but it came out GREAT!  I used whole wheat flour and the powder buttermilk and used a fork to mix.  My family of four gobbled it up!!!  Thanks!!!

This cornbread is very easy to make.  Mine came out very moist.  I only had a 9" square pan so I reduced the time to 15 minutes (had to keep checking the oven so I didn't burn it.)  Will be making this again.  Thanks!

This is the only cornbread recipe that I make.  I do cut the sugar down to 1/2 a cup.  I found that if you let your butter brown in your pan, it gives the cornbread a rich, almost caramel-y taste.  Just be careful not to burn it.  I never have buttermilk on hand so I add 1-2 Tbsp of vinegar to sour some regular milk.  It works every time.  I often substitute some of the white flour for whole wheat, ground flax seed, and/or masa harina to give it some variation.  It's hard to mess up this great recipe.

This is the best cornbread I have ever had.  I melted the butter in a cast iron pan in the oven.  Mixed the ingredients in a separate bowl.  When everything was ready, I poured the mix into the pan with the butter and cooked.  It didn't take the whole 40 minutes.    Question,  how many muffins does this make?  Are they just as good?  I am making this for a church supper, so have to make LOTS.

Great cornbread.  I added some frozen corn to my batter before baking and it made for a nice authentic consistency.  Also, make sure to use butter to grease your pan.  I used shortening the first time I made this recipe and it really interfered with the taste.

I've made this three times in the past week, so I figured it was worthy of the time it takes to log into my account and give it the five star rating it deserves.  No tweaking, adjusting, or modifying necessary -- this recipe is PERFECT.

I made this cornbread for dinner tonight. It was really good - similar to the Jiffy Mix cornbread but better. As stated in other reviews, this is a Yankee Cornbread - not a Southern recipe. Although I live in the South, I was raised a Yankee and still have not become accustomed to a non-sweet cornbread. This will be my go-to recipe. Thanks for the post.

This cornbread recipe is the best I have ever made! My dad said that it was the best cornbread he ever had. I used 2 cups of cornmeal mix instead of a cup of flour and a cup of cornmeal and it turned out great. Thank you so much for the recipe!

The best cornbread recipe ever!  After making this as written a few times I've started to sub 1/2 cornmeal for corn flour and add about 2/3 cup chopped corn kernels for texture.  Fabulous!

I have never tasted or made cornbread before,so I can't really make a comparison in terms of how it should or should not be,but it's definitely a no-fail recipe in terms of texture and taste.I also found the sweetness to be just right.But most of all I loved how easy it was to make ,which is always a plus when you don't want to spend the rest of the day washing the dishes afterwards.So I am giving it five stars all the way!!!

Excellent recipe, I love sweet cornbread and this had just the right amount of sweet.  My first batch came out a little dry so I added an extra 1/8 cube of butter and it came out just right.

Very good. Super simple and cooked in 30 minutes. Made them tonight to have with a chicken stew and got rave reviews from everybody. Only change I will make next time is less sugar as they're pretty sweet.

This was a wonderful recipe. We used white corn cornmeal and it was a perfect balance of sweet and moist, just what cornbread should be. My husband asks for it every other week now. Thank you so very much!

This has to be the best cornbread ever!  I added some frozen corn.  My 4yo and husband thought it was cake!  We'll be making this again.

This has to be the best cornbread recipe ever.  I made 2 of them for dinner one night and my college age children and their friends devoured one before dinner. Make exactly as the recipe and you will agree.  This cornbread recipe does not crumble and bakes up perfect every time. The only thing bad about the recipe is I never have leftovers because the entire pan is always eaten.

Thank you so much for such a fast, easy and delicious recipe!  This is exactly what I was hoping for- good, cakelike consistency, just enough sweetness, and it held together like a dream! I followed the recipe to a "T" (except for subbing 1 cup whole milk with 1 T vinegar to sour it, because I had no buttermilk) and we served it with the Best Vegetarian Chili in the World from this site, and it hit the spot on a frigid Chicago night.

My grandpa used to eat cornbread JUST like this crumbled into a tall glass of milk.  I loved the sweetness, loved the mild crunch, loved the fluffiness......what's not to love?  This was really, really good and will be a staple on our kitchen table.

This recipes is amazing! Before, whenever I tried to make cornbread it would end up heavy and tasteless. This recipes works as well as a "sweet treat" for breakfast or as a side dish for dinner.  My husband loves it, and it never even has a chance to get cold.

I don't understand how so many of you can give this five stars if you changed it as much as you did, but I made this without substitutions and I absolutely loved it. Sweet, holds up together great, and went really well with the porkchops and gravy I made for dinner. It's also an easy, quick snack; cut it in half, sprinkle some cheddar cheese over it, and heat it up until the cheese melts. I'm never using Jiffy box mix again.

The first time I made this, I baked the cornbread in the same cast iron skillet I mixed the ingredients in, but it didn't quite turn out right.  The second time I followed the instructions and baked it in a separate pan and it turned out awesome!  Not sure why there is a difference, but there was.  This is a moist, sweet cornbread - just to my liking!  Edited to say that the 3rd time I made this, I added 1 cup of creamed corn - YUM!  Made it only slightly more moist. . . could've used some diced jalepenos or green chiles!

I couldn't upload a photo, because there are only three crumbs left.  It came out as beautiful as the photo shown though, and the taste.. perfection!  I like my cornbread more on the cakey* side and not very gritty, so I used fine cornmeal, and i didn't have buttermilk, only light milk, so i gave it a shot of lemon juice before i began and followed the recipe to a *T*.  Well, I accidentally put in a tsp. b. soda, but it didn't hurt the recipe at all.  We had it with chili tonight, but i buttered and honeyed a small square for desert, heh.  Truly, I have made a lot of cornbread but this is the best.  Thank goodness for your granny!  Thanks for the recipe, its going into the family file. (trust me, not many make it in there).  ~~bc

my family went crazy over this! I gave the recipe to my mom and she made it for my picky dad and he LOVED it! The only thing I do differently now is I add a little extra buttermilk so that the cornbread doesn't turn out so dry! Such a great recipe!

Great recipe! Moist and good flavor. Just a note though... I forgot to add the melted butter (left it in the microwave)the first time I made it and it was still great! I like serving it with chile.

Delicious, but high maintenance.  Although this recipe is superior to others that I have, I only make it 25% of the time I make cornbread, because it is so much work.

I guess I am the minority on this, and I so wanted to love it!  Other than using splenda for the sugar, I didn't change anything.  Even though it was very moist, I thought it was just a bit bland, so I'll look elsewhere for the perfect cornbread recipe.

Loved it! Made them as cupcake size and cooked for 20 mins. Turned out moist but I think next time I will cook for just a little bit less. Thanks for the recipe!

I've tried about 1/2 dozen cornbread recipes on this site and this is the best by far.  I made the recipe exactly as described, except mixed and baked in a cast iron skillet.  It was slightly sweet, rose really high, and was wonderful.

It is okay, but we prefer the homesteader cornbread from this site as it is lighter and fluffier.

I made this cornbread for a dinner party last night and it was a big hit!  I just made a few changes which turned out great. I only used 1/3 cup sugar (it was sweet enough with this!), added half a can (about 8oz) creamed corn, cut down on the buttermilk to about 3/4cup. This is by far the best cornbread I've made. Just a tip, I melted the butter in the microwave in a large glass bowl, and had the other ingredients ready to go, rather than cooking it on the stove.  So easy!

Just pulled a double batch of this out of the oven and my house smells heavenly.  I needed cornbread to "go with" stew for lunch tomorrow and decided to try this recipe rather than using a mix. I am not a cornbread eater but my husband, who is, has been circling the kitchen for the last 15 minutes slicing off pieces and declaring this the best cornbread he's ever eaten.  So, thought I should log on and give this 5 stars.  I made the recipe exactly as given except that I mixed milk with vinegar rather than buying buttermilk.  It is incredibly easy...I combined all ingredients in the pan I melted the butter in.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This is fantastic! I make it just like it's written and it never fails. So easy to do and I usually wind up doubling it and baking it in a 9x13 pan and it turns out great! EVERYONE loves it here! Thanks so much for a great recipe. I've had to print it out 3 times because it keeps getting messy. LOVE IT!

This is the best corn bread recipe ever - it is between corn bread and a corn muffin, moist, a little sweet and "sturdy."  If you, like me, like to toast your corn bread in a pan w/a little butter, this recipe makes the perfect bread for doing so!

I have made this several times exactly as written. It's awesome!  Last time, though, I decided to try an easier way.  I melted the butter in a large plastic bowl in the microwave.  I then added the rest of the ingredients to the same bowl.  I cooked it in a pre-heated cast-iron skillet for 25 minutes.  It was fantastic!  Using the microwave with only one bowl definitely made less of a mess, and it tasted just as wonderful as the original.  This is the only cornbread recipe I will ever use!

Only four stars because I was expecting it to be much more moist with 1/4 lb. of butter in it.  I would still consider this a dry cornbread.  The sweetness and flavor were right on.  It was well done at 30 minutes, so next time I will check it at 25 minutes and see if that makes it more moist.

I thought because of the buttermilk this would be awful being I'm not a buttermilk fan. I was wrong, this cornbread was awesome. I did decrease the sugar a bit to my own taste and still enjoyed it.

Excellent cornbread - much better than the recipe on the side of the cornmeal box.  We don't like buttermilk and I didn't have any, so I just used regular whole milk and it came out great.  I'll definitely be making this again!

I tried this recipe yesterday and I can't stop making it! So far, I've only had one piece and have been giving them away. Now everyone wants the recipe! My buttermilk went a lil chunky so I added lemon juice to the milk just like the other reviewer suggested and it turned out great! I also used half white and half whole wheat flour, and brown sugar as substitute. It's so yummy. I'm planning on making few more this weekend~

I can't put into words how great this cornbread is!  So moist...just the right amount of sweetness...nice slightly crunchy outside.  I don't even like cornbread, but my daughter does and I wanted to be able to make her some great homemade cornbread.  I made this last night after eating dinner and I just had to have three pieces of it!  I followed the recipe exactly as stated with a few "quick and easy" steps just for my purposes: Melted my butter in a saucepan instead of a skillet because I didn't think my skillet would be deep enough to mix everything without making a mess. Beat the eggs before adding them to the butter and sugar mixture. Mixed the flour, cornmeal and salt together in a small bowl before adding them to the saucepan.  I also used unflavored Crisco shortening to grease my pan and I did use salted butter in the recipe.  Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I think they'd be awesome as mini-muffins and am going to buy a mini-muffin pan today.  Thanks for a super recipe!

I grew up on cornbread as a staple food at home.  This recipe was wonderful!!  It was soooo moist and very tasty.  I was going to freeze some like suggested, but there was none left to freeze.  I will not use another recipe for my cornbread again!! Thanks!! Everyone loved it.

After many years of making cornbread, this is now my favorite cornbread recipe.  Buttermilk makes all the difference.  I do usually reduce the sugar.  But with out without the sugar reduction, this is a great cornbread recipe.

I liked how moist the cornbread was but it was a little to sweet for me.  My husband rated it a 7.5 out  of 10 but to be fair we are not sweet eaters.  I will make again without sure I like corn bread that is buttery and more of a corn taste. This a really good basic recipe.

This is the BEST cornbread I've ever made and tasted. I made a double batch, in two 9" round pans. They baked in 30 minutes. They are moist, tasty, and addicting! The easiest thing to make. Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe.

Best corn bread I have EVER made! I also used a heated cast iron skillet with oil in the bottom and cooked it in a convection oven for 18 minutes.  It was perfect! We absolutely loved this wonderful recipe.

I've always loved cornbread, and this is the best recipe I've made.  It is very moist and delicious.  Buttermilk is such a great ingredient for baking!

This is absolutely my favorite cornbread recipe! I have found that making it in a preheated cast-iron skillet makes it even better. Since the skillet is preheated (I just stick it in the oven after I turn it on, and when I'm done mixing the cornbread I take out the pan and pour in the batter) it doesn't need to cook as long. Could be my oven, but this cornbread is done in exactly 15 minutes. It is so delicious! Thank you for this recipe!

I never made Cornbread before. When I made this, it was so very delicious! My fiance recommended using our homemade yogurt instead of buttermilk, that's what made it even more better. This is a great bread to make because it's fast and easy to make, plus it's not too sweet or too plain. The Cornbread came out with a golden top and bottom. It didn't last too long sitting in the kitchen! I can't wait to make it again.

Great recipe...perfect soft, cakey texture that is preferred in the northeastern part of the country.  The buttermilk also adds to the taste, but I love buttermilk so I think I am just being partial.

Great cornbread. I can't believe I made this and it was so easy and delicious.  I mixed and sifted all the dry ingredients and mixed all they wet ingredients then mixed it all together in the pan.  I will make this again for sure.

So moist and delicious.  I also substituted the flour for whole wheat flour and it cuts the sweetness and adds a nutty flavor to the bread.  Very delicious, and great with jam.

I had corn meal mix, so i used 2 cups of this and omitted the salt, baking powder and flour.  I also added 1 small can of creamed corn and I just eyeballed the sugar because my dad doesnt like it really sweet.  The texture came out perfect.

My honey (the pickiest eater) LOVED this recipe. He watched me make it- complaining the whole way 'cuz I used so many bowls to keep the ingredients separated for easy mixing- and then, saw it and said, "Oh, wow, it is pretty though." Then, he ate more bread than dinner. It was delicious, easy and I will definitely be bringing this to Christmas dinner at my Mom's- she will be so impressed! Thanks tons!

LOVED IT.  ONLY THING I CHANGED WAS THE SUGAR. YES, I'M FROM THE SOUTH AND I LIKE UNSWEETENED CORNBREAD EXCEPT I DID ADD 2 TABLESPOONS OF SUGAR FOR MY YANKEE HUSBAND. COMPRIMISE IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT. IT WAS MOIST AND HAD A VERY VERY GOOD FLAVOR. THE BUTTER , I THINK.

Wow- as a beginner cook, I am amazed at how well this came out! I've never tried my hand at cornbread (even the Jiffy kind), but decided to give this a go, and it was heavenly. I tried out the preheated iron skillet in the oven- the crackling was delightful and 30 minutes later gave a crispiness to this "sweet and moist" treat! :) Definitely holding onto this recipe! It's one of my first cooking triumphs!

Thanks for a great cornbread recipe!  And so easy to make too.  I couldn't stop eating it.  I brought leftovers to work today and one of my coworkers ate all 4 pieces.  He couldn't stop eating it either.  I will definitely make this over and over again!  Yummy!!!

these were a huge hit in my house. I had to toss some of the batter to make it fit into my 8" cast iron. And it is true if you preheat you CI before you add the batter you do get a crunchier bread! YUM!

Thank you for this delicious recipe!! It was the hit at our Thanksgiving table.  Our 1 yr. old nephew kept asking for more. Family members asked me for the recipe, so I have shared with them too.
This one will definitely be a staple for any holiday dinner.

I have made various recipes every Thanksgiving and this one is the best by far. The buttermilk makes it nice and moist and the amount of sweet is great.

Excellent recipe, all I need is a cast iron skillet to bake it in and it would be just like my grandmother's cornbread.
Only thing I change is I use regular milk cause I don't like buttermilk.

Great moist cornbread.  It has good density and doesn't crumble apart like many recipes.  Some family members thought it was too sweet, but most thought it was perfect.  I cooked it for only 25 minutes and that was perfect.

I followed the recipe exactly and made wonderfully moist cornbread with perfect texture and sweetness.  The only thing I would do differently next time is to reduce the baking time by two or three minutes.  I might also try putting in canned corn kernels next time.  I'll definitely be using this recipe again and again.  No more Marie Callendar mixes for me!

This was delicious!  Very moist, with no need to add butter when serving (apropriate, considering the amount of butter that's in the recipe).   I added a can of Mexican corn (with chiles and peppers) and it was absolutely wonderful with it, but I think next time I will try it without, as I think the recipe by itself would be enough.

I'm a novice cook with many failed experiences making cornbread. This one was easy and tasted great!! One question though, I used a 9" square pan vs. 8" and my cornbread only came out an inch high. I am thinking that the 9" wouldn't have made it that shallow alone. Could it be that I over-mixed?? Thanks!!!

This was very yummy. We like our cornbread sweet. This will be my base recipe. My hubby wants it to be a little more cake like and this was dense, so I will play with that, but it was gobbled up quickly.

Very good!! I made a mistake and only used 1/4 cup of butter.  The recipe said 1/4 lb of butter which is equal to 1/2 cup.  Duh!! But the recipe is very forgiving.   Keeper.

Delicious. Try not to overbake- I cooked mine a tad under 30 mins and I would take it out a few minutes earlier next time. Try it with the Boilermaker Chili from this site- really good combination.

Wouldn't change a thing about the ingredients.  Very moist - I had actually stopped making cornbread for awhile because it always turned out dry. I think the buttermilk makes all the difference - got rave reviews.  However, I was reluctant to use the one pot - was afraid of it being too hot, and the eggs cooking.

I made this to go along with the slow cooker bbq beef I made and my husband said that it was the best cornbread he's had. I did reduce the sugar a little and made my own buttermilk with skim milk and lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe, it will be added to our regular rotation for sure.

These had excellent flavor and moist. They had great flavor. I only took a star away because I cut the sugar in half based on the other reviews and the corn bread was plenty sweet this way.

Followed the recipe exact and it was amazing! I love cornbread. I made them in muffin tins- cooked at the same temp for 14 minutes. I also put some red food coloring in to make them orange for Halloween. Fun

Foolproof recipe.  It's very good, keeps well, makes good cornmeal mush in the morning. Without making any changes to the recipe itself, I've found that you can also use an iron skillet (greased with Crisco, not oil) that has preheated for a few minutes.  Delicious.

WOw! I absolutley loved making AND eating this cornbread. I've made overly dry or not quite 'right' cornbread in the past, and this recipe was straight-forward and easy to follow. I didn't change a thing, and everyone loved it! =)

I've been looking for a good cornbread recipe that measures up to my husbands mothers recipe.  Well I finally found it with this one!  I followed the recipe almost to the T except I followed the advise of another and substituted 1 can of Creamed Corn in place of the buttermilk and I added a bit of evaporated milk and cut down the sugar to about 1/4 cup as my husband doesn't like his cornbread too sweet!! And as always I use a cast iron pot in the oven so I just mixed everything up in a bowl and preheated my cast iron pot with the butter till it got warmed and then poured everything in the pot. I made this before I left for my son's football game and I served this with the Fantastic Black Bean Chili recipe found on this site also!!! The cornbread was so
yummy!! It was the perfect meal after being out in the cold at the Football Game!! Oh by the way the Cornbread disappeared! Thanx so much for this recipe.

I used less sugar and butter, but otherwise made it as Bethany said, even all in one bowl.  I was afraid when I added the eggs they would cook, so I tempered it and then held my breath - but they were fine.  It was wonderful!!  Thanks Bethany!!!

Best cornbread ever!  i used an 8 inch skillet.  when i make cornbread, i put about 2-3 tablespoons of shortening in the skillet and put in the oven while it preheats.  when the oven has preheated, take out your skillet and pour in the cornbread mixture.  it will cook a little instantly and will give you a perfectly crisp crust.

The perfect cornbread recipe! The only thing I did differently was to use a glass pan and heat it in the oven while mixing the cornbread.

Wonderful cornbread. If I would change anything it would be to use just a bit less sugar for a more traditional flavor but this was delicious just as it is. Served with black eyed peas-yummy.

This recipe is super easy. It is good, everyone stated they liked it. The only complaint I heard was it wasnt as moist as some would like. Next time I think I will add a little less cornmeal and add a little more buttermilk. Thanks for the recipe!

The best I've tasted! I've searched a few sites for other good cornbread recipes but haven't found one rated as high to even give a try. Actually, I don't even know why I've looked around, as this one is soooo good!

I was looking for a moist cornbread, and this was much more moist than the recipe I usually make! :) 

I like less of a sweet cornbread though, so I only added a tiny bit of sugar, and upped the salt some. 

Overall, very yummy with a few changes that I made just to suit my tastes. Thanks!!

YUMMIE.  I made one change that really made it the best cornbread I've ever had.  I replaced the Buttermilk with a can of creamed corn.  It turned out really moist.  I like my cornbread on the sweeter side, so I used the full amount of sugar.  Thanks for a GREAT Recipe.

I love this recipe. Instead of melting the butter in a pan, I microwave it in the biggest bowl that fits in my microwave and just add the ingredients as the recipes recommends.

There were only 4 of us eating and only one small square left.  That says it all!  This was absolutely perfect.  Listening to another review I (for once) didn't cheat and got the buttermilk.  Just "because" I'd like to try adding whole corn and green chilis.  I will report back on that if I do.  It truly is wonderful the way it is, we just like the texture of the additions.  Thanks so much for a true winner!
10/31/11  Well, it took me a year, but I did double the recipe, added 2 c. frozen corn, thawed and 2-4 oz. cans diced chilis.  I melted the butter in a huge (15") cast iron skillet (I sprayed up the sides with Pam) and just mixed it all up in their, too.    40 minutes later, it was perfectly nice and moist.  I'm almost afraid to push the envelope, but I'm tempted to add shredded cheddar to it.  Straight or with the additions, this is one keeper recipe!  Thank you so much for sharing.  It's the only one I'll ever use now.  Folks are always asking me to make this.

Very good cornbread, but I read it as 1/4 cup of butter (1/2 stick) instead of 1/4 lb.   So, I ended up with a drier, but still yummy cornbread.  So, if you are trying to watch your butter intake, rest assured that you will get a good result with 1/2 the amount of butter.

Loved it!
Having eaten cornbread at many places in America I tried to find it here in the UK, but not much luck so just had to make it myself...
Followed the recipe exact and it was perfect, brought happy holiday memories flooding back.

Absolutely perfect! So easy to make and so moist. My whole family ate the so quickly. Best warm from the oven but equally delicious cool for dinner the nexy day. This is not too sweet and I look forward to making these muffins next time. Grandmother's Buttermilk Cornbread has just become my staple cornbread for chili. Thanks!

This is the easiest recipie for corn bread I have ever used. It is moist and dense. I did add 1 can of creamed corn. (I'm sorry I tweeked your recipie. I love corn in mine). Thank You for the idea of making 2 batches and freezing 1. It works great as a time saver and I just doubled the recipie and it worked fine. I made mine in 2 bundt pans and baked at the same time. They not only tasted great but were very pretty to serve at the table.

Very good. I felt guilty eating something made with a stick of butter, but it was really moist, smooth, slightly sweet, and holds up well as a leftover.

These turned out great!  Moist and delicious.  Cut down the sugar to 1/4 cup and used the milk + 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar instead of buttermilk because I didn't have any buttermilk.  I will probably double the batter next time to make thicker muffins, but otherwise, it's a great recipe!

This recipe is GREAT!!! I was looking for a recipe to use buttermilk because I had some kefir that was too sour to drink.  The only substitution I made was using the kefir for the buttermilk.  I will be using this recipe from now on.

I recently made this cornbread for a barbecue and I HAD TO BAKE UP A 2nd BATCH because my family and I ate up every bit of it! Quite easy and SO GOOD! I used my 10 inch Cast Iron Dutch Oven and used some fresh bacon drippings and a fair amount of vegetable oil to coat the pan and it made the side beautiful GOLDEN brown. Then I topped it with butter and it was Yum yum yum yum..hmmm delicious. This morning I ate the last little refrigerated bits. Thanks for a great recipe! I'll never use another.

This was way too sweet for me.  I could barely eat it due to the sweetness.  If you like sweet cornbread, you'll love this but I was raised on more southern type cornbread.

This was awesome just like everyone said. I doubled the recipe and baked in a 9X13 for 35 min and it came out perfect.  I mixed everything in the pot I melted the butter into.  I did cut the sugar down by 1/3c. for a double batch just to make it less cake like and more like dinner bread.

My daughter loves cornbread, so I looked up this recipe to try and go "mixless".  I was a little worried because of the reviews that it might be fussy. I tried it using the hot iron skillet method and it was amazingly good. I was telling my mom how good it was and she mentioned my grandpa loved cornbread, but couldn't find a mix he liked. I said I'd make him a batch and of course my dad would also need one.  I still had buttermilk so I went to work and now I can make it easily from memory and it's so worth washing a pan and an iron skillet. I make enough each time to use the buttermilk up and freeze what we don't eat.

This is THE BEST RECIPE!!!  I know almost everyone else has said the same thing, but its true!  I didn't change a thing except for adding some whole kernel corn to the batter.  I like my cornbread sweet, and this is the recipe that I will use for the rest of my life! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for sharing this recipe with all cornbread lovers alike! :)

I will never make cornbread from another recipe again.  Took it to work and everyone freaked out.  It's awesome.  Added about half a can of corn kernels and it added a really nice touch.

I have finally found the cornbread recipe I was looking for!! My grandmother passed away and never wrote down her cornbread recipe; this is as close to tasting like hers than any I have tried.  I almost cried when I took my first bite!!  Perfectly dense, so moist and just the right amount of sweetness.  THANK YOU!!

This is the first time I have ever made cornbread from scratch, I usually just mix up some Jiffy, but NEVER AGAIN!! This was the best cornbread I have ever tasted and I can't believe that I did it from scratch. I didn't change a single thing and it was absolutely wonderful. I prefer my cornbread sweet and this was perfect. A definite 5 star keeper! BETHANYWEATHERSBY, thank you so much for such an outstanding recipe!

One thing I have to say: Wow. This makes the most AMAZING cornbread I have ever had. I followed the recipe as-is, except I only had self-rising corn meal, and a 10" round cast iron skillet. Greased the skillet liberally with veg. oil, left some in the bottom, and popped it in the oven to preheat while I mixed all of the ingredients in my saucepan. When melting the butter, I turn off the gas JUST before it's all melted, and it just melts its self. Kept following directions, take the skillet out of the oven [HOT!], and pour it in. Into the oven, and after 25 minutes, it's perfect. I made the first batch, brought it over to a friend's, and it was gone the following day. Just made another batch two hours ago for breakfast =)

This cornbread is the BEST.  It even deserves MORE than 5 stars. My family loves this, and they love it even more when I underbake it for a bit, and the middle is still "gooey" we have this at least once a week, and there are NEVER any leftovers for lunch the next day.

Very good! I made cornbread muffins by raising the temperature just a bit and cooking for 20 minutes. These came out light and just a little bit sweet. I doubt there will be any leftovers!

Good recipe.  Not amazing but definitely very good.  I made it according to the directions - no changes except that I didn't have buttermilk so I used a cup of regular milk with 1 TBSP of lemon juice (let it sit 5-10 minutes then use it).  I'll keep this one bookmarked as a back up but I'm still looking for one I may like better.

The last time I made cornbread it came out dry and bland.  This recipe tasted like it was store bought!  I used a little less sugar than called, and might use a touch less next time to play with it.  I added a few handfuls of frozen corn into the mix.  I did not have a cast-iron skillet, so I greased the 8 in pan with vegetable oil and popped it into the pre-heating oven while I mixed the rest of the ingredients in the same pot I melted the butter in.  Baked up beautifully in under 30 minutes.  The taste is moist, and just sweet enough.  Quite yummy!  Great recipe!  Thanks!

I followed the directions as written and it turned out great! My husband thought it could be a little sweeter, but I thought it was perfect and sweet enough. It was so yummy and gone within minutes.

Without a doubt, this is the best cornbread I have ever had, homemade or otherwise. I used whole wheat flower, to wonderful effect. Not too sweet, just sweet enough. I also appreciated the added health benefit. Five stars, all the way.

Really good recipe.  Too much sugar for me, though.  Reduced it to 1/3 cup and used whole wheat flour.  Very moist, but the cornbread didn't rise very much.  Think I'll add 4 tsp baking powder next time.

I made this with Bloody Butcher cornmeal (sort of a blue corn with red flecks).  It was great!  Usually I like cornbread best the first day when the edges are all crispy from baking, but this one was more moist and flavorful the next day.  Good enough to eat without butter and honey!

Perfect and simple! I have powdered buttermilk (worthwhile to keep in the fridge, just in case), so I had everything I needed on hand! 

It's not low fat, but can be made low fat, it is SOOOO good! (It took 35 minutes in a round 8 inch cake pan, that is what I had on hand.)

I'm sure the cause of non-5 star rating is my own fault...I only had corn meal mix, which is flour/cornmeal/baking soda mix.  I used 2c. of this with everything else.  I wish I would have either used 1 1/2c. or 1/2c or so more liquid, the end result is a little dry but tasty.  Will go great with the Fusion chili, which is the best chili ever (find it on this site).

This cornbread is amazing! And so much better than anything I've ever made from a box. Definitely eat it quickly, however, as mine dried out after just a couple of days.

This is delicious. Followed to a T. VERY Moist. My family loves cornbread but no mater how or what I make it falls apart, not this one. Very good as is witha touch of sweet. I like mine a little sweeter next maybe add a little more sugar. But this was fabulous and is the one I will be making from now on. Thanks for sharing!

I thought this was very good.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I made it using 1 cup of milk + 1 tablespoon white vinegar, and *believe it or not* I didn't have eggs, so I substituted 3 tablespoons of mayo for each egg.  I also used corn flour, as for some reason I had a hard time finding cornmeal.  It turned out beautifully!  A keeper fo' sure.

This was great!  I followed the advice in some of the other reviews and made it with whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of sugar and sour skim milk.  It was so moist and delicious!  I will definitely make this again!

I don't know what happened to the people that said it was dry, but mine was moist and perfect. I thought it seemed like a lot of sugar, but it wasn’t. It had the right amount of sweetness. I ended up making a double batch for my husband to take to work with my homemade chili. It was a hit. I never thought about buttermilk in cornbread, but it's great. I made sure to let my butter cool before I added the eggs. I saw that people commented about it scrambling the eggs. Will be making again soon. Thanks

Great cornbread. It was sweet but not too sweet (with a half cup of sugar instead of 2/3, and half white/half wheat flour), and very moist.

My family loved the cornbread recipe. We have not had a homemade recipe before. It is a little sweet. So I think I will use less sugar next time. Maybe try a half cup. I made it in a stoneware round baker, it worked great. I will make again.

Don't know if it was me - maybe I mixed the batter too long - but the cornbread came out quite dense and dry.  Not at all like the cornbread at one of the home cookin' type of restaurants we frequent.  Will try again, and maybe cut the flour or add more buttermilk, and stir less!  :)

This is the best cornbread I have ever tasted, it's perfect. I had to make a couple of changes to make it vegan, I used non dairy (nucoa) margernine, put 1T of vinegar in my soymilk to make "buttermilk"  and used Ener-g egg replacer. Definitely a keeper, thanks for posting.

Really good - soft and moist with a corny crunch. I cooked as a dozen muffins for 15 min. Since we have a child with a dairy allergy, I used half shortening and half reg. smartbalance in place of butter. Mixed plain soymilk with 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice to equal 1 cup and used in place of buttermilk. Even with these substitutions, it was delicious.

This was good, but it's still too sweet for me.  I even cut the sugar in half.  I liked that it was moist and dense.

Delicious!  I grind the corn into meal myself and soak it in the buttermilk (or homemade kefir if that is what I have).  I also use whole wheat flour as I mill that too.  Wow, is it yummy.  You honestly have not really had good cornbread until you have made it with freshly ground corn.  This recipe does the ingredients justice.  I usually cut back on the sugar quite a bit, but sometimes I forget and my family loves it either way.

I did reduce the sugar a little bit after looking over some other reviewer's comments, and this cornbread came out PERFECT. I made it with the Boilermaker Tailgate Chili recipe on this website and everyone looooved it.

Absolutely delicious!  I prepared the cornbread exactly as stated in the recipe.  Very easy, nice and moist, and it is a wonderful accompaniment to a barbeque-flavored main dish.  This is now my favorite recipe for cornbread.

I just popped my second batch ever in the oven! I made it a few nights ago for the first time for my boyfriend (who sweared he's hated cornbread for his entire life) really likes this! And, I've never been much of a fan of it myself, but I think it's great too! I only put in 1/3 cup of sugar and it was sweet enough for us. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. I'm about to serve it to my daycare kids with chili for lunch and I know they'll love it! Thanks for the great recipe!

My husband usually complains about cornbread, saying it tastes like sawdust.  No matter what recipe I used, it was always the same.  It all went into the bottom of the bowl and the chili got piled on top.  This recipe is the first I've tried that he actually ate with just a pat of butter!  It passes!

If you like sweet cornbread (as the description indicates) you will LOVE this recipe. This is fabulous; reminds me of Boston Market. (To the person who got scrambled eggs - you always add eggs gradually to a hot mixture and allow adequate cooling time.) 

Thank you! I have made this many times and it is always terrific.

Used a little wheat because I ran out of all purpose - then read the reviews:)  Thanks this is the best cornbread I've made.

I just made this recipe, and it's fantastic! I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup, and I substituted whole milk for the butter milk and 2 tbsp baking powder for the baking soda since that's what I had on hand. Since I only have a 9 x 13 baking dish, I used that and reduced the  baking time to 30 minutes. I will undoubtedly make this again.

AWESOME! My boyfriend loves the Jiffy in a box--he said this was much better.  And TOO easy!  I changed nothing.  And it freezes well.

Excellent recipe! I'd never made cornbread before, but it's my husband's favorite, so I thought I would give it a try. I only used about 2/3 of the recommended sugar and it had a perfect touch of sweetness. Baked in a roughly 12" round cast iron skillet. This is a keeper!

This is the best cornbread I have ever made after trying many recipes.  Try adding 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract for a wonderful aroma.  Due to my doctor's advice, I used a quality margarine instead of butter and it was delicious.

Excellent cornbread - very buttery tasting.  Will replace all of my other recipes with this one.  I cut the sugar in half because of personal preference.  Great paired up with a nice hot bowl of chili.

I scaled this recipe to 36 so I could make it at my work (I work at an assisted living facility with 36 residents) and it went over really well. However, the first time it was a little too sweet, so the second time (and everytime after) I used only 2 cups sugar as opposed to the 2 2/3 cups called for in the recipe. I guess for the regular recipe I would use only 1/2 cup suger. It's moist, fluffy and sweet, with great flavor. This one is definately a keeper, the only way I will make cornbread again. Also makes great cornbread dressing- I bake the seasonings and onions and celery in the cornbread to save the extra step, and everyone loves it!

Although I have still not found a recipe that surpasses restaurant cornbread, this one comes pretty darn close!  It is definitely the best cornbread I have ever made.  Although many reviewers found it too sweet, my family loved it (especially the kids).  I left my husband in charge of pulling it out of the oven, and he took it out exactly at 30 minutes.  The middle was still a tad gummy, but the outside was perfect!  In fact, I'm afraid the edges might have turned out a bit dry if he left it in any longer.  Guess I'll just have to make it again to experiment....

Most EXCELLENT!!
I made this with powdered buttermilk and followed the instructions.  I usually use Jiffy mix and  think that this recipe is better.  Also, this recipe has a wonderful texture that isn't as crumbly.  Definitely a keeper!

This cornbread is great.  I used sour milk instead of buttermilk because that's all I had on hand at the time.  I usually use Jiffy mix but not anymore.  I think I will do as another reviewer suggested and make up bags of the dry ingredients to keep on hand.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Amazing!  I have tried several different box cornbreads, but like to try new things, so I gave this recipe a shot.  It is hands down the best cornbread I have ever made.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all purpose and it turned out great.  It is a sweeter cornbread that would be similar to the boxed Jiffy or 365 brands.  You have to give this recipe a shot!!

I love this cornbread!  I had only made the boxed kind before, but the only time I will ever use the boxed kind now is if it is a weeknight, and I am in a hurry.  I use whole wheat flour instead of the all-purpose, which makes it taste even better and makes it healthier.

Thank you for the excellent recipe. I am from the south and usually do not like a sweet cornbread, but this was great. And my husband loved it too! I baked it in a cast iron skillet, after I melted some shortening in it. The cornbread turned out great!

Good recipe.  I decreased the sugar by half but will decrease it more if I make this recipe again.  The texture was very moist.  I baked it in a cast iron skillet for 30 minutes.

Absolutely amazing, doesn't need any "edits" or "fixes, it's perfect the way it is. Any qualms about the richness will be eliminated as soon as you serve it. It stays together nicely, and you will be hard pressed to let it out of your own kitchen.

Ignore any attempts to change it or "modernize" it with Splenda or that sort of thing. It's good because of what is already in it.

This is by far the best cornbread that I have ever had!  It is so moist and it literally melts in your mouth.  Even the people in my family who don't really care for cornbread wolfed this down.  The only change it might would make would be to possibly cut back just a little on the sugar.  Other than that, no complaints.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this cornbread for a get together on Christmas night dinner. Everyone loved it! In fact, it was the first time I had made cornbread from scratch and I also had to double the recipe to make sure there was enough. I have made these a few times after that and the positive reviews from family keep on coming. :) Thanks for posting this recipe.

This simple recipe is fantastic!  I cut down the sugar to 1/2 cup and used whole wheat flour and it came out really well.  Went great with chili.

Would reduce the sugar a bit next time, but pretty good results...used a loaf pan and it worked out very well.

I have to say, I burned the heck out of this by accident (we had 12 racks of ribs cooking and a houseful over for New Year bowl games, so I was distracted) but what I salvaged just for a taste for myself was excellent! Will be making it again this week and keeping my eye on the timer this time : )

This is the best!!!  I've never been good at making cornbread, this recipe was easy and fantastic!  My oldest daughter tasted it and she said, "I'm throwing my recipe away!"  I did use the suggestion in one of the other reviews about making it in a cast iron skillet and it turned out perfect!

Wow, I made this for the Thanksgiving holiday for my family and they loved it. Tweaked it a bit by adding 2 cans of cream of corn to match the old southern recipe. It turned out perfect. Doubled the recipe to make two pans and it was delicious. Thanks a bunch. Will do again with chili.

Delicious! When my husband tasted this he said it was better than Jiffy box cornbread!  I love how it begins to set as it's cooling off and maintains a mosit, soft texture on the inside while the outside has a nice golden crunchy texture.  The only change was I used a cup of organic vanila yogurt in place of the buttermilk for added nutrients. Thanks for a great recipe.

This really is a fabulous and easy cornbread!!!  Positively delicious as the recipe stands, and it lends itself beautifully to additions as well.  I made it exactly as the recipe states the first time, and it disappeared before it even had a chance to cool off!  Tonight I made it again, but doubled the recipe (only 1 cup of sugar though) and added some chopped jalapenos and some grated cheddar cheese.  Yummy!!!!  This is the best recipe I have tried on this site for cornbread.

I made this recipe for a dinner party on Saturday night. As I live in Australia, none of my guests had ever tried cornbread before. Everyone loved it, even one guest who usually insults my cooking. She ate half of one of the loaves on her own and then asked me for the recipe! The only changes I made were to halve the sugar (it was to go with the main dish). It also only took about 25 mins to cook in my oven (that's probably the ovens fault though)

Taste just like the cornbread my mother and aunt used to make. Good southern cornbread. The only change was to use only 2tbs sugar. We don't like ours to sweet. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

This is a really good recipe. It is not gritty like some other recipes I have tried. Very moist, rich and flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness. My very picky 8 year old daughter gave it two thumbs up!

AMAZING! I made cornbread muffins and it took ~20 minutes. Mine was crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I might have overbaked but I loved the crispy crust! YUMMMMY!

This recipe makes a very nice cornbread.  Not too sweet like some commercial mixes.  I melted the butter in the microwave and mixed everything else in my trusty stand-mixer.  Thanks for the recipe.

I really liked this recipe!  I was looking for a slightly sweeter cornbread, and this fits perfectly!  I have made it both as written (which is very good) and with a few substitutes.  Half whole-wheat flour/half white, splenda instead of sugar, and a no-transfat margarine instead of the butter, and it still works splendidly!  The texture is slightly different, but I think you run into that with the change in flour.  I dropped the cooktime down to about 25 minutes, but I have a little convection oven that cooks things like this at a super-sonic speed!

WOW! The search for great cornbread is over. My Husband said it's the best cornbread he's ever had. This cornbread has excellent flavor, texture and was nice and moist. I followed the recipe except I added a little honey (just drizzled over the top and then stirred it in a bit) and I did use extra large eggs. I cooked the cornbread in a round stoneware pan. Thanks for sharing.

THis recipe is fantastic.  It has become my standard recipe for breakfast cornbread.  I eat it with come butter and jelly, or butter and honey and it's wonderful.  A tip, a don't ever buy buttermilk, but I do make homemade yogurt and I substitute plain yogurt for the buttermilk.  I also add the baking soda to the yogurt before I do anything else to help it rise even more.  Not sure if it makes a diffference, but this recipe is great with the yogurt, I'd suggest Stoneyfield if you dont make your own.

I cooked the ingredients in a cast iron skillet and left it in there to bake. This is the most delicious, moist, cornbread. My Southern husband and his family loved it...you know it must be good!

Good cornbread recipe...very moist, and stayed together well.  It was a bit sweet for my taste, so next time I will back off the sugar, and would also like to try it with Splenda.  Good recipe, with basic ingredients I had on hand (except the buttermilk)!  Thanks!

An excellent recipe.  Everyone loves the texture and the sweetness is just right.  I add the cornmeal to the melted butter, sugar and egg mixture before adding the buttermilk.

Very good and easy to make. Much better than mixes. I also used regular milk with a tablespoon of lemon juice instead of buttermilk and it turned out great. Could be slightly more moist, maybe it is with real buttermilk. I'll try it that way next time. Definitely recommended!

Just like my Mom used to make, I left out almost half of the sugar and they were still sweet enough. Moist, tasty aand easy. my 4 year old enjoyed helping. Watch you don't overbake this as it will get dry.

I think this is a recipe that would be really good once you take care of the excessive sweetness.  I will make it again but next time I'll follow the advice of others and reduce the amount of sugar used.

This is a tasty dessert cornbread.  I love the buttermilk, which adds tartness.  However, I like cornbread to be less sweet, and so I would use less sugar next time.  In fact, I might try a no-sugar recipe.  I added a dash of cayenne which brought a nice spicy touch for the pepper lovers.  I used a bread loaf pan, so I had to add about seven minutes of cooktime.  The edges will get dark brown.

Fantastic cornbread! Reminds me of Dixie Cafe muffins. I get compliments on this cornbread every time and people tend to come back for a second piece! I reduce the amount of sugar to 1/3 or 1/2 cup depending on my mood just because I don't like mine super sweet. This is also good if you add some jalapano peppers. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was good cornbread.  It has very nice texture and is good and sweet.  If you're looking for a moist, sweet cornbread then this is the recipe for you!  I only gave it four stars because I was expecting something a little different.

This was my first attempt at making cornbread and it turned out perfect!    I put it in for 28 minutes and that was plenty of time.  Next time I may add just a touch more sugar, I think I might like it a little bit on the sweeter side.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was the best cornbread!  I like cornbread a little on the sweet side and usually add sugar to recipes.  I followed this one exactly and it was perfect.  I made baked it in an iron skillet ...it was beautifully browned.  This is a keeper!

An okay basic recipe but not at all moist.  I used 1/2c sugar as other reviews suggested because they felt it was too sweet; next try I will use more sugar as well as make an addition for a moist cornbread.  I added 1T of Sour Cream which was a good addition.  We all have various tastes so we can make our own adjustments to fit that.  Thx for sharing your recipe Bethany.

Excellent!  I don't have a cast iron skillet, I made 8 mini loaves (like Boston Market)baked for about 28 mins  Only other change I made was added a small can of creamed corn as others suggested.  This is a keeper.
Thanks!

Made exactly as recipe states.  I thought it was way too sweet and a very strange texture, for cornbread.  I'm a big fan of Jiffy's Corn Muffin Mix in the blue box and think it has the perfect amount of sweetness and is sooo simple to make.  My family said the like it, but not very convincingly...

Best cornbread I've ever had.  I baked it in a corningware baking dish at 375 for 25-30 minutes and it was perfect.  Wonderful with clam chowder and a salad.  Thanks so much for this great recipe.

Very good flavor, a little different way of mixing it up, in a skillet, but it works just fine. I hope to be able to make it in a cast iron skillet soon!

Exceptional!!! This went great with our chili tonight, and it is way, way better (and almost just as easy) as any of the boxed cornbreads. This will be our cornbread recipe from now on, thank you!

A good cornbread, but was a  little more sweet for my taste(will cut back on sugar if i make again). Brought this to a potluck and people liked it (made mini and reg size muffins), convenient for grabbing!

The batter is more runny compared to my usual corn bread. It came out very moist and not too sweet.  I cooked the last 8 minutes on speed bake and still could have cooked it another 5 mins.  Delious corn bread.

This is the best cornbread I've eaten.  Everyone who tries it LOVES it.  You could add chopped jalapenos to it for a cajun twist!

Yum!  I specifically signed on to rate this recipe!  I just made this today and thought it was fabulous! The Bf doesn't like diary, buttermilk, sugar, will you get the idea he's kinda anal when it comes to things in his mouth.  He loved this recipe and I also loved how moist it was.  I was thinking of cutting back on the butter a little bit but other than that everything worked out really WELL!  THANKS

My second attempt at cornbread went much better than the first (a different recipe).  I cut the sugar in half, and it was really good.   It was done in 25 minutes. Loved the moist texture.  My hubby likes his with corn in it, so hopefully  I can successfully add corn to this recipe next time.

DELICIOUS! I made this to go along with "Get A Husband Brunswick Stew." My children don't like cornbread, but the ate this up quickly! Very moist and sweet with a wonderful texture.  This is my new standard cornbread recipe!

This is so good.  I cut the sugar in half because the first time I made it it was a little too sweet. My husband loves it with some homemade butter beans. Yummy!

Best cornbread I've ever made!  Very moist, yet held together without crumbling all over the place.  Took others' advice and reduced sugar to 1/2 c.

I made this with pinto beans, fried squash, and ham. It was great, but I did only use half the sugar because I didn't want it too sweet. I was mainly looking for something moist, and it was.

Best cornbread I've ever made. I baked it in my cast iron pan and will try to double the recipe next time to make it deeper.  Also, I used fresh milled corn.

Perfect!!!! It's all I hoped this recipe would be -- sweet, moist, chewy, and easy! I'd never made cornbread from scratch before and now I'll never do the mix again! I thought making it from scratch would take a long time and be complicated. This recipe was almost as easy as getting the mix -- which always tastes bland and is too crumbly. I love this cornbread! We're having leftovers tonight with our taco soup! The only change I did was half the ingredients and put it in a smaller, white porcelain baking dish. Plenty for two people!

I started making a single batch and then by mistake doubled the buttermilk. So, after that I added double of everything else except sugar and butter. I baked in a 13x9 for 40 minutes and it turned out way good with a good crispy crust to it. The inside could have been a little more moist, but that is probably due to my mistake of not doubling the butter. I tried to make up for it by serving it with honey butter and I think it worked. :-)

This was wonderful.  I used only 1/2 cup of sugar - could have used even less.  I cut the butter in half and it was delicious.

Hmmmm. I really don't want to give this one 3 stars. It was moist and had good flavor it just came out kind of dense. I might go with baking powder instead of baking soda. I might have over mixed it. I dunno. I will definitly hang onto it and give it another try.

Excellent.  The first cornbread my husband has ever liked.  I did make it a bit healthier by replacing half the butter with nonfat yogurt and one of the eggs with 2 egg whites.  It went great with "Bordreaux's Zydeco Stomp Gumbo"!

Yum, this cornbread is dee-licious!  Just the right amount of sweetness and tang, and it is very moist.  Perfect with chilli or any spicy dish.

This cornbread came out very well. I followed the instructions to the tee. It was a bit too sweet for my taste though. Next time I'll cut the amount of sugar. Also I used whole corn kernels and jack cheese. Yum!

This was excellent!  Considering I have never enjoyed cornbread that I didn't add a small can of cream-style corn in order to have it moist.  This was very good on its own.  My husband loved it!  Thank you!

This was definitely and unanimously the best cornbread I've ever made!  I doubled the recipe and put only 1 C of sugar total.  I buttered a round stoneware pan and heat it before I poured the batter in.  Thank you for this great recipe!  Oh, it was perfect with a little honey and butter :)

I made this cornbread with black bean chili. Four of us destroyed the entire pan in a sitting. Soft instead of tough like traditional cornbread. I modernized it a bit. I melted the butter in the microwave and used our stationary mixer to put it all together. Great !

Cornbread is a new taste for me. My first experience was at Monel's Restaurant in Nashville and I've searched for a similar, sweet cornbread recipe ever since. This one is darned close to Monel's! All it needs is warm peach preserves. (I don't know how to make those, either, but I'm looking for that recipe now, too.) Instead of peach preserves, I served it warm with strawberry jam and it was a hit. ...Pam

I also found this a little dry.  And I could taste the flour in it, as another reviewer mentioned.  Strange.  I might try it again though - perhaps I just left it in the oven too long.
