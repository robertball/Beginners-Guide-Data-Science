Very good and easy. I turned them into little mini muffin cups with oreo crumbs for the base instead of 1 larger pie. Very good and made about 48 individual servings.

I made this pie for Christmas last year and plan to make it again this year.  It was very easy but very good!  The only change I made was to purchase a "ready-made" Oreo pie crust (just to save time) and then I sprinkled additional crushed candy on top for decoration.  If you like peppermint ice cream, you'll enjoy this pie!

Thought it was fresh and delicious!  I used an Oreo crust and Andes Peppermint Crushed Baking Chips to save time.  Added some red sprinkles and Andes chips to the top and it was a perfect Christmas dessert!

Too sickly sweet to enjoy. Probably would be great with just softened peppermint ice cream molded into the crust and re-frozen. Will NOT make again!

This pie got raves from party guests (I also used a ready-made Oreo pie crust). Tastes exactly like peppermint ice cream! However, the texture was almost sticky - not sure why.  I did use 1/3 less fat cream cheese and the light whipped topping, but I can't believe that would make a difference. But it was quite tasty, and very easy!

This was great! The only things I changed was I added 1/2 a teaspoon of peppermint oil and I used a oreo pie. Also, I sprinkled red and green sprinkles on top and extra crushed candy cane. Looked really Christmasy. Make sure you serve it frozen and DO NOT let it sit on the table for awhile before cutting.

I don't know if it was just me or what, but this recipe made way too much and my shell couldn't hold it all!  14 oz is a lot of liquid for a 9" pie shell to hold.  Too messy.

Excellent Holiday recipe.  I also used the Andes chips inside, but crushed a few candy canes for the top.  I used fat free sweetened condensed milk, reduced fat cream cheese and lite Cool Whip.  It turned out great with these modifications!  As was previously stated, there was way too much filing for an Oreo crust.  All of my guests enjoyed this pie!

This was okay. You need to make sure that the peppermint is crushed enough.

This is delicious! Couldn't find the andes so I used regular peppermint candies like the recipe stated. VERY hard to crush so I switched to candy canes and it was much easier!
Also, I had a lot of filling! Too much for the oreo pie crust.

I was first introduced to this recipe over 2 decades ago.  It was good then and is still good.  I doubled up the recipe and used crushed oreo cookies in the bottom of a 9x13 pan.  This is really a great recipe.  Don't let the pepermint name fool you.  It does have it in it but with the other ingredients it mellows it out quite a bit.  I omitted the red food coloring.  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks.

If you like sugar, this will taste good, but for many it was too sweet.  I don't know what was wrong, but this never really froze.  It just got very sticky and the consistency of a very soft salt water taffy.  It didn't serve well.  I won't be making it again.

Made this for Christmas dinner yesterday. My husband has been asking for peppermint pie for a year now. :-) It was sweet but aren't desserts normally sweet? Make sure you smash up the peppermints really small so that it gives the pie the flavor and you are not hurting your teeth on hard pieces. There was too much filling for the crust but I put the rest in the empty cool whip container and put it in the freezer so you can eat it like icecream if you wanted or make mini, individual pies with it. Whatever your heart desires. I also chopped up Andes candies into tiny pieces and mixed half the box in the pie and the other half on top.

I am not sure what I did wrong, but this pie was so very sweet, and didn't set up. It was the texture of pudding and could have been served in bowls. It looked great, but no one at our Christmas dinner finished it - and the rest ended up in the garbage. I love the idea, but don't think I'll be using this recipe again.
