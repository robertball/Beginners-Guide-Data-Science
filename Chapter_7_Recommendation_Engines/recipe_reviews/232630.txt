This recipe was just ok for us. I really liked all the components in the dish but the frozen corn became slightly chewy. I cooked according to the recipe but maybe I just need to cook long enough to heat the corn and take off. I have made a similar recipe on AR using fresh corn and it is wonderful but it is not easy to find fresh corn in the winter. I will try this again but just experiment on cooking times and maybe even try a different brand of frozen corn.

I used it as a topping for broiled tilapia that was was seasoned with some Adobo and Smart Balance butter. I broiled the fish on one side and added the corn mixture after the fish was turned over. Very tasty

I really enjoyed this and so did my family. I made it as written mostly. The only thing I did different was add butter for part of the oil. My husband used it as a topping to his pork taco. Great recipe! Still will be on my regular rotation. Thanks.
