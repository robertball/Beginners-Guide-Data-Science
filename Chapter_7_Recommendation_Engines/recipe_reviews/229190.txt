Easy and delicious punch recipe!  Made it for a baby shower I was hosting (with white rum on the side) and it was hit.  I made ice balls with fresh mint and garnished the punch with it as well.  Will definitely make it again, thanks!

Made this with diet 7-up and made my own mojito mix. Tasted good but hard to get a lot of mint flavor in it.

Delicious and easy!  Made for a small winter party, and this was completely gone before anyone touched the soda!
