These were good but a couple of notes here. After you shred the zucchini you really need to place it in a colander and sprinkle it with salt and let it sit for 20 minutes to get some of the moisture out. That brings me to the subject of salt. If you are to make this as written it needs salt. You let it sit in the colander with salt and you've killed two birds with one stone. Lastly, the title. No need to call them fake crab cakes. Call them what they really are. Zucchini cakes. With all of that being said, this is a good recipe.
