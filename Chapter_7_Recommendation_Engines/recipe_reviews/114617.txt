Oh. My.  These were wonderful!  They make a lot though, so I froze half and they thaw wonderfully too!  I made the frosting a little runnier than called for, so mine were more glazed than frosted...still tasty though.  I froze the extras unglazed, and just reheat them on low power in the microwave.  

Just be sure when you cook them not to cook them at too high a temp or for too long...I found that my deep-fryer was not well-suited for this task, so I used my electric skillet with canola oil.

This was my first attempt at homemade donuts. These were quite tastey, but they were hard to knead/roll without adding lots of extra flour. To me they didn't taste pumpkin-y at all. And we just rolled them in cinnamon sugar rather than doing an icing. I might try to add more pumpkin, but I can't imagine using more flour that the 4 1/2 cups already called for to keep the dough from being more gooey.

These were nice. Less than spectacular but good with tea. I found them rather dry. I followed the recipe exactly but had it scaled down to half the recipe. The icing had a nice flavor but I had to add more milk, maybe something got lost in the conversion. I might make them again sometime...

These were very easy and delicious, even for my non-pumpkin eating family.  I made the mistake of cutting a few too thick but if you stick with the 3/8" noted they are fine.  We used a basic powdered sugar and lemon juice icing and they were wonderful!

We have a tradition of making doughnuts every Halloween season and this is the 2nd year I've made these doughnuts! The frosting is tasty! Great recipe!

I did not care for these. I was hoping they would be like the pumpkin donuts found at an apple orchard here, but sadly they are not even close.
They were too firm and thick as well.
Another problem, I had to add so much flour because the dough was way too sticky!

Really yummy!  I added just 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice to the dough as well.  The dough is supposed to be really sticky... just use plenty of flour when rolling them out and they will turn out perfect!  It made a lot, so we ended up taking some to neighbors as well.  Will DEFINITELY make these again!
