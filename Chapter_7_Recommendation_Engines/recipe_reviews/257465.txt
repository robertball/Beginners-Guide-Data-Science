Holy cannoli these are good!!! If you're looking for a delicious twist on the usual stuffed shells that use ground beef and cheese, this is it! The seasonings are spot on - no need to add anything else.  I used boneless country style ribs and the meat was just fall apart tender.  I followed the recipe exactly, except that I ended up adding a bit more  of the cooking liquid (about 1/4 cup more) to the meat mixture so it would be nice and moist.  Taking into account the broken shells that always come in a pasta box, I ended up with 30 very well stuffed shells. I also used a slightly bigger dish - 11 x 13 - to fit them all. While stuffing shells might be a little time consuming, the finished dish is WELL worth it. I will definitely be making this again. It would be a perfect dish to wow company!

These little jewels were tasty!  The recipe has lots of steps, so be sure to prep everything in advance.  I let the shells go 2 minutes under the recommended time, and then drained and let cool while the pork was going, so they would be easy to handle.  This pork recipe on its own is absolutely stellar, and I almost made soup out of the remaining pan sauce--sooo delicious!  I used smoked paprika, and the little bit of smoky flavor was spot on.   This is a beautiful presentation and totally guest-worthy, since the shells are a tidy way to serve pasta!

The pork was delicious, as was the sauce it was cooked in.  However the Barilla Traditional sauce that was with it totally overpowered the the flavors.  Both Hubby and I agreed this would be much better with a Mexican or BBQ type sauce.

These are really tasty! I made 1/2 a recipe to feed our family of 4, and still have enough left over for my lunch tomorrow. I cheated just a bit . . . as I decided at about 1:30 p.m. that I was going to make this for dinner tonight. I only marinated the pork for about 2 hours, then I sauteed it in my InstantPot for 3-5 minutes, then added the marinade & chicken broth and cooked it in my InstantPot on manual setting for 45 minutes. Worked great! The only thing I would change is to only boil the shells for about 8 minutes. The box says 9 minutes, but even at 9 minutes, mine were breaking slightly. They will continue to cook while in the oven - so no worries. Great recipe though, and one that I'd make again!
