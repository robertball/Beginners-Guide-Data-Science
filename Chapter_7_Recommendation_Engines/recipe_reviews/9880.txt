Really chewy!  My family doesn't like things too sweet, so I cut down the sugar to 1 1/3 cup, used chopped dates instead of pureed dates and 1 cup chopped pecans.  I used a 9X13 pan for 25-30min and they turned out excellent! I didn't roll them in sugar afterwards -- they were great just plain.  I think it would be too sweet if the full amount of sugar was used.

This recipe is the same as my grandmothers, except I don't puree the dates, I use chopped. I also use regular sugar to very lightly coat (I just cut them, I didn't roll into a ball) some of the chinese chews so we have them both with sugar and some without.  
I also tried using a glass pan and had to cook them longer, I will go back to using a regular 9 x 13 pan.

No need to roll these treats...I cut these into mini-squares and that's it! Maybe they were too difficult to roll because I used 1 cup of sugar, and 1 cup of chopped pecans. The end result has a consistency like a brownie. Definitely a keeper in my regular recipes!

Nice!  Didn't have enough sugar, so added some honey, turned out great, maybe next time will only use honey, instead of sugar.
