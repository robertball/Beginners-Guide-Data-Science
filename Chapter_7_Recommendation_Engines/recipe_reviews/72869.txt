I really liked this recipe. There are just a couple things I did differently. I made the dressing a couple hours ahead of time and refrigerated just the dressing to allow the flavors to blend. I then added the dressing to the potatoes while they were still fairly warm. Warm potatoes will absorb the dressing better than cold potatoes.

I've made this dish 2 times, and my family loves it!  I took the suggestion of one reviewer and put the italian dressing on the potatoes while they were warm, and placed the potatoes in the refrigerator to chill.  I then cut them in desired pieces, and added the remaining ingredients.  This is our choice of potato salads, we've tried the traditional ones, but we're hooked to this one!

Thank you for the idea to pour the Italian dressing over the HOT potatoes - the flavor of this potato salad is incredible.  I omitted the dijon and put in 3 or 4 times the amount of dill.  L-O-V-E this recipe.  It's a keeper for life!!  *I will reduce the amount of mayo next time just to save a few calories - it's creamy enough to make this adjustment.

Hubs said he didn’t care for this so much as it didn’t have enough “goo” in it.  He also commented it was on the bland side.  In my opinion he’s wrong on both counts!  What he didn’t love about it is exactly what I did!  It’s not overly gooey and mayonnaise-y – the dressing is lighter and fresher than the standard mayonnaise-based potato salads.  I didn’t use the commercial Italian dressing, choosing to make my own light vinaigrette (3 parts olive oil to 1 part white wine vinegar and a little minced garlic).  As for it’s being bland, what?!  You’ve got the fresh taste of the dill, the green onion and the tang of the lemon juice and Dijon.  What I really liked about this was that you could actually taste the potatoes!  So I guess this might be called a dressing for potatoes, not potato salad, where the flavor of the potatoes seems to typically get lost.  Three stars from him, five from me – four stars between us.

My family really enjoyed this.The only things I did different was I added celery and dill pickles. I also used a regular onion because it was what I had.Very good recipe if you like food with a tang.

Pretty much as is, except didn't have green onion so used regular.  And I always use fat-free Miracle whip and Italian dressing.  Different, and I liked it, but nothing that 'blew me away.'  I actually liked it better before refrigerating it.  Had I read them, I probably would have followed the others' suggestion to only add the Italian dressing to start.

Have made this twice and it was well accepted. Did as others said and put the Italian dressing on while potatoes were still hot. Had to cut potatoes in bite-size pieces because potatoes were large. Also added eggs & celery. Put all together then added mayo mixture. My 43 yr-old son still likes my "original."

Be sure to use Red Potatoes.  I didn't catch that in the recipe and therefore I didn't like it.  I just know the red potatoes would be so much better in this.

This potato salad is yummy! I was looking for a recipe for potato salad where I could lower the fat & cholesterol content without losing the flavor and this is the one! With regular egg & mayo potato salad, by the next day it might be tasting kinda stale. But this one is even better when it's "day old."  The only thing I'll do different next time...is make it the day before. Thanks Lukeysmom.

This is a great recipe. Everyone liked it even my non-potato salad husband. I also did a couple of things differntly, I added a few sliced up radishs for color and 3 boiled eggs dicing up the whites and straining the yolks into the the mixture and a lot more dill.  I think it's better after 24hr in the fridge.

Refreshing change from the regular mayo based recipes.  I took a tip from another reviewer and added the dressing while still warm.  Delicious!  The flavors were straight forward, nice, and had a good finish without one flavor overpowering the other ingredients.  Definitely use the Dijon mustard as it complements the salad.  Thanks Lukeysmom!

This was great really liked it. So nice to find a potatoe salad without eggs. I put in the Grey Pupon, it was great. I didn't want to buy fresh dill as I try to use what I already have on hand. I used 2 teaspoons of dried dill and it was great. I am sure the fresh would have been better. I served it with a recipe from this website Chicken salad 2, made sandwiches on wheat bread with some leafy lettuce. Perfect meal for a hot summer day. Prepare salads in the AM and by dinner time the flavors have been absorbed. Top off your hot summer evening with some cool Bahama Mama's also on this website.

This recipe is fabulous! I can't stand eggs, so I don't like normal potato salad... yuck! This one is wonderful, and doesn't have any eggs. As usual, I can't help but tweak recipes... and our family likes sauces so I added a little more of everything. I also added quite a bit more dijon, and quite a bit more dill too. I didn't have any green onions on hand, so I used some chives from my herb garden instead. It turned out FABULOUS, and everyone in my family liked it.

This is great! I used Ceasar Parmesan Vinegrette, miricle whip light, and fresh chives instead of green onions. Yumm! Dressing would also make a good veggie dip.

This was a refreshing change from other salads that I have had in the past.  The number of ingredients was simple and left the palette clean. Not to heavy on the onion or over powering on the dill.

My changes where... I cut the potatoes to about 3/4" to 1".  I just under cooked them so that when they finally cooled they were fork tender. I really like dill so I almost doubled the amount.  Because I made the salad a day ahead, that allowed some of the moister from the Mayo and Lemon juice to be absorbed in to the potatoes, and not be so goopy.  Finally, right before serving I added freshly cooked crispy bacon bits for a little crunch and a little saltiness.  Everyone liked and commented on the salad.

Enjoy.

Good! I wasn't sure about this at first, but it was a hit with everyone I served it to tonight. The flavor does get better the longer it sits. I used dried dill, as I didn't have any fresh on hand. Thanks :)

This is a delicious potato salad and it is tangy just as the name implies!  I might cut back a little bit on the mayo next time.

This was a hit at a family dinner.  So easy to whip up, and the few substitutions I made were light sour cream instead of mayo (healthier and tastier in my opinion), two diced shallots in place of the green onion (I prefer the flavor), and spicy brown mustard in place of Dijon (had it on hand).  Also, I did follow the suggestion of others and added more like two tablespoons instead of teaspoons of fresh dill.... it's yummy, and I had a bunch to work with, so why not?!  
I think I will attempt with Dijon next time as the white wine may pair better with the tang of the Italian dressing and the fresh dill.  Overall, this was a great side dish... creamy, tangy, and the fresh dill really brought it to life.  I dislike the usual potato salad because hard boiled eggs and celery are NOT among my favorite things, but this is a wonderful recipe that satisfied everyone.  It was a delicious (and healthier) alternative to the potato chips that we normally serve with cheeseburgers.  Yum!

This was just OK. Nothing blew me away by it.  I DO love the fresh dill in it- nice touch, but it was mediocre to say I'd put it in a rotation here at home.  I also subbed 1/2 mayo 1/2 reduced fat sour cream...

I really liked this one!  Very basic but flavorful.  I made up the sauce and let it chill for a day or so.  I also poured the sauce over the potatoes when they were still hot.  Next time I may add in some celery or other veggies.

Okay. I LOVE this potato salad. It's creamy without being mushy, there's no one flavor overpowering another. It just sort of melds into a tasty, slightly tangy salad. I can't express how much I appreciate a recipe I don't have to tweak, at all. I made this using Italian Dressing Mix (mixed per instructions) and had it with Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken. Great combo! Thank you very much for an A+ recipe!

I could never find a potato salad recipe that I liked so I thought I would try this one. I made it for the 4th of July and it was a big hit. My family said that I am now the designated potato salad maker at family get togethers. The one thing I did add to make it perfect was cut up hard boiled egg. Personally I just couldn't have potato salad without the eggs!

Increased the mayo to a cup, used fresh dill which I think was key, a tablespoon of dijon, and the juice from half a lemon in addtion to the other ingredients. Made this the day before serving so all flavors would meld. So good! Loved the Italian dressing in this. Will definately make again!

The mixture was a little too tangy immediately after mixing together - but overnight in the fridge was perfect! Even my husband who won't eat mayo-based potato salad loved this.

I really liked this, but the man was not 100% with me on it. I followed other reviewers' suggestions, and I added the dressing while the potatoes were warm. I wished that I had added more dressing though. Next time I will. I also used fresh dill from my garden. I will make this again, because I get tired of the same ol' thing, even if that is what his mother always makes!

I made this potato salad for our BBQ last night and there was only one little scoop left after the 6 of us were done eating, and that little scoop only lasted about one more our before one of our friends asked if they could have it...so in other words, this recipe is AWESOME!! I am in the process of making another batch as we speak because my fiance was mad that there wasn't any left for him today :) I will TOTALLY make this again!

This was great for our 4th of July BBQ! I used lowfat italian dressing and lowfat mayo. I added about 1/3 cup diced celery, and used only 1/2 cup of mayo. I also increased the lemon juice to 2 tsp. and added some salt. I would definitely make this again.

This was good. I love dill so I knew that I would love this as well. It's creamy and fresh tasting.  I took the suggestion of pouring the italian dressing over the hot potatoes. My daughter almost ate all of them that way before I could mix the rest of the dressing.  I mixed the dressing and refrigerated it without mixing it into the potatoes.  When I was ready to serve the salad I mixed the mayo/dill dressing into the salad.  I really liked the mayo/dill mixture. In the future I will use that as a spread on sandwiches.  I really preferred the way this tasted shortly after mixing. When I had it the next day it wasn't as creamy and the dressing had been soaked up.  All in all it's a good creamy dressing. Thanks for sharing.

Oooh!  This was really yummy!  I love potato salad, but really hate how the kind you buy in a tub at the grocery stores are always packed with onions!  I really hate onions.  But this only called for green ones (which I don't mind)!  That was pretty cool!  But baisically, it just plain tastes good!  It was perfect for my family's barbecue party.  Definitely a keeper.  =)

Really great recipe! The only changes I made were, I used Mayo instead of Miracle Whip (I wanted the creamy tast of the Mayo), red onion instead of green (I wanted a little crunch) and I didn't have fresh dill, so I just used the dried stuff from the spice isle. This would be a great summer evening recipe. Quite refreshing, and very smooth flavours. Good stuff! :)

This was very good!  I made it exactly as the recipe described except I used dried dill instead of fresh.  (I used bottled lemon juice but the recipe didn't say fresh or bottled)  I will definitely make this again but I will add a few more potatoes.  At the store I measured out 3 lbs of red skinned new potatoes but there was plenty of dressing so I'll add a few more potatoes next time.  I may also add chicken and make a cold meal out of it.

This is a great recipe!  I don't usually like potato salad, but this one has a great light flavor and the dill is excellent.  I left out the mustard, and I really don't think it needed it!

I originally learned to make potato salad from the old Betty Crocker cookbook so I've always covered the hot potatoes in italian dressing before chilling them and this really does make a big difference in flavor. I did half and half mayo and light sour cream and added just a touch of bacos at the end.  I made this with dry dill and it was awesome.

Delish!! I made this with the italian dressing on the hot potatoes as others suggested and it really allows the flavor to soak in. Also used red onions instead of green becaus that's what I had. Used 1/2 cup of light mayo and that was perfect. If I used the 3/4 cup would have been WAY too much mayo. Used only 1 tsp of dried dill weed since didn't have fresh. Also opted out on the Dijon Mustard.

No one in my household likes traditional potato salad. I was thrilled to find this recipe.  It's been made dozens of times in house over the years.  We too have taken up the practice of pouring the dressing on the potatoes while they are warm and making this a day ahead to really boost the flavor.  It's easy to modify the amounts of ingredients to tailor to individual tastes.  We put tons of extra fresh dill in ours.  We do think the Dijon mustard is a great addition.

This dish is now requested from friends and family for BBQs and picnics.

Very, very good! I added some fresh cut up cucumber (scooped out the seeds first) and used a Vidalia onion because I didn't have any green onions. Be sure to use FRESH dill. Quite yummy! :)

This potato salad is awesome! I had my parents over for a bbq and had made this for the first time, it was great, my mom even went back for seconds, which she rarely does! My step dad can't stop raving about it.

Delicious! I also put regular onion and celery in the mix.  Didn't have time to refridgerate before serving but it was still really tasty!  Next time I will use less mayo.  Thanks!

This really is a very good recipe for a potato salad.  It's different and the flavor combo of the dijon mustard and the Italian dressing gives it a tangy zesty flavor.  Tweak the recipe to achieve perfection.  Maybe a little more lemon juice and freshly ground pepper adds a nice touch otherwise pretty awesome!!!

I made a few changes...  I added chopped celery, chopped red onions instead of the green, I also added 2 hard boiled eggs, and sliced black olives.  I poured the Italian dressing over the potatoes, mixed 1 tbs. lemon juice with the mayo, the Dijon mustard and dill.  I had to add a little of the dried kind too.  Added salt, freshly crushed black pepper and 1 tsp. sugar.   I don't know if it's fair to rate it this way since I changed it so much due to personal taste... All I know is that it turned out great!

I followed the advice of several other reviewers and this turned out really well, except I had to add more dill to the mayo to get enough flavor going. Also it's a 4 out of 5 because it is an "adult" potato salad. The kids didn't like it at all. 

So here's what I did. I put the Italian dressing on the hot potatoes as suggested (this did make them very flavorful.) I added extra dill, a dash of cayenne and a bit of plain yogurt to give it a little extra creaminess with zip.

My family enjoyed this potato salad.  I liked the italian dressing as a new twist.  Really a good change from the standard potato salad.  I did add 1/2 tbsp. of sugar and a 1/3c. of sour cream just because I'm more of a sweet that tangy tasting person .  Also, since I did not have fresh dill, I used 1/2tsp. of dried dill weed.  But still would of been great w/o any modifications that I made.  I will make this again.  It was very colorful due to the italian dressing too.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!!

I made this recipe for my 4th of July bbq and everyone loved it!  I used low fat mayonnaise and a bit less fat free "zesty" italian dressing, and as the intro says, it was just as good with a lot less calories and fat.

Absolutely delicious.  I usually cut my potatoes smaller, I made an effort to buy red potatoes about the same size and did quarter them.  This made cooking them to the right doneness very easy.  I used 3 pounds of potatoes and felt that there was too much dressing for 3 pounds.  I’ll just add more potatoes next time.  I put cider vinegar on the potatoes when they were warm, will go with previous reviewers recommendations next time and put the Italian dressing right on the potatoes while they’re warm, then let them cool.

Loved the italian dressing and mayo combo which really brightened the dressing and highlighted the dill more than a only mayo dressing.  It was a great complement to the pulled pork sandwiches.

Like everyone says... if you don’t like potato salad, you might like this. It had nice, mild flavor and perfect texture, but not too sweet, and no flavor was overpowering. It does leave a bit of a clingy aftertaste, but unless this is all you are eating, it’s probably not an issue. I did put the potatoes in warm, so they would really pull in the ‘sauce’ (for whatever that’s worth).

Excellent, tangy, dilly! Exactly what is described.

I added a bit more mustard, I like my salad a little more... zesty.

(Edit) My guests thought it was bland. /shrug

Don't like vinegar or egg in your potato salad? Not an issue with this recipe! Using the suggestion of putting the Italian dressing over the hot potatoes was genius. I added celery for crunch and white onion because of availability. The medley of flavors and textures that came together pairs perfectly with both chicken and beef. This recipe is quickly becoming a summer classic!

I made this for the 4th of July and loved it. I thought the flavor was very good, thanks to the combination of Italian dressing and dill, which was just what I was looking for!

I omitted the Dijon and substituted sour cream the mayo to give it that tang of sour cream and to save  some calories. I think Greek yogurt could work too. 

Also the store was out of fresh dill, but they had the kind in the tube, which I usually don't use. I gave it at try and I'm glad I did. It worked out just fine and the flavor was excellent! I will definitely make this again.

I thought this was delicious.  Excellent review that read to put the Italian dressing on the potatoes while they're hot. I added celery and vidalia onion.  I omitted the dijon and  I did not have fresh dill however, the dehydrated dill worked very well.   A do-over :) Thanks

I followed another review suggestion to add the dressing only to the hot potatoes after draining them and then toss the other ingridients together and then gently toss with potatoes. I used Ken's parmesan italian dressing. I also used dried dill and not fresh. I chopped a small sweet onion instead of green onions and added a 1/8 tsp of kosher salt. I took the potato salad on a picnic on our boat to watch a poker run and everybody loved it. It is the best potato salad I have ever had.

I'm personally not a huge fan of mayonnaise in things, but this recipe was pretty tasty.  I ended up using rosemary instead of dried dill just because that was what was in my kitchen, but it was still pretty good.

Just needed more salt! Add it when cooking your potatoes in the boiling water.

Different, and good potato salad.  I have plenty of potatoes and plenty of dill (now I now why they call it dill weed!) so I thought I'd give this a try.  Bf thought it needed salt and pepper (he added at the table).  I thought it was good w/o salt and pepper, but it did seem to be missing something for me.  Perhaps some crunch?  To be fair, I had to leave out the green onions since I didn't have them, but that's the only thing I left out.  I think I might mean something like celery.  Still, this is very easy and most of the ingredients most of us have on hand most of the time, so it's very nice that way.  Thanks for the recipe!

We eat a lot of potato salad in our household... this is going on the Top 5 list. I got a huge bunch of dill in this week's CSA box - surprise! - and have been frantically searching for dill recipes. We don't care for the traditional dill potato salad recipe; this looked like a good alternative and, in fact, was even better than it looked. I used the Good Seasons Italian (the kind that you mix yourself in the cruet, made with both apple cider vinegar and balsamic vinegar), and followed the rest of the recipe proportions pretty exactly. I had no green onions so I substituted about 1 Tbsp of diced yellow onion. Also, it makes quite a lot of dressing - I had plenty for 5 lb. of cooked potatoes even when following the recipe amounts for the dressing. My whole family loves it - my husband, who is suspicious of "new" recipes, my daughter, who "hates potatoes". Great combo of flavors.

Very good variation to the plain mayo potato salad.  I used red potatoes and I MAY not have had a full 3# (6 good sized red potatoes).  It was very creamy, lots of flavor.  I did use the dijon mustard and also added about 2T of finely diced red pepper for color.  Thank you for this great recipe!

I like it!  I made it according to the directions with no deviations (except to salt my potatoes a little while boiling).  I like all my potato salad warm, so this is right up my alley.  Good stuff!!!

I didn't think this was very tangy, but I used fat free italian dressing.  That may have been the problem.  It seemed bland.

Made this for a Graduation Dinner and I found that I needed to add a dash of sugar. It just brought out all the different tastes and the guests loved it for the chg. of reg. old potato salad. I would serve it 99% of the time for summer dinners.

This is a very nice alternative to regular dressing.  The dill makes it pop.

Wonderful and easy recipe! My husband just loved it, which I was thankful for, considering how very easy it is to make.  Great flavor!!  I didn't have any new potato's, so just cut up 3 pounds of red potato's and left the skins on.  It did take a little longer for the red potato's to get soft.  I didn't have any fresh dill, so just used dill weed and added a little extra.  Very yummy and will definetly make this again and again.  Thanks for sharing it with us!

Great blending of flavors, was actually kind of skeptical to make this but was received very well.  Next time I will add something for a little crunch maybe radishes or celery. Thanks Lukeysmom

I liked this recipe a lot.  I loved the dill flavor with the Italian dressing - great combination!  Not everyone was a fan though - it's not for everyone.

It turned out with an okay taste but I think the italian dressing was a bit strong.  Maybe I used too much.  I do not think I will make this again
