This tastes just like what I order in my favorite Indian restaurant. For the most I followed the recipe exactly as written. I made two substitutions because of what I had on hand - nutmeg instead of cardamom and heavy cream instead of half and half and yogurt. I also need a new blender because my old one just wouldn't purée the sauce as well as I would have liked. The flavors were perfect, a little on the spicy side, and hubby agreed that this was a keeper.

This recipe turned out exceptional. I am just getting into Indian cuisine, but this is was an outstanding recipe. It turned out creamy and just like you would get from an Indian restaurant, I received many compliments on this recipe. Can't wait to make it again!

Man, I'm angry. I screwed up when I made this as I had doubled the recipe, but accidentally quadruped the tomato paste!

So taking that into account, I believe this to be a pretty good recipe - the tandoori masala definitely transforms the dish into a bright red Indian colour.

I will make this again, but next time I will add 50% more chicken, and possibly use chicken breast instead. I may add a couple of tablespoons of sugar as well.

Delicious, as are most butter chicken recipes.  I used six bone-in thighs (2 lbs), browned them on both sides as is, then added them to the sauce to finish cooking.  I also added some snow peas during the last few minutes for colour, and served with Basmati rice and naan bread.

This is fantastic! First time, I didn’t blend the cashews enough and it was gritty, but it tasted so good that none went to waste.  We serve this with jasmine rice. I have also made this with shrimp by following the recipe to make the saucy portion and the last thing is drop in your cleaned raw shrimp and only cook a minute or two and serve.

White American family with young kids. Everyone LOVED this! Used ghee instead of butter and half heavy cream and half and half because I ran out of cream. My hubby suggested leaving the onions out of the blender next time, because he thought it was missing some crunch in the texture.

It’s a bit of work, but very tasty! I was glad for the cook’s note about the spice mix since I had all of those spices and didn’t need to buy a pre-made mixture. I served over mashed sweet potatoes since I am unable to eat rice. The flavor profiles were complimentary although visually the dish was very orange. Enjoyed the dish!

Great recipe! My only addition was 2 tsp sugar at the end which I thought brought this closer to versions I have enjoyed most in the past. I added red peppers and a tablespoon of cilantro during the simmer at my wife’s request but the recipe would have stood perfectly well without them. Served on cauliflower rice in our case but got thumbs up, even from my picky 8 y/o.

This was my first time making butter chicken and this was a great recipe for it! Maybe just me but prep time was longer than suggested here. It was quite a labour of love! I don’t do dairy so I replaced with coconut cream. It was delicious, spicy, and everyone had seconds. I served it with saffron rice and garlic naan. I’ll make double next time.
