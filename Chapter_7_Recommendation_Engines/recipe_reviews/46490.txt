Good recipe, but I'd like to suggest making it more authentic by grilling the Hax'n, instead of braising it in a pot.  At the Oktoberfest and other large festivals, and in most Gasthäuser in Bayern, you’ll find gegrillte Schweinshax’n on the menu.  Grilling the hocks is what makes the skin so crispy (like pork rinds).  And you want to make sure they’re fresh, not smoked or cured.  I’d also recommend, instead of white wine, which no real Bayer would have with his Hax’n, a good Märzenbier or a Doppelbock.  Serve with a Semmelknödel and some Blaukraut, and you’ll have an authentic bairisches Schmankerl.  Prost! Brad

This is probably much easier to prepare and eat, than it is to pronounce!  I didn't find pig knuckles, by name, so I used the more easily found meaty hocks. Are they the same? To me, cumin does not seem particularly German and a pinch wouldn't add too much flavor, would it?  BTW, just how do you pronounce the name?

I made this for dinner tonight and my husband absolutely LOVED! I used one 2 lb boneless pork knuckle and followed the rest of the recipe as written (well, except I didn't have any leeks...) Thanks so much for sharing.  I'll be making this again soon!

Found this recipe VERY good, reminds me of when I ate it at the real Hofbrauhaus! The way to pronounce it is Shhh-vine-shacks-uh. Basically means swine shanks.

Quite good. the pork hocks came out very tender and the gravy in the pan was perfectly flavoured. the beer is unnecessary as i substituted water with a teaspoon of salt dissolved to sprinkle it with and it turned out fine. i just might suggest as well to add the veggies maybe during the last 1/2 hour or so of boiling since they came out too mushy by the time it was done.

I made this for Christmas dinner for my fiance, at his request. I was wary since I'd never done anything like this before, but it worked out pretty well. My one problem was that all of the liquid burned away before the meat was finished roasting, so watch it carefully and add more cooking liquid if needed. My fiance thought it tasted like what he had eaten in the Czech Republic (although our pork knuckles here are apparently much smaller). I have to say that I wasn't a fan of the pork knuckle itself, but if it's a type of protein you like and eat, then this is a good recipe for it.

I made this for the first time tonight. Wonderful! I didn't have leeks, but it didn't seem to make a difference. The meat was a little dry. I strained the extra liquid, and reduced it for about 15 mins. It made a great dipping sauce. Served with oven roasted Klondike potatoes and onions. Yum!

very tasty and easy to prepare; this is like what my mother used to make at home; when I was in Germany (Stutgart) I had schweinshaxe that were the very best - the skin was roasted more than this recipe & I will try to get there.

I grew up eating this and used to sneak feed it to our dachshund; nicknamed "Schweinhund". Altho it's still not my favorite thing in the world, I knew that my Scottish hubby would love it as he adores German and Austrian food. I'm happy to say that I wasn't wrong and he gobbled it up. Thanks so much Matti!!

Delicious!! Couldn't find pig feet though went to three different grocery stores. Ive never had it before so wasn't sure where to find it. Instead I substituted with pork hocks. Easy to make, very tender and juicy. I never used the cumin either as per requested by my guests who don't like spicy food. Everyone loved it. Definitely a keeper.

loved it, but I changed the timing a bit because we love crispy food
cooked it for 35 minutes, then turned on the broiler to high. the skin that was crispy was divine. next time I will flip the pork hocks to crisp both sides. everything was yummy. Served with basic mashed potatoes. Just as an FYI. I don't know how to cook, I know how to burn. Hubby says, my timer is the smoke detector. :)
