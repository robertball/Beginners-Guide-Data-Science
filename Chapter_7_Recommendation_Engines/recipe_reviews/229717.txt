Very good flavor and easy to make! I followed the recipe exactly except I make my own blueberry pie filling. For the filling I used 3 cups frozen blueberries, 1/4 cup flour, 1 cup sugar, 1 Tblsp butter, and 1 tsp cinnamon; cook over medium heat until thickened and continue to cook for 1 minute to cook the flour. Cool completely before adding to the cream cheese mixture. The pie turned out fantastic!!

Really good! I used low fat cream cheese, reduced fat graham crust and stevia sugar mixture.  Instead of cool whip, I made my own topping with non fat powdered milk, cold water, lemon juice and stevia sugar mix.(Recipe was on my box of powdered milk). I also left out the coconut. It came out well and hopefully reduced the fat, sugar and calories.

Super easy and quick to make! It has a light, fluffy texture and not overly sweet. This would work well as a summer dessert when you don't want to use the oven. I made it without coconut and it was just fine.
