This smoothie turned out an absolutely beautiful color! And since you eat with your eyes first....... Since I used mango that I had in the freezer, I omitted the ice cubes. This smoothie turned out very thick, so I also just used the chia seeds as a garnish on top. A bright color and a fresh taste!
