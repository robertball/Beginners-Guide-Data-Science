This is just terrific -- a new go to dish, great flavor, golden brown tastiness.  I find the patties don't stick together too well, and that it does not matter!  More egg and cheese might help, though that starts to compromise healthfulness.  Last time I just spread the mix across bottom of a large pan, turned it in parts as it browned, and it was great.  Extra paprika does not hurt.

Used frozen cauliflower rice which made it super simple. It was delicious but it seemed more like cauliflower cakes not hashbrowns. It was as good as any potato cake. This is on our weekly breakfast menu.
