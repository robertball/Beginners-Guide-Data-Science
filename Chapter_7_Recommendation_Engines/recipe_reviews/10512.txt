Absolutely disgusting!! It may be uncomplicated to make and rather unusual in its ingredients, but it tastes awful!

Very tasty and moist, although there is not much pineapple flavor, it's still yummy good!

I didn't make the pineapple icing, instead spread melted chocolate while it was still warm. I think that helped, because this is really not a sweet dessert. Also if you don't love off the track combinations, you may not like the pineapple-choco taste. We did, for sure.

Just made this without the icing but it still tastes amazing! Very moist and not too sweet.
