A big hit!  Especially loved by picky, toddler grandsons.  So easy - will make it again.

Very good.  Straight-forward, and yet not something I would have thought of.

Many recipes call for "buttered noodles". I have been searching for a recipe, ANY recipe, for this.  I didn't know how to make them.  They were perfect.
 Thank you for sharing this recipe:-).
