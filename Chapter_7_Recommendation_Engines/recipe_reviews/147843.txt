They are good, not great! I made them with dates and craisins and added 1/4 cup of flax seed. Very sweet and you don't feel too guilty enjoying them.

I changed some things around and its ok, might make some more changes next time. 

Instead of All-Bran I used Oats. I used cranberries instead of apricots. I used whole wheat flour. I used applesauce instead of the egg and oil. And I added a little bit of orange juice. 
I also added some nuts to the top.

I they came out a little chewy, I am hoping they harden up a little after they sit out. 

I might add some apples next time instead of the raisins.
