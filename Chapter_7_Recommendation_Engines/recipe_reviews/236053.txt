To give it more southwestern flavor, I add green chiles or jalepenos and sprinkle with chipotle chili pepper, and sometimes throw in black beans. Have also used crushed corn chips instead of corn tortillas. Can also add guacamole and sour cream after cooking, and it's good wrapped up in a flour tortilla. Here at 6000ft elevation, I increase the temperature to at least 375.

This meal was delicious. I made a few adaptations to it though.  Instead of the frozen fajita chicken,  I used chicken tenderloins,  seasoned them to my liking,  and cut them up.  I also added chopped onions and bell peppers to the soup mix for a little more flavor.  I took another user's suggestion and used corn chips instead of corn tortillas. The crunch was great.

Great recipe family enjoyed  it . I did make a substitution and added a can of mild green chilies instead of corn giving it a little kick.

Yummy overall, but more a soup than a casserole. I had loads of chicken left over from a fiesta birthday party as a substitution. I'll probably use more tortillas if I make it again, and add olives and green chiles with the cheese after taking off the foil.

I used Rotel tomatoes to make sure it had a Mexican flavor. I had to increase the baking time because the frozen chicken wasn't warm. BUT I will definitely make this again! So yummy!

Loved it! Only difference was I used canned corn and diced tomatoes with green chiles for a little kick and tortilla chips for a crunch! Sooo yummy!

Expected a Hispanic taste, but this tasted just like "Kings Ranch Chicken" with the addition of corn. I doubled the "Soup Mixture" and used 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel. I also had to increase the cooking temp. to 375. All in all, tasted great and easy to make.
