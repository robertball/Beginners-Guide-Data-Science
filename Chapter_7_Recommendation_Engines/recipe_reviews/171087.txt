I've heard a lot of good things about cocoa rubs and was eager to try this.  The taste of cumin was so bold it dominated everything else.

I made it this way: 1 tsp. each of salt, cocoa powder & instant espresso powder, 2 TBsps. brown sugar (omitted the regular sugar) and 1 TBsp. of everything else. I felt this kept the flavours in balance, without any of the components being over-powering. We rubbed it on chicken legs and baked on 350F for 45 mins. to 1 hour. I might increase the cocoa and espresso powder a bit next time.

Nice blend of flavors! And it still leaves room to add more heat if you want to.  I used about 3 tbsps. to season a batch of vegetarian chili, as I always add cocoa to my chili anyway so it made sense, and worked great!  Later I used some as a rub for boneless, skinless chicken thighs and breasts. I browned those and made a chicken, sweet potato, tomato and black bean stew.  Oh, I did also use the rub on slices of tofu, but it basically just tasted like dry rub on tofu - won't be repeating that one.  Much better suited for meats, stews, chilis, and maybe even some fish.  Thanks for sharing!

Great Flavor!  Used on grilled brisket and even on the charred (aka burnt) pieces it still was great!  It's a great deep and garlicy flavor with just enough sweetness to taste, but not over-power.  I did use only about 3T. of salt, but I don't think using the full 1/4c. would be bad....especially on a cut of meat without the thick layer of fat that the brisket had.  Loved it!!****UPDATE:  Great on beef ribs and chicken breast!  Love it!!

This is a wonderful reciepe.  And the flavors are FANTASTIC.  I only gave this 4 stars because as written is far to much salt.  So I would suggest decressing the salt.  It is also not made for the spice sissy as it has a pretty good kick.    I'll be lowering the ground pepper as well.  But the flavors are on point.   Wonderful and I will try again.

This was SO good!  I used all the ingredients, but didn't have enough cumin and garlic powder, so I upped the onion powder a bit.  I also halved the salt because I used this in a shaker bag with chicken legs.  Roasted them in the convection oven at 375 and they came out very tasty and juicy.  It made enough to thoroughly - perhaps too thoroughly - coat about 14 legs.  Probably a little intense for many, but everyone I served it to raved.  UPDATE: This time I made it with half the salt and no onion powder (on hand, y'know?)and took it to a pot luck.  I watched carefully - only adults took it, but they all finished it.  It was too dark, funky looking, and strong smelling for the kids.

I halved the recipe and it made enough for 4 chicken breasts.  Served "cocoa rubbed" chicken breast over alfredo pasta, we liked that it tasted like the blackened chicken pasta we order in restaurants. Very easy to prepare and the flavour had kick without being too hot for my liking.  Will be a pantry standby for us!

Wow! This rub was so tasty! I put it on thin slices of chicken and fried in olive oil. My boyfriend and I loved it. The only thing I changed was that I halved the amount of chili powder and black pepper and it wil still pretty spicy. I still have quite a bit of it left and can't wait to try it in something else.

Very tasty.  I used this on salmon.  I did decrease the chili powder and pepper down to 1 Tbls because I do not like overly spicy foods.  With this reduction it was very tasty.  I had used sea salt crystals and wish that they had been ground a little more as I did get a piece of salt during one bite that wouldn't have occured with a finer milling.

This is the best.  I adjusted somewhat. Up the dark cocoa to TBL and add a full tsp fresh ground dark coffee.  Used on ribs, ribeye (grilled and searing  skillet in the oven), slow cooker brisket and pork butt. I’ve passed it around and it wins. 

Best ever.

I made this for our steaks today and it was really good!   I cut back on the cumin a little because the one I have is quite strong and it was perfect.  Definitely a nice flavor for summer.

Used half the amount of salt after reading all the reviews. Overall a great flavorsome blend that went well with steaks. Hint of cumin was tad strong so may cut back next time.

With a slight tweak, this is a very versatile recipe; not just as a rub.  I decreased the salt to 1 tbsp, and found it also makes a good dip for chips or veggies.  I mix about 3 tbsp of the rub into a 6-8 ounce cup of plain Greek yogurt.  When using as a steak rub, I just sprinkle on a bit of salt as well, to compensate for what I took out of the recipe.  I've also mixed it with flour and/or bread crumbs (and a bit of salt) for oven-fried chicken.

Gives steak a real nice kick. We take the salt down a bit and make only half the amount shown here, and we'll still get a couple more meals out of it (store it in airtight container).
