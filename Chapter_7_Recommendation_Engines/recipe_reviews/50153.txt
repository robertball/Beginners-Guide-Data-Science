it's a little bit of work... but it's worth it!  the stripes look beautiful!  the chocolate stripe isn't that rich, so it may be more useful to use baking cocoa to get more a chocolatey flavor.

This was very moist, easy to make, and it came out looking impressive.  However, my guests weren't raving over it.  I would make again if I were looking for a piece of cake to ACCOMPANY something, such as ice cream sundaes or with fruit and such.  Tasted great - just not monumental!

I've been making this cake for years! I absolutely love it! Very easy and quick to make. I always add a bit more chocolate to it though.

Moist, yummy, easy and a great presentation!  I drizzled the cake with a bit of chocolate glaze and then dusted it with some powdered sugar.  This recipe is a KEEPER!!!!!
