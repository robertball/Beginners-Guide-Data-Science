This is so easy and tasty. I have made it several times and am planning on using this recipe in a few months for our staff cook off. I cannot always find the frozen vegetables, so usually use a can of sweet corn (drained), a can of black beans (drained), and a chopped red bell pepper. I don't bother chopping the chicken breast as it is easy to shred right before you are ready to serve.

Its a great start to a good chicken tortilla soup. We like super spicy so I added 6 garlic cloves, red onion, adobo sauce, cayenne pepper and jalapeño.  Now we're talking'!:)

The verdict from my family is :  "Make this again!"  I made the recipe as written with one small exception.  I reduced the chipotle powder to one teaspoon as the one tablespoon would have been too much heat for some of us.  The soup is delicious as is but to make it a little more substantial, I served it over rice.  This is a really good soup.  I always spray my crockpot with PAM and, as always, it made clean up very easy.  Thanks, "PAM" for recipe!

The only changes were (1) cut back on the amount of Chipotle  powder (2)garnished with cilantro, lime wedges, avocado  and a sprinkle of shredded cheddar cheese.   This recipe is a keeper!

Everyone loved it but it is plenty hot.  The Rotel gets hotter the longer it sits.  Great for those that love heat but if you don't want it that hot just use part of the Rotel.

Since I was feeding this soup to my grandkids I left out the chili pepper.  I substituted Swanson Mexican Tortilla Flavor infused broth for the broth and a cup of rice.  This is the kind of soup you can sub different spices, beans, or vegetables and it will still taste good.

Truly spectacular!  The seasonings are just right and the flavors meld magnificently.  I used chicken breasts instead of thighs, and I used canned beans, fresh peppers, and frozen corn because I couldn't find a southwestern style veggie bag in my grocery freezer.  After cooking in the crockpot all day, the chicken shredded beautifully and smelled amazing.  I ladled a bowl full and let it cool a bit while I sliced avocado and cilantro.  I added those, and threw a few blue corn ships on top.  The perfect combination of flavors and textures.  Yes, I will be making this again!

I used breasts, followed another suggestion and used a can of black beans, frozen corn and a raw red pepper.  I also did not have Rotelle so used diced tomatoes with a can of green chilis.  My family really liked it and as any of these recipes you can make it your own by what you have on hand!

Great soup if you like spicy. I made it in minutes in the slow cooker. I used a spoonful of chipotle adobo sauce instead of the powder. I added two extra cups of chicken stock and added a teaspoon of chicken bouillon powder as my chicken stock was low in sodium. We liked the crunch of the tortilla strips. The pam spray made the cleaning of the slow cooker a breeze.

I liked the convenience of using the slow cooker, and it is nice that clean up will be easy, by using the cooking spray.  We liked the soup.  I had to use a can of black beans and a can of fiesta corn, because the frozen southwestern style veggies were not available at my grocer.  I reduced the chili powder by half,  and added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of cumin.  If you use the low-salt chicken stock, as I did, the soup definitely needs the tortilla strips.  I like just about anything with avocado and sour cream, and the cilantro gives it real south-of-the-border flavor.

Very tasty soup for those that like it hot!   It has wonderful flavor, but it quite spicy.   We didn't add the optional cilantro, but did use sour cream in our individual bowls to tame the heat a bit.   My store did not have the southwest veggie mix, so I used fresh in its place.

The soup is very good,  I really like the heat is very intense,  I used fresh vegetables Instead of Frozen,  I love the crunch of the tortilla and the creaminess of the avocado, perfect for the cold weather

This recipe is very quick and easy to make. However, if you follow the recipe - this is VERY bland. There is absolutely no taste at all.

I love easy and I love spicy and this recipe was both. I doubled the amount of chicken and vegetables, but followed  the recipe otherwise. Saving the recipe to make again in the future.

I couldn't find southwest mixed vegetables so instead I used one can of corn, one can of black beans and one red bell pepper. I used regular chilli powder as I don't like too much spice. When it was done I added salt, paprika and garlic powder to taste. It tasted really good with avocado and cilantro.

Was good. Definitely needed the addition of the toppings. We had the cilantro and avocado along with sour cream and jalapeno-habanero shredded cheese.

Changed my original rating of 4 star to 5 when I made this tonight for the second time (Dec 2018). This time I did not make in the crock pot since I didn't have any chicken except for Costco rotisserie chicken. I had exactly 1 1/2 lbs of chicken, but  then it didn't look like it would be enough so I doubled the broth (2nd broth I used was vegetable because that is what I had), used an orange pepper because my red pepper was bad, also added a second can of beans and doubled the cumin and ground chipotle pepper because I doubled the broth.  Served jasmine rice as a side if anyone wanted theirs over rice (my hubby is from the South and likes EVERYTHING over rice). Simmered for about 15 minutes and tasted soooo good! Every one had seconds! Will definitely make this again. I think I liked it better because the chicken was chunks rather than shredded. I'm not a super fan of shredded chicken...just my texture thing.

This is super easy and very tasty. I used a can of corn and a can of black beans .  I also added a fresh green pepper, cut up small and fresh banana peppers (2) and a jalapeno pepper.  This is a bit spicy but if you don't like the kick, limit the fresh hot peppers.  Delicious.

This is a very tasty soup and I loved how easy this is to make by using the slow cooker .  I cut the chili powder in half to suit my family's tastes.  I really enjoyed this!
