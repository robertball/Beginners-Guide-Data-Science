Adding these ingredients to mashed potatoes is not exactly creative or inspired, but that doesn’t make these any less delicious.  Think about it…sour cream, cheese, bacon, chives, butter…mmmmmmm.  Perfect with our meatloaf supper.

I made this dish for my family. Wasn't a big fan of the recipe. I think it called for too much sour cream. It drowned out the flavor completely from everything else. If you do make it, I suggest adding the sour cream slowly to your liking. And maybe adding a bit of horse radish to give it an extra kick

Try it with garlic!!! There's no going back! And sometimes I'll throw in some of the bacon grease ;) And a little ranch seasoning!
P.S.  Nice name!

I made this twice and everyone loved it! No leftovers at all! My son asked for Italian Shredded cheese the last time so we added that instead and it sure gave us a new flavor! Loved it both ways! Making it aging for this Thanksgiving! ??

Have made these a couple time.   Added all the above and cream cheese for a little more flavor.  My father in law asks for these at holidays.

I've made this a few times for big get togethers and it a big hit. I tend to made larger quantities and place in a crockpot to keep warm and cook a little extra with the mixture all together. I also use a full pack of bacon and cut into strips the bacon wad out of the the pack. I use part of the ingredients as garnish looks and tastes great!

My husband requested mashed potatoes so I made these.  He loved them so much more than regular mashed potatoes.

This was so yummy! I upped the recipe to 20 servings for a Thanksgiving potluck and couldn't have been happier. A few things I did differently: I used about 75% peeled russet potatoes and 25% un-peeled baby red potatoes, 50% sour cream and 50% cream cheese, and cooked and crumbled the bacon the day before. They. Were. Delicious. Ended up with about 6 generous quarts that I kept warm in the crock pot.

They were okay but I think the recipe calls for too much sour cream and it messed up the flavour. Also I think I boiled the potatoes for too long so they were mushy. It made the mashed potatoes really goopy and sticky.

I didn't add enough sour cream, which is my own fault. But they were lackluster.

I had a craving for loaded potatoes (who doesn't ) and landed here and had all the ingredients, I only made two subs for the recipe one being I have some leftover Velveeta I'm desperately trying to get rid of so I cubed up some of that. The second sub I made was baking it in the oven for about 10 or so minutes. I love the flavor! The sour cream is amazing its like having mashed chips lol the flavor still blended nicely with the minced garlic I added despite only having about half a container from taco night. I'll definitely be keeping this recipe around.

I've made this several times and it's always a big hit, especially with the kids. Lord, even my extremely picky 6yr old ate it. Thanks so very much!!!!
