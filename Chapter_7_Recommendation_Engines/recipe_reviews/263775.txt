I used new mixed potatoes, asparagus, baby carrots and onions along with chicken apple sausage. Very easy to make and delicious.

This is easy to make and very tasty.  I think this would be a great recipe for dinners with a large number of guests.  Switch out the sausage to the one that you prefer.  There is a lot of experimentation that you can do, but the recipe posted is great.

So so delicious!! We are a family of three and I double this because we love the leftovers so much. The dipping sauce is the icing on the cake. I never measure anything out in ounces, so to double the recipe I used:

The recipe is very filling and even tho I had excluded a few of the root veggies, beets and sweet potatos as I don't like those; and parsnips aren't in season at the time I'm writing this it was absolutely delicious.  I am definately making this again
