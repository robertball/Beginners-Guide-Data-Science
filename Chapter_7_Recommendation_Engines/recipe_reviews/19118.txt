I made this recipe,but I added about a tablespoon/table spoon in a half of cornstarch mixed with the evaporated milk,to thicken since some people said it was a little runny.I chopped up my pecans,(only about a half cup or less)about a 1/4 cup of lightly roasted coconut.I finished making the frosting then let it sit for about an hour,it thicken up nicely but not too thick to spread.I frosted it on a nicely refrigerated german chocolate cake and it spread magnificiently.I sell cakes/pies/cookies and food and this cake was gone in 2 minutes or less I kid u not.It was a huge huge huge hit.Also to note,I never liked the frosting on the german chocolate cakes before,due to too much coconut too sweet etc... but this I added to my own liking on the coconut and pecans.It also tasted sweet when I tried it(which made me skeptical)but when it was on the cake the cake isnt that sweet mixed with the frosting it was perfect just perfect I tell u.An A+++++++++++++++++if not better.Thank you thank you thank you.

This came out wonderfully, very rich and sweet though, so don't feel the need to really glob it on your cake, just a thin layer is good enough!  As far as those reviewers suggesting to add cornstarch, I've got to say 3/4 of the way through cooking I was tempted to throw it out and start again with cornstarch as it was still really thin.  But then I just decided that the problem was that on low heat it would take forever to caramalize the sugars enough to thicken the milk.  So I just turned up the heat, started stirring like mad, and it did thicken beautifully.  I would think that if you did this AND added cornstarch your resulting frosting would be the consistancy of rubber boots, so if you're too scared to turn up the heat, do the cornstarch, if you're no stranger to candy making, by all means leave the cornstarch out and crank the heat up after all the ingredients have gotten warm on low.

How good is this recipe, it's easy to make and delicious. The reviewer that suggested adding cornstarch to the evaporated milk was right on target.  I turned out beautifully. I also toasted the pecans and coconut.

This frosting was fabulous!!  I did not alter any of the ingredients listed.  I agree with other reviewers, it does NOT need cornstarch.  Based on other reviews, I added all ingredients, except the vanilla and nuts, into  saucepan and cooked over 2-3 level heat for about 6-7 minutes, stirring occasionally (while it was warming, I toasted the coconut and pecans in the oven 5 min at 350).  Once the butter was thoroughly melted and the mixture was smooth, I turned up the heat to between 6-7 and continued to cook for another 6-7 minutes until the mixture started to boil.  After it started to boil, I continued to cook, stirring constantly, for another 6-7 minutes.  At the end of the 6-7 minutes, the mixture should just be getting into the soft candy stage (higher than 200 deg).  If you are unfamiliar with this, it will seem like the mixture is starting to pull away from the edges of the pan and the bubbles will start making a popping noise more than a rolling boil type sound.  Once it reaches this stage, I cooked for about 2 more minutes then removed from heat.  I added the vanilla and mixed to blend then added the toasted cooconut and pecans.  I left the mixture in the sauce pan on the back of the stove as I made the cake.  By the time the cake was cooled, the frosting was a perfect consistency and was the exact amount needed for a 13x9 cake.  Turned out magnificient, looked great and tasted even better.  Thanks Carol!!

This was very good!  I also took other reviewers advice and added 1 Tbsp of cornstarch to the evaporated milk.  When it was not thickening I brought it to a boil and immediately removed it from the heat and kept stirring it and that did the trick.

This icing was wonderful! I made a chocolate bundt cake, and poured icing on top. It made a beautiful cake. I received great reviews from my guests! I did add 1 tablespoon of cornstarch to evaporated milk, and used real butter rather than margarine. I will definitely be using this recipe again!

Wow! I made this frosting with Dark Chocolate Cake II for my husband's birthday and it was fantastic! I did use 1 TBSP of cornstarch to help thicken and it came out perfect. I will be using this recipe again and again!
UPDATE: I made this frosting again and used walnuts instead of pecans and I ran out of eggs so I used an egg beater in place of one of the egg yolks. It still turned out excellent! This frosting has instantly become a favorite!!!

This German Chocolate Cake Frosting II is the best I've ever tasted and my guests feel the same way. Toasting the coconut and pecan chips first gives it the taste that stands out. Thanks for a great recipe. I'll definitely be making this again.

Delicious! I used two whole eggs (just tempered them with the hot milk and sugar), toasted the nuts and added just a pinch of salt. This thickened up beautifully but it was my first time so it might have been luck. Thanks for the recipe.

Even though I didn't have all the ingredients,and had to wing it, this recipe is a great basic icing!! I'm only 20 and just starting to really get into cooking, but this was super easy!!  It's also a very forgiving recipe, I was halfway through making the icing and realized I had forgotten the butter.  I added it midway through and it turned out great anyway.  The cake was extremely moist, oozy even.  A+++++++++++++++

This is grans recipe, without the teaspoon of water (not needed) along with another 1/3 cup coconut and use BUTTER instead of margarine.  Needs no extra thickeners when using butter.  Needs to boil over medium heat about 12 minutes.

I have made this recipe maybe 25 times in the past year. I have made more than 25 German Chocolate cakes, most for our church dinners and a few for my family. To be honest, I started out making the cakes from scratch, but with this frosting, no one notices the cake. So now I use boxed cakes but get RAVE reviews for any cake that has this frosting on it!  I make the recipe exactly as written and just have patience waiting for the frosting to thicken. I do not add any thickening agent: if you are willing to wait, it WILL thicken up and you will be rewarded with an out-of this-world flavor.  I attend a church with many amazing bakers and cooks but my German chocolate cake has gone over so well, it was even mentioned in the pastor's homily. Trust me: it's not my cake, it's this icing that people remember. Carol, you have made my cakes a hit! Blessings to you!

I made a couple changes and this came out INCREDIBLE! First I baked cupcakes using a box of german chocolate cake; and I also made a 1/2 batch of the Rich Chocolate Frosting (also from this site).  These three components went very well together, balanced out the sweetess.  I did NOT find this mixture too sweet when balanced this way. I took most of everyone's comments and came up with the following adjustments to this recipe: I added 1 T cornstarch to the milk; I did 1/2 C white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar; I used unsalted butter instead of margarine; and I used 1 1/2 C flaked coconut and 1 1/4 C pecans - this gave it a thicker consistency.  I also toasted the coconut and pecans lightly and let them cool before adding it to the mix.  I cooked it a while to get it pretty thick.  And finally, I let it cool about 15 mins before using.  These adjustments yielded a 5-star recipe that everyone raved about at the Oktoberfest party I brought them to. Will definitely keep this and make it again.

This is a great recipe for a very fancy frosting. The directions should state cook stirring constantly until thick, I cooked this for at least 10-15 min. Don't give up it will thicken. Remove right away when it does because it can get too thick.  If your familiar with making candy you will understand the concept better.  Enjoy!

To those having a problem with the frosting being too thin...make sure you are using 1 cup...not 1 can of evaporated milk.  I made that mistake the first time I made this but I've never had a problem since I figured out what I did wrong.

This is a delicious recipe!  Next time, I'll keep a few things in mind.  This recipe makes enough frosting for a 9x13.  If you want to frost and fill a tiered cake you'll need to double the recipe.  I like big chunks of nuts, however, they kept falling off the side of the cake.  Next time I'll chop them finer.  After I leveled the cakes, I used the dome-tops and made a trifle by layering cake, frosting and whipped topping.  Pudding and toffee pieces would be a good addition too.  Two desserts from one baking -- gotta love that!  My hubby enjoyed the trifle so much he went back for seconds.  My friend will love her tiered birthday cake decorated with Dove chocolate pieces! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!  Update:  I cooked the sugar mixture to 200 degrees.  Toasted pecans in the microwave by putting them on a plate and stirring every two minutes until they smelled toasty - about six minutes. I might try chopping the coconut, as the shreds "pulled down" the frosting on the sides.

As I was cooking this I got a little bit worried. It seemed to be really thin, but I didn't have any cornstarch to use as some people had suggested. So I turned up the heat and cooked it and cooked it, and it thickened up really nicely. After stirring in the nuts and coconut I was happy. I put it on some brownies for my boyfriend's birthday. Excellent! :]

This frosting tasted delicious!! HOWEVER...it was SOOO RUNNY!! I followed the directions just as the cook wrote out.....and at the end I realized I had forgotten to add the cornstarch as everyone else had suggested......So I added it to the mixture....and it did not help at all.....I added more and more...until finally I realized it was not helping and altering the texture of the it....  So there must be a trick or something with activation when you mix the cornstarch with the evaporated milk...b/c it didnt work when it was all over and done with....I would try this again, because the flavor was excellent like I said...there was a heavy topping of coconut/pecan ingredients, and beneath that was all the liquid...  It was a waste, we didnt even use it...HOWEVER, the chocolate cake recipe I used was "Too Much Chocolate Cake" and it was heavenly...mmm...i'll be making that cake again for the 4th of July coming up.   I just cant figure out why the cook would give a recipe that wouldnt come out right...  The miserable part was that it wasted my time, and money... the other recipe I made was baklava and it turned out great lol, better luck next time "?"

Great Recipe - FAULTY DIRECTIONS!

In some of the other recipes someone suggested using cornstarch cause the frosting was thin and drippy.  Yuck!  Do not use cornstarch!  The problem is the level of heat.  You must get the sugar to carmelize--so the mixture thickens properly. 

Bring the: evaporated milk, sugar, egg yolks, margarine and vanilla mixture to a boil...or almost boil. You can start on low heat, but unless you want to stir all day...bring the heat up until you start to see it boil. Yes, stirring constantly.  Don't leave the stove!  Then poor your mixture over the pecans and coconut, mix well.  Cool thoroughly before using!

Oh, btw, a 12 oz can of evaporated milk is a cup and half.  Maybe that is why some people said this frosting was runny?  Unless you buy 8 oz cans of evaporated milk, you'll have leftover evaporated milk.

The other change I made was I added more pecans and more coconut.   (I added these after I made the frosting per the measurements stated in the recipe). After testing, I wanted more coconut and pecans.  The other change was: real butter, not margarine.  Ask any cardiologist which is worse for your health...butter or margarine.

I made this recipe, doubled so that I may coat the inner layers of 3 - double layer 8"cakes...It appears to be JUST enough... 
I read the reviews before I made it and WITHOUT Cornstarch it came out thick and perfect...I was worried about it being too thin and about adding cornstarch just in case I got a pasty flavor. I followed the recipe to a 'T'. The only thing that changes was the cooking method. Added all ingredients to the sauce pot, set to low (2-3) and stirred to blend every minute or so. 5 minutes later when all ingrediants were warm I increased the temperature to a boil (6-7) It came to a boil very quickly so don't leave it, stir!!!! approx. 3 minutes later I turned it off, added the coconut and pecans (untoasted) and stirred. let it cool on the stove, already thickened and placed the whole pot into the fridge. Taste was perfect, plenty sweet and in my opinion better and worth the 8minutes it took on the stove. A pretty simple no fuss recipe...WILL MAKE AGAIN. NO need to alter!

This frosting was so good. The only issue I had was that I didn't make enough. Next time I will double it.

Although it seemed that I had to cook the frosting quite awhile it was well worth the time spent it ia absolutely the best frosting I have ever made.

I took two of other reviewers ideas and this came out perfect. First, I turned up the heat and stirred like crazy,no cornstarch and it was perfect! I only added 1/2 cup of pecans and 1/2 cup of coconut and again that was perfect for both me and my husband! Thanks for a grat recipe! I'll be making this again!

The frosting tasted extraordinary, I'm only giving it 4 stars because it is tricky to get it to behave.  The first time I made it I followed the reviews advice and added cornstarch, I then turned up the heat, stirring constantly, cooled it, and it turned out perfectly, the second time I tried it without the turning up the heat as high and the frosting did not solidfy at all, but it ended up being even more delicious then the first time.  I ended scooping out the coconut/peacans and spreading it around the top of the layers, and then pouring the syrup all over the cake.   I let it sit in the fridge for a while, took it out, and used a paper towel to wip up the excess liquid that had leaked out of the cake, and then I melted some chocolate chips in the microwave in a plastic bag, cut off the corner of the bag, and drizzled chocolate all over the top, and using a knife, spread the chocolate all over the sides.  The effect was incredibly, the chocolate locked the moisture in the cake and it tasted even better than the first time, you can see pictures of this second attempt under my photos. also I suggest toasting the peacans and coconut before hand

I made this frosting for a Duncan Hines German Chocolate boxed cake mix instead of a homemade cake in order to save time and it was very good. The frosting helped make the cake look like it was from scratch.  I did not have margarine, so I used butter instead and did need to add corn starch to thicken it up a little.  I had left over frosting, so I put it in a container to use later.  The ABSOLUTE BEST way to eat this cake/frosting is to cut a thick slice, add additional frosting mix and microwave for about 30 seconds!!!  I would have rated this frosting/cake combo 4 stars, but after tasting the warmed frosting and cake I'd give it 6 stars if I could!!

Great frosting for brownies! I cut the recipe in half and I used it to frost both an 8 x 8 and 13 x 9 inch pan of brownies and it was a perfect amount. I used sweetened condensed milk in place of the evaporated milk and sugar but I found it a little runny before I started frosting so I added more coconut and some powdered sugar to thicken it up a bit. It had a bit of a milky taste while it was still warm but once it cooled it was fantastic. I've been keeping my brownies (with this icing on them) in the freezer and eating them frozen and they taste even better.

Awesome frosting!  I didn't have a problem with it setting up.  I used real butter instead of margarine, so that might have made a difference.  I only added 1/2 c of coconut and I thought that was plenty.  I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/4 c of white sugar.

This was an excellent recipe.  After reading the reviews and the comments about the frosting not setting up I tried adding 1/2 of the butter the recipe called for.  It turned out EXCELLENT!  Thickened nicely, flavor was superb!

I thought this was WAY too sweet. So, I ended up adding 2 squared of Unsweetened Baking Chocolate. It made it taste much better, but in turn, changed the consistancy to something like pudding. Not to bad over the chocolate pound cake I served it with, but I was expecting something better. Sorry :(

Thanks to "Dana" for the detailed review on how to thicken it over higher heat.  Use low heat until all is well blended, increase heat to boil 7 min until bubbles change to pop and pulls from edges, boil 2 more mins.  No cornstarch needed.  Delish.  Perfect for a 9x13.

I just made this about an hour ago and it is yummy! I altered the recipe to my liking. I used half brown sugar and 1/2 regular sugar. I also altered the recipe to be able to use the whole 12 oz can of evaporated milk. So: 12 oz evaporated milk, 3/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup white sugar, 4 egg yolks, 3/4 cup butter, 1 1/2 tsp. vanilla extract, 1 1/2 cups chopped pecans, and 2 cups of flaked coconut. It was enough to fill my chocolate cupcakes with some of the frosting for filling and I made a chocolate shelled border and topped with remaining coconut pecan frosting!!! Posted up a pic, you will not be disappointed so delicious!!! Happy Baking Everyone!!! :)

This turned out perfect without any additional ingredients (i.e. cornstarch). You have to simmer, stirring constantly, until everything is combined and smooth. At that point (roughly 5 minutes), turn the heat up until you get a hard boil. You will want to make sure you are stirring because the egg could still scramble. I advise boiling until you see the mixture change texture - it's hard to explain but once you see it, you'll know. Very similiar to candy making which is essentially what you are doing here (I won't bore you with all the science-y stuff), but trust me, if you boil it hard you will not need the cornstarch. Mine changed after about 9 minutes of constant boiling but it all depends on temperatures. I'd also advise unsweetened coconut be used as it can be a touch too saccharine with the sweetened.

This recipe tastes good, but it takes forever to thicken enough to be able to spread on a cake. I added the cornstarch based on another review, but that didn't seem to help thicken the mixture. Even after 30 min., still not thick enough to spread.

I made this tonight and the only thing is I didn't think it was getting thick enough but I used some corn starch like some other people suggested and it got to the consistency I was looking for. It is really tasty and  makes the cake look really beautiful.

This frosting is amazing! I had been searching for a good frosting recipe that isn't icing sugar based because I have a lot of diabetics in my family, and this fit the bill. Instead of using 1 cup of white sugar I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar Splenda.  I was worried about how well it would thicken up with the smaller amount of sugar, so I cooked it on medium heat and added 1 tbsp cornstarch for good measure. It turned out great!  Will definitely make this again!

Admittedly this is not the best looking cake out there, but I cannot tell you how delicious and perfect the icing was to my German chocolate cake. Everyone made me swear I actually made it and didn't buy it because it was that good. I used butter since I didn't have margarine and it took 20 minutes of constant stirring before it thickened up but well worth the effort.

This is so insanely good! I never liked German Chocolate Cake until now. If it weren't piggish, I would eat the frosting alone with a spoon. I wish I could give it 6 stars. YUM!

Excellent. I only changed the margarine to butter and kept everything else the same. I think butter is needed for a better taste. I did cook it for 20 minutes and let it set for another 15 before frosting the cake as another reviewer suggested and it was perfectly delicious.

Although I do not personally eat German Chocolate Cake because I am not a fan of coconut, this got gobbled up. I got rave reviews and it was super easy to make. I used a box cake mix and everyone said the icing was perfect so no one even knew I used a box cake!

I was prepared after reading other reviews. I cut this in half to use with homemade brownies. I included cornstarch, switched to brown sugar and toasted the coconut but not the pecans. I would just warn everyone to use UNSWEETENED coconut. With the brown sugar the flavor is caramel-like and it has the darker more appetizing brown color.

This frosting was BOMB!  LOved it!  My husband is a German Chocolate Cake Fanatic and this frosting blew him away!  I did NOT add cornstarch.. the recipe was right on!  Patience is a virtue.. Stir continuously and after about 7 minutes it will happen.  Then, stir really fast.  I toasted the coconut and the pecans before adding them, which added to the wonderful flavors.. Will definitely make again.. THank you!

I followed the recipe exactly, using one cup of evap. milk (not 1 can) and this frosting came out perfectly!  It thickened quick & nice when you turn up the heat and stir like mad per other reviewers. This frosting was out of this world! Thank You!

This turned out great. I took some of the advice from the reviews and used half a cup of white sugar and a half a cup of brown sugar and added a Tbl.sp.of corn starch to the milk. It thinkened nicely, got thicker as it cooled. Easy. Thanks.

Dynamite frosting!  I paired this with the Dark Chocolate Cake II from this website and it was pure decadence.  Definitely add 1 tablespoon cornstarch to the milk - thickens it up beautifully and quickly - about 8-10 min and it's done.  I decreased the sugar to 2/3 cups - was plenty sweet in addition to the sweet coconut and used butter instead of margarine. So easy and yields gourmet results.  Will make again and again. **update** save any extra to put on warm buttermilk pancakes instead of butter---soooo good!  will taste like something from a B&B.

Takes a long time to cook and thicken - I like the original GC frosting better.  Also, this does not make enough frosting.  The original recipe from Bakers Chocolate is much better, IMO - same ingredients, but proportioned differently and it works a lot better to thicken.

Very pleased with the turn out and will use again. I did not have the evaporated milk, so i used what I did have on hand and altered it a bit,(1/2 can of sweet condensed milk and 1/2 can of whole milk). Due to using the sweet condensed milk I also used 1/4 less sugar. It turned out great. My husband took it to work for one of his employees birthday. There was none left over for him to bring me home a peice.

This is the greatest recipe!
I changed a couple of things: I used 1/2 c. of white sugar AND 1/2 c. dark brown sugar instead of plain white sugar. I also added an additional 1/2 c. of coconut. Instead of traditional German chocolate cake mix, I used a DEVIL's food...This sucker flew within the hour!

I used a can of coconut milk instead of the evaporated milk, and substituted 1 1/2 cups of powdered sugar along with a 1/4 sugar, and omitted the margarine.  I had to reduce and watch constantly for a half hour, but it was worth it, especially if you love coconut and want to use a healthier fat.  This turned out great!!!! (I couldn't stop eating it from the bowl, lol)

This frosting was awesome.  It cooked up just fine for me.  For those that think this is turning out runny, try cooking at higher heat while constantly stirring... this thickened for me in about 15, maybe 20 minutes.  And also, you can add more coconut to thicken it.  I had never tried to make this icing and it is just so much easier than I had thought it would be.  Don't be intimidated, it really is simple and tastes GREAT!!!

1. Make chocolate cupcakes
2. Frost with Nutella.
3. Pile on German Chocolate Cake Frosting.

The hazelnut flavor in the Nutella works great with the pecans in this frosting! So good!

This has a wonderful taste! I had to increase (medium low the temperature of my stove and cook for quite some time to get it thick. I slathered it on brownies after it cooled for a bit.

First time making this instead of buying it in the store - superb! i added the cornstarch just because i tend to listen to reviewers. I also used a whole 7 oz bag of coconut too and probably more than a cup of pecans. Yummy in my tummy! I'll try not to use all of this on the cake so I can eat it out of the fridge :o)

Added 1tbs cornstarch to the milk before starting the heat, turned out great. You must remember that it takes a while to thicken, just like gravy.

I made this on Christmas and everyone loved it!! I did not add cornstarch, but I did turn the heat up after about 10 minutes to help it thicken. After I added the coconut, it ended up being the perfect consistency. I will never try another German chocolate cake frosting; this one was perfect.

This is a delicious icing recipe.  I used butter and roasted the coconut flakes and pecans at 350 for about 5 minutes.  I cooked and constantly until it reached 190 degrees.  It made for some good eating on my birthday : )

I followed the instructions exactly but it did come out very runny. I'm giving it 4 stars because the taste was great and I think it has potential. Next time, I think I will allow the liquids to come to a boil for a bit allowing it to thicken, like others suggested. Then I will probably also wait for it to cool before frosting (so that it's warm, but not still hot). Also, my brother ate it and suggested grounding the nuts finer and using less nuts and more coconut. I think this would make it easier to spread.

I made this - used unsweetened coconut flakes and butter instead of margarine. It came out perfect. It didn't say how long to cook - just until thick - which took a while... maybe 10 minutes?  Simply perfect.

Absolutely great as is.  You don't need to add cornstarch--just cook it at a lower temperature and you'll get the texture and consistency you need.  2 thumbs up!

Despite suggestions to add cornstarch, I did not. Instead, I pulled out a book and let it cook on low stirring constantly for about 45 minutes, added the pecans and coconut, and put it on. It came out the perfect thickness! Easy to do despite the time, and tastes great =]

This was the first frosting I've made that i actually had to cook so I was admittedly a little nervous, particularly with the eggs in it but it turned out great!  I did have to increase the heat just a tad to get it going, then lowered it back down again.  One of my tiers wasn't quite ready for frosting yet, so the frosting cooled a bit.  I didn't see any difficulty at all putting on the frosting slightly cool thankfully so if you run into the same problem don't worry about it :).  I didn't really feel like making a cake from scratch so I just used a boxed German cake mix and it worked great.  I'm pretty sure this cake is definitely going to be made again!

This is seriously delicious.  i used the "black magic cake" recipe also found on this website to go with it.  I found that the frosting thickens on its own if you simmer if for a bit and then even more so when it cools.  Also, i used unsweetened coconut flakes and i thought it was perfect.  i think sweetened coconut flakes would have made it too sweet.

This tasted great, but I felt the directions are a bit unclear...how thick is thick?  I removed the mixture from the heat as soon as it got thick, but then it never completely set up.  It was definitely runny, even after letting it cool completely.  I'm wondering if I had kept it on the stove a little bit longer if it would have gotten thicker...I'm not sure.  I poured it on the cake, anyway but had to keep it refrigerated.

Comes out better than the stuff in the jar that just sits on the shelves, that's for sure! I like toasting the pecans first before adding to the saucepan. Gives it a very distinct flavor. I also made sure they were unsalted pecans and then added 1/2 tsp salt to the mix. Substituted the margarine for butter. I also made this traditional recipe using hazelnuts. It was sooooo good!

This was delicious and the perfect topping to the German Chocolate Cake III recipe. I had the same problem as some of the others where the frosting wasn't thickening -- it was because of the low heat. Turn the heat up to high in the second half of the cook time and stir quickly to thicken the frosting.

completely awesome - will definitely make again.  was not runny at all after adding the coconut flakes; the icing will thicken and harden after being poured on the cake.

Unbelievable.  Could have eaten entire pan of frosting alone!  I put this on top of the "too much chocolate cake"-minus-the-chocolate-chips.  Wow.  I toasted the pecans and coconut.  I used fat free evaporated milk and the 1 to 1-1/2 tbsp of corn starch like suggested.  It set up perfectly right around 5-7 minutes as I was stirring in the boiling pan.  (stir--it will start burning the bottom fast)  Will make again and again and again.

5/10/10 Did it again but didn't have evap milk--just had fat free sweetened condensed milk.  I omitted the sugar and used my condensed milk.  Worked GREAT!

At a authentic German festival I tasted a frosting that was fantastic.  This basic recipe, add the 1 1/2 TBSP of corn starch to the sugar before adding it to the pan, the key ingredient was adding 2 TBSP of dark rum at the end with the coconut and pecans.    FANTASTIC flavor-  No disappointment!

we think the frosting tasted excellent. we put the coconut and pecans through a food processor then toasted it all at 350 degrees for about 5 minutes. the frosting NEEDS to be thicker. we suggest added two tablespoons of cornstarch.

This recipe got rave reviews from our birthday boy and his guests! Although I substituted the evaporated milk for sweetened condensed milk because I had read the issues with the texture and know that condensed milk is thicker. Since I used a full cup of sweetened condensed milk I opted to use only half a cup of sugar (i also prefer the molasses flavor of light brown sugar so substituted that for white sugar). I needed no thickening agent and it turned out amazing!!! THANKS FOR THE RECIPE!

I only had a 5oz. can of evaporated milk on hand so I added enough half and half to finish out the cup needed.  I also used brown sugar and added a pinch of salt.  Tasted and looked better than store bought.  The cake did not last long, family inhaled it.  I will make this frosting again.  Excellent!!!!

Super flavor!  I made a box cake mix and topped it with this yummy creation for a fire-company picnic.  The fireman gobbled it up quickly and it was the first dessert to disappear!  One hint - I did use butter and halved the amount.  I also let it cook on the stove a while longer to achieve the gooey effect.

Wouldn't change a thing!  I cooked it for about 15 minutes on low-medium and though it didn't thicken up too much, the consistency was great.  You want it to run over the cake, soaking it a bit rather than just sitting there, not moving.  It is delicious and rich!

I absolutely love this recipe!  However, it did end up a little runny, so all I did was add a little more pecans and coconut to get to the thickness I wanted.

I made this exactly as written and it turned out great. It was not thickening and I read through the reviews here and rather than mess with thickening agents, I upped the heat as others advised. It worked like a charm. I think I will use half brown and half white sugar next time to add some depth to the flavor but my kids were trying to talk me in to letting them have a small bowl of it to eat like pudding. I made 3-8" cakes and put 1 cup of this on each layer and frosted the outside with a thick chocolate cake as some mentioned it not sticking on the sides of cakes well. I didnt dam the edges but had little ooze issues. We havent cut and eaten this cake yet as it is for our 11th anniversary tomorrow night, but it looks amazing, tastes great alone and was a total sucess. Thanks for a great recipe.

When I first seen this recipe and the reviews, I knew I had to try it! And it was the BEST thing I've ever tasted. 

My icing came out perfect! It thicked up after about 35 mins of wisking, to thicken it up I did NOT add anything, I simply put it in the freezer after it cooled so it could get nice and firm. 

And yes, its so good you will eat it from the bowl! lol Thanks so much for the recipe. I LOVED it!

I used the frosting from this recipe for my own version of German chocolate cake. [I used the Sock it To Me cake II, and added 12oz of Ghirardeli 60% cocoa chocolate chips) The frosting is simple and delicious. People came up and hugged me and thanked me for bringing the cake.

I love German Chocolate cake, it is my favorite... This was the first recipe I ever tried and I am so glad I did, it is perfect! I followed the recipe exactly, I just toasted the coconut as suggested by others here and it was really good! The cake was gone within a few minutes of serving it ;)

This frosting came out great and I got many compliments.  You have to make sure you continue stirring on low heat or you will find bits of cooked eggs in your frosting.  I used the one bowl chocolate cake recipe also found on allrecipes.  Thanks for the recipe!

Awesome. 
Didn't add cornstarch-just stirred mixture continuously for about 10 minutes on medium until thickened. Received great reviews!!!
Will definitely make again.

This recipe did not work for me. It was too runny and the eggs cooked up into chunks. I've had better luck in the past with a recipe in which the yolks are added midway during the cooking process.  It was a better outcome. I will keep looking for the right recipe....

very enjoyable and just the right consistency.  The cooking procedure didn't work so well, so I improvised and increased the heat (as other reviewers have suggested).  It turned out just fine.  I only had 2 eggs, so I used them whole.  I also used real butter and 1 tbsp corn starch.  We love coconut, so we increased it to 2 cups.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar to compensate.  The recipe yielded an ideal amount of frosting to frost a 2 layer 8 inch cake.

I made this for a birthday (by request)  I have never liked German Chocolate Cake but this was a huge hit! Followed directions exactly, took slightly over 30 minutes to thicken, but the flavor and texture is amazing.

Fantastic Recipe!  I have used it several times, and it's a hit every single time.  I normally don't add the coconut into the actual icing, though, since some don't care for it.  I just toast it and allow people to add it as they cut a piece.

This frosting was the best part of my cake. I roasted the nuts and coconut first and makes a difference. I cranked the heat up as well as added corn starch and it thickened up perfectly.

Wow this is excellent and simple!  I make cakes for friends/family birthdays and my daughter asked for coconut/pecan/caramel icing and I deduced that she must want a German Chocolate Cake variation (something I have never made before and didn't THINK I liked.)  I bought a storebought cake mix and a national brand of packaged pecan coconut icing and then I thought - I wonder if I can make a better icing at home?  Found this and threw it together this afternoon wow it is very, very tasty.  I also followed the advice to add some cornstarch to the evaporated milk - I added about a tablespoon.  It took a good 10-15 minutes to thicken and I worried it might not thicken but eventually it did.  I can't wait for my daughter to taste this absolutely excellent icing.  BTW, I opened the storebought and did a side by side taste test and it isn't even in the same universe.  Thank you!  I can make with confidence in the future.

my family loved this frosting. i followed the recipe exactly with out adding any corn starch. u just have to turn up the heat a little and stir like mad until it thickens. its worth the elbow grease. i tried adding corn starch to this once before and it did not yield the result i was looking for. it was too heavy with the corn starch. i loved this with out adding anything to it.

I made this icing for a birthday cake this past weekend and everyone loved it. I did however leave out the coconut because my mil wasn't a fan of it and neither am I. It still turned out really good. This will be a keeper for now on!

Great recipe! I used this to frost my German Chocolate cake (German Chocolate Cake III from this site). Since that recipe makes three layers of cake, I increased the servings of this frosting to 18...there was just enough frosting to fill the layers, as well as to frost the top. I garnished the top of the cake with toasted pecan halves, and it looked great. The only problem I had with this recipe is that it tasted really "eggy", something that has never before occurred when I have made similar frostings. On the cake, you couldn't really tell so much, but that is the reason I'm giving this recipe four stars instead of five. Other than that, this is a great recipe. Thanks for sharing!

With an added tablespoon of cornstarch, this recipe was delicious! It made just enough to frost the top and in between layers of a 9 inch round cake. Then, I used chocolate frosting to frost the sides and decorate.

AMAZING!!  This frosting is delicious along with the Dark Chocolate Cake II on this site!  Like others, I too added some cornstarch to a little evaporated milk that was left from the can, and it thickened right up!  This is definitely a keeper recipe!!  It will see many more occasions in the future!!  Thank you!  YUM!

Delicious and rich, just what I wanted!  I used butter (I always use butter in baking), and I added the vanilla after removing it from heat.  I also toasted the pecans and coconut.  Finally, I also added (per other reviews) 1 tbsp of cornstarch which INHO is a MUST.  I stood at the stove for 20 minutes trying to get it thick. I can't imagine not having the cornstarch!

4 stars for the recipe as written. It is much better if you toast the pecans and flaked coconut in the oven at 350 for around 5-8 minutes, making sure to stir the coconut often. Also, I used 1/2c. white sugar and 1/2c. brown sugar. Added 1-1.5Tbsp. cornstarch with the evaporated milk. It took around 20-30 minutes for it to set up. I then refrigerated it around an hour before frosting my "too much chocolate cake" with it. Way more time friendly to use this wonderful frosting to get a german chocolate taste than doing an entire german choc. cake from scratch.

Oh yeah..."yumo" as Rachel would say!  Delicious frosting. I'm one of those cooks who thinks a cake mix is OK, but frosting from a tub...unforgivable!  So I was recently looking for a good frosting recipe for German chocolate cake and I found it in this one.  Thanks Carol B.!  As with some other readers I added 1T. of corn starch to the ev. milk and that worked out very well.  I would recommend that. Also, I let the frosting sit a bit after cooking and before frosting the cake so as to let it thicken up a bit.

All I can say is I agree with everyone else.... this is awesome!  I baked a 3 layer cake, used this to fill and frost top layer, frosted sides and decorated with store bought milk chocolate frosting, pecans and a marischino cherry, and it looks so pretty!  I made a 1 1/2 times recipe and had a little left over, and couldn't quit eating it right off the spoon... so good!  I did use the corn starch as recommended bu others.  Also the recipe says to cook on "low"  I got tired of that business after awhile and turned it up to medium high til it came to a boil, let it boil for about a minute (stirring constanatly) then removed from heat and let it sit for awhile to cool down and thicken a little... absolutely outstanding, and I will never use any other coconut pecan frosting after this (I'm forever ruined, haha)

I give 5 stars for the taste of this frosting but only 4 stars to the proper amounts given for the ingredients. As other readers suggested, you need to add cornstarch to thicken this frosting because it is very thin. I actually had to add 2 Tbsp. of cornstarch and once I did it was perfect.

Great frosting.  Will use again.  Most people that ate it never had homemade and they loved it.  Do bring it to a boil to make it thicken better.

This frosting was very good. I did add couple tablespoons of cornstarch, as others suggested. I also doubled the amount of coconut required. It turned out a perfect consistency, very tasty and not overwhelmingly sweet. Very good.

DELICIOUS! Rave reviews by all! Made 1 and 1/2 recipe for a 3-layer chocolate cake(made Hersheys "Perfectly Chocolate" Chocolate Cake found on this site,as well as on the back of Hershey's unsweetened cocoa can-highly recommend-1 and 1/2recipe for 3 layers!) Like others, added cornstarch to help thicken.  If not thickening, take of stove, add pecans and coconut, and let sit for a few minutes to desired thickness.  Mine was thick enough after sitting for 15 minutes.

I used half the butter it calls for and it tasted great!! Next time I'll try using dark brown sugar and use a little bit more of coconut, though.

Okay, I made a plain "box mix" German Chocolate cake and used this frosting to spruce it up a bit. It was a huge hit!! Will use again! Thanks! BTW, I accidently put a bit too much vanilla, but it apparently helped, and didn't hinder the flavor. I also used the cornstarch as previously noted, and it worked! Thanks!!

Ingredients are fine, but one step was omitted in the instructions.  One should beat the icing with an electric mixer until it is very thick; thick enough to spread onto the sides of the cake.

I tried this recipe last night.  I've been making cakes for 40 years.  Last night was the first German chocolate I've ever made. Wasn't sure how it would turn out.  Gave my husband a piece of cake and watched.....his head nodded as he put another bite into his mouth. His mother makes German Chocolate cakes all the time. This was just as good. Works for me. SKC

Just made this for a friend. Used butter instead of margarine and added 1/3 cup more coconut. I frosted the sides with cream cheese chocolate frosting. Put this recipe in the middle and on top.

Good tasting recipe...but putting warm frosting on my cake split it in half? The cake could of had a cracked somewhere,but it wasn't visible. Will make again, it's my hubby's fav...but next time will not put on warm cake.

I didn't add anything, when I removed from the heat I poured it into a bowl with the coconut and pecans. This made it come together very nice and was not runny!  The only thing was my little one came and got me and I had to pull some of the scrambled, I stopped mixing for a long min

I agree with the reviewer who cranked up the heat to caramelize the sugar - made it just as it's written otherwise - FAN-dang-TASTIC!  I've had tons of compliments on this one and have made it several times.  Yum!

I've tried better.  If you're going to make this one MAKE SURE to toast the pecans.  This gives them MUCH more flavor.  Make sure to watch them - they burn quick.

I make many recipes from this site and tend to alter a bit, this time I followed this recipe exactly, BUT, I did add 1 tablespoon of corn starch. I think it kind of tastes more like vanilla pudding, the consistency is firm but I taste vanilla pudding...hmmmmm

I have made this recipe before changing only the margarine with butter, and loved it. Though, it was a little thin.  The last time that I made this reccipe I substituted salted butter for the margarine. I added the cornstarch to the evaporated milk as suggested by Drianna. And I switched the sugar with dark brown sugar. YUMMO!

Although I'm an experienced baker, this was my first attempt at a German chocolate cake frosting.  It took me two attempts to be successful with this recipe.  The end result was I replaced the white sugar with brown and added 2tsp cornstarch.  also, my research regarding this type of frosting concluded with the realization that every recipe is the same; from the ingredients to the runny result.  Definitely a recipe worth trying and using!

I followed ithe recipe exactly as written and my frosting came out soupy. The consistency is very runny. I even added cornstarch to the mixture as some of the other reviewers mentioned however it made no difference. 
I would not recommend this one!

My Father-in-Law always requests German Chocolate Cake for his birthday dinner.  This is the first time I've made it for him and it got rave reviews from the entire family.  I used another member's suggestions and used frozen flake coconut.  It is pretty wet, so I tosted it in a dry pan while the rest of the ingredients were heating in the pan.  Easy and delicious!

I did not care for this.  the frosting would not thicken! eventually i got tired of waiting for it to thicken and I just poured it on the cake while it was still in the pan like the recipe says to do at the end. The liquid part just soaked through the cake and settled under it and all the coconut stayed on top.

This recipe really doesn't make enough frosting for a sheet cake, but it is authentic and very good.  You have to cook this about 30 minutes to get it properly thickened - it should be at a full rolling boil while stirring for about five minutes and it will thicken up just fine.  The whole idea is for the frosting to be candy-like, and it does reduce to about half the amount you start with.  I don't recommend using cornstarch as this is not going to produce a properly cooked, authentic German frosting.

This was fairly good. Make sure you chop up the pecans good enough. Otherwise it will be hard to spread. Overall the look was spot on, but the taste seemed a little lacking in something. Haven't figured out yet what, but I think I'll keep looking for a better version.

Compared to store bought this version has a milkier taste and not what I was looking for, but it sufficed. I thougth it curious the recipie didn't call for toasted pecans. I think the frosting is to thin.

Only four stars because, following recipe did not result in the ideal consistency.  Even adding cornstarch did not thicken it as much as I wanted.  I used 1/2 brown sugar and 1/2 white sugar.

Great recipe! Thanks for sharing. I just used butter b/c that's what was on hand. I also added more coconut and it helped thicken the frosting. Made it for fathers day and he loved it. :)

this is great! I made a double batch and had to cook it for a long time!  I agree with another reviewer, after its somewhat cooked on low, turn up the heat, keep stirring!  Don't step away for too long. I had it up to med heat . . you just have to be carful as I did burn myself with the splatter of the boiling liquid, at that time I turned it down! Point being, you don't need to add cornstarch unless you don't have the patients it takes!

This does NOT need cornstarch. Just turn up the heat a bit. I brought it up to 212 degrees measured by the candy thermometer and kept it there for about two minutes CONSTANTLY stirring. I did 1 1/2 times this recipe and iced a three layer cake beautifully. I did toast the coconut in a dry pan for a few minutes before I started everything else. It looks and tastes amazing!

I added cornstarch as recommended in previous reviews to make it less runny and to stay on the cake.   Very good tasting.   Thank you for a great recipe

This is sooooo good.  No cornstarch needed.  I grabbed a chair to sit in, a book in one hand and a spoon in the other.  Stir, stir, stir, it will thicken and it's worth the time.

I made German chocolate cake for a work party and everyone loved it.  I used a box mix for the cake, but wanted the frosting to taste authentic.  I am so glad that I used this recipe.  I followed all the ingredients exactly, but cooked it on medium-high heat instead of the recommended low heat.  It took about 10 minutes of stirring, but reached the perfect consistency without having to add any cornstarch.  My only regret was that I did not make the actual cake from scratch.  Definitely use this frosting recipe and be sure to toast the nuts and coconut!!

BEST FROSTING EVER!  Followed the recipe exactly, except for omitting the nuts (daughter is allergic, so we just added more coconut).  Be patient and it will thicken without adding cornstarch.  It also thickens as it cools.  I am requesting this frosting every birthday from now on!

Best I've made!  Only changes I made was brown sugar instead of white, butter instead of margarine.  I'd also recommend using unsweetened flaked coconut, as it's plenty sweet already.  YUMMY!

The BEST!  Easy and great!  My stepfather loves german chocolate cake and loved this, as did the whole family.  Um... a sneaky trick is to use shortening in the cake recipe instead of oil, just don't use too much, but wow!  makes it very moist and delicious

This is my first stint at making German Chocolate Frosting, and it came out great!  I did feel like I was stirring forever to get it to thicken, so I turned up the heat a bit and kept stirring, and it finally thickened up to what I felt was the right consistency.

Can I say YUM!  This is the first time I have tasted or made German Chocolate cake- and this will definately be a regular dessert!  I used a half recipe of the extreme chocolate cake recipe, with 3/4 of this recipe on top.  Was definately a hit!  We used the rest of this icing for brunch the next day on pancakes with strawberries - just as good!  Thanks SO much!

Sublime!  Wisk the yolks in well to incorporate.  I was skeptical about the cornstarh but it was right on.  Cooked on med/low 4 for about 10 minutes nonstick pot stirring constantly just to subtle boil.  It still looked a little loose.  Threw in the toasted coconut and nuts and let sit for couple minutes and Viola!  Oh My Mercy my wooden spoon is yummy! Oh yea slather all over some brownies.  Great recipe>.

No problems getting this to thicken up as written, no need for corn starch.  Just keep cooking and stirring.  I would recommend using a box cake mix - this frosting is so good it steals the show.  It would be a shame to overshadow a fancy, from-scratch cake.

This topping is excellent and easy to make. Adding cornstarch is NOT at all necessary! Like someone else said, turn up the heat and stir constantly until this thickens. From the start, I cook mine on medium heat. Yes, it still takes a while to thicken, but BE PATIENT... it does thicken! I also toast both the coconut and nuts (I've used everything from pecans, to walnuts, to filberts).

LOVED THIS (and I have never liked german chocolate cake)!  Made this for a friend's birthday.  I substituted brown sugar for the white sugar to give it a browner color and did add some corn starch.

This is the best German Chocolate Frosting I have ever had. My son's favorite cake is German Chocolate I made this frosting- he ate 4 cakes in 2 weeks. I use real butter unsalted and 1 tablespoon cornstarch. Turns out wonderful every time. THANK YOU THANK YOU !!!

OMG! This frosting was DELISH!! I made a german chocolate cake for my girlfriend's surprise b-day party, and it was such a hit! People came up for seconds, thirds even. I tubed a bit of chocolate frosting on top to liven the aesthetics a bit and I wish I could've taken a pic and posted it up. Definitely a keeper!

My arm was about to fall off but finally thickened up. Tastes excellent, and I used half splenda instead of the sugar and did good with that. Probably stirred about 20 minutes before thickened, that's with cornstarch and with me bumping up the heat too. At one point it got clumpy (thought it might help to let it boil) but it smoothed right out, so very forgiving recipe. Thanks for sharing :)

I heated it all up in the microwave in a glass bowl (like double boiler bowl) and added 2 tablespoons corn starch. I heated it up for 3 minutes at a time and mixed it up and heated it up more until it became thick. I then put it in the freezer for about 7 minutes so that it would be even thicker to spread on the cake.

Made this and made the following revisions.  Add the vanilla AFTER you hae finished cooking since that flavor tends to evaporate if added when cooking.  Lightly toast the coconut before adding to the mixture.  For those new to making this type of frosting, directions would be more precise if a temp was given (cook until mixture reaches xxx degress).  Cooking until thick is not very precies.

I just finished making this recipe.I did use unsalted butter(i do not use margarine or salted butter ever)I doubled the recipe as i am making two cake's tomorrow.Other than that i fallowed the recipe to a "T".Very easy.But,would not get thick (just a matter of personnal taste not the recipe)as i would have like.So,at that piont i threw in 2 Tbls cornstarch(keep in mind i made a double batch)It worked out great!!After i added the pecan's & coconut i really think it could use more coconut.So, i threw more in and it is just perfect for our taste.Thank you i will make this my stanard coconut pecan icing/filling recipe :))

Thanks for mentioning that you use only 1 Cup and not 1 Can of evaporated milk.  I was looking for something like my grandma used to make and this is very close.  Thanks for sharing!

This was incredibly easy to make. Had last minute guests and whipped it up as the coffee was brewing.  Added 1 tablespoon of cornstarch along with all the ingredients and whisked it all while on the stove.  I spooned the frosting onto individual slices of cake. I'm wondering if I can omit one or two of the yolks. Thanks for a the great recipe!

Made this exactly as written while the Black Maginc Cake from this site baked and it worked beatifully. I double the recipe since it was a 12oz can evaporated milk, and used leftover for brownie frosting. This is a great recipe.

my first attempt at german chocolate cake frosting and it was delicious.  as others stated, i added cornstarch to help thicken.  it took considerably longer to thicken than i would have though.  in fact, i thought i had burned it.  but it was perfect!

This is such a delicious cake topping!  I made a "Too much chocolate cake" from this site (but instead of a bundt pan I baked it in a greased and floured 13x9).  As soon as the cake came out of the oven, I poured this topping on.  It is delicious and just the right amount of sweetness.  The only thing I changed was added a Tbs. of flour (I didn't have cornstarch).

This was great!  As usual for me, I found myself trying to use up pantry ingredients and had to make two adjustments.  I only had sweetened condensed milk, so I omitted the sugar. Also, I used a stick of butter instead of prescribed margarine.  It came out delicious!

I love this recipes, my husband is a huge pecan fan so he thought it was the best cake ever. I followed the recipe exactly w/ the exception of toasting the pecans, I think that toast them enhances the flavor of the nut.

I usually make the cake and frosting from scratch using an elaborate recipe.  But I had to make it on a week night so I cheated and used boxed german choc. cake and this as filling.  It was delicious and easy to make.  I will use it again even if I make the cake from scratch.

Once again, just another great review. This stuff is AMAZING! Takes a little time, but well worth it. I brought it almost to a boil and it thickened with the 1 TBS cornstarch. I made this cake for my husbands birthday tonight, I'm excited for him to try it! Thanks for the great recipe!!!

Such a simple, wonderful combination. I was lucky enough to have fresh pecans so I doubled the nuts, and cut the sugar a bit. This was fantastic on top of Clara's White Chocolate German Cake from this site.

Happy Birthday to my hubby! German chocolate cake is his favorite so German chocolate it was :) I personally am not a fan of this cake/frosting but according to him this is 5 stars! He says its better than the store bought frosting. I took a lil taste and had to agree. The only thing i did differently was reduce the sugar to 3/4 cups, which still seems like alot. Condensed milk with all that sugar and butter...geeeeez! I think my arteries were clogging as i was making this! I, like others, decided to add 1 TBS cornstarch with 1 TBS water to thicken it up a bit. It thickened up perfectly!

I don't bake much, but dad is coming over tomorrow for father's day and german chocolate is his fave- made a boxed dark chocolate cake mix, two 8" rounds, then layered and topped with this fabulous frosting!  I doubled the batch, roasted my coconut and peacans, used half white, and half brown sugar.  So very good.  Thanks for sharing this.  Takes a boxed cake mix through the roof!

I don't care for margarine, so I used butter. I had no problem with the thickening.  Keep in mind that it will be more like a thin gravy, but will thicken upon standing.  Also, adding the coconut and pecans will made it thicker as well.
Following a few other suggestions, I doubled the recipe and toasted 1/2 of the coconut.  I wanted to do the sides as well as the top and middle, so I put the remainder of the frosting in the refrigerator until it cooled enough to hold it's shape.  When it was ready to handle, I just pressed the frosting on to the sides with my hands.  Worked just great!
This is definitely a keeper!

This frosting was surprisingly yummy - even my young daughter liked it!  It was easy to make and tasted wonderful! I followed other reviewers' advice and added 1 T. cornstarch to the milk...it thickened up nicely.  Also, I added about 1/2 c. more coconut than the recipe called for...personal preference.  Very tasty...thanks!

This is an awesome frosting!
Here is how I adjusted this recipe...
1. I added 3 tbsp of high quality cocoa powder to make it a chocolate/coconut frosting.
2. I did not add the pecans.
3. I added about 4 tbsp of flour since I did not have corn starch.
WOW everyone loved it!

This frosting is amazingly easy and it tastes so good!  I did not add cornstarch and the frosting thickened up nicely after it cooled about 5 minutes.My only suggestion is to make a bit more maybe just a 1/4 more.  I used the frosting for a 2 layer, layer cake and used every bit with just a few sparse areas on the sides.  This is a wonderful frosting and we will NEVER go back to store bought again!

I didn't like this at all. It tasted too milky and lacked that rich flavor you normally get with German chocolate frosting. I took the advice of previous reviewers and added the cornstarch which just made the texture unappealing. I think I will skip the thickening agent and try using brown sugar next time and perhaps try cooking it longer.

Definitely better than any store bought frosting!  Although, I must admit, I did spread it over a boxed "Dark Chocolate" cake I made - Delicious!!  I also added the 1 Tblspn of cornstarch to the evaporated milk, to thicken things up.

I traded out Splenda for sugar.  Frosting still turns out pretty good.  Easiest to spread when cold, otherwise too runny.  Not sure if it's the Splenda, or if it happens with sugar too.  Still love it though!  Used several times!

Easy and awesome tasting. Added cornstarch per other reviews and it turned out great. I could have eaten the whole batch without putting it on the cake!

Ok, so I only made 1/3 of this recipe, as I wanted to use it to make sandwiches out of the "ultimate double chocolate cookies" (also from this site) that I made yesterday.  I didn't have evap. milk, so I used sweetened condensed, no sugar and a splash of milk.  I also halved the butter as suggested by someone else and cooked over med low for about 10 min.  Despite the fact that I really didn't do anything according to the recipe, it still came out awesome and makes my cookies even that much more decadent!  Can't wait to try it on a cake!

Wow, this was pretty darn close! I took the advice of one reviewer and boiled it for a few minutes after simmering, which helped in thickening it up. I also didn't use nuts, because they are very expensive where I live, Taiwan. OH I gave it to a German friend who had never heard of German Chocolate Cake!!

I used walnuts instead of pecans, and brought it to a boil to make sure the sugars would get thick. Turned out great!

This is my go to for German chocolate.  I always make it with butter.  Butter is always taste better than margarine!  Delicious frosting and easy as long as you keep stirring while it is cooking you can't go wrong. Chop your nuts and have coconut ready before you start cooking.

So, unfortunately, this is the greatest frosting I've ever made. I'll never be skinny now.  Tips: YOU DO NOT NEED CORNSTARCH. You probably do need to crank the stove up to medium (at least) to get the mixture your boil, though.  I had to let mine boil for 15 minutes, stirring constantly, but was richly rewarded. The texture and color are perfect. i highly recommend also roasting the nuts and coconut for next level flavor.

I made it the first time using only 2 egg yolks and unsalted butter. It thickened nicely and was the best frosting I've ever made! The second time I only had salted butter and I had a hard time getting it thick enough and it didn't taste quite as good but was still delicious. Thank you for this recipe!

Used butter in place of margarine. Followed another reviewers instructions regarding cooking method - stirring continuously cooked on low for 6-7 minutes, then medium for 6-7 minutes, followed by medium-high for another 6-7 minutes. After frosting reached 200 degrees cooked an additional 2 minutes. The frosting continued to thicken while cooling. Turned out very thick without adding cornstarch.  Filled and topped a 6-inch two layer cake and 14 cupcakes.

Followed the directions, used the amount and type of ingredients written in the recipe and this turns out fabulous every time.  It is never runny or too thick, it's just right.  The last two times I made it, I didn't have any margarine so I used real butter - wow! even better.  Those of you who aren't getting  5 star results with the recipe "as is" must have inaccurrate measuring cups or something.

In my opinion, something may have been altered on this recipe by accident when entered. Instead of Evaporated Milk, I used Sweet & Condensed Milk. It thickened beautifully and gave the frosting a natural carmel-y flavor. No need for extra thickening.

I cut down on the sugar- if you’re making a CAKE: keep the sugar! I also didn’t have 9x9’s so I used two larger pans that were springform. And I took out two egg yolks from the batter and added half of an avocado :) haha, yep- I changed the recipe, and guess what- it’s so good that even I can’t mess it up! Takes forever, but it’s unique and the taste is too! It was a nice Birthday treat fo my Dad whose Mom used to spoil him with this kind of cake!

I made this for my dad’s birthday and it was delicious. The only change I made was substituting butter for the margarine. I didn’t need to add anything to thicken it, I just turned up the heat a bit and kept stirring.

This recipe does not need cornstarch! It just needs more detailed cooking instructions! Cook it to 220 F, and let it cool, and it's plenty thick plus delicious.
Like many, I didn't want to be there all day so I didn't do it all over low heat. Use low heat until the butter's melted, then turn it up to medium high and boil and stir it until you get to 220. Add the vanilla at that point (why boil it?) and the toasted pecans and coconut, and let it cool.

Loved this recipe! Way way way better than premade frosting!!! Used it on a boxed German Chocolate Cake mix w/ a Pinterest hack :) To make a bakery quality cake out of a box mix, follow these steps... 1) Add 2 extra eggs (really adds richness!) 2) Use melted butter instead of the recommended oil & double it... 3) Use milk instead of water... 4) Add 2 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract... 5) Preheat oven to 350F, then reduce to 325F when you put the cake in :D Better for you? Um, no... But so good! Made an awesome crowd-pleasing birthday cake :)

This is the first New York style cheesecake I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  My friends were very impressed and so was I.

It was goals but really funny. It didn't thicken like it said it would and when I frosted the cake, it ran down the sides. It needs to be adjusted.

The other reviewers were right when they say not to add cornstarch. This frosting has to be cooked & stirred for quite some time, but it WILL thicken up! (especially after it has cooled) I made it exactly as written, but I did toast the coconut & pecans, as suggested. I think next time I will try it with brown sugar & add a little extra. I like mine just a tad sweeter (the reason for only 4 stars). Other than that, this is a great recipe for German chocolate frosting! I used my favorite chocolate cake recipe, for the cake off of this site: "extreme chocolate cake"... perfect, with this frosting!

I love this recipe!  After making it the first time, I decided to toast my coconut and pecan in the oven before adding to the mixture to give a richer flavor.  I also used unsweetened coconut so it was not overly sweet.

I failed to read the reviews before starting and didn't have any cornstarch. I had already stirred till my arm ached (about 30 min) and it was still runny.  Desperate,  I put a heaping tablespoon of Fluff and turned the heat to medium.  Stirring constantly till it had a rolling bubble going. Quickly remove from heat, stir in coconut and nuts and success.  Possibly a tad sweet but it thickened beautifully.  Sometimes panic works.

Rave reviews. Multiplies amazing. Recipe x 20 for work. This is a standard in the camp dessert cabinet. I tend to boil it a little longer  to reduce it further so it is not runny as desserts have to be wrapped. Reduced further, the icing does not stick to the wrap.

No cornstarch is needed to thicken if you just turn up the heat to medium and stay with the frosting , stirring it in a thick pot. This is delicious and beautiful frosting--I'll never bother with store-bought canned Coconut Pecan frosting for my German Chocolate cakes again. I used butter instead of margarine.

I love the flavor of this!  My only problem is that I often don't know exactly when to take it off the heat.  Sometimes I get a very liquid frosting, at least once I got more of a hard candy frosting.  I use it to frost the Cavity Maker cake from this site (no chocolate chips) for an amazing treat that the hubs ADORES. :)

Warning: this recipe is perfect BUT you must be prepared to stir the mixture on the stovetop for about 20 minutes (give or take a few minutes).  Do not add a thickening agent; if you stir and allow the frosting to congeal on its own over the stove, the result is superior.  It feels like it will never thicken up and I've worried it would not. It has never failed. I've tried the thickening agents and it's best to skip and be patient.  This recipe surpasses most comparables found in bakeries and restaurants. I've made a homemade German chocolate cake to go with this, but in a pinch, this frosting really dresses up a chocolate box cake.

Delicious recipe. I followed the suggestion to turn the heat on high once all the ingredients warmed up, and then just stirred vigorously. It thickened up nicely and was delicious.

Firstly, let me say that I know just enough about baking to be dangerous but am going to offer some advice regardless!  I think the reason why everyone has been adding cornstarch is because it's hard to tell what 'thick' means here, and of course  you can't stop stirring until it is, well, 'thick'!  So,  made this for the first time today, cooked it at a very low heat, and like you all, am sure, stirred and stirred wondering at which point it had reached optimum 'thick'.   Kept looking at it wondering if at any point it would stick to the side of a cake and thought, 'Nah...', so kept going.  Turns out that 'thick' in this case is when the mixture has reached a very slow, very thick, big-bubbled 'blurp'.  Once you get to 'blurp', you're done.  Added the pecans and coconut and it stuck like glue!  Also - and am sure it made almost no difference except a little deeper flavour, used half white and half packed light brown sugar.   Anyway, greatest injustice that this cake is going out the door as a gift.  Will have to make myself one!  Thank you, Carol B!  (O:

After making this recipe according to the directions, I realized it was way runnier than it should be. So, I decided to look at some of the reviews. I was way past the cornstarch stage, so turning up the heat was the only other option. I had already had my doubts about it thickening on low heat anyway.  After about 5-6 minutes of cooking on low heat, I turned the heat up to slightly higher than medium, like in between 6 and 7. As another reviewer suggested, I cooked at this temp for another 6-7 minutes until it was thick and popping instead of rolling. Went a couple more minutes after that and it turned out perfectly. Absolutely no need for cornstarch. It covered the top and sides of my two layer cake beautifully. Good recipe, just bad cooking directions.

I just made this with the following tweaks:
-toasted coconut and pecans first, then added a big pinch of salt
-brought thr cooked part up at a simmer and stirred until thickened, about 7 minutes

It's thick, but spreadable, and tastes well balanced.

Used this recipe to frost "Black Magic Cake" from this site, and it made an absolutely delicious cake, that got rave reviews from everyone at work.  I doubled the recipe to frost a layer cake, and had enough for thick layers of frosting on each layer, as well as around the outside.  Not overly sweet, but very nutty and rich, which was a wonderful combination with the dark chocolate cake.  I didn't add the cornstarch, just made sure I boiled it long enough to properly thicken.  I waited until the sauce was boiled and thickened before adding the nuts, coconut and vanilla.  Will make again and again....YUMMY!!

Standard recipe for German Chocolate Frosting that worked like a charm. I increased to 16 servings to use the entire can of evaporated milk AND because I'd rather end up with too much than have to make another batch! I used it to fill and top a gluten-free chocolate cake (3-8" rounds) and for the filling of my chocolate macarons. I'd recommend a med or med-low temp or this will take forever... you just have to keep whisking and scraping the bottom with a rubber spatula and you'll be fine with a higher temp. Yum!

I toasted the coconut and pecans first. Made a big difference. 
I used this between white cake layers as a filling, and frosted the cake with a fudgy chocolate frosting.

I made this frosting for my daughters birthday . It was FANTASTIC !  I only wish that I would have remembered how long I stirred it because it was a LONG time . But , it was definitely worth it . Today I am making it again . A request made by my younger daughter  (who just wants the frosting ) LOL . But as I looked in my cupboards & I do not have evaporated milk as called for in the recipe ,,so I am going to try to use condensed milk .Keeping my fingers crossed that this works . Thank you sooo much for sharing this awesome recipe with us .

This frosting was awesome! I never knew it was so easy to make coconut pecan frosting...I'll never use store-bought again!  This recipe was perfect as is.  Make sure you cook it until its to the soft ball stage...there is NO need for corn starch!  Great recipe...thanks for sharing!

My husband bet me that this wouldn't taste better than frosting out of a can.  Well, he is convinced now!  I used brown sugar instead of white to give it the caramel flavor but other than that, followed the recipe.  I did use a candy thermometer and cooked to 200 degrees which was perfect.  It will thicken once it cools and cornstarch is definitely not needed.

I've made this frosting twice and it came out perfect both times. I followed one reviewer's (Dana) instructions to cook for 6-7 minutes on medium heat. NO cornstarch is needed. I also toasted the pecans and coconut. This recipe is so good that I could eat it without the cake.

Okay, well, here's the deal.  I had a german chocolate cake and as a quick fix, I bought an already prepared coconut pecan frosting.  The thing was, the tub was only half full, not near enough frosting.  I prepared the above frosting recipe, omitting coconut and using walnuts instead, I used 1 tsp of cornstarch and when the frosting was done on the stove, I MIXED IN the already prepared frosting and combined the two. It came out perfect, especially since I like a little coconut but not too much.  So for me this recipe is a WIN.

I made this as directed without cornstarch and had no issues thickening it, I just turned up the heat and stirred. I did toast the coconut and pecans. I plan on making this again but will only toast the coconut as the pecan flavor was too pronounced and made the frosting taste more like pecan pie. Delicious yes, but I want more coconut flavor. I used a box cake mix and the frosting elevated it.

This turned out perfect!  I toasted the coconut and pecans for a little extra decadence.  Cook it on low for a little while and then turn up the heat to medium and stir like crazy while it it bubbles away.  That's how you thicken it up.  It takes a few minutes and a little arm power but it's well worth it.

The only thing I changed on this recipe was to use butter in place of margarine as I didn't have margarine. It turned out perfect. The secret to making this icing is patience. It took 30 minutes to cook not 15 as recipe says but was well worth it. Remember it will thicken some as it cools. I let it cool slightly before putting it on the cake. I definitely will be making this again.

Excellent! First time trying homemade German Chocolate Cake and this frosting was on point! My husband loves GCC and this frosting was so good! HE said it reminded him of his grandma's German Choc Cake! I'm definitely keeping this one!

Failed to thicken even with addition of 1 tsp of cornstarch after 40 minutes of stirring. Only variation from recipe was butter instead of marjarine. Never got beyond consistency of soup.

As another reviewer said, go ahead and crank up the heat, being sure to stir often to avoid scorching.  Then, be sure to cook as long as it takes to thicken.  Well worth it!!  Yummy - and this isn't usually my cup of tea.

The reviewer Dana was right on.  I did not even have to let mine sit (only to cool slighlty).  Her direction of time and heat are perfect.

Made this for my husband's birthday. It was a great success! Everyone at the party loved it. It was also the very first time I attempted to make home made frosting. The recipe is fantastically simple, hard to mess up. I will say, for anyone who's never made anything like this, it does take a bit for it to thicken up, and once it cools it gets thicker as well. I also used the recommendation to put in 1Tbs of cornstarch.

I made this for my dad this past weekend, putting it on a boxed cake mix. My dad RAVES about his late mother's german chocolate cake, so I didn't expect that this would measure up, but I wanted to give him something better than canned frosting. He LOVED this frosting and said it was as good as any he has ever eaten, including his mom's! 

It did take quite awhile to thicken, but if you have patience it will. I didn't change anything except used real butter instead of margarine.

Great recipe!

I was so afraid for many years to make this frosting because people talked about how hard and time consuming it was.  I decided to go for it and it was the "Bomb".  I only used 3/4 cup of sugar and I doubled the receipe to cover the whole cake--sides included.  It turned out great!  I will definitely make it again and again.

Very, very good. This was my first time to make german chocolate cake frosting and it turned out beautifuly. Some reviewers said to use cornstarch to thicken, there is no need. Just cook the frosting over medium heat until think and bubbly. I toasted the pecans before adding, but that doesn't have to be done. Overall very tasty and I will make again.

Followed the recipe except added a half table spoon of corn starch as suggested and substituted 1/3 or the sugar with brown sugar. Icing set fine and was even better after refrigerated. I didn't love the flavor alone  but it was great on the devils food cupcakes I made. Would probably use more brown sugar and toast the pecans and coconut next time to take out some of the milky flavor but will definably make again.

Used farm fresh eggs (from my brother's chickens) which really made the taste more rich. Better than most of these type icings.

This was fantastic!!!  All of the tips were helpful for this frosting to be a success.  I added cornstarch to my second batch, a definately must of you want to frost the sides.  I found that out the hard way!  LOL!  I made this for a Grandpa's 80th bday and it was so yummy!  The 3 layered cake was gone in no time.  The frosting is really sweet on its own, but I paired this with a dark chocate cake and it was to die for!!!  Definite keeper!

I looked for a good German Chocolate frosting recipe to make my brother's birthday cake last year and used this one. This year he couldn't wait for me to promise him his brithday cake again. My family liked it so much I will be making this for two other members birthdays this year. This is a very easy, foolproof recipe and it tastes devine! Thanks so much for sharing!

This is a good German Chocolate frosting recipe, easy and very good tasting.  Like one of the reviewers I just increased the heat and kept stirring as I knew from past experience as a kid making German Chocolate frosting with my mom that it takes a while to thicken.  I enjoy making things from scratch so thank you Carol B for posting your recipe.

I made a German chocolate upside down cake that ended up being more like German chocolate cake with cheesecake filling and a toasted coconut and pecan topping. The gooey frosting is the best part, so I picked this recipe to make up and repair my cake. It was so good.   Be sure to bring up to temperature in order to make things thicken.

This was very good. Toasted the pecans and lightly toasted the coconut. Also - I swapped out the white sugar and used brown sugar in its place. I did not need to add any cornstarch and it still set up beautifully. Once the ingredients were all melted together, I cranked up the heat to medium high/high. Cooked for probably 12ish minutes (boiled for most of the time), and it was fairly thick. Stirred in the pecans and coconut, and it was the perfect consistency. At first the flavor seemed to be lacking, but as it sat the flavor became wonderful!

Took FOREVER to thicken!!!!  Will definitely do the cornstarch thing others have suggested next time.  (mix 1TB with the condensed milk before adding)  Also, (since I had soooooo much time to kill while stirring!) I toasted the coconut and pecans.  FANTASTIC!

Made this to top a chocolate cake for my Dad's 60th.  Everyone loved it.  My frosting was plenty thick without any cornstarch. I think it would have tasted even better had I toasted the pecans.  :) Delicious, though, as is. I did add butter instead of margarine since that is what I had on hand.

Great! I had trouble with the frosting not thickening up, but serves me right! I should have read the reviews better!!!! Next time I will turn up heat to the max or just add cornstarch like others suggested.  I used this with One Bowl Chocolate Cake III and got many flattering compliments!

Outstanding! i did not add the cornstarch, didn't need to; it thicken just fine.  Though, i highly recommend toasting the pecans and the coconut as others have suggested.  Delish, to say the least.

Tasted very good but it was a little sweet for my taste. Also I found it to be really sticky, I guess that's a given though... All things considered I would use it again with a bit less sugar.

Followed recipe exactly, except for substituting butter for the margarine.  Frosting turned out superb!  This recipe is spot-on for making the traditional German Chocolate Cake frosting.  Keep a can of evaporated milk and some pecans in your cupboard and you can whip this delicious frosting anytime as all the other ingredients are standard pantry and/or fridge items.  Thank you! :)

Wonderful recipe BUT I'm glad I read the other reviews because I had to add 2 tablespoons of corn starch to get it to thicken.  I tried heating/stirring for 15 minutes and it just didn't thicken.  Then I sprinkled (through a sieve) the corn starch in and stirred carefully.... no lumps.  I was surprised at the yellow color, but it really tasted great.  We have a family member with nut alergies, so I added coconut and white chocolate chips to the cooled mixture.  Also since it looked so "yellow" on the finished cake, I shredded some dark milk-chocolate and sprinkled it on top for a great finishing touch.   Taste is a "5" but it needed the cornstarch to thicken.  Great recipe.  I'll make it again.

This is quite good!  I toasted my coconut and pecans, although I think it made the pecans a bit over powering.  If I make this again I will maybe only toast 1/2 of the nuts and see how that works.  Other than that this gets rave reviews.  I did not add cornstarch.  I just turned up the head and continued to stir until it thickened.

Excellent :)  Doubled and added more coconut, and 1 TB vanilla like someone suggested.  Used Real butter.. there are no substitutions! Did add a little cornstarch to thicken.. takes a long time to cook and get a little light brown like it is supposed to be rather than yellow.  Would definitely make again.

Took FOREVER to make, but in the end, it was worth it.  I definitely recommend adding that tablespoon of cornstarch!  I started this frosting before making the cake and by the time I was done making the cake, the frosting was finally done.  Takes a lot of attention, constant stirring, don't take it off the heat too soon.  You want it thick and almost a light tan.  Frosted the German Sweet Chocolate Cake I with it and it was divine!

Great! Rave reviews from the German chocolate aficionados. I toasted the coconut and pecans, used a little bit more of everything, brought it to a boil and even added a few dashes of cornstarch before I removed it from the heat and put the coconut and pecans in. Before the heat/cornstarch trick, the frosting was too thin. But that worked like a charm.

When I was making this, I thought it was going to be too much frosting for a 9x13 cake, but I was wrong, it worked out perfect.  I followed other suggestions to add a little cornstarch, and it was perfect.  I made this recipe for a birthday cake for my father's 80th, and got numerous compliments on it.  Everyone loved it.

I added 1.5 tablespoons of cornstarch likeother suggested.  It was pretty thick but spreadable.  It definately needs to be put on the cake while warm because it sets up fast.  I really liked it, I will add some salt to the frosting next time I make it.  I think it would be good for cupcakes.

Fantastic frosting.  I preferred to use a bit of brown sugar (1/3) cup in the recipe and just cut the white down by the same amount.  Also used the cornstarch per suggestion of others.  Made this frosting with the black magic cake & I swear it's insanely good if you've got a sweet tooth!

This was excellent!  Made some changes--butter, not margarine, tempered the egg yolks as other reviewers suggested, and added the vanilla last with the pecans and coconut.  Cook time was longer than expected but consistency was perfect.

This was the first time I attempted to make German chocolate cake frosting from scratch.  I was so worried it wouldn't come out right, but it was perfect.  I didn't make any changes and everyone loved it.

My husband said this was a great frosting.  It was very simple to do - even though I don't like to separate eggs since I don't know what to do with what's left.  Quiche time, I guess.

I don't like nuts or coconut, but it was quite tasty even to me!

Delicious flavor.  I made exactly as written except for subbing butter for the margarine.  I also let it cool a little before using.

Nice and easy.  I didn't have evaporated milk on hand, just sweetened condensed, so I used that instead and omitted the sugar. I also added slightly more than one tsp. of cornstarch to the mixture.  I recommend waiting until this frosting has cooled SIGNIFICANTLY before spreading it.  You want it to be firm (not runny at all), but not so stiff that it pulls on the cake as you're trying to spread it.

5 STARS. Hands down, one of the best frostings I've EVER had the pleasure of tasting. Thick, sweet, and extremely flavorful! I could just make the frosting to eat by itself it was so tasty. We frosted it on top of German chocolate cake II, and then drizzled caramel over the top, which complemented the frosting very nicely. I won't make any other German cake frosting from now on!

This recipe is quite simply SUPERB. I consider myself to be a german chocolate frosting fanatic and the flavor of this frosting really delivered! I added 1 TB of cornstarch as well. I may not have given it enough time on the heat- I did about 10 minutes and had no problem. It may have thickened on its own with more time. Excellent!!!!!!!!!

This was delicious! i did make a few minor changes though. I LOVE coconut, so i added a sprinkle more then 1 cup, and i used Walnuts  instead of pecans, and instead of using 1 cup of the nuts, i used about 1/2 to 3/4 cup. Also, like other readers suggested, i added 1 Tablespoon of cornstarch to the evaporated milk. I give this recipe 5 stars!!!

I followed previous advice with adding one tablespoon of cornstarch, 1/4 toasted coconut and 1/2 cup toasted pecans. FABULOUS!!  It was still a little runny, but I just spooned it on and let it run down the sides.  I ate some of the remaining frosting right out of the pot because it was soooooo good:)

Great Classic recipe.  I made a few tweeks for my taste.  I took the suggestion from another reviewer and toasted half the pecans and coconut.  Wow! added a great demension to the flavor.  I also did half and half brown and white sugar and used butter instead of the marg.  I didn't add the cornstarch as reccommended by other reviewers and the consistancy was fine.  I cooked about 20 min over med heat (probable a little cooler would have been better, I got a few lumps.)  Enjoy!

Very tasty frosting. Very easy to make and did not end up overly sweet, which was great. It also sets up nicely so that the frosting is thick and not sliding off the cake.

This recipe is so much better than the
store bought.  It came out perfect with
no cornstarch as others have suggested
they added. Don't skimp on the cooking time however.  I did leave out the water
with the egg yolk, only because I forgot
it.

As written it was pretty good.  Next time I make it I might make a few adjustments, such as decrease the amount of sugar.  It was a bit too sweet for me.

This recipe is Awesome!! I didn't have any pecans so I put in twice as much coconut.  About 1/2 cup of the coconut I put in a shallow pan and placed in the broiler and stirred occasionally until all was toasted and then added it into the mixture.  Was absolutely delicisioso!!!

Yum.  This icing is more like a thick glaze, but it's so creamy and good.  It was runny, so I added some cornstarch.  Goes really well with a chocolate cake and strawberries for garnish.

This was very good.  It did take a while to thicken so I probably ended up cooking it on the stove for twice the amount of time than the recipe called for.  I did heat to boiling first and let it simmer to thicken.  I used on cupcakes so I let it cool first so it wouldn't run all over.  My husband loves german chocolate frosting and found this to be extremely delicious.
