It's a wonderful recipe!  I only use 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup sugar and feel that the salt, pepper and spices are optional.  (The mixture that is to be poured over the bread cubes will look curdled.  Not to worry!) It is a great sidedish with ham or turkey and can also be used as a dessert.

Do NOT use all of the butter or sugar called for in this recipe.   I did not read the reviews ahead of time, and after my casserole came out too greasy and way too sweet, I decided to see what others had said.  I would use only 1/2 stick of butter and 1 cup sugar.  I could hardly taste the pineapple, which should have been the best part.

This WAS excellent with ham.  I made it for Christmas dinner and it was good.   The on;y thing I will change is to cut down on the amount of butter next time.  It came out a little greasy but the recipe is definitely a keeper!!  Thank you.

I've tried this recipe with many different loaves of bread.  First, a french loaf, then a loaf of Wonder and lastly Kings Hawaiian.  The recipe using the Kings Hawaiian Bread came out perfect.  The sweetness of the bread complements the recipe perfectly and the bread is also dense enough to absorb the juice from the pineapple and thick enough for cubing.  This recipe has become a staple at our Thanksgiving table year after year.  We omit the salt and pepper, when served with ham there's plenty of salt.

This is the dish my gramma would make for families that were suffering a loss and dealing with funeral issues. Wonderful comfort food. Only diff in recipe is about 3/4c. brown sugar instead of white, 1 stick butter (really should be butter not margarine for ultimate flavor), and no seasonings. We melt butter in bottom of dish, mix everything else, and pour over the butter. Because of it's richness and my lack of self-control, this is a rare treat when it's not for social functions.

Very good side to baked ham.  I doubled the recipe, using half the butter and half the sugar called for and the 12 people at my table all loved it.  I can't imagine using the full amount of sugar and butter -- it would be way too rich.

I reduced my butter and sugar amounts as others have suggested. However, I still found it to be too sweet and soggy. I don't think I will make it again.

Such a great recipe! Whenever I serve it, I get rave reviews - perfect with ham, chicken, turkey, pork.  I usually only put 1 cup of sugar so it's not too sweet.  Very easy and highly recommended

The sugar and butter both seemed excessive so I cut them in half.  This recipe was VERY good. Even guests that didn't think they liked pineapple enjoyed it.  Will make every Thanksgiving.

A staple for years!!   We only use half the butter and sugar and it's still a winner.
