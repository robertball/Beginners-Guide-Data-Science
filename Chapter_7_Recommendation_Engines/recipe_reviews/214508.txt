This was a great recipe, I did change one thing instead of covering with water I added a 12 oz bottle of beer (modelo), and no water.  Served on toasted buns with provolone cheese, avacado slices and shredded cabbage.  Delicious!!!

It was AWESOME!!!  Didn't change a thing except my grocery store did not have abodo sauce so I bought of canned chipotles in abodo sauce.  I spooned the sauce in and threw away the chipotles. We had family over, everyone including my husband loved it!!!  My favorite recipe from this site so far.  served it with corn totillas and slices of avocado and onion.  YUM!

This was a very easy and delicious recipe.  I like food to be spicy, so I am going to add more cajun seasoning and chipotle peppers next time.

I had a pork loin available.  I followed the recipe and used the beer as another reviewer suggested.  I served it on tortillas with salsa and guacamole.  My husband LOVED it and ate 3 helpings.  Thanks Liannasr!

I followed the recipe and substituted yellow pepper than pepperoncini and it sure gave it a big kick. It was fantastic. Will be making again..A bit spicy for the kids but my husband loved it.

This ended up being really soupy for me so I had to doctor it up. I drained some of the liquid and added 1 1/4 cup salsa and 1 1/4 cup brown sugar annnnnnd it was delicious. I'll make it again with the changes.

I didn't have Cajun seasoning, but I came up with my own spice rub that worked just fine. I don't care for pepperoncini, but a little vinegar and red pepper flakes did just as well. Nor did I have adobo sauce, but sraraccha made a good substitute since I don't like things too spicy. I also left out the cilantro. But this still came out wonderful, succulent and juicy. The fat mostly melted away. The connective tissue gelatinized beautifully. I used this for soft tacos and sandwiches. It was great, a recipe I will pass along and keep in my collection.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I have tried several variations - including the Slow Cooker Texas Pulled Pork from this site.  This recipe was by far the tastiest and I credit the adobo and cilantro.  We did both this and the Texas recipe at the same time and I assumed from all the additional ingredients that the Texas recipe would be better - how wrong was I!  We'll use this recipe again, for sure.

This is a very easy recipe.  I made some changes because I don't like my foods too spicy, and the changes really brought out the flavor of the pork.

Instead of pepperoncinis, I used two small cans of chopped green chiles and instead of Adobo sauce and water, I used Goya Mojo Criollo marinade.  I also did 3 cloves of garlic because my family are garlic lovers.

I found this recipe when I was looking for something other than bbq sauce pulled pork for DH's potluck at work.  I have tried the Pepperoncini Beef recipe on this site and thought this would be similar.  I used a boneless pork loin roast (3 pounds) but kept all other ingredients the same.  I was expecting this to have some heat but it really didn't taste like anything but pork.  I don't think the additional water is necessary.  It watered it down too much.  Before DH took it to work I had to ladle off a bunch of the liquid because it was soupy.  I probably will make this again but leave out the water and possibly add more pepperoncini.

I made a few modifications to the recipe, and this is now one of my absolute favorites.  I used the entire 16 ounce jar of pepperoncini peppers, 2 tablespoons of adobo sauce, and 3 chopped chipotle peppers which were in the adobo sauce.  I like things spicy and this does not disappoint!  I cooked it on low for 7 hours and it was cooked perfectly, not too dry or anything.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time!!  It is so easy and delicious!!  We like to shred the meat after cooking and place on a cookie sheet under the broiler to make it more like Carnitas.  It makes a ton so I typically freeze half and use it later for Carnitas Pizza.  MMMMMMMMMMM

I followed this recipes exactly, only using homemade cajun seasoning. I made this into sandwiches (think italian beef sandwiches) topping each sandwich with shredded monterey jack cheese and pairing with a vegetable plate, seasoned french fries and a homemade ranch dipping sauce. The family inhaled it. This made enough for a huge dinner and two leftover sandwiches for my husband's lunch tomorrow.

this was wonderful! I put made tacos out of these but could have just ate the pork by itself! I accidentally poured the whole 11oz. can of adobo sauce in it so it was a little spicy, but i like spicy.  So full of flavor. It is now my new favorite pulled pork recipe!

This recipe received rave reviews from my family.  Maridele (fellow buzz member) suggested this recipe.  I added 2 1/2 of the chilies that were in the adobo sauce to give it a little extra spice.  Since I used the juice from the pepperoncini's I omitted the water, and I will make it that way again.  I served these sandwiches on onion buns along with '3 BC - Best Baked Bean Casserole' from this site.  Thanks LIANNASR for sharing your recipe.  It is a keeper in this house.

I was looking for a recipe that would cook the shoulder and give it a little flavor rather than make it spicy as I wanted to store large quantities of this shoulder for later use with a variety of recipes. This recipe worked out so much better than I thought it would. The pork turned out tender and with a little bit of zippy flavor, it's going to be perfect for storing the pork in the freezer to use at a later date.  I made a few minor changes out of necessity (I didn't realize my pork shoulder was so much bigger than the recipe called for) but the next time I make it I will follow it exactly.  My pork shoulder was 9 lbs (bone-in) so I tripled the adobo sauce, garlic and Cajun seasoning. I only used one onion and I only used 16 oz of pepperoncinis because that's what I bought. I forgot to buy cilantro at the store, so I didn't use any.  The crock-pot was pretty full with the pepperoncini liquid so I only added about a cup of water, knowing that the pork would add liquid to the pot as it cooked. 

I cooked it on low in my crock-pot for about  12 hours.

Seriously amazing recipe!! I honestly didn't change much, just worked with what I had: instead of a cajun rub I used a chile-lime rub, used the whole jar of pepperoncinis instead of the half, and since I couldn't find just plan adobo sauce I used the full can of chilis in adobo sauce (including the chilis). Definitely make sure you get a bone-in shoulder cut; makes a world of difference! My husband doesn't even like pork but can't sotp eating this! So tender and delicious!!

I was looking for a delish pulled pork that didn't use BBQ.  Unfortunately this wasn't it.  I just tasted pork and some heat, not much flavor.  I think I'll continue my search.  I used the pork the next day to make enchiladas and the pork ruined the enchiladas.  Oh well.  Win some and lose some.

I'm currently the hit of the work pot luck.  I substitued beer (Anchor Steam summer ale) for the water as other reviewers suggested.  I used about 5 cloves of garlic instead of 3.  I had to do the chipotle chiles in adobo to get the adobo... i also tossed in three chilies while cooking and then pulled them out at the end.  It had kick, but those who love really spicy still added more.  I seasoned the pork with the cajon spices about 2 hours before i put it in the slow cooker - i rubbed the seasoning into the pork.  Since it was for a pot luck, i put it in at 10 PM and took it out at 6 AM.  I chilled it until about 10 AM then turned the crock pot back on low for an hour, then put it to warm for an hour.  we ate at noon.  It never chilled as much as I'd have liked from a food temp standpoint, but i was able to get it hot enough to avoid being in the danger zone.  Served with a choice of corn & flour tortillas plus salsa verde.
