Used readymade cocktail sauce, added Grey Goose vodka as well as extra horseradish and cayenne for a very spicy, delicious sauce. Company loved it!

Made this last night because my hubby absolutely LOVES shrimp cocktail and I wanted to make a sauce that was a bit out of the ordinary. He really liked this a lot. Didn't have any tomatoes in the house but just the catsup worked fine. Also did not have any celery so I subbed with chopped green bell pepper. Delicious! Thanks so much!

Wow. I made this to go with the popcorn shrimp from this site.  My guest loved both but this sauce made it over the top.  If I could give more stars I would.  Everyone raved about it.  Thank you so much for posting.
