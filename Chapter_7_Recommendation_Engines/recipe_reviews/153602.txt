Delicious!  I was hesitant about the curry, but it blended so well.  This recipe was a bit heavy on the spices, though, so I would cut them down maybe by 1/3 next time I make this recipe.  Also, to lighten the calorie load, I subbed Splenda for the sugar, and it turned out just fine.

I made this last year for Christmas Dinner and it was such a hit that I'm making the same dish for Thanksgiving this year.  I used cinnamon and a very good port.  I was out of curry powder so I made my own.  It's in the oven baking as I'm inputting this remark and it sure does smell yummy!
