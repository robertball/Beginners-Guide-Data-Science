This recipe is excellent.  However, I  don't have a grill so the first time I broiled them on a cookie sheet with tin foil.  They came out great, but I found that the marinated made them slightly runny.  Next time I made them I placed them on a wire rack with a cookie sheet under it and broiled it for the same amount of time - about 5 minutes on both sides.  Came out fantastic!
Update:  I've made these burgers so many times now, they're that good.  To add some extra flavour, chop 2-3 onions and sauté them for at least 20 minutes on low heat with olive oil and butter.    Viola, caramelized onions, which taste AMAZING with these burgers.  One final note for those who didn't like the vinegar taste: a good balsamic is essential.  The cheap stuff (under 5 bucks) is gross and overpowering.  Buy a good bottle (you'll use less) and it tastes much sweeter.

Wow! The cheese really makes this a treat.  I tried grilling this on my Foreman grill for just a few minutes, and it comes out perfect!

Honestly, as a real meat lover, I could replace hamburger forever with grilled portobello!  The taste is beyond belief.  Simplified things a bit, as some men might. Just used a dish of olive oil, added a dash of salt and pepper and brushed it on.  I also did the same to 1/2" thick cuts of onion and grilled them side by side (onions a little longer of course).  When they were both finished, I topped the mushroom with the thick cut onion and topped that with provilone.  What a surpise I am telling you.  Good luck and Thank you!

I love this recipe and can eat this every day.  I serve this on a whole grain bun with some roasted red peppers, a slice of red onion, and red (or green)lettuce.  An excellent sandwich!  I have also broiled the mushrooms in my toaster oven, and the results are just as good as grilling them.

Absolutely delicious!  My husband was surprised at how meaty and satisfying these were.  I used fresh basil as opposed to dried and they turned out great.  I also only marinated them for about 10 minutes since I have had experiences in the past where the mushrooms soak up too much of the vinegar and end up tasting sour.  A great vegetarian alternative!

I scaled this down to serve one (incl marinade - didn't double the vinegar), and it turned out great. Took another reviewer's advice and added fresh basil, which was delish. Swapped feta for provolone. Broiled the mushrooms (along with rings of onion to go on top) in my tiny toaster oven, and it worked out just fine. Used ciabatta bread, which I'll change next time to something less dense. Delicious, reliable marinade for mushrooms. Thanks for the recipe.

Move over, steakburgers!! With these, your most ardent beef lover can be completely satisfied. My husband is all about the beef. He had to agree, these sandwiches give a burger a real run for its money! Grilled, carmelized onions are a nice addition, as is a slice of tomato and/or avocado. We like it topped with Gruyere, and have also used Brie to rave reviews. I have taken lately to adding a couple of spritzes of soy sauce to the marinade to increase the complexity of flavor, as well as to salt perfectly. I've also added a tsp of Dijon mustard, as well as a bit of chopped, fresh rosemary from the garden, both with tasty results. You can vary the marinade how ever you want. Easiest way to marinate (mess-free, too!) is to combine all ingredients in a ziplock. Replacing the balsamic with half the measure of rice wine, 1 Tb chopped, fresh ginger, a little brown sugar and 3 Tb soy sauce makes a nice Asian variation. For those who found the vinegar taste to be overwhelming, it could be that you left it to marinate too long. 10-15 minutes produces the best results. If the timing is right, then I'd suspect the brand of balsamic is the culprit. It's best to buy only genuine Modena balsamic. Granted, it will set you back a few bucks, but the results are incomparable. The flavor is robust, yet incomparably smooth, with none of the acidic sharpness you get with cheaper brands. Make sure you toast your bun, because those portobello caps are juicy. A+ meat alternative meal!

Portobello mushrooms are really crimini mushrooms that were allowed to grow to a larger size for a realtaste of beef peel the top of the mushroom from the outside edge th the center rotating as you go and spoon out the gills with a soup spoon, then marinate in fresh lime juice turning every 20 min. then grill and sit bak ...you'll swear your eating a hamburger...enjoy

Fantastic!!  I found the amount of aioli sauce to be enough for 6 portobello mushrooms.  I served them on wheat buns that I basted with olive oil and grilled until lightly toasted.  I also made "Baked French Fries I" from this site to go with them.  To die for!!  Thanks for the recipe!

These were pretty good. I don't have a grill so I broiled them. We ate them on a toasted French baguette, with a triple cream brie. It was lacking something so we added raw red onion, which did the trick. Next time I'll use goat cheese and add arugula.

My hubby loves making these. The kids think they're great and have enjoyed them also with cheddar, monteray pepper jack, and mozarella cheeses. Once the "burger" is assembled we like to top the mushroom with some marinara sauce and serve on toasted portuguese rolls. Wonderful!

These were really,really good. Great pairing it with grilled onion. I usually don't cook with this type of mushroom, so I didn't remove the gills inside(big mistake). It looked like black ink running off the shroom. So my tip would be, don't forget to scrape the gills off.

This was pretty good. Due to time constraints, I did not marinade this for more than 5 minutes. Next time I might add a dash of red chilie flakes for a kick. I broiled these on low keeping a close eye. I also threw some tomato slices on the pan and slow broiled them. I topped it off with a grilled red bell pepper. Super tasty.

Balsamic Vinegar and Portobello mushrooms are one of those perfect combination. Sometimes I cut the mushrooms into large chunks layer them in a hoagie bun top with the cheese and make them into a cheesesteak type sandwich. Yum!

Fantastic!  My boyfriend was kind of put off at first when he heard we were having mushroom burgers, one bite and he was hooked.  I served mine on a cheese bun, with avocado, sautéed onions.  I also made some garlic mayo with a bit of cumin in it.  I served it with home-fries and we dipped the fries into the mayo as well... yummy!

Incredible! I took one bite standing in the kitchen and couldn't stop eating! I devoured the whole thing right there! I made my own aioli sauce with 2 cloves garlic, juice of 1/2 of 1 lemon, about a tablespoon of EVOO, and one egg yoke and blended it in my magic bullet. The perfect tart/spicy spread!

I ended up pan frying the the caps instead of grilling them so they weren't as "crispy" but the marinade was fantastic. I put the caps on fresh toasted sourdough with cheese. a slathering of fresh made guacamole and a think slice of tomato and i was amazing.

Yummmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!!  Delicious!  I didn't have a way of grilling these, so I just sauteed them until done and they were scrumptious!  A real vegetarian treat.  My husband thought they were great, too.  I will definitely make this one again.  Thanks!

This was great despite the fact that I broke the mushroom trying to remove the stem.  I also cooked it indoors, on top of the stove.  That worked fine. I topped mine with Bleu Cheese and grilled onion as other suggested. I think any cheese would work, go for what you like.

tried this for the first time and it was a hit! hubby couldn't stop raving about it. used goat cheese instead of provolone since we are dairy-free and used a cast iron grill pan on medium low and the portabellas turned out awesome! thanks for posting bob!

This deserves to be made on a regular basis during grilling season - top notch!  I didn't use the entire 1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar and opted to use fresh basil and oregano which I think made a huge difference.  Next time, I'll take the suggestions of others and caramelize some onions to throw on top.  So good!  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This was great, and very easy to prepare.  I didn't have any provolone.  We ate ours on buns with grilled onions and parmesean.  Will try the provolone next time.  I've tried to make portobellos before and they always turned out dry.  These were just as good, if not better than any restaurant mushrooms I've had.

A little too tangy for me but not bad. I will need to tone down the balsamic next time. Did mine in the oven on rack with pan to catch drippings. Mushrooms were done in the right amount of time.

Delicious! This was very easy to make. I cut the mushrooms in half after cooking and served as sliders on ciabatta bread.

This is a great recipe and easily expandable with extra toppings to intensify the flavor. On my George Foreman grill, I grilled: fire-roasted red pepper, small amount of artichoke heart and red onions. With a pastry brush, I lightly coated some Artisan bread and grilled this also). Then grill the Portobello mushrooms. Pat the mushrooms dry after grilling or the bread will become soggy.  Put it all together. Top with a few pieces of green leaf lettuce. A very colorful, tasty, and filling meal.

For lunch almost every day I have portobello mushroom broiled with olive oil, garlic and Herbes de Provence and then wrap it in thin pita bread, with tomatoes slices and a little bit of light mayo.  Out of this world lunch.

This was a great recipe.  I used 1 tablespoon of fresh basil instead of the dry basil.  It was yummy.  Next time I will use fresh oregano.

Very good especially with aioli sauce.  Loved the cheese on top.  Just thought the balsamic vinegar was a little overpowering.

These were okay.  I quite enjoyed the flavor (we love balsamic vinegar and have it on salad pretty much every day), but the vinegar flavor overpowered all the other flavors, including the cheese, the bun, and the actual mushroom flavor.  I think these mushrooms would be better over rice or pasta than on a bun.  Next time I'm going to try simply brushing the mushrooms with oil, seasoning them with salt and pepper, and grilling them.  That way the great mushroom flavor will shine through.

Very tasty! I didn't have any garlic on hand so I used a little garlic salt. Served on a toasted bun with swiss cheese, tomatoes and herbed mayonnaise. Yum. Will make again!

I thought this was pretty amazing.  I used Sharp provolone from the deli.  Whole wheat buns from the bakery, smeared left over marinade on the bottom bun and made a avocado mash (avocado, diced red onion, ez pepper, ez cajun seasoning, lemon juice to taste) for the top bun.  Added tomato, red onion and spring greens mix.  Delicious! I think the guac (or mash as I call it), really adds depth and flavor that others seem to suggest is missing.

Our favorite meal lately.  I follow this recipe to the "T" and it is perfect.  I use my whole wheat bread recipe to make the buns and it makes a great pairing.  Absolutely love it.  We used to go to a fancy restaurant where my DH always ordered the marinated portobellos...  This tastes exactly the same but doesn't cost $30 per plate.

I love this recipe! So much flavor and the mushroom takes in all the marinade. It's so good, all my meat eating family thought a mushroom burger was gross until they tried this, and they were very surprised.

This tasted great but I found the mushrooms to be holding on to the marinade too much and when I ate the burger the marinade dripped everywhere!!!! Maybe it's because of how I baked it, I would have liked baking directions since not everyone has a grill.

These shroom' burgers are so good. The mushrooms are magical .... but not that kind of magical... but almost. My only tip is to toast your buns. These mushrooms are juicy and will wet your buns. So get 'em nice and crispy or the first bite will leave you with a soggy mess. I spread some garlic aoli on these bad boys and they were so bad... they were good... so good...

I think I liked the idea of these "burgers" more than the actual burgers.  They may have been better with some sauteed onions and crispy turkey bacon.  Probably won't make these again.  Sorry!

This was absolutely amazing... better than a regular hamburger.   This was my best meal so far since going vegan.  Even my carnivorous son and hubby were surprised how good it was when I let them have a bite.  My son kept looking at my burger as he ate his regular hamburger.  I highly recommend this recipe... as is!

I cannot believe a portobello mushroom could taste so good!  I've made this recipe about 5 times now.  The only thing I changed was double the marinade.  (I do this with almost every recipe.)  I didn't want my mushrooms to dry out.  I would highly recommend this recipe.  Your friends and guests won't believe this is a mushroom burger!  Also, just in case this is helpful to anyone, I grilled these on my George Foreman. :-)

These are the best burgers I've ever ate. I've both grilled and baked in the oven and they are always delicious and full of flavor. It is important to use a good quality of balsamic vinegar. We use the Olive Garden brand and they come out excellent with a sweet taste. The marinade can be thrown together in minutes. My kids request these burgers all the time. Since my husband and I don't eat red meat, this is a great treat.

Great base recipe!! I followed the reviews and added caramelized onions. But thought I'd add a little more variety to it. 

I didn't use the cheese in my attempt to lay off the dairy. Instead I topped my burger off with the caramelized onions, some leftover roasted butternut squash, crumbled cashews (since cashews are often used to make vegan cheese), spinach, and some mayo/ketchup spread. 

It turned out pretty bomb. The squash added a creamy texture to make up for the cheese and the mild sweetness was a nice balance to the balsamic. The cashews added a nice crunchy texture and made it more filling. 

Ooh. Plus, I used brioche buns. 

Ohhhhhh. Can't beat brioche. ;)

I've made these "burgers" on the grill and in the broiler and the flavor is great either way. Make sure to flip your mushrooms over to let some of the excess marinade drain out, or your burger will be mushy!

My very carnivorous boyfriend said he'd be completely willing to switch from burgers to these mushrooms... he asked for them again two days later!

We make them with blue cheese crumbles (melted into the gills) and caramelized onions on top. Amazing!

The basic idea and ingredients are really good but I made a few modifications.  Based on other reviews and personal preference I scaled way back on the vinegar, in fact I think if you use 1/4 cup olive oil and 2 tablespoons of vinegar it's a much better ratio.  I left out the oregano and used fresh basil...I really didn't want the taste of the mushroom to be overpowered by herbs and vinegar.  I put avo, fresh tomato and carmelized onion on the bun as well...delish.  Would also be good low carb with no bun at all.

This was yummy! I added some roasted bell pepper and a tomato and used swiss cheese. And I also added caramelized onions. Thank you!

De-Lish!!!! Make it your own with your own creative toppings and bun. I topped mine with grilled red peppers and onions that were also marinated in the same as the mushrooms.

WOW...Super yummy, super easy, super healthy (the perfect trifecta!!).  My son's vegetarian girlfriend gobbled it up and declared the best portobello ever!  2 minor changes due to supply issues: 2tsp Italian seasoning vs. separate basil and oregano; thin sliced mozzarella vs. provolone.  Cooked it in a griddle pan on the stove.  No buns but served with a side of garlic bread and "Summer Tomato Salad" from this site. Definitely a keeper.  Much thanks!

I have to disagree with the majority.  Husband went fishing so I thought I would try one for breakfast since I bought a package of three mushrooms.  Good thing I did.  I didn't like it at all, and I'm sure my husband of 36 years of wedded bliss would not have been very happy if I served one of these to him.  I had not read any reviews and followed the recipe exactly.  The vinegar taste did it in for me.  Sorry Bob, not everybody likes the same thing.

Great recipe! We have made these a few times already, and will definately make them again. The balsamic vinegar goes perfectly with the mushrooms. 
This time we lightly toasted the buns and served them with just the cheese. It was perfect.

Well, I liked them.  They were a little bland, but I used the provolone cheese and also grilled some sweet onions and topped with a slice of tomato and I thought it was very good and a really nice change from the usual.  I can only give this a 3 though because my husband absolutely hated it, and he's a real mushroom lover, so go figure.  He said it was "too weird" and he thought the texture was "gross."  It was really fun and easy to make though, and I really liked it, so I wouldn't discourage anyone who REALLY likes mushrooms from trying this.

I did everything it says in the recipe other then grill it since the grill is buried in the snow. I did the suggestion of broiling it on the oven racks for 5 minutes, both sides. Perfect!!! Will be making this all the time!!!

WOWZA!! Absolutely eclipses a ground beef burger.  Didn't have any basil or cheese so didn't use those.  Used high quality olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Broiled in oven on a cookie rack set onto a cookie sheet. 5 minutes each side.  Brushed with marinade when I flipped them. Outstanding!!

I loved this! I made a few changes to the marinade, but I am sure it is fine as written. I used fresh basil instead of dried, added 1/5 of an onion, and the stems of the mushrooms. I placed all the ingredients into the food processor to make the marinade. I then let the mushrooms sit in the marinade for a full hour. I used another reviewer's suggestion and caramelized onions in the pan while the mushrooms marinated, and they were the perfect topping for the sandwich. Subbed goat cheese for provolone and used a cast iron grill pan instead of the outdoor grill.

I followed this recipe exactly and was rewarded with delicious burgers! Only change I made was Swiss cheese instead of provolone. Even my dad, who always wants to know "Where's the meat?", had seconds. I will definitely be making this again, and sharing the recipe.

This recipe gets 5 stars from me!  I made them a couple weeks ago and they were delicious.  I actually didn't have Provolone so I used Colby Jack but I will make sure to use Provolone next time- I love Provolone but I don't keep it on hand.  I thought it was delicious with the Colby Jack but I bet it would be even better with Provolone.  I marinated in a ziplock bag.  Try this with some grilled asparagas- there is a simple recipe also on allrecipes that I used- it's basically just olive oil and salt and pepper to taste.  Delicious!

Loved it, and I'm not even a fan of mushrooms.  Just made a single one for myself, didn't have any rolls so I toasted a whole wheat english muffin to use in place of a bun.  Broiled it on high in the oven each side for approx 5 minutes adding cheese at the very end, followed everything else the same.  Yummy!  Does that count as eating a vegetable?

This was so good!  Even my beef loving husband liked them.  I topped the burger with carmelized onions, thin sliced tomatoes, lettuce which I mixed with the rest of the marinade and used mozzarella cheese, which is all I had on hand.  I used thin deli sliced rolls.  Excellent!!  I even think my kids will like these.

This was one of the best Portobello burgers that I've ever had.  I followed another reviewer's suggestion of adding a grilled red onion and roasted red pepper (jar is fine) and used smoked provolone vegan cheese instead of regular.  I also ended up marinating the mushroom caps for a half hour as opposed to 15 minutes, it added a lot of juicy flavor.  Will definitely make this again and again.

I only used a dash of balsamic. I also added a splash of soy and sriracha hot chili sauce. As I grilled my mushroom on top of the stove in a skillet, I also grilled some mung bean sprouts covering them w/remaining marinade. Topped my sandwich w/bacon-cheddar sliced cheese, caramelized onions horseradish, mayo and ketchup. I was not disappointed.

This was great! I accidentally put the mushroom caps with the smooth side down which made things a little more tricky, but it may have helped keep the flavor in. I wasn't sure my kids would like this, but they both did!

I did these under the broiler. I do not have a drip pan or a wire rack, so I just put some foil over a baking pan and punched a few holes in it here & there with a toothpick. Came out delicious! I also used swiss instead of provolone cheese and added lettuce, tomato, red onion & mayo to the burgers.

Being the world's staunchest supporter of burgers for carnivores, I really didn't think these would go over well.  HA.  The joke was on me. I could easily opt for one of these over meat burgers, anytime.  Darned good burger, period! Thank you!!

Really amazing. Even my carnivore boyfriend loved it. We technically doubled the marinade since we only used 2 portobello caps. I served it on foccacia bread with roasted red peppers, herbed goat cheese, and a mixture of mayo, lemon juice, fresh garlic, and paprika. We grilled the mushrooms on a charcoal grill which I think gives it a great flavor.

This mushroom burger is the best that I have ever had! Followed the recipe almost to a T. Except I used white balsamic vinegar instead of regular balsamic (This was more for presentation). Thank you for a great veggie recipe!

Made exactly as the recipe stated... I was STUNNED by how amazing these were!!!! Used Orowheat Sandwich Pita Thins with lettuce, tomato & cheese with vegan mayo.  Unbelievable. I'm already planning to make them again tomorrow; even my carnivore hubby wants to try them after seeing my reaction to them. Sooooo fricking good it hurts!                                       NEXT DAY: Ok so I made these again, thinking yesterday might have been a fluke or something and my hubby wanted to try them.  This time I marinated the shrooms in the mixture for a couple of hours before grilling and they were just perfect. 8 mins each side over a medium - high heat was spot on, and my carnivorous husband proclaimed them to be JUST LIKE MEAT! High praise indeed. I served them with a salad and the Grilled Broccoli also from this site. Hubby was so satisfied afterwords he didn't even register that he had eaten a 100% vegetarian meal for dinner. YUM YUM YUM!

The mushrooms turned out very tasty.  I served them on ciabatta buns with roasted red peppers and chipotle mayonnaise.  Definitely worth making.  Nice subtle mushroom flavor amid the spicyness of the peppers.  The only issue I really had with the recipe was that I used a shallow tupperware that was just the size of two caps and used 1/2 the marinade.  The mixture was too shallow to actually marinate the caps.  I wound up spooning it over the mushrooms several times.  Worth the effort though.

I was a bit skeptical because a great burger should always be made with beef, right?  NOPE!  This recipe was great.  Do add onions basted with same marinade onto the grill.  This paired well with the earthy Austrailan shiraz.  I'll be eating this again!!!!

Oh, yum!!!!!  These were fabulous!  My carnivore husband loved them as well.  Even my two year old chowed it down.  I thought it had the perfect combo of mushroom and balsamic vinegar flavor. I did add a splash of worchestershire sauce to it. I made some sauteed onions and a garlic mayo spread to go along with them and topped it with some organic greens and a slice of tomato.  So yummy.

Mmmmm!  My boyfriend was skeptical at first, but could not stop saying "this is really, really good".  Topped with provolone, spinach leaves, tomato, grilled onions, and light mayo w/minced garlic & a little lemon juice in it.  Loved it, thanks!

Made these for breakfast this morning - they were great!  The smoky provolone cheese is essential.  I also used the George Foreman grill as someone else suggested, and topped with sauted onions.  Very rich and flavorful.

This was simply outrageous! I just made it for lunch and I had to review it right after I finished eating. I love my cheeseburgers and let me tell you after eating these Portobello burgers I may never go back to beef again! They were juicy and delicious with much less fat than a cheesburger!  The combination of Balsamic vinegar and spices were just perfect! Thank you for such a yummy recipe!

Admittedly I was skeptical, very skeptical about a "mushroom burger". This was absolutely excellent. I grilled them on an indoor grill pan. Followed the recipe but used grilled onions and roasted red peppers for toppings. Perfection!!! Will enjoy often. Easy, delish, and guilt free.

This was easy & good.  Could have been more flavorful.  Will follow some reviewers ideas next time and use stronger flavored addons like feta and grilled onions.

This was SO easy and tasty!  I used fresh basil cut in small ribbons instead of the dried.  I also had some garden tomatoes so I cut one in half and rolled it in the marinade and then grilled it cut side down first, then skin side down until the skin started to pull away. This was terrific with the mushrooms.

I used some Paul Newman Balsamic and Olive Oil dressing as the marinade, and it worked great.  I also added a slice of roasted red bell pepper and some slivered fresh basil as condiments - YUM!  You won't miss regular burgers.

Thanks, jab77, good to know I can use my George Foreman grill! I used an outdoor grill last time and it was wonderful!  Caremelizing the onions is a good idea and I'd also advise toasting the buns.

I liked these, and I am a real meat eater! My hubby liked them, too. Followed the directions exactly and topped with caramelized onions, which did really boost the flavor. Only the kids (4 & 6) would not eat them, took one bite and only ate the fries.

This was so YUMMY!  I added carmelized onions along with the cheese on a bun and it was absolutely delicious! My new grill go-to instead of veggie burgers :)

This was really good. I followed the directions. I was out of my thin sandwich bread but had leftover brown rice so I put the portebello on top.  Next time will eat with quinoa. Thanks for a quick and tasty recipe.

This was awesome to say the least. It was my first experience eating/preparing this kind of mushroom.  "This is sooo good" was what my daughter was saying through the whole meal.  I don't have a grill outside but I do have a stove top one.  That's what I used instead. I will definitely be making this on a regular basis. Thanks for a great recipe.  :)

I made this recipe today and it was outstanding. I served with sautéed onions and garlic, bakery French hamburger buns and mayo.  Juicy, great texture and flavor was SO good. I didn't feel like grilling so cooked in stainless steel skillet with a little olive oil, one at a time, and topped with grated mozzarella because that's what I had in fridge. I did add about 1/4 tsp Lawry's seasoned salt to the marinade because I wasn't sure the recipe was flavorful enough. My son and I couldn't believe how great these were and were practically doing high-fives in the kitchen. Try this recipe you will love it!

First time I ever had a portobella burger, my husband ordered for me. He thought it was a burger with mushrooms. I had no idea it was a mushroom. Now I enjoy when ever I can and with this recipe, I can have when ever I want. I used my cast iron pan (medium high) and cook as if outside on grill. My Girlfriend used her frying pan and same results... awesomely delicious! Did do one thing different, no oregano, but used fresh cut rosemary (littly goes long way. I use shredded cheese mixtures and place inside cap when I place on roll. it melt naturally from heat off mushroom.... SOOOO GOOD!!

I wanted to try this, while I'm not a vegetarian, vegan or otherwise opposed to meat. The flavor of this marinade is amazing. It turns out I cannot chew into the center area of the mushroom for personal texture reasons, but the outside bites were fabulous. I tweaked the fabulous marinade, chopping the portabellos down to a dice, soaked them in the marinade, added onions, half a scrambled egg, and kneaded it into ground beef. Then I formed regular burgers, and the compliments from husband were endless. Though I cannot actually eat the mushroom cap like a burger patty, I give this flavor all the other stars.

I served on a whole wheat bun, with Swiss cheese and caramelized onions - DELICIOUS. Next time, however, I will toast the buns - the mushroom juice/marinade dripping off the mushrooms made the bottom of my bun super soggy. Still scrumptious though!

Outrageously delicious recipe. This is such an amazing sandwich. I used smoked provolone, and white balsamic vinegar. Served on a  grilled ciabatta roll with arugula,  sliced red tomato, and a drizzle of the remaining marinade.

Delicious! Even my husband enjoyed them...and requested them again later in the week!  One suggestion: also marinade your veggie toppings like zucchini, red peppers, and onions.  A slice of provolone on top or fresh mozzarella provides the perfect touch!

So good, and I hate oregano.  Made an aioli to put on it and it was delicious.  Don't have a grill so I used my griddler.

Just made these bad boys tonight and they were delicious. I used a citrus and lemon pepper salt as well as regular pepper and omitted the basil. We also put a home-made chipotle mayo, grilled onions and baby spinach leaves with mozzarella cheese; everything done on the BBQ. A simple, savoury and delicious meal - try it.

WOW! I just recently made the jump to being a vegetarian and this mushroom burger made me never want to eat a beef burger again.  I can't wait to fire up the grill and have another one tomorrow.  I changed the recipe a bit however.  Instead of salt, pepper, basil, and oregano I used "Grillmate Steak Marinade" and let them marinade for a few hours.  I also used only 2 tablespoons of balsamic vinegar.

Made the recipe as written and added roasted red peppers, sauteed onions and some mixed greens on ciabatta bread.  This will go into our regular rotation.

Excellent starter recipe.  I love grilled portobellos, but my wife thought it was too vinegary.  So I modified it as follows:

1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce and 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar
1 tablespoon of olive oil (to reduce the fat)
Top with sun-dried tomato for an extra treat (I love this!)

Low-fat swiss works great with the burger too.

Everything else the same.

Thanks again!

Fantasatic!  I broiled them on a rack over a cookie sheet in the oven for about 5 min each side, and also left off the cheese (going vegan) and these were wonderful!

Use coarsely chopped fresh basil instead of dried for marinade. Marinade chopped onions, green peppers, and yellow squash and grill as a side or to top burger. Garnish burger with pesto. Delicious!

Excellent.  I could never replace an occassional real beef burger, but this is something different and just as good.  Try it with roasted red pepper (better when you roast them yourself) and goat cheese instead of provolone.  I make extra assembled sandwiches, and zap them for 30 secs then pop it under the broiler for a quick meal later.  One of my favorites.

Amazing and so simple!  I am always on the lookout for quick recipes to make when I get home late from work-- this definitely fits that bill and I will be making it again with a few revisions to what I did this time. I didn't make it exactly like this recipe because I used what I had on hand.  I didn't make it exactly like this recipe, but close.  It was too cold to grill, so I broiled the mushrooms.  Instead of provolone cheese, I mixed some goat cheese with a few drops of balsamic vinegar (because I am obsessed with balsamic). I made a shortcut aioli and used pre-made mayonnaise, added Dijon mustard, garlic powder, and again, a few drops of balsamic vinegar to it.  All I had were some sesame hamburger buns, so that's what we put the mushrooms on. So amazingly delicious! Next time, I will leave out the balsamic from either the goat cheese or the aioli because it was a tad too strong for my boyfriend (I loved it though and he did too even though it was a bit strong for him). I will also use some hearty renaissance bread instead of the sesame buns. I can't wait to have this again!

Totally disagree with using less vinegar (but that's because I love balmasic).  Fiance's a meathead and was reluctant to try but, based on another reviewer's idea, agreed to start a Meatless Monday tradition simply due to this dish.  I didn't have basil (refuse to use anything but fresh) so I used some thyme.  I know it's completely different but it worked well. We ran out of propane so I baked the caps for 20 minutes on 395, turning once half way and basting at that time.  Took it out 2 min. before done to flip another time (back to gills down) and add the cheese. To keep it from getting soggy, serve on the bun with gills side up so the juices don't drip out.  I didn't make the aioli but rather a wasabi mayo.  Used a maui onion and a leaf of lettuce.  Too bad I didn't read the other reviews first b/c I'm guessing avo would've been killer!

TOTAL KEEPER.  Thanks much!

They're a great alternative to meat.  I made them on the George, because I read another reviwer saying they came out good, and it is true. I left 5 minutes on the George, and it was a little too much, but sitll was very good.  Keep in mind that the cheese will take just a few seconds to melt on an electric grill.  I already made them twice, and this is a keeper.  Thank you so much for a great idea!

Loved this one. Even my husband who is not a fan of Meatless Mondays was singing it's praises. Followed the recipe except with less vinegar and a little more oil. Yummy

Just what I expected...never made portobellos before..but made them and they tasted just like those ive had out at a restaurant. Used fresh basil because I had it on hand and dried italian seasoning.

PERFECT. I wouldn't change anything. I didn't have a grill at the time, though, so I used a George Foreman grill for 7 minutes. TO DIE FOR. And you can feel good about yourself! Nothing bad in this burger.

This was better than a burger!  I brushed my bread with a mix of olive oil, butter, and Tuscan spices and grilled it right along with the mushrooms.  I also used mozzarella cheese instead and it was yummy!  What a great simple, yet satisfying recipe.

These were easy and so delicious!  I didn't even get to let them sit for 15 minutes in the marinade and they were perfect!  I can't wait to make them again and top them with roasted red peppers and cheese.  Yum!

LOVED IT.  I had my first mushroom burger at a restaurant and thought it was one of the best sandwichs I've ever had.  Immediately when I got home, I found this recipe and made it the next day.  It's almost identical to the one I had at the restaurant.

This was a great first experience! The couple changes I made was no oil to keep down fat, made up the spices as I didn't have what the recipe called for, and I used a forman grill as I ran out of propane the other night! I loved the taste and I imagine it's pretty difficult to mess up unless you overcook! I also used goat cheese which was delicious! Next time I'll probably add caramized onions and tomatos! Did find it a little difficult to eat as it seemed to want to "tear" in the direction of the underside "fans"- I found it difficult to bite through. Very filling and cheap to make- I'll be making this again!

It's been a while since I made this, but wow, was it good!  I was skeptical...thought they would be dry, but they were juicy and d'lish.  Looking forward to making these again this summer.

Decided not to put these on a bun... I caramelized onions by cooking 2 onions over low in olive oil for 20 minutes.  I duplicated the mushrooms marinade to make vinaigrette, except I used garlic powder instead of fresh garlic (for dressing only) added a couple tablespoons water and a couple tablespoons sugar.  Made a spinach salad of shredded carrots, cucumber, tomato and spinach.  Drizzled the salad with a little dressing, topped with caramelized onion and the portobello burger.  Oh, and I used Muenster cheese instead of provolone.

So I had everything for burgers except the patty, so came online to find a vegetarian option.  I decided to give these a go, despite only have button mushrooms and not portobello.  I ended up slicing the button mushrooms and quickly sauteing them in marinade.  Then I arranged the sliced into patty shapes, lay over the cheese, and broiled them.  They tasted pretty good - particularly for a vegetarian burger.  Would be interested to actually try them with the portobello caps as the recipe indeeds.

Delicious! I made these for my very skeptical and carniverous father and he LOVED them. I served it on a whole wheat bun with melted munster cheese, dijon mustard, avocado slices, a huge hunk of tomato, and spinach leaves. Soooo delectable!

This recipe is really delicious, but we dipped ours in marinara sauce which completed the flavor. Personally, I think I would always eat this with marinara sauce.

First time I made this and was great!  I used one big mushroom so I halved the marinade.  I cooked on a stove-top grill, but seeing as how so many broiled it (in a toaster oven) I will try that next time.  With the addition of the provolone, I just ate it as-is but it would be great on a 100-calorie sandwich thin with some other veggies.  Will definitely make again for a really nice lunch and/or dinner.  Thanks for the recipe!

As he was grilling these, my husband asked "What did you marinate these in?  It smells amazing!"  I  like to top the mushrooms with some grilled red pepper and onion, and then a little feta cheese.  Awesome.  This is a new favorite!

Fantastic !  I was using pureed garlic from a jar - therefore I used 1 1/2 teaspoons.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly as shown and it was great !  The provolone has a great flavour.  I ate one mushroom cap as a "burger" and then had another small one just plain.  Yummy !

These were spot on!! The marinade turned out perfectly. I did add slightly more olive oil (a tablespoon or two) but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. I served it with a slice of tomato and a leafy lettuce.

I really loved this recipe.  I made the mushroom marinade exactly as described except used fresh basil and oregano instead.  I cooked the mushrooms on the George Foreman grill and it only took about 4 minutes.  While the mushrooms were grilling, I sauteed some onions and roasted red peppers together in a little bit of olive oil. To serve, I toasted some bread and put an avocado spread on it.  Then I put on the mushrooms, sauteed onions and peppers, and topped with some swiss cheese.  It really was great and I'm certain I'll make this quite often!

These were pretty good, but they were a bit soggy and they had a bit too much vinegar flavour. Next time I will only marinade for 5 minutes and use only half the vinegar.

This was just OK. I'm not sure if I made it correctly since the mushrooms were saturated with the taste of balsamic vinegar.   And, they were rather soggy after they came off the BBQ grill, making it nearly impossible to eat them on a bun. If I try this again, I'll use less vinegar and cook the portobellos underneath the broiler.

Wow! These are fantastic. We topped ours with pepperjack cheese, lettuce, and tomato. So good! I've already added mushroom caps to next week's shopping list so we can have these again. Thanks! :)

I have made this recipe twice and found it very tasty indeed, and a great way to use portobellos. It's great with many different cheeses. For large portobello caps, I found that more marinade is needed. I see some have worried that the balsamic vinegar will be too acid and overpowering. One way to avoid this is to buy reasonably good balsamic vinegar. It comes in many incarnations and a lot of the supermarket brands are pretty rough. Some that has been aged for twelve years or more can be very expensive, but there are a number of mellow ones that aren't too expensive. A definite keeper. I will make it often.

Absolutely fantastic. I didn't change a thing for the marinade which is superbly delicious! I cooked according to direction but on the stove, it took approximately 8-10 minutes per side. Then I lightly brushed the inside of my rolls with honey mustard and heated up in the oven, caramelized some red onions, mashed up some avocado and lightly salted it and spread on the prepared rolls. I will make this over and over again.

Just tried this last week, and my husband and I absolutely loved it.  I would much rather enjoy this than a regular hamburger!!!!  It makes healthy eating so much more enjoyable!  I grilled our whole wheat buns on the grill with olive oil brushed on them...so good!!!!

These were quick, easy and tasty.  One change I would make is to close the mushrooms up in a plastic bag for 10-15 minutes (maybe a little less so they don't get soggy) with the marinade touching them as much as possible - they didn't soak up a whole lot based on the volume and setup in the recipe.  I grilled them on my Foreman grill and kept  spooning the marinade over them from time to time.  We also grilled some onion slices to add on top.  Came out very tasty.  I recommend trying Swiss cheese and whole wheat buns.

AMAZING!!!! wow, this was my first time grilling caps as burgers and they were fantastic! Even my mushroom-hating boyfriend begged me for more! Everyone who had one was blown away! I served them on grilled whole wheat buns with arugala, tomato slices and a garlic-herb aioli. i will definitely make them again soon. I will also go ahead and say I like them better than most burgers. Thank you!

I doubled the marinade, and used Italian seasoning instead of separate spices...both recommendations from previous reviewers.      A recipe like this makes me consider giving up meat!

The balsamic vinegar was really nice on the mushrooms. I used fontina cheese instead of provolone and I really liked that combo a lot.

This was my first foray into portobellos. I'd heard they didn't have a strong mushroom taste (I don't care for mushrooms) and that they were a good meat substitute. They really shine in this recipe. I love balsalmic vinegar and was so excited about making this, and it was everything I hoped for. The provolone was nice on top.

YUUUMMMYYYY!!!  This recipe is fantastic!  We made these for our Labor Day weekend bbq, and they turned out soooo delicious!  As other users had suggested, I doubled the marinade.  We definitely needed more marinade than the recipe calls for.  I also used ribbons of fresh basil, instead of dried and added a few sprigs of fresh rosemary.  Try this...you won't regret it!

I made this on the stove (pan-fried) and didn't change a thing.  It was absolutely PERFECT...I won't have to go to a restaurant anymore for great mushroom burgers!!
It was a bit smoky in the house but it was well worth it!
Can't wait to have them again!

Thought I would have a hard time pulling this off for dinner in my house with two men but I was amazed how well they liked it.  Easy to fix on a hectic night.  An inexpensive meal but doesn't taste like it.

Pretty good, but I think I'll continue looking for a better way to marinate the mushrooms before cooking.

I took the ingredients for this recipe on a camping trip with my son, daughter-in-law, hubby, and gradchildren. It was a hit! Now I get requests all the time.

I really liked this recipe, except that it might have been better had I found the mushroom caps in an appropriate size.  The caps I got were so big, that they would've never fit in any burger bun!  I had to slice them up and put them on ciabatta bread.  I was kind of disappointed cuz my 15 month old spit it out, but my fiance did like this and asked me to make it again.

Great and a lot more economical to make then to purchase the ready made ones that can be purchased in some super markets - Schnucks in Peoria have them.

I have never Been able to duplicate restaurant style  Portabella burgers until I tried this recipe.  Peeling the mushrooms  and taking out the fins made all the difference thanks to another cooks tip.

Delicious. Used cheddar because I had no provolone. Toppings were lettuce, tomato, red onion and garlic aioli. Will definitely make again.

I'm not a vegetarian, but these can have a meaty texture if you cook them on the barbeque long enough.  The provolone cheese is a nice touch.

Wow!  What a burger.  First I'll say, I love veggie burgers, restaurant, homemade, store bought, however, I always feel that something is missing.  Enter this fantastic mushroom burger...it's the messiness and dripping!!!!  I have had many portobello burgers before, but this one was the best.  Great texture, taste and  perfect amount of juiciness.  

I used a grill pan and a cover, it worded perfectly.  I used cheddar as the cheese and followed another reviewer and grilled onion slices to go along with it.  My  mushroom caps were very large, so I split it in half for my daughter and myself.  Now we have the other one for tonight!  I will try to find smaller ones next time, though.  

Thank you for this fantastic recipe!  I will make it quite often.

I did this without cheese, and rather than do it standard, I simply prepared it like I was eating a regular hamburger, so I added sliced onion, roma tomato, lettuce, a touch of ketchup, and a bit of salad dressing (not mayonnaise).

This was my 1st time fixing these mushrooms, and found them surprisingly easy. Once that prep was done, everything else toòk no time.

Perhaps my ratios were off, but I just didn't like the marinade. The vinegar was too strong, and even the next day for lunch I was vomiting from the strong taste.

Otherwise, I loved it & plan to make it again.

Wow, I am amazed!  I would eat this over a beef burger any day of the week (and I am not a vegetarian).  Satisfying for sure.  I followed suggestion from another review and added grilled onions, also used Spinach instead of lettuce and no tomatoes.  Can't wait to make again.

I figured I would like this recipe, but I actually LOVED IT!! I made the full marinade recipe for just two portbellos. I ended up using all the marinade. The only other change I made to the recipe was to use swiss cheese instead of provolone as that is all I had on hand. I think any cheese one likes would work for this recipe. I will making this recipe often. So glad I tried it.

Ok, I was too lazy to bring my laptop to the kitchen to read the recipe so I did it from memory.  I forgot the garlic and added a little Worcestershire sauce as per one of the reviewers.  I also used pepper jack cheese on mine and cheddar on my son's and topped with sauteed onions.  I used a crusty french bread roll and placed that on the grill at the very end.  Next time I won't forget the garlic but it was delicious without it too. I will play with different toppings each time so it doesn't get boring.  The fact that my 11 year old who is very picky ate this, says it all.

So delicious! I changed the recipe by wrapping 2 slices of bacon around the mushroom caps and then baking them in my convection oven. The recipe is easy and quick. Definitely making these more often.

Wonderful recipe. This is our second day as vegetarians and this is the recipe that is convincing me that there is a future... Delicious with condiments of strong English mustard and home made mayo.

I gave this recipe 5 stars because it is really delicious, has very few ingredients, is so simple to make and fast from start to finish and finally because it is HEALTHY & VEGAN (leave out the cheese or replace with vegan cheese)!!!
I have in fact gone vegan and Im experimenting with ways to change up  favorite recipes without buying the tofu and soy substitutes like "veggie burgers".  This is a super yummy burger alternative.  It really did taste like a burger except I didn't feel like a big fat hog after dinner!

A couple of things I did to make it my own:
Instead of mixing the marinade, I saved the bowl and utensils and sprinkled both sides with the oil, then red wine vinegar, rosemary, oregano, salt & pepper.  Let it sit while the grill heated then I GRILLED GILL SIDE DOWN FIRST.  This trick lets the juice out of the shroom so when you flip it to finish cooking it, you won't have a soggy shroom. 
I bought onion buns at the grocery deli which we all think really takes this burger to new heights - oh man yummy. 
Also I added a little BBQ sauce instead of ketchup, fresh sweet onions, fresh spinach leaves

I broiled it. It tasted like a mushroom. And the vinegar was overpowering.

This was amazing. I had it with two slices of tomato, some lettuce, and I used a roasted red pepper hummus... it blew my mind how good it tasted. I will be making this again.

I think it would have been yummy if I didn't spoil it with Gruyere but i'm not even sure. It just wasn't great :( I would definitely try again with a different cheese, there was no provolone in the supermarket unfortunately. If anyone can advise on salt amounts I would be grateful because I wasn't really sure.

I made this recipe for a friend who had just lost her mother.  She shared it with her father and sister and gave the recipe the highest praise I've ever received.  My friend said her father, a dedicated carnivore, who never chose a vegetarian meal in his life, not only loved the portobello mushroom burger, he asked if he could keep the leftover burger!  And yes, of course, I shared the recipe and introduced her to allrecipes.com.

FABULOUS - these are great burgers, they don't compete with beef burgers, they are  something special that stands on it's own.  Filling and very delicious, I have made these many times and will continue to. My family loves burgers but never feels we compromised when I serve these instead.  I always use a slight coating of mayo after I toast the bun as it would get mushy otherwise, and add a thin slice of provolone cheese to top to slightly melt and add another layer of smoky taste to this burger before serving.

We loved these! Easy and very satisfying even to my carnivore husband! But, I will say, don't waste these delicious mushrooms on ordinary, store bought, boring buns. They just DO NOT do the 'shrooms justice! Splurge on good crusty rolls or whatever you prefer!

Update: (6-13-12)
Made these again but decreased the balsamic by 1Tbl and added 1Tbl of toasted sesame oil. (Seven year old didn't like the sour last time!) The sesame oil added yummy flavor and toned down the vinegar. Whole family liked these better!

Simple but very flavorful.  I wasn't convinced that I would be satisfied with eating a mushroom disguised as a burger but it was actually really good and I'm a meat eater but I didn't miss the meat what so ever.  Made the recipe as is and loved it!

This is one of the most disappointing recipes that I have ever tried. I have not eaten portabellas that many times, but every other time I ate them I loved them. In fact, I found this so appalling that since eating this I have even begun to not care for them in other recipes. I am not sure what exactly made me dislike this so much, especially since in the past when I enjoyed portabellas they were always grilled in a somewhat similar manner. For the record, since so many people change the entire recipe and then give it a bad review, I made and dressed these exactly as written. Furthermore, my girlfriend, who has had portabella burgers she enjoyed on more than one occasion, found these just as disgusting as I did. If you are going to the store to buy ingredients to try these, I recommend picking up some yoghurt – as that was what I ended up eating for dinner the evening I made these.

Definitely don't soak in marinade, just brush it on while cooking.  Great recipe!

Edit= We have made this probably 100 times now, excellent flavor.  A family favorite.

MMMmmm! These are really good! I took a note from another review about the lack of grill and used the cooling rack. I placed the rack on top of a cookie sheet pan and it came out beautifully. I loved the sweet, savory flavors of this dish and I will definitely find a grill to get the "true" effect next time. :)

Perfect recipe! Next time, I'll peel the skin off the top of the mushroom though. That part was tough. Put it on a toasted kaiser roll with provolone cheese, mixed greens, tomato & fresh onion. I also fried some onions in a small pan and added that to the sandwich. Thanks!

I love this! I did modify it a bit though. I stuck with the marinade, but I put the oven on broil like others recommended. I also caramelized onion with olive oil and garlic, then added some gorgonzola. I found the creamy texture of the gorgonzola really complimented the sandwich.

This was a very nice change from a meat burger.
Easy to make very tasty. Served it to a meat lover & it's was rated 9 out of 10. The Aiola sauce my verdict is still out on that.

Dee-Lish! Even on indoor grill. Used the recommended aioli sauce - Yum! Used multi-grain sandwich "flats" and will try an onion slice next time. Have a treat by using this recipe soon!

Delicious!  Broiled them in the oven on a rack on a cookie sheet as another reviewer suggested. Served on toasted sourdough with garlic aioli and lettuce.  Adding this recipe to my permanent file.

Used my counter top inside grill.  Also subbed garlic powder for fresh ... grilled a few slices of vidallia onion to top.  Awesome I had a burger for lunch so this was perfect for dinner.

NOMNOMNOM! It was delicious and I'll be making it again. My husband insists on meat, so next time I may make this on a burger. To me, the mushroom has enough meatynous to not need to be with meat.

I played around with the recipe and added low sodium balsamic vinaigrette in place of the vinegar and oil separately...it was wonderful! I added five white Italian cheeses to melt on top and didn't need the added sauce...it was fabulous!!!! With a three year old I need healthy meals that are quick to prepare. This was on the money!

I did not expect this burger to be so good. Honestly, I was shocked. I doubled the marinade so the mushrooms were bursting with flavor and added fat free feta instead of provolone, which I did not have. Amazing. I could not tell this wasn't a meat burger and even my boyfriend (a staunch carnivore) was sold. I will definitely make these again!

super yum!!! a new lunch favorite for this newbie vegetarian. I top mine with mozzarella cheese, sliced cucumbers and a slice of tomato... served with more cucumber slices and fresh (raw) green beans on the side (better than chips!). I will be revisiting this one again and again!

Oh-My-Goodness-Deliciousness This burger is out of this world good.  Both my boyfriend and I are meat eaters and with the flavor and taste you don't miss it at all.  I followed the sauce recipe exact and cooked in the broiler for 7-8 minutes.  Also I grilled with olive oil and a bit of the remaining balsamic glaze some red bell peppers and onions and used pepper jack instead of provolone for an extra kick.  So good, a staple for sure.

This was GREAT! When creating this recipe I realized I had no Balsamic Vinegar so I substituted with Sherry Vinegar. It smelled wonderful. Next time I would omit the minced onions and just use onion powder to make it easier. I omitted the provolone because I'm vegan. Used caramelized onions on top of the burger and veganise. Sooo tasty. Thanks!

These were very good! I served them with provolone cheese, grilled red onions, and fresh sliced roma tomatoes. I brushed a kaiser bun with butter and grilled the bun too. The burger did not need any type of mayo/mustard/etc...due to the marinade having so much flavor. I was out of italian seasoning or any type of basil/oregano so I used a rosemary and garlic seasoning I bought at Sams Club.

Awesome!!!  I could eat this regularly (rarity for me).  I added caramelized onions and also marinated some heirloom tomatoes in the mushroom marinade.  I just pan-fried the mushrooms.

These are among the top fav of my family, friends and neighbours. I have been making these for years. Topping of course vary by coniseure but I like carmelized onions as an option, crispy bacon and I prefer to sample different cheeses. A good slice of mellow blue cheese just melts in your mouth. Oh so Awesome!

A delicious change from the norm. We all agreed it was wonderful for a vegetarian- but the only thing that would make it better for us would be a hunk of beef in it!

Made this for my family and very traditional grandparents. My dad is a huge meat man and doesn't like vegetarian dishes nor does my grandpa. These burgers got rave reviews with several requests to have them again. Everyone was skeptical, but they looked and tasted fantastic! I toasted hamburger buns and spread a thin layer of light mayo. I put a leaf of lettuce down first, the burger and then some sauteed onions. Delicious! Never had provolone cheese before and it was great on them. Two thumbs up!

This recipe was just OK. The flavor of the mushrooms was great and I definitely didn't miss the meat but the mushrooms were a bit stringy. Maybe I over cooked them or something.

I added hummus and avocado and they were just too many flavors .... the bread needs to be thick.  Using regular hamburger buns was not a good choice .. very soggy.

These burgers are delicious. I changed a few things. The marinade was perfect so I kept it the same. However, I used gorgonzola cheese crumbles instead of the provolone cheese. Also, I caramelized some onions to top the mushrooms. SO GOOD!!

We served these on whole-grain English muffins with a little canola mayonnaise... Awesome!  My husband is definitely a meat and potatoes man, but we tried these anyway, fully expecting NOT to like them.  We were SO wrong!!!  These will make a regular appearance on our menu.  We paired the "burgers" with a salad and were quite full!  The bonus:  few dishes and a very easy clean-up afterwards.  If I could give these 6 stars, I would!!!

Theses were really good, I will buy a much better aged balsamic than what I have, it's not the best! I didn't marinate as long as stated due to the poor quality of the balsamic I have. I used fresh oregano, and swiss cheese. I used buttermilk ranch as the sauce, very light amount. Ididcarmalize some onions, they were great on this burger. I also made Baked French Fries 1 from this site, they were super yummy!  We were pleasantly surprised at how well the burgers turned out. I will be making these more often, Thanks!!

Oh my God, this burger is so amazing! The marinade gives it a great taste and is very filling too! Just as seuggested I caramelized the onions as well and trust me they taste so good. I ate it with lettuce, tomatoes and on a flat bread. Great recipe!

These are soooo good!!  We don't have a grill, so like others I broiled for a few minutes on each side.  Added some carmelized onions in the cap and covered with provolone cheese....lordy, my husband and I ate these 2 nights in a row, and again the next week.  Sweet potato fries and salad and you have the perfect summer meal.

Fantastic!  Meaty & flavorful - I used my stovetop grilling pan and they came out great.  Good alternative if you're cutting back on red meat consumpton. My husband and daughter love them, I make them once a week.

Excellent recipe!  My husband and I both loved these.  We used low-fat cheddar cheese instead of provolone, and the cheddar went well with the burgers, too.  We made them on our George Foreman grill since we don't have a "real" grill, and they turned out great.

Very Good! 5 stars for unique, healthy main dish. Easy to prepare and good to eat. I had to use sliced portobellos bc that's all my grocery had, so I broiled them 5 min. per side on a wire rack over a stove top grill (big, thick, flat pan). Thought they'd be easy to lose on the grill. Will make again, hopefully with full caps on the grill! The cheese really sets it off-don't skip it! Also sauteed some onions in butter and oil while the mushrooms marinated. Put them on top. Added a very nice sweet touch and nice texture. Since I couldn't put cheese over the sliced mushrooms, I put it on the bun bottom and stuck it in the toaster oven for 2 minutes to melt it and warm the bun. Yum!

Great marinade! I don't have a grill, so I did it in a non-stick pan over medium to medium-high heat for about 4 minutes on each side, then popped them in the oven (which was set to 400 for a side dish I was making) because I like my mushroom burgers really tender. I also sprinkled them with feta cheese instead of provolone for added flavor.

AMAZING!!!  My fiance has never liked mushrooms, said he hated mushrooms, but said he would try this, with a regular hamburger backup... He was very impressed with the flavor, and said he would like to have this for dinner tomorrow night!!!!!!  Very tasty, use an aged balsamic vinegar for better flavor.

These were delicious, fast, and easy! I spread softened goat cheese on whole wheat hamburger buns and topped the cap with a slice of red onion and a slice of tomato. It was very yummy!

Well, the best I could say is, not objectionable.  My poor dining companion declared it "horrible", however, and we went to a fast-food establishment... I thought it was edible, but not something I'd ever eat by choice.  We used cheddar, and some grilled onions, and only dipped the mushroom in the marinade for a minute or two, as per some of the reviews.  I normally love mushrooms; the mushroom was okay, it would've been better without the marinade.

This was wonderful.  The marianade had just the right amount of flavor.  I substitued lowfat feta cheese for the provolone and added sun dried tomatoes.  I cooked  it smooth side up first so that when I flipped it, the mushroom had a perfect cup to contain the cheese and tomatoes.  Delicious!

This was a nice change from the standard beef burger, with no guilt added. It was tasty from the marinade and didn't need any additional "sauce" on top. It was  great just topped with tomato and red onion. Will definitely be making again

Marinade goes well with the "veggie" vibe without taking the fun out of the burger.  I'd double the marinade though as I prepped for 4, only made 2, and didn't have enough for basting.  Of course I poured it into the cap "vents".  your mileage may vary.

Yum!  We thought these were great, although, I must admit that we typically just marinade our portobellos in an italian dressing, and neither of us felt like this was all that different taste-wise.  VERY good though!

These were delicious!  I had to broil them on each side for 5 minutes, and I put them on a wire rack so they wouldn't be soggy (as recommended by other reviewers).  I'll certainly make again.

I'd rate as a 5 but kids and hubby weren't too impressed with this. Served on hamburger buns. I think they didn't quite cook long enough. I used the Greek House Dressing from this site to brush over the caps as they baked. Nice!

This was good, but I found it needed just a bit of doctoring for my tastes. After I put some light mayo on my bread, I sprinkled just a bit of garlic salt, pepper and cayenne (onto the mayo) and it took the sandwich to the next level. I also followed others' advice to carmelize some red onions and add to the sandwich. I'll be making this again.

This was great! I broiled mine on a rack with a cookie sheet underneath. I also threw some caramelized red onions on top. Definitely will make this dish again.

UPDATED:  After 6 years of being my favorite Portobello burger recipe, it's now in second place.  
Do not deviate from this recipe; use the exact ingredients and marninate as directed.  I cooked onions on my George Foreman (medium heat) first and then I cooked the Portobello. It can also be grilled for 3 minutes on each side.

love these burgers!  Made them with goat cheese and on sour dough bread.  Also, I broiled them on both sides for 5 min.  So much healthier than regular burgers!

I really enjoyed this meal! I used a French bread instead of a hamburger bun, and broiled the mushroom caps. The aioli marinade was quite tasty. I also used light provolone slices of cheese and added sauted golden onions for a kick.

These were DELICIOUS and so simple!!  restaurant quality!  i will make them over and over again with this marinade!  I used the fresh herbs that i had on hand from garden.  I also used jalapeno jack cheese in place of the provolone. i followed the advice of others and topped the burgers with carmelized onions!! mm..this is a "must" - it adds such wonderful flavor!  next time i'll add a bit of crushed red pepper for a lil' kick - - and sliced avacado!

These are so delicious, we make them often. I don't have a grill so I usually just put them in a lightly oiled glass dish and bake at 400. Sometimes I use soy sauce instead of vinegar just for a change. I never use cheese but often add sliced avocado. So yummy!

Fantastic!  I added some Mrs. Dash to the seasonings.  I didn't use cheese, but served on buns with grilled onions.  I also grilled sliced sweet potatoes.  I made "Asian Coleslaw" as a side dish. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was great. After putting in the oregano I realized I didn't have basil so used some kind of herb mixture I had on hand, didn't have any Provolone so used Mild Swiss and used good old George for the grill. I also took the advice of other's and brushed a thick slice of onion an grilled that for an awesome open faced sandwich 'cause I didn't have any buns.

I followed other reviewers' suggestions and broiled mine (5 min. each side) and removed the gills. I poured my marinade (reduced to one serving) into a ziplock bag to better coat the mushroom. Next time, I will probably double the marinade and add a few more dashes of red pepper flakes. Overall, quite tasty, especially with provolone cheese and served on a soft (slightly toasted) roll.

This was great! I used dried Italian seasoning instead of seperate basil and oregano, and didn't have provolone, so I used fontina instead. This was so simple and delicioso! Also, used Kaiser rolls and toasted them on the grill as well. Garnished with tomato and romaine. Will definitely make again. Thanks!

Soooo good. My husband loved them, and he is a carnivore.  I didn't realize that these mushrooms were that expensive, however! but well worth it. (4 for $8.50..?)
I didn't grill mine, as my BBQ is still entrenched in a slow- melting snowdrift, but broiled them- watch'em! 
Also used mozzarella, and "Thick-style Lebanese garlic sauce" to drizzle inside.  Sauteed some red onion slices in the marinade as well. Oh yeah, had them on my favorite "bunless burger buns"- a really flat, soft bread that's sliced for you to    fill. Loved them so much we ate the leftovers for supper!

Yummylicious! Grilled it on the George. And as others suggested I topped it with caramelized onions. Used shaved parmiggiano reggiano instead of provolone since that's all i had.

These were very good. I think they would have been even better if I'd marinated them a little longer and added more carmelized onions. This is probably the only portobello mushroom burger recipe I'll use from now on.

Very tasty!  I made these for the first time last night based on all the positive recommendations and I agree.  They were really good on toasted, multigrain kaiser buns with aoili sauce, carmelized onions, spring mix, and tomatoes.

After reading reviews I thought maybe my mushroom-hating husband would like these. Not so much....luckily I made him a turkey burger back-up. :) I, however, loved this! Next time we have hamburgers, i will be having this instead!

I am one of the few vegetarians I know who despises mushrooms, but I decided to give this one a try.  I thought it was phenomenal!!!!  I will definitely be making this on a regular basis now.     I grilled some big thick rings of red onion to top the burgers- I think that helped tone down the vinegar taste.

This was quite good, and much healthier than a beef burger.  Like a few others, I broiled the mushrooms, as I have no grill.  This was my first experience with portobello mushrooms, and I was surprised at how tasty and juicy they were.  Will make again.

This was soooo good, very satisfying and easy to make. It was a rainy day out so I just popped them in the broiler, and hey turned out just as good.

sooo good. I always make portobello burgers in the summer as an alternative to a regular burger.  and I actually had this one at a restaurant once.. balsamic, provolone, and everything.   This time, I cooked the portobello in a non-stick skillet which was sprayed with cooking spray (didn't want to use oil or butter because mushrooms are like sponges and I wanted the flavor of the balsamic to come through nicely).  Served it with some baked onion rings and fresh tomato slices.. so good! I'm sure I'll be making this more this summer.

These "burgers" are wonderful and I make them often. Great for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. I serve them with whole grain buns and pesto mayonnaise: just stir some prepared pesto into mayonnaise. I think it adds a nice taste to the sandwich.

Yummy! We grilled the mushrooms on our gas grilled and liked them best, but we have used the broiler in bad weather. We used goat cheese and grilled our bun. The best.

This is the best shroom burger yet.  Try toasting the bun, it keeps some of the juice from getting too sloppy.  Will make again and again.

We tried this recipe a couple of nights ago and used 2 mushroom caps but I made the full marinade amount.  My husband brushed some of the marinade on them while they grilled.  They were indescribably good! We will definitely make them again.... the very best portabella burgers we have ever tasted.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great idea, but it needs some work. I only did 2 mushrooms, but did not cut the marinade recipe in half. It was pretty tasty, but the vinegar was definately overpowering. I will try it again, but will have to play around with it...maybe use some 2 tbsp each red wine, vinegar, and olive oil.

Great without the bread and sandwich fixings.  I have used with most common cheeses and love it either way!  I usually double the marinaide though.

These were good, but seemed very tangy.  I only used two mushrooms, but kept the marinade portions the same so that could be why.  All in all, a good mushroom burger.

This sandwich was delicious!! I made it for a vegetarian friend of mine and myself and we loved them. I added roasted red peppers and fresh basil to my sandwich along with tomato, red onion and mayo. I highly recommend this recipe!

We have never eaten mushroom burgers.  It was a nice change. We did enjoy them.  However, it is a sandwich we would not want very often.

I actually made this for the first time tonight. I'm on my own this weekend, so I scaled it down. For the marinade, I did have to add a little bit more vinegar and oil; it just wasn't enough for a marinade in the scaled-down version. I was surprised at how fast the outside cooked on the gill side of the mushroom, but again - my first time. It tasted great! I put 2% milk cheese on it, as I'm on Weight Watchers, and put on a light hamburger bun (a bit large for the bun, but no matter). I had some steak fries with it and it was really, really good. I liked the texture and the flavor. Thanks for this recipe.

We LOVE this recipe. We are constantly making these. We also do not use a grill but instead use either my griddle pan or fry pan. Either way, they are so delicious! We also like to add a slice of red onion to each. We forgot to melt the cheese this time but they were still just as tasty. What an amazing way to eat these portabellas!

Made this recipe for the family and they absolutely chowed down! Even my husband, who is a big meat eater, loved it! I didn’t grill them but, broiled them and them did come out so yummy. To me, it’s an inexpensive meal and I definitely will be incorporating more in my weekly meal planning!

Loved these.  My wife felt the vinegar was a little too much for mushroom flavor so will do more olive oil next time.  Concerned that the garlic might be too much, so added just a little less, but barely tasted it (the minced garlic stays on top of the gills, so adding the cheese smoothed out the flavor).  Grilled with gill side down first, then after turning, added blue cheese during last two minutes - very good.

first portabella sandwich ive ever had. i think the vinegar was over powering. ill make it again with much less vinegar. the mushroom was not cooked through. next time ill add broth and let it simmer away to insure the mushroom is cooked through. the taste was good though.

Super easy and quick dinner.  Actually used some older mushrooms, but it still was great!  I did remove the gills only because I had some mold growing on them.

I followed the recipe exactly. It was great. previously I would just grill the mushrooms with no marinade. This definitely kept them moist and more flavorful. Will make it again.

This really  have a good taste its is nice and even though it doesn't taste like a burger to me the meat of the mushroom make you think it is a real burger.  I like this burger and will make again.

This was so much better than i expected!!  I have recently gone vegetarian and this was a perfect meal.  I ended up doing a lettuce wrap instead of buns but if i do this again i will probably get buns.  I also cooked the mushrooms in the oven and it was great!  The balsamic vinegar was the perfect touch.  It was a total hit!

The best portobello  mushroom burger ever.  Be sure to peal off top of mushroom and remove the gills.  Great with caramelized onions.  Far better than a $30 hamburger at a restaurant and much heather for you.

I made this for me and my husband. He wasn't sure about it as he's a beef man, so he made beef burgers too. He stacked his with the beef and enjoyed it. I had just the mushroom burger. I loved it. Made just as directed and assemble as I would a beef burger. I wouldn't change a thing. I would have this rather than beef.

Delicious! Didn’t change a thing. I would suggest for your thicker mushrooms to cook longer. Unfortunately that didn’t cross my mind until after we were eating, seeing as it wasn’t a meat patty. So the thickest mushroom wasn’t totally tender through. Delicious regardless! Wonderful marinade that perfectly complemented the mushroom!

I just made this for dinner! They're very juicy and can replace hamburgers SO easily! I did not taste the garlic at all (garlic fanatic), but the burger was so worth more! I have fallen in love with this recipe! What really caught my eyes is the calories, so I slimmed down the vinegar, oil, and spices. Still perfect though! I would recommend this and will definitely try again! I got more Portobella Mushrooms and ready! Frying pans work just as well! What to remember is that they SHRINK, which is upsetting. When I was first starting, I cut it in half, I didn't want them to shrink! Also, minutes way too long for the flat slide, that's where I stored the garlic. They started to burn, so-. All in all, five stars!

I've been trying lots of different grilled portobello recipes recently, but this one has been the best one yet! I found that the amount of seasonings and balsamic vinegar was just right and gave it the perfect amount of flavor without being too strong. These were awesome!

I threw on some artisanal cheddar, caramelized onions, and a grilled red pepper that had sat in the same marinade as the portobello. Delish.

These are perfect. The marinade is everything. Sometimes I add soy sauce or Worcestershire to the marinade to give it a little  more kick, but it's not needed.

I didn't prepare it as a hamburger, just the mushrooms by themselves and I have to say  they're great!! Definitely can replace the meat and that's coming from a meat lover.

I used my George Forman grill to do this... @300 for 8 minutes... opening every two minutes to put on the marinade... very good ...  I used the STAR brand from Fred Meyer for the vinegar and I thought it tasted great .. I didn't use bread buns I used lettuce to wrap the mushroom up ... very good enjoyed doing this and I will for sure use this recipe again

Very tasty! I used sliced portobello mushrooms and they  worked, but next time I will use the portobello mushroom caps as the recipe called for.   We topped them with swiss cheese, tomato, spinach leaves, avocado slices, and grilled onions on a whole wheat bun.  We will be making these again!

It was good as written.  I don't think my dish was shallow enough when marinating but they flavor was there.  My first time having a portobello burger and as it was good, it is not the same texture as a regular burger though.

Better than a "real" hamburger! The flavor was outstanding. The mushroom, juicy. Used fresh herbs and broiled for 5 minutes on each side (along with some sliced red onion marinated in the same sauce). The only critique is on myself: don't make/assemble the burger until the last minute. The mushroom is so juicy that the burger will fall apart and need to be eaten with a fork and knife. Thanks for an excellent recipe!

Delicious!   Left off the cheese because we are vegan.  The closest thing to a traditional burger, only better!  We brushed them with BBQ sauce and toasted the buns.

Holy moly this recipe is excellent! I used slightly less balsamic and a slightly more oil and subbed thyme for the basil. Cooked on a stovetop grill for about 5 min per side. Delish! Never need to buy a veggie burger again.

I've made this multiple times. I usually make it in the oven instead of on a grill (at about 450 degrees) and add goat cheese instead of the suggested cheese. It's absolutely delicious, although I do find that my burger ends up being a tiny bit watery from the marinade. I don't know if anyone else has found a solution to this. However, this is the best veggie burger recipe that I've found yet. I highly recommend it.

This turned out really well. Found some really nice, big caps. Err on the bigger side if possible. They're more forgiving. I'd also give it more marinating time than 15 minutes. An hour or more to really soak in the favors. Doubled the marinade to make sure there was left over for basting.

This was my first experience with mushroom burgers, so maybe I didn't really know what to expect, but these were off the mark for us.  I probably won't be making these particular ones again, but I would cut the garlic in half if I did.

I don't have a grill so I turned my broiler to "high" and, after coating the mushrooms with the oil mixture (without the vinegar--I didn't have any), I put them in for about 10 minutes, flipping them over once half-way. Served on buns with all the burger toppings (cramelized red onions, avocado, lettuce, tomato, a pickle, ketchup, and mustard) these were delicious.

This was AMAZING !!!!! This will be replacing ground beef for sure.
I cooked the flat top first then flipped and pored the remaining marinade on top of the flip side, which hold the yummy mixture.
Top it with Camembert cheese , raw onion and Djon mustard. I used Thomas English whole wheat english muffin..
OH MY Goodness , SOOOOOO GOOD

Good veggie burger alternative that's more filling than you'd expect.  Remove/cut the stems really low on the mushroom cap so you don't get a lump in the middle of your burger.

I followed the recipe as written. Forget the idea that expensive vinegar makes the difference. It doesn't. I liked it, but it IS a vinegar marinade, hence the strong vinegar flavor. Mushroom ends up having a good flavor. I just ate the shroom with some caramelized onion between the fungi and cheese. Smelled good cooking and tasted good too. Acetic acid has multiple beneficial aspects for the human body.

I REALLY wanted to love this recipe! There is nothing in it that I don't enjoy, however they lacked in flavor and I couldn't do the texture. I made it twice - once the way it was written and once with some of the reviewers suggestions (Carmelized onions, roasted red peppers, and peeling back the outer skin and scooping out the gills) to no avail. I sadly won't make this again.

I really liked this recipe, it was delicious. I didn't have dried basil so I used fresh and it worked out fine. I would make more of the marinade and put the shrooms top side down to start and pour the marinade into the gills,it soaks it up nicely! Then use the extra marinade to bast the tops when you turn them over. Next time I will try to peel the tops first as well. Didn't have provolone so I used goat cheese, I think a lot of melty white cheeses would work nicely in this recipe.

Absolutely delicious!! I followed the recipe exactly and grilled them on my indoor grill.  I used a different topping sauce (actually a fresh salsa is perfect!) Made it for the first time and served it to company and we were all in love! Have two buns left over and we're getting more mushrooms and having it again tonite! It's a keeper and will be a regular around here!!

I have been making these for a few years and eat low carb. Just leave out the the bun. :)
I have used my grill, but my cast iron skillet also works great. I buy the large portobello mushrooms season and sometimes marinate it, slide a nice grilled burger, some Swiss cheese (I like the way Swiss melts), tomato sometimes on top.  It's the same idea/recipe only no bun and eat it with a fork. 
If want a delicious burger, this is it. Yum!

I didn't know you were suppose to take the gills out and peel the mushroom.  I agree with another reviewer that they have a beef flavour.  It is an interesting fact that they are an overgrown cremini.

There is nothing more to be said about this Designer Burger except WONDERFUL!
We're fortunate to be near a Mushroom Growing Facility and we take advantage of it.  3 to 4 inch Portobello mushroom that are offered on rare occasions.

This was incredible! I didn't have any veggie burgers, so I used a black bean burger instead and it was still fantastic. It's probably better with veggie burger, though. Absolutely delicious, I will recommend this to my friends and family!

This was a terrific recipe.  I have never made portobello like this.  I would have thought the soaking in liquid would have made is spongy, but I didn't think so.  It absorbs the vinegar, but I didn't think it was to strong  I pretty much followed the recipe.  I used whatever spice I had on hand.  I ate it on a ciabatta roll topped with a tomato, feta cheese, avocado and onion.  What also is so perfect about this recipe is you can make this for one person or ten people without any trouble.  Hope this is as good when its not on the grill.

Wonderful Flavorful recipe. I marinaded the mushrooms for only 10 minutes, topped them with fresh spinach and feta; broiled them for 8 minutes and Bam! The best broiled portobello I've made at home!

These are delicious. Broiled in my toaster oven and they turned out great. Used white balsamic for the marinade. Served on a wheat roll with carmelized onions. Will make often.

Simply perfect! My wife and I eat these on a regular basis. We generally leave out the cheese and instead add avocado, a slice of roasted red pepper, some type of greens and occasionally a fried egg, but the portobello preparation is what makes it!

Delicious! Easy! Was too lazy to go outside and grill. Made under the broiler after a late work day...very satisfied!  Served open face with mixed baby greens and broiled onions. Drizzled with extra balsamic before serving.

These were absolutely delicious! I broiled mine in the oven and it turned out great. You can hardly believe there isn't beef in these. I'd definitely recommend this recipe! Especially to folks trying to cut back on red meat.

Can't believe I haven't rated this already. These were EXTREMELY good. Followed the recipe to the letter (a first for me). I'm a meat lover through and through, traditionally at every single meal. Have been looking to cut back so I don't die by 30. Seriously better than the majority of beef burgers you will come across.

Unreal! Broiled caps 5 min both side on a baking rack with a cookie sheet under it. Searved with toasted buns, carmalized onions and thinly sliced tomatos.Also we put hallomi cheese on the burger.  If you've never tried this British delight its amazing. We seared   the cheese in a fry pan with a bit of olive oil. Perfect bit of salty goodness added to all the flavored :)

My first attempt at portobello burgers---and with much success! Thanks for the simple and delish dish. The broiler notes are true. No need to grill and still good results.

always looking for a meat substituted dinner I decided to give these a try. Not being a huge fan of mushrooms I really did like these. Very tasty.

Great taste!  Made exactly as suggested, only difference was I chopped up fresh basil instead of dried, and used swiss cheese.  Added avocados, tomatoes, grilled onion all on a toasted onion bun.  Didn't feel over-stuffed like I normally do after eating a hamburger.  Will be making it again for sure!

This recipe is so simple and so delicious.  The only thing we changed was we used havarti cheese instead of provolone because it gives more a kick to the flavor.  We also added fresh avocado slices.  Cooking it on the george foreman grill was fast and easy. Will definitely make this again.  Also the marinade would be great for chicken.

excellent, made them exactly as shown and  were delicious. I like them without bun, you can taste the portobello better.

Pretty good, but marinade not full of flavor I was expecting. Next time I'll used fresh basil and mozzarella instead of provolone and fresher mushrooms.

So I followed the recipe exactly, did it with very large portabello mushroom caps and they came out perfectly.  I had to double the marinade recipe because the mushrooms were so big, but it worked out anyway.  I also topped them with swiss cheese and ate them on a 100 calorie bun and it was absolutely delicious.  I even served the "mushroom" burger to two of my friends that are anti-mushroom people and they loved them too.  Came over another night and we repeated the recipe again.  I saved this one and will definitely do it again ! ! ! !

I made this for a vegetarian girl who never showed up for dinner, so we ended up eating them as a side dish.  The flavor was very good.  I've had this at an expensive restaurant and it wasn't as good as this recipe.  I think it would be a more tasty alternative to a veggie burger.  I let it marinate for about 2 hours.

Delicious!! My husband, who is not a fan of portobellos even liked it. I made extra marinate and used it on summer zucchini and squash, and then grilled it next to the portobellos, and boy was it delicious!! I will definitely make it again!

Great recipe!  I made this for a family holiday pool party for 14 and everyone loved it!  Used equal amounts (1/4 cup) of olive oil and balsamic vinegar and doubled the recipe for 14 mushrooms.

These are AMAZING! Made these for my 19 yr. old son's vegetarian episode, and we both loved them. Only changes: used fresh herbs from the garden and forgot about the caps whilst cooking for the carnivores- hence a 45 min. marinating time.Change nothing, but do use a high-quality balsamic, and enjoy!

This was not only easy, but delicious as well. I sauteed red onions in some evoo and butter for an extra topping and broiled the shrooms in my toaster oven.  My husband, the meat lover, LOVED them too!

These were delicious.  We added a slice of Hot Pepper Jack cheese instead of the provolone and added a nice serving of carmelized onions on a toasted bun.  We'll be making these again.

love this, the recipe is sooo easy, and the mushroom turned out really juicy!!  I also reduced the olive oil by half, and used more balsamic vinegar than called for.  I did not need to use any aioli sauce, mustard, etc.  The remaining marinate on the portobello mushroom has so much flavor already.

Delicious and easy.  It's easy to overcook the mushroom caps - you're just trying to heat them up and maybe sear them a bit for appearance.  Beats veggie patties any day.

The whole family loved these!!  We will be making these a number of times over the summer.  We only had mozza cheese, but will try a different cheese next time.  I toasted the buns under the broiler and it really added to the whole texture.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Excellent recipe!  Followed the directions for the marinade exactly and the mushrooms had a great flavor.  I grilled on each side for about 6 minutes, and even though the four mushrooms varied largely in size, they were all juicy and flavorful.  I didn't even add any extra toppings besides a little season salt.  I am only a medium mushroom fan, but with the bun, provolone cheese, and marinade, this recipe is definitely a keeper!

Yum yum gimme some!  So delicious!  Didn't alter a thing except to up the oil and balsamic because our 'porties' were ginormous!  Topped with blue cheeses and tomatoes.  Grilled the buns.  Boyfriend spread on some hummus but I left mine naked.  Super easy and YUM!

When my boyfriend came home he laughed at what I was making as he's very much a meat person. Well he was pretty blown away. The main thing that I took from this recipe was the marinade. I bought ciabatta buns and put a little of mayo with garlic on the top and then toasted the buns. I also took red peppers and red onions and roasted them and put them on top. Instead of provolone I used herb and garlic havartti. Threw a little romaine on and it was so good!

I have always made the portobello mushrooms this way to eat as a side with meat. They are delicious, however, I never thought of using it as a hamburger.  Great idea and I could use any cheese of my own choosing.  If I use the provolone, I think I am going to use the sharp flavored one for more zip. Way to go Bob.  Thanks.

This was okay.  I felt the balsamic was a little overpowering.

I love love love portobella burgers! We have made them on the grill, the george foreman, broiled them, used a toaster oven and I love them any which way! The provolone is awesome with them and any other veggies you add on it-onions, tomatoes, lettuce, ect-just add to it. I could eat these everyday.

I have added some things to this YUMMY recipe to make it even better!  First, tonight I did not have any garlic =( so I found garlic olive oil =) YUM!  Good alternative.  I also just grill them on the Foreman grill.  Next I mix mayo with sundried tomatos packed in olive oil and Italian Herbs.  That is a delicious spread and I serve with fresh campari tomatoes and avacodo.  Yummy!!  Thanks

Great! Broiled 4-5 min. each side, used my roasting pan with rack. Used fresh herbs, just increased a bit. During the marinade time I had enough time to brown some onions and make an aioli. I served fresh steamed asparagus on the side. As the balsamic is a little sweet, and adding the onions made it sweeter, next time I'll do the "burger" the same way and put something with a little kick on the plate, maybe a few sliced radishes. Other reviewers are right, you need a decent balsamic. If I serve this with the aioli on the side, it's a great party food for both my vegan and non-vegan friends.

This recipe is AWESOME! I ate my first veggie burger last weekend and fell in love with it, so I decided to try this recipe and cook one homemade. It made about 5 burgers, two of which I ate that very night! The other three didn't make it too long...

Awesome replacement for a regular burger. The marinate gives a distinctive argentinian chimichurri sauce flavor.

This was very delicious. I like mushrooms but to be honest the size of the Portobello was intimadating at first. I let the seasoning soak on and cooked on my George Foreman grill with some provolone cheese and red onion. Also I ate on a wheat burger bun with dijon mustard and a lil mayo IT WAS DELISH!! cant wait to eat again :)

Burgers came out great! Used broiler instead of skillet (cooked directly on grate w/ cookie pan beneath), 350 degrees, 5 minutes each side. Did not have balsamic vinegar used balsamic vinaigrette in lieu and skipped the olive oil. Will definitely make again!

I had never made a portabellow mushroom burger before---this was wonderful.    I didn't make the aioli sauce--- instead I just mixed together some mayo, dijon mustard, and basil & sun dried tomato creamcheese.  Just used store bought hamburger buns that I toasted on the oven.  Grill is outta comission so I just broiled them about 4-5 minutes on each side.  Juicy and wonderful!

This Mushroom Burger was the first that I have tasted and I think that it was very good, but that the balsamic vinegar was a little sour taste to it, but it was very good, and delicious. Overall, great Burger!

This is a great recipe!  We've made this quite a few times now and it's always a big hit.  I usually add a bit more garlic and fresh basil.  We like it with the really thin sandwich buns.

I had something similar at a very good restaurant at Whistler Mountain once.    RULE#1-Get a good whole wheat bun-- RULE #2-Get a good cheese (not cheddar).   I also made a basil mayo by adding some basil to my mayo and letting it sit about 15 minutes. YUM! Even my hubby liked this recipe.  Will definately make it again, and try it with different cheeses and maybe a little less oregano (but I dont like oregano)

Perfection. So, so good. A wonderful substitution for us veggie-heads. The portobello has enough meatiness to be perfectly filling. I love the pairing of the balsamic and provolone.

I was expecting this recipe to be outstanding based on the reviews, but my husband and I thought these were just ok. The oregano and basil were a bit overpowering. Won't make a portobello mushroom burger using this recipe again.

This was really good. Didn't have balsamic vinegar so I used the bottle vinegrette dressing. Used sliced mozzarella instead of provolone cheese and spinach instead of lettuce. For the grilled onions I just seasonded with  Adobe all purpose seasoning and parsley. Will make again.

I topped with sauteed onions and blue cheese instead of provolone.  Excellent.  My carnivore BF loved them.

These were good, but they could have somehow been more flavorful. I did prepare caramelized onions like some reviewers stated, didn't do much for me and they weren't really worth the extra effort imo. I think I will try a different cheese next time also too? I will play around with these though.

SO GOOD. Instead of provolone cheese, I use fresh mozzarella and throw on some fresh basil and tomato.

These are so great - I've made them on the grill and broiled them in the toaster oven, both are amazing. We serve the mushrooms on top of a thick toasted piece of ciabatta bread - delicious!!

Amazing , I LOVE IT!  I put the marinade on, in the cap of the mushroom and let them marinate for about 15-30 mins. I also always add balsalmic sauted onions. Then I broil them in the oven and add the cheese in the last few minutes, they are always fantastic!

These were great - simple yet really yummy.  I used my cast iron grill pan which worked perfectly and didn't have any provolone so I used fresh mozarella which was awesome.  I will definitely be making these again...

mmmmm...so great- and healthy too! This is basically like marinating portobellos in balsamic vinaigrette. We're having ours on the grill with swiss cheese. Also works well in the oven if a grill is unavailable.

Fabulous! I made these for Fathers Day and everyone loved them. They all wanted the recipe. Instead of provolone I used goat cheese and sundried tomatoes on top. I would take this over a regular burger any day.

Served my newly vegetarian family this wonder burger tonight and my 17 year old son, said first,"it didn't make me feel like '' when I finished and then that he'd eat it as long as the ketchup was on the table." Woo Hoo. My husband loved it too. I followed all the suggestions and used my Jenn Air grill and it was a little juicy but probably this won't happen on the outside grill.A definite keeper...especially when find the 'srooms on sale. Thanks for a great meal!

Excellent!  I used fresh rosemary and oregano because that is what I had around, but followed the recipe from there.  It was delicious.  My husband was not so excited about this recipe (he told me later) but ended up really liking it.  I think this is something we will make again for a quick and healthy week night dinner.

Super easy and quick to make.  Quite delicious.  I made it without cheese and it still tasted yummy.  A nice alternative from the usual burger fare.

These were very good! Normally Portobello mushroom burgers are very juicy and make the burger buns all soggy.  But these weren't excessively juicy - just right!

Though not my favorite portobello burger recipe, this was still pretty good, and a good option for the grill.

I put a couple of these on the grill for lunch today.  Wow!  These are the best way to fix Portobello mushroom burgers I have ever tried.  Awesome!!

I used this to just make marinaded mushrooms. We didn't think it was anything outstanding. The balsamic vinegar was a little eye-watering, and the mushrooms weren't very firm. I doubt I'll make this again, but thanks anyway.
