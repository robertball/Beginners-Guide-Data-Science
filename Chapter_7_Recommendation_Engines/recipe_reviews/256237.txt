Thank you for sharing this recipe. I've been missing my spaghetti sauce and this looks like a super substitute. I couldn't find any kabocha squash right now so will make in the fall. So excited to try it. I'll revisit this review once I have tried it.

This is a pretty good sauce whether you are looking for a replacement for tomato sauce or simply want something different. I added the capers and added spicy Italian green olives at the end along with a healthy dose of fresh hot peppers. I used purple carrots so mine was a deep wine color. You could use this as a spread on bruschetta. Thank you for the recipe.
