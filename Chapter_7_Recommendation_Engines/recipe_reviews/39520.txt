Good recipe for a sauce that complements everything from eggs to kielbasa, etc.  The only change I made was to use apple cider vinegar (all I had) and the sauce was delish.  The only bit of advice I have to share is to not make this right before the company shows up - it fills the house with a vinegar smell as it comes to a boil...I was scrambling to be rid of the odor :-)

Great sauce Laurie! I made it as written, except I substituted white vinegar for tarragon vinegar, because that's what we had here. Awesome on ham!

The flavour of this vinegary, sweet sauce is good and complements ham well.  However, the texture was floury.  Half the recipe was enough for 3 adults.

Very good.  I served this as a dip with our ham and swiss melts.  Tasty.  I haven't heard of tarragon vinegar so I used white vinegar and added some tarragon to the sauce.  Turned out great.  Will be in my keeper list.  Thanks.

Very easy to make. Nice consistency. A bit too vinegary for me. I would add half the amount and then adjust to taste.

This sauce was excellent. Even my picky 5-year old liked it. I've read the other reviews and no one in my family thought this was too floury or too vinergary. It was the perfect combination of sweet and tart. A really nice sauce that I will make again! Thanks!!!

This was great.  The sauce was at the perfect consistency about four minutes after it started boiling and it was on low.  I wasn't able to start serving at that point, though, and just kept it on the lowest setting I could and stirred it constantly.  It was about 10 minutes from the point that it started boiling that I was able to serve it.  The sauce was a little thicker than I would have preferred.  It was a little filmy, but that was my fault.

I substituted white vinegar for tarragon vinegar and added 1/8 t. salt and 1/8 t. lemon pepper seasoning.  The flavor was wonderful.

I served this over broiled tilapia and steamed snap peas.  It was outstanding over the peas.  It was a little overpowering for the tilapia, but I am going to try it over a heartier fish like salmon or mahi next time.

Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very yummy!  It went very well with the ham I cooked, perfect combo of salty and sweet.  I did listen to some of the suggestions and used half the amount of sugar, and I just used regular white vinegar, also I did not have mustard powder, so I used prepard yellow mustard.(you have to use 2X the amount of perpard mustard vs. mustard powder)  It turned out great!

WOW!!  Simply amazing mustard!  Great on everything we have tried it on, not just ham.  This is now a staple in my fridge, tastes fantastic with sweet potato fries!!  The only changes that I made were using malt or cider vinegar for the tarragon (no one here likes tarragon)and I reduced the sugar.

I thought it was too sweet as well.  I added a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1/4 tsp salt, approx 1/2 tsp dry rosemary.  I cooked it an additional 5-10 minutes and strained out the rosemary and found the consistency almost perfect.  Everyone loved it.

Made this today and used as a dipping sauce for Ham Croquettes (also on this site).  Yumalicious!  I agree with another reviewer that next time I will cut back on the sugar (personal preference), but this recipe will be used at our house regularly.

This was delicious! We had it with our Thanksgiving ham and it accompanied it beautifully. As we had a lot left over, I also used it in chicken wraps for the kids and they loved it!

Good basic recipe, ideal for tweaking. I cut the sugar in half at the recommendation of other reviewers - good idea, the sauce was plenty sweet with less sugar. I found the vinegar taste to be a smidge overpowering, next time I'll cut it down a few tablespoons.

This sauce is excellent.  I didn't have tarragon vinegar, so I used white vinegar, and it turned out great.  I absolutely loved it.  I drizzled it over corned beef.  Yum!

This was awonderful &  easy recipe and ready in no time,.  My mom is diabetic so I substituted 4 packets of Stevia and a heaping table spoon of honey for the the sugar.  We also did not have Taragon vinegar and substituted rice vinegar and basalmic 1/4 cup of each.  I would try the tarragon next time

My husband and I enjoy more of a savoury sauce for our ham dinner.  All though this recipe tasted great for possibly chicken strips or other foods it wasn't our favourite for ham.

This was perfect with our Easter ham yesterday! Just a note: this can be easily done in the microwave. Whisk the milk and egg yolks together in a microwave safe bowl (I used a Pyrex measuring cup) then stir in the other ingredients. Nuke for 2 minutes and you're done. Great consistency and a nice tangy flavor.  Like others, I used cider vinegar and added some tarragon. I also used 1/2 prepared Dijon mustard and 1/2 of the mustard powder/vinegar solution. Lastly, I used maple syrup instead of sugar. Will keep this one on file!

The consistency was nice on this, however every person that ate it said it was too sweet.  So if I ever made this again I would decrease the sugar.

I thought this was a good sauce. I made it with white vinegar because that was all I had. I found it a little sweet, although that could be more my sensitivity then the recipe itself. It is the best mustard sauce recipe I have tried so far. Thank you Laurie!!

I used white wine vinegar as I decided to make this at the last minute and had no time to go to the store.  Mine didn't get thick enough to put on the ham so I served it as a dip in a little dish - may have been my fault because I was a little rushed.  I thought it was great, my husband says way too sweet.  I might try again with less sugar or different vinegar.

This sauce is to ham what icing is to a cake.  It gave it the finishing touch.  Made half a batch and there was lots.  Didn't have tarragon vinegar so I used cider vinegar and it was still very good.  Gave it four starts because I adapted the recipe.  I'll always serve this sauce with ham in the future. It was a big hit and very easy to make.

This was good, but honey mustard has very similar flavors and is a lot easier to make.

Halved the recipe and only used 1/4 cup sugar.  Still way too sweet for our liking.  Not quite what I expected.  My family thought the flavor was a little overwhelming on our delicious ham.

It was good!  I'd imagine it would be great on straight ham, like the picture indicates.  It was too powerful for leftover ham bits and rotini.  If serving with something less salty than a ham, I'd throw some salt in there.

I often make a ham sauce out of prepared mustard and light brown sugar. It is good, but I wanted something more this time.  I couldn't find tarragon vinegar in the supermarket, so I took another reviewer's advice and used apple cider vinegar.
The sauce turned out fine. I noticed that some reviewers thought the recipe used too much sugar, but I went ahead and used what was called for. Now I'm wondering if I had used about a third brown sugar and two-thirds white sugar the sauce would have had a bit more oomph. I'm going to try that next time.

I made this twice--the first time, I followed the exact recipe and the sauce was ridiculously sweet--so I halved the sugar and it was absolutely perfect, sweet and deeelish. Will be making this every time I serve ham. All my guests at Christmas dinner raved about it. Thanks for a great recipe.

A tasty mustard sauce.  It is on the sweet side, which goes nicely with the salty ham.  I had to substitute white vinegar and added 1/8 tsp tarragon.

Like some other reviewers, I did not have tarragon vinegar, so I used white vinegar.  I also added an extra tbsp of sugar, just for preference of taste.  It came out great and it was a hit!  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very nice sauce for ham although a little too sweet.  I made the recipe as written except for the tarragon vinegar.  However next time I would decrease the sugar by 30% and increase the powdered mustard about 20% .  I used red wine vinegar and 1/4 tsp of dried tarragon as I did not have tarragon vinegar.  My husband liked it as it was.

As others, no tarragon vinegar so I used white. I'm more of a savory guy so I cut the sugar to below 1/2 cup, (eyeballed). The sauce was excellent with ham, it cut the saltiness, while the sweetness and vinegar balanced out. I would probably still cut the sugar a bit more to probably 1/3 cup. It was very good.

So this recipe was ok, but just way too sweet. The sugar needs to be dropped down and the mustard powder increased to make this a repeat recipe. Also, in the end it ended up just an off white color, way too thick and again, sweet.
