Theses were the best! If you like kfc fire grilled wings,Well theses are even better! The only thing I did different was to cut salt in 1/2 and used season salt in the rub, cut that amount in 1/2 as well, Made theses last night, and are having them again tonight!  with fresh sweet corn and macaroni salad YUM!

I brined the wings overnight and the wings were a little salty.  Two hours is probably right.  Added the juice of one lime to the coating mix for a little zing. Baked them for about 45 minutes at 425 degrees, turned the wings after 20 minutes.

I thought it was an interesting idea, so I tried this weekend. Unfortunately, we were very disappointed. Not really any flavor other than some sweetness, which is not our favorite flavor for wings. Sorry, but I will not try this recipe again.

I only added 1tbs of salt to the chicken and coke which I thought was perfect. I didn't pat the chicken dry after darining out the coke cause I didn't see it making a difference. The chicken came out great kind of like bourbon chicken.

We really liked this recipe!  It had too much salt in it the first time I made it so I cut wayyyyy back on the salt and the family loved it the second time! I probably only used a couple of tablespoons in the brine mixture and then didn't use as much in the coating. I used chicken legs and they were a big hit!

This was very delicious.  I liked the rub a lot.  I used a Slovenian soda called Cockta, which is a citrusy cola.  You can get it at specialty liquor stores.

Best chicken I ever made. I went to Publix and they were sold out of wings, so I bought thighs instead. Like some others, I cut the salt portions in half. Grilled the outside to a crisp on the open grill, then wrapped in foil and covered to let them smoke for almost an hour.  SO good! Thanks for this awesome recipe!

This is one lovely, simple, and outstanding brine for grilling chicken drumettes. I have my own grilling rub, but this brine is superb. If you're not familiar with how to brine, learn about how it works and brining ratios and times! :) Thanks for this nice recipe!

I was making over 60 wings for a party and I tried three different recipes from Allreicipies.com. This one was the hands down favorite. They went so fast that I  never even got to eat any from this batch. Next time I will be sure and try em myself!!

Absurdly delicious. Like other readers, I halved the rub recipe salt. Only had smoked paprika on hand so we used that. Brined the wings a little longer than 2 hrs due to exigent circumstances, but no perceptible negative effects. They were a big crowd favorite for all ages.

UPDATE: Made this again using ginger beer instead of cola. Just as juicy and with a little certain something extra. Glad it's backyard barbeque season again. Making these this weekend!!

OK, so I started this recipe last night (brining the wings per the instructions) followed by the recommended marinade paste just before cooking.  Let's start off with a few observations:

--I smoked the wings at 250 degrees for 2hr 45 minutes and the chicken was falling off the bone
--Meat was super tender and with great flavor
--I also used my own dry rub seasoning
--Some of the wings were smoked with only the overnight marinade; nothing else

I am highly impressed with this recipe; super simple and delicious.  The wings were delicious without anything added (just the overnight brine/salt mixture....this marinade can stand on its own.  Also, the paste created from the recipe is tasty as well and my very own dry rub was fantastic as well.  Only thing I did differently was cut the amount of salt in the brine by 1/2 (I heeded the advice of others who have tried this recipe); I'm glad I did for it came out perfect.  Maybe next time I'll try them in the oven instead (then again probably not) for smoking these babies seems to be the way to go).  Finally, I used applewood in my smoker.  Good stuff!

The wings were so salty, no one could eat them. I can't figure out why, but I may try it again minus the salt.

I made it both on the grill and in the oven. Both very good. I do recommend that new cooks cook it in the oven it is easier to cook and caramelize the sugars. If you doo it in the oven the last few minuets put the oven on broil and crack open  the oven door and cook until golden

Followed recipe to the 'T' for the first time making this.... way too salty!!!!  To the point inedible for us.   Cut the salt by 1/2 in the brine and do not add any to the rub.  You can always salt on the plate. .... which will cut the sweetness if desired. Adding sriracha  to the rub will give you a sweet and hot rub...

Cut recipe in half, as we only did two pounds of wings. Omitted salt from paste since the brine was plenty salty.  They were amazing and so juicy. Best wings we have ever made! Didn't have kosher salt so used table salt instead.

Followed recipe. It wasn't good. Too much salt & brown sugar.

Would have been better with just store bought BBQ sauce.
