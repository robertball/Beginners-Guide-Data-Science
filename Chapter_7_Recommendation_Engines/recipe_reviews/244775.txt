Absolutely awful.   Made it as written. Tasted like sugar and baking soda.

Really good.  I used coconut sugar instead of cane sugar, which made them less sweet.  Made them as muffins and baked them about 40 minutes, but I could have taken them out earlier.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I made 4 loaves using this recipe on Friday. I made a few modifications instead of white sugar I used organic granulated sugar for the first batch and just brown sugar for the second. I added a little more salt and nutmeg than called for and I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil. I did need to bake it a full hour. It is Sunday and my family has been through 2 loaves and is working on the 3rd. I gave the last to a friend. So far it has been a hit!

I made two loaves. They smelled absolutely delicious. The breads wouldn't bake through and were still gummy on the snide after baking for almost two hours. I tasted the top that was cooked and it is fantastic.  If somebody could figure out baking time, I would make this.

Four stars for taste and texture. I made muffins instead of a loaf and they took over an hour to cook, not 20 minutes as written in the notes.  Thank you for the recipe.
