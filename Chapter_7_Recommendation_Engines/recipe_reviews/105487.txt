This was a very easy recipe, and the dough was very workable.  However, the taste is quite bland.  I would increase the amount of Splenda by 1/2 cup, and add an extra teaspoon of cloves, cinnamon, and ginger.

These cam out great!  I'm even eating them plain!  I used a butter substitute too.  The batter stunk, but don't worry the cookies taste and smell fine.  Also Lightly Dust your cutting board, they are not like sugar cookies and Do Not need as much flour.  They also rise a bit so make sure any lines or designs you put in your cookies are deep so you can see them.  I baked them for 8 minutes, and you really do get a lot of cookies too!  I'll be handing them out for Halloween. ;)
