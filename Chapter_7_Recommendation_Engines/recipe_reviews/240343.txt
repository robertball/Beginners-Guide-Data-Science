It's ok, the mayo is very tangy ... I'd maybe use ranch or ceaser dressing instead. And more hit sauce :)

Loved it. Simple and delicious. The only thing I added was a touch of lime juice. Thank you for sharing.

I was just okay, it was too soupy. I think it would be better with cream cheese rather than mayo. It was good mixed with refried beans as a spicy bean dip option.
