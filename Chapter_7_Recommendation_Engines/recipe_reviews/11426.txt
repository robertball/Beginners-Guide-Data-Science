A real compliment to the frosted apricot cookie recipe.  I used no sugar added Smuckers jam and they were still quite sweet but not too sweet.  Good!

Tasty and pretty. It is a thin frosting almost more of a glaze, but it set nicely on top of my cake and tasted subtle and delicious.

I wanted a jelly frosting for peanut butter cupcakes, and this was the simplest I found.  I just used margarine, powdered sugar, and blackberry preserves in place of apricot.  It turned out delicious.  I can't wait to try it again with different flavors.

Great frosting for these cookies.  I can't wait to try it with strawberry or peach or blackberry preserves.  Thanks, Mary Ann.

Just what I needed for a white layer cake that I filled with apricot/passion fruit preserves.   I subbed in these preserves and omitted the pecans.  This topped the cake perfectly, a keeper for sure!
