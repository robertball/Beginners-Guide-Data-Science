These are absolutely delicious and the possibilities are endless!  We happen to be gluten free/dairy free, along with a few other allergens, so we had to miss out on the best parts of this recipe and it was STILL fabulous!!  Love it!  We were surprised at how nice and crisp the eggplant was and how perfectly it worked as "sandwich bread."  This is a terrific Paleo recipe when made with Almond Flour (as we did).

I made the recipe exactly as described.  It was good but, not 5 stars good.  They actually tasted a little better cold.  Since I don't normally have any of these ingredients on hand I will not make again.

We loved this recipe at our house! My husband is a meat lover so he, of course, wanted the salami. I, on the other hand, could do without meat on most occasions so I actually put the provolone cheese and a slice of tomato on mine in place of the salami. Delicious! I would give it another star if I could because my year and a half old loved it as well!

I loved the ease in making these and because they can be served warm or at room temperature, they would be perfect quartered and served as appetizers.  I thought they were very good and will try them again using pepperoni and other ingredients for the filling.

this was very tasty but i think i'm too hung up on breaded eggplant needing marinara or some kind of sauce to accompany it hence the 4* rating.. bf bought a spanish deli pack of three different types of meats (spanish salami, jamon serrano, and chorizo cantimpalo).. we used havarti cheese.. our eggplant made more like 5 sandwiches but we had enough leftover breading components to coat one sliced mexican squash.. threw it in the oven with the eggplant and enjoyed.. ty for the recipe

Hi, everyone:) love this recipe! Made many changes for diet restrictions salt/fat. First,no aluminum foil,set directly on olive oil sprayed pan. This omitted having to turn them, they browned on both perfectly. I used olive oil spray on pan and sandwich tops before oven. I found King Arthur gluten free all purpose flour,used that and instead of salt/pepper in flour I used garlic pepper. Gives it a great flavor. I added Red Hot into the egg dip. I used 4C seasoned unsalted bread crumbs a staple here with no salt and just the best flavor.The cheese was a challenge, used deli swiss at first cut in half but found it was too much cheese and they leaked. So next batch I switched to the party pre-cuts, smaller perfect amount with no leakage. I also tried the shredded cheese which i thought wouldn't stay in upon dipping but it actually worked fine. Instead of salami slices I used Margherita low sodium pepperoni bag using 4 slices to a sandwich and it was just enough. Last, I keep a mixture of 1/2 grated parmesan cheese and 1/2 4C seasoned unsalted breadcrumbs with garlic pepper in a container in the refrigerator at all times because we use it for everything.It's usually 2c./2c./1 tablespoon. until you figure out how much garlic pepper works for your family. Because of using mixture no parmesan topping needed.Used aluminum foil to cover once browned about 30 minutes. Used 2 pieces of eggplant per sandwich. The olive oil spray and other changes really cut back on /salt/fat:)Enjoy!

First time trying eggplant and I was not disappointed. I followed some other advice and left the slices in a colander for 20 mins, heavily salted, to draw the bitterness out. Then rinsed and patted dry with paper towel.

Also I don’t think all that oil is necessary. I used about 2 teaspoons on the tin foil, spread out with a brush. Then just sprayed the tops with some olive oil spray. They were very crispy and brown still, and saved a lot of calories! (Mine came out to 160 calories each.)

Also - I got 16 slices from my eggplant, so I made 8 sandwiches. I still used Ched John’s measurements for the breading and flour and I had a TON leftover. So just an FYI to maybe cut back on that a bit if you don’t want to waste it all. 

I served it with some marinara for dipping. They were really delicious!

This was my first experience, so I did take the time to peel and salt the eggplant slices.  Didn't want to be turned off to the taste of eggplant right off the bat.  I didn't have cayenne pepper, so I subbed paprika and I think it had a fantastic flavor.  My only concern was that, just after eating my first 'samwich', I saw the nutrtional values and was appalled.  58 carbs?  150 fat?  2000 cals?  Whaa...?

Rating this a 5 for taste and simplicity. Makes a great weeknight dinner. I subbed fontina for the provolone because that was what I had on hand and served with warm marinara - because my husband has to have sauce!  I did peel the eggplant and salt it to eliminate the bitterness (just a personal preference.). These were very simple to make. Much less work than frying the eggplant - and healthier too! The only thing that I found odd was that it called for 16 slices of eggplant to make 4 sandwiches. Not sure what I should do with the extra slices of eggplant :-)

This was sooooo good. I was a little afraid because it was so simple, no spices. I tried it and it is great. The salami gave it a perfect flavor. I was going to freeze some, but I'm eating one every day for breakfast instead.  A must try if you are an eggplant fan.

This was soooo good. I bought 2 eggplant at Sprouts and was looking for something to cook that I have not before and saw this recipe.

This is what I did to make it easier...

I took one side of the eggplant and floured...egg...breadcrumbs...then I put down the little olive oil and laid the first half...then I built my sandwich on top of that.  I used shredded cheese and ham because that is what I had on hand...so I put shredded cheese..lean ham...cheese...ranch...then I dipped the top part in all three and put it on the other half to complete the sandwich.

I put the parmesian cheese on top and instead of olive oil...I used pam spray...

I first built the sandwich and tried dipping it...but found the cheese coming out...so I then decided to do one half at a time...this was much easier.

I also put the salt..pepper...and paprika in the eggs not the flour so more would stick to the eggplant...

This was so good...better than bread...it is light...and I always love cooked hard cheese...

I asked Holy Spirit to make it taste good...and He did...next time I will try adding tomato and some spinach too for variation...

Thank you for the recipe...

These are SO-O-O-O-O yummy!  Made them for the first time quite awhile ago.  Just made them again & was reminded of how delicious they are.  Followed the recipe exactly.  The sandwiches would probably also be good w/pepperoni instead of salami & mozzarella instead of provolone.  In any event, hubby & I really loved them.

I've been making these for 30 years sans any meat. I've used different cheeses depending on what's on hand. I always fry them, but baking is definitely easier.  I tried this as written and they were pretty good. We prefer the fried version, but this recipe is good if you're in a hurry.

This was easy to make and I'll make this again! I used olive oil spray instead of drizzling the oil, thinking that would make a more even coating. I was worried that the eggplant skin would be tough, but it wasn't. I'll use less flour and a little less panko next time.

I absolutely love every recipe of Chef John's that I have tried.  I love the videos; he is an excellent teacher!  I wish I could taking cooking classes from him.  He seems to always know exactly the perfect combination of ingredients to create magical, yummy dishes.  And, most of them are very easy with ingredients you most likely have in the house.  Thanks so much, Chef John.  I am definitely a fan of yours!!!!

Made the recipe exactly as written and it came out great. I was concerned about the prep but everything came together easily and really didn’t take that long. Loved that they can be prepared ahead and eaten at room temp.

I made this for lunch and me and my boyfriend really liked it! I didn't have any salami or provolone on hand and used ham and cheddar instead and it became a great take on a ham and cheese sandwich. I sweated the eggplant in advance and happy I did! Cooking directions were perfect for tender but not too mush eggplant!

EXCLLENT!  I used buffalo mozzarella in place of provolone, personal preference only.  Placed fresh basil between layers.  These are delicious warm or at room temperature. I couldn't tell you how they would taste as leftovers - because there weren't any!  Only change I would make next time is one less slice of salami in each sandwich to cut down on the salt level. I cut these in quarters and used them as an appetizer.

Wow! This recipe is fantastic, even more delicious that I expected and a big hit at my house!  It is even delicious reheated the next day.  I've come to trust Chef John and will usually choose his recipes over any others.  Thank you, Chef, for all your great contributions to my favorite recipe site, from my now favorite contributor!
