Ummm, this is ok but I cannot really say I'm impressed with it. The cake is a sort of genoise but with baking powder. I may have overmixed the batter a bit and it came out, well, a little tough. Or was that intended because of all the liquids it would absorb? Anyway, my first try did not result in a soft cake. THe coconut taste is there, but not highly pronounced. My cake did not absorb the liquid very readily, but it had already cooled completely before I was able to do that. Overall, ok, but if I do this again I'll go looking for a different recipe. Good luck to you!

make sure you let it set in refrigerator after it's all complete for one more overnight.  It needs to gel, and meld flavors.
Excellent fresh and cold and flavorful.

Left out the coconut extract, because with all the coconut milk and coconut cream, I felt like it wasn't needed - and I was pleased with the result.
