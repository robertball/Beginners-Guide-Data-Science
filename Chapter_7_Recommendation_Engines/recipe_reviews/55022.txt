Fantastic recipe! I added a few extras for my version; fresh mint instead of dried, a dash of lemon juice, pinch of coarse pepper, kosher salt, and a tablespoon of curry. Skewered with red onion, zucchini and summer squash.

It seems there are as many ways to cook this as there are cooks!  I, too, added a little garlic and some sumac.  Because mint is in the garden right now I used that.  Guess I should dry some mint because we really liked this recipe and I will be making it again.  It was the first time I marinated meat in yogurt.  It was very good but the yogurt made it more difficult to determine when the meat was cooked as I usually use herbs and olive oil which browns up quickly.  Thanks for the recipe. I served it with basmati rice with Persian seasoning, tzatziki and pita.  Next time I will take your advice and grill some vegetables to round out the meal.

This is my family's all-time favorite thing for  dinner!  The yogurt tenderizes the meat.  **The longer this marinates, even up to 48 hours, the better it will taste.

Note to other reviews:  For best results you need to use fresh meat and the better the cut, the better the kabob.  

It is supposed to be messy when you skewer the meat, I goop what remains in the bowl on the meat before grilling.  The onion needs to be in tiny pieces for the best flavor.

well... the way we make kabobs is more flavorful. just yogurt and mint won't help. it is important to add a lot of different types of spices. cayenne pepper.. garlic, ginger, salt, pepper, (sometimes) turmeric,  and other spices of your choice. trust me, it will taste better with more spices.

I gave this 4 out of 5 stars simply because I wasn't sure what to do after marinating the meat - do I grill it with the yogurt dripping off, do I wipe off the yogurt, do I rinse off the yogurt?  I was unsure and rinsed off the yogurt.  The meat was very tender, and there was a slight tang to it from the yogurt.  I would make this again.

The yogurt made the beef so tender and the favor was tasty.  I thought it was easy to prepare and fast to cook.  I added tomatos, onions and mushrooms with the meat on the skewers. I served with rice. I will make this again and again!

The yogurt really didn't work to make the meat tender - even after 48 hours of marinating.  The onion was really overpowering.  We don't toss too many meals, but we did with this one.

These were quite good.  I marinated them for about 24 hours and they came out very tender.  Even guests who say they normally don't like grilled beef because it is too tough, complimented on them.  Next time I will definately add salt and pepper though, in my opinion they needed it but I will make these again. Thanks!

This is a very nice version of Persian "Barg" Kabob, I recommend hammering the meat firmly for a couple of minutes before marinating it, and do not rinse the marinade, shake it a bit before put it on the skewer.

The writer suggested a cucumber salad. I'm not certain what type of salad of cucumber, but i would like to add that a handful of crushed/pulverized garlic cloves mixed with plain yogurt and a cup of finely chopped cucumber is a very good side dish.

In all fairness we tweaked the recipe a lot. We used chicken instead of beef. We marinated overnight with ingredients other reviewers suggested like fresh mint, lemon juice, curry, garlic powder. Next time  we'll use fresh garlic, more lemon juice w/ zest and authentic greek yogurt. Good starting point. Will try again. Thanks. Servied with Alton Brown's Lentil salad. Yum!

These are good. I thought the chopped onion was a little distracting and messy while I threaded the skewers - next time I'll leave them in big chunks to flavor the marinade and thread them along with the meat. I had my meat in marinade for about 8 hours which was fine, but I think I'd do 24 if I planned it better. Thanks for the recipe!

This marinade is super delish.  Like another reviewer, I added some lemon juice and a tablespoon of curry powder.  I also used greek yogurt rather than regular - its thicker and stuck to the meat.  I just piled the rest of the yogurt mix on top of the meat as it grilled.  We used lamb (we don't eat beef).  Next time I'm going to try chicken.  Served with tzaziki, pita, and olives.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe! I added green peppers, cherry tomatoes, onion, and pineapple to the skewers as well (which yes, I know, aren't Persian but sure taste good!) Be sure to oil the grate on your grill first. Since there isn't any oil in the mixture my first batch stuck pretty badly. Use 2 bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 20 min first) side by side to keep the meat from spinning on the skewer.

I used this marinade for bone-in lamb pieces for barbecue.  I grated a vidallia onion instead of chopping, as I thought this would be more evenly distributed for a marinade.  I must say that this made for the most tenderizing marinade I have used for lamb, but I could not taste the mint at all.  As written, would perhaps lack a little flavor.  Would increase the mint by 1/2 tsp. and also add more garlic.  I also used kosher salt.  Thanks for the very tender marinade for my barbecued lamb.

The meat was so tender and juicy.  The only problem I had was that I wish there was more flavor.  Next time I will add some garlic or more spices.

Nice flavor, easy to prep, great for a nice dinner without heating up the kitchen. I used plain greek yogurt. I served this with pita bread, lettuce leaves, tzaziki sauce and a cool cucumber salad. My husband doesn't like mint though so the next time I am going to have to fine a suitable substitute for the dried mint leaves. Overall, this made a great meal. Thanks BaysChick!

This recipe can be modified in the following way:  Process 2 large white onions in a food processor and use the juice of the onion instead.  You can put onions in a china cap to squeeze the juice out.  Also you need to add the juice of 4 fresh limes.  Fresh Ground Black Pepper and some Kosher salt is also needed.  Finally, reduce the amount of yogurt you are using to about 2 TB.

I did not care for this recipe at all. A friend liked it very much.  I guess it is just personal taste. We don't do a lot of mint things in my house so that might be it.  I will say it was fun to make and thread onto the skewers and of course, almost anything on a skewer tastes good LOL

These were okay, but I think I was expecting a little more.  I prefer the Persian Shish Kabob recipe on this site to this one.

I followed the recipe as written and marinated the sirloin cubes for about 24 hours. The meat was not overcooked (still pink in the center)but it was dry, tough and tasteless. To be fair, the meat had been frozen so perhaps that contributed to the toughness.

I marinaded these overnight, and thought they were actually pretty flavorful. I also added wedges of red onion and green pepper to the skewers, and grilled them outdoors. We had them in a pita with shredded lettuce, and drizzled with some of the mint/yogurt marinade (reserved from the original batch). Good stuff. Thanks!

Not Bad.  Expected more taste.  Marinate over night for tenderness.

The marinade makes the meat super tender and delicious.  I added Vidalia onions and cherry tomatoes to my kabobs, which were great.
