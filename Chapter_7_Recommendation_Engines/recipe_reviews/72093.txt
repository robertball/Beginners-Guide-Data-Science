I believe if you are going to rate a recipe you need to make THE recipe. That said I made this exactly as stated with the exception of the mushrooms (alergic). It was fairly to very good as written. However the next time I make it I would change the following: probably 1/2 of the cayenne pepper as it was pretty spicy. Since the spices go in last the vegetables were highly seasoned and the chicken was just plain chicken so I will try rubbing the spices on the chicken before browning to spice it up a bit and tone down the veggies at the same time. Finally it may just be the temp. I cooked at but there was LOTS of liquid left when everything else was cooked so I will try cutting the amount in 1/2 and see how that works. All in all a great recipe that just needs tweaked slightly.

I wouldn't call it the ultimate, but I do appreicate the recipe.  I made a few adjustments after reading the reviews and it came out perfect for me.  I chopped the chicken and brown and I also sauteed the vegetables and took it off the heat.  I brought my potatoes to a boil in beef broth(the recommended amount).  When it started to boil, I added all the seasonings and let it boil for 10 minutes uncovered).  Then I added the chicken and the veggies stirred, brought to a boil, then covered and simmered for 20 minutes.  This should work.  It was like stew instead of watery.  Since the liquid had a chance to evaporate when boiling the potatoes.  I hope that this helps.

Very delicious. Instead of cooking everything in a skillet I actually just threw everything into a slow cooker and it turned out amazing. What an easy recipe! Thanks much for sharing!

All though this did make a good dinner I would not say it was the ultimate all in one chicken dinner. This is a quick fix meal. There is nothing wonderful about it. It tasted good and filled us up.

I will say that it's pretty easy to make and it's nice that it's just a one pan dish. However I was really disappointed. I got excited at first because the sauteed vegetables looked really good. But once you simmer it it just tastes like canned green beans. I really hate the taste of canned green beans. I thought it would be OK mixed in but it's not. I added a ton of garlic salt and that made it edible but I didn't like it. Even my 13 month old daughter refused to eat it. It might be OK with frozen beans. And it is soupy like everyone said but it kind of has to be in order to cook the potatoes I think.

GREAT RECIPE WITH A A COUPLE OF CHANGES THAT YOU REALLY DO NOT HAVE TO DO. IT IS FINE JUST THE WAY IT IS. I DID USE LESS OF THE CHICKEN BROTH BUT ADDED WHITE WINE (A GOOD HALF A CUP ). I USED RED POTATOES. I DID WHAT ANOTHER REVIEWER SAID AND RUBBED THE SEASONINGS ONTO THE CHICKEN BEFORE BROWNING. AFTER PLACING EVERYTHING BACK INTO THE PAN I ADDED OLD BAY SEASONING. I HAD SOME FROZEN GREEN BEANS THAT WE HAD THE NIGHT BEFORE SO I USED THEM IN PLACE OF CANNED (DO NOT USED CANNED VEGEIES). THIS RECIPE WILL ACCEPT OTHER KINDS OF VEGIES USE YOUR IMAGINATION (CARROTS ARTICHOKE HEARTS...EVEN OLIVES).WHEN MY HUSBAND COMPLIMENTS A MEAL YOU KNOW THAT IT IS GOOD...AND HE DID!

Awesome! only i changed a few things; we hate mushrooms so i nixed those substituted veg oil for olive oil margarine for more olive oil used only half the onion thinly sliced bell peppers thinly sliced celery thinly sliced potatoes not cubed but sliced into quarter inch ovals we did not add the chicken into the dish (instead i cooked the potatoes in the oil with the onions and celery and bells and added minced garlic) nor did we add green beans we did add fresh broccolli after the potatoes were almost done also sub chicken broth for veg and topped with cheese to make this an amazing vegitarian side dish

Really simple easy and delicious recipe! I had no chicken breast so substituted it with minced beef which was all I had in my fridge and also added leeks instead of celery used fresh beans instead of canned ones and also added carrots for some color. The end result was very satisfying (we ate it with mixed grain rice)!

I've made this several times and it is an easy one pot meal. It's also one of those great recipes that's better leftover and since it makes a lot we always have the next day's lunch ready to go. I usually have prepped frozen onion and green peppers as well as prepackaged frozen potato dices (2 lb. size)so it's even faster if there's no prep time. I think it is a little bland but it is a simple matter to increase the seasonings to your taste. It's definitely in my regular menu rotation.

Fairly easy to make: clean as you go type dish which is always a bonus; Followed the recipe pretty closely but next time will substitute some veggies for others. It seems this dish lends itself well to cooking what's in season. Will definitely put this into my dinner rotation!

I didn't have a pepper so substituted with a few carrots. I wouldn't call it an Ultimate Chicken dinner. It's more of a chicken veggie stew. Served mine with rice. Mmmm

A relatively easy dish to put together. I made it in a tagine and it left me with a lot of juice. Thank you for the recipe.

Overall very good. Next time I will try half of the liquid since it was very soupy and less cayene when making for my family because it was too spicy for the kids.

The picture shows the chicken cut up but the recipe does not mention cutting up the chicken. I cut it up because I thought it should be. However folks learning to cook would be confused. Good dish

The photo shows carrots, but they are not listed in the ingredients.  Next time I will add carrots.  I think rotisserie chicken shredded would taste better and cut down on the prep time.  I added two cans of chicken broth instead of one and twice the seasonings that it called for.
