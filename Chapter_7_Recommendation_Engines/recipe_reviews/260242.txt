Excellent! I didn't have the raspberries, so I used a package of frozen blueberries. But it tasted great anyways. I'm definitely making this with the right fruit again.

I made the green smoothie first - it was tasty, but I will omit the kiwi next time - the seeds were ground up finely, but made it kind of grainy. I left out the pear, but will replace the kiwi with that. Lightly sweet (I added 1 Tbsp honey rather than 3).

Made the red smoothie just like the recipe. Delicious! Yes, I will make it again.
