This is a great recipe.  I made this for my husbands office Christmas lunch.  Everyone loved it and it made enough for the entire crew.  It is easy to do and the ingredients are easy to find.  This is a keeper.

Delicious! I scaled this down to make one roll. I also had some green pepper to use up, so I cooked that w/ the ground beef. Nice combo of flavors and VERY filling...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

What a delicious recipe! Although my presentation was shorty the recipe was spot on!  I ended up using Ragu's pizza sauce, hard peppered salami, a peppered deli ham, and 2 pilsbury classic pizza crust dough. I certainly did not need the number of servings so I scaled it down, but it still made quite a bit. One thing I failed to do was make individual Strombolis which I will section the dough out next time and do:)

I made this but reduced just for 8 servings and added bacon.  Bacon goes on everything! Very tasty and very easy! Will make again but might change ingredients around some.

I dubbed my husband in charge of dinner on his Monday off  & he amazed us with this magnificence. This recipe is super flavorful & meaty & filling. While family loved it. hubby used French bread on one & pizza dough for the 2nd stronghold. The French bread got a crispier crust on it which I liked better than the sweetness of the pizza dough version. BONUS Made the house smell like a pizza place

I used a homemade dough to make this. Left out the ham and swapped some of the cheeses but it was fairly good, my boys enjoyed their slices with a bit of spicy mayo.

Yum!  This is a very filling recipe. I scaled it down to make one, which will feed my husband and me at least twice.  I had no idea where frozen dough was in my grocery store, so that took forever to find, but once I finally got it home, it was really easy to work with.  The only changes to the recipe I made were to add onion and garlic to the ground beef when cooking, besides that, I kept it exactly as detailed. Rolling the Stromboli was easy as I kept the ingredients in the middle and more folded over the dough, tucking one side underneath.  The moving of it to my baking sheet was little precarious. I somehow managed with two large spatulas and luck.  Also, make sure to cut vent holes on the top.  I'll definitely make this again!

The concept is good and im sure it tastes great, however, trying to roll it with everything staying inside is a feat that is next to impossible.  If you do as the instructions say and roll the dough into a 12x15 rectangle on a greased baking sheet, it will be too thin and not stay together.  Try putting it on wax paper and use that to roll it.  With all the holes in it I could not bake it as a stromboli, so I tried unrolling it to salvage it into a pizza.

My husband LOVED this.   He had been after me to make Stromboli ever since we went to a friend's house where she served it.  Well, this is THE recipe.  The only thing I had a problem with was finding the bread dough.  So I improved and used Crescent Roll mix.  It turned out great!

With all the cheese and pepperoni and salami, this was waaaaaay too greasy for my taste.  Frankly, it was rather bland beyond the grease.
