I made this for dinner tonight, turned out great. As for the dreaded modifications; I did cut the butter to 1/2 cup cause we were short on it, and added a whole onion, probably 1 1/3 cups, cause I like onion.  Also added a diced potato to sub for some of the celery and carrot which turned out to be a nice addition.  I used a basic oil/water/flour pie crust. My only minor complaint was it was a little runny, next time I will cut bigger slits in the top crust and bake it a little longer.  Overall the flavor was very good, and I especially liked that there was no canned cream of "whatever" involved.  Will definitely make this again.

Awesome Recipe! So quick and easy but since I had time I changed a few things up. I chopped fresh carrots but used frozen peas. Instead of chopped onion I used pearl onions and instead of green beans I used corn. I melted the butter and sauteed the celery, carrot, garlic and onion along with bay, thyme, sage, parsley, a tsp of tumeric for color, and the rest of the ingredients but I omitted the italian seasoning and onion powder. When I dumped in the flour I let it brown a bit before adding the milk and chicken stock. I added the thawed veggies, I just ran them under cold water and strained them. I used some pulled turkey I had frozen from thanks giving and it came out awesome!!! Thanks!

For extra flavour and to preserve nutrients, simmer the vegetables in the broth instead of water. Of course, you don't discard the broth, you just whisk broth and vegetables into your onion and flour mixture:)

This was fantastic! So easy and quick to make. I used a bag of mixed veggies (corn, peas, carrots, greenbeans, lima beans) and everything else was per the recipe. Delicious. My whole family loved it and my Hubby ate seconds. Will definitely make this again!

Great recipe! I made it pretty much exactly as written, except that I didn't have a frozen pea/carrot mix, so I used 1 cup of fresh diced carrots and 1 cup of frozen peas. I also used only a top crust on the pie; a double crust would have been way to rich for me and my family! The filling was awesome, very rich, buttery, creamy, and filling, with just the right amount of veggies and turkey. It was so nice and thick as well...a lot of pot pie recipes out there are to thin for my taste! My family really enjoyed this, and I'd make it again. Thanks for sharing the recipe!!!

I followed this recipe almost exactly and was extremely happy with the result. My only modifications were that I made 4 individual pot pies (10oz. ramekins) as opposed to one big pot pie (9"). And my only comment to the negative is that the filling was a bit too thick. I like to be able to dip my crust in my filling and it was a bit difficult. Next time (and there will be a next time) I'll either use less flour, or more milk. I'll let you know which it is.

This was awesome.  I'm newly married and I like to try new recipes. Everyone loved it. My mom went back for 2nds!! I use fresh veggies & add cubed potatoes and leave out the bottom crust to lighten it up. Since we have a small family, we froze one of the pies & it cooked up fine. I put it in the fridge to thaw for one day and cooked as normal. I also brush it with an egg wash.  This recipe is tops!!

Kudos to Dad!! This was so tasty, warm and filling for a frosty Fall eve. I was only going to make one pie, but found I had the perfect amt of turkey for two. I used one pkg(16 Oz) frozen mixed veggies that had peas, corn, carrots and green beans....came out to the 4c called for. The filling had enough body to it, not too thick nor runny. (someone suggested a Can of soup substitute....No Way!) I omitted the celery seed, had none, and used one beryl Lg onion. My hubby and I agreed it was the Best either of us has ever had, and we both are pretty good cooks.
Yes, I "cheated" and used the Pillsbury refrigerated crusts....so much easier. This one ended my search for The Perfect Turkey Pot Pie.....this is IT! Thank you Dad and Allrecipes! Love this site!!

This is by far the best pot pie I have ever made. I could never get the correct amount of liquid - either too runny or too solid. This is perfect and the seasoning it great. Thank you for posting this recipe!

I really liked this recipe except rather than using italian seasoning since it really doesn't suit this recipe I swapped it for poultry seasoning and sauteed the onions and celery with a few bay leaves, it gave it great flavor!!!!!!! I did not use the celery seed because I sauteed the celery with the onions so the flavor turned out just fine. I did add a little milk to it because it was a little thick at first and put in a teaspoon of Better than boullion chicken base to give the broth a little more flavor  .. all in all this is a nice recipe ;)

This was a delicious recipe for that leftover turkey.  I was lazy and topped ours with mashed potatoes (I am incapable of producing a 'pretty' pie), but I am sure the pie crust would have been terrific.  There's a nice combination of vegetables here, but I think this is one you could play with a little based on what you have on hand.  This is my new base recipe for pot pie.

This the second turkey pot pie recipe I've tried from allrecipes and it is hands down the best. I'm stopping right here. I didn't make any changes other than using entirely frozen peas, carrots and green beans mix and it came out perfect. Everyone LOVED it. A keeper for sure!!!

Made with Thanksgiving leftovers, this pie is divine!  I followed the recipe exactly, pulled out my trusty 11" deep dish pie plate, and prepared to use my favorite Pillsbury pie crusts.  OOPS, I was out!  Pulled out my baking mix and whipped up a crust using biscuit dough.  I poured the filling into the pie plate, topped it with the biscuit crust and cooked it at 425 for about 20 minutes.  My husband and son each had two huge helpings and my husband took the last helping to work for lunch!  I've never seen that pie plate empty, but it certainly was after I made this!  A couple of changes I would make, though:  1) Add the celery in when you're sauteing the onions with the butter.  My celery was way too crunchy.  2) I used a 10-oz bag of frozen peas, green beans, corn and carrots.  It worked perfectly!  Happy eating and thank the Lord for leftover turkey!!

I just finished my first slice of this. OMG it is rich and yummy. My teenage daughter loved it. For the crust I made the Flaky Pie crust that is found here on the web site. The other thing I did was made my own turkey stock and used that in this recipe. This is now a keeper recipe in our family cookbook. I can not recommend it enough!

I found this after Thanksgiving last year when trying to use up our leftover turkey...we loved it so much it has become a regular dish in our house using rotiserie chicken from Costco (they used to use them in their pot pies but started making them with premade chicken strips and we didn't like it as much.) We prefer to just use fresh carrots, celery and onions for our veggies so I just adjusted the amounts and add garlic and some dill weed. I had never attempted pot pie before this but the basics were so simple it was easy to build off of and literally comes out so delicious! I have 6 kids ages 2-13 and I know when I make this there will be no complaints...only clean plates!

Decided to make this tonight to use up leftover Turkey. It was Awesome!  I used "Steamers" frozen mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, carrots and peas in one package) instead of buying two separate  bags of veggies. As with some other reviewers, my sauce thickened up a little too much when it started to bubble so I added about 1/4 cup more chicken stock. Also, I tasted after stirring in the spices and it was Ok but I didn't have any celery salt and thought it needed something so I substituted Garlic Salt then decided to add a little fresh grated parmesan. That really took it to the next level. Yum! Will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing Rob.

I simmer the turkey bones with carrots, celery, onion, and garlic in 2 cans of low sodium chicken broth and water for about 1 hour, strain. I use this instead of the chicken broth. I make several pies with the left over turkey meat. We have one for dinner and I freeze the others so we can enjoy them throughout the year. I also have add any left over veggies, gravy, and have added some leftover stuffing.

Excellent Pie! I used the Pie Crust IV Recipe from this website, and it turned out very well.
I now use the sauce of this turkey pot pie as a "base" for other pot pies, I just change the spices and vegetables, and each pie has so far been a huge success.
Thank you for sharing this nice recipe!

This was awesome!  I followed it almost exactly.  I made my crusts from scratch.  I only made enough for one pot pie in my casserole dish.  I didn't have green beans or celery - I used peas and some other veggies and added lots of savory seasoning as well.  I got the perfect compliment from my husband.  "This was the absolute best meal you've ever made!"  I was swooning :)  I cook often, but this just hit the target perfectly.  Thank you!!!

My back was really hurting, and I couldn't stand up for very long. I used 2 cans of mixed veggies to make this, and the broth from my roasted turkey. Added garlic powder, and used onion flakes. It still turned out beautifully. Thank you for this very forgiving recipe.

I liked the sound of this, just minor changes. used fresh Carrots and added potatoes that I boiled for 15 minutes before so there not to soft or to hard. Then I used Phyllo dough and cooked in a ramekins. Ummmm is all I can say

As written, the pies are bland however the consistency was right on.  There was no liquid in the filling at all.  I modified as follows:  2 Yukon gold potatoes ,diced in bite size chunks and added to the veggies after they were cooked.  I cooked the veggies in the broth as others suggested and saved the broth for the sauce.  I also added some fresh carrots to the veggies to give the pie some more mass and texture.  Lastly, i let the butter, onion and flour mix cookmfor 5 more minutes to help brown the mixture before adding thenstock and milk. 

One pie served 6 people and the sides were a green salad and a green vegetable.  The family said it was a 5 star recipe with my modifications.  They really liked how packed the filling was with veggies and meat and that the filling stood up by itself and nothing ran outside of the pie shaped slices I served.

This was very, very good! For those saying it was too thick... it's supposed to be! Spices were perfect! Thanks for a great recipe that I'll keep going back to! I did saute my vegies (12 oz frozen mix) with the onion and celery like another suggested... simple and so tasty!

I made this recipe the first time almost exactly as written. It was amazing. My husband ate almost half the darn pie himself. It is now his most favorite thing I ever made, and I have three of this pie in the oven as we speak. Only difference this time; chicken. So dang delicious.

This pot pie is indescribably delicious. Followed recipe to the letter. It is my new favorite company dish.  I'm making my second one today, this time with homemade crust -- buttermilk crust from this site.  I have friends who are traveling out of the counry for three weeks.  I'm going to make this pie for them so upon their return they can have a homemade comfort food ready to pop in the oven.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.

I enjoyed this pot pie. I've tried other recipes in the past and they're always too runny. I followed the recipe for the "gravy" exactly and will use less pepper next time (personal taste). I did add the veggies that my family liked, including potato. Overall a good recipe.

Often times, the METHOD is more important than the ingredients.  I didn't have all the ingredients this recipe calls for, so I substituted fresh veggies that I had to use up.  Thanks to the method of this recipe, my attempt was VERY successful!  My family loved it!  Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe!

Delicious! I omitted the onion powder and celery seed, as the real deal already added loads of flavor. I also prefer seasoning with thyme, sage and marjoram instead of Italian seasonings.

We used leftover turkey and followed other reviewers who sauteed the veggies. We used a small onion, and added a small potato and a couple of mushrooms.  We skipped the green beans, celery seed and the onion powder since we did not have any at hand but used fresh rosemary and thyme in addition to the Italian Seasoning. The only thing we would also add next time is a bit of garlic and a little bit more pepper. 

For the crust we used the recipe from this website called "Pie Crust IV"

SO GOOD!!! will make again and again!

Fantastic!
After all of our overindulgences over Thanksgiving, this was a nice follow-up. I used skim milk, so cut back some calories. I also used ramekins to make the recipe without pie crust... only adding crust on top. 
Yummy!

BEST POT PIE RECIPE EVER!! I've been searching for that one special pot pie/comfort food recipe and I finally found "the one". My only regret when making this tonight was that I only had one pie crust, otherwise, I would have made it by the vat! 
I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I didn't have celery seed so I used some parsely flakes instead. Not sure if this helped or hindered but I loved it anyway! 
I really appreciated that it wasn't a can of soup mixed with some veggies, but rather ingredients I always have on hand (except for the pie crusts). 
I'm not one to mess with perfection, but in a bind I might try making my own crust if I don't happen to have the frozen kind. 
Thanks for an awesome recipe Rob N.! You gave me the perfect recipe for one of my all-time favorite comfort foods!

This was an excellent pot pie!!! I have made several different ones and the fillings are usually do heavy or not seasoned enough. We thought this was perfect! My son had 3 helpings and we all went back for seconds. The recipes yields two pies, so I just cut it in half. I usually make my own crusts, but tonight used the Pillsbury Pie Crusts in the refrigerated section. Much easier then a frozen crust.  Worked fantastic!!

Easy pot pie recipe, I did cut the butter to 1/2 cup and sauteed the celery with the onion for a crunchier celery. It was a great recipe and other than the picky eaters we loved it!

Turned out Perfect!  Wasn't runny at all.  When I added the flour I let it cook a bit before adding the liquid.  It was like a thick gravy even after adding all the liquid.  Used what I had on hand:  12 oz bag of mixed veggies still frozen (peas, carrots, green beans, corn), no celery, leftover chicken.  Had to cover the edges with foil.  Looking forward to making again!

Very, very good!  Since I've been cooking for 40 years I knew not to discard the water from the veggies... I used frozen and added them to the milk and broth to heat them through.  I bake mine (as I do ALL pies) at 425 for 15 minutes, then turn the oven down (without opening the door)to 350 and cooking another 30 minutes.  Pies are always evenly baked and never burned or too overdone or underdone.

Simply Amazing!  My boyfriend doesn't even really like turkey that much and we ate 1/2 the pie for dinner.  I followed the recipe exactly except I only made one pie as there are only two of us, and I used celery salt as I didn't have any celery seed and only usd 1/4 tsp.  I couldn't believe how quickly the flour/butter/chix broth/milk mixture thickened.  This pot pie was simply amazing.  I will NOT be buying frozen pot pies ever again.  Thanks for a delicious and easy recipe! I was happy to use up my Thanksgiving turkey, extra chicken broth, and pie crusts on such a delicious dinner.

I loved this recipe. No canned soup involved which I liked very much. I should have increased the liquid as I think when reheated, it could use more. The liquid really gets absorbed after being refrigerated but still very, very good. I made some extra gravy to moisten it after reheating it. This is definitely a keeper.

I made a "few" changes to use up more of our Christmas dinner leftovers. I cooked the veggies in veggie broth instead of water drained a bit of it into my mashed potatoes and the rest I used instead of the chicken broth. I stirred in my leftover gravy into the sautéd onions instead of using flour as my gravy was quite thick. As another reviewer suggested, I replaced the pie-crust with mashed potatoes. It was actually quite pretty with the ribbons of white potatoes and sweet potatoes on the top. I sprinkled paprika on top for the finishing touch. Baked it uncovered for 40 minutes at 350°. A great way to use up all the leftovers. So delicious!

I hve to agree with another reviewer.  The thing tht really makes this recipe outstanding is the method.  Sure, there are other recipes out there that might be easier and not take as much time, but it is well worth it!

We really like a lot of vegetables.  I added about a cup of cubed potatoes, another cup of sweet potatoes, corn, peas, carrots, celery, green beans...  I also didn't have any celery seed, so I simply chopped up the celery leaves very fine and added them into the whole mixture.  That certainly did the trick!

I freeze my leftover turkey in chicken broth.  This was the perfect way to use up that turkey!  I ended up with so much filling, due to the added veggies that I made my pot pie in my large corningware oval dish.  Yum, yum, yum!  Great job on the recipe and the easy to follow instructions!

Looking for recipe today for leftover turkey breast and had all these ingredients on hand so made it for dinner tonite.  AWESOME!  I've made other pot pies and none compare to this one.  I did scale the recipe down to one pie (six servings), and it was perfect.  Omitted the Italian seasoning and substituted a sprinkle of thyme, used thawed mixed veggies, to which I added the celery and chopped onion and sauteed in butter. The other seasonings right on target and consistency of the filling was not runny nor too thick.  Definitely making again 'cause its a keeper!

I have made this several times since this past Thanksgiving and have had nothing but positive compliments!  Everyone that tries these pies LOVES them and it's such an easy recipe.  I love that it makes 2 huge pies also.  I follow the recipe to the tee pretty much.  I use chicken for the most part but used left-over turkey from Thanksgiving the first time I tried this. Either way, it's fabulous!

I made this recipe as written twice and it was a huge hit both times.  I had no problems with the thickness of the filling; just make sure you simmer after adding the flour until the mixture thickens as instructed.

I used fresh carrots and beans and added fresh chopped mushroom to the sauteing onion. The final consistency was just right and the taste was even better. Thanks, "Dad". I'm interested in whether my pot-pie hating wife eats it ;-) I think she will.

This is a great recipe and I modified with great results.  I substituted a little olive oil in place of the butter and I only used a top crust made with vegetable oil instead of shortening.  I also used sodium free chicken broth.  All of this decreased the fat and calories.  Excellent and will definitely make again.

I've made this twice since Thanksgiving. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. It was VERY good. A bit dry. The second time I made it, I used chicken and 2 cans of veg-all since this was an after work rush dinner and didn't want to take the time to cut the veggies. I also doubled the gravy and reserved half and served it on the side.  I think the chicken was prefered in my house over the turkey but it may be personal taste.

Excellent flavor! The sauce was entirely too thick- browned the roux a little longer, then added more broth and milk, then added a little white wine. Did not use Italian seasoning- instead added more onion, sage, fresh thyme. Baked the bottom crust for 10 minutes before adding the filling. Was even better reheated the next day! Yummy!

Made this and it was absolutely delicious!  Changed from the pie crust to using a puff pastry for one of the pies & it was also wonderful.  Will definitely make this one again & again!

Awesome recipe, thank you! I made a few minor changes based on the ingredients I had available. I used 4 cups mixed vegetables that come frozen together. I also used celery salt instead of celery seed and cut the regular salt by 1/2 tsp. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly with wonderful results. Next time I may try and cut down on the butter a little bit, but I definitely will be making this again!

This was the most amazing pot pie I have ever tasted!  It was so delicious and tender.  I was always afraid of making one because I thought all the stuff would run out but it all stayed together so nice.  I will be making this again and again!  Hope you enjoy it and thanks Dad!

Prepared this dish for dinner today.  My husband is not fond of turkey, but really liked this pie.  I thought it was very good and easy to prepare.  I did not add the green beans as I did not have any.  Used corn as a substitute.  I plan to take the extra pie to my adult grandsons.  They'll devour it.

I made this last night--it was super easy and MUCH tastier than the frozen pot pies you get at the store. I used a mix of cubed white meat turkey and shredded turkey leftover from boiling the turkey carcass. It's super flavorful!

We made this last night as written except we substituted corn for the green beans.  It was so easy and very, very good.  I think I would have liked the inside to be a bit thinner and would use more chicken broth or milk next time.  My husband and son felt it perfect just the way it was.  We will definitely be making this pot pie again.  Thanks for sharing Rob!

Outstanding flavor, and easy to make. The pies held up well in the oven, and were firm rather than juicy. I substituted celery salt for celery seed + salt, and substituted thyme for Italian seasoning. Good recipe!

Made this last night! It rocked! I made a few changes...I sauteed the celery with the onion and a little garlic, substituted corn for the green beans, and increased the amount of veggies a bit. Family approved recipe! Love it!

5 star recipe- I make this all the time with leftover chicken!! The kids love this recipe!! I vary my vegtables on what I have at home. 
Usually add frozen peas and corn, and fresh carrots and celery.

This is by far the best turkey pot pie recipe I have ever made. My kids keep asking me to make it so now that Easter is right around the corner we are making a turkey for Easter so we can have the leftovers for this pie. I did not make any changes to the recipe it was perfect as is.

Recipe is great as is, only omitted onion. Followed as written...I make this every few weeks with chicken, now that I have no turkey left over... While it does make 2 and I've done that and freeze one, I usually make in a 9x13 to have several meals at once.

Really enjoyed this.  It was perfect for all of the leftovers and tasted great.  The only thing I did differently was not add the Italian seasoning because I did not have any.  Thanks for sharing.

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half and used only a top crust to cut some calories.  Will definitely make my favorite recipe list!

We loved this recipe!! I have been looking for a pot pie recipe like this with wonderful flavor and just the perfect creaminess.  As another reviewer mentioned, using a roasted deli chicken would be great too. Thank you for sharing

Good recipe. I like that it didn't call for any cream of ____ soups.  I would have preferred the filling to be a little more saucy.

The only change I made was to cut the recipe in half and used canned instead of frozen veggies.  Very, very good. Would make again.  A nice diversion from cream of anything soup.

I'm not sure where I got this recipe, but it is just awesome.  Unfortunately using piecrust makes it high in calories.  I do make it now and then, but not to often.  Truly not low calorie.

The recipe had good consistency and it was alright, but it calls for way too much pepper.  So much pepper that it actually ruined the taste of the pot pie.

This recipe earned 5+ stars.  I  added potatoes instead of green  beans, personal preference. Other than that I follwed the recipe as is.  The pie wasn't too rich. The seasonings were well balanced. It definitely wasn't bland.  My guinea pigs were a 5, 6, and 7 year old... along with a picky anti pot pie eating  husband. I talked him into tasting the filling. He said, "Wow, I guess I'll be eating that instead of frozen pizza."  Great recipe.

I made this with our leftover Turkey from Thanksgiving.  I didn't change any on the recipe, only thing I did different was make in a 7 x 11 baking dish.  It came our perfect and the family LOVED it.

this recipe was awesome!!! the only thing I did differently was added more turkey to it because I was trying to finish up my left over thanksgiving turkey...I also took another reviewers advice and cooked my veggies in the chicken stock and then reused the stock later for my filling...I am going to make this again, I love recipes that allows me to cook a bunch so I can freeze some for later...Thanks for this great recipe...

Fabulous!  Halved the recipe to just make one pie for two people. Used canned  vegetables instead of frozen and added some fresh carrot but didn't change anything else and it was the best I've ever had.

Exactly how a potpie should taste like.  No bells and whistles here.  Just warm, comforting, simple food. Great use for all that leftover turkey, 2 pies are made for under 20bucks, feeds like 10 people

I skipped the green beans and substituted more peas/carrots.  Came out quite well.  It is pretty thick, so if you prefer a thinner filling, add more milk and/or less flour.

When cooking for my dad, who sticks to a very low sodium diet, I found this recipe to be a big winner.    I left out the salt, used no salt chicken broth, and exchanged the italian seasoning for poultry seasoning.    It is was fabulous!   No one would ever guess that it was lower sodium.

By far the best pot pie we've ever had.  Changes I made, for personal preference only, were used 1 cup each of carrots, corn, green beans and peas, omitted the celery because we don't like it.  Added 2 cups diced potatoes and used celery salt instead of celery seed.

I LOVE this recipe! I do add a little of Westchestershire sauce. I make the filling with either chicken or turkey and freeze part.  At any time I just have to defrost and pour onto pie crust, bake and listo! My family and friends love it too.  Delicioso! Gracias.

This is my first review after several years on this site.  In my opinion, I can only rate a recipe after making it a few times.  I have now made this about ten times, and it is amazing.  Each and every time, it is delicious.  I've used it with leftover roast turkey and roast chicken.  I've also used canned chicken.  It really is worth the try!  I keep a handwritten recipe book where only truly time-tested recipes are entered - and this one has made it into the book.

I will definitely make this again! I used chicken instead of turkey cause that's what we had...also used fresh carrots instead of frozen and added minced garlic to the onions. I only had one store bought crust so I didn't have a crust on top, just folded the edges up....worked out fine! thought it was tasty.

Absolutely  Delicious!  Can't wait for the Christmas Turkey if for no other reason than to make this recipe again!.  I followed it pretty much to the "T" except I had no onion powder so I used closer to a cup of chopped onion and I added diced Yukon Gold Potatoes.  next time will probably add mushrooms as well.  you can really add or omit any veggies/meat in this as the real star of the show is the sauce.  This held together well and was creamy and just down right Yummy!  I made the full recipe but only made one pie.  I'm freezing the filling for another pie I will make at a later date since my family didn't need 2 pies right now and I didn't want to put it together only to have a soggy crust when thawed and baked.  will update this review once I've thawed and used the extra filling to let you know how it worked.

Cut the recipe in 1/2 and only made 1 pie.  Should have made 2!  This turned out very good.  Used mixed veggies and had to add a bit more broth and some additional spices to suit our tastes.  Everyone liked it!  A great way to use up leftover turkey, chicken and maybe even ham?

Absolutely loved this recipe.  It makes a lot and I expected it would be around at least a few days.  Boy was I wrong!  My husband and daughter did not want to eat anything else until this was all gone.  I did this close to the recipe. I couldn't find all the vegetable in seperate bags, so I bought one big bag with all the vegetables in it.  So the amounts might be slightly off.  All in all a great and filling dish.

When I was a kid, my mother served us Swanson pot pies.  We thought those were good.  This recipe is out of sight.

We really enjoyed this. I add potatoes and cut back on the green beans, I also only put a top crust on the pie.

I used poultry seasoning instead of Italian seasoning.  It was delicious and my husband actually took the left overs to work.  That NEVER happens.

I made two of these today for a party. They were a huge hit, raves from all that ate some. Very easy to make and great to eat. What more could a man ask for. Will definately make it again. OUTSTANDING!!! Highly recommended for leftover chicken or turkey. Thanks, John O.

This is by far the BEST pot pie recipe I have made. I love that it makes two pies, it perfect to freeze one or eat the next day as leftovers. This recipe is so simple and yet so very flavorful. I used one 16oz bag of frozen veggies and half of a white onion. I am not going to lie I was very skeptical about the Italian seasoning but it gave the pie so much flavor! Can't wait to make it with chicken for a quick week night dinner!

I will never hate turkey leftovers again. This pie turned out PERFECT especially with my homemade crust (which I did for the first time, Martha Stewart receipe).  The celery seed really adds that classic layer in flavor.  I will make this again and again.

AMAZING! I followed to the letter, except I added 1 cup diced potatoes instead of 1 cup mixed veges. I used all frozen mixed veges instead of the green beans separate. I also added chopped garlic. This will make it into my treasured family recipes. Thank you!

Very good.  Added potatoes, because I always put potatoes in my chicken pot pies. (Used chicken instead of turkey.) Made 2 pies, with only top crust. Was out of a few of the seasonings, so added some lemon pepper seasoning, and basil. Both pies overflowed and created quite a mess in the oven, so next time I won't make them quite so full.

I baked this in a deep dish quiche dish because I had roasted a 22-pound turkey on "the" day and had a big bag of leftovers.  My husband practically ate the whole thing himself!  The spices were perfect, it used up all our leftover turkey once we tired of sandwiches (never saw THAT coming!) and it was a wonderful, delectable dish!  Definitely not too dry or too soggy ... it was perfect.  Wish I could give it SIX stars!

I only used this recipe for the the filling and used another recipe on this site for the crust (Grandma Carlson's Turkey Pot Pie) as I never use pre-made refridgerator crusts.  This filling's flavor is great!  I added some minced garlic and oregano/sweet basil for the Italian seasoning.  I wanted to add potatoes as the other reviewers suggested, but I forgot, it didn't seem to need it to be very tasty!  I also thawed the frozen vegetables under warm tap water and sauteed all vegetables together in the saucepan.  I also added fresh mushrooms to the saute.  I found the volume of filling a bit shy even though I had added more broth and milk to the saucepan.  In the future, I think I would add even more to have more sauce.  This is a good one!

Used this recipe as a base and altered using real turkey gravy, fresh pressed garlic, and a thin layer of smashed potatoes under top crust. 
I really enjoy the turkey over chicken. Good stuff.

This is what pot pies should taste like!  My son who doesn't like onions asked me if there were onions in it and I said a little bit but I got him to try it anyway. HE said it was delicious!  It is the best pot pie I've ever had.  I followed the recipe except I was out of celery seeds so that was omitted.  I may try it again with just one crust to reduce the carbs because my husband is a diabetic. Thank-you for a great recipe!  I have been passing it around to my friends at Curves and at work.

Very tasty way to use up leftover Thanksgiving turkey! I cut the recipe in half to make only one pot pie. I had about 1/2 cup of homemade gravy left so I threw that in with it too. Used a package of frozen peas, carrots, green beans and corn and it worked perfect. Added a bit of poultry seasoning and garlic powder too for more flavor. Highly recommend!!

This was very good but rather than going thru all of the work of making the ingredients, use a can of Campbells Cream of whatever soup.  That's what these ingredients make.

The only modification I made to this recipe was that I didn't add Onion powder, simply because I was out, and it turned out wondeful. At first I thought I made too much for my group of 5 but they ate every bit. The kids and the adults loved it! I'm sure it will work just as well with chicken or beef. Definately a keeper and I will make it again!

This is the best pot pie I have ever had!!!  I didn't change a thing.  I made a single pie today and put the other half of the filling in the freezer for later.  No chance of freezer burn, it won't be in there very long.

I used up some left-over turkey with this recipe.  I made an oil crust.  While I was making both dishes, I accidentally put the celery seed in the pie crust dry ingredients; it added an extra touch :)

I had no frozen beans, and I added a diced potato.  I also had no Italian seasoning, so I added poultry seasoning, tossed in some truffle salt, and then stirred in some saffron threads.  It tastes great.  Hope my dinner guests like it!

This was excellent!  And it is still good as left overs!  I baked it in the "Buttermilk Pie Crust" (by HoneyBee) that I also got from the recipe site.  Very tasty and filling!  I did not have frozen peas and carrots, so used the same sized package of mixed frozen vegetables.  Very good meal!

This is the first recipe I have tried for pot pie and it was so good that I do not even want to try another one. I used chicken instead of turkey and left out the green beans but added potatoes. The sauce was thick not runny but had the best flavor and I did not put a top crust on. The bottom was rich enough for my taste. I will be cooking this again next week

Great pot pie!  Used only slight modifications: Used fresh carrots and frozen peas instead of a pea/carrot mix, cooked the veggies in broth instead of water and used the broth to make the sauce.  Will try sauteing the carrots and celery with the onion the next time.  This was a HUGE hit with the family.  Will be using this recipe again and again.

A great recipe!  I used fresh carrots and saved time by microwaving them with, but separate from, the peas for 2-3 minutes. I sauteed the partially cooked carrots with the onions and uncooked fennel stalks, which I substituted for the celery since I had some on hand. I also used the leftover turkey gravy for some of the liquid, which added great flavor and I added enough chicken bouillon to make about three cups.  You need to adjust the consistency so your liquid is not too thick or thin.  I had enough gravy so that I omitted the flour for the roux. I thought that 425 would be a little hot for a 35 minute bake, but the pies came out perfectly.  This recipe will become a tradition whenever I have leftover turkey.

AWESOME!!!! Followed recipe to a T, except I didn't have peas & carrots. So I used frozen veggie mix (corn, peas, carrots, green beans, etc). I also used "Ruth's Grandma's Pie Crust" from this site. Pie was perfectly seasoned, perfectly thick filling, everything was perfect. I ate 3 pieces... lol  Next time I will make 2, as recipe is written (I halfed everything this time). And I'll stick the 2nd pie in the freezer. There WILL be a next time. I'm thinking as soon as next week... :)

I made this recipe today!  Yum!  I added more veggies and turkey, and cut the butter in half.  Cooked veggies in chicken broth instead of water.  Also, cooked the onions with the veggies.  Added more broth than the recipe called for.  I will make this again.

This is a great way to make "day two turkey" a hit. I had a lot of leftover mashed potatoes, so I used them as the top crust. I used whatever veggies we had left in the fridge. The pies went together fast, with little effort--and everyone loved them. A definite keeper

Used 2 Tb canola oil instead of butter.  Substituted a frozen oriental stir-fry vegetable mix for the celery and frozen vegetables listed.  It was still excellent.  I think the use of a good chicken broth is important to this recipe.  I use Victorian Epicure Inc. Chicken Bouillon Base which is also quite low in sodium.

I made this last night for dinner and my husband loved it! The only change I made was the use of celery salt because I didn't have any celery seed. It came out tasty and moist! This recipe is certainly a keeper for those after-Thanksgiving leftovers!

This was my first time making a pot pie so I was really worried it wouldn't turn out.  Luckily it did!  It is easy to make and tastes delicious.  I will definitely be making this again

I made it and it turned out fantastic...the only change I did was to use cream instead of milk and to make the crust myself. I will definitely make it again and again

I've made this SEVERAL times, and it's absolutely delicious... everyone in my family (kids included) loves it!  I substitute fresh carrots for the frozen, and instead of green beans, I use frozen corn.  And I saute the celery with the onions (in the butter).  I've tried with a pre-cooked roaster chicken to save time, and it will do, but the turkey is still the best.

Soooooo amazing! REAL comfort food. Simple ingredients and simple instructions. I have made this a dozen times and continue making it when I need comfort. LOL. I tweaked it just a but with more himilayan salt and pepper and italian seasonings (just my own preference). Absolutely delicious. Used this receipe with Chef John’s pie crust and you have a winner. I have even frozen a couple of pot pies and it worked well when reheated. Fantastic receipe. A million thanks.

This is a fantastic recipe. I put half of the recipe in a pie dish and topped it with one pie crust to cut some of the carbs. I froze the other half. the crust on the frozen pot pie was soggy and brown on the top and underdone on the bottom. quite a disappointment since we loved the first one so much. Made the recipe again and this time just froze the turkey mixture. placed a pie crust on the pot pie just before putting it in the oven. Great results.

Great pot pie. I did modify a bit. I substituted brown rice flour for regular flour ; 1/2 cup of chopped red peppers for green beans; and gluten free crust. I also added 1tsp of rosemary and garlic  seasoning. I will definitely use the recipe again.

Outstanding!! I was told the dish was like eating at a high end restaurant! I made it just as the recipe called for, but with a touch of  chili pepper. The consistency was great and pepper flavoring just yummy. In addition, I made an extra of the gravy to serve on the side, with mashed potatoes and to utilize for pie topping because I read a review that the pie was too thick and needed less flour for a more watery filling. I just  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe!  10 stars!!

This was incredibly easy and wonderfully tasty.  I didn't have celery seed so skipped that, and used the turkey broth I had made with the leftover turkey instead of chicken broth.  Also followed the advice given of boiling the veggies in the broth instead of just water.  So, so yummy!  Definitely making this again!  Thank you!

This pot pie is the best I have made.  The crust was light and flakey and the filling was firm enough to hold together and not slop all over the plate.  Totally yummy.  I made a single pie and between me and my roommate, we ate all but one piece.  I also baked it in a cast iron skillet.  Both top and bottom crusts were browned to perfection.

I have to say that this turkey pie was better than I had expected.  Super easy to make and so delicious.  I substituted the frozen green beans with corn and the carrots with fresh broccoli.  I boiled the broccoli with the frozen vegetables as per the directions and it turned out great.  I also didn't have any celery seed so I used celery salt (just make sure you double the celery salt).  I would definitely recommend this recipe and make it again.  Thanks Rob :)

My "go-to" pot pie. I use seasoned chicken breasts and add cubed boiled potatoes as well. Huge hit with the family! I usually freeze the other half to use later.

This worked out really well!  My wife and I are pretty much followed the recipe with the only variation being a mixed bag of  frozen vegetable of carrots, peas, and peas in the pod.  There were also baby corn cob corn that we removed from the mix.   
The recipe was easy to follow with no "I wonder what this means?" moments.  
Anyway, the cooking time was fairly accurate, we started right off with pie crust rings and removed them after 25 minutes, then cooked for an extra 15 mins or so.
It was delicious!!  After a cool-down, we dished it up and the taste was fabulous!  Very satisfying, a literal definition of comfort food.

The flavors combined so beautifully, it was hard to believe it was leftover turkey!  The family enjoyed it so much, we're already planning to have it for the church potluck next month.

This has been a go to for me since I found it. I don't even use leftovers sometimes. I'll put a chicken or turkey breast in the pressure cooker while I make the filling, shred that and throw it in. My son asks for Chicken Pie.

Fast,easy and delicious! The only changes I made were for personal taste.  Added potato and mushrooms, left out the onion powder and celery seed.  I found the filling too thick so I added more broth.  It was  a hit.  Will make this again.  The second time I made this I used half and half insteadof milk because it was in the fridge and I didn't want it to go bad.  Made it richer and creamier.

I've made this many times now as it has become a family go-to for using up turkey or chicken leftovers.  It is delicious.  
Funny thing happened tonight.......I grabbed a box of apple juice from the fridge by mistake rather than the chicken stock.  I couldn't figure out why the filling tasted so sweet until I figured out what happened.  I also used filo pastry that was on-hand & baked in a 9x12 baking dish.  We all had a good laugh, but the end result wasn't that bad!  It was eaten up anyway! :)

What an amazing use of left over Christmas turkey.  I followed the recipie exactly but added a little more salt after tasting it.  The family loves it and thinks I am a genius chef.  I will freeze the second pie for reheating later.  Very good use if leftovers.  Try this recipe if you want to be a hero

Very tasty, only two of us so I frozen the second pie to eat at a later date. There were no leftovers will definitely make again.

So yummy! And easy. Never any leftovers. The kids literally clean the pan. So much for Monday work lunch. An ultimate score when the kids gobble it up.

Holy cr@p this was good.  I used left over chicken instead of turkey, otherwise didn't change a thing.  Oh, I did add some garlic with the onion, as a meal isn't a meal in my house without some garlic ;) 
I half-ed the recipe since there are only 2 of us in my house.  The next day leftovers were a bit dry, but we  didn't care. The deliciousness was still there :)

I have made this pot pie many times and everytime I do, I am told it is the best pot pie they have ever had.  I use Pepperidge Farm Puff Pastry as the crust which makes it even more amazing (and it's a dairy free crust for the lactose intollerant).  I also prefer to do individual cup cakes rather than a big pie.  This is the best!

Yummy!!! Added sage and rosemary and a lot more milk to thin out the sauce and make it creamier. So good!

I'm not a fan of pot pies, but my family likes them so I decided to try this recipe with leftover Christmas turkey. I also don't like frozen peas and carrots so I just used enough cooked diced carrots and celery to equal the amount of vegetables needed.  I thought this was very tasty and it's handy to not have to use leftover gravy.  A tip though is to take the pan off the heat when adding the broth and milk to the roux to prevent lumps.  The amount of filling fit perfectly into 2 Western Family brand deep dish pie crusts.

My husband couldn't get enough of this recipe!  I didn't want to make two  pies, so I split the recipe in two.  It turned out SO good!  I will likely make chicken pot pies with this recipe in the future!

This is DELICIOUS! I used leftover Christmas turkey shreds instead of cubed turkey, low sodium chicken broth, only 1 stick of butter, and a little extra veggies since i didn't have quite enough turkey. I like that the only "bad" things are the butter and the crust. Next time I will make whole wheat crusts and use even less butter.

I use daily fresh green beans because we had leftovers of those from thanksgiving too and that was better. My biggest problem with the recipe is that the filling was too thick for my liking. The flour based slurry was like a mashed potato consistency and I would have liked something a bit more soupy. Maybe using half as much flour would do it or cornstarch instead. I might play around with it a bit to see.

This was great! Glad it makes 2- I froze one for later. I made it like the recipe but I had a bag of mixed veggies that I used instead of the frozen veggies listed but I  picked out the limas since I thought it would be better without them. Will def make again, Dad! Yum

I followed this as closely as indicated but for one pie, not two. The family ate it all in one sitting! So this is my go-to recipe with rave reviews from the carnivores, not the reviewer. I've probably made this every other week for a year now and it never disappoints.

I replaced 1/2 of the liquid with leftover gravy, used a  homemade all butter crust into a 9x13 pan - baked for about 30 mins. Lots of fresh thyme, caramelized the onions (didn't use milk because I was out) - just chicken broth, turned out great.  Gone are the days of cream of whatever soup!

Considering this is my Dad's own creation, I would have to say it was amazing. This year he made it with some leftover green bean casserole instead of frozen green beans and it was phenomenal! You definitely want to make 2 pies because I can polish off a quarter of a pie per meal and you will want some more! Good job Dad!

I haven't commented on a recipe yet though I have been using this site for years now.  But I had to comment on this one.  I made this recipe and it was fabulous.  My picky husband loved it too and even asked if I had saved this recipe.  

The only change I did make was to follow someone else's tip and substitute poultry seasoning for the Italian seasoning which is why I gave it four out of five since I did do a substitute.  This one is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe, family loves it.  Perfect winter meal with salad on the side.  Have made numerous times but differently each time.  Have used a 9x9 pan filling fits perfectly and rolled out 2 store bought deep dish pie crusts for the topping.  Depends what's in the fridge for veggies.  Have used corn, peas carrots, green beans and new potatoes.  yummy!!

This is great! I also Used left over gravy and extra broth. It overflowed in store bought crust pans so I scooped some out before cooking. Cooked up some carrots that I didn't have in micro in 5 minutes.  Could be used over noodles, potatoes or rice instead of putting in pie.  Great flavor!

I made this for my family's day after Christmas dinner potluck and it was a hit! So easy to make but looks like it took a lot of work. I subbed the frozen veggies for fresh (except for the peas) and took the advice of boiling them in the chicken stock. I also added fresh thyme, sage and rosemary. I used Trader Joe's ready made pie crusts and added an egg wash on top before baking which gave the crust a beautiful color. I can't wait to make this again!

Soooooooo good! For allergies I made my own gluten/wheat free crust with my own flour and I used almond milk instead of regular milk. I used a rotisserie chicken so it ended up being five cups of chicken. My husband, 8month old and three year old loved it!!!

I have tried many pot pie recipes and they always turn out bland and disappointing. The 50 cent pot pies at the store are better. But THIS recipe is it!!!! Very very good. Lots of flavor, moist, just absolutely perfect!  Made it as written, wouldn't change a thing!

A nearly perfect comfort food. I made this using leftover Thanksgiving turkey, deviating from the original recipe, only by adding a cup of diced potatoes to the mix. It worked out very well and was enjoyed by all. It's a basic, no fail recipe that can be tailored to any taste. I'm sure I'll be making some version of this for years to come. Thanks for sharing Rob.

Followed recipe to the T and made no substitutions. It was absolutely amazing. The trick is in the sauce. The sauce should not be runny or your pie will be runny.  This would be amazing with rotisserie chicken as well.

Love this recipe, have made it many times and it's been loved by all! Many times I've left out one ingredient because I didn't have it, one of the seasonings or celery  or stock but it still comes out tasting great. Dunno how but this recipe cannot be messed up! Delicious

Great!  Surprisingly tasty!  I only had one pie crust so I used it for the top, and made "easy pie crust" from this site, for the bottom.  I added portobello mushrooms to the onions sauté, and also frozen corn to the carrots and celery. Doubled the spices since I tasted as I went, and felt like it could use more.  Hubby and I both loved it, my son liked the taste but wasn't too keen on the veg content. If it had more turkey, he would like it too.

Fantastic recipe. Prepared it just as set out. I made extra filling and froze it. Easy to whip this up on a school night when the ingredients are ready to go! The whole family loved it.

My go to Turkey Pot Pie recipe from now on!! I had some leftover carrots and celery so I diced those up and used them, and then used canned veggies to make up the difference. I also had some leftover mashed potatoes so I added a layer of those to the filling as well. Used skim milk that was in the fridge. DELICIOUS!

I've been using this recipe for years (usually with fresh veggies) and the whole family loves it. I always cook one and put the other in the freezer for later. I use either leftover chicken or turkey, whatever I have.

Excellent recipe! The Dad of the houes said so. The spices are subtle and perfect for this dish.  It does not taste like "chicken"!  Thank you. I made my own crust and just used frozen mixted vegetables.
It was that easy (especially for my first pot pie).

I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn, etc) and added a clove of chopped garlic just before the onions were done.  Cut the pepper back to 1/4 t since my family doesn't like spicy.  Didn't feel like messing with the crust so made the filling and served it over biscuits with a little shredded cheese on top.  Came out wonderful.  Will make it again for sure.

This is a great recipe!  We smoked an extra turkey so I was looking for ways to use my leftovers.  I made it for dinner everyone loved it.  I used only 1/2 c butter and omitted the green beans and added diced potatoes instead (used what I had in hand).  I didn't change anything else.  Seasoned perfectly.  I am definitely saving this recipe.  Thanks for this delicious recipe!!

This was delicious! I added chopped mushrooms (finishing up my leftover produce). I have a large family, so I bought a puff pastry sheet and baked our "pie" in a casserole dish.

Very good flavor.  I made my own pie crust and blind baked it first for an extra crispy bottom crust.  I used frozen mixed veggies, they worked fine. Didn't have celery so next time I'm sure it will be even better with it added! Quick and easy to make which is a good thing because it gets eaten very quickly in my house!

Great recipe.  I had to change a few things because of tons of allergies in the family. We can't use butter so I tired coconut oil.  It was really tasty.

This is my family's new favorite pot pie recipe!  So delicious!  Made exactly as recipe is written and wouldn't change a thing!  I do recommend adding the foil over the crust during the last 10 minutes or so, mine burned slightly, but didn't affect the taste.

This is a fantastic recipe! I have used turkey and chicken, store bought crust and homemade. It is quick and easy, and I love being able to use fresh ingredients and know what I'm feeding my family! So easy that my 13yo daughter has prepared this dish for us, too!

This is th fourth time (in a month) I have made this recipe for my husband!!! He loves it and can't go wrong. Did I change a few things? Yep -- no reason to make it the same way twice... Do simmer the veggies in broth and add one or two small,diced pototoes. Great recipe!!!

I was a little  skeptical when I read the ingredient list but this recipe tops the chart as one of my all time favorite foods!  I can hardly believe it's that good.  It's on my weekly dinner list from now on.

I loved this -- it's comfort food at it's best! It set up really well & wasn't runny all all. Use whatever veggies you have on hand -- it'll be absolutely delicious.

Fantastic way to use up two shop bought Chickens I had in the fridge from dinner the night before - I added cubes of potato that I'd peeled and then microwaved with a couple of glugs of oil for 5 minutes right at the end of making the filling so they wouldn't break up or soak up too much liquid. Topped it with cookie cutter cutouts of Darth Vader and Yoda, and it went down a treat with everyone :)

I am a terrible cook!  Nothing I cook turns out GOOD!  Nothing!!  However, this was the best!!!!  I am so proud of myself.   The best pot pie I have ever had!! I ate it for Breakfast, lunch, snack and dinner. I simmered my veggies a little longer, added canned cubed potatoes (that I drained), and added a little more chicken stock & milk at the end (only because it looked a little thick).  I used Pillsbury frozen deep dish pie crust, and topped it with the Pillsbury roll-type pie crust for the top. (You can find this in the canned biscuit section.  Two rolls came in the box).  After putting the roll-type pie crust on top, I pinched the edges to make a design. This was beautiful. I am a firm believer to always use "name-brand" stuff, so I used Byrd's Eye Frozen Peas and Byrd's Eye Frozen green beans.  Yumm! Yumm!   Also, I did not put my pies in a pie dish, because the Pillsbury Frozen Deep Dish Pie Crust were already in a metal pie pan. I placed both pies on top of a baking sheet.  Note:  While I was preparing everything, I left the frozen pie shells out, so they had time to unthaw. Yumm!Yumm!

Great way to use up leftover turkey.  Very tasty.  I used a can of green beans since that's what I had on hand.

This is definately a keeper in this house! Very versitile. Can change up the veggies and I would imagine you could do this with beef broth and beef stew meat. Maybe I will try that next time!

YUMMMM!! I made this the lazy way, by spreading the filling in a casserole dish, and topping with crescent biscuits in the last 12 minutes of baking.  Otherwise I made this exactly as written, and everyone loved it! Will definitely make this again!

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe! I didn't have enough ingredients to make crust, so I decided to just have it thicken on the stove top. Then I topped it with potato croquettes, because I wanted to use up the left over potatoes. It was SO good! The whole family loved it! I made a few substitutions, simply based on what I had on hand. For the veggies, I used 2c frozen peas, 2 cups leftover corn, 1 can string beans, 1 can sliced carrots. I also took a reviewers suggestion to saute the celery with the onion.  So I only boiled the other veggies about 4 min.Another viewer suggestion I followed: I reduced the butter by half and it was plenty. Also, I thought I didn't have any celery seed (found it later) so I used celery salt. It was wonderful, and so easy! This is one that is going in my cookbook for sure! Your dad must be an awesome cook! Thanks for sharing his recipe! Finally a way to use up leftover turkey that we are not sick of! :)PS- After I added all the veggies and meat as the recipe stated, I did add about another 1/2 c mix of broth and milk, since I used extra veggies.Additional info- Since the first time making this, we typically serve it on toast. Different, but delicious, and the family loves it!

Got this recipe last year right after Thanksgiving and made the pies exactly as described - perfection! Since then, I've altered it to make other versions like chicken and mushroom.  

This is a terrific recipe whether you follow it 100$ or play around with it.  Use whatever leftovers you have and just don't count the calories.

I used left over stuffing as the crust.  I omitted the celery as its one of the "dirty dozen", added corn for color interest.  I also used a beater to blend the flour, broth, onion mixture as it was a bit lumpy.  I also used cake pans and quiche pans, I ran out of pie pans.  Happy Thanksgiving from a Yankee.

I made this recipe with leftover dark turkey meat and chicken breast. I also steamed fresh veggies instead of boiling frozen ones. My hubby said it was the best tasting dinner that he has ever had!!! I highly recommend this one!! Next time, I will reduce the amount of butter and use skim milk to cut down on the calories and hopefully not affect the taste too much.

Awesome! Didn't have celery salt or Italian seasoning, so I substituted some oregano, thyme and garlic salt. Also forgot the milk (oops) but used 2 cups of chicken stock and it still turned out great. Perfect recipe for leftover turkey and a great base to build on depending on what you have on hand. Thanks for the recipe!

Although I am not usually a pot pie person, this was surprisingly tasty.  I followed the basics of the recipe but played around with the veggies since I didn't have the exact ones in the recipe on hand.  I used green beans, diced potato, and sliced carrot in mine.  I used the recipe for basic flaky pie crust also from this site and it turned out wonderfully.  I have made this pie at least four times now.

Love this classic, perfect, comfort food. To cut down on some of the fat, I've used solely roasted turkey breast and have put a crust only on the top and it's still delicious.

This was a big hit with the whole family.  I used 1.5 tsp. of Herbes de Provence instead of the celery seed, onion powder, and Italian seasoning because it's what I had on hand. It turned out great!  I had one leftover frozen deep dish pie crust that I used for the bottom and a leftover Pillsbury refrigerated pie crust that I used for the top. Both crusts were at room temperature when I put everything together.  I halved the recipe (except for the seasonings) and it was the perfect amount for one pot pie with a deep dish crust.  This recipe is a keeper!

This worked like a charm! Never made this before, but it all fell together nicely. Really yummy and such a great way to make use of all the left turkey. Also, made me feel great to make something ahead for the week.

This was my first time making a pot pie and it came out great! I followed the recipe as is, except for adding potatoes. The consistency was good, and the crust nice and flaky. Everyone enjoyed it and kept going back for seconds. This recipe is a keeper!

Wow!  This is a winner.  I didn't have celery or onion powder but it still came out great.  In fact it was on par with Marie Calendar's pot pies.  I look forward to modifying this recipe (to make it less viscuous )  Good job!

Delicious! I needed to use up some leftovers, so I put a half cup of stuffing, mashed potatoes, and gravy, and about half the amount of broth, flour, and milk. I also omitted the frozen veggies. I have tried this as a pie, and as individual empanadas, and my husband went crazy for the empanadas.  To make, use a bowl to cut 5 inch circles out of the pie dough, drop a spoonful of the mixture in the center, and then fold over and pinch the edges. Brush with egg white and bake for 40 min at 400 degrees.

I made the lazy version of this.  I finely chopped onion because my guys aren't big fans and I skipped the celery.  I used a can of peas & carrots and a can of potatoes and it came out great!

So glad this was in the Nov 26th newsletter from allrecipes - this is comfort food at it's best.  I certainly would use the butter, flour, broth, milk and seasonings for making gravy for other meals as well - it could make cardboard taste good :o

I've made this several times now and just wanted to say how wonderfully delicious this is. I can not have dairy. This recipe was easily converted using earth balance for the butter and coconut milk for the milk. I used SoDelicious unsweetened, so it did not change the flavor, at least not that I could tell. I also substituted herbs de provence for the Italian seasoning, just because I prefer it. All in all this is delicious just as is but can be easily changed up to suit your taste with excellent results. I love this!! Thank you Rob N.

This recipe is just perfect for leftover turkey and veggies!  The flavors are right on and the crust is a wonderful compliment to the filling.  No leftovers here!

We are enjoying this recipe today also. It is wonderful and easy to make, even for someone who does not cook a lot. I used what I had and replaced fresh corn for celery and frozen squash for peas. I like that I had a pie to share also. Thanks!

Excellent recipe. Despite all the recommended modifications, decided to make this exactly to the recipe - wasn’t disappointed at all. Will make this again and again. Filling is firmer, so if you like a ‘juicier’ pie, just add more milk as others have suggested. We loved it exactly as written. Thx for sharing!

I've made this several times and it always turns out great.  Sometimes I use just a crust on top if I only have one or even puff pastry on top in a pinch.

This is fantastic!!

I made a few adjustments- I use fresh carrots and saute them with the onions and corn instead of green beans, half the salt and added a TBSP of chicken base. I purchase ready made pie crusts and rotisserie chicken and voila - everyone has loved it so far. Thank you!!

This recipe lives up to the hype!
I had baked a turkey breast the night before and was looking for a recipe that would finish off the leftover turkey.  Happy I stumbled across the recipe because my family loved it!  Minor alteration - Instead of 2/3 cup of chopped onion I used 1 cup of chopped sweet (vidalia) onion and used  parsley instead of celery seed.  
This recipe  fills the pie pan so nicely and it's thick, rich and perfectly seasoned.  Thanks

I made this this week, it came together very well!  I saw a recommendation to use puff pastry for the top. I did not this time, but I will. 
Thanks for the recipe, it was great.

We love this pot pie but did make a change on the veggies.  Instead of peas and carrots and green beans, we used mixed vegetables which were easier.  The mixed vegetables contain those veggies.  It makes two full pies and is great for a crowd.

The roux/flour mixture is VERY tasty.  This made 2 very hearty pies.  I took the frozen leftover turkey from Thanksgiving (was going to make soup until I saw this recipe) and made these easy pies for Christmas holiday guests to have while visiting.  I will make this again.  Glad I didn't make the soup!

Used frozen bag of carrot, peas, string beans & corn! The corn was a nice addition.  So easy to make and so yummy. I will now be making this with turkey leftovers rather than soup.

I’ve made this recipe several times and everyone absolutely loves it! I use 4 cups of frozen mixed vegetables with green beans instead of the 2 cups of green beans. I think the 2 cups would be too much for me. It will be a new tradition in our family at Christmas from now on.

This is without a doubt the best. I have used this for years and everyone wants the recipe. The mix of veggies is not as important as the number of cups.   I have a friend who enjoys my cooking and he says it is the best turkey pot pie he has ever had. He says the mix of all the components is perfect.  It comes out as a solid piece of pie but it is still moist. I cook a lot but I only use this for turkey pot pie

I really liked this the only thing I changed was instead of adding water and chicken broth I used my homemade turkey gravy I made when I made the turkey and just added the milk like the recipe called for..

It was a hit! I cooked mine in a pyrex casserole dish and just a top crust. I will make this again, for sure.

Amazing flavor and so easy to make! We had leftover turkey in the freezer from Thanksgiving and we decided to make a pot pie. We used carrots, peas, and I sauteed some celery and onions to put in the filling. I used pre-made pie crusts which cut down on the prep time. I will definitely make it again!

I halved the recipe and only made the filing. I used it in a shepherd's pie-type construction (mashed potatoes on top, baked and broiled to finish). It was DELISH!

Ok, let me just say I'm not a pot pie fan (especially the ones in the freezer section)...But I love this recipe! It reminds me so much of one we got from a famous outdoors equipment chain. The gravy is awesome and nice & thick!

I tweaked it a tiny bit, just in method. I used all of the ingredients. I didn't boil my veggies, I used the microwave with a little chicken broth. Way better than boiling! Also, I cooked the celery with the onions. 

Since all of the turkey was gone, I used boneless chicken breasts. I just salt & peppered them and baked with a little chicken broth in the pan. I thought about cutting it up and sauteing it, but I thought the chicken texture would end up wrong.

Enjoy & savor this recipe, you won't regret it!

Came out great! Just the right thickness. I did make some changes based on what I had:
1. used Heavy Cream instead of milk to make it more rich.
2. I used diced carrots, onions, and celery and sautéed this in a deep pan with 1-1/3 sticks of butter till soft.
3. I replaced the italian seasoning with poultry seasoning.
4. I put this in individual bowls and put a top crust on them instead of doing the two 9 inch pies.

I baked it for 30 mins but probably would pull it out at 25 mins.

Definitely would make it again.

This is such an awesome recipe!  Me and my family LOVED it.  I didn’t cube my turkey.  It was leftover from Thanksgiving, so I just kinda shredded it.  My eldest daughter had 3 helpings and said it’s way better than the ones from the store!  Score!  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I made two of these with the leftover turkey.  I used 2/3 white meat, and 1/3 dark for more flavor.
I froze both of them, but cooked one the week after Thanksgiving, and it was awesome.
Thanks for sharing...

WAY WAY too thick.  No sauce at all.  Try cutting the flour in the sauce down by half or more.  Otherwise just a giant dough ball.

This turned out  waay better than I thought it would. I cut the recipe in half, because it's just the two of us, omitted the celery and frozen vegetables for a can of mixed vegetables and it turned out perfect! I am definitely making this again!!

Thanks for the recipe!  I love that it has a flexibility which  - seems to lend to variations but not take away the original intent - a delicious meal!
      Since Thanksgiving was small but turkey was big, I increased the recipe by 5.  Yes, went out on a limb here.  Baked one for dinner last night, froze the rest - one in large aluminum pan (1/2 size foil deep steamer) and six 9" pies.  I'll give away some of the frozen  ones.

First time trying a pot pie recipe. It was super easy and took no time at all. My family loved every bite. I modified it by taking out all the veggies except for the onion and carrots (picky eaters) and it still came out amazing.

My husband absolutely loved it...I thought it was just ok.  It required more liquid or less flour either way it was very flavorful (after I added a little more of everything).  He said it was a keeper :))

So tasty! The full teaspoon of black pepper made it too peppery. Also used a 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) which was sufficient. 

I love the tip about cooking the veggies in the chicken broth. I wish I read that tip before I made it!!!

I used almond milk and it shockingly came out great! I agree that the filling could be a *tad* more watery!!!

Used premade refrigerator pie dough and followed the recipe fairly closely and it turned out perfectly. I used canned peas and green beans and boiled baby carrots in chicken broth (which I then saved for the filling)My husband had thirds. For premade pie dough, use a fork to poke holes in the bottom dough before you add the filling, and then cut holes in the dough you place on top. This is an easy recipe to make.

I made this recipe with left over turkey from Thanksgiving. Other than dicing up a few potatoes and ommiting the green beans I followed the directions as shown. My wife and kids LOVED the flavor of this Turkey Pot Pie!

Delicious and easy! I followed the advice of another reviewer and cooked the vegetables in chicken broth, and did not drain them. I also added a significant amount of chicken broth to the filling. Otherwise, I followed this recipe pretty closely. It was a big hit!

Used for left over turkey, but will make again with chicken.  My husband could not get enough!  I added way more black pepper and broiled after the 30 minutes until golden brown. It was perfect!

This is an absolutely delicious recipe!! I have NEVER made pot pie of any kind before and the frozen ones I’ve bought from the store have never been that tasty. Needless to say, I was skeptical about how this would turn out...but what else was I to do with 4 cups of leftover Thanksgiving turkey? I had to make a few substitutions due to what was already in the house (i.e. 4 cups mixed frozen veggies, 2 diced potatoes, 1/2 cup butter), but besides that I followed the recipe exactly—I could not have asked for a more delicious dinner!! Even my husband (who was raised with scrumptious homemade pot pies) only had good things to say about the final result. AND my two-year-old ate every bite without complaint!! This recipe is a total win. Thank you!!!

Loved this tasty and simple recipe. It was exactly what our needed to finish off the remaining Thanksgiving turkey. We used mixed green beans and carrots with chopped green beans. We also used frozen deep dish pie crusts for the bottom and  Pillsbury roll out pie crust for the tops. 

We will definitely make this again.

Delicious.  Easy to make. We didn’t have Italian seasoning, so we used sweet basil, oregano and rosemary.  Used home made turkey stock instead of chicken stock.

I’d reduce the pepper to 1/2 teaspoon instead of one teaspoon. Other than that, we LOVED this recipe and plan to make it again soon with the rest of my Thanksgiving Turkey leftovers!

I made this for my parents with all our leftover turkey. Lemme tell you, they aren't kidding when they say you won't have leftovers! My dad, who's pretty picky when it comes to food,  couldn't stop shoveling it into his face long enough to tell me what he thought of it LOL I don't even LIKE pot pie and I was squirreling away an extra slice for myself. 100%, I'd definitely make this again.

Every bit as good as people say.I made it exactly according to the recipe and it turned out really well. Next time I'll try some mushrooms, use only a top crust (the double crust made it a little rich for me) and maybe thin the roux a little. I made one 9" pie and several pot pies to freeze for later.

Thank you for sharing this yummy recipe.

We really liked this recipe.  The changes I made were to use biscuits on top instead of the pie crust, and instead of Italian seasoning I used thyme, rosemary, parsley and basil to taste.  This is my new pot pie recipe!

This pie is delicious and I will make it again! The hardest part was trying to halve some of the ingredients on the fly since I only wanted to make one pie.

This recipe was AMAZING! I omitted the green beans and added extra carrot, peas, and celery. I boiled my veggies in chicken broth instead of water, and added a little extra milk and chicken broth so the filling wasn't so thick. This will now be a household favorite! I cannot compliment this recipe enough!!!

Delicious!  I used a little bit of bouillon for added flavor, and did not use a bottom crust.   My family loved it!

This was a little irritating but really easy to make! I made  two home  made pie crusts for it and they turned out fantastic. 

This was perfect for our left over turkey! So yummy! I practically made this recipe but for a few vegetables that I had to substitute. Yay! 

I posted pictures!

DELICIOUS! The only thing I did different; I added the green beans and bacon left over from Thanksgiving dinner to the filling and just did frozen carrots and corn as the recipe calls. Everyone loved it!

I used Pillsbury pie crusts and three cups of frozen mixed veggies instead of the green beans plus mixed veggies. Cooked veggies in chicken broth as one comment before me digested and this was the best pot pie! Favorite recipe on All Recipes out of many tried!

The recipe as written is great! Ive made this for a couple of years now and have modified only slightly. I oven roast potatoes before hand seasoned only with Original Badia Sazon. Throw them in at the end with the veggies. I reduce butter to a stick and double celery and onion (season again with Badia). I cook the frozen veggies in the broth. The biggest change... i HATE pie crust. So I use croissant dough for bottom and top layers. Beat an egg white - spread over the top. Sprinkle with garlic salt and parsley to bake at 375 for 25 minutes. Filling is nice and thick!

It was yummy when I made it last night. I had to modified the recipe so it’s more of a chicken pot pie, which I replaced the turkey with chicken. It still turned out very good.

Excellent recipe! Add a Salad, tall iced tea, desert and you've got a really yummy complete meal for a hungry crowd in record time with little fuss! Add whatever veggies are on hand or favorites and it doubles easily. I have even pre made and frozen individual servings and family size casseroles. AWESOME!! Just one suggestion make enough for seconds

Great flavor, you can change up the Italian seasoning for tarragon or thyme etc for a unique experience. I substituted the pie crust, fried up some crispy bits of turkey skin and baked in a casserole dish with a puff pastry top

My one teenage son ate three large slices of the turkey pot pie and wanted another, but I thought three was plenty. My other children and I loved it too. I did have to cover the edges of the crust with tin foil after about 20 minutes to prevent it from getting too dark. I had to bake it about an extra 10 minutes for it to be done too.

Fabulous.  Made it a couple times and of course have modified it.  Use canned green beans instead of frozen because I like the flavor better.  Hot tip from another cook is using the broth to defrost the frozen stuff, don't really cook much it as it will cook in the pie.
I also saute the fresh celery with the onion like I'm making soup.  

Take your time and thicken it properly, I've rushed and the pie comes out a bit runny, which should not have been a surprise.  next I will try the poultry seasoning rather than Italian as recommended elsewhere.

I have made this recipe a few times and love it. I didn’t always have the veggies in the recipe on hand, so I just used the ones I had of leftovers making sure I just had the total amount of cups. Normally I’ll put corn, carrots and peas. Basically whatever i have leftover from a roast dinner. If i don’t have enough meat or veggies left over I just freeze it until I do. Other than the veggie part i follow the recipe to the T. I also freeze my pies. After putting the filling in the pie shells, without baking them, i put it each pie in a big ziplock and freeze. When I’m ready to eat it I just pop it in the oven when it’s frozen and bake it at 375 f for 45mins to 1 hour. Basically until the pie crust looks nice and done and the filling is nice and hot.

Excellent. I wonder how it would taste The garlic or garlic powder in place of the onion powder. It already has onions, so substituting the garlic might work nicely. I think I will try that next time and make this.

 I made this without the crust. I added all the ingredients into a crockpot. Then I made biscuits to put this over. It would be an upside down pot pie doing it this way. I needed it for a potluck at work, and this seem to be an easier way Excellent.

This was delicious.  I loved the Italian seasoning, onion powder and celery seed additions.  I diced up my own celery, carrots,  and 1/3 cup of red onion and sautéed them in a large frying pan.   I had a package of gravy that came with the turkey breast and some broth from baking the turkey that I began to simmer the vegetables in.  I added 3 small russet potatoes- diced, and frozen peas along with the turkey, simmering till potatoes were tender. I omitted green beans only because I didn’t have any on hand.

I think it is the best pot pie or casserole I have ever had, bar none.  The base with the onion, butter, flour, broth, and seasonings is the key.  The other ingredients can be shifted a bit without affecting the overall finished product.  I used two cans of mixed vegetables and one can of French cut green beans instead of frozen vegies; dried, crushed celery leaf instead of celery seed.  I cooked the filling and split it into two 8x8 foil pans and wrapped them for the freezer.  I got one out yesterday and asked hubby if he wanted pie crust, or a cornbread batter poured on top during the last 15 minutes of baking.  He thought about it and asked for stuffing mix as a topping.  I mixed up half a box of instant stuffing with some chicken broth and spread it on top and browned the last 15 minutes.  That was a very good alteration.  I am going to purge all other casserole recipes and keep this one.  Update: I made this again, using boneless chicken thighs cooked in the Instant Pot.  I used the broth from the Instant Pot for the base.  I still didn't have frozen vegies in the freezer, so this time I used one can each of green beans, carrots and peas.  There's no substitution for celery, you have to have it.

I am not a fan of any kind of pot pie, but my family likes them so I tried this to use up the leftover turkey I froze. I made this and became a fan. Everyone enjoyed this dish.  I added a bag of frozen mixed veggies (carrots, peas, green beans and corn), half a bag of frozen mirepox (celery, onion, and green bell pepper), and omitted the celery seed (I did not have any). I will make this again!

Love it and so does the family!  This pot pie is so much better then the premade frozen ones.  I especially love how it makes two pies, we eat one and freeze the other to have for supper on another day.  I have made it with both left over turkey and left over chicken.  Only thing I did different is make my own crusts.

This dish was absolutely delicious...the whole family raved! I used the frozen veggie mix, pre-chopped onion & celery (the height of laziness.)  The only changes i made...added 1 can of diced potatoes & 1 can of condensed cream of mushroom soup. Yummy!

Incredibly delicious! I used what I had on hand. Substituted canned coconut milk for the cream, and used  canned green beans & canned mixed vegetables instead of peas. I will make this whenever I have leftover turkey!

I cut the butter as others did and used all fresh vegetables.  I would have liked the gravy in the pie to have been a little runnier(?) but other than that, this is a keeper.  Loved it!

Delicious. Almost exact, except used frozen veggie mix which also had corn and Lima beans. Extra crust is so yummy especially since I love crust. Used leftover Christmas turkey breast meat. Will definitely make again.

I made a few changes based on other reviews.  I rolled out a store-bought pie crust to fit a 9x13" casserole dish and added slits.  I baked just the bottom crust at 425 until golden.  

For the filling, I used 2 packages of Kroger frozen vegetable gumbo blend soup mix in place of the veggies and heated them in my own hearty turkey stock (3 cups). I used frozen pearl onions instead of fresh and just over 1/2 cup of flour instead of 2/3rds.  I dry mixed the spices (much more than listed) in the flour and added them to the butter/onion whisking carefully.  I used half and half instead of milk and added until I got the correct creamy texture.  I added this slowly to the vegetable/stock mixture and then added the turkey.  

I reduced the oven temp to 375 and baked for about 30 minutes until it was golden brown on top.  It was perfect.

I found this recipe quite by accident as I was looking for something else. I decided to give this a try at Christmas for our leftover turkey. We are not big fans of turkey so this was a good recipe to use it up. What a surprise!! It is a superb recipe with great flavor and good texture. It is the only recipe I  now use. I recommend this for everyone! So easy to make and wonderful to eat! The only thing that I would add is how to freeze it, and how to bake it after you take it out of the deep-freeze. This recipe deserves to be made over and over again! Kudos to dad! I just found out that from a frozen state you would cook it at 375 for about 1 1/2 hours. Check at 1 hour to see if the crust is brown; cook longer if needed. If the edges brown to fast put tin foil around the edges.

I showed this recipe to wife and she made this using left over smoked turkey from Thanksgiving and I enjoyed it. Only thing that kept me from giving 5 stars is I like more of the gravy inside my pot-pie. On next try we will try to make a little more of the gravy inside the pot-pie.

So today is December 16 and I just cooked the first of my two turkey pot pies that I froze just after Thanksgiving!  All I can say is DELISH!  I followed the recipe to the "t" and it came out perfect.  Since we were tired of turkey by Sunday of Thanksgiving, I made the pies and immediately froze them.  I used refrigerated pie dough, made the pies and froze them unwrapped. After they were frozen, I wrapped them in saran wrap and tin foil.  Today I preheated the oven to 425 and took all the wrapping off and placed the pie directly in the oven with no thawing.  It took just under an hour and PERFECTION. It was also my very first attempt ever at making a pot pie of any kind and I was shocked at just how easy it is!

SO good.  I will not buy pot pies any more!  Made it exactly as written. We have a family of 4 which includes 1 man, 1 woman, a 12 y/o girl and an 11 y/o boy.  We are all good eaters and some had seconds and we only ate one pie. Which was fine because EVERYONE liked it so I didnt have to cook 2 nights later when we ate pie #2!

This was delicious! I made the recipe as written except I used around half the butter just cuz it looked like enough butter to me-- tasted great so I think if you want to cut some butter out, that's probably fine. 

Everyone liked this recipe and for me it turned out not runny or anything--perfect consistency.

Yum!  Great recipe, thanks.  I used fresh carrots that I diced and just cooked them with the celery and other vegetables.  I also didn't have celery seed so just used celery salt and then added salt to taste so I didn't oversalt.  I didn't think I'd like the green beans in it but they were great. I will be making this a lot.

I followed the suggestions from other reviewers, adding mushrooms, using fresh diced carrots, and sautéing all the vegetables b/4 adding to the other ingredients.  I froze half the filling for a future pot pie, since we were a small family at the time.

I was looking for a good recipe that wouldn’t call for any cream of canned whatever, and this fit the bill. Changed only a couple of things in that I used a bag of frozen mixed veggies rather than the separate ones (carrots, peas, corn, green beans, Lima beans). Per someone else’s suggestion, I boiled the veggies in broth rather than water, and then just used all that liquid when it called for the broth. It worked perfectly too, because the starch from the veggies thickened the broth up nicely when making the sauce. I will cut back on the butter a tad next time, it didn’t really need quite so much to cook the onions. It was very tasty and I will definitely use this one again.

I was skeptical about the Italian seasoning, but somehow it all worked! I did follow the suggestion of another reviewer and used chopped fresh carrots (what I had on hand) and simmered the veggies in broth, rather than water. I also added a spoonful or two of leftover gravy (because I needed to use it up) which added even more flavor.  Finally I only had enough leftover dough from Thanksgiving to make a top layer crust, and I’m so glad because I think the filling would have been lost inside a full crust. Thanks, Dad, for a great recipe!

I do not like peas nor do I buy frozen veggies.  I boiled small diced potatoes and carrots and sauteed the celery, onions and 1/3 sweet bell pepper.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as is.  It turned out fantastic.  Will definitely make this again.

I used 1 bag of frozen mixed veggies in place of separate frozen veggies. Recipe came out PERFECT. Throw cranberry sauce on top and it's the perfect mix of sweet and savory

I made the filling according to recipe except used mixed vegetables and served it with biscuits not crust.  This is absolutely delicious.  Next time I will make time for a crust.

This was REALLY good--like 2 helpings good!  I was a little surprised to be putting Italian seasoning in a pot pie, but it was just right -- it didn't scream "Italian!" I didn't have frozen peas and carrots on hand, so made do with frozen mixed vegetables--perfect!  I made mine in a rectangular glass pan and just made a crust for the top.  Hubby approved!  (And we have less leftover Thanksgiving turkey!)  Thanks for the recipe, Rob Neil!

I tweaked the recipe just a little.  I added diced red potatoes, omitted the corn ( only because I’m not a fan) and  Instead of italian seasoning I used my favorite chicken seasonings ( I know but it is a little treasure I found and I use it on almost everything now).  Anyway it turned out great! No more wasting food all my leftovers will find new life..lol

Wow! I am really not a big fan of turkey, but this pot pie recipe is irresistible!! I used the turkey pot pie crust recipe from www.sugarspunrun.com. It was definitely worth the work! I doubled the crust recipe to match up with this recipe. It turned out awesome! I had made one pie with bottom and top crust and leftover dough was used to make 3 ramekin pot pies which will be frozen and used for lunches at work or home who cares? This is a delicious recipe! I saved the rest of the filling in a quart size bag and placed it in the freezer for easy dinner fix. I did not have celery seed and I added some garlic powder, and a little extra onion powder and black pepper, to suit my taste. Thank you very much for this! It was most definitely worth the time and effort. God bless you.

This was easy to make and tasted great.  I  made half the recipe.  I also added about 1/2 cup  of shredded cheddar cheese right before putting the mixture in the pie shell to bake.  Next time I will add a few more spices since my family likes spicier food, but it was perfect the way it was.  Definitely adding to my favorite list!  Thank you for the recipe!

Cut recipe in half for one pie. Used one package frozen mixed vegetables . Also added 1/4 cup home made gravy to sauce mix and used Pillsbury pie crusts. This was a flaky delicious pot pie.

I used the chicken stock in place of the water to cook the veggies. Then used a sieve to strain the liquid into 2 cup measuring cup to keep amount of fluids correct. Yummy!

This is the MOST ABSOLUTE BEST tasting turkey pot pie recipe!!!  The ONLY changes I made (for sake of making the recipe easier) was to SUBSTITUTE 4 CUPS of  FROZEN MIXED
VEGETABLES for the 2 cups green beans & 2 cups carrots and peas.   Its one less step and it adds corn to the pie which my family loves...yum!
Other than that the recipe and its combination of ingredients are incredibly tasty and perfection!  
Total comfort food heaven!!!

OMG! I love pot pie and have always struggled making a decent one. This recipe was simple, foolproof, and delicious! My now grown children do not normally even like it, but they all took some for their work lunch. Filling is balanced, flavorful and holds up well with no tons of gravy spilling out all over the place. Will be making this from now on!

I made this almost exactly as written meaning I used the amount of ingredients with minor alterations.  As others suggested, I reduced the butter to 1/2 cup.  I also used 1 cup of 1/2 and 1/2 using water for the remaining amount because I had an open carton to use up.  I added a can of whole potatoes that I quartered because my husband loves spuds.  I made it in a casserole dish instead of pie crusts.   We ate half of it tonight with store brand rolled biscuits on top.  I baked it for 15 minutes at 400, topped it with the biscuits and returned to the over for 15.  Most yummy.  The other half is in the freezer uncooked.  I hope it turns out as yummy!  Perfect comfort food!

Great way to use all that leftover holiday turkey!  Very tasty.  Held together excellently.  Easy to put together.  I used fresh carrots, but I did not use green beans and some of the spices I did not have on hand; however, it still worked well.  Will definitely put this recipe to use again (and again)!

My absolute favorite pot pie recipe! Very versatile so use the veggies you have on hand. On occasion the filling is a bit too thick, likely due to my rough measuring lol. Just add a bit more chicken broth until it's how you like it. I make in 4 individual servings. Freezes well, just thaw before baking.

I’ve made this several times and it’s delicious. I skip boiling the vegetables in the first step and cook the celery with the onions. I mix in a bag of frozen mixed veggies (still frozen) with the turkey (or chicken) and it comes out fine. What a great way to use leftovers!

Instead of using flour, I thickened my pot pie filling with leftover cornbread dressing and I used skimmed stock from my Cornish Hens instead of store-bought chicken stock.  Yum!

Very tasty but like some others commented, too thick. Should use less flour or more milk/chicken broth. I also only made a top crust. I’ll definitely make this again but with the mentioned adjustments.

Holy moly, delicious! I used leftover chicken breasts instead of turkey. I also used a frozen mix of peas, carrots, green beans and corn, and it was all just fantastic tasting together! I'm freezing one of the pies, and it's going to be difficult to keep from eating the rest of the first one tonight!

I followed the recipe for the most part.  This was my first time making a pot-pie and my pot-pies turned out great.  I did have to make a couple adjustments because I didn’t have a few of the ingredients; I didn’t have celery seed and substituted for coriander, I didn’t have celery and skipped it. I didn’t have frozen carrots, I used fresh instead, chopped and precooked. I would definitely make these again.

I made this with the last of our turkey leftovers. I had made turkey soup the day before and used what was left plus more vegetables and thickened the broth. Fantastic!

Delicious!! Maybe even better than Thanksgiving day! We used the garlic mashed potatoes as the top crust and added a little marble cheese to the top and browned it.

This was amazing!! I will definitely make this again and again and again - even my rather picky seven year old cleaned his plate and asked for seconds! 

I’m not going to be that person (you know, the kind that rates a recipe 5 stars but changed a whole bunch of things, like pretty much the entire recipe), but I did change a of couple minor things. What I changed: I halved the recipe (which I now regret doing because it was so delicious), I used carrots instead of celery (I don’t like cooked celery), and I used a little bit of celery salt instead of celery seed (because I was out of celery seed).

Delicious! Slight modifications made based on what was in my fridge (no green beans, subbed mushrooms, fresh carrots instead of frozen). One of the best pot pie fillings I've ever had: It almost didn't make it to the pie because we kept "taste testing" it.

This was the best pot pie recipe I've ever made. It made 2 pies and I'm making the frozen one today. Next time I think I'll add mushrooms, but this is a fantastic base recipe that you can mess with the veg and it will still be fantastic

Excellent recipe! I used Pillsbury pre-made pie crusts. I made 1 chicken pie and 1 vegetarian pie. For the veggies, I used 1 cup green beans, 1 cup carrots, 1 cup yellow potatoes and 1 cup corn. I also used veggie broth instead of chicken broth. It turned out so delicious! Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Very easy and delicious.  But, I had enough filling for  at least 3 instead of two pot pies.  I used what would not fit into the 2 pie crusts in a crustless pie pan and then added easy drop biscuit dough on top.  This 3rd version is my favorite.   Also, I did not have any celery seed so  I used "celery salt" instead and left out the "salt" called for in the recipe.  I highly recommend this recipe.  The pepper really adds a lot of flavor.

Very good. I made a few adjustments as my son has celiac and eats gluten free. I added mushrooms to the pan after the onions, I tossed in a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, I used a box of condensed gluten free cream of chicken soup and an equal amount of milk, it was too thin so I used about 1/3 cup of gf flour skipped the pie crusts and topped it with tater tots. Positive reviews from my children. I also reduced the butter by 1/3 cup. Definitely will make again! My freezer we my out and I had 3 turkeys in it!!  3 turkeys in a week one needs to be creative!

I'm novice cook, but I followed the directions faithfully and my leftover turkey pot pie turned out absolutely DELICIOUS!  I love that there was no canned soup involved!  And my friend who doesn't do VEGGIES voluntarily didn't even realize how many VEGGIES she devoured with two helpings of the pie!  I will definitely make this again and again and again!  Comfort food HEAVEN!

Perfect in every way.  I used poultry seasoning instead of Italian seasoning but that was the only change. I will be making this frequently.

This was delicious. I doubled the recipe and actually made 5 pies. I did not use frozen veggies (except for peas), so cooked them a bit in the sauce before putting in chicken. I also added some cut up butternut squash which added a touch of sweetness and deliciousness to the pies! I would definitely make this recipe again! Yummm!

I thought this recipe was phenomenal!! I made my own turkey broth from a turkey I cooked 2 nights  and used that instead of chicken broth. I also never have celery seed so I used more celery. Those were the only changes. I can't wait to make it again.  So yummy!!

This is a delicious way to use some of those turkey leftovers. It's a little time labor intensive as far as pot pies go, but it is worth every step. The only change I made to the recipe was using dill in place of celery seed, only because I didn't have any. It's so good that it makes us want turkey more than once a year. Thank you so much for sharing!

This was delicious. I cut the recipe in half since I didn’t have that much leftover turkey from thanksgiving. Instead of using frozen peas and carrots, I cut up some fresh carrots and some extra celery as well as some frozen corn. Turned out really yummy - however super rich! Next time I may just do a crust on top instead of bottom and top. Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Thumbs up from the kids and husband. I think it was better than having the bird on Thanksgivings. I skipped the celery but added corn and a bit of nutmeg. I misjudged how much pie crust you needed and ended up with too much filling. So we had the leftover filling with rice which was great too.

I made this with the leftover turkey and it was easy to make. The only modifications I made were to add diced potatoes and only use 1/2 cup of butter.  OMG this was spectacular. We ate one and froze one. I don't know how long it will stay frozen because we keep talking about how much we liked it. Thanks for sharing Rob.

This was great.  I only made one pot pie, not two as the recipe says.  I had to bake it on a cookie sheet to catch any spillover, but it was great!  My 91 year old father asked for seconds, and this is the man that we need to force to eat.

First time to make a turkey pie, turned out great.  Based on other reviews I added a pinch of sage, marjoram, thyme and 1/2 tsp poultry seasoning (in place of Italian seasoning).  I also sautéed celery with onions in butter, stirred in flour along with seasonings and then milk and chicken broth.  I did cook frozen vegetables in chicken broth and used that same broth to add to flour.  Used Pillsbury Pie Crust brushed with egg wash. I  baked 15 minutes at 425 degrees and then 35 minutes at 350 degrees.  No problem burning.  Was delicious, definitely a remake.  Would have easily served 8 adults.

Fantastic, easy recipe! I subbed half olive oil and half dairy free spread for the butter,  and almond milk for the milk. Instead of chicken broth, I used turkey stock that we made from the Thanksgiving turkey, and I think that really added to the flavor. Everything else was kept the same, and it turned out beautifully! This is seriously the best pot pie I've ever had. Darn good thing this recipe makes two!

Excellent, delicious recipe.  Like others, I used Pillsbury rolls to make a crust, next time I'll use the frozen ones or - gasp! make it from scratch.  I did change a few things besides the crust, I left out the Italian seasoning and added more sage and garlic, and changed coconut milk for the milk, and used unsalted butter.  Delish!  Next time I'd leave out the green beans and put in corn, my hubbies preference.

Followed the exact ingredients except instead of baking in pie crusts, I served it over croissants. I ate it without croissants & loved it! This is a new wintertime favorite in our home.

Amazing! Finally a great pot pie recipe.  I did boil the veggies in the broth as suggested by another reviewer and the video.  I used fresh produce and put a potato in as well.  The sauce was the key to this! I have tried so many recipes but this one is so easy and tastes great!

I've previously made the condensed soup version of pot pie. My only regret with this recipe is that I didn't find it sooner. I am never going back...this was fantastic! Great flexible recipe for holiday leftovers! I substituted some leftover gravy for some milk, used mixed frozen vegetables, and added some leftover oven roasted vegetables. Rave reviews from all who partook!

This is a great recipe to clear out all of your leftovers, not just turkey.  I pulled out half full bags of frozen veggies of all sorts until I had enough for the recipe.  I didn't have any celery, so I didn't use it.   Aside from using my own pie crust, I roughly stuck to the recipe.  

The wife and I were both blown away at how easily it came together.  This was my first pot pie of any sort and it turned out great.  I will definitely make this again.

I followed recipe as written except I had no Italian seasoning so I mixed in sage, thyme,rosemary ,oregano and basil in small cap to make my own “Italian” and added it to recipe. It came out great!! My husband took second pie to work and now I have to make two more. Awesome recipe thanks for sharing.

Delicious, although I ran out of time and didn't make the crust. I made it more of a casserole instead, and sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on top. It still came out great. I also added broccoli.

I halved the recipe for just one 9" pie and it worked out great.  Very easy.  I subbed Penzey's bouquet garni herb blend for the italian seasoning and it was delicious.  I added a little more liquid than called for, just eyeballed it for a consistency I liked.  I used Pillsbury refrigerated pie dough.  Very tasty!

This was a perfect post-Thanksgiving recipe. My husband loved it (he isn’t always enthusiastic about food he likes but mentioned how much he liked it several times) as did my mom. My dad likes those premade pot pies and was less excited about this...I think it was more veggies than he prefers. I used some leftover ham as well as turkey (but could have done fewer veggies and more meat to make him happy), but I used up a lot of carrots and celery left from the crudités plate, leftover green beans (fresh ones  that were extra I hadn’t needed for my casserole), a leftover pie crust and finished off my carton of chicken broth. I didn’t have a second pie crust to top it, so I made a butter, flour and Parmesan crumble topping and crossed my fingers...it turned out pretty well!  I’ll save this recipe to use again when I have leftovers to spruce up!

This is, simply put, the most delicious pot pie I have ever had. I made a few minor alterations though, nothing too major. First of all I halved everything since I was making this for a weekend of dinners for just myself. I also used frozen cubed potatoes instead of greenbeans (because greenbeans have no place in a potpie). For these I used unflavored hashbrown potatoes and boiled them with the pees and carrots, they turned out fine. I also used half and half instead of milk because I wanted a creamier gravy for my pot pie. It thickens quicker then milk, so just keep that in mind.

Big hit with the family. I did change the vegetables a bit - I used the peas and carrots, but subbed corn for the green beans, and added mushrooms. This will become a post holiday tradition.

This was my first time making a pot pie!  I needed something to do with my leftover turkey from Thanksgiving. This was amazing and so easy! The only thing I did differently was I used a bag of mixed veggies and cooked it in a 9x13 baking dish because I didn't have 2 pie pans. It had to cook about 10 min longer but other than that exactly by the recipe. Thank you so much, I will be making this again and again!

Excellent. I cut the butter to 2 Tb, and reduced the flour to about half a cup. I substituted various veggies and Italian seasonings that I had on hand. Everyone loved it.

I made dad's leftover turkey pot pie and it was a hit with the family! Another great idea to use those leftovers. The Italian seasoning was a welcome surprise. Who knew? Apparently, dad did! Thanks dad. I did add some parboiled potatoes in the recipe and just cut back a little on the veggies. It was very rich and great on a bitter cold day! We will use this recipe again, use chicken and next Thanksgiving use up some more turkey! A little bacon in there might be tasty, too. Yum.

This is hands down the Best pot pie I have ever had in my life! I took the recommendation of other and used the chicken broth to boil fresh carrots and celery, when they were almost fully cooked I threw in canned peas and corn, no green beans. Used the same water to make the  roux. The only addition to that was some garlic powder. The pot pie was perfect and not too runny! I will definitely be making this again.

I have made this pie every Thanksgiving for the last 5 years, and it never disappoints!! Everybody loves it and it's gone in the wink of an eye!  All I do different is add some garlic and a little more dark meat.  Fabulous!

This is the perfect recipe for a tasty pot pie! My husband isn't too complimentary of my cooking. He thanked me twice in one night! I consider that a win! The kids loved it too. I made it with all organic ingredients and used wheat flour instead of white.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I am not a baker, so bought ready made pie crust.  Followed the recipe except for boiling the veggies in the chicken broth and using that broth later as suggested.  Also added some garlic powder.  Filling was not runny at all.  Had one pie for dinner leaving yummy leftovers for next day and froze the other pie for later.  For some this may be obvious, but I wasn't sure whether to freeze cooked or uncooked.  After researching I decided to freeze uncooked so hopefully it'll turn out.

Definitely would make again! I added some potatoes but didn’t reduce the veggies and it was fine.  I did find it a bit brothy tasting-the chicken stock taste was pretty strong so I think I might add some beef broth next time. It was better the next day and I ate it for lunch and supper for three days and didn’t get tired of it.

Great recipe! I did make a few changes but still found this recipe to be the most flavourful of all the turkey pot pie recipes out there. I added an additional 1/4 cup turkey broth and I didn't have celery seeds or Italian seasoning so I added about 1.5 tbsp poultry seasoning, 1 tsp oregano, .5 tsp sage, and a pinch of chili powder because I like a bit of kick. These measurements are not exact as I usually add spices to the taste but the combination works! I also sauted the celery, peas, and carrots in butter because I find this tastes better than boiling and also preserves more nutrients! I wish I'd made two and frozen one!

Fantastic! I used a pie crust base and mashed potato top. I can’t eat onions or garlic but it tasted divine even without them. A new favourite in our house!

This is the 2nd time for this pot pie recipe . A couple of modifications, 1 added 4 smallish red cooked potatoes cut up. 
Oven at 425 for 15 minutes then turned down to 350 to finish. I cut down the amount of pepper in the second pies.- The rue makes this just moist enough and not runny. Made 1 to eat and it fed 4 with half left over for lunch. And 1 for the freezer.  I will do this again. and again.

great recipe - made 1/2 the recipe & we ate it for 2 nights!  I didn't make it into a pie;  we had it over biscuits.  I'm not a green bean fan so I used extra peas & carrots & cooked all the veggies in chicken broth.  I also had no Italian seasoning so I used a variety of other herbs(basil parsley sage oregano garlic).
This recipe was excellent!

As I was making this I realized that this recipe is almost identical to a chicken pot pie recipe that I make, also from this site. I knew then that this was going to be good. And it was. I used chicken instead of turkey and I doubled the sauce just as I do with the other recipe.

Great pot pie for turkey leftovers! The insides were nice and thick so they didn't sog the crust once the pie was cut (I so dislike when that happens!). I only had microwave in the bag frozen peas and carrots and they worked perfectly. I also had on hand some turkey soup I made yesterday so I used that broth instead of chicken broth. My picky teen daughters have requested this every time after we serve turkey.

Cooking for 2, I cut the recipe in half and as others I doubled the sauce and added diced potato as well as added garlic powder. Very yummy, it's been added to the revolving menu list!

Made it as described. Followed a reviewer's suggestion to cook veg in chicken broth, then added cooking broth to sauce. Came out perfectly! We loved it & plan to make again. Next time may add potatoes and/or mushrooms, but, really, it's just great as is. Thanks, 'Dad!'

This was really good and not difficult to make at all.  I used fresh carrots, garlic, added nutmeg and parmesan cheese to the sauce after it baked.  I cut the recipe in half.  I may add a whole onion next time because I really didn't taste the onion.

I've made this several times!! Very easy to follow and the flavor was fantastic!!  My only complaint was it was a little dry this last time.  I had pre-made the day before, so I don't know if the crust absorbed the moisture, but I will add more milk and broth next time.  I'll be making and sharing again.

Absolutely LOVED this recipe. My husband loves pot pies and gave this a THUMBS UP. I only did a couple of things differently. First, instead of store bought pie crusts I made my own (more work of course, but my family is a fan of my pies). Secondly, I started making the dish and realized I had no milk!! I used a smaller portion of half and half instead! It was a great substitution.

Turned out very good. Only two changes. I put in cubed potatoes instead of  green beans and used poultry seasoning instead of italian seasoning. I baked it all in a 9 inch deep casserole dish with only a top crust.  Next time I may increase the "gravy" by 1/3 to 1/2( the potatoes might have had an impact on that)  but as is was still very good.

This was fantastic!  Made it with my own pie dough.  The entire family loved it!  The inside is so good you could probably add a cup of chicken broth to it and make it into a cream of turkey soup!!

Really liked this. We make a version of this in tiny five inch pie pans so each person gets a little self contained pie on their plate, a prettier presentation but your recipe was better, so I am adjusting mine, well done.

Perfect way to use up leftover turkey from the holidays! Easy to make and very tasty. I used all fresh veg instead of frozen and cooked them in the chicken stock instead of water. Re-used the chicken stock when the recipe called for it.

LOVE this recipe for its simplicity & quick prep time. I usually start my filling with a roux but this way is so much easier - especially when you are trying not to use butter or other dairy products (I used sunflower oil & grapeseed oil to cook my onions).  I added rosemary, Vegeta (a dried vegetable & salt mixture), pinch of turmeric, curry & paprika to the spices listed but that's just preference of an eastern European woman :)  Thank you so much for this awesome recipe. You're right - this didn't last long at dinner time in my house :D

Love, love, love this recipe. I stuck to the format for how much milk, flour to use and portions of veg and meat. The sauce was spot on using your directions and the crust was perfect; it tried to brown quickly, but I used your tip for tin foil and that worked beautifully. Wish I had taken a photo, it was a perfect flaky golden brown. 
Now, for additions and changes. I added 1 tsp herbs de provence, 1/4 cup chopped flat leaf parsley, 1 chopped parsnip and a cubed potato. I used a cup of chopped fresh green beans, which I blanched by cooking them in the microwave in 4 tbsp water  in for 4 minutes before tossing them in the pot.
This was an awesome dish, wife is on her second helping now.  While I made some additions, it would not have turned out well if I hadn't followed the steps in the recipe. Well done! Thank you.

This is a great recipe.  I substituted a couple of the veggies with what I had on hand and it turned out great.  I think as long as you keep the ratio of butter, flour, broth and milk, you can add whatever your favorite pot pie veggies are and it will be dandy. The italian seasoning was a flavor I didn't particularly care for and I will leave that out the next time., but  definitely a keeper!

Made this delicious potpie again this year.  The seasonings in the sauce are just right - including the Italian seasoning.  Tonight for a change I used Green Giant frozen combo of broccoli, cauliflower and carrot, frozen corn, and sliced mushrooms.  But it is my personal opinion that the options listed  by the recipe provider are awesome.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Wonderful and very tasty.  I used store bought pie shells and frozen  mix of string beams, carrots and corn and added fresh organic celery. Fresh herbs from our garden. Only addition was 6 ounces of sliced white mushrooms.  Italian saeasoning a must! I simmered vegetables in chicken broth and drained in a colander set in a large pot and reserved broth for use in the sauce.Excellent!!

FIrst off, this was sooooo good, it definitely didn't serve 16, or even 8.  Everyone had seconds, and then we had a lunch of it the next day.  I think we got 7 "servings" - or 7 satisfied eaters - out of it.  

I didn't make it in two pie plates, as the recipe calls for.  I simply poured all the filling into a 9 x 13 baking dish and made my own pie crust.  After rolling out my crust into a 9 x 13 rectangle, I put it on top of the filling and baked my potpie that way.  Everyone loved it and the filling became the star without too much crust to outplay it.  

And this filling deserves star billing.  I made it exactly as the recipe calls for, and it was the BEST I've ever had bar none.  Truly delicious.  We will definitely have this again, whether or not there are turkey leftovers, because I can see making this with a rotisserie chicken when the mood strikes.  What a hit!

Great instructions.  Got the veggies on,  started the onions going. I added a little poultry seasoning and and some cream sherry to make the sauce a little richer.   

I only had one 9" pie plate so ended up using a 9x9 square pan as well which came out beautifully.

Was blown away by how how easy it was , how clean the flavors were, veggies perfect, crust flaky.  Heck, I want to cook turkey just to make this recipe.

Good and tasty way to use your leftover turkey. Good ratio of veggies to meat with just the right spices. I suggest you have the spices already measured out and ready to add to the butter and flour mixture.

Delicious and easy to make! I used turkey broth instead but probably tastes the same.

Amazingly simple and delicious!  I used a frozen vegetable mix that had corn also, because that's all I had.  Cajun spice because turkey was Cajun.  No other changes!

Everyone (including the kids) loved this.  I cut it in half and made just one pie and the amount was perfect.  Also, I substituted corn for peas because I didn't have peas and used turkey broth (homemade).   It held it's shape, wasn't too runny but wasn't dry either.   My only complaint is that it had a bit too much pepper for my liking.
Will definitely make again with turkey or chicken.

My family loves this.  It is a tradition with leftover Thanksgiving turkey.  We've also made it with leftover roast chicken.

I'm sure i will make this again, it was a very lovely recipe, also very simple for beginner cooks!  
Next time i think i will add a little more thyme and oregano.
P.s. I left out the green beens and just made it with  sweet peas, fresh carrots and celery

I made this for a get together last night and it was ah-mazing!  I will admit I didn't really measure my vegetables or turkey.  And I added a couple other seasonings to fit our tastes, but it was definitely super yummy!  Anytime I have left over turkey, I will for sure be making this.  In fact I might have my husband smoke me a turkey just so I can make this!

This recipe is fantastic!  This will be the third year in a row I've made it with turkey leftovers.  My boyfriend and I both work in the accounting field, so during tax season easy meals are essential.  I make 3 or 4 of these pies with thanksgiving leftovers, eat one and throw the rest in the freezer.   We always look forward to pulling them out and tossing them in the oven in February and March!

What a hit with our company tonight! I made a few modifications based on previous reviews and what I had on hand. I sauteed the celery with the onions, used the chicken broth to cook fresh green beans and carrots until crisp-tender, and just defrosted the frozen peas a little. The carrots really brightened up the broth to a wonderful color which in my opinion helped to make the finished product look nice. I didn't have celery seed, so substituted 2 teaspoons of Old Bay seasoning for the celery seed, salt and Italian seasoning. Thanks "dad" and the previous reviewers for such a great recipe!

Loved it.  I didn't boil my veggies, though.  I used frozen peas, fresh celery,  green beans, carrots and onions.  I sauteed them  (except for the peas) along  with the onions and celery.   Threw the peas in last.   I used the same spices, but a bit more than the recipe called for.  Turned out great!

Mmmmmmmmmm this is a very  very good recipe . When I made this recipe I didn't have any chicken broth but I did have some refrigerated turkey juice so I added a few table spoons to some hot water to melt the fatty juice and man oh man was this a deeeelicious pot pie.

This was delicious!  I love that it makes two.  We had one for dinner and I froze the other one for later.  Next time I will try using fresh veggies.  I think the frozen ones tend to get a little mushy.  This will definitely be a go to recipe when I have leftover turkey.

Changes I made: I used frozen mixed vegetables bags, and made the pie crusts from the mix in the bulk aisle at the grocery store.  I also used smaller tins so the heat and crust would be cooked more even with the food 5 in. tins.  Thank you for the recipe.

Really delicious. Modifications: SO and I don't agree on cooked celery or green beans, so swapped them for corn and extra peas and carrots. Added rosemary, salt, pepper, garlic, and a bit of marjoram to the filling. Used the flaky butter pie crust on here.

Fantabulous! I reduced the Italian spice by half as it was too overpowering, and added some quartered, sautéed, button mushrooms...PERFECT! It makes an awesome chicken pot pie too. Pick up a couple of rotisserie chickens - they cost the same as raw and you don't need your oven on for an hour. Use the carcass and veg trimmings to make your stock and then cook the veg in the stock.
I also use this to make turkey dinner pie - stuffing crust, filling, bit of gravy and topped with potatoes, Bake, slice into wedges and freeze for instant turkey dinner pie (just add cranberries).

I used the exact same base, which was delicious, but I made a separate crust.  I put the same base in a casserole dish and covered it with a crust batter of 1 cup each of flour, milk, and mayonnaise.  Cooked it, uncovered, at 350° for an hour and a half.

Let me begin by giving a big "Thank you to Rob Neil" I have never made a pot pie and have been saying for years that I wanted to make one with my tasteful left over turkey. This recipe is a keeper. I did it yesterday and my family loved it. I brought the other one into work and they loved it a s well. 
Thanks Rob!!!

This turned out great.  I used leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and use the turkey dripping instead of chicken broth.  It came out with exact consistency I was looking for.

Very good way to use Thanksgiving leftovers.  I especially liked it didn't call for any "cream of" soups.

This was a hit with my family.  Use some fried turkey which added extra flavor. I will make this again.

This recipe is not only delicious but it is also a great way to use up left over turkey from Thanksgiving. I only made a few changes. I used chicken broth to boil the frozen veggies instead of water, as suggested by another reviewer, which I think helped to add more flavor. I also used a bag of frozen veggies that had corn, carrots, green beans, and peas- any combo will work. I added some sliced mushrooms and about double the amount of onion it called for. Pillsbury pre-made pie crust worked wonderfully with this recipe. Enjoy! I know my family did!

This was fantastic! I used fresh vegetables that I had on hand leftover from Thanksgiving and I made it filling only.  I served it deconstructed one night with croissants and another night over toast. Both were delicious. I will definitely make this again!

I made it exactly like the recipe. I didnt change a thing. It was fabulous, it was not runny or dry. Full of flavor, moist, crust came out great. I gave one to a neighbor and my husband and I finished one. Made great leftovers reheated in the oven. I am going to do this with chicken next time I have left over chicken and just make one pie.

This was outstanding. I have tried to make pot pies before, but never with much luck. However, this one had the perfect consistency and tastes amazing. 
I used frozen mixed veggies instead of just peas and carrots, and added a can of corn and about 3/4 cup carrots. I only had one Pillsbury pie crust box on hand, so I formed those into the bottom of a 9x13 casserole dish and baked it for 10 minutes while preparing the filling. Then I used a Pillsbury Seamless Dough Sheet for the top. I don't think I'll ever go back to the regular pie crust top again!
Thanks so much for this recipe! Definitely a keeper I will make again and again.

Fantastic!! We prefer potatoes in ours, so I dice and boil a couple of potatoes along with diced carrots and Bremen beans. Can fill with whatever vegetables you like.

I followed the directions exactly except omitted the celery spice, I didn't have it. I cooked the vegetables in chicken broth then drained. This was my first attempt and my family loved it,  except for maybe too much pepper! Also I put two pieces crust in a 9x13 pan and covered with two pieces crust. Will definitely make again!!!

We had so much turkey left over and I had to find something to do with it.  I made this recipe and my whole family went mad for it.  I make turkey for Thanksgiving for my wife and for our guests.  My kids and I arent huge fans, but this recipe turned out fantastic.  Both of these pies didnt stand a chance around here.  We were almost fighting for the last bite.

It was great.  Only thing I did different was I used mixed veggies that included corn instead of what was listed.  Was just easier buying it that way.

We loved it!  This will be our new tradition as the 'day after' meal. 
I Made small modifications....
Lessen the amount of peas, carrots and green beans and add small cut potatoes. (I just think pot pies should have potatoes) I also added extra meat. I love my turkey gravy and wanted to use it up, so I added that to the gravy that this recipe made. I like it more saucy anyway. I brushed an egg white wash across the top before baking for appearance. The recipe doesn't say whether or not to place on a cookie sheet, but my gut told me to. I've had too many raw crust with regular pies in the past when I didn't use one. Baked at 425 for 15 minutes then 30-35 min at 350. Enjoy!

I didn't add celery, added potatoes, used the turkey broth from the Thanksgiving turkey to boil veggies and used it in filling.  It was a bit strong on pepper at first but after cooking it, it seemed to mellow.  I used a casserole dish to make one big pie, used the same amount of time to cook.

Delicious!!! I halved the recipe and wish I hadn't!! The changes I made were I used fresh veggies instead of frozen and I added diced potato and a little sage. My leftover turkey was smoked so it gave a nice flavor. My husband wishes I'd made the sauce runnier but my son and I both really like that it's thick - I love that I cut it and it didn't run all over. Definitely making again although I'm not waiting till next Thanksgiving to use left over turkey!!! Will make it with chicken.

I sauted the onions and celery together in the butter instead of putting the onions with the boiled veggies. Subbed diced fresh carrots for frozen, added the last few TBS of turkey gravy to the mix, used herbs de provence instead of suggested spices, and used my leftover green beans that had almond slices - diced the whole thing  - then used a 13 x 9 pan and just put crust on the top - IT WAS AWESOME! Great recipe :-)

I made this tonight for my husband and I and a friend that is laid up with a broken hip.  This recipe is fantastic.  So tasty.  I had to add a little more milk as it was very very thick.  My husband said it needed a little more salt, but I'd hold off and salt it at the table.  I really love pot pies, but have never had a home made one.  Seriously, this was really good.

Made 1/2 the recipe, I only wanted 1 pie. I used 1/2 cup onion, and 1/2 cup celery cooked in 4 tbsp butter. Followed  the rest if the recipe pretty closely. I used Kroger pie crusts, and poured in creamy turkey and veggie filling.  Baked for 30 min @ 425. So good.

Skipped the onion powder, celery seed, and Italian herbs and used some poultry seasoning, salt, and pepper instead. I like more onions, so I added more onions. It seems very, very thick to me so I thinned it out with more stock and milk by eye. Makes quite a bit. If I were to make it again, I might add a boullion cube to the stock to make it stronger, store bought stock just doesn't really have much of a flavor. I just need a little more meatiness for my tastes.

This is unbelievably good. I did use mixed vegetables .  Other than the one change, the recipe was followed exactly.  I am thinking that next time I'll skip the turkey dinner and go straight to the pot pie.

It. Is. Amazing. I've made it 3 times, each time with some small mods: I use Kowalski's rotisserie chicken instead of turkey (their rotisserie chicken is the best!!). I change the seasonings in the following way: no celery seed (I just double the amount of raw celery and decrease amount of other vegs proportionally, also I skipped the green beans and instead put in more peas and carrots), no onion powder and no Italian seasoning. Same amount of salt and pepper, add sage (fairly generous) sparing oregano and generous thyme, to taste.  The first time I made it I used wheat flour and cow milk. Delicious. Second two times I have used butter still but swapped out the flour for white rice flour and the milk with unsweetened non-vanilla (unflavored) almond milk to accommodate my low tolerance of wheat and dairy. It worked great. Seriously, thank you so much for posting this recipe! I am a pot pie fanatic, and it's amazing to be able to make my own and to have it be actually perfect tasting and much more healthy than most pot pies in the freezer section. Making an easy oil crust (with grapeseed) instead of using butter in my crust or store-bought crust, is another way I've kept the health quotient up and some of the fat and cholesterol down and modified it to be gluten free. I have made a half recipe each time and it's worked out well. I sometimes have had to add more broth and milk to keep the sauce liquidy enough, or it has just been a thicker but still delicious sauce.

I pretty much followed the recipe but I chopped up a whole small onion (rather than measure), added some diced potato, used 2 large fresh carrots and then about 1/2 cup frozen peas, eliminated the green beans (only because I didn't have any) and for the seasoning used just salt, pepper and about 1/2 a tbsp of herb du  Provence. I cooked my veggies in the broth, then added everything to the onion, butter/roux mixture without draining (used about 1/2 cup butter instead of 2/3 c). Stirred in my leftover turkey and herbs and then used a deep dish pie plate to make one large pie.  Everyone raved about how good this was!

AMAZING!!!!  This is an excellent recipe!!!  My husband loved it!!!  I didn't have peas or carrots on hand, so I used corn, green beans and celery.  I, have never been a fan of pot pies.  Since making this, I now LOVE THEM!!!  Easy, affordable and super delicious!!!!!  Thank you!!!!

Excellent Turkey pot pie and so easy. If you only want to make one and have some leftover filling, it can get thinned with a bit more chicken broth, and put with some small size pasta for an excellent soup! This has all the comfort in this recipe.

This was so delicious! I followed the recipe, except I didn't cook the veggies first, I only defrosted them, and I added bullion to the chicken broth. 

So yummy and I will definitely will make it again!

This pot pie is delicious and perfect for using up the left-over thanksgiving turkey. Very tasty, fairly easy, and you can make your own crusts if you want. I will definitely make this again.

This was wonderful.  I used a mixture of veggies (just what I had on hand) onion, mushroom, zucchini, squash, red pepper, asparagus... instead of following the recipe exactly.  Turned out so good that my bf raved it was one of his all time favorite meals (and he's a foodie).

This is a fabulous recipe.  I made it with leftover turkey after Thanksgiving and again with a leftover rotisserie chicken.  It works well with any frozen vegetables.  My family and neighbors love it!

I used sage and summer savory instead of italian seasoning and also added potatoes into the vegetables cooked.  I had some left over gravy as well and added that into the sauce mixture.  Delicious!

I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as it instructed. Downed the butter a hair and I upped all the ingredients a little bit because we are a family of six. Actually added extra, extraTurkey. Instead of using chicken broth I use leftover turkey gravy and instead of using milk, I used leftover gravy again. This was the best turkey pot pie ever and my family said it was bomb!  My family loved it! Can't wait to try it with chicken, beef and pork!

loved this recipe!  I didn't have some of the ingredients so, I substituted extra onion for onion powder and dill for celery seed.  I also added a little extra salt and a splash of sherry.  Awesome!

Absolutely delicious. Made it the first time as written, only with just peas and carrots (2 cups of each so total vegs were same). Obviously any vegs you prefer would work. Loved it. After first time, I doubled the sauce, including celery,  onions (which I precooked in microwave), and spices. I think I may cook the carrots in the microwave for a minute as well just to soften a bit. We put it in a big casserole dish since it's too much for pie pans, and put crust on top and bottom. Oh, I also boil the chicken (usually use a whole one, or breast w/ bones)  w/ onion, celery, carrots, salt, pepper, garlic, etc. and use this as the broth. Love this recipe! We've made this so many times that I need to reprint the recipe. It's looking a bit ragged.

I will definitely make this again. It was absolutely delicious! I made two changes. First I used a large bag of mixed vegetables instead of peas and carrots and string beans. And I didn't have chicken broth so I used a can of cream of mushroom and added some water to dilute.  Everything else I followed the instructions. Hubby and my girlfriend loved it too. It's  definitely a keeper.

This recipe  was way beyond my skill set, but I thought I'd give it a try anyway.  My husband and my dad thought it was one of the best  dishes I've ever made.  I'm through with canned cream of chicken soup!  This dish was so good that the three of us ate a 9inch pie at one sitting, with 1 small piece left. The only thing I would do differently next time is to use one crust. Too "crusty" for us. Yummy!!!

My family loves it when I make this pot pie.  I used to just make it after Thanksgiving with all of the leftovers but I have now even started using chicken breast because it is so well liked here. For one pie I use an entire bag of Alexia frozen mixed vegetables, one cup of chopped celery, and half of an onion. Everything else I follow on this recipe.  My husband always ends up putting more salt on it - I think it's just right.

This recipe was fantastic, very flavorful.  I cut down the butter, used more carrots and peas and skipped the green beans because that's how I prefer it. This is the closest recipe to the one I grew up with I could find online and I was not disappointed.

This was delicious!! I made some changes since I only made 1 pie.  I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables and warmed them up with the cold leftover turkey along with beef stock.  I drained the mixture and added some potatoes that i cooked in the microwave.  I used powdered onion in place of cooking the onions but made the roux all the same.  I added a little tumeric to the mixture along with the other seasonings.  I think next time I make it I'm gonna try to make my own pie dough.  This was really easy to make and the video added a nice touch of helpfulness!!  My 8 year old daughter requested that I add how much she loved!

This was yummy!  I did some alterations in the veggies, using frozen corn, peas and broccoli instead of frozen carrots and green beans since we didn't have any of those on hand.  Still worked like a charm.

The filling is exceptional - really tasty with no one seasoning overpowering any other.  I made my own pie crusts with schmaltz and celery seed and I only made two. We do non-dairy so I used Earth Balance for the butter and cashew milk in place of cow milk.    Very yummy!  We used 2 C baking tins to make little lunch servings and put the crust only on the top for less pastry/calories since they're so small.   This recipe produced 9 little healthy servings of pie. I'm so glad I tried this recipe - it's a keeper.

This was so delicious! Definitely going to be a tradition after Christmas from now on. I usually modify any recipe, so I did use half evaporated milk and half water to substitute  whole milk; I sautéed the celery with the onions; and used  2 cubes of chicken bouillon instead of chicken stock but dissolved in the same amount of stock recipe called for.  Yummy! :)

Best pot pie ever! Used leftover turkey and the turkey gravy instead of chicken broth and substituted small steamed potatoes for green beans and celery. Family declared it the best turkey pie ever tasted.

This was excellent!! I read quite a few of the reviews before making it and used 'Giardino' s idea and cooked the Veggies in the Chicken Broth and used 'terryberry' s idea of brushing with an Egg Wash (but I also lightly salted the top Crust -- which I do to homemade Breads, Rolls, Cornbread, etc). I ended up using 2 Cups of frozen Mixed Vegetables (Peas, Carrots, Green Beans and Corn) and added 1 Cup of diced Potatoes and upped the Onion to 1 full Cup. Kept the seasoning exactly per Recipe. Thank You,'Dad' for a wonderful use of leftover Turkey :) I have one carefully wrapped in both Cling Wrap and then Foil for another meal. I am a Happy Camper now!!

Superb!  Read all the reviews and incorporated some, added a low carb twist.  First, any veg will do - use what you have fresh or frozen, even canned.  Second, include the celery leaf in the recipe (especially if you don't have celery seed on hand).  Next, 1/2 cup butter was definitely sufficient and cuts down on the fat.  Boil the veg in the broth called for in the recipe rather than water to infuse the broth flavor, and incorporate that into the recipe.  Low sodium broth works just fine.  If you are a garlic fan, add some.  Alternatives to pie crust:  top with mashed potatoes OR smashed cauliflower seasoned with s&p, butter and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle either with paprika for color.  You will not be disappointed!

I've made this 3 times, since Thanksgiving... Just this year alone! They keep asking for it! I subbed diced potatoes for the peas (someone doesn't like peas) and used fresh carrots and half and half (same someone finished the milk off with cereal). But it turned out so great that I just keep on making it this way. Fantastic!

Swapped corn starch instead of flour and celery tops instead of seed.   Also used lima beans instead of green beans.  Probably helped that  I used brown sugar cured turkey for left overs as well.  My 4 year old ate 3 helpings.  Enough said!

My first attempt at making a pot pie. The instructions were easy to follow and it tastes great!  This, so far, is the best turkey pot pie I have tasted and I made it so I can have it again. Can't wait to make it for family and friends. Highly Recommend this!

Great recipe, very easy to make.  I cut the recipe in half. The only changes I made, I used celery salt instead of celery seeds only because i didn't have any.  I also boiled the veggies in chicken broth and made my own pie crusts.  I would make this again.

I made this using the "adjust" feature for 1/2 the ingredients.  Instead of putting it into the large dishes, I used three deep-dish ready-made crusts.  I cut two of them into quarters and pressed each quarter into one of eight Pyrex glass custard dishes.  Spooned equal amounts of the filling into each, rolled out the third crust thin and cut it into eight circles to fit the dishes as the top crust.  I still baked it the same temp. and time but DID have to put foil over top of them for 15 of the minutes to avoid over-browning the crust.  THEY ARE FANTASTIC and will work great for lunches!  Wish I could upload a photo because they not only look delicious but cute too!  :-)

Made this 3 times in the last month, including using chicken breast if I didn't have leftover turkey.  Turkey's definitely better, but chicken works great too.  Loooooove this recipe, fantastic!

I modified it by removing the green beans. I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk. I deleted salt, but used celery salt. I used red and sweet onion mixed and a splash of  Siracha powder spice for tang. This was very yummy and family liked it. Will make it again.

We all loved this! I used all fresh vegetables except  peas. Used 3 tablespoons margarine instead of butter.  I filled a baking dish with the ingredients and topped it with Pillsbury Grands. I cut the biscuits in half before placing on top.

No changes - made it just like the recipe calls for. Really good!!!  Family loved it. Easy to do. Variations could be variation on veggies, ground beef using beef broth, chicken instead of turkey. Very, very good. Would be ready to serve this to company or take as a meal to a friend in need.

Delicious! Only change I made was adding Bell's Poultry seasoning and some garlic powder. Elimated Italian seasoning and onion powder.  Will definitely make again but will increase the amount of the white sauce.

We loved this and both went back for seconds!  The taste is great! I used Pillsbury pie crusts and I used fresh organic carrots with frozen petite peas, frozen  corn, and frozen cut green beans. I also added dried sage and dried dill. 
Next time I want to make it creamier so I will increase the sauce, will use fresh corn and fresh dill as well.

Might use less black pepper.  Served with cranberry sauce on side -- delicious.

Fabulous! I agree with another reviewer to cut the butter to 1/2 cup. The flavor of this is perfect--not too overbearing and not bland, either.

I LOVE this recipe!! I'm obsessed with the Marie Calendars kind, and this is BETTER if you can believe it. I simmered the veggies in the chicken stock instead of water. And I used the mixed veggies from Costco which are yellow squash, broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. I will definitely be making this again. It's amazing. I wish I could give it more stars!

We just finished eating this.  Very tasty!  We both loved it. Only thing I did different was to saute the veges instead of steam and increase the amount spices from 1/2 tsp to 2.  You may want to make more gravy than it calls for.  Yum!

We just finished eating and I have to say that this is the best pot pie that I have ever had. I have tried many pot pie recipes and they all lacked something, except this one. I have to confess, most of the other recipes used cream of something soup. This was well worth the little extra effort for the homemade taste. I wasn't sure about the celery seeds or the Italian seasoning but I believe in making the recipe exactly as instructed the first time. Turns out those were the flavors that I didn't know I was looking for. I made 1 pot pie tongiht and am going to freeze the rest for another time. Thanks for the recipe, it will definitely go into the "make again" pile!

Through in leftover broccoli and cauliflower, chopped scallions and two crumbled slices of leftover bacon.  Rolled out my own crusts.  Everyone enjoyed these pot pies.

Halved the r cope to make 1 pot pie and it tasted great. Reduced milk by a little bit to ensure thicker filling consistency and it worked out perfectly. Kids and hubby approved!

I made this with leftover Thanksgiving turkey and it turned out delicious! I cut the recipe in half and put it in a casserole dish. I used a Betty Crocker pie crust mix and it turned out perfect! I will definitely make this again and just use cooked chicken breast.

This recipe was great, but I can't say that I completely followed it. I started out by eliminating celery and changing frozen green beans to canned. Instead of boiling I sauteed all of the vegetables together and then took them out to make the gravy. Really I just used this as a base recipe.

Usually we don't eat "Pot Pies" but had a lot of leftover Turkey. I decided to try this recipe one time.  Well, I have since made this recipe using  Turkey or Chicken many times.  This recipe is perfect exactly as written - it's simply outstanding!  I have made this recipe for company several times, they had to have the recipe before they left for the evening.

This was THE BEST pot pie ever!! I actually already had a recipe for pot pie and replaced it with this one. This recipe would be very hard to beat. I did replace the peas with corn because I'm not a big fan of peas. The recipe is versatile and I believe you can really use whatever veggies that you want and still come out with great results.

This is a family favorite, especially among my kids.  I omit the green beans, and make it dairy free (due to food allergies) by substituting rice milk .  No one can tell the difference.  I've made  other pot pie recipes, and this is still the favorite.

I'm about to make this recipe for the 4th time. Everyone loves it. I asked my neighbor how much I owe him for some help he gave me with my yard, and he said he just wanted me to make the turkey pot pie again. I'm going to have to start making more at one time because last time I gave one to my neighbor, my husband kinda got upset!! I boil my veggies in the broth and just set it aside and I use a little more than the called for amount of broth and milk just because I like a little creamier filling. It's soooo much better than the store bought, air filled, tough turkey pot pies. Thank you so much for sharing the recipe.

I have never reviewed a recipe on here, but I had to with this one. This is so delicious - best pot pie I've ever eaten! And a great way to use up all the leftovers from Thanksgiving. I used more carrots and corn instead of beans because I had them already cooked. I also cooked the celery and frozen peas in chicken broth as per another reviewer's recommendation. Absolutely fantastic!

Excellent Flavor. The only thing I'd do is  make a bit more gravy...more milk/broth/Flour. I added left over mushrooms too. Will make it again!

I found this recipe last year when my husband (fiancee last year) cooked a very large turkey before Thanksgiving and didn't want to get bored with eating leftovers. We fell in love with it!! I replaced the turkey with chicken to see how it would taste. It's just as good!!!

I've never made pot pie, and this was easy and excellent!  I used chicken instead of turkey, but the filling smelled just like Thanksgiving Day. My family devoured it.  I was going to make my own pie crust, but ran out of time and used store bought. We will DEFINITELY make this one again!

This is the best pot pie ever. I used chicken and increased the gravy portion of the recipe as we like it a little runnier. I make up a bunch of single serve pies-throw them in the freezer and it makes a quick easy meal after work. Delicious.

I had to change a few things. I made it with chicken because the store didn't have turkey. I added sliced Portabella mushrooms and Toney's seasoning. I couldn't find my garlic powder so I just left that out. I have to say this was the best pot pie I've ever eaten. My new son-in-law has this thing when he really likes a food as he eats and enjoys that first bite he wiggles (mostly his butt). This got a big butt wiggle and he came back for seconds. I will definitely will be making this again!

Absolutely delicious! Ten stars in my opinion! I made these with the leftover Thanksgiving turkey and froze them, unbaked. I also froze leftover sweet potatoes and dressing. A few weeks later, we had all the comfort and flavors of Thanksgiving dinner with no effort at all.

I have made this twice now. It is awesome! Both kids ate it too. I used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. This time I diced a baked potato too. 
Thanks for a great recipe.

Great recipe ! Followed it pretty much exactly and it turned out perfect. Great flavour and great way to use up some of the holiday turkey. Glad it made 2 pies since the first one went so fast.

My husband made this recipe with leftover Christmas turkey. He followed the recipe to the letter and while it was good, the flavour lacked depth.

This was the best pot pie I've ever had. I even screwed up and completely forgot to add the milk, and somehow it was still GREAT! Next time I'll add maybe half the milk, since I liked it thick. I also swapped the green beans for potatoes and added some fresh thyme, sage, and parsley as a personal preference.

I did not have pie crusts around the house today so I just mixed up some Bisquick and poured it over the top of the casserole but the contents were awesome and enjoyed by all. I almost always omit the salt in recipes like this and I definitely did NOT miss the salt.

Made this with leftover holiday turkey and it was perfect! We used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables that included corn, but other than that, followed the recipe exactly. We usually find SOMETHING that needs to change in a recipe, but we wouldn't change a thing with this one! This will be a new post-holiday tradition.

Family approved. All liked Pillsbury GF crust. Daughter preferred it to be chicken.  Also added corn. Used canned peas/carrots. Made a little extra sauce. Will maybe add potatoes next time.

Just took the pies out of the oven and can't wait for dinner.  I used the Butter Flaky Pie Crust recipe by Dana on this site and OMG...fantastic!!!  This is the third time making this recipe and will definitely be a regular for us.

This recipe is a great base. I doubled the entire recipe with the following changes.  I used fresh carrots and doubled the amount of herbs. I added about 1 1/2 cups fresh crimini mushrooms and sauteed the onions, carrots, celery, and mushrooms to take advantage of the flavor from the carmelization. I used two 11 X 13 inch  pans and used only a top crust to lighten it up.  I put in about 2 to 3 tablespoons of curry powder into half of the filling so I have a different taste for the second pie.  My have four kids and husband devoured it.

I would make a couple of changes next time.  I would like a little more of the gravy for the mix so I would up that slightly.  I did use puff pastry on the top which worked out very nicely and I used the vegetable water for the chicken stock.  I was able to drastically reduce the amount of butter (by about 75%) I used by simply adding the flour to the cooled broth and milk rather than to the onion and butter mix they suggest.

Great recipe I've made with Turkey and chicken both turned out great whole family loves. I'm lactose intolerant and substituted milk for almond milk and it still came out great with a nice thick sauce my husband couldn't tell.

Se delicious! I used puff pastry (because it's my greatest guilty pleasure!), and blind baked it for about 10 minutes before putting the filling in. I also replaced frozen veggies with fresh - carrot, corn and mushrooms. I made it as one large pie rather than 4 small ones. I had left over pie filling so froze it and then made a smaller pie from it last night which also turned out great. Thanks for sharing this one! It's now on my favorites list! Next time I plan to make it with chicken.

Fantastic.  I did increase the chicken broth to about 2 1/4 cups so it wouldn't be so thick, per other reviews.  I'll go to 2 1/2 next time, as it was still pretty thick.  I also added more turkey and salt.  Truly wonderful flavor.  My husband, who didn't think he'd like it, went back for seconds.  Definitely a new favorite, and a must for leftover Thanksgiving turkey (which I'd previously frozen).

It made a great pot pie! I didn't have the celery seed, so I used celery salt, but it still tasted a little bland. I added a tsp. of sage and it was perfect. Will definitely make this again.

I reduced this recipe to make 1 pie instead of 2 and we LOVED it!! 
I did make two changes... 1) I made this in an 8 1/2 inch deep dish "cover and carry" aluminum pan. 2) I increased the milk by about 1/3 more milk.
I will most definitely be making this recipe again. I am also going to be sure to include it in the recipe binder I am making for my youngest son.

I made this recipe for the first time last night, and it came out great.  I didn't have any Italian seasoning, but I had everything else, and it was wonderful.

Yummy quick and easy.. First time I have ever made pot pie. I'll definitely  make it again. I used fresh carrotts & celery, frozen peas and green beans.  I did not have celery seed or onion powder....still awsome without.

Great recipe, although I changed it a bit. I added diced potatoes, cooked all of the vegetables in chicken stock, didn't let the bechamel get quite so thick and I nixed half of the seasonings, adding fresh thyme and rosemary. It was delicious!

This was to die for good! I substituted the green beans for potatoes (that's what I had handy) and it was amazing! If you add potatoes like I did I would add about 1/4 cup extra milk.

This was fantastic! I made a slight modification, instead of a bottom crust, I used leftover mashed potatoes.  (trying to clean out the leftovers).  I will definitely make it again, and try it with the double crusts. Yum!

Lin, don't know where your taste buds are at, but this recipe is great. I used it for the first time last year after Thanksgiving,and it was so good, I'm back this year to make another one. Thanks.

This was by FAR the BEST turkey pot pie recipe I have ever had AND made.  It was so good it even prompted me to leave this review!  I’ve been using allrecipes.com for YEARS and never left a review!  That being said, this is what I changed:  INSTEAD of the (2) cups frozen peas and carrots and (2) cups frozen green beans I added:  (1) cup frozen peas, (1) cup frozen carrots, (1) cup frozen green beans and (1) cup frozen corn.  I boiled the frozen veggies and celery in the chicken stock instead of water, as mentioned by someone else to save the nutrients.  Simply drained and kept the stock for the next steps – I had to add a little more stock to what was left because of boil-off though.  I omitted the celery seed because I didn’t have any, but added about 1/8 tsp of Ground Nutmeg for flavor.  HANDS DOWN DELICIOUS!

Excellent! My 14 year old son loved it. Thought the thick filling was just right. Only modifications: didn't do the celery or celery seed spice because I just don't like celery. Used refrigerated Pillsbury crust and came out great.

My husband had this vision of Turkey Pot PIE, and wow I pulled it off thanks to this one of a kind recipe!!! It will be our post Thanksgiving treat! I boiled the veggies in chicken broth as well and cooked the onion in the same pot as I did the veggies to try and soak up all that flavor! We did not have Italian seasoning on hand so I used Julio's Mexican seasoning and it did the job!

Pies are in the oven, and I'm sitting here eating the extra filling for breakfast! What did I add? Potatoes... while i was grocery shopping I realized this seemed to be missing from the recipe... then I forgot to buy the celery! Oh well, it's still delicious. I used the frozen pre-paned pie crust for the bottom and the kind you unroll for the tops, (because I guess I don't own any pie pans!)

This filling is simply delicious as-is.  I use my own homemade pie pastry and include a good pinch of dried thyme in the dough.  I prefer, however, to roll out and fill individual pot pies and freeze them for another time.  A double-crust pastry recipe plus this filling netted me 10 pot-pies that bake up from frozen at 375º for about 50 minutes.  Great use of leftovers, and I use any combination of peas/carrots/beans/corn for the veg, keeping the qty per the recipe.

Awesome....cannot wait for Thanksgiving to have again.  The only thing I would add was additional milk as the sauce is really thick...but otherwise this is a WINNER.

This recipe is so good. I love that the recipe included a "from scratch" sauce. The only change I made was adding a two left over potatoes that I had from the night before. The gravy/sauce is delicious and I think I'll make just the sauce again for biscuits and gravy.

Super yummy! The seasoning is spot on and so is the consistency. We used the veggies we had on hand and did a bottom pie crust and a drop biscuit top. No leftovers of this one. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a family favorite!! I have made this several times different ways depending on how much time I have. You can use fresh, frozen or canned veggies. I have used chicken, turkey or beef. I never have leftovers of any!! You can also make it the night before and just pop in the oven to save time. I have also cooked one and froze one and cooked it about 3 weeks later and it was still GREAT!!

My family loves this dish. House smells so great when it's cooking. The best result was with a highly flavored smoked Turkey someone had sent us for Christmas. I added a little liquid smoke when I made with regular roasted turkey. Still delicious but not quite as flavorful. Will up the onions and herbs next time and make sure my roux is slightly brown before adding veggies. Love that there are no potatoes in it. Can add those on the side when feeding teenaged boys, and pass on them for myself.

I made a version of this and my family loved it. Instead of making 2 Pies I made one big casserole in an 11x17 shallow roasting pan. I used 2 Crusts on the bottom and two on the top. I had 9 to feed. I didn't measure anything and opted to not add milk. a few tbsp of flour (4ish)and lots of butter to fry the onions and veggies in. For spice I did poultry seasoning , salt and ground pepper. Added 4 cups of stock and added potatoes .  I

This is great! The spices were perfect. I substituted my turkey stock from my roasted turkey, and added 1/2 cup fat free half and half and it was the perfect consistency. I used diced parsnips, carrots, potatoes, corn, and celery that I par cooked in the microwave with a little bit of water to preserve nutritional value. I also used pearl onions that I sautéed in only 1/3 cup of butter. I used puff pastry on the top of 4 ramekins and one full pie. The best pot pie ever!

The filling is amazing! My favourite way to make this pie is with fresh carrots (half a bunch), red potatoes, and fresh green beans.  I also have a tendency to make mini pies or pasties out if it.  Last time I didn't have enough turkey so I also added a can of chicken... It was perfect! I will be using this filling recipe for other pies as well

This turned out PERFECT!  I had never made a pot pie before and this was simple easy and tasty. (And fortunately I had all the seasonings in the cupboard!)  I didn't have frozen veggies but substituted steamed fresh and it all turned out perfectly fine.  Like the description says, 'It won't last long'!!  You might want to consider making 2 or more.

Made this recipe tonight.  I was looking for a recipe for leftover turkey that didn't use any of the Cream of soups.  I used a bag of mixed veggies as others have stated and put in some Poultry Seasoning.  My family really liked it.  The only thought was that there was too much pepper in it.  I call this a Keeper Recipe - just would use less pepper and some Poultry Seasoning next time.

Absolutely wonderful!!!  Easy and adjustable.  I didn't have frozen green beans so I used a full bag of frozen peas and fresh carrots that softened with the celery.  Only took about 30 minutes to prepare so about 1hr with bake time.  The family loved it!  I will definitely add this to my collection of favorite recipes

This recipe is fabulous!  I followed it almost exactly and it came out perfectly (and I am NOT a cook by any means). I couldn't find a pea/carrot mix so I used frozen peas and large frozen sliced carrots.  The pie wasn't runny at all, which had been reported by another poster.  I made one pie and froze the remaining mixture.  I microwaved the frozen mixture tonight; we are eating it without pie crust.  It's like a very thick and delicious turkey stew.  It's perfect for a cold winter night in Ohio!

Except for using a bag of mixed vegetables and letting it just thaw instead of cooking it  I followed the recipe exactly..First pot pie I ever made and will probably be the only one ever make..this was awesome. Especially liked the fact the filling was not runny.

Excellent.  Others' suggestions were helpful:  cooking vegetables in broth and reserving for sauce is easy and nutritious.  I  also used a top crust only, to cut on pastry and calories- the filling is so delicious you don't miss it.  I had to increase the milk a little to obtain a proper consistency for the sauce; if not the sauce is too thick.  The extra milk makes the sauce just right, not runny.  Delicious with turkey or chicken.  Hint:  watch heated butter and onions carefully so it does not brown.  Very easy and welcome on a cold winter's night!

Just made this with our leftover turkey. I didn't have celery seed so used celery salt instead and lowered the amount of salt by half. I also used a bag of frozen mixed vegetables. So good and simple!

Made this tonight. I cooked regular carrots, cooked for 25 min, and added them instead of the beans. I also used bob's red mill all purpose flour (cup4cup) to make it gluten free. Turned out perfect. I will try using summer savoury instead of the Italian seasoning, next time, to try and recreate my hubby's favourite maritime turkey pie. Excellent recipe as is.

I haven't finished it yet, but I know it's going to be good.  This is a very forgiving recipe. I did not use more than one pot, just sautéed the veggies adding them one at a time.  The rutabaga that I added was a little too firm.  No problem, I just turned the flame on low and simmered until tender.   I added a little ground savory and took advantage of my late harvest CSA share.  I substituted butternut squash for carrots, grated celeriac for celery, etc.  I have already tasted the filling, and mmmm....

Thank you for this recipe!

A little dry, but adding a little 1/2 and 1/2 made it perfection! Will be a must-do for leftovers in future.

I made this and loved it. One bad comment was that is was too dry; I will add less flour next time, but only a little less. I added fresh garlic to the onions, celery and butter and used fresh carrots and potatoes. Another complaint was not enough veggies. Next time, I'll substitute another cup of veggies for one of the cups of turkey/chicken. Although, I don't know that I'd recommend that to others; this was pretty fantastic the way it's written. If you have big veggie eaters in your house like I do then, yes, add more veggies.

This is a great recipe!  I only had one crust so I just used it for a top crust.  I used half-and-half instead of milk.  My family loved it!  Thanks for sharing it!

Next time I'd like to have a little more liquid, but the flavor was good.  I added lots of veggies: peas, celery, carrots, onions, leeks, mushrooms as well as leftover turkey.  Very good!

This was wonderful! I added more liquid (chicken stock & milk) for the right consistency, as I found the recipe to be too thick. I also used cubed potatoes & fresh carrots (1 cup each) My family loved it!

I almost never review recipes, but I gotta say that this was a truly fine recipe.  I gave one of the pies to my daughter, and served the other to 5 friends.  The comments were the same in all cases--everyone loved it.  Easy and yummy.

One word: UNBELIEVABLE! I put brushed whisked egg all over the raw crust which makes it evenly golden brown. The roux is perfect, makes the dish. I have made countless pot pies that don't even come CLOSE. You will NOT be disappointed with this!

This was deeeelicious!  I used a handful of garlic and fresh parsley instead of italian seasoning and cornstarch  instead of flour. Also, no butter and I used frozen veggies. I'll be making this again soon. Thanks for sharing.

If I could give this a 10 I would... so delicious... of course I made some little changes....added potatoes, sauted mushrooms, used fresh green beans and carrots, added a splash of white wine to the sauce, omitted onion powder and last but not least, egg washed the crust to obtain a glossy crust. I realize that this seems like a lot of changes, but that is what makes this such a great recipe. You can add just about anything you'd like....you can't ruin this.  I will make this over and over again... maybe with chicken next time.

Very good way to use up the turkey!  We halved the recipe so it was good for one meal for the 4 of us.  I did find that the gravy was very thick and I had to just about double the amount of chicken broth.  Not a problem and still tasted great!

so I halved the recipe for a single pie. I also used broccoli instead of peas, carrots, and green beans, because of preference. I skipped the celery salt because I didn't have it, and substituted heavy cream for the milk to make the mixture thicker. It was done in 35 minutes, and everyone else thought it was great. I felt it was bland, but that could have been because I was mentally comparing it to the cheesy Marie Calender's pot pies. Next time I'd add carrots as well as more onions and mushrooms, and I'd try it with chicken instead of turkey.

UPDATE: I made it again to use up a rotisserie chicken, with a bunch of mods. Used 2c frozen carrot/broccoli/cauliflower mix for the veggies, skipped the celery, did 1/2 c. onions, added 5 sliced mushrooms, and kept the heavy whipping cream instead of milk (though I would try milk in the future). I realized after I made the mixture that I only had 1 pie crust, so I used that on the bottom and a can of Grands biscuits stretched out for the top. If you use biscuits on the top, you don't need a bottom crust - too much bread! I preferred the crust, though. mushrooms were good add, I'll keep using those, and I like this mix of veggies. UPDATE: don't try this with ham - it's too salty!

I gave this recipe to my DIL and she tried it with the leftover meat from Thanksgiving. It was easy to throw together and it was a BIG HIT!!! We thought there would be leftovers for the next day, but that was not the case at all. The men just kept taking a little more and a little more until it was gone. Make sure to let the recipe set for awhile after you take it out of the oven. We did not have a problem with it being too runny. Just perfect!!!

I made this exactly as the recipe is shown (other than simmering the vegetables in the broth), and it was awesome! A great way to use up my leftover turkey. Kids were skeptical, but one loved it and the other won't admit she liked it (but I think she did.) Definitely will be making this again.

Fantastic recipe - even my persnickitty husband approved. I hate using the cream of whatever soup and was pleased that this didn't call for it. Used fresh veggies, omitted the green beans and added more peas & carrots. Next time will add potatoes. Not runny, not gluey, perfect. Bravo!

This was yummy!  It will be added to the regular rotation.  I halved the recipe for my small family.  I changed up the veggies because I had leftovers to use up. I used potatoes, carrots, corn, and green beans. I would like a little more gravy, however, so I will add more chicken broth next time. Definitely try to leave time to let it sit at least 10 minutes before serving so the gravy thickens up; I learned the hard way.  It still tasted great, but it was definitely soupy without the resting time.

Really, really good!  Family loved it.  Only made one change.  Used 1/2 cup of cut up carrot as I didn't have frozen peas/carrot combo.  Superb.  My husband said he could eat it once a week.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Very good!  I did lighten and clean it up a bit.  I cut the butter in half and added 1/3 cup pureed sweet potatoes after it had thickened.  I made a basic water, flour (white whole wheat), and non-hydrogenated shortening crust.

This was absolutely fantastic! I cheated and bought the pie crusts due to time constraint and omitted the celery cuz I didn't think I'd miss it, I didn't. Will be making turkey just to have leftovers!! And cannot wait to try it with chicken, yum! Thank you Rob & Dad!!

5 stars says it all. This was wonderful fresh and as leftovers for a couple days. Used a mixed veggie bag with peas, green beans, carrots and corn. Worked perfectly.

This recipe is great! I cook for a family of picky eaters so I had to customize it a bit... I omitted the carrots and celery and added one chopped red bell pepper (cooked along with onion), sliced baby bella mushrooms (also cooked along with onion), and a few diced red potatoes which I added to the mixture right before I spooned it into the pie crust.

This was really delicious.  The proportions are perfect if you like a thick, creamy filling.  My tweaks: I subbed the milk with almond milk and we couldn't tell.  Used puff pastry and cut slits on top.  The crust was perfectly golden.  Used 1 cup of fresh carrots and 1 cup of fresh broccoli instead of 2 cups of frozen carrots and peas.  I boiled the veggies in turkey broth and used it in my recipe instead of the chicken broth.  Sautéed the celery with the onions until they were soft.  Added a dash of garlic salt but I forgot that since my turkey was brined, I could have used less salt overall so it was a little too salty for my taste but my boyfriend said he didn't notice.  Next time I will use less pepper and use freshly ground instead.

Perfect comfort food! I added a little extra black pepper, used homemade stock because I had some in the freezer and left out the green beans because I didn't have any. Even though our family usually prefers heavily seasoned food, they loved this mellow, yet very flavorful, pot pie.

AWESOME!! Husband, Parent, and 3 year old approved.  This was a great use of the turkey left overs from the holidays and took some time but nothing hard.  My parents loved it and my dad asked for the recipe.  I halfed it to make only one pie since there were only 4 adults and a 3 year old and got scared there wouldn't be enough with everyone coming back for more.  Only change was that I added some of the left over gravy into it in place of some of the chicken broth just because I had it on hand.  I can't wait till i have left overs again to make it again.  :)  It is our new day after Turkey dinner recipe.

This recipe is a really useful base for a pot pie.  I changed the seasoning, simply because I didn't have all the ingredients to hand, but kept the quantities of veg, meat and liquid the same.  This works well with either a double or single crust.  I've just put four of these in the freezer to use all that left over Christmas turkey!

Delicious! Only changed the vegies to use what we had on hand. Otherwise stayed to the recipe and the seasoning and consistency were perfect. Store bought dough worked fine.

I made it with leftover turkey from Thanksgiving and my whole family loved it! I did only a couple of things different. I didn't' add the Italian seasoning or the onion powder and then on the top crust I added egg white(it made it deliciously flaky!).

Everyone liked this.  My family requested more meat in relation to the veggies.  Also, 1/2 recipe was not enough to fill a deep dish.  Next time I will modify the measurements for a nice, full pie crust.

Dad your pie was amazing! I made them for our annual Thanksgiving Leftovers Feast the day after turkey day. Of the four families contributions mine was gobbled up first (ha ha). I left out the green beans though. Follwed everything else to a T.

Yum!  Granted, we started with amazing turkey (roasted, from Honey Baked Ham), but this was such a yummy way to use the leftovers! I followed the tip of cooking the vegetables in chicken broth (had to add a little more due to evaporation), and added canned mushrooms toward the end. SO GOOD! Thanks!

Tased really great & a great way to actually want to eat thanksgiving leftovers. We used the frozen steam vegetables that you can throw in the microwave to cut down on cook time & it turned out awesome.

Perfect recipe for leftover Thanksgiving turkey! My husband called it "outstanding", and I couldn't agree more. I'll be making this one again for sure! GOLD!!! (My only change was that I didn't have frozen green beans, so I threw in a {drained} can of green beans when it was time to mix everything together.)

This was delicious! It was the first pot pie I have ever made and it is certainly going in the rotation. I followed the recipe, only I just dumped the spices (didn't measure) and used a "cheater" pie crust (red box in the freezer section of my grocery store):)  A thousand times YUM!

Great recipe! What makes it extra special is how easy it is to make this to suit your family's taste.  I added about 6 cups of vegetables, including the onion. I  used 1 cup each of carrots, potatoes, green beans , corn and celery, and precooking everything except the corn. It turned out wonderful. Of course I'm sure it's great if you follow the recipe exactly, but why not make it with what you like best. I made it Saturday after Thanksgiving ... I just happened to some turkey in the fridge. Thanks  Rob!

Loved it! It is easy to change the veggies and seasonings, and the topping. I used a cornbread topping. I was making it for 6 so I reduced amounts to 1/2 cup celery and onion, 2 T. butter, and smaller amounts of vegetables, peas, corn, potato, carrots. I seasoned with the salt, pepper, freeze dried poultry seasoning. I used Pillsbury Shake and Blend Flour which makes a smooth gravy, but is mixed with cold liquid (the 1c. cold chicken broth and 1/3 cold milk). Then I used a cornbread topping. (1pkg.cornbread mix, 2/3 c. milk and 1 lg. egg). Poured it over the turkey and veggie mix, baked at 400 for 25 -30 minutes. Great!!

This reminded me of childhood, except without freezer burn and the tin pie plate. Quick and easy and the kids both asked for seconds. Only modification was addition of cubed white potatoes.

Yummy!!  I was really concerned at how thick it was but I may have used a bit too much flour.  No matter.. added a bit more milk and the texture was spot on.  My husband loved it!  I did use Pilsbury ready made pie crust and it was delicious!

This is the MOST AWESOME pot pie I have EVER tasted! Easy to make and I couldn't even keep them long enough to freeze them. I am going to try variations of it with leftover beef roast and leftover broiled chicken. Thanks for sharing!!!!!

Tasty and comforting! I will definitely make this again and maybe freeze the second one... although looking forward to having his another day this week! Only change I made was to use frozen mixed vegetables (4 cups) instead of 2 each as listed in the ingredients.
