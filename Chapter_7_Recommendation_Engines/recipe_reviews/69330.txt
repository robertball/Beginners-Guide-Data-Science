This is a good recipe . . . my kids are in their early twenties, they and some of their friends loved this recipe. I had them help make it; the neighbor boy across the street was so impressed he asked for the recipe, and then made it with his dad the next day. He said the topping didnâ€™t puff up as much as mine, I told him to add extra flour next time. I added extra flour to mine (1/4c); until the mixture was a little thicker than a standard pancake mix would look like. It would be very easy to play around with the hamburger mixture adding things like black beans, but the only thing I did different was add shredded carrots in place of zucchini. Additionally, did you know that you can substitute white vinegar in place of cream of tartar? It is made from tartaric acid and half neutralized with potassium hydroxide. This process transforms it into a salt. Grapes are the only significant natural source of tartaric acid, and cream of tartar is obtained from sediment produced in the process of making wine. White vinegar or lemon juice, in the ratio of 3 times the amount of cream of tartar called for, will provide the right amount of acid for most recipes.

This is so yummy! I actually followed the recipe exactly after reading the reviews and would not change or add anything! I have a family of 6 (#7 due soon), with a few very picky eaters. All of them were eating 2nds, and onions!! Agree with other reviews, the topping is awesome and worth the time and effort, (my daughter,12, made the topping while I made the rest and it was oven ready quickly!) So worth it and a family pleaser! Definately a keeper! Yum, Yum, Yum!!

I added shredded carrots and sliced mushrooms to up the vegetable level. I also sliced the zucchini because the grated seemed to disappear when cooked.
This was a hit with the family.

This is a great recipe and fairly healthy.  I didn't bother with the zucchini or the marjoram but did use some cumin and a little paprika.  Also, if you're pressed for time try using a jiffy corn muffin mix on top - although the topping in recipe is delicious!!!

The zucchini's optional.  It tasted great with or without it.  I've made it with ground turkey and it's great that way, too.  Also, if the biscuit topping is too thick to spread, just add some more milk.  Cook until bisuit topping is cooked through.  I hope you enjoy this recipe.

My fiance and I found this recipe when we were finishing up school in Fort Worth, TX and so it has the name "Cowtown Casserole" in our household.  It's delicious! I made some vegetarian-friendly changes: (1) morningstar farms crumbles cooked with 1/2c water and packet taco seasonings; (2)added sage, garlic powder and greek seasoning along with the marjoram; (3) 3/4c GREEN salsa; (4)added peas and carrots to the corn; (5) as I was worried about the overwhelming amount of tomato-y based ingredients, I opted for a few Tbsps tomato paste and a can of brothy non-tomoato soup (I used Amy's pasta and vegetable) instead of the condensed tomato soup. Finally, the extra ingredients upped the cook time to approx. 40 minutes. The result was a recipe we make again and again!!

This recipe sounds good on paper, but fails to excite.  I doubled the zucchini and onions and kept everything else as is.  I might suggest it could be renamed "Ketchupy Pantry Pie".  I agree it is good for young picky eaters (due to the sweet tomato-y base).

This was just ok for me.  Pretty bland, but could be good spiced up a bit.  I try to make by the recipe first.  Little too much toppping for the amount of stuff.  If I make again, will tweak with spices for sure.  Thanks for recipe.

This was very good. I had shredded some zucchini that I had from my garden this summer and put it in the freezer. So I was happy to see that this recipe called for shredded zucchini. I made it twice so far.  The first time, not enough meat mixture for the pan size and I must of did something wrong with the topping because it came out flat. The second time I made it in a smaller pan and made the Bisquick Cheddar Garlic Biscuit recipe as another review mentioned and pre cooked them a little before putting on top.  I melted some butter and added a little garlic powder and some parsley and brushed it on top of the biscuits and put it under the broiler for a few minutes then added a little shredded cheese on the top. Other than that left everything the same. It came out fantastic and everyone loved it. I think the meat mixture would be good used in other ways too.

I made this as exactly as it was shown.  Next time I am skipping the corn, I think it took away from the meal.  Also, I covered the dish to bake it and the dough stuck after checking it at 25 minutes.  I took off the foil and finished it baking it that way.  Next time, I will not cover it at all.  Anxious to try again!

Don't let the number of ingredients needed put you off on making this delicious casserole.  Was super easy to make and the topping had a lot of taste also.

I was pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  I left out the zucchini because it didn't look good at the market and the original poster said it is good with or without.  Without thinking I added the entire teaspoon of salt to the meat mixture which was a mistake since there wasn't as much filling.  So it was a little salty.    I usually don't care for savory recipes with biscuit or pastry topping but I liked this because the topping did not seem soggy at all.  And the filling stayed moist without being runny.  good addition to my weeknight dinner rotation.  thanks for the recipe.

Very good recipe, all 3 children loved it.  They loved the "muffin" top. I also added a little extra milk to the topping.  I also have used different cheeses such as a mexican one to spice it up abit.  Old cheese also makes it tastier. I also add a mix of beans for hidden fibre for my family. I have made this many times now and it has been great every time.

It was ok, but nothing memorable..... I would not make it again. I followed the recipe to a tee. No one would eat the left overs. Ended up throwing out about half of it.

I used Campbell's "All Natural Tomato Basil Soup" instead of condensed because I avoid high fructose corn syrup, added peas and carrots to the vegetables. Reminded me a lot of an American version of Shepherd's Pie but bread topping instead of mashed potatoes.

Liked this. It came out tasting like a sloppy joe but with a delicious topping (which makes it more filling). Quite a cozy dish but requires a bit of effort. I can totally see how this would be an amazing dish to hide veggies in for kids.

Excellent starter recipe! I make this every week for my family, per my husband's request. My twin toddlers love it,too! I think the topping tastes great, but is too much prep for the amt. of time available, so I use the Bisquick Cheddar Garlic Biscuit recipe, and drop that on top. Bake at 400 for 15-20min. Excellent!

This was good, but it has several ingredients so I don't feel it's quite worth the effort involved for the result. It took me more than the 45 minutes stated for total time.

Somewhat time consuming but I had the time. The only thing I would recommend is to NOT cover the dish at the end. It was runny and anemic looking. I ended up cooking about 15 mins more uncovered to brown up the crust. I also added more milk to the batter to make it more pourable.

I doubled the salsa due to no tomato soup and did not use corn. I will use four times the zucchini next time. I did not add salt.

Literally  signed up to say this is the best meal ever. I will probably get junk mail now but it's still worth it because it's that good (and it's good for you). I sometimes make a half portion but with the full portion of beef, which for a smaller party, everyone is satisfied. No need for a side dish as it includes your vegetables, starch, and protein; a side salad and a solid desert tops it off though.

I made it exactly as written.  It was too salty to even eat. I think it would be delicious but next time I make it I wouldn't add any salt at all.

Pretty good! It took a bit longer than the directions said to get the biscuit dough to cook all the way through. The biscuits also soaked up a LOT of the beef mixture - next time I think I'll make some more of it to even the ratio. It also needed a bit more salt and maybe some more garlic. Overall, good, and definitely going in the recipe book!

This is very flavorful. Lots of ingredients, so it's not cheap, but it was pretty easy to make. We really enjoyed it. The only things I did different were A)used 1 cup of thawed frozen corn instead of canned and B)used bottled minced garlic instead of fresh for ease. Both my husband and I really enjoyed this.
