This was the perfect side for my Labor Day BBQ.  I wanted something a little different and this was it. The lime dressing made it nice and zesty and I loved the idea of adding chiles and green olives. I will be making this again.  The only things I did differently was I used red onion instead of white, added a little bit of fresh cilantro and to the dressing, added a teaspoon of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix.  I really enjoyed this salad and so did my family.  Thanks Lars.

Excellent. Different: 
It took me about 40 minutes to prepare it (including cook-time) and I substituted the vegetable oil w/ olive oil and added cilantro like one of the other suggestions. Worth it!

DELICIOUS!  I love this recipe.  I used olive oil for the dressing rather than vegetable oil, and I think it added a little richness to it.  Amazing, I will be making this again.

I'm making it the 2nd time.  My family really enjoyed it -- different, yet all the flavors come together nicely!

I cut the oil down to two tablespoons and used olive oil instead.  Instead of powdered mustard I used dijon because I ran out of powdered.  I think the powdered would be better..  I used a tablespoon of pickle relish with two cut up pickled jalapenos - yum.  The green olives give it that salty kick that is just inspired. Great idea!

This is very different and very good, too.  Honestly, I was concerned with the high fat content on this recipe.  Even putting that aside, the amount of oil seemed excessive, so I cut it in half with good success.  The warm potatoes soaked up the dressing quickly, and there was no oil sitting in the bottom of the bowl.  I charred the poblano peppers outside on the grill, and you do get an occasional zing from the poblanos (not much, it's subtle).  I mixed up the dressing and thought it was a little bland, so I added more lime juice, and I tossed in some chopped red bell pepper for a pop of color.  Nice side dish Lars.

Recipes like this are why I love this site. Imaginative, simple, attractive, and tasty enough to be noticed on a crowded potluck table. Thanks!

This is my first review, unfortunately it's a poor one.  The taste was good.  I used dill instead of sweet pickles and didn't end up using the peppers.  However it was way too oily.  One cup of oil (I used olive instead of vegetable) was WAAAAAAY too much.  If I were to make it again, and I'm not sure I will, I'd cut the oil in half, add a little more lime and maybe some cilantro.
