I cook this for myself and my girlfriend all the time. We both love it. Try with some tobasco sauce at serving-time or stir in some pesto to the onion for added flavour!

I love this soup and the cinnamon gives just a bit of a "different" taste.  I make it every Sunday and eat it for lunch during the week!

I made a few changes based on other reviews and personal taste, and it was a really delicious vegetarian soup.  I used 2 c. veggie broth, 2 c. water, 28 oz can diced tomatoes with juice, and two cans of garbanzo beans.  After tasting the broth, I thought it needed something so I added about 1/2 tsp. curry powder.  Not having any parsley in the house, I substituted about 4 cups of fresh, torn spinach at the end of simmering.  Still resulted in a low fat, high fiber soup that was really good!  This is a recipe that will adjust easily to personal preference and whatever veggies, pasta, beans that you have on hand.  Go ahead and experiment with this one!

This soup turned out ok, but I do agree that it was missing something, as another poster pointed out.  I can't really say what that "something" was, but I know it was something!  I ended up adding about another 2 cups of broth because it was so thick, and it still turned out with very little liquid.  It was very quick and easy to make and had an interesting taste, but I don't think I'll make it again.

There was something missing from this soup... I can't figure it out.  I liked it, but I did not love it.  Next time I'll add garlic in with the onions and maybe use less water.  I did like the little touch of cinnamon.

Really quick and simple to make, tasted fantastic and so much nicer than anything I have ever had out of a tin.

I also added garlic with the onions and used a veg stock instead of chicken.
