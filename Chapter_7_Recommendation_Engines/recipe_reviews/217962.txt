UPDATE*** As the submitter of this recipe I would suggest to those of you worried about over browning bottoms, to use  two cookie sheets together to bake on.  My baking sheets are a heavy gauge metal and I also use a silpat on top of that so mine bake up just right.  However, if you have a thin sheet, doubling up will help insulate the bottom and prevent over browning issues. Parchment paper will keep dough from sticking but I do suggest a good spray with PAM prior to use.***  These are easy and fun.  My kid love 'em!  We have made different kinds.... Turkey, beef, sausage, cheese....kids like the cheese dogs best!  These never last long so I make a double batch and individually freeze the second batch for a special lunch treat!  When I freeze for lunches I leave the salt off as it causes the bread to "sweat" while defrosting.  The dough is also wonderful for regular pretzel or bite size pretzels.  I highly recommend the recipe "Clone of a Pretzel Dip" from this site to accompany the pretzel bites!

I used water instead of beer, but these still turned out great.  I made it by hand, proofing the yeast first, mixing the remaining, and then letting it rise for about 1 1/2.

AMAZING! These are ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I was surprised at just how easy they were to make and fun too. I made half the recipe because there was only two of us. It was perfect for one package of hot dogs. The grandkids are going to love them. Thank you WFDM for sharing your AMAZING recipe and a special thank you for recommending my dip! UPDATE - Today I made the pretzel dogs with cheese. I used American cheese which I sliced with a pizza wheel, making it thinner than the dough strips. I pressed the cheese into the dough strips a little then wrapped the dogs. It was necessary to seal the edges between the strips so they would hold up in the water. This all worked well; but, when I baked them, the cheese oozed out the ends. I posted a photo to show the oozing cheese. They tasted great but my conclusion is they really don't need the cheese. I made these to freeze because I found that they freeze so well. I put them in the microwave frozen and heat at half power. They taste as good as fresh baked! Try these, you don't know what you're missing!

Wow my Hubby and his kids LOVED these! And so did I of course :p  I DID NOT have a bread machine but I DO have a heavy duty mixer. I did the first 3 steps as directed except I had all the ingredients together in the bowl with the paddle attachment of my mixer until well incorporated. I replaced the paddle with the dough hook and set it on medium low speed for about 6 minutes to knead the dough. After that I covered the dough with plastic wrap and let it sit at room temp for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, until it doubled in size. I did everything else as instructed.

Perfect, just perfect! My daughter helped me make these and we had so much fun! With the exception of using my KA mixer to knead the dough (no bread machine) and then letting it rise for an hour, I followed the directions exactly. The pretzel dogs came out perfectly and were so good! We had a selection of mustards for dipping, but they are really good on their own, thanks WFDM?! Addendum...tonight we had some of these that I had frozen. I wrapped one loosely in a paper towel and microwaved at 70% power for a minute. They came out very fresh tasting.

AWESOME!!!!! These were almost too simple to make. I halved the recipe for 1 package of hot dogs, and actually made my dough the night before and refrigerated it. A couple of hours before I was ready to make them, I pulled out the dough to allow it to get to room temp...PERFECT! I used a pizza cutter to cut the strips of dough and that worked out great. I served them with assorted mustards. My family LOVED these, and that makes this a definate do-over recipe. Thanks, WFDM, for a keeper! :)

Every once in awhile I make something that is so delicious that I can't believe that it is the work of my own hands.  These delicious dogs are the perfect example of this!  Mmm. Mmm. Mmm.  I do not own a bread machine so I did knead it by hand for about 10 minutes and then let the dough rise for just over an hour.  Perfection!  I used a pack of 7 hot dogs and made pretzels out of the rest of the dough.  I can't wait to make this recipe again.

Made these for a 4th of July get together with friends. When I was asked to bring hot dogs, they left it up to me as to what to bring, thinking I was going to stay traditional.....hee hee....These were a huge hit, even from the "non hot dog" eaters. I made 20 out of this recipe and still had extra dough. Didn't bring any home and for the first time, I do believe that the hamburgers took a back seat. Thanks so much WFDM for such a great recipe. I'm making more to stock the freezer.

Very good. I wrapped organic hotdogs & also made bite-sized ones, some with sausage slices & some with jalapeno slices. (Next time I'll try wrapping the jal. ones so that water can't make them mushy; also will try finely chopping them to add to dough as jalapeno tasted great with the pretzel dough.)

I just made these for my family and they were delicious. Very easy to make. I don't have a bread machine so I copied what another viewer did and used my KA mixer, swapped out the paddle beater with the dough hook after the ingredients were mixed. I let the dough hook knead the dough for about 6 minutes. I used the Kirkland brand (long) hot dogs from Costco and cut each hot dog in half, and used half a strip of dough to wrap around each hot dog. Worked out perfect. I actually got 22 wrapped hot dogs. I love the fact that you can freeze them for later. Great recipe, will make again and again!! Thank you.

Let me just add my 5 stars to this great recipe.  I've read and heard about it on the Buzz for a long time and today was the day!  I cut the recipe in half and used 8 Angus Beef Hotdogs.  I'd never made pretzels before and these were fantastic.  The beer and butter flavor comes through in the dough and the kosher salt on top is the bomb.  We dipped them in simple yellow mustard.  My so picky husband even commented (which he hardly EVER does) that these were really good.  My jaw dropped, so I want to Thank you Jan for the great recipe!!!!

I actually made these in March 2011, but when the recipe was published, the reviews vanished.  This is a copy/paste of my review. - Awesome Recipe!! We throughly enjoyed these for dinner with a bowl of green pea soup ~ Thank you What's For Dinner Mom!!! I had a very "Fun" experience making these (see my Profile/Cooking Tragedies for a laugh at my expense). I got these all ready, boiled, egg wash and salted and baked 1/2 the batch right away and put the other 1/2 in the fridge until closer to dinner (about 1.5 hours) there was no difference in the end result ~ perfection! Will definately make these again :)

This came out absolutely great! I put in half whole wheat and half white flour and it came out quite nice.  I also don't have a bread machine so I kneaded by hand and left it to rise for an hour.

Jan, you are a wizard of all things yeast. This is another great recipe! I followed everything to a 't' and had no problems at all. These are so easy to make it's unbelievable. I'm going to make more to put in the freezer for handy lunches. I only had 12 dogs, so I made pretzel bites out of the excess dough ~ the taste and texture was EXACTLY as a soft pretzel should be. Classic.

WFDM, you knocked it out of the park with these dogs! These were so easy to make and they tasted out of this world. I followed the directions to a "T" and had no problems what so ever. I am making a second batch to freeze as you suggested for the kiddos. I made a batch with regular hot dogs and a batch with jalapeno and cheddar hot dogs, all were gone with no leftovers in sight!! Thanks for a great keeper. Being from the Philly area I say " Philly pretzels who?" Jan's rock!!!!

I love these!! We all did, DH a little less than me & the boys.  I followed the recipe really closely - I did use 1-1/2c whole wheat flour and the rest was bread flour, that worked well.  I didn't make 18 pretzel dogs though, just 10 - and half of them we used linguica dogs.  I experimented with the rest of the dough and made 'pretzels' with it. I never boiled dough before baking and one review commented that they didn't know what the boiling in baking soda water did for them - it made a big difference. The dough not boiled tasted more like salty bread and the dough we boiled first came out like soft pretzels, was really good! I can't wait to make these again :)

Love, love, love these. Simple to make, just has a lot of steps. I do not use a bread maker, just my Kitchen Aid and I use the dough hook for about 4-5 min. I did not change the recipe at all. They heat up really nice in the microwave the next day. I microwave 1 at at time for 1 1/2 minutes. Husband, kids and grandkids request them all the time.

Fantastic!  The dough is so easy to work with!  Don't be afraid of stretching it if needed to get it all twisted around the dog because it will not break.  This is a very elastic dough.  I don't have a bread machine so I did it by hand, which worked great.  Great recipe!

I took these to a bowl game-watch party and they were a huge hit! I cut the hot dogs in half to make small versions and that was a perfect size.  Word of caution: DO NOT use a hard-anodized pot to boil the pretzel dogs.  The baking soda in the water stripped the coating off the pot and I had little black flecks of whatever used to coat my pot all over my little pretzel dogs and had to start over.

These are WONDERFUL!  I made them last night for NYE and they were a huge hit!  I was admittedly a little nervous about making them (working with yeast) but they were surprisingly easy to make!  I followed the recipe exactly, no changes.  Make sure to pinch those edges, like others have said!  Even though a couple of mine came loose, they looked and tasted great!  I also liked that even after sitting out for a little bit, the pretzel stayed soft--didn't get hard as a rock.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!  Thanks!

These were really good and they were good as leftovers too. The family was over and it was just pouring outside so it was a good day for chicken soup and pretzel dogs. I am my own breadmaker, I kneaded for 7 mins and stuck in front of the woodstove for 1 hour.

These are just fun!!! I don't have a bread machine so--mixed with a spoon until flour was incorporated.  Kneaded a few times and put in a greased bowl about 1 1/2 hours to rise.  Recipe makes alot of dough!! Wrapped 2 pkgs of mini dogs and used about 1/2 the dough.  Will definitely make again, but will half the dough. Make sure you really pinch those ends or they will unravel in the water bath!

I've been searching for a recipe like this and these were GREAT! I think I made my dough a bit too thick as the bottom (underneath the dog) did not bake completely. I will adjust next time. But they looked beautiful and tasted great! I also added black and white seseme seeds to a few for look and texture and they were great,too!

It's much easier to make pretzels than l ever knew. These were great...based on a lot of the reviews, I reduced the salt in the dough and used it pretty sparingly on top with the egg wash. I only used half the dough and froze the rest for another time.

Everyone absoslutely loved these! Followed the recipe and will be making these a lot during the upcoming football season. I was a little worried going in because I have very little (next to none) experience with yeast but the instructions are very well written and they were so much easier than I imagined. Made half with  Ballpark all beef franks and half with Hebrew National brand (family has different pref.) and half with salt and half without.  All were equally good and all eaten quickly! Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipes, What's for dinner, mom?!

I boiled half of the wrapped hot dogs and then I just baked the other half without boiling them.  We all preferred the non- boiled ones.  I do not know the purpose of boiling them but it changed the texture for sure.  I will be just baking these in the future.  Overall, great recipe!

I saw this recipe on a blog and thought it looked so good I just had to try them but I figured mine wouldn't turn out as great.  I was wrong they turned out perfectly and were really easy to make.  Everyone liked them so well I made them for my son's graduation party and they were the first to go.  The recipe was requested and shared.

I made this recipe for the first time back before it was published, and my family loved it. I used both hot dogs and smoked sausage links, and both were great. They freeze well, too!

I thought these came out very well. I made only 16 hot dogs since that's all I had (and it makes dividing the dough easier anyway). I wish I had thought so turn a strand of dough into a pretzel with no dog so I could see what I thought of this dough as just a pretzel dough! Dried my hotdogs before rolling, just sprinkled the kosher salt at the end. I tried them with "Clone of a Pretzel Dip" from this site. Thanks for sharing your recipe, Jan, can't wait for the DH to try them!

These are great!  I halved the recipe since it's just the two of us, but now I wish I'd made a full recipe.  The recipe was very easy to follow.  Thanks for sharing.  This will be a repeat for sure!

These were a big hit with my family! They were easy to make. I used water and regular unbleached flour. I used all the salt called for and sprinkled a few grains on top after brushing with the egg/water mixture. I used 10 regular hot dogs and 6 veggie dogs (Morning Star Farms). There were some left over scraps which I just tossed in the b.soda water, then baked. They were delicious, as well. I bake whole wheat bread/rolls/pizza almost every week, and out of all the bread dough I've made, this is the easiest I've ever worked with. I don't have a bread machine so did it by hand as always. I used 4 cups of flour plus what I put on the counter as I kneaded the dough. It was like playing with homemade Play Dough! It was such a nice texture. When wrapping the strip of dough around the hot dog, be sure to overlap the first end and pinch closed the last end so they stay together in the water. I made Cheese Dipping Sauce by Jackie Smith and that added a great taste. Thanks for the great recipe!

These were good.  I used parchment paper -- first time ever and the LAST time!  ALL of my hotdogs stuck to the paper and ruined the bottoms.  Pretzet was nothing outstanding, but good for a change.

be sure to use a good quality hot dog or you won't do these pretzels justice. the baking soda bath is what -makes- these pretzels. if you skip it, you will get bread dogs. the double baking sheet idea is genius; my bottoms were perfect!

These are very tasty, and the dough is beautiful to work with, but I don't have a bread machine so they were a little more labor intensive for me.  As some others mentioned, the bottoms browned much more quickly than the tops.  Not sure how ti prevent that.  I baked in 2 batches....the second batch I sprinkled some poppy seeds on prior to baking...think they added a nice touch.

So HAPPY to run across this recipe!! How much fun to make. Planning a get together with my family where I'm making "Slow Cooker Buffalo Chicken  Sandwiches" from this site - thought they would be a bit hot for the grandkids - so this will work PERFECT!! I bet the adults indulge them also!
The only thing I did at all different was to use my confection oven and bake them at 400 degrees for 11 - 12 minutes!
We tried one and used the "Hot Mustard Pretzel Dip" from this site  (which I use on reg. pretzels) it added great flavor!!
Thanks Jan!! Next I will make plain pretzels - knowing now how easy it is.

I made these last night and the whole family loved them.  I don't have a bread machine so  I let the dough rise for an hour after mixing.  Since I didn't have bread flour, I used all purpose and added 4 tsp of vital wheat gluten.  They turned out great.  Thanks for sharing.

I made the pretzel dough just as the recipe stated.  I sprayed my granite island with Crisco Spray.  I rolled the dough out and used a pizza cutter to cut dough into 1/3" strips and tightly wrapped those around cocktail weenies / lil' smokies.  I followed everything else and they were a HUGE hit for a Super Bowl party!

The taste is AWESOME.  Huge hit with everyone.  However, whatever you do, DO NOT USE PARCHMENT PAPER. I made this very serious mistake and it completely ruined them.  I had to take a knife and cut the bottoms off of every single last one.  Next time, I will be greasing the pan (heavily).  Also, I know oven times vary, but once you get past the 10 minute mark, watch carefully...they start to burn quick.  Great recipe though, I will definitely be making these again.

Very good. Made half recipe and fine for package of dogs. Used 1/3 cup baking soda in 8 cups water and seemed like plenty. Also sprinkling the salt on after brushing with egg, you are able to use much less and still have great taste.

These were so good. I can’t believe I made pretzel for the first time. I dried the pretzels with paper towel before I baked them. Instead of salt, I put cheddar cheese on the top. I also put jalapenos on some of them. I will use canned jalapenos instead of the fresh ones next time; also I will put more salt in the dough if I am not going to put salt on the top. For sure I will make these again. Thanks Jan for the recipe.

My husband and son (3 yr old) loved these!  DH kept saying they taste much better than dogs on a plain bun.  He loved them with brown spicy mustard.  I cut the recipe down to 6 servings; my dough was a little wet but that could have been due to an incorrect calculation.  Next time I will use a paper towel to dry the hot dogs before wrapping them to help the dough stick.  Thanks for sharing a fun recipe that was a family hit!  Served with garlic parm potato wedges and fresh fruit for a simple meal.

This was good.

The only thing I am going to suggest is that you add the baking soda to the water before it boils. I added it after it boiled, as the recipe stated, and it was like a volcano. The whole pot of water erupted all over the stove top. I had a huge pot, too, and there wasn't too much water. It just 'blew up'. Fortunately, I wasn't burned.

Used the KA stand mixer to mix and knead.  Great way to combine the flavor of an all-American hot dog with a soft pretzel.  Made a half-batch with Ball Park beef hot dogs and ended up with some pretzel nuggets, too.

These were tasty and fun!  I made the dough by hand and wrapped it around kielbasa for a more grown up taste.  Topped with spicy, dijon, or just plain yellow mustard these were a big hit!  I cleaned up the kitchen while they baked and sat down at the table with my daughter and husband without delay (a rarity in our house).  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!  I'll definitely make these again.

This simple recipe turned out really great - they looked as good as they tasted. Some thoughts after making it: 
- I think I might try reducing the amount of salt in the dough next time since the salt on top of the bun, in addition to the salt in the hot dog made it plenty salty!
- If I'm feeling scroungy, I could probably stretch the dough out to cover almost twice as many hot dogs. Everyone agreed the pretzel bread was really good, but we had almost too much in ratio to the hot dog. 

Fantastic treat! I'll definitely be using this one again.

A soft, chewy pretzel wrapped around a hot dog?  Yup, it's super yummy.  Not only did these turn out great tasting, but they looked great, too.  I didn't know how I would do at wrapping the dough around as perfectly as others seemed to do, or how the dough would stay on the hot dog in the water, but I only had 1 dough casualty.  These were a huge hit for dinner, and also for lunch the following day.  Thanks:)

These were awesome!  My little guy has just discovered soft pretzels and loves them. He said they were so good he said they didn't need ketchup. I  made these to freeze for lunches.  Thanks for a fun and tasty recipe!

I was concerned about the beer since I don't drink it but you can't taste it at all it just makes the dough really light and fluffy. I didn't realize my bottle of Stella Artois was not 12 ounces so I needed to add more liquid as the dough was too dry when it started kneading, I used 1/2 ww flour as well, really good!
I only use 1/4 c baking soda to boil the pretzel dogs as I find it too salty and I skip the kosher salt.

Yum yum! These couldn't have been easier to make. I halved the recipe and ended up with enough dough for 8 hot dogs. The taste is amazing. The pretzel dough on it's own is so good. Thanks for submitting this recipe What's for dinner, mom.

I couldn't believe how wonderful this came out. Halved the recipe. I do not have a bread machine, used my KA mixer kneaded about six minutes.  I was a little concerned because the dough seemed too heavy but con't with a 90 min rise.  The funny part was taking them out of the boiling water...very slippery...They are every bit as good looking and tasty as if they came from a stand.  TRY this recipe

Holy cow!!! What a FANTASTIC recipe!!!!! I can't believe how easy this was! I'll admit, I'm not much of a baker... Me and yeast don't work well together. :) BUT, with my nifty bread machine and a little help from the hubs, these turned out GREAT! This was by FAR the easiest dough I've ever worked with. It rolled like a dream! My hubby and I had a lot of fun together - He cut the dough strips and I wrapped the hot dogs. For a different twist, I topped each pretzel dog with a mixture of poppy and sesame seeds (YUM!). My choice of beer was can of cheap 'ol Budweiser. These are so good, I've been noshing on leftovers all week long. For me, wrapping each "dog" loosely with a paper towel and microwaving at 50% power for 1.5 minutes does the trick. PLEASE, PLEASE don't let the fact that you are not a baker intimidate you from trying this recipe. If I can do it, you can too! Kudos to WFDM for sharing such an awesome recipe with the AR community! :-)

This is a fantastic and easy recipe.  I started out using the dough to wrap hot dogs, but the recipe has now turned into my "go to" for all homemade pretzels and pretzel buns.  Perfect texture for sliders, brats and all burgers.  If you will not be eating everything fresh, omit the salt on top of the pretzels ~ the salt "melts" with storage.

These came out SOOO good and are much easier than you'd think.  A couple recommended tools:
Breadmaker (yes the recipe says this but if you are like me you are guilty of making a shopping list before reading directions)
Pizza slicer, helps to cut the dough even without misshaping
Silicone tongs or slotted spoon, helps to get the dough out of the boiling water without falling apart

Perfect!  I am new to this forum and this recipe is very complete with no information lacking.  Followed the directions and ingredients exactly and they turned out perfect!  I hate beer and don't drink alcohol at all, but used it (Bud Light) anyway and I couldn't taste any beer, just great flavor.  Don't worry if they look overly browned because they do not taste burned or hard, but I would start checking on them in 12 minutes if you desire a lighter color. I used angus all beef dogs and they tasted just like those bought in the mall or better.  I also made half with tofu pups which are soy dogs for my vegetarian daughter and her family and they also were a big hit with the adults and kids alike.

Made these a few times always with great success. At times I have replaced the beer with water. Still yummy! After asking about freezing them, WFDM did answer, that one can freeze these, but without the salt on top.

These were really good! I wanted them to be more appetizer sized so I cut the weiners in half and wrapped them in the dough leaving only one end sticking out of the dough. The recipe made 24 half-sized pretzel dogs with no dough left over. My first batch did stick a bit and got a bit dark on the bottom (even with doubling up the baking sheets). With the second batch I put the egg wash on the rolls before putting them on the baking sheet and they didn't stick at all and the bottoms were not too dark. I will definitely make this recipe again; my teenage son asked me to make some for his school lunches!

An excellent recipe.  I didn't have enough hot dogs when I made this and so there was too much dough for the amount of dog, but everything still tasted ok.  I was worried about it cooking in the middle becuse the dough was thicker than it was supposed to be, but that was ok too.  In the future I might try wrapping up a bit of cheese in with the hot dog for an added suprise.

Quick, Easy and Yummy... what could be better?  I followed the recipe exactly.  It's perfect the way it is.  I don't have a bread machine so I used my Kitchen Aid mixer to knead the dough and let it rise for an hour.  I used a silpat on my cookie sheets and the bottoms were perfect.  I've used recipes from this site for years and this is the first I've reviewed, I liked it that much!  Thank you!

To be honest, it tasted like a normal hot dog (in a regular bun, maybe a little saltier. But at least it looked nice. :)

Made these, as directed, for a football tailgate and they were a huge hit. Everyone said they were right on. Even my chef freind came into the kitchen to see how they were made. I'll be making these over and over again.

A-mazing! We used Nathan's beef and cheddar dogs and everyone from my 4 year old to my 64 year old dad loved it! I didn't have a bread machine so kneaded it by hand for 7ish minutes. Took longer than an hour to rise, but otherwise was perfect.  We used 8 hot dogs and turned the rest into traditional pretzels.  They were also delish reheated the next day-you could taste the beer a bit more then.  Will definitely become a football tailgating tradition!

Anyone that is afraid to make these..DON'T be afraid. They could not be easier and the best part is that they are to die for! After Jan's advice, I prepped the dogs up until right before baking just after boiling. Put them in the fridge until I was ready to bake and baked when I got home. Perfect! My guy ate 2 before I even put got them off the pan. The only substitute I made was to use regular AP flour. Thank you for sharing this awesome recipe What's For Dinner, Mom. (P.S. Jan, My freinds that I made these for ate them in seconds flat! Much better than sandwiches..)

had trouble with wrapping the dough around hotdog. i think it was due to the fact the dogs were wet.  i will try next time with 5 star weiners or brookside. forgot to add my salt with sugar and water before addding yeast.  my fault so will try again.  allow 1 1/2 hours for dough to finish in bread machine

I followed the recipe closely, but something must have gone wrong.  It was quite a bit of work and it was nothing like a pretzel.  I did not particularly enjoy the beer flavor in the bread.  I doubt I will make this again.  What a disappointment!  I had really hoped that this was going to be a keeper.  ;(

What a great treat this is!  Mine didn't turn out quite as pretty as the picture, but they sure were delicious!  I made only half a recipe of the pretzel dogs, so had some leftover dough.  I have frozen it and look forward to using it soon - either to make more pretzel dogs, or to make a small pizza. Mine did get a little too brown.  Next time I will check them at about 10 minutes.

I've made this 3 times since i found it two weeks ago.  A big hit with everyone from my 10 month old (tiny bits only) to my husband and my tween nieces.  I used lowfat turkey dogs and i had trouble with them swelling way up in the oven, and then deflating and getting all wrinkled.  The third time I made the recipe for the kids, I cut the hot dogs in half and i didn't leave any of the hotdog sticking out.  They came out perfect! I've also used the leftover dough to make regular "auntie anne's" pretzels.  So fabulous, I am addicted!!!  Thank you.

I didnt realize these had gotten published so im moving my review from the personal recipe to this one. Just like they are at the Philly pretzel factory. I knew these would be good when I recognized the soft pretzel recipe from Alton Brown on the Food Network. I had made them before. Although I did change the water to a bottle of Corona like you suggested. I did not use a bread machine b/c I dont have one so I let it rise for 1 hr like his version said. I used meat hotdogs and Smart Dog vegetarian protein links and both ways they were excellent. I will be making these again. Thanks for the idea What's for dinner, mom?

These are super easy to make and taste great (especially if you use Nathan's dogs).  My only complaint was that I used parchment paper and the dough stuck so badly that I had to cut the dogs off (try to peel them off and you just end up with a layer of paper stuck to the bottom crust).  Next time I will just grease the pans and stay away from the parchment.

OMG!!!!  These were awesome.  I didn't have bread flour so I just added a little wheat gluon to the flour.  I mixed it with my kitchen aide mixer and let it knead for me about 10 minutes.  I did let the dough rise about an hour before rolling it out.  This made it so easy to work with.  It wasn't stretchy or rubbery to work with at all.  I used OM cheese hotdogs and they were so yummy with a little mustard!  I think I will start using this bread recipe for my bierox.

These were very easy to make.  However, I didn't use the 1/4 cup kosher salt to sprinkle on top and they were still way too salty for our family's tastes (I used Oscar Mayer Angus hot dogs).  Also, they turned really dark after 10 minutes of baking.  Next time, I will reduce the temperature to 425 or even lower so they won't be so brown (border line of being burned) as well.  It is a keeper recipe with minor adjustments.

Loved them! I made 1/2 with regular hot dogs and 1/2 with hot links for my Husband. I still can't believe how easy they were. I had been wanting to try these forever but was slightly scared of making them.Wish I hadn't waited so long! Will be making these again.

This recipe turned out great! I don't have a bread maker so I followed another commenters directions on how to mix using a kitchenaid, then let the dough rise for 2 hours before rolling it out. I can definitely see this being made for parties in the future!

Im writing this review on behalf of my kids. They absolutely love these things! Easy to make and keeps them full! Great for a kids party! If Im going through all the trouble of making the dough, I chose to go to my local butcher and get fresh all beef links which I think makes a huge difference. Surprisingly different beers makes for a different taste. The last time I used Pyramid Hefeweizen and they were the best so far. This time around I turned them half way through the baking process and they browned evenly and perfectly.

I have made these many times over the past few years with one exception.  instead of using full sized dogs... I use cocktail wieners and make pigs in blanket style.  this recipe will make 2 pigs weiners plus a little dough left over that I make into bites.  they are great fresh or frozen.  I have even stuffed with cheese, making sure to seal well.  they are always the first thing to disappear at all of my gatherings and my husband always requests them.  I have a batch going now that I am making ahead for his birthday party.  this is just the best pretzel dough I have ever made.  thanks so much for this much loved recipe!!!

These were a hit at my super bowl party.  I think I'll not sprinkle the kosher salt on the top next time.  Made it a little too salty.  Might add other flavors to the top like cheddar bake some grainy mustard right on there.    Also make sure you really pinch the ends like described or they start to unwrap in the boiling water if the boil is too aggressive.

I made these with water in place of beer and minus the egg wash (a little melted butter in lieu of it). They turned out great and my family and hangers-on gobbled them down like the happy campers they are! 
I used King Arthur's white whole wheat flour and the resulting dough had both lightness and that great wheat flavor. 
Also, I used a variety of dogs and have a suggestion: avoid using low fat or soy hotdogs here. Full flavor, full fat is going to get you the best results. The fat helps to cook the inside portion of the pretzel, adding to both the texture and flavor. The others work ok, they just pale in comparison.

Wow wow wow.  This was absolutely amazing!  My husband and kids loved these and so did I!  I studied breadmaking in a prestigious school but we've never tackled pretzels that used beer.   And since my boys love hot dogs so much...I was desperate to make something That will be a complete snack for them when they're at school or work.  Well this is it!  So easy to make....I have a bread machine but did the kneading on my Kitchenaid mixer which was just fine....I think doing this by hand is ok as well as the dough is very forgiving.  i let the dough rise for an hour then rolled the dough with a rolling pin then sliced in strips as indicated.  Instead of the baking soda bath I used food grade lye used really for pretzels which gave my pretzels a lovely brown color in just 20 minutes of baking.  Used sea salt for sprinkling. Thank you for sharing.

Wow!  Today just happened to be a west coast rainy day.  So, I thought I would try out this recipes on a few, frozen, partially used packages of hot dogs.  I followed the recipe closely with the only change being that I divided the dough into 16 balls and rolled each ball into a rope with which to wrap each hot dog.  Having only a dozen hot dogs, I made 4 pretzels out of the remaining dough.  The recipe was an amazing success!  Thank you for posting it, Jan!

This was a great project for my daughter and me. We hand-made the dough (let it proof 1 hour), then made our dogs assembly-line style to get them to the oven, using all-beef and turkey dogs. We froze 6 of them and heated them up (about 90 sec in the microwave) over the weekend. Yummy dinner with some Cajun Sweet Potatoes (from this site) and broccoli, and a nice weekend snack. The kids asked if we could make it again and use the dough for soft pretzels (which we WILL DO).

Nice pretzel dough. You can't taste the beer which in my case was a good thing. The pretzel covering was perfect. Nice texture and it got a really nice golden brown when in the oven. Will definitely make again!

Love love love this recipe...done it by hand all 50 times I've made it!! I get requests all the time to bring them!!! Love them!!! -- Update: to those of you who read the suggestions. No bread machine necessary!! Knead by hand till your dough is smooth, put it in your lightly greased bowl, and cover. Leave for about an hour/hour and a half.....come back, your dough will have doubled in size. Then cut swirl bake and serve. I do not boil the hot dogs.....I let them bake with the pretzels.......perfect every time

So yummy! It was first time making them ever and they turned out perfect! I topped them with sesame seeds and cayenne green peppercorn Gouda! My boyfriend and I are lactose in tolerant so it's nice to make pretzel dogs with cheese we can eat on top! I made a full batch but only did a few pretzel dogs. I used the rest of the dough to make some pretzels for his lunches! So much for low carbs haha I could eat these every day!

This a fantastic recipe and a definite keeper.  I do not have a bread machine so kneading was the only change I made. I am not a very experienced baker, but found this recipe easy to follow and still produced great results despite my shortcomings as a baker.

Oh my goodness! I will be playing with variations of this bread for weeks! There was a little hole-in-the-wall near our house that made Philly Cheesesteak Pretzel Pockets that were to die for. They went under and we wanted to see if we could make our own. We used this dough, but instead of strips around hot dogs we made 6x5 rectangles with a dollop of Philly Cheesesteak filling, folded them over and crimped. With the leftover dough I made a couple of hot dogs. Followed the rest of the recipe with the baking soda bath and rock salt. It was absolutely glorious! My bread machine has never produced such a lovely ball of dough, it's gotta be the beer! Today I'm running the dough recipe through a full bake cycle in the breadmaker to see what it will do. We're guessing the boiling kills the yeast to prevent further rising, so this might blow the top off the breadmaker. I just LOVE experimenting!

This was a simple recipe even without a bread maker. I added cooked bacon and onions to the bread mix and made a beer cheese dip to go along. I decided to use brats instead of dogs. The family loved it!

4  stars only because it was difficult. It truly is one of the best tasting Pretzel dog recipes, however, very labor intensive and the boiling was difficult, the dog would slide out or the pretzel would unwrap. I did use the left over dough, as it made a lot for a family of 4, I made regular pretzels, poured the boiling water in a glass pie dish and dropped the pretzels into that, much easier that fishing for them in my large pot. May try again, but will dip them in the pie dish not the pot.

That wasn't bad. not hard to make, nice little treat. probably won't make it again, not because we didn't like it, but when it all is said and done, that was a lot of work for a hot dog. Made 7 dogs, and a bunch of pretzels. Not bad pretzels by themselves, but there are better pretzel recipes out there. I think you should try it if you are thinking about, I'm glad I did, just not worth making again.

Family loved these!  Great as leftovers, too.  Per suggestion from another, I made the Cheese Dipping Sauce from this website to go along with the Pretzel Dogs and it was really good.  Will be putting this into our menu rotation.

These are truly phenomenal.  I've made them with beer, ginger ale, water, and today I even tried them by proofing the yeast in milk (no water or beer) because we had to turn the water off as my husband was playing plumber.  Unbelievable!  Thanks Jan, hats off to the queen of yeast breads!

Never tried something like this before.  Rave reviews from family and it wasn't that hard.  I was hesitant about using beer as I have had "beer battered" foods before and didn't like the taste of beer.  We used an ultra lite beer and it was awesome.  No beer flavor just a great, all around recipe.  Will definitely make again.  I've never even written a review before but this was so good I couldn't resist.  Thank you.  Going to go use the rest for pretzels now.

We dipped them into FritoLay Brand mild cheddar cheese dip! Amazing! And I had to make them two days in a row they were so good! Granted half of the pretzel bread the first time I made into pretzels which non-pretzel lovers loved!

I made these for the kids. They were not big fans (something new does not go over wel with them). My husband tried one and raved about it and took 2 for lunch the next day. The leftovers went to my brothers family- they went wild for them, and asked me to do more. A wonderful recipie. The dough makes a great pretzel bite as well.

I made this recipe using my bread maker on the dough setting  (stacking ingredients as suggested in my manual). The dogs were a huge hit with the family and they said they were better then the ones at the movie theater. Will definitely be adding this recipe to my recipe box.

LOVE these!  The pretzel part is top notch and taste just like the hot pretzels you can buy.  You must use the parchment paper...no sticking.  I baked them at 425 which helped them not be so brown.

Despite having no beer, only a cup of bread flour, and no bread machine, these turned out great.  I used water instead of beer, all purpose flour with my remaining bread flour, and kneaded the dough by hand.  Everyone was crazy over them!  The soft pretzels were wonderful.  Even the meat lover of the family was unraveling it from the hot dog and it eating it plain.

Used focaccia bread dough instead of Jan's dough recipe and it worked out very well. Just in time for Super Bowl Sunday 2020! Thanks for the recipe idea.

These were pretty good, I would make them again.  My oven isn't true, so I baked them for the 15 minutes as directed, but they were a bit underdone inside (yet very brown).  I added cheese and jalapeno on top like in the video, others with poppy seeds, and the rest with only kosher salt on top.  Ironically, the ones with the kosher salt were the best.  I also made a spicy ketchup and the dipping sauce mentioned by the submitter, "Clone of a Pretzel Dip".  I found that dip to be too sweet overall.  The next time I make this I plan to make a spicy cheese dipping sauce.  I made 1/2 of the recipe which covered 1 package of hotdogs (10 count) nicely with 2 small balls (pretzel bites) leftover.

I followed the recipe except for  kneading in my KA mixer. They were way too much trouble for the out come. I'll stick to Crescent wrapped hot dogs. Good and easy. And very few pots and bowls to clean.

Great recipe. I halved it.  I would add salt to the flour as it retards yeast growth. I used a stand mixer with a hook. Mixed yeast mixture, flour, and salt until dough came away from the bowl. Stopped for anout 10 minutes then continued until dough was smooth and elastic. Used a pizza cutter for the strips. Used smoked brats with jalapeno and cheese.

I'm not sure why anyone thinks you have to have a bread maker to make this recipe.  That negative review was from someone who can't figure out how to attach a bread hook to a kitchenaid.  This recipe is great.  The process is labor intensive, but the result is well worth it.

-edit-
Thank you, Big "M"!  My oven has a convection feature but I rarely think to use it. I went with your suggestion of convection, 400F, 11-12 minutes, plus I used a Silpat nonstick mat. The end result was a perfect balance of top and bottom browning. 

About the kosher salt -- I was surprised to read how widely the density can vary. Morton's Kosher is more than half again as dense as Diamond Crystal so the choice of salt in the dough would make a big difference. (I use Diamond Crystal for the dough but Morton's for the sprinkles.)

From past experience, I should also note that the quality of the hot dog matters a lot. We had tried different brands of cheese dogs and the brand makes a major difference.

Made this last night and followed recipe to the letter.  I used a Hofbrauhaus Oktoberfestbier  beer.  I think that alone gave the pretzel so much flavor.  I didn't make as many hot dogs using the dough so let my daughter and friend make regular pretzels.

In fact I would make this dough just to have the pretzel, serving it with hot mustard or cheese.

Very good!

This is a solid recipe. As is, it made 48 mini dogs. But it was more work than I think necessary. Second time making it, I spent $1.50 on premade pizza dough from deli and saved a lot of work. I cut in half regular dogs and used one package. Much easier and just as great. Next time I think I'll try cutting water/baking soda in half.

I admit that I did not follow the instructions for the dough, but instead, used the given ingredients and followed the instructions for my bread machine.  This dough is very stretchy and a great texture to work with.  It wrapped my sausages very easily and then rose up nicely to hold them snugly.  It does have a very strong beer taste, but that's ok on a sausage.  Instead of salt, I used cheese to top my husband's because he's not a fan of salt.  He was a fan of the results with the cheese though.  This recipe is a keeper for sure.

Made in my stand mixer instead of a bread machine and they turned out great!  I made the dough the day before and just tossed it in the fridge.  It was the first time I've ever attempted a pretzel dough so I made a "tester" first and then went on to make the entire recipe for our grandson's birthday party.  Kids loved them!

Great recipe, everyone enjoys. For variety,  also could wrap some polish sausage, breakfast sausage or shape into a pretzel.

Oh My so good and delicious.

I used my kitchen aid mixer...heated the beer slightly placed it and the sugar and salt in bowl to cool (5 minutes) mixed in the remaining dough ingredients.  I kneeded the dough for 5 minutes. Let it sit for 45 minutes until doubled. Then continued with the recipe as written.

It worked out great. Just as advertised. Excellent treat with that amazing pretzel flavor. So easy especially if you have a bread machine! I did have the overbrowning issue on the bottom side but didn't double up the baking sheets as suggested in another review.

Great recipe! I doubled the sugar and used lil'smokies to turn these into an awesome appetizer. You need 2 regular packages if you want to use Lil'Smokies though. I also don't have a bread maker so I used my Kitchen Aid to knead for 8 minutes then let it rise for an hour on the proof setting in my over. No need for a second rise.

 Be careful with the flour though. I am experienced at bread making and didn't just dump it all together. I ended up with a whole cup of flour too much. Start with 3/4  of the recipe and add a little more at a time until the dough is soft and just a little sticky when you poke it with your finger.

My family loved this recipe and I will definitely make it again!

Great!  Took to a tailgate party and went fast.  Lots of compliments!  Served with the pretzel dip recommended by a previous review.

Cracking! Made for evening meal and served warm. Used water rather than beer and reduced salt because I only had salted butter. Used German bockwurst rather than hotdogs because that is what my local lidl had. only just enough room in the bread maker for the dough. Will be making again. 5 Star definitely!

This is a great game day recipe!  I have even replaced one cup of the bread flour with one cup of whole wheat  flour and it turns out  good every time.  The family loves these!

These were so easy and so good! I didn't have beer so I just used water. They had a bit of a baking soda-ey aftertaste but that was not a huge issue for me, I may have put too much. I'm not picky, they were still delicious. I had leftover dough and made fun little shapes and cooked them up. Very good dough, even.

The dough was great to work with!  I was a little intimidated, but it wasn't so bad! I made the dough and wrapped the dogs a day in advance, then baked them the next day. Will definitely make these again!!

These are awesome! I do not own a bread machine, nor do I wish to ;-) I used a mixer and let the dough rise on its own. Also I only did 6 dogs, so I made pretzels with the extra dough- cooked them right beside the dogs!! For those who do not have a bread machine this is how I did it... 
I combined the beer (or use equal amount of  warm water in place of the beer), sugar, salt & yeast. Stir and allow it to sit for 4-5 minutes. Once the mixture has risen slightly, put flour in the bowl of the mixer, add the yeast slurry, melted butter & using the dough attachment/hook kneed on low speed just until the dough comes together.
Increase the speed to medium and kneed until dough is smooth and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (about 4-5 minutes). Remove the dough from the bowl, spray it with non stick spray or rub with oil, then return the dough back into the bowl and cover with a tea towel. Let rise for 1 hour in a draft free, warm place, or until doubled in size. Now you are ready to roll out the dough and cut into strips.

Delish. I had to bake them only 12 min, but even the pan @ 15, although darker, was so good.

My husband and I made these for New Years Eve.  Oh my stars, they were unbelievable! I am not a cook and watched the video consistently until I felt I could try it.  The flavor was amazing. The pretzel dough turned out amazing.  I am giving this recipe five stars.

These were super easy and fun to make.  I'm not a hotdog fan, (so I'll adjust rating if hubby goes nuts) so I wasn't completely blown away by taste ... but presentation wise, they're adorable.  I made a half recipe and had enough dough to do 10 hotdogs and 6 medium sized pretzels.  Made in KA with no problems - lovely dough to work with.  *DO* use parchment paper - I was leary after reading others had problems and made half on paper, half on well oiled sheet (baking at 425) and after drying them off a bit after removing from bath.  Ones with paper were fine .... ones without stuck terribly.  Thanks so much for recipe.

My family LOVES these!!  We've made them many different ways and they're all good!  The pretzel around the dogs comes out great every time.  I don't use a bread maker, so I knead for 10 minutes and let rise for 90.  Wonderful portability too!  We toss them in a bag and bring along some salad and chips for a picnic at the park.  Definitely a keeper!

These were awesome! Just make sure you find the lowest sodium hotdogs you can find or they will be very salty. I plan on make these many times over. Thank you for the recipe.

What a great idea! My family really enjoyed this. The pretzel dough is perfect. Very easy to but together. The only beer I had in the house was a Guinness so I used that. Will be making these again soon. Thanks!

Thanks so much for posting this awesome recipe.  It was fairly easy to make - a bit detailed, but well worth the effort. Everyone liked them - my 5 year old ate 3! I can't wait to make them again

Good for what they are, you can wrap it up, but it's still a hotdog!  The kids liked them, and the dough was easy.
