I made these with whole wheat flour, and 1T honey instead of sugar.  Great recipe for light and fluffy pancakes!

These were a nice change to the standard pancake recipe. They were light and fluffy with a nice flavour. The lemon was a nice addition; present but not overpowering. I used all lemon juice rather than using white vinegar as well. Since they pretty much serve the same purpose, I just opted to use the juice of one whole lemon. I used 2 teaspoons of poppy seeds.

These pancakes were amazing! I've never had lemon pancakes and they are so good-my 5 kids just loved them! We live at a high altitude (above 9K) so I only added 1 tsp of baking powder (and made my own since I was out....2 parts cream of tartar + 1 part baking soda). They puffed up nice and the lemon flavor was wonderful! I used one small lemon for juicing and 2 whole lemons for zesting...we also put in the pulp from the lemon we juiced. That made them very lemony and really helped the lemon flavor come out. We topped them with raw honey and butter. We will def. be making these again! Thanks for the great recipe!

Loved this recipe.  I forgot to pick up a lemon, but used reconstituted juice and did without the zest.  Next time I will remember the lemon!  Beware though that it doesn't serve 4 people.  We had four of us and I doubled the recipe and we just had enough.  They were great though!

If you like lemon, you must try these pancakes.  They are my new favorite.  The lemon/poppy seed combination is perfect.  The came out light and fluffy and perfectly round.  My kids had theirs with syrup, but I had mine with blueberry sauce, and they were just fabulous!  Great Wednesday morning pancake!

Absolutley delicious! These pancakes were so light and fluffy, and the lemon flavor was very subtle. We served with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and some fresh whipped cream. Thanks for this amazing recipe, we will be making this one again soon:)

My family and I loved these.  I sweetened some mixed berries and put on the top of these and some whip cream...YUM!  But- I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand or poppy seeds, and used lemon juice in replacement of the vinegar.  SO good.  Will definitely make again.

I add 2 tablespoons vinegar, half whole wheat and half all purpose flour, I only use 1T butter or ghee and using the fresh lemon juice and zest are sublime! They are light and puffy, Perfect and delicious, my 3 year old gobbled them up! What a nice subtle zesty flavor for a change from the traditional!They are now my favorite pancakes, thank you!

Very good pancakes! I used 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour and 1/2 cup of white flour to make them a little healthier.

Based on the reviews saying there wasn't quite enough lemon flavor, I did add more lemon zest and lemon juice, as well as 1/4 tsp lemon extract and 1/4 tsp vanilla.  They turned out perfect with just the right amount of lemon!

Oh my goodness ~ This recipe is a keeper.  I had buttermilk, so used that in place of the milk/vinegar combination.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly, I doubled all ingredients and made 20 pancakes.  The texture was so light and fluffy, absolutely perfect just the right combination of lemon and poppy seed.

Nice flavor. It wasn't as lemony as I thought maybe cause I didnt have lemons so I couldnt have the zest. So if you don't have zest add more lemon juice. I also used 1T light olive oil, 1.5T honey, 1/2T Vinegar,  1/2c milk, 1/4c water.  1/4 AP flour 1/4c whole wheat and 1/2c quinoa flour. Added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder. Sifted the dry 2 times. Only wish I could of had lemon jam/jelly or lemon syrup.

these were good. at least i liked them and my 11 month daughter liked them. My husband, who hates anything with Lemon in them, actually ate several of these. He says they are decent and he will eat them if i insist on serving them, but he wouldnt request them. (we will make them every now and then when i want my lemon fix).  i didnt use poppy seeds. but only because i didnt have any. i look forward to trying them with the seeds next time.

These pancakes are absolutely gorgeous.  High, fluffy with just the right amount of lemon flavour.  I served these with Nigella's blueberry and maple syrup sauce and it went together perfectly.

Thanks for this lovely recipe :)

This is  my recipe and I just wanted to say thanks to all who have tried it! These pancakes are great with the standard butter & syrup, but our favorite topping is simple macerated raspberries & a dollop of whip cream. In a small bowl, mix some fresh raspberries in sugar, let it sit out on the counter while making the pancake batter & they're ready to go when the pancakes are done! Use any berries you prefer. I also like the idea of a simple light dusting of powdered sugar to make them "finger-food-friendly"! Thanks everyone! Enjoy!

The only thing I changed was omitting the poppy seeds, just because I didn't have any:) I have two small kids (2 and 3) and they LOVE pancakes, but I dread the maple syrup mess. These pancakes eliminate this problem because they are so tasty with just some butter and a sprinkle of powdered sugar! Fabulous!

Made these pancakes for Sunday brunch and they were wondeful. They were very light and fluffy and as a result they disappeared quickly.

This is an excellent recipe.  My husband has been tweaking the recipe, trying to match the results to lemon yogurt pancakes at a wonderful restaurant near our home.  Today, I think he got it just right!

He cut the milk (nonfat) down to 1/4 cup, and he used 3 tablespoons of fresh lemon juice, omitting the vinegar, to curdle the milk.  He added 1/2 cup nonfat yogurt to the milk mixture after the curdling time passed.

He followed the recipe thereafter, except he omitted the poppy seeds. 

He topped the pancakes with a sprinkling of confectioner's sugar and a bit of fresh squeezed lemon juice.

The pancakes were delicious, light texture and and wonderful!

Seriously perfect.  I looove lemon flavored anything, and these pancakes hit the spot!  I doubled the recipe, used the juice of one whole lemon and the zest of 2 whole lemons.  I tried them with powdered sugar, honey, and light syrup (each separately).  You can't go wrong with any of them.  Super recipe!

I'm in love with these pancakes! I add a little extra poppyseed and lemon juice since I don't always have a lemon laying around for the zest, but they always turn out amazing!

My family absolutely loved this! I used lemon juice instead of the lemon shavings because I didn't have any fresh lemons but I think it would've worked better with the lemon shavings. Still amazing even at that.

We love these!  I may never make standard pancakes again.  I use all lemon juice to sour my milk.  When I don't have a fresh lemon on hand I skip the zest, and that works too.

These were quite possibly the best pancakes I've ever eaten in my life, as a real lemon lover I upped the zest some and served with a dollop of lemon curd.

These pancakes are very good!  I didn't have any fresh lemon, so I had to use lemon extract instead of the lemon zest.  The next time I will have the fresh lemon and I know it will be even better, if that's possible!  As with any pancake recipe, I separated the eggs and beat the whites into stiff peaks and then folded them into the batter right before pouring them onto the hot griddle.  This allows for the "fluffiest" pancakes.  I also sift the flour.  Really good recipe...a nice change to the typical pancakes!

I loved the lemon taste in these! In fact, when I doubled this recipe for a bigger group, there wasn't enough lemon taste. I sprinkled some extra lemon zest right onto each individual cooking pancake before flipping over. Yum. May I also recommend the accompaniment of homemade blueberry sauce? The combo of lemon and blueberry is irresistible!  I had to make mine gluten-free due to my allergy so I used Bob's Red Mill GF all-purpose flour - it works fine. I also substituted a healthier sugar substitute (erythritol). My pancakes were almost more like crepes. Very VERY good like that though

I made these delicious pancakes last week and EVERYONE loved them.  I will remember to double up the recipe next time because I had to make two batches.  My family couldn't get enough!

These were very good.  I don't care that PCAL thought the first part of the mix was glorified buttermilk.  I NEVER have buttermilk in the fridge and would have skipped this recipe if it called for it.  I did need to add 1/8 cup of milk as it was so thick and might add a tad more next time.  There will be a next time  Would love to serve with a fresh made blueberry compote.  Yum!

These were the STAR of Sunday brunch yesterday morning! I substituted fresh lemon juice for the vinegar, then followed the recipe exactly.  Served up with warm blueberry compote and fresh, lightly sweetened whipped cream...it was "sunshine" and "blue skies" on a plate! The pancakes were light and the flavors bright and fresh with just the right amount of lemon.  A wonderful Sunday Morning treat that's definitely worthy of a special occasion!

These pancakes are AMAZING!! I like to make mine on the thinner side so once I complete the mix I usually add a little bit of water to make it the right consistency (where it drips of the spoon immediately with a steady stream-don't know how else to explain it). I top them off by sprinkling them with a bit of powdered sugar and some organic blue agave nectar sweetener (in place of syrup). Delish!!!

These pancakes were fantastic and I highly recommend them. As a note, I had put my butter in the mircrowave to melt it and went about preparing my pancakes. It wasn't until I returned to the microwave to warm up my syrup that I realized the butter was still there. Whoops. I had already made about four of five pancakes at that point and they seemed fine without the butter so I carried on. I just thought I'd let any of you who might be trying to cut calories and fat know about my little mistake ;)

I double the recipe, except the baking powder/soda.  They cook up delicate and fluffy, and absolutely delicious.  I like to use the powdered lemon peel from penzys, mixed in with the dry ingredients.  Lovely flavor!  Tastes great paired with seedless raspberry jam.

These were good! I only have two minor nitpicks: one is that they don't taste all that lemony, and that was after I doubled the amount of lemon. Secondly, the mixture as the recipe calls for was really runny- the pancakes did not hold their form at all until I added some more flour. To be fair, I did use a gluten free flour mix with this, but I have never had a problem with it before. Other than those two things, these pancakes were great, made the batter the night before and then threw them on the griddle for a quick breakfast. The poppy seed flavor was perfect, maybe next time I'll spread them with lemon curd or something to really bring out the lemon flavor.

I made this for my husband & I for a Father's Day breakfast. We both loved it! The lemon tast was delightful, not overpowering and went very well with the poppy seeds.  One note - I used a 1/3 cup instead of 1/4 cup measurements, but really only made enough for 2 people.  I would at least double this if you're serving a family. It's a keeper!

These pancakes are so delicious!! I made them for my hubs for Father's Day and he & my two boys scarfed them all up. I doubled the recipe and after reading some reviews on lack of lemon flavor, added some pure lemon extract (1 tsp). I think they tasted wonderful. Served them sprinkled with powdered sugar & fresh strawberries. Really nice flavor combination and a recipe that will become a regular in breakfast rotation!

Ahhhhmazing! This was such a fun recipe to make, and they turned out so well! Fluffy and perfectly balanced flavors. I was going to make a blueberry topping but then realized we didn't have as many blueberries on hand as I thought, so I made a lemon/cream cheese topping instead. Mmm, the family raved. Thanks for an Awesome recipe!

Excellent! I served it with berry compote (just frozen berries defrosted and heated slightly), which was a perfect match.

If I made it again, I might try a few more poppy seeds and a little more lemon. But mostly just would keep it the same!

Recipe excellent as-is.  Very light and fluffy - almost delicate.  Not sweet, and you can't taste the lemon AT ALL, in case you were wondering, but really delicious.  I used 1.5 Tbsp olive oil instead of butter.

Fluffy, delicious pancakes. I too had trouble getting strong lemon flavour, next time I will use more zest and lemon juice. (and maybe a new microplane zester! ;p) I recommend doubling or tripling the recipe if you have more than two people. I will definitely make this again - simple, fast, and so yummy!

The whole family loved this recipe. I substituted apple sauce for the whipped cream accompaniment  (personal preference) and it was awesome. Will definitely become a feature in our household.

Made these for breakfast today (on a Sunday, of course!), and they were so fluffy and wonderful. My boyfriend can't stop raving about them. I did add 2T lemon juice rather than use the vinegar, and doubled the lemon zest and poppyseeds. In my opinion, using fresh lemons is essential for the flavor to really come out. I also made a blueberry compote to go with them (about a cup or so frozen blueberries, a few tablespoons sugar, + some lemon juice & zest) and that just put it over the top!

Very tasty. I might use all lemon juice instead of vinegar. Maybe 3tbs lemon juice. I used more zest, and next time 1 full tsp vanilla extract. Also, since I love poppy, I think you could do 4 tsp poppy seeds. Otherwise very good and fluffy.

Delicious - like a light and fluffy lemon-poppy muffin! I doubled the recipe and used half whole wheat flour.  I used 4 tsp lemon juice and 1 tsp vinegar instead of all the called for vinegar, and the zest of one lemon.  Yum.  Kids loved them, too.

These were absolutely fantastic! I made a reduction of blueberries and strawberries as a syrup to go over these pancakes which made a bit too many flavors. They have a great flavor all on their own. And a great fluffy texture.

The flavor was wonderful. Lemon was wonderful, and the poppy seeds made it all come together beautifully! Like the others say, it was a nice change from regular pancakes. 

I messed up the recipe a little bit because I doubled the recipe - should have only used one egg instead of two, despite the doubled recipe - they came out thinner and "light-fluffy"...as opposed to perfectly plump-fluffy and light, lol. But this was my mistake! We will be making this recipe regularly when we want to get away from regular pancakes. Thank you!!

We loved these! Doubled the batch for our family, but only used 3 T. of sugar instead of 4, next time might try it with only 2 T and see how we like them.  Used the zest of one lemon, did not really measure, but the pancakes were really good!

Delicious fluffy pancakes! The lemon isn't overpowering and the poppy seeds make the batter look adorable. A perfect pairing with blueberry maple syrup.

I used all of the juice and zest from one large lemon as other reviews suggested more lemon flavor needed.  I also did a half and half mixture with whole wheat and white flour to add to the nutritional value.  The best change I did was making these with my waffle iron!  Delicious :-)

I had both my daughters home for breakfast one day this week, which doesn't happen very often these days. So I decided to treat them with these. I couldn't have chosen a better recipe. I didn't change a thing and won't in the future either. Thanks for a lovely breakfast TTV78.

These pancakes were amazing!!! Nice and thick due to the "buttermilk action" created by the curdled milk.  We didn't have any fresh lemons, so we substituted lime zest instead. We also use 3x the amount of poppy seeds. The result was perfect!  We used a melted honey-butter mix instead of maple syrup so as not to overpower the lemon flavor - mmm! Definitely a new favorite!

Delicious!  Chloe made for dinner one night.  We made blueberry sauce to put on top.  The lemon flavor was very subtle, but great.  We also used lemon juice instead of vinegar.

I enjoyed these, but even after I upped the amount of lemon in them, I could just barely taste the lemon. I will be trying them again, but with MUCH more lemon than called for.

Light and fluffy, but not very lemony tasting. I didn't have any lemon zest so I don't know how much that mattered. And I used lemon juice out of the little plastic lemon container you get at the store. I know fresh lemons would be much better which I will try and use next time (and there will be a next time). If not, I will just put more lemon juice from the container in it. Trial and error. Worth trying though.

lovely pancakes, light and fluffy with a lemon flavor that isn't overwhelming.  Made it exactly as written and enjoyed every bite.  If you're making it for a family of 4 I recommend doubling it, the original yield won't make enough.  thanks for the recipe!

These are great! So fluffy! I, too, left out the vinegar and used 2 T of lemon juice. I also omitted the lemon zest, since I had to use lemon juice from concentrate and didn't have a lemon on hand. I also used whole wheat flour, as someone suggested here, to make them healthier.

These pancakes were exceptional!  I made them exactly like the recipe said and they were amazing.  We used different syrups.  Blueberry, boysenberry and pecan were the favorites.  Just butter and powdered sugar was great as well.  Thank you so much!

We loved these before they were even cooked!  The smell as we were mixing them had my daughter hovering over the counter asking how long until they'd be ready.  We followed the recipe exactly (even though I hesitated over the vinegar), and I wouldn't change a thing.  Just the right amount of lemon for us, and very fluffy!
1/31/11 - Just made these again, and they weren't as lemony.  I realized the first time I accidentally added 1 Tbsp. of lemon zest instead of a teaspoon.  Definintely recommend more lemon zest!

Everyone absolutely loved these and quite honestly I believe these were the best pancakes I have ever eaten. I added a a little more lemon to the recipe mostly because of the like of lemon flavoring.

We made this recipe 2 mornings in a row because they tasted so good.  We accidentally added an extra 3/4 cup of milk, which made them taste more like Swedish Pancakes. We also cut out the vinegar and used the juce from a whole lemon instead. Replaced the white sugar with Brown sugar and used 1 Tablespoon Poppy Seeds.  Tastes almost like sourdough pancakes and they are just delicious. Orange marmalade and homemade berry jam topped them off.

This is a 5 star recipe.  My 16 year old son said they taste like a pancake mixed with a lemon poppy seed muffin.  I made it exactly as the recipe states except I used Lactaid milk.  They were gone before they had a chance to cool.  yummy!

Great recipe, we absolutely loved it! We also used wheat flour and topped them off with some raspberries and raw honey. We will definitely make them again!

I love lemon-poppyseed muffins, so this pancake recipe caught my eye. I made the recipe exactly as listed and they turned out perfect. Very light and fluffy, and the flavor is spot on. I will share this recipe with others and will use it often for guests in our home.

Awesome pancakes! I added 1/8 cup of whole milk to the finished batter to thin it out a bit, but the whole family loved these :) very fluffy and light.

Delicious! I made a lemon glaze to drizzle because they did need a little "something" to sweeten them up. Delicious on their own, for sure but we sweetened it up for a special breakfast with the kiddies.

A great recipe. I didn't have poppy seeds, so I added 3 tbsps of shredded coconut instead of it.  I added 2 tsps of lime zest and 3 tbsps of lime juice instead of vinegar. I substituted whole wheat flour for ap flour and vegetable oil for butter. It was so tasty! Great with condensed milk!

I doubled the poppy seeds opted out of the vinegar doubling the lemon juice because I didn't see the need for the vinegar.... also I didn't have lemon zest so i added a drop of lemon extract... turned out very good... my dad was originally making fun of me for "ruining pancakes" but after he tried them he said they were better than normal... next time I will try to have some zest... but they turned out good.. the way I made them... definitely double the recipe single doesn't make enough for 4 people... they disappear fast

I followed the recipe to  T.  They smelled delicious while I was preparing them, but was disappointed that they weren't more lemon-y.  I will add more zest and squeeze more juice next time.  Very light and fluffy!  Will try again!

Pancakes are not my favorite meal but they're nice to make when company is around. These were easy to make, very fluffy, and had a nice light flavor. More of a personal preference of mine is why I only give it 3 stars. For others who really like pancakes, this is a great and easy way to mix things up.

I enjoyed these, but I did make some changes. I'm on South Beach so I used whole wheat flour, smart balance, and Splenda. The first time I made them I found that they didn't have enough lemon flavor for me, so I started adding a teaspoon of lemon extract. PERFECT!!! Also, this time around I didn't realize I was out of eggs until I was in the middle of making the recipe, so I substituted a little bit of no-sugar-added applesauce (I just put in what I thought looked like the equivalent to 1 egg, LOL) and it was fine like that. I will say that I have left out the vinegar everytime, too...almost forgot that. I like the recipe and have made it 3 times so far. Thanks!!!

These are pretty good. Definitely something different. My batter turned out a little runny and made flat pancakes at first, so I added a little flour and they were just fine. A healthy alternative to lemon poppy seed bread. Tastes great served with blueberry syrup.

This was an excellent pancake, but the lemon poppy seed flavor was very mild. I did use 2 T of lemon juice and 1 teaspoon of zest.

I made these as another reviewer suggested and left out the vinegar and used 2 TBS of lemon juice rather than one. I also had to omit the poppy seeds as I didn't have any on hand.  I put butter on them and dusted with powdered sugar just like the photo and topped with fresh strawberries. Would love to try with a flavored syrup such as blueberry or with some lemon curd and whipped cream.  My picky 3 yr old ate 5 pancakes himself.

Yum! Very easy, and delicious--from someone who isn't the biggest fan of pancakes.  However, they are adjustable (didn't have lemon zest so I just used more lemon juice) and don't make too many (doubled the recipe and got about 7 pancakes).  And they didn't really need syrup or sugar in my opinion--I ate with fruit and they were great.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very delicious! A nice change from your regular pancakes. These would be nice to prepare for overnight guests. I paired it with Blueberry Breakfast Sauce by Ellen on this site. I doubled both recipes (in the sauce I do not double the water, we like it thick). My husband tried a bit of one pancake with pure maple syrup and he said the flavors didn't work well together, definitely do the blueberry sauce!

I too used fresh lemon juice as called for and in place of the vinegar and used the zest. It gave them a nice subtle flavor. My son loves lemon and he was in heaven! When he saw the title of the recipe, he suggested that we make these on any day of the week, not just Sunday mornings! I will make them again and I may add more poppy seeds next time.

These were delicious & a favorite at my house! 
I did use wheat flour in place for flour and brown sugar for the sugar  to make it a little healthier. 
These were especially great with blueberry syrup!

FABULOUS! Even better if frozen then heated in the microwave. The flavors marry in the freezer and they are super moist. Added zest and juice of 2 lemons. Didn't use vinegar. The lemon juice will curdle the milk by itself.  Added almond extract. Will experiment with add ins (cream cheese, lemon yogurt or sour cream) to make a thicker pancake.

These have excellent flavor and I loved everything about them.  However, I did have to add about an extra 1/4 c. flour because they weren't fluffing up quite the way they should have with the original amount (I'm at 700 ft. elevation, so the amount of flour may vary from your location).

I love Lemon Poopy Seed muffins and thought I would love these.  Unfortunatley, I was completely unimpressed by these pancakes!  Followed the recipe exactly.  Will NOT make these again.

I made this for breakfast and it was exactly how I hoped/expected it to be. My husband said they were 'good', but he does not typically care for lemon poppy seed. Well I do, and if you do too then you should make these!

Everyone in my family liked this recipe, I however, would have preferred more lemon flavor.  Maybe more zest?  I also thought they were kind of thick, I think next time I will try a little more milk.

Excellent flavor and texture.  They were so good, they didn't need syrup or sugar.  We ate them with just a little bit of butter like you would a muffin.  Will definitely make these again - and soon.  Thanks for sharing.

Yummy.    Next time I will skip the vinegar--use lemon juice instead and add another tsp. of lemon zest.   We wanted to taste more lemon in it.   Serve it with powdered sugar.

Made these for Sunday Morning breakfast. Loved them! I am very fond of lemon poppy seed muffins and I was thrilled that the  pancakes tasted and smelled just as good. Can't wait to make them again.

YUM. I used half whole wheat, half unbleached flour, soy milk, nixed the vinegar & lemon juice, substituted low fat greek yogurt for butter, Splenda & 1 tsp. lemon extract bc I that's what we had. Very delicious.

I'm picky about pancakes and these were fabulous.  The hint of lemon is just perfect.  My kids didn't even want anything on top - they just ate them plain.  Amazing.

This was fantastic even considering I forgot the egg and vanilla!!!! Im not sure how I forgot the egg but I ended up using a few tablespoons of milk to thin the batter before frying. Guess I wouldn't have had to do that had I included the egg! Was a VERY nice change from pancakes with maple syrup. I doubled the recipe for two adults and 3 kids and it wasn't enough.

Light, fluffy, delicious, and even my two kids ages 2 and 4 loved them. This recipe didn't make enough to fill the four of us up, but it did make pancakes per person. It left us wanting more!! Very flavorful.

YUM! Followed directions exactly but doubled it to have leftovers. The only thing I will do differently is add a touch more lemon zest. My family loves the lemon flavor. Very good - will make again!

I liked the poppy seed crunch, but the lemon flavor didn't come through and it was a bit heavy for my taste. If I ever made these again, I would up the Lemon zest, add lemon extract and increase the milk to 1 cup.

I completely messed up the order of ingredients and even had one pancake cooking when I realized I missed 3 ingredients. So I scooped it back into the batter bowl, added the ingredients, and cooked them again and it still turned out awesome. Great alternative to a pancake and I'm sure the next time around they will be even better!

I'm really surprised at how tasty and light these pancakes turned out.  I really love lemon, so following the advice of many other reviewers, I doubled the zest.  I actually forgot to add the egg, and I think that made my pancakes even lighter! Next time I'll triple the zest and add some more lemon juice, since the flavor was just barely discernible. My youngest and I ate the entire single batch! If cooking for more than two people, I'd advise you to triple the batch.

I love these, they are one of my favorite weekend breakfasts. I use milk and lemon juice to create the needed buttermilk. I don't have lemon zest at the house so I just omit that and serve these with a homemade vanilla syrup. Delicious!

Delicious! Followed the recipe exactly. Perfect for a sweet little lemon snack. I dusted mine with powdered sugar and squeezed lemon juice over the sugar for a super sweet super lemony treat. If you love lemon poppy this recipe is a must!

These are alright. Sadly I didn't see that much of an improvement over regular pancakes. My husband and I couldn't really taste much of a difference. They also aren't fluffy enough for me.

These pancakes turn out very fluffy and nice. I used 1/2 whole wheat flour with regular flour and a bit more poppy seeds.  They were perfect!

Pros:  Great idea, good pancake texture, instructions accurate.
Cons:  Not lemony, poppy-y enough
Our preference:  Replace vinegar with additional lemon juice (2Tbsp total, but no extra).  Add extra zest (from 2-3 lemons, 2 tsp minimum).  Extra poppy seeds (we use triple!)
Thanks for a yummy recipe!

I made the recipe as is (with the exception of 1/4 of the flour being wheat flour) and the kids loved them.  They were the lightest, fluffiest pancake I have made from scratch.  Next time, I plan to use all lemon juice instead of vinegar to sour the milk and I may reduce the poppy seed (just because I don't care for that flavor as much as the lemon).  We ate it with blueberries and cool whip instead of syrup and it was a great combination of flavor.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Nice lemon flavor. I used whole wheat pastry flour. The batter was really thick, so I had to add a little water.

I took a shortcut with this recipe and it still turned out great. I used 1 cup ready made pancake mix and followed the directions on the back of the box (something like add one egg, milk, and some oil). Then for the lemon poppyseed part I added the zest of one entire lemon, the juice of half a lemon, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and one teaspoon poppyseeds. Quicker and easier than making from scratch and tasted amazing!

Followed the recipe as written, although used fresh squeezed lemon  juice and I doubled the lemon zest.  I will make it again but I will double the lemon juice as the family did not really taste the lemon.

Great recipe! The pancakes were delicious. If I were to make the recipe again, I would probably omit the sugar from the batter...as someone who likes to eat pancakes with maple syrup, it was unnecessary. Additionally, I think the recipe needs more lemon zest. I used the zest of one whole lemon and the taste didn't come through as much as I would have liked.

These are the bomb! Served alongside bananas with softened peanut butter on top, glazed with maple syrup--this was the perfect Shrove Tuesday spoiler event. It was so good we made a second batch for seconds. Some considerations--add about 1/4-1/3 more cup than what is being called for if you do not want so thick of a pancake; make sure to use fresh lemon juice (and not the liquid concentrate!)

Thanks.  This is the best pancake recipe I've found on this site.  For one thing, the recipe actually makes 8 full-sized pancakes.  They had great flavor and cooked quick without burning.  I did everything as written except I used dried grated lemon peel instead of zest and I used orange juice instead of milk (I was out of milk).  I also used rice vinegar because that's what I had.

Excellent, excellent, excellent. I have made these three times in the past two day! Wonderful flavor and fluffy. I even used all whole-wheat flour, and 2 tablespoons of honey instead of sugar, and they turned out absolutely wonderfully. Thank you for the recipe!

I followed the review where they substituted more lemon juice rather than adding the vinegar. They turned out great! Definitely going to use this recipe again :)

These were yummy! I used 2 TBSP lemon juice instead of using vinegar.  I doubled the poppyseeds, and used 1/4 tsp vanilla extract and 1/4 tsp lemon extract. Yum! Used maple syrup!

Love these pancakes. You feel guilty eating them because they taste that good. Just a heads up it makes 8 really really small pancakes. I double the recipe if I make them for more than 2 people.

I used 1/4 cup lemon juice (1T instead of vinegar, one for itself, and an extra) and about 1-1/2t zest, plus 2t poppy seeds--made very nice pancakes that were lemony without being intrusive.  Served with blueberries simmered a bit with a little real maple syrup.  I bet it'd be even better with a few chopped pecans added to the mix.  Yum!  I'll do this again!

Wonderful idea and break from the Blueberry, banana, or strawberry...pancake! I adjusted the recipe so this is not a review of "as written". I skipped the vinegar by doubling the lemon, used the zest of 1 lemon vs 1 tsp. Everything else remained the defined. The quantity of poppy seed seemed a bit anemic as I mixed the dry ingredients, but turned out to be just perfect. These are wonderfully fluffy pancakes. Even though I cranked up the lemon the flavor was pronounced but not overwhelming.

I found this mix to be too thick to pour and needed to add additional milk.  Otherwise I didn't change a thing.  However, using lemon curd as a topping instead of syrup was the trick to adding additional lemon flavor.  Yum!  I will try this recipe again.

These turned out wonderful.  I make pancakes most Saturday mornings for the family.  Doubled the recipe (except for the salt) and used all of the lemon rind from one large lemon (1 1/2 T).  Thanks for the delicious recipe.

Awesome!!  Made the perfect yield of pancakes, and you're not HUNGRY 15 minutes later!  Great lemon taste.  I doubled the poppyseeds though as they are more visible then, (and it's a fun game with the kids to see how many are stuck in your teeth after the meal!!)

Very good recipe. I used kosher, large grain salt that sort of "popped" on my tongue. As is, the pancakes aren't terribly lemony. The one improvement I will make next time is more lemon: 1 Tbsp zest and 3 tsp juice.

Very good.  Less sweet than a lemon/poppy seed muffin, but very satisfying.  I tried one batch with maple syrup and another batch topping them with lemon curd - both worked well.

AWESOME!! I made these for lunch on a 'snow day' and the kids loved them.  I did not have a lemon so used orange zest.  As stated they were light and fluffy, and complemented well with a blueberry sauce.  Thank- you!

I added 1/2 cup of dried cranberries (after re-hydrating them in microwave for 20 seconds) and 3/4 cup of chopped pecans, instead of the lemon juice and zest.  Turned out pretty good.

This was by all means a terrible recipe. The batter was completely liquid and just ran out all over the griddle, the batter didn't rise, it wasn't lemony at all. Terrible and will not be making again.

One of my favorite things is making breakfast for the family. I honestly love trying new recipes on them and although we have a few pickies this recipe was a hit with everyone.

 Always making a recipe my own I did riff a bit. I added approx 1/8 tsp of nutmeg and dash of allspice. Then I swapped the vanilla for almond extract....amazing results and felt like the almond made the taste sweeter! This is a winner and so glad I tripled the batch to put some in the freezer for a later time. Thank you for this gem!

Excellent recipe!  I changed it only a little, I mixed a big spoonful of lemon curd into the batter.  Then once I ladled the batter on to the skillet I put little tiny spoons of lemon curd and then sprinkled some frozen Maine wild blueberries on.  I then drizzled on a little bit more batter just to lightly cover blueberries and lemon curd.  Sinfully good sprinkled with confectionary sugar!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

The recipe as-is came out a little bland, so the 2nd time around, I increased the amount of lemon zest and lemon juice, plus, I added dry wheat farina (1/3 cup), honey and instead of regular milk, I used a combination of buttermilk and almond milk and instead of white sugar, I used coconut sugar. The 2nd batch with modifications were much more fluffy and quite savory. My kids and husband couldn't stop eating them, so I cooked up an additional batch for the week's breakfast. They taste delicious with fresh fruit strawberries too! All-in-all, very satisfied, and will definitely make them again!

Made these this morning, exactly as written and loved them.  Like a few others, I used a raspberry jam to go with these pancakes as opposed to syrup and it was an excellent compliment.  Easy enough to make, and enjoyable enough to eat makes these an instant regular in the rotation.

These pancakes were really good. I followed the recipe to a T. They were very fluffy and light. Two notes though: First, the recipe only made 9 pancakes (approx 3” diameter) for me, so you may need to double; Second, as I have learned by previous experience, make sure you zest the lemon before slicing it for the juice. Much easier that way.

I love making these pancakes as a special breakfast. I've never been able to use the lemon zest, so they don't end up having a strong lemon flavor. Nevertheless, they are light and tender and my husband loves them  This morning we had them with maple syrup, bacon and mangos.

These pancakes always turn out nice and fluffy! I find that the lemon juice is enough to curdle the milk and usually leave out the vinegar.

This recipe is awesome with a couple modifications! After reading the reviews and considering I wanted to put maple syrup on these cakes and desired a more intense lemon flavor I did the following.

If you plan on serving this with a sweet blueberry sauce or maple syrup, reduce the sugar by 1/2 tablespoon. Add zest of the whole lemon to the flour mixture. Also add an additional tablespoon or tablespoon an a half (or even more) of lemon juice to the milk mixture when you're adding the butter, vanilla and egg. I will probably add even more next time. I also added an extra 1/2 teaspoon of poppy seeds.

This batter is so fluffy and light! It made three 8-inch pancakes, so while it might not serve 4 - it definitely could serve three with a side of bacon or bowl of fruit. I also plopped about 8 frozen blueberries on top of each pancake after pouring batter into my pan. Didn't weigh them down at all :) Just made them even more yummy.

This is a keeper!

Truly 5 star pancakes. I suggest doubling the recipe for a happy family of 4 (with leftovers) and for ease of ingredients. One full lemon zested & that same lemon juiced is perfect for the double recipe. Want to zest it up? Try adding vanilla chips or substituting some or all of the butter with coconut oil.

I have made this a few times. As the recipe states it is good. To add a little more lemon flavor I use the full zest of a medium lemon as well as all the juice. I only use what is called for in the milk  mixture and then add the rest of them lemon when mixing the batter.  Let the batter rest a few minutes aftet mixing before cooking to allow it to fluff up a bit more. The pancakes are very good, a blueberry compote on top would put this recipe over the top.

Per another review, I doubled the recipe to make about 8 pancakes. I needed to add an additional 1/4c milk to thin the batter slightly. Other than that these were good. I spread with butter and Smucker's Blueberry Lemon fruit spread, because I forgot to refrigerate my real maple syrup after opening and it went bad. I would make these again!

I made this with 1/2 whole wheat + 1/2 all purpose flour as well as 2 Tbsp of honey in place of the sugar.

The texture came out great, but it lacked lemon flavor for my taste, and that's with an additional half Tbsp of lemon juice. I would also have liked a little more height on the pancakes, but that may be due to the addition of whole wheat flour. 

I would make this recipe again, but with an additional 1/2 tsp of lemon zest or a teeny bit of lemon extract. :)

Tasted great, just like a lemon muffin! I added 1tbsp of poppy seeds  instead of 1tsp though. Only thing I found it to be very thick so I just spread them out thinner with spatula so it cooked in the centre before outsides burnt. I will add full cup of milk next time. It could of been that I used almond milk too though.

These were a hit! I needed to add some more milk to thin out the batter enough to make pancakes that would cook all the way through before getting too brown, and I wish the lemon flavor was stronger, but overall this is quite a good recipe.

Delicious! Like eating cake for breakfast. We doubled the lemon zest and kept everything else per the recipe. Don't over cook them. We flipped them when they were golden with no bubbles forming yet and it was perfect.

Subbed unsweetened almond milk. Zested an entire lemon, used juice from half, which was more than the recipe called for. Could still be more lemony, next time will add a bit more juice. Very fluffy, lovely texture!

I used King Arthur white whole wheat flour and a flax egg and there pancakes were light, fluffy, amazing.  Might add a touch more zest next time.  Can't wait to serve these pancakes to family.  Thanks for posting this terrific recipe!

My family of five loved these! The only change I made was to add slightly more flour or the batter will be thin, I also doubled the recipe to be sure there was enough (a small bit left over)! I would recommend that users of this recipe use the actual juice from a lemon NOT CONCENTRATED BOTTLED LEMON JUICE. Overall the pancakes were light and fluffy and with the perfect hint of lemon. I may try a few mint leaves and sliced strawberries for a garnish next time!??

Yum!! I substituted 3/4 + 2T buttermilk and two tablespoons lemon juice instead of souring the milk, as buttermilk tends to thicken more than soured milk. The taste was delicious and the texture perfectly fluffy. The only reason I rated this four stars instead of five is because I felt it needed both more poppy seeds and more lemon zest. I added an extra half teaspoon of poppy seeds when I could only barely see them in the batter, but couldn't really add more lemon until after I had tasted the finished product. Still, a good recipe and one that will remain in my arsenal!

These pancakes and light and fluffy and really delicious. Not overpowering in lemon - just right. I made a few changes based in the ingredients I had... I didn't have real milk, so I used light plain soymilk and it still curdled a bit with the lemon. I also skipped the vinegar and just used the juice from a while lemon. Also, I didn't have poppyseeds, so I left that out altogether. And as others suggested, I used ½ regular flour and ½ whole wheat flour, which gave it a nice texture and nuttiness. I make this when I had an unexpected guest for breakfast and we both enjoyed it. Next time I'll make it closer to the regular recipe, but I'll probably still use the lemon instead of vinegar and combine while wheat and all-purpose flour, since those additions were tasty!

After reading previous reviews I used all lemon juice instead of vinegar and also used the rind off of 2 lemons. they were plenty lemony. These were tasty. That being said, I probably will not make them again. They tasted like the muffins, but not as sweet, so it felt like something was missing. I think I'll probably just leave the lemon poppy seeds to cakes and muffins.

Not lemony enough for my liking. Sprinkle with lemon juice just before serving, and use all lemon juice instead of vinegar. Next time I'll double up on the poppy seeds. These were a great change from the normal routine. Will make again soon!

These were pretty good, very lemony. I followed the recipe exactly for a triple batch, served with bacon. We tried it with store bought blueberry syrup and regular pancake syrup and I was surprised to find we preferred the regular syrup with these. My children (3 and 8) enjoyed them just fine but my husband was NOT impressed. He likes my lemon bars but did not appriciate me "messing" with his pancakes. I am freezing the leftovers for quick breakfasts on days he is away on business trips.
