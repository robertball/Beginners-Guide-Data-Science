I like the combo of sweet and white potatoes.  If you don't want a mayo-based salad, apple cider vinegar and extra virgin olive oil make a fine substitute dressing.  Yum...

I thought this recipe was wonderful and truly unique.  I rarely give 5 stars, but really felt this recipe was worthy.  I used veganaise (instead of regular mayo) and omitted the jalapeno pepper - it was still spicy enough for me.  I would suggest you start with half the amount of curry powder and add more to taste.  I put the full amount in and felt it was just a tad too strong.  It still tasted great, but next time I'm going to try it this way aiming for the "what's in there?" mystery level of curry rather than "wow that curry tastes good".  I also substituted 1/2 of the red potatos for blue ones.  This made for a very colorful dish.

This is delicious!  I used a small onion instead of large, minced jalapenos from a jar, lime juice instead of lemon, half mayonaise and half sour cream, and added two stalks of chopped celery and 4 chopped hard boiled eggs.  It was a big hit - I'll make again and again!

I wanted to bring something 'different' to a party.  I love love love sweet potatoes, but wasn't crazy about this salad.  However, it was a TREMENDOUS hit with everybody and was completely gone in a flash !  Thanks!

This was okay but not a big hit at a family gathering.  I used half the amount of curry and it was still strong.  Probably will not make again.

I made this as one of the salads for my son's high school graduation party about a month ago.  I'm STILL getting requests for the recipe!  I personally don't do sweet potatoes, but this was excellent.

This is great!  Served to a visiting "meat and potatoes" man and he almost licked the plate.  Onions we have been getting have been so strong that I tried putting 1/2 red onion and 1/4 c. celery and it was almost as good.

An interesting, zippy 3-potato salad.  Not for all, but a nice side dish with burgers, hot dogs, and chicken.

This potato salad is truly 5 star. It was this recipe that made me join 'all recipies' it is fantastic!! The hint of spice gives this salad a kick and lifts it from something ordinary to something special.  Great for pot luck events.

This has been a big hit this year, but here are some minor changes I make each time: I use Yukon Golds and Sweet Potatoes. I also omit the red onion and substitute green onions: then you can use the jalapeno OR put in 2 tsp of sriracha hot chili sauce (in the Asian section of the grocery store). Excellent dish!

My husband didn't like the strong curry taste in the salad, even though I'd already cut down the amount of curry by half.  I didn't mind the curry, but thought there was too much lemon juice.

I have to say this was really unique.  One of my local grocery stores makes a three potato salad that has sweet potatoes in it so I knew that this was really a great addition to potato salad.  The curry flavor really punched things up.  I liked it, I think I would also consider the addition of green onion, I also omitted jalapeno pepper because it kills my stomach.  Overall though, nice color, great flavor, fairly easy, and sweet potatoes are good for you, all good reasons to try this one.

This recipe is great!  I thought the curry was a little too strong, so next time, I'll cut it down to 1/2-3/4 T; also, the onions turned out kind of stringy; I'll quarter and then thinly slice.  But overall a wonderful alternative to traditional potato salad!

I was cooking Caribbean-Spicked Pork Side Ribs from this site and I wanted something that would compliment it and this sounded good. It was a hit - I've been asked to make this again for next week-end!  I followed the recipe exactly except that I did not cook the potatoes the day before (missed that when I was reading but will try that next time).  I did make the salad very early in the day and let it sit in the fridge most of the day before serving.  Patty also said to slice the onion and add salt and let it sit and then sqeeze out the water.  I never heard of that either - but I had time to do that!  Well thanks Patty - I learned something new and useful.  The salt changes the consistency of the onion (really neat!)  I will cook the potatoes a day ahead of time the next time to see what the difference is.  In any event Patty, thanks for sharing your recipe.  It's a keeper.

Excellent!  I made three changes from the published recipe: 1) I used dried jalepeno instead of minced fresh; 2) (at the suggestion of another reviewer, I used half sour cream and half mayo; and 3) I added a healthy sprinkling of fresh watercress along with (Italian) parsley.  Great stuff...warm and spicy while cool and light...go figure!

Oh man, this recipe is in a class of it's own. I followed recipe exactly, and made it the evening before, and I thought it got better with age. I have never been a sweet potato lover until now. My hat is off to Patty for submitting this great recipe.

This was a fun alternative to regular potato salad and sweet potatoes are so good for you.  I thought this salad was great.  However, I did not like they soggy onion technique.  I would just put normal raw onion in the salad next time.

This was ok.  The sweet potatoes added  an interesting flavor but something was missing for me.  Probably the lack of tanginess from pickles or vinegar.  Probably won't make again.

Killer potato salad!  I am always asked for the recipe, people love the addition of sweet potatos, and the curry is such a wonderful complement to the flavors.  Sometimes I leave the curry out and use fresh dill, chopped dill pickle, and sprinkle pickle juice on the potatos.  Thanks for sharing this terrific summer recipe!

I've made this potato salad multiple times for various parties and it's ALWAYS been a great hit. I think this is a simple recipe so it's hard to mess it up - thank goodness! A trusty, creative and tasty potato salad. Yum!

this was really excellent!  A big hit with BBQ ribs.  I made the dressing the night before as well when I did the potatoes, had to use a yam though, and it really tasted fantastic!  Husband and his Boss loved it!

Great recipe.  Nice mix of flavors and texture.  Since I didn't have curry powder, I substituted for cumin with a bit of chili powder- it tasted great.

I really wanted to like this but I made it for Thanksgiving and most of it got thrown out. I don't know if everybody is just hung up on my standard potato salad or if it was the curry (which is the strongest flavor in the salad) but it just didn't fly. I didn't think the sweet potatoes and the curry were complimentary. I'll keep looking for a favorite sweet potato salad. Thanks anyway.

Not perhaps a fair assessment as I made this without the jalapeno and with less curry.  I added hardboiled eggs and bacon but with the jalapeno pepper the flavour of these would be lost.  I did not enjoy the texture of the sweet potato although the other potatoes were wonderful.  Next time I would increase the curry, omit the sweet potato and try it with yams.  I would also reduce the lemon and add a few tablespoons of white sugar to compliment the heat of the curry and pepper.  This is best prepared a day in advance to let the flavours blend.

I liked this recipe and agree it's a nice change from the typical potato salad at picnics.  I added steamed asparagus to it, but otherwise used the recipe as written - dressing is wonderful.  Thanks!

Brilliant - this is a regular at BBQ's - I'm always asked to make the potato salad!  I use chillis instead of pimentos (as I never have pimentos in the fridge) and just white potatoes as its all I usually have.  Really tangy and the curry sets it off nicely.

Can't believe I haven't rated this before-made it at least two times dating back to 2007.  Wonderful combination of flavors and spice.  This time I used a sweet curry powder and that was awesome.  I may try as one reviewer said about using half sour cream.  Anyway, be sure to try this one following all the submitters recommendations-you can't lose with this!

I prefer very plain potato salad, so I made this more for Husband than for myself. I used regular white potatoes as that's what I had on hand, and I didn't bother with the parsley as we don't like it very much. Also added a pinch of salt. Thanks, Patty!

This is so good - I'll never make a potato salad without sweet potatoes again. I didn't have jalapenos or curry powder, so I added red pepper.  Also substituted sour cream for some of the mayo and added a little honey, brown sugar, and dijon mustard. Used 1/2 sweet onion, but red would've looked nicer. The result was tangy, sweet, spicy, creamy, and just plain perfect. I look forward to making this again and again! Thank you so much, Patty!

Loved it! I've been looking for a good sweet potato salad recipe and decided to try this one. I used all sweet potatoes, omitted the jalapeno pepper, 1/2 sour cream and 1/2 mayonnaise, a bit less of the curry powder as recommended in other reviews, and cilantro instead of parsley since i didn't have any around and it tasted great! My husband loved it!

I loved this! I only used sweet potatoes and increased the garlic because I am a garlic nut. I did what others did and used half and half mayo/sour cream. Love the curry flavour in this! Thanks!!!

Very good.  I would add another jalapeno next time (could barely taste the 1) and I added celery for crunch.  I think it's important to use a good brand of  curry...it will make or break the salad.  Good stuff!

Made it for the  first time for my vegan gal and she loved it.  Mostly stuck to the recipe, doubling the amounts, until I realized I forgot the onion and had no mayo.

I used her Veganaise she keeps in the fridge and half a frozen bag of tri-colored onions & bell peppers I keep in the freezer.

I agree w/ the other reviews that it's important to let it set overnight.  It was good when I first stirred it up but much better the next morning.

The only change I'd make is to add more jalepeno pepper...oh, and I had to use jarred peppers... but I tend to like my foods extra spicy.  

On the whole, a very good recipe.

12/5/19:  Made it again w/ more jalepeno peppers and three, not two sweet potatoes.  Per the recipe, I was more careful to keep the potatoes firm before letting then cool and them putting them in the fridge overnight.  (I used a steamer.) 

Used Veganaise for my vegan gf again and it all turned out very good.  Also helps that I used fresh onion and parsley.
2/11/20:  Used all sweet potatoes twice and it still comes out very good.  Definitely chill overnight and use fresh red onion and parsley.  My lady loves it.

Sick of the soupy store-bought tater salads, I've been trying different recipes from AR, and this one was superb.

Right off the bat, I'll say I prefer to roast my potatoes vs boiling them because it gives the end product a more robust potato flavor.  In this case I diced unpeeled potatoes into 5/8-3/4" cubes, tossed with 1-1/2 tablespoons EVOO and salt and pepper to taste, roasted at 400F for 35 minutes, let cool for 15-20 minutes.

For the sauce, I cut the mayo by 50% and added 1/2 cup lite sour cream. The rest was by the book.  Folded in the potatoes, onion and jalapeno, and let sit in the fridge for 24 hours.  Wonderful!  The curry was definitely not over powering, and the jalapenos only lent a mild very heat; first removing the seeds and white inner flesh eliminates most of the jalapenos' heat.  I will only add 1) this recipe makes A LOT of potato salad, and 2) the end potato-to-sauce ratio is perfect.

I love sweet potatoes, but I just thought this was ok.  I didn't have jalapenos, so I gave a few shakes of red pepper flakes. I guess I'm also not used to cumin in a salad like this. It was good to try for something different (and I had sweet potatoes that needed to be used up), but I guess I prefer good, old fashioned, regular potato salad.

This was great!  I did take away one star because the sweet potatoes just fell apart in the salad ...  But I will say it didn't make a difference to the flavor and the other potatoes were perfectly firm. I substituted with lite mayo, regular baking potatoes, sweet onions and left out the jalapeños.  Delicious!  I would definitely make this again.

Different in a great way. Was having friends over for dinner and wanted a new way to serve sweet potatoes. Everyone loved it. Left the jalapenos on the side because of the kids, good with or without them. Definitely making again.

This is a winner!  An unexpected pairing of flavors that works so well.  It is a lovely change of pace from traditional potato salad.  I like to use veganaise to make this for potlucks and picnics.  With no dairy or eggs, you don't have to be as concerned with how long it is unrefrigerated.  A favorite everywhere I've served it.

Each time I've made this it has gone over very well and people either want the receipe or want it made for the next event. I've added more jalapeno, curry, and lemon juice and the zing is great ! Just like any seasonings, " to your own taste " .

I love curry! I don't know where I went wrong with this recipe, but I wasn't a huge fan. The flavors were over the top, which I usually prefer, but in this case I didn't. It wasn't bad by any means, just not what I was hoping for based on the reviews.
