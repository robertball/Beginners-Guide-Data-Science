I loved this.  I used 1 15oz can of diced tomatoes, and 1 24oz can (I think) of canned sweet potatoes instead of the fresh versions, just to speed things up.  The only problem I had was finding a saucepan big enough to fit all the ingredients in!  I ended up only adding half of the "water" (I used veggie broth instead) at first and not adding the other half until the end when the peanut butter was added.  I used crunchy peanut butter rather than peanut butter + peanuts.  Cilantro on top was great!  I pureed about half of the soup and left the other half chunky.  I served it over brown rice in a bowl.  A great meal!

This soup is very good. It has such a unique combination of flavors. I love peanut butter so I doubled the amount called for and it turned out great. The leftovers actually tasted better the next day so I think next time I'll make it ahead of time, since it is fairly time consuming to make.

This recipe is inexpensive, easy, quick to make and was a HUGE hit at the party at which I served it.  There was only one total vegetarian there, but the omnivores gobbled it down, even though there was another pot of soup (which also got rave reviews) and other food there.  This soup was the hit of the night.  It has an exotic taste (much like Indian food, as you can imagine from the spices, plus I used garam masala instead of the cinnamon and cloves), but that nice, nutty peanut butter flavour is there as well.

The only other thing I did different than the recipe was omit usage of the blender.  I just smashed it all together with a potato masher.

I have made this about four times and have it down to a science. It is my favorite recipe that I have made from AllRecipes so far. Flavorful, interesting and easy. The only shortcuts I take are canned tomatoes and chunky peanut butter. The cilantro on top really completes this soup. Highly recommend!

I loved this recipe!  I used a 900 ml carton of vegetable broth instead of the water and added a 19 oz can of chickpeas.  I used 2 medium-sized yams, rather than sweet potatoes, and I don't know how much they weighed.  I only pureed about half of the recipe and then added 1/4c of dried black currants at the end and let it cook for another 5 minutes to plump the currants.  Adding the fruit made this recipe similar to the Delicious Chickpea Curry (also on this site), but this was so much better with the peanut butter and chopped peanuts. Really good combination of flavours.

This is a really good vegetarian soup.  If it is served with rice you get a complete protein.  When I made it I substituted vege stock for the water, cooked it longer and blended it less.  I think if i was making it for company I would blend it thoroughly and top it with a little fresh tomato along with the cilantro.  It is a beautiful color.

As is, I give it a 4 star. I actually used 4 cups of vegetable broth, 2 cups of chicken broth, 2 loaded tsps of cumin and coriander, 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne, about 4 tbls of peanut butter, and added half of a jalepeno pepper. I omitted the peanuts and used chunky peanut butter instead. With the revisions, it came out much more flavorful and delicious. We paired this with a simple tuna melt which was divine.

I made this soup as a filling meal following my husband's dental surgery (he must eat soft foods).  Wonderful, comforting, interesting rich flavor; my husband loved it.  Like others, I used canned sweet potatoes, canned tomatoes and crunchy peanut butter.  The fresh chopped cilantro really set off the flavor.  Will definitely make again!

Excellent recipe!!  I added a little extra cayenne pepper because I like it spicy, but other than that it was perfect.

This smells amazing while it is cooking ... However, I was very disappointed when I "tried" eating it.  I was not particularly fond of the "raw peanut" taste  ... maybe I should have used the unsalted dry-roasted peanuts as a garnish instead of actually putting them in the soup.  I followed this recipe exactly as written and had high hopes considering the reviews I read.  I love the idea of this soup ... but I do not think I will be making this again.  Sorry  :(

This was really tasty and addictive.  Like many others, I also doubled the peanut butter and used crunchy.  For anyone who thinks they don't need the cilantro, it really adds another dimension to the flavors of this soup.  Don't skip out on it!

I would double the cayenne, but my husband liked it as is.  To me the flavor in general seemed a bit weak, although it smelled nice.  Perhaps best if served alongside a red pepper flake shaker, so that each may adjust the heat.

I saved this interesting recipe a few years ago but never made until a few days ago. Made it a day ahead to let the flavors meld and served it to my quilting mini-group for lunch -- without telling them the ingredients. It as a monster hit! Don't forget the fresh chopped cilantro sprinkled on top: it makes the dish.

I REALLY liked this soup! I ate it almost everyday for a week! The combination of sweet potato and peanut is delicious. It was soooo "creamy" but it has no dairy in it! I will make this again.

Delicious! I added an extra Tbsp of peanut butter (or two) and substituted one cup of chicken broth for one of the cups of water. I also added about a Tbsp of honey to bring out the flavors.

This is quite different from anything I've had before. It tasted pretty good but it made my husband's stomach hurt every time he ate it. Considering that, it isn't good enough that I will make it again.

I don't know what all the fuss is about with this dish. Just like a few other people said my husband and I found it bland, bland, BLAND. I used chicken stock in place of water, tried adding extra peanut butter and cayenne pepper. Nothing helped. We didn't care for it.

This soup is wonderful if you wait a day before having so the flavors have some time to come together. I make over the weekend and have for lunch at work and it saves wonderfully.

I work at a farmer's market and was given some extra sweet potatoes to go home with.  This soup was so simple - I had all I needed already at the house.  Chicken stock instead of water is a must and canned tomatoes work fine.  I didn't have fresh peanuts at the house, but the soup was fantastic with the mild peanut taste from just the peanut butter - I probably used about a tablespoon or more extra.  This soup tastes good with heat. I was out of cayenne and substituted a carrot-based hot sauce (would not used vinegar based tobasco type) this worked so good I'm taking out cayenne altogether and sticking with the sweet hot sauce.  My guy's mother is a fabulous cook - but she also chronically adds salt, cream, pepper, or whatever else is around to EVERYTHING I cook.  This soup - however - made her rave.  Yes!  One big point for me.

We honestly didn't care for this at all.  I am giving 3 stars only because I'm hoping it's just that we're not familiar with the flavor combination... and it looks gorgeous.

Rich, earthy balance of flavors between savory and sweet. Huge hit at a dinner party! Easy to make, and as with so many good soups, even better the next day ... A winner, for sure. Can't wait to make it again!

Its very good. Don't skip the cilantro. I put diced pickles jalapenos in it and it was even better for those of you who like things spicy.

I made this last night. Very good - although I ended up adding more of the listed spices as it was initially bland -also I plan on making w/ vegetable broth next to make it more savory.

This soup was very thick and rich. It smelled very good while cooking, my husband thought I was making Indian muligatawny soup.  It didn't taste bad, but was so filling that I could barely eat half a bowl.  I will not make again.

LOVE this. It's part of my regular rotation of recipes -- I make it for company (it always makes an impression!), or I make a ton of it and pack the left-overs for school or work lunches. It's even better reheated! I don't make any changes except substituting a generous amount of garam masala for the cumin - cloves. It's a comparable mix of spices with a little something extra.

Yum! I trimmed this down to serve 2. I doubled the peanut butter and added more cumin and coriander. I used Kraft natural peanut butter, which has a wonderfully strong peanuty taste. The soup was fantastic! Peanut-y and rich, with a delicious, complex flavour. Wonderful! Both of us really enjoyed it & I will certainly make it again.

Great soup!  1.  Changed water to chicken broth and used only 2 cups. 2.  Used a can of tomatoes instead of fresh (that's life). 3. Used about 4 tbls of crunchy peanut butter and cut out peanuts. 4. Added more cayenne; it needed a little kick.  YUM!  Healthful too!

EXCELLENT!  I used 2 pounds of sweet potato, subbed vegetable broth for the water, simmered uncovered, used 6 TBSP peanut butter (put it right in there in the food processor while I pureed the soup) and used a half TSP of cayenne - we like it spicy!  I'll make this again and again.

Lovely Flavour! i used some cilantro in the soup when cooking as well as when it was served. I would have used 200ml extra water, because i found it a little thick.

This soup was a lot of work and the end result was nothing that my husband would even touch because of the smell.  I followed the directions completely and can see where it would be easier to use canned sweet potatoes and tomatoes...but I had fresh so I used them up.  I thought it was okay, not something I would make or order again if I had it in a restaurant.  Even though I love all of the ingredients seperately they just didn't mesh well for me.

Yummy! I loved everything about this soup! It was easy and tasted even better the next day, (most soups do, I think). Adding some fresh cilantro over the top before saving really brought it all together. My hubby didn't love this recipe, he said it was a "texture thing" but I will definitely be making this again for myself in the future! Thank you!

Fantastic. Only alterations were that I mashed the soup instead of making it a puree, as others have suggested. I also replaced the cumin and coriander with chili powder which gave it great flavor and a bit of a kick. This recipe is a keeper, and is inexpensive to make too!

This soup is great, a little too sweet for me. Not sure what the sweetness is coming from but will try to reduce the peanut butter to see if it makes a difference.

this soup was amazing. the slight touch of peanut butter paired with the rich, creamy flavor of the tubers, followed by the bite of cayenne... was overwhelmingly wonderful. i made a few changes though... i used half sweet potatoes, half yams, then threw in some leftover butternut squash i had. i most definitely used FRESH tomatoes. i also used about 3/5 of water from veggie broth. i served it over millet for myself, while my boyfriend ate it with sourdough bread. we both loved it. besides the pain of food processing hte soup, it was all very easy to assemble and had an authentic taste. i will use this forever more!

I love this recipe. Its easy and can be made in a flash. I tend to use canned tomatoes and sometimes canned sweet potatoes if I dont have fresh on hand. I skip the blending stage and instead of using smooth peanut butter and roasted peanuts I kill two birds with one stone and use natural crunchy peanut butter. Cilantro IS a wonderful compliment to the soup but not necesssary.

I used the veggie broth instead of water and added 2 extra cloves of garlic. The soup was exceptional. It had a subtle, yet exotic flavor that reminded me of Indian food.  Worth the work.

This is truly one of those warm happy soups -- especially if you like peanuts (which I do!).  I've made it three times and gotten rave reviews each time.  As one reviewer suggested, I used 4.5 cups vegetable stock (bouillion cubes work well, too) instead of water.  I've also replaced the sweet potatoes with yams and had similarly pleasant results, and since I don't have a blender, I've always served it with the veggies whole.  It's lovely with basmati rice or brown bread, and the cilantro garnish isn't necessary unless you're serving it to guests. It's definitely become one of my favorite meals - well worth the hour or so of preparation. Yum!

Oh god, I love this recipe.  I wouldn't change a thing.  It doesn't need the cilantro if you don't want it, cause it has plenty of flavor on it's own.  Just make sure you spice it to taste.  Mmmmmm.

My husband, who is a native Moroccan, really enjoyed this soup.  I found it to be quite "different" and sweet potatoes out of the context of "sweet" was new for me.  I most enjoyed dipping bread in it. ;)

One of my favourites.  I love this soup.  Used a can of diced tomates and lots and lots of ginger and garlic.  I'm not stingy with the spices.  Everyone loved this soup.  I make it all the time and freeze it.

This was fantastic! It came out thick enough to make a hearty soup but not too heavy to eat as one (I've seen many peanut "soup" recipes that would be better served as a sauce). I made this with vegetable broth instead of water, without the cayenne (spicy is not popular in our house), and with 3 tbsp. of peanut butter and it was absolutely perfect - the cilantro on top is a must to accentuate and complement the flavors.

This soup is marvelous. When it came time to puree it, I ran into some problems - my food processor wouldn't turn on, our blender started to smoke when I plugged it in, and I ended up *trying* to use a hand held mixer. I got most of the sweet potatos pureed, but there were some carrot and mushroom (I added them because I love them) chunks still. I don't recommend using this method - it got pretty messy. However, this did not affect the taste in anyway. I took some advice and used the reduced-fat super chunky peanut butter, and added a lot more spices than the recipe calls for. It tastes great.

I was slightly disappointed at first, but like others have commented, the soup definitely improves overnight, and I was quite happy with it the next day.  I used slightly more chunky peanut butter than called for and omitted the chopped peanuts.

Turned out very rich--we ended up using it as a dip for bread as opposed to a straight soup.  With a little more heat, it would be delicious over noodles.  Great flavor.

Absolutely delicious.  I love this soup and have made it many, many times.

Changes I made:

1) Use only 1 tsp on very, very finely minced fresh ginger

2) I add ground chili peppers along with the cayenne

3) I don't use the ground peanuts (don't care for the texture)

4) I don't bother with the cilantro - it has so much flavor as it is

SOUL SATISFYING! Especially in the winter.
This is the recipe that has made me register with this site.
I didn't have coriander by itself, so I substituted that, the cinnamon and cumin with a pre-mixed CURRY spice powder.
Worked fine. Also, if you like your soup with a lot of chunks in it....just blend about 3 cups of it. I'M DROOLING NOW.

I'm SSOOO dissapointed with this recipe. It smelled heavenly while is was cooking - the aromas from the spices were incredible. Unfortunatly, the smells didn't translate to the taste, and now I'm left with a big pot of soup that I'm no too excited to have to eat.

This was good.  I cut down the liquid by about half based on other reviewers recommendations, then replaced half of that with heavy cream to make it thicker.  I also cooked it for a good while to soften up the potato chunks.   Finally, I added rice to it and cooked until the rice was done, which helped offset the grainy texture.  It doesn't look too appetizing on its own (kind of looks like baby food) but in a nice bowl with Garnish it's nice.  If you reduce the liquid even more you could probably also serve it as a tasty version of mashed sweet potatos.

I made this recipe almost exactly as is, with the addition of one red bell pepper, 1/2 tsp of salt and an extra tablespoon of peanut butter.  This smelled wonderful and maybe with some tweaking could taste that way too, but as is it is way too watery.  Next time I will use only 2 cups of liquid and I will use chicken broth, and more cumin because I love that stuff.

Unfortunately, I have to throw this batch away... hence the 3 stars.

Great recipe!  I used fresh jalapeno and chile peppers in place of the dried cayenne--very spicy!  I pureed only half of the recipe and left the rest chunky.  I also added 1 can of pureed garbanzo beans for extra protein.  Because I added pureed garbanzo beans, I added extra fat-free chicken broth to thin it out.

Made this for a rainy day lunch.  Delicious.  I made two small changes to the recipe.  First, I didn't add any cloves, and secondly I used natural crunchy peanut butter rather than bothering with chopping nuts.  A very good mix of flavors.  I wouldn't mind adding a little more cheyenne pepper, but I wasn't missing anything just the way it was.  Certainly recommended.

interesting flavor....I had to double up on the red pepper though.  I could smell the peanut bytter, but couldn't taste it.  The cilantro is a nice touch!  ...my dinner party loved it...left out the peanuts (actually forgot them)..added more peanut butter and red pepper...just used two large sweet potatoes

This soup is FANTASTIC. I don't usually use cilantro when it's called for in recipes, but it was the perfect compliment to this soup. We had some of the leftover soup two nights later and it was even better. Thank you for sharing, we'll be having this one often!

While it was cooking, I thought it was going to be really good. With all the spices, sweet potatoes, and tomatoes, I was really excited to try it. The smell helped too. I served it with home-made flatbread, and that was a good thing, because without the bread, I don't think we would have eaten a lot of it. Words used to describe this, were not the best: "Bland", "Glop", and even, "It's like baby food". I thought it was okay, but next time I make it, I'm going to change a lot.

Excellent! Made the recipe just as is and served with a brown/wild rice combination.  Very filling, very good.  I was a little heavy-handed with the red pepper so I'll tone that down a little and bring up the cinnamon/spice notes more, but on the whole, healthy and good!

More like 3.5.  I made it as directed, replacing the water with half chicken broth and half veggie broth.  It was birding, so I doubled the peanut butter and kicked up the spice.  Still enh..but once I added the cilantro?  Wow!  The cilantro really makes the soup.  My husband talked about "next time you make this," so I guess I will be making this again.  Paired it with Asian glazed carrots, also from this site.  A good match.

Delicious ! an unusual wedding of hearty tastes on your palast ! It will defnitively be a treat again for some cold evenings or spicy lunches. The orange/green/red colours in the pan were looking so joyful that I serve this soup without blending it... A great success indeed ! thank you very much.

My husband was crazy about this soup. I never thought of combining PB with sweet potatoes. A definite keeper.

The is outstanding if someone likes a bit of different flavors and peanuts.  Some of family loved it but some did not.  It is easy and flavorful but not for everyone.

This is a great base recipe.  I do make a few changes when I make it.  I dice the carrot fine and sautee it with the onion and garlic.  I also use garam masala and a little vindaloo seasoning instead of all the individual spices.  I use 1 large (29oz) can of sweet potatoes and sometimes 1 smaller can (I think 15oz) if I want to make a large batch.  I add a little chicken soup seasoning to the water (or chicken broth of I have some on hand.)  I 1 small can of tomato sauce instead of the tomatoes as my husband and I are not huge fans of tomatoes.  Also a little brown sugar to cut the acidity of the tomatoes.  I don't bother blending it in a food processor, just chunk it of with the back of a wooden spoon or a potato masher.  It's pretty quick and easy, doesn't take long at all to put together when done this way.

Yummy! Love mix of all my favorite things - cumin, cilantro, peanut butter, garlic, ginger, what more could you ask for? Have to admit I didn't blend mine cos I don't have a blender! and I'm sure its a whole different experience blended but its very very good - lovely mix of flavours :) :) :) Thank you!

Absolutely amazing! I used vegetable broth instead of water the 2nd time I made it and I think it makes a huge difference. My BF said it's the best soup he's ever had!

My husband and I enjoyed this, though my daughter didn't care for it.  The soup is rich and exotic, very filling. I doubled the amount of peanut butter and left out the cilantro because I don't like it. Garnished with a wedge of lime instead.  I also used canned tomatoes, Rotel...since I didn't have fresh. Great stuff!

Pretty good soup, I liked the blended airy texture. Not quite as good as the other African peanut soup recipe on this site though, in my opinion. Still good though. I garnished mine with freeze dried cilantro and served it with whole wheat bread.

This was absolutely delicious. I'm not a measuring cook, so I really seasoned this as I saw fit. It was very flavorful and exactly as I had remembered it from a restaurant where I first tasted it. The only thing that could have made mine better was ground coriander as the recipe called for. I only had whole, and had to crush it between a napkin with the side of my chef's blade. Also, this dish can be fantastic without peanuts. I made a separate dish for my daughter who is allergic to nuts, and she had seconds. My hubby, other daughter and I all thought it entirely a meal unto itself. No one asked for anything else with it!

Overall I liked this soup, but was expecting it to have more flavor. The only substitution that I did were canned whole tomatoes instead of the fresh ones. I felt that nuts didn't add anything to the taste, but didn't like the gritty texture, so I'll probably just skip them. Also I added only 1 tbsp of peanut butter after tasting the soup.

I really wanted to like this, but I thought it was bland or something was missing. Probably used have used others suggestions to improve, but unfortunately,  it was too much time and effort to try this one again.

This was one of those recipes that I really wanted to like but just didn't. After following the recipe I thought it was bland, and it still was even after I dumped in more spices at the end. Also, I didn't like the gritty texture from the peanuts and it was a chore to finish off the leftovers.  This soup has potential, but next time I'd try a recipe with more spices and more peanut butter.

This was fantastic! We used crunchy peanut butter and lightly salted crushed peanuts(plastic bag and hammer). We did add a little extra hots with crushed red pepper at the very beginning and extra  cayenne pepper. We also used chicken stock   instead of plain water. Next time we are going to shred the cilantro and add into the soup as well use it for presentation.

If I had the option I would have given this 3.5 stars.  It was ok but not fabulous. It seemed to be missing something but I'm not quite sure what. It was almost like the spices didn't quite come through.  The cayenne at the end helped a lot but I'm not sure I will make this again.  I think I will just continue to search for a better sweet potato soup recipe.

This recipe was ok.  It was easy to make and not bad.  But it also wasn't great.  Just unimpressive.  I think I expected it to be a little spicier and I even added more cayenne than the recipe said.

This just tastes weird to me. I don't like the peanut butter taste in the soup. It over powers everything. It needs to be spicier or something. It is too rich. I am not sure. Wish I would have made another type of soup. Yuck....

I used 1 can of diced tomatoes in place of the fresh, and adjusted the spices to taste.  I used natural peanut butter, and I think if you are looking for "sweet", you should used regular.  I reserved some of the peanuts to use as topping, which added a nice crunch.  The cilantro really made a difference in the over flavor of the soup.  I would make this again.

Great recipe.  Each ingredient added to the overall flavor which was delicate and complex. :o) I would note that the veggies may take more than 30 minutes to cook completely.  Also, I made some small changes: left out ginger, used 1 can diced tomates in place of fresh, and used veggie broth instead of water.  Really a nice meal.

I used a mix of chicken soup and water as the base and it brought out the flavor of the potatoes and peanuts.  A previous reviewer mentioned vegetable stock as a base and that also seems as though it would work and make the vegetarians among you happy.  Our family likes things rather spicy, and with additional cayenne it tasted a bit as though it were flavored by sate sauce.  Another earlier reviewer mentioned that it was too much to eat a lot of.  I plan to use this in cups, rather than bowls, for the first course of our Thanksgiving meal this year.  Since the soup is very filling the cups don't have to be very full -- just garnished nicely.

I thought this recipe was fun to try, but I probably wouldn't make it again.  It had a good flavor, but I could only eat so much before I got sick of it.  Instead of putting it in a blender, I used my hand mixer right in the pot I was cooking in.  This worked really well and was much easier than transfering to a blender.

Awful.  Just awful.  I'm a sweet potato FANATIC, I love them in any form, so I was really excited about this recipe... but I was not happy with this soup at all.  It wasn't smooth enough, even though I pureed it, and I just wasn't thrilled about the taste.  It was more like a sauce than a soup.

This recipe was kind of a let down. Everything about it indicates that I should have loved it, but I was disapointed --all those great flavors and they just kind of got muddied up and fell flat. Doubly disappointing because I spent significant time on it. Perhaps should have tried diluting it more--. Or maybe I should have used commercial peanut butter instead of the "natural" (just peanuts and a little salt)kind? Oh well win some lose some.

Oh my!  I had a similar soup from an organic restaurant  and found this one online. 

Honestly this is better than the restaurant version!!   What I did.  
I always have baked sweet potatoes on hand...so I used 2 medium - shredded one carrot, used 3 tsp ofGaram Masala instead of the individ spices (garlic and onion same as recipe) and 2 tsp of ginger powder (no fresh on hand)  I used 1 can (2cups) chix broth and 1 cup water (or else would have been too watery) I also used 1 can of diced tomatoes with juice and 3 tbsp of peanut butter (no regular peanuts)- not a fan of cilantro so didn't miss it...but wow...what a yummy soup...I put half in freezer so I don't eat it all! :)

Great taste!  Didn't go over well with the picky meat-and-potato son, but everyone else loved it.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh, which worked out fine.

This was delicious. I had several sweet potatoes leftover from Thanksgiving dinner so I doubled the recipe (which I would recommend since it's so inexpensive and easy to freeze).
I used my favourite veggie broth in place of water & used 1.5 x the amount of spices (based on doubling the recipe). My kids loved it!
Oh, & I used crunchy PB in place of the peanuts & approx 1 extra tablespoon.
I did not double the cayenne because if the children however, I just added more to mine upon serving. 
So good!

I really enjoyed this soup.  I do think it could use less peanut butter and the dry roasted peanuts would be better as a garnish.  I also added more salt and pepper to suit my taste after dishing it up into bowls.  Very nice and filling.

This soup is amazing! I make it for our Farmer's Market and it always sells out quickly. I have to make it often because people come back asking for more. I add more of everything including potato's and spices but even if you follow the recipe to a 't' it's going to be delish!!!

This soup was interesting! I don't even know how to describe it. It kind of reminded me of a blend of peanut soup that was mixed with an Indian flavored soup. I was looking for a pureed soup to make in my Vitamix blender today, for lunch, and decided to give this one a try. I had sweet potatoes I already roasted in the fridge. I made 1/2 recipe. The only other change I made was using 1 can of diced tomatoes for the whole tomatoes and 1/2 the amount of ginger as I just find the flavor dominant in recipes. I still would have preferred to of reduce the ginger even further. The soup was creamy and thick. I sauteed the onion in the olive oil in a small pot on the stove until soft and then stirred in the garlic for about 30 seconds. I added it and everything else to the Vitamix machine and cooked on high for 9 minutes. 1/2 recipe yielded about 6 servings. It was fine with cilantro, but I honestly just liked it with a sprinkle of salt and pepper on top.

My husband loved it! He said  make it again and he's not a soup fan. I did alter this a bit based on what I had in the house (I used homemade vegetable broth and some water). I left it thick as he likes a more stew like soup.  I used ginger and cinnamon and only a little bit of cumin. A nice recipe.

I will agree with what others have said: this was bland despite all the spices and textures that went into it. I tried heightening it with a bit of curry powder and some sriracha, but I suspect it needs a lot more peanut butter and just some different ingredients. I liked it better than my family liked it, but unfortunately I think we will find another recipe for the purpose next time around.

Flavor was good but the texture was all wrong (not really creamy, but not chunky and not broth/watery). Next time, I don't think I'll blend it and I'll use more  (crunchy) peanut butter as others have suggested.

Delicious!! Made it exactly as said, but after I puréed everything I put it back into the saucepan and added a quarter cup of chopped peanuts and two cans of chic peas.  Yum!!!!  I like something to chew on-so that’s why I did it that way. If you like a creamy soup, make it as stated.

Delicious. Skipped the peanut butter and just filled the quarter cup of peanuts to heaping. (Didn’t see the point of messing with peanut butter sticking to the spoon when it is just blended peanuts anyway.)

For some reason I didn't clue in that basically I just have to heat all the ingredients and blend, so it ended up taking forever to make and wasn't very good all on it's own. Needs bread or something to make it feel more like a meal and less like healthy peanut gruel (not an insult, I like gruels). It was quite delicious, but I doubt I'll make it this way again - now that I know the basics I'll elaborate the hell out of it next time.

Amazingly delicious and amazingly healthy! I am making this soup for the second time in just two days, it's that good. I found the spice level perfect. I omitted the peanuts but used chunky, natural peanut butter which I think achieves a similar crunch factor. Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe!

I made this delicious soup as written except I added extra garlic and used broth instead of water. I agree that the cilantro on top of the bowl of soup is key. Will defiantly make again.

Oh my gosh this is delicious!  I am eating a soft diet so purred it smooth.  I baked 2 sweet potatoes and added then after cooking the onions etc.  I cut down the water to 3 cups and used a cup of homemade tomato sauce in place of the tomatoes.   Didn't have a carrot so I skipped it.  I accidentally used 1 1/2 tsp  cinnamon and thought it would be ruined,  But still fantastic.  I can't wait to make it again.  I can't imagine how good it will be if I get it right!

Well, I can't really give a proper review because I misread the amount of peanuts and put a full cup in. (Apologies to my family) It's an interesting recipe and I love peanut soups, but by the time I realized my error, the temptation to throw some grape juice in it and call it peanut butter & jelly soup. I failed.

My husband likes this! And so do I. I wanted to try a recipe that is totally healthy and is full of vegetables. I was hoping all the spices would make the sweet potatoes taste a little bit like pie, so that my husband would eat it. I suspect the reason this soup *did* taste a little bit sweet, like pie, is that I forgot to add both the peanut butter and cayenne pepper. I did increase the dry roasted peanuts to about 3/8 cup and I chopped them in the blender before blending in the soup. Because the soup has quiet flavors, the cilantro is a very nice and important contrast, and I definitely wouldn't serve it without the cilantro.

This soup is delicious.  I used a creamy peanut butter that does not have any sugar in it.  I will make it again, and again!

This soup is so what I needed after this weekend. It made my heart happy. Pretty simple to make. And only sub I used was extra tomatoes and more cayenne pepper for a kick

I doubled the peanut butter since I didn't have actual peanut butter, and added a bit of ginger and a teaspoon of honey.  1 medium-large sweet potato was enough. Delicious!

Oh my gosh! The depth of flavor! And the layers of flavor are amazing! Is going down as one of top three all time soups! And since I'm both gluten and dairy intolerant this soup is unbelievable.  It rich and creamy without the added calorie (or bloating) from dairy. Whomever concocted this is genius. For an added variation on day 2 of leftovers, I added smoked goat cheese (since I can have milk from every OTHER animal except a cow LOL).

This meal was a big hit...served over brown rice.  Added a can of beans to make the protein go a little farther.  Will try not pureeing next time and keep it chunky more like a stew.
Very good! and will make again.

pretty good for the most part. the taste is a little bit strange but you grow to like it after a few bites. i sauteed all the vegetables on coconut oil and added in spices i liked such as paprika and lemon pepper. i also threw in a few mushrooms. i had no sweet potatoes so i substituted russet potatoes and about a teaspoon and a half of brown sugar. also, i made the decision to use chicken broth instead of the recommended water. it would have made the flavor bland as the soup's flavor was already subtle.

I absolutely love this recipe. It's a very hardy soup with a lot of flavor. I think once you've made it for the first time to make it again is pretty quick.

Interesting concept.  Note that in my version I omitted the peanut for cashews and the peanut butter for more cashews.  I did not add salt, but rather added sea salt roasted cashews.  Still needed salt.  The texture is weird, the water called for is too much (and in my version I had about 20% more sweet potato and tomato than called for, but kept the water cited).  This dish is rich, but lacking in something I can't quite figure out what.  Cilantro is a must.  Without cilantro, the taste is flat and earthy.  Cilantro compliments and enhances it well.  I think next time I will try it with vegetable broth over plain water.  I think that is the missing dimension here.
