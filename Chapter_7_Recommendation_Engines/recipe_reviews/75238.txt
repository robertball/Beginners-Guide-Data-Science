I used apricot filling and vodka instead of the peach preserve and tequila on a pork tenderloin. Grilled it on the Weber and boy, was it ever delicious! Will definitely make this again.

Made this with pork tenderloin and it was yummy!  Marinated for a few hours (could have been a little longer) but the boiled sauce on top is what really makes the flavor.  I would be curious to try this with chicken as well, but it was great with pork tenderloin.

Did this tonight for dinner.  Used pork chops.  They were fantastic.  We grilled them after they sat in the marinade (in a baggie in the fridge)for about four hours.  Served them with the reserved sauce and it really was delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe.

i used this on drumsticks and it tasted like a very mellow teriyaki chicken.. it almost feels like it needs some brown sugar.. i subbed marmalade for the peach preserves.. and added about a tsp of kosher salt but i felt like it could have used more.. it was okay but i see myself dipping this into some store bought teriyaki sauce

We liked it, but it's a little sweet. Next time I'd add some soy sauce to make it more savory and cut down on the OJ.

Here (my photo) is a plateful of chicken thighs marinated in this sauce of yours!  We are having a wonderful dinner with this tonight!  It just needed a little salt and we were good to go!  Thank you!
