This was a pretty good recipe, needs some tweaking though. I substituted red pepper flakes for the cayenne pepper to really jazz it up. I also cut way back on the brown sugar. I just added it in small parts until it tasted right. I probably ended up with about 1/2 Cup for a 3 lbs filet. Also, anytime we are grilling salmon filets we put it on aluminum foil, it makes clean up so much easier!

I basted the salmon 3 times while broiling.  I used greased foil for broiling.  The sauce I heated for 10 minutes with a gentle bubbling just to thicken it a bit.  I poured it over the finished salmon and a vegetable medley of broccoli, cauliflower and carrot (parisienne style).  This whole dish tasted amazing with the butter/dill sauce.  I didn't change any of the sauce proportions.  The only thing I would have changed is shortening the broiling time.  Next time I am going to try this sauce on a poached salmon, so stay tuned!

This was a good recipe, but a little too sweet. Could probably use a touch more lemon. I scaled the recipe back to serve 2 and it still called for over a 1/4 cup sugar. Next time I will use less. Also, the scaled back recipe called for over a 1/4 cup dill, which was just too much. I only used half that amount and that was perfect. I really liked the addition of the cayenne!

We eat salmon a lot and this recipe was simply delicious!  Followed the recipe except I scaled it down for two, used 1/2 cup brown sugar and two Tbls. dried dill weed, 3 tbls. butter, 2 tbls. lemon juice, 1/4 tsp. red pepper.  We don't like it to spicy, hot.  Did use the lemon-pepper on the salmon as recipe stated.  Made this for the first time tonight and will definitely make again.  My husband loved it.

The recipe was good, however I was expecting a bit more.  I did cut the sauce in half based on other reviews and the size of the fillet.  Also I reduced the dill weed to 1/8 cup and cayenne pepper to taste.  As for the method, I heated the first five ingredients in a saucepan, then removed enough for basting.  This in my opinion is much easier than the original directions.

I'm always trying to cook salmon last minute, when there's no time to marinate.  This recipe gives the salmon a marinated taste and takes almost no prep time.  Easy to cook, delicious.  A nice little kick from the pepper.  Really enjoyed the recipe.  Thanks!

We were in Alaska this summer and my husband went salmon fishing.  Yesterday we tried the Glazed Salmon sause.  It was great. It tasted very close to what we had in Alaska. One thing I did only added one Tablespoon of dill weed.  I thought 1 cup was too much.

This was FANTASTIC.  I definitely didn't need all the sauce-will 1/2 the recipe next time.  I broiled for 10 minutes, basting about every 3 minutes.  My husband always groans every time I say we're having salmon, but he LOVED this.

I used a lot less brown sugar, following another review. But the sauce was a great way to use up extra dill.

The sauce was delicious!.. Sweet and spicy so a little goes a long way!..  This was definately restaurant quality imo.  I soaked cedar planks to BBQ my salmon on the grill and then realized I was out of charcoal and ended up doing them under the broiler for about 10 minutes adding the marinade once after 5 minutes!.. It was perfect but I can't wait to do them n the grill next time.  My sauce was a little grainy; I must not have simmered it long enough but still good!.. Thanks!

This recipe was very delightful. I tweaked it a little based on what I had available at my house; for instance, I didn't have lemon juice so I used fresh squeezed tangerines and I didn't include the dill weed and lemon pepper because I did not have these readily available. Despite those minor changes, I followed the recipe and discover a very savory salmon dish. This recipe is definitely worth your time trying, so enjoy!

My husband loved this! I also made it for two, and scaled down the sugar and the dill to 1/8 cups. Will definitely make again.
