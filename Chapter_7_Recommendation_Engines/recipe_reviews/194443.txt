My daughter, a new cook, decided to make this for a get together tonight.  I stood by and assisted only when asked!! This is a great wrap idea, but the amount of mustand/cranberry sauce was enough for 10x the amount of wraps being made. I think the mustard to cranberry ratio is off as well.  She had to add more cranberry and brown sugar or it wouldn't have been edible. Two slices of cheese seemed to work better than one. The combinations of turkey and cranberry work well and make a nice wrap. She was happy to have made something from scratch rather than resorting to a store bought contribution to the pot luck.

This is my new favorite recipe!!! I reduced the amount of mustard and added a tiny bit of honey to make the sauce. Other than that, I just added some spinach, tomatoes and red onion. Perfect!! I'm going to start using cranberry mustard in place of mayo on sandwiches.
