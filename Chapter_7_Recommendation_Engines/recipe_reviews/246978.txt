Rating it for my daughters who absolutely loved this yummy float. It's tasty, sweet, and pretty. Adjust the sweetness and taste by adding more or less grenadine. 

I added scoops of ice cream to a small cup, mixed the 7-up and grenadine in a different cup, then poured it slowly over the ice cream. Adding whipped cream and a cherry make it even more special. Thank you for sharing this delightful treat.

This is a great summer treat and so different than a normal ice cream float!   The cherry flavor from the grenadine worked so well with the vanilla ice cream.  I made with two scoops of ice cream, but, otherwise made exactly as the recipe stated.
