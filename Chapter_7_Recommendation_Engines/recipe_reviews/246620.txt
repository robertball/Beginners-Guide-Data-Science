There were a lot of steps to this but it turned out great. I made as written except that I used shredded parm instead of shaved. I did end up adding more red pepper because we like it spicy. The one suggestion I have is to add a fresh herb as garnish. I used parsley because that is what I had on hand but basil would have been nice too. Great recipe and one that is sure to impress!

The recipe was great.  I, however, didn't season it enough.  This was my first time making zoodles.  The manual zoodle maker that I have is for the birds!  I need to find something better to use.  Maybe if I attached it to a drill or something.  :)  Thanks for the recipe.  I will be making this again.
