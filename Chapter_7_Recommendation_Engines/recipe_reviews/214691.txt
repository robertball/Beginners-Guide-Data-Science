This is my recipe and there is a mistake in the instructions. When I submitted it for kitchen approval, the instructions in step 3 said to melt 1 1/2 sticks of butter (3/4 C) and they changed it to 1 1/2 cups - yikes! That's DOUBLE what I use for the sauce. I don't know who to contact to correct the mistake they made when they changed my instructions.

Had to cut back on portions because this definitely makes enough for a crowd.  Tastes the way macaroni and cheese should taste - creamy, tangy and just the right consistency.   Thanks.......

WOW. This recipe is wonderfully rich and delicious! I halfed it and it worked perfectly in our small oval casserole dish.  We will definitely be making this one again!

This is rich but pretty tasty.  It definitely benefits from caramelizing the onions in the butter.  Not having any croutons on hand, I used crushed saltines with butter for the topping.  I reduced the recipe by half and, depending on the number of servings I need next time, I may even reduce it to a quarter, although the leftovers seemed to taste even better;  heated in the microwave and then run under the  boiler to crisp the topping.  I'll add this to my rotation of mac and cheese recipes.

I'm sorry but it did not wow me.  I halfed the recipe(per the calculator), maybe that's why- but waay too creamy cheesy curdy for me.  I am looking for what Grandma used to make with chewy buttery mac with cheesy cheddary chunks.  It is as others described very rich compared to boxed mac n cheese.  Not our bag of tea.

UPDATE- If you pour Tomato Bisque over it.  It tastes like a grown up version of Spaghetto-O's.  I was a big fan as a child and we didn't have to throw out leftovers.

This is the first mac and cheese I have ever made!  It calls for a lot of ingredients and is not very cheap to make....It had great flavor and the consistency was great!  The next time I make it though, I will use all sharp cheddar and omit the Colby Jack.  I think the sharp cheddar will give it more of a "kick"!  Definitely worth keeping in my recipe box!

I'm Julie's aunt and I agree this is the best Mac and Cheese our family has ever tasted.  It's a requirement for dinners we all enjoy.

I cut this recipe down to eight servings. It may look like I butchered this recipe but I did my best to make something my family loves while using less calorie-laden ingredients. I did not add the salt called for. I added in four cloves of fresh minced garlic when I sauteed the onion. I used whole wheat elbow macaroni, fat free evaporated milk, 2% shredded sharp cheddar and fat free cottage cheese. I did cut the recipe in half but I kept the shredded cheeses at the same amounts. I made my own croutons out of four small pieces of day old wheat bread and only a couple tablespoons of butter with garlic and onion powder stirred in before I spread it over the bread and "toasted" it in the oven to make croutons. I didn't use the whole amount of "croutons", I just crumbled it over the top until there was a slight dusting over the whole baking dish full. My family liked this but they'll eat almost any macaroni and cheese. This is a really rich-tasting macaroni and cheese, even using lighter ingredients. Using the processed cheese gave it a nice.....extra creamy mouth feel. NOTE: I would not recommend adding the full amount of flour. I thought that I might have an issue with it coming out too dry if I didn't cut back and I'm glad I did. Three tablespoons is plenty.

This recipe tasted just okay for me. I have made it twice and each time it has made way too much sauce for one package of macaroni. I used only about half of the sauce each time because it makes so much. The flavor is just okay and I agree with other reviews that it is very very rich.

Smelled heavenly but it was too sharp for my taste.  Also I prefer a creamier Mac & Cheese.  Mine was a little dry. Makes a LOT.

Nice change for a macaroni dish. Interesting flavor. Next will omit the onion and use the sharp cheddar.

I made this for  my sons varsity football team dinner and naturally I made a small tray for home, this recipe is SO good ! Not only did my family and I love it ,  but the team ate the WHOLE-tray  that I delivered. I made one change using  Monterrey Jack cheese and horse radish cheddar instead of the Colby jack , the cottage cheese is a brilliant ingredient as it made it SO creamy and delicious. I'm definitely making it again.

I enjoyed this despite the fact that I'm philosophically opposed to cooking with Velveeta;) My husband bought a giant brick for another purpose and I happened upon this recipe looking for a way to use the rest. There were a few ingredients I didn't have on hand...cottage cheese, croutons, and the correct amount of evaporated milk. I omitted the croutons and cottage cheese and used the one can of evap milk I had.  I added 2% milk in place of the remaining evaporated, and it thickened beautifully.

As other reviews have said, this is extremely rich and 'saucy'. It probably won't be in regular rotation for those reasons, but I could imagine making this again for a special occasion as the submitter does.  Since I don't want to buy Velveeta again and I don't know that it adds anything significant to the taste or texture, I think experimenting with other favorite cheeses would keep this one interesting. 

Thanks for sharing the recipe, the family liked it!
