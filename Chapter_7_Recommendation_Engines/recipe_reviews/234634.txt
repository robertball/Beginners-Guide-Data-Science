This turned out pretty well!  It was definitely savory, but very different from a "standard" sauce.  Worth trying if you want to do something different.  Maybe not "comfort food" enough to make it into a regular schedule for meals but will probably make it from time to time.

This dish was so perfect for fall!  The only change I made was reducing the cinnamon to 1 tsp but that’s just personal preference. I also omitted the pine nuts which i thought weren’t necessary. Great dish for the whole family and versatile for any pasta!
