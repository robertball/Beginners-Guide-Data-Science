I made this cake one time as written, and of course it was great - it was nothing but fat and fruit! WOW! So, knowing how many calories I could save, I made some modifications, and this is now one of my most-requested recipes. My modifications: Instead of 3 cups all-purpose flour, I use 1 cup whole wheat flour and 2 cups AP. I use 1.5 cups white sugar instead of the full 2 cups. 
I use 1 1/4 cups unsweetened applesauce in place of ALL of the oil. I use 3/4 cup of eggbeaters in place of the eggs. I increase the chopped apples to 4 cups. I omit the nuts. I make the topping as written, but serve it as a sauce on the side rather than dumping it on top. That seems like a lot of changes, but it's really a fabulous cake that CAN BE less awful for you!! :-)

I like spice in my apple cake so I added a heaping tablespoon of cinnamon. I used tart green Granny Smith apples. Make sure to mix the flour and the oil mixture well before adding apples and nuts. That should stop the problem of "crumbling" that some people are experiencing. I baked this in a 9X13 stoneware baking pan. It came out moist and stayed that way for days. I used dark brown sugar in the topping and added 1/8 tsp of salt in the glaze to make the tongue more receptive to all the flavors (a baker's trick). Be prepared to have trouble putting the fork down!! This is habit forming!

Good cake, though I made some modifications.  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/2 cup of applesauce. I also added a sprinkle of nutmeg and a tsp of cinnamon. (Next time I'll add more nutmeg and cinnamon) I beat the eggs and oil together before adding them to the dry ingredients. I was sure to mix the batter thoroughly. The consistency was not dense but moist and light. Personally, I prefer a dense cake but since I was making this for co-workers I wanted the cake to be more cake-like. Most of my co-workers like fluffy cakes.  I highly recommend this recipe.

This cake is delicious. So rich, though. When I make it again I will replace the oil with apple sauce, as previous users have suggested, to cut down some on the fat and calories.

I have made this several times and keep forgetting to review the recipe. I really have nothing new to add except that this cake truely is wonderful! It is one of those cakes that just keep getting better and better each day. I stick pretty closely to the recipe except I do add some cinnamon. I chop some of the apples in small pieces and leave some in larger chunks. I also omit the walnuts because my DH does not like them. But definitely try this one. It is a keeper.

Usually when I make a 9 x 13 cake some of it ends up getting thrown away - Not This One! The kids were fighting over the last piece and the husband guy loved it too! While I was mixing the batter I thought that maybe I had left out some of the ingredients as it was VERY thick (I read in the directions that it would be thick but this was thick thick!) I baked it anyway and it came out perfect! The only changes that I made were adding some cinnamon (can't have apples without cinnamon can you?) and substituted pecans for walnuts just cuz thats what I had on hand. The carmel glaze was fantastic - do not omit this step! Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This was really nice. I added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. allspice, 1/4 tsp. cloves and about 1/2 tsp. fresh nutmeg. I only had one apple, which yielded about 2 cups chopped, but it was still fine. The cake has a very nice texture and the perfect sweetness; in my opinion, serving it with a glaze made it too sweet, so I'd suggest serving it without the glaze. The next time I make this (which will be soon) I'll substitute applesauce for half of the oil because the cake was VERY greasy. A lovely recipe!

Good moist cake. Some points:
* WAY too much sugar. I cut it down to 1.25 cups and still seemed very sweet.
* Reduced oil to 1 cup.
* Used 2 apples and 3/4 cup applesauce. Could probably have used more.
* Added: 1/2 t cinnamon, couple dashes of nutmeg, cloves, cardamon. Yum!
* I baked it in a 11 x 7 in pan for close to an hour. Raised the temp to 370 for the first 40 minutes, which gave it a nice dark crust that is really yummy.

this is a wonderful cake!!!  I did as suggested by a previous review and only added 3/4 c. oil and 1/2 c. applesauce.  The cake is still very moist and I love the consistency.  The glaze is a great addition and very tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe.

This cake is very moist and has an excellent texture.  But, I minimized the amount of oil and brown sugar and it still was great!
3/4 cup of oil & 1/2 cup of brown sugar.

I followed this recipe verbatim- soo good!  Wow, such a moist cake, and the glaze!  My god it disappeared in a flash.  **Off topic, but I didn't bother reading as many reviews as I usually do because everyone gave tips on cutting the calories by replacing this with that.  This is a recipe for a CAKE.  Just make it as written, and share it with 9 people so you don't eat the whole thing yourself. ;)**  Thanks Deb~ this is a keeper!

This cake is quite similar to the German Apple Cake recipe that my friend gave to me from her grandmother many years ago. The difference is that it is baked in a Bundt pan and in addition to being delicious, it's great looking. I use 1 Cup brown sugar 1/2 cup butter or margarine and 1/4 cup milk for the frosting and bring it to a slow boil and simmer for 5-10 minutes. I put half of the frosting on while the cake is still in the bundt pan and the rest when the cake is cooled completely and on the serving platter.

Everyone loved this.   Followed suggestions including substituting 1/2 c. applesauce for some of the oil, adding 1 T cinnamon to the batter and tossing the apples with some cinnamon and nutmeg before adding.

This recipe won me first prize in our office's apple bake off! of course I didn't use nuts, and I altered the oil with apple sauce to cut a few of the calories off. And i used the dark brown sugar for the topping. People actually tasted this cake and moaned a little. You won't be disappointed by it!!!

This is the first review I've done for allrecipes, but this cake was too good! I cooked this for my family, and they were crazy for it! In fact, half of it was gone the first day! Fresh apples really make the difference. I followed the recipe, didn't make any adjustments and it tasted Outrageous! I definitely will make this again!

This was pretty good, but I think it could of been a tad bit better.  The edges of the cake had soaked up the "sauce" that was poured over it, but the middle pieces just had a slight glaze on top of them.  Next time, I plan to poke holes in the top of the cake, before pouring on the sauce.  That way the every piece will have that wonderful carmel sauce in it.  I also added cinnamon, fresh nutmeg, and raisins too.

I thought it would never happen... but it did... This is the first recipe that I've tried from this site that was bad. VERY, VERY greasy. Topping is too sweet for the flavours (or lack thereof) of the cake. I should have listened to my instincts when I realized that the only liquid in the cake came from the oil. This is the first (and hopefully last) disaster that I've created from Allrecipes.

Do not try to make this as a bundt cake. Way too moist. I will give this five stars, although I threw mine away. I was so sad I didn't use the pan called for in the recipe.

I had apple cake baked for a hundred at a big barbeque and looked for a recipe for quite a while. This was delicious and I've baked it twice already. The second time I cut some of the oil and sugar, substituted 1/3 whole wheat flour and added some wheat germ, and it was just as good and healthier. This will be a big favorite of mine.

Very good! Before adding the apples to the batter, I tossed them with a teaspoon of cinammon and 1/4 cup brown sugar. This spiced it better. I skipped the sugar glaze/topping, which cuts down on the richness and served with whipped topping instead. Moist and delicious!

Fabulous recipe...we couldn't stop eating it! I made it in two small bundt pans; put one in the freezer and kept the other one out for dessert and snacking. The recipe is perfect as is; it needs no adjusting.

cutting down on the sugar and fat using applesauce in place of oil, reducing the sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/2 cups are great suggestions by other reviewers.  this will always be my go to cake. i love one bowl cakes like these. i did add a good douse of cinnamon, as most reviewers were right, apples and cinnamon go hand in hand.  enjoy

This is a great cake!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I added 2 tsp. cinn.  That's it.  The 1st day, it WAS a little oily, but after that, it kept the cake quite moist; it didn't become a dry cake.  Next time, I'll try suggestions of applesauce/oil, but if I don't have applesauce on hand, I'll make it again w/just the oil.  The icing is AWESOME!!  Everyone I shared this cake with commented on how delicious the icing was.  I would not make it w/out doing the icing because it gives it that special, unique, homemade touch.

Oh my gosh, this tasted fabulous cold!  I made this "as-is" so I could know if I wanted to make any changes, but it doesn't need changing.  So far today I've received rave reviews from co-workers.  Next time I might add cinnamon just because, but I really like it just like this.  The glaze or topping gives a hint of caramel apple flavor.

This was a quick and easy recipe.  The only change I made to the instructions was to add a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry ingredients.  It was easy as can be to assemble and glaze.  We ate slices while it was still warm and this is definitely the way to go.  This cake is fantastic warm.  However, it does not sit well.  Probably due to the large amount of vegetable oil in the recipe it gets oily and greasy after sitting overnight.  The leftovers were not particularly appealing.  But if you're baking this to be eaten the same day, it's a slam dunk.

Very good cake. I did follow the advice of others and decreased the oil to 3/4c. and added 1/2c.of chuncky applesauce, all I had in the pantry. Also cut back on the sugar to 1 1/2c. Turned out pretty good, very moist, but it is missing something, I think I may try adding 1 tsp. of nutmeg and also cinnammon next time..

This was really good. I was out of oil so I used 1 C mayonnaise (which I like to do in cakes anyway)and 1/4 C applesauce. It turned out really good! I will be making this many times over!

This recipe ranks as one of my favorites.  I do make many of the changes listed below: replace all of the oil with natural applesauce, use 1c whole wheat flour and 2c white flour, use 1c brown sugar and 1/2c white sugar, increase the amount of apples to 4-4.5c, add a heaping of cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, and I reduce the topping to 3tbs butter, 1/3c skim milk and 1c brown sugar.

I took this dessert to a dinner party tonight and it was a hit!  Based on notes in previous reviews, I made the following modifications: used only 1 C oil, 1.5 C sugar, and added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp allspice and 1/4 tsp cloves.  I made the caramel glaze topping but there was way too much of it.  I only drizzled about 1/3 of the sauce over the top of the cake.  Followed the suggestion of a prior reviewer to blend flour mix & oil/eggs well before adding apples & walnuts, and the cake was perfectly moist, not too crumbly at all!  It was sweet but not too sweet for our tastes.  Everyone loved this and said that from now on this is what they want when I'm in charge of dessert. :)

This cake was a huge hit with my friends.  I did try and add more apple than it called for and made the cake very crumbly.  Stick with the amount it calls for and cut them in nice small pieces.

It was moist and the amount of apple is quite nice.  I felt the need to add quite a few spices though.  I added cinnamon, allspice, ground cloves, and nutmeg-- and they added quite a good kick to the cake.  I also didn't bake it in the recommended pan size as I only had a 9 inch round cake pan.  This increased the baking time  to over an hour but left it with a nice brown crust.  The nuts are a definite requirement in this cake because even with them the cake is a little too sweet for my taste (even though I didn't add the whole two cups!).  I also added 1/2 cup of applesauce and reduced the oil to 3/4 cup.  The icing/frosting isn't a requirement at all-- in fact I'd advise against it.  All in all an excellent recipe with a few adjustments.  I'll make it again if I have an overflow of apples at home!

This recipe gave me a great starting point for my cake. I especially appreciate that this is an actual cake recipe, as so many of these recipes call for using yellow cake mix! Ugh! 

For me, it was missing cinnamon. So, after I diced the apples, I mixed 1 cup of sugar (taken from the 2 cups called for in the cake batter) with 1 tablespoon of cinnnamon, then mixed it into the apples and let them set awhile.

I also eliminated the nuts, because someone here doesn't like them!

A terrific cake, I really liked the glaze.

Everyone loved this one!  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of white sugar for the cake, and I added 1 teaspoonful of ground cinnamon. Next time, I'll use less sugar and take the cake out sooner than 40 minutes.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

Delicious and simple to make!  I reduced the oil to 3/4 cup and added 1/4 milk (I thought it called for too much oil) and cut the glaze by 1/2 (you don't need to add all that butter to make it yummy).  I will be making this one again.

Oh my goodness is this good!  After several field trips to apple orchards I had more apples than I knew what to do with.  My 4 year old daughter wanted to make an apple cake.  My mother had just made one a month or so ago that was really good but I just didn't have all the ingredients on hand so I went searching.  I'm SO GLAD I found this recipe.

This cake is SO moist and I didn't find it crumbly at all.  The only change I made was adding a little cinnamon just because I like it.  If I made it again I might decrease the amount of glaze a bit.  I really like it but don't know if it needs it.  I'd maybe make 1/2 - 3/4ths of it.  It's rich and sweet and I think I ate 1/2 the cake yesterday.  It's one of those things I keep cutting a little piece of and nibbling on.  I can't resist.  I like it with whipped cream and I like it cold the best.

I noticed some reviewers left out some oil and then thought it was dry.  There's really not a lot of moisture in this cake except for the oil and eggs.  Also, I think the apples probably need to be chopped decently or it would make the cake crumbly. 

I'm off to have another piece now!

This cake is absolutely delicious.  I left out the nuts, only becasue I didn't have any. I think they would add a wonderful flavor though.  I also used part white sugar instead of only brown sugar bc I was almost out.  Still it tasted great.  The cake absorbs the glaze which helps to make it super moist.  This cake can be heavy and rich though, so if you are looking for a light dessert, this is not it. It is wonderfuly sweet. I could see adding more apples though to enhance the apple flavor.

This was one of the best apple cakes I've ever had.  It was so moist and dense.  I added a tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg to the dry ingredients.  It was devoured! Will add it to the favorites list. Thanks Deb!

4 stars as written, 5 with alterations! First off I used one stick of butter and 3/4 cup unsweetened apple sauce instead of the oil, that way its not only healthier but also less greasy. I also decreased the amount of sugar to 1 2/3 cup and increased the apples to around 4 cups. I also omitted the nuts. I've never tried the topping from the recipe but as  cake I like to use cream cheese frosting, but for a "healthier" option I make them as muffins(no topping/frosting). Fantastic for breakfast with a cup of coffee!!
Update: I have also tried them with 1 1/2 cup sugar, replaced the oil with one banana mashed(didn't have apple sauce) and a half cup oil. I also used ener-g egg replacer(I don't like eggs and never have them on hand) and it still came out great. This time I baked it as a loaf, which was quite nice for breakfasts.

Delicious! I added 1 tbsp cinnamon and 1 tbsp of nutmeg, and skipping the topping to save calories and time. This cake is a bit heavier than Apple Cake IV. The family loved it, it was gone in a day and I was immediately asked for more.

Great cake and so easy to make! I've made some changes though: I've added raisins and reduced oil to 3/4 cup and sugar to 1 1/2 cups (will reduce more next time). I did need to add more liquid though to the batter so I've squeezed some tangerines I had around. I also added cinnamon and carnation and didn't add the glaze!The cake was sweet, dense and full of taste even without it!

It's hard to find the words to describe how good this is. Tons of calories but if you're in the mood for a delicious fall dessert and are not worried about calories, this is the recipe for you. I made it in two small bundt pans; one to eat now and one for the freezer.

I usually love sweets but this one is way too sweet. All I can taste is the sugar. It hurt my teeth and gave my a stomach ache. The cake is also heavy like a pound cake and not light. Sorry I won't make it again.

This cake was delicious and easy to make. I served it at a dinner party this past week and my friends loved it. Plus, I only had to purchase the apples and walnuts. This is a great recipe if you're on a limited budget and a tight schedule!

I tried this recipe today and it turned out to be very good. The only problem I had was that it was too sweet for my liking. I only put in 1 cup of white sugar, had I put in 2, I'm not sure I could have eaten as much. Also, instead of oil, I put in some apple sauce because I had some on hand that I wanted to use up.

This cake...well takes the cake! Of course, I can never leave a recipe alone...so I decided to I used 2 large honeycrisp apples, and added 1 tsp cinnamon, as well as a jigger of rum. For the glaze, I also added a half jigger of rum and an 1/8 tsp cornstarch. :-) Fun recipe to experiment with!

This recipe is fabulous! The only thing I change is I sub half of the oil for applesauce. My Husband literally requests this once a week!! The first week I made it he asked that I make another one the very next day. Lets just say this has become our new favorite dessert...

This was very very delicious!! I made it for Christmas and used some of the changes others had noted. I only used 1 1/2 c. sugar and halved the oil by using 3/4 c. oil and 3/4 c. applesauce.  Absolutely use the sauce!!  That is a must.  It is a "keeper" recipe.

My neighbor just gave me this recipe except using pears instead of apples. It's great but next time I'll add some cinnamon and maybe ginger. It is greasey so will probably sub apple sauce for some of the oil too.

Great cake -- people at work loved it. Based on reviews, I did replace the oil with unsweetened applesauce; used 1 c brown sugar & 1/2 c white instead of all white; added 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (probably could've added a touch more). All in all, very easy to mix up and tasted great. I also didn't skimp on the sauce -- made up and poured on all of it. Honestly, the best part! Next time, I might try only putting half on to absorb then giving it time to get just barely warm before pouring on the rest -- the top did have a gooey appearance and maybe having a cooled layer of sauce on top would help. But, I'll definitely be making this one again!

I have to start off saying this is the first time making an apple cake. I followed the directions with a few substitutions as suggested by some reviewers. I used 3 large apples which equaled about 3 1/2 cups. I used half the oil and about 1/2 cup of applesauce. I mixed the oil and eggs well before adding the apples and I opted out on the nuts. The cake batter was dense, not too oily or sweet for me or my kids taste. However, the cake batter did taste a little too much like the baking soda and I know I only used 1 TSP. I forgot to add some cinnamon and other spices to the batter so added it to the topping. I also poked holes in the cake and slowly added all of the topping mixture to give the cake time to absorb it all.

Don't overbake the cake.  It will dry out.  I didn't really like the sauce that goes ontop of the cake.  After it cooled I felt like there was just a layer of grease laying on top.  I put it on when it was hot, but it didn't melt into the cake.  The cake itself is very yummy though.

Awesome recipe, but I have to try it sometime substituting some of the oil for apple sauce because this turns out to be a very heavy and oily cake. VERY good though.

This recipe was delish! I made it for my mother's birthday, and was highly complimented on it. And I ended up eating a LOT of it myself!
A few alterations: I used 1 2/3 C sugar, an extra apple, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves. 
Do note, for all of you who cut sugar and add applesauce in place of oil, depending on the kind of applesauce you use, you may be adding a LOT of sugar right back in. Try unsweetened applesauce.

Very good and easy recipe. My husband would give it 5 stars, it was too sweet and wet for me with the glaze. I would make it again for him and skip the glaze on mine.

The batter was so lumpy, almost like cookie dough, that I had to press it into the pan with the back of a spoon.  I knew something was wrong, but baked it anyway.  It came out the same way:  crumbly like oily sugar.  What on earth did I do wrong?  I may make it again because there is just no way that anyone would have given this five stars, NO WAY, so I must have messed something up.  I'll update my review if anything changes next try.

Instead of making the 9x13 version of this cake.  I put it into two 10-inch round pans and made a two layer cake.  The glaze on this cake is the clincher!  I also used a vanilla pastry cream between the layers and frosted it with a nice light cream cheese frosting.  There were many happy faces when this one was tasted by the wedding party!  Divine!

i excluded the nuts in this recipe and it went all wrong.  the cake was crumbly and way to sweet.  i'm not sure if i did anything wrong but the "glaze" just seeped in and soaked the cake and made it supersweet.

This is an amazing cake! I cut the sugar to 1.5 cups as opposed to the 2 cups and used margarine instead of butter for the glaze as that is all I had in the fridge! Overall this was soo good, recommend to anyone!

This was really excellent. I used 4 smallish Braeburn (tart) apples. Added 1/4 cup buttermilk as per one reviewer, and substituted half the white flour with w/wheat flour. Used half brown sugar and added 3/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts. It fitted into two 4"x8" pans, and took about 50 minutes to bake. It was simple to prepare, taking only a few minutes. I grated the apples. I gave it 5 stars because it's an easy and delicious recipe. It doesn't need a topping as a breakfast loaf. Because I didn't have two loaf pans, I made a tray of small muffins with the remaining mixture, topping them with demerara sugar. Baked them for 25 minutes. Just as good as the loaf. All demolished in one day.

Yummy! I was taking this to a gathering that included a couple of people with nut allergies, so I substituted craisins (dried cranberries) for the walnuts. I also added some cinnamon (didn't measure, just threw it in). It was delicious! I'll definitely be making this again since it's super easy.

I really wanted to like this cake. It baked up nicely, looked good, but the cake itself was surprisingly bland to me. The glaze did not help, the recipe made too much and ended up making the cake a sodden, way too sweet mess. I'll keep looking for that perfect apple cake recipe, unfortunately this was not it.

This cake is very good . I gave it only 4 stars as I found it didn't need so much sugar and fat. Like the others I reduced them , I added 1 c sugar and 3/4 c oil. Turned out fantastic...I also added some spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, alspice) very nice warm addition to a great cake..thanks..

It didn't come out very good for me. The mixture was very thick that I didn't know how to deal with it and was difficult to mix even with the electric mixer, which kind of got stuck in the mixture. The glaze topping was very sweet. The taste of the cake itself was ok, I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon.  I wouldn't make it again, although after a second trial it may come out better.

This cake was awesome. I did add a tsp of cinnamon and a sprinkle of nutmeg to enhance the flavor a bit. I used about half of the glaze on top of the cake. It was very moist and I would definately make this cake again.

Great cake, but eat it fast as it doesn't keep well for more than a day or two.  I followed the recipe as written, but only used about half of the topping and that was plenty.

Awesome! I took the suggestions of others and only used 3/4 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of applesauce - this worked fine. I used a combo of granny smith and macintosh apples and added about 1 t. of cinnamon on top.  I poked fork holes in the cake and added the warm glaze to the top so that some of the glaze seeped into the cake.  The glaze really is what sets this cake apart from others.  Good enough to serve for the holidays.

This cake was so easy to make and turned out excellent.  I am using a toaster oven so I couldn't fit the pan size required in.  However, I had enough batter to make 3 smaller cakes.  I froze 2 of them.  I will be making this again and again.  Good for unexpected company.

The cake itself is delicious.  I subbed out a cup of the oil with applesauce and reduced sugar to  1 1/2 cups.  I thought the cake this way was not overly greasy nor overly sweet - very good.   I wish I had left off the "glaze."  It never hardened on the cake - it's more of a sauce and so super sweet!  I had to throw away all the borders of the cake where the sauce soaked into the cake and ruined it.  My rating is for the cake only.  Very good with the substitutions noted.  As for the "glaze", unless you like your cake SUPER sweet, I suggest a light dusting of powdered sugar.

Wonderful cake! Would definitely make this again. I did tweek it a little to make it a bit more healthy. I used 1/2 cup of Splenda Blend in place of the cup of white sugar. I also replaced all the amount of oil with applesauce. I then took another reviewers advice and added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon. The cake turned out great, very moist and lots of flavor.

OMG THIS IS THE BEST.  I made a few modification per other reviews and this cake was delish.  Had guest for dinner and this was desert.  Everyone had to have 2nds.  I modified the recipe by using only applesauce no oil, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup white sugar.  The perfect cake everyone wants me to make it again.  Thanks for such a great dessert

This cake is wonderful! Normally I would have never made a cake like this, but I'm glad I did. I didn't make any changes to the cake itself, but I did add nutmeg, cinnamon and some ground clove to the sauce. It is just delicious!!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!!!!!!

I used 1cp of wheat flour and two cps of all purpose flour.  For the glaze I changed it to 1/4 of a cup because it tasted too much like butter when I made I made it the first time.  My husband actually ate it and he doesn't like cake.

I just made this a little while ago! and it's great! Very tad on the sweet side,I didn't put the walnuts in but it's still great. The sweetness is STRONG but not over-powering,just almost,well,with so much regular sugar and brown sugar for the glaze,no wonder.

I really didn't like this recipe.  I usually love any desserts but I couldn't even finish my piece of this cake.  It was way too sugary and really greasy.  I definitely won't be making this again.

Excellent, nice and sweet.  I did use all of the glaze, waiting 15 minutes before pouring the other half on.  I added slivered almonds instead of walnuts and 1/2 sultana raisins.  I did use cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg.

My best advice?  Double the sauce!  Don't put it ALL on the cake, save some to drizzle over each piece.  I didn't use any fat in the cake, I used only 1 1/2 c sugar (instead of 2), 1 1/4 c unsweet applesauce (instead of oil) and 3/4 c egg beaters (instead of eggs).  I used 4 c chopped granny smith apples and added tsp allspice and tbsp cinnamon.  For the sauce I used my tub margarine (only 6 gm fat per tbsp) and it worked fine!  This was one of the best desserts I have ever made.  It's REALLY good warm and if you run out of sauce, use ice cream or frozen yogurt, YUUUUMMY!!!  I think the fact that it was made lower fat made it taste EVEN better!!!

This is the second time I have made this cake and I love it.  It is a very sweet cake, but wonderful with a cup of coffee of tea.  The first time I made it exact and it was delicious.  The second time I reduced the sugar and it was still delicious.  I have had many compliments on this cake.  Thank you for a great recipe.

This cake is divine.  Perhaps too sweet, but can you fault a dessert for that?  Next time I will do everything the same except cut the glaze in half (at least).

I thought this recipe was ok, but somewhat bland. I used most of the recommendations of other reviewers, including substituting apple sauce for much of the oil and adding 2 tsp. of apple pie spice. I think that must have helped- I can't imagine how bland it would be without the apple pie spice (or the other spices recommended). I'll probably keep looking for an apple cake recipe.

This cake was awesome!  Everyone couldn't stop eating it.  I only used two eggs (not by choice, I just ran out of eggs) and a little less sugar and it was still great.  Next time though I might make a little less glaze because it was incredibly sweet.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS.......I am an avid baker. Most recipes with apples call for cinnamon, I was pleased to find one that didn't.I really like the taste of the fruit to come through. Saying this, the only change I made was for my taste (1/2 tsp vanilla & 1/2 tsp sherry) insted of 2 tsp vanilla. The topping was perfect. this one will go in my little wooden recipe box.

This was a delicious cake!  A few things I would change:  I used 6 tablespoons of butter that I melted in the microwave instead of the oil, and I added 1 tablespoon of cinnamon and nutmeg each.  It came out great--the cake was gone within 15 minutes!

Loved the ease of this recipe and the results were awesome (note PAST tense, since it did not last but a couple of hours)! Searched for a recipe to use up some apples and found this one.  Am glad I did.  Took cake to a Baptism party and it was devoured with everyone requesting the recipe.  Wow, what a find.  Thanks, Deb.  This one is going into my favourites!

Excellent. Moist dense cake. I forgot to add the nuts, so I just pressed nuts into the top of the batter and after baking I put on the cooked topping. It made an excellent crunchy topping. I'll make this mistake again.

Yum!  I made this cake for my husband's birthday and he said it's his new favorite cake.  Looking at the modifications others had made, I changed the recipe a bit.  I added 2 scant cups of sugar, probably 1 3/4 cups, decreased the oil to 1 c. olive oil (in the baked cake the olive flavor was not noticeable), and whole and crushed toasted pecans instead of walnuts.  I also added some cinnamon and nutmeg, probably 1 tablespoon and 3/4 teaspoon respectively.  I whisked the wet ingredients together before adding them to the dry ingredients in the mixer bowl.  The batter was the consistency of a quick bread batter.  I used a greased and floured bundt pan instead of a 9x13 pan and had no problems removing the cake from the pan.  I did have to bake the cake longer due to the bundt pan, a total of 70 minutes.  

The glaze recipe does make a whole lot of topping, but my husband loves caramel and we spooned the pooled caramel from the plate over our slices.  We really enjoyed this cake and I will definitely make it again.

we loved the recipe. i added extra apples because we didnt have walnuts and followed suggestions from other reviewers.  I used 3/4 cup oil with 1/2 apple sauce. Combined the beaten egg, oil and apple sauce before mixing it with the dry ingredients. added 1 tsp of nutmeg and 2 tsp of cinnamon. and it turned out great. now everyone wants the recipe. :)

I made this for breakfast today and it was absolutely delicious.  I sprinkle just a little cinnamon on the top before baking and used pecans for the nuts.  I had my daughters and father here and the cake was gone before the dishes were washed.  I will definitely put it in my favorites recipe box.  Thanks for sharing Deb!

My husbdand is allergic to walnuts so I added coconut flakes instead, about 1/2-3/4 cup. In addition, I also added a pinch of nutmeg and 1/2 tspn of cinnamon. This is a great recipes for the fall when apples are in season!

Oh wow! I'd never made a fruit cake before, but this turned out so good! Very moist. I shredded the apples instead of chopping them, and used a cinnamon buttercream icing on top. It turned out great! Thanks!

I made this cake as directed, except I used about 1/2 cup unsweetened applesauce and 3/4 cup oil rather than 1 1/4 cups of oil (that's a LOT of oil).  Also I added some cinnamon to the batter, yes, it was very thick!  I've nothing bad to say about this recipe, I just wasn't really wild about it.  I thought the glaze seeped in a bit much too, and I didn't even use all of it, maybe I should have cooked it longer, I don't know. My husband will take it to work in the morning, and I'm sure it will get eaten...but I don't think I'll make it again.

This cake was ok.  Its basically a basic yellow cake with apples and sugar baked on top.  Not as good as the traditional Dutch variety that my oma made.  Make sure you flour the pan too or else it won't come out

Although this cake has a good flavor it is extremely oily and crumbly.  WAY too many apples- it is like the "cake" is secondary to the fruit!!!Also, the icing should be only be used as a drizzle over individual slices rather than poured over the entire top where it hardens and looks so unattractive.  Be forewarned that by day two it is almost too oily to eat anymore.  If I make this again I will definitely cut back on the oil and fruit.  I believe it would last longer.

This was one of the best cakes I ever had.  I used four cups of apples and 3/4 of the glaze. My fmily went crazy over it.  The top gets nice and crunchy an the middle is very moist.  Delicious warm and cold. Thanks for the recipe!

What I have to say boils down to bsically this.  "WOW"!  I'm not very experienced with baking but I found this recipe pretty easy.As far as time goes if you use fresh apples the pealing and chopping can eat up some time but the end product is deffinately worth it.  My son didn't like the cake but that was after he found out it had nuts in it.  (He eats them all the time and doesn't know it.)  I took this cake to church function and a person said - "I want to just go and put my face in it."  It went over very well.  It has a very full flavor and is great with a cup of coffee or milk.

Delicious! I needed a dessert idea for apples that wasn't another pie/crumble and this was just what I wanted! I read many reviews and decided to follow the most popular modifications; I used 3/4 cup of unsweetened apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil, reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups, and added a whole tablespoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of nutmeg. The cake came out very moist and the density was really similar to banana bread. I was worried that the glaze would be too rich, but it was perfect! Don't skip the glaze!

I followed the recipe as it was but had golden delicious apples left over from applesauce so I used those and didn't add nuts as a friend is allergic to them.  My friends, family and coworkers thoroughly enjoyed it.  I will definitely make this again!!!

Made this cake yesterday. Ate first piece while still warm and  another piece today.  Enjoyed both warm and cold. Very good. Moist and a hint of sweet/buttery flavor from the glaze. I like cakes that don't require frosting. This is a 5star cake

Really good. Added 1 Tbsp cinnamon and otherwise followed recipe exactly. Top is a little crunchy and cake is super moist. Will probably cut back on oil by a 1/4-1/2 cup because it really doesn’t need it, and to make it a little healthier.

I've made this several times and it was delicious! However,  I only use 2 cups of sugar and 2 cups of flour. I mix my red delicious apples with the sugar until it is syrupy. I decreased the oil to 3/4 cup. I also used the entire walnut pack.  It was delicious and turned out perfect! I'm giving it 4 stars bc I need do some modifications.

I have made this cake several times now. I've used fresh apples, frozen homemade apple pie filling and yesterday, I tried it with fresh pears. It's so easy and always comes out wonderful! I've even switched the caramel topping out for cream cheese frosting and it's still great. Hubby loves it too! This is now my go to recipe to use up apples (or pears now too!)

This cake is wonderful very moist and when making the glaze for the cake it seemed a bit to runny so I added some caramel s to the sauce to melt and then pour over cake. It is a great reminder of fall. And yes it is a keeper and I will make again.

Way, way too much oil and no spices, whatsoever. Would probably be good if those were modified. Caramel glaze was unique and good.

I made according to the recipe but also added a cup of raisins and rather than use the caramel topping, I sprinkled about a tablespoon of  cinnamon and sugar (mixed together) on top as soon as I took it out of the oven.  It was delicious!

When they say the batter will be dense...they mean it! I didn't think I'd ever get the apples & nuts mixed in! I only used 1 cup oil and 1 cup sugar. Do mix your eggs and oil together in a separate bowl before adding to dry ingredients.   And I  added 1Tbs cinnamon tossed with the apples (I used granny smith)  and nuts (pecans). All that to say THIS CAKE IS AMAZING! Oh, that ooey gooey sauce that you pour over top! I made it in a bunt pan. Everyone at our church supper said I outdid myself with this one!

Love love love this cake!!! The first time I made it I was sad that the glaze wasn't more thick. However, after first bite it didn't matter! This cake is full of flavor and is a huge hit around my home during fall.

Because of the caramel sauce it is very sweet, which was good, but I found the actual cake lacking in flavour.  I would make it again with the addition of cinnamon and nutmeg for a little more flavour variety.

Made it as a bundt cake.  Takes an extra 10 minutes to bake but worth it.  I cut the sugar down by 1/2 a cup and replaced all the oil with unsweetened apple sauce.  As the apples bake they release natural sugar that makes it sweet but not too sweet.  I added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the batter to spice it up.  Would recommend not starting the topping until the cake is out of the oven so it cools while you make the syrup.

I make this cake beginning every fall and continue to make it several times throughout the cold winter months and it is a huge hit. I typically do not alter the recipe except for the cooking time and positioning of the oven rack. I found that for the best results with my oven I need to extend cooking time by 15 minutes and I have to bump my rack up closer to the top of the oven. This is a great recipe and a great alternate to apple pie or coffee cake. My husband and my niece beg for this cake every year. Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

I made this cake for the first time; the only change I made was that I added 2tsp of cinnamon. This has to be the best cake I've ever made,   will  most certainly make again, but I will probably try one of the less fattening variations. It is sooo delicious!

This is my second time I made this cake.  It is quick, easy and delicious.  I added a teaspoon of cinnamon, one fourth teaspoon of nutmeg and used one half cup of applesauce to replace one half cup of the oil as was suggested by some others.  I also just made half of the glaze which was just the perfect amount.  We love black walnuts so  I added 3/4 cup of those as well.  I will be making this cake for Thanksgiving this year.

This was yummy.  Only made a couple of changes based on some reviews.  I used 1/2 cup oil and 3/4 cup homemade applesauce (McIntosh).  I also used McIntosh apples in the cake.  Added 1 tsp. cinnamon.  The cake was moist and delicious...love the caramel type topping!

This cake as written is like eating pure sugar.  You can't even taste the apples.  The cake looked nice until I put the glaze on then it looked to wet.  I tried to take some the glaze off put it seeped into the cake.  I ended up throwing the whole thing out and I love all cakes with apples in them but this was a total bust.

This is one of my favourite cake recipes. I substitute half of the oil for unsweetened apple sauce and omit the walnuts. I make my own icing (a maple buttercream one), then I drizzle smuckers caramel sauce and sprinkle skor bits on top. It is to die for!

i didn't like it. i do like the topping but not on this cake. The cake was simply flavourless.I cut the oil in half and used 3/4 cup milk. It took an extra 20min to cook and then it got to brown around the sides. I wont make this cake again

Delicious and easy apple cake! Few changes: instead of walnuts I used shaved almonds and raisins. Also I added some milk in the batter, put less salt (1/2 tsp), more baking soda (1 1/2 tsp) and added 1 1/2 tsp of baking powder. Spices: 2 tsp cinnamon and 1 1/2 cardemon. About 1 hour at 160 degrees Celsius. The glaze is a must!

I think this was a very good recipe,and even though it was probably more than I could have eaten my whole family loved it as well! seeing as comments to changing some things around....I really don't understand if you feel like its too fattening or that its too sweet, its what the recipe calls for! But overall very good.

This cake is awesome!  Just a small piece with a scoop of vanilla ice cream is satisfying.  A company's coming recipe.

Very yummy recipe. I substituted whole wheat flour for the all-purpose flour, applesauce for the oil and used about twice as many apples. I also did not use the topping. It was very moist and delicious!

This cake is just OK.  I have tried a couple of the apple cake recipes and have been disappointed and I think it is me.  I want my apples in a pie.  I wanted to rate this according to the way I felt about it but try it if you like your apples in a cake, you probably won't be disappointed with this recipe.

I was so dissapointed in the topping for this cake. It was watery and made my cake kinda soggy. Everyone ate it and enjoyed it with icecream, but they didn't know that I poured a whole stick of melted butter on top! I think that this cake is worthy of trying again, with a streusel-like topping. I added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon to the cake, and an extra 1/2 cup of apples.

To die for!  The first time I made it I followed recipe exactly and it was delicious.  The second time I used 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup of vegetable oil to cut back the fat and added two teaspoons of cinnamon.  It was just as good!

I didn't use any oil- I used half unsweetened applesauce and half homemade apple butter instead.  This cut out lots of fat and added tons of flavor.  The spices from the apple butter add a delicious touch.  Thank you for the recipe!

I'm not much of a baker, in fact this was my first "real" baking experiment (from scratch that is) and I thought I'd try making this, turns out we had guests coming and they could smell it so I served some up for them. My uncle said it reminded him of a cake he'd had in Holland years ago. I'm so proud of myself, it was actually very good. I made a few change as some reviewers suggested, 2 cups of whole wheat flour and one all purpose. I used applesauce instead of the oil and reduced the sugar on the glaze, delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

This cake was amazing! I had fresh picked honeycrisp apples and I wanted to use them to make something other then the old fall stand-by,apple crisp, this recipe really delivered. We had my fiance's parents over for his "last" dinner ( he was deployed on 10/01) so I wanted to make a really special dessert that he'd love. I thought at first that I made too much glaze, but it was just the right amount. This recipe is a keeper!! The cake only made it 2 days, we had it for breakfast it was that good!!

Great recipe! This was the 1st made from scratch cake I've ever tried, can't believe it was so easy & really didn't take that long.  I did have on hand some bananas that needed to be ate (3) so I added those. As for the glaze, I didn't have but the 1/4 cp of brown sugar-so I mixed cinnimon sugar & reg. sugar to make up for the other cp.  Not bad for a 1st time try-thank you for the inspiration!!-my boyfriend loved it!

Made this cake yesterday & adjusted the sugar amt. as per reviews. Cake is a winner. The glaze was wonderful. But...besides adding cinnamon, next time I will add raisins & chopped dates. This cake is party worthy.

I made this last night and it was so good, I can't wait to have another piece tonight. Like others I used 3/4 cup apple sauce and 1/2 cup of oil to cut down on the fat. I also added 1 tbsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp of ginger.

This recipe is solid, but I can't say it was great. I added extra apples, some cinamon, substituted some whole wheat flour and applesauce for the oil. Everyone at work "liked" it but didn't "love" it.

The whole family loved this! I changed the all purpose flour to 1c and added 2c. whole wheat flour. Also, I cut the oil back to 1/2c. and added 1c. cinnamon applesauce. It was more like a coffee cake, so basically it's good anytime of day!

I thought this was a wonderful cake!!  I have 3 picky eaters and they all loved it!!  I did a few changes though, I used 1 cup applesauce and only 1/4 cup of oil, and I used 1 cup wheat flour and 2 cups all purpose flour.  I also added a good sprinkle cinnamon. I also added a little vanilla to the glaze.  It was wonderful! I will make this again!

This is very good although I did make several changes. I think with my modifications the only thing I will do differently next time is add some spices. The flavor made as written is pretty plain. Really needs some cinnamon and probably some nutmeg. Great base though, thank you.

Like most of the reviews say about this cake..."it's AWESOME."...I used 1 1/2 cups of white sugar...1/4 cup of oil and a full cup of unsweetened applesauce.  Also added l teaspoon of cinnamon and one teaspoon of nutmeg.  That was the extent of my changes to this recipe except I used 4 large Granny Smith apples and chopped them up in small pieces...This apple cake has got to be one of the BEST recipes ever...Thanks so much for sharing it..Sooooooooooooooo good.

Mmmmmm...very good.  This is a very dense cake, similar to the density of a muffin.  Like other reviewers, I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, 1/4 teaspoon allspice, 1/8 teaspoon cloves.  I whisked the egg, oil, and vanilla together before I added it to the dry ingredients.  I baked it for 45 minutes but I think that might've been a bit too long as it seemed a little dry from overcooking.  I didn't make the topping and served it with whipped cream instead.

Everyone who tried this loved it! I left out the nuts, and I thought it might be too much oil, so I just put in the one cup of oil and put in milk for the other 1/4 cup of oil. It turned out great! Thanks for submitting this great recipe

I made this for a brunch, and it was a big hit! I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon just to give it a little kick, and it was absolutely delicious.

This was really delicious & rich, I served it at a baby shower and got asked for the recipe a couple times.  Like others suggested I spiced it up by adding cinnamon and nutmeg. Next time I make this I would do as others suggested and decrease the amount of oil and add applesauce it was a little to greasy.

This was pretty good, but seemed like it was missing something. I served the sauce on the side and thought that was a much better idea. It worked out into being an easy last minute dessert because I had all of the ingredients on hand.

Loved this cake!  Took it to work and the whole thing was gone by lunch.  Also received many requests to make again!  I used freshly picked apples (about 6 small) and substituted 1/2 cup of the oil for some homemade cinnamon apple sauce I had at my house.  I also added 1 extra tsp of cinnamon.  The result was a super moist and flavor filled treat.  I am going to try tonight to make into apple muffins.  Will update if they turn out well.

This is a fall favorite in our home!  I did make a few adjustments...I cut the sugar to 1 1/2 cups and added 1 teaspoon of nutmeg.  I also use a variety of apples.  My kids absolutely love this apple cake!  A favorite after visiting the apple orchard in the fall!  Very yummy...will make this over and over again!!

Exceptional Cake. I did not pour the sauce over the entire cake, I let my guests add the sauce, so they could have as much or as little as they liked.

Made this for my friend's birthday :)
She loved it!!! 
I followed this recipe except i added some raisins. I thought that it had way too much oil. you can see it all on top when it was baking.
Next time if i make this i think i will add 2 tablespoons of milk.

This was an excellent cake. My guests loved it. I did not add the walnuts as I did not have any on hand and it was fine. I also added some cinnamon to the batter and sprinkled some on top of the cake before baking to add color. I will use this recipe again.

This cake is fantastic! Especially warm with alittle extra of the carmal sauce poured over....... yummmmmmm!!! I did use applesauce instead of the oil, you don't miss it at all in this one. I left out the nuts, so I added a bit more chopped apples. Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so easy to make and very tasty too. I made a few changes...I reduced the oil to just under a cup. I added a heaping teaspoon of cinnamon to the batter. I reduced the sugar to 1 1/2 cups. It was perfect! The brown sugar glaze was delicious too. We will definitely make this again. My son really loved it and would have eaten the entire cake if I had let him! :O)

Very tasty with a wonderful smell! I eliminate the glaze, opting just for some cinnamon and brown sugar on top. I also like to add a pinch of cinnamon to the apples before folding into the batter

My family loved this so much. This has to be one of the best apple cakes we have ever had. Some of my family even ate it with ice cream, that was to die for!

This cake is GREAT!!! I have made it several times for my co-workers and my boyfriend's co-workers and they all can't stop licking their lips and fingers.  I add cinnamon on top of the cake prior to baking and I don't peel most of the apples.  Also, when chopping the apples I mostly make the pieces decent sized so they can be seen and tasted with each bite of the cake.  Easy recipe! Thanks!

Alright here goes...When the recipe said thick it meant THICK. The consistency of the batter (if such it could be called) was slightly thinner than a sugar cookie dough. In fact I would say it was possibly the same consistency. If you are thinking about making this "cake", it is wonderful. Many reviews said that it was not attractive. I have to disagree. I thought it was absolutely wonderful. Thanks for the recipe Deb!

Lovely tasting cake that all my friends loved.  I doubled the quantities & made 2 cakes: 1 to eat & 1 to freeze.  The 1 to eat went in 10 minutes!  The cake that I wanted to freeze, I first cut into squares.  Now I just take a couple of pieces out of the freezer, warm them in the microwave & they are delicious!  Great with ice cream as a dessert, too!  Everyone wants the recipe!  Thanks Deb.

This cake tastes phenomenal, even days later. I excluded the nuts since I didn't have them on-hand but the cake was still as good. I was a bit uncertain about the cake when I pulled it out of the oven and poured the brown sugar glaze over the cake because let's just say, it did not look very appetizing. However, when the cake sets, the cake tastes so moist and decadent. I thought the glaze was overly sweet, in my opinion, but my family assured me it was just fine. I'll definitely make this recipe again since my family enjoyed it so much. Next time, though, I'll substitute applesauce in place of the oil and include nuts and some cinnamon flavor. This is a really rich cake and it's a good cake for a large gathering since it feeds a lot. 

I have all but one qualm. This truly is not an apple cake; the apple taste is subtle and I think the name of the cake is misleading. However, I prefer the cake this way, where the apples are not a dominant flavor in the cake.

I added 1 TBSP of cinnamon and accidentally didn't have light brown sugar, so I used dark.  Having made it both ways we like the dark better.  I do think commercial caramel sauce would work well if you don't want to go to the effort.  I might even like that better.

Very good and easy!  I made it less sweet. It came out like a quick bread, but still very good. It is great when it come out hot, I can see my apple slices( modifcaton here). They are soft , tart and sweet. I love it. 
However, when it is cold, it seems too dry.  I modified it with 3/4 vegetable oil,1 big and 1 small sliced apple (about 4 cups), 1 cup of water, 1 tablespoon pimpkin spices, no walnut. Definitly make it again for a Sunnday breakfast.Thank you for the recipe.

The cake was definitely not a pretty cake---but it was delicious!  I made it for a house gathering and everyone loved it.  I didn't make the glaze; We all thought it was sweet enough.  Great cake...Thank you.

Excellent recipe.  My family loved this, and this will become a regular addition to the things I bake.  I baked this in a bundt cake pan and cut the glaze recipe in half.  It made for a beautiful presentation.

This recipe is a winner.......I always use it when I need a dessert that i know will not let me down!! Tastes good served with either cream or vanilla icecream. Don't hesitate to leave out the cinnamon....its a nice to change to have an apple cake without it. Its texture is firm, and it doesn't have  the eggy odour that many apple cakes can get. Thanks!!

This cake is GREAT! I only have a 9 X 9 pan so that's what I used along with a little 2 X 4 pan. I added 1 tsp cinnimon. I also halved the glaze. It required longer cooking . . . 1 1/2 hours but it was worth it. A great moist cake.

This was good but i think i would just cook it for 40 minutes next time. It was slightly dry and i think it would be better with more apples and some cinnamon.  The glaze is delicious, and very sweet.

Fabulous, with a few changes!!!
I added about a tablespoon of cinnamon.  What's an apple cake without cinnamon?  I also omitted the nuts and cut the glaze ingredients in half.  It was PLENTY.  This smells incredible while baking.  And my girlfriends raved about it.  Two of my friends wanted the recipe, so I printed it for them.  I forgot to tell one of them the changes I made and she made it just as the recipe calls for.  She said, "I'm confused.  Mine didn't turn out as good as yours..."  So, there ya go. :)  Be sure not to miss your workout after this one, tho!  Or have a small piece.  Wonderful!

this cake came out great!  i made it for my sister's birthday and everyone loved it, even the kids who normally don't like nuts.  i thought the caramel sauce was a little to sweet/buttery tasting so i only poured half of it on the cake, even so the cake tasted fabulous.  next time i may buy caramel topping and heat it up since i perfer it to the caramel in the recipe.

this is the best apple cake I've ever eaten.  I ended up using probably 4 cups of chopped apples and pecans instead of walnuts.  Also, I had some getting-stale coconut macaroon cookies which I crumbled up with the apples--YUM!  I used 1 cup of oil and only 1 cup of sugar.  I made a powdered sugar glaze and drizzled it over the top.  I ended up with a completely different cale, but it was great.  I'll make it again for sure.
