Very good, everyone loved it. Heres a neat little trick. Halve the recipe and put the cream cheese layer on the bottom of a ready made graham cracker crust, then set for 10 minutes in the freezer and then add the cranberry mixture layer and chill in fridge till firm. Makes an AWESOME PIE !!!!

I made this recipe for this past Thanksgiving, but I forgot to review it.  I doubled the recipe but instead of using two packages of cherry jello, I used one cherry and one cranberry.  Otherwise, I made it exactly according to the recipe.  It was the hit of the Thanksgiving dinner.  I didn't even think I liked whole cranberry sauce, but I've changed my mind after this recipe.  My family has had gelatin salads at every holiday meal my entire life, and we all think this is the best one.  My daughter asked me to make it for every holiday meal from now on.  Since she loved it so much I'm going to make it for her birthday this week.  I'll try making it lighter, using low-fat, sugar-free ingredients where possible.  I'll let you know how it turns out.  UPDATE:  We loved it just as much this time around.  In fact, my daughter has nicknamed it "edible paradise" and says she is addicted.  Again I used one package of cherry gelatin and one package of cranberry gelatin.  I also used fat-free cream cheese and sugar-free gelatin, and we couldn't really tell any difference in the taste.

I don't care for unsweetened cream cheese, so i added 2 teaspoons of Splenda to cream cheese.  Couldn't stop the family from eating every last drop!

I really liked this recipe and others enjoyed it too.  I used cranberry jello instead of cherry and I added a few drops of green food coloring to the cream cheese mixture to make it look more Christmasy. The only thing I did wrong was to leave the mold in the hot water too long.  Just about 2 seconds was sufficient to loosen it from the mold.

I took a previous reviewer's suggestion to another level when I made this last night.  Divided the recipe in half (except that I used an 8 oz. can of pineapple instead of 1/2 of a 20 oz. can) and put the 3 layers into an OREO chocolate pie crust.  If you like a tart dessert, this is it!!!  Serve each piece topped with Cool Whip or real whipped cream.  EXCELLENT!!!

I made this salad for Thanksgiving and everyone thought it was wonderful!  Two of the guests said it was their favorite part of the meal.  In the past I have been guilty of making reviewer-suggested changes to a recipe the first time I try it.  This time I did not, and I'm glad I didn't.  The recipe is perfect as is.  I would suggest you make this recipe according to the original instructions before trying the suggestions for changes.  I really did not think it was too sweet at all.  It's like I expect a gelatin salad to be.  If you make sure that the cream cheese is completely at room temperature and the gelatin is completely set, you will have no problem spreading the cream cheese.  Also, the pineapple juice that you add to the cream cheese gives it the perfect amount of sweetness--no need to add Splenda.  I have tried many different gelatin salad recipes, but I think this will be the only salad I make for future Thanksgivings.

Lot's of potential. I also found it way too sweet but it was good enough to make some notes to try again some time. This time I had a bag of cranberries leftover so I made whole cranberry sauce to add to the gelatin instead of the canned. I ended up adding a bit more of the juice to the cream cheese to make it a bit more spreadable and flavorful (total of about 1/2 c). I also used walnuts instead of peacans. Next time I will try one box of gelatin and half the crushed pineapple. One note.... it took a lot longer than 10 minutes for the first layer to firm up. Maybe that was because I used home made cranberry sauce, not sure, but it eventually firmed just fine. Thanks!

I made this today for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. What I liked best about it was it's something different. I followed the directions exactly and don't think I would change a thing. I put it an 8x8 clear square dish and it fit perfectly and looked nice.  I would point out the recipe doesn't say to let the first layer set for 10 minutes as some have said. It says let the first layer set, then spread the cream cheese mixture over that and refrigerate THAT for 10 minutes before putting the rest of the jello mixture on top.

I made homemade cranberry sauce instead of the canned stuff. This was really wonderful. Everyone loved it and asked for recipe. I also made a second batch using homemade cranberry sauce made with sugar twin sweetner and sugar free jello. It was actually better than the regular recipe. It was more tart and not nearly as sweet. Will definitly make both again!

Great with turkey and dressing.  I served it at Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  When I make it again I will add more cream cheese.

I made this for a Christmas party and it was a hit.  I left out the pecans for any people who may have a nut allergy.  Very tasty and very easy to make.  Will be on the list of things to make for next year.  Thanks for the recipe.

I made this salad for my annual church home group Thanksgiving potluck.  I think I may have found "my" dish that I will bring every year.  My mom said it was perfect.  But PERSONALLY I thought it was too sweet.  I realized it's because the basic directions on the gelatin box requires an additional cup of cold water, which in the recipe is not added but substituted by the cranberry sauce.  Since I am making 2 molds (for 35 people), NEXT TIME I will mix 3 boxes of gelatin and 4 cups of water to dilute it a bit.  I will also microwave my cranberry sauce first so it will break up a little easier, and leave everything else the same.

I really like this recipe.  It is a beautiful color and has a lovely, rich taste due to the cream cheese layer.  I will probably take the advice below and add a bit more juice to the filling, however, to make it more spreadable.  A real treat!

This recipe has gotten very good reviews, but I'm not sure why.  I had high expectations after reading the reviews, but when I made it I discovered that it is little more than glorified Jell-O.  If you like Jell-O you will like this salad, but if you want something a little more exciting than Jell-O - pick a different recipe!  I made this for a dinner party and it was the only item that I did not get compliments on and my husband and I were eating the leftovers for a week!

We loved this salad.  My girls ate it up.  It is also a very pretty dish.  It will surely be on my dinner table this Thanksgiving.

Made this for Thanksgiving. Everyone who ate it, said it was the best cranberry salad they'd had!! Used raspberry jello, rather than cherry. Will certainly make again! Thanks for sharing.

Be smart about this recipe, especially around the holidays.  Make with sugar-free jello, Miracle Whip, and Low fat or fat free cream cheese.  If you make it the way the recipe says, its nearly 400 calories a serving!

My family enjoyed it, but I was a little disappointed on how the cream cheese spread did not spread easily on top of the jello.  I had to just mix the jello with the cream cheese.

I made this for my thanksgiving guests and got RAVE reviews!  I'm not a cranberry salad person and I LOVED this.  The salt of the nuts w/ the sweet of the jello and the tartness of the whole cranberries made for a wonderful salad!  Will definately make again!  Thanks!

Served in a trifle dish.  Was really pretty and everyone liked it.  Husband wasn't crazy about cream cheese layer...may try it with whipped cream or I know a good marshmallow/sour cream layer that could work.

I loved this.  I was a little iffy about the nuts and the mayo, but I followed the directions and I'm glad I did.  We had this at a little cook-out and ate it by itself, but I'll definitely be making it for holidays too, to go with turkey.

Good stuff! Easy to throw together and very pretty. I used cranberry jello and it was SO good! I think if I make it again, I will cut back on the mayo...even with only 1 TBSP, you could definately taste it! Be sure to leave enough time for the bottom layer to firm up, it took hours for some reason! Ended up putting it in the freezer for a half hour so I could get that second layer on.

This recipe was so good!  The only thing I changed was to use a box of cherry jello and a box of raspberry instead of two cherries.  This was completely finished off at our Thanksgiving meal.  And that's saying something considering there was a TON of food with lots of choices.  I'll definitely be making this again all year round!

Yum!  Absolutely delicious.  The flavors play well with eachother - the sweet of the cranberry layer and the dry flavor of the cream cheese, well balanced.  I subbed pecans for walnuts. It took a long time for my cranberry layer to set, and it stayed rather soft, I think I'll have to drain the pineapple better next time.

We absolutely loved this salad. I will be making it again for Thanksgiving. I did pour just a little more pineapple juice into the cream cheese mixture, but not much. The cream cheese layer is alot easier to spread if it's at room temp, or even warmed up a bit in the microwave. This fit perfectly in an 7 x 11" glass pan. Would need to double recipe if you want it in a 9 x 13". It's so good, I'm sure it would get eaten if you doubled it!

I have made this for about 5 Thanksgivings now - people always want the recipe.  This year I made 2 changes that I liked better.  I used black cherry jello and thought it was much better than just regular cherry jello.  Also, I used fresh cranberries instead of canned - only added about 5-10 minutes prep time.  I just followed the recipe on the cranberry bag - 1 cup water/1 cup sugar & boiled.  This made it so much better in my opinion.  (But if you use canned, I recommend 2 cans, otherwise it tastes too much like cherry and not enough like cranberry.)  The only down side to this recipe is the wait time while chilling the first layer, but it is well worth it and is always a big hit!  Delicious!

A hit with my family members who "hate cranberries".  A shot of cool whip on the top seals the deal.

I made this for thanksgiving. I wanted something different other that cranberry sauce out of a can..lol and it turned out great! I used a 9x13 glass pan and made three 3 layers. But what I did different is I added 1 1/2cup of thawed frence vanilla whipped topping (because that is what I plenty of on hand for pies) to the cream cheese w/mayo & pecans. And only because I tasted just the cream cheese, mayo and pecans before hand, it was just a little tart for taste. But next time I make this I will also add maybe some mandarian oranges along with this. But great recipe and everyone's taste is different and it was a hit at my house of 30 people...gone quick! 
thanks!!!

This was very tasty!    But it yields a HUGE amount - it's like a double recipe and would fill two regular sized salad molds.  Unless I were bringing this dish to a very large banquet, for the typical up to 10 person family dinner next time I would definitely cut the recipe in half.

This was good, but I think it needed a thicker and sweeter cream cheese layer to appeal to kids.  Mine wouldn't touch it even though I thought it was yummy.

Even my 12-year-old niece who was expecting my standard "strawberry/pretzel salad" loved this one! The presentation is beautiful in a truffle bowl and was a standout on the Christmas buffet table.
I made it just as stated - no alterations - perfect !

This went over GREAT at our huge family get together.  I put in an extra can of cranberries and left the rest of the recipe just as is.

This was very good, made it in a jello mold and served on Thanksgiving, I don't usually eat Cranberry sauce (although I serve it) and this one changed my mind, it was delicious.  Other reviewers are right you need to have the cream cheese at room temp to spread. Was easy to prepare in advance and refridgerate until you use.

Only 2 out of 11 would try this at dinner despite the pretty appearance.  I don't think that many people are fond of cranberries.  It was quite sweet.

Made this in a trifle bown and it was beautiful!!  The cherry jello was just way too overwhelming for us in this!  I think this would be a 5 star recipe if it actually tasted like cranberry.  I'll be making this again...next time I'll use cranberry or raspberry jello though!

I love this salad if you can call it a salad.  It's a dessert to me and it is so refreshing and yummy.  I put it into a plastic mold and added green food coloring to the cream cheese mixture.  It made a nice Christmas presentation.

I found this cranberry salad DELICIOUS!  I am sure it would be great as written but I did add 1 can of drained chopped seedless sweet bing cherries to the jello mixture and deleted the nuts from the cream cheese mixture.  Will ceartinly make again.

This was a nice alternative to plain cranberries!  The only thing I did different was I used strawberry jello, no pecans & I added sliced bananas. I highly recomend adding the bananas. They make it even more interesting to look at + a nice flavor.  Also, make sure the cream cheese is room temperature or soften it in the microwave about 20-30 seconds.  It's easier to work with. This looked very elegant on the Thanksgiving table and will be apart of our holiday dinner for now on. Thanks Susan.

Made this for a Labor Day Picnic and it was a hit.  It wasn't terribly sweet and the color was festive next to the salads.  I used the smaller can of pineapple and it worked just fine.  Easy to make!

This is a great, delicious recipe.  I have made it three times since I first tasted it at a party in December (4 months ago) and everybody loves it.  I've served it to about 30 to 40 people and never found anyone who didn't enjoy this "desert."  And it's so simple and quick to make.

My family loves this receipe.  I did not make any changes.  It is simple and wonderful just as described.  It is now my  contribution to the annual Thanksgiving dinner.  Great when you want a sophisticated twist to cranberry sauce.

I was a little surprised at how this tasted.  IT is a beautiful side dish, put it in a clear container for everyone to see.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't taste as good as it looks.  The pecans to me seem out of place, I think it would have been better without it.  And it has a very strong, pineapple-like taste.  Persons liking traditional cranberry sauce probably should avoid as this is very different. Everybody jumped all over this because of the appearance, then didn't finish what they got.  Also it was very hard to spread the creamcheese/pecan mixture over the first layer of jello, came out very lumpy and uneven.  I may try again without the pecans.  Does look very festive though.

My family loved this recipe..I did use sugar free jello and a low fat cream cheese.  This would be nice with lime jellow as the top layer including the pineapple per instructions, but using 1/2 the cranberry in the bottom layer...red and green for Christmas or any time.

I ran across this recipe after making a very similar recipe for years - the topping used cool whip instead of more cream cheese and mayo. I like this topping better, but I still use a small package of Orange Jello, and a small package of Raspberry Jello instead of Cherry.  I also omit the pecans due to my child's nut allergy.  For those that might be unfamiliar with adding pineapple to jello, be sure to squeeze as much juice as possible out of the crushed pineapple or it might not set well.   If you don't have a Trifle Dish or Footed Bowl you can make this recipe in a 13x9 pan with the cream cheese layer on top.

This is the most AWESOME cranberry jello salad I have ever had!!  I have used the cherry Jello but have also used cranberry Jello.  I preferred the cranberry but you can't always find it at the grocery store.

We liked it a lot but would like it better without the  cream cheese mixture or the pecans next time. Good enough without all that added to it.
