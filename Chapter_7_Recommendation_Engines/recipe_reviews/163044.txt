This dish was DELICIOUS! Even my husband liked it! I did add a few things...about 1 TBS of lemon juice and 1/4 cup of pine nuts toasted. I used minced garlic (1 heaping TBS) because I didn't have any fresh. I cooked the quinoa in 2 cups of chicken broth instead of water. (not 3! Quinoa is cooked like rice, 1 part quinoa 2 parts liquid) This was my whole dinner, my husband had it as a side dish to steak. This was incredible and my new favorite way to make quinoa!

both my husband and i love the flavors of this dish. as the recipe states, you can use almost any vegetable that you have on hand. i used garlic, red onion, fresh corn cut from the cob, red bell pepper and celery. i also used red quinoa which, i think, takes more time to cook than white quinoa. awesome recipe!

Finally! A way I enjoy quinoa.  This recipe rocks...the cumin & oregano give it just a little more flavor. And straining made the texture so much better...it also makes it moldable so you can play around with serving it aesthetically (e.g. use a measuring cup, pack it, then turn it upside down on the plate).  I'll make this again for sure!

So healthy and delicious.  Added green onion, cherry tomatoes, frozen corn, can of drained rinsed black beans, fresh baby spinach, made a dressing of 1/4c olive oil, cumin, chili powder, salt and cracked pepper and the juice of 2 limes and 2 cloves of minced garlic. Also cooked my quinoa in chicken broth.  So good! Thanks!

Great recipe you can change up. I cooked my quinoa with half veggie broth, half water and 2 cut up carrots (so they would soften). For my veggies I used garlic, bell pepper, kale, zucchini, and cauliflower. I added a little more cumin and a little garlic powder and it came out wonderful. My carnivorous boyfriend topped his with marinara sauce and said it was the best veggie meal I've made to date. Really easy, really versatile, really delicious. Play around with it, you can pretty much add anything!

This is my very first time trying quinoa, not even sure how its pronounced. I really loved it and this dish is awesome, quite simple and i used red bell peppers, broccoli, onions, celery, carrots, and garlic. Its a simple dish, nothing too special but since I have never had quinoa I will give it a 5 because it tasted good all together.

Really tasty.  I made it with carrots, broccoli, and snow peas, cause that is what's in season right now where I live.  Benefits from extra S&P.

This was my first time making quinoa. This is a great basic dish, which you can add whatever you want. I added leftover veggies -- onion, green bell pepper, carrots and asparagus. I also topped it with fresh chopped tomatoes, feta cheese and avocado. It was wonderful. I used my bag directions for cooking the quinoa though.

this was my first attempt at making quinoa.  i really enjoyed it.  found i had to taste the quinoa as it cooked as i haven't the experience; it takes longer than 20 mins to cook.  i used vegetable stock instead of water to add more flavour. i love recipes with cumin and this one turned out really well.  was a big hit in my house.  served with tilapia.

Awesome recipe! Wow! I have only tried Keen-Wah a few times but have never made it. I used 2 cups veg broth instead of water (and yes, it's a 2:1 ratio just like rice) which gave great flavor. Sauteed up carrot, celery, eggplant, green pepper, onion, garlic and some frozen corn kernals. Healthy way to use up all the left over veggies in the fridge. Will  be making it frequently!

Simple and delicious.  I cooked the quinoa in 2 cups broth instead of 3 cups water, added more garlic, no salt, and lots of green and red peppers, green onions, and carrots (cut really small so they'd cook quickly).  Really fresh tasting and surprisingly filling.  I love that you can throw in pretty much any veggie.  I will be making this recipe weekly.  Makes me want to go vegan.

This was my first attempt at quinoa, and I have to say it was pretty good!  I did, however, follow the package instructions for cooking the quinoa, which said to use 2 cups of water to 1 cup of quinoa and simmer until the quinoa had absorbed all the liquid.  Boiling it in an extra cup of liquid and then draining just didn't make any sense to me when I could just cook it like rice, hence the reason I gave the recipe only four stars.  I also added some Better than Bouillon chicken base for a little added flavor, and had to play around a bit with the veggies as I didn't have red bell pepper or green onions on hand.  In the end, I wound up using canned corn, and fresh tomatoes, chives, and carrots from our garden that needed to be used up.  Threw in some basil and thyme instead of oregano when I couldn't find it in my spice cabinet, but kept the rest of the spices the same.  Yum!  So good!  And honestly, I think the cumin and garlic made this dish!  This will definitely be a repeat in my kitchen!  Thanks for giving me a starting point to use up what I had on hand!  A great first experience with quinoa!

Very delicious....I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I added lemon juice to the olive oil when sauteing the veggies. The veggies i used were garlic, onion, carrots, mushrooms and peas. I added a little feta at the end. A huge hit in this house!!!!

Great recipe. Made a few changes. I didn't use salt. I used 2 cups of low sodium chicken broth instead of water. Instead of 3 tablespoons of olive oil I used 1 tablespoon. I love garlic so I used 5 cloves. I added brocolli, yellow squash, red, green and yellow bell pepper. Since I had left overs I will use it with Chinese instead of brown rice.

This was my first attempt at quinoa.  It got rave reviews at the family Easter gathering.  I thought it was good, but I may need to fully develop my taste for this grain.  I cooked mine in onion broth according to package directions.  I included celery with the cooked vegetables and I mixed in halved grape tomatoes and green onions prior to serving.  I thought it needed a little more salt than the recipe called for.

Wonderful dish!  Easily made with any veggies you have on hand.  I used snap peas, carrots, green onion, frozen corn, green and orange bell peppers, and substituted two cups of chicken broth instead of water.  It is definitely 1 cup quinoa to 2 cups liquid!  Needs a bit more herbs and spices and salt, otherwise it can be a little bland.  Don't overcook the quinoa!  Keep an eye on it at the 18 minute mark and cook until al dente and the white germ is showing.

I think I "a bit over-did-it" with the vegetables... I added graped tomatoes and used baby corn in place of the caned corn I added purple onion to add some color. Love the taste!

Very good! My first time to fix quinoa and I loved it. I realized a little too late that I didn't have any oregano but used some basil instead and it was still delicious! Very easy to make too.

This was my first time cooking quinoa.  The recipe was delicious.  I forgot to set the timer for the quinoa but basically cooked it until the liquid was absorbed.  I didn't need to strain it at all.  It was a bit heavier than I had expected it would be, I thought it would be more like couscous, but perhaps I cooked it too long.   My dad even liked it and he's not big on trying new things.  I will make this again.  It's a winner.

This was very good.  I used the package instructions for cooking the quinoa.  For vegetables I used green onions, broccoli, cauliflower, green beans and white mushrooms.  I stir fried the vegetables in my wok.  Myself, my two younger kids (7 & 9) and my husband loved this.  Only my 12 year old daughter didn't like this.  She ate the vegetables but not the quinoa.

So yummy and fresh, AND healthy :)  I cooked my quinoa in half chicken broth and half water.  Used zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, and broccoli.  Squeezed some lemon juice in addition to the spices.  I also added toasted pine nuts and goat cheese (but it still would have been great without these).  So yummy!  Thanks :)

Delicious! I added a can of diced tomatoes to the quinoa (just 2 c. water) and about 1/2 cup frozen spinach to the garlic & corn saute. I then mixed everything together, stuffed it inside some bell peppers, baked for 30 minutes @ 400, and topped the peppers with shredded pepper jack cheese just before serving. Very tasty, and very filling.

Great dish! Instead of 3 cups of water, I used 2 cups of chicken broth. I also like a bit more spice and added 2 chopped jalepeno peppers and an extra garlic clove.

This was my first time making Quinoa, I used 2 parts water 1 part quinoa after reading some of the reviews and it turned out great, no straining necessary; I added shredded carrot to the peppers & corn and then also added some sugar snap peas when I added the green onions. This is definitely a keeper! So GOOD!!!

Excellent recipe! I had a box of Quinoa sitting in my pantry for months and decided to try it today on a whim.  I followed the main directions closely (but used 2 cups of veggie stock, not 3 cups of water).  The veggies that I picked were green peas, corn, steamed asparagus (leftovers from a previous meal) and garlic.  I added the cumin and oregano as well (though a lot more of both, per my tastes).  I was shocked at how good this was.  I think that cooking it in stock gave the quinoa a delicious flavor. Thank you!!

It was ok, next time I'll add more seasoning because we thought it was a little bland. My 2 year old loved it though!

Great! Tasty and easy. This is one of those recipes you can play with. We didn't have regular corn on hand, so we used baby corn. Also added mushrooms, sesame seeds, red pepper flakes.  And used chicken broth (2 cups) to cook the quinoa.

This idea gets 5 stars from me. I used zucchini,red bell,and peas they were a perfect match. I also used Garam Masala spice instead of just Cumin.I was reaching for my Cumin when I saw the Masala it has Cumin in it and I thought what the hay. It was very very good. If I hadn't seen this recipe and the poster hadn't pointed out other vegetables that would work just as deliciously my Quinoa would still be sitting on my shelf unused and unappreciated. So for the inspiration this recipe gave me I give it 5 stars.

This is a good basic recipe for "Keen-wah".  I have been making quinoa for quite some time and find it to be very healthy.  This recipe is going to be a keeper for me.

I used leftover steamed broccoli in place of the pepper, because that's all I had. I served this mixture in taco shells and topped with the vegan lime crema sauce from Veganomicon. Deeeelicious!!

Great basic quinoa recipe!  The instructions on the bag of pre-washed quinoa from Eden Foods says to use 1 1/4 cup of water to 1 cup quinoa and cook for 12 minutes.  I use about 1 and a half cups of chicken stock and cook about 15 minutes.  I don't understand the reason for using 3 cups and then draining away flavor and nutrients.  Otherwise, I would give 5 stars.

I loved this! Even my non-heath food eating husband loved this.... which is kinda too bad because I ate most of it on my own. I liked this warmed up and made mine with half water half chicken stock and added  peas, carrots, and corn as my veggies. I'm so glad I found this recipe and can't wait to try new veggies and maybe some diced chicken and shrimp!

This recipe is good, but does end up pretty bland. I added a sprinkling of freshly grated Parmesan and it gave it that edge of flavour that it needed to really be a satisfying meal. Also added some leftover mixed frozen veggies (carrot/lima bean/peas/green beans)cherry tomatoes and substituted coriander for the cumin. Also finely chopped a little bit of onion and added with the other veggies, as I didn't have any green onions.

Didn't take too much prep and was ready in just over 30 minutes (I had an issue with my bell pepper, so was a bit delayed) which is a huge pro for a mom of 2 who doesn't have a lot of cooking experience!

My 2 year old loves it and my picky husband is eating it! Very pleased and will be making this again!

This was my first experience with Quinoa. I also added peas, carrots, water chestnuts and some feta cheese. I am not a fan of oregano and it was over powering so I added soy sauce. Really yummy. Next time I will double the veggies. Thanks for sharing.

Very good. I think a little hot sauce makes this taste great, and if you want it as a burrito filling, add some cheese and fill a tortilla.

Needs waaaaay more salt. I am known for not adding much salt to anything except what is called for in a recipe, but this needed about a teaspoon of garlic salt on top of the "pinch" it calls for. Once, I added the garlic salt, it was really good. I would even thing about adding more vegetables next time like squash.

This recipe is awesome! I am a vegetarian and added garbanzo beans to add even more protein. Edamame is also a thought.  I was very skeptical over the cumin and oregano combination but went for it anyway and I am so glad that I did. My skepticism was probably due to my lack of experience with cooking but I will make this again and again.

Very nice quinoa side dish.  We had this with a pork tenderloin, but it would go great with chicken as well.  This would also work great with a variety of different vegetables.  Just throw in whatever you have.

This was a delicious and very easy to follow recipe. As others have mentioned, quinoa is made in a 1 part quinoa to 2 parts water ratio, so 2 cups of water should be used, not 3. I didn't have any fresh garlic on hand so I used 1 TBS (I may use more next time). We used corn, zucchini, and sweet onion and it was delicious! A very easy and tasty side dish.

I changed this up a little.  I used zuchinni, carrots, onion, and green bell peppers and seasoned it with a no salt 21 spice seasoning and garlic salt. to top it off I added feta cheese. It was good without the feta but the feta made it GREAT!!!!

It's a little bland. Make sure to add lots of vegetables, and 2 cups water for every 1 cup of quinoa. Adding lemon juice also adds a bit of flavour.

This recipe was great and versatile. You can use any combination of veggies and the seasonings were wonderful. I prefer the recipe warm, but it is good cold too!

Great recipe!  I added all the left over veggies in the frig and a pinch of red pepper flakes!  BTW quinoa is pronounced "keen-wa".  Thanks for the recipe!

Great recipe someone who has never made quinoa...it was wonderful and easy.  Very easy - I added broccoli, yellow pepper, green beans, and carrots.  I stemmed the green beans, carrots and broccoli before I sautéed it. That's what I had on hand!  This was awesome - next time I am going to put pasta sauce on it!

Sautéed all vegetables together, then added quinoa & only 2 cups of vegetable broth. Brought to boil then reduced heat to cook for about 20 minutes. Used stated ingredients except onions. Will make again using different vegetables, reminded me of a pilaf.

I am trying to learn to like quinoa, and this dish definitely brought me a littler closer!  I used frozen peas & carrots in place of the corn (personal preference) and added a can of black beans as recommended by previous reviews.  Very important to note that the flavor was much better after a couple of days of the flavors melding in the frig.  When I reheated it I melted some shredded sharp cheddar cheese on top and it was downright yummy!  Kids still aren't crazy about it, they think it might be better with some meat added.

I liked this recipe but I did make a couple changes. First of all, rinse the quinoa well with cold water before cooking. I cooked the quinoa as directed on the package (2c liquid per 1c quinoa) which is a cup less than the recipe states. I used beef broth instead of water. I will be trying vegetable broth and chicken broth in the future as well. By using less liquid there is no need to drain it after cooking. I used a can of garden vegetable medley (corn, green beans, carrots) instead of half a cup of corn. I didn't have garlic so I used two green onions (green part included) instead. I put them in with the peppers after they had softened up some. I didn't put salt or pepper in it because the broth is salty enough and pepper can be put on according to each persons own taste preference. I'll make it again using different liquids and veggies. It's quite tasty!

This was a fine side dish.  My 1 year old loved it which makes me a happy mama.  The cumin gave the quinoa a wonderful aroma, but the taste was lacking a bit so I'll pump it up with some spices next time.

Divine!  I roasted some sweet potatoes, acorn squash, carrots, and onions instead of the veggies listed in this recipe.  Once these babies were roasted to my liking, I sautéd 2 garlic cloves in some olive oil for about 2 minutes... then, I added about a 1/2 of a head of kale, coating the kale in the olive/garlic oil in the frying pan.  The kale softens up a little fast (be careful to not over cook the kale!).  Once the kale, quinoa and the roasted veggies were all done to perfection, I layered the ingredients in a serving bowl and Wham!... Amazing!!!!  Will definitely make it again!

Also read another reviewer's comment about adding some veggie broth in the quinoa water for a little flavor.    This dish has tons of flavor so beware... make extra!!!!

THIS DISH WAS HEAVEN!
My wife wanted me to a-d-d a couple things to it, so I did, and with them added, I have to admit, this RECIPE was the best thing ever!
First, instead of Quinoa I made this with Cous Cous! It had great bite to it and tasted A-O-K!
Instead of Veggies I cut up Portuguese sausage and corn niblets, frozen instead of from a can WHICH WORKED okay. And the corn was also from a can.
Perfect for company!

Edible, but not something I will make again. For my taste buds, there are better quinoa recipes on here. I cut the oil down to 2 tablespoons & think using the full amount would be really greasy.

This was great!  I used chicken broth instead of water while cooking the quinoa.  It's only the second time I've had quinoa so I don't have much to compare it to but it was waaay more tasty than the other dish.  I'll definitely make this again, my girlfriend also loved it.

super easy and yummy! After reading others reviews I think I will try cooking it in broth instead of water next time. I also used the leftovers to make turkey quinoa meatloaf, also from this site. It's great when a recipe can do double duty!!

Love love this recipe... we sautéed in butter the veggies.  Our selections were....onions, yellow peppers, zucchini squash and peas.  We use chicken broth (2 cups) no water.  Didn't have to drain.  Cumin is the spice that really makes this go from good to spectacular. I put in 1 teaspoon. Hubby not a quinoa fan thinks it is too bland, but loves this recipe.  Asks for this instead of the fancy multi-grain rice I cook.  Yummy!

This was my 2nd experience with quinoa and really enjoyed it.   I browned some chopped onion with the4 garlic, added celery, red pepper and broccoli.  I sprinkled on feta cheese right before eating and wow...what a great vegetarian meal! Oh, I took someone elses suggestgion and cooked the quinoa in 2 cups of chicken bouillon.  3 cups of water would have been too much liquid.

Quinoa is one of my favorite side dishes. You can add any vegetables you feel compliment the main course. I did toast the quinoa in a pan first. I feel it gives the quinoa a nuttier flavor.

I used red peppers and corn and it turned out awesome!  Served with grilled chicken!  Yummy!!  We haven't been that impressed with quinoa, but we will be serving it like this again.

This was my first time making quinoa and this recipe was delish. I followed the recipe exactly, except I cooked the quinoa in chicken broth. I used zucchini, red pepper, corn and red onion, plus a little more oregano. I mixed the left overs with some feta, chopped tomato and baby spinach and put it in a pita for lunch. Yummy.

Very yummy. I used a frozen pepper onion blend and frozen corn and added some curry to the seasoning. Also added about 10 almonds which I chopped and boiled for a few minutes before adding. I was going to just chop them and put them in to cook with the quinoa but I forgot so I added later. I will definitely be making this again!

Loved this recipe also. I made it for my son & a friend who were on a long circuitous sea kayaking expedition & I wanted something hardy & nutritious for one of their food drops. I doubled the quinoa (& boiled it with a veggie cube for added flavor). I added 2 cut up chicken breasts to the onion & garlic & then broccoli, asparagus, green, red & orange peppers & celery.  I did add all the previous recipe's seasonings & thenBraggs Soya Sauce for a kick...fantastic taste & so hardy:) This will become a staple for me....without the chicken:)

This recipe was good, but it lacked a little in flavor. If I made it again, I think I would replace some of the water with chicken broth.

I threw this together with some onions, cucumbers, garlic and habanero peppers.  WOW, I was totally addicted to it!  My husband and I gobbled it down even through the slow burn of the habaneros.  We are spicy food people so some may want to leave out the habaneros....I used four when I made it.

This was fantastic.  I had never tried quinoa before and had been looking for a recipe that sounded good.  I used broccoli, because I didn't have any corn and it was delicious.  I will definitely make this again!

We made a double batch of these because it didn't seem like one batch could serve four people. It was pretty tasty. We made half the quinoa with vegetable stock and half with water, and added garlic, zucchini and red onion. There was just enough for my husband and myself, plus leftovers for work the next day. We'll make it again, and switch up the veggies too!

This is fantastic! My entire family enjoys this as a side or main dish. This is not something that happens often. I use vegetable broth or chicken broth instead of water to give a bit more flavor, but that's just personal preference. May be just as tasty without that step.

This was my first time cooking Quinoa. My family found it fairly bland. But I plan on making it again. So next time I will try cooking it with chicken or other broth to add some flavor, or adding soy sauce. I added lots of extra vegetables to make it a combo dish of grain and lots of vegetables. I added fresh corn cut off the cob, mushrooms, broccoli, and red peppers.

I used 4 cloves crushed garlic, added a diced jalapeño and string beans.  The flavouring with the cumin and oregano is perfect.

This was my first time ever cooking quinoa and this recipe was a great place to start - very simple and straightforward! I added red onion, which I enjoyed. I'm looking forward to making this recipe again and possibly adding tofu and a few other items. :)

This was so awesome. My husband and I have never had Quinoa before and I had just picked up a pkg to try. Didn't even know how to cook it. I followed the recipe to a "T" with two exceptions.  I used a reviewers tip and just used 2 cups of liquid vs 3 and I also used chicken broth instead of water.  It came out perfectly!  We will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks so much for sharing!!!

It wa delicious! I used a little yellow onion because I didnt have green onion or bell peppers. I used an entire can of corn and added chopped up avocado after serving. My teenage daughter liked it, too. I will definitely make it again, next time with green onion and bell peppers. But I am keeping the extra corn and avocado!

My family really enjoyed this recipe.  I also used 2 cups of water instead of 3.  I did not put corn because I did not have any but still tasted good.  I put 1 packet of chicken bouillon to the water while it was boiling.

Family really like this! The 5 year old said it wasn't his favorite but he still ate it while the 3 year old had two helpings of it! Made it a side with some chicken thighs and added corn, peas and carrots to it. Cooked the quinoa in chicken broth (2 cups.) The possibilities are endless with this recipe and looking forward to trying other varieties! Thanks!

Very basic recipe to add flavors to your quinoa. The only thing I did differently was to sauté my green onion with the garlic. Very nutritious.

I love quinoa, because it's so much healthier than rice and this was a nice recipe especially because you can add whatever veggies you like. Next time i would use less oregano, i didn't love in the dish but that's just personal preference. To those pointing out that the cooking ratio is 2 cups of water per cup of quinoa, that's right, however this recipe uses a different metod where you use more water than needed and just drain it when it reaches your desired doneness (like cooking pasta). I have done rice this way, just adding way more water than needed (no measurement) and then draining it when it was done and it's actually very good if you have trouble making rice. If you don't like this method just stick to the normal liquid/ quinoa ratio :)

Very good, basic quinoa recipe. I used 2 1/4 cups water (one of those I used veg. broth) as the package recommends. Simmering for 20 minutes was perfect. I loved the idea of cooking the carrot in the water. It was soft after 10 minutes. I find stir frying the carrots they never get soft. I added chopped sugar snap peas, chopped red onion and everything else as the recipe called for. Very colorful, very tasty.

I'm not crazy about quinoa. I was looking for a little more flavor than I had found in other recipes. This was amazing! Didn't have red peppers so I subbed green ones. Didn't have green onions so I added about a Tbs of yellow onion. Will definitely make again.

This was my first run at quinoa.  I discovered that quinoa takes on the flavour around it, on it's own it tastes like socks.  I followed the recipe but did add to it, couple pinches of dried onion powder, half tsp or more dried garlic powder, bit of extra salt...and you know what?  It's rather nice.

Loved it!  I made this recipe with 2 cups of vegetable broth as many commented 3 cups of water was too much.  It also matched the package directions.  I used red quinoa.  It tasted great hot.  I cooled it overnight and added crumbled feta cheese and grape tomatoes to make a cold side dish for a party.  It was very tasty and everyone seemed to like it.  I will definitely make it again!

It was extremely bland, even with using chicken broth instead of water for the quinoa.

Excellent! Finally a healthy recipe that my family eats without complaining that it's "healthy"! A great way to sneak in the "dreadful" greens!

I've never had quinoa before but gave this a shot. I cooked it in 2 cups chicken broth, one cup water. I sauted the garlic, added tri colored peppers, a little green pepper, broccoli, frozen green peas, and frozen corn. I also added some butter to the olive oil for flavor, the cumin, and the oregano and a touch of crushed red pepper. I served it with chopped green onions.

Both hubby and I thought it was too bland. I added walnuts and sunflower seeds to mine, he added raspberry walnut vinaigrette dressing to his. His was delicious, mine was OK.

I gave it three stars cause of it being bland. I'll try it again, but adjust the seasoning. Maybe my spices are to old.

I used this as a base, but used chicken broth for part of the water and for veges I used carrots, zucchini, corn and some kale.  Yum!

This dish was very tasty. I doubled it up for a group of 8 and added extra cumin and orgegano. I also added some frozen beans and added them at the same time as the frozen corn and red peppers. Everyone loved it.

I made this for a quick lunch for my mother-in-law Everyone loved it, even my mother-in-law who is not an adventurous eater.  I did make some changes though.  I used up some homemade chicken broth instead of straight water, sauteed onion and garlic before adding the corn which was leftover from the farmer's market.  I forgot to add the cumin but it was good without it.  I did squeeze a little bit of lemon over it all at the end with a final drizzle of olive oil.  Yum.

This wasn't bad. I found it quite bland though, which is surprising for me as I generally like my food to be bland. I will make again, but will probably experiment for more flavor.

We have used quinoa for years due to dietary considerations. Our recipes often combine it with barley, rice or Cavena Nuda. 
This is a new, (to us) delicious idea which would easily adapt to Asian stir fry’s. Using the basic concept, we added Cajun spice mix, tomatoes and okra. Yum!
Thanks for the post!

A friend of mine made this for a recent picnic.  The only thing she did different was to add lime juice.  Wonderful dish!

I made this with chicken broth and used the exact veggies listed here - I loved it!  I have been wanting to try quinoa and this was a great introduction to it.  My kids loved it as well.

My husband and I both loved this dish.  I was out of cumin so I added a little taco seasoning with the oregano and I used chicken broth instead of water but this was a delicious meal and I will definitely make it again and try adding some other veggies and or beans.

I forgot the Oregano the first time I tried the recipe - added it the second time and decided I like it better without.  Its really just a matter of taste.  Quick, simple, versatile recipe.  And it tastes great!

This is a good basic recipe for quinoa.  The cumin gives the dish a nice depth.  It is so easy to change the vegetables, we have made this with fresh peas and also with chaterelles.  Delicious and healthy.
