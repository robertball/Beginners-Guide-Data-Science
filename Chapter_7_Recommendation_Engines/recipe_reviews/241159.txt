I make this with a few adjustments as it for only one. I cut the amount of Avacaodo and egg in half. Omit the tomatoes and use  medium salsa.  Chop Avacaodo first  and squeeze lime over it and stir to keep it from turning dark.,add egg and the rest of the ingredients  , cut back on mayo. I didn't  use the sour creme every time I make it. Adjust to personal taste. Don't get it to wet. I put it on toast for a high protein breakfast.

I made the salad, skipping the spicy ingredients because of my taste preferences. I really liked it. Typically, I would categorize egg salad as a main dish, but adding the avocado made it more of a dip. I served it to my husband (a creature of habit) on toast and he only like it so-so. However, my daughter and I ate it on crackers (Wheat thins to be specific, and later saltines), and we loved it. I usually use a whole lot more mayonnaise in egg salad, but the avocado reduced the need. It's a hit that I'm bringing to my next family barbeque as a dip. For me, the added benefit is that it's vegetarian, so works very well for my vegetarian family members.

Substituted plain non-fat yogurt for sour cream and cooked onion first as I don’t care for raw onions. Yogurt adds a little tang to it. Loved it even though I am just now starting to eat avocados

Very creamy indeed. I think the sour cream and/or the mayo can be reduced by half and it would still be just fine.

This was very good. I think I'll cut back on the sour cream and mayo next time but as it was my family enjoyed it. Thank you Tracy918 for your recipe.

A simple recipe that packs big flavor. I did add more hot sauce to my liking.

Super yummy! I added a little more mayo then the recipe called for and I wish I didn’t. I plan on adding corn, celery or nut next time for a bit of crunch! Super yummy. Thanks!!

I liked it!  Used Miracle Whip instead of mayo.  Will add a little more lemon juice and salt next time.  I like the suggestion I read I about using Salsa instead of the tomatoes and the hot sauce.  Had it on toast ... good healthy breakfast.

Excellent!  This is one of the best egg salad variations I've ever made. Great as written (I did add more hot sauce), but would make a base for just about any other variant You could come up with.

Will definitely make this again. I finished the leftovers for lunch the next day on a bed of fresh baby spinach leaves.  It made an awesome salad!

I thought this would be good but I was wrong. It's TERRIFIC!  I was out of sour cream so I used a tablespoon of ranch dressing instead.  Next time I will add some chopped bacon and maybe a pinch of cayenne pepper.

I LOVED this! So creamy and delicious, which a nice kick. A few substitutions since I didn't have some items. I didn't have sour cream and just added a 1/2 tbsp more of mayo. I used miracle whip instead of mayo. Used lime instead of lemon, and added more hot sauce and garlic salt. YUM! I wonder if sweet corn would be good to add to my version since its kinda a southwestern egg salad :)

It was a great change for egg salad, omitted the sour cream.
