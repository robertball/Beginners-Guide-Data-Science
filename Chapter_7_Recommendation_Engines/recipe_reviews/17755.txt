Very, very good!  I made two changes to the recipe: I added 1/4 cup of milk, and about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips.  I baked them for 25 minutes and they were perfect - moist and chewy in the middle with a slight crunch at the edges.  Definitely something I'll do again!

Yuck!  My fiance and I did not like these.  I guess we aren't German chocolate fans.  I used this recipe to use up a Duncan Hines German Chocolate Cake mix.  It took about 25 minutes for the brownies to cook.  I will not be making these again and will stick to the brownie mix for now.

After reading other comments,  I added 1 cup sour cream and after sreading the mix in the pan I pressed 1/2 cup choc chips into the top of the batter.  cooked 25 min and were perfect.  Don't expect a real dense bar, but very good with or without the traditional coconut-pecan frosting.

I've been looking for a way to make easy brownies from cake mix, since all of the brownie mixes have hydrogenated oils.  Sure enough, this recipe w/ Devil's Food cake mix was excellent!  (I substituted walnuts for chocolate chips and used egg whites instead of eggs.)  YUM!

This was just fair.  It wasn't brownie-like at all; just like thin cake. We wanted to make brownie fudge sundaes but didn't have the ingredients for scratch brownies or a mix.  I used a chocolate cake mix instead of the german chocolate that was called for.  The kids liked them.  My husband and I thought they were just passable.  I won't make them again.

I made this recipe using a super moist yellow cake mix and chocolate chips in place of nuts. A definite keeper.

i will save this recipe as a base recipe but there was not enough liquid in the recipe-it was too thick like tar-the second time i tried this I added a 1/2 cup water and this seemed to do the trick.  Thanks for the brownie recipe.  It's nice to have cake mix recipes that are quick and easy for last minute events.

I tried this recipe to send to my daughter's class at school after discovering that she had used the last box of brownie mix form the pantry.  I was not pleased and did not want to send them to the school.  They were quite dry and didn't have the "brownie taste".  I ended up buying store made brownies to take to her class.  Next time I will run out for brownie mix or try one of the from scratch recipes.

The first batch I made was eaten very quickly. You can use any kind of chocolate cake mix. They are moist and good. My kids liked them. It is easy and handy if you don't have a brownie mix at home. So, they do not suck!

This is a very easy recipe to make.  I thought that these brownies tasted good because they have that light, bittersweet chocolate flavor instead of the very sweet fudgey chocolate flavor.  My boyfriend who is not a chocoholic really liked them

I would definitely not call these brownies. This was more like a very thin chocolate cake without frosting. Not very good and plain.

This was foolproof, as described, but not very tasty. In a pinch I'd consider using it again. I used Betty Crocker Super Moist Devil's Food mix.

These were VERY good brownies! My 11 yo daughter made them with about 3 minutes of prep time.  We did bake them in a smaller pan than recommended - a 7 x 10 or so, and they took about 27 minutes to bake.  My daughter used 1 cup chocolate chips instead of the 1/2 cup nuts - they tasted just like "boxed" brownies! (We used a deep chocolate cake mix)  A great snack in a pinch!

This recipe sucks. They take longer to cook than the recipe says. By the time the middle is done, the sides are dark.Don't waste your time with this one.Buy a packaged mix. You'd be better off. YUCK!!!!!!

Works great in a pinch. I used a Duncan Hines Decadent German Chocolate cake mix to make this, because I had one on hand.  After mixing the first three things, I put in the cake mix and the pecan/coconut mix. It was so dry that I had to add 1/2 cup of water, and then about 1/3 of milk too just to get it to a consistency that I could get it out of the bowl and into the pan. They came out of the oven more cake like than brownie like, but after I dusted them with powdered sugar they looked great. They went fast at the church dinner today and my nephew said he ate three and loved them. I prefer a homemade German Chocolate cake, which is so fattening I only make one at Christmas, so I wasn't crazy about these brownies.

Although they took 25 minutes to bake, this was a great recipe for tasty but not too sweet brownies that can be put together quickly with minimal ingredients.

I used spice-cake mix for a seasonal brownie and they tasted great. BUT the mix‘s net weigh was only ~15 ounces, not 18 ounces listed in the recipe. The brownies were moist and dense, but not a good brownie consistency. Not sure if the solution is one less egg or a bit less oil.

This went together very easily. I used a Swiss chocolate cake mix, mixed it in 2 parts, halfway through I added 3/4 cup of peanut butter then mixed in the last of the cake mix. They came out moist and chewy. It's a keeper.

I didn't like them.  Too dry, too cake like and not chocolaty enough.  I used German chocolate cake, chocolate chips and butter instead of oil.  I will not use this recipe again.

I made a double batch for my daughter's pool party. Instead of nuts, we used M&M's! I also added the extra milk recommended by another review ( 1/4 cup per package) and they came out moist and fudgy. I used the Dunkin Hines fudge cake mix not the German chocolate cake mix either. I would use this again if I didn't have cocoa or a brownie mix. In a metal 9x13 pan, they took 20 mins at 350.

It baked up nice, but is more cake like than brownie like. So 3 for recipe as a brownie; 4.5 for a chocolate cake. I used a Devils food cake mix and added 1/4 cup greek yogart because it sounded a bit dry.  Then when mixing it looked a little light in color, so I added 2 Tablespoons Dark Cocoa Powder. Then added 1/4 cup Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips.  We like Chocolate!
