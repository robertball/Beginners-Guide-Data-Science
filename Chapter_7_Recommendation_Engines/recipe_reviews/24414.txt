What attracted me first to the recipe was the lack of cream.  It is quick, simple, elegant, and very tasty.  My husband loved the recipe, and I plan to pass this one onto my mother-in-law.  I served each heaping bowl with a few exgra crumbles of the cheese on top as garnish.

Fantastic and simple.  You really have to be a fan of blue cheese to like this.  I added a minced clove of garlic about 30 seconds before adding the vegetables.  Don't forget to season with salt and pepper.  When adding the cheese, I added a dash of red pepper flakes to give it a little bite.  It was perfect.  Must have some chewy, crusty bread to dip with.  Fantastic!  Thanks.

YUM! YUM! YUM!  I have been pining for 9 years for the soup I fell in love with while studying abroad in Cambridge, England, so I was so shocked and happy to find a broccoli & stilton soup recipe here.  When I started making it, I was worried that I had built it up too much in my head, and I didn't want to be disappointed.

I WASN'T!

This is a great recipe.  I made it exactly as stated, but I think maybe the potatoes I used were a little big, because it came out a bit thick.  I just added another cup of broth, and it was awesome.  I served it with french bread and butter.  Simple and perfect!  This recipe didn't even need extra salt & pepper.

My husband went nuts when he tasted this! He can't stop eating it. I added garlic and an extra can of chicken broth because it was very thick. I also added extra stilton---just because I love it.
I am going to make this for my gourmet New Years Eve dinner I am making for friends.

I thought this soup was great.  I love blue cheese (and HATE broccoli), and I had some broccoli in the fridge to use up, so I thought I'd try it out.  I added some celery, garlic, and cauliflower, and seasoned with white and black pepper.  It was fantastic.  My husband liked it too.  I'll definitely make this again!  Did I mention that I hate broccoli?

I fell in love with this soup when I went home to England to visit family and have been searching for my own recipe since.  I added another cup of chicken stock and halved the cheese, it was perfect.

This is a hearty vegetable soup that is also tasty thanks to the excellent blue cheese. It can be slightly bland if your eating it as an entree though. Adding a  whole red bell pepper (makes it a little sweeter and more colorful) and a tablespoon finely chopped garlic with the veggies, and the red pepper flakes will give it that extra bite. I have also been known to add an ounce or two more stilton than the original recipe calls for. I even substituted vege broth for the chicken broth and made it for my vegetarian friends, though you have to add a bit of salt and pepper to make up for the difference. Overall a great recipe and a great soup!

First time we have ever tried using Stilton cheese and we just didn't like it at all.  The flavor was off and wasn't what we expected.  Yuck!

This was a nice warm soup on a cold and rainy Saturday.  This soup is low in calories as it does not contain any cream - it uses chicken stock instead.  When the soup was done cooling a bit I used my immersion blender because I wanted some chunks left in the soup.  I couldn't find stilton cheese so I used bleu cheese in mine and feta cheese in my husbands.  We both enjoyed the soup.  A great way to use up a bunch of broccoli.  Thanks for sharing.

I hate giving bad reviews...but this needs one. I love stilton cheese and this sounded good......but I really don't like it at all.  I'm in the kitchen now trying to come up with something to make this taste good.

This is more or less on the nose - however it needs a little more stilton and maybe a swirl of cream before serving

I made this with broccoli stems (peeled & diced small) instead of the florets. I halved the recipe, and added a clove of garlic, minced, at the same time as the onions. After simmering, I pureed the veggies & broth in a blender, and strained back into the pot, then reheated & added the cheese. It was delicious! You can easily taste the Stilton even though not a lot is used. (Love, love love Stilton!)

I love that there is no cream in this recipe!  It tasted great, practically licked the bowl clean.  We did add more cheese but only because we love cheese!

Eh.  It was really hard to rate this one because I don't know what I was expecting.  It's not good but not bad either.  I couldn't find stilton cheese, so I used blue cheese.  If I were to make it again, I think I would add more veggies (cauliflower, carrots, squash, etc) and not use nearly as much cheese.  Or maybe not as much blue cheese and add some parmesan or something.

Made this the other night. Very easy, very quick. Like a few others I added some garlic to the mix before the stock went in. To make it a bit more 'chunky' I used a potato masher rather than blender and the results were excellent. Very nice recipe, thx Anronicky. :)

I made this with some really stinky English stilton (I love that stuff!). Apart from adding a little more broth, I pretty much made this as written. It was good but I still prefer Stilton and cauliflower soup. Thanks!

We liked this soup, made only hours ago, and will have it again.  It is perfect for a cold, wintery day.  Even people who don't care for bleu cheese will find this recipe an exception.

I slightly changed the recipe by adding 3 extra ounces of Stilton plus garlic, salt, pepper and dried mixed herbs.  I also used only two cups of chicken broth and added two cups of veg stock instead because I was worried the soup would taste too chickeny. I was very pleased with my soup. It tastes great!

What a huge disappointment.  Sounded good in theory but consistency was not to my liking and the taste "needs something" but I couldn't figure out.

Had to try this recipe after it came to my inbox.  I didn't see any reviews stating they did not puree the soup so i thought i would try it just for the sake of simplicity.  It was good but much better pureed.  I also add a bit of red pepper flakes and some stilton crumbles on top.  It would also taste good with bacon crumbles which i will try next time we make this.

This soup is very hearty and filling for a low calorie option. Not a huge fan of stilton, so I substituted sharp cheddar. Also used vegetable stock to make it for my vegetarian friends. We love it!

I ended up changing this recipe because I didn't have blue cheese, there wasn't enough broccoli for us and I didn't use the oil to saute the onion. But it was the start of my own recipe which I am submitting to allrecipes.com next.

Nice filling soup.  Some may want to add more stilton for a stronger flavor, but I liked it as is.  Definately needs added pepper and perhaps salt.

I doubled the portion to freeze for work dinners I added a extra onion and 2 ounces extra cheese gives it a bit more Stilton flavour

This is absolutely the best tasting broccoli soup I have ever eaten.  The blue Stilton I bought from igourmet.com made this soup out of this world good.
