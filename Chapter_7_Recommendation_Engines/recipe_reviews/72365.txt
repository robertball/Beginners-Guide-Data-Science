Very yummy!  This reminds me of my mother, she always loved peaches and found ways to use them, picked peaches were her favorite!  This is a wonderful recipe, the younger generation has no idea what they are missing by not canning and making pickles and jellies!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My 92 year old neighbor has an orchard with lots of peach trees.  He is always offering me peaches when they are in season.  I canned this recipe for variety, if you know what I mean.  A person can only make so many jars of peach preserves, peach salsa and peach wine, right?  So I made this.  The syrup has a wonderful smell & flavor and the peaches taste great.  Make this as the recipe tells you and you will not be disappointed.  The only thing I'd suggest is that if you have never canned before, pitt the peaches and place the pitted side down in the jar and work your way up (use wide mouth jars if possible).  Another thing you need to know is to get ripe peaches that are freestone.  If they are not ripe, the freestone pits will not let go as easily and the peaches are more difficult to peel as well.  Place them, skins & all into boiling water for 60 seconds then place them into iced water before peeling (same as when you peel tomatoes when canning).   The peelings will come off a lot easier if you do it this way.  Then fill the jars with them. Don't overpack the peaches by trying to shove them down into the jar; it will make them fall apart more after canning.   You can also put a tablespoon of lemon juice into the jar before putting the syrup into the jar. The lemon juice will keep the peaches a nice color.

Same recipe as my Nanny's!  My Grandaddy was a preacher, and held a church in Vidalia, GA for some years & my Nanny always had these on the table. An old family recipe that brings back wonderful memories! Very good w/ pork chops or BBQ!

this is the recipe my mother loved. we always opened a jar of these and served with thanksgiving & Christmas meals every year; it was always a 'special' treat for us growing up; thanks for the memories as well as the recipe. Mama always had to buy these and they were quite expensive during our growing up years back in early 60's and up until now; always tried to find them for these two holidays and once opened & kept in refrigerator they would last for a very long shelf life. hard to find them any more so glad to be able to make my own now. again, thanks. The peaches we had from the store pickled were canned whole; peeled but still had the pit inside to help hold the peaches intact I imagine but when you ate the peaches did not affect the taste of the peaches by having pit inside peaches. easy to remove at time of eating so still pleasurable regardless how they were canned but I do know they were much prettier to serve whole with a few of the cloves in the juice straight from the jar; we always only put In a little of the juices though to keep from looking dry but were awesome. these could also be eaten next morning on toast like a jam/preserves just make sure too remove all spices and simply smash with a fork to make spreadable..yum!!! toast bread; spread with a dab of butter or can use a bit creamed cheese as a base and then slather on peach spread...
OMG!! GIVE IT A TRY FOR SURE YOU'LL LOVE THE SPICYNESS WITH THE CRUNCH OF THE TOAST.GREAT EATING WITH HOT BEVERAGE.

I just made my second batch.  These are GOOD.  My first batch I also added a jalapeño in one jar.  I can't say it really made the peaches zing, but the pickled jalapeño was great.  So this time, I made a little extra syrup and picked some jalapeños straight from the vine to the jar.  Woohoo!

This was really good, I thought. I could imagine this being an accompaniment to a main course, or as a dessert. Also a pretty good method of preserving.

You have to really like the spice, I followed the recipe next time I will not put spices in the jar and will cut back on them in the syrup. Thanks for the recipe.

Amazing! I had never tasted pickled peaches before, but I do know that Southern Women are great cooks! I am so glad I trusted my instincts!! That first taste literally took my breath away! Outstanding! I used ground cinnamon and only 6 cloves which I added to the syrup before adding the peaches. Enough spice for me. I used quart jars, but wish I had used pints, so I would have enough to give away. Next time!

Made two batches.  The first batch I removed the cinnamon sticks and cloves.  I didn't taste either of the spices in the end product.  The second batch I packed a cinnamon stick and 3 cloves in each pint jar and will proceed in that manner in the future for good flavor.  These were a bit too tangy/vinegary for me, but my better half liked them.
