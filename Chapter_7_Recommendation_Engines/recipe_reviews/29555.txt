If you are a mussel fan you will love this dish, it's also a great dish to impress your guests.  Looks and tastes complicated, but it really isn't :). I would suggest making sure that when you add the fennel it is very thinly sliced, and after dropping the fennel into the pan, test it with a fork and don't add the other ingredients until the fennel has become a bit soft.  Muscles are delicate and the sauce should be too so as to complement them with a delicate sauce as well.  The first time I made this the fennel was still as crispy and I had realized my mistake.  The second time I let the fennel cook a bit and all around it came out spectacular.  A+

The recipe was great, easy to make and fabulous in flavor. I opted out out on the Ouzo, but it still tasted great and I've made it several times since.

Happy Cooking!

At first I was skeptical about the mix of flavours in this recipe and couldn't imagine them marrying well with mussels, but it was amazing. (I followed the recipe exactly and used the fresh live mussels). Twelve out of the twelve I served it to loved it. It deserves five stars. Ingredients are easy to come by, it is quick to prepare, and is an easy one to impress with!

This was my first attempt at preparing mussels, and they came out great.  I love the broth!  Didn't use the ouzo, though.  I think the anise flavor would have been a little overpowering.  I just substituted more white wine, and it was excellent.

Oh my god, this is the best mussels recipe that I've ever had. I put a little twist with this recipe,because I wasn't able to find the ouzo in the local market.So I added some Jagermeilser because it has the same licuouis taste like the ouzo and I also added some fresh cilantro. You will have people begging for this dish.ouzo is a greek liquier

OUTSTANDING!!!!!  I'd give this 10 stars if I could.  I made exactly as written, and made sure that I sauteed the fennel for awhile before adding the other ingredients, as per other reviews.  Don't worry about too much licorice taste.  It all mellows out and you are left with a simply superb dish that is 5 star worthy....TRULY!!!!

Mussels, what more can I say, I love them! This recipe was delightful and I like the ouzo touch. Nothing can go wrong with steaming mussels in any ingredients of your choice, I use varied recipes and always enjoy the soup which the mussel water helps to improve. As children in France we used the shells as spoons to eat the steamed mussels and the soup. It has to be mentioned that unopened shells MUST be discarded. Tip; I steam mussels (and clams) in a covered WOK, allows them to spread and steam better.

Love, love, love these mussels!  Did not use the fennel or ouzo, I thought my 7 year old might not like the flavor.  Didn't miss it!  She actually exclaimed during dinner tonight "I am in heaven"!!  What more can you ask for!!  My restauranteur husband wants to add these to his menu at work!  Make sure to have some crusty bread to dip in the sauce...yuuummmm!

Made these again a few nights ago with frozen mussels, still really good, but just not the same as with the fresh.  Also, used extra sauce to mix in to some thin spaghetti...really good!

We couldn't finish the mussels we made in one night (we had steaks with them!) so we saved them in the fridge and re-heated them the next day with some additional cream.  Still delicious....

I made this last night for my husband as an appetizer and he said he would be thrilled to get this in a restaurant. I did not have the ouzo. It was the first time I ever cooked mussels. Very easy and I will definatly be making this again for company some day. I do not eat mussels but I was sopping up the broth with crusty bread I made sure I picked up as per another reveiwer's suggestion. You definatly need the bread for that wonderful broth. Thank you for the great recipe.

A tasty alternative to the typical mussel dish. I did buy the Ouzo as I needed it in another recipe from AR. I skipped out on the basil as my grocery store was out and sliced up grape tomatoes instead a regular one as those were on sale. It came out great! Let the fennel get soft before adding the mussels. Make sure you've got some crusty bread on hand for dipping in the broth, yum!

I made this recipe and added shitake mushrooms for texture (I would recommend this).  I paired it with a one-part water, one part ouzo on ice.  It was amazing.  The recommendation to have bread is a necessity for dipping!!!!  Also, would recommend picking out very fresh mussels.  I used new Zealand kiwi large mussels, they were slightly fishy.  I think this can be overcome by finding fresh, non-frozen mussels!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

Made these twice, the first batch wasn't so great. The ouzo was too much.  The second batch minus the ouzo were much better.

Good recipe although I tweaked it a bit.  Instead of fennel, I used capers.  I also added three tbs butter and eliminated the salt since the capers add some.  The ouzo was a great addition and flavor.

Amazing and easy to make!!!!  I ran out of fennel once and it's not the same.  Make sure you have fennel!  I also added a bit of butter to bring out aroma more.  

One tip I have is that once the mussels have opened, remove the pot from the heat immediately.  That way, your mussels don't get overcooked (as they can do so very quickly!) and become tough!  I like mine juicy and plump, so I cook them just till they pop open and eat immediately!

Added some seafood stock and doubled the heavy cream. I used 3 lbs of mussels and 1 lb of crab claws.

Good recipe but we found we don't care for the anise taste of the ouzo or the fennel.

I make mussels frequently with friends. We always do at least 4 different types. This is always a favourite.

This recipe is outstanding... I followed everything, as is..except I used sambucca instead of ouzo...don't be afraid of the licorice taste.... It is the key ingredient...plus I added shrimp and small clams to the mussels..all u need is a crusty loaf of bread.
Trust me....it's a bowl of yummy goodness!!

I did not use fennel and that was a mistake.

I'll admit, I did the ultimate sin of rating recipes.  I altered the original recipe before trying it as written.  I didn't use the Ouzo because after 2 liquor stores, I gave up and decided to leave it out and the other change I made was to add some portabella mushrooms because I saw a similar dish on Beat Bobby Flay and I thought it looked good.   Let me just say that this dish was incredibly delicious, definitely looked like something I'd order from a fancy restaurant and was so easy to make!  You definitely need the crusty crostini to soak up this tasty sauce.  Next time I'll serve this over linguini noodles and serve with a nice Pinot Gris.

We enjoyed it however, the sauce easily dissipated when I added the mussels to steam!  So we didn't get to soak up any extra sauce despite what everyone was raving about. Would like to try again but make sure it doesn't boil too long.

This was wonderful.  I didn't have ouzo so I used black sambucca which is milder than the white.  I didn't have tomatoes so skipped them.  
Definitely cook the fennel for a while, then add the shallots etc.  The fennel takes a while to cook.  I doubled the recipe as I had a 'lot' of mussels.  I didn't need too, I ended up discarding juice.  Even after I cut up a baguette and everyone dipped in the sauce to their hearts content - it was delicious.  I kept some sauce and leftover mussels, and next day made some fresh angel hair pasta, poured some of the leftover sauce on it, added the shelled leftover mussles and a few shrimp and it made a lovely pasta.  I do believe you need the ouzo, sambucca or similar - it just gave it a lovely kick.  Great recipe thank you.

sort of tried the recipe - i left out the Cream and replaced it with water, didn't have any fennel or ouzo or shallots - so those were left out - but did add fresh dill, chives and basil from the garden and  vadalia onion instead of the shallots.  a fresh tomato from the garden and fresh mussels made a great dish - I ate the whole two pounds!!mmwill definitely make this again - I may try the shallots and fennel next time too.

I added chorizo to give the recipe a little depth and kick.  After sauteeing the fennel, scallions, and garlic until the fennel was soft, I added the tomato and 1/2 lb. of chorizo and fully cooked the chorizo before adding the remaining ingredients.  I omitted the ouzo, doubled the white wine to replace it, and used light half-and-half instead of cream.  I served with crostini and salad.  All in all an eye-catching dish that was a big hit for Sunday night dinner.  Thanks for the recipe.

YUM! I've been looking for recipes that come close to "Mussels in Love" from a little restaurant in Charlottetown, PEI, called Sirenella's - this is certainly close! The first time we ate there, we kept mopping up the sauce with bread - we wanted to order more and cancel our entrees they were so good! To those who worry about the Ouzo... Fear not, it will NOT overpower the dish! Delicious!!!!

Made this last night, as I had the fennel in my fridge, and needed to build a meal around it! Crazy, huh? Well, I am sooo happy I tried this recipe, instead of my regular way of making mussels. The only thing I did different, was to use Sambuca instead of Ouzo, as that was what I had on hand. Every one loved this! My hubby was very skeptical, but wound up going back 3 times! :D I can't wait to make this for guests! Thank you so much for sharing what will be a huge fave in my home!
