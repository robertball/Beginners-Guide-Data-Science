Followed the recipe exactly. It was ok but our shoulder was bland and just too fatty. It would have turned out much better with a nicer cut.   The sauce was ok.  If we do this again, we'll probably use a pork loin.  I usually save butts for the grill for pulled pork.  All in all, not bad.

I liked the sauce well enough but it seemed to be lacking something. Next time I would replace the rosemary. But that's just personal preference.

Only made 1 change, I brined the roast in water with salt, sugar, crushed garlic, bay leaf, rosemary, and some peppercorns.  Only brined it for about 5 hours, next time I'll do it overnight. It was delicious!

This rating is for the sauce. Excellent flavor. I served it with pulled pork/pork shoulder.

I would give this a 4 1/2 star if I could. I found the flavours to be quite complimentary together and the pork to be an excellent medium to present them with. Piece of cake to make and this one will join the repertoire.
