This is the Mean Green recipe made famous in the movie "Fat. Sick and Nearly Dead". It's one of the most used green juice recipes out there and there's a good reason. The flavor is slightly sweet (apples) and a bit spicy (ginger). It's really easy to digest and very filling. The hardest part about making this juice will be cleaning your juicer. That's always a bummer.

This green juice tastes mostly of celery.  After a few sips, I added a cup of grapes to tone down the celery and sweeten a little more.  Very good.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great tasting juice! The ginger, lemon, and apples really blend the kale in well. I used 1/2 a lemon and 2 full leaves of kale for my first try ;)

I have been using this recipe for about 3 weeks.  Of the "very healthy" juicer recipes I have tried I like the taste and effects of this best.  I don't make faces when I drink it like some of them!  In fact I rather like the flavor.  I don't peel or de-leaf anything and I usually use 8-10 kale leaves and a bit more ginger.  I like that my husband and I are consuming 2 to 3 x as much fresh fruits and veggies with just 8 oz of this per day.  My skin has improved, I am less hungry duirng the day, and even at the end of a long day I am still going strong.  I didn't expect that at all... just wanted to eat healthier and use the juicer that has been sitting for far too long.

This is a great body cleanser but I got rid of my juicer because of the waste of important pulp, the only complete way to get all the benefit of these juices is with a Nutra Bullet. Best hundred dollars I ever spent. these recipes are totally wonderful for your body and mind but you need all that the fruit and veggies have to offer. I also add blueberries, strawberries or blackberries to the tropical drink.

Just started juicing and was looking for this recipe from the movie. In case you're curious about calorie counts (forgive me I have not read every review) here they are:
Kale/cup -     40
Celery/stalk -  5
Cucumber 8" -  15
Apple medium - 60
Lemon -        15
Ginger Root -   9 

I'm guessing by the recipe listed the entire double serving weighs in at 259.5 calories or 129.75 per serving. I only use one apple and usually an entire lemon. Just my taste. I've also found that about a quarter tsp of horseradish adds a little bite to it. I've also added fresh jalepeno. Both mods are pretty good. Thanks a million for the recipe!

I have used this drink to loose weight. It works! I juice three times a day for five days, then prepare regular meals for the week-ends. I have lost 18 pounds in 15 weeks. Increased energy, and I do not feel hungry. I also allow myself to have some fresh fruit with the juice during the week.

I love this juice recipe.  I use it all the time.  I really love the taste of lemon so I use a whole one instead of half and I like to change up the ingredients I use to add variety.  For the leafy greens, sometimes I use kale, other times it is spinach or collard greens.  I like to add some parsley sprigs, basil or mint for an earthier taste and the choices for fruit are pretty versatile too.  Apples, peaches, and pears work best for me.

I did the 10 day juice fast as well from the documentary.  You can find all kinds of juice recipes from rebootwithjoe.com.  I lost 10 lbs. in 10 days, and only juiced. This juice is delicious, but too much of it will make your mouth raw.  The juicing itself, makes you feel wonderful!

I, too, copied this recipe from the "Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead" documentary.  I went out the next day, bought a juicer, and drank it every day, for a few months, while making many continuous improvements in my diet and lifestyle (was a Mediterranean Dieter, prior to learning how sick that diet made me).  This juice, and the film which introduced me to it, was a life changer for me! I saw improvements, including cures of issues which MD's and pharmaceuticals could not help, within a few DAYS of days of drinking this juice regularly! I had tried juicing, and even had a juicer at one time, but like the previous reviewer, thought it was a bad thing to remove pulp.  Once I understood the science of why you want the pulp removed - so it can hit the bloodstream within 15 min, with all nutrients and enzymes at peak level, instead of having to go through the digestive system for hours, through which process loses some of the impact of the nutrients, plus, if you have any health issues at all, you likely have absorption issues, too. (the first step in healing is to heal the gut!). I have both a juicer and a Vitamix - there's a place for both of them! You can see by the immediate and profound results that you aren't missing a thing by missing out on the pulp! I use only organics when juicing - you don't want a concentrated dose of pesticides!

I experiment with other juices, but this is my favorite. Green is good!

I just got a juicer because I decided I want to add green juice to my breakfast everyday!  This taste better than I thought it would. I tried it exact as the recipe states, but I find it tastes even better with the addition of pineapple!!

I just made this recipe in my Nutri-Bullet ...but had to add Spring water so it would mix up to a juice.  God, it tastes terrible!  There must be another detox drink that doesn't taste so BAD!  Yes, I had to tweak it by adding organic raw honey to the mix.  It tastes a little better now.

This is an excellent juice.  My family and I have been juicing since back in the day when there was only an ACME juicer (strong enough) to do heavy juicing. I would add a hand full of parsley.

Hi just want to share that We have been drinking this organic green juice (http://www.juicingdetective.com/organifi-green-juice-review) every single morning for more than a year now. We have been feeling so great. My wife had many gut problems, she tried EVERYTHING and just after 3 months we started drinking the green juice we noticed with big surprise that thanks God most of the symptoms disappeared. The only other thing that we were drinking was organic apple cider vinegar.

The perfect juice for juicers! Clean and fresh tasting and it gives you a boost of energy while actually being quite filling first thing in the morning. I did cut the lemon in half and it still comes through without having the overly lemon feel on my mouth and I probably doubled the ginger but I like ginger and when your breakfast is a bunch of raw produced squeezed to a pulp, if you like something in it then you deserve extra of it! :) This is my go to juice recipe!

I guess that's what they call a green juice lol. But in all fairness it's fresh and tasty. So if you care for the green juice thing, go for it.

Saw this on the documentary, "Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead".  I'm not a big fan of celery and even less of a fan of kale.  Juiced and tasted as written, I give it four stars.  I thought it could have been a bit sweeter, so I added another granny smith apple.  That did the trick.

Made a half recipe leaving out the ginger. The celery taste was a little too overwhelming for me so I added fruit (have tried extra apples, grapes, and oranges) to sweeten. Overall, quality drink! Might try to add ice or be sure to refrigerate so it's super cold when drinking.

This is the first juice recipe I used after watching that Fat Sick and Nearly dead documentary. It was fantastic, you can experiment and add more fruit to sweeten it, but the fact that I went back for a second glass right away was rather surprising to me even.

This drink wasn't necessarily something that would satisfy a sweet tooth by any means. However, the flavors neutralize each other very well and allow you to down this healthy drink without cringing! For those with more sensitive taste buds, I might recommend toning down the ginger just a bit.

I'm a starter juicer and found this to be delicious! I didn't use celery because I'm still not a complete greens lover haha but the rest was wonderful and you really tasted the tang of those apples more than anything else. Definitely recommend!

We got a juicer for Christmas and this is the first recipe I made! Loved it. The fresh ginger and lemon really make this. I had a large bag of kale, chard and spinach mix which is what I used in place of kale leaves. Will make this often.

I've substituted spinach for the kale and pineapple for the apple.  Definitely a good drink for breakfast.  I don't use the celery and will have to give it a try.

This was my first time trying green juice so maybe this is a 5 star recipe for green juices but I did not care for it at all. My husband on the other hand said it was ok but not a 5 star.  Will not be making this one gain

I love fruits and vegetables so I may not be the best person to judge for the taste, but I found it yummy and satisfying. Happy I found the receipe  I was inspired by the documentary that was done called fat, sick and nearly dead. I watched it and saw the amazing transformation in health and appearance. I think if Joe can do that for 60 days, I can do it for 30!

Some may not like this blend.  The cucumber is going to stand out on this drink.  It provided the most of the liquid.  With most of these Green Drinks, its going to have a more earthy taste.  Your not drinking a Chocolate Smoothie.
Try kicking this up with adding maybe another apple or a Strawberry.  
These drinks will fill you up.  For the first timers on these drinks.  Try them at home on the weekends first, get your body used to the raw juice.  Try this in the morning, something very light for lunch like a Macaroni Salad and a banana between lunch and Supper.  And then hit the remainder of the Juice for Supper.  By the end of the day you will fill fresh and not tired.

I made this and it did not blend well.  My juice looks more like a puree. I put in another apple and still did not help with the thickness.

I made this dish when I was having work on my teeth for the week and had to digest nutrients without chewing!
Tasted great with a small amount of coconut milk or almond milk...that and a little stevia made this recipe go down easy!

This is indeed the Mean Green juice featured in Joe Cross's movie, 'Fat, Sick and Nearly Dead'. I've made this with my juicer several times now, and it is absolutely wonderful!
I kick up the ginger a little bit, but that's the only change I make to it. It's also fine without doing that; I just really like ginger!
This is my favorite juice concoction so far. I am always sorry to see my glass getting empty as I'm drinking it! 
So very tasty. :)

Great! Very simple & nutritious recipe. I added a whole lemon and a little more ginger to give a more balanced flavour (imho!) opposite the celery and kale.

I have tried many many smoothie recipes.

This one is the perfect good for you and tastes GREAT!

Since I used my Nutribullet I added a cup of Almond milk so it would swirl but the original recipe doesn't need changes.
Thank you

Try to avoid smelling it, tastes good though, easy to drink.  Keeps you full for hours.

This is my first try. I did not really like it because it mostly taste like the celery. I will add some other ingredients as some of those who have rated this recipe. I will add blueberries and see if that helps. I used baby kale so the bitter taste did not come through. I also saw that some changed out the greens. I think I will try spinach as well. I won't give up on the recipe it just  has to be changed up to fit my taste.

Made as directed, it's not bad. As far as a green juice, it's edible. I did need to add another apple, but mine were small lunch box size Gala's. I think this afternoon I'll add a few grapes or a pear to see if that sweetens it up a bit. I'm sure I'll be able to wean myself from so much fruit in it with time, but today was my first time trying it.

I altered the recipe because I was not sure how much I wanted to commit to juicing, and I didn't want any left overs.  I used 4 kale leaves (they were small), 2 celery stalks (the whole thing, stalks and all) and 1 gala apple (because that is what I had) and a whole lemon.  It's tangy and fun.  I love the color.  Drinking in the health.

Yummy!!  followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was really good but decided to make some changes to adjust for my taste preferences. I only added 3 stalks of celery, 1/2 cup of water with a few ice cubes, half of a frozen banana, 1/4 cup diced frozen pineapple, and my favorite addition--a few fresh mint leaves. It was delicious! Since I only need one serving for me, I will try to scale the recipe down because I had a lot leftover.

This is a great drink! Not being a fan of too much ginger, it's easy simply to put a smaller piece into the mix.

Agree with another reviewer that said this is definitely something you drink for health, not flavor.  This was my first juice, and I followed the recipe exactly.  I did like the cucumber flavor, that's what was prominent in my batch.  It's a big jump from "conventional" store bought juices to this kale concoction for a first time juicer.  I was kind of expecting something like Naked's Green Machine, and it's definitely not the same.  I may try it again with some of the modifications in the reviews.

Standars recipe and easy to modify. I always add a pinch of cayenne pepper and himalayan salt after because I love kick. This isnt for green juice virgins but Mmmmm.

I'm a juicing virgin and nervously tried this today (my first self-made juice!). I halved the recipe for one serving, and wished I had made for 2 servings as I absolutely loved it. The combination of the vegetables and fruits is a delightful mix. Add & subtract for personal taste. Cleaning the juicer was a bit of a hassle, but worth it.

Yes it's the Mean Green Juice from Fat Sick & Nearly Dead. It's good in a good-for-you but not horrible tasting kind of way. I cut down to 3 stalks of celery, add a carrot and a couple sprigs of fresh parsley, then increase the lemon to one full, without the peel, and I like it better for my taste. Funny part of the recipe is that if you are using a slow juicer, 10 mins prep and ready in 10 mins is a total joke. If I count from start of prep to end of clean-up and putting away the machine I've never been able to do it in under an hour. It sounds crazy but I check the clock and time just flies, and I'm not a slow poke either. It's a total pain in the butt, but I am sure this same recipe made in a blender would be yucky. I do love mixing smoothies into my routine, alternating with juicing, for the fiber, but the smoothies I make are semi frozen and sweetened with banana, pineapple, mango etc so they are more like a treat even though I can sneak some kale or other leafy greens into them. So those reviewers that tried this exact recipe in a blender, yeah I could imagine you'd never want to make it again. But using a juicer, it's really not that bad. The key is the lemon which oddly enough makes it sort of sweeter, and don't overdo it on the celery or the ginger.

I didn't have kale so I did away with it and added double the lemon so it wouldn't taste too green. It was delicious! Very refreshing! Will try again.

I am almost done making it.
Do I peel the lemon all the way to the fruit or just that 1 layer?
