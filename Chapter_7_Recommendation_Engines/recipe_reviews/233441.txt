This was really easy and terrific.  I made this version along with a version that gets smoked from a hunting themed website and this was nearly as good.  If you don't have a smoker or don't want to smoke, this recipe works just as well.  I got rave reviews although one harsh critic said it was dry.  Didn't bother me or my family, all thought it was delicious.

If you have a venison roast in the freezer…stop what you’re doing, go get it out of the freezer and try this recipe. It is fantastic! I do not like venison but this recipe had me shoving my husband out the door at dawn the first morning of deer season… we need more venison.

I will be adding this to the yearly venison go to dishes. I smoked mine for about 2 hours on the grill until 160. It was fantastic!

Worth waiting for!  No gaminess in the taste. I have every intention of making this again!  Delicious!  I have made at least a hundred of allrecipes meals and this was the first time I felt compelled to leave a review!

It's almost as good as pastrami you would buy at your local deli.  As with most reviews on here I didn't do it exactly as it reads but only becuase I butchered my deer myself and didn't have a roast.  What I did have was the correct amount of meat by weight for the curing process.  This is actually the easiest thing I have ever made using venison and it tastes great.  I took it to work and nobody could believe it was venison.  I would highly recomend this.

Friends have told me this is the best venison they have ever had!  That is saying something since we kill deer around here like mosquitoes!  No changes needed to the recipe!

Excellent.   Ordered the salt from Hoosier Hill Farm (Amazon).  pink powder number 1.   Used the quantity of salt specified on that package based on weight of venison roasts. (If i had used the amount called for in recipe based on Morton salt, it would have been too salty).  I used two small venison roasts.  I put these in frig after i boiled them.  Finely chopped it, and served over mashed potatoes with au jus.

I followed this recipe to a T except I cooked it in my smoker. Turned out amazing!! Just make sure your roast is fully thawed or the cure may not fully penetrate to the centre.
