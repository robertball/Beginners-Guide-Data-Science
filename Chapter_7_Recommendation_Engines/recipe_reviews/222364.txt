I love shot glass desserts! I often order them in restaurants, so I was happy to try this one! I tweaked it to become an 'Almond Joy' flavored dessert because I'm on an 'Almond Joy' candy bar kick lately! I only made 2 servings. I lightened up the cheese by using 1/2 cream cheese(fat free) and 1/2 ricotta cheese. I also added a few drops of almond and coconut extracts to get that 'Almond Joy' flavor. I also topped it with sweetened shredded coconut and chocolate chips. This was soooo good that I wished it was larger than a shot glass! YUM!

This seemed ideal for a small, sweet dessert. Since I was out of chocolate chips. I substituted Heath Bar chips and drizzled chocolate on top. Like the idea of using low fat cream cheese - this has a lot of possibilities depending on the contents of my cupboard. (We live miles from the nearest store, so don't make trips for one item!)

This was very good and easy to make.  I did modify it by adding 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and omitting the chips on the bottom.  I also used less chocolate chips and just folded them into the cream cheese mixture instead of layering, and drizzled chocolate syrup and whipped cream on top when served.  Next time, I'll make it the same way but use mini chocolate chips.

Finally, a way to use up the leftover cream cheese! I had half a block (4 oz.) that needed to be used. Scrounging in the pantry yielded a bag of about 30 chocolate chips. To this, imagining a cheesecake, I added 1/8 teaspoon of raspberry extract and 2 tablespoons of sugar. You can hardly go wrong with cream cheese, chocolate, and sugar.

This was very tasty and easy. I added 1/2 t. Vanilla to the cream cheese mixture. Used low fat cream cheese. Used thin layer of graham crackers crumbs on bottom. Layered with mini chocolate chips and chocolate sundae syrup. Topped with a few mini chocolate chips, more syrup, half strawberry and blackberry. Good, fast small dessert recipe. Thanks!

Used little shot cups and did only the chips at the bottom, one layer of cream cheese and topped with mini m&m's.  Good one serving dessert for a picnic today.
