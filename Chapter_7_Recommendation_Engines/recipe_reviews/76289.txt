Excellent!  I could eat this all the time.  We didn't heat ours, we just served it in pita bread with a little lettuce.  Wonderful!! Thank you!

This was one of those recipes I kept talking about the rest of the night. I used fat-free miricle whip instead of mayo. I didn't have English muffins, so I used French rolls instead. I used mozzerella instead of cheddar, but left everything else the same. These would make a great appetizer, but my husband and I had ours as a snack. Will definitely make this again.

This is a wonderful, tasty recipe.  I love having these for a snack and it's so quick and easy.  I use swiss cheese instead of the cheddar just because I love swiss cheese.  
Very tasty!

I am married to the most critical man in the world, and he went crazy when I served him this for dinner one night. Begged me to tell him what all was in there because he wanted it every night!

Very tasty and simple tuna melt. Since I'm off dairy I used soy cheese on top, and still really enjoyed this.  Next time I'll add toasted walnuts/almonds for some crunch.  Thanks!

So easy and SO good. I am a big fan of tuna sandwiches and this is a great twist to spice them up. I really loved the notes of lemon in this. To me, this really makes it and is great with the curry. I did add a little bit of zest in addition to what the recipe called for. I also used a little (but not much) more curry than what the recipe called for. Rather than sliced cheese I grated it into the tuna mixture but other than those minor changes did the exact recipe. I loved it!! I made it for a party but it is so easy it's perfect for a casual lunch for one as well! Also, it was seriously kid-friendly-they could not get enough of this! Will definitely make again.

Very good! The flavors compliment each other nicely, and there is a great contrast of textures. Apart from adding a little more mayo, I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks, BajaTheCat!

I did not heat this recipe and did not use cheese or English muffins. I used chives for the green onion. I also added a little green pepper. I put it on white bread,although wheat would be great too, and it made an awesome sandwich! I will make this again and again! THANKS!!

I reviewed this recipe as soon as I made it for the first time. I followed the directions as they were and it was delicious. That very same day, I made it again for a late night snack, but this time I used whole wheat toast and made it into a sandwich instead of open faced, also I didn't add the cheese as the tuna itself was good enough. I didn't bake it either, but I did toast the bread before adding the tuna. Other than that, I used the same ingredients and I am honestly addicted to this recipe...I can eat it any time of the day. =)

My husband gives it 5* and I gave it 3*... so, I decided to take the average.  :) I definitely liked the curry addition, but I ended up having to add more seasoning (garlic salt and extra curry) to really make it taste like much.  Served open-faced on whole wheat bread w/ muenster cheese and tomato slices on top + sprinkle of paprika over it.  Hubby said is was "great grub". Will likely make again.

Excellent.  I added more curry spice and used chopped white onion and celery seed as I didn't have green onion or regular celery.  Probably used a bit more mayo also!  Very tasty.

I make mine pretty much the same way but try this: substitute 1 T of mustard for 1 T of mayonnaise. Cuts down on fat and calories and adds more flavor.  I double the curry, add parsley, and use lime instead of lemon.

Yum!  Hubby liked it, too!  Served with a slice of tomato between tuna and cheese.  Side of sliced oranges.  Yum, yum, yum.  Super fast dinner.
--------------
Forgot about this recipe and thought it was a new find. We still love it.  I doubled the recipe and probably used 2 - 3 TBS of curry and some salt and pepper.  Awesome.

This was very good-like some of the other reviewers I ate mine cold in a pita (with a few chopped cherry tomatoes and some spinach). Think it will be great hot too-the flavor is excellent. The only change I made was 1 tsp of horseradish.

These tasted great!  The only problem I had was that they were a little dry.  I used sour cream instead of mayonnaise and I had to double it.  I also used hamburger bun halves instead of English muffins and white onion instead of green.  I will definitely make these again.  They'll probably taste even better on English muffins!

this was an amazing idea
i used a LOT more curry, and i don't like celery or onion, so i added: (all to taste...i don't like measuring)
green tabasco sauce
21 seasoning salute
california garlic powder
mccormick seasoned salt
fresh ground black pepper
diced manzanilla olives (with pimento)
shredded cheddar cheese (to the tuna mixture)
hot mustard (just a touch)
pepperoncini juice (just a touch)
and this wonderful seasoning blend called natures seasons
then i sliced up some gourmet pesto white cheddar
and hot colby jack
and popped it in the broiler

it came out FABULOUS

This was pretty good overall.  I used whole wheat english muffins.  If you like curry, you'll probably want to add more than the recipe calls for, as there just seemed to be a hint of curry on the tuna.

I will def make this again. So quick and easy. I changed a couple things ONLY bc I'm eating very low fat right now. Substituted plain non-fat yogurt for the mayo and left out the lemon juice. Left the cheese off most of them (although we really missed it).

Very good as is :) The second time I made it however, I used a 4 cheese blend, added red onion instead of green plus a handful of chopped pecans and a couple of slice of diced apple. I put it in a hollowed-out  kindof thick slice of French bread

Absolutely love this! Didn't use celery, because I didn't have it on hand.  We made ours open-faced on bagels in the toaster oven, and they were wonderful!  Toasted the bagels before topping them with the curried tuna and cheese, and then broiled for 2 minutes. My 11 year old loved it,too.  Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted sour cream and a splash of olive oil for the mayo to make it a little healthier and this was sooooo delicious! I will make it again and again!!

I liked the curry flavor with the tuna, not a big fan of hot tuna, neither was my husband, I think next time I will use this same recipe to make cold tuna salad sandwich on bread, overall good flavors. Thanks!

Mmmm so good. I left out the celery since I didn't have any and used regular hamburger buns instead of English muffins. Perfect amount of curry flavour. Will make over and over!

Good recipe! I omitted the celery because I'm not much of a fan and just used regular whole wheat bread. My family was pretty skeptical when they saw me making it for my lunch (curry's fine, but with tuna?) but it turned out great and I proved them wrong. Will definitely make again!

Absolutely wonderful! I didn't change a thing. I doubled the recipe and served it hot on butter biscuits. My husband loves tuna melt and this was a wonderful change from the usual. Thank you for Sharing.

This was a nice change for tuna.  Hubby gobbled it up and I went back for seconds.  I didn't have lemon juice on hand so I substituted with half the amount of vinegar and I don't think there was much of a flavor difference.  I will try it next time with lemon juice for comparison.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was pretty good although i ended up adding additional curry to mine. It definitely tastes better after its been baked and heated through.

This was pretty good. I did not have all the ingredients it called for so I modified it a bit. I used onion instead of green onion and put it on a whole wheat bagel. Also, I used mozzarella cheese b/c that was what I had on hand.

I thought this was wonderful. I didn't measure any of the ingredients, particularly the curry which I added a bit at a time until the flavor suited me. So delicious and thank you so much!!

This is great if you eat tuna sandwiches a lot and want a change.  I grilled mine on the George Foreman Grill (if you don't have this tool, GET IT! You can make everything on it in such a short amount of time). I used Ezekial Bread which is harder bread that i dont care for unless it is used as a melt. Serve apple slices or celery and peanut butter with this recipe :) Its awesome!

This was average. My husband liked the english muffin and the curry but just wasn't too impressed with the overall taste. Probably won't make this again.
