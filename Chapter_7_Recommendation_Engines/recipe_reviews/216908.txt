I know of Schnitzel and this is a lovely recipe but my family have always uses pork steak which comes from the shoulder blade area and it is much nicer for this dish than the chop. We always ask the butcher to butterfly the steak and then we bash it. Much less work if the butcher cuts it open for us.  Just love Schnitzel.

My family loves this.  Its just like how I always made it.  My grandmother's recipe called for regular seasoned bread crumbs, but I changed it to panko. I was searching for a variation of schnitzel when I saw this and was surprised its just like mine.  I usually use dill seeds for the sauce because I never have fresh dill and I use more paprika cause I love it. We never use the sauce for dipping, we just pour it right on top of the pork and noodles or dumplings.

For the most part, we really enjoyed this dish.  The dipping sauce wasn't exactly what we were hoping, but it did taste good.  I had to add a slurry of about 1 tsp cornstarch with 1 Tbs of water to the sauce to get it to thicken and we all thought it could benefit from a squeeze of lemon juice.  The pork was almost perfect as written, except I think next time (and there WILL be a next time!) I will season the pork itself with the salt and pepper instead of adding it to the flour.  Additionally, the paprika all sifted down through the panko crumbs, making the last piece of pork end up with the majority of the paprika on it, so next time I'll add the paprika to the flour instead.

Very Nice recipe. Def did my chops some good.. Instead of doing the dipping sauce I did a ru in my pan after frying the chops and made a gravy with a 50/50 milk and the chicken broth and whipped up some mashed potatoes and my kids and I were pleased. The only thing I did different was instead of going with the salt/pepper in the flour I shook it over them before turning in the pan. The one star review below should try it again... U did something wrong.

Absolutely delicious. I love schnitzel but had never made it before. Hubby even said "you will make this again". The sauce I kicked up a notch with some Cajun seasoning.

I just realized that I made this recipe but I used chicken. Just so you know, it was marvelous, and great the next day in a chicken parm sub. I did not use dill in the sauce, since I don't like dill.

Delicious! I didn' have sour cream so, I just made a pan gravy then added a package of pork gravy mix to my pan gravy and it was a huge hit. Since then, I have continued to add a package of gravy mix to my pan gravy because it adds alot of flavor and doubles the amount of gravy.

It's only 4 stars because nothing I do is perfect...but this is really good.  My husband said "really tasty" - means he really liked it.  It was easy to make - and didn't take long at all.  Good enough for a weeknight meal...could be elegant enough for company - I used pork tenderloin...sliced and pounded - watch your time..it cooked quickly.  I didn't have panko crumbs, so I used regular breadcrumbs - just fine

I will lead my review with syaing I did not make the dipping sauce, and instead made a pan gravy which turned out fantastic and was a great addition. The schnitzel without the gravy was actually very tasty. I should have added just a bit more seasoning to it, but it was great otherwise. My fiancee and i were very impressed with this recipe, and I will be adding it to my cookbook.

Pork is my favorite...  But this didn't do my chops any justice.  It's basically pork cutlets with a flavorless cream sauce.

My family and I loved this dish, however I added my own twist. I made my own bread crumbs, by slowly toasting bread in the oven, turning it every 5 minutes. Then I crushed it up I added garlic and paprika to the bread crumbs instead of the flour, because the flour would fall off I found giving it less of the flavor because the flour would fall off in the egg. I also made my own sauce with sauteed mushrooms in olive oil, I used a mixture of sour cream,a little mayonnaise, dash of lemon and pepper seasoning and paprika.

Super fast and tasty!  I used cubed pork steaks and doubled the sauce recipe to use as a sauce on the egg noodles I prepared as a side dish!  My man loved it, too!

I tried this recipe the first time I ever made schnitzel and it was delicious.  Even my son liked it and he doesn't seem to like very much these days!  It is simple and very tasty!

The pork schnitzel is fine.  Getting the right thickness is always a tradeoff.  I love the panko crumbs - can't remember the last time I used regular crumbs.
Tried something different with the sauce (after reading the reviews) - I used Colman's mustard powder (1/2 tsp) instead of dill.  We both liked it - wife made me save the leftover sauce!

Good comfort food, easy to make but make sure your chops are pounded thin.  Make this once  a month, everyone loves it.

This was delicious. It was really easy to make and everyone loved it. The only issue I had with it was the dipping sauce. I don't like dill, but I figured it was worth a try. It does still need something, but I think a dressing like honey mustard works just fine.

This turned out really well.  The sauce was very nice. I reduced the salt from reading reviews and served it over sliced boiled potato.  It was very pretty, could almost be used for an occasion.

We really liked this but found the sauce to be kind of flat. It needed something to brighten it up, something acidic. I added a splash of white white and that did the trick. Will add to regular dinner rotation.

These were really yummy and we did add a bit more broth just to make a bit more sauce. Make sure you completely remove from the stove. I just turned the burner off and the sauce was nasty for our seconds

This is a family favorite. We used pork cutlets instead of chops, which were much easier to pound thin. And we found a pre-made dill yogurt sauce instead of using the sauce recipe. Much easier! Garnished with a little parsley, and it was just like schnitzel we had in Vienna!

Loved this recipe.  There is a German restaurant by our house, and this tastes just like the schnitzel they do there.  I loved the dipping sauce as well.  My husband requested it a second time, which RARELY happens.  Thanks so much for the fabulous recipe.

We weren't really fans of the sauce that was with this. It was very salty. I am not sure I made this properly however.

It came out nicely.  I used a different sauce but the meat was very tasty with a crisp crust and my finicky I-hate-everything-husband had seconds.  I served it with onion roasted potatoes and fresh green beans that I steamed and buttered.  I love butter--I'd eat it off a magnolia leaf!

I did only the sauce portion of the recipe because I was looking for a sauce to go with pre-made pork schnitzel I had picked up at my local grocery store. Really good!

We thought the pork chop was great, but sauce was just ok.  I guess it looked better than it tasted, but it was a good meal.

This was my first time making schnitzel and it turned out pretty good! I didn't have panko bread crumbs so I used the Italian seasoned breadcrumbs that I had, which I think gave it a little kick in the flavor department too. The dill sauce tasted great and really made the dish. Very easy to make and will probably make again!

This was good. The sauce seemed to be missing something to me. I will play with it some to fit my own taste. The chop was great and loved the crunch that the panko crumbs gave it.

Absolutely delicious. I did not have the dill and can not use pepper in meals but without those things this meal recipe was still wonderful. 
the only thing that I added was a bit of garlic to the flour dredge.

I really loved the way the pork chops came out. My husband had this in Germany when he was a kid and searched high and low for a good recipe. I did not like the dipping sauce at all but it doesn't change how wonderful the pork chops came out. Thanks for sharing!

Turned out excellent! Used pork loin chops and separated the bone from the chop and the loin meat.  The smaller loin meat is super tender! Cooked the schnitzel to an internal temp between 150F and 155F so it was cooked to a safe temp but not overcooked. All pieces were very tender with a nice crust.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

Followed the recipe pretty close. Didn't do the sauce portion. Just took sour cream and dill weed and mixed it. Pork was moist and flavorful. Definitely a keeper.

We have a German restaurant we used to go to that serves delicious Schnitzel.  Unfortunately,  due to company cutbacks, my husband lost his job, and we're on a strict budget. 
  Pork cube steak cutlets were on sale at the grocery store, and I used them with this recipe.  There were 6 cutlets, so I had to double the flour and egg mixture to coat the cutlets (I found this out after running out - LOL).  Everything turned out fantastic!  I warned my family ahead of time that these have a dill sauce.  If possible, don't skip out on using fresh dill.  It smells so wonderful, and make a great difference to the taste.  I will definitely cook these again!  EVERYONE loved them.

This was a bit of a flier, never having tried anything with dill so predominant.   The only things I changed were in relation to the sauce ingredient quantities to make enough for 6 chops rather than 4. 

On the whole, this was pretty good as is.  I think I would double the sauce ingredients and punch it up a little with the addition of garlic, onion power, cajun spice, and herbes de province next time.

Thanks for the post, EPRUETZ!

I’ve made this a couple times. Both times I used boneless pork chops that I pounded with a meat tenderizer. Suggestion: mix the paprika in with the flour salt & pepper. If you mix the paprika in with the panko bread crumbs, the paprika just falls through the bread crumbs into the bottom of the bowl. It really won’t mix with the bread crumbs.

Zowie! This is a pretty awesome recipe. I didn't deviate from the what is indicated EXCEPT to use olive oil instead of vegetable oil (what I had on hand). I trimmed the fat and beat the pork loins to between 1/8 and 1/4 of an inch. The sauce was a nice addition... which is why I chose this recipe over others. I noticed the first two schnitzels browned very nicely, the following a little less so. That may have been due to a little less oil in the pan on the second pass. In any case, I got two thumbs up from all takers.

So good.  I used plain bread crumbs as I did not have panko.  I also left out the dill (also didn't have) in the sauce and added a bit of flour and 1/2 cup of milk to the sauce.  Served w fried new potatoes.

This was fantastic! the only changes I made were to put all the spices directly on the meat, so they don't get lost in the flour or bread crumbs. Loved the sauce too which I also served over baby potatoes. Thank you.

Perfect schnitzel and sauce. That's all I can say. The only thing is, and I don't know if it's because my range is really hot or my chips were thinner than these, it's more realistically like 2 minutes per side on med-high. I did about 3.5 minutes on my first one to test it and I had a really burnt crust. I did 2-2.5 minutes and they cooled through perfectly. I would do one test chop before putting a couple on the skillet. 

Will 100% make this again.

So good. I made 8 servings with the exception of the sauce that I increased to 12 servings. The sauce was not thickening after 15 minutes of boiling so I added another cup of sour cream because I was too hungry to wait.

It was good. I didn't used Panko. Instead I used commercial bread crumbs.

Tasty. A bit on the salty side though. Served with egg noodles and green beans.

First time I made this exactly as recipe reads, was delicious, but found the sauce a little thick.  Made it again but didn't cook sauce as long, and added a little Dijon mustard for a little zing.  Excellent recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! The only change I made was, I added 2Tbs of flour to the pan to quickly thicken the gravy. Hands down. This was the best homemade schnitzel I have had.

This was my first time making schnitzel.  I must say this came out awesome.  My husband who loves German food told me to keep this recipe. Though it is a little different than from our local German restaurant but very very tasty.

This has become a staple in our home. I love this recipe and have made it several times. My kids love it which is a definite bonus. I serve it with Spaetzel, which is also really good with the sauce.

When I made the sauce, I turned the chicken stock into a gravy with some roux, after it was slightly thick removed from the heat added the dill and sour cream.  I thought the sauce had a good flavor, but the rest of the family preferred a beef gravy that I had already prepared.

It said "Take a picture" when you're all done, but I didn't have time! My family of five destroyed the meal before I could wax poetic about the deliciousness I'd made. A keeper!

Good recipe. The sauce was too thin for my liking, so I add some flour to the hot stock to thicken.

I followed this recipe exactly. First, I ran out of the dredging material after every pork chop. The gravy didn't get thick, it was still very thin. When I ate the pork chops, they had hardly any flavor.

This dish was delicious! I used white wine chicken broth for the sauce.  It was a big hit with the whole family! Will definitely make this dish again. Thanks for the recipe.

After watching the video, and following the instructions to the letter, the result was absolutely delicious! Actually this is the national dish of Austria since its capital city is Vienna. 

TIP: The only change I made is slicing the pork with an electric food slicer. Much faster than pounding each slice with a mallet :-)

The schnitzel was wonderful and very easy to make. After reading some of the reviews, I seasoned the pork before I breaded it. I also split the paprika between the flour and panko - though I found that if you mix the panko fairly well the paprika will not fall to the bottom. We did not make the gravy as my husband wanted a brown gravy.

We loved it. I did add more paprika so my pan sauce was more pinkish in color than white...but we really like paprika so it was great for us. I did find I needed to thicken the drippings with a little flour-also not a problem. I want to try this recipe with chicken breast although the pork was fantastic. Thanks for sharing.

Delish! Although honestly I didn't make the sauce, but the schnitzel was perfect and, as my grocery store sells super thin cutlets, it was easy too. One note, I like them extra crunchy and thus I used way more panko crumbs.

Loved the meat, but the sauce was so salty we couldn't use it.  I checked the chicken stock I bought for this recipe and found it had loads of salt.  I will make again, but eliminate extra salt and look more carefully at the stock I purchase.  I almost wondered if the recipe meant chicken broth instead of stock.
