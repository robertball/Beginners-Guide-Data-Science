I loved it, and was not difficult to make. Now my kids 19 and 22 were a little more critical than me. So I told them to get a job.

This was such a great easy recipe! Im on weight watchers so I made a few tweeks. Instead of using 1/2 cup of melted butter I just thinly greased the pan with the edge of a stick of room temp unsalted butter. About 20grams in measurement. Also I used the same measurement for flour but used white whole wheat (look it up! Its whole wheat flour but has the texture and taste of white flour - you can find it at any health store). I only had frozen blueberries on hand so I used that. To get more flavor and less calories I stirred 1 tbs of brown sugar and 1 tsp of pure vanilla into the 4oz cream cheese then put it into a ziploc bag cut the bottom corner and squeezed it out in a swirl shape on top of the fruit and batter. The entire pan of cobbler is 33 points! So at 12 servings thats only 2 1/2 points each!!

Halve the butter and the flour. 
Add a large egg lightly beaten to the batter and also 1 tsp baking soda. 
Double the berries. At least.
Stir 1 tsp vanilla extract and 1 tsp brown sugar into beaten cream cheese. Spoon into ziplock Baggie. Snip corner and plop blobs on top of batter. Or swirl. 
The resulting baked delight requires a scoop of French vanilla ice cream. 
Very comfortingly yummy! Will make again.??

I made this yesterday for dessert and it didn't make it through the night.  My family gobbled it right up!  It was super easy and absolutely delicious. The only thing I did differently was use a whole 8 oz. container of spreadable cream cheese.  I didn't have the block type  and we really love cream cheese.  I wasn't sure the softer, spreadable cheese would work, but it did.  Great recipe!  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing!

I used more flour and milk to make a little extra batter because it didn't seem like enough. I also used more strawberries cut into smaller pieces. I just sprinkled a few cream cheese cubes on top and that's it! Looks beautiful and tastes amazing.

I love this and it is definitely a keeper! 
Instead of strawberries I did mixed berries, and, because I love cream cheese, I did an 8 oz. package instead of four ounces. 
This one is going to appear on my table again and again. Thank you!

The cream cheese adds such good flavor, and the crust around the edges is so good! I melt the butter right in the pan in the oven while it is preheating.

This was delicious and a cinch to throw together.  I loved how it was not overly sweet.  I increased the strawberries to approx. 3 cups as I had some to use up and that ratio seemed perfect to me.  Mine was done at 35 minutes.  Thanks for sharing this easy, yummy recipe, nauntie!

Yummy! Second time around I doubled the recipe and it came out even better. Much thicker and more substance. I also added vanilla and mixed half the cream cheese with strawberries, then did the other half as directed.

I followed the recipe exactly the first time and loved it, although it didn't get very thick using the described pan. Next time I made it, I doubled the recipe and added a layer of chocolate chips between the crust and the strawberries..... O.M.G!!! My husband, who "just likes" strawberries couldn't get enough! Said it was a definite keeper recipe! Making it again tonight for dessert!

Very good cobbler. I made as directed except that I increased quantities by 1/3 so that I could make it in two 8x8 pans instead of a 9x13. I wanted an extra dish that my husband could take to work and the two of us can't eat a 9x13 size.  Served warm with vanilla bean ice cream on top. Will make again...it's company good!

It was good and easy to make. I used half cup of flour, sugar and milk. One teaspoon of BS 1/4 cup of butter and 1/4 tsp of salt.  Oh and I added an egg because there was another recipe I had that included an egg. I just guessed how many strawberries and how much cream cheese. I did half because I baked it for myself. I goggled pics and my cobbler didn't look like the pics. My strawberries and cream cheese was underneath the cobbler, not peaking through. So I don't know if I did something wrong or not.

Loved it! Took it to the USCG Station and it was gone in less than 10 minutes! They requested I make at least 2 next.

It was good, I encourage others to only use only half of the butter suggested and add about 2 tsp of vanilla. As far as the cream cheese, do not cube, warm until soft and swirl it with a knife on top (like a cheesecake brownie) overall it was really quick and easy to make.

Loved this cobbler. Recipe is easy to follow and the flavors are well combined. With strawberries in season, I will make this cobbler quite often.

So good. I just pulled it out of the oven and couldn't help myself to two pieces. I put less butter than 1/2 cup in the pan, but it turned out great ! I will def be saving this recipe.

After reading other reviews I only used 1/4 cup butter and 1/2 cup of sugar.  I added 1 tsp of vanilla. I also substituted 1/2 of whole wheat flour and 1/2 white.  Tasted yummy to me and my mom and son really liked it. I think 1/2 cup of butter would've been way too much.  Next time I will add more fruit.  I was pressed for time so I threw my butter in the pan and put it in the oven while it was pre-heating. I put the dough in the oven to start cooking while I prepared the strawberries.  I was able to take it out after 30 min. and take it with me. Will use again. Thanks.

This was so easy!  And SO good!  My strawberries were a little "green" around the top, so I cut that part away and I added about 3 tbs  brown sugar.  Next time I will use more strawberries, each bite with one included is "heaven"!  I needed a change from Strawberry Shortcake, and had these ingredients on hand.  Great with vanilla ice cream and would also work well with cherries or any other berry.

Made this several times and it is so easy and yummy! I loved the edges so much, so I started baking it in cupcake pans so I get more crispy edges and they’re bite size.

What rock have I been under?!?!? Never heard of this dessert, but I made it because you guys gave good reviews. It was quick to make and delicious. I added sugar to the cream cheese, which was mixed at room temperature. I put the cream cheese in a sandwich bag and squeezed it out of the corner. Clean and pretty.

this was a great quick and yummy dessert. I served warm with vanilla ice cream and even my husband enjoyed. I used frozen strawberries because that is all I had and it was wonderful. I can't lie though the best part was the golden buttery crispity cake that bakes around the perimeter of the cake, I think I would maybe cream out the cream cheese a little by whipping it with powdered sugar and a bit of milk and then adding dollops throughout

I wouldn't make this again.  It was just ok.  Very gooey and odd texture like soggy bread.  The flavor has potential, but not impressed with this recipe as written.

Wow this is literally the best thing ive ever eaten and made idk how some ppl are rating it low. If you like flaverful guewy carmalized crunchy deserts than you found it. The changes that i made were i used frozen blueb strwb and rasbery w half a cup of sugar mixed in a bowl it was rather sweet so you could even use less. I made the batter and added vanilla and a squeez of honey i figured goes good w berries. I only smered the bottom w a stick of butter just coating it. I baked for 30 min then realized the recipe didint include oil so i took it out poked some holes in it w a fork and droped 3 tbs of coconut oil on the top and cut up 2 tbs of butter and layed over the top i then moved it to the top oven rack and baked for 15more min until crunchy golden and bubly. So this was heaven.  And best of all its the easiest desert to make i even used self rising flour cuz it was all i had. Great recipe to add to next time i would even add chocolate chips w the berries to make it really decedent even more so than it already is haha.

It turned out better than I expected. Especially good when it is warm. You might even want to add ice cream. I suggest not saving it too long because it gets mushy after two days.

I made this but replaced regular cream cheese with strawberry cream cheese. To make the cobbler a little less tart and a little more strawberry tasting.

it has potential but if i ever make it again, I will change some things. We felt it was to mushy and it needed more sugar. If I make it again, I will add a  half a cup more each of self rising flour, sugar and milk.

Fabulous flavor. Quick and easy to make. I added 4 cups of strawberries and 8 oz. of cream cheese. I added a little brown sugar to the cream cheese as suggested by another review and it was fantastic!

I used frozen strawberries that I thawed and drained. Taste was there but not the look. Next time, fresh is a must. My guests loved it though.

This is one of my favorite desserts.  Cutting up the cream cheese is the hardest part.  It's easy, it doesn't require much time, and it is delicious.

The whole family enjoyed this recipe. The first time I made it was with strawberry cream cheese since I had it on hand. We loved it that way. Delicious with regular cream cheese as well. But the family prefers the strawberry flavor. Great as a dessert or breakfast.

This is very good and I'm making it tonight with raspberries to use them up. It's better warm and since there are only two of us, it lasts a long time and we have to heat it up at each meal. Not a big problem but a nuisance. I added a tsp of vanilla to the recipe and it was delicious.

Made this a second time. Tweeked the recipe just a bit! I used a smaller dish to make it thicker and more strawberries. I used 1/2 cup of brown sugar and 1/2 cup of organic cane sugar. About 1/4 cup of butter and 1 cup of flour. I also added pure vanilla. Awesome and simple!

I have to confess........ Went to make this and found that the strawberries I had purchased were gone. Yep, someone ate them before I could try out the recipe. I did have blueberries , and handful of blackberries and tried with that and it was a huge hit with my hubby. One day I will try with strawberries , but I keep getting request for the blueberries . Nice to serve warm and with vanilla ice cream.

Made it for a family dinner, everyone loved it, the cream cheese was a bit too chunky, it didn't spread. So next time I'll follow other reviewer and reduce the butter, use whole wheat flour, less sugar and cream the cheese and squeeze it over the top. Really it was heavenly, smelled like strawberry jam when I took it out of the oven. Also I'd try other fruits in it too.

SOOOO good!
A few changes: I added an egg and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the batter, and I mixed 8oz cream cheese with 1/2 tsp vanilla and 1/2 cup sugar. I saw a lot of reviews saying people halved the amount of butter and the dish was bland, but in my family we do not cut back on butter ?? and I dont recommend it with this dish anyway because not only does it keep from sticking to the pan, but as the batter bakes, the bread absorbs the butter and a lot of its flavor comes from that! (I use salted butter).
It's not really fair to call this a "cobbler", because it's honestly more like a buttery delicious strawberry cream cheese shortcake. Serve it with some whipped cream and it'll be gone in the blink of an eye

Easy and delicious! I added some homemade whipped cream to top it off.  Was gone in an hour! This would also be great with peaches, blueberries or bananas! In fact I’m going to try all those!

Doubled the strawberries, doubled the cream cheese.  Adding the extra I had to cook it longer.  I didn’t set timer and I think I over cooked it .....but that caramelized it.   Excellent!
Yummy Yummy!

This is a fantastic dessert and easy to make. I took some reviewers advice and added 1 tsp of vanilla to the batter and 1 tsp of vanilla to the 8 oz. of cream cheese that I softened in the microwave. I also used 1 cup of fresh blueberries and 1 cup of strawberries. I used the 1/2 cup of butter which I melted in the baking dish while preheating. I don't think you want to use less butter as some folks said.

I used strawberries I had already sliced and sweetened with sugar. this is very similar to Crazy Crust cobbler. I reduced the milk to 3/4 cup because my strawberries had a lot of juice. Next time I will soften the cream cheese and spread it around more. The cream cheese stayed in chunks when I made it today.  We liked it a lot anyway. I will make it again.

Pretty good stuff. I'll use more berries next time, plus it's probably a good recipe for peaches. Be sure to place the strawberries cut side up to give the cheese a stable sit.

Having grown up on a farm in Alabama where there were numerous peach trees and blackberry patches, I am very familiar with cobblers made with those two fruits.  When I saw this recipe made with strawberries and cream cheese, I had to try it.  WOW!  It was delicious, and I will definitely make it again.  It would be a great dessert for company with a dollop of Blue Bell vanilla.  I took the advice of others and increased the the sugar, flour, and milk mixture.  I used whipping cream instead of milk.  I added a tablespoon of vanilla,  I added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.  All this was in addition to increasing the flour/sugar/baking powder mixture.  In addition, I doubled the strawberries which I had cut into 1/4 as they were very big.  Because I am a single person, I froze about 1/2 of the desert and will see how that works once thawed.

Made only half the recipe as I am single. Wow! good thing I didn't have to share!! Awesome, and so quick to prepare. I do think the cream cheese should be softened and mixed with sugar; then spread over the berries for better distribution. This one is a keeper.

J usually try to make a recipe for the first time as closely to the written recipe as possible. But with all the comments on this one, I also made some changes. I did use a 9x13pan and 1/2 cup butter. I melted the butter in the pan. I added a little vanilla to the “cake” batter. I sort of spread the batter out over the butter and slightly mixed it with the butter. I used more fruit than 2 cups and used strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries, all fresh. I used about 8 oz of strawberries (mine were very large so I quartered them), a whole 6 ox package of blackberries, and about 1/2 of a pint container of the blueberries. I arranged the strawberry slices on the batter first, then just sprinkled the other berries in the spaces left over. I used a hole (8 oz) package of cream cheese, which I had left out of the fridge until it was very soft. To the cream cheese, I added about 1/3 cup powdered sugar and about a teaspoon of vanilla. Instead of making little chunks, I sort of spread the cream cheese on the top as best I could. I baked it for about 35-37 minutes at the temperature called for in the recipe. The top was golden in the middle and a little browner around the edges and it was bubbly. I did not experience any pooling  of the butter as a couple people said they did. I used a glass baking pan, but not sure if that makes a difference. IT was wonderful! We put ice cream on top, but whipped cream would be good too!

I made this recipe not how the author instructed but how another reviewer altered it.  It was very flavorful but it turned out to be a blueberry-cheese upside down cake. That's why I gave it 4 stars.  I have every intention of preparing the cake  exactly as the recipe calls and will update my review.  Otherwise, the flavor is fantastic as a blueberry-cheesecake.

This recipe is awesome, very simple ingredients, I added 2 tsp of vanilla extract to infuse the flavor. It turned out perfect. Not to mention the smell that permeates through the kitchen. Whether it's wine ?? or coffee ?? this dessert is great!

Very good. Had a bunch of strawberries I wanted to use up.  I double the recipe. But not the butter. 
I think next time I will try topping it with a brown sugar crumb topping. It was done in 35 min.

I made this tonight and must admit it was really good. I added vanilla ice cream to the top of mine. The only thing I would do different next time is add a pinch of sugar to the cram cheese before putting it in the cobbler. It was a little too tart. Other than that simple and delicious.

Super recipe. I've made this several times. It's easy to whip up at the tail end of dinner prep. Then it's warm to serve with ice cream for dessert. Sometimes I add blue berries. Yummmm!  Guests always say it's the best they've ever had. Everyone goes back for more. Thanks for sharing!

This was good but I made some changes to improve it. I doubled the recipe for the batter because it didn't seem like enough to me, I also added more like 3 1/2 cups of strawberries and added a small amount of sugar to them to sweeten them (The ones I bought were not at all sweet). The biggest change I made though was to make it a sweet cheese instead of just cream cheese, which seemed odd to me.

"Your version" is simply the recipe without the needed egg AND jacking up the oven temperature to 400 which browned my cobbler way too much.  Very disappointed and wish I'd used the original recipe since I made this for a potluck.

It did not turn out well. The butter at the bottom and the cream cheese were overwhelming, making it very salty. If I make again I will double the recipe as it was very thin, leaving out half the butter and the cream cheese and increasing the sugar.

This was an interesting dessert...it really did taste amazing but it was so rich and tasted like a stick of butter with sugar and strawberries.  Having the bottom layer as butter just made it too greasy.  I probably won't make this again but if I did I would add more strawberries, flour, an egg (to make it more cake-like) and half the butter and maybe mix it in so it wouldn't pool.

Oh man these are soooo good!!! Definitely one of those desserts you have a hard time NOT eating!! I halved the sugar because my husband isn't a big sweet eater but instead I dusted the top with a little powered sugar, so delicious! If I make again I will keep all sugar, I don't think it would be overly sweet at all like some reviewers said. Bravo to the creator of this recipe!!! Soooo good!! And so easy to whip up!!

I did some modification, instead of just chunks of cream cheese, I subtracted about 1/4 of the sugar from the crust and made a cheesecake mixture of 1 block cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and 1 egg for the cheesecake topping, and I spread it around instead of leaving it in clumps on top....

Made this last night and almost the entire pan is gone already! I used frozen strawberries because that's what I had (thawed and muddled a bit with a little sugar) and added a tsp of vanilla as others had suggested. I also accidentally baked at 350 because my oven was still on that temp from dinner but it came out great in about 40 minutes. Gave 4 stars only because the addition of vanilla I feel was perfect . It is a fairly quick and easy (and tasty!) dessert to throw together any time you have some strawberries on hand!

I had strawberries needing to be used, & I chose this recipe because it was quick & simple. I can't give it five stars because it didn't wow me and it's not what I associate with "cobbler", but it is good. I followed it to the letter with the exception of adding an egg to the mixture, & I used whipped cream cheese. So glad I chose to make this. It is a good, simple, & quick strawberry cobbler.

I made this for this evenings dessert. My husband liked it a bit more than I did. It was Ok, not something I will make again. The taste of the strawberries changed so much from fresh. I think that is probably the problem. I love the taste of fresh strawberries.

This was very well received at the church function/bible study I brought it to! I used a full 2 containers of diced strawberries (would recommend doing that again - not enough otherwise, in my opinion.) Added a touch of vanilla and a sprinkling of cinnamon - topped with vanilla ice cream, and I wanted to lick my bowl clean! Admittedly, not too pretty to look at, but taste is what matters!

I'm not sure what happened to me with this one... I followed the recipe exactly with one exception- I used frozen berries but thawed them before adding. IThe cream cheese seemed to curdle and there was no flavor in the "crust" or berries. The crust part was very unimpressive. It seemed like it was not quite cake but also not flaky and crusty like a real crust. It was just blah.

Needed tweaked, but a great concept. Instead of plain cream cheese, I added 1/3 cup sugar and 2 TBSP lemon juice to the cream cheese. I added the melted butter to the batter instead of pouring it in the pan. YUM. Happened to have fresh raspberries so used them instead but this would work with any berry just about and some other fruits too.

So easy to make!  Baked mine in a9x9 in Sq dish so I baked it a little longer but other than that, made as written, very tasty!  Kids haven't had a piece yet, they are the strawberry fans, so the true taste test is yet to come!

It was delicious, but I think a pie pan would be better for this because the 9x13 pan was too big and the dessert was spread too thin and so it got hard and crunchy. But the flavor was delicious and it was very easy.

Great easy recipe. I had never made cobbler before and had just so happened to have picked fresh strawberries from a local strawberry farm so I decided to give it a try. Easy and tasty! I made a second one as soon as we finished the first! Good stuff!

I've seen variations of this recipe for a while now and finally decided to try this one. It was really good and very easy to make.

This is a very good recipe....I only had 4 oz of cream cheese, but could have used the whole 8 oz....My strawberries were HUGE so I cut them in half....Worked great....Served with Cool Whip...I had a photo, but it wouldn't let me post it

Made this last night so good, and no leftovers. My husband who is very picky with anything sweet said I made a hole in one! Best cobbler yet. Thank you for this recipe.

Easy, easy, easy.  Excellent taste.  I increased the butter and the batter ingredients by 1/2.  I have made this recipe twice in a week; once with fresh streawberries and once with frozen, organic blackberries.  Both times the flavor was wonderful.

It could of been a lot sweeter and I'm not crazy about the cream cheese maybe a little bit of tweaks and it would be 5 stars

This was a great recipe!  So easy and had all the ingredients. Will definitely make this again.  My family loved it with vanilla ice cream.
