This was very good and my whole family loved them!  I added corn starch to the flour mixture and then let the steak sit for a few minutes before frying them.  This helped the flour and seasoning stick to the meat while frying.  A trick I learned watching TFN channel!  Will definately have these again!

My family loved this recipe. It was very simple and quick to make and a fun finger food to eat, especially for the kids. I deep fried these in my mini Daisy Deep Fryer (approx. 3 min. per batch) and they came out great. The prep time and the cooking time in the original recipe is overstated. I had these done from start to finish in less than 30 minutes, so don't let the time needed to make this recipe scare you.  I didn't change the seasonings recommended, they were fine. Be sure to cut the meat into 1x1 inch pieces, no larger, because you want it to be like popcorn steak bites. Overall, this is a great recipe !

I wasn't impressed. It definatly needs something to give it more flavor. When i dropped it into the oil, all the flour and spices came right off.

I thought that this was a good base for a recipe... I found that with any red meat that more egg=better hold on the spices and flour, i also marinated the steak with a montreal steak rub for an hour before breading and frying... it did say feel free to "play" with the seasonings... over all a good recipe that i will try again and again till perfected...

This was pretty good, but just a bit too time consuming for me.  I will just continue to make chicken fried steak out of the cube steak, although, a nice 'twist' for cube steak.

Ah yes, another iteration of Finger Steaks, as originated at Mylo's Torch Cafe in Boise back in the '50s.  Use any cut of red meat you like, I've had them with a LOT of different meats, including fresh Bear and Cougar steak.  As finger food for a game, this makes just about enough for two guys.  As a meal, for maybe 4 servings you need about three lb of twice fried French fries on a platter with the meat mounded on top.  

I LOVE these.  I usually let mine rest in the refrigerator for about an hour after breading and before frying.  Season with whatever you like.

These were pretty good.  They were a different version of chicken nuggets, but with cube steak.  I will try this again.

These were very easy!  I added taco seasoning instead of mesquite.  Also omitted the cayanne pepper.  Next time will try with ranch seasoning.

I really liked the spicy flavor of this! It wasn't too overpowering but had just the right kick. I used left over steaks from our BBQ last night, and I used buttermilk instead of milk and egg because I found I did not have any egg. Thanks for the post! PS Also used a seasoned fry flour in place of the reg. flour.

These are awesome! I made them one night when we had company show up and my friend ate almost all of them even though she claims she doesn't really like steak of any kind. I'm a new cooker and the cube steak falling apart scared me at first but I called my mom and she said that was normal. We have had these several times now and I still love them!

My daughter liked these alot. Only thing I would change, make sure when you cut the pieces you cut out a good amount of any marbling. Made it hard for her to chew

Made with 2 pound measurments. I would
1 1/2 all ingredients except flour. I salt later. Cayenne pepper to taste. After frying, sprinkle with kosher salt. Alittle Worcestershire sauce for dippin, a beer and football, whats better.

I tried this when I came home from work tonight.  I had cube steaks but wanted to try something different.  I used the seasonings that I had, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  Me and my boyfriend loved it!! I made gravy from the drippings in the pan and served with mashed potatoes. We will definitely do this again! Great idea!!

I didn't care for this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly and the steak not very tender. It was time consuming and not worth the effort. My whole family was just so..so about it too.

Omg great recipe! This recipe deserves a 5 star rating. I feel like everyone who is complaining about the seasoning amount does not know that they can add a bit more before and after the frying!!! This is great!!

I have been craving the steak bites I used to order from a bar & grill as an appetizer; this recipe tastes exactly like them! I did modify a bit by using elk tenderloin & adding cornstarch as recommended by a reviewer. I served it to my family of 6 with home made fries & it was a hit (even with my picky 9 y/o)!!! Will be making again 4 sure

Cooked by the letter except used half of the red pepper. Could have gone heavier on all the seasonings. Put all cut steak in eggs rested 15 min then moved to flower mixture in a bag for 5.

I liked it a lot, but it's so messy to bread and fry, so it doesn't get a "5".  Love using the cube steaks because the meat is so tender!

These were great!  We have a bunch of cube steak and this is one of the best recipes we have come across so far.  With half the steak chunks, I marinated in the teriyaki sauce recipe (by Judy)from this site for 2 hours.  With the other half I used a combination of Stubb's Bar-B-Q Spice Rub and McCormick Grill Mates Applewood Rub.  Both versions were tasty and enjoyed by adults and kids.

wow! needed something last minute for unexpected dinner guests tonight and these little beauties were fast, easy, and completely addicting!  The only thing I changed was a bit nicer cut of meat that I had on hand.  Served with BBQ sauce and garlic ranch dressing for dipping (sides were carrots and mashed potatoes...easy, easy).

Not bad but a bit weird . . . again a texture thing, as I only think that a great quality meat may be used for this recipe, but if I purchase a grand cut of meat, I would rather have a nice grilled steak.  I wouldn't avoid this recipe, but I feel that the use is based on the preparer's butcher habits.

This wasn't bad...nice for a change once in a while...I used Beef Round Cubes and beef was nice and tender ...a little spicy...next time I'll use less spice...thanks!
