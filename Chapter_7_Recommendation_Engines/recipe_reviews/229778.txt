Just as a matter of personal preference I cooked these for far less time than the recipe directed - until tender, but still firm and retaining their vibrant color.  I eliminated the sugar, used fresh parsley and fresh tomatoes (opening a can for 2 servings wouldn't have been practical) and gave them several good turns of fresh ground pepper.  As this recipe's first reviewer I'm happy to give this recipe two thumb's up - for eye appeal as well as for being a little beyond the ordinary.

I enjoyed these more than I thought I would! I halved the recipe, halved the sugar and used four small tomatoes that needed to be used. You can cut back on the oil a little too, with no problem. For the initial cook time with the garlic, I only did 10 min because I didn't want to overcook the garlic. To compensate, I added on a few min at the end, and the beans came out perfectly crisp. This would be a repeat recipe! Thank you!

I made this for the first time tonight. It was wonderful. The family loved it. The only change I made was to use 3 cans of french style green beans instead of the fresh. With that, going forward. I might use only 1/2 to 1 cup of broth. It took a little extra simmering to bring the liquid level down.

Made it exactly according to recipe, and loved it! The suggested cooking time needs to be less, though, if you don't like your veggies too limp. Will definitely make it again!

1/2 cup of olive oil seems to me to be too much. I did not dare to put so much oil.  The beans turned out overcooked. I suggest cutting the cook time by 5 minutes. 
I thought that 2 tsps of sugar was too much so i added only  1 tsp. Next time i will not add it at all or I  may use only 1/2  tsp. 
I  am giving this recipe 5 stars because it turned out  good even though it needs some adjustments in  my opinion.

Easy recipe beyond the run of the mill green bean casserole.  Good flavors.  I used regular petite diced tomatoes instead of italian style and dried parsley instead of fresh and it still turned out great.  Guests enjoyed and paid compliments!
