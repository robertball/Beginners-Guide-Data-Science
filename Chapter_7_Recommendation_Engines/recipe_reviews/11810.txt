My husband is the cook in the family.  He made this clam sauce and it was delicious!  The only different thing he did was to triple the amount of clams (we like a lot of clams).  Tastes just like the sauce at one of our favorite restaurants.  And, since the owners of that restaurant have recently retired, we can still enjoy the sauce, only at home.  Thanks, Angela!

This recipe was O.K., but I will definitely alter it next time.  I like my red clam sauce slightly spicier, more clammy (is that a word?)and less runny.  I think that I will add more crushed red pepper, perhaps some hot sauce, all of the clam juice, and half of the tomato sauce.  Good base recipe though-Thanks!

i was craving a delicate clam sauce so this is how i changed it-fried up some bacon and onions,then added only 1 can of diced tomatoes, a little white wine. for the spices i used 4 cloves minced garlic, 2 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp ital seasoning, 1/4 tsp crushed red pepper, 1/4 tsp black pepper, no salt. the juice from the clams are salty enough. this was so good! if you want a heartier sauce definately follow the recipe as written. i do think that next time i will use 2 cans diced toms.thanks for giving me a base to work around. i couldnt find any other red clam sauce recipes on here.

My family and I have been enjoying Angela's white clam sauce for a long time, so I decided it was time to try the red.  I found it too salty, first of all.  The canned tomatoes are salty enough.  It was also to thick and pasty for clam sauce.  I think it is hearty enough for meatballs or sausage. I find it interesting that the recipe got such high marks when the reviewers didn't even follow the recipe.  Next time, I will add olive oil, and omit the tomato sauce.  I will also add the clam juice during cooking, but reserve the clams until ready to serve...this way the acid in the tomato sauce won't have time to make the clams tough.  I think with a little tweaking, this will be a better dish.

Very, very good!  I used Italian style crushed tomatoes and still added all the spices too.  It was fantastic!

Added 1/2 cup leftover red wine, 10 oz can whole baby clams and 1 tsp red pepper flakes, otherwise followed recipe as is. Excellent flavor! The addition of capers and red wine got it very close to restaurant quality. Will make this again!

Really good base.  I loved it. I used fresh basil, more garlic, different tomatoes, but that's just tweaking a solid recipe to my personal taste--very nice.  I took some out before I added clams, as my wife isn't a clam-girl, and it made a nice base tomato sauce too.  Thanks!

My husband and I thought this sauce was fantastic!  The only substitution I made was splenda for sugar, and I added some mushrooms.  I made the sauce in the crock pot (about 4 hours on high) then just before serving threw in the clams w/juice and cooked wheat rotini pasta.  It was great!  I'll be making this again using meatballs or sausage.  A very easy and tasty sauce base.

A very delicious and low-fat pasta dish!  Instead of canned tomatoes and tomato sauce, I used 2 cups of chopped fresh tomatoes.  I omitted the capers, sugar, and garlic powder and cut down the salt to 1/4 teaspoon.  I sauteed the onion and garlic with cooking spray for a couple of minutes before adding the rest of the ingredients.  After the sauce is cooked, I added some fresh snipped chives.  I will definitely make this pasta dish again because it is so healthy and tasty!

I substituted the can of crushed tomatoes for 1 jar of prepared spaghetti sauce and the can of diced tomatoes for a can of stewed Italian tomatoes. I also omitted the oregano and crushed red pepper flakes for personal preference.  Outside of these modifications, I made the recipes as written and the sauce was fabulous. 

I read from other reviewers that the sauce was runny, so I simmered the clam juice with the sauce for 30 minutes and then add the clams for the last 5 minutes. The recipe made enough sauce for 2 pounds of spaghetti. I considered freezing the Â½ of the sauce for later use, but unexpected visitors came for lunch and I was happy to be able to feed everyone and there were no leftovers! This recipe is a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

For our family of seafood lovers, this didn't not have enough clam flavour...so as I made it I altered adding more clams, more cappers, a little wine, more garlic. It was okay but I won't make it again.

I  love red clam sauce so I was excited to find this recipe.  However, I had to change few things to modify it to my personal taste.  I also added white wine, tripled clams but only use 1/2 the juice and added small can of tomato paste to make the sauce little thicker.  All in all very nice starter recipe.

I made the recipe as written, except I added the clam juice to the sauce and simmered it longer - about 90 minutes - before adding the clams. Really good!

This is a Great Recipe! Both my husband and I really loved it!  I only used 1 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and I used 4 cans of clams. (only added the juice from 2 cans) We doubled the clams to make it heartier!  This recipe is surely a Keeper!  Thanks!!

This was pretty good! I drained one of the cans of clams just because I didn't want it to "fishy".  It came out great! My kids loved it even, but I had to tell them the clams were little pieces of chicken so they'd eat it.  ;)

Very good recipe, and a decent recipe for a quick red pasta sauce (just omit the clams and clam nectar, and substitute with meatballs or sausage), or serve vegan by itself. I omit the tomato sauce. There is plenty of tomato with just the crushed and diced tomatoes. And I add 1/2 cup of an Italian red wine, 1 to 2 tbs of onion powder, and then triple the clams. You can add water to thin the sauce to your taste, or a small can of tomato paste to thicken it. It's a great family style Friday lenten dinner. Used minced clams and your kids won't even know they're eating clams. I use chopped for me and grownups who like the chewiness of clams. Or use a ton of fresh shucked clams if you want to make it premium. Then you can throw in a few clam shells for presentation. 

Also, use any pasta you want. I like fettuccine. Penne would work, too.

I made this red clam sauce for part of our Christmas Eve dinner, and it is a great recipe! I made a couple changes- I used two 14.5oz cans of diced tomatoes with juice instead of one can crushed and one diced tomatoes. I also added a 12oz can of whole baby clams, since I wanted it to be heavy on the clams. I also added a bit more garlic and capers than the recipe called for because I like those flavors.  All in all, this is a great recipe and I can't wait to eat the leftovers!

This recipe is so easy and turned out amazing!  I used 1 can of minced and 1 can of chopped for some chew.  Next time I think I will add 1 more can of chopped clams, minus juice, for more chew. I really enjoy clams!  Can't wait to use fresh ingredients from the garden with this one!

I halved this recipe, using half the 28oz can as the tomato part.   'Didn't have capers, didn't add salt because of the reviews; did add 1/2c chopped onion though.  'Don't think those changes were major enough to change the flavor much.  'Seems more spices & some red wine would improve.  'Glad I tried.  Later:  Added that splash o'red wine & some red pepper & that is some good sauce.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars because we loved everything about it. so yummy. The only thing I changed was to use fresh clams in the shell(letting them open in the sauce after soaking them at room temp in salt water for an hour. then rinsing thoroughly) and fresh minced clams. Outstanding sauce!

My question is does anyone use fresh clams in these recipe's? Or is everyone so jaded that they don't cook with fresh ingredient's or is it that it easier to use canned? Personally I prefer to cook with fresh.

I made it tonight and followed the recipe completely, except for one thing. I added a little dry red wine.My friend gives it 4.1/2 stars. He says he'd add a little more garlic, but other than that it's perfect!

Awesome!!  GS had canned clams on sale this week... bought them with absolutely no idea what I was going to do with them.  Came across this recipe and was pleasantly surprised with the twist that it allowed me to put on my "lazy day quick and easy spaghetti dinner"  :-)

I think this is a good recipe to build upon. I agree with some other reviews that it's runny but that's easily solved with some toasty garlic bread. Next time I'll double the capers and spices. I used two 10 oz. cans of whole baby clams, partially drained. It goes well over whole wheat pasta

I used about half the amount of clams suggested. Great recipe!
