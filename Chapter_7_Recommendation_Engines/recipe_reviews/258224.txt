Love this recipe.  Rave reviews.  I've made it three times now,  first two times used white cake mix and strong coffee and instant coffee powder respectively, as I couldn't find the Espresso Powder. This cake always turns out well, but by far my best result has been this third time, when I used a Betty Crocker Supermoist French Vanilla cake mix, and finally, the Espresso powder,  which gives it an unsurpassed depth of flavour.  I recommend to follow this recipe as written, and to not substitute any of the ingredients.

Made this for my birthday.  I placed the egg yolks over a double boiler as I mixed them with the sugar as directed, I was worried about eating uncooked eggs.  The topping was soft because of cooking the yolk but still tasted great.

Delicious!  I love the soft, moist cake so much better than the ladyfingers.  This was delicious and a huge hit at a dinner party!

Very good and moist I use strong coffee in place of the liquor and regular salt instead of course salt.

I omitted the raw egg yolks altogether and it still turned out good.

This is my go to recipe for Tiramisu from now on. It turned out amazing and had a real decadent taste.  It was gone before I knew it which is always a good sign.

This is fantastic!  Brought it to a friend's for dinner and everyone loved it!   I've made it twice in three days as it was gobbled up at the dinner and after I told my neighbor/friend about it, I decided to make it again so 1) some for me again and 2) so she and my other neighbor could try it.  Best of the two used the french vanilla box cake vs white cake mix!  On the second cake, I creamed the sugar with the cream cheese before adding the other ingredients for the topping and it prevented the lumps as happened on the first try.  The Kahlua is a bit spendy but this cake is worth it and one bottle will make many cakes. Thank you for this recipe!  It will be made again... and again!

This is definitely easier approach to the authentic Tiramisu, but still a little time consuming while waiting on the cake to cool. I replaced the cream cheese with mascarpone cheese, and at the end I also grated a little bitter dark chocolate along with the cocoa powder

Made this to take into work the other day. They all asked for more, it was nearly gone by lunch break. 
Making a cake, instead of the lady fingers,  made this recipe a lot easier.

I made this for our Independence Day celebration and everyone raved about it!! One of the kids suggested it would be perfect for Christmas.  We will certainly be having this again.

Love this dessert!  Friends have requested it many times.  The only change I've made is to add more Kahlua to both the frosting and the base.

Made this for Father's Day dinner, hubby loved it and told me that I should make this again. Only change I made was I used Cool whip instead of the whipping cream, easier and less calories. A definite keeper!

Made this for kids and grandkids when home for Mothers' Day.  Everyone liked it.  Please note this recipe has uncooked egg yolk.
