I had to throw away the pan that I made this candy in - the recipe is ALL WRONG.  After having this experience, I did some further research and found out that 1) you should oil your pan before putting the candy in 2) it should sit overnight in a refrigerator and 3) the author of this recipe neglects to mention that you have to simmer the sugar water mixture for one hour.  If I had known this ahead of time, I would have prepared for it.

This is really good and easy!  One note:  after adding the cornstarch, it never did get "very thick".  It got thicker than it previously had been, but not anything close to what I'd call very thick.  I thought I'd done something wrong and ruined it, but it set up just fine and everyone loved it.

Traditionally this is flavored with Rose Water, which is kind of hard to get in the States. Turkish Delight is very popular in Australia. I've always loved it, but it is definitely a acquired taste. If you can get the rose water, try that instead of the citrus flavoring.

I made this recipe for my daughter's 4th grade class, as they are having a book-club discussion on "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"--so this was the perfect opportunity to try making Turkish Delight.  It is an interesting recipe--with 3/4 c cornstarch plus gelatin plus sugar water boiled to 240,  the likelihood that this will at least "gel" is pretty good, which was reassuring to me.  The texture was somewhere between jello-squares and gum-drops, very sticky stuff (when it says to be generous with the powdered sugar--be generous)!  The color was a pale orange; if I made it again, I would add orange food coloring.  The taste was orange-y, and not bad, but odd to me.  Maybe I'm jaded by chocolate fudge and candies like divinity, but the sweet, sugary flavor I expected was not as pure--either the flavor of the cornstarch tainted it, or the orange flavor wasn't strong enough.  If I made it again, I would either add more OJ or add orange extract.  I did use fresh orange zest--which made for an interesting, sort of chunky texture--and maybe dried zest would have given more flavor per Tbsp.  Unless I have a specific reason--like a CS Lewis book club--I don't think I'll be making this again.  It was pretty time consuming, and the results were a bit disapointing.

I'm giving this recipe five stars for the fun and ease of the recipe, not necessarily because I think it's the yummiest thing!  In fact, I don't like it at all! :)  I made this for a "Narnia Party" and it was a huge hit to have some Turkish Delight.  Only some of the kids liked it and none of the adults.  I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted walnuts for the pistachios.  Like other reviewers, I too noticed that the mixture doesn't get "very thick", rather it gets more like the consistency of gravy.  It sets up just fine though after several hours.  Do make sure to put down a think layer of powdered sugar and generously coat each piece afterwards.

Made it and it is a very old fashioned sweetie. We are too used to jell-o and cool whip to fall in love with the old sweeties again! So sad! Are there any other flavors? I can't have oranges very often. 5 stars for as close to the old way as we can get!

I made this for my son's birthday treat to take to class.  He loves it and so does my husband, but it was SO much work and it never did get thick while in the pot.  I finally just set it out to cool and hoped that it would set overnight.  It did - it was kinda fun cutting it up because my son and I thought that the texture was like sticky bulistics gell :) I probably won't make it again anytime soon though.

This recipe is a disaster. I've tried MANY different recipes, and some came out better than others, but this was one of the worst. First of all, it tastes like jell-o. That is not the traditional taste, neither is the orange flavor.  The proportions are wrong, and the directions are extremely unclear. True Turkish Delight takes about two hours to cook, and then another night to set.

This is alright; I am not a dedicated fan of Turkish delight but this was better than shop-bought Turkish delight, though not as good as REAL Middle-Eastern Turkish delight. (obviously!) I'm a little surprised about other reviewers wanting to change the colour; it is meant to be pale, though also meant, as others have mentioned, to be flavoured with rosewater.

i have been searching for a decent recipe for this and was pleased to find this one. While it tastes yummy, it is sticky as all get out and this a it of a pain to get out of the pan....next time i make it i think i will maybe grease the pan a bit before hand and see how that works. Its light and sweet with out being too overpowering. I would also recommend using the nuts. i did it without and its just not the same. i am going to find a recipe now on how to make rosewater.  also when you add the cornstarch it doesnt get super thick but thicker....

Well the recipe was good and it tasted okay, but I don't think I really care for Turkish Delight. It's mostly my own fault because I had this idea in my head that it was the most delicious food, but that's because I've read and loved the Chronicles of Narnia books. Edmund always made it sound like the best thing ever. It was pretty complicated and I couldn't get it to thicken after I added the cornstarch. I probably won't ever make it again, but it was really fun and I'm glad I finally found a recipe so we could try it. Thanks for the recipe. My husband really liked it, I thought it was just okay.

If you want to try this in other flavors, check out "aplets", "cotlets" or other recipes for turkish delight. Aplets are delicious! I love the traditional recipe, but in the middle east other flavors (lemon, orange, lime, mango) are found also. Just experiment. Rose water is easy to find in any store that carries Indian foods or supplies. Walmart probably has it. Any halal or kosher store will, too.

For those who want to try this recipe, replace the icing sugar with corn starch to keep them from sticking to each other. Icing sugar will dissolve because of the moisture in the air and make the cubes become sticky. Starch will prevent that. Make sure you brush off all excess starch for presentation but while in storage leave it well covered.
Enjoy.

I give it three stars for being relatively easy - my 8yr old and I had fun making it.  He likes the taste - actually, he likes all the powdered sugar - and I do not... I have no idea if this is "real" Turkish Delight or not.  But the process of making it delighted my son, so despite the fact that I think it's barely edible, it was worth the effort.

It was good, I would use all orange juice next time instead of the 1 1/2 cups of water to make it taste more "orangey". I didn't add nuts at all since I was making it for my son's third grade class.  He and his little sister liked it.  It set up fine even though it never thickened up much after adding the cornstarch.   Fun to make for the Narnia crowd.

I was so surprised on how sticky it was. I could not figure out how to cut that in squares because of the stickiness, even after I sprinkled with a lots of powdered sugar. They look dissapointing.

I made this recipe for a cast party for The Lion,  the Witch and The Wardrobe . Since we had nut allergies in the cast I substituted the pistachios for equal amounts of shredded unsweetened coconut which complimented the orange flavor. It is the sweetest dessert I have ever made but as the mother of the white witch and Fenrus Ulf I was duty bound to supply this tempting dessert. No need for anything sweet for at least a month!  
Stirring often is the key to this recipe's success!

I couldn't eat it because I couldn't read it.

When I read to "sprinkle  it with gelatin" I couldn't find gelatin on the list of ingredients I said "Oh No!"  I clearly understand most of us do not have babysitters and copy editors where I agree I add but that is why we need precise instructions. Sorry.

I made the Turkish Delight.  My question,  is it mandatory  to put the pistachio nuts in the mix?   I would love  to take this as a  treat to functions that I attend.

My husband made this for us.   It is true that ours never got very thick after we added the cornstarch/water mixture. It was a little thick, but not as thick as the recipe stated that it should be. In the end it turned out good, though. We did omit the pistachios. It was pretty tasty, not overly sweet.

This recipe is not that bad but  not perfect.  This recipe has a lot of flaws which leaves a lot of room for error.
