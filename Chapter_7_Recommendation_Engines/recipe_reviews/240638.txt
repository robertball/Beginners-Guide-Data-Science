Made this and it's so good! I added just a tad more eggnog (almond milk eggnog) rather than milk for a little more flavor. Used with sugar cookies and spiced almonds.

I made this as written but added some freshly grated nutmeg to enhance the eggnog flavour.It set up very nicely. Next time I think I will decrease the butter a little and add more eggnog and nutmeg. If this were thinned out it would make a great glaze for any type of spiced cake or bread. Overall it was very good and I will definitely make this again.
