Really good and easy.  I did not stuff as I just cooked a turkey breast so I moistened with chicken broth and baked in a dish.

Was quite impressed with this recipe...so simple and yet so good.  Substituted chopped apple for the celery and used fresh sage instead of poultry seasoning.  I baked it in a greased dish for about 30 minutes at 350 - no need to add any additional liquids.  The second time I made this I baked individual servings of the dressing in a well-greased muffin tin.  A fun garnish for a platter of sliced turkey...

This is how I make my stuffing except I saute celery with onions in butter and poultry seasoning.  Then add it to bread and mix.  Add turkey or chicken broth for extra flavor.  It is so tasty.

This stuffing came out great!  I used cubed homemade wheat bread, butter in place of the shortening, and chicken broth in place of the eggs.  I stuffed an 8lb. chicken and had an 8x8 pan full of moist, flavorful stuffing.

This was a wonderful recipe with one exception, I thought that 3tsp. of salt was way too much and made it too salty. Next time I make it I will only use half that amount. Otherwise, the flavor was wonderful and the stuffing moist!

I'm giving this a three although my natural inclination is to give it a zero or 1 star because of the shortening. Use olive oil in this and it's four stars.

May family loved the recipe, I used 1 teaspoon less salt.  I really do not care for the taste of salt, the recipe was not harmed by using less salt. Since I cooked chicken pieces I baked the stuffing for 15 minutes at 350.

This worked well as a side dish too if moistened with a little chicken broth.

I make stuffing similar to this, but use butter, chicken broth, no baking powder, paprika or eggs. And I cook it in the crock pot instead of the bird. Much easier to cook and serve. It tastes like it was cooked inside the bird.

I make similiar dressing but Iadd sliced apples and crumbled sausage to mine. I also moisten mine with broth. I bake mine in a pan and it has always been good. Dressing is something I always look forward to in the Fall, and we also bake it with cut up turkey for a casserole type dish after Thanksgiving. I hope everyone enjoys this as much as my family does.

I'm curious, what's the baking powder for?  I've been making stuffing for 40+ years and never heard that before.

Perfect, just the way I wanted it. Tasted just like mom's, only she never salted it quiet so much. Didn't use the paprika like many others. But the one thing I insist upon is cooking the celery with the onion. Trust me, its perfect that way.

This is very similar to my grandmother's recipe.  Except I saute the celery and onion in the butter (shortening) along with some chopped fresh parsley.  I season the dry bread cubes with salt, pepper and the poultry seasoning.  Then I mix it all together with the beaten eggs and a cup or so of milk.

I did make this as written, and the results were as I predicted. I did not like that the celery isn't sauteed with the onion. The second time I made it, I sauteed the celery with the onions (in butter, not shortening), left out the baking powder, reduced the salt to about 1/2 teaspoon, omitted the paprika and subbed poultry seasoning and added 3/4 cup of chicken broth. NOW it was a five star recipe!

This is just like what my mother use to make.  The only difference is we use butter to saute the onions and celery, never shortening.  And we stuff the bird, we just like it that way.  This is the best.

great basis stuffing recipe. I used sage as well as poultry seasoning but that is catering to my family's tastes and I also added some onions.

This is the recipe that I grew up with except, you forgot the large handful of fresh SAGE leaves, coarsely chopped.  There really is NO SUBSTITUTE, there is no such thing as too much  FRESH sage.  Also, we don't use the eggs; there is usually enough moisture from the bird.

I'm only giving 2 stars cause it didn't have a good presentation. I almost didn't serve it but after tasting it...had to put it out. I took one reviewers suggestion and added chicken broth (I didn't stuff in a turkey) and cooked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. It was so flavorful. I think I will not chop the celery and onion so small next time. That may help.

Too much paprika, and probably the wrong poultry seasoning mix. I tried reducing both, but that didn't work either.

My family loved the stuffing! I used cubed homemade bread, butter instead of shortening, 2 pinches of sage, and some extra turkey broth. Probably should have used the eggs, but didn't. The extra onion always adds loads of flavor! I've been informed that 'box stuffing' never enters our door again!
