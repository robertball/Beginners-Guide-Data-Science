The recipe instructions don't say whether or not to drain the tomatoes.  I did and I'm glad because it would have been way too wet.  I did reserve the tomato juice just in case I felt it  was needed (but it wasn't).  Thought the ground beef mixture tasted a little bland after tasting, so I did add 2 cloves of garlic, some freshly-ground pepper, and even a few red pepper flakes and baked for 30 minutes.  This is so easy I was amazed.  It tasted pretty darn good, and I would make it again.

Very good....so convenient! I added a can of green beans to stretch it so I could share for a sick neighbor...worked perfectly! Season your beef as you normally season your burgers and it tastes great. I did make my own mashed potatoes. Very easy recipe! Thanks!

My family doesn't care to much for ground beef, so I used ground turkey breast instead.  I used a can of Garlic diced tomatoes and seasoned to our taste with herbs de provence, basil, salt & pepper.  I also made garlic mashed sweet potatoes for the topping.  Nice easy meal you can put together ahead of time.  I even froze a 2 serving portion.  The Bird Eyes vegetables made this quick & easy.

This was a quick version of Shepherd's pie that anyone can make and master to their own taste. Family was happy with this version. You can add more seasonings to your taste. All in all a quick, tasty meal.

Dishes such as this one are pure comfort food! I stuck to recipe (for the most part!) Made my own mashed potatoes; used thawed mixed veggies; added a couple dollops sour cream. Sprinkled potato top w/parsley and paprika. To the beef - I first saut√©ed onion; diced peppers (green, yellow and red, bought pre-chopped), celery, and chopped up some mushroom slices. Added salt, pepper, granulated garlic, a dash of 'Weber's Gourmet Seasoning'. You can do so much w/this recipe! Easy!

I usually think Shepherd's Pie is bland, but this was great. I did change a few things.  I used Italian diced tomatoes instead of plain and I added a little fresh ground pepper and garlic.  I also sprinkled a small amount of paprika on top of the mashed potatoes.  I served this dish with Sour Dough bread from Panera. Everyone went back for seconds.
