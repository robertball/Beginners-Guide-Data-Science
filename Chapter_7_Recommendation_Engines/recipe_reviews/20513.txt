We all enjoyed these for breakfast with sliced strawberries and whipped cream. The only thing I do differently is make waffles in the blender.  First I whip up the egg in the blender then add the rest of the wet ingredients and blend quickly.  Then add the mixed dry ingredients to the blender and use the stir cycle until well mixed. Then I pour it directly onto the waffle iron.  I add extra milk to thin out the batter if it needs it.  Easy! and a nice treat.  Enjoy.

My family liked this recipes I did make some alterations to the mix, I add 5 Tbls of sugar and 1 1/4 stick of real butter (melted) and about 3 Tbls of vanilla I know from past mistakes when cooking other recipes the bread didn't come out to sweet. This is a nice sweet I know it sounds like alot of sugar but it all balances out. I will definately use this recipe again!

The only thing I did different than the directions stated to do was I sifted the flour, baking power & sugar before I added the liquid ingredients.  If we could my husband and I would give this a 10 star rating. Also remember to put the hot waffle on paper towels because otherwise they do get steamy/soggy without. Thank you for the wonderful recipe.. no more mixes for us!! YUMMO (just like Rachel Ray says) ;-)

Glad to find this recipe as it is close to my mother's recipe that I lost. I separated the eggs and folded in the whites last. This is the way my mom's recipe was and it makes the waffles lighter.

I've made this recipe twice now. Now never even eating anything but Eggos and hubby buying me a waffle maker for Christmas, the first time I made this recipe I following the directions exactly and they were good but they weren't "OMG these are amazing!" ... Which is why I gave this 4 stars.. Today I made this recipe again but this time I followed the suggestions in the reviews.. I used 4 tablespoons sugar, 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1/2 cup of butter (1 stick) just b/c it's easier than have a alittle bit of butter left over to put away in the fridge, and 1 3/4 cup milk to make it just alittle easier to pour. Today's batch was amazing!!! What a difference! Now it's a 5 star recipe! And everyone wanted more! Also... another tip.. The first time I made this I shifted the flour and I beat the egg whites and yolks separately to make fluffier waffles b/c that's all you see online about how to make fluffy waffles. But it was alot of work so today I didn't do any of that and they were the same texture/fluffiness, so don't waste your time doing those extra steps. ENJOY!!!

What went wrong?!? I made these waffles exactly as the recipe said and they were limp and soggy, even after laying them out on a paper towel, and they tasted heavily of salt and baking soda. I was very disappointed because all the reviews made them sound wonderful.  

Conspiracy Theory: I've gone through the reviews for this recipe and the "too much baking soda" complaint is restricted to the last three reviews. I wonder if someone hacked into the recipe database and changed the amount of baking soda in the recipe so that poor, unsuspecting cooks would have their waffles ruined. Breakfast-related mayhem ensues and the evil hacker goes on to mess up other recipes. Think about it.

1st time cooking waffles and it came out great.  I agree that separating the yolks and whites makes it better.   Fantastic recipe.

Having never made a waffle until now, and having never even eaten one other than an Eggo, I have no basis to compare this recipe with any other.  Having said that, all I know is hubby and I enjoyed our breakfast this morning! In comparing this recipe with other similar recipes, including the one included in the manual, this one called for twice the amount of salt, so I reduced it by half keeping all other ingredients and measurements the same, and beat the eggs well to lighten them up. The waffle was crispy on the outside, but tender on the inside, with good flavor. My only criticism, and certainly no fault of the recipe, is that my waffle maker anyway, cooks unevenly, with some parts of the waffle browning more than others. Maybe it just takes practice spreading the batter?

Wow! Perfect recipe for "Classic Waffles"!  I got a waffle maker and couldn't wait to try it out. They were crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. This recipe is perfect as-is, but if you want a sweeter waffle you can up the sugar to as much as you like. I upped it to about 4-6 Tbsp and was liberal with the vanilla. These are delicious topped with real maple syrup or fresh fruit and whipped cream!

The first time I made these, they were a little bland.  I added 1t of cinnamon and used real butter this time, and they were outstanding.  Crispy, light, and full of flavor.  The best waffles I've made :)  They stay crispier if you pull them to one plate to cool slightly, then move them to another.  The steam condenses on the first plate.  I made them with home fries...yum!

These are so good!!!  Way better than the ones you buy at the store.  I made 32 of them and have them in the freezer.  We had them with stewed blueberries and whip cream but they are good with just a bit of margarine and some syrup.  Thanks for the recipe.    I am from Nova Scotia, Canada

These were very yummy! The texture was slightly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I added a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and halved the salt. Perfect!

The first time I tried this recipe, I did it as closely as I could. At my home, we regulary only have skim milk and Egg-Beaters style eggs, so I used them. It was fantastic! These are some of the best waffles I could have hoped to fine! After that, I tried using vegetable oil instead of melting the margarine. Just as yummy! Thank you for this recipe. Easy to make and delicious to eat. On most waffle irons, the waffle is "done" when the steam stops rising from the iron.

I thought that this recipe was awful!  The waffles were really bland and tasted really bad.  I re-did the recipe, just to make sue that I didn't make a mistake, and it still tasted awful.  I don't recommend this recipe to anyone!!!

These waffles are really good.  I've made them as is and I've made them with some adjustments.  As is, they are still very good, however I prefer my adjustments.  I added 1 tbsp of sugar and a dash of cinnamon.  I also separated the eggs and whipped the whites until stiff and folded them in last to make the waffles light and fluffy.  I also used 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup buttermilk instead of 1 1/2 cups milk.  Warmed the milk mixture, stirred it and then mixed it in with the eggs.  The waffles were awesome :)

I'm trying all of the waffle recipes on this site to find the perfect one. This one was great, but I think it can be perfected.  To fit my needs, I cut the recipe down to 3 servings and have made it twice, once as listed here and the second time I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. This addition took an okay waffle and made it pretty darned good.  I'll be adding cinnamon to all future waffle batches regardless of which recipe I use.

Very tasty!!  If you want the fluffiness of whipped egg whites without the work simply add a tablespoon or two of lemon juice.  The acid reacts with the baking powder already in the recipe and makes very fluffy waffles.

Delicious.  For those stating the waffles became limp and soggy I suggest laying the waffles on a cooking rack to allow the excess moisture to evaporate for about 1-2 mins after baking them.  Also, make sure you are baking them thoroughly.  There is NO baking soda in this recipe; it calls for baking powder and the amount of baking powder is correct.  Happy baking.  This recipe is a keeper!

Oh boy, were these great! Everyone loved them. I did as one other reviewer and plopped everything in the blender, added a bit more milk for consistency, and presto, yummo! Everyone raved! My friend Carole turned me onto this one. Thanks, Carole!

I usually use another recipe for my waffles (to see it visit my recipe box) but I decided to try this one because you don't have to separate the eggs. It was simpler but not as tasty. Still a good waffle recipe, but I prefer my own.

These Waffles Are Great!! I see that allot of people are saying "theres too much baking soda and taste's like salt." I have your answer this is what went wrong: You mixed up the baking powder with baking soda. In this recipe you put baking POWDER not Soda. Enjoy Your Cooking!

I really loved this recipe as is.  I made 4 batches yesterday, two plain and two with chocolate chips mixed in.  I froze them for a quick grab and go breakfast for the kids.  No complaints at all they are great.  Mine turned out light and fluffy and very tasty.

I tripled the recipe to feed a crowd and made the batter the night before. They were very fluffy and turned out great. I would only caution that it is a fairly thin batter, so we overfilled our waffle iron a couple times thinking it needed more batter, but they rise quite well.

Followed recipe exactly and they were good tasting, however, they were the extremely heavy and dense.  The search continues....

Excellent. Perfect every time. I follow the recipe and always end up with delicious waffles, a little crunchy on the outside and slightly fluffy, tender inside. The vanilla and butter make these more flavorful than most recipe I have tried and always come back to this one, as this is my family's favorite. Thanks for sharing!

AWESOME! Usually I make the "Waffles I" recipe from this site however I decided to make this recipe this morning. Wow...these were awesome. Fluffy, crispy, super yummy. We like things sweet around these parts so I added an extra TSBP of white sugar, and about a TBSP of honey. The fam liked this recipe much better.

This is a quick and easy recipe if you have a microwave (for the butter and milk)! I only omitted the vanilla, since I didn’t have any.  I also don’t have a waffle iron, so I made fat little pancake triangles in the sandwich maker! It works really well, and they are tasty and fully cooked through, despite the thickness.  I like that these are not too sweet, so you can add the condiment of your choice.  I am certainly going to be making these again, hopefully one day with a waffle iron. ;)

Very tasty waffles!  Just made them and enjoyed them very much.  I also did as other had suggested with whipping up the egg whites and then folding them in at the end. I got 6 waffles out of this.

Quick and easy.  Not as light as the egg separated/whipped whites version.  4 for taste/texture but 5 because of ease of prep.  Our 8 yr. old can make these on her own for us.  We found the batter on the thick side and upped the milk to 2c instead of 1.5c, and it was still plenty thick enough.  The standard recipe for 5 made 6 thick Belgian waffles for us.

Don't know how this is so highly rated.  Batter too thick and waffles are dry & salty.  Four teaspoons soda - no wonder...edit review.....my mistake.  I should have used baking powder! NOT soda.

I'm going to stop buying mix!  Made this in the blender quickly--no need to warm the milk or separate the eggs as others have noted in their reviews.  Couldn't be easier!  Thanks for the recipe.

These were the BEST waffles I've ever made and so easy too!  The only thing I did differently was to whip the egg whites and sugar together separately, then folded it into the batter last.  That is really the key to light, fluffy results!

Delicious!  I made mine with half whole wheat and threw in some ground flax seed.  Healthy can be so easily disquised!  I made extra for the freezer, and on my "rushed" mornings, I throw one in the toaster and I'm done.

what a total disappointment and waste of ingredients and time.  These were SO salty, I checked the recipe and my measuring spoon 5 times to make sure I didn't mistakenly add too much salt.  But no, they are just that salty.  I just tossed all the waffles in the trash.

Fantastic!  I added the extra 2 tbsp sugar, a half tsp cinnamon and whipped the egg whites as suggested by a few other reviewers.  These were delicious! I have no reason to buy packaged waffle mix ever again.

These are wonderful basic waffles.  I make them as per the recipe, but add cinnamon.  My kids love them with peanut butter and jam.  Trick to keeping the waffles crispy is to not put them immediately on a plate (the steam makes them soggy).  I throw waffles in warm oven for 10-15 seconds to allow the steam to rise off before putting them on plates.

Just the recipe I needed for my new waffle iron.  Inever have buttermilk in so this suits me fine.  I do use a lot of oil so they don't come out healthy but are crispy and lite.

I was looking for a new waffle recipe and gave this one a try this morning. I added more Sugar (about 2 1/2 TBSP) but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The waffles were light and fluffy with a nice golden "crust". I may add a touch more vanilla next time. Between that and the needed sugar this recipe is perfect! Also, one thing it took me a while to learn in making waffles - they NEVER turn out fully risen if I sprinkle things like blueberries or chocolate chips before closing the lid. It's a completely different waffle - so leave them plain and get creative with what you put on top of them when they are finished! Thanks for the recipe! This will be replacing my old one.

These aren't good at all. I took the extra step of beating the egg whites separately and folding them into the batter at the end.  They puffed up fine during cooking then felt completely flat.  They were tasteless and dense.  Would not make these again.

I created an account for the sole purpose of writing this review.  I have tried numerous recipes and store bought mixes; this recipe is by far the best waffle recipe I have ever made.  Look no farther.  This isn't just my opinion, my wife ( who is incredibly picky ) and my daughter both have glowing praise every time I make this.  In addition, this waffle batter makes a great batter for fried chicken as well (a la Popeye's waffle tenders)

This recipe is awesome all on its own, but I like to play with recipes after trying them a few times.  I have since tweaked this recipe, and my husband and his family love it.  

Here are my substitutions:
Instead of 1 teaspoon salt, I use 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda.  I use 1/3 cup canola oil instead of butter (butter is really expensive here and melted margarine just didn't work right for us).  I use milk straight out of the fridge and don't bother with heating it.  I use 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract.

It's a little quicker to put together since nothing requires heating, and the waffles turn out beautifully.

I subsituted vanilla soy milk for the regular milk called for (I omitted the sugar and vanilla to compensate). They turned out light and fluffy.

This receipe has been a lifesavor! I'm currently living in Brazil and they don't have the typical American breakfasts. I brought my waffle iron with me and now enjoy homemade waffles several times a week. I make a bunch up and put the extra in the freezer. They reheat really well in the toaster. They're like my own personal Eggos! Thanks!

I followed the instructions just exactly as stated. My husband and I found the waffles bland. It is an "ok" recipe, but nothing that will impress people. When I cook, I like people to be "wow'ed".
There are certainly better waffle recipes out there. Will not make these again.

These are absolutely delish!! I made these for my 3 girls and husband on their first day of spring break and they loved them!! They turned out picture perfect! I started by making one batch which wasn't enough for my size family so I made a double batch on top of the batch I had already made which was way to much. So I came up with an idea to keep making them until all the batter was gone then put them in a zip lock bag then pop them in the refrigerator for the next morning. THIS WAS THE BEST IDEA IN THE WORLD!!! The next day I pulled them out of the fridge and popped them in the toaster, DELICIOUS!!!!! I will be using this recipe for years and years and years to come!!! Thanks so much for posting!!!

Have made as written at least 10 times before without problem.  Turns out just as well if you prepare the batter the night before. Can be doubled or halved if need be.  Today for St. Patrick's Day, I put some green food coloring in...the kids loved it!  Many thanks for a great recipe that is a staple in our home.

Made this for the first time and it was pretty good. I did feel that there was a little too much salt.  I didn't find the saltiness overpowering like some reviews said which leads me to believe that maybe they were using baking soda instead of baking powder.  I do believe that next time I will increase the vanilla and decrease the salt.  This is a solid recipe that can be built upon and I look forward to making it again.  Thanks for sharing!

I've eaten waffles before but never made them for myself at home. The batter was easy to put together, thou I only added 1/2 tsp of salt. I also increased the sugar to 3T. I did whip the eggs separately then added it to the batter last before pouring onto the hot waffle maker. I used PAM non-stick cooking spray in between each batch so the waffles wouldn't stick. This batch makes 12 waffles, half of which I froze for another day. The waffles didn't take that long to cook and is a nice golden brown color. The waffle is crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. It is also tasty and has a good flavor. My family and I enjoyed these for breakfast this morning with fresh sliced strawberries and light drizzle of maple syrup. Now that I know how to make waffles, I think next time I would like to top this off with some homemade whipped topping.

I didn't think these were very good.  Sure, it's a quick and easy recipe, and they cook up just fine, but I thought they were a bit bland for waffles.  They did have that waffle-like "Taste" to them - you know what I mean?  But they didn't seem sweet enough to me.  Or seem like much of anything, really.  I'm going to try other recipes or play with this one to see if I can improve upon it.  I did like it OK, but was not impressed.

These were delicious. I halved the salt, added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon, and put a bit more milk than it called for. I also separated the eggs and mixed in the whites at the end. They were crispy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. I WILL MAKE THESE AGAIN!!!

The 1 tsp of salt and 4 tsp of baking soda made these waffles much too salty. I found myself drowning them in syrup to mask the bitter aftertaste. I will also have to agree with some of the other reviews in saying that the waffles were also on the dense side and had the consistency of pancakes.

These smell SO good while baking! I made buttermilk for mine (milk + some vinegar). I let it sit for a bit, while cooking sausages and the batter turned into a sponge like consistency, airy and delicate. I used a little more milk and stirred it to make it easier to scoop and pour.

Great recipe!  I made our waffles with half spelt flour and half white flour.  I also made them dairy free and substituted warm soy milk and melted vegan butter (Earth Balance).  They came out great!  I've had such problems making a dairy-free waffle and was very pleasantly surprised.  I also used powdered sugar instead of white (as I didn't have any) and added an equal amt of cocoa powder to give it a little chocolate-y taste.

I have been making this every week for my son for months. No more frozen waffles in this house! The batter lasts for about 5 days in the fridge then I make some more. The only change I made was I swapped out butter for coconut oil. Thanks for the recipe!

Perfect and easy recipe.  I do 3 things to modify.
1.  4 Tbsp sugar...1/2 and 1/2 Sugar and Splenda.
2.  Add mini choco chips or small blueberries...a handful or two
3.  Immediately served waffles to golden brown with a little crisp but remainder a bit "under-browned"...kept in zip-lock bags for toaster oven browning through the week
Thanks

I quickly found this recipe and didn't look at any reviews or suggestions, assuming with so many reviews and the high star rating it would be excellent.  Unfortunately I found the waffles dry and tasteless. The batter was VERY thick and I didn't take the time to thin it with milk, assuming it was supposed to be this way to maintain the flavor.  My daughters ate them but we found they were MUCH improved with blueberries, butter and something to dip them in like syrup or vanilla yogurt.  I would rather have had a delicious tasting waffle that could almost stand alone on it's taste.  The ONLY thing I changed was using King Arthur White Wheat flour, which I use for everything.  Perhaps this was the problem.  Needless to say I am very disappointed and next time will read more.  I won't be making these again.

I made these tonight to be rewarmed in the toaster oven in the morning. I didn't separate the yolks from the whites, but I beat the eggs pretty well before adding the other liquids. I also made sure that the butter had cooled before adding so that it didn't cook the egg. The waffles browned very well and raised well. They were also light on the inside. I didn't crisp them because that would be done in the toaster oven. I doubled the recipe, and will freeze the leftovers for future quick breakfasts. One word of caution I can offer is to be careful not to add too much batter to the waffle maker, and to spread the batter a bit before closing the waffle maker. The first couple of waffles made a mess all over the counter with the run-off. This is not the fault of the recipe, but the batter does spread and raise a lot.

I am totally in LOVE with this recipe!! I pre-made it last night for my kids this morning for breakfast before church, and it was just AMAZING!! what I did different was  separate wey and dry ingredients, the only thing i did was melt the butter, i didn't heat the milk.. (sorry, I'm a bit lazy at times..) As long as you follow basic baking instructions, you are okay with this recipe. Everyone in the family agrees, this is our new waffle recipe/1

I made two seperate batches of this recipe, exactly according to the recipe. It was the weirdest thing, one batch was really thick and one was much thinner. Either way, the waffles turned out crisp on the outside and fluffy and soft on the inside. From the thick batch, I got exactly eight waffles. From the thin batch, I was able to get nine. My husband says this needs to be my go-to waffle recipe from now on. I was making one that used oil instead of butter but he and I both agreed that butter makes all the difference.

I thought I did something wrong when I was mixing these, they came out water thin, but I was pleasantly surprised when I cooked them. May be a bit bland but not bad. Try'em for yourself.

Sadly I wasn't impressed with this waffle recipe. I Have a new waffle iron, but it wasn't even remotely crispy, and apparently 5 servings per this recipe is 5 waffles. Major bummer and won't be making again.

Followed suggestions and added 5 T sugar and 2 T vanilla. We had enough for waffles two days in a row--kept beautifully.

I found this and made it for my family today and everyone loved it! IT was light and fluffy and I didn't even have vainly extract. I took someone else's advice and blended all the wet ingredients in the blender and then added the mixed dry ingredients. Really easy to make and pour the batter that way.
I will definitely make these our staple waffle recipe!

I whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end. I also added a bit more sugar. Very good!

This is a great recipe. I always make at least double so I can freeze them for breakfasts through out the week. They freeze very well and hold up excellently in the toaster! Thank you for sharing.

I've been using this recipe for a year now. The first time I made it as is but now I make it with a few changes. I use 1 3/4 cup milk because, as written, the batter is too thick. 1 3/4 c seems a little runny at first but I always let my batter rest for 5-7 min after mixing and by then it has thickened nicely.

I use 6 T of butter since that's easier to measure than 5 1/3 T(which is 1/3 c). I also use 4 tbsp sugar  and 2tbsp vanilla. Instead of using 2c all-purpose, I use 1 c All-purpose and 1 c white whole wheat flour(King Arthur or Gold Medal brands).  

If you've never tried white whole wheat then you should. It's gives you all the benefits of red wheat but none of red wheat's bitterness. I use it to get in extra fiber in many of baked goods I make for my family. That's the beauty of cooking from scratch!

So... amazing... I followed the recipe but for one change: I used margarine instead of butter. And these turned out absolutely delicious. Some reviewers suggest separating the eggs, beating the whites and folding in gently at the end. While I'm sure this makes for an even fluffier waffle, I don't feel it's necessary. These were fluffy, light, crispy. The batter seemed a little runny at the end, so I added a couple tablespoons of cornstarch (as recommended by my waffle iron manual to make waffles more crispy), but as the batter sat between waffles, it got a lot thicker. It was unnecessary, but my waffles WERE nice and crispy! Thanks for sharing, Megan!

A great basic recipe!  I subbed whole wheat flour and honey for the white flour and sugar.  The waffles were a bit on the heavy side but I'm sure that's why.  The taste was great and the kids loved them!

Loved this!  I used 3/4 cup of whole wheat flour (and then 1 1/4 cups white flour) I added a tbsp. of brown sugar and a little extra vanilla.  My boys gobbled them up!

DO NOT under any circumstances add salt to this.  It was so salty it was inedible.  I had to add a bunch of other stuff to make up for it.  I did add cinnamon like others said.  I liked it but my husband thought it was too much.  Overall, these weren't good until you put butter and syrup on them at all.

I was looking for a recipe that doesn't take too much time because I work fulltime and have a 5 year. The only thing I added was one more Tablespoon  sugar because I tried it one time before and I didn't like the taste. It was excellent and I have never made waffles before this recipe. This will be my waffle recipe from now on. Don't  let this one get away. YUMO !

My daughter and I loved these waffles.  They were easy to make and even easier to eat. My daughter eats waffles every where we go so she knows her waffles. And for her to love them is a slam dunk. Thanks for sharing it!

These waffles are so good! They are golden brown and crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. The batter was pretty thick, and I used a 1/2 cup measuring cup to pour the batter on the waffle iron. I always add about 1 cup of semisweet chocolate chips and they are awesome! Also, any leftover waffles that I have I freeze in sandwich bags to be toasted for breakfast.

This recipe is unshakeable.  I'm not one to substitute a bunch of ingredients and then give a bad review, but I'm happy to report that this recipe stands up to all kinds of substitutions.  I've used oil instead of butter, rice milk, hemp milk, and/or almond milk instead of milk, egg substitute instead of eggs, and I think I've even used alternative flours.  I've been cooking to accommodate a lot of food allergies.  The only time this recipe hasn't turned out well for me was when I didn't finish melting the butter as the recipe says.  Enjoy and don't be afraid to substitute ingredients based on allergies or kitchen shortages.

I made this recipes as is.  I think that next times I will make some of the changes people suggested,  The basic recipe is fine.  Just need to add some more flavor to it.
UPDATE: I actually made these for my girlfriends on my wedding day and I added cinnamon to the mixtue and an additional teaspoon of sugar and they were delicious! (especially with the mimosas!).  Now I need to make them for my hubby!

Easy! They are crispy just to forewarn and they are not super sweet, but if you're eating with syrup, I think they are perfect!

Very good waffles.  I too added another tsp. of vanilla and tbsp. sugar.  My kids like them a little sweeter.  I did take the advice of another and separated the eggs and I don't think that made much of a difference.  I am planning to make them this morning for my kids and sleepover friends.

Made these for dinner.  My 11-year-old son, who is a connoisseur of anything made from batter, gave them 5 stars.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Yummy with maple syrup.

I cooked these waffles because of the fantastic rating they got. I was very very disappointed. My husband said he felt like he was eating a wet sock. But really, they were too salty, dense. I think the fact that you don't have to fold in the egg whites should be a big red flag. Also, we added extra sugar to offset all the salt and baking powder, but it didn't help enough. We threw out the rest of the batter.   Still looking for the perfect waffles....

These were just what I was looking for! Slightly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I added about 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and only used half the salt. Thanks for a GREAT recipe, Megan... kids loved these!

This is the easiest, tastiest waffle I've ever eaten.  And being the first waffle I've ever made I was incredibly impressed by this recipe.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect!  I think I will add chocolate chips or cinnamon next time.

My husband and I have been using this recipe for 2 years.  Over the years we have changed it a bit...using whole wheat flour and adding pecans, and cinnamon.  We also use it to make pancakes as well.  Such a great recipe!!!

Great waffles!  I followed the recipe as is, but added 2 additional tablespoons of sugar.  I ended up with 5 large waffles.  Leftovers heated great in the toaster oven.

I just made these for our Christmas breakfast and they were PERFECT!!  I separated my eggs to I could whip my egg whites until soft peaks then added the yokes and the rest of the wet ingredients (I added an extra 1/4 cup of milk because it was pretty thick) I also cut the baking powder by 1/2 tsp.  If you don't have baking powder you can use baking soda and cream of tarter(I ran out out of "powder" but the conversion of the other two worked perfectly)

These were very good. I beat the egg whites and folded them in like other reviewers suggested. They were nice and fluffy and a bit crispy but not super crispy. I will definitely make these again - maybe even tomorrow morning :D

I have made this recipe numerous times and I was recently reading some of the reviews.  I noticed some users mentionning that there is too much baking soda in the recipe.  No wonder they didn't like the taste ... It calls for baking POWDER.

I really enjoy this recipe!!!

These turned out quite yummy. I did add the extra cinnamon like some other reviewers suggested, and it added a nice dimension of flavor... they almost tasted like french toast. The texture was good too. My husband doesn't usually like it when I make waffles because they get hard really quickly, but these were just soft enough to enjoy. I'll be making these again!

Quick and easy recipe.  They were good, but not as fluffy as I like, however that's probably because the egg whites aren't beaten separately which you could do to increase the fluffiness and I will try that next time.  All-round good waffles though!

These were really good waffles Megan.  My grandmother and I made 2 batches for our family over the Christmas holidays and everyone who ate them said they were good.  We added a little vanilla for some extra flavor.  Will definitely made these again.

Very good!  My 4-year-old said, "they don't even need syrup."  Easy recipe.  I didn't warm the milk but saw why I should have... the melted butter started to solidify/clump when I added the cold milk.  So I'll warm the milk next time.  The waffles turned out great anyway.

This recipe is quite easy if you are out of bisquick, but not as tasty as the mix! I thought it needed sugar, or less salt. My huspand however, devoured 2 1/2 waffles promptly!

These were not good at all.  Extremely bland.  I had to coat them with butter and syrup in order to have any taste.  I would've been better off to buy the frozen ones at the grocery store.

I thought this waffle recipie was one of the best I have had. And, my waffles did turn out crispy. For the one that said hers didn't, you might try and leave it in the iron longer.

Perfect recipe but my motivation for reviewing is to point out that the most helpful critical review by AcademiaNut reveals their glowingly obvious mistake in her observation that maybe "she used too much BAKING SODA". Ding ding ding! No where in the recipe does it call for baking soda so I can only assume that some people don't realize that baking soda and baking powder are two distinctly different animals! She did mention other reviews with the same "problem". This recipe may have otherwise been a perfect 5 star!!!

worked perfectly, all i took from elsewhere was to lay the hot waffle on a paper towel for moisture to make em crispier. Perfect as a base recipe, ladle out a serving at a time and stir in your topping (flavor chips, jelly) or just eat them as is (or use them for a sandwich ;))  Keeping this one!

Loved it! Second time trying a waffle recipe and this one beats the other one hands down. I mixed everything by hand as I didn't want to over mix and they turned out lovely. Liked the flavour and the fluffiness. This recipe is a keeper :)

Received a waffle iron for Christmas so I looked for a recipe. This one was okay but having never made waffles before I was taken back by how much they expanded. I found that they were very fluffy like a pancake and not very crispy at all. They certainly didn't taste like anything special but turned out pretty good for my first attempt. I will definitely be looking for a recipe that is crispier.

These were pretty good. They were very fluffy. So thick, I had to add another 1/4 cup of milk to the mixture... And it was still fluffy! I only could eat two of these 3 inch diameter waffles. I only added 1 tbsp of sugar because, let's face it - it's made up with syrup and toppings later.

The family liked them. I use buttermilk instead of milk, makes for a much better waffle. 
I only got 6 waffles. I am not sure how large the original waffle iron is of the recipe creator, but using a Cuisinart waffle iron only yields 6 waffles.

Wow these waffles are perfect!  I followed the recipe ingredients exactly, except I sift the flour and baking powder.  If people are complaining that these are too salty, it may be from clumpy baking powder.  Make sure you sift and mix all the dry ingredients well so the powder and salt are evenly distributed.  Another tip is to make sure you know how to use your waffle iron.  I recently was gifted one, and never made them before so i made this batter, poured it on the iron and promptly closed it, resulting in batter gushing out.  The trick is not to overflow and to leave the iron open after pouring on the batter so the bottom side cooks a little first, reducing splatter and gushing onto your counters!

This recipe is easy and delicious. I used the exact ingredients. The only change I made was to use another reviewer's suggestion of mixing it in a blender, beating the eggs first, then added the remaining liquid ingredients. Then slowly added the dry ingredients in batches. The waffles were light and crispy. I will never use the box mix again for waffles at my house.

I used my blender as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a 4 waffle, waffle iron.  Was able to make 3 batches or 12 waffles.  My family loved them.  Will have to make more just to freeze for a quick breakfast.

I made these as per the recipe, and they were great.  Don't know where people say bland.  I did add some raisins and cranraisins, also I did use 1 Tablespoon of vanilla, rather than 1 teaspoon.  No conspiracy worked great as stated.

This was the basic waffle recipe I've been looking for.  Makes great waffles.  I did sift my dry ingredients and beat my eggs really well before mixing it all together.  For me it made five full size waffles ( or 20 quarters).

I made 1.5 recipes and it yielded 16 single waffles or 8 double. I am on a sodium reduced diet, I used 3 tsps baking powder, 3/4 tsp baking soda and omitted the salt. I added 1/4 tsp cinnamon and halved the butter as well, enjoyed by my family.

Great recipe! I made two batches. The first batch I made exactly as recipe stated and they were wonderful. I made a second batch (because I love to experiment) and added 2 additional tbs of sugar and an additional tsp of vanilla. We loved them even more, however I am always generous with my vanilla so that addition suited us better. I doubled the recipe for my family of 5 and froze the left overs for quick do-it-yourself breakfasts for the kids. I have read several reviews some complaining of too much salt and others complaining of a lack of crispiness. Please make sure you are using baking powder, not baking soda. Also, I always use unsalted butter. Real butter comes salted or unsalted, so adjust the salt according to the type of butter used. My waffles were crispy (and I love them  very crispy), but the key to that maybe having a well heated waffle iron.

Wow, so delicious! I doubled the sugar based on other reviews, but kept everything else the same. On the side I had regular and blueberry syrups as well as strawberries with confectionary sugar. These were just perfect. BTW, reading through the negative reviews, almost every one of them is a complaint about too salty and too much baking soda. It's baking POWDER people! Such a shame so many unfair reviews due to people who can't follow directions. Anyway, I have a waffle iron that makes 3 small waffles at a time. My Dad ate 14 and I had 6. Now I need a nap. Wonderful recipe, highly recommended. Thanks Megan!

Very easy to make. I followed one review and mixed everything in my blender. I will definitely use this recipe if I don't have bisquick on hand otherwise, the mix works just as well. I also increased the vanilla flavoring. Very good recipe.

my family thought they were 5 stars. Since the recipe is way easier than our favorite recipe, I'll be making it again. These are probably less calories and fat too, since my other recipe takes a whole cup of butter!

These were crispy as soon as they came out of the waffle iron but lost their crispiness after they cooled on the rack. My husband said they only tasted okay and my kids only ate a small portion (and they love to eat waffles). I found them to be dense, heavy and cake-like. The only thing I did different was that I substituted lactose free milk for regular. I don't think I'll be making this again. Thanks for sharing, anyway!

Great basic waffles.  Easy to prepare.  Good flavor.  Not as much work and not as bland as some of the egg white recipes. Double if you have very hungry kids.

My first time making waffles from scratch!! This was a very cool recipe because it was simple and easy! tasted yummy! and i ate the leftovers cold too and they were still so good. :-)   Oh, on the salt i took it easy and did maybe half the teaspoon maybe a dash or two more.

This recipe turned out great. I accidently added an entire stick of melted butter, but it turned out even better!

Just made these this morning. Its the perfect simple and quick waffle recipe. I didn't feel they needed any "doctoring up," even though they probably would be just as delicious if I did. I cooked the waffles on my George Foreman Grill and it made 4 giant waffles.

This is a crisp waffle but its very bland.  I followed the recipe exactly and they just didn't have the flavor I was looking for in a homemade waffle.  After tasting the first one, I added some brown suger and more vanilla and it helped.  I like this sites Wonderful waffles they have a great flavor.  Also, I should have seperated the eggs to make them fluffier :)

My kids LOVE these waffles! I make them in big batches and freeze them, so they can make a homemade version of toaster waffles on busy mornings. Adding a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg is a nice way to spice up this recipe too.

They just were not that great, they seem to be missing in flavor. I followed everything to the letter, and added a touch of cinnamon, but not very good. I will try it one more time before scratching it off my recipe list.

These were wonderful! They were so nice and fluffy. I doubled the sugar as many people stated and maybe next time I might add a bit less salt. Even though they were great I think next time I might leave out one egg or use use one large egg and add a bit more margarine, because it had a bit of a egg taste to me. Adding some vanilla is also a great idea for some nice flavour.

This was so, so good! I like it better than a lot of recipes I have tried.  It was quick and easy, and has a really good flavor because of the butter.  It's not too rich though, which makes it great once you add syrup. I used cinnamon syrup (also from allrecipes) and it tasted just about perfect.

Yum!  I have made this as stated, and used self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose flour, salt, and baking powder.  Either way, the disappear faster than I can make them!!

These were good. They were super dry and barely browned, but I am guessing that is my waffle maker. The flavour is really good though. I will definately try this recipe again when I get a new waffle maker. Maybe my husband will believe me now that I need a new one :)

Utterly fantastic.  However, I suggest that you use the metric weight for the flour to get consistent results.  When I started using this recipe a few years ago, I was very new to cooking and baking.  Always measure your flour by weight.

This is a good, quick and easy waffle recipe. I add a little more milk and sugar to it. This is my go-to recipe for waffles. It makes about 4-5 Belgian-style waffles. Great recipe!

These were very very good. I did make some changes to them. I cut the salt down to about 1/2 a teaspoon since some reviewers said they were salty. I added extra vanilla and some cinnamon. Finally, I added some fresh blueberries. These may be the best waffles I've ever had!

These were delicious.  I did as a few others suggested and cut the salt in half and added 1 tsp of cinnamon.  I would skip the cinnamon though i think if i planned on doing strawberries and whipped cream which is exactly how i am going to serve them next time.

Exactly what i was looking for! This is a great base recipe ..you can add anything to it and it will turn out great, so I dont understand why people have to say that its bland and plain ...its called classic for a reason!!

Very easy to mix up, cooked up smelling delicious, looking crisp and beautiful, and tasted fabulous. Got a "good" rating from my 3-yr-old so that is a 5 star. Didn't change a thing except reduced a little salt.

I don't know... I used half whole wheat half white and replaced the butter with canola oil, so perhaps I shouldn't judge. But that's a pretty standard replacement for me and it does not usually affect results. The batter was a bit gummy and the end product was a kind of tough consistency. I did not stir much at all so I don't think that's it.

Excellent! I substituted the warm milk for warm soy milk and the flour for whole wheat. They were fluffy and crispy on the outside, perfect! Next time i would use a little less salt, half a teaspoon would do, thank you!

The texture of this batter is perfect for waffles.  The flavor is pretty bland, though.  The second time I added 2 t. lemon juice to the milk to give more of a buttermilk flavor and they were excellent!

BEST. WAFFLES. EVER. After many years of Eggo waffles and different premade mixes, I decided it was time to make REAL waffles. These are literally the best things I have ever tasted! However, being the kind of person I am, I used applesauce instead of butter, only 1/8 t. of salt, honey instead of sugar, and whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose. With a it of real maple syrup on the side, it turned out to be a fantastic breakfast. Definitely making them again!

i halved the recipe and made these waffles with a tablespoon of flax seeds and three tablespoons of water instead of an egg.  as per a recommendation, i used a bit more sugar, butter, and vanilla as well.  they were very pleasing with butter and maple syrup. thank you.

These were a great Mother's Day treat.  My son and I made them together.  We took the suggestion of folding in the egg whites.  I wish I had some berries or bananas to add to the batter, but they were very good non-the-less.  These were tremendously better than the bland recipe that came with the waffle iron.  I will definitely make this recipe again.

I will use this recipe every time, from now on - replacing an old recipe.  It worked beautifully.  The only thing I will do differently the next time is try the extra vanilla mentioned in another review.

Definitely a keeper.  This quick and yummy recipe is very popular with all of the teenagers coming in and out of our house almost every weekend morning. Some eat these with Nutella, some eat them with butter and syrup, and some eat them with whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  They are yummy in every way!  :)

The only change I made was to seperate the eggs and whip the whites to a soft peak and then fold in at the end, this made them light and fluffy, perfectly delicious!  We added some chocolate chips when the were in the iron and that was great as well, tey also freeze well so you reheat in a jiffy.

I came across this recipe today, and in about 1 minutes we were eating delicious waffles! Easy and simple. Next time, I'll try to substitute white sugar with brown sugar to beat the taste of baking powder, but anyway it is a wonderful recipe. Thank you!

These waffles are so light and flavorful. Please don't skip the step of warming the milk it is a way to incorporate all the ingredients without overmixing. If I have fresh lemon I like to add the zest to the batter for more flavor and I always add about 3 tbsp more sugar.

Waffles had a wonderful, light taste, but they didn't rise as high as I expected (based on the pictures I saw), thus the four-star rating. I took the advice, and blended in the beaten egg whites last, and the batter was just filled with air!  I'll definitely be making these again, and hubby is thrilled that I doubled the recipe for him to have homemade waffles in the freezer!

Made these as a double batch and froze most of them.  They reheated very nicely in our toaster.  Threw some blueberries into the last of the batter and they came out quite yummy as well.

Amazing waffle recipe! I had to double the recipe for the 6 of us. I also added extra sugar (a total of 7 tablespoons) and tripled the vanilla. I also took the advice of others, separated the eggs and added the whites at the end. So light and fluffy! Everyone loved these.

I received a waffle iron/griddle for my wedding 15 years ago.  I used to make waffles every Saturday for my family, until my kitchen flooded and my griddle (being kept under the sink) was damaged due to being immersed in water.  This was several years ago.  I *finally* got a new waffle iron and was excited to make waffles again...  I used this recipe based on the rating and the comments, but rather than make changes right off, I decided to do the recipe EXACTLY AS WRITTEN so that I would be able to do a fair review.  I followed this recipe exactly as written, and the waffles were very crispy and fluffy and wonderful EXCEPT I found them to be TOO SALTY. So I could only give 4 stars.  I imagine if one was to reduce the salt by about 1/2 it would be absolutely perfect, so all in all a really great waffle recipe!

If you are deciding to make these waffles or Waffles 1 the main difference is this one has a more buttery taste. But these waffles are very good way better then frozen waffles or Bis-quick.

I'm on a kick of trying new recipes so I tried this one over my normal waffles. I'll stick to my normal recipe. These were easy to whip up, but lacked in the flavor department and for some reason took FOREVER to cook in my waffle iron. I also had to add more milk just to be able to pour them onto the iron. Next.

So tasty, I will never buy a mix again. These were perfect to my taste of what a perfect waffle can be, crispy and a little fluffy. I know everyone's different when it comes to their likes, but for me and my family and everyone I've forced them on, they have loved them. This is definitely going into my little book o' brunch recipes.

These are the best waffles by far, and you can easily add any type of fruit to the batter.  Only change that you should make from the recipe is to add at least 1/2 cup more milk if not more.  It turns them from dry and crumbly to crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.

Perfect. Absolutely effin perfect. Best waffles I've ever made. Will be perfect to add additions to, as well - simple, classic taste, but would be awesome with bananas and nuts, chocolate chips, anything I can think of. I only had cheap pancake syrup, so I threw it in the nuker w/ some real butter and a dash of vanilla and it was OMG good. My 8 month old ate almost 1/2 a waffle by herself! Few things make me regret my gastric bypass 4 years ago but this recipe makes me want to eat like a fat girl again.

Based on other reviews, I made the following changes: 1/2 tsp salt, 4 TBSP sugar, 2 Tsp Vanilla, and approx 1/2 tsp cinnamon. I also separated the eggs, whipped the whites, and added the whipped whites last. YUMMY. It made 5 waffles. Smelled great, tasted great...just all kinds of yummy-lisciousness

I made this "as is" and was not impressed. It was bland and heavy. I made it again adding a Tbsp of white vinegar to the milk, added a tsp of cinnamon and following others advice, increased sugar to 5 Tbsp and increased vanilla to 2 Tbsp. It definitely was not too sweet but I still was not impressed as it was very heavy. If I use it again I will probably separate the eggs, beat in the egg yolk, whip the whites in a separate bowl and fold them in to see if it lightens the texture. Honestly, I am hard to please with waffle recipes but I miss the down South "Waffle Ho*se" flavor and texture of their waffles and want to reproduce that!

These are consistantly golden, fluffy, perfect. I substituded 1 individual pk of stevia (the size of tea sweetner pks you get in restaurants). Made the waffles sugar free. They were outstanding. Thank you for this amazing recipe.

Good batter, but this is a PANCAKE batter, NOT a waffle batter.  Disappointing when you're wanting waffles.  :(  Too much vanilla, too.

I loved the fluffy waffles. I seperated the eggs and whisked the whites and folded them in at the end. Recipe made a little too much for me and my boyfriend, would split in half next time. Served with frozen berries stewed with a little water and suger and blended till smooth. Very good.

Pretty good! I think alot of it has to do with the iron you are using, I dont particularley like my waffle iron as I dont get the texture I am going for. But the waffle was very good. Im sure if I had the ideal waffle iron I would get the waffle house type of waffle that I am seeking, using this recipe

Bland, flat, very dense waffle and no, I did not overmix the batter.  Also used a brand new container of baking powder so I know it is not my methods.  Have been baking/cooking since the age of 12 (~30 years) so I do know what I am doing.  Followed recipe as written with the exception of adding 1/2 whole wheat flour and beating eggs separately and folding in egg whites. One of the worst waffle recipes I have tried off this site!!  The search continues for THE waffle.

I just purchased my first Belgian Waffle maker and of course, came to Allrecipes for help.  This recipe is wonderful.  I did lessen the salt to half the amount in the recipe and I separated the eggs as I read in some of the reviews that this produces a lighter waffle.  All that taken into account, the results were delicious, light and crispy.  We couldn't wait till morning so we had them for supper!! Thanks for a scrumptious waffle, Megan

I just made these waffles and my family said these are the best waffles they have had in a long time!  I read the other reviews and ended taking some of the suggestions noted.  I added another Tbsp of sugar, an extra tsp of vanilla and 2 tsp of Cinnamon.  These waffles are very good - we will definitely make them again.

This is a 10 all the way, i did add some more sugar cuz i like sweet and i did add a little cinnamon, perfect.  I did beat the eggs before i added milk to incorporate some air in them yumm-o!!  ETA: these freeze so well, i popped them in the toaster and just as good as when i first made them.  These are a 10, i plan to make these every week and freeze them and eat a yummy breakfast everyday!!

I followed the recipe exactly and the final product was great if not better than any other recipes I've used before. SO SIMPLE and fast, no mucking around with beating eggs separately and all that. 
Crispy on the outside and fluffy in the middle. 
I was pleasantly surprised by ending up with 7 serving instead of 5. Yeh... more for me. I used the 5 heart, flower shaped waffle iron. 
Well use again in the future and probably will tweek it a bit just for the sake of doing so with flavourings and such. 
Thank for sharing.

These waffles are sooo good!
Oh my god I love them!
I had been experimenting with diferent recipes but I think I found my favorite. They are nice and crispy just how I like them and they're soft on the inside. I was able to get 8 square waffles from it and I added little chocolate melts to two of them which really made them special. Other than that, I only upped the vanilla to a 1/2 tbsp and I had to use and egg replacer because we ran out of eggs. I topped them with lite syrup, whip cream, berries, and nuts. My sister and me were so happy. I'm freezing the rest for my parents.

Very easy and tasty recipe.  I did one and a half of this recipe to make enough for my hungry family.  I added fresh blueberries to the batter too.  I also increased the sugar by one tablespoon to help the crunch of the waffles.  We served ours with homemade whipped cream and fresh berries.  YUMMM!!

These turned out very nicely for us. I veganized them by using soy milk (in place of cow's milk) and flaxseed/water mix (in place of the eggs). I also made them a bit lower fat (maybe even fat free!) by using applesauce (blueberry applesauce to be exact) in place of the melted butter.

This is definitely going to be our go-to recipe for waffles from now on. Thanks!

Wonderful and easy. :-) I mixed the dry ingredients together about a week prior and so it was easy this morning to just dump them in a bowl and put in the wet ingredients. Wonderful!

Wonderful! I did alter it a bit, following what some other reviewers did - I like waffles sweet, so I added a couple of extra tablespoons of sugar and I added an extra teaspoon of vanilla. I also replaced the butter with 1/3 c of applesauce and I separated the eggs, folding in the whites last. These were delicious! I'd definitely make them again! (Norwegian Waffles from this site are my other favorite!)

I made these this morning for my children and they were wonderul. We like them crispier, so I kept them in the waffle iron a bit longer. I made a double batch so I would have left overs to frezze. I added chocolate chips upon my son's request and also cinnamon & 6 Tbsp sugar.

Yummy! I have to cook eggless so I used EnerG and they were great. Also, I used buttermilk and instead of vanilla used maple syrup. They were fluffy, and crisp, but not hard on top. Perfect! The kids LOVE them!

Great waffles.  Stayed nice and moist.  I substituted half the butter with oil, cut the salt in half, and put about 3/4 tsp baking soda in place of one tsp baking powder for more initial lift in the batter.

I just made these this morning for breakfast. They were good! I did use 1/2 whole wheat flour and I had to use almond extract because Im out of vanilla. The batter was pretty thick so I had to add a little extra milk. Turned out nice and served these with the supreme strawberry topping from this site.

I LOVE this!  With one modification.  I use about half whole-wheat flour.  I make a quadruple batch and then freeze then and toast them for breakfast every morning.  I think they are even BETTER this way than fresh!

These waffles were ok, but not the greatest. They had a funny after taste. I suggest cutting down on the baking powder and salt. I added some cinnamon, but it still tasted as though something else was missing - favor wise. Also, the waffles came out very soggy, but that may have been something I did. I give this recipe a C+.

These were VERY good. There are only 2 of us, so I only made 1/2 the recipe. I changed the recipe a little bit, I only had Medium eggs on hand, so I used used 1 whole egg and 1 egg white. I beat them together until they were very light in color and a bit frothy, then I added the other liquid ingredients. My waffle iron is bigger, so we only got 3, but for the 2 of us, it was perfect!

This is a perfect waffle recipe!  My oldest son made them yesterday (May 18) for my birthday breakfast.  He doubled the recipe and it made 6 full-sized waffles.  He added 1-1/3 cups chocolate chips to the batter, and that made them even yummier!  A great way to satisfy a chocolate craving!  I agree with other reviewers about making extras and freezing them for a later meal.  Then all you have to do is pop them in the toaster or microwave to heat them up.  Definitely less expensive than buying frozen waffles at the grocery store!

Not a bad recipe, but nothing special.  I was not happy with the vanilla in the recipe; that flavor was too strong.   I am still looking for a recipe that is well balanced in flavor and not too much work.

This is my first time making waffles and I must have done something wrong. I followed the directions exactly and they turned out thick, heavy and pancake-like.

I must have done something wrong, though I can't figure out what.  The waffles were very heavy and dense and tasted like pancakes.  We needed a ton of syrup just to be able to swallow them!

My hubby made these for dinner tonight, and they were really good! He did use egg beaters, instead of eggs, and splenda, instead of sugar. I believe he said he also used skim milk. They were very fluffy and yummy!

Although the waffles asked for no magic to be added, they did seem to contain some magic, the magic of great taste that is!

These were really good!  I took two recommedations from others:  1) separate the egg whites and yolks.  With a hand mixer, beat the yolks and the other liquid ingredients together, and then beat it together with the dry ingredients. In a separate dish, beat the egg whites until thick. FOLD the egg whites into the rest of the mixture and you're ready to go!  I think this did make a difference, making the waffles nice and thick.  2) Put the waffles on paper towel for a minute when finished cooking to absorb the moisture.  I had never done that before and I think that helped too! I did make one other change, and put in an extra tsp of vanilla.  These turned out great and the flavor was wonderful!  Will definitely make again!

YUM!  wonderful, makes quite a nice batch in my small waffler.  I like to add a splash of almond extract to the batter, lather some real butter on them and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Great recipe.

We liked this recipe.  I added cinnamon for flavor.  I also had to add more milk, which was my own fault because I was too lazy to measure butter and consequently shorted the wet ingredients, I think  They were yummy with butter and real maple syrup.

After trying five different waffle recipes on Allrecipes.com, I finally found one I LOVE! Made a wonderful Christmas morning breakfast. I added 1 tsp. of orange extract and increased the white sugar to 4 tbsp. (Based on recipe for five servings.)

This is a great recipe with one minor change. Instead of beating the whole egg with the milk and butter, I only mixed the egg yolks and then mixed into the batter. The egg whites I set aside and then beat them separately until stiff and then folded into the batter. This made the waffles fluffier.

Ok, after years of trying to find a good waffle recipe, I have found it!! Made some for a lunch treat for the kids and they all want to give it 5 stars-so with 5 kids, that is like 25 stars-lol! They are crspy on the outside and tender on the inside. I didn't have vanilla, so added cinnamon and they were still tasty! My waffle maker makes 4 large size waffles at once (in one big square) and I was able to refill the waffle maker 3 times, resulting in 12 nice sized waffles for us. I will double or triple this recipe and make a huge batch to put up in the freezer! Thanks!!

My husband is a home builder and breakfast is very important to him, therefore he tends to be a bit picky. After eating one of these waffles he told our 8 month old son that he needed to grow up fast so he could enjoy some of this cookin'! That's a keeper! Thanks

Really tasty, but I did add a few things. First of all I doubled the recipe & added 1tsp. cinnamon & 3/4 tsp. nutmeg, I also added just under a 1/4 cup each of wheat bran & wheat germ & finally a 1/2 cup orange juice.
Just before closing the lid I added a few blueberries. Enjoyed by all :)

So good! I made these this morning for my daughter, while my husband is out of town and boy did he miss out! These were great.  To make them a little healthier, I used skim milk and a butter subsituite that has no trans fat.  They still came out great.  Next time, I will use the suggestion of using 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour so that they are even more healthier.  I will also vacum seal and freeze the extra, Thanks Megan!

These waffles turned out great. I did substitute canola oil for the butter, however. They turned out light with a slightly crisp outside, just the way I like them. Thanks!

The entire family enjoy these waffles. I did follow someone elses suggestion about separating the egg whites and adding them later.  Great idea.
Everyone should give these a try, you will be pleasently surprised.

This recipe made crisp waffles on the outside while being soft on the inside. I reduced the salt to only 1/2 tsp. for I thought it asked for too much salt. Great flavour & great recipe.

This is an excellent "classic" waffle recipe!!  I've never made waffles from scratch before, but these turned out great!  The waffles aren't anything extravagant, but if you're looking for a basic, quality recipe this one is really nice (quick, easy, and tastes great!).

These are really fast and easy.  I don't even heat the milk or melt the butter.  I just put it allin a bowl and mix it.  I make these at least once a week and everyone loves them.  Try adding chocolate chips for the kids too!!!  Yummy!

These waffles did not turn out "crispy."  I used this recipe because I ran out of store bought mix.  The waffles were OK, but next time I will just use a mix and add to it.

I made this today for six people, including three teenagers, so I multiplied the quantities by 50% and had just enough.  I also served some eggs to go with the waffles (served with mixed berries, maple syrup and whipping cream).  I also took the suggestion from the comments to add more sugar and vanilla extract.  I made the waffles in a Cuisinart 4x waffle maker set on "4" and they turned out very well. Much easier than the traditional way that uses yeast.  This recipe is a keeper in my books - not buying any pre-made mixes anymore.

this was a delicious recipe, easy, off the waffle maker with ease, crispy, much better than the box to make. Took the advice of a couple of viewers, believe me it made the difference. Passed it unto all my girls!
I had to tweak the recipe a little. I used a 1/4 cup sugar, less salt and a stick of butter (unsalted).
Magan, this is better than the box! Excellent!

Nice and easy to make.  We all enjoyed these for breakfast with sliced strawberries, bananas and whipped cream. The only thing I do differently is I mixed all the dry ingredients first then the wet and mix the two together until well mixed. Then I pour it directly onto the waffle iron. It was really good and added some cinnamon for flavor.

Very good waffle recipe. These waffles turned out buttery and perfect. I made some whipped cream and fresh berries to serve on top.  I saw a comment that said it tasted of baking soda, so I wanted to comment that that is probably where they made their mistake. The recipe calls for baking powder NOT baking soda. I really love good vanilla, so I also went a little heavy handed. I used real butter and I added  a Tbsp extra sugar as well. My daughter went nuts over these. I made them for her 12th birthday breakfast.   Really good stuff.

These waffles are AWESOME. 

To up the awesome factor:
*Do not make the mistake of using baking soda instead of baking powder. They are not the same thing and are not interchangeable. 
*Add more sugar - I used 5 T
*Add more vanilla - I used about 1 T
* Mix in a heaping spoonful of malted milk powder with the other dry ingredients 
* Add in some maple extract for kicks and giggles

When I tweaked this recipe, I made the best waffles I have ever had. Omm nom nommm...

this recipe is awesome. some people have said it was terrible or not having enough flavor....all you have to do is adjust a few things to your liking. This does not make it an awful recipe...peoples tastes are just different. AND...to the reviewer AcidemiaNut...there is a big difference between baking SODA and baking POWDER yours didnt turn out right because you didnt use POWDER. I'd even venture to say that the other reviewers who say this is a terrible recipe, or h had major issues with it...probably did the same thing.

These were pretty good. I'm not a waffle connoisseur, but I'd tried a "yeast waffles" recipe before this one, and I thought these were better. I made them exactly as written, and they turned out great.

I was sorely disappointed...even though they puffed up nice and thick, they were heavy and flavourless.  I even had added fresh blueberries...won't make these again.

I followed the recipe to the T with the following exceptions: I used 1 1/3 C milk (I like a less dense waffle) and I added about 1 t Cinnamon for a hint of cinnamon flavor and aroma.  The only thing I would change would be to add another T of sugar, only because I like a little sweeter waffle.  Overall great recipe that will be my new Go-To waffle recipe!

We made these this am.  We adjust 1 of the 2 cups of flour to be: 1/4 Cup Old fashion Oats/Oatmeal and 3/4 cup whole wheat flour.  It is just as yummy.  This is the only recipe that we use for morning waffles.

We had these for supper tonight - one of those great "breakfast for dinner" meals!  They mixed up quick and easy and turned out perfect. My only complaint is that the recipe says it makes 10-12 waffles - so based on that I cut the recipe in half as it's just the two of us.  I only got 3 waffles, so I have no idea what size waffle they are talking about.  It was just enough since I had plenty of other breakfast foods to go with them.  At least I now know I would have to double this recipe to get a dozen waffles.  I will use this recipe again for sure.

Stephanie's variation on this recipe makes it 5 stars! I'm a breakfast fanatic and these are the best waffles, bar none, that I've ever made...or eaten! (I don't recommend whole wheat flour or whole wheat blends as it makes them a bit heavy). Stick to "all purpose flour". Thanks, again, to Stephanie whose variation is below. 

{Stephanie's Variant:
My family liked this recipes I did make some alterations to the mix, I add 5 Tbls of sugar and 1 1/4 stick of real butter (melted) and about 3 Tbls of vanilla I know from past mistakes when cooking other recipes the bread didn't come out to sweet. This is a nice sweet I know it sounds like alot of sugar but it all balances out.} I will definately use this recipe again!

Great. Took some advise from the comments and used 5 tbsp sugar, stick of butter and triple vanilla. Delish. Kids loved.

I got a waffle maker for my birthday yesterday. I wanted a simple recipe to try it out with as the recipe that came with the waffle maker involved yeast and I wanted waffles RIGHT NOW, not when the yeast decided to proof. This was the first time I've ever made waffles and I really don't think I have to search any further for a different recipe, this one is a keeper for sure! 

I took suggestions from other reviewers and added a bit more sugar (four tablespoons rather than two) and I beat the egg whites separately and folded them into the batter. You'd think I've been making waffles all my life! They came out fluffy and golden brown. They do go soggy very quickly though -eat immediately! I'm going to try freezing and toasting them. I may never have to buy another box of Eggos again! I'm thinking of making country gravy with fried chicken and waffles next. I can hardly wait!

Very quick and easy recipe. I did change things up a bit by substituting one cup of regular flour with 100% Whole Wheat Flour.  My family really enjoyed this modification because it seemed to add something extra, yet didn't make them too "heavy" with whole grain.

This recipe is awesome! Much better than store bought mix.  Makes fluffy and flavourful waffles.  I swap out all purpose flour for whole wheat and they still turn out great.

I followed the recipe with a few modifications I increased the sugar to 3 teaspoons and the vanilla to 2 teaspoons. I separated the eggs and just before starting to cook the waffles I whipped the whites to a stiff foam and folded them in to the batter. I served them with a large ring of whipped cream around the sides and the center full of strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. everyone commented on the taste of the waffels. didn't say much about the topping.  a great recipe.

I make these exactly as the recipe says, only we cut out 1/4 to 1/2 the sugar, because we eat our waffles with syrup and/or whipped cream. They're delicious! They freeze also freeze well: freeze on a tray until solid, then just wrap in plastic wrap and reheat in the toaster when you want them. Delicious breakfast, no mess :)

This is the best recipe I've found so far. I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because it has room for improvement. I think that whipping the egg whites separately and folding them in at the end is a must. I also add a little cinnamon but that's just my personal preference.

Tried this recipe this morning with one addition; bacon!! I like the precooked Hormel (just faster and doesn't make a mess) that is microwaved.  I put 1/2 c in the center of a 4 squared waffle cooker, and added about 3 pieces (broken up) on the top of the uncooked waffle dough, put the top down and just cooked it for about 2 minutes.  The bacon is crushed into the middle of the waffle and it just like the way my parents made it when I was growing up.  Takes me back to childhood.... butter & syrup, yummy.

Basic, easy, and good! I made a double batch for my family. They loved them. I followed the recipe exactly just doubled everything. They were good with or without syrup. I will definitely make these again.

I hadn't made waffles in a long time, but when we moved recently I found my waffle iron and got excited. This recipe is perfect. I did make one minor change to the ingredients by using melted extra-virgin coconut oil in place of the butter. I mixed this up in my Ninja Master Prep and then poured directly into the hot waffle iron. They cooked up perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside -just like the name implies. The flavor was fantastic as well. This recipe made exactly twelve 4x4" square waffles. My family of six demanded a second batch. :)

Delicious! I used a lot of the previous suggestions, and have one of my own.  I used my blender, although my food processor might have done a better job. I did add extra sugar and butter. I also added plenty of vanilla. It did not seem to need these additions, I just wanted them to be super special. I set them on paper towel before serving (to avoid soggy waffle). After making six or so like this, I added a couple of crumbled slices of bacon to the batter. What a hit! Versatile recipe.

Made a half recipe because I only had one egg.  Worked out perfectly.  My daughters said the waffles taste like cake...not sure if that's the healthiest thing, but for a treat, I was very happy with the recipe.

The batter had the consistency of egg or tuna salad. No idea how that happened, but I wasn't going to put something that had a legit solid shape on my waffle iron.

We thought this was great!

We had to substitute some ingredients for our niece who is allergic to milk.  So we used almond milk and lactose-free margarine and it still was fantastic! We are looking forward to making it again exactly as the recipe says.

I doubled the sugar and used a stick of butter.  These waffles were awesome! Just as easy as using a mix but taste was so much better! Great recipe!

I love this recipe, but afterwards I used a little bit different ingredients.  I used one cup of whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 cup of all purpose flour, and 1/2 cup of quinoa flour.  I also used melted coconut oil instead of butter, and used one tablespoon of sugar and one tablespoon of stevia, and added some cinnamon.  They came out really light, fluffy and yummy.  Another time I added two tablespoons of vinegar to the warm milk which caused the waffles to be even lighter and fluffier, and taste a bit buttermilkish.  When we aren't eating up all the waffles at once I take the remaining ones and immediately put them on a plate and pop them into the freezer.  Once they are frozen I put them in a freezer bag.  When we want them again we take them out of the freezer and heat them up in the toaster over.  They come out just as warm, crunchy, and yummy as they did before.  Everything I use is always organic which seems to keep us very healthy, and the quinoa flour gives us additional protein since we are ovo-lacto vegetarians.

This was even better than expected. I just added some chocolate chips but I think it was the vanilla that really set it off. Will definitely make it again.

These were great! Followed to the T.  They were light and crisper! I made mine in the blender, blended the wet then added dry ingredients and blended until mixed.  It makes the pouring and clean up easier.

This recipe is OK. Way Too much baking powder and not enough sugar.  I do not like sweet anything, but this really needs more sugar.  Also, not enough vanilla extract.  I recommend letting the waffle rest on a cookie grid before plating, to let the steam escape as the plates will otherwise become very soggy.  I will definitely make a few alterations the next time I make this recipe.

For those who are gluten free, I substitute a GF flour in place of the flour in the recipe and change nothing else and it's fantastic! Great texture - soft and dense. The batter is thick and more milk may or may not be required depending on where you live. With the batter, scoop a ladle full out and gentle press the top of your waffle machine on it and it's fine.

Delicious and so easy! Made it in the blender, whole stick of butter, upped the vanilla, used brown sugar instead of white, and added in cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves. Light and fluffy! Thanks for the great recipe!

These waffles were delicious! The whole family loved them.  My only changes were to use applesauce instead of butter and I added cinnamon like other people.  I also used one egg and two egg whites.  I mixed the yolk in with the liquid ingredients and folded the egg whites at the very end.

This recipe is just fine without the sugar.  I've substituted the eggs for mashed bananas when I don't have eggs on hand and they're just as good.  My son loves plain waffles so we often have left over batter in the fridge that keeps for a day or so.  
We tried these in our Belgian waffle maker and it didn't work very well but this recipe is perfect for the thin, crispy waffles.  
This is our favorite waffle recipe - you won't be disappointed!

Very nice.  And easy.  My family is visiting and my sister in law mentioned she likes waffles, so I thought I'd make her some this morning.  I didn't try any but everyone who did said they were very good.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've been making waffles for many years now and this is a really good basic waffle recipe. I got thumbs up from my three boys and wife! I did however switch the vanilla extract with maple extract and added some cinnamon. They came out great with a dusting of powdered sugar! :)

Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Cut the recipe in half for my husband and me, and it made exactly four waffles with our Belgian-style waffle iron.

I was beginning to think my waffle iron was to cheap to make good waffles. Just learnt that it was the recipe,  not the iron. This recipe is perfect. I made it exactly as directed. Loved them.

Great recipe! Very easy to make, and the kids loved it, and wanted it again for lunch. Why spend more money when most homes have all the ingredients to make it from scratch already. Minus the crazy things packaged food has hidden in their waffles. I did add cinnamon per request of the kiddies and it only made it better. I also added more sugar and it wasn't sweet at all but pleasant.

I found this recipe made a thicker batter than I like.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of milk so the batter would flow better in my waffle maker.

The perfect, basic, waffle recipe that I was looking for this morning!  My son really wanted waffles this morning; I didn't have any boxed mix and didn't have the time to make Belgian waffles. This recipe came to the rescue. I will be making these again for sure.  They were every easy and cooked perfectly in my Cuisinart waffle maker. The recipe is so simple, that it will be easy to alter to make either sweeter or more savory recipes in the future.

This recipe worked out great for simples waffles. It made about 5 giant waffles. I used wax paper to freeze two of them in the freezer and they reheated great in the toaster oven. I reccomend this recipe to anyone who just got a new waffle iron.

My 3 boys love waffles but I wanted to start making them from scratch versus buying them. This was my first experience ever making a waffle and they were amazing! I made them exactly as the recipe states and they were delicious but I will tweet them a bit as I go to make them a bit healthier like others have suggested....subbing applesauce for butter, adding more cinnamon etc.  great basic recipe!

Perfect, buttery waffles. These are wonderful as is, and also lovely with a margarine instead of a butter. I mixed this using my blender, which made it a lot easier to pour into the waffle iron.

I'm not sure where the bland and/or salty reviews are coming from. The only thing I can see is that several people mention baking SODA when this recipe calls for baking POWDER. Baking soda is 3 or 4 times saltier than baking powder, and has a pretty foul taste when heated - it needs some kind of acid to neutralize it. Baking Powder does not need an additional acid in it, because it already has an acid built in. Regardless, make sure you use a baking POWDER and not a soda, or your waffles will taste pretty terrible.

Love! The texture and the ease of this recipe is great- and it was very receptive to my fancying-up: we have been on a bit of a coconut kick lately, so I used coconut milk (the Silk kind, not the canned kind) instead of regular, used coconut extract instead of vanilla and tossed in about 1/2 cup shredded sweetened coconut (I also wasn't feeling all that butter so I substitited plain Greek yogurt for about half the quantity). Resulted in a surprisingly subtle but very delicious level of coconuttiness. It's a winner, either way!

I usually make these for myself in the morning. It makes more than I can eat by myself so I just freeze the extras and use them for breakfast the next morning. I also would recommend setting them on a paper towel so as to duck the sogginess. Great, easy recipe.

I have used this recipe for over 5 years nothing ever went bad but the last time i made these the turned out perfect i think it was because i did what one of the reviews said and separated the eggs and folded the beaten whites as the last step and added 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon.I started making this recipe when i was ten so i dont know what these other people are doing wrong.

I used a blender to mix the wet ingredients. I then mixed the powdered ingredients separately in a bowl then poured on the blender with the wet ingredients. This waffle recipe is perfect! I've left a lot of ready mixed batter at the refrigerator for the next day :)

This recipe was recommended in reply to my request for a waffle recipe.  My family loved it and my husband said not to look for another recipe because this one is perfect.  :)

I thought this recipe was good, but nothing to write home about. I added some cinnamon to the batter when I made them. My boyfriend thought they were very dense and heavy, with a lack-luster flavor. It is a waffle recipe that I might try to alter more extensively to try again for myself, but he wants nothing to do with it.

This is an awesome recipe.  I substituted Splenda brand sweetener for the sugar.  It was great. I also added some chocolate chips just after pouring the batter on the waffle iron. WOW Chocolate chip waffles!  

This batter also makes great pancakes.  I made one while waiting on the waffle iron to give it a try, outstanding!

I halved the recipe and made them into pancakes instead (I still have to buy a waffle-maker). I must say! They are sooooo GOOD! I added 1/4 tsp (1/2 tsp for the original recipe) of cinnamon then cut the salt to half. Not too sweet; the maple syrup made it just right. My very-picky nephew-in-law even loved it! Will make them again! Half the recipe made 4 pancakes (1/3 cup batter).

LOVED these! Original recipe made 12 waffles (we made 1.5X for our family of 6, made 18). I added a little less baking powder (4 tsp for 1.5X), doubled the sugar (6 tbsp for 1.5X), didn't warm the milk (forgot) and beat the egg whites separately and folded them in at the end. Yum!!

This is a great recipe - no tweaking required!  I make a double batch, place slightly undercooked, cooled waffles on a cookie sheet, flash freeze, then place in ziplock freezer bags. School days - kids pop one in the toaster - voila - homemade goodness without the chemicals of store bought. Plus making a large batch once every two or three weeks is very easy to achieve.

My family and I are big fans of pancakes & waffles so I've tried my fair share of recipes.  Can't believe how simple this recipes is both in ingredients & in prep but it delivers fantastic results!  I made exactly as written.  I think next I will add more vanilla but other than that they were fabulous.  I know some reviewers have suggested separating the eggs & whipping the whites...I wonder if they tried the recipe without doing that because I don't find that to be necessary with this recipe.  Just don't over mix - any recipes for pancakes or waffles will be tough if you over mix.  There SHOULD be some lumps.  Mix just enough to incorporate.  Enjoy your breakfast!

I decided to make waffles for dinner (again) and tried out this recipe this time.  It's a perfect fit for us and our waffle maker.   It made 9 waffles in our waffle maker, which is a classic round.  I use 1/2 cup batter and this batter is thick enough that I didn't have a single spill-over, which I usually have with thinner batters.   The only change I made was to add cinnamon because I was serving these with toasted pecans, sliced banana, and maple syrup.  I just realized that I forgot to add the salt.  The recipe doesn't really need it and I use unsalted butter.

I have made these waffles time and time again. These are a big hit in my house! Never fail recipe, made exactly as-is!

However, over the times, I have come to add other things to the batter depending on what I feel like (e.g. mashed bananas, cinnamon, punpkin spice, blueberries, etc.).

Good basic recipe. You're only going to be able to make 10-12 waffles if they are each the size of a quarter though... it's more like 3.

This has a very good taste, light and fluffy.  Not to mention that this doesn't stick in my waffle maker like some others do. I make this ahead of time and put the batter in the refrigerator and used the next couple of days and still come out like I just made the batter.  My son just loves this not to mention it is easy for him to help me make it.

So good!I did cut it in half as there are only three of us. Then I added a 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and a Tbs of brown sugar and increased the sugar a little. We like our waffles to be a bit sweet in the batter. Served with real butter, real maple syrup some berries and a sprinkle of powdered sugar. They were awesome!

I followed the recipe exactly and they came out awesome! The batter was the perfect consistency, not too watery and not too thick. I had waffles with maple syrup for breakfast and later I tried throwing some chocolate chips in for dessert. The chocolate chip waffle would go great with some sliced banana on top. I'm thinking of keeping a batch of dry ingredients pre-mixed in a mason jar so that I can quickly throw it all together in the mornings.

I've tried many waffle recipes off this site, this one is as described, a good CLASSIC waffle.  I actually saved it because it makes a crunchy waffle with soft center which is exactly how I like them.  I actually used 1/2 whole wheat flour and they were still delicious.  Thanks for sharing!

I thought these were delicious.  Lighter and less eggy tasting than some recipes I've tried. I doubled the recipe, with one major change.  I did not double the baking powder.  8 teaspoons seemed instinctively wrong.  So I went with 4 for the double batch. They turned out beautifully. This will be my go to recipe.

Followed ingredients and steps perfectly. The texture was perfect waffle texture...crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. But it really lacked any flavor.

This is a great waffle! It has a light, fluffy texture and  tastes wonderful with some syrup, fruit or powdered sugar on top. The cooking time depends on your waffle iron, but mine cooked the waffles in about 2 1/2 minutes. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made these as the recipe stated but used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.  They were good but a little bland (probably because of the whole wheat).  So the next batch I made I doubled the vanilla and sugar and they were very good.

These are great.  They turn out exactly as you would hope and expect them to.  Definitely serve immediately as they become soggy quickly.

Delicious! Crisp on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. Just enough sweetness to make it nom-nom without having to pour a ton of syrup on it. Also I love having the butter in the batter. No need to add extra. Definitely my go to waffle recipe from here on out.

I've tried many waffle recipes and this is my favorite with the best results... even compared to using bisquik which produces a "too heavy" belgian waffle with package directions. 

This tastes every bit like a "diner" style belgian waffle. has simple, inexpensive, common ingredients and is easy to prepare for kitchen newbies, and trouble free enough for an experienced cook to whip up quickly. 
5/5

Wonderful! Added a smidge more sugar to the batter (1 extra Tablespoon) and they turned out perfect, no need for syrup! I halved the recipe and that was the perfect amount for my two small kiddos and myself.

These have a great texture but they were way too salty! I like a sweet waffle. Next time I will reduce the salt and add more sugar.

I've tried a lot of waffle recipes. I make Belgium waffles and these are by far the best I've made. Perfectly crisp on the outside and perfect texture inside. Wouldn't change a thing about them. Great recipe! (I've never reviewed any of the recipes I've tried but had to review this one.)

First time trying to make waffles on my new maker! I added a little to much salt.  I was only making 1/2 the recipe at a time. But these were still great & super easy! My daughter loved them w/ just syrup! I used the blender to mix.

These were great, very easy to make. My husband & I were pleased. I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of cinnamon to the dry mix and you could taste the flavor. I have a new Belgian Waffle Iron (4 waffles) & this recipe only made 2.5 batches for me. The last batch wasnt enough to fill the iron so I'd add a little extra next time to even things out. Great recipe!

These tasted great, very buttery and they are light as can be!  My only complaint was that they were a little salty.  Next time I'll scale back the salt a little bit.

I have made many waffle recipes from this site, but this recipe just came out much too salty. I believe that by reducing the  amount of baking powder, you can avoid the intense salt flavor in this recipe. I also had to add about 1/4 cup extra milk since the batter came out a little thick.

I added a tablespoon of cinnamon to the recipe. It gave an already great tasting waffle a wonderful additional flavor!

Waffles were great.  Followed others advice added aditional sugar, vanilla, cinnamon and 1 1/2 tspn almond.  It tasted great. The outside was a little crispy, but the inside was soft.

For how fast and easy these were, I have to give them five stars.  I must say that I was a little scared because of how simple the recipe looked but they came out great.  Not the best ever.  But the best in a short amount of time.

This is a good recipe to start with.  The only changes I made were to separate the egg whites from the yolks and beat them til they formed soft peaks.  After combining the flour, salt, baking powder, and sugar I added in the 2 egg yolks whisked with milk, butter and vanilla.  I mixed this well and then folded in the egg whites.  I also like to add frozen or fresh fruit such as blueberries and raspberries.  With the amount of butter in the recipe I find it is not necessary to spread butter over the waffles and instead just use warmed maple syrup.  Very good!

I think this recipe is overall very good and works well. Having read the reviews, the only reason they would be bland is if you left out the sugar or vanilla extract because I find them to be very flavorful each time.  However, having made them multiple times, I have found that there is not enough liquid in the batter, which causes the density that some people have complained about.  I up the amount of milk to just under 2 cups, which may seem to make the batter runny but creates an amazingly fluffy and crisp waffle.

I made these one Saturday morning and they were delicious! They go great with a nice, warm cup of coffee! The picture of the waffles shows them with strawberries, but they taste great with blueberries! Oh and, sprinkling powdered sugar on top makes them extra sweet!

"Adding 2 tablespoons of cornflour results in a crispier waffle."
I agree. I always add some cornflour to my waffle recipe, as it results in a much crispier producty.

I make these at least 3 times a month and they always come out great. So crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. My son's friend loves to sleep over because of these waffles and my mother in law loves them too.

I liked this recipe.  I took another's advice and made them in my blender - easy. I used white whole wheat flour - good.  I used 1/2 butter.  I added a little extra milk for ease of blending - it made them a little too thin - and they stuck to the waffle iron - i used Pam for each waffle.

These waffles are a big family favorite! I make them very often and to add flavor to the batter, I put in an  additional quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract and once the batter is all mixed, I put in a few shakes of ground cinnamon.

I tried to make the recipe that came with my waffle maker and it was ridiculously long and complicated.
Final step was to wait one hour before using the batter.  In the mean time, found this recipe and it was perfect - fast and yummy!

We love this receipe!  Occassionally we add fresh fruit (blue/strawberries) into each waffle after we pour the batter.  Also great base for banana waffles!

This is a great and simple recipe. We make it every Saturday morning. I tried beating the egg whites separately (to make it fluffier) but it doesn't make much of a difference and it's much faster to do it all at once. This is good in the fridge for a few days and tastes better if the batter is made the night before. I usually add a little bit of cinnamon and something else like blueberries or chocolate chips. I tried making it with whole wheat flour and a bit more milk for a healthy version but the original is better!

I love these but my family didn't like them as much as I do.  I've been making these for myself and freezing them and yeast waffles for my family.  

I agree with the other reviewers, they taste more like pancakes than waffles but I think they are really yummy.

I used whole wheat flour just because I prefer it and try to make my food as healthy as possible, and they still turned out golden and delicious! Great recipe!

Good, but not our favorite. I felt it needed more sugar and vanilla. I also tried this recipe in the blender. It worked well, but we thought it was a little dense. I'll probably try adding the egg whites seperately after whipping them to lighten them up next time.

Great waffle recipe.
I used more sugar (we have a sweet tooth, and I suspected the original 2 tablespoons wouldn't be enough, based on the other reviews :-)
Used whole wheat pastry flour.
They were nice and fluffy and very yummy. Next time, I'll try separating the eggs, to see whether that really makes a difference in the taste :-)

Very nice waffle recipe... I made these over other high rated ones on this website because they called for butter instead of oil... I followed other reviewers advice and beat the egg whites separate.... over all very good waffle

This is a lovely crisp waffle as stated.  I did add a touch more sugar and butter, but YUM!  They held up great to syrup and butter. I have been trying mixes for a while and never found what I was looking for. This fills the bill. This is just as easy as opening up a box. I always have the ingredients on hand too. Very easy to whip up. 5+ stars!

Although they did turn out nice and fluffy, with a beautiful golden color, we really weren't impressed by the taste.  It had kind of a baking soda aftertaste that made me not want another.  We threw away the leftover batter.  Sigh.

These were great waffles.  I followed the advice of one poster and added more sugar (4T) and 1/2 c of melted butter and it worked out wonderfully! I might try to beat the egg whites separately next time to make them a little fluffier.

This morning I put my NEW waffle maker to good use with this recipe. I was having a chocolate attack so I added some dark chocolate chips. I think in the future I may add a bit more salt and even a tad more sugar because it still tasted a bit bland to me. I found this recipe super simple to make and I will be using it in the future. :)

This is a very good yet simple recipe. We made them Christmas day for brunch, everyone loved them.  I did increase the sugar to 5 tablespoons for those in the family with a sweet tooth.

Just okay. Lacked flavor. I'd suggest adding more sugar and vanilla. I like a light fluffy waffle. These were heavy.

Exactly what a waffle should be.  I would also like to thank the reviewer that mentioned keeping the waffles on paper towels to keep them crisp.  I didn't know that trick, but it worked really well while making these for my kids for breakfast.  Any topping goes great on these.

Perfect!  Quick to make. Crunchy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.  I look forward to making a batch to freeze for the week.

I love this recipe! I make them ahead of time to freeze for easy breakfasts during the week. I make mine lactose free with soy milk which makes the texture a bit less fluffy but still delicious. I also mash up 2 very ripe bananas with my hands to add. So yummy! Thanks for sharing.

I used this recipe as a base for a gluten free waffle. I used my own Gluten free flour blend. I used only a 1/2 tsp salt, and an extra tsp of baking powder and  a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. I also separated the eggs and beat the whites until stiff but not dry and then folded them in to the rest of the batter. My waffles came out fluffy and crisp. which is hard to get with GF. I only gave it 4 stars since I change the recipe and have no idea what it would taste like made with normal wheat flour.

These were SO DELICIOUS! I added a little extra sugar for more flavor, but other than that I followed the recipes. They were light, very fluffy, and didn't sit heavily like store-bought mixes do. I made it in my blender (as per a suggestion in a rating), and that made them so quick. You could easily alter this recipe to make wheat, fruit, or chocolate chip waffles. I highly recommend this for its simplicity and deliciousness!

Crispy and light!!! I have tried many of the recipes on this site and we love this one the most so far(as of august 2010). I accidentally added another cup of milk and substituted olive oil for the butter and maple syrup for the sugar and I separated the whites of the eggs and whipped them and added them last, so I do not know if that is why we loved it, but we have been trying many recipes and this is the one my kids FINALLY said I should keep!!  Yay!! We eat ours with smoothies instead of syrup.  Waaaay more appetizing!  No ice in the smoothie- just yogurt, frozen fruit, 3-6-9 oils, juice if needed and sugar or maple syrup to sweeten if needed.  Then it is really thick and you can dip the waffle in the smoothie.

Very good and easy to make.  They maintain their crispness which I've had as a problem in the past with other recipes/baking mixes.  Definitely going in the keep pile.

Awesome! I wanted somewhat sweet waffles so I did as reviewer "Stephanie " suggested and added the extra sugar, vanilla and butter. Omg delicious!!! My 4 yr old helped me and she was thrilled to gobble them up.

Very good recipe! I added another tsp of vanilla and some more sugar but that's just my preference.   For anyone who would like to know: this recipe made two perfect waffles (4 squares each) in my Krups Belgian waffle maker with about 1/3 cup in each square.

I tried this for the first time today and loved them. I did add an extra tbsp of sugar, some extra butter and another 1/2 tsp of vanilla.  The family raved about them. In fact, they were all gone. Next time I'll have to make a double batch. :)

I thought these were good - alittle bland but the first try is always the basic recipe. An issue I had tho was (and I'm not sure this is a bad thing) the amount of steam/moisture that came from the batter when it was cooking. It made for a yummy crispy waffle but when I was cleaning the waffle pan water literally poured out from it. Maybe about 1/4 cup. I may have used skim milk I'm not completely sure if I did...Remade 6/5/12 - Have a new puppy :) Son helped me watch her when I put the batter together. Since I was in a bit of a time squeeze I didn't heat the milk and it sat in the fridge for a few hours before I actually made the waffles. Like this method much better. Still came out somewhat crispy (I probably could have let them cook longer) and fit into the little bits of time intervals that I had. Used whole milk this time around :)

These waffles are just ok.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and I thought they were bland.  I made it a second time and doubled the sugar and vanilla, but its still a little bland to me.  Will look for another waffle recipe.

I was pretty disappointed.  Mine didn't turn out crispy at all, but it was my first try with a waffle iron - maybe my fault.  I also don't understand the 4 tsp. of baking powder in this.  I though they were pretty bland, too.  Surprising, because the batter smelled wonderful.  Sorry!

Really great recipe.  I added a bit of club soda to thin it out a bit and it was delicous.  Will make again

These turned out very tough.  I even made sure not to over beat the mixture and I separated the eggs and folded in the whipped egg whites.  The powers of gluten still prevailed and made for a very dense, very tough waffle.

This recipe is good, straight forward, accurate and easy to follow. They have nice color, and are light and crisp.  Plus they soak up syrup without getting to soft.  It seems to me like they make perfect waffles.   A good luck tip, add 4 light shakes of nutmeg & cinnamon.

Made these for the family and will keep the recipe.  I did whip the egg white up separately and also added some maple extract to the batter.

These were good basic waffles. I used my stand mixer to beat the eggs then add the milk, butter, vanilla and sugar. I then added the mixed dried ingredients. I made extra batter to make and freeze for breakfast for the month. There won't be a waffle shortage at my house!

I made this today and they were wonderful, light and tasty.  I only used 1/2t of salt and sifted the dry ingredients.  They were great!  A good tip (can't remember where I read it?) put a paper towel on the plate you are putting the waffles on to prevent them from getting soggy.

These were ok but nothing special.  They never really got crispy for us...they stayed pretty soggy. The flavor was decent but I won't be making them again.

Delicious!! I followed the recipe but added 1 tsp of baking soda and I separated the eggs, whipped the whites then folded the mixture into the whipped egg whites. They came out BEAUTIFULLY!! Crispy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Wonderful!  Just got a new Belgian Waffle Maker and didn't have any waffle mix in the pantry.  I made this recipe exactly as written and it was perfect.  The whole family loved it.  I don't even know if I'll buy the box stuff again.  I will probably just keep making these!

Excellent waffles!  I followed the recipe exactly and was very happy with the results.  They are thick with a slightly chewy inside, just like we like them.  The dough was very thick when I mixed it, which concerned me, but they came out just fine.  They smell like Belgian waffles (almost cake-like) while cooking, but they aren't too sweet.  This is now my go-to recipe.

Delicious, basic recipe that can be your base to develop unique flavor addtions! I followed exact recipe and since i'm not a fan of maple syrup, I reduced strawberries in water and white sugar for a delcious topping! Please make these!

These waffles were tasty.  I did add about 3/4 teaspoon of cinnamon and swapped out half the butter for applesauce.  Nice texture with a hint of cinnamon and apples. Topped with warmed bananas and maple syrup. Delish.

I like these waffles, but I found them a bit bland and dense. So, I added 3 tsp of vanilla extract, and 3 to 4 Tbs of white sugar, and 2 cups of milk . The extra milk made the waffles less dense and lighter, and increased the number of waffles from 5 to 8, perfect for a family of 4 (2 waffles each). You can also make them ahead and freeze them so you can eat them whenever you want by reheating in the toaster. They're really good for a quick breakfast when you're in a hurry. Just toast, and take it with you because it's already sweet!! I also found that by adding extra sugar, they're sweet enough that you don't need as much syrup or you can eat them as is!!

Taste as is was bland, honestly had 0 flavor.  I also had real troubles getting them to cook crisply on the outsides without burning them.  I altered the recipe a few times along the way to try and fix the issues but had no good results.  Am now looking for a recipe that works - as is.

My husband is a BIG breakfast guy and I wanted to treat him to homemade waffles instead of box mix.  He was loved these so much I was tickled.  I mixed up a container of the dry goods so they are ready to go, no more box mixes here!  Thanks

These were a wonderful 1st attempt for me making waffles in my new waffle maker. The batter was a bit thick(will add a little bit more milk next time) They were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle. Family love them. May possibly add fruit and cinnamon next time. Thanks for the great recipe!

I have been looking for a grat waffle recipe for some time. I own the Kitchenaid proline waffle iron and many of them either turn out too thin and crispy or too soft.  These came out just right.  Crunchy exterior with a soft middle.    Tip: Be sure to use a cooling rack or the waffle will get soggy underneath.   Another tip: an easy way to reheat a waffle is just to use the waffle iron again for about 15 seconds. It reheats great if you are making for a large group and need to make ahead.  Better than using the oven which will dry them out.  Great stuff!

After making these waffles for breakfast today, I will NEVER again buy waffle mix.  This recipe was very simple and just about as easy as using a mix.  I followed the recipe exactly, then tasted the batter.  As several others mentioned, it did not seem sweet enough to me, so I added a bit more sugar and the result was awesome waffles that were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  Thanks for sharing this recipe with us - it is a keeper!

These waffles are delicious.  I had been using a popular store bought mix but was out one day when I wanted to make waffles.  Used this instead and have been using ever since.  I keep the dry ingredients mixed so when I decide to make them one morning all I have to do is add the wet ingredients.  Taste great heated up later in the day with ice cream also

This recipe was very heavy. I did not care for this one. I like a lighter fluffier waffle.

These waffles are great. Don't forget to heat the milk and butter or they don't come out a good. I also sometimes add a little cinnamon.

The waffles came out great! I like the texture... I used a hand mixer to get rid of flour chunks. Next time will half the salt. Froze leftovers and toast them when needed. This recipe became my most used one. Thank you!

I used wheat flour instead of the white, and 1/2 cup buttermilk added to 1 cup skim, and added 1 more scoop of sugar.  Yum Yum.  They were very "wheaty" though, so next time I won't use all wheat flour.

I used twice as much sugar, but could have used 3x as much. I froze these and reheated them, and got a crispy waffle! Theyre a little dry though, so maybe a little more oil will fix that?

This recipe was great. I made it at a friend's house, so I ended up using margarine instead of butter and imitation vanilla instead of regular. The waffles were still great. I scaled the recipe to 3 servings and it kind of made the quantities weird - like 1 1/4 eggs (?) so I used one whole egg and most of an egg white. I would definitely make these again. I froze the leftovers and they reaheated well in the toaster. Good job!

I'm going to give this a 5 anyways since I subbed a bunch of things. I used margerine instead of butter, and whole wheat allpurpouse instead of white flour, and I don't have any vanilla so I used lemon juice. They were good but not excellent, as I'm sure they would be if I didn't mess with things. However, I did enjoy them more after adding some chocolate chips to the batter after I had cooked half of them. I also tried coconut but I couldn't taste it, so I won't bother with that again.

Fabulous waffles and a great base recipe. It's easy to adapt to your needs. This is the second time we've made them, and I was thrilled to see they worked just as well with whole wheat pastry flour as they had with all purpose. I also through frozen blueberries into the last few waffles and they were a great addition.

These are basic, simple waffles that come out crispy and light. They're even good toasted the next day. We used berries and whipped cream for toppings the first time we tried them. The next time we went with real maple syrup. Delicious!

This recipe is excellent. I used half whole wheat flour (1 cup white and 1 cup whole wheat) to make them a bit healthier, and I also added 1 tsp of cinnamon for some extra flavour. They turned out just right! When they were ready, I ate them with Nutella and sliced bananas...yummm!

I doubled the sugar and the vanilla, and added a dash of cinnamon which I probably should have left out. Still these had a fabulous taste and texture and were great topped with chopped pecans and real maple syrup. Will make again.

Great basic recipe.  I increased the sugar and vanilla, as recommended by others, and used 1/2 wheat flour.  Turned out fantastic!

I didn't bother separating the eggs, but will try that next time.  Don't know how the waffles could be fluffier, though!

These were very good. My daughters first comment was that they didn't look as fluffy as normal, but she loved them once she tried them. I substituted a little amaretto creamer for the milk and it added a nice flavor.

My 11 yo son wants to learn how to cook and we made these waffles together. He love them! They are very good and are great to store in the fridge to toast for a quick breakfast! The only change I made was to beat the egg whites until soft peaks and add a touch bit more of sugar. He wanted pecan waffles so we chopped the nuts and added them into the batter also. I have a belgium waffle maker and it was perfect! I wanted to make several batches to freeze, but we ran out of eggs so it will have to wait for next weekend! Much better than store bought mixes! Thanks for sharing!

I did not make any modifications and this recipe was just great. Next time, I may experiment by adding a little more sugar and vanilla. I had some sausage links and OJ for an awesome weekend breakfast.

Just like my dad used to make.  Per reviews, I added an extra tablespoon of sugar, and I also whipped the egg whites separately and folded them in.  What a lovely little trick I never knew about before!  These aren't fancy, but then they wouldn't be called "classic", would they? ;)  Simple, and just right.

This recipe is wonderful.  My children and my husband thought the waffles were delish and very light and fluffy.  We had none left over.  I will use this over and over again.

I loved the idead of using the blender.  Worked great and easy to pour out of.  With adding more vanilla and sugar, the waffles were really good, but still not a 5 star for me.

This is a great recipe.  I use it at least once a week.  I can make a big batch and then stick them in the freezer.  Our 7 year old loves to stick one in the toaster every morning for breakfast before school.  Usually then he smothers some cinnamon/sugar butter on top and eats it on his way to the bus stop.  It definitely beats out pop tarts and commercial frozen waffles.

Delicious! I added a bit more sugar, a splash more of vanilla (my husband likes sweet waffles), and a few shakes of cinnamon. Turned out tasting SO yummy.

Classic is a good word for these. They are not fancy or elaborate, just plain old good waffles. I made a double batch and froze most of them so I can have waffles whenever I want.

I am wondering if I should have beat the eggs longer, but I didn't like these much at all. I know it wasn't my baking powder either. They turned out a little chewy and flat. Sorry this just wasn't for my family.

Nice recipe, I served it topped with freshly picked raspberries and blackberries, and it was delicious.  I also separated the eggs and folded in the whipped egg whites last, since I have always done that in my waffle recipes.

My 3 year old daugher and I made these waffles this morning when we realized we didn't have any pre-made mix. Boy, was I glad we didn't. These waffles were easy and the best I've made at home. No more mix for me and I always have these ingredients at home. I loved that I could make them crispy - boxed mixes don't seem to get crispy the way I like them. I followed the recipe as is and loved it. Thanks for wonderful recipe.

I cut the salt in half like one reviewer suggested and used vanilla flavoring instead of extract and they cam out delish! I used a belgium waffle maker because I don't have a regular waffle maker and they came out awesome!  I used about 2/3c for the beglium waffles.

It was the first time I made waffles and believe it or not...it was just perfect. 

I wanted a recipe for basic waffles without any other additions and this recipe just gave me that. The second time I made waffles, I used whole wheat flour and it was still good. I recommend this recipe to all waffles lovers who want just the right proportion of sweetness and butter.

Thanks for posting this recipe. :)

Great recipe - gives the illusion of yeast added. For those that got too dense of waffles - you probably overmixed. This batter should be mixed only to the point of slightly lumpy.

Just tried this recipe for Easter Brunch and it turned just as I had hoped. It is a good basic waffle mix. The waffles had a nice flavor,the consistancy was great and the recipe an easy one to put together. I will definately save this one to my recipe box and use it over and over again. Thanks!

This waffle recipe was yummo!  I am vegan, so I just changed the milk to soy milk, butter to vegan butter, and eggs to my egg replacer, and it was way better than any vegan recipe I found.  My children loved it, and so did I!

Okay, even though I completely butchered this recipe it surprisingly came out good!  I wasn't so sure about the amount of baking soda so I only put in 1 tsp. and that seemed to work just fine.  I already added the salt to the dry mix, and then I accidentally melted salted butter instead of unsalted, so instead of wasting the salted, I mixed in half of the salted with some unsalted.  If that wasn't bad enough, I realized I didn't have enough milk, so I ended up only putting in about 1 cup....and I forgot to warm it up!  So when I added the cold milk to the butter mixture...sure enough the butter turned back to halfway solid!!  So, I had chunks of butter all throughout this wet mixture.  I added it anyway to the dry ingredients and although it looked jacked up and was a very thick batter, I decided to put it in the waffle iron anyway.  I thought this would be terrible for sure, but I am pleased to say they still turned out!  They're especially good with syrup, strawberries and whip cream!

Very good.  I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites and sugar separate, then folded into the batter to give them more fluff.  Otherwise I followed the recipe and they turned out great!

finally a waffel recipe that is exactly what I am looking for....crisp yet soft. I too sifted the dry ingredients. It helped a ton to put the waffles on a paper towel, they stayed crisp like waffels should be! Thanks everyone for all the helpful hints!

These waffles came out perfect texture-wise.  I admit I made some additions...cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice, and I replaced the butter with pumpkin puree, and they were awesome!  They really don't need the butter!

I use this recipe often.  Very easy and makes nice waffles.  I usually double the recipe and use 3 cups whole wheat flour and only 1 cup white.  Also usually add a bit of  cinnamon and nutmeg.  They freeze nicely.

This was my first time making waffles from scratch; and they turned out ok, but as some of the other reviews mentioned, they were a little bland and not very crispy. I made a second one and turned the heat up higher which helped a little, but it still wasn't very crispy. Over all they were pretty good, but next time I might try adding a little more vanilla.

These were very good waffles.  Not quite as crispy on the outside as I'd like but maybe my waffle iron wasn't hot enough.  Will certainly try the recipe again with iron hotter.  Update:  These are wonderful if you make sure you iron is hot enough.  I've never had better!

Wonderful!  I thought so much baking powder would ruin these waffles, but because the batter is so light it really helps them to puff.  They are as light and crispy as if you had separated your eggs, whipped the whites, and added them later.  I've done that and they aren't as good as these waffles.  A wonderful, sweet flavor with the great scent of vanilla.  I love this recipe!

Good waffles, but a little dense for my taste. I added another tsp of vanilla, 1/2 tbls of sugar, and unmeasured amount of cinnamon and nutmeg.  Overall, a good flavor, and they came out cripy.

Ok, this recipe gets 5 stars because I royally screwed it up the first time and they still turned out great.  The first time I made them I only added 1/2 cup of milk.  Whoops.  They were just very thick.  I actually make them the right way today and they were fantastic.  The only things I changed were adding more vanilla and throwing in some cinnamon.  Yum.  And even better, they reheat well in the toaster for a quick breakfast.  My first and last waffle recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe was fine as written, but I detest tasting leavening.  The texture is fairly dense.  It's a mediocre waffle.  The Light,crispy recipe was much more to my tastes.

I would have given this 5 stars, but I altered the recipe slightly, yielding a wonderful waffle.  I made 1 & 1/2 the recipe used 2 c. all purpose flour & 1 c. whole wheat flour, used 5 total tsp. baking powder & 1/2 tsp. salt total.  I found it interesting that the recipe called for vanilla extract, but I enjoyed the results.  I got many compliments from my company. Thanks for the post!

A bit too eggy tasting for my liking. And I felt like I had eaten boulders afterwards. But that may not have to do with the recipe exactly ? I'm not sure ! Other than that and the eggy taste, it's a pretty decent recipe. :)

These waffles were surprisingly good.  Despite the 4.5 star rating they enjoy, we didn't expect too much when looking at the picture of brown waffles.  But seriously, these have good flavor and were a hit all around.  I mean they're waffles... worst case, throw the bisquick recipe together if these don't pan out... but they did.  We wanted a breakfast project, and these were it.  We didn't warm the milk (so the butter hardened up in the egg/milk mixture... no problem... and we sifted the flour mixture together.  All in all, a great looking/tasting waffle product.  We'll make these again if we get a hankering for non-Bisquick waffles again.

I omitted the vanilla and used this recipe as a base for chicken and waffles. They did the trick. They were tasty but not eggy and easy to cut without being mushy! Another keeper!

I have found this recipie to be easy and versatile.  It works well with egg substitute.  I have also mix some oj into the batter to give a citrus flavor.

Very good. Be sure and beat the eggs for a good minute or two until they are FLUFFY before adding the milk and butter.  I made the recipe exactly how it is written and it turned out wonderful.

Oh no we ran out of waffle mix! you will never hear those words again. This is the easiest and best homemade waffles ever. We ate them all! I did add whole wheat flour 1/2 cup and 1 1/2 cup white.  gotta get little bit of fiber in there somewhere.

The batter seemed a little thin so I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour.  These waffles turned out perfect!!  Moist in the center and crisp on the outside.  I froze the leftover waffles and they warm up perfectly in the toaster for a quick breakfast.

Yum!  I doubled the sugar and added about a teaspoon of cinnamon.  You couldn't taste the cinnamon a whole lot, but it added a little something special.  I made Waffles I last time and I like this recipe better.

My husband loves crisp waffles this was the perfect balance between crisp and overcooked as it was so soft on the inside.  Great recipe for such a short prep time.  I agree it did lack a little flavor.  Maybe I will try more vanilla next time.

These waffles came out with the perfect texture. Crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The kids found them a little hard to cut through but it wasn't a big deal. Apparently it was fine because they inhaled 11 of them in about 10 minutes ( my 2 girls and 2 neices). They were a little lacking in flavor so I will try a little extra vanilla and sugar next time or maybe some maple flavor. Thanks for this recipe.

I used a little less salt and real vanilla extract. I thought these were great, light on the inside and crispy on the outside. We got less waffles than indicated but we may have a larger waffle maker. We will make these again.

Absolutely fantastic and easy to make!  I omitted the salt because of prior reviews.  I made this recipe for my children and one of their friends and they devoured them!!  Even without the usual cinnamon I add to my waffle batter, this was the best recipe I've tried and will use this one from now on!!

These were good, very simple.  They were a bit salty though, so next time I will cut the salt in half.  If you're looking for a basic recipe this is it.

This has become our standard.  Not too sweet; just crispy enough.  We've added chocolate chunks as a treat with good results.

Wow, these are good waffles. I sifted the dry ingredients and beat the 
egg whites separately to make the waffles more fluffy.
Real Mexican vanilla adds more flavour (to this recipe or any other)

Waffle fell apart in iron and would have been too salty anyway. I think there's probably way too much baking powder called for.

Excellent recipe. Fluffy, a slightly crisp outside, and the vanilla makes the waffles taste like the ones my grandmother made me for breakfast. My family loved them so much we had them the next day for dinner.

I added a stick of butter, and I whipped the egg whites and folded them in.  Perfect waffles. I chose this recipe because it had butter in it instead of oil.

I have five boys, so I doubled the recipe. It was way too much.  Everyone loved it including my wife. And I have six waffles left over.

I make these fairly often and freeze the extra for a quick breakfast in the mornings for my kids. They always turn out well and keep well. You could also make ahead for a waffle bar for an easy brunch!

The recipe was easy to follow. I didn’t change any of the ingredients. I did add hot maple syrup and Cool Whip to top it off.

Great waffles! I used the amount of baking powder in the recipe and increased the amount of sugar to 5 TBSP, a stick of butter, and doubled the vanilla. Make sure to cook the waffles throughly and let stand on a cooling rack for a minute or two...this will help them crisp up. Generally when I make pancakes or waffles the first one comes out wonky-- not with this recipe! Every waffle turned out fantastic!

Love this recipe! My kids and I made these today, and we realized we had to try a couple times to get it right. We were using a gravy ladle, so after a couple of overflowing attempts, we found the right amount to pour in and successfully made some pretty delicious red waffles with our spiderman waffle maker.

The waffle mixture was very fluffy but thin, I think it requires more flour to thicken it up. I definetly won't be using this recipe again.

This was a great basic recipe! Getting a new waffle maker for Christmas, we were excited to try it out. I’ll likely make some modifications for our taste with the next batch- but this was delicious just as is!!

I’ve made waffles many times but this was the first time making this recipe. 
They were light, fluffy, and delicious.  My husband loved them!

I am critical of food that I make and have to say they were fantastic!
This is a keeper recipe for me.

I’ve been relying on this recipe for years. It’s a family favorite. It is great just how it is, and also lends itself well to different flavors. We like a little nutmeg if the waffles are to be topped with maple syrup, and a little cardamom and lemon or orange zest if they are to be topped with whipped cream and fruit.

Thank U for sharing your recipe! 
My daughter & I made it again today..
We personalize it ... We omitted salt, used unsalted butter, 1 1/2 tsp vanilla essence and 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, and 1 tsp tangerine zest; set waffle maker @ 4.5 and it turned out perfect!  It yielded 3 full waffles - delicious as is & with Fresh strawberries ??

This receipt was good but not great. My waffles were not fluffy what-so-ever. I followed some of the suggestions to add 4 tbsp sugar, 1/2 c. Butter and 1 3/4 c. Of milk. I did not heat up the milk and I’m wondering if that’s why mine didn’t turn out fluffy?

The waffles were very delicious, a great recipe. The only thing is it’s just a tad bit too salty. Next time I would only put 1/2 a teaspoon or no salt at all.

followed it exactly and they were great. for those reviews saying "tasted too much of baking soda" re read the recipe. it calls for baking POWDER, not soda. if you do not have POWDER, and want to substitute with soda, you have to reduce the amount  to half of what the recipe asks for, and also add an acidic component, like for example, buttermilk instead of milk, or just a tiny bit of vinegar

These were absolutely perfect: crispy outside, fluffy inside. Classic waffles. I reduced to 5 servings and it made 10 waffles. Love, love, love.

I added an additional tsp of  baking powder, 4 tsp of corn starch, and changed the fat to 2 ounces melted butter plus 1 ounce canola oil.  I used 2% milk as that is what I keep in the house.  I beat the liquid ingredients with an immersion blender, whisked into the dry and then used the blender to whip it all up.  It made 4 waffles in my Black and Decker round Belgian waffle maker.  They were light and crispy.  Served with a warm syrup of blended pure maple syrup, cream cheese and butter.  Yum!  I have been considering ditching my inexpensive waffle maker and splurging on the Breville Smart Waffle maker... but this modified recipe might change my mind!

The ingredients ratio is very good. I made some minor adjustments:
- mixed some buttermilk powder into the warm milk
- separated the York and white. Beat egg white with electric mixer and fold into the batter the last
- I preheated the waffle iron while making the batter. My problem before was the waffle iron was not hot enough. This time it really made a difference. 

The waffles turned out really delicious. Fluffy inside and crispy on the outside.

These were good, non-fancy waffles, and with Vermont maple syrup and melted butter, they tasted great.  To the few folks who complained that these tasted too much like baking soda, well, that might be because the recipe didn't call for any; it                                                                             called for baking powder. Always read the recipe beforehand. Then, read it again.

I make this every weekend for my foster kids. They love them. Only think I do different is just throw all the ingredients together and mix them up. They come out great. I’ve tried adding cinnamon but it doesn’t do so well. I’ve done chocolate chips. If you don’t mind the mess then they’re great!

This recipe is very tasty. The waffles are not very sweet and it is good, because my kids eat them with sweet toppings. But I believe that there is a mistake in this recipe. There are too much baking soda and salt in it. As for me, I added only 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of baking powder.

very heavy  . made exactly as video showed. thought something was a little off with ratios  of ingredients. and always , always trust your gut instinct . This recipe didnt make 5 but rather 4.5 , batter became thick and heavy and sticky . no taste so something was definitely missing texture of a true waffle was just not there .

I’ve used many waffle recipes over the years, but this turned out to be one of the best I’ve ever tried. The only difference is that I soured the milk first by adding 2 tbls of vinegar to the milk and letting it sit for about 5 minutes before mixing it in. I also used 1/2 cup of butter (one stick) like other reviewers. Easy and delicious. I’ll definitely make this one again!

Used 6 T butter, 3 T sugar and added some cinnamon and flax seed.  We beat the egg whites to soft peaks and folded it in at the end. This was really good.

Delicious and fluffy waffles. Turned out beautifully. The only changes I made was to substitute 1/3 cup oil for the melted butter, since I was out of butter. I also whipped the egg whites until stiff peaks and folded into the batter at the end as was suggested by some reviewers.  It made them perfectly fluffy. Next time I'll double the recipe as it just made 5 waffles in my Belgian waffle iron and I have a hungry family. I definitely will make it again!

First time, I followed the recipe exactly and these were overwhelmed with the taste of salt and baking powder.  We had to chuck them out!  

Next batch, we used only one quarter the amount of baking powder and half the salt.  This modified recipe was spot-on perfect!

These turned out great. Even though we don’t eat waffles very often, I will be making them again. I made all and will freeze the extra for later.

this is a fantastic base recipe.  It is a little bland to taste and a bit thick as made.  2nd time I added cinnamon and nutmeg and a little more milk to loosen it up a bit.  my actual star rating is 4.8 because of my additions.  thank you for posting this base recipe.  it will be easy to add things to it like banana, berries, chocolate chips, or the ever important pumpkin!

second recipe I tried-what a difference melted butter and double the sugar makes.  my mom claimed,  “Always taste the dough and you’ll know how the final product will taste.”. In this case,  the batter is   flavorful and predictive of a great waffle.

This morning my husband woke up and asked for waffles for breakfast.  I was out of our usual waffle mix, so I went to my trusted site (this one) for a good recipe.  I made this one, following the directions to the letter, and I may never buy waffle mix again.  They were wonderful.   The extra ones I laid on a cooling rack so as to not get soggy.  I put them into a  zip lock bag and stashed them in the freezer.

Fluffy, crispy waffles.  The batter lasted in the refrigerator for three days and still gave good results. I plan to add some malted milk powder next time.

This is a really good recipe! I've made it so many times for my family. The only thing I would change is that you beat the eggs, then add in the melted butter, then milk then vanilla. If  I don't do it in this order, it will curdle sometimes.

Following the recipe as is, the waffles are quite heavy and chewier than I would like.

The waffles were bland, more sugar was needed and it was very doughy and compressed in the middle.

Very light and fluffy! I took the advice in one of the reviews to sift the dry ingredients, and I think that contributed to the great texture. This made 5 waffles (not fully filled to the edges) in my standard Belgian waffle maker.

OMG so good!!!! Just got a waffle maker and followed this recipe, taking into account a few additions per reviewers, and it is so very good. Doesn't even need syrup. Thanks for the excellent waffle recipe! I used 4T sugar, 2tsp vanilla and 1-3/4C milk.

Great tasting waffle and so easy to make, that I have made this several times now.  I added a little extra vanilla.  I have a traditional round waffle maker and cooked on max for 3 mins and they came out perfect every time.  I got 6 large waffles.  They also freeze great, wrap in foil individually and store in ziplock bag.

Loved how light and fluffly  the waffles were.  The only change I made was to use  1/2 white flour and 1/2 wheat flour.

Lemme tell y'all, these things are good. These waffles are the perfect texture and taste like something I would pay for at a restaurant.Make sure you read the directions closely however because it took me longer than I care to admit to realize it says 1 & 1/2 cups milk and not 11 1/2 cups.

I've made these previously, as written, and really liked them. I use half as much salt. 
Today I had no milk, so used 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream and 1 cup water, instead. Super great.
Makes 9 waffles in my rectangular machine, enough for 2-3 people. I usually try to just cook 8, overfilling my machine. See the funny photo.

Absolutely delicious!  I made no changes in the recipe at all. I only added blueberries. This is so easy and I loved the suggestion about mixing it in the blender!  I will definitely make this my official waffle recipe! Thank you for sharing the recipe.

I put all the ingredients in one bowl instead of 2 separate ones. It works better and there are less dishes to clean and put away.

A good solid recipe. Quick and easy to make. I substitute oil for butter (go by feel) but other than that follow the recipe. Yum

It's a great recipe to make just the perfect waffles.. I'd used wheat flour instead and it turned out lovely. Probably add a little more milk   and enjoy your waffles!

Very fine and crispy. I made it even without the reccomended butter, and it still tasted amazing. After pre-heating, i decided to put butter on the bottom of the pan, which made it a little better. I reccomend putting toppings when you're done, without it it will taste plain. Overall, delicous and easy.

These waffles are very bland and bread like.  I was so disappointed I tossed the rest of the batter away.  I bake bread, pies, pastries, all from scratch. These may be fine fir kids but why eat something so boring and heavy if you can make it better.  The best waffles I have ever had are yeast based and sourdough starter waffles.  These are light, buttery and full of flavor.

Waffles turned out great! I was afraid they wouldn’t because I only had one egg. Still turned out excellent. Held up well in the refrigerator to make the next day. I’d advise naysayers that recipe calls for baking powder not baking soda. That may be the difference.

Made this as is. The family all agreed they tasted good but quite salty and reminded the kids of pretzels. I see from the other comments a lot of people modified. I think it's a good base recipe to start with. Thanks for the share.

This is my go to recipe for waffles. I did change the recipe after reading some comments and making the first batch exactly as written. I made this with 5 Tbls. of sugar, 1/2 cup butter and 1 Tbls. of vanilla extract. We like things a little sweeter, so 5 Tbls. of sugar are just right for our family. This recipe makes 4 large waffles. Any leftovers get finished before the end of the day, everyone loves them.

Really good, just changed the sugar for a packet of sweetener, because my dad is diabetic, and added an extra half cup milk. It came out fluffy on the inside and crispy gold on the outside.

This was one of the best waffle recipe I’ve had!! I did make a couple happy adjustments though! I didn’t have eggs so I used flaxseed meal as a replacement (ratio 3 T of warm water to 1 T of flaxseed= 1 egg). I also added some cinnamon and a dash of nutmeg. I make waffles almost every weekend and this recipe by far was fantastic... buckle up ;)

I needed to make breakfast in a hurry.  This recipe allowed me to make fairly tasty waffles in the short time available.  I am a bigger fan of buttermilk and Belgin waffles, but this worked in a pinch.

Great waffle.... I make it for one serving and use a whole egg (how do you figure out 3/8 of an egg!). I usually pour everything into one bowl and stir. Keep it simple.

This recipe is really easy to just add chocolate chunks into, and easy to store in the freezer for a quick breakfast. I've been making this recipe for almost two months and I don't see myself slowing down!

We made these waffles with our homemade easy peasy strawberry sauce and oh man it was so so good! We did make them crisper on the outside by brushing some olive oil on the waffle iron first and setting it to the medium-high setting.  Check it out here @ cradlekitchen.com

I followed everything that was written but still the waffle tasted like it had too much baking powder.  Gonna try it again this time using only 2 tsp of BP.

Very easy to make!   Waffles turned out great.   Recommend a high heat setting.  You want the outside nice and brown and crispy.    The Cuisinart griddler with waffle plates  is a superstar!   Perfect waffles every time and literally zero clean up.

They were light and fluffy waffles.  I doubled the recipe and with my waffle maker it made 8 waffles.  Two that were eaten today and the rest layered with parchment paper.  Will bake in 350 degree oven for 15 mins  for breakfast at a later date.  I used a gluten free flour mix and warmed almond milk.  This is now my go to recipe for home made waffles.  So much better than the pre-made frozen waffles in the grocery store.

I read a much earlier review about possibly the recipe has to much baking soda and tasted horrible.  The recipe doesnt call for baking soda it is baking powder.

Waffles were great.  My family totally destroyed them.  I was out of vanilla extract so I used lemon extract instead.  Nice change up in a pinch.  As other have suggested,  I added one teaspoon of ground cinnamon.  I also used 3/4 buttermilk + 3/4 cup 1% milk (what we have on hand).

Great tasting waffles.  We made Mickey Mouse waffles for the kids.  They could of been more Krispy but it's probably the waffle maker.  A minute in the toaster is all it needed!

These were excellent waffles. They fluffed up nicely and weren’t rubbery like waffles can be sometimes. I added pecans because you just have to! ??. Will definitely make these again.

My kids liked these but they were only okay.  I added extra sugar and vanilla. They said they tasted a little like egg and just weren’t as good as other recipes we’ve used... I am gluten free and couldn’t try them.

This is the best waffle recipe I have tried.  I find that whisking the eggs and then the liquid mixture thoroughly leads to waffles that are very fluffy.

When trying to make a bigger batch, the ratio of wet to dry ingredients was very off. Even while not adding 1-1/4 cup milk than asked the batter was too watery. So after my second attempt with this recipe the waffles turned out as showed in the picture.

Turned out great! Our 8 yr old niece helped make them, (her first time making waffles) and the recipe was easy for her to follow. Served with my mother-in-law’s blueberry compote recipe! Perfect dinner for a rainy night!

Quick and easy. With a 3 year old who wants to eat "now", I was able to whip these up quickly and they were delicious! The second time around I added some blueberries, also delicious!

Great easy waffle recipe! If you want them crispier, add some cornstarch in place of the flour.  Another review with 1 star complained about too much baking soda....just remember the recipe calls for baking powder, not soda, or you are going to have a ruined breakfast! ;)

It's a perfect recipe, I did it at least 30 times and the only change I did is cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon, then find your way with experience.

This waffle recipe was awesome! I've been searching for a recipe for a while and I haven't found one quite like this one. I changed the recipe a little bit by adding more milk. This made the batter flow smoother into the waffle maker.

These were incredible!!
I got a vertical waffle iron from my kids and we made this recipe. I had to add about 1/2 cup more milk to make the batter a little thinner so it would fill the waffle maker better. They were amazing! Everyone loved them.

This recipe makes a delicious, classic waffle.  I toss in about a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar in the milk to sour it (or use buttermilk or real sour milk).  Our family enjoys a bit of sour it adds to the flavor of pancakes and waffles.  Easy to make, this is a go-to on a Sunday morning when you don't have a lot of time.

Really great basic recipe for waffles. I followed the directions as written and my family thought they were nearly perfect. We're usually the family that cuts the amount of sugar called for in half but, in this case, we all thought they should be slightly sweeter.

These waffles were great!  Tasty on their own, though they are a great vehicle for whatever you put on them.  Only changes I made was whipping the egg whites into soft peaks and folding in at the end and I used a dairy free milk.  Thanks for the recipe!

I ran out of waffle mix and decided to make them from scratch.  These were so much better than store bought mix, and easy to make too.  My husband loved them too.

My favourite waffle recipe! I usually half the recipe though because i am making for just myself. Also, I love adding cinnamon to the batter, tastes delicious once cooked!

Great.  I ran out of milk so I used Greek yogurt instead and a little water to thin the batter.  It was great!

I laughed off some of the negative reviews, noting that they mentioned baking soda instead of baking powder. I made as written except for halving the recipe, but then found the batter to be extremely thick (too thilck to spread on the waffle iron), so I added a few extra tablespoons of milk. Still a disaaponting outcome. We found these far too dense and salty. Even with butter and warmed syrup, neither of us finished our half.

Most awesome waffle recipe. I made it up in my blender as recommended by another reviewer, tweaked a TINY bit (1 Tbs more sugar; 1/4 tsp LESS salt). This recipe made enough that I was able to freeze many for later. Very light, crispy edged waffles. ??

For the person who gave 1 star...she did not read the recipe correctly.    It calls for baking  POWDER not baking SODA.  So that is why it tasted salty.   People complain who don't read the instructions correctly should read the whole recipe before they start to assemble the ingredients.  But no one is perfect and I also have made mistakes.  Can you believe that!!!X!!!!

There's absolutely no need to add the sugar, the recipe tastes great without it. Besides, we all eat too much sugar anyway, so cut it where you can.

I didn't make any changes to the recipe when I made these.  I felt they lacked flavor and seemed dry.  I tried cooking them less but that didn't help.  Even my kids tossed them.  I'll keep searching for a better recipe.

Never fail recipe.  Works great with buttermilk too.  I just throw all ingredients in the blender and give it a whirl.  Perfect fluffy, light, and crispy waffles every time.

These are great. Haven’t made waffles in years. I followed the tip of another reviewer and separated the yolks from the whites, whipped the whites, folded the whites in gently and it made for lighter waffles.

Served them with fruit, whipped cream and maple syrup. Only issue i had was that I should have doubled the recipe.

Eh... Its good but not great. The buttermilk flavor of a box mix beats this recipe in my estimation.

Followed recipe verbatim as it was my very first time using a wafflemaker given by a friend as a housewarming gift. Found this recipe and turned out fine.  Though it's a bit hard when waffle is cold.

Made as written......and turned out wonderful....FYI Aacademianut.....you are confused. There is a big difference between baking soda and baking powder. This recipe does not call for baking soda as you obviously used...Think about it!

The perfect waffle. Absolutely delicious, they go crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. Not too sweet so can be served with bacon and maple syrup. The mix made 16 waffles so good few servings.

I used this recipe for Father’s Day and it turned out to be rubbish, it had way to much salt and baking power. These where so salty (even after I added extra sugar) I had to chuck the whole batch amd the waffles that I had made, I would not recommend this recipe to anyone.

First time I followed it to the letter, and was too salty, I had to throw out and start over. Reduced salt to 1/4 tsp, and reduced sugar to 1 tbsp. My butter is salted, maybe that was the problem. Once adjusted, it's a great recipe.

This is our favorite waffle recipe, and one of the few recipes that I don’t make any changes to at all. They come together so quickly and are perfect every time! They aren’t too sweet, have a great light but chewy texture, and crisp up beautifully.

Made exactly like recipe. It makes light and soft fluffy waffles if you use the waffle maker indicator lights but if you want crisp golden brown just watch for the steam to almost quit before opening waffle iron.

These came out great. I used 1 cup whole wheat, and 1 cup AP flour without consequence. I also used almond milk as it was all I had on hand. Took advice from others and beat the whites, folding them into the final batter at the end.

We love this recipe. The family agreed that it’s much better than any store bought mix. We do agree with so many other reviews, it needed more sugar and the 5 tablespoons seems to be the right amount for us.

This is my favorite waffle recipe! I have to eat gluten free, and this recipe is great to swap my GF flour for regular. My husband has even used this recipe with regular flour and loves it. I'm very happy that we can use this recipe no matter which flour we use.

I have to admit that I've made these beauties many times, and my favorite version is with cinnamon, lemon zest, blueberries, and olive oil. They are FANTASTIC!!!!!

I would suggest that you eat it hot!! Quite delectably fluffy. Has a lovely feeling in the mouth area. Kind of a bland taste. Fruit or syrup would be suggested. I’d give it a 69/100

I love this recipe!!! I did change it a bit, instead of 4 teaspoon of  baking powder I did 1 1/2 -2 teaspoons baking powder, added a bit more sugar and vanilla. I also made it one stick of butter instead of 1/3 of butter. It was really good waffles very crispy and delicious definitely recommend this recipe and would make it again!

As suggested by others, I used 4 Tablespoons of sugar. I had buttermilk on hand so used that and added 1/2 tsp baking soda plus the 4 tsps of baking powder, which may not have been necessary. Tasted great!

This is my all-time favorite waffle recipe. I've made it dozens of times and never had a failure.  Most waffles, even in restaurants, taste like nothing. These have a nice, light vanilla flavor and cook up perfectly in a waffle iron.  I will never make another waffle again, these are so good.

I added just a bit more vanilla. I think next time I’ll add 1 T instead of 1 t. I also want to try upping the butter (1/2 c) and sugar (4 T) like others have suggested.

I just made these and they turned out great! I substituted the baking powder with baking soda and instead of  2 tablespoons of sugar and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract I used 3 tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract. I highly recommend and I most definitely will be making these again. :)

My husband and I just bought a new waffle maker, I found this recipe and thought I would try it. We cut the recipe in half and found it a little too thick so we added a little more milk. 
They were delicious with strawberries and maple syrup.

I made these waffles again this morning exactly as the recipe called for (oops no I used buttermilk) but I have used milk in the past they're awesome and you can maybe add just a slight pinch of cinnamon not too much it'll overpower the waffles. And I mean like 1/4 or 1/2 tsp tops...be very careful with the cinnamon! but the kids love this one.

Made about 7 waffles and froze 6 for later.  Used buttermilk instead of regular milk and added about 4 tbsp of oil with the butter. Crispy crunchy goodness!

I made it for Father's day and it was really good. The only thing I did differently , was I added 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract. It really brought out the flavor more.

Waffles came out fine, but were a bit sweet for my taste. This recipe seems to place its emphasis on formability; it makes really nicely formed waffles easily. Due to the sweetness and intensive ingredient requirements, this is not the recipe I'll be settling on.

Substituted like crazy! I used brown sugar instead of white and 1 cup almond milk and 1.5 cups orange peach mango juice (I ran out of milk). I also added 1 chopped banana. Turned out amazing!

I made the following changes. I used self raising flour, 4tbs white sugar, 2 sticks of butter.  I beat the eggs in one bowl. In another I beat the warmed milk and butter until very fluffy. I combine these two bowls, then add the combined dry ingredients to the wet. (Paul Hollywood recommends adding dry to wet rather than the other way ).

I followed the recipe to a "T". The batter came out very dry so I will add more milk next time.  The flavour was quite subtle and perfect to hi-light the toppings.

Fluffy and delicious. I suggest doubling the recipe, as it only makes about a half dozen full sized waffles. You'll need more for more than two people!

I am not sure what I did wrong but I followed the recipe and when I poured my milk mixture to the flour, it became thick as bread dough. Was I suppose to add more milk after the mixture?

I was a fan of those recipes that called for beaten egg whites, they do make the waffle lighter and crisper. But tonight I wasn't quite up to the whole thing, this was in my collection and I figured why not. Followed the recipe exactly and they were perfect, I honestly couldn't tell them apart from the fancier ones.

Great recipe! We served them with cool whip, fresh strawberries, and syrup at a family brunch. They were a hit.

We also did a modified batch for a savoury waffle, replacing the vanilla with about a 1/3 cup of green onions and 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese (in a double batch). Those were fantastic served with sour cream if you don't like sweet things for breakfast.

OMG it was sooooo good. But one thing is if you are eating it without syrup then triple the sugar  (dont worry its not that sweet) and even if you are eating it with syrup or not, half the baking powder it doesnt need that much. For a lighter waffle beat the egg whites and fold it through

I made these amazing fuffy waffles that were super golden and rich in taste. I did make a few changes. I separated the eggs and beat the egg whites until they were stiff peaks and folded them in just before I put them on my waffle iron. I added two teaspoons of vanilla extract instead of one. Overall I had eight amazing fluffy and crispy waffles. I will definitely use this recipe for all my future waffles.

Delicious. I cut the recipe in half and it made two waffles. Just enough for my wife and I.  I placed them on a plate drizzled with honey, placed an egg cooked over-easy on top then topped with a little syrup. Cut strawberries and blueberries sprinkled in confectioners sugar in one corner and a couple strips of bacon in the other and the plate was picture perfect. Added a Bloody Mary as the Sunday morning beverage. Great breakfast.

My kids love it. Didn't change anything. For the complains about too much taste of soda, I think they mixed up baking soda with baking powder. There is NO baking soda in this recipe at all.

These waffles were great. The only thing I changed was I separated the eggs and beat the whites to soft peaks. I folded the whites into the batter last. Such light, fluffy waffles! So good!

Just made this morning for my hubby’s entire family and they LOVED them! I did tweak the recipe: 5T sugar, full stick of butter, 2 tsp vanilla, and I separated the eggs and beat the whites until stiff and folded them in. I made the batter the night before and put it in the fridge.

I halved the ingredients as the full recipe would be too much for me. I found that the final batter is a little too thick and indeed the resulting waffle is thick and surprisingly salty despite the sweet vanilla smell. I think I need to add more milk and sugar to make it  thinner and sweeter.

I followed the recipe to a T, with exception of adding some cinnamon and nutmeg for flavor. They turned out incredibly dry.

I ran out of boxed pancake mix. My son really wanted me to make waffles for breakfast, because of course it tastes better when mom makes it. I had all the ingredients and am so grateful this recipe was showcased on my favorite website! My 18 year old son said these were the best waffles he's ever had. They were fluffy and cooked perfectly in my waffle maker. This is definitely the best tasting waffle recipe I've ever made and love that it's from scratch. Thank you for helping me look like the perfect mom!

Made these and they are yummy, just like what momma makes back home. My friend from Germany has made these but didn't know what a cup was so used a mug shaped like a monkeys face head... they and they didnt' turn out that nice. He's not very clever to be honest so am not surprised.

Easy recipe.  Made per the instructions.  They were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside, and they tasted like donuts or Churros without cinnamon.  My family loved them.

I beat the eggs and used 1/2 the salt.  Cut strawberries to top them but they were limp and tasted way too salty.  Maybe it was my waffle iron but the next time I'm craving waffles I guess I'm going to the Waffle House.

I love this recipe.  It has just the right amount of sweetness and vanilla as is for breakfast. Per a review, I did separate the eggs, added the yolks with the wet ingredients and folded in the whites at the end.  It gave the waffles a light, airy texture.  I also wanted to add that the recipe would have had 5 Stars if it had any kind of time and temperature guidelines.  I have a Bella 8-1.  Per instructions, I wiped the plates with vegetable oil prior to cooking, preheated it to 400F and cooked for 7 minutes.  6 is adequate if you want to freeze them and toast them later. Didn't stick and didn't make a mess of my Bella.

Love it. Light and fluffy. But I would definitely go less with the baking powder the next time. 2 spoons should do it instead of 4.  Add an extra dash of milk. Original recipe is a bit on the dry side.

Based on the reviews I made some minor changes, I reduced the salt by half and added an extra 1/4 cup of milk. I also used gluten free flour. My kids thought they were good and they were gone in minutes.

Meh. They’re all right. I was expecting more with all the five star reviews. They were a bit dry and stiff for me. I’m going to try a true Belgian waffle recipe next time I think. These were passable and edible but nothing I’d make again with all the breakfast options out there.

I will make these again for sure.  Almost every time I've made waffles previously, I found them soggy.  This recipe, however, made beautiful crunchy waffles.  I did not alter the recipe at all and it made just the right amount.

my family enjoy these waffles. I sifted the dry ingredients and folded in the  whipped egg whites. I think that was the trick

I made no substitutions and have made these twice. I've never made waffles from scratch and my husband is on a strict diet for medical reasons (no more eggos, lol). Anyway, he LOVED these waffles! Said they were the best he's ever had (no, eggos are not the only ones he's had). I will make these many times again and for fun will play around with adding things (optional favors & fruit etc). It's been tricky trying to figure out exactly how much batter to make and not have leftover. Would love to know if the batter would be safe to save for the next day.

Wow this was so good!  I made a few changes based on reviews.  I upped the vanilla to 2T.  More vanilla makes everything better.  And I made it all in a blender - wet ingredients then dry.  Why didn’t I think of this sooner?! Huge hit in my family!

They are really tasty but too thick to pour into my vertical waffle maker.  I have to remix the batter a few times to get it to fall in.

The important distinction between baking powder and baking soda makes all the difference in this quick delicious waffle recipe.  As written it made 7 belgian waffles on my hamilton beach waffle iron.  Next time i'll double the recipe.

I should give it 4.5 stars as my kids loooooved this!!! I followed the recipe as written but added in two extra tablespoons of sugar. Really tender and yummy.  I personally prefer a crispy on the outside waffle and these are rather soft.  I will read more of the reviews later to see if someone has a comment on how to change that.  My kids love the softer waffles so this is perfect for them.

This is one of those "everyone should have" recipes.

Two notes: 

1. Make certain your milk and eggs are room temperature. The recipe says to have warm milk, but set your eggs out too.

2. The recipe lends itself to spice as well. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and it amped up the flavor marvelously.

First time making from scratch waffles and using my new waffle maker. My husband who loves waffles said they were "Very good" (and he is fussy). Myself, I prefer pancakes but ate a waffle this morning and I really liked it! The taste is soft and buttery, and they were just right golden brown with a 5 minute cook at 425. Awesome. I will be using this recipe a lot. Thank you!

Phenomenal waffles! Never buying Eggo again! Like other reviewers suggested, I upped the milk to 1 3/4 cups, the sugar to four tablespoons, and the butter to 1/2 cup. In addition, I also added 1 tablespoon of vanilla extract and 1-2 teaspoons of cinnamon. Flavor. Explosion! The cinnamon adds a wonderful hint of flavor! Beforehand, I had never made waffles before, and now I make them nearly every weekend! Tip: if you’re looking for fluffy waffles that are also crispy on the outside, instead of whisking your whole eggs together, only include the egg yolks in the wet mixture and set aside the egg whites. After you’ve combined the wet and dry mixture, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold the, into your waffle mixture. It makes a world of a difference!

I made this recipe but only needed a half batch so I halved all ingredients. As for salt, I only used a dash. They were delicious however on my next batch I will add a little extra vanilla.

These came out delicious, crisp on the outside and fluffy in the middle. I did, however, add an extra tbs of sugar and tsp of vanilla, and a few extra drops of milk because the batter was just a little too thick. I think just those small additions made it a 5.

A good recipe for waffle batter that is flexible with different temperatures.  Crisp or pillowy soft, this is delicious.  I added a dash of cardamom and cinnamon for flavor.

I made this recipe in a pinch.  I followed the exact directions.  It needed something else to please my palate, they were a bland.

I used 1 cup wheat flour and 1 cup chickpea flour. I substituted sucanat for sugar. I added pumpkin and cinnamon, ginger, and clove this time. These were delicious!

So I reviewed this recipe earlier and said it was way too salty. It turns out that due to a kitchen mishap, we had some salt get mixed in with our sugar, and that is why the recipe was so salty. I thought it was strange because I had made a half recipe a week earlier with some modifications and it was fine. I will mention that the Betty Crocker waffle recipe calls for 1/4 the salt. I may stick with that.

This recipe is an amazing base for any kind of waffle flavors you can come up with. So far I’ve done plain, double chocolate, and banana coconut. Today I think I might try an apple cinnamon by switching out the eggs for applesauce and adding a bit of cinnamon with a traditional cinnamon bun drizzle. Amazing!

I don't know how these got high reviews. The only thing going for these waffles is that they do puff up nicely and have a good texture.  But there is no taste. Except of baking soda.  I thought that 4 tsp was going to be too much and I was 100% correct. So the waffles end up being slightly bitter and you can't taste the butter or vanilla at all.  I ended up ending some spices after the first one to give them flavor but nothing could help the bitterness.

I followed the recipe exactly, and tasted awful. The waffles were too soggy, salty and tasted a bit like bland pancakes. I tried adding more sugar and vanilla after the first batch turned out so bad, but it didn't improve anything. I don't recommend this recipe at all.

I'm still looking for that perfect waffle recipe (maybe some of it is the way I mix ingredients, how much batter goes on the waffle iron, etc who knows), but this comes pretty darn close!  I used a half teaspoon salt instead of a whole.  Only real change I made.  Well also I may have gotten just a little more vanilla in the batter than recipe called for.  Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly and the waffles turned out perfectly. The batter did not stick to the iron even without cooking spray. I cooked using the longest time setting on the waffle iron and they came out crispy golden brown. The recipe makes exactly 4 waffles for my Cuisinart waffle maker which was great because there was no waste. I'll be making every weekend!

I separated the egg whites, whisked them and folded them into the batter as the last ingredient. I also used pumpkin spice extract instead of vanilla. The next time, I will use 1 1/2 to 2 tsps of the pumpkin spice extract since it made a light pumpkin spice taste with only 1 tbs.

This is my go to recipe for waffles. They always turn out amazing. The only thing I do differently- double or triple the recipe, especially if you have kids. I can honestly say this one (if I don't double or triple it) will be gone as quick as I make them.

The waffles came out great. Crispy and yummy. The only thing i added was a drop or two of almond oil to the mix which gave it a unique and delicious flavor.

For those complaining that these waffles taste like baking soda, here's a tip: Try sifting your flour first, and then notice that the recipe calls for baking POWDER, not baking soda. Slight but important difference.

This was great. I added 1/4cup more milk because it was a bit thick and doubled the vanilla. Really excellent taste and texture.

Awesome waffles.  No problems here whatsoever.

Acadamianut, there is NO baking soda in this mixture only baking powder...that could be your problem as to why you taste too much.  Try again with the baking powder and you will most likely have a different outcome.  Good luck.

Everyone loved these. Really  good! I separated the eggs and put the whites in last, as people suggested.  Extra batter went in the refrigerator and we made more a few days later - excellent.

Made it with extra sugar and butter like some suggested and less salt and baking powder....find it floppy and bland. So I added more baking powder and a lot of brown sugar (guessing about 5-7 rounded tablespoons).

Wonderful homemade waffle mix! Although my 5 year old daughter and I love whole wheat, so I made them using 1 cup whole wheat flour and 1 cup all purpose flour. Followed the recipe exactly the same otherwise and they turned out amazing! They taste like my homemade whole wheat pancakes, only as waffles! :)

I was looking for a basic recipe that I could turn into gluten free. This one was perfect. I just used gluten free flour and I also added ground flax seed.  They were good and fluffy. I will make them again and again.

Easy to make with how simple the recipe is. Plus, most importantly, it's DELICIOUS. This was my first time making waffles and, surprisingly, nothing went wrong. I kept them in the waffle maker for 2 minutes, when I took them out: Perfect.

I did everything as directed, however I only added the egg yolks when instructed to add eggs. I separated the egg whites and beat them until they formed stiff peaks, then folded them in gently as my last step. I added pecans and pb chips to my first batch, and the batter stood up to them very well. Slightly denser than the recipe I typically use, but it makes for a crispier waffle fresh out of the waffle iron. I put my waffles in the oven at about 300 to keep them warm while making them, and these don't sog up, which I've had a problem with using other recipes. All in all, my new go-to!

This is a fantastic and simple recipe. I have seen several negative complaints about them tasting of baking soda.  THERE IS NO BAKING SODA IN RECIPE it is baking POWDER.  I can see why it was a fail.

I stand by my original 5 star rating. I just made these again.  I still add a bit more milk but these crisp up so nicely & are delicious.

Original review: The only change I made was  by adding just a tad more milk because is is super thick.  I just eyeballed it both times but it was not more than a 1/3 cup for single batch and a double batch about a 1/2 cup.  Those who have mentioned them not crispy, I do not think it is due to the recipe. Mine have fluffed every time and crisped nicely.  I will say not all waffle irons are created equal.  For fun, the 2nd time I made them I tried almond extract instead of vanilla and just as good.  My family of 3 children who can be picky and eat very little. Finished these off! My husband and I only got a half of a waffle each, the first time. I learned my lesson and doubled it. It doubled nicely!! For doubling FYI 2/3 cup butter=10 2/3 tablespoons. So 1 stick  & just a bit of another. 

Update: With a double batch we had extra. We have frozen some & refrigerated some to see how they are next day or toasted in toaster.  They are perfect in the toaster!! Way better than the store bought frozen!!
 I'm not a big fan of breakfast for dinner, but this has served us well for a quick & yummy dinner.  We fried sausage links to go with & warmed some t

These were great! The only thing I did differently is that I used applesauce to replace the eggs since I had no eggs. I used 1/2 cup of applesauce in replacement of the 2 eggs and it turned out great.

My family loved these they are sweet and the vanilla is a great add - I think I was a little heavy with the vanilla.  They had to cook longer than when I make Belgian Waffles had to wait until they were crispy.  Great basic recipe for traditional waffles.

So, I rated this 4 stars only because I changed a couple of things ( according to reviews ), and did not have any vanilla extract. I added a couple tbsp. more sugar, and a bit more milk because the batter seemed a little thick. Also, I used a whole stick of butter. This was my first time making waffles from scratch, and I thought they turned out pretty awesome: crispy outside and fluffy inside. I made up extras, and took them to work for breakfast the rest of the week. One thing I am wondering is if self rising flour can be used in place of the flour/salt/baking powder? Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make again !

Such a easy and delicious recipe for waffles! I didn't have any baking soda so substituted all the liquid for club soda and, magically, they turned out fluffy and delicious even without the milk and baking soda! Next time, I will use baking powder but this did for tonight! Delicious !

The recipe was easy to follow, I followed exactly as is and the waffles came out perfect.   My waffle maker is a small one but they still came out ok.

I made these this morning with some edits. I used one reviewer's modifications of extra vanilla, sugar, and butter. But then I realized I had no more eggs and used organic ground flaxseed (soaked 2 teaspoon flaxseed to 3 teaspoon water to replace 2 eggs).

I used 1 c. All purpose flour. And 1 c. Wheat. I also added 2 tbsp. Of veg oil. 
 I whisked the eggs and sugar until frothy. Then added in the milk, butter and veg oil. In a separate dish I mixed the flour, baking powder, salt . Folded into the wet ingredients. Then folded in the vanilla.

In making the classic waffles, I followed the suggestions of two of the positive reviews. I sifted the dry ingredients and added them to the wet ingredients that I had been mixing in a blender. The results were favorable. Family loves it. Oh and one addition is that I added 1 teaspoon baking soda to the dry ingredients.

Yes I'm making this same recipe for waffles for over 12 years now. Make sure you use BAKING POWDER not Baking soda as what recipe called for.  One review from iAcademiaNut said she used baking soda that's why her waffles came out  soggy. 
I use buttermilk instead of plain milk texture and taste is way better.  For vacation s, I put Chico chips, peanut butter chips, blueberries, raspberries or mashed bananas. For toppings I make my own mixed berry sauce or powdered sugar aside from maple syrup

Big change. If you separate  the eggs and beat the whites separately then fold them into the batter, your waffles will be light and airy. THIS MAkes a HUGE difference.

These waffles are absolutely amazing! The only small change I made was extra vanilla since I love vanilla and alot of reviewers suggested to add more. Luckily I mixed my dry ingredients first before I started with the wet because I quickly realized I was going to have way too much batter for just me and my boyfriend. I took 1 cup of the dry ingredients and put in a zip lock bag for a future time then halved the butter, milk and eggs but kept the vanilla at a full tsp. Also to cut down time and dirty dishes to warm milk and melt butter separately, I just kept the milk in the glass measuring cup, stuck my butter in it and put it in the microwave together for 45 seconds. I plan on mixing up more of the dry mixture to store because these are definitely going to be a weekend staple!

Came out nice and fluffy, along with easy to follow direction. I added a few spices like nutmeg and ground cinnamon, but I know it would come out delicious either way.

So yummy. I even modified it by changing flour to oat flour instead. I added more quick oats (no grind) for the chewy texture. It  makes denser waffles but I reckon healthier version as compared to this. This recipe itself is really perfect EXCEPT I think 4 teaspoons of baking powder is TOO MUCH. It makes the waffles taste bitter and 2 tablespoons of sugar are really not sweet enough too.. I used 2 mountain-full 2 tablespoons of brown sugar. I reduced baking powder to 3 teaspoons only. Tastes perfect!

Delicious and super easy!! My children devoured them faster than I could make them! Nice and crispy too. 

(and anybody that gets limp or soggy waffles, make sure you are using the Baking POWDER the recipe tells you to use and not Baking SODA. There is a difference)

Honestly I'm not sure how to rate these, my kids loved them (ages 6, 4 &1). They gobbled them up. I followed the recipe exactly but felt they were a little dense. I think sifting the flour might help and I was tempted to do so but wanted to follow the recipe.

Best waffles EVER! I've tried a few different recipes, and this one tops them off. Great flavor you don't even need syrup. I substituted the milk with half and half because I didn't have any milk at the time.

There is definitely way too much baking powder and salt in this recipe.  I had my doubts but I don't generally know for sure how much to use. The waffles tasted like baking powder and salt . I was really craving them so I added a metric butt load of cinnamon, added probably 3 more tablespoons of sugar, another tablespoon of vanilla and about a cup more of milk to try and mask the taste.
Also using butter and syrup helped with the taste.
By themselves they're awful.
Smothered in sugar...theyre okay.

YUCK! Don't bother making this recipe. Way too much soda even though I only used 3 tsp. It is unpalatable. I may throw this in the garbage. Other than too much soda, this is basically  pancake batter. Very heavy and cake like.  Not what I was shooting for.  I suggest looking for another recipe.  I hope this saves you from wasting good ingredients.

This was great, made it twice already. Careful not to use too much salt or baking powder or it will be salty. Excellent. Used soy milk once instead of regular milk and was great too.

I wanted waffles and was out of mix. Found this recipe and am quite happy with it. Used a half a cup of butter (didn't feel like cutting the stick ;)) and an extra tablespoon of sugar. 

Delicious!

The batter looked perfect but when we put these in our iron they were super hard. I would not suggest this recipe to people who want a quick breakfast. After the waffle fail I tried to make pancakes, they worked out. I don't really know what else to say about this recipe...

As a gluten-free caterer, this is the absolute best recipe I've found that easily and successfully converts to gluten-free. . Light, airy and absolutely delicious. If you're a Celiac this is definitely the recipe for you.

I just bought a cast iron waffle griddle and was super excited to try it out.  This recipe looked like a good one to start with.  I halved it since I am the only one I'm cooking for.  Also, I discovered too late that I was out of vanilla extract.   I had some Almond extract on hand so I used that instead.  I like it so much that it may become the full time ingredient for me.  I preheated both sides of my griddle and oiled them well.  About half a cup of batter was what I needed to get a nice, full iron and still fit the lid on without batter oozing out the sides.  Two minutes on the timer for each side.  These were awesome!  Fluffy, full of flavor and a little crispy on the outside.  I am hooked!  I can see a lot of room to customize this recipe for different things and look forward to trying different things.  Oh, and with the halved recipe I got 3 full waffles.  I could only eat 2 of them so I wrapped the 3rd one and stored in the fridge for later.

The batter was so thick, as in if I  could knead in flour I would have a pizza crust, or loaf of bread.  The waffles were so dense and thick.  Not sure what happened, perhaps because I used whole wheat flour?  It was white whole wheat, a wonderful King Arthur flour.  I also used skim milk, but do not think that would make any difference.  Anyway, if making waffles a bit healthier causes this outcome I am not interested in making this recipe again.  I will say, the vanilla extract was a great touch, I used good vanilla extract.

I make this almost every month. Great for the freezer (just slightly under cook and pop them in the toaster). I do use buttermilk instead of the warm milk every time!

Best waffles I have ever made! Cooked them in my Belgium Waffle maker. I will never buy a mix again. I used self-rising flour, omitting the baking powder. Perfect! I have made these several times. Today I added blueberries to the mix. Delicious!  I store leftover batter  in an airtight container in the Frig. Just as good the second day.

My children love this recipe! We add 1/2 cup of ground chia seeds (in place of 1/2 cup flour). We use coconut/almond milk or 3.25% (whichever one we have in the fridge at the time) and it always turns out great. I always make a double batch and freeze them (pop them in the toaster, later!). Cool waffles on cooling rack, then divide with parchment or wax paper and place in large freezer bag.

Enjoy making this recipe with your children!!

Just made this and I have to say it's the best waffle recipe I've tried. My 8 year old is the fussiest eater in the house and he finally approved waffles made by me from scratch, thanks to this recipe. I took others' advice and added a bit less salt, more sugar, a dash of cinnamon, and I separated the yolk and egg white. The result was  crispy, light waffles that were soft and light on the inside. A contrast to my normally hard, thick, dense batches. Now if only I could get my waffles to be the same color on both sides...( No fault of the recipe. Just my waffle maker.)

I make these in a Belgian waffle maker, and they are very good.  I do up the milk to 2 cups, and up the vanilla to 1.5 teaspoons.  Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly.  Make sure your waffle maker is piping hot to get the crispy outside, and don't forget to spray oil or use cooking spray right before you pour in the batter.  I get about four and a half waffles out of this recipe.

We like these for school day mornings: they fill the tummy but aren't too chewy or heavy.  I used the recipe except that I separated the eggs, whisking the egg whites in their own bowl until soft peaks formed.   I combined the ingredients  but folded in the egg whites last.  These are come out like homemade Eggo waffles, crispy and light.

if you whip the egg whites to stiff peaks  then fold them into the rest of the mix the waffles will be fluffier.

Absolutely amazing!  I was stunned at how delicious these were.  I think that melted butter is the key.  I love these!

I've made this recipe twice now with self rising flour (what I had in the cupboard) The first time I followed a review separating the egg white and whipping it to create fluffier waffles. The second time I made them,  I mixed my dry and wet ingredients separately and then combined. Just as tasty ?? without the hassle! Yummmm

I followed the recipe step by step and the waffle turned out terrible. My husband and kids couldn't eat it as it tasted so strongly of baking soda! It made the waffle very bitter. That's Easter breakfast ruined...

Perfect waffles. Just the right amount of sweetness and we all agree our favorite recipe by far. The vanilla gives them the perfect flavor and they have an excellent fluffy yet cakey and crispy texture that I love. Pretty sure I will never use another recipe. Thank you!

Did great with the ingredient proportion, however it would increase the vanilla to want to have to 2 teaspoons. Otherwise fantastic

I made these waffles this morning and they came out perfect!   The ONLY thing I did different was sprinkle some cinnamon in my dry ingredients (a teaspoon or less...I could have added more...it really makes a nice smell when they are cooking also) and I messed up and dumped my vanilla in with the dry but I don't think that did anything...they came out wonderful!

Best recipe out there and kids love it! Make almost exactly as recipe is given, but use another reviewers suggestions by upping total for sugar to 5 TBSP and Vanilla to 3 TBSP for a bit more flavored taste. I cut down the baking powder to 3 TSP, only because I’m not a fan of the after taste baking powder leaves and this eliminated that after taste.

This is the perfect waffle recipe. I've made it dozens of times over the past few years. They bake up perfect and they are approved by my 11 year old niece because she says she can "taste the vanilla". Thank you for this awesome recipe!!

Amazing! This recipe is so good that my waffles kept vanishing as soon I got them out of my waffle maker.

Delicious! I modified by adding 1 stick (no salt) butter, 5 tablespoons confectioners sugar (in place of regular sugar), 3 tablespoons vanilla extract, mixed all together with the other ingredients right in the blender and then I let my batter rest at room temp. for about 30min prior to cooking in waffle maker so that baking soda can react, making the waffles extra light and fluffy.

This is best waffles recipe I have come across. I make it as directed, EXCEPT to soothe my guilty mom-conscious I put in only 1-3/4 cups of flour and add 1/4 cup wheat germ and 2 Tbsp of ground flax seed for a tiny bit of health factor. You can't even tell those additions are there. Oh, I also put 3 tsp of vanilla just because I love vanilla and want a little more of the flavor. The waffles always come out light and fluffy and delicious. I love eating these with fresh strawberries. Yum!

Very easy, very tasty.  I'm going to leave out the vanilla next time and see how that changes the flavor, but otherwise I really liked these waffles.

This recipe was my first ever!  Recently got a waffle iron and made this recipe exactly! Awesome!  Made six and my husband and I had one and I froze the others in wax paper and put in freezer bag,  not sure how they will reheat, but will definitely make again and won't change a thing!

Just what I was looking for! They were beautiful  and tasty. I added some cinnamon to fit the event. No pictures though because they were all gone before I could get a device. Now I freeze a batch or two every week. They feeze very well so I make at least one batch a week. Waffles literally go with anything!

I made a batch of these specifically so I could freeze them and take them out to toast as needed.  My daughter has to get out the door earlier, and I like this recipe in that it's simple, quick, and healthier than the boxed alternative.  My batter was a bit thick so I added an extra 1/4 cup milk.  She loves them, and because she slathers them with butter after toasting, I substitute canola oil for the butter.

Awesome recipe!  We have a cheap waffle iron, so cooking spray was essential, and I just used a blender as another commenter did to make things a little easier.  My kids couldn't get enough of these!

I have this recipe in my favorites and have made it many times. My variations include real butter, when I have it but good if I don't, 1 tbsp lemon juice, this fluffs the batter, and 1/4 cup maple syrup, adds sweetness and flavor. We generally top them with margarine, cinnamon-sugar, jam, powdered sugar, and/or whipped cream. Pretty much, top them with whatever you prefer. Delicious! I agree with halving the salt and place them on paper towel to avoid sogginess.

Crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, very good waffle recipe.  It was also a little simpler than my normal recipe which called for whipping the egg whites separately. This will be my new go to waffle recipe. We eat them kind of often and cutting down on the prep without sacrificing flavor is a definite plus on busy mornings!

Good basic recipe. My family likes their waffles on the sweeter side so I had to add more sugar and vanilla than the recipe called for.

These waffles are quite easy to make,  but I chose to put the eggs and other liquids in the blender for a smoother finish. After making them unfortunately, the amount of baking soda in this recipe really over powers the taste of them. Too bad, for they were very fluffy and would have good...would cutting the amount of baking soda affect the texture?

I love that these waffles taste just like they came from a mix. There's none of that uncooked flour taste that you can get with some mixes. This makes just enough for three of my waffle maker.

Perfect and extremely fast! Put all of your dry ingredients in one bowl and stir- all wet ingredients in another bowl and stir- mix together- then Wallah!!

Excellent recipe. Light and fluffy but crispy on the outside. I have made these twice now, and always add 1/4 more milk to thin the batter a little more. Seems to make them crisper and lighter. Also excellent with freshly cooked bacon baked into the waffle.

Very solid recipe that produced fluffy waffles with just the right amount of crisp 'crust'. Surprisingly, I thought it needed more salt, which isn't something I ever say. I did use half salted butter and half unsalted because it was what I had. Will make again using all salted butter.  Be careful that you use Baking POWDER, not baking soda! ETA: Made in blender this morning and they were even fluffier! Definitely a go to recipe!

You can make these gluten free!!!! I use gluten free flour (pick a brand that already contains xanthan gum) and double the amount of sugar (per the suggestion of others).  I sift the dry ingredients together. I also separate the eggs (mix the yolks into the wet ingredients, whip the whites, mix the rest of the wet ingredients into the dry then fold the whites in). Perfect!

I added 1/2 tsp extra of vanilla and still found these waffles bland and overly eggy. I will not make this recipie again. Also, I have a vertical waffle maker and the batter was very thick, I couldn't get even half the batter in that I normally do. After fighting through the first waffle, I whisked 1/8 cup of additional milk in, just so I could get the batter into the waffle maker.

I left a neutral review only because I had to comment on the critical reviews complaining their waffles tasted like baking soda.  There is NO baking soda called for it this recipe.  If you are using baking soda instead of the baking powder that it calls for then there is your problem.  Baking soda and baking powder are NOT the same thing.
I have not made this recipe, but I intend to and will review it when I do.

Only thing I did differently is used buttermilk instead of regular. Had to use just a touch more so it wasn't too thick. Beautiful and crispy!

These had a nice texture but almost no flavor. I will try adding a bit of vinegar to the milk to make it curdle a bit and maybe a 1/4 cup of powdered sugar.

Pretty good! I've never made waffles before but I got a waffle iron for Christmas so it was time. I upped the vanilla & added a little cinnamon. I'll be upping the sugar a little next time, but otherwise these turned out great!

Excellent recipe! I made it gluten free and lactose free by using King Arthur Gluten Free flour, lactose free milk, and Earth Balance  that comes in stick form just like butter. I followed the recipe exactly. I also used natural sugar, not the white refined kind. My men ate them and had no idea.

These  waffles were pretty good. I like my waffles with more flavor and sweetness so  doubled the sugar and the vanilla.
I need to add here that these waffles were less crispy on the outside than other recipes I 've made before.

Yum! To those of you who are confused about the recipe, saying it didn't work, perhaps you used baking Soda instead of baking POWDER! That would surely mess it up. Because these are great!

This is our go-to recipe when making waffles from scratch. Sometimes I add cinnamon for added flavor. I also use our own homemade vanilla extract. The only thing I do consistently different is separate the yolk and white. I beat the white until soft peaks form, and then once all the other ingredients are combined, I gently fold in the whipped whites. This makes the waffles fluffy, and is a tip I learned from my Belgium grandfather.

For the people complaining about "too much baking soda," read the recipe closer. It calls for baking POWDER.

There was zero flavor and the texture was very dense. We cooked them until they were very brown and crispy but they still had an uncooked floury taste. Not recommended.

These waffles came out just perfect. I increased the temperature up a notch and brushed my iron with butter twice. It made five waffles using about 3/4 cup of batter each time. I did add chopped pecans for more flavor and served them with homemade whipped cream.

I followed the recipe...almost.  I did fluff the egg whites, added 4 teaspoons of sugar.  The rest was as written.  I forgot to put on paper towels to keep crisp.  Good, really good recipe.  Thanks

I made this for the family this morning.  it tasted great but even with the setting on high they still didn't get brown enough, at least for me.  That could be my waffle maker too so take that with a grain of salt.  The kids enjoyed them so that is all that matters.

I added blueberries after I poured the batter into the waffle iron, before closing it.

These were the best waffles I ever had!  Delicious!

This is overall a great recipe for waffles - I don't like sweet waffles so I only put in 1 tbsp sugar instead of 2.  Otherwise they came out great.  I also found that they're better if you only let them get slightly golden - otherwise they're too tough.

I am so glad I found this recipe. Makes a nice crispy waffle every time. I couldn't figure out how to make them crispy, with the recipe from the manufacturer of my waffle maker they came out soft and fluffy. We like them crispy, I think it is the warm milk and the amount of melted butter.

Turned out perfect! Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I mixed them in my blender and baked them in silicone waffle moulds in the oven. Quick and easy and soooo delicious. Will definitely make again - thank you for the recipe:-) After reading other reviews I thought I should mention I used unsalted butter and only a pinch of salt and had to add some extra milk

This recipe was the bomb. It was the perfect amount for me, my husband and father in law. we had scrambled eggs on the side for dinner. 

changes: I added an extra tablespoon of sugar and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. and the vanilla extract - I put the amount it calls for technically but as I poured it out i let it spill over the sides a bit to give it a little something extra. i used real butter and 1% milk. 

when they cooked it smelled AMAZING. And they tasted AMAZING. and we made ice cream sandwiches with the leftovers and it was AMAZING. 

im making these again!

I used about half a cup of wheat flour and it didn't affect the fluffiness of the waffles at all and added to the flavor. Some of the negative reviews have mentioned the "too much baking soda." Just to clarify, the recipe calls for baking powder, not soda. Baking powder adds to the fluffiness of the waffles and has a relatively mild taste. Baking Soda, on the other hand, has a very strong taste and is usually used in only small quantities.

These were okay. They were kind of bland and mealy 
They fluff up nice and the tip about the warm milk is great.
I just wouldn't eat them plain...they are not yummy all on their own

I thought these were good and so did my 3 kids. My husband in the other hand said it needed more sugar and I don't think adding another tablespoon or two would hurt unless you are watching your sugar intake.

My wife and daughter loved these waffles! They even agreed they didn't need syrup or powdered sugar; the waffles alone were delicious. For my part, I think I'll use one less teaspoon of baking powder because I felt there was a somewhat bitter after taste at times, though I only had about a quarter teaspoon of vanilla extract - maybe the full teaspoon would even that out. Either way, these were amazing and I'm sure my daughter will insist they become a staple of our breakfast repertoire.

this was definitely a 5 star for me and my family.  I tweaked it a bit after reading some of the comments to separate the eggs then fold in at the end...that worked really well because they came up fluffy.  Also I melted Becel instead of butter and it tasted great.  I saw someone else's comment and sprinkled in a couple of dashed of cinnamon...again really good!

These turned out perfect.  To the other review about it being salty, mine was not at all.  I think they must have used baking soda instead of powder, because they even talk about it in their review using baking soda.  A BIG difference!  Of course if you use too much baking soda it will make it salty but this recipe doesn't call for soda does it?  It says powder.  Hello!

These were very good but I felt the batter was very thick and didn't spread around the waffle iron very well. The waffles also came out pretty dense but they were tasty. I'd make these again with maybe a little more milk.

This recipe is absolutely amazing. I have been making these for about a year now and my kids love them. Decided to make them for out of town guests that I knew never experienced a "real" waffle before and they were in love! I do add 6 tablespoons of butter just make it easier and I love a more buttery taste along with an extra tablespoon of sugar.  To keep them from getting soggy, put them on a cooling rack when you take them out instead of a plate. The steam from the waffle not escaping is what softens them up. They also freeze amazing. Just take them out of freezer and pop them straight in a toaster.

Super yummy! I add 3 teaspoons of baking soda instead of 4 and a little extra vanilla. The kids like to add chocolate chips. :)

The only changes I made were I used 4 TBSP sugar and 50/50 (whole wheat/white flour) these are really good. I store the extra in my fridge for an easy before school breakfast.

These were gorgeous, and more importantly, delicious.  I subbed 1/2 a cup of oat flour in, and added some ground flax to make it a little healthier.  Everyone loved them.  Thanks for sharing!

These waffles are great!  The only changes I made were using 1/4 cup sugar, and I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon.  They also froze well, and I'm having a couple from the toaster this morning for breakfast. Will definitely make these again!

Fantastic recipe!  My husband and I make these nearly every weekend.  The only changes I make are: substituting 1/2 cup of the white flour for wheat, and I add a mixture of 3 tablespoons flax seeds and 3 tablespoons of water (let mixture sit for 5 minutes for the seeds to soften) to the liquid ingredients.  With my waffle maker, this recipe yields 3 tasty waffles.

Great recipe and easy to ad lib! I used organic coconut palm sugar (unrefined) instead of white sugar and organic coconut oil instead of butter. I also added a heaping tsp of pumpkin and 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. Lastly, I sprinkled chopped walnuts to give some added nutrition. Delish!

Amazing recipe. Although I noticed a few complaints about the amount of baking powder/salt. You may want to try mixing the eggs, baking powder, and salt to sit for 2 minutes before adding the remaining ingredients. I noticed it made a huge difference in flavor!

No problems mixing or making the waffles but they were sweet for my taste, almost like dessert. Hubby agreed. I'd skip the sugar next time. Plenty of sweetness to go around from the topping! Greek yogurt with honey and sliced strawberries is my fave. Swoon!

I had no eggs, so I used a wikepidia substitute: canned pumpkin. Even though the butter was softened, it turned the batter chunky. There wasn't enough milk, so I had to add some more. They did not cook. I tried putting them all in various sizes and times, but they were either burnt or not cooked evenly. I had to throw them all out, and the cleanup was awful. I think I'll use a different recipie next time.

Batter came out almost as thick as cornbread mix, and too salty. I only used half the salt so I was surprised. I think the butter ought to be unsalted for it to work, and I added water to thin it. Came out better. Also, I just checked about five other recipes and they called for no more than 1/2t salt, some adding only 1/4t, but 4t baking powder seems standard.

I followed Stephanie's recommendation above by using 5 Tbls of sugar and 1 1/4 stick of real butter (melted) and about 3 Tbls of vanilla. We had the waffles in for 6 minutes, and they were perfectly crispy.

Great recipe!  I made them while visiting my folks, as I don't own a waffle maker.  My dad always uses a mix (UGH!), so this was a real treat for him.   :-D   They even got the thumbs up from my fussy 11 y.o., too.

I would prefer less sugar and therefore, less salt -- far too sweet for my taste, with maple syrup on them.  I also whisked the whites separately, to soft peak, and folded them in last.

Very good.  I haven't made waffles from scratch before.  These were delicious.  We had some fresh blueberries to add to ours.  Outstanding.  Much better than a mix.

I dumped all the wet then the dry stuff in my stand up mixer whirled it and into the iron it went, had them for lunch. One of mine wanted blueberry waffles, so I placed a couple blueberries in the dough I ladled out and closed it.  Quick and easy ... Leftovers will get eaten tomorrow for breakfast, if they make it that long thanks for this quick, easy and delicious recipe. I like the waffles when they are neither sweet nor savoury because then you can go either way have savoury or sweet toppings.

This is the BEST Key Lime pie. I'm an upstate NY gal and honestly if you close your eyes while eating it you will think you are in the Keys! I took this to a BBQ and people were moaning in delight. I do top with whipped cream.

I love the original ways to make food sometimes and this is a very classic taste for sure. Simple to make. Love crunch on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside. Even tried one of the side pieces with just butter and gotta say, I could eat it just like that.

I made these waffles as the ingredients & directions are given. They were "plain" waffles, but they are a blank canvas for whatever toppings you want to put on them. They were light & soft on the inside, crispy on the outside.

Delicious!  As per a few suggestions I added more sugar and used a full stick of butter.  Very quick to make and better than the store bought mix.  I know what's in it!!  Oh yeah, I used 3/4 of a cup of my own ground white whole wheat flour.  Will be making these again!  Thx for the recipe.

I'm usually a bisquick weekend waffle mom. This weekend I didn't have any bisquick so I tried this recipe. My variations include unsweetened almond milk, cinnamon, and a tbsp of brown sugar. I'm still unsure if I like this better than my usual box mix but it's definitely close. I'm sure it's healthier and more cost effective. It doesn't take much more effort to make. Coming from a box mix mom, this recipe is something simple and easy. Add syrup and fruit and the family will probably never know the difference.

The waffles turned out crisp and light. I increased the sugar to 4 tablespoons and the vanilla to 2 tsp. I also added 2 tsp of cinnamon and a pinch of nutmeg. I separated the yolks and whites and folded in the beaten whites at the end as others have suggested although it didn't make much difference to the batter texture. This recipe made four waffles in my Presto Flip waffle maker (which uses 1 C of batter per waffle). Recommended recipe and will use again.

I've made these waffles several times (almost every weekend now for the past month) and my entire family loves them. They come out crispy on the outside and warm and almost fluffy inside. They are one of the best waffles I've ever tasted. I can never go back to Eggo waffles again.

However, I did not give it five stars because the recipe does need several addendums to make it perfect. 


1/2 cup (1 stick of unsalted butter) total,
3 Tbls of vanilla extract total,
5-6 Tbls of sugar total,
1 tsp of cinnamon, and
separate egg yokes and fold in whites last.


Bear in mind, my tastes lean on using less syrup so I prefer a sweeter waffle, thus why so much added sugar. I tend to use one Tbls less when I add chopped strawberries to the mix. Fresh fruit really gives the waffles some zing! Also, if you're looking for a healthier edit, substitute 1 1/2 cups of whole wheat flour, instead of the 2 cups of flour. I attempted this once already and was very happy with the consistency and taste.

They cooked up great! 4/5 because the flavor is a little dull so I added some cinnamon, just a pinch as well as about a tablespoon of extra sugar. I did not use warm milk and it turned out fluffy and good. Family approved.

I reduced the servings from 5 to 2. The batter seemed a little stiff so I slowly added maybe another tablespoon of milk. Oh and the reduction said "3/4 egg"...I used the whole egg. Other than that, those were the only changes. It cooked up perfect and yes, I *will* make this again!

This recipe was tasty enough, but it did not make crispy waffles.  I believe it needs about 1/4cup less flour, and 1/4 cup more baking powder.  Also agree with the commenters who said to separate the eggs, whisk the whites, and fold that in to the batter.

I've made these waffles several times to rave reviews from my family. I made a few substitutions this last time but I feel it was the best batch so far. I used half all-purpose flour and half whole wheat flour.  I added a little extra baking powder, cinnamon, and Demerara sugar crystals to the batter. I topped them with homemade whipped cream and sliced strawberries. They were delicious! I'll definitely make them this way again.

We love breakfast for dinner.  Tonight I made these Classic Waffles.  They were so easy to make and so fluffy.  My daughter had two.  As someone else suggested, I'll make up the rest and freeze them.  These were so much better than my old waffle recipe.  Thank you so much.  I'll make these often.  Yum.

Didn't have enough butter on hand, so I substituted veg. oil and added one extra tbsp of sugar to the recipe because I've always liked my waffles on the sweeter side. 

Was a hit at our breakfast table with some simple syrup.

Made them twice. The second time I used what buttermilk I had left in the fridge in place of the regular milk (a  little over a cup, made the rest up with regular milk).  Both times turned out great. I took another reviewers advice and started by whipping the eggs in the blender, adding the rest of the wet, ingredients, mixing again, and then dry and blending just to mix. Made quick and easy work without a ton of mess. I also added about 4 tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of vanilla the second time like another reviewer had suggested. I increased the melted butter to 1/2 cup (whole stick). Nice bit of sweet.

Great recipe, works very well. I followed some of the other commenters' advice and beat the egg whites separately then folded them under at the end. The result is lovely fluffy waffles. My whole family loves these. Thanks for sharing!

Five for simplicity and a four for taste. Definitely a base recipe you can experiment off of and personally recommend adding more sugar and butter for anyone who prefers sweet and savory over the more traditional flour/bread taste the base recipe produces. The texture on these is perfect.

My husband loves these waffles. They're crisp on the outside and tender on the inside. They have the perfect texture. The flavor is little bland to me so next time I plan on adding a little cinnamon or more vanilla.

Delicious! I made this in the blender as other reviewers suggested. I put all the wet ingredients in the blender first and then added my dry ingredients to it. We enjoyed our waffles with strawberries and whipped cream!

My kids love these. Only use 3 tsp baking powder. Sometimes add mini chocolate chips. They do not stay crispy.

I've made these now about 10 times and they are consistently good.   Good standard batter that is easy to modify to your tastes and easy to make.

Today I made them and this time separated the egg whites and whipped them up a little.  I then folded them in the moist batter.  This added a little more lift.   I also use this trick for pancakes.

I also added cinnamon and one peeled and diced apple to the batter.  I chopped the apple into about 1/4 inch pieces, so that they would not cook too quickly and turn to mush.
One apple provided at least one chunk of apple in every bite.  Before adding the apples, i sprinkled them w/ a little sugar and cinnamon.

I wish I could get the outside crisper with a custard texture inside.  Not sure if my iron is hot enough, of if that's a batter issue.  I use a Black and Decker iron w/ standard 4 square mold.

Anyway - taste great and easy to modify.  Its a keeper.

I followed all ingredients and instructions as written and these turned out great! It was also my first time ever making waffles. They weren't dense or time consuming. I will most definitely be using this recipe again in the future and I also like that this is a good "base" recipe and could easily be altered to suit your craving. I think some Nutella added in would be amazing.

Sadly, the waffles came out heavy, flavorless, & not at all crispy.  Still have yet to find a recipe that comes out well without having to separate the eggs.

I immediately saved this to my favorites & will be making them again for sure. The only thing I changed was that I didn't use as much butter as it calls for & it was not missed. These are dense yet nice & fluffy with a slightly crisp outside. I also loved that the batter is thick enough that it didn't ooze out all over my waffle maker. A definite crowd pleaser! BTW, to the reviewers complaining of too much baking soda in the recipe, I must point out that there is NO Baking Soda in the recipe. It is Baking Powder, which will make a huge difference. Try it again with BP, I think you'll feel differently.

Instead of eggs, I used a banana and 3 tablespoons of olive Oil, instead of Vanilla I used a teaspoon of maple syrup. they were delicious, my daughter and I couldn't stop eating them. Hoo I also added a little more water a little less salt.

An OK recipe. I've made it twice by the recipe, and I find it to be a little "doughy" and not crispy enough for my tastes. 

Someone suggested separating the eggs before beating them and folding the whites in towards the end -I might try this next.

To those that say there is too much soda in the recipe, the recipe that shows up for me has baking powder not baking soda.  I've made these often both in blender and in bowls.  For me, no dishwasher here, the bowls are faster clean up.
I have also subbed buttermilk and that is a nice variation.

Absolutely love this recipe.  Nice and crispy. Great to compliment with your favorite topping.  I make a nice cinnamon apple topping to go with it. Completely recommend.

Decent recipe that looks better than they taste. Looked great - tasted alright. Did 1/2 the salt. Probably try with buttermilk instead. Recipe made 3 4-square waffles.

These waffles were perfect! The recipe was extremely simple (as in I could trust a ten year old to do them right) and cooking them only took about five minutes. They're just sweet enough to not need a lot of syrup, and I added some cinnamon to mine to give a little additional flavor. I'll definitely make these again.

These are a hit with my family. We modify ingredients, but not quantities, due to diet constrictions...gf flour, earth balance butter, rice milk, and egg replacer.  They come out great!

I combined some of the suggestions from other reviews. This is the second time I tried this recipe. The first time I thought they were too much like a pancake in texture and not crispy like I prefer. This time around I used oil instead of butter, I sifted the flour, salt, baking powder and sugar together before adding milk (not warm like recipe says) egg yolks, vanilla. I folded in the egg whites last, and let the mix rest about 15 minutes while I heated up my iron. I also cooked them at a 2.5 setting (my iron has a light to dark setting range from 1 - 3). Turned out perfect!

I add more milk to make the batter thinner.  I also add protein powder sometimes and that make it require more milk to combat the thickness.  I use white wheat flour as well by King Arthur.  Delicious!!

I thought the batter was a little thin after I first mixed it up but by the time I started using it the baking powder had activated and it was just right!  Made these for everyone over Christmas break and everyone loved them.  I added a fruit compete, chopped pecans, homemade whipping cream, and maple syrup.  They were awesome!  Oh I used Bob's Red Mill flour and Almond flour instead of regular flour to make them gluten free.

Would like to find a way to make them a little fluffier.  I do plan on making it again, but next time ill add some sparkling water to it, because I've heard that it makes it fluffier and not as heavy.

My first time making  waffles from scratch.  Needs some adjustments, which I'll try to add to batter for next time. As is, tasted bit too much of salt/baking powder and a little bland. I will add more sugar, vanilla and maybe some buttermilk and see if gets better.

This was my second attempt at waffles....these were definitely better than the ones I made from a mix. I tweaked it a little with an extra tsp of vanilla extract and some cinnamon. They were still a little too heavy for my family's taste. I think next time I will add some more milk to thin it out some.

I did a few things different.  I'm lactose intolerant so instead of regular milk, I used soy milk. An other thing I did different was add one extra teaspoon of baking powder. It makes the waffles so much more fluffy and airy in the middle with a perfect crust on the outside. One last thing that I like to add is a 1/2 cup of cooked  oatmeal with cinnamon. It's delicious and much more filling. :) Oh and side note, I forgot the salt but it still tasted great!

Kids said it tasted like baking soda, it overpowered the 1\4 cup almond paste.

I made it exactly as instructed and my son loved them. This was the first time I made waffles from scratch.  I usually would use pancake mix. He definitely noticed a difference.

This batter baked into beautiful Belgian waffles, light, fluffy, really tasty. The batter will thicken the longer it sits, so have a little extra milk ready to thin it as needed. I will definitely be using this recipe again.

Half the baking soda and the salt advised in the recipe... 1 cup of unbleached flour + 1 cup whole wheat/pembina... Cassonade is way better than white sugar! Apart from that, the recipe is very good!

Great Sunday morning treat. Light and fluffy. I used non-gluten flour, fresh blueberries and whipped cream. Very easy to make. Blend wet, add dry, stir, scoop 1 cup into iron, drop on some blubes.  Crisp, light, tasty! Thanks

Substituted melted butter instead of vegetable oil and buttermilk instead of milk. They came out fluffy on the inside and a little crunchy on the outside. In other words, perfection!

This was the first time I made waffles from scratch and not a box mix.  They were so good I am never making waffles from a box mix again.  I followed the recipe exactly but the changed up the method as suggested by reviewer Mom_v_3  on 12/29/2007 by using the blender to whip the eggs first then the other liquids followed by the dry ingredients.  It worked perfect and was fast to prep.

Lookinf for a waffle recipe I could make in advance to have for guests coming to breakfast at different times.  Really easy and quick to mix up. I have not reied it with some of the recommended modifications like brow sugar or applesauce but it could use a Little boos of flavor.
Light airy easy but a tad on the bland side. Easily remedied by adding some fruit on top.

I love this recipe and I will definitely be using it again. The waffles came out light and fluffy, maybe because I used almond milk, but that didn't detract from the flavor. And my boyfriend loved them so it's definitely a keeper!

Very easy recipe and delicious without any modifications. I froze extra waffles and popped in toaster to reheat.

Something went wrong when changing serving size. I noticed it was asking for too much milk. But , since I hadn't made it in a while, or  committed the recipe to memory, I did it anyway. It was way too liquidy, I added another cup of flour.  Came out o.k I e made this recipe before and hadn't had this problem. That is why I only gave it 1 star.

These tasted okay. I made them twice. Once following the recipe and they came out really heavy.  I did beat the eggs very well. The second time I altered it a bit, following the alterations of a commenter that received 1k likes.  They actually tasted worse, very hard to cut, like rubber.  Obviously it's something I'm doing wrong because the waffles I made would not garner 2k favorites, lol.

Added three more tablespoons of sugar, and a 1/2 teaspoon more of vanilla extract. Came out exactly how I wanted. I did nothing special with the eggs or anything. I mixed using a hand mixer.

Amazing! I got a new waffle maker that is stubborn and have been searching for the perfect recipie and here it is! I seperated the eggs and folded in stiff egg whites. Also great when I added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients. At Christians we replace 1/2 the milk with egg nog for a festive spin!

For me, this is the best waffle recipe, hands down. Extremely fluffy. Just perfect. I prefer it with margarine instead of butter, but it's great either way.

Just a note, it calls for baking powder. Not baking soda. Check the recipe before you give it bad reviews.

Really yummy waffles! I make the recipe exactly as called for, except I add more sugar (however much I'm in the mood for). This does make them rather sweet, but my family likes to eat waffles without syrup, usually with fresh fruit. This adjustment makes them perfect for that!

I tried another recipe from this site and they were soggy and didn't cook all the way through but this recipe was perfect.  I followed the recipe and didn't change a thing.  They were fluffy and crisp and golden brown.

Great recipe.  I usually only make a half of recipe at a time as it makes the perfect amount for 4 waffles in our waffle maker (Cuisnart round maker).  I use whole wheat flour instead and add 2 tablespoons of ground flax seed to make it a little more "healthy".  Also, I increase the skim milk to 1 cup from 3/4 cup due to the added flax seed. To top the recipe off, add 16 Ghiradelli milk chocolate chips per each waffle once you pour the mix in waffle maker ("not healthy", but yummy!). Kids love "Dad's waffles"! It's become a Saturday morning breakfast tradition!

I have made this recipe and 4 teaspoons of baking powder to 2 cups of flour is WAY too much! So much so it caused gastric troubles. I love waffles but won't make this recipe again. Sorry!

My DIL gave me a waffle pan for my last birthday, so I tried it for the first time over the weekend.  I did add some extra milk as the batter looked a bit thick.  They were absolutely fantastic!  The kids were visiting us, and I had some leftover apple & cinnamon, as well as strawberry & rhubarb sauces left from another occasion, and this went wonderfully with the waffles - with cream, or sour cream, or even joghurt!  (Some had it with boring cheese!).  I will definitely be making this again, as my husband loves waffles.  Will just have to watch the weight!! ?

I've made these a few times now and this recipe is definitely perfect classic waffles. I did notice they puff up more when you separate out the yolks as others suggested. I was lazy this time and didn't do it. I'm the only one who would've noticed that the top side didn't puff quite as much. I'm leaving a review to note that these are perfect if you reheat them in the toaster on the low-medium setting. Just let them cool completely then put in a zip lock in the fridge. Taste just as good the next day!

Wow!  My daughter asked for waffles for her 18th birthday this morning.  So happy I found this recipe!  I also increased the sugar to 4 Tbls, but changed nothing else.  The batter looked very watery.  I was afraid I had done something wrong but since there were so many other positive reviews, I decided to just go with it.  I'm glad I did!  Perfect!  They fluffed up beautifully with a light crisp to the outside and perfect fluffy inside.  Great recipe!  Thank you!

Made it exactly the way the recipe said... it came out good... except it was VERY salty. Or had allot of baking soda... either way it had a bad after taste.

These made great, inoffensive waffles. I love how little sugar is in the batter, but it makes for a paler than usual result. I would make this same batter when flavored waffles are on the menu.

Very good! I'm 15, and I'm like the baker of the family, right next to MY awesome mom! These waffles are great with a plod of cool whip and a drizzle of syrup . Nibble, and enjoy. Also, very quick to make.

Have tried this a couple of ways from the original recipe. Today I added a smidge more milk and baking powder. The batter is thinner, but we have crispy waffles even with peanut butter on them.

This has become my go to recipe.  We all love these on Saturday morning.  I make a double batch and freeze the leftover waffles to give to my children through the week. They don't even put any maple syrup or whipped cream on them. Just blueberries and strawberries.  Yummy!

I have made this recipe many times.  We all really like it as written but when we whip the egg whites and fold them in at the end, the results are outstanding! I also add in almond extract, and prefer this recipe with gluten free flour-makes them crispy on the outside.  So with these changes we would give it 5 stars.

I used this recipe for "Waffle Wednesday" at work, and it was a smash hit.  Coworkers said they could smell the waffles cooking from down the hall and they walked in with their mouths watering ready to dig in.  The recipe was easy to make and did taste absolutely delicious.

This was very easy and quick to make. I added 2 teaspoons of brown sugar and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon so I didn't need syrup. Very good -- kind of reminiscent of an ice cream sugar cone, although not quite as sweet.

Perfect, fool proof recipe (especially for someone who has never cooked them before.) I plan to comb the reviews to figure out how to determine the perfect amount to pour (some of mine were too small, one overflowed.) But that was my own error. As far as the recipe goes, great taste, consistency and easy to follow!

Wasn't a fan of this recipe. They were not crispy at all (I have made other waffles on the same setting of the same waffle maker which came out crispy) and they were also too bitter. That baking powder taste really sticks in the back of your throat and made my mouth really dry while eating these.

Don't buy any more pre-made mixes from the store. This one is just as good and is super easy to prep.We used the mix on a flip style cooker and they come out thick and fluffy. Great waffle mix. Tip: If you like whipped cream on yours try mixing it with your favorite kind of yogurt.

The batter was tasteless, devoid of anything sweet, and very floury. I had to add a cup of sugar, additional vanilla and almond extract (the nut helps cover the flour taste some), and oil, that the original recipe was pretty much just lost.

These were quite delicious as is. I would try separating the egg yolks from the whites, mixing  then adding the egg whites at the end as another user had suggested.

Good basic recipe.  Light and fluffy but could of had a bit more flavor.  I will probably add a bit more vanilla and sugar next time.

Excellent!  Delicate, fluffy and yummy!  Thanks for sharing Edit: to AcedemiaNut- your problem must have been exactly what you said about the "baking soda" because there is none in this recipe, only baking POWDER. Think about it

I decreased the baking powder to 3 tsp and the salt by half, and I think I could have gone lower with the baking powder.  Otherwise, pretty good waffles :)

Perfect basic waffle recipe!! I doubled it and made a batch to put in the freezer for the week and the kids loved them. Delicious as is, but you could easily add things to experiment and still end up with great waffles.

This is a good solid recipe that I made exactly as written. The waffles were light and crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The star deducted is for flavor. While the texture was great, the flavor was a little bland. I will use this recipe again, but add additional sugar and vanilla.

I used veggie oil instead of butter, 1/2 of buttermilk and 1 cup of fat-free milk, and I separated the eggs and whipped the whites, folding them in last.  I did not care for the taste of these waffles.  Too much of a baking powder taste and perhaps a little too much salt.  They were light as I used 3 eggs instead of two, and as mentioned, I whipped the whites separately.

This is a great waffle recipe. Sometimes when I am running out of time I use vegetable oil instead of butter. When I have more time I buy the pre-cooked bacon from Costco and just put the piece in the waffle iron with the batter. Also if you want even more fluffy waffles then separate the egg whites and yolks and whip the egg whites until they are stiff peaks

I made this for brunch with my family and it was a success! I took the tip of adding more sugar, 1/8 of margine/butter and 4tbls of vanilla.I aslo whipped the eggs in my mixer before adding other liquid ingredients. I would like to thank the person for telling the readers to place hot waffles on paper towel so they would not get soggy. This is a recipe that was very simple and I will definetly use again.

I used this recipe this morning and my family loved them. I added some cinnamon to the recipe just because that is what my family likes. But they would have been perfect without the cinnamon too. I can not imagine this recipe coming out wrong unless someone didn't fully preheat the waffle iron properly. If your waffles are coming out unevenly cooked, you may want to let your iron heat while you are mixing everything up. I let my heat fro a good 15 minutes closed so the heat can evenly distribute across all sections.

Awesome waffles! I added a couple shakes of cardamom and allspice and also let the batter stand for 20 minutes. This made the waffles wonderfully light, 100x better than using pancake batter in the waffle iron!

My family said these were the best waffles ever. The only changes I made were reducing the salt to 1/2 tsp and I substituted 1 cup of almond flour for 1 cup white.

I made these yesterday, the batter looks real thick not like how it pours out from this video. The first waffle was so hard, so I added half a cup of milk, it turned out good after I added the extra milk.

Delish, with a few changes like separating the yolk and whites and whipping them separately, I also blended an apple and banana with the milk to make it sweeter and used Almond and coconut milk. I also used Oats that I blended to make the flour. Also saw reviews that said it would be bland so I added cinnamon, cloves, and ginger.

This recipe makes way more than 10-12 waffles. I've got about twice that now. I'll be freezing them for quick breakfasts next week. I added more oil and milk to the mix as it was too thick; about 1/3 of a cup more oil and 1/2 cup more milk, reduced the sugar and omitted the vanilla. I prefer my waffles to be the template upon which my toppings are the flavor. To each their own, though. My wafflemaker makes it easy to check the waffles, and if they don't have a nice honey-hue on at least 1/2 of the top, then the cover goes down for another minute or so.

Great recipe.  Works every time. I accidentally left out the eggs last time and they were still crisp and tasty.  Perhaps an option for vegetarians? I'll try with veg oil and soya milk next and see if it becomes a vegan treat, or just a mess!

The recipe turned out great!! They were light and fluffy and just sweet enough but not overly sweet. I did alter it a little - I added 5 tablespoons of sugar and 3 teaspoons of vanilla. My husband loves waffles and these are his new favorite!!

Good waffle recipe but tasted a little salty to me, so next time I would cut the salt to 3/4 tsp.  Batter was thick and dense and didn't spread as much as I'm used to w/other waffle recipes.  (The good thing about that was that it didn't drip all over the waffle maker).

I've made this recipe several times with no changes whatsoever. It's perfect just as is. By far the best (and easiest) waffle recipe. It's nice to see a recipe that isn't unnecessarily complicated for a change.

A classic waffle with a splash of creativity through the vanilla extract.

I thought they were just perfect the way they were. 

The recipe clearly calls for Baking POWDER.

I used Almond Milk instead of regular because I had it on hand, turned out really delicious! I also only had Stevia, which tasted great too. I liked the butter taste, in comparison to vegetable oil recipes, much better.

Love it I make it the night before because I have impatient toddlers and 3 kids total! I just refrigerate it and in the morning all I need to wait on is the waffle maker! We always more than double the sugar and I add chocolate chips. If you add the chocolate chips you need to wait because the warm milk & melted butter is enough to melt all the chips turning it jnto chocolate waffles which are great too but if you wanting chocolate chip waffles you gotta have the batter cool to room temp. I also have added frozen berries from Costco which the warmer the batter the better and those come out AMAZING if you love Bertie waffles! I have added peanut butter and bananas!!! So many great combinations!!!

This is a good basic recipe for waffles. I always like to add things to our waffles. For this recipe I added duck eggs, bananas and chocolate chips. The key is to mix the batter very thoroughly and then add slices of banana and chocolate chips.  It never hurts to add a little extra vanilla or almond.

I made these waffles for breakfast of 4. I followed the recipe exactly but at the end I added chocolate chips. When I tried them they were absolutely delicious! They had a good balance of batter with chocolate chips and they were both crunchy and fluffy. I loved them very much and they have to be one of my favorite waffle recipes. I will definitely use this recipe again! I recommend this recipe for anyone with a waffle iron and some time. Enjoy!

We make these every Saturday. Only, we add 4T of Splenda instead of 2T of white sugar. Makes them a little sweeter. They are wonderful!!

Well this was an excellent surprise. Simple ingredients, but fantastic flavour. Even little miss picky couldn't get enough of them, and I followed the recipe to a T. These have a nice texture, not too dense, probably only second to traditional yeast raised Belgium waffles.

I have always loved Belgium Waffles, so when my hubby gave me a waffle iron for Christmas I looked forward to enjoy them more often. This recipe was wonderful a real a crowd pleaser Christmas morning. I too made some modifications but the wonderful part of this recipe for me was the simplicity, you didn't need to whip egg whites and fold them in. I'm looking forward to the extras that the recipe made, quick breakfast with aid of the toaster. Marilyn from Ontario

These waffles are delicious.  I made three changes.  I left out the butter and used Greek yogurt instead. (The spray I use on the waffle iron is more than enough oil so that the waffles come off clean.)  I also separated the eggs and beat the egg whites until stiff, then folded them into the waffle mixture as my last step before cooking.  Also, I substituted 1/2 cup of white flour for whole wheat, which didn't make a difference in the flavor, but made it a little healthier.  I also would recommend adding a little extra sugar or Splenda.

This was great and a hit with the entire family.  We added 4 tablespoons of sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract and 2 teaspoons of cinnamon.  It has the perfect sweetness.

This recipe worked flawlessly in my waffle iron, which I had previously stopped using because other recipes tended to fail miserably in it. The recipes and instructions which came with the waffle maker were kind of useless as they said to use pancake mix; this kept giving me weird, tasteless waffles or batter that overflowed out of the iron. This recipe was perfect! Waffles don't have to be messy! And, I don't think these took me much longer than regular pancakes would have. Maybe about 20 minutes more total since it used a couple more bowls and so cleanup was a bit of a bigger job, but not by much and these are definitely worth it! This batch even made enough so I have some to freeze for later! :D The only change I made to this recipe was adding maybe two or three tablespoons of hot coffee to top off my milk mixture when I ran out of milk. I'm tempted to keep making them this way as the coffee taste is really subtle but adds to the flavour. I may try adding some cocoa powder to a batch of these one day for chocolate waffles! Thanks for the great recipe. :)

Wonderful waffles!! What kept it from getting a perfect 5 set of stars was presentation; mine never could come out as golden brown as the picture. Flavor-wise, it was magnificent! One waffle was enough to fill me up for breakfast, so I had quite a bit leftover that I wasn't expecting. To the lady who asked what went wrong: Baking POWDER is in the recipe, NOT baking SODA! Make sure you're following the recipe correctly before rating it so poorly next time!

Made this recipe today. My family loved these waffles.  I did make the following modifications. I used 3 tsp baking powder. I separated the eggs. Mixed the whites then gently fold in the yolks.  I used 3/4 cup warm buttermilk and 3/4 cup of regular warm milk.  4 tbl of sugar and finally some ground cinnamon. Very fluffy yet crispie waffles. Definately a recipe i will make again.

Followed the recipe exactly (didn't separate the eggs as suggested by other reviewers) - waffles turned out great! Just a note: the servings are not for a whole waffle, but rather a quarter.  You will get about 2.5 whole waffles out of this (or 10 quarters!).

Made these for breakfast when my in-laws were over and they were a smash. I mixed the batter in my Ninja batter mixer is the only thing I did different. Made a double batch and they disappeared like magic.

Batter was way too thick, I didn't see the other reviewers mention this, so I went with it and the first two were much too dense.  I added more milk to thin it to normal waffle consistency 1/4- 1/2 cup and the waffles were very good.

I agree with Wyoming Carol, by separating and whipping up the egg whites the waffles will be light and full body and increases the amount of your mixture.

Excellent,  simple recipe.  I added a tablespoon of brown sugar and a dash of pumpkin pie spice.  It was perfect.

I just made these and they turned out great! I have a circus waffle maker and it made 12 of the circus animals (elephant, lion, and horse) for my little grandson and 8 Belgian for my husband and I. I packaged them in single servings and tossed in the freezer and now all we have to do is pop them in the toaster! It took so little time and is pennies compared to the Eggo ones and taste so much better. Thank you for this easy and tasty recipe:)

This is my 1st time making home-made waffles, and it turned out great with what I made them for. I think this recipe is great for both savoury and sweat uses. I would definitely use this recipe again.

I make this recipe for my office every Friday and it is a HUGE success every week. One week I made them with Bisquick instead and I thought there was going to be a riot. These are the BEST!

So I make these about once or twice a week and my boyfriend and I just love them! They're quick and easy to make. They come out soft and fluffy and the batter isn't messy. The burnt crunchy ones even taste great. Even the leftovers are super soft and still great tasting after being reheated in the microwave. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who is short on time or just want great tasting waffles!

Very good without any changes. However I just had to sub out half of the AP flour for WW. It's great. Love them and easy to halve for 2 full size Belgian waffles.

We usually use the boxed mix and really like it, BUT now that we have tried this recipe there is no going back.  WE LOVE IT!!!!! My husband made it and we questioned the consistency of the batter but we stuck to the recipe....FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! No adjustments needed.

I have always made my own waffles. The amount of baking powder seemed to much, but I was in a hurry and didn't bother to compare recipes.  You can taste the baking powder strongly.  Thankfully I always decrease salt, so that wasn't a problem, I needed to increase the sugar, vanilla, and flour to get a passable waffle.  I will not make these again.

This is my favorite waffle recipe so far.  I stopped looking for others finally after many different tries.  The difference is the fact that it's made with butter rather than oil.  
Though I add some cinnamon into my mix and a little more vanilla and it's amazing.  Making some right now in fact.  It's become a weekly or bi-weekly thing!
I've also tried with both salted butter and unsalted and it's best with salted and I really barely salt to it in that case.

Yummy. I am trying to get away from boxed,canned and "just add your own chicken" cooking. 
This was my first attempt of waffles without Bisquick. I use whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose so there is always a little wheaty flavor but 3 kiddos, a husband and I say YUM. 
Also super easy to make which is always awesome.
Thanks

Great recipe as is.  I made a variation on this that I liked quite a bit.  Instead of using plaing milk, I used buttermilk.  Delicious.  But it only made 7-8 waffles.  Next time, I'll use buttermilk and double the recipe.  I didn't add any more butter or sugar.  The waffles are perfect without extra sugar.  Sometimes serve it with maple syrup, powdered sugar, sauteed fruit (in butter and brown sugar - e.g. apples, bananas, peaches, blueberries), or like today with leftover chicken fried steak.

I tried out this recipe and followed it exactly. For some reason, the batter was extremely thick and very hard to work with. The taste was good though, so could anyone tell we how to make them thinner? Also grease your waffle pan. That step is crucial and not mentioned here.

My daughter and I really enjoyed these this morning!! We used a little extra white sugar and added 2 heaped tbl. of brown sugar as well. We also added some cinnamon and 2 pinches of nutmeg to the dry mix. I didn't beat the eggs first, just combined all the wet ingredients and mixed well. We also added an extra tsp. of vanilla and heaped a couple of the tsp. of baking powder. These were great!!

First time making waffles and it came out soo good! It was my first time using a waffle iron so I used the recommended factory setting (at 4 I think) and would increase next time. I followed some recommendations for sifting flour, sugar & baking powder so I did that too. No extra butter topping needed, just fresh fruit & pure maple syrup does the waffles right.

Terrible. Way too thick and made the waffles come out too fluffy, not crispy at all. Strong egg flavor. I left them in for a long time in the waffle maker and nothing helped.

I thought it was delicious the texture was superb and the recipe was quick and easy! However I thought that the sweetness let it down it needed sugar and a small amount of vanilla. Here's what I did: the recipe but added in -Sugar

eh, really boring waffles. I used this recipe because I couldn't find my old stand by & i don't make them often enough to have it memorized. Dense & not flavorful. I even whipped the whites and folded them in, added vanilla extract and still not good :( after the first few waffles I added more vanilla, more milk & and more melted butter- about 1 tblsp each, and still -meh-.  Super disappointed.

Tried this recipe this morning, and the result was a tough, flavorless waffle that really relied on the maple syrup to make it taste...all right. They were just really dense and not at all airy.

A great, basic waffle.  I've taken a stab at waffles now and then with little or no great success. This recipe always wins (with a few exceptions) and is a fast alternative to, say, Swedish pancakes.

A classic waffle is the perfect description for this recipe.  Simple and effortless to make with a flavor that is so much better than anything you will find in a box.

I made these two weeks in a row and they turned out great both times.  I did make this mornings with buttermilk instead of regular milk and they were very tasty.  My nephew said they were the best waffles he ever had.  I read some of the low reviews and I just have to say baking soda and baking powder are not interchangeable.  The recipe calls for baking powder and if you use baking soda instead you are not going to have good tasting waffles.

Dreadful, overly salted. I knew a full teaspoon of salt was far too much. Should have followed my instincts. What a let down.

I tried this recipe for the first time, and found that adding 2 more teaspoons of sugar made a big difference! A very good recipe if you are a novice cook are if you have little ones helping out! Great with fresh fruit and ice cold OJ to drink. Really liked it!!  Thank you!!!

Tasty. I did make two minor changes. Used only 1/4 cup melted butter and added 2 tsp lemon juice to the milk and let it sit for a while. Also let the batter sit for about 10 minutes prior to cooking.

I was disappointed with the result... I love making waffles and have a trusty recipe that I always use and consistently get perfect waffles from. However, this recipe was, well to put it simply, awful. The waffles were crispy throughout and not appetizing. I would not recommend this recipe.

My family LOVES this recipe. The only thing I do differently is sub 1 cup of reg flour for whole wheat flour and I add some cinnamon to the mix. Our waffle maker makes 3 large waffles (4 waffles in each larger waffle). We freeze all the leftovers in individual bags, which make for quick and easy meals during the week.

I've had much more success with other recipes.  I think the fat content is too low, so it makes for a dry waffle.  Also probably a little low on the vanilla.  The biggest sign that this is a bad recipe is my boyfriend who begs for waffles said he could eat them.

I cut out the milk and substituted for a cup of water, 3 eggs, and 3 tsp vanilla...turned out great!!! I did have to use the mixer to really blend the ingredients, but happy to find a good recipe where I don't have to beat the egg whites separately.

Like another reviewer, I followed the recipe exactly as written & my waffles never got even remotely crispy. They also weren't light & airy. It's an ok recipe but I prefer the recipe for "Mammaw's Waffles".

This is actually my first time ever to make waffles!!!
I just bought a waffle iron , and i got very very excited to try it , i looked for an easy recipe that requires the minimum of ingredients because i do not have many things neither a good quantity.
For example i did not have milk so i put half milk, half cream , and this recipe turned out great , absolutely great, you can get soft waffles, medium soft medium crispy , and crispy waffles , depends how long on! I loved it , really good , and everyone told that am genius , cuz this is my first time ever and they turned out really good , professional looking and yummy!! thanks alot , really enjoyed them :)

This was a great start for a waffle recipe. Today was the first time making it and it was simple to do. I made two batches, the first batch was more fluffy than the second, not sure what I did different second time around.  I did use for both batches 5 tablespoons of sugar, i stick of melted butter and 2 teaspoons of vanilla flavoring.  I added mini chocolate chips to the batter. Super yummy and super easy, they could be more fluffy.

I wanted to make waffles for breakfast but was out of mix.  I just pulled this up and made these.  WOW!  Delicious!  Super good and super easy!  And I felt better about making waffles with ingredients I have in my kitchen as opposed to a mix.  Didn't know it would be this simple!  Great!  Thanks for the recipe!  This one is a keeper!

I used wheat flour instead of white, Sugar in the raw instead of white sugar and added 1 cup of chocolate chips. Served them with cottage cheese and fresh blueberries on top. My kids love it! It was a perfect breakfast.

These waffles were fluffy and I couldn't get them crispy - even on the highest level of heat on my waffle iron.  I looked at a few other recipes to see if I could figure out what went wrong.  It looks like other recipes include vegetable oil and I suspect that's what helps make them crispy.  I wanted a crispy waffle - not a textured pancake. :(

I'll have to try another version of this next time.

Taste was really good.  There are a couple mistakes I think with the ingredients.  1 teaspoon of salt is way too much salt.  So, I only added 1/4 tsp of salt.  Also, I think there is too much milk added to it.  I added what was called for and they weren't as crispy as other recipes I have tried for waffles.  I think next time I will add 1 1/4 cup of milk and I might scale back on the butter too a little.  The batter was kinda soupy, and I know for a fact that waffle batter is thicker so I did add a couple tablespoons of flour to the batter.  Made it lots better.  Its a really good recipe but changing a couple things I will do next time.  I might even use vegetable oil instead of butter next time.  1/3 cup probably.

A nice Sunday treat! The waffles were a perfect texture (not sure if it was because of the recipe or the waffle maker). This is truly a classic waffle.  Add some fruit, a pat of butter, a sprinkle of powdered sugar, and a drizzle of maple syrup. You will have smiles all around the table!

5 star recipe! Ironically the same day I brought my new waffle iron home, I saw this recipe on Pinterest. I made the recipe exactly as written and they came out perfect. I topped them with pureed strawberry sauce and coconut whipped cream.

These were delicious!  I followed some tips and did a little more milk, half the salt, less baking powder and slightly more sugar.  I think next time I might half the baking powder to see if that works as well. Made these for the first time Easter morning and all 6 eaters gave thumbs up!

Turned out light & fluffy! I did sift the dry and separate the eggs. Very easy and better than the harder recipes that beat egg whites until stiff and fold in.

These waffles turned out great! The recipe made 7  waffles in my square Food Network Belgian waffle maker,  and they were perfectly light and fluffy! I did double the sugar as some other reviewers suggested and made sure to beat the eggs well before adding the other wet ingredients. Didn't find it necessary to separate out the whites.

Thanks for the great recipe!

I was very surprised! I've been trying to find a crispy waffle recipe with no luck. I used vegtable oil instead of butter. This recipe is perfect, crispy waffles. It wakes only 3 waffles in my round waffle iron.

I mixed the dry ingredients together ahead of time (& added cinnamon) so I could wake up early and just add the other ingredients. Other than that, I've followed the recipe exactly. They turned out flat (not fluffy AT ALL) and bland. If they weren't still hot, it would've been like eating a brick. I think oil is best used in waffles instead of butter, but thought I'd give this recipe a try seeing as it has so many positive reviews. If anyone has enjoyed this recipe I'm certain it has been through their own minor tweaking.

This was my first time ever to make waffles, and they were delicious! This recipe cooks up light and tasty. I added some chocolate chips for my son, Mr. Pickypants, and his friend, and they practically inhaled them. Thanks for a great addition to my breakfast repertoire!

I used twice as much sugar, and 2 TBL of vanilla. Waffles still tasted like baking powder. I guess I have to kick it up a notch or try a different recipe.

My daughter made these for St. Patrick's Day and added green food coloring.  The recipe came together easily and flowed nicely in our waffle maker.  She doubled the recipe and got 16, thick and fluffy waffles. We used egg whites and divided the flour up into whole wheat, oatmeal, almond and all purpose. We also used sodium free baking powder and skipped the salt. Served with some home made pancake syrup my daughter also made.  Delicious!

Perfect basic recipe for waffles! My husband loves them. However, I would have liked a little more flavor. Perhaps I'll try more extract or cinnamon next time.
*They freeze well too, just pop them in the toaster like the frozen store bought waffles.

my hubby and son really liked these.  We really like the texture of these waffles nice and crispy on the outside, firm enough they don't fall apart when being removed from waffle iron, but soft and tasty.

Great flavorful recipe. I added 1/4 c rolled oats, 2 tbs ground flax seed, and 1 tbs chia seed to boost the nutrition. I also use blend of whole wheat and white flour.  Our kids beg for these waffles and LOVE it when I make them.

I've made these waffles twice, both times they were fantastic.  The second time I used powdered milk, that worked just fine.  Both times I doubled the recipe, except for the salt and eggs, the salt I used 1 tsp and the eggs I used 3 and added 1/4 cup of water to compensate for liquid of egg I didn't have. I used a whisk on the wet ingredients. The waffles were light and yummy!

These waffles were delicious.   The whole family loved them.  I followed the recipe except for separating the eggs and  mixing fluffy egg whites just before cooking.  We had seven good-size waffles.  I'll definitely make these again,  but will double the recipe and freeze leftovers. Thanks for sharing.

Recipe is great!  Only comment I have is that at least on my waffle iron (Black and Decker WM 1404), it only makes about half the waffles the author estimates the recipe to make.  I made the original proportions, estimated at 10-12 waffles, but it only made 5.  Not a big deal, but good to be aware of.

Don't bother with this recipe. It received raving reviews in the past until 2008 or so. I made this for my wife and I and it turned out terrible. I followed the recipe wondering why so much baking powder and I was right, didn't turn out that great.

I've made these waffles quite a few times now and they always turn out perfectly. They're nice and filling and not too sweet. We like them with a teaspoon of mixed spice added to the batter. The whole family agree they're much better than shop-bought.

My waffle iron wasn't working so I made this recipe as pancakes.  Loved them!  Nice flavor and fluffy texture.  Tasted a hint of the melted butter.  Folded in egg whites separately as suggested by reviewer.  May decide to thin the batter with a little more milk next time if I make as pancakes again.

Looks to me like you people using the blender and the whole 1/2 C of butter are purdy smart. I'm in China; don't have a blender or a waffle iron but it made some purdy good pancakes. I dig reading the reviews. Thanx

Came out great-I also recommend separating the eggs and folding in the beaten whites. We also prefer using buttermilk.

The flavor was decent, but they were too thick. I'm glad I tripled the recipe (my original intention was to have extras to freeze) but I barely wound up making over the original recipe serving size of 10-12 waffles. I got to 16 waffles that my children could not cut (and I barely could) and decided to stop being lazy and break out my tried and true BHG cook book and check the waffle recipe I USUALLY use. Come to find out this recipe doesn't have enough milk! For waffles that you can cut, have the same amount of milk as you have flour. I added some milk to the last bit of my batter and was able to finish out the bowl with some very delicious waffles. I would give this 4 or 5 stars if there was the proper ratio of milk to flour.

My daughter threw a fit this morning as she wanted cereal. I told her she was eating breakfast with the rest of the family. I made these waffles and also assembled a quick wild blueberry syrup. My daughter ate 2 waffles and exclaimed how good they were. We enjoyed these mild, traditional, and pleasantly crispy waffles. Thank you!

I thought it was odd that the recipe calls for 4 teaspoons of baking powder ... that's a LOT!  They had a funny taste to them and they would not crisp up, no matter how long I left them in the iron. They weren't fluffy either. Flat and a bit soggy with an odd, salty taste. I have read some other recipes that call for like 1 teaspoon of baking powder per 2 cups of flour. I will definitely try those recipes next time.

I took the other suggestions and upped the sugar to 5 tbs and increased the butter to 1/4 cup.  Excellent waffle that was just the right sweetness.

Great, basic waffle recipe! I made just a few changes that I thought elevated these a bit. First, I use good quality baking margarine, but it has salt in it, so I eliminated the extra salt. I added two tablespoons more sugar to the batter and doubled the vanilla extract. I also added some cinnamon to the batter - yum! And lastly, give the baking powder some time to do its magic - after mixing all the ingredients, let your batter rest before making your waffles. Oops almost forgot -- if you aren't going to eat these right out of the waffle maker, don't stack them on a plate (even in the oven), or they WILL get soggy. Lay them directly on the rack of your warm oven to keep them warm and crisp until you serve them.

Pretty good. Subbed oil instead of butter. E likes waffles less crispy. Will try butter next time, but 1/4c.

TRY THIS ONE OUT!!! So took a bunch of people's advice: separated the eggs and whipped up the whites really well....sifted the flour, baking powder (used 2 1/2 teas), sugar (used 4 T), salt (used 1/2 teas), and cinnamon (used 1 T) all together....for the milk I made 1 cup of buttermilk (1 T of lemon juice and then fill it up to the 1 cup mark with milk and let sit for about 10ish mins) and then added 1/2 cup regular milk and warmed on stove...put all liquids together and then added to dry, whipped them all up then added the whites and cooked in preheated waffle maker and OMG soooo good!!! we loved them!! we only got 3 waffles from this...we also use whole wheat flour though so it makes the batter a bit denser...some people suggested adding more milk to thin it out a bit which I will do next time...

I like the recipe, but it has to much fat.
It's very strong in your stomach, and I only used 1/4 cup of butter, and I had to add more milk.

This is my go to from now on. The only thing I did different was added 1/2 tablespoon of sugar along with 2 tablespoons. I also did as other suggested and separated the eggs and beat the egg whites to almost peak texture and left them to the side. I also tempered my eggs as wanted to make sure it milk and eggs did not get to hot, then did everything else as directed and folded the whites in at the very end. They come out light and airy. My fiance and grandson said they were greeaaaatttt. lol

Thank you so much for helping  me get over my fear of making waffles! My memory of waffles is my mom throwing her waffle iron away saying it didn't work because the waffles stuck. Since then it has been Eggos for us. My son thought I should be able to make them so I bought a waffle iron and we chose your recipe. It worked wonderfully. I followed the recipe exactly as directed. The waffles were soft, fluffy and had a good flavor. I am so excited!

Super easy to make and the waffles turn out nicely!  My 2 year old son loved them.  We topped the waffles with strawberries and applesauce for a nice fruity taste!

I ran out of waffle mix from the store so I went looking on line for a recipe. The only bad thing is, now the instant mixes will never be good enough. :)

I followed the recipe as a guideline and used self rising flour and more sugar they turned out beautifully the first was a little dense so I used more milk. Delicious I will definitely use again.

I change the recipe to 1 tbsp of vanilla - tastes much better than bisquick - plus I save $$ - make these all the time, the kids love it when I add choc chips to them = yummy!

Was skeptical if they would taste good after seeing how little sugar to baking powder there is, but they were great! I like to add a little flavored creamer into the batter while on the waffle maker. It adds an extra punch of flavor.

I enjoyed the texture though they were a bit bland. I had even added an additional TBSP of brown sugar. This is a great basic recipe that has plenty of room for improvement. Next time I will double the sugar, vanilla, add the cinnamon that a lot of reviewers have suggested and add about a half a cup of chocolate chips. This made 4 large waffles

This is my first time making waffles. I tried this recipe 10/7/12, following the recipe for 5 servings, but separated the eggs as mentioned by others. I guess it helped? I think a few more tablespoons of sugar and bit more vanilla will improve the taste. They weren't bad, just needed something extra. I intend to make a slightly bigger batch for next time since i was only able to make 3-4 waffles with my waffle iron as it requires a lot of batter to get an evenly cooked waffle. I only gave 4 stars instead of 5, as I believe the receipe is good, but I need more practice to adjust to my taste.

These were to bland and to heavy.  If you have to change the recipe to get better results then it should not be given 5 stars.

I liked these because they were quick and easy to make. And, I typically have all the ingredients on-hand, unlike the buttermilk which some recipes call for. Fluffy and light on the inside. I prefer a slightly sweeter batter, maybe a little more vanilla and some cinnamon. However, DH liked them as-is. These will be a repeat in our home.

This recipe is perfect. My family loves it! I always beat the eggs until they are light and fluffy before I add the other ingredients. I also use soured raw milk which is just like buttermilk. Yum!

The only change I made to this recipe was, I doubled the amount of sugar and added two tablespoons of milled flax seed. My girls love it! I've made these every morning before school for the past week and they eat them without syrup! They woke me up Saturday morning 6am asking me to make these. This is a staple in our house now. Thank you!

Solid recipe- crispy on the outside, airy and fluffy on the inside.  Perfect texture and lightness.  Used 1/2 whole wheat flour - I also used 1/4 cup butter and filled up to the 1/3 mark with oil.  Will try next time with a tbsp of butter and apple sauce. . Don't forget to spray your waffle iron,

I whipped my egg whites separately, but other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  I've made this recipe a few times now and have even added chocolate chips and blueberries to the batter.  The waffles come out great each time and my family gobbles them up.  I've frozen leftovers and they reheat perfectly.

These were so good. I doubled the butter and used self rising flour as a substitute for the bp and salt. Overall, they were very good, soft on the inside, crunchy on the outside, wonderful flavor.

This recipe was better than some of the others I have tried.  I needed to get rid of my extra eggnog after our Christmas celebration, so used half eggnog and half milk.  It made for delicious tasting waffles.  The batter was a little thicker due to the eggnog, did have to add a bit more milk to thin it out.

These were very easy.This is the second time I've made them.  Timing wise I accidentally let the batter sit for about 20 minutes before using and it thickened a bit and made flufflier waffles. My family gobbled them up! I also used Splenda instead of sugar and it made the waffles a bit sweeter (which we liked).

Using this recipe exactly, I wasn't able to get nice crispy waffles.  They taste okay, but they were kind of heavy and had no crisp to them.

I was serving my waffles with turkey and gravy and didn't want them sweet, so I cut the sugar in half and omitted the vanilla. For added fiber and nutrition, I used 1C less 1T white whole wheat flour, 1C less 1T white flour, and 2T soy flour. I separated the eggs and beat the whites and folded them in at the end as others suggested. They were very light and delicious, with much the same texture as the Bisquick waffles I loved as a kid. My picky kids preferred the boxed variety, but that might have had to do with cutting the sugar and omitting the vanilla.

Nice, light and flaky waffles.  Maybe a little light on flavor, so may add a couple things to the next batch (nutmeg or a bit more vanilla), but this is definitely a quality recipe and my 4 year old loved them.

These were delicious waffles!! I had med. size eggs so I used 3. I separated the egg whites from the yolks, beat the egg whites a little and folded them in the batter.  I will definately use this recipe again!

Just Perfect!
If you love it crispier, substitude some of the flour with 3/4 cornstarch and some of the butter with again 4/5 vegetable oil.

These were great for my hubby and I. I down sized the servings to two and added one egg instead of 3/4. They were great!! Made three waffles.

Wanted to make homemade waffles for my family this morning, as I have not made any in years. This recipe was quick, simple and very delicious. I plan to make again and freeze the waffle for later use. These remind of the waffles made at the famous waffle chain. You will not be disappointed.

Easy & my boys gobbled these up! I doubled it & freeze them for a nice hot breakfast before school, just pop in the toaster! I subbed half the flour for whole wheat to add a little more nutrition. Oh & I added an extra tsp vanilla just because. Thanks!

I love waffles and eat the frozen ones regularly. I made this recipe this morning, and it's much better than my favorite frozen waffles. My family enjoyed them too. It was also very simple to put together. I will definitely be making them again.

I do them gluten free (exchanging normal flour and baking powder for gluten free) and with a bit more sugar and it still works amazing with this recipe!

Excellent waffles!!! I read all of the variations and came up with this. I whipped up the eggs in the blender first and then I added the remaining wet ingredients to the same blender. Make sure your blender can hold all of the liquid, I had to do it in 2 random batches. I transferred the wet mixtures to a large bowl and while stirring I added the sifted dry ingredients and stirred well. My ingredient adjustments were: 5 tablespoons of raw sugar, 2 tablespoons of vanilla, and 1 cup of melted real butter. I think whipping the eggs first made for a fluffy waffle. The batter even seemed fluffy. We served them with fresh blueberries, real maple syrup and/or honey. Enjoy!

Very good I have been looking for a sweet waffle recipe and found it.  Everyone loved them, very moist, and fluffy.  I did use the other reviewers advice and put 5 tablespoons of sugar, 3 teaspoons of vanilla, and sifted the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

The BEST waffles I've ever had!  So nice and crisp.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and made sure I did not stack the waffles after removing them from the waffle maker.  

I will be using this recipe for now on to make waffles.  So tasty!

I've made this twice and both times had to increase the milk to thin out the batter.  I also tried beating the egg whites seperately and found this made a lighter waffle.

Wow! These waffles were incredible. The only thing I did different was seperate the egg yolk and white and beat the whites until soft peaks formed. I combined everything else as directed then folded in the egg whites. This instantly became a family favorite.

These were actually very good - I surprised myself. I don't easily give out 5 stars, so I'll explain why: firstly, the ingredients in this recipe are those that are usually in every kitchen. No rushing out to buy buttermilk. Easily adaptable by adding chocolate chips (REALLY good with these), nuts, etc. The only thing I tweaked was I added 5 tablespoons of sugar instead of 2. They crisped up nicely - some of the other recipes on this site did not. They cooked at a decent pace, too. Just a good, basic waffle that made for a great breakfast. Will definitely make these again.

I usually like to make hearty waffles with wheat germ and extra ingerdients. But these are are a delicious substitute when you don't have all those other ingedients! I just added a little bit of cinnamin and nutmeg to the recipe and poured syrup on top!

I made these and they were terrible.  I usually use the Waffles I recipe which is pretty good but not as crispy as I'd like so I thought I'd give this a try.  Bland, soggy and tastes like baking powder (and yes I did mix well before pouring in the liquid ingredients).  YUCK.

My second attempt at waffles. This recipe was very good, much better than the first I made. I added 5TBSP of sugar and more vanilla (I add extra vanilla to everything). The whole family was very happy with this waffle.

FABULOUS! Made them for my husband and 18-month-old this morning, and they were devoured. Served with wild blueberry syrup and they were just the right amount of sweetness - however I too decreased the salt by half. Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Very good waffle recipe, the only thing I did different than the recipe was beat my egg whites stiff and folded them in the batter in the end.  It also made the perfect amount for my family of 5.  Will definitely make again.

Really enjoy making these waffles for my family. For an added treat I sometimes add candied sprinkles to the batter.  My Children love it and they call it multi-colored waffles.

Very good classic waffles! I used another reviewer's idea and made this in the blender. It was much easier and saved me quite a few dishes. I also made a blueberry topping for it. It was delicious! If you want to make the topping, just boil blueberries with a little bit of water and sugar. Yum!

Thought this was great, kids really loved it.  Only changes to it i made were: 3 teaspoons baking powder, 3 tablespoons sugar, and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Using a black and decker waffle iron they came out crisp and delicious.

Very delicious! I followed the recipe exactly as is, except that I separated the egg whites and yolks. I folded in the egg whites last, as suggested by another reviewer. We will be making this recipe again!

Delicious! As other reviewers suggested, I added some cinnamon to the dry ingredients, and I separated the eggs and folded in the beaten egg whites last.  My kids and I ate them all up, really great recipe!

4.5 starts to be exact.  Just a little more trouble than I like to have on a Sunday morning, but they were tasty and I will definitely make again.

Too Salty!! Pinch of salt will do.  Had to start over.  Also nice to beat egg whites and fold in.  Makes for a much crisper waffle.

This was the first recipe I tried with my new waffle maker I got for Christmas this year.  They were absolutely delicious just as is and my family LOVED them.  The next time I made waffles I couldn't find this recipe so tried another I found here on this site, but they didn't measure up at all.  Thankfully, I found the recipe, put it in my cookbook, and saved this to my recipe box so I will never lose it again.  The waffles are light and fluffy and very flavorful.  I highly recommend trying them!

One saturday morning my wife and I ran out of our waffle mix, so we made these. FANTASTIC! We doubled the sugar and vanilla as many commenters suggested, and I think it's worth it. Also, we didn't separate the eggs, but we did put both eggs in our kitchenaid and whipped them up real nice. Fluffy, Crispy outside. Delicious.

I made this without any alterations and we loved it.  It was exactly what I was looking for - a simple recipe that used less eggs and didn't require beating egg whites and still tasted delicious.

This is a great waffle recipe, definitely a classic. My only issue is how much batter should go in the waffle maker and for how long? I am new to the waffle-making world and have tried making these numerous times with lots of issues so more instructions would have been helpful. They are delicious though!

Great waffle recipe, but a little on the bland side.  I added an additional tablespoon of sugar and an extra 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract.  Definitely keeping this recipe!

This recipe is easy and quick to make. My husband loves these waffles. I make them very often. The only thing I added was a few pinches of cinnamon into the flour mix. It didn't say, but I use 1% milk with it as well. Very, very yummy!

for me, this was the perfect waffle.  the added baking powder gives enough rise that you don't need to sift the dry ingredients or beat the whites like in more traditional recipes.

Easy.  Turned out great.  Doubled the recipe, made them all, and froze the ones we didn't eat.  Pop them in the toaster in the morning, slather on some peanut butter and out the door.

The title reallys says it all. These waffles were light, crisp and buttery. Nothing spectacularly good OR bad. I think they taste a little like eggo waffles, minus the preservatives.

I went by the overall rating on this, assuming it to be a good recipe.  That was an unfortunate mistake.  I should have read the individual reviews, especailly the lower ratings.  They were all accurate.  This was bland tasting, heavy, dense and a failure.  Unfortunate.  I will find another recipe to follow and not even bother trying to alter this one to attain better quality.

We love these waffles when we separate the eggs and whip the whites before adding. They turn out amazing in our belgian waffle maker when the whites are folded in just before cooking.

I made these waffles this morning for my husband and kids and they loved them!!  I followed the recipe for the most part.  I added 2 more TBSP of sugar.  I separated the egg whites and beat them until they formed stiff peaks.  I folded them into the batter last.  The waffles did not come out heavy at all! They were a hit!

These are great waffles and very easy to make. I am a 41 year old man, somewhat of a cook, but by far not a chef. Me and my two sons who are 4 and 8 made these this morning and they were great. I would recomend this recipe. Thanks Megan.

I received a waffle maker for christmas, so, of course, I was looking for a good recipe for waffles. All recipes never disappoints..I found this one this morning and decided to try it. Perfection! The only thing I did differently was add a sprinkle of cinnamon, and added 2 more TBL of sugar. Everyone loved them and we all agree they were better than any mix from the store.

5 stars!!  Very simple, yet very delicious.  My daughters love waffles and we have this recipe almost every morning.  I have changed it up a bit for variety (adding bananas/chocolate chips, or using whole wheat flour).. but the main recipe is always one I fall back on.  Thanks!

I halved the recipe and got 4 square waffles.  I separated the eggs and beat the egg white stiff and folded it in last as recommended by others.  These waffles were good, but nothing special.  This is the first recipe I've tried and I will keep it, but I will try some other recipes before I try this one again.

Great tasting waffle, but the batter, for me, came out a bit too thick. Added a little more milk to help thin it out.

I like to compare recipes. I compared this recipe to the Betty Crocker waffle mix. I enjoyed this one very much. They were nice and fluffy. Going to make a batch and freeze for kids breakfast.

Great recipe! I mixed up the wet ingredients in the blender, whipping up the eggs first. I also substituted 1/2 c wheat flour for some of the all-purpose flour. I also used 1/4 c sugar.

My children eat waffles just about every morning and we were out and so was the grocery store. I went looking for a recipe for homemade waffles and found this one. These waffles were awesome and very easy to make! The only changes I made were to add more sugar and vanilla. I will never buy frozen waffles again.

Name says it all: classic waffle. No extras here - but a great way to play up the flavors of a sauce or syrup or other topping. This worked well to do half whole-wheat flour. Also, opted for oil instead of butter. Nice go-to recipe for basic waffles.

Fabulous basic recipe.  My family thoroughly enjoyed it.  I like that it uses butter.  Those recipes that require oil leave a nasty taste.  I must say it tasted a bit bland when I followed the recipe, so the second time I made a few changes.  I couldn't stand the idea of my family having so much butter, so I cut the butter down to 2 TBSP, added 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, added an additional tbsp of white sugar and 1 tbsp of brown sugar (next time I'm going to try all brown sugar), and increased the warm milk to 1 3/4 cup to make up for the liquid lost in not using so much butter.  They came out delicious!  We enjoyed them plain without any syrup or anything.  My son is on his fourth or fifth waffle and he's only seven.

These waffles were AMAZING!!! I have been searching for a waffle recipe that doesn't come out so dense and rubbery.. these were light and crispy and really really great. We won't be changing recipes any time soon! I can't wait to start adding fruits and things to these waffles. I got about 7 waffles out of mine following the directions exactly... though I do make mine in a blender and i sift the dry together.

Great tasting waffles - I added blueberries and halfed the recipe as it was just for me and my husband - with my waffle maker, 1/2 only made 3 waffles instead of the 5-6 I was expecting based on the original yield of the recipe.  Definately will be making again though...:)

I halved the salt, doubled the sugar and beat the eggs separately until they were light and fluffy and these turned out really well.

These were very tasty! Perfect as is... and very close to Mark Bittman's recipe (which has been my favorite for some time.) I only had xl eggs and inadvertantly used 2... still tasted great, but next time I'll use either 1 or be sure to have large.

This was my first attempt at making waffles and I must admit that I was very happy with the outcome!  I made two batches and doubled the vanilla in each (I will probably add a little more sugar next time).  I made half with chocolate chips and the other half  with cinnamon & pecan pieces.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

These were a bit dense, but tasty nonetheless. I didn't sift the dry ingredients (used whole wheat pastry flour) this time, but will see if that lessens the density next time.  I whipped up some fresh cream with a tad of agave nectar and used grade A 100% maple syrup over the waffles.  Fresh sliced strawberries and blueberries really added a nice touch to these.  This recipe made more batter than we could eat in one sitting, but we used it all up and froze the leftover waffles in zip lock baggies for the next weekend. The were equally terrific a week later warmed in the toaster.  Truly wonderful!

Absolutely love this recipe the best of all waffle recipes I have tried.  I especially like that there is butter instead of oil in this recipe.  I can even smell the vanilla as the waffles bake!  We can never eat all of the waffles so I freeze the leftover waffles with pieces of waxed paper in between and then pop them in the toaster--crisp and perfect!

This is now my go-to waffle recipe. I make a batch of homemade waffles for my family about once a week. This recipe is always so easy to throw together in the morning and the waffles taste delicious (about a thousand times better than frozen waffles). I've varied it a bit at times, too, by adding blueberries or chocolate chips. It always turns out well!

Oh so good. As recommended, I doubled the sugar and vanilla. I also beat the egg whites separately and then folded them in at the very last. The butter in this recipe really makes these oh so yummy (do not substitute). This was my first attempt at homemade waffles and they came out great!!

Works perfectly in PHILIPS Cucina 3-in-One gadget. The waffles are quick and easy. Very light and if left long enough in the waffle iron, they really are beautifully crisp on the outside and delicious to eat.

Easy to prepare. Very light and tasty. This will definitely be my waffle recipe from now on. i didn't change anything in the recipe at all. Even the first waffle out of the waffle maker was good! Thanks for sharing.

I found the batter too heavy. I whipped the egg whites prior to mixing them with the batter. I liked the crispiness of the waffles but they didn't fluff up enough for my family's taste.

Made a ton and had plenty left over to freeze for later. Great with powdered sugar and syrup.

Crisp and fluffy, these waffles are rad! They are great following the recipe as is, but I usually add an extra egg (result of forgetting I was halving the recipe and messing up on the egg count). It makes them extra fluffy on the inside and crisp on the outside, without an eggy taste. Experiment with more vanilla, or almond extract. Also, try adding in some cinnamon to taste, I want to say it was about a tsp, and it made these seriously the best waffles I had ever had anywhere! Try topping with brown sugar it melts into the butter and syrup!

This is our one and only recipe for weekend waffles, they come out perfect every time! My husband is always adding chocolate chips, blueberries, pecans, etc. they're great alone or with pretty much anything you can imagine. We saved so much money using this recipe & not buying that box waffle mix at the market.

These are delicious and super easy! light and crisp just the way I like them. The only change I made was to separate the eggs and whip the egg whites then fold them in very last. Thanks for a great recipe!

Excellant recipee.  I like the touch of vanilla.  In my waffle iron it took exactly 4 minutes (each).    I split the recipe in half and it was a perfect 2 servings.

Very good!  These were very simple to make.  I added a teaspoon of Cinnamon and an addtional tsp. of sugar to the mix for a little more sweetness. Very yummy, my kids loved them.

After testing s few waffle recipes we've declared this one our favourite. It crisps very nicely on the exterior while maintaining a chewy, not doughy, centre. I do add 1/4 cup ground brown flax seed to the recipe and substitute 1/2 cup of the white for whole wheat flour just to add some fibre. I don't feel this affects the texture or flavour at these amounts and don't need to add any extra liquid to compensate either. This has become the staple for 'Waffle Sunday', a tradition for 9 months since I came across this recipe, and nobody's sick of it yet! Final note: I double the recipe and freeze the rest for quick school morning breakfasts (pop in the toaster) and the kids also love them in place of bread for 'waffle sandwiches' in school lunches.

Today I made waffles for the first time ever and I used this recipe.  They turned out wonderfully!  We didn't think the amount made would be enough (it did make more than 5 servings, but they were small waffles)--but they actually ended up very filling!

I just have to review again how wonderful these waffles are.  I have been making them for 2 years now and no other recipes come close.  I make them every Sunday now.  They are crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.   I started adding precooked chopped breakfast sausage to the batter and they are sooo yummy!!!  Just can't thank you enough for such a wonderful family tradition.

Excellent recipe. Few ingredients & simple to make. To keep the batter fluffy, wait until just before baking to mix the wet & dry ingredients. I made "Chicken & Waffles" -- a white gravy thick with chicken. My husband grew up in Amish Country, so I decided to surprise him with my own version.

i had just gotten home from grocery shopping and realized I didn't have enough waffle mix for our planned breakfast. I decided to look on allrecipes.com and appropriately enough this recipe was recipe of the day. I was in a hurry to feed my 2 year old son and equally hungry/grumpy husband and left out the sugar and vanilla. They still tasted fabulous and I won't use a mix again. Thanks!!

I found this recipe very easy to make and the waffles came out fluffy and tasty. I added chocolate chips to the batter and they turned out great!! Makes alot of waffles though, I plan to at least halve the recipe next time I prepare.

This is a really good waffle recipe. I made some changes to it. I added half a teaspoon of cinnamon. I think you could do half a teaspoon of salt and with all of that baking powder you have to sift it because we had lumps. We thought it was light and fluffy and not too sweet.

These were delicious, my family really enjoyed them and my DH said to not lose this recipe.  I did add 1 more tablespoon of sugar, but kept everything else the same.  My belgian waffle maker made 6 waffles with this recipe.

Great recipe. I used real butter and used 3 tbsp sugar instead of 2.

These are so good!  We'll never buy boxed again.  I took some suggestions, I upped the butter to 1/2 cup, 2 tbsp vanilla and 5 tbsp sugar. I sifted and separated :D  YUMMY!  I am going to freeze a batch and see how they hold up to reheating!  My DD asked "why" then tasted one and with big eyes said it was the best waffle she'd ever had, including some restaurant brunch waffles!  I always froze my own pancakes and thought why not waffles.  (Nothing like homemade to cut out as many genetically engineered foods as possible). My motive was no GMO's and no MSG, but that is lost in the FABULOUS taste and texture of these waffles!

Good base recipe. A bit bland. Next time I think we'll add more sugar and/or vanilla. Needs to be sweeter.

This is a good base. I topped with fresh fruit and yogurt. I think it is a little bland and needs some flavor.. cinnamon or something...

Well I have never made waffles before and hardly eat them so I don't have much to compare them to.  My husband requested them and I made them as is (usually I read reviews and adjust all my recipes but I didn't have time) I may have used a little less butter then it asked for but they were still really good.  I topped it with honey and it was great.

These waffles are excellent. The following were the only deviations I made: 1. Melt a little extra butter to brush on waffle iron. 2. Separate the eggs. 3. Fold in the beaten egg whites last. The waffles are light, fluffy, and taste delicious.

This was my first attempt at making waffles from scratch--on a new iron no less. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added cinnamon. My family enjoyed them, but I think they could have been much better. Will work on "tweaking" this recipe. Thanks for a great beginning waffle recipe!!

Wow Wow Wow!  I can't say enough about these waffles...they are better than any I've had in restaurants!  I made these last night, cooled them, then brought them to work today (I feed everyone homemade breakfast every Friday!), and my co-workers devoured these!  They are even great warmed up in the microwave!  I didn't do anything differently except I used skim milk and added a tiny bit more vanilla than called for.  Everyone is still raving about them...even our warehouse guy just came into my office and assured me that whoever I marry will be a lucky lucky man because of my waffles...this one is most definitely a keeper!

Not blown away, but craving was satisfied. I separated yolks and whites; beat whites until stiff and folded in. Also added 3/4 tsp. cinammon. It needed something...an extra egg? Nutmeg? Can't put my finger on it...

I am chomping on one of these waffles now and they are great! We also sifted the dry ingredients, and I don't know if it did anything, but it sure didn't hurt these crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside tasty breakfast treats. Thanks for the recipe!

I've been cooking and baking for quite some time, and to finally find a waffle recipe that is not only easy (and cheap!) to make but that also has a light and fluffy texture to it, is remarkable. I have also noticed that quite a few of the reviews for this recipe include some individuals adding cinnamon and perhaps chocolate chips to the batter before cooking the waffles themselves, and I have to say that its quite a nice addition. While the recipe is great by itself, the inclusion of various items such as those are a most welcome addition. Kudos to the creator of this recipe!

I like these.  I like to make a double batch and then heat the leftovers up in the morning in the toaster oven so they are nice and crispy like a waffle cookie!

This recipe is awesome! We love it and make it almost every Sunday morning. We use multigrain flour in place of all purpose to make them a bit more healthy and filling. We make a double batch so we have leftovers for the freezer too. We just pop them into the toaster and there's a great breaky for the kids on a school day. Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful recipe!  I've tried many others and they never quite turned out.  These were perfect and I followed the recipe exactly.  My 2 and 4 year old gobbled them down and they have never really cared much for waffles.  Next time I think I'll try some blueberries or cinnamon.  Fun!

It was great! I would totally do it again, but I gave it 4 stars because every time that I make it I have to add a little extra flour. probably 1/4 to 1/2 cup. Great recipe though!

These were good.  They didn't crisp up as much as I was hoping though.  They also soaked up maple syrup like crazy.  The batter was enough for 4 restaraunt size Belgian waffles.

I just made this recipe, and it was brilliant. I made it for my parents and little sister. Normally my sister will only eat 1/2 a waffle, this time she ate the whole thing! The whole family loved it. THANKS!

A very good basic recipe.  The waffles came out perfect.  You may want to sift the dry ingredients so there are no small lumps in the batter.  Very easy to make.

These turned out quite well.  We followed the recipe exactly and they made waffles that were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  Will definitely use as our waffle recipe from now on.

Very yummy.  I compared it to another recipe I had that used one cup each of all-purpose and whole wheat flour and two tablespoons of sugar but used buttermilk, which I didn't have.  So I followed this recipe but did use the cup each of all-purpose and whole wheat flour and added the extra sugar.  I don't think that they needed the extra sugar, they were almost too sweet but I like the flavor and extra goodness the whole wheat flour brings.  When making a large batch of waffles for my family I have found that laying them on a cooling rack and then moving them to a warm oven is the best.  These were by far the very best right off the waffle maker when they were extra crispy.  Thanks for the recipe!

The best waffles! My whole family loves them. They cook perfectly crunchy outside and moist inside. You can also cook them for a shorter period of time if you like them softer on the outside. I add a little applesauce to make them a little more moist inside.

Wow! Fabulously quick to make, absolutely tasty, and much better than the more difficult recipes I've been using. I like my waffles spiced and add almost 1 tsp. of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg, and 1/4 tsp. cardamom. Mmmm... writing this makes me crave them again!

Awesome waffles!  Really easy too. I love to mix plain yogurt with a little jam and use as a spread on top.  Probably would be really good with fresh fruit or ice cream too.

This recipe was easy; however, the amount of baking powder, I believe, altered the flavor of the waffles. They had an odd flavor to them when eaten. At first I thought I put in too much salt, but after looking again at the recipe, realized that the amount (4 teaspoons) of baking powder might have been too much. had to scrap the whole batch because they did not taste good.

Maybe I am just used to the pre-made store bought waffles, but this waffle had a bitter aftertaste. I used the converter to cut it down to one serving, and the recipe seemed to call for an awful lot of baking soda for such a small amount of batter. Not good. Will NOT make again.

This recipe was GREAT !! Our family cooks a big breakfast every sunday and when we make waffles we always used Jiffy mix, cause it is easy. I ran out of the mix and decided to make from scratch... needless to say we won't be going back to the box.

This recipe is awesome.  I usually don't have the ready made stuff in the house because being the only one who likes pancakes or waffles, it isn't worth it.  But I wanted waffles this morning and found this recipe.  Boy, am I glad I did.  This is a great recipe and will keep forever!!  Great taste and came out well in the waffle maker.

I doubled the recipe so I could freeze the leftovers and it turned out delicious. This was the first time I made them from scratch. The only thing I changed was I used splenda instead of sugar and no one knew or could tell the difference.

I mixed the batter in the blender as recommended by a past review and it was perfect! Easy to make, easy clean up, and delicious waffles!! My only recommendation is to let the batter sit for a few minutes to activate the baking powder before starting to cook.

This was my first attempt at homemade waffles with our new waffle iron.  My husband and I loved them.  I didn't change a thing about the recipe, but I did make sure to use real vanilla extract instead of imitation.  We had just enough batter for 5 waffles with our waring pro waffle iron.

Excellent recipe with room for improvisation.  I whipped egg whites separately while mixing together the batter and folded them in at the end.  Instead of the full amount of melted butter, I used half and added a dab of applesauce to make up the rest.  I added several shakes of cinnamon as well as vanilla for flavoring, and only used half the salt.  The final product didn't scream "apple cinnamon" but had just the slightest hint of another layer of flavor.  Served with fresh whipped cream, these disappeared in minutes.

This recipe was a hit with the family. As some others had suggested, I add a little cinnamon, and instead of just milk, I substituted about 3/4 cup of eggnog and 3/4 cup of milk. This ones a keeper, thanks!

I give these 5 stars because I found that   they fit the description as being a classic waffle.  My children gobbled these waffles up quickly with powdered sugar on them. I used oil instead of the butter because I was too lazy to melt the butter.  No complaints and will use this recipe again.

Great taste and easy to prepare.  Don't over mix your batter to insure light and fluffy waffles.  They went great with the homemade blueberry sauce I also made from this website.

Very good!  I made 2 batches - the first as the recipe is, but I found that I noticed the salt (too much).  In the second recipe I cut back the salt, added cinnamon, and extra vanilla.  Yummmmy! :)

These were easy to make. A little bland but that's something I can work with so I will make again and just tweak it a little to make them a little more flavorful.

I just finished eating dinner and made these waffles. Sometimes it is so fun to eat breakfast for dinner. My whole familt loved these. The only thing I did different is I substituted Splenda for the sugar as both my father and myself are diabetics. These waffles are so yummy, I loved the vanilla flavor. They cooked up very nicely, a lovely golden brown color and just slightly crisp. Thank you so very much for this recipe. I will be making these again!

The waffles were easy to prepare and very crisp and tasty.  All I needed to add was some jam on top.  They also cooked better in my waffle iron than the recipes in the manual did.

I used all whole wheat flour and substituted an 8th of a cup with flax meal and I also used brown sugar.  Very yummy!!   Not very sweet but that's what syrup's for right?

I made these waffles exactly as the recipe suggests for my picky husband and houseguests with children.  The results got rave reviews from all.  They were crisp on the outside and filling but not too heavy. This is now my go-to waffle recipe!

I made this with just 2 changes:  I used half whole wheat flour, and used 3 heaping tbsp of sugar (we like sweet pancakes).  They turned out absolutely wonderful!  I thought they were perfect, but my family didnt rave about them (they are very hard to please), although they did say they were very good, hence the 4 stars.  We have a family of 8, and i doubled the recipe.  We use the leftovers for breakfast later in the week, just reheat in the toaster :)

I made these this morning because I wanted waffles but was all out of mix. This recipe was (almost) as simple as using a mix. I had self rising flour, so I omitted the salt and baking soda since it's already included there. I also added cinnamon to the flour mix. Delicious! These came out light and crispy on the outside--something I never got when I made waffles from a mix. Terrific recipe! It's a definite keeper.

I have made these waffles since I got my waffle maker last year.  I add different fruit depending on the season and everyone loves them.  I make them at the trailer and everyone lines up hoping I have leftovers.

My family just got a waffle iron yesterday, so I though I'd try this recipe because of the amazing reviews. I have to say I wasn't wowed or anything, but they were still pretty good. I cut the recipe in half, but I thought that 2 tsp. of baking powder was too much; it almost gave the waffles a bitter taste. I think I'd like more vanilla next time. My waffles were golden delicious, but not very crispy on the outside. I think that's my waffle iron's problem. Still though, great recipe!

The vanilla was a nice touch, but overall I found the batter to be chewy/rubbery...not fluffy enough.

I am giving these a 4 after completely botching the recipe - which means they're probably a 5!  I was attempting to halve the recipe and halved all the ingredients EXCEPT the flour.  But we made a comeback!  The batter smells fantastic and the texture is great.  I bet the next time I make these they will be even better.  Definitely going in my breakfast queue!

Very light and fluffy.  I have made them with regular all-purpose flour and whole wheat flour.  Both tasted very good, but in different ways.

Fantastic! The first time I made them, I made the mistake and beat the batter by hand - it turned out quite lumpy and thick. The second time, I wised up and used my stand mixer on a medium low speed. Tasty and delicious!

I've tried several different recipes for waffles and by far I liked this one the best.  I did add a 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon like other reviewers suggested.  Waffles turned out EXCELLENT!  My kids said "these waffles ROCK".

Not a spectacular recipe but it turned out fine.  I used just a dash of salt and then a combination of brown and white sugar along with a half tsp. of cinnamon.

These were really easy and very good. I liked that you didn't have to use buttermilk, because it's not something I usually have on hand. That being said, I think if I did use buttermilk, they would have been a "5"

We LOVED these waffles!  I haven't tried very many waffle recipes (only about 3) but this one is definetly a keeper.  The only small change I made was that I added 1 tsp of vanilla.  The waffles weren't super sweet with it, but that's perfect for when you want syrup on them!  And they weren't eggy tasting like the other recipes I tried!  These are definetly YUM-O!!!

these waffles rocked!!  Usually I change waffles a little, but these ones I made to the T and they were some of the best, they had great texture and great taste, the were fluffy, but not soggy or overly soft.  I really liked them..maybe next time I will try them with buttermilk and see how they are....

The texture was good and they were easy to make.  However they turned out much too salty, there is way too much baking powder and salt in them, I would cut them both in half before if I make them again.

I was a bit disappointed, found this rather too thick to cook easily in my ancient waffle iron, and believe more milk to flour needed.

We just got a waffle iron.  We tried many recipes and this one is the best.  I used the 1/2 c. wheat flour and 1 1/2 c. white flour.  The whole family likes it.

I was very happy with how this recipe turned out.  I wouldn't change a thing!  Used brown sugar instead of white, only because I was out of the latter.  Perfect consistency.

These are EXCELLENT!  Put a little more vanila and beat the eggs until frothy.  They freeze well also.  The texture is PERFECT.

My family LOVES these. The only things I changed on this recipe was that I added 1 more teaspoon of vanilla extract and 1 more tablespoon of white sugar. They are VERY good, VERY filling, and VERY easy and quick to make for breakfast in the morning. Sometimes I don't put anything on the waffle because they just taste so delicious by themselves! Yum! =D

I have never tasted waffles that are so buttery and delicious!  The warm milk makes these waffles very light and tasty.  I add chocolate chips to half of my hot batter.  The chips melt and PRESTO! chocolate waffles - my daughter's favorite.

My kids love these waffles...I use 1 1/2 c unbleached all-purpose flour and 1/2 c whole wheat flour.  Also substitute canola oil for the melted butter.  I store leftovers in a ZipLoc bag in the refrigerator and toast them when the kids are ready for more.

I was looking for a quick waffle recipe one morning and found this. These waffles were so good, my husband said not to make them anymore, b/c he ate so many. Both my sons had two each. This is a really good one. THANKS!!

I thought these waffles were really boring! I thought they were going to be really light and fluffy and they turned out hard and dense.
They aren't horrible but I would try another recipe next time

Very good! I added cinnamon to the batter and decreased the salt to 1/2 teaspoon after reading a earlier review. my husband said these were better than the ones I had made before (the recipe from the product manual).

Very good, crispy. I used 3 eggs and added a pinch of nutmeg and about 1/2 t cinnamon. I didn't like my waffle maker booklet's recipe so I used this one instead.  I think the butter definitely makes a difference, a tastier waffle.

A lovely waffle batter. I found the batter very thin though and had to add 1/2 cup extra flour. Cooked very well in my waffle iron.

So simple, but so good.  Waffles are big in my house, and we were looking for a "classic" recipe to test out our new waffle iron.  This one was a huge hit with adults and kids alike.  Cooked up quickly, crispy but not oversly so, with an excellent flavor compliments of the warmed milk and vanilla.

I used this recipe for the 1st time a week ago for my family and i, and my 11 month old who HATES frozen waffles, LOVED these fresh homemade waffles. I've made this 2 more times this week, adding some mashed banana and extra vanilla for an extra sweet kick. Great recipe! Thank you thank you!!

These were good waffles.  I might be a bit too picky.  I added 1/2 cup more flour, cut back the salt, added cinnamon, and I separated the egg whites, fluffed the whites and them folded them in at the end.  My children loved it and I loved the way this recipe was easy to work with.

I made these waffles, but they are a little on the bland side.  Even though I added two extra tablespoons of sugar, cinnamon and an extra teaspoon of vanilla, it still wasn't very tasty.  However, I would suggest adding maybe a 1/2 cup of flour, two teaspoons of vanilla and maybe a 1/4 to 1/3 cup of sugar.

This is a very nice waffle recipe. The directions are easy to follow and it is no trouble at all to whip up for kids on their way out the door for school. It also works well when a change is in order and you want to throw in bananas or some other tasty addition! A must for any kitchen!

I've never made home-made waffles before.  These were ok but a little bland and soft.  I will try real butter next time as suggested.  And maybe add a few ingredients to spice it up!  Kids did love them though.

I wouldn't say these are the best waffles but they were good and alot better than many I've tried to make before. I substituted 3/4 cup cream and 3/4 cup warm water for the milk and cut back on the salt and added a little more sugar. The leftover waffles froze well and tasted fine after popping it into the toaster oven.

These waffles turned out really well. They weren't "crispy", but that's okay because they were really fluffy. I added vanilla and cinnamon, which really worked well. Nice recipe!
