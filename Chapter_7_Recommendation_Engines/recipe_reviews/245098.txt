my family loved this!! I made it without jalapeno because my son isn't a fan of too much heat and I went with condensed milk instead of half and half to make it a bit healthier and it was perfect.

This is my favorite soup as of now!  I had chicken breasts in the fridge so chose to slice and sauce the chicken instead of going out to buy a rotisserie chicken, but otherwise made it exactly as the recipe stated.  We couldn't eat it quickly enough.  Yumm!!!

AMAZING!  It went so quick I didn't have time to take a picture.  My husband said it was a wonderful change from the normal potato soup.  I did have to make some adjustments because I didn't have some things.  I replaced the half and half with some milk and sour cream and I didn't have any canned green chilis so that was just omitted.  I just used more jalapeño.

I made this recipe exactly as written except for the jalapeños. I don’t like them. This was outstanding. I have also experimented with adding black beans and rotel tomatoes. I like both additions, but my favorite is the original recipe sans jalapeños. My family agrees. Yum. Yum. Yum.

I omitted the bacon, used only half the amount of cream, and used two shredded chicken breasts instead of the rotisserie and it was still amazing.

Excellent, hearty soup! Great Comfort food for a chilly winter evening! Even with a lot of minor ingredient changes to make it gluten-free and use things I had on hand, it was wonderful. My changes certainly didn’t improve it though, and it deserves 5 stars as written. My changes were: 5 regular cut slices of bacon instead of 10, yellow pepper instead of red, canned jalapeños instead of fresh, cornstarch instead of flour, regular broth instead of unsalted, russet potatoes instead of Yukon gold, 3 whole dried chili peppers, removed when done cooking, instead of a can of chili’s, and 2% milk instead of half and half. The recipe made 8 generous servings (a bit over 8 fluid oz each).

I did not use bacon fat to sauté my veggies.  I added an extra jalapeño and used 2 green pepper instead of red.  Used hot green chiles.  Took longer than 12m to get my potatoes tender.  I seasoned my chicken with salt and pepper then cooked and shredded in place of rotisserie and i seasoned my corn with lime and salt.  I also added a can of black beans when i added the corn.  Added all the bacon at the same time.  Used a 16oz tub of Sour Cream instead of Half & Half, used 1 cup Mexican Cheese Blend and 1 cup Pepper Jack.  Skipped the green onions.  Very spicy and totally delicious!

One of the best soups I’ve ever made! Followed exactly but could not find canned chillies so I used canned jalapeños chopped.  I topped it with cheese and crushed taco chips

Excellent.  Didn’t use the suggested spices (except garlic) because I added a half can of rotel and that was spicy enough for us.  Also added a can of cream of potato soup with the grated cheese.

Delicious soup.   The only thing I didn’t have was enough cheddar cheese, so I put Velveeta in the soup and cheddar as garnish.  It was perfect.  A bit labor intensiv e, but good!

I had canned jalapeno, omitted the green chilies, and subbed celery for the bell pepper ( I didn't want to go grocery shopping and used what I had).  Also used canned chicken.  The flavors are amazing in this and i think the recipe is flexible so you can tinker with it which is always nice.  Thank you.  I will make it again.

This is a delicious soup! I scaled it down to 5 servings and used one large Yukon gold potato. I did not have regular bacon on hand to use,  but I'm sure it would be even better doing that step. In place of the jalapeno (which I  also didn't have), I just went a little heavier with the cayenne and other spices, and it had a nice bite to it.  For the corn, I used half of a 14.5 oz can of creamed style corn. I also only added enough half & half until I got the desired color (less than listed). Thanks for this great recipe!!

I really thought I was going to love this soup.  It has so many of the things I love, but in the end I found it unsatisfying.  Like a promise unfulfilled I just found myself wanting something more.

Amazing!!! What a fantastic flavor. My family said to add to our list of favorite recipes. Just enough kick thanks to the jalapeños but not overpowering. Made exactly as the recipe was written.

So good. My new favorite soup recipe. Used leftover pulled pork in place of chicken which worked very well.

Fabulous, we love to cook. Tweaked a bit for us but not by much. Less bacon, used fresh corn from cob, added some kale, added some Cholula for our heat, spices were fabulous, will add more chicken and less potato to our liking... just a wonderful soup, had left over for 2 days. Hubby loved it and he loves to eat and is picky!

Excellent soup even without the bacon and jalapenos!  I can't imagine how delicious this would be with the bacon. Definitely a keeper. My entire family loved it. My husband asked if I would make this again. My daughter scarfed it up.

Loved it, the seasoning delicious and I liked the creaminess from the half and half. We didn't do the jalapenos because didn't have any. This made it so it had a hint of spicy but not to much which was perfect for what we were in the mood for. If you like spicy be sure to add the jalapenos.

I halved the green chilies and left out the jalapeno -- simply so it wasn't too spicy for my children. It was still delicious and a bit spicy.  I will definitely make this again.
