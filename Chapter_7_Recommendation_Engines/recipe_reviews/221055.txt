For people who are having problem with texture. Try cutting off the stems of the BABY spinach, chopping the carrots into smaller peices and blend them first for a few minutes then add the fruit. You can add or subtract fruits also. I love adding pineapple juice or grapejuice to mine. And my mom adds bluberries and other berries to hers.

I like it better with the spinach and carrots juiced first, and then added to the fruit. If you don't want to juice them, or don't have a juicer - try freezing them before putting them in the blender. It helps them break up more and turns out less.... chunky.

A Vitamix or other strong blender makes these green smoothies great tasting with no chunks.  You need to experiment to get the right balance of sweetness.  I like to add ground flaxseed/hempseed for extra protein.

I'm an adult that loves fruits and vegetables and I cannot imagine trying to feed this to a kid. It tasted like I was chewing/drinking straight spinach. Won't make this again.

I cut this recipe down to one serving and measured the ingredients very carefully. I blended the spinach and carrots in the juice first to make sure I didn't have unground bits of veggies in my drink. Then I added the rest of the ingredients. I ended up with a thick smoothie that had a predominant banana flavor and was orange in color. Not bad for my breakfast this morning, but the name didn't fit it:)

Not sure why people are having problems with texture. I used a regular blender and did batches to ensure a smooth smoothie. I did do the carrots and juice first until mostly smooth, then spinach,  blend, apples, blend, bananas, blend, strawberries and ice, finally blend. Tasted pretty good and up the rating to 5 stars since it has 2 types of veggies. Will make again.

We added vanilla yogurt because it was a little bland & the color was brownish so I added food coloring to make it more appealing for the kids.  It was good though. The best part is most the children liked it so they have no idea they consumed carrots & spinach

Really good, and if you slice the carrots no trouble blending it with a BlendTech.  On my third glass of this smoothie, I added some  (about 4 ounces or so, but add to your desired consistency) almond milk (milk would be fine too) and the smoother consistency made it even more enjoyable.

I used 1 cup of spinach and 1 cup of kale. I read the reviews and took the advice of blending greens and liquid first. I had to add some water because it was pretty thick. I couldn't get the apple peel to reduce all the way but overall It tasted great! The bananas really helped with masking that bitter green flavor that you usually taste in green smoothies.

I really liked this smoothie!  I made 1 serving and found I had to add about 1/4 cup of water due it being too thick.  What a nice way to get your vegetables!
