I actually found this to be a bit bland (though I am an adult). I doubt I'll make this again but at the VERY least I'd get rid of the beans and add some kinda of fruit chipotle. Also I'm going to have to take exception to the description of "full balanced mean" unless the other side of the scale has a bowling ball on it.
