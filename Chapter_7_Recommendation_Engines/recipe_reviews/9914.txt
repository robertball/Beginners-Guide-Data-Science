The crust stayed doughy the first batch I made so I cooked the crust for 10 mins. then added the batter and cooked it for 30 mins.

I totally take back my previous post (see below).  I had tasted the bars after they'd only been out of the oven for about a half hour.   The key is to let them sit for a few hours.  They are incredibly addictive!  I still believe the crust should be baked first, though.    

I was so excited to try this recipe because I had some jam that needed to be used up.  Plus it seemed to have all the right makings for a yummy dessert (hence the name).  I was totally disappointed.  The bottom crust should have been baked first before putting on the jam.  However this wouldn't have helped rescue this recipe because it's just way too sweet.

I have made a similar recipe to this for years minus the jam.   They are sweet enough as is so adding jam is just away too much for our tastes.   Otherwise they were always a favorite and other nuts can be substituted.   Baking the crust for even 5 mins. does make a difference.

Disaster.  Not sure what went wrong, since I followed the recipe exactly, but the top crust never firmed up and the jam became super running.

It's sweet, that's true, but really really good! the walnuts give it a "different" flavour and also a rough texture that almonds or other nuts lack, in my opinion. I tasted it just out from the oven and still don't know how it really turned out after a few hours. I doubled the recipe and baked it in a 9x13 inch pan and even changing the proportions, which is sometimes risky, I say thumb up!

My family really liked the bar. This is a good way to use up strawberry jam.

My son and I loved this but my husband found it too sweet.  Next time I think I will omit the jam.  Sure was yummy though!!!  Very rich, only need a little piece.

Good but not a wow dessert.  Best warm with milk or ice cream.  Very easy to make.
