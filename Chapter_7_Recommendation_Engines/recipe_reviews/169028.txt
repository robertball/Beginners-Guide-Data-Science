I changed this recipe quite a bit, but it turned out fabulous and I wanted to thank Jeff.  This is the first time I have ever reviewed a recipe.  I made the changes because I didn't have all the exact ingredients.  I used top sirloin steaks instead of the flank steak.  I didn't have jalepenos or pickled carrots, so I substituted sliced mushrooms for those.  Also I used canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated.  I cooked the entire recipe on the stove top at low heat for health reasons.  I added a little chopped garlic on top of the steaks (from a jar).  With all these changes, the result was gourmet delicious.  My husband and son and I enjoyed it immensely. The horseradish really made the taste scrumptious.  Thanks, Jeff, for a great idea.  We will definitely make this again.

I can't understand why this recipe doesn't have a "hundred" reviews. It's like a hidden little gem.
  
I call it my pantry recipe because everything was on hand with a short walk to my personal "store".
I used beef stock instead of cubes and canned artichoke hearts instead of marinated,  a half can of green chili's instead of pickled jalapeno's because that's what I had on hand.
I used 2 chuck steaks that I wanted to used up because I left them in the freezer too long, I'm sure we have all done that from time to time! So I was looking for a dish with a host of strong flavors to compensate for any loss of flavor to the meat and  this really fit the bill.  
Other than those minor changes I made this just like the author presented.   
My husband loves horseradish and the aroma comng from the oven was driving him crazy before it was served.  After it was served, we agreed this would go into my book of favorite recipes.  Thanks so much for offering it.

I COOKED THIS ENTIRELY ON THE STOVE.  ADDED SWEET MARSALA WHEN THICKENING THE SAUCE.  USED FRESH CARROTS SLICED VERY THIN AND BOILED IN SOME BEEF BROTH IN THE MICROWAVE.  USED LOTS OF GARLIC AND SEASONINGS.

Really good, Jeff. I do it over a bed of wild rice. My wife and I get cravings for this dish from time to time. That's the real test of a recipe! My compliments.

This was delish!!! I did not add the jalapeno peppers because mom can not have them, and   pickled carrots could not find. Was still great. We all loved it and will be making it again. It's a keeper.

I made this almost as written.  I did not have the pickled carrots, so I sliced some carrots and cooked in beef broth in the microwave until soft.  I also used canned artichoke hears and canned jalapeno peppers, since that is what I had on hand.  I was super excited to try this recipe, as I was trying to find something to make with the beef I had and the ingredients in my pantry that was different than the old stand by stroganoff or beef stew.  While this was easy to make, I found it quiet sour and the boiled beef, eh.  I am not sure the pickeled carrots would have improved the flavor, as the sourness from the capers and the artichokes was in of themselves, strong.  I like that most of the time, but I did pair this with some green beans cooked with bacon and onions and that seems to help...maybe add some bacon???  I may make again, but not likely.

Loved it - would leave out the jalapeno next time, just because the kids thought it was a little spicy.  However, they loved it!

I would have given this 5 stars except that it turned out too salty.  Will absolutely try this one again but will use no salt or reduced salt beef stock instead of bullion.  Will rinse the capers and the jalapenos and use a lighter hand when salting the steak.  I didn't use pickled carrots either (fresh cut).  Served it with frizzled leaks on top and a side salad.  Family loved it.  There were no leftovers (always a sign of a good recipe).  Thanks Jeff

I followed the recipe pretty close.  I used beef broth instead of bullion and I used the carrots I had out of the Pickled Jalapenos and Carrots recipe I had in the fridge from this site.  The meat was a little tough although I tenderized it with a mallet.  The flavor was pretty good.  Just the right amount of spicy. Served it over rice.

Excellent!  Like others I had to modify a few ingredients (no jalapenos or capers) added onions and mushrooms. My skirt steak was a little thin so I would cook it for a shorter time next time to have a more medium cooked steak. The flavors were AMAZING, I will def be cooking this again!!
