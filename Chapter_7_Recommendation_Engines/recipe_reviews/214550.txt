I would rate this 6 stars if I could. I made it exactly like the recipe except I used ground turkey instead of beef. When it was finished I took my submersion blender and used it to just make it a little thicker.  It was the best bolognese sauce I have ever tasted. 5 STARS FOR VALERIE!

This was a nice sauce that the whole family enjoyed.  We like a meatier sauce so I doubled the meat.  Very good recipe that I will keep using.

Just so so.  Flavor was good, but the recipe was a little more trouble than the finished product ended up.  The canned tomatoes cooked down and the remaining peels were an unappealing texture in the sauce.

This is wonderful sauce!  I did use both 1/2 lb ground beef and about 1/2 lb Johnsonville Italian Sausage.  I only had non fat milk so I decided to use cream instead of milk and I am glad I did.  Very nice, indeed.  Thank you Valerie.

I increased the ground beef to one pound & followed the rest of the recipe as written. I found it was far too sweet though, so I may omit the sugar next time.

Omg this is so much better than my normal recipe! Only thing I changed was fresh oregano and fresh basil. Everything else was as specified.  Seriously, so good.
