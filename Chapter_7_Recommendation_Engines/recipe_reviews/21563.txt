This was a great recipe to use with leftover ham.  My father is a VERY picky eater - but he loved it!  Highly recommended!

1/4 cup is way too much mustard for any dish i think, i had to add alot of brown sugar and ketchup to even that taste out-but other than that it is a great recipe for something quick

This was good for a quick and easy meal.  I do agree with another reviewer about cutting down on the mustard and adding a little more brown sugar, but it was good as it is written also.  Thanks for sharing!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars.  I found there was way too much sauce.  I added a flour/water paste to thicken it up.  If I made it again I would 1/2 the amount of sauce.  I also found the mustard taste a bit overpowering so I would put a bit less of that and maybe add more brown sugar.  It was interesting and I might make it again.  It was alright.

Not quite as good as recipies of this where you cook it in a crock pot all day and have more sauce, but it is still really good for something quick.  I definitely would make this again.

I thought this was really good. I served it with rice. I made the recipe as is but maybe added a little more ham. The sauce is a nice thinner consistency making it perfect for rice or noodles. If you are looking for more of a gravy this is not it. The taste was delicious!

I thought this recipe was simple, quick and very tasty!  I actually didn't put any mustard in the sauce (not really a mustard lover) and I thought it was excellent.  Actually making it again tonight!

This was a tasty initial meal entree, and the ground leftovers made a wonderful sandwich - on toasted bread with lettuce and mayo.

We made ham sandwiches with ours and it was delicious. With or without cheese. (Husband added cheese, I didn't). Used buttered French bread because that's what I had on hand, but next time I will get hamburger buns and I'm sure it will be just as great.

I agree with most others about the mustard. The brown sugar and the mustard amounts need to be reversed. Great with a rice dish.

If you don't like a mustard bbq sauce you will not like this one.  I thought it was pretty tasty.  I used a ham steak and chopped it up and served it over egg noodles.  I almost thought it was a tad to sweet and added about a T of pepper.  Thanks for sharing it was easy to do.

I really love these Ham Barbeque sandwiches as I've always heard them called.  There is so much taste from satuee onions first.  I always use chipped, virginia ham (not the fatty junk).  Also, personal taste... I use 3/4 C ketchup and only a heavy squirt of yellow mustard.  Love this on toasted onion buns.  Add a coleslaw or potato salad and now you've got yourself a great summer meal... quick too!

This is a quick and easy recipe that puts a nice twist on left over ham.  I made it and served it over pasta.  Even the kids liked it!

This is now our favorite BBQ sauce.  I made a low sugar version with sugar free ketchup and Splenda brown sugar.  I also used only 2 TBSP of mustard and used dried minced onions, since I did not have any fresh.  This added so much flavor to our Easter ham and my family also loved it on their macaroni and cheese.  I think I will mix up a double batch of this recipe and keep it in the refrigerator.  YUM!

I borrowed this idea for some extra ham... fried the onion, placed ham on top, and poured some leftover sloppy jo mixture (which is about the same as other ingredients, minus the vinegar and worceshershire).
Served with mashed potatoes and the whole family loved it!

with all the complaints about mustard I used 1 tablespoon instead of the 1/4 c or 4 tablespoons required.  I also increased the brown sugar to about 1/3 cup.   it was liquidy but If I wanted to change it I could have used some corn starch mixed with some water it most likely would have been better had I used rice instead of stuffing but I told everyone the stuffing was on the side  along with broccoli everyone said it tasted good

This was OK, I liked the BBQ sauce.  I'd strongly recommend cooking the ham a bit, then add the BBQ sauce.  Ham releases a boatload of water, so this recipe will turn into soup if you don't cook that water off first.
