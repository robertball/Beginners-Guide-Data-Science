Awesome GF breader!!!!! I do agree with Buckwheat Queen however; soak your meat in a few TBSP of buttermilk beforehand and double those spices. I cooked mine in an air fryer

I enjoyed the combination of seasonings in this recipe, but thought it was bland as written. I didn't use the powdered buttermilk and wonder if it wouldn't be better to soak the chicken in buttermilk beforehand.  I would definitely double the celery salt, paprika (I used smoked) and cayenne. I cut my chicken into strips and added some zucchini and bell pepper rings. Thank you for the recipe.

Great to know I donâ€™t have to give up fried chicken. Easy recipe. Made a huge batch, I plan to freeze and reheat during the weekday crush. Super moist! I did soak chicken in buttermilk overnight. Next time I will add some more heat, cayenne pepper. Perhaps some additional salt.
