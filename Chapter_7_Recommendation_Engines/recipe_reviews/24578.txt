I tried this recipe several times and started modifying it after the second try it was just too sweet and not enough butter to throughly disolve the four/cocoa mixture.  I decreased the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and increase the butter to 5 tablespoons.  I also combine the flour and cocoa and whisk it before I add it to the butter.  Also, if you let the butter cool for a bit after melting it will decrease the chance for lumps.  Also, I add the sugar to the milk with 1 teaspoon of vanilla and stir to disolve before adding it to the butter/cocoa/flour mixture.  The original recipe makes a great cold chocolate pudding.

My husband loves chocolate gravy, and I've been looking for a foolproof recipe. This is it--perfect thickness, perfect sweetness, creamy and smooth. Ingredient amounts and directions are right on target. My husband says this is even better than his mom's; what a compliment! Thanks so much.

Oh, my gosh, this was sublime!  Fried up some thick cut Applewood smoked bacon, served with some homemade biscuits all slathered with butter and it was a heart attack on a plate and we loved every sinful bite.  Of course, this was a trial run and we'll have to limit ourselves to this kind of mad indulgence on special occasions.  No one who has reviewed this recipe claims it's healthy and good for you and is something you'd eat every day.

I've been looking for a chocolate gravy recipe.  This recipe is very easy and it came out perfect.  It sounded like too much, so I cut the recipe in half.  I served it over buttermilk biscuits. thanks.

Thank you Mary Ann!  My grandmother made this for me when I visited her as a small child, it was something I loved almost as much as my sweet grandmother.  She served this scrumptious treat over hot bisquits with bacon and livermush.  She passed away many years ago and I never learned to make it.  I am so happy to be able to pass this on to my children, thanks to you.

I'm from the Midwest and never heard of chocolate gravy but it sounded interesting enough that I had to give it a try.  Very easy to make and wonderfully smooth and chocolately.  Am anxious to try it when company is visiting sometime.  How does it taste on waffles and pancakes?

This is soooo good. At first my mom was a bit skeptical because she doesn't like sweet stuff for breakfast, but she really liked it after she tried it! Thanks for the recipe!

My grandmother always made chocolate gravy for us when we came to visit her in Southeast Missouri - it is still a family treat.  For an even richer and fuller flavor, add 1 tsp vanilla extract.  Delicious!

We made this recipe in "Home Ec" in H.S. in the '70's, lol! A wonderful secret was...make drop dumplings with BisQuik and drop them into the simmering "soup" follow the "drop dumpling" directions on the BisQuik box....Oh my!!! It's like chocolate cobbler! Put a few slices of banana or your fav fresh fruit on top.

I still have no idea what I just made? But, it is like a chocolate pudding in texture and thickeness but, more mild, and not overly sweet tasting, like a homemade hot chocolate in taste. It is delicious! Everyone that saw it asked me why I was making pudding and wanted some! It had such a comfort food quality and tasted rather good warm or cold. I may make again to eat it plain or with homemade biscuits some morning, as others suggested. : )

My mother in law suggested I make this for my toddler, and I decided to try this recipe.  I have never had chocolate gravy before, so i have no comparision.  That being said, as far as consistency goes, the ratios were right on.  I had to add some more milk later on, as it thickened fairly quickly while on low heat.  I added an extra 1/2 T cocoa, 1/2 tsp vanilla, and 1/8 tsp salt.  It wasn't my cup of tea, but that's not to say that this recipe isn't good.  It did taste like a warm chocolate pudding, so if this is what you're looking for, this is a recipe for you!

Fantastic chocolate gravy! I made this today per my daughter's request. I used Hersheys Special Dark cocoa, as that is what I had on hand. It took a while for the gravy to thicken, however I think it was becaused I used skim milk. Next time, I will try using whole milk. It was delicious over biscuits and I'm sure I'll have requests for this again.

Back in '77 my MotherIL made this and I DID NOT want to eat it, ewww!  But when I finally gave in, OMG!  I then tweaked her recipe and it's the same as this one. After I split with my husband he called me to get this recipe. Now my kids make it for their kids and it's a favorite! Its great to see this old-skool recipe here, try it, you will love it!

I was a little nervous while cooking this... it started out thin and lumpy.  But I resisted the urge to throw more stuff in and I'm glad I did.  It turned out just wonderful!  Fantastic flavor and texture.  Yum!

Never in a million years would I have thought of making chocolate gravy.  I'm so glad I came across this!!!  I goofed, I stopped stirring to take waffles off of the waffle iron, and when I came back to the "gravy" it was more like a pudding!  We still used it to put on our waffles, and it was very yummy!!  My goof not only gave us a treat with our waffles, but a very yummy dessert also.  Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

Delicious!  I served this over cinnamon-nutmeg biscuits, and it was a hit.  My 2 yr old snuck the bowl from the table after breakfast, and he was eating the gravy right out of it...lol  Will make this again in the future!

This turned out really good.  It's kind of like a thin version of chocolate pudding.  I did have trouble on the first batch...When you put the flour and cocoa in with the butter it burns before it has a chance to thicken into a paste.  So, I had to start over and as soon as I combined the flour and cocoa I added the milk and sugar and it came out great.  My husband didn't care for this as he couldn't get over the idea of having chocolate for breakfast (his problem).  I saved the leftovers and will eat it cold later with whipped cream.  Great taste.

I made this today for my kids....they were kind of confused, (biscuits and gravy is unheard of here in Canada) but came around when I added a dollop of whipped cream. I liked it! I'll make it again, for sure.

I am the one that submitted this recipe. My suggestion was to serve it over buttered toast with bacon on the side. My family loves it like this. I suggest trying it my way before trying to modify it. Also, if there are three or more individuals eating this, I highly recommend doubling the recipe.

This was super yummy, eating it right now in fact. However, I tried taking the advice of others who reviewed this recipe by lessening the sugar and adding a little vanilla and I DO NOT recommend it. If you find it too sweet, just use less sugar.

Oh my goodness!!!! I never heard of chocolate gravy before, but this was heaven in my mouth! This is definately a keeper! It was perfect! I too cut the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and it was perfect the way it was. Thank you Mary Ann for this great recipe!

My husband's family back home makes this and I wanted to recreate it for him.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly.  As it sat, it got thicker and thicker until it was like pudding but this worked out well because I dipped the biscuits in the "pudding" and it was like an iced donut.  My kids LOVED it!  Thanks for a fabulous recipe!

My husband first introduced me to this and I loved it from first bite. I had never heard of chocolate gravy but my DH grew up on this and I finally found a recipe. My kids though weren't impressed at all and prefer sausage gravy. I like it and will make it again for just hubby and I though I'll admit it is quite a bit different from what I usually think of as biscuits and gravy.

I did change one thing on the recipe.  I used 1/4 c. of brown sugar instead of using so much white sugar.  This was a great recipe.  Quick.  Easy.  Tastes great!  I love it!

This recipe is great. I make it for my kids on special occasions. It makes alot so unless you have 5 or 6 people to serve I would cut in half. (i never do being that I have 4 kids  lol) Also in a pinch I have used 5tbsp. hot chocolate powder for the cocoa and the sugar with good results not quite as chocolatey but good none the less.

Classic comfort food. I would not even consider having a holiday breakfast without 'chocolate-over-biscuits!' :) I increase the liquid a bit and add a bit of vanilla. If this is not a tradition in your family, it should be! :)

I was so sceptical!  Being born and raised in Ohio, this receipe seemed so out of the norm.  In an effort to add variety to breakfast time, I made it this morning for my family.  Everyone loved it, from the 1 year old to my husband.  I served it over Pillsbury biscuits and it tasted just like a chocolate covered doughnut.  I will be making this again!!

From someone who has never experienced Chocolate Gravy before...but is a chocaholic.  I made it exactly as stated in recipe..and it was WONDERFUL!  Seems to me more like a chocolate pudding, and I guess the name of gravy made me think it would be less sweet and more salty.  I cant imagine my parents or grandparents allowing this for breakfast though, as this more of a dessert with not much nutritional value other than the milk.   What a wonderful dessert though! :)

This is  a recipe my mother in-law used to fix for me on weekends when I came to visit. Try adding dumplings while the mixture is cooking. use you own bisquit dough or store bought bisquits cut into pieces will do also.It is awesome.

I started using this recipe 2 years ago to share some ""southern" food with my IL-raised boyfriend and his family, and they all loved it.  I grew up on chocolate gravy, and I think this recipe is fantastic as well.  It never seems to make a "thick paste" after the cocoa and flour, but I move onto the next step and it does thicken up nicely.  Continual whisking ensures that it doesn't burn, and helps it thicken.  Perfect taste, perfect texture!

This was a great recipe. My mom used to make this when I was a kid and I loved it. The only thing I changed was I put the flour and the cocoa in a bowl and mixed it with cold milk. I melted my butter in the pan and poured the cold mixture in then I added the sugar. It turned out perfect. Yum, yum, yummy...Thanks for a great recipe...

I haven't had this in years and made it last weekend for my husband and I.  He had never had chocolate gravy and he loved it! Thank you for the great recipe and bringing back some great memories!

This was soooo good! The only changes I made were that I halved it, used a little less sugar, and added some vanilla at the end. Mine turned out a little pudding like, I think because I cooked it a little too long, so now I know for next time! I served this over the "Kentucky Biscuits" from this site...I ate four biscuits covered in this gravy, so I obviously liked it!

You can cook this in the microwave, too.  Just stir every two minutes until it's thickened.  My grandmother was SO glad that she would no longer have to stand in front of the stove, stirring and stirring!  (She had to make huge batches of this for us grandkids!)

Modified slightly - less sugar.  Will add a bit of salt next time (added at the table).  My family has voted this a keeper.  The texture is perfect - velvety. It was not pudding-like at all, but would have been, if continued cooking.  The flavor is like homemade chocolate pie.  Next time we will use as a breakfast dessert, following eggs, and/or add a side of strawberries.

I made this for hubby who has told me for several years about his Mom's great chocolate gravy.  Although I used skim milk and Domino (less sugar), he said it tasted like his Moms.  He ate this a.m. over pancakes.  Thanks for the recipe!

I scaled it back to 2 servings because I was very skeptical and I didn't have any cocoa. I used some Nesquik and it turned out ok. Accualy it was great. I ate it all before I could make any toast. Now I'm off to the store so i can try it with cocoa.

My grandmother used to make this for us kids all the time (yep, I'm a southerner!) as did my uncle whenever we spent the night at his house.  I had the recipe years ago, but have since divorced and my ex kept just about everything.  I really wanted to make Chocolate Gravy for my new daughter-in-law and couldn't reach my mom or my aunt for their recipe.  This was PERFECT!  The gravy was delicious, easy, and very authentic.  I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup to better suit my tastes.  It was a HUGE hit.  Thanks for bringing back an old familiar childhood friend!  Now...if I can just find a recipe for fried biscuits.....

Shortly after moving to the South in the 6th grade I became friends with a girl who had family "in the country".  Whenever I spent the night at her house her mom would make chocolate gravy and biscuits.   It was the most delicious breakfast, but I never got the recipe so that my mom could make it.   Now, decades later I have been transported back to those memorable meals with your recipe which tastes just like I remember!  Thanks!

I make breakfast gravy a lot, and I've been looking for a good chocolate gravy recipe for a long time.  THIS IS IT!  My kids love it.  I'll have to try it over my homemade biscuits next time. I've also forwarded it to my mom, who used to eat chocolate gravy as a child.  Thanks for a great recipe.

Delicious! This recipe is perfect as is. For anyone "increasing" the butter to 5 tablespoons as suggested in one of the reviews, the recipe calls for 1/2 cup (not 1/2 stick) which is 8 tablespoons so you'd actually be decreasing the butter ;). Stick to the recipe, you won't be disappointed!

Awesome!! These taste just like my grandma's chocolate gravy. I love making this recipe. The only thing I do differently is add a little vanilla at the end of cooking because that's what my grandma used to do.

REVIEW UPDATE:  I first tried this recipe in 2014.  It is now 2018 and I've made it too many times to count.  I follow it faithfully each time with no deviation and it comes out PERFECT.  It's absolutely the BEST chocolate gravy recipe I've ever tried.  A word of encouragement would be to keep stirring.  You may feel like it's taking forever for your concoction to thicken, but that's completely normal for this recipe.  All of a sudden--when you are really thinking it's not going to work out--it will thicken right up for you.

Wonderful recipe I would recommend it for anyone. Love it.  Only thing I did different is put 3 table spoons of cocoa instead of four. Tastes a little bit bitter with four.

I had never heard of Chocolate Gravy before finding the recipe on this site, but this Yankee absolutely loved it!  I added it to drop biscuits and a side of bacon - yum!  Absolute comfort food...

Recipe came out really thick. So much so that I found my 3yr old eating it with a spoon.  It did taste good on a big slice of Panetone.  I took the advice of other reviews and only added 1/2 cup sugar.  Will tweak and try again.

My mom used to make this gravy for me when I was younger, I never learned how to make it and she had a stroke about 5 years ago so I thought I missed my chance. I made it for the first time yesterday using this recipe and it was so great everyone asked for it again today! I took a plate over to my mom and she loved it! She said it tasted just like hers! This will continue to be my go to recipe when the family wants a sweet treat for breakfast!!

Personally I didn't feel this recipe lived up to its ratings.  It was okay, but it was so much like a pudding (only not as good), that I would just go ahead and make the pudding.    I followed the recipe exactly, and used good Ghiardelli cocoa powder, but thought it was lacking something.  If I ever make it again I would add vanilla to see if that helped.  Unfortunately this is not a keeper for me.

I've never heard of Chocolate Gravy until I came across this recipe. It's actually quite tasty! It has a nice cocoa flavor. We served it over pancakes and later added a tablespoon or more to a glass of milk for some excellent chocolate milk! :)

My dear grandmother has long passed away. We, as children would ask for this when visiting her. We loved it over her hot, tender, & buttery biscuits. I know make it for my grandson when he visits me. He likes it on hot pancakes. I never did get the hang of making her wonderful biscuits. BUT, I *can* make this! Thanks for the memories.

I'll admit, I have never had chocolate gravy before.  I really didn't know what to expect.  I was hoping for something along the lines of chocolate sauce, only thicker.  This was like home made pudding with a slightly rough texture.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  If I were to make it again, I would add more milk.  It was pretty thick.  I'm sure it was a good example of chocolate gravy but I didn't like it.  I wish I had had it before so I would have something to compare it to.

Made this for Saturday morning breakfast with my three kids- 6, 4, and 1 1/2. They all LOVED it and thought it was a very special old-fashioned treat. My 6 year old had thirds. I cut the recipe in half and it was plenty for the kids and me. When halving the recipe, I cut the sugar to 1/4 cup and it was plenty sweet for us against the saltiness of the biscuits. I think the kids will be requesting this for years.

My Grandmother made this for me all of the time.  This tastes just like hers!  
I did reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup and added a dash of salt.  
A wonderful, wonderful recipe.  Try this one, you will not be disappointed!  :)

I made this for my husband on Christmas Eve and he loved it! He is on a low sodium diet, so I substituted salt free butter and fat free milk b/c of the low sodium, but it still came out awesome! I can see why this is a favorite.

Because I don't use whole milk, I reduced milk to 1 1/2 cups milk, added 1/2 cup evaporated milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract.  Bring to a slight boil to help the thicking proceedure.  Don't need much over each biscuit.  Will also be good over pancakes.  YUM-O.

Never heard of choclate gravy before and am always looking for a new way to eat something sweet!  I halved the recipe and cut back on the sugar and cinnamon. I like the gravy a little thinner so I added more milk.  I also took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed the flour and chocolate together first AND the sugar and milk together before adding to the pan (to prevent tiny lumps).  This would be great served over french toast.

I wish I had more stars to give!!!  I wnt in search of my Grandma Zagarri's chocolate pie recipe and was terribly discouraged until I remebered that it was simply a thickened version of her chocolate gravy.  To make this ino a chocolate pie, simply increase the flour to a heaping 1/4 cup ad decrease the milk by about a 1/2 cup.  (Grandma never was an exact measurer and neither am I.)  Stir continuously over heat until a thick pudding consistency is reached.  When chilled this pie will set beautifully. Don't cook as long and you have a great pudding.  Trust me.  You can't go wrong with this one!  Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you!

My kids had never eaten chocolate gravy with biscuits before but had heard of it and been asking me to make it. I searched for a good recipe and found yours. I followed your directions exactly and this turned out just perfect. My kids loved it and have been asking for it again! Thanks for sharing, I will be keeping this recipe and making it a lot I'm sure.

My husband thought his grandma was the only one that knew how to make chocolate gravy and she didn't pass it down, so when I told him I had the recipe he couldn't believe it. I made it for him and my kids and they absolutely loved it!!! Now he wants me to make it every weekend!!!!

And here I thought my Nana was the only one that knew how to make this.  My favorite......my recipe has 1/2c sugar and 1/4c butter plus 1/2t vanilla.  I like it better - but this one is still good.  We pour it over buttered Buttermilk biscuits that have been torn into pieces.  Just what I grew up with.  I like it thick but my cousin likes is thin - that was always a battle when we were younger.

delicious!! even if you fear it might be too thin, take care not to let it thicken TOO much on the stove, bc it will continue to thicken as it cools

I gave this 4 stars just because it's fairly easy to make... as for the taste, my 5 year old wouldn't touch it and my 21 month old just played in it.  I liked it okay, but I won't make it again... sorry :(

Served this with J.P.'s Big Daddy Biscuits for my boyfriend's birthday breakfast.  While I was cooking it it looked kind of gross after adding the milk, but all of sudden as it got thick and chocolatey, smooth and shiny.  It has the consistency of pudding.  I'm not sure if I bought unsweetened cocoa, but it was all they had in the baking aisle, and I think I'm going to go easy on the white sugar next time.  No problems with burning - if it burns for you it is the butter, so keep it med-low.  The flour needs to be cooked otherwise you will have the uncooked flour taste - blegh!  I got kisses for how great the gravy was before he was even done eating, so THANKS!!!!

This was perfect. Kid and adult approved! The only change I made was in the preparation-wisk all dry ingredients in a bowl first then add it to the butter in the skillet and then the milk.  Keeps it nice and smooth.

I followed the suggestions of upping the butter and lowering the sugar, and was very happy with the results. Made a double batch for a family breakfast (worked out well) and made several folks very happy!  I had planned to add vanilla but forgot, and I'm the only one who missed it.  I think mine was actually tastier than my mother-in-laws version.

This is a kid favorite (Obviously) and smothers a biscuit perfectly. We usually have leftovers for a family of four so if you don’t want leftovers, cut it in half and you’ll still have plenty. I use 2% milk so it takes a bit to thicken up on med low heat but we love it and make it all the time.

This is the best chocolate gravy I've ever had! Even my mom who's never had chocolate gravy before and doesn't have much of a sweet tooth loved it. I did add about 2 spoonfuls less sugar and added a few splashes of vanilla and ate it hot over J.P.'s biscuits which is another recipe i found on allrecipes and I will definitely be making this again!

This is the chocolate gravy my grandma used to make (or as close as I can get) for myself & my cousins when we would spend the nigh at her house. I make this recipe every Christmas morning for our family breakfast. It's like Nanny is with us.

This recipe did not go as directed.  I followed recipe exactly and the butter/flour/cocoa mixture did not thicken to a paste.  It just boiled and boiled until I could smell burnt butter.  I quickly added extra flour and then it thickened.  A general roux calls for much more flour for so much butter, so that is where the problem came into play I am sure.  The flavor was pretty bland, I am not sure about how to spruce it up.  If I make it again I will start with a general roux and not pay attention to the amounts directed in this recipe.  Might try adding salt and vanilla for the flavor aspect.

This was really easy to make but it was just like chocolate fondue but thicker.  We have a bunch left over. Tried it on biscuits and it was a bit heavy.  Hoping we can find something to put it on or the whole thing will go to waste.

my daughter has been asking me to make chocolate gravy for over a year after eating it at a sleepover. no one really wanted to try it because it sounds a bit strange, but I finally made it for Christmas breakfast & it was great! This recipe is so easy and makes a good bit. I made homemade biscuitS & we ate them topped with the chocolate gravy & it was surprisingly good. Thanks!

I'm sorry, this isn't our kind of chocolate gravy. #1 way to much butter, it was almost greasy. #2 3/4 c of sugar was way to much sweet ( I only used 1/2 c and it was more than plenty sweet). #3 it just wasn't chocolaty enough for us.

I cut the sugar a bit.  I've also used this recipe for pie by reducing the milk a bit and pouring into a pie shell.  My kids and I love this recipe! I serve over homemade buttermilk biscuits

Never heard of chocolate gravy until today. Thought it would be great since the ratings are so high. My family did not like this at all. It was like a thick chocolate pudding that had a very bland taste. I followed the recipe and added vanilla like some suggested. To us, it wasn't sweet at all.

I tried making chocolate gravy for the first time this morning.  Great recipe.  My husband won't eat chocolate gravy, so I halved the recipe.  The recalculated recipe called for 1/4c and 2 TBL of sugar, I only used 1/4c and left out the 2 TBL and it was plenty sweet.  Tasty!

The recipe that I have always used contains eggs, so it's a bit more full-flavored. You can't beat this one for speed and ease, though.

I haven't had chocolate gravy since my great grandmother used to make it when I was a little girl. I followed the recipe to the tee, considering I've never had any success with gravy before. It was perfect!! It tasted just like I remember grandma's tasted. Thanks so much!

Until now I'd only had chocolate gravy twice in my life: once growning up when a friend's mom made it for us, and then once when a distant cousin made it during a family reunion.  He said my great-grandmother made it all the time.  She died when I was two but his version was yummy.  This tastes just like it!  Thanks so much!

I made this yesterday to try, as my brother's gf swears by it.  I liked it, and the kids loved it, but my husband not so much.  Followed the recipe to the letter, and it thickened up exactly like normal breakfast gravy, so I think the amounts are spot on... it's just not something we'll be eating on a regular basis.

I really enjoyed this recipe and it was a huge hit for my family too.  It's extremely easy to make and tastes great on biscuits and cake.  It had a great consistency, almost like gravy.  I'll certainly be making this regularly!

This was fantastic! My husband's grandmother made chocolate gravy, and I had no clue how. Found this, tweaked it a tiny bit, and he raved over it! I added one extra tablespoon of butter and one extra tablespoon of cocoa. It is wonderful... I see why he missed it so much!

This is a great recipe... but just a little sweet for my taste.  I agree with some of the other viewers, reduce the amount of sugar to 1/2 cup and add an extra 2 or so tablespoons of butter.

I grew up with my grandmother making homemade biscuits and chocolate gravy.  Most people I know have never heard of it.  This is the closest I have found to her recipe.  My grandmother is 92 and is not able to cook anymore.  Now that I have found this recipe I can think of Saturday mornings at my grandparents when I make it for my girls!

I remember having biscuits and chocolate gravy at a neighbors' house when I was a little girl.  I loved it then and wanted to make it for my family now.  This recipe seems identical to what I remember as a child.  My kids LOVED it!  I think this recipe is here to stay.  :-)

I have been planning to make chocolate gravy for a long time now, and it's thanks to this easy recipe that I finally convinced myself to do so. This decision was not in vain thankfully, because the gravy was delicious. There is enough chocolate to create an effect while still holding the gravy's traditional flavor. This is certainly a keeper!

I found that if I add a dash of salt to the dry ingredients (cocoa, sugar, flour) then add milk and mix with wire whisk, turn heat to medium and cook till bubbly and add butter and a teaspoon of vanilla..... it is excellent.  My husband likes his over biscuits with a bit of cream.

Delicious! I had a brunch for some of the girls I'm in college with, and this gravy was a hit! I was concerned when it seemed water but I just kept stirring it, and it thickened to a PERFECT consistancy.

This was just not as good as I've had in the past.  It was really dark for chocolate gravy.  I'd probably be rating it higher if I had never tried chocolate gravy before.

This recipe is perfect! I finally get to share this with my two young children.I have had dreams of this dish since my childhood. The recipe (I thought) had died with an old family friend. Numerous attempts to recreate on my own were disasterous. No one I knew had ever heard of it and thought it sounded horrible. I always double the recipe as it warms up well in the microwave on medium power and is a great hot and quick breakfast. My boys request it ALL the time. I limit it to special occasions, though, as it is not very nutritious.. but it sure is gooooood! If you've never tried it, don't let appearances fool you. It does make an excellent cold or warm pudding, too, as someone else mentioned. Thank you a million times for bringing back such a fantastic memory.

Delicious!  Just like Mamaw made on Saturday mornings.  Be patient, take a while to thicken, but worth the wait.    Can't beat it over hot biscuits.  A Southern tradition!

As a young girl my sisters and some cousins never liked the taste of fresh cows milk. So our grandmother would use chocolate syrup. But I remember most she always fixed us chocolate gravy to. I have ask my aunts for the recipe, but none knew how she maded it. So I'm glad I found this for my grandkids to try.

It was good, but a little to rich for my tastes. It was also too pudding like. My grandma used to make it, but it was different from this. It would probably do better for icecream than biscuits.

Great recipe and the kids loved it!  I thought I may have made a mistake because it took almost 5 minutes for the finished product to thicken up, but it was well worth it in the end.  Also, I substituted half of the sugar for splenda and it worked perfectly.  Thank you, Mary Ann!

Mine came out a little lumpy, but it tasted great.  I served it on pancakes, and my 18-month old ate two!  She never eats more than two bites of anything.  I will make this again and try to figure out what I did wrong the first time, as I didn't read of anyone else having problems with lumps.

When i was a kid, my mom made this all the time. I tried several times to get the recipe from her but she always did it without a recipe. This recipe is GREAT!! I love it. It reminds me of when I was a kid!
