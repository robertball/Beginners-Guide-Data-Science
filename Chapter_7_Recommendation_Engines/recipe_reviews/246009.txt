I made these tonight and followed the recipe to a T.  I did have issues getting the dough to spread evenly buy I think that was my failure by allowing the dough to sit out too long before attempting to roll it.
I personally would have preferred a tad more flavor so next time may try garlic salt instead of garlic powder but otherwise a very good recipe. 
Thanks for sharing!

It was delicious. I did use thawed from frozen pizza dough because I don’t like the one in the can but that was my only substitution. Also baked on a pizza stone which was a mistake because the oils from the cheese dripped down into the oven. Didn’t think that one through. Next time will definitely use a pan, and there will definitely be a next time.

First off Loved it! But having worked in the Pizza industry there is no way they put that much cheese in it lol. But I am Not the cheese Police. Made twice now, love it. However I would recommend spreading out some flour before laying down your dough, FYI I used a Wal Mart pizza a dough in a tube, loved it both times, just next time I will be spreading some flour.

Bread was very hard to roll out and made the dish have a preservative flavor.   May try again with homemade or different brand of bread dough.  Otherwise it came out good.

It was difficult to make. The dough didn't roll out very easy. When I was ready to fold over dough after adding cheese it got stauck to my counter and I had to use a spatula to scrap it off and slopily put it on the baking sheet. The flavor was ok. Nothing special. I will just stick with Dominos to make these.
