I made this with my sisters and they loved it! I didn't have butter so I had to used 6 tablespoons margarine before it would work. Tasted great and was fairly easy to make.

This was a hit at our Halloween party, but I prefer regular Rice Krispie treats over the chocolate flavor.

This was a cute treat for a Halloween party.  I added 1/2 cup of peanut butter after everyone raved over the Rice Krispie mini footballs that I brought to a superbowl party.
