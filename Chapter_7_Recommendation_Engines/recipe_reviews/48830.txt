This has been made in my family for generations.  However, we use shredded Velveeta rather than cheddar, and they are delcious!

Reminded me of Hawaiian Sloppy Joes without any flavor!  Nobody else liked them and I was embarrased to serve them.

We love Pizza Burgers! My mom made them when I was little and now I make them for my two sons (ages 3 & 1).  They eat them right up! This is a great 'quick & easy' lunch idea!

Sodium content is high. I even used the lowest sodium Spam I could find along with a low sodium chili.

This is a good recipe but the salt content is high, almost 1700 mg. I might suggest using sodium free spam and lower sodium chili. Except for the saltiness, it was good.
