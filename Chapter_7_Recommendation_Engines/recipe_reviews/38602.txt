I made this as described but did not pre melt the marshmallows.  I just stired them into the hot liquid and they melted away.

I loved this recipe because I have always been trying to make marshmallow topping for ice cream and had never figured out how to do it.  I love marshmallow flavor so that is why I liked it so much.  I probably would not add vanilla next time as it turned the color to a beige.  It is a little stringy when cold, but I found if I heated it in the microwave for a few seconds it was easier to put over the ice cream. Thanks

I have been looking for a marshmallow topping for years.  I have tried many recipes but this is, by far, the best! This recipe brought back fond memories of going with my Dad to Bailey's Ice Cream Shop in Boston for a hot fudge sundae dripping with marshmallow sauce running down the sides of the bowl onto a plate.  Fantastic!

This was very simple, and agreed, its very tasty. Also agree that marshmallows don't need to be chopped or pre melted; however, with that being said, this is not a good marshmallow topping for ice cream. It would be great for cakes, sweet potatoes, or other desserts, but not for ice cream. It gets stringy and chewy when it hits the cold ice cream... not what a good topping should do. So for that reason, because its listed as an ice cream topping recipe, I have to give it only two stars.

Hi! I tried this recipe not to top an ice cream but to top a fruit pizza. This is a nice alternative to a marshmallow creme if this is not available. It blends well with cream cheese. Thanks.

Better than the store bought fluff. I used this to top the too much chocolate cake from this site.

This was my first time making marshmallow sauce, so I may have done something wrong.  Mine came out yummy - but a pale shade of caramel, not white.  The syrup turned lt.brown while cooking.  Is this the way it's supposed to be?  I've made simple syrup before, but never with milk added.  Still very good though!

In the five minute simmer time you should stir constantly or reduce the amount of time you simmer. My sauce began to stick to the pan and created flecks of caramel in the sauce. I also didn't bother to melt the marshmallows separately since the sauce and pan was plenty warm enough to melth them until smooth.

a total disappointment..this is NOT an icecream sauce. As others have said, it solisifies into glue when it hits the cold icecream, plus leftovers separate.    very much "not as described" and a shame!

Made (2)  1/2 recipes.  Used plain fluff and strawberry fluff (7.5 Oz) and the 1/2 recipe fit perfectly in a condiment bottle.  Perfect for a potluck ice cream social!!
