These mini muffins do remind me of tea cakes. They are dense and heavy but not dry. I halved the recipe and still got 36 mini muffins. The icing was also more than enough and I was able to 'double-dip' the little cakes. They are not the prettiest I have seen but they are tasty, easy and quick to make.
