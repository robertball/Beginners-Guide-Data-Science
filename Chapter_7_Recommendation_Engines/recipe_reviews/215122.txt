I'm sorry to have to rate a recipe so low, but these were actually inedible. There has to be ingredients missing from the recipe. There is no sweetener, nor anything other than water to add moisture to the recipe.  They were very dry and bitter, and only tasting strongly of molasses. I had doubts as I was mixing these up, and was sorely tempted to add at least some sugar or honey, but gave benefit to the recipe. Again, I have to wonder if ingredients were omitted by mistake.

I just made these muffins.  They taste great in a bite with plums, and my kids loved them.  However, the batter is so thick that it's difficult to get it to spread in the muffin pans, and they did not rise at all.  Very dry too. I will make them again, but I may soak the oats in the plum/water/molasses mixture first, and/or add applesauce to make them a little moister.

Because I had no muffin tins available to make this recipe  I decided to prepare it in a square dish instead. This proved to be beneficial for the recipe in that it allowed it to hold some more moisture. I covered the dish while it was cooling and spread some butter on it when I served it. This improved the overall flavor too. Though it is not a recipe I will use again as it is, I have come up with some ideas on altering this recipe that I will be sharing in the future.

Have to agree with the previous reviews - this muffin is quite dense, heavy and dry.  The kind of thing that turns people off of "healthy".  That said, I used fairly tart plums, which I like, and the taste was better than the texture.
