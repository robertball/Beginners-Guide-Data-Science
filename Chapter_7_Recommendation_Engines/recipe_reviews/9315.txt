great cookies! I had too make up most of it because i used maple syrup unstead of sugar but they turned out great! As for them being deflated, one cut them thicker and 2 let them sit for a few min before eating, these have amazing taste thanks!

The dough was marvelous - I'm sure at least a dozen cookies worth of dough ended up in my stomach - but the resulting cookies were deflated and underwhelming.  Maybe she meant Baking POWDER instead of baking SODA?  Maybe she meant 18 minutes instead of 8?  Who knows.  Needs some tinkering.

I wanted to try something different for my Christmas cookies. These sounded good and taste great. BUT they didn't firm up in the refrigerator and it took more like 5 1/2 cups of flour. And I agree with the person who said maybe it should be baking powder rather than baking soda. I tried thicker cooking them less....everywhich way just didn't work.

Excellent recipe that was easy to make. Instead of putting one teaspoon of each spice I put four teaspoons of all spice. Also I tryed a few with and with out icing and I definately think they need a simple Luke warm water and icing sugar icing make them perfect.

Every year i try a few new cookie recipes, but it takes a really special cookie to get on my list of "regulars". This cookie made it not just for its wonderfully zingy spiciness but for its ability to stay chewy all through the season Great recipe!

These are great! My boyfriend loved them! Perhaps next time I'll use less molasses and see how it turns out because I felt that the taste was a bit too strong. After a few days it did taste better though.. These are very nice cookies! (:

These are a tasty cookie.  They use a ton of molasses, though!  I think the only thing I will do different if I make them again is roll them out a lot thicker, and cook them less.  They were a bit on the crispy side this time!

A very similar recipe has been a holiday tradition in my family since at least the 1920's. The only difference is the use of Cane Syrup instead of the molasses. It has a milder molasses like taste and lets the spice come through on its own. Thanks so much for sharing this!

Great taste!  They don't bake very well though so I suggest making them a little thicker and leaving in the oven a couple of minutes longer.  All in all they have an awesome taste that can't be resisted!  I sprinkled some white sugar on top after baking for a little added sweetness, but they were fine without it as well.
