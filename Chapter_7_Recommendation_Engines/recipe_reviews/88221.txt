This is an amazing new flavor. Plan this to be among other dishes at a party a bit strong for eating more than a few bites. Idea for easier prep: Spread cream cheese and garlic mixture on a plate and once the "sauce" has thickened spread over cream cheese. If you choose to do this think about using a dish with a rim so it can be covered with plastic wrap (otherwise as I learned the wrap stuck to the topping)

This was a very good cheeseball but I used 2 blocks of cream cheese because the amount of garlic that the recipe calls for is just too much. Also this cheeseball was much better served at room temperature instead of right out of the fridge.

Based on previous reviews I used fresh minced garlic and only used one small clove. I also used only 1/2 tsp. worcestershire in the topping. I served this in mini parmesan cups as a base for an appetizer with shredded roasted pork. Layered the cream cheese mixture pork topping. It was really good but be sure to reduce the amount of garlic if you make this!

A hit for sure! I first encountered this cheeseball at a good friends family gathering...they call it "the bomb". Good with or without pecan. A easy recipe to play around with ingredient wise. Can even add abit of heat(spice) to the cheese mixture. Fresh garlic and a bit of salt in the cheese is good too. All in all it is very good just made the way described in this recipe and yes everyone(except those who hate garlic) will love it!

This is a great cheese ball! I was a little worried when I read the ingredients but I believe anything made with brown sugar can't be too bad so I took a chance. I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and put less garlic powder in and it came out fabulous. Great recipe!

I generally love savory/sweet flavors together but this didn't turn out so great. It sounded like it would work well together but the garlic was waaayyy too strong - and I'm a garlic lover. And the worcestershire in the sugar/butter/nut mixture threw the whole thing off in my opinion. I'm keeping this cheese ball though as I think I can use it to make a sort of sauce for chicken or pork...can't see wasting it. I may try making it again - but reduce the amount of garlic powder drastically and omit the worcestershire all together.

If people say what an odd combination they are right. Still somehow it works. Folks either liked it a lot or thought it was "different but tasty".

Exquisite! This was a big hit at my party everyone loved it! The flavor combinations sounded strange but were incredible together. I should have made another one for my family alone. Thanks!!

This is a very good recipe except that I will lessen the garlic just a tad. Still my family enjoyed the unique flavors.

I have been making this recipe for years now and has been a hit wherever I take it. I don't put in quite as much garlic only a few shakes and only a few drops of worcestershire sauce as well. Chopped walnuts are okay instead of pecans. My recipes also calls for 1 tsp of prepared mustard.

This is seriously SOO good! I could not stop eating it. I am definitely going to be using this around the holidays! I didn't have the Pecans on hand and it was great without them but I an imagine how it would be even better with them. Toasting the pecans might be a an added touch. Thank you so much for this recipe I am OBSESSED! =D

Amazingly good. Make this into the shape of a wheel about one inch thick with a one inch hole in the center. This allows every scoop to have some of the sauce. You won't see the hole in the center after pouring on the thick sauce but you will get sauce with the cream cheese from the middle other wise you just get only cream cheese bite. I recommend making an additional half recipe more of the sauce. I only use 1 tsp garlic powder and half the Worcester. Try it you will love it!

Just tried this tonight with half the garlic only I mixed the sauce right into the cream cheese mixture. It is unusual but delicious! Also when you consider what goes into barbecue sauces the ingredients really make sense. Thanks for a great simple recipe!

I say 5 stars but it's 5 stars for my version of the recipe. I mince 2 cloves of fresh garlic and mix it with the cream cheese. I roll it into a ball and then roll the ball in a generous amount of chopped pecans. Chill for at least 2 hours. The caramel sauce is just the butter and brown sugar and I triple the amount. No worcestershire sauce!

Everyone raved over this! I can only give it 4 stars though b/c the garlic was just way too much and also after refrigerating the brown sugar mixture for an hour it was impossible to spread it on the cheese ball...so I had to warm it up a bit again to spread it on...This was a great combo of flavors and I will def be making this again (w/ less garlic powder lol)! Thanks for sharing.:)

"I could eat this until I die." That direct quote from of the guys I served this to pretty much sums up our feelings about this cheese ball. It works; it really works. It sounds strange I get it but step outside your comfort zone and give this a whirl; you won't be disappointed! This WILL become a staple on our entertaining snack menu...

Delicious! We love garlic so the amount of garlic powder worked great for us. It seemed to grow on everybody. They were rather hesitant at tasting it then kept coming back for more!
