I had a 16-oz bag of broccoli slaw on hand, so I used that in place of the 2 heads of broccoli and half head of cabbage, which saved a LOT of time.  Then I halved all the other ingredients, and that worked out very well. Also, I substituted Craisins for the grapes.  To help make it a little healthier, I used Smart Balance mayo.  My husband thought it was a great salad!  I would make it again and consider taking it to a pot-luck picnic.

My family loves all kinds of coleslaw - creamy, oily, vinegar base, mayo base.....and this one.  This is such a change from others that I have tried.  To save time I used bagged cabbage and bought broccoli slaw instead of cutting broccoli heads in to thin strips.  The addition of the spinach and grapes was very noticeable in this salad we really it.  I mixed it up in the morning and it was well blended by dinner time.  I liked that the spinach wilted down in the dressing.  I served this with 'Onion and Sausage Pizza' from AR and we had a delicious meal.

Loved this! I used Broccoli Slaw in a 16oz bag, Craisins and pomegranate seeds for color and sweetness, otherwise I made it according to the recipe.

I made a slightly different version of this recipe and we very much enjoyed it.  I made the dressing using apple cider vinegar and I used broccoli slaw, instead of cabbage and broccoli.  I didnâ€™t have fresh spinach, so I had to leave that out.  We loved the grapes in this, and although my version made a large batch, all the leftovers were consumed over the next two days!  Very tasty!
