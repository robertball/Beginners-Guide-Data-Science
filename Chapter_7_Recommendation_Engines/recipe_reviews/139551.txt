Oh, the incredible edible egg! Don't be afraid to microwave the egg, it really is good. If you spray the bowl with some Pam first, the egg will slide right out and you won't have that cooked on egg that is impossible to scrub off your dishes. I only microwave one egg at about 45 seconds and then top it with cheese and microwave it for the last 15 seconds. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and viola. This is so versatile too. You can add bacon, sausage, ham, tomato, etc. And you can use any bread you have (sandwich, hamburger roll, English muffin, croissant, etc.) and it turns out great every time! So easy a man, I mean the kids could do it!

I had very little time this morning to make breakfast for the kids. This worked out great as my oldest boy could do this pretty much by the directions. I had one of those microwave omelette pans (which asks for two eggs, wisked, to be poured on each side). All he did was add salt and pepper to each wisked egg and cook it in the microwave omelette pan. Then, he cut it in half to make two sandwiches. Good for them, GREAT for me. NOTE: You might want to keep in mind that you may need to spritz your microwaveable container with non-stick spray before you cook your egg. Having made egg in the microwave before, they do tend to want to stick pretty bad if you don't.

Sort of like a home-made Egg McMuffin. It's pretty bland, though. It will be better with some bacon or ham on it. I would recommend trying to toast this in the oven since the bottom piece of toast got soggy while microwaving to melt the cheese. Good base since it was so simple. I'll make it again, but with my own adjustments.

Pretty good - watch your egg timing though...my first one blew up in the microwave. I used a toasted English muffin and added some bacon. YUM!

ADDED TIP:  In my last review, I forgot to mention that I use round cookie cutters to cook the eggs in.  Whether I cook them in a skillet or the microwave (scrambled or just cooked whole, and breaking the yoke), make sure the skillet (or the microwave safe dinner plate is liberally sprayed with butter-flavored Pam, as well as the inside of the cookie cutters.  Either way, the eggs cook up pretty quickly, so be careful that the bottoms don't scorch.  When one side is cooked, carefully turn the eggs over, remove cookie cuters (they should slide off easily), and finish cooking the other side, if need be.  Perfect sized eggs for an English muffin!  I bought my cookie cutters at K- Mart about ten years ago, but I'm sure you can still find them there, or maybe at WalMart's.

I do this everyday; one or two eggs with spinach and zucchini, ham or roast beef ( for that steak and egg taste) I use an old glassbake chili bowl to cook mine in, cover your egg or it will explode. when it is done I toss cheese on it recover and let it melt as I am waiting for my coffee. depending on what you cover your eggs with it will puff up

One egg on a sandwich isn't enough for me, I had to double.  I didn't microwave it either.  The egg and toast were hot enough to melt the cheese just fine.

This deserves a big 5 for the ease and speed of making this sandwich! I, however, like to put mayo on my egg sandwiches and I found this to be a little dry for me. Other than that it was great! Cleanup was even a breeze! Will have to do this one again and again for sure!

I do something like this myself - I generally just pierce the yolk instead of scrambling.  One tip on the cheese-melting:  If you have a toaster-oven, you can set it on 'Broil' and stick the bottom half of the sandwich (1 pc. toast, egg, slice of cheese) in the little pan and let it cook for 1-2 minutes.  No soggy bread!

Personally, I like seeing recipes like this.  They remind me of things I have not made in awhile.  I like reading how people changed things according to their families tastes, gives me new ideas.  Slamming a recipe because you think it's too simple is just wrong!  Didn't your mama's teach you any manners?  Sometimes simple is the best.

Easy to make, even easier to clean up.  Perfect for when you're feeling lazy or of you're low on time.  But the bread did get soggy when microwaving it to melt the cheese.  I would try toasting it if you have the time.  Also, I had to sauce it up - I just didn't nuke the top piece of bread with the rest.

How my daughter showed me to do this is...use a small bowl or a microwave egg cooker (WalMart) , spray it with Pam , beat 1 egg in the bowl or cooker your going to cook it in, pop it in the microwave for exactly 1 minute. while this is cooking pop either a muffin or toast in the toaster. Turn the egg out of the bowl onto the toast add a piece of cheese and/or cooked bacon....put the top on and ....perfect! No soggy toast and no need to return to microwave. So easy the kids can do it.

I've been making micro-eggs for many years. Spray a large coffee mug with no-stick and add eggs. I use Egg Beaters instead of real eggs. I also dice a wedge of light Laughing Cow cheese in the mug before cooking. My microwave is 1100 watts and I cook it on high for 1 min. 45 seconds. Easy, quick and delicious.

We use empty Smart Balance containers to cook the egg in the microwave.   When the butter substitute is down to just a little around the edges,  crack the egg, or 2, a tiny splash of milk, scramble. Bake in microwave for 1-2 +- minutes steering once in middle of cooking time. When finished, place cheese on top and cover with container cover, waiting a minute or so, the cheese melts quickly.  Then remove cover, place toast on top turn over quickly. The egg falls right out on the toast, centered on the toast, cheese melted and ready to eat. If you need to use the container again, spread a little smart balance around in the container and use again.

I thought this was dry and a little bland.  Next time I will try adding some spices and maybe a little low fat butter.  I had never microwaved an egg but it turned out perfect.

Good base recipe, but as others have said, very bland as is.  I chop up 1 cooked, veggie sausage patty then mix it in with the egg mixture then microwave it.  After topping the mixture on the bread, pop it back in the toaster oven for a few seconds for cheese to melt.  I sometimes also add a few drops of hot sauce on top before eating, pretty tasty this way.

Ok, this is pretty cool. I have never cooked an egg in the microwave before. While this is not a super flavorful meal (what do you expect, it's egg and cheese), it has potential to be whatever you want it to be. I took the suggestion of someone else after taking a bite, and threw a dab of light mayo on there for flavor. Also, I used cooking spray on the bowl (covered loosely) before putting the egg in there- didn't stick at all. The flavor all depends on what kind of cheese you use, spices, add-ons such as pepper, bacon, etc. This is easy, fast, cheap and has potential. Oh, and my toddler liked it too. Thanks!

I love the idea of microwaving your eggs! :) 1.) One egg was plenty for me. The egg will expand more in the microwave if you use the milk than it will in a pan over the stove.
 
2.)Definitely spritz or rub your bowl with a little EVOO or nonstick spray. 

3.)I add and melt the cheese in the last 15 second interval of the microwaving process. I focus more on putting the cheese a few cms from the inside of the bowl, even with nonstick spray, the cheese still loves to stick to the bowl and is hard to scrub off.

4.) Experiment with your microwave to find your desired cooking time. 

5.)I've made this a few times, and have to say the original recipe does yield "bland" results. I like to think of this recipe more as a technique, than a recipe. Or just a BASE recipe. There are MANY ways you can spice this up! Several people have suggested bacon and other various meats.. I have yet to try the bacon, but I will next time. My boyfriend loves to eat these with ketchup, I prefer to add some garlic powder to the mixture, use a reduced fat mexican cheese blend, wrap the egg in a tortilla and serve with a little salsa or picante.. and maybe a little dollop of fat-free sour cream!

Microwaves are made to defrost food. Fry the egg in butter with some salt and pepper on it. Flip the egg and put a piece of cheese on it if you want. The best part of the egg being cooked in butter is obvious, it ends up tasting yummy and like an egg should tast.

I've been doing this for years.  My family calls it a McDonna!   I use egg whites and add hot pepper cheese.    Don't forget to  microwave two pieces of turkey bacon to add to the sandwich.  Yummy!

My family make this reularily for a quick meal. Too me microwaving toast, even for 10 seconds, makes it soggy. If the eggs and toast are hot enough, that should melt the cheese enough on it own.

This is a nice quick meal for anyone with a bare fridge, a college student, or a midnight snack. Salt and pepper is a must - I used seasoned salt (garlic flavored) and five grain bread. It was delicious!

Very quick, easy & delish! I don't tend to make eggs in the morning because it's just me at home and a bowl of cereal is quicker....Glad I came across this recipe!

this is actually not bad.
I made it for my little siblings when my mom went somewhere and they both liked it. though the middle aged one didn't liked it as better as my littler one.
overall, it tastes not that bad and I will probably make it again (but with my own adjustments to make taste better.

This was really good! I have been been putting egg and cheese between toast, since I was old enough to reach the stove. I also have made omelets in the microwave that tasted like rubber. This did not! Maybe, it was the milk? I usually add a little ice water to the eggs. I whisked the egg in a bowl, added the milk, and then microwaved uncovered for 1 and a half minutes exactly. The egg made a nice round shape of the bottom of the bowl perfect for the toast size and was also nice and soft. When done I salted the egg lightly on both sides before placing on top of the cheese on the toast. Thank you, I hate cleaning dishes. I will make this again in the future, for sure. I look forward to telling my neice and nephew they can make their own hot breakfast now. ;)

Yummy! I've been making these for years - often I get strange looks when talking about microwaving eggs, but they turn out fantastic. It's a lazy version of scrambled eggs! 

Best thing about these is how versatile the recipe is. I've thrown all kinds of meats and veggies into the eggs and it all turns out fantastic!

My Nana used to make this for me back in the 60's. Since she scrambled eggs the old-fashioned way (on the stove, in a cast iron skillet), she put a slice of Velveeta in the eggs to melt. She also put my sandwich on a small hamburger bun, instead of toast. Topped with ketchup, it was a great meal for a 10-year-old!

I spray the inside of the bowl with a light coating of pam olive oil and it keeps the egg from sticking to the bowl  :)

Also, mayo and/or honey mustard ar great choices to flavor the sandwich.  Yumm!  (but not too much)  :)

This one really gave me a good laugh.  I've been doing this since the microwave was invented.  With me, crunchy toast is a musthave, so I would never put the toast in after toasting.  Simply undercook your egg just a tad and then add your cheese, or just whip them all up together "omelette" style and you're good to go. I make my breakfast burittos this way and the kids love them(which I then place on the tortilla and do a quick 30 seconds in the microwave). Add bacon, ham, sausage or anything else that floats your boat.  A little finely chopped onion and peppers. Limitless.

Ok, this is a really simple recipe, but I thought it was easy & delicious. I like making scrambled eggs without fat, too. When you're hungry & in a hurry, this is perfect - or to grab for breakfast at work.

It's just like a McDonalds breakfast sandwich only using toast, and I make this often for a very quick breakfast. I'll sometimes add a cooked sausage patty or some bacon to the sandwich after the eggs are cooked. I spray the inside of the bowl with some butter flavored cooking spray, mix the egg and milk mixture in it, and then nuke it for about 80-90 seconds (that's all it takes). The egg slides right out without having to use a spoon. I find that if the sandwich is assembled right away, including the cheese, that the cheese melts from the heat of egg and meat (if using) and there is no need to return the sandwich to the microwave.

Not sure if this was mentioned in the reviews yet or not but if you spray the bowl with a little Pam before you crack the egg in it, it will be much easier to clean.

So quick and easy. Definitely needs a generous amount of salt and pepper to ensure it's not bland, but if done right, it tastes great! Good meal for lazy evenings.

Some poeple might turn the nose up at microwaved eggs which I almost did!! But I am glad I got over that. This is sooo fast to make and pretty tasty, great for super busy weekday mornings and a lot cheaper than buying a fast food breakfast sandwich. I will be making this often for breakfast!

I made these this morning for my McDonalds loving husband and kids. They were a hit! I snuck in some thin slices of tomato (under the ketchup they love). I used English muffins toasted first and zapped the egg for just 40 sec, added cheese then 10 more secs. I then made just egg whites and salsa for myself. Fastest hot breakfast ever!

Helpful hints: Bread is square, egg is round. Use spatula to cut egg into four pieces (like big pie helpings).
Then place pieces on one piece of toast so that corners of egg pieces are in corners of toast. It fits! Then add your other stuff, like bacon bits, topped with a Velveeta slice. Say what you like about Velveeta, nothing melts better.
Option two: leave the egg in one round piece, and substitute an English muffin for the bread. If you do this,
fold the corners of the cheese slice in, so it's shaped like a stop sign. Then it fits, too!

Would give this ten stars, if possible. Found the perfect-sized bowl, which makes all the diff. Followed one reviewer's suggestion to micro exactly 90 seconds and Voila! Have added veggies - delish no matter the ingredients or just plain egg. The microed egg is VERY HOT - pop out onto  toast immediately & add the cheese & no extra micro needed. Don't miss this - you'll be hooked like us. THANKS! KrS for sharing.

I scrambled one egg w/seasoning and a touch of milk. Put it in a coffee cup sprayed w/Pam and cooked for 1 min in microwave. It came out fluffy and tasted great. I made the toast in the toaster & added cheese and a piece of bologna that I cooked 1 min in the microwave. Also, added mayo on the bread. Was DELISH and so much easier than scrambling on the stovetop. Thanks for posting.

I made this and it was delicious. Instead of salt and pepper I added a little lemon pepper and garlic powder. Used grated chedar cheese. I only toasted one side of the bread, I added a slice of avocado and had slice tomatoes on the side. I really enjoyed this little Sandwich. I will make this at work to save some money on breakfast.

I have been making egg sandwiches for over 50 years, one of my favorite breakfasts or lunches. I add onion powder when I scramble the eggs. I cook them in a small saute pan that is just the size of a slice of bread. It is just like a Denver Sandwich, you can add ham, green pepper, onion, tomato. I also like a bit of salsa on the finished egg on the toast.

I make this all the time and I can tell you that it takes no longer than 35 seconds, stir, then micro for an additional 25 to 30 seconds. I accidently microed it for 1-1/2 min the other day, and the egg exploded all over the interior of the microwave.  1 to 2 minutes is WAY TOO LONG.

I have been making egg sandwiches this way for years.  I always spray the bowl with cooking spray first so that the egg comes out easily and the bowl cleans up fast.  My variation is that I sometimes will put a slice of meat and the cheese on top of the egg when it has cooked and put it back in the microwave for a few seconds to heat up the meat and melt the cheese.  Then I put it on the toast.

Really fast and easy, but really bland. I personally fry my egg, add oregano, paprika, chopped onion, and whatever else I may have in the fridge with real cheddar cheese on top.

This was almost perfect... Try adding some microwave sausage links on top of it and also (in my opinion) more pepper/salt=better

I made this as a quick and easy dinner.  I cooked the eggs in the skillet on the stove instead of the microwave.  I layed the cheese on top after the eggs were done.  The heat from eggs was enough to melt the cheese.  served with grapes.

I give it 5 stars because it was really quick, tasted great, and really hit the spot.  For all the moms out there if you need a quick breakfast for the kiddos this is a great one especially since it isn't messy!!!

Great base recipe, but I had to do a few changes. For instance, I toasted the bread while the eggs were cooking (sorry one egg is not a serving size to me), and after it was hot enough to melt the cheese. Also I sprayed my cup with no-stick spray, added a pat or so of butter and a teaspoon of Creole seasoning along with fresh pepper, stirred it after 45 seconds. A great base recipe to adjust to your taste.

You saved my mornings!! I was afraid to do this, I mean microwave eggs?! I've never heard of this till today.  I added some bell peppers and onion powder to the eggs before popping into the microwave oven. Then halfway, i decided to add some shredded cheddar cheese and continue microwaving. Ping!! My "scrambled eggs " were ready. Was fast and convenient. Thank God! Less dishes to wash and my stove stays clean.. Woooohooooo!!  Ps: don forget to cover your dish lightly while cooking as the eggs really puffed up while cooking. I thought they were going to explode lol!!

I have done almost the same sandwich using the left over french toast mixture. The presence of vanilla and cinnamon is really great. I top it with shredded cheeese. The kids ask for more!

I have been making sandwiches like this for years. I cook the egg on the stove and then use any bread I have around, putting mayo on the bread before the egg, and adding shredded cheddar cheese. I usually don't toast the bread, since I don't care for toast, but the hot egg is warm enough to melt the cheese. I also add turkey ham slices or bacon sometimes. Delish.

The egg cooked very well. I added butter to the slices of bread and ham. Didn't microwave again for the cheese to melt. It mels a bit with the heat of the egg/bread so there's no need to microwave again. Serve it with a soup to have it complete!

Okay, I read almost everyone else's reviews, and seen most people said the toast got soggy. So what I did, is when im adding the milk and salt and pepper, i just took the cheese and tore it up, and put it in the egg mixture. Me and my brother both agree it tastes great !

When I am only making breakfast for myself it doesn't get any easier than this. If my family was eating they would want bacon. I also put the cheese on toward the end of the toasting. Thanks!

Classic, I use whole wheat toast instead though.  I'll throw in a slice of ham or turkey or chicken (whatever I have at hand) to boost up the protein value.

This really was delicious. Putting it in a bowl is a nice idea, because it is exactly the size of the bread. It saves the hassle of getting a pan out, putting butter/cook spray on it, big mess afterwards,etc. I put some ham in it though, and it was awesome. everyone should defiantely try this!

Super easy! I cooked two eggs in a microwave-safe bowl. In addition to the salt and pepper I added some garlic powder and sriracha sauce. I microwaved the egg for 1 minute, then added a slice of cheddar cheese on top of the egg and microwaved for the additional 15 seconds. Served in a toasted hamburger bun. Will definitely make again - the possible alterations are many (already thinking about adding bell pepper slices, sauteed onion, bacon bits, diced ham/turkey, etc.)

This was amazing! I love how the american cheese melted and the pepper gave it a pop! I used wheat bread because I didn't have white bread at the moment but I would recommend sticking to the white bread.

I do this one regularly and sometimes I'll add a slice of ham or bologna  to make my homemade egg mcmuffin. I know I'm weird but  I like to add a swipe of ketchup on the egg side. Works great on a burger bun too.

This is an easy, quick way to make an egg sandwich. The only problem is if you use a cereal bowl as recommended, the timing is way too long. I cooked mine for only 30 seconds.

This makes a great breakfast sandwich for one person. I do use some of the tips: Definitely use cooking spray in the bowl first; I made these for years and always had to scrape out bits of egg to clean the bowl (Duh moment for me, when I finally read some reviews!); I skip the milk; cover with a paper towel or some plastic wrap as these do pop sometimes. My microwave only takes about 45 seconds, so make sure you don't cook too long and get a rubbery egg. I put the cheese on the cooked egg while I'm toasting the bread; it's nicely melted, and I just slide it from the bowl onto the finished toast, no soggy bottom bread.

Quick & easy to make.  No oil from frying & I can season it as I like.  I usually throw bacon bits in there & throw some monetary jack cheese when the microwave gets to 20 seconds left.  I throw the mix in one of those sandwich holder cases so it shapes out to the bread I throw it on; also helps in removing it by placing the bread on top when done & flipping it (opposed to worrying about a hot plate).

Thank you for giving me the courage to try microwaving an egg!  Because of this post I was able to duplicate (at least to my liking) my favorite breakfast at Denny's. I have been gluten free for about a year so to be able to make this to suit my diet needs was great.  Cheese, ham and scrambled egg (microwaved perfectly at one minute) put it together on a skillet with gluten free bread and voila. I'll have hash browns with it next time now that I know how easy it is!!  I have also never had an egg sandwich with mayo but will try that next. Thanks again!

It's a nice easy sandwich - but don't season your eggs with salt in a liquid state, they will be rubbery when cooked. Also using some grated cheddar cheese (mild) will deliver a better flavor.

So easy and tastes just as good (if not better) than frying the eggs up on the stove. For those saying this recipe is too blah I added some turkey lunch meat and some veggie cream cheese and it came out perfect. My husband prefers mustard on his and said it was the best egg sandwich he has ever had. This is a great base recipe that is easy to add your own spices/sauces to to give it your own personal flair. Enjoy!

Excellent!! I love egg sandwiches but usually fried eggs. This easy very easy and came out perfect. Used a cereal bowl and the egg was exactly the right size so I slid it out onto the bread, added the cheese, back in the microwave and enjoyed.

Maybe it's my microwave, but i've found micriwaving on 70% power, flip, then another 30-45 sec on full power really gets it fluffy, and evenly cooked...It's easy to tweak & find what's best for you...A reminder that simple can still result in fun,quick easy cooking!

I spray butter spray on the dish to remove the egg easier.  I also season the egg with s/p and hot sauce before cooking.  I add jelly to the toast...and sometimes add the cheese..I have this for breakfast nearly every morning
