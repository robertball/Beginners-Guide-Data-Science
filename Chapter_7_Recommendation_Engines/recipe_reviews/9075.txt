I eat sweet potato fries at my favourite restaurant all the time, and while these didn't taste bad, they were not the same as a french fry - so if that's what you're expecting, you probably won't get it with this dish.  I used only two sweet potatoes because there were only two of us, and I used about 2 tbsp of olive oil, salt and pepper (no paprika).  I baked them at 400F, but they were done long before the 40 minute suggested time; it only took about 20 minutes to cook them.

The best way to eat sweet potatoes!  You can use any spices you like.  I usually cut mine into slices as opposed to sticks and I also toss them in a ziploc bag to coat with oil and spices.  Easy, healthy and delicious!!

One word. . .WOW! I have never like sweet potatoes, but my husband and I decided that today, October 1st, we are gonna start working out and eating healthier. So, today, for our first "healthy" meal, I decided to make baked battered fish with sweet potato fries and collard greens. Wow! I didn't think I would like them, but OMG, they were awesome! I actually added a little more to the seasoning in the recipe; garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt and pepper. I will definitely be using this recipe again and recommending it to my friends. Who says eating healthy has to taste bland!

We liked them better when the sticks were cut thinner.  They had a better flavor.  We also cut up a regular baking potato and cooked it with the sweet potato.

Ive tried this recipe before but instead we sprinkled cinnamon sugar on the fries just when you take them out of the oven while they are still hot.

Really yummy and so much better for you than white potatoes. I like to add additional spices as other reviewers have suggested. I use cinnamon sugar on them when I'm serving pork chops. Add a green veggie and baked apples and you've got a delicious, easy autumn meal.

This is fantastic.... Things to note: 1) Slice the sweet potato as thin as you can manage.  Don't do wedges.  I quartered the potato, and then sliced each quarter thin.  2) I only used one potato for the first time. It was gone by the end of the night! 3) The thinner you slice the potatoes, the shorter your cooking time will be.  I went the whole 40 minutes and some of my potatoes were a bit blackened.  HOWEVER, I found the lightly charred flavor to be excellent.  Don't discard those until you try them. 4) I did paprika and salt.  5) I would agree that they're even better at room temperature.

My 11 year old daughter and I make these all the time. We add a liitle sea salt and cracked black pepper too. We spray them with olive oil spray to reduce the fat. We gobble them up in no time.

I love sweet potatoes! They are naturally sweet and good for you. This did not take much effort to cut these up, season with paprika and a little olive oil. I was only serving two people so I had one large yam, cut up into sticks or wedges. I placed the potatoes onto a baking that I lined with aluminum foil. I used my hands to mix the potatoes up to ensure they were evenly oiled. Half way through the baking process I flipped them over to bake the other side. They were done and ready to eat in 40 minutes. We did not need to dip them into ketchup or other dipping sauces because are sweetened up already. No only did everyone love these sweet potatoes but they ate these up so fast right before my eyes! This is a very tasty, naturally sweet side dish that is also healthy for you too. Best thing about this is it did not take me long to make these and they were baked, not deep fried. I served these sides with Seasoned Turkey Burgers.

These cooked just as described, good texture. I added garlic salt and thyme (yes, thyme!)along with a little salt and generous black pepper, as well as the 1/2 tsp paprika. Everyone voted "keeper" on this recipe.

Mine burned and I don't think they need to cook for 60 min., I'd say 40 min. - flipping the wedges half way through. I only used 2 sweet potatoes - so maybe this was too much oil. I used a ziploc bag to toss them in. I will try again with the decreased cooking time and less oil for the smaller portion.

These sweet potato sticks were suprisingly good! I did add extra seasonings (salt, black pepper, season salt and garlic powder) to spice up the recipe though. Overall the recipe is a really good idea! I would have liked for the sticks to be a little more crispy, but I guess you can't expect to get that from oven cooking them.

Just did not work for us. Limp, no flavor from the paprika- might be good with other spices but we will not be trying that due to the limpness factor.

Just did not work for us. Limp, no flavor from the paprika- might be good with other spices but we will not be trying that due to the limpness factor.

I don't like sweet potatoes usually but these were good.  I added salt of course and that gave it a salty/sweet taste which I like.  I wish mine had come out a little crispier on the outside so maybe I should have fried them but was trying to avoid the oil.

I baked these for a potluck and guests raved over the taste, even though I baked them a little too long so they didn't look pretty.  I added equal amount of cinnamon with the paprika, plus a dash of coarse salt, and used food processor to make lengthwise oval slices. Next time I'll stick to the steak cut fry slices, which will undoubtedly hold their shape better during transfer from baking sheet to serving plate.

Very simple and quick fix if you feel like having healthy fries! You can really use a variety of spices to flavor them differently. I used some cajun spice mix and it was delicious. 

Also, I cut my sweet potatoes about McDonald's size and baking for 40 mins turned out being too long for them (they were burnt). Perhaps 30 mins for thinner strips would do.

Very good and healthy alternative to french fries.  I used cinnamon instead of paprika.  I slice mine a bit thinner than the recipe calls for.  They are better at room temperature, as another reviewer mentioned. My family loved them.  I've made them twice already and will make them again and again.

great way to eat sweet potato.  My only suggestion would be to add salt and pepper, either when you are mixing with oil, or when you are ready to serve - while they are still hot.
You can also dip these in a cumin-may mixture if you want

very good recipe, though like others i cut the potatoes into much smaller slices and cooked for about 10 min on one side and 12 on the other. also, adding some low-fat parmesan cheese is a nice way to change the flavour up a bit.

These were too limp and I'm assuming that I put too much olive oil in my bag when mixing.  I also cut them into thinner strips and pulled them early from the oven because the bottoms were browned.  I'm thinking less oil next time and cut bigger so they are more crisp and not limp.

Thanks for this. Simple and easy for the single guy. I didn't have paprika and wound up using garam masala, an Indian spice mix. They came out really well.

I made this tonight with pre-cut sweet potato sticks. I not only used paprika,
but I also used Johnny's seasoning salt, garlic powder, a little ground red pepper
and black pepper. I served it with the 
Secret Burger Sauce from this site and 
homemade ranch dressing.

I'll have to remember to coat the pan next time so they don't stick.

Kids ate them up. They especially liked that they were a pretty orange color, not like the normal oven fries I make. We all liked them, just with more seasoning. I'll be sure to make them again.

I spray my sticks with cooking spray and season with seasoned salt.  They are lighter and still very tasty.  Sweet potatoes already have a lot of flavor to begin with.

Really tasty side dish and a great way to eat sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing this great idea. I just wish they were crispy on the outside. If anyone knows how to make them crispy on the outside, please share!

They burnt at 40 minutes (should have read reviews first). Tried again and done at 25 minutes. They weren't as crisp as I would have liked, so tried again and brushed fries with egg whites - crispy goodness!!!

These were just as good as fried sweet potato fries, imo.  Not to mention easier unless you have a big deep fryer. I did add salt, pepper, and garlic powder after baking because that's how I like them.  I will make these again.

Even better than I imagined! I suggest using much more paprika, and also adding salt. LIke others, I found 40 minutes to be way too long. I took them out at 35 minutes and already a few were burned, so I'd suggest 25 to 30.

I really enjoy baked sweet potatos.  I use taco seasoning instead of paprika.  Sounds odd, but is very tasty.

These are one of my most favorite items to eat and they are soooo easy! I cut them thinner also - even my 10 yr old son loves them! This is a quick, easy, foolproof recipe (even though it takes a while to cook!) A family favorite.

This is a great recipe.  The first time I made them like the recipe called, except I used cajun seasoning and they were delicious!  The next time that I made them, I only used a TBSP of butter and 2 TBSP of "sugar in the raw" and they were so yummy!  Goes great with a chef salad!

Easy and delicious. I sliced the sweet potatoes into thinner sticks (more like french fries) and also added a little bit of salt.

This tasted yummy. Thank you! I've also tried them with avocado oil, cinnamon and stevia. (Or you could use sugar). Place all ingredients in large ziplock and mix with rubbing the bag together. Add potatoes and "shake and bake." Thank you everyone for such wonderful recipes. My meals are not so boring anymore! ??

Very good and so simple! I have tried sweet potato fries at restaurants and am always disappointed that I don't like them. I really like this version. I cut them into skinny wedges and reduced the cooking time. I'll make these often!

These are great! Easy and lots of flavor. I substituted the paprika with chili powder and it added an amazing flavor with the sweet potatoes. Doing this again and again.

Wow! I really liked these.  I added salt, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder.  I also only baked them for about 30 minutes but I only used two sweet potatos.  This was really good and I will be making these again.

This is really a great way to serve sweet potatoes.  So easy, and no frying.

SOOOO good! This is my favorite way to eat sweet potatoes and no, never really liked them before I tried this. My second favorite way is to just replace the paprika and other spices with cinnamon and follow this recipe otherwise. Do check them and turn them... might burn otherwise. YUM!!!

Usually don't like sweet potatoes. It came out great. Did not flip them halfway through because I like the burnt sides. Couldn't get enough of it.

These were quick and easy to make, but they really need more seasonings to taste better. I would add some cajun seasoning next time.
Overall I thought it was a good healthy snack, better for you than cookies.

Maybe it was just me, but I didn't like this recipe at all.  I love sweet potato sticks.  Maybe the ones I usually order were deep fried.  I will try that instead.
