Fun to make, and a real pleasure to eat. Immensely flavorful!  I prepared this exactly as written, only adding chopped fresh parsley to the crumb mixture for color, which really made a difference.  I didn't bother to serve this with the extra mayo mixture.  Every flavor was evident, yet understated - the rosemary, lemon, garlic - all there. The crumb coating was light, crispy and attractive.  The baking time was right on - the chicken was so tender it cut with just my fork - literally. Excellent recipe. I served this with  "Tony's Summer Pasta" and a tossed green salad with "Creamy Italian Dressing II," both recipes also from this site.

I made this last night, and loved it!  I didn't have all the ingredients, so I made do with the following substitutions: dried rosemary, pecans, regular breadcrumbs, and myzithra cheese.  With these proportions, I had a lot of the mayo mix leftover and the lemon flavor was very strong.  I liked that, but you could reduce the lemon and lemon peel for a more subtle taste.

This chicken is absolutely perfect! We loved it. So incredibly tender and flavorful. The lemon and rosemary with the Parmesan and Almonds goes together so well and the light crunchy topping is perfect. I followed naples34102 and added fresh parsley to the bread crumb topping and it really does make a big difference in appearance. I must have read a little to fast and added the lemon juice to all of the mayo mixture.  This wasn't a problem because I wasn't going to reserve any of the mayo mixture and servie it on the side anyway and I think the lemon juice, added to the mixture before baking, added more fresh flavor. I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper very well before brushing on the mayo mixture. Again, following naples34102 (I always keep an eye on what this incredible chef is up to and use her menus alot! :) I served this with Tony's Summer Pasta (from this site). This is one of our favorite meals that I have prepared recently.

A beautiful dish... simple yet delicately flavorful! I subbed plain yogurt for half the mayo. May I suggest not using as much lemon/lemon juice as it calls for? It overpowered the other ingredients - I enjoyed it but my BF wasn't as into it. Also - be sure to give the tops a light topping of olive oil... I skipped that step so the tops didn't brown and get crispy... Again, I didn't mind (save the cal/fat) but my BF would've preferred the crispiness. DO NOT skip the almonds! I was surprised how nicely they complemented the dish!

WOW!  If only there were a 10 star rating.....  Followed recipe to the letter, but added 5-7 minutes on convect to the cooking time @400 which made for a lovely, crunchy coating.  Chix was perfectly moist.  This sauce brings a "party" to the plate.  I'd consider making this for crowd if I had the right roasting pan :?)

This recipe was amazing! It was simple to make and delicious. The one thing I did do differently was I baked the chicken for thirty minutes to get rid of the pinkish inside color. Other than that, excellent!

This was so yummy! My only change: I didn't have any fresh lemons on hand and used the bottled stuff. The fresh rosemary was wonderful. The table was unusally quiet - mouths were full!

I lowered the fat content on this considerably and it was still 5 stars! I got lots of comments on how moist and flavorful the chicken was. The first time I used light mayo (and sprayed with Pam instead of adding extra olive oil), reduced the cheese and used light parmesan, and left out the almonds because I didn't have any. This time I used a combination of fat free greek yogurt and low fat miracle whip, and it was unbelievable as well. I also used chicken tenders instead of breasts. I would definitely recommend using the lighter ingredients, since the taste was still rich and delicious and then you can afford to eat much more :)

Great Recipe. My picky boys liked it and so did my husband, who normally doesn't like baked chicken dishes. The chicken stayed moist and the topping was crunchy. I didn't have any fresh rosemary so I used dried.

Very easy, great taste!  Made just as is, except we didn't use the extra mayo mixture.  I forgot it in the fridge.

Very nice and easy dish. Cut back on the lemon juice to 1 tablespoon and wound up baking it at 375 for 50 minutes.  Also used half Spectrum canola mayo and half sour cream. Next time, I'd use canola mayo and Greek yogurt.

There are so many variations of this recipe.  I made one with Old Bay seasoning and less lo fat olive oil mayo.

Wish people wouldn't leave negative ratings as to origin, etc.  Say something nice, or don't say a word!

I tenderized my chicken breasts by laying them in between two layers of plastic wrap and pounding them with a tenderizing mallet before breading them. For us, there really was too much rosemary. I think next time, I'd like to try this with italian seasoning. With that said, we liked the breading itself, with the mixture of bread crumbs, almonds and parmesan cheese.

The family loves this! I've tried with chicken breast and skinned chicken thighs, both great! I didn't have rosemary or almonds, but still came out tasty! The first time I put way too much mayo mix on top so the bread crumbs didn't brown much. This time I went easy and cooked a few extra minutes on 400 to help crisp the top.  My picky 10 yr old loves this!!

Made these with a side of Fettuccine Alfredo for my boyfriend's birthday dinner and he loved them! He asked if these were fried and couldn't believe that I baked them! There were only two things that I did differently to the recipe... 1. I halved the ingredients for the mayo mix  2. I added extra parm to the breasts after adding the mayo and then put the crumbs and olive oil on the breasts.  Yum!

I loved it, great flavor and simple.  I found, however, that it needed at least 10 more minutes to cook, and mine didn't get crispy all the way around.

Great Meal.  Easier than I thought.  I used the lemon juice in a bottle because of the other comments but I'll try the other way next time.

Such a delicious recipe!  My daughter doesn't like Mayonnaise and didn't even realize it was part of the sauce on the chicken.  Wonderfully zesty!

Used dried rosemary plus the juice from a whole small lemon - mixed the mayo mixture the day before then let sit in the fridge for a day. I added the grated parmasean just before I put it on the chicken.  3/4 of the way thru baking I added freshly grated parma cheese & let it melt + crisp on the edges. My super-picky son ate every single bite of the large portion I served him! This is on the montly menu for my family now!

This was alright. Nothing great. There are similar recipes on this site that I like better so I probably won't make again.

Fantastic!  I didn't add the extra mayo mixture either, as another reviewer mentioned.  I also forgot to drizzle the olive oil on the chicken at the end and it didn't seem to make a difference.  I will make this for guests in the future and can see making this often.  Yummy!

Not sure what happened. My breading turned out soggy. The chicken was tasty, just not the breading.  I think next time I will fry and finish it in the oven.

Very yummy!  I think this will also be good on salmon... I think I will try that next.  I didn't use any oil, and used thighs and it turned out great!

I cooked this for 11 people but baked off 14 breasts. Every single one of them was gone! Absolutely delicious and they were begging me to make it again sometime soon. I found though that I did not need that much sauce. Like I said, I used 14 chicken breasts (6 oz) but only doubled the sauce ingredients and I still had leftover sauce. I also didn't reserve any sauce for dipping (did not need it, it was so moist!) and ended up throwing about half of the sauce out. Next time I make it, I'll make the sauce ingredients as listed (4 servings) but still do the 14 breasts.

This was excellent, although I did alter some things based on what I had in the house and also on dietary restrictions. I left out a lot of things and it was still wonderful. I didn't use cheese because we don't eat cheese with meat, I used regular bread crumbs instead of panko, no lemon peel just lemon juice, and dry rosemary instead of fresh. I have never had such moist chicken breast, this was truly phenomenal. Will be making often.

I'm going five stars. I marinated in lemon pepper marinade.  I substituted the mayo with plain Greek yogurt and cut the lemon zest in half. 
Used lemons from my tree and rosemary from the garden. 
Simple, easy to prepare in advance, and the dipping sauce can be used for other recipes. 
It's a keeper!

Loved it! I agree with probably doing 400 degrees instead of 375, which is what I did, but the chicken was so juicy! used regular breadcrumbs instead of panko so didn't get too crispy, but the taste was awesome anyway! used miracle whip and it gave it a sweeter taste, and didn't use lemon cause didn't have any but lemon would really have made it perfect. LOVED the almonds. also just used dried rosemary, but worked fine. didn't use side mixture and was perfect as is. Thank you for this recipe! :)

I made this for my daughter who is home from college and missing home cooking.  It turned out incredibly well, and I am grateful for easy, delicious recipes like this one - my kids give me all the credit!  The mayo/lemon/herb mixture made it SO moist, and contrasted nicely with the crunchy topping.      I think I'll follow others' advice next time and substitute yogurt for some of the mayo.  I didn't use the extra mayo mixture for the chicken, but it was great on asparagus!  Also, the amount of bread-crumb/Parmesan/nut topping was easily double what I needed for 4 chicken breasts.  I love nuts on almost anything, but some in my family asked me to leave them out, which was easily done.  I can't wait to try this recipe again!

Great recipe and it turned out beautifully. The chicken stayed tender and moist, which was especially appreciated since my chicken breasts were not even close to equal size. Pay attention to any extra seasoning. Mayo and the parmesan cheese contains a good amount of sodium, as can the almonds, depending upon the type you choose. I used some homemade smoked almonds, which were lovely. I found no need for the reserve mayo mixture.

Very good.  Very easy.  I loved the fresh lemon paired with the fresh rosemary.  The crust was delicious.  Wonderful!

This was good, not great, but good. It was easy to make and my 4 year old helped make it, but then she didn't really love eating it. With the endless amouts of things that one can do with chicken breast, I probably will try something different next time.

This was great.  My 9yr. old said that it beat his current favorite chicken recipe.    I was out of bread crumbs, so I used crushed Saltines and it was still good (but was probably soggier than it would be with bread crumbs).  I also used 1 tsp. dry rosemary instead of fresh, and it worked good enough for us.

Yum!  I've tried some recipes with a similar mayo-type sauce before and was unimpressed, but this was excellent--the taste was perfect!  I used Miracle Whip because it's what I had on hand, and it was great--possibly because I tend to prefer it anyway, but sometimes it doesn't substitute well for mayo--this time it did!  I also had to sub in pecans because I couldn't find my bag of almonds, and that worked well too.  I would recommend checking the doneness though--I had some fairly thick chicken pieces and they took about 15 extra minutes to get done.

This is an excellent recipe for chicken.  Make the mayo sauce a few hours ahead of time to really blend the flavours.  Served with sweet potatoes and broccoli.  It's a real keeper!!

This was a tasty chicken.  I skipped the parm.  The crispiness wore off since I waited awhile before I served it.  Good though and worth making again when I need an Italian seasoned chicken.

I make this all the time. It is one of my husbands favorite dishes! I usually use light mayo to cut down on all the calories, and I add a bit more garlic than called for. LOVE IT!

This was a amazing!!! I don't review often and rarely follow a recipe as written but we did this one, well almost we used dried rosemary. didn't have fresh on hand and I only had limes not lemons.
I doubled the recipe and didn't have enough cheese and my family LOVES parmesan cheese and even still this was amazing!!! I am not big on the little side sauce or dip either but this one really added to the taste. 
Usually when I cook I try new things, we don't do much twice around here BUT this one we will do again. maybe even next week!!!!!

LOVE LOVE LOVE this chicken!
