These turned out great! I personally substituted heavy whipping cream instead of milk and I used 7 rather large golden potatoes and I used minced garlic and a few tbs butter. My husband, 6 y/o son and I all really loved them though & I will most definitely be making these again!!

3 potatoes was the perfect amount, because we didn't end up with a crazy amount of left overs (which I loved). We stirred in a few shakes of garlic powder for extra flavor.

Way too much milk when using a liquid measuring cup. I had to dump some of it out and then it turned out okay.

Totally delicious! Fast and easy to make! I actually used more potatoes and added a 1/2 cup of sour cream to the recipe. This is saved as one of my staple recipes!

I used a bit of cream cheese and a spoon of butter, mashed the potatoes with a fork. The food processor makes them too gooey for my taste :) Guests loved them!

Simple but good recipe. The only thing I did differently was add 1/4 cup butter because I can’t have mashed potatoes without butter!

Had some fresh chopped parsley from another Thanksgiving recipe that I used for color. I, too, added garlic powder for a little extra flavor. Very happy with the end result.

Was good I didn't even use milk just butter and salt pepper tasted like old rustic style potatoes. I had no milk or cream but for more creamy potatoes definitely needed.

They were delicious.  However, because I had little time to make it, I used potato flakes and added the rest of the ingredients to it.  It turned out quite delicious even though I cheated. :-)
