This was good the first night and would have gotten a 4, but it was delicious the next day, once the flavors had blended and the fennel had softened a bit. This makes a lot and, for us, the dressing wasn't enough as written. I made another half batch and thought it could have used even more, but the next day it was just right. The flavor of the fennel was mild and not at all overpowering. I ran it through a food processor with the slicer attachment to get it nice and thin. Overall, a good salad--I like it with a sprinkle of sea salt.

Love it love it love it. Will make it again and again. Great if you slice the fennel on a mandolin.

I love fennel salads and wanted a change from the beet and orange fennel salad I usually make. It had plenty of dressing to give everything a nice coating but it needs more flavor. Adding more Dijon would be a good first step. I don't think I will make this again but thank you for sharing.

Very healthy salad which I made with tomatoes from my garden. I don't think I'll make it again though too much fennel for me and I love fennel. Thanks for recipe it gave me a way to use some watercress.
