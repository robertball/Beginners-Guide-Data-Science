Thanks for the great recipe! It was easy and included stuff I already had on hand. However only serve them to people who are more adventurous eaters- they do not have a typical cookie taste and are somewhat of a cross between peanut butter cookies and snickerdoodle/sugar cookies. If you are interested in making this I would recommend that you make sure the butter and sugar are creamed well. There are no ingredients that cause rising action so you need to incorporate air by creaming the butter and sugar. Do not overbake these cookies- they come out of the oven soft but will hardent up somewhat after cooling.

I've used this recipe several times - It's a crispy good-tasting cookie that's a little unusual. It makes a good gift cookie.

I was really excited about this recipe. I always like when ingredients that I typically associate with savory (tahini in this case) are used in an atypical fashion. These were a little bit of a let down. I just didn't like the combination of tahini and sweetness. I think maybe it's because I really love tahini for it's slightly nutty/chalky taste and this was masked by the sugar. Just a personal preference for me. I'm sure others will actually enjoy the cookie BECAUSE it takes out that strong taste from the tahini.

These are very yummy and work well with half whole weat too. Not bland at all you can taste just right the cloves and cinnamon and of coure the tahini (it might taste odd at first to someone who is not familiar with tahini). Really good when still warm.

Crumbly and bland. BUT I was also _very_ liberal in making substitutions to the recipie so this could very well be my fault. The cookies that got less done in the middle had more identifiable tahini flavour so maybe I should have cooked them less/cooler. I also might have left the beater on too long while creaming the butter/sugar/eggs putting too much air in. Might have to try this again next time I've got leftover tahini and see if I get it right the 2nd time

These were delicious! Seriously my husband and I loved them. I followed other reviewers advice and let them cool a bit before transferring to a small wire rack. I added two extra tablespoons sugar for a tinge more sweetness.
