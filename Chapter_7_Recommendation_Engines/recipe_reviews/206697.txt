I've been making this for years, I learned it from Mom. If you don't have Chex brand cereal you can use crushed corn flakes or Rice Krispies. Mom sometimes used half flour and half crushed cereal. I suggest if you are looking to cut down on the salt, you use your favorite brand of seasoning salt and garlic powder. I also use evaporated milk because I like a thicker coating on my fried chicken. This adapts well to whatever you have on hand and you can always double it and keep a batch in a ziplock bag for days you're short on time.

I have been making this recipe for our family since my youngest went gluten-free.  The only change I make is to cut the breasts up into nugget sized pieces and rather than using garlic salt and seasoned salt I use a (Lindberg-Snider) porterhouse & roast seasoning blend I have.  I bake it on wire racks over raised-edge cookie sheets so the pieces can evenly cook and are crispy all around.  I typically cook it for about 25 to 30 minutes and sometimes turn the broiler on for the last minute or so to crisp it up a little bit extra.

Substituted Cornflakes as I  did not have Chex cereal. Both my husband and my 3 year old son liked it. My husband took one bite and said it tastes like fried chicken.

Very good and easy recipe. I cut up a whole chicken and this recipe was just enough to coat all the chicken pieces. Did cut the salt down to ½ teaspoon and added 2 ½ of Mrs Dash Seasoning! The final change was the cereal, because I did not have rice cereal; used half Corn Flakes and Cheerios!

Delicious! Simple! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt and added 1 tsp. of poultry seasoning as well. I used 3 T. of egg whites rather than 1 egg, and I used skim milk.  I greased the baking pan with olive oil cooking spray.  For the cereal, I used Barbara's Shredded Spoonfuls. I had a lot of the milk/egg white mix left over, so next time I will cut down the milk to maybe a 1/2 cup.

OK, so I did a bunch of changes as I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used turkey that was originally made for schnitzels.  I put Corn Flakes in a zip lock with some shakes of: garlic powder, onion powder, salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper.  In a different bowl I threw an egg and some milk in it and whisked it.  I covered the schnitzels in flour, then the egg wash and then the cereal mix.  Baked at 375F for 25 min.  The husband LOVED this.  He said the crunch from the cereal was different but really good.  Will definitely make this again.

I don't know what I did wrong but this was not too flavorful.  I probably wouldn't make it again.

This recipe had the potential to be really good, but had one major flaw.
I made exactly as stated, and the cereal was crispy, and the bread was juicy.  But there was WAY TOO MUCH garlic flavor from the garlic salt.  My husband and I like garlic but it was too much. My daughter wouldn't touch it. 
Despite the 2-star rating, I think this may have been pretty decent if you leave the garlic salt out altogether. I may make it again with that change.

Yes I tried this recipe and my family loved loved loved it. I just  change it just a bite. I used buttermilk instead of milk and I used cornflakes , I also used pepper and salt cause I didn't have garlic salt just before I put in oven.

Didn't have rice chex, but I did have cornflakes which worked out well. Next time I might add some more seasoning, but overall not bad. Really moist chicken.

I thought this was a really good recipe. My husband and kids also liked it (which is saying ALOT). I also chose to use my own blend of seasonings. Other than that, I didn't change anything!

I made it exactly as per the recipe and everyone in my family enjoyed it. For my husband with celiac disease it was nice to have a substitute for fried chicken that I can easily make at home with no changes to the recipe. Our children can both be picky at times but both said they like it. We will definitely make this again!

I followed the recipe pretty closely, but substituted garlic powder for garlic salt.  It was easy to make, the coating was crispy and the chicken breast was moist and tender.  I also turned this once during the 35 minute cooking time to get it evenly browned on both sides.  Will definitely make this again.
