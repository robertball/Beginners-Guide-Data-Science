I have tons of spaghetti squash and decided to use the seeds in this recipe.  They turned out great! Has a taste & smell of popcorn.  

Being type 2 diabetic, it is a great snack food.  Could not believe how many vitamins and minerals this snack has.  It has to be one of the most nutritional foods around!

I love roasted squash seeds!  I have never used oil to roast mine, though.  I simply stir the seeds every five minutes to prevent sticking.

I have never had pumpkin seeds before, but I had squash on hand when I saw this recipe and thought I would try it. They were very good. I couldn't stop eating them. Yum!

Quick and easy.  I just turned the oven temp down after roasting my squash, and popped the prepared seeds in.  15 minutes later, the snack is done!

This would be 5 stars if it included these changes: 1) Don't rinse the seeds, they taste better with their own juices 2) Soak in a bit of salty water for awhile to plump up the seeds 3) Drain water but still don't rinse 4) Let air dry before baking. If you don't have time for the soaking, at least don't rinse them and let them dry longer before baking. They just turn out better if they are dry before baking. My favorite are carnival squash seeds. Pumpkin seeds pale in comparison to all the other winter squash available!

Very addicting and a great idea, especially right now when squash is cheap. I use butternut squash seeds. I like to put the raw seeds in a covered bowl w/the olive oil and some seasoned (Lawry's) salt. I make them in my pizza oven, so I have to continuously stir, some get a little burnt, but it adds to the flavor!

I used PAM cooking spray instead of the olive oil and it came out just fine.
Really good!

What a treat I could have given the men in the Navy and Marines when I was cooking for them. I have thrown out tons and tons of seeds back then. We didn't use pumpkins often but acorn and butternut were staples. I used acorn to try this made with canola oil and won't throw out seeds anymore! GREAT IDEA.

Made some of my favorite squash today, butternut, and decided to look on line to see if the seeds could be cooked like the pumpkin seeds.  I found this recipe and followed it but had to cut back on the oil/salt because my squash didn't give me quite a cup!  My DH loved it!!!!  Quick easy and delicious.  You can use any time of flavoring you like--cinammon & sugar, garlic powder, cayenne pepper, chili powder, etc....possibilities are endless.  Thanks Blancheskid.....

I used lemon-infused oil and sea salt, and the flavor was fantastic. However, I don't really think this was long enough/hot enough to create crunchy seeds. They're a little too pulpy still for me.

I was recently making a butternut squash recipe from this site and started thinking how much I loved pumpkin seeds and how these seeds looked similar. Before even looking at this recipe, I had rinsed and removed them from their pulp (much easier than removal from pumpkin pulp...just kind of squeeze the pulp and they pop out), added some sea salt to them while still wet, then tossed them in the oven at 400 while the squash was cooking. You DO NOT need oil or cooking spray! And you can cook at a higher temp. Just stir in the spices you want while they are still wet, then toss them in a single layer, on tinfoil on a baking sheet. Stir with a fork every 5 or 10 minutes and taste until you find the consistency you like. I personally like just sea salt as you don't lose the nutty taste of the seeds and did 25 minutes at 400. So nutty and tasty!!!!!

No need to add oil to roast any seeds.  I wash them and pick out as much pulp as I have the patience for.  Then sprinkle with salt while they're wet.  Roast in a 350 degree oven until brown, stirring every 5 or 10 minutes until all seeds are very brown and crispy.  Takes about 30 minutes.  YUM.

I just made these....while supper was cooking.  Love them!  I used olive oil since the oven temp was low, but I think next time I'll use my grapeseed oil, since it's a medium to high heat oil that does not turn into the bad stuff like olive oil does when used in medium/high heat.... [my husband ate most of them after supper]

YUM YUM!! Who would have known these were so tasty! They are like miniature pumpkin seeds. I am just sad that I don't have more. My kids are just about to walk in the door on this crisp autumn day from school and they will devour them! If only more people knew!

A great variation is to add a sprinkle of curry powder and cayenne ----- gives it a bit of taste of the sub continent!  ;-)

Delicious and Addictive!  As others suggested I dry roasted them for about 35 minutes, then added seasoning (paprika and salt).

I didn't use the oil or salt either.  I didn't dry the seeds completly; just left them a bit damp and threw them in the oven.  They don't 'pop' without the oil I guess, but I leave them in for 15-20 minutes and they're done.  They don't stick for me, and I don't use cooking spray either.

These seeds are delicious! I fished the seeds out of a mini-squash and did them in my toaster oven, and they were gone in an hour.

At 275 degrees for 15 minutes the seeds were still dense and were not crispy. I did use the same amount of olive oil and some seasoning salt and the mixture was tasty. I ended up using my oven at 350 degrees for closer to 25 minutes and they crisped up just fine. I will have to do another batch to get the exact timing.
I wanted to note that squash seeds are very healthy for women and help contribute to a hormone we have called DHEA. DHEA is a hormone that helps us with our energy levels.

Yummy!  I'd add less salt for my personal taste next time.  I threw in a pinch of cayenne.  That was an even better ideas than I thought it would be.  If you like spicy snacks, I'd highly recommend that.

I had some organic acorn squash seeds leftover from preparing my 10 month old daughter's baby food. Decided to roast the seeds rather than toss them and they were very good. I bet you could experiment with a variety of seasonings (cinnamon, nutmeg, parmesan cheese, popcorn seasoning, brown sugar or honey) for different tastes; plain with olive oil is perfect to me, though!

Yum! I used acorn squash seeds and they turned out so tasty. I didn't use oil, just sprayed the seeds with a little cooking spray after I put them on the baking sheet. Stirred every five minutes and they came out perfectly. So many flavors you could do with this... I'm going to do Cajun next. Thanks!!!

These are perfect as-is, although most recently, I added a sprinkling of cumin before baking. I used the seeds as a garnish for my butternut squash soup. Nice little crunch!

I did this with butternut squash seeds.  Sprinkled a little cayenne on them.  Love it!  But it took a lot longer than 15 minutes to cook to where they were crunchy instead of chewy - more like 35 minutes.  Addictive!

I wasn't sure the trouble of sorting and cleaning the seeds would be worth it but these are very good. I used a combination of spaghetti squash and acorn squash seeds, a bit of olive oil and garlic salt.

These are good! I am allergic to corn (therefore no popcorn) so these are a great substitute! My only issue is that I had to bake them for 35 minutes in order for them to "pop" instead of the listed 15. Worth the wait though.

YUM!  I'd never thought to use the seeds from squash.  I tried it with acorn squash and it was GREAT!  My seeds were a bit small so they only took about 10 minutes until they started popping.  Also added some garlic powder & cayenne - most any seasoning could probably be added.  I will not be throwing out my squash seeds any time in the future!

Absolutely delicious!  Mine just got out of the oven and they're sooo good.  Really awesome.  I've tried recipes with other spices before, but this plain and simple way of doing it is much better.

Funny! I never thought to roast any other squash seeds than pumpkin! I used butternut seeds tonight and they were amazing. A little olive oil, pink salt, and viola, perfection! I will be cooking more squash just so I can roast the seeds!

So easy, so good.  I roasted my spaghetti squash seeds for 15 minutes at 350 degrees on a pan below the pan which held the squash halves roasting.  The seeds were delicious!  I agree with the person who said they're like popcorn.  Mmmm.  After rinsing in a bowl I patted off the seeds on a kitchen towel, which helped pick up some of the stray squash innards.  I will definitely make this again whenever I have fresh squash! (Update: made again with seeds from pie pumpkin, and the seeds bake for 15 min at 350 whether or not I have anything else in the oven.)

These were delicious! I used seeds from a spaghetti squash, and had to scale down the recipe because the squash only yielded ~1/4 c seeds. Definitely will make again!

this was really yummy. my only complaint is that i just had seeds from one spaghetti squash(not the recipe's fault!) next time i make these i will be sure to have more. i think the seeds from a pumpkin would yield a better amount since they are so addicting.

I was making spaghetti squash for the first time and had no clue that there were even seeds in it!  When I saw them, I thought "those look just like pumpkin seeds, I wonder if you can roast them!" Did a quick google search and lo and behold, this recipe! I followed it to the letter, but had to do a quarter recipe cause my squash didn't give me many seeds. They turned out delicious! The perfect amount of salty and crunchy! Super addictive!

I wanted to use my seeds and found this recipe to be successfull. Quick and easy. I just turned the oven temp down after roasting my squash for a soup, then I just popped the prepared seeds in. 15 minutes later, the snack is done  very tasty! thank you!

I have roasted a lot of different squash seeds, they are all good. I don't use oil, only seeds and salt in a baking sheet at the lowest temperature( 170 ) in oven for several hours(overnight), stirring once or twice.

Awesome! So glad I found this recipe! Now every time I cut open any kind of squash, I roast the seeds in my toaster oven for a special snack. Actually, they're much better than pumpkin seeds because they're smaller and less woody. My husband and 2-year old son love them!

My first time making spaghetti squash and thought the seeds looked edible. I looked up a recipe and this one was the first and simplest. Perfect, absolutely delicious! Thanks for posting it!

Like other reviewers said, the cook time isn't enough.  I used melted butter and Franks hot sauce with the seeds.  It took about 45 minutes to achieve the desired crispness. The key is to taste the seeds every 10 minutes or so until they are just right.  Then you know how long to cook them.

Great flavor and crunch! I roasted the seeds after roasting a rather large butternut squash for the butternut squash pie. I left the seeds in for about 20 minutes to get a nice golden brown color and sprinkled with sea salt. Great healthy snack. Now I can't wait to make the squash pie.

Great ... I used sea salt, which turned out to be a little TOO salty ... I'd suggest keeping the oil and the salt to a minimum. Mine never "popped," even after 25 minutes, but that might be because I'm at a high altitude. Still good, though!

Wow... All those years of making roasted pumpkin seeds as a kid and I've not made these until tonight.  Fabulous!  I used spaghetti squash seeds and instead of a tablespoon of olive oil, I used a Misto filled with olive oil for a light spray of oil and they turned out great!

Awesome stuff what I did though was step it up a notch did the olive oil and then melted a little slice unsalted real butter and then put salt, pepper, and rosemary in it. Let me tell you insanely tasty.

Yummy and so healthy for you, who couldn't love these? I've never made them myself before until now, I think 1tbsp oil per cup may be too much because mine came out of the oven still wet, but they will probably dry as I leave them out. But I tasted one just in case and they taste great! Only 4/5 because of the wetness, could be my bad though.

Delicious!  Not all squashes yield a full cup of seeds, though.  Make sure to adjust the salt and olive oil accordingly.

I used Old Bay seasoning on my squash seeds and they turned out sensationally well.  My husband swears they are even better than roasted pumpkin seeds.  The batch I made lasted about 5 minutes.

Brought it to work and was first met with "eeeeeeeewwwwwsss" until they tasted it and then went "MMMMMM!!!!". A good snack, and something contructive for the seeds of my winter squash meals.

Wonderful! I used acorn squash seeds, and they were delicious. I made sure to leave some of the bits of squash on the seeds--didn't rinse them off completely--that adds nice flavor. Also, I accidentally forgot they were in the oven, and they baked for 30 mintues and tasted great--not burnt at all!

I've made this recipe a number of times now. Every time I use different seasonings. My kids love them with cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, ginger, and sugar on them. I do stir them periodically, even though the recipe doesn't really say to. I find they scorch less.

Didnt know what would happen since in the past i just threw them away.  Easy to do, i washed mine thoroughly and added olive oil and salt substitutes instead of regular salt.  

Just tasted then saw where others said they popped mine didn't, but tasted pretty good.

I made these and they are super tasty! I did soak them in liquid aminos and garlic powder for about 8 hrs. After that I did the olive oil and homemade season salt from this app. I don't care for Lowery's. They did take about 30 to 40 min. to get crispy enough. Soooo gooood!

Omitted olive oil per other reviews, baked at 275 for 15 minutes and they  tasted good but kind of “raw” in the middle. Pulpy. Tossed with a little olive oil and added 5 minutes, ate a handful and spat them out — same issue. Put them in toaster oven at 400 and burnt them to a crisp. :-(

Not sure how they’re supposed to taste because I’ve never had them, so I was basing them on pumpkin seeds. Guess I should have stopped at undercooked — they’re seeds so eating them raw is fine anyway.

Bummed. Will try again.

I "juzzed" it up a bit and used garlic powder, onion salt, freshly ground black pepper and a touch of sea salt. Can't wait to try them!?

I used buttercup/kabocha squash seeds. It took longer than the recipe stated (about 40 minutes in the oven at 275f), but turned out well! I also added paprika and cumin. Will make again if I have the chance!

I had not used oil before and did not hear them "pop", but they did, in fact toast very nicely and are delicious. 

I had only toasted pumpkin seeds until now, but I harvest a dozed butternut squash from my garden this year.

The seeds took 30 min to get rid of the stringy pulp for a handful of seeds. Next time I'll but a bag of Pepitos (Dried salted pumpkin seeds) at Publix for $2.00. What a hassle!!!!

Meh.
Can't hold a candle to pumpkin seeds.  I tried this recipe twice.  Once, I boiled the seeds for 10 min. in salted water like you do with pumpkin seeds to make them crispier; once exactly as the recipe states.  The first time, they popped but the shells remained tough and inedible.  The second time, they didn't pop and were burned in 14 minutes.  I don't get it... I think I'll go back to putting them in the compost and hoping they grow :/

This is so much easier an idea – to stir the seeds in oil and salt first!  I used to put the seeds on an oiled baking sheet and turn them all, sprinkling salt all over the pan. This way is much better. And using parchment paper made for such easy cleanup! Thanks!

I used seeds from a Sunshine Squash. I followed the recipe closely, but ended up roasting the seeds for 30 minutes rather than 15. Then I tossed them with melted butter and added a small amount of sea salt. Very yummy!!!

Great simple recipe! If you want your seeds to be a bit easier to digest, you can boil them on low for 8-10 minutes before roasting them. Not sure of the science behind it, but that's the way my mom always did it!

Tasty - I went light on the olive oil as I have a nonstick baking sheet. Since each individual squash yields only a small amount of seeds, I save them in the fridge in water (to stay moist until ready to roast ) until I have several squashes worth. I use all types: spaghetti squash, acorn, butternut.......

I pretty much followed the recipe. Roasted them in toaster-convection oven on a sheet of aluminum foil with the edges rolled up. After rinsing & patting dry, I coated them with EVO and some Kosher salt. Wait till they start popping then turn off oven; they may continue to pop for less than one-half minute. Eat & enjoy.
These seeds were from a butternut squash. All squash seeds may be roasted this way EXCEPT pumpkin seeds since they are cooked at a higher temperature.

Because I   have tried it before and didn't  work out too good. It is   true   that it tastes like popcorn and nutty seeds. Delicious ! ! Thank you !

Scaled down to 1/2 cup of butternut squash seeds. Tasted great! Sprinkled with paprika after tasting to add some color. Next time I would like to try acorn squash and of course pumpkin.

Tried this recipe with two different types of squash.

Used olive oil and salt with buttercup squash seeds. Baked for 15 minutes and it was not long enough. Kept checking every 5 or 10 minutes until it had been 40 minute. Seeds were still not crunchy like I had expected, but I was afraid at that point that I was going to scorch them.

Interestingly, the taste varied with baking time, from Cheez-It like flavor to bacon flavor to finally a sort of popcorn flavor. Seeds ended up very chewy.

I tried again with butternut squash seeds. I baked them without salt or oil, and 15 minutes was plenty of time. In fact, I might have left them a little too long, as they has a bit of a taste like parched peanuts.

So maybe the differences in the seeds is enough to make it work for butternut squash but not for buttercup squash (which has a thicker outer shell on the seeds).

I don't wash off the strings and stuff.  When you spread them thin, they roast up nice and crispy and taste great.  I just remove the big chunks.

I've never had squash seeds before. These were pretty good! Needs a little bit of flavour though. Next time I make these I think I will add some brown sugar!

Worked well! I followed the recipe and I thought they were quite similar to pumpkin seeds (tasty). I will be doing this from now on!  Thanks!

I used butternut squash seeds and used seasoning salt (actually A & W seasoning salt) and it was fantastic. Mine needed a little bit more time than suggested but the result was excellent. Will definitely be making this again and again.

This simple recipe took little time or effort, but I let my seeds roast about 18 min. I used an olive oil cooking spray right on the pan and seeds. A little salt and a sprinkle of smoked paprika made a tasty snack! I'll never throw my seeds away again!

Great! Very easy and satisfying! I have an olive oil spray bottle which let me evenly coat the seats and probably use less than even the 1 tblsp in the recipe. The seeds still came out nice and crispy but I did cook them about 27 minutes. When I finally took them out they weren't quite popping(though I wonder if 5 more minutes would have done it) but there was a subtle crackle going on. Great snack and nice to know I'm using the whole squash!!

oh this is so much better than pumpkin seeds!  Mm,nummy!. Addictive thin shell. I reduce the heat in case I leave the house for a sec.  Nuts are easy to scorch.  The lowest on can go to dry things slow is 140 in the oven with the oven door open

These were easy and delicious, but it took them a lot longer than 15 minutes to bake/toast.  I finally took them out of the oven after 35 minutes when they were somewhat golden brown.  And they never did "pop".  I'll definitely make them again, though.

We added a bit of Sonny's Crazy Cajun Miraculous to the mix and they were a hit.  Very good!

I have tried this 3 times and it is really good, but it really is a lot more work than 25 mins. It took about an hour for me. It is really hard to get all the stuff off of the squash seeds, dry them, and keep them from sticking to the paper towel. I baked mine for 30 mins. because I like them nice and crunchy. I also used pattypan squash seeds and it worked just fine.

5 stars for such a great idea!  I love roasted pumpkin seeds; I love squash.  I can't believe I never thought to roast squash seeds before.  I hate to think of all the seeds I've thrown in the trash over the years.  This was such a tasty and extremely cheap snack.  Thank you!

Excellent, just as good as toasted pumpkin seeds!  I like mine saltier, so after rinsing I boil in salt water (1 Tblsp salt per half cup of seeds) for about 10 minutes, then pat dry, toss with the olive oil and bake.
