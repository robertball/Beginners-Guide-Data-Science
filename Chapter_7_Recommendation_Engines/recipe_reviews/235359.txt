tried this for dinner today well made it much easier by not tempering the milk and eggs by not heating them just whipped them together cold and baked it an extra 15 min. Turned out perfect rich and creamy.

Chef John, excellent! These were (as usual) fantastic. I wanted to double, or triple the recipe for Christmas dinner, can this be made in a casserole dish with the same outcome? Thanks!

Smelled and tasted like corn bread with texture like a souffle. Some of my family members are "foodies" & even they loved it. I will definitely make this again!
PS: liked the commentary on your videos - quite humorous at times.

This is amazing! And so easy to make. I let my blender mixture cool before blending. Turned out great!

This turned out great! I made it for my wife for valentine's day and it was way better than getting her flowers. It turned out fluffy and had a really good, slightly sweet flavor.

Delicious!  Although had issues with understanding when it was done. So i had some "operator error" but after that I was good to go.
