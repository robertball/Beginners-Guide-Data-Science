I leave out the egg whites and add at least one extra banana. I also let the blender do the chopping makes it a faster recipe if you have little ones! I like mine thicker then the original recipe comes out, plus it's a little more flavorful which equals a 5 in my book! Great recipe for a nice cold drink...watch out for the brain freeze!

I followed the recipe and used a cup of milk, only to have the finished product come out runny.  I recommend using only 1/4 of a cup.

I wanted a shake for just myself, so I used one banana, 1 scoop of ice cream, 1/4 c milk, and 1/4 tsp of vanilla extract. I omitted the egg white because I am pregnant. It is the best banana shake I have had.

I cut back the milk by half, at least. I was really aiming for a thicker shake. I also added a good shake of nutmeg. I don't know why the added egg whites, other than maybe as a thickener? This served two, my two boys. My oldest commented that it tasted kind of like creamy banana bread I'd make this again but I'd cut out the egg whites as they seemed unnecessary.

This was YUMMY! Even my 4 year old daughter loved it. Although, I took the suggestion of another reviewer and only used 1/4 cup of milk. Thanks for a recipe that is simple and delicious!!

I was suddendly in the mood for a banana milkshake at 9:00 at night.  Searched and found this.  I had a little ice cream to use up, milk and bananas.  I tossed in blender, poured a small shot of vanilla, a little cinnamon and wheat germ and added a small squirt of chocolate and 'viola' this great drink happend.  This was wonderful.  Wheat germ made it a little healthy and nutty tasting.  Thanks bunches.

OMG!!! This hit the spot! I was looking for an alternative to my usual peanut butter/banana smoothie...This was an instant hit at my home, with my boys 7 and 4 drinking it right up. I doubled the banana and added a bit more ice cream and cut down on the milk. Thanks for a great drink recipe.

This drink was the Bomb!!!  It's the first one I've found that all my family loves.  My husband is very picky and he loved it.  Complements are few when it comes to food.  THANK YOU SO MUCH.

Lovely for the summer! As others have suggested I added an extra banana and used 1/4 C milk and the consistency was perfect. If I had done any differently, it may have been a bit watery. It was delicious nonetheless.

Great recipe! I did leave out the egg whites and substituted frozen, fat free Greek yogurt for the ice cream. I sometimes like a bit of a nutty flavor so I'll use 1/4tsp vanilla extract and 1/4tsp almond extract. For an added health benefit I throw 1 Tbsp flaxseed oil in. Perfect breakfast, fills me for a while. Thanks for the recipe!

After reading the reviews I chose to double the banana (also suggest using bananas that are browning for a sweeter taste). I mixed the egg whites for salmonella reasons and also chose to use half milk, half heavy cream for thickening purposes. The altered recipe was amazing!

This shake is great, but I made a few changes. I used a frozen banana and 3/4 c milk. I c would be too milky, and I will cut back to just 1/2 c next time. I used 1 whole pastured egg instead of just whites. The shake was creamy and very good. I only got 2 small or 1 large serving. Even with 1 c of milk, 4 servings would be pretty small servings (maybe my scoops of ice cream were too small).

Mine was a little milky, maybe because my banana was too ripe or too much ice cream. But, it was very tasty and I will definitely try it again!

No egg white, 1/4 teaspoon vanilla, 1/4 cup milk and about 3 scoops of ice cream. It's so good I'm doubling the recipe next time!

This was  more like Banana milk.  I used 1/4 cup milk 1 banana as suggested by previous reviews and 2 generous scoops of ice cream along with 1/8 tsp. vanilla and it was WAAAAY too runny.  I added another 2 scoops and it was a little thicker, but not much more than milk.  SO... I added another 2 scoops and it was still very runny- but better. It has a decent flavor, but I'm sure I've lost a lot of the banana taste due to having to add so much more ice cream.  I think this has a lot of potential if you only add a splash of milk.  Maybe it was because I omitted the egg whites?

It was delicious, the way the banana and vanilla extract makes it so sweet especially since I follow the recipe right down to the first to last ingredient :-D

Great taste. I disagree that it makes 4 servings. I added an extra scoop of ice cream and cut the milk to a 1/2 cup to try to make it thicker, but ended up with just a single tall glass of drink. If one serving is meant to fill a small juice glass, then I'd agree with this making 4 servings.
