This was amazing! Just like ordering from a thai restaurant. However, I did add about 1 tablespoon of salt and another can of unsweetened coconut milk to the soup to give it more flavor. Also let it simmer on low for 30 minutes otherwise the zuccini will not be soft enough. 

Will definately make again!

Okay, so I followed this pretty closely. I found some frozen kaffir lime leaves at the Asian market, and thawed them, which worked perfectly. I didn't have chicken, so I subbed some tofu. I just -really- disliked the canned button mushrooms. I picked them ALL out, and replaced them with fresh button mushrooms that I chopped and sauteed in a pan before adding to the completed soup. Any fresh mushroom would be better than the straw ones, which are kind of slimy and have a weird taste. I think this soup would be better with the chicken for sure, but the tofu was nice in a pinch, and the rest of the flavors were out of this world.

This is a very good recipe!!  I found that if you use Thai basil (not regular or opal basil found in grocery store or nursery, only oriental markets) it DOES taste exactly like restaurant Tom Kha Gai. That's the only change I made to this recipe and it made a world of difference.

SO good! Had the devils own time trying to find kaffir lime leaves--finally went to a Thai restaurant, and they sold me some--this was the hit of the New Years Day bash!

it's almost there. I've begged my local Thai restaurant for their recipe and they wont give it up. This is the closest I've got so far. Btw, I used fresh mushrooms instead and after cooking the lemongrass and kafari lime leaves in for flavor, I fished them out of the soup. And after cooking it with one can of coconut milk I tasted it and it needed another half a can.

Very flavorful.  Pleasantly surprised.  We missed the spicy hot so next time will add too it.  But this was a great recipe.  Thank you.

I made this for two families and everyone loved the flavor.  Some did add some thai garlic chili sauce to add some heat.  
 I did use fresh mushrooms instead of canned.  A big hit!

I added jalapenos because I like a little heat and this soup was excellent!  I'll most certainly will be making this again!

Best Tom Kha recipe by far. First time I made this I was unable to get the lime leafs so I left them out,  it still tasted better than any other recipe I've found.

Very tasty soup! Had this at a restaurant and wanted to see if it would be easy to make and just as delicious at home. It was! The restaurant variety did not have the zucchini and was very brothy, so I was a bit concerned at first, but the lovely tastes from the broth were the same. Warms you from the inside, fills you up, and makes you wish you doubled the recipe for leftovers. Totally recommend this dish!

I added marinated tomatoes, an extra can of coconut milk and shrimp instead of chicken. Substituted quartered lemons for lemongrass. Used shrimp and chicken bouillon for broth. Was better than any restaurant version!
