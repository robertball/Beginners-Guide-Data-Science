What a cute, easy and delicious way of using leftover turkey. I am actually rating the idea of toast cups filled with a creamy turkey mixture. I looked up this recipe few minutes before lunch time and had to make a lot of substitutions to use what was available at the moment. So, I used whole wheat toast bread for the white, leftover gravy that I thinned out with some turkey broth and milk for the cream of mushroom and some frozen peas and carrots  for the peppers and onions. Not only this way of tweaking the recipe speared me a trip to the supermarket but also made it faster to get lunch on the table. While the bread cups were toasting in the oven, I got the peas and carrots in the microwave and the thinned out gravy on the stove. I shredded the turkey meat and added it, along with the cooked vegetables, to the gravy. Got the bread cups out of the oven, filled and served. Everybody loved them.

I really enjoyed this, but my family wasnâ€™t as impressed. I love the idea of the toast cups- these could be used for lots of other dishes like chicken salad, tuna salad, ham salad, etc.

I tried making these with gluten free bread and it failed, unfortunately. The gf bread, once rolled out, just tore and broke apart when trying to get it into the muffin tins. Actually, spreading the butter on them started tearing the bread even before I could pick it up. The turkey mixture is a delight and I ended up eating it deconstructed, so it tasted really good. I subbed gf chicken soup for the mushroom soup. Thanks for the great recipe.

This turned out to be a fun recipe and presents well. I gathered the grand kids and we made this as is and also some slightly different versions which resulted in all 5 stars. The recipe as is (which I failed to get a  photo since they were gobbled up instantly) was a hit. With further instructions from me about photos we made two  other versions. One using sourdough bread subbing green chiles for the green pepper and topped with cilantro. The other we used round sandwich bread (which didn't need rolling). The round sandwich bread looks like mushroom caps as you can see in my photo. This is a keeper!
