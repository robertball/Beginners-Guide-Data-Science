These came out very good! I made a smaller version using a packet of brownie mix for an 8x8 pan and baked at 325degF, for ~25 min. I topped with Andes' peppermint crunch mints (white with pink top and red bottom). I was a little leary while spreading them, but I just worked at it for few minutes using a small off-set spatula helped. The 'frosting' layer was pinkish in color. Right away, I topped with holiday-colored jimmies. I cut these into very small squares (they're rich) at about 2 hours.  I didn't want to wait the four hours, as I was afraid they might be hard to get out. They look so festive! Plan to bring tomorrow for a volunteer mailing that I'm doing.

I made these a while ago and forgot to leave a review.  I used my favorite brownie recipe and topped with the Andes Mints Baking Pieces.  They're delicious and minty.  I love the combination of mint and chocolate.
