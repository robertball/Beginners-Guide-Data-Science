Great sandwich! I used laughing cow herb and garlic spread and light Cheddar cheese. I also used an onion bagel that I lightly toasted - this was perfect for a light lunch.

Made as directed the 1st time.  Well, minus the cheese (personal preference).  Really enjoyed.  Had again tonight for a light supper and made a few variations as to some fresh veggies I needed to use before I left town.  I added fresh sliced tomatoes, thin slices of a sweet onion, basil from my garden and a handful of fresh spinach I had left on a whole wheat bagel.  Very tasty and refreshing whether as written or using your own variations.  Thanks for the recipe idea for a light and healthy alternative to a burger.

Very tasty, a nice change from the usual ham sandwich I take to work. I used garden vegetable cream cheese and it tasted great!

Very delicious! I did not toast my bagel, but I wish I would have. It got a little soggy after sitting for while without toasting. I used a sesame bagel, low-fat garden vegetable cream cheese, spinach leaves, sliced tomato, sliced pickles, and colby jack cheese. You can really use any veggies you like. Great idea!

Nice little sandwich--something I might have done on my own, but with mustard, not cream cheese.  I had some leftover cream cheese, though, and thought I'd try it.  I only had meunster, not chedder, but it worked well.  I didn't have enough cream cheese and this sandwich really needs some "glue" on both sides, so I did end up adding my mustard on the top bagel half.  Thanks!  Very good!  Good way to get veggies and feel a little better about not eating too much fat!

Just what I needed today to round out a lunch of Taco Soup. I cut this one sandwich in half to share with my husband. I used an Everything Bagel and I added a couple slices fresh tomato and I made my own herb and garlic cream cheese out of reduced fat cream cheese and spices and fresh garlic. Thanks for sharing this--we're quite tight on money but even so, we didn't miss the meat and we were quite fulfilled. Thanks, veggielovinhippie!

I made this almost exactly as is, but used Swiss Cheese because I already had some sliced.  This was very good!  Definitely agree with other reviewers that this is too messy for a packed lunch unless you pack the pieces separately and assemble at work/school.  Great, east everyday vegetarian lunch!

I loved the flavor combinations in this unique sandwich. I like to use whole grain deli thin sandwich bread and broil the cheddar cheese on the bread. I always eat this sandwich as soon as it's made. Not sure it would pack well.

Good basic sandwich idea. Easy to change up to suit your taste or just for some lunch variety. Good vegetarian bag lunch item. I put the veggies in a plastic bag and took them separately so they would not make the sandwich soggy. Just assemble before eating.

Amazing sandwich. Very easy and tasty. A great alternative for a light lunch. Going to experiment with the bagels and cheese; next time Colby Jack! I used plain cream cheese and added some pepper and basil. Thanks!

I've eaten one of these every day since I discovered this recipe! Perfect for taking in my lunch to school or as a quick breakfast. Sometimes if I'm feeling sassy I'll add half a mashed avocado.

This is a great idea. I toasted a plain bagel, then spread with mayonnaise and topped with shredded carrot, arugula, and lettuce. Next time I'll also add slices of bell pepper. My family really likes bagels, so this will be a regular lunch.
