This pie is a wonderful treat- looks amazing and tastes delish. I used a chunk of pumpkin instead of butternut squash.  I also put it in 2 pie shells when I made it for Thanksgiving.  (It was too much filling for just one). Everyone loved it!

we love this recipe.  I skip the brown sugar and the sweet potato, although now that sweet potatos are in season I will try it, but I will still leave out the sugar.  I also add walnuts and up the salt to 1tsp because I use sea salt.  I don't ususaly swirl the contents, but keep it layered.  I buy large butternut squash and freeze the mixture to make it all winter long.  I sometimes substitute sour cream or Greek yogurt for the cream, depending on what ingredients I already have.

I thought this was pretty tasty, although I would perhaps have preferred it with a little less brown sugar. I would call the texture more of a souffle than a quiche, though. (Not a complaint - just a comment.) I did think that perhaps it was a little more time-consuming to make than it was worth. I'm not sure I'd make it again, although I would certainly eat it again if someone else made it. I did like the green and orange marbling, it was very colorful.

I usually like veggie dishes, and like to try new and different recipes, but this just wasn't yummy.  Sorry.

This is good but I agree with the other rater that it is more like a souffle. It almost seems more appropriate as a dessert instead of a main dish quiche.

This quiche was extraordinary!  I used a pre-made frozen organic spelt pie crust, I used two packets of stevia instead of the brown sugar because we are trying to cut down on sugar, I used one medium yam which I microwaved and then mashed in with a can of organic pumpkin and I used garam masala seasoning which basically has everything you need except the curry.  I used raw whole milk but I might try coconut milk next time.  It is the best quiche I have ever made!  I also used about half the spinach.  Really divine!

The reaction was split in our house.  I liked it but most thought is should have a crust... I will do it again but with a crust.

Good, this is like nothing I have ever made before.  I added ground up garbanzos instead of the bread crumbs to the spinach layer.  I think it would be even better if you spread it on a cookie sheet so that it could get crispy.  This is so colorful, it is amazing to think that it is completely natural.

Not sure how to rate this dish since I made some major changes to the recipe.  I wanted something more savory than sweet and went with a previous reviewer's suggestion of leaving out the sugar.  In addition, I added more cumin, salt and some cayenne pepper to bring out some savory flavors.  I also put it in a pie crust.  I liked the resulting pie but concure with others that this isn't a quiche at all.  Also, next time I'll mix the two layers together since I wasn't wild about how the textures contrasted when they were divided.  Good base though from which to start. Perfect for autumn! Thanks!

It was tasty but not a quiche and not a meal.  More like a thanksgiving side dish.

I really like this stuff! It's great to find good vegetarian recipes that omnivore types will eat, I find that many people who eat meat eat a lot of bland or unhealthy sides. So if I can find a meal that others will eat without groveling over the lack of meat, I can usually trust that the dish is a repeat. This is definitely a repeat recipe!
