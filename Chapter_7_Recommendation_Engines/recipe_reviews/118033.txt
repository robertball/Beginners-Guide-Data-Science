I've made this several times now, it has become one of our favorites.  I don't have any fresh herbs so I use dried.

I make this soup all the time.  The balsamic vinegar is what gives this soup a very unique flavor.  I use dried herbs and whatever veggies I have on hand which goes to versatility.  I also add either rice or egg noodles.  I use olive oil in place of canola but either works. I give it five stars- it's healthy, versatile, tasty and easy to make.

Soup is worth trying.  I improvised as I was limited on the items I had on hand.  Salt & pepper steak and then saute along with garlic.  Microwave carrots & potatoes until half done...adding thyme to them for flavor. I didn't have any onions, but used a can of campbells french onion soup.  Add 1 tsp worchestire sauce.  Add chopped tomato.  Add beef bouillion if needed.  This really turned out to be a very flavorful soup.

This dish was GREAT! I made it easy by throwing all the ingredients into the slow cooker and cooking on high for 4 hours. I used dried herbs, halved the amount of balsamic vinegar, and added an additional cup of beef broth to ensure there was enough liquid in the crock pot (had to increase the spices accordingly). I topped it with freshly grated parmesan cheese to serve! Definitely a make again meal!

Delicious soup, although it turned out more like a stew. The fresh herbs really do make this great.

This was very good.  I had some leftover cooked steak so I decided to use it in this. I added garlic and used my slow cooker. Had fresh parsley and green onions but subbed dried for the other herbs. I recommend adding the garlic.

It's great but I would add more broth for it to be more like a soup. I also used burgundy spoon steak and I didn't use the balsamic vinegar.

Tried this one tonight - It was really good.  Any vegetable soup may be customized to the cooks taste and I did just that.  I added some additional veggies; corn and green beans.  I also added canned carrots instead of fresh (reduce cooking time) I am used to vegetable soup having some ype of tomato - so I added a small can of tomato sauce which for me, really made it.  I also added some additonal buyon cubes because the beefy taste wasnt up to par for me.  I was confused as to why the recipe calls to cook the meat through before adding everything else... the potatoes need time to cook therefore if the meat stayed on the pot slightly raw - I knew it would cook.  I did just that.  Lastly, not  a fan of the balsamic - will not use that next tme.

Thanks for sharing the recipe - great as is or great foudnation for the experimental cook!  I will be making this again!

Delish!  I added more beef broth because I like my stews brothier.  I also diced everything really small and bite size.  All the herbs were tied into a cheese cloth!!  I will make again soon!

We loved this soup. It is so quick to make.  It is so flavorful it seems liked you cooked it all day!  I will make it again and again.  I used dried herbs, frozen green beans instead of frozen peas, thickened it a tad, added two chopped Roma tomatoes at the end.  It can only get better with age!!

The recipe was great! It was very flavorful and hearty. I made a few changes, I used a beef bouillon cube instead of can broth and I didn't add peas. I enjoyed it so much that I took some over to my neighbor and he loved it too (he's a very picky eater). Thanks for posting :)

I loved this recipe, I made it, it seemed perfect.. delish!
I'm making it again for only the second time.. and though it didn't call for it, I'm sauteing some mushrooms I have on hand to add in.. I also don't have any broth, but I have a boullion thing.. that is from the Amish restaurant not too far from here. Like boullion, but a paste like product.. tastes better than the dry kind. I know I will love it again.. I have to use the mushrooms before they go off. thanks for this recipe

Awesome. Easy & yummy. Used veggies on hand but seasonings were great & broth was yummy! All my kids ate it really well from my 15 year old son to my 18 month old daughter. :) Thanks!
