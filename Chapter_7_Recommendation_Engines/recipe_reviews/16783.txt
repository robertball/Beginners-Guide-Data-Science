This was the best chocolate chip cookie recipe i've ever tried. I love the texture of the rolled oats. I used mixed nuts instead of almonds and it worked well. Another time I tried using P.B. chips. It's true... whatever you do to them they turn out great! They're crisp on the outside but really chewy inside. yum! =Ãž

These were sooo awesome. I'm not even an oatmeal cookie fan but these have turned me around. I made a batch last week and they didn't last long. I've been craving them ever since. I'm trying them with coconut next time and I'm sure it'll be terrific. Thanks!!

This recipe is wonderful. I actually substituted wheat flour for half of the flour. They came out so soft and delicious. My family gobbled them up.

I added about 1/4 cup more flour (which I always do when making chocolate chip cookies) to make them less "flat" and rise a bit more. Also used butterscotch morsels in place of semisweet chips. These were perfect - not flat at all and the taste was great! I also used splenda sugar substitute in place of white sugar. Yum Yum. Thanks for sharing Anna Banana!

I thought this recipe was just awful. The cookies were flat and goey. I'm wondering if something is wrong with the recipe because the directions talk about adding almonds. I didn't see this anywhere in the list of ingredients. Maybe I'm missing something??

These cookies are great! I make them quite often and they always turn out great. I was so glad to find an oatmeal cookie recipe that did not spread out all over the pan. They hold their shape but do flatten just enough. They are soft and chewy. I usually make them without any chips or nuts that is the way my family likes them and they are still great. Thanks Anna!

REALLY good cookies! Next time i might add some cinnamon and/or nutmeg but they don't need it. Also...make sure you make the spponsful SMALL and spaced far enough apart. i didn't. and they spread into each other. But i LOVED them and so did my family...i will DEFINATELY make these again. they are very similar to regular choc. chip cookies but the oatmeal makes them "healthier." yeah that's it...

These are the BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookies ever! I followed the recipe exactly only adding 1/2 tsp. of cinnamon. This is one of my favorite cookies. We couldn't stop eating them. Thank you for a fantastic recipe!

Because I make sweets for diabetics and borderline diabetics, I substituted 1 cup Splenda sugar, 1 cup Splenda blend and 1 cup of Hersheys Sugar Free Chocolate Chips for the regular sugar, brown sugar and chocolate chips.
Result:  No one could tell that they were basically sugar free.  The cookies are soft, the chocolate chips remain firm, so when
you bite into them, it's happiness in your mouth.
I will definitely make these again and again.

I made these as directed except I didn't add the almonds. They were terrific! My whole family loved them even my husband who is not an oatmeal cookie fan. I overcooked a pan or two and we decided we preferred the overcooked cookies. I'm about to make them for the second time but since I now know that we love them it'll be a double batch for sure! Thanks Anna Banana.

Delicious!!! The first time I made these I too added more flour--except I ended up adding 1/2 c. I made these again last night forgetting I didn't have enough oats. I had a little over a cup. So I just dumped in another 1/2 to 3/4 c. of wheat flour until the consistency looked right. And they still tasted delicious! I like how versatile this recipe is I used butterscotch chips and added the little bit of leftover chopped pecans I had into them to make them a little "chunkier" cookies. YUM.

I guess I just expected better from all the reviews. I made them just as directed - but found the first batch to be very flat. I refrigerated the remaining dough overnight and tried again but some flattened some wouldn't get done just remained wet and doughy on the inside and really brown outside. There are better recipes for oatmeal cookies out there.

I've been searching for the past 5 years for an Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe that my husband approved of that reminded him of the cookies him mom made when he was growing up. He LOVES this recipe in fact I've only been able to actually BAKE the cookies once. He always eats the dough before I get to baking it. These are very delicious and now friends at his work are asking for the recipe!

These have literally become my signature cookie. I make them for every bake sale for school or sports and they sell out quickly.  My college age daughter and her friends request them in care packages. Cannot begin to share how wonderful these cookies taste.

these are fantastic!!! I couldn t find any baking powder nor brown sugar so I used 2 cups white sugar and an extra pinch of baking soda. I also used an 3/4 cup almond meal. They came out flat but they are absolutely marvellous!!!! I like them most when they are still warm tastes as if almond paste is included:) thank you so much!!!!
