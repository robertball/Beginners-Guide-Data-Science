No "ifs, ands or buts" about it - this is absolutely a beautiful, 5-star perfect dish and frankly, I'm surprised more people haven't discovered it.  I added some garlic along with the onion and doubled up on the sauce but I didn't and wouldn't alter anything else about this recipe at all.  Why mess with perfection? Everything is right with this recipe from the ingredients, to the instructions for its preparation, to the cooking time. And it is just SO delicious!  The chicken is moist and tender and the sauce rich and velvety smooth, with well chosen ingredients that all combine into something simply sublime - how can you go wrong with a sauce made pf chicken broth,wine, Dijon, sour cream and tarragon?  Hubs and I were really impressed - but more important, we thoroughly enjoyed every bite.

I will make this again. I do think that pounding the chicken breasts flat and adding mushrooms would be good improvements, but, as-is, the recipe is a keeper. FYI, I made the same amount of sauce for half the amount of chicken, and I am glad I did.

This recipe is wonderful.  The marriage of dijon and tarragon is rich, yet not overwhelming.  As other reviewers suggested, I added mushrooms.  Great for texture and additional flavor.  One caution, the sauce reduces very quickly - next time I will double the sauce ingredients and increase the amount of sour cream.  Served this over homemade egg noodles.  My guests had many compliments.  This is a keeper.

This recipe was a hit at our house. Next time I will add mushrooms for texture. I served it with cous cous and steamed broccoli. There is enough sauce to dress up the broccoli even for veggie haters to enjoy!

I thought this was just OK.  The chicken was very juicy and tender, I flattened the breasts out a bit with a mallet because they were really thick.  The sauce was very easy, but didn't taste as good as I had hoped.  I don't think the combination of tarragon and mustard worked too well, I might try it again with some mushrooms and without the mustard.

I have not tried this yet, but I love tarragon with chicken. And I noticed this is a fairly healthy recipe. I wish all recipes would post more healthy recipes, some that come across here are to high in sodium, cholesterol and fats.

Super easy. Super delicious. Will be making this again for sure!  Tip: Be sure to not fry your chicken in a nonstick pan.

I have made this twice now.  Once with BLSL breasts and once with BLSL thighs and I have to say I liked the thighs better.  They have more flavor than the breasts and blend with the sauce beautifully.  I suggest making rice or mashed potatoes so you can take advantage of the extra sauce because it does make a lot.  Thanks, Blancdeblanc, this is a keeper.

Wow, this was yummy!  Per PP's comments, I pounded the chicken breasts flat and doubled the sauce - so glad I did!  I served this over couscous and it was so good!

Easy and quick to make, and my family ate them up. Nobody was wowed, though. The sauce was a little thin, so I might add some cornstarch next time. Thanks!

I must have done something wrong.  I reread the other reviews and everyone else loved it.  My chicken was nice and crispy until I put it back in the sauce to finish cooking then became all soft.  My sauce was thick enough, not much of it though.  The problem may have been I made it early & then just reheated when hubby was ready to eat.  If I try it again I'd just fry the chicken completely then make the sauce to put over it.  Not sure I'll try again though.  My hubby prefers the Honey Lime Chicken on this site and compares all other chicken recipes to that one.

Maybe it was just the mustard I used, but it was an odd combination of flavors that did not go well. Recipe is easy to follow, and no esoteric ingredients, but still the overall effect was rather odd on the palate.

This was expensive restaurant yummy.  We doubled the sauce and added garlic to the onion, but otherwise didn’t change anything.  We all loved it, including my 2,3, and 4 year old.

This dish was tasty and used the leftovers in a chicken soup and it was great. The only problem I had was with the cooking time. I had to cook the chicken 15-20 minutes when returning it to the pan or it would have been way underdone.

Very good & easy! I did pound out the chicken breasts for an even cook. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. The flavor combination was very tasty. I sliced and fantailed the chicken & poured the sauce on top for serving. I will make a gain.

I needed dinner on the table in 30minutes and this fit the bill.  I also doubled the sauce - it's too good not to.  The mustard and the tarragon blend beautifully.

I substituted gluten and dairy free for the flour and sour cream and it held up on taste and texture.

absolutely terrific! I added shallot instead of onion and I added garlic powder and parsley to the sauce.  I also increased the amounts of broth and wine and sour cream to make a lot of sauce.  this reminded me of a recipe Mt mother used to make it was delicious!

Very tasty and easy.  I was out of Dijon, so used spicy brown mustard instead (but cut the amount by about a third).  I also used vermouth instead white wine and plain Greek yogurt instead of the sour cream.  It turned out beautifully.  
Don't skimp on the amount of sauce, you'll want every drop.

I've made this at least a dozen times and love it! My tip - If you make this for just two people (two chicken breasts), keep the entire sauce recipe the same. I like to smother the chicken with it.

This was amazing.    I loved it and so did my husband.   The kids were so-so, I think because of the tarragon flavor which is unfamiliar to them.     I also added a bunch of mushrooms into the sauce, which really made it good.

Holy smokes is this good! I, too, doubled the sauce recipe then added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch to thicken. I meant to add mushrooms as some others have, but forgot to get them at the store. Just gives me an excuse to make this again.

Great for a wonderful week night meal! My family loved it! I didn't intentionally make any changes but forgot the mustard and it still turned out fabulous! I served it with mashed potatoes, green beans and French knots. I will make it again but plan to add mushrooms just because I like them, not because something is missing.

This recipe is delicious. I doubled the sauce as other reviewers suggested and it was amazing. I also added a lot more tarragon because I love the taste of it and I used dried herbs. I will definitely be adding this into my rotation.

Made exactly as written with the exception of my adding mushrooms.  This is a wonderful recipe and is one of the top five recipes I have gotten on this site.  My husband and 35 year old son raved about this chicken and I would not hesitate to serve it to anyone.  Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

Oh My!  What an absolutely delicious dish. Unlike my DH, I prefer dark meat only because the white meat tends to be dry and unappetizing to me but in this dish the breast were very moist and tender.  It was the best chicken I have ever eaten and the sauce was perfect.  I did add some garlic and I would probably double the sauce next time as both I and my DH loved it.  This dish would impress any guests you might have.
