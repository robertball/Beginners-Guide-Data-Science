Hubby and I just loved this and it was a fine accompaniment to the roast chicken I served with it. I used orange and yellow bell peppers rather than the green for a little extra color and used chopped green onion for the chives called for.  Since I didn't have pimientos on hand, roasted red peppers were a perfect substitute. I made no other changes and found it just perfect, with a pretty color contrast and a great balance of flavors.

This is a good, cheesy side dish.  It went well with a roast and peas.  I'm not sure why the other reviewers mention their onion prep, since the recipe doesn't call for any. I stayed true to form, except I had no peppers.  It works and is tasty. Don't skip the pimentos; they balance out all the cheese. Mixing in my stand-up gave it great texture.

My family loved this casserole!  It's even tasty warmed up the next day.  I can see where it would be a perfect Christmas side dish.  Thank you for sharing!

Good taste but not sure if I would make again as there are other recipes that I like better.  Thanks for letting me try.

Me and my husband did not care for this casserole. We weren't sure if it was the cream cheese but it had a bad aftertaste!

Yummy.  No pepper or pimento as I don't like either (and green pepper seems an odd thing to put in potatos).  I too don't get all the comments about onion when it's not in the recipe.  I used a mixer to mash them, both the potatoes alone to start, and then after adding everything else and they came out really smooth, which is how I like them.  I thinking baking them must've been part of the key cause they were quite boring before they went in the oven and I wasn't expecting much, but really good when they came back out.  A bit like twice-baked potatoes.  Went well with chicken.  This is 12 *small* servings and I really would want bigger servings of this. :)

Nice. I used the lowfat cream cheese, half the butter, FF half and half and Cracker Barrel 2% extra sharp white cheddar. I did use red pepper instead of green. Everything, aside from the produce that I bought at my local produce stand, was bought for cheap at Grocery Outlet so I didn't break the bank buying the extras. I did add  a little dijon and Frank's Hot Sauce. As is, it's a great side dish to marinaded steak. NOTE: I did chunky mash them so there was a variety of textures. I'd like to add sliced onion next time, maybe a little garlic.

Unbelievably good!! I halved the recipe(& left out the pimientos), thinking only 3 out of 6 of us would eat it & everyone ate & loved it(including my 4 & 5 yr olds). These will be a regular side for us!!

a great alternative to traditional mashed potatos, I added heavy whipping cream in place of the milk--turned out even creamier.  a family favorite!

Yumm...Yumm..scrumptious potato recipe was fabulous with our hot and juicy deep fried turkey. We will definitely have it over and over again. How devine. My husband is a top five rated chef and he even approved. 5 Stars all the way.

This was awesome, and everyone absolutley loved it.  I added a 1/4 cup of bacon bits, but otherwise made it just as it was written.  I almost didn't choose this recipe though as the current picture looks very unappetizing.  How does one go about changing the picture?

I think this casserole misses the mark.  I thought the list of ingredients would produce a rich and flavorful dish, but they resulted in a disappointing so-so result.  Not one guest asked me for the receipe, which I take as a sign of low appeal over a broad a spectrum of tastes.

This is a fantastic recipe, but since we have friends who are fatally allergic to onions, chives, and garlic, we have to omit them. I sprinkle spinach throughout the casserole, too. I like the heavy cream instead of the milk as another poster suggested  or jarred or homemade Alfredo sauce. Instead of pimientos, we just use red peppers.   Making it for my family, I would add the onions garlic, and chives and maybe and ground meat, too.

I have been cooking this recipe for Thanksgiving since 2009 and it is now a family tradition.  I cook it as is but sometimes I add more cheddar cheese because we like cheese!  I always get compliments and the recipe requested!  I'm so appreciative for this share! :)

I took this to a potluck Christmas gathering the first time I made it and everyone loved it. I microwaved the green pepper for a minute to soften. Next time I would add a little more milk to make it a bit creamier.
