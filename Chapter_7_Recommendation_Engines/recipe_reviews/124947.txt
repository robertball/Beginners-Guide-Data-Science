This is a fantastic salad! We used fresh lime juice rather than lemon juice & was "generous" with the seasonings and hot sauce in the dressing.  In the salad we added black beans, fresh corn, hot peppers, & celery (left out the shrimp). At serving time, we crumbled the corn chips over top and then we added  some diced avocado & a little  salsa.  Served with cheese quesadillas (yum!) Will be making this often!  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

This was a nice twist of a salad to serve with Mexican dishes. I made a few changes and was pleased with how the dish came out:
- I used shredded taco lettuce instead of torn leaves and used halved grape tomatoes. It made it more of a slaw so the bites were finer than they would have been as a standard salad.
- Since it was a side dish, I didn't use shrimp or tuna.
- I didn't find the dressing to offer enough coverage (and I think that's because of my shredded lettuce choice), so I added about a quarter cup of ranch dressing to the food processor once I made the dressing.
- We all agreed that the dressing needed a teensy bit more zip - some thought vinegar, others more hot sauce or chili powder.

But, all in all, it was a pretty salad that appealed to both our men and women guests.

This was great!  I probably added more spice then the recipe called for, and had to add a touch more oil to thin the dressing enough to get it out of the blender.  But it was excellent and very easy!

I didn't have shrimp but did have a freezer full of chicken, so I sauteed a couple of breasts with all-purpose poultry seasoning, shredded, and threw in with all of the stray salad fixings from the fridge.

From defrosting the chicken to serving wsa a total of about 15 minutes... perfect for after work.

Great salad. I used olive oil in place of the veg oil, added some cumin and used fat free sour cream and reduced fat cheddar cheese to  lower the caloric value. Very filling and satisfying meal!

I don't eat shrimp, so I used the tuna suggestion instead. Otherwise made exactly as the recipe says and it was delicious. A nice alternative to a traditional taco salad. My husband does not like salads as a whole meal, but this one filled him up.

pretty good, but i do prefer the "california salad bowl" recipe from this site; it's similar but has no shrimp, which i don't see the need for in this salad.

The dressing was delicious, and I will definitely use it again. But I enjoyed the extras to the lettuce so much that I think I will double up on those and add some cubed avocado and black beans like others have suggested to make it a nice chunky salad. Thanks for sharing!

My family all loved this recipe just as written.  The avocado dressing was fantastic and the shrimp was a great addition.  I will definitely make this again.

The dressing is KILLER. Used a little extra avocado (one whole small one) and additional Greek yogurt (instead of sour cream). As for the actual salad components, we left out the shrimps (ate tuna sandwiches on the side) and had to sub mozza for the cheddar. Definitely use cheddar, and highly recommend green olives instead of the black we used (kinda clashed the other flavours). Add the crushed corn chips on the individual serving after tossing the rest of the salad stuff with the dressing.

This weekend I made a layered chicken enchilada dish to serve a crowd so I doubled this salad without the shrimp. The only other change was I used halved and seeded grape tomatoes in place of the wedges. It was excellent, everyone loved it, even the kids! They really liked having Fritos in salad and it was easy for them to pick out the tomatoes and black olive slices if they didn't like them. After seconds the bowl was empty, this is definitely a keeper!

This is my mom's recipe and she used to make this for company when I was a kid -- It is as good as she says it is and has always been a hit for parties because it is different and not what people expect!
