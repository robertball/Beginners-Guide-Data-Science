These are good - nothing wrong with them, but hardly anything special about them either. It's just an average (what I call 3-stars) cheesecake bar with swirls. I didn't want lemon competing with the strawberry flavor so I cut the lemon juice back to maybe just about 1-1/2 tablespoons and I was pleased with just the hint of lemon that lent.  I had frozen strawberries that I cooked and thickened with sugar, cornstarch and a little water, then pressed through a wire sieve - didn't bother with the blender.  But I don't think this basic, ordinary cheesecake bar was worth the extra effort of making the strawberry sauce.  Regular ol' strawberry jam would have worked just as well.

I couldn't find any frozen strawberries in syrup, so I used frozen strawberries, smashed and thickened it up with the corn starch and sugar.  SO good!  The cinnamon graham crackers gave it a nice kick!!
In case you don't have condensed milk:
2 eggs
1 c. brown sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
2 tbsp. flour
1/2 tsp. baking powder
1/4 tsp. salt
Mix all ingredients and use as a substitute for sweetened condensed milk.

Ingredients for Strawberries in Syrup: 
2 cup Strawberries (loosely packed; fresh or frozen)
1/8 cup white sugar
1 tBS cornstarch (disolved in a little water)
Instructions: 
1. Cut strawberries into halves or quarters (depending on preference; if the strawberries are fairly small you may leave them whole).
2. Place strawberries in a saucepan and pour sugar on top and place on burner set between medium and medium-low.
3. The mixture will slowly become watery at which point you can set the burner to medium. Once the mixture begins to boil add dissolved cornstarch while stirring the mixture.
4. After boiling for 1-2 minutes (remember to continue stirring) you can remove from the burner.
The syrup can be used hot or can be refrigerated and used cold, depending on your preference.

This recipe is great! Made it earlier this week and had to freeze part of it to keep from eating it all myself. I liked when it was warm and cooled the next day.

I agree that these are best when they are REALLY cool. I preferred mine the next day as well. They are delicious and were a huge hit with my guests. Took longer to prepare than I had expected, but definitely worth it! I'll make these again.

I had to bake it longer, for a total of 36 or 37 minutes.  Tastes good.  Mine is not as pretty as the photo, which looks more like raspberry than strawberry to me.  I had extra strawberry sauce to put on top when serving which helped appearance.

Really great recipe!  I followed it exactly, and it turned out wonderful for company, and so pretty.  So much easier than dealing with a springform pan, and the serving size can be easily varied.  I will be making this again.

wow! So easy! I haven't eaten any yet, but it only took me 10 minutes to make- pretty too! I'm making a 5-layer cake with 3 devils food cake and 2 of strawberry swirls. I wanted a fresher taste so I used fresh strawberries, pureed with sugar and microwaved for 2m. The batter tastes nice and light too, which is perfect for what I am making it for! Will update with how it tastes :) ! :) !

These bars are absolutely delicious! I didn't have any strawberries is syrup, only plain berries, so I used about 8 oz. of the berries, and added some sugar and a little water to make 10 oz. This worked really well! I also didn't have any cinnamon graham crackers, so I used plain instead. In my opinion, there were too many crumbs/not enough butter, because the crust didn't hold together at all. I baked just the crust for about 7 minutes so that it wouldn't fall to pieces when I poured in the filling. I also lined my pan with Reynold's Release foil, so that I could pull the bars right out of the pan, and cut them flat to get even squares. The finished bars were awesome, perfectly sweet and just the right amount of strawberry. I took them to a church function, and they were  the first thing to go. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it's a winner!!!

I thought these were fabulous! I'm not a cheesecake lover; but my family is and after picking fresh strawberries I was looking for creative ways to use them.  The swirls were beautiful and my husband, who is very picky, said they were restaurant quality.  Thank you for this recipe, I will definitely use again.

Turned out really good.  I used store bought Oreo crust and served it with whipped cream - got a lot of complements at our Thanksgiving table.

I made these for a potluck, and they were gone in minutes.  The only minor change I made was to use regular graham crackers instead of cinnamon.  The flavors came together very nicely, and the swirling is very pretty on these bars.

Fun and easy to make.  My office loved it.  Next time I will try making my own strawberry sauce instead of buying stawberries in syrup, which didn't taste that good.

These were very good and easy.  I used homemade strawberry jelly, put it in the microwave for a few seconds to thin the consistency and then used that for the top.  Will definitely make again.

Very good after a day of chilling.  Not good right after it's baked.  Tastes great with a little bit of spray whipped cream.  Quite rich and filling but not too sweet.  Great with coffee.

My husband and I love these bars! Way better than my old cheesecake bar cookies! I wasn't sure I'd like the condensed milk in the bars, but couldn't taste it. The filling is light and tasty. I used a 10 oz jar of organic raspberry jam instead of the berries.

I didn't have frozen strawberries so I blended 1 1/2 C. fresh strawberries w/ 1 Tbsp sugar in the food processor. It worked great but the bars could have used more of the strawberry sauce. I only used half cinnamon grahams (as it's all I had.) and original grahams for the rest. It worked fine, but I think all cinnamon would've been better. Wonderful recipe. Will definitely make again!

My husband took the leftovers to work and his fellow employees said they were the best cheesecake they'd ever had.  They are quick and easy to make.  I read the reviewers and used frozen berries that I cooked on the stovetop instead of the strawberries.

Loved them. Made these for a Bridal shower.Slimmed them down by using low fat cream cheese and lower fat condensed milk. Rave reviews by all who devoured them .

I love them. I tried not to make them too thick so I didn't use all the batter. And a tip for decorating with the swirl is to try and make lines to pour in the strawberry purée. And tge tips to add in more butter into the crust worked and putting it in the oven for like 5 minutes worked as well. It made tge crust more firm.

My daughter wanted to give this twice as many stars, she loved it so much.  We live in a country where you can't buy cheesecake and this one tasted to me like a real American cheesecake - so yummy!! We also don't get frozen strawberries but fresh ones worked quite well (with a tablespoonful of sugar added before blending).  I will definitely be making this again!

I doubled the recipe and used regular graham crumbs since i had a box.  Some reviews said not sweet enough so i cut back lemon juice and added a pinch more sugar into the crust.   Served the next day; everyone loved these at the party but I made bars mainly for ease of serving, I prefer a thick dense cheesecake.

This was delicious and simple to make. It is definitely better cold, so chill thoroughly before serving. I was missing two ingredients: cinnamon graham crackers and frozen strawberries. I used regular graham crackers, but added a sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon to them which worked fine. I had fresh strawberries, so I pureed them and added 1/4 cup sugar and a splash of water, then cooked them with the cornstarch. My bars weren't as pretty as the picture - my berries stayed foamy - but they tasted wonderful. I will make these again - I'd like to try them with the frozen berries next time.

These taste amazing! My crust doesn't always stick well, so they aren't too great to serve yet. The taste makes up for it though! I agree with the other reviews that this is much better after chilling in the fridge for a day.

We're really enjoying these.  I lightened this up by using low-fat cream cheese, fat free sweetened condensed milk, light butter and low fat graham crackers, and the bars still taste rich and decadent.  This is a keeper.

Very good. Use a little bit more butter so the crust isn't so crumbly and make sure you don't over cook the strawberry puree. But it was very tasty.

Very sweet, rich, and creamy, excellent recipe, crust was a little crumbly, but maybe a little more butter to stick it together slightly better.

We are wheat free so cheesecake is one of the few desserts we can enjoy (using wheat free graham crackers). This is a delicious cheesecake bar and its easier to make than a regular cheesecake. I have made the white chocolate rasphberry cheesecake (the one on this site that has 4000 reviews and has 5 stars )  but think that this one actually tastes better and is a lot less fussy. For example you don't have to drain the strawberry mixture, and also pressing the graham crackers only at the bottom of the pan is so much easier than up the side .  The aroma from the fresh lemon juice is wonderful.  Also i think (and hope) condensed milk must be a bit healtheir than refined white sugar!.  this cuts up very well and we served it as snacks. they were gone in no time.  YUMMY thank you

Excellent easy cheesecake bars. I used my own frozen strawberries to which I added some sugar to taste.  I did not bother to puree - mashing them in the pan worked fine. Great way to show off your strawberries in winter. Everybody raved about these.

These were a little mealy on the first day but smoother 24 hours later.  Eleven full crackers makes 1 3/4 cup crumbs.  I didn't think there was enough butter to hold the crust together, but it turned out fine.

This dessert tastes best after it is sufficiently cool (I didn't like it much the first night but the next day it was awesome). I made this low-fat by using light cream cheese, nonfat condensed milk, and strawberries sweetened with splenda. The taste was great and my husband didn't realize that it was low fat until I told him.

These were awesome!  I saw that some people in their reviews couldn't find the right strawberries, I'm no exception, so I just pureed the strawberries with homemade simple syrup (water and sugar boiled together and cooled) and everyone loved them.

Very nice. And easy, which is always a plus!  I tried these in little mini muffin tins, so I then used an 8x8 to make the rest--it took forever to bake, since I guess I really didn't use that much cream cheese!  I did not have frozen strawberries, so I used fozen raspberries instead.  I didn't have already sweetened, so I let then thaw, mixed with sugar, then mashed.  Took them to work for a birthday celebration and everyone enjoyed them.  thanks for the recipe!

A few days ago this was a favorit photo, my dayghter saw it on the website and asked if we could make that. Never one to pass up the opportunity to bake with my 4 year old or say no to cheesecake i daid yes. It only took a few minutes to put together but it did take a little bit longer to bake then stated, but my oven is old and just seems to cook things slower. We ate some last night while it was still warm, and it was good, my husband only said the it needs a better crust, (i skimped on the butter, we were almost out.) 
This morning i had some for breakfast (what can i say i was fresh out of wheaties!) and it was even better then yesterday. Although this was not as rich and creamy as the cheesecake factory it was still a smooth sweet and tangy treat. I wil make this again, but this time i wont skimp on the crust.

I really enjoyed these Cheesecake bars. My favorite part was the graham cracker crumbs on the bottom. Make sure not to overcook the strawberry puree. Overall, very yummy.

I used fresh strawberries, and I guess I didn't add enough sugar because the bars were a little sour. These are good, but compared with the actual cheese cake this is no where near that level of awesomeness.  Enjoying a good cheese every once in awhile is good for everyone.

Easy to make. I'm not a big fan of the strawberries but I'm sure it would be good without any fruit. I think next time I make this I would use a little more butter to hold the crust together to make it less crumbley

This recipe was pretty good.  I am not a strawberry person, but these were OK.  The crust was a little crumbly, so next time I would add a little more butter to the crust.  An average recipe.

If you're in the mood for real cheesecake don't make these. These were pretty good, but definitely not like the real deal (I love making homemade cheesecakes). I would suggest these to anyone who wants a cheesecake type dessert but doesn't want to put forth any real effort. They're pretty good with a chocolate graham cracker crust and raspberries instead of the strawberries too (if using chocolate graham crackers, omit the lemon juice). Double the butter for the crust and add about 1/4 cup of brown sugar if you don't want it to crumble too easily. Just understand this will make the crust sweeter and the lemon flavor might pop a bit more.

Exceptional! We made the cheesecake with frozen raspberries and as a cake in a 10" round springform pan (rather than as bars). Really excellent and easy to make. Will definitely make it again.

I used blueberries instead of strawberries because I had some in the freezer.  Like everyone else says, this is not very good right after being baked.  It is nice the next day but not sweet enough. Very rich.  I used some of the leftover blueberry puree to put over the top which made it a bit nicer.  I'm not sure if I would make this again.  Also I had to bake it much longer than is suggested until it was set properly.

These bars are excellent!  I add a bit more butter to hold the crust together.  Even though I have a lactose sensitivity, I can't help but sneak just a little bite of these bars. These are a smash hit for get togethers and work parties.

Absolutely FABULOUS! It came out a little loose after 30 minutes of cooking, so I through it in the freezer for 20 minutes. It tasted absolutely amazing! I took a test-bite and squeaked with delight; demanding my roommates to take a piece it as well!

these came out incredible! I was a little nervous about the graham crackers sticking together at first, but the measurements were spot on. They came out very creamy with the perfect hint of strawberry and they were gone in less than a day (amongst 5 people)  Just make sure they really cool down before you try and take them out of the tray We had a delicious casualty from our impatience...
