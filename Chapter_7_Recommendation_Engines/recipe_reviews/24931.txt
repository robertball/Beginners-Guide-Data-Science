excellent - I used to have a very similar recipe that I have been looking for, for a long time.  One thing that needs to be done differently is to cream together the sugar and butter before you add the bananas, so the butter doesn't "separate" when the bananas are added.  I also add a generous sprinkling of brown sugar to the top before baking to give a good sweet crunchy top to the bread.

I loved this banana bread! The texture from the nuts is wonderful. I found that after combining all the ingredients, and starting to pour the batter into the loaf pans, that there really wasn't enough for three pans. I cooked it in two, lowered the temp to 300, and baked it for an extra 15 minutes. Thanks for sharing!

I love this banana bread, and so did my family. I left out the nuts and I wound up with a wonderful, fluffy bread that my family just gobbled up.

My family loves this bread. I added 1 1/2 Tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and about 3/4 cup of chocolate chips. I then added the brown sugar on top and it was so delicious.

This banana bread reminds me of the stuff my grandmother use to make... There is so much banana flavor swarming inside it's almost unbearable. One thing I really liked is using two kinds of nuts- It was a nice change. I've made it twice. Once with the rasins and once without- both times it was wonderful.

I tried this and i thought i was terrible... I cooked it for twice the time recommended and it burnt on the outside and the inside was very doughy. it was very dense and heavy and didnt rise at all.

Very good banana bread. I did cut the recipe in half, and added a tsp. of vanilla extract (just cause I love it). Very moist and dense, and great banana flavor. Thanks!

This banana bread was a lovely reicpe to make.  It was easy to put together and the house smelled great while it cooked!  I used VREY over ripe bananas that I think deepened the flavor.  Next time I shall use vanille extract... I felt it was missing something.  But over all It's a yummy recipe.

Very good. Extremely nutty. If you don't like nuts, this one probably isn't for you. I used a full cup of mixed nuts I ran through the blender, as that's all I had on hand. This'll be great for Christmas gifts.

This was a very solid recipe. I cut it in half because I only had 5 bananas, and found that 1 pan was perfect - I would assume you only need 2 for the full recipe. I did find, however, that with 1 pan the oven temperature at 350 was too hot - I cooked the bread for about 40 minutes and found that the outside was quite brown and the top center of the loaf was still not fully cooked. Next time I will lower the oven temp to be sure that it cooks all the way through!

A little dry, but my husband still liked it much.  He toasts a slice with honey butter which adds moisture.

Really great recipe. Added chocolate chips the second time and it was amazing. Had to bake for a little bit longer though, I think I added too much dough to the pan. Brown sugar addition on the top was a great tip, my boyfriend loved it.

I used two large loaf pans that were my grandma's. This was delicious banana bread, the mixture of nuts really great. The only thing I might do different the next time I make this would be to add a little more sugar. Not quite sweet enough.  It will depend upon how ripe the bananas are. Use very ripe bananas. I used some that were ripe and a few that were very ripe. May have been better if they had all been very ripe. Froze well and will make this recipe again and again.

LOVE this! Make sure you cook it long enough. If your bananas are big, it needs more time.

This is my go to Banana Bread recipe since it is one of the few that actually uses up a lot of bananas (I always seems to have a ton of bananas in my freezer). It is a dense banana bread but that is the way we like it. I just put the nuts on top and sprinkle with brown sugar before baking.

This has become my most used recipe!  Like other reviewers, I add my own touches, like cinnamon, honey, vanilla, raisins, and almonds (instead walnuts/pecans).  I made my third batch today, and ate a piece just out of the oven, with whipped honey butter.  Thanks, TERESALOU!!

After reading other reviews I found that while I was making this recipe it was really easy to follow and turned out delicious! The key to baking it properly is using all three pans, 45 minutes in three separate pans worked great as well as mixing in 1 tablespoon of vanilla. Enjoy!

This is a wonderful recipe. I loved the nuts. Didn't have pecans so I used more walnuts. Enjoyed!!!
