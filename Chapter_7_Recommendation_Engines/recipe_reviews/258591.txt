What a great recipe! The seasoning is amazing. The method leaves you with a lovely chili even though mine was pretty thick. I served it as written in the description with onions, kidney beans, and cheese then served it over spaghetti. I should have broken the spaghetti into pieces. Serving over long spaghetti seemed more like a rag√π than a chili. Regardless, it was absolutely delicious. Thank you for the recipe.

This was amazing! I used yellow bell peppers so that they would go undetected by my kids, I also added a half cup of diced mushrooms. I used a tablespoon of cocoa instead of chocolate. My whole family ate it. I also made a vegan cheese sauce to put on top and used Banza chickpea spaghetti to make it gluten free. So delicious!
