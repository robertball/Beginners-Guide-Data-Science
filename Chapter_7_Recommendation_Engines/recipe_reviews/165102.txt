It took me back home.  I love it!  I added 1/2 tsp of fresh ground ginger and 2 of the little boxes of raisins.

favorite bread pudding recipe ever. everybody in my family raves about it. you may need to make more caramel sauce than the original calls for; i always do. this recipe makes a lot, and i use two medium-sized, round casserole dishes to make two individual puddings. doing that makes the finished product look like a giant flan; it's really very pretty.

This has to be the BEST bread pudding I have ever tasted.  Absolutely delicious.  I need to improve on my caramel abilities (I cooked it to hard crack stage) but even that did not spoil the dish.  Will make this recipe over and over again.  mlnordeste

I am Puertorrican, and this took back home.  Amazing and very authentic recipe. I used Almond extract instead of anise.  I just like the flavor better. I took one pan of puding to work, and it lasted 15 minutes.  This is yummy!! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

By far this is the best I've tried. I've been making this quite a few times for almost 2yrs now. My husband is from PR and budin is his favorite. He's been wanting some for a long time and I have tried couple of recipes until I came across this one...HE LOVES it.

This is a great recipe.  The budin turned out absolutely beautiful, even my mom asked for the recipe.  The only thing for me is that the spice tea needs to be more concentrated.  Next time I'll add more spice and maybe even some ground spice right to the egg mixture.  But overall it's very yummy!

This was very good! Everyone enjoyedjavascript:__doPostBack('ctl00$ContentPlaceholder$edit$saveButton','')! I think I put too much milk in it, so it ended up more like a flan, but still delicious.

I wanted to make it exactly as directed, but had a difficult time finding anise seed. I substituted 1 teaspoon vanilla for the anise seed and it came out excellent.

I have never had budin, but my boyfriend is from Puerto Rico & was talking about missing their fantastic bread pudding. I surprised him with this & he absolutely raved about it. Thank you for helping me bring "home" to him!

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving 2014. I recommend that this particular item be made 2 days in advance. Solely because, the flavors are outstanding and quite better the more time given to marinate as it cools. On Thanksgiving Day my mom and I decided to take a taste. It was after all my first bread pudding . My brother saw and decide to do the same 1 hour later it was practically gone. I'm Puerto Rican, it reminded my mother and I of our island. Particularly the first step, traditionally we make that spiced water as our tea when sick. I'd  give it more than 5 stars but that's all I'm allowed to give. This recipe is simply divine!

This recipe is great! my grandma use to make this pudding and I was craving it. I'm not sure what her exact recipe was but this one is very close to what I remember. I would like to try to make it with craisins instead of raisins to see how it turns out!

Good taste.  The directions were not clear on the quantity it made.  There is way more than one loaf pan's worth.

This was my first ever bread pudding and now I'm hooked. Delicious cannot even begin to describe how great this turned out.  One small note. The recipe was enough to  fill 2 loaf pans so I had to caramalize a second batch of sugar.

I decided to make this for a friend's Puerto Rican party but tried it our first at work where many of the secretaries are Puerto Rican.  They told me it was the best budin they had ever had!  I'm hoping the second try will go as well.  I made it today and added raisins to the mix.  I found I need to bake it for 1 hour 30 minutes to avoid it being wet in the center.

My PR friend made this with dried cranberries. The sweetness was just right, not overpowering or sugary, and it was delicious! I usually don't eat sweets but this was a surprise! If I make it and she's supposed to share the recipe, I'll add some rum! My mother used to make a rum cake that was to "die for"! This seems like something that I can work with. My mother's recipes were always "in her head!" Lol. I think some tradition was lost but she was totally old-school! Luv ya Mom...RIP!

This was FANTASTIC!!! The only thing I did different was I didn't cut the ends off the bread b/c I used hamburger and hot dog buns that were left over from the 4th of July - Didn't want them to go to waste. That's the only thing I did differently. This was a true hit and a keeper of a recipe.

Okay, I left out some of the spices and did not do the caramel on the bottom but followed the basic recipe.  Fantastic but overly sweet.

I love baking for my dad.  Papi loves old school Puerto Rican desserts.  I made this a couple of weeks ago and he loved it.  I’m making it again today except this time I’m doubling the recipe.  Thanks for the exact measurements!  I didn’t have to change a thing.

The bread pudding was a super big hit at the Porto Rican dinner we attended. Just delicious. My only problem, I evidently didn’t cook the caramel topping long enough because when I plated the pudding it had soaked into the cake with some still left in the pan. Edie
