Loved the seasonings. I halved the recipe and it still could have covered 10 racks.  Generously coated three racks and I have a container full still leftover. Only thing I would change next time is reduce the salt.

We tried 3 different rubs today and this was by far our favorite. The cayenne gives it a great kick. This rub brings out the flavor of the meat without being overbearing. We will use this one again.
