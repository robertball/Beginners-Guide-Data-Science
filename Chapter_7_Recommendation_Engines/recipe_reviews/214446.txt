I had a ton of vegetables leftover from our Super  Bowl festivities so I planned all along to have some sort of salad for supper tonight, especially after all of the “snacky” things we noshed on yesterday. This hit the spot and couldn’t have been more perfect had it been written just for me.  Not only did I have all the vegetables on hand, it’s a combination of vegetables I just love in a salad, particularly the cauliflower and black olives.  No feta for Hubs, but I enjoyed  the addition of it in this recipe.  As for sausage on salad, never heard of it, but why not?  I love the stuff, so it worked for me!   I don’t do bottled salad dressings, so I used my own vinegar and olive oil dressing.    All the vitamins and flavors you want and need, packed in one bowl.  Light and refreshing, delicious, and just a little different.  And it uses kielbasa!
