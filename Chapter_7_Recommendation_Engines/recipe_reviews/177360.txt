This recipe was so unusual that I couldn't resist trying it.  Even though I'm not a big fan of vinegar, I could see how these ingredients would work well together.  It was even better than I expected.  I added about a cup of chopped opinion and some Old Bay Spice.  I added the tart shrimp to a sweet corn salad.  It was fantastic.

Excellent - I saved some of the broth and dipped French bread in it to accompany the flavorful prawns.

With a good number of seasonings in this recipe, we thought the flavor profile was rather subtle. Eating these shrimp as an appetizer with a drink, we found ourselves reaching for other seasonings and/or a dipping sauce to make them tastier. This method may be better if shrimp are being added to something like a salad or main dish. Dennis, thank you for sharing.

Delicious! I was looking for a light main dish to go with a tomato pie I made and this was perfect. Followed the recipe except for a sprinkle of Old Bay on the shrimp right before eating them.
