I changed proportions slightly and used blood orange juice, triple sec and vanilla vodka.  God forbid I use Grumpy's vodka.  ;)  Anyway, this was a yummy drink.  Next time though I would use plain vodka.  I used 3 oz blood orange juice, 2 shot glasses vanilla vodka and 1 shot glass triple sec.  Went down pretty darn easy.  ;)

Added 2oz of tonic water to liven it up and made a world of difference. Also, use sweeter tangerines if you have

I actually had tangerines so was able to make this.  I found it a bit bitter tasting so added a bit more orange liqueur, and served it with ice in the glass.  This helped it taste better.   I made it with gluten free vodka, which is a great  vodka with no flavors added. It was easy to make and refreshing.
