1. Use thick several-day old bread (think Texas toast), otherwise it just falls apart from the two dips

2. Need to turn bread over in the oven and continue until dry

3. Don't cut or trim the bread before frying for two reasons: the bread fries very fast so turning over triangles result in several burnt pieces (stainless steel set on low). Second,it is much easier to trim after frying.

4. Very hard to estimate how much milk to use since it all depends on bread's thickness and density, so play by ear/taste. 

5. I used almond milk to satisfy some in our group and it was fine

6. Needs to cool until thickened so overnight should work

7. Probably would not make again - lots of work and cleanup and my Kheer and Kulfi (available in AR) are very easy and make-able the day ahead
