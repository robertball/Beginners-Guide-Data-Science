I used it with boneless skinless chicken breast and it turned out great! The wine helps keep things moist in the skillet. It was delicious!

Made as written. It was way too much lemon flavor. I’d scale this back to 1/2 a lemon- juiced.  Served it over  spinach greens which kind of saved the meal as it served as a salad dressing.
