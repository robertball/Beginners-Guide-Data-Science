My husband's grandma came from the filipines so she makes the best food. She will not share any of her recipes with anyone, I feel that my husband and children are missing out on one of their native foods so I took it upon myself to make it for them, my husband said it was just as good though. We will never tell her that though! I would recommend marinating at least 2 hours and slow cooking as long as you possibly can stretch it out without overcooking the chicken.

Would suggest using whole peppercorns and adding a tablespoon or two of sugar to cut acidity. When I cook adobo, I let it boil until the chicken is tender, then fry the chicken in a separate pan to make it crispy. I then add about half of the remaining sauce plus a few cloves of browned garlic.

I have family from the Phillipines who make this on a regular basis and have taught me how. although the recipe is good you really don't need that much vinegar unless you really like the strong flavor.  I used less and it was wonderful for me.

This is a keeper.  4 modifications I made were substituting rice vinegar instead of white vinegar, added 1 tsp of ground ginger, added 3 crushed garlic cloves and added one cup of water.  Definitely take the bay leaves out but leave the garlic in.  I let it all boil covered for 30 minutes.  This served over steamed rice was so good!  Next time I'll take the skins off to cut back on fat but thanks for this great recipe!

Finally, I have made my Filipino husband happy.  After trying to make this several other times using different recipes, I found a winner.  My husband was so impressed and I thought it tasted great.  THANK YOU!!

instead of apple  cider viniger, use seasoned gourmet rice viniger...it changes the taste to sweet instead of tangy... 
An americanized version that fil-am kids like.

Excellent chicken and a great change from southern fried chicken. I found the garlic rice on this site a great side to this chicken and felt like I was eating in a Philippine restaurant.

This was pretty good- two things I'll do differently next time:
1.  Cook it in the crock pot (We were wishing it was a bit more tender).
2.  Add something to thicken the sauce into a gravy (flour or xanthan gum).  I ended up grabbing some turkey gravy powder and throwing that in to thicken up the watery sauce, and that was good but pretty salty!
Other than that, it had a wonderful flavor and I'll make it again!

This was my first time making Chicken Adobo..and I must admit, it has a taste that requires a little getting used to.  My older kids hated it (that includes the Hubby).  I will try it again and adjust the vinegar and soy and see if I can come up with a compromise they like. Otherwise this is a dish for me and the baby....he will eat almost anything and I am always looking for a new exciting way to cook chicken. :-)

actually there are different ways of cooking adobo. each is unique and equally delicious, depending on the taster. believe me, i've been cooking this dish since i was 10 and it's the first dish i learned to cook. if you think ordinary vinegar with high amount of acidity is overwhelming, try using balsamic. and if you like a little variety put oystersauce to thicken the sauce. i would sometimes add red wine, if i want a fancier version. if you use wine cut down on the vinegar. one tip for beginners you dont have to follow the exact amount of seasonings like salt, pepper, vinegar, soy sauce. to each his own. try tasting as you go along, you can always add. and when you're dealing with vinegar, wait for the mixture to boil til you stir or else you'll end up having uncooked vinegar in your dish. sometimes that's the reason for the overpowering smell even if the dish is already cooked.

My whole family liked this one.......a lot. My daughter tore into like there was no tomorrow. You'd have thought it was a last meal or something but she is a big fan of chicken. This is a really good change of taste from the same ol' same ol'. Very good thank you.

We thought this was very good.  The chicken was fall apart tender.  I didn't remove the garlic after browning it and it was yummy that way.  Next time I will probably cut down the vinegar a little and use low sodium soy sauce.  It was pretty strong and very salty.  It was still very good and I will definitely make this again!

This is the second time I made this recipe...don't know what I did different but it came out better than the first time.  My ex came over the night after, ate the leftovers, and DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME...hahahaha :)
Oh yeah...instead of using a whole chicken cut into pieces, I use Tyson frozen chicken wings...they are smaller and much easier to cook with.  Try it!

First let me state that I used 3 recipes to make Chicken Adobo. I started with Traci's Adobo Seasoning with Adobo Chicken with Ginger. I boiled everything together and waited until the chicken was tender. I added potatoes and cooked until done. Then I drained half the broth, fried some onions, and continued to make this recipe. So far, this is the closest way to get the Chicken Adobo to taste just like my grandma's.

I really thought there would be more flavor to this dish, but it's almost like all the ingredients cancelled each other out. Maybe I needed to marinade it longer, but overall feel that the flavor could have been a bit stronger.

This was very enjoyable. Not having the apple cider vinegar I subbed with rice vinegar. I think that was a good choice. It wasn't acidic as others stated. Quite good! I marinated it for about an hour before putting the chicken in the skillet. It took more like 45 minutes than 20 minutes to cook but it sure made the house smell good! Will use again. Thanks for the post!

I added more things for this recipe:onions, to make it more flavorful, red pepper flakes, because I like spicy, and I added brown sugar to make it a little bit sweeter. I also added ginger and lemon grass. Hmmm.. So good! I will definitely make it again..

The dark meat and the flavor of the sauce was excellent (I did add 1/4 c of water as many reviewers suggested). The breast came out a little too dry for my liking. I think I'll follow a few of the other reviewer's suggestions and cook more slowly next time. Maybe even in a slow cooker.

Really easy and excellent! My sauce was a bit strong (I didn't really measure out the vinegar/soy sauce) so I added water and thickened the sauce with a mix of some more water and cornstarch.

I am willing to try this recipe. Although, when I make my Chicken Adobo. I add all the ingredients to the pot, minus the oil, and slowly let the chicken cook on medium heat. I've learned to use Aloha Shoyu. It's my Hawaiian roots, it gives it a better taste, than if you were to use kikoman or any other version....I also use chicken thighs, with the bones, but you can also use boneless chicken thights....

I love adobo I have tried other recipes in the past from this site but this is by far the best one.  I made a few modifications I added about a tsp of fresh grated ginger to the sauce, I used about 15-20 whole peppercorns, I used tysons frozen chicken wings (as suggested by another reviewer)and I marinated the chicken for about 5 hrs.  Thanks for the wonderful adobo recipes.

Basically very good. Maybe remove skin from chicken to reduce fat content of dish. I didn't find it necessary to take the garlic out of the pan before frying the chicken. It's quite salty, so it goes well with steamed vegetables.

This recipe was really good!  I used 3lbs of bone-in drumsticks and bone-in thighs, and will definitely use only bone-in thighs in the future.  Equal parts apple cider vinegar to low sodium soy sauce turned out great, despite some other reviews.  We also added a little more garlic (3 cloves total) and ginger and it turned out great.

I used 8 skinless bone-in chicken thighs, 3 garlic cloves (left them in), and a sprinkle of sugar, simmered for an hour. Those were the only changes.  Thanks for a simple, tasty recipe!

Excellent recipe. I modified by browning the chicken first and I used an entire head of garlic. Simple and the family loved it. The family pack of chicken thighs was gobbled up. That is 3 per family member! 10 thumbs up from my family.

Tried this recipe out today and my filipino friend loooved it, and he is a mighty good cook. He even said my adobo was better than his! It was really simple to make, the only change I made was to use the rice vinegar instead. I will definately be making this again.

I am always looking for chicken recipes and thought this one sounded interesting. I loved it. (I forgot bay leaves so that will be for next time). I served it over noodles and loved the sauce and the chicken. I used just skinless thighs - wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a skin-on or skin-off recipe. Will definitely make again.

I learned to love chicken adobo while in the Navy... and I loved this!  I actually use a little more soy than vinegar and throw it all in a crock pot with a game hen, then pour it over steamed rice.  Delicious!

I hadn't had chicken adobo in over 20 years. This was so fantastic, I can't believe it took me this long to make it. I made exactly to recipe except that I used rice vinegar instead of apple cider vinegar. This will definitely be in my regular rotation.

It tells you to brown the garlic, and then take it out, but never tells you to do anything with the garlic after that. Does not tell you how long the wings should marinate. The picture shown is a poorly browned chicken wing, It looks more poached than pan fried. I did the best I could with the directions being as they are, It tasted Ok, But should stay in the marinade for a bit to pickup the marinade flavor.

My young son goes to a Filipina daycare provider. For months he was bugging me to make "chicken adouble"! I finally figured out he was talking about the Filipino chicken adobo! I found this recipe, and he loves it! So does the rest of the family. I was really skeptical about that much soy sauce and vinegar being overpowering, but it is actually fairly mild after it has cooked for a while. I make a double batch of soy/vinegar/garlic and marinade the chicken in half of that for a couple of hours.  I brown the chicken in a cast iron pan, then toss in a whole sliced up onion. I cover the pan, put the whole thing in the oven with the remaining soy/vinegar/garlic mix and allow it to braise for about 45 min. The chicken is fall-off-the-bone tender, and the sauce is divine over rice!

amazing! My boyfriend is half asian and said he would love it if I could make chicken adobo for him. Well, I had no idea what it was until I found it here at allrecipes and chose this version. I was skeptical when I seen the word vinegar and thought to my self is he out of his mind. Thus my love prevailed and I made it. We ate it all up and wanted more so I am making it again tonight.

My quest for the perfect adobo recipe continues.  This one came pretty close; using apple cider vinegar in place of white vinegar gave it a slight sweetness that I found appealing.  I would add whole peppercorns next time, and a teaspoon of tomato paste is an option if you want to give it a tangy kick; otherwise, this was about as close to authentic as I've been able to find.  Note: I actually substituted pork for the chicken, though either will work.

This is great! Thank you. I just made a couple of changes. For a 5 pound bird cut up I used 3/4 cup soy sauce, 3/4 cup vinegar, marinated for 2 hours with 1 clove of garlic chopped. Added 1 tsp ground ginger, 4 dried red peppers, and 2 sliced onions after adding the chicken to the hot oil. I also left the garlic in. My family loves the sauce over rice.

This was delicious!  We did a few things differently:  we used boneless skinless thighs, added about 1/6 cup of brown sugar, and added carrots, and onion and potatoes. This is our new adobo recipe, thanks!

Great recipe and so easy. I double everything except the chicken so we have plenty of juice to drizzle over our rice. I also use boneless skinless breasts to make it kid friendly.

I didn't have apple cider vinegar so used 1/8 cup balsamic and 1/8 cup worscestershire sauce to substitute, no bay leaves either (just moved and had basics only lol), sprinkled in basil, cayenne, and curry seasoning...it was great! Kids ate 2 helpings each!  Thanks for the new, easy, and delish meal!

I am 1/2 filipino and have tried different version of adobo.  I was looking to try something less salty and thought this might work using apple cider vinegar. This recipe just doesn't have any flavor.  Keep the garlic in the pan, add more and maybe add more soy sauce for a better flavor.  Perhaps if you marinated this overnight it would taste better.

loved this recipe. so did my filipino friend. said it ws just like his mom's and i can vouch for that cause i have had his mom's. although i recommend letting it marinade for a few hours prior to cooking, it gave it such flavor. and i added some garlic into it for the marinade as well. but very easy to make and very simple

I love this recipe! I use boneless, skinless chicken breasts and the flavor is something I find myself craving. I imagine it's even better with bone-in chicken.

I used boneless skinless chicken thighs, and although not in the recipe, I added an onion and about half a chopped red pepper I had on hand.  Also, I put back the garlic towards the end, mainly because I love garlic and hate to throw out food!  I steamed some white rice in the rice cooker and used the steamer basket to make some broccoli too, just for extra veggie benefits.  Delicious!

I altered this slightly because I didn't have any apple cider vinegar.  I used red wine vinegar and it turned out great.  I love this recipe.

This was ok.  It definitely needs low-sodium soy sauce because it was quite salty.  Overall though, I liked that it had a lot of flavor.

This was just ok. I used other's suggestions for Seasoned Rice Vinegar, kept in garlic...BUT it was just chicken in rice. The soy sauce flavor over-powered everything else. I use a marinade for salmon that tastes just like this and the only ingredients that are the same are the garlic and the soy sauce. I probably won't make this again unless I get desperate for a different chicken taste.

Thank you for the recipe - this was delicious. I made a few alterations that I felt added more flavor - I kept the garlic in since I love the taste of garlic, I substituted the apple cider vinegar with white wine vinegar, and added more portions of the soy sauce and vinegar to create a gravy.
