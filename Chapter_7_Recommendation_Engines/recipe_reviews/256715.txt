This dip is to die for.  I made it exactly as written. It was a hit with my husband's poker group.

This is a great party dish! Everyone loved it, and tasted great! I used a bit more beer than it called for, and it turned out amazing!

Prepared as shown BUT with more fresh garlic, as that is what my crew likes.  Served with home made soft pretzels and more beer of course!  Perfect party / sports / movie watching fare.

I thought it was bland.  I'd definitely add some spice or something to it.

Really good, made it a couple times now.  I did find that if you use too hoppy of a beer it gets a bit of an off flavor.  I love IPAs but I’d stay away from them for this recipe.

Super easy and delicious! Followed recipe exactly and it was a huge hit. Served with warm soft pretzels.  Will add some crumbled bacon next time after baking in oven for an added flavor!

Very easy and yummy.  Served with homemade soft pretzels and it was all gobbled up. I did not bother with a food processesor just mixed with hand mixer and it turned out fine, it was a bit oily so maybe the food processesor would make a difference?

Easy to make,  husband and I both loved it. Used 3/4 c. beer (a pale ale) and added cayenne. Served w/ crusty french bread (sorry, Snack Factory). Will definitely make again. Leftovers were good warmed in the microwave.

I just had to stop by and review this dip! this beer cheese dip is absolutely delicious! I used an extra sharp cheddar and Narragansett beer which is a lighter beer. I don’t have a good processer but used my vita mix because I don’t have a food processor. Using the “tamper” that came with the blender helped the mixture from turning into a big clump during blending. I put the beer in first with the paprika, then the shredded cheese, then the cream cheese and the corn starch last. Super smooth. After you’re done put hot water and a squirt of dish soap in the blender and let it clean itself. Super easy yummy appetizer! Thanks for sharing.

This was a huge hit at my sloppy joe party last night as an appetizer. I used a pale ale beer, and added about 3/4 rather than a half. I really liked the extra beer flavor, and it still  wasn't over powering. Great recipe!

I made it just as called for with the exception of a little more garlic.  Everyone loved it.  I have made it a few times already. I think I might try it with a spicy cheese next time just for fun.

Sounds delish!  Wondering how this would do in a crock pot?  Thinking about bring this to a Super Bowl party......
