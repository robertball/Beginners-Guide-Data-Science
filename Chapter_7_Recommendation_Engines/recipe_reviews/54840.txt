This recipe was amazingly fantastic and unbelieveably easy!  Because I wanted to eat this for a "before-bed-time-snack" I cut the apples into quarters, so I could make smaller servings.  After eating my first serving, over ice cream, I was so amazed at how wonderful it tasted, I froze the remaining quarters with all the sauce into 5 more individual plastic containers.  Now all I need to do is transfer the frozed servings into a micro-waveable bowl, heat for a minute or so, serve with ice cream and bingo - a marvelous night time snack.  Thank you "Chef_In_Skool.....so much!

It was not stated whether to pack the brown sugar or not, and when I made it it was too sweet. because I packed the brown sugar. A deeper pan could have been used also because it does boil over! Too much brandy for my liking. But generally it was liked by those that I served it to.  Also I used whipped cream because I did not have ice cream.

This is delicious, and very easy to make. The hardest part is coring the apples. We used pears and apples. I liked the pears a little more.

overall these apples were very tasty. The nutmeg and allspice were a little over powering but everyone still thought they were pretty good. I would make them again.

I didn't want to wait an hour to bake this dessert so I put all the ingredients (I downsized the recipe for 1 person=1 apple) into a hot skillet and it was quick and yummy. I drizzled the apples and sauce on vanilla bean ice cream and refused to share with my husband. Wonderful recipe. Thanks!

This was very sweet and apple pie-y, but I had some tartness because I used Granny Smith apples. The presentation was poor...when I removed the foil the apples looked rather smushed not very appealing. Nevertheless it was good. I didn't taste ANY brandy, so next time I will decrease some of the sugar and increase the brandy.

I didn't have any ginger or cloves, but it turned out fantastic anyways!!!  I just had very cheap brandy and it wasn't overpowering at all.  It was great with vanilla ice cream and wasn't too unhealthy either.

I made this for a Thanksgiving desert. I knew it was good when my non-food obsessed wife gave it compliments. Very easy, but I would start checking at about 45 minutes.

This recipe was delicious but overly sweet. Did you mean to have only 1/2 cup  sugar in it? I compared it to other  baked apple recipes, and they all have about 2 Tablespoons sugar per apple. Thank you.
