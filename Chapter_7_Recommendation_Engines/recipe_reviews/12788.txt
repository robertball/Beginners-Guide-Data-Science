Absolutely wonderful recipe! I did not have any sweet relish on hand but I did have bread and butter pickles. So I minced a few slices and used them instead. This recipe was so light and fresh tasting. I will NEVER use store bought tartar sauce again. One other thing...you really do need to let it set for awhile. I had to use mine almost immediately and while it was still very good, it definately improved with some time. Try this recipe, you will not be disappointed.

Yum-o...Great basic tartar sauce.  I've made it per instructed and with modifications.  I prefer to use dehydrated "Real-Lemon" powder instead of lemon juice (it makes it less runny) and I double pickles (at least) but drain them on paper towel first, again so that it is not runny.  I have also used horseradish instead of onion which gives it a different, but not unpleasant, taste. Leaving it to marry in the fridge is advised as it really brings the flavors together.

This is really the best tartar sauce....but I skip the optional lemon juice and we squeeze fresh lemon on our fish instead...not everyone likes the lemony taste in tartar sauce.  I have enhanced this with a TBS. of ketchup or cocktail sauce and a tsp. of dried dill.  This makes a yummy sauce for boiled shrimp or seared scallops.

This is the BEST tartar sauce!! I omitted the onion and substituted onion powder to save time. I also took the tip of using dill pickle juice instead of lemon. We used fatfree mayo and it was DELICIOUS!!!

This is very simple & tasty, which is my kind of recipe!  I used light mayo & dill relish due to the simple fact of me not liking sweet relish.  I will use this again & again, thanks Diane!!

Excellent! I found this recipe a couple of weeks ago and have made it three times. We eat fish at least twice a week and I never realized that this sauce could be so easy to make. I rarely have sweet pickle relish, but another reviewer chopped up some sweet pickles and I did the same. The sauce is much more flavorful after a few hours in the fridge, overnight is best. This is a terrific, easy recipe and one for my files. Thanks!

This did require another scoopful of pickle relish, but otherwise it was really good! Just like the tartar sauce they serve in the authentic fish and chips shop. I served it with fried shrimp, and there was none to put back in the fridge for leftovers. Thanks for sharing!

I was looking at the top 100 recipes and came across this one for tartar sauce; it is the same basic recipe I've been making for years.  Everyone has their own taste about proportions for this, but Diane's is pretty close to mine.  The only differences are: I only use 1 TBSP of freshly squeezed lemon juice, I finely grate a TBSP of sweet onion (it is more subtle and kid friendly that way and unless you use fresh onion you are really missing out,) and I use a little more pickle relish than that.  I also like to add a pinch or two of turmeric; it perks this up just a bit, by adding a little bite, richness and yellow color.  Sometimes I make this without the pickle relish, but then I use freshly chopped dill or dried dill weed (if you use fresh it must sit for "awhile" to infuse,) a little grated lemon peel and then I DO use the full two tablespoons of lemon... you could add a bit of dill relish to the second version, but I don't like dill pickles very well so I don't. I don't like the turmeric with the dill, but it is great with the sweet pickle...

I am pregnant and have been craving tartar sauce with everything!  Unfortunately we are stationed in Guam and they don't carry tartar sauce out here...I was SO excited when I found this amazing yet easy recipe.  Thank you so much! EDIT 10/13/09: Since April 2007 when I first rated this recipe, I have changed it a little bit to suit my taste buds... here is what I did:  2 Tablespoons finely chopped onion, 1 medium clove garlic, minced, 2 teaspoons dill weed, cracked black pepper, a dash more lemon juice.  Delicious!!!

I made this tarter sauce and thought it was pretty good. But I added a touch of garlic to it and my family really liked it like that. I've also made this but used Miracle Whip Salad Dressing. It gives it more of a tangy taste.

I strongly recommend preparing this in advance, letting it sit in the fridge overnight makes a big difference. Thought it tasted too much like mayo at first, but the next day, it was perfect!! Plus, if you make too much, it's good for at least another 2 weeks or so, as long as you keep it refridgerated.

This is great with fish.  I add a little bit of garlic powder and cut back a little on the lemon juice.  Other than that, I leave it as is (I even use sweet relish instead of dill!  LOL)  **Update**- I have found that my family likes it if, instead of lemon juice, I pour in a little pickle juice (just right off a jar of pickles, dill or sweet, depending on what type of relish I use).  It tastes sooo good!

I am so happy to have found this recipe! I've been making my own tartar sauce for years, and while it was good, it wasn't what I found in excellent seafood restaurants. However, this tartar sauce is exactly what I've been looking for! It is the addition of the onion that really puts it over the top for me. I grate mine finely. I do not use the full amount of lemon juice, but I do use a squirt, and I always add a little Old Bay for extra oomph.

I never realized just how easy tartar sauce was to throw together.  I make this about once a week now.  If I completely miss my measurements on the ingredients, I can always combat its being too sweet by adding a drop or two of brown mustard, some lemon-pepper and/or a sprinkle of garlic powder.

Needed tartar sauce - store was out of my brand so I bought another.  Luckily I tasted it before dinner was ready - YUCKO!!!! Knew I couldn't serve it so I ran to my trusty "Allrecipes" and found this one right away. I just added a little more relish - but hey I did that to my store bought brand.  One thing I did add, was wasabi powder because I saw "Wasabi Tartar Sauce" recipe below this one.  So I am adding this recipe to my box (it's a keeper) and will also add to the box the Wasabi Tartar Sauce and try that the next time!  Thanks submitters.

Have used a similar recipe for years (Same ingredients, I just never measured the amounts... simply mixed until it tasted right). The only thing I don't understand is why the recipe states that it only has a 3-day shelf life! I simply re-use a mayonnaise jar to store it in and it keeps as long as the mayo would keep. Several weeks at least.

This is the best tartar sauce. I don't even think about buying tartar sauce at the store. I've used home made sweet pickles, chopped gherkins, and relish. The only thing I don't understand is the 3 day storage. I have stored this for 1 month in the refrigerator and I'm still alive!

No tartar sauce in the fridge and baking cod tonight. Price of gas negates making a special trip to the store so turned to AllRecipes for help. So simple and a GREAT taste even using low fat mayo. I threw in a couple of dashes of tobasco sauce since I prefer a little kick and now I'll never buy store-bought again! And super cheap too!! THANKS!!!!!!

I was making fish and chips and didn't realize until the last minute that I didn't have any tartar sauce in. I decided to give this recipe a try and it was surprising how it tasted EXACTLY like the real thing. I didn't have sweet pickle relish so I just used regular dill relish but it didn't make a difference at all. I also didn't add onion or salt and pepper (didn't think it needed it). I did add the lemon juice though. Thanks for the great recipe!

Well, I certainly didn't know tartar sauce was so simple. No need to buy the stuff at the store anymore! I didn't really measure my ingredients, but went by taste. My guests didn't care for onions, so I didn't use them (but I think I will next time), and I added a little bit of honey mustard. No salt and pepper -- not needed! A great hit. A little dill and garlic powder sound good too (as I saw on other reviewers' notes) and will be tried in next batch. Nice basic recipe to play with.

I tried this recipe because I wanted to have a good yet simple tartar sauce for my salmon cakes (recipe also found on this site)... One thing I love about this recipe is not only how quick and easy it was, but it was delicious and easy to modify to one's liking. A few of my own modifications: I opted to leave out the lemon juice, but I added 1 tbsp of sugar (cuz I like my tartar sauce, but I didn't want the sweet relish to be overbearing), 1 tsp of paprika and a dash or two of cayenne pepper. I followed the advice of letting it sit in the refrigerator for a few days... I made it on Friday and the result was a sauce on Monday that my girlfriend called "crazy good". I will definitely repeat this recipe over and over and over again!

Good! I used about half the mayo and 1/2 tsp of onion powder in place of minced onion. Dried minced onion would've worked nicely too. I added a tsp dried parsley and used about 2 tsp of lemon juice. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and delicious recipe. I'm usually not a big fan of tartar sauce, but was asked to whip some up. It was yummy. I made a couple of substitutions: dill for sweet pickles, low-fat mayonnaise instead of full fat and pickle juice instead of lemon juice.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yum! I left out the minced onion as I was too lazy at the moment, but it didn't seem to matter. It tastes great on EVERYTHING.

Nothing could be easier than this. I didn't even measure; I just eye-balled all the ingredients. used very little lemon juice so it wouldn't be runny. Thanks a bunch!

I rated this five stars because it is the closest I have ever come to making tartar sauce that comes from one of my favorite restaurents.  This outdoes store bought brands.

This was great.  I used it on the frozen battered fish (van de kamp) and it made the meal.  Great on a bun with lettuce and cheese and the fish.  Just enough flavor to make the fish taste great!

I use twice as much chopped DILL pickle and a pinch of dill weed and about 1 TBLS. of horse-radish mustard or at least a good Dijon. A low-fat mayo works just fine.

This was so easy and tasted SO good!  I skipped the minced onion and used onion powder instead.  Tasted so much better than the stuff from a jar.  I will be making my own tarter sauce from now on!

I've been making my own tartar sauce this way for years. We don't care for sweet pickle relish but love the dill pickle relish. Sometimes I use pickle juice instead of lemon juice, and a dash of cayenne for a little kick, lately because of health issues I use 1/4 mayo to 3/4 plain fat free yogurt. it's delicious and healthier.

No complaints.  I didn't have regular mayo, so I used Miracle Whip instead.  It was delicious.  I will alternate this recipe with my standard: miracle whip, mustard, sweet relish, celery seed.

This was a good place to start. I made this tonight as a first experiment in making my own tartar sauce, and ended up adding a couple teaspoons of powdered Ranch dressing mix, some dill, and a little granulated garlic. I also used dill pickle relish instead of sweet. My wife loved it and said I was right to make the sauce instead of buying it from the store! That was worth 4 stars all by itself;)

We discovered this years ago when we ran out of tarter sauce. My kids eventually decided they like their altered version best which is merely Miracle Whip mixed with a good relish. Even now, as adults, its not uncommon for one of them to put a spoonful of each on the side of his plate, stir & then add to whatever he's eating at the time. I haven't bought tarter sauce in years!

Yummy!  This is extremely good & super easy!  I didn't have any lemon juice on hand so I used dill pickle juice instead (per other reviews).  I also added a little horseradish for a little kick & squeezed the relish juice out first.  It was wonderful.  Like everyone else, I won't buy tartar sauce in the store again.  Thanks for the recipe!

I've made this several times now & my family loves it.  I try to make enough to keep around since I've found it stays good for quite awhile.

This recipe is great.  I used Smart Balance Mayo because it's half the calories and still tastes like mayo.  I did add a couple of tablespoons of sour cream and doubled the relish (I used pickles), lemon juice, and onion.  I also added a tablespoon of capers.  You have to let it sit for at least an hour.  I tried it right after I made it and it tasted like mayo which is why I doubled all the ingredients.  Then I let it sit for an hour and tried it again and it was fabulous.  I probably didn't need to double everything.  I'll never buy jared stuff again!

I love this recipe. It is way better than store bought. I used low 3 parts fat mayo and 1 part non fat yogurt, a little extra relish, added about 1T. of minced bread & butter pickles, and a dash of Texas Pete for kick. This recipe is too quick and easy to make, plus lower in sodium and no preservatives! Why would anyone every buy store bought after tasting this? Next time, instead of Texas Pete, I might mince some roasted jalepeno or green chili (we like it hot!)

Very good basic recipe.  My hubby LOVES tartar sauce and uses plenty so I have been making it for him for years in an effort to have a healthier option than store-bought. Over time we have tweaked the recipe to suit his preferences.  We use light Miracle Whip rather than mayo, add more sweet relish, some garlic, less lemon juice, onion powder, and either paprika or Old Bay seasoning and a light touch of sugar.

This is good tartar sauce for when you haven't any commercial on hand.  I use it often when my regular is outdated. Always have these ingredients on hand.  Be sure to use Best Foods or Hellman's mayonnaise (they are the same thing); others don't compare!

I found this recipe very good.  I elimated the onion and used 2 tablespoons of sugar.

Yummy and simple...I did drain my relish first though to make it a tad less runny! I wont ever buy pre made tarter sauce again!

This recipe is good for starters, but I substituted chopped (very small dice) green onions (only the white part) for the "onion" and added 1 tsp granulated sugar, because I thought the taste without it was too acidic. You do need the lemon juice, IMHO to give it "tang." Try these changes and "see!"

Sometimes simpler is in fact better. Made this in a pinch with Wickles relish, and had to sub. onion powder. Was so tasty and simple I really don't plan on buying it pre-made again. Thanks for the recipe!!!

PERFECT! Use either Mayo or Miracle Whip & add the relish only. So easy to make & better than store bought.

Had to use immediately, and it tasted good. I used onion powder, dill relish and mixed all the ingredients together at the same time, and it still tasted like tartar sauce, haha.

Realized at the last minute I didn't have any tartar sauce. Made this and it was great. I added a little more relish and onion powder rather than onion. Letting it sit a bit would really help to combine the flavors.

I used dill relish with a touch of sweetener instead of sweet relish because I didn't have it. And just had lemon wedges on the side, it was fantastic and simple.

I can't stand store-bought tartar sauce and had NO idea that making my own could be so quick & easy! I make my own sweet relish, so it was fun to be able to use that to make yet another homemade condiment for my family. GREAT recipe! Thank you so much!

Great stuff - If you make this recipe regularly, consider picking up some Cornichon pickles instead of dill pickles/relish. Also, I'd add at least twice as many pickles.

This is a good basic recipe.  I made it as directed, but added my own touches;  a dash of garlic powder and a pinch of dried dill weed (sorry, I dont usually measure, I just go by what looks good).  I let the flavours meld in the fridge for a couple hours, and it was really good!  100 times better than any store bought sauce!

Have been making it this way for years and years.  Must be mayo and not salad dressing.  Every once in awhile I throw in a dill pickle for tang.  Can use sweet pickle if you don't have any relish in the frigerator.

Sorry but this didn't do it for me.  It tasted too much like Miracle whip which I find awful.  If you like a creamier, more mellow tasting tartar sauce, go elsewhere.

This was SO simple and quick - and tasted great! I honestly never knew what tartar sauce actually consisted of, and I will be using this recipe for all my fish dishes now! Definitely doesn't have to be used with just fried fish - it was just fantastic on some salmon burgers I had purchased at the grocery store.

This is a good recipe. MUCH better than the stuff you buy in the store. I like to use a couple tablespoons of dill pickle juice instead of the lemon juice.

The key to a super tarter sauce for me is the relish, so be sure you know the best relish for your taste.  This is good but after tasting I added a pinch of garlic powder.

Thank you for this recipe!  My hubby wanted tartar sauce with his fish.  I didn't want to run to the store for it, so I turned to allrecipes, of course.  Needless to say, he thinks it is better than sauce from a jar!!

This was really good.  Hubby likes tartar sauce more than I do....so this comes from him.  The only negative was that it was a little too thin.  He wanted a thicker sauce...but the taste was great.  Thanks for the post.

Excellent.  Have even made it with onion powder when we were out of onions and it still turned out well.  We add a little hot sauce to zip it up.

I needed tartar sauce tonight but didn't have any so I found this recipe.  I didn't have sweet pickles so I used dill pickles, but the result was great and I will definitely make this any time I need tartar sauce in the future.  Thanks!

This is the tartar sauce I've been looking for for 20 years!  I'm from the midwest and love Frisch's Big Boy tartar sauce.  I've tried to recreate it in my kitchen many times, without success.  This is close, only better! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Jackie!

This was much better than bottled sauce.  I used the lemon juice and I think that really helped with the flavor and texture.  The next day I added sugar to the leftovers and made a delicious spread for our shaved ham sandwiches.

Simple, easy, just about right. I added a little more  onion and pickle though, and you definately should let it sit. I made up a jar of it and its come in handy several times.

I will never buy tartar sauce again!  This is simple to make and tastes great.  I made the recipe as written, but it looked like too little onion and relish, so I added another 1/2 Tbs. of each.  (I might use 2 Tbs. of each next time.)  And, do use the lemon juice, it makes a big difference.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thank you!

Excellent Tartar Sauce recipe!  Tastes better than the jarred kind, and doesn't have any funky ingredients like the others I've seen on here.  The lemon juice gives it a real good flavor.

This recipe is perfect. I was in the supermarket getting ready to buy some of the jarred stuff, that I only tolerant because I love tartar sauce on fried seafood, when I had the genius idea to Google recipes. Allrecipes is my go to since I love the reviews, this popped up and since I had all the ingredients already and it had good reviews I went for it. WOAH!!! This tastes just like the stuff my mom's chef BF made when I was a kid. I, personally, wouldn't change a thing. I saved money AND  ended up enjoying dinner so much more. Thanks for such a great recipe, I'll never need another tartar sauce recipe.

I give this recipe two stars it was weird tasting, and I had to change the recipe to get it to taste good. Would be better with less lemon juice one tbs. instead of two. I also added pepper, cayenne, and capers! This way it was a lot better :)

This is very good and similiar to the one I make. I add 1/2 teaspoon  of worcestershire sauce and use chopped dill pickles rather than sweet relish.

I enjoyed this recipe, but kicked it up a bit with chopped capers as well as the relish.  When I haven't had relish I just chop up dill pickles.

DE-LICIOUS!  This is such a simple and great tartar sauce to use.  We will never buy tartar sauce again!  Of COURSE, I made a couple easy changes. 2 tbsp of sweet pickle relish and 1 tbsp of lime juice (instead of 2 of lemon).

I don't like sweet relish, so I chopped up some dill pickle slices & added dill weed.  I replaced the onion with 2 cloves of fresh pressed garlic.  This was amazing... best tartar sauce ever, & so simple!

I may never buy Tartar Sauce again.  I used green onions, minced, instead of plain onion.  It was the best!

Except for the lemon this is the same as my mom's recipe that I've been making for the last 45+ years. Sometimes the basics are the best. The only thing I ever change is to add a little ketchup and horseradish when I want a pink remoulade.

I was so mad to find that I had no tarter sauce in the fridge! I got online, whipped up this recipe and loved it!! I will never buy it again. I will always make this recipe instead, love it.

This did not have enough pickle relish and too much lemon juice; my first try came out runny and sour.  I added an additional 1/2 c. mayonnaise and 1/4 c. relish and it was just barely edible.  I'm really surprised at the rating of this recipe.

I made it for some catfish that ended up tasting so good on it's own so we didn't use it.  Pulled it back out of the fridge for some fish sticks for the kiddos and I and it was delicious and perfect.  Very light and refreshing.  Thanks!

My hubby ran out of tartar sauce so I went to my favorite recipe site and waalaa!  He loved this recipe!  We omitted the onions only because we didnt have any.  He said it was "awesome!"  This will be in use in the future.

Easy to make and very tasty....you can use it shortly after making it, but refrigerating it for a few hours first definitely improves the end results.

SO thankful to have this recipe.  We were out of tarter sauce and french dressing for dip, so I made this about 20 min before serving.  I had miracle whip and cornichons - so I added sugar to make it sweeter!  The entire dish was devoured!  Thank you for a keeper!!

Use dill pickle, not sweet pickle.  The lemon juice is also not optional!  You need it to get a good flavor.  Follow those two tips & you'll get tartar sauce like you find up North.  Tartar sauce is so simple, it's surprising how often it gets messed up!

It was okay.  Next time I'll try it with dill relish instead and add some sour cream to thicken it up.

Great recipe to make a quick with fried fish, especially when everyone in your house does not like tartar sauce. (Only my husband and I do). I made mine to taste with mayonnaise, dill relish (that's all I had), and Lawry's lemon pepper seasoning.  Refigerated & was so light and refreshing.  I agree with others, I will never buy store bought again!

This was by far the best tartar sauce ever and the fact that it was homemade makes it that much better...I have always loved and kept packed of Long John Silver's Tartar sauce because I could never find a restaurant that could out do them. But this my friends surpasses them. I followed the recipe to the "T" adding in the lemon juice but omitting the salt.

This was great - modified the juice to be half lemon juice, half pickle juice, and did about double the onion and pickle. Barely any salt (mayos so salty), but generous pepper, paprika, and dill, plus a pinch garlic. Also added about 1/6 cup ketchup, as suggested by someone. This was FANTASTIC, better than any tartar I've tried.

Had a craving for fish sticks and forgot to buy tartar sauce....no biggie...I'll make my own. This sauce is very simple and taste great. We didn't wait for it to chill. I just made it and served immediately. The whole family likes this one. Thanks for the recipe! I can check one more thing off of the list of store bought items that I will now be making fresh.

I used onion powder as I don't care for heavy crunchy onion in my tartar sauce. Everything else was perfect- the lemon really makes it. I will definitely use this again! Thanks for sharing.

This was excellent and tasted better than pre-packaged tartar sauce!  I used onion powder (half the amount as minced onion) instead of the minced.  I also used season salt instead of regular.

Great recipe. I've made it the original way, and I prefer it with dill relish instead of sweet. I also double the amount of relish and onion. Have kept this in the refrigerator for 3 weeks and it still tasted just fine!

This is a great recipe to use as a base.  I added an extra tbls of sweet relish, 1 tbls cider vinegar instead of lemon juice (malt vinegar would be better, but cider worked in a pinch) 1 tbls dijon mustard, a dash of garlic, a dash or two of celery seed.  It was fantastic!!

I was pleasantly surprised how great this tasted.   When I told my grandfather I was baking breaded fish, and he told me we had no tartar sauce. Of course I felt bad, so I ran to the comp and looked up a recipe. I found this, and prepared it within five minutes - he loved it!

This is definitely good, but try adding a T. full of dill pickle juice and dill relish instead of the sweet relish. I saw this on a cooking show and have been making it like this for years. Super

Too much mayo for the amount of other ingredients. I had to add double the amount of the pickles and onion in order to get this to have any flavor. Lemon juice is a must, not an option.

Delicious. I used Miracle Whip, instead of mayo because that is what I had. I may add some garlic next time.

Tasted like mayo, not tartar sauce.  I had to add a lot more of the other ingredients to get it to my liking.  Guess it can be considered a base sauce.

I use Lemon Pepper instead of the Lemon Juice, always have Lemon pepper on hand and it adds a bit more zest. I also use dill pickles and add a tad of the pickle juice to the mix.

I love tartar sauce on fried fish, but always hesitated to buy store-bought because most of it went to waste.  This recipe is so great because it tastes good and is easy to scale to just 1 serving if that's all you need! I lightly dusted a tilapia fillet with cornmeal and fried it in olive oil.  Served it on white bread with a couple slices of ripe tomato and the tartar sauce.

Very good Tartar Sauce, much better than any store bought sauce I have ever purchased.  I add a little more relish and lemon juice, tasting as I go.  Flavors also seem to 'richen' as it sits.  This is now a standard to go with Fish recipes!

Loved this recipe. Needed sauce in a pinch and had ingredients on hand. I substituted onion powder for chopped onion (my nephew hates onions) and it was still great. I will only use this tartar sauce from now on.

Fantastic! Did not have sweet pickle relish so I used one dill pickle shredded however the relish would probably be better. I will never waste money on inferior store bought again!

It was pretty good.  Make sure to mince onion really small, and maybe even add 2 more tbsp. of relish.  I thought this made it taste less like mayonaise, and more like tartar sauce.  I also added as much lemon juice as I liked for liquid consistency.  I did not use the full 2 tbsp. because it comes out a tad too runny for our liking.

This is a great recipe for tartar sauce. I used sweet relish, but in place of the lemon juice I used dill relish, and in place of minced onion I used onion powder and it was delicious! I made the sauce for a family wedding and got raving reviews!

I probably would've given this recipe 5 stars had I made it exactly the way it said, but I did make some alterations to the recipe. I used 2 Tablespoons of the sweet relish instead of 1 like some of the other reviewers, had no lemon juice so I used a dash of lime instead and added 1 teaspoon of dried dill, it turned out sooo good, I could've eaten it alone! Never again will I buy Tartar Sauce in a bottle! Enjoy!

Never, never will I buy the bottled stuff again! I was out of tartar sauce and was having fish for dinner, and didn't want to go to the grocery. So I made this. So easy, and so, so good. I substituted dried onion flakes for the minced onion. Def. add the lemon juice. Gives it a great zing.

This is the perfect ratio of tarter sauce ingredients.  For a twist, add a half teaspoon of creamy horseradish.  But the recipe is perfect as it, too.

This tartar sauce saved some otherwise not so tasty crab cakes.  Other than using low fat mayo I followed the recipe exactly.  No more store bought for us.

Good easy recipe. I could tell if I have made it ahead of time like recommended it would be PERFECT! But we didn't want to wait so I doubled the relish and onions and it was so good.

Fresher and better tasting than anything you would get at the store. Cheaper too since most of the ingredients are already in your kitchen. When I make fish for me and husband, I throw half a pickle and half an onion into the food processor for a couple seconds and then scoop it right into the mayo. I use the lemon juice to help mix it all together before adding the S&P. Thanks for sharing.

I've never made tartar sauce before but I won't buy the premade stuff again after finding this recipe!  I used dill relish because that's what I had and it turned out phenominally good.  Added a touch of onion powder and garlic powder, and I used a little more onion.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I like to mix half mayo and half miracle whip, to give it a little zip w/out it tasting too much like salad dressing.  It's also lots better if you let it sit for that hour or two, but it does rock even when you take it straight to the table too.

This was the best tartar sauce I've tasted.  Normally, since I grew up on Miracle whip, I don't use mayo, so I first tried the recipe with Miracle Whip.  That was just wrong!  I almost wrote off the idea of making tartar sauce, but decided to try the recipe as it was written.  Talk about good!  I added 2 tsp. of cayenne pepper to put a little zip in the mix because I used to like the hot & spicy tartar sauce the that was sold in stores (they don't sell it anymore).  It turned out that mine was much better than theirs!  

Great recipe!  Thanks for sharing.

This is a staple in our house whenever we are having fish or seafood.  I haven't bought the jarred stuff in ages.  I use dill relish instead of sweet and just add a pinch or two of sugar to the mixture.  I also use dehydrated onions (rehydrate in the lemon juice or some water before adding).  Best if you let it sit for a few hours at least before serving, but I've brought it to the table immediately and heard no complaints.  :o)  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a great recipe! In the past couple of years I have developed an intolerance to egg yolk and I have yet to find tartar sauce in the store without egg yolk. I did, however find a "mayo" product that doesn't have egg yolk in it. I'm excited because I do not like fish without tarter sauce. Thanks SO much!!

I wasn't totally convinced with the recipe as such so I added a few cappers and garlic powder. Goes well with "potato salmon patties" from this site.

This was pretty good, doesn't compare to the restaurants though.  However, it's great when you don't have any on hand and very easy to make.  I also felt the tartar needed something more, so I too added extra relish and a dash of dill to give it more "oomph".

Not bad at all, just needed a little doctoring. At first I followed the recipe to a "T" but it tasted way too much like plain mayo with a strong after bite of lemon and not enough taste of the relish. I then added 3 more Tablespoons of relish along with a good sprinkling of dill and then about 2 teaspoons of yellow mustard and TAADAA!!!!  It had the perfect mix of flavors and a thicker consistency. Wonderful! Nice base recipe though, thanks Diane for sharing!

I gave this receipe a 4 star because I think its a great receipe but I found that the onion overpowered everything.  I love onions but it was too much, a tbs too much.  I think reducing the amt. of minced onion & increasing the amt. of relish would make this a even better tartar sauce

S-I-M-P-L-E.  Definately keep the lemon juice. Don't make it optional. It adds a nice mild zing. I used onion powder instead and it was good. Keeping it cold a while is a great idea. My kids like it best when the relish is chopped very fine.

This was the best ever tartar sauce.  No more bottled tartar sauce for me.  This was truly wonderful.  I did add an extra tablespoon of onion and an extra tablespoon of sweet relish.  The taste becomes more incredible after several more hours in the fridge.  I bet this would be great mixed with tuna.  Thank Diane for a great recipe.

i love tartar sauce with fish and this is definately a keeper. it is just the right amount of everything and gives a perfect flavor. i would recomend making it in advance because like others said it has more flavor the longer it sits.

VERY simple to make, I don't have to rush to the grocery store now every time I don't think about buying tartar sauce. Very nice taste, this recipe is a keeper.  I'm never BUYING tartar sauce again... making it at home for now on!

Pretty good tartar sauce! I was hesitant to make it as my husband typically does not care for sweet relish, but it was what I had on hand. I used Just Mayo instead of regular mayo since I can't have eggs, which worked out great in this recipe. I felt the sauce needed more of a dill flavor though and added a little dried dill weed. Went perfect with our Walleye Cakes (from this site). Thanks for the recipe!

I will never buy tartar sauce again! This is wonderful. I did swap dill pickle relish for the sweet pickle relish because I don't care for sweet pickles, but initially that was the only change I made. Lately I've been adding just about a 1/4 tsp of creamy horseradish to give it just a little extra kick.  Very nice.

I had a jar of Miracle Whip already opened so I used that. It does give it an extra tang, too. I used dill pickle juice in place of the lemon juice and added a bit of garlic powder and black pepper. It's great when you can pull something like this together with ingredients you have at home, not to mention it's better than the store-bought stuff! Thanks Diane!

It's even better if you use dill pickle relish instead of sweet pickle relish.  I never buy tarter sauce because homemade is so much better.

While this is good, I prefer to add as well a tablesp. of chopped capers and a tsp of dried tarragon to it as well, to get that real gourmet tartar sauce flavour.

I'm not a big fan of mayo or sweet pickles, but I love dill pickles and onions. So, I used ½ cup mayo, 3 Tbsp dill pickle relish, 2 Tbsp finely minced onions and instead of lemon juice and pepper I just used a dash of lemon pepper. No salt as the dill pickle relish is salty. This of course, completely changed the recipe, but it was great!!

AH-MAY-ZING! Seriously, best tartar sauce I've ever had. This is honestly better than store bought or even restaurant stuff! And it was so easy, fast, and cheap to make. The only thing I did differently was use onion powder instead of onions (don't like them) and I did use the optional lemon juice, which was great. Also, I left it in the fridge for about 6-8 hours before serving. Anyway, love love love it! Going to make it again already in a week. :)

Going to a catfish fry on Sat. and I was asked to bring the tarter sauce.  This turned out very good as I just tasted after being chilled 24 hrs.  Only change I made was adding about 7-8 mashed capers instead of salt and I doubled the pepper to 1 1/2 tea.

I like this recipe I have used it multiple times for a really good fried fish recipe I have. I normally dont eat tartar sauce cause I dont like mayonnaise, but this was very good. I love the onion in it, and I put a little extra lemon juice and pickles in it for my own personal time. This tartar sauce has gone in my recipe book!

I made this to go with the fish we had for dinner & got rave reviews. BUT, I changed it a bit. I made 1/2 the amount with real mayo. I added dry minced onions, 2 teaspoons of bread & butter pickle relish that I had drained on a paper towel, salt & pepper, a little lemon juice, then called my "taster" in. It had no kick, he said. He rejected more lemon juice, said it needed more tart. I added about a teaspoon (I didn't measure, he tasted) of apple cider vinegar. That was perfect for both my son, the taster & my husband, who also advised he wants more fish so he can have that again.

This is a really good recipe. Now if you're in a pinch and can't wait one hour for the minced onions to soften and flavor the sauce, use 2 teaspoons of onion powder for instant results!

Most store bought tartar sauces have that 'oily, cheap mayonese' base that really turns me off.  I've always just mixed Miracle Whip and sweet pickle relish and there you have it.  I do like to sqeeze a little lemon right on my fish for that little zing.

The recipe was OK, but I made it a little healthier by cutting the mayo amount in half and substituting greek yogurt.  Also, because I prefer a tarter tartar (ha ha) sauce, I use half sweet, half dill pickles

I have used this basic recipe for years, but I like to add a little garlic powder.  Also, I use lime juice instead of lemon.  This beats anything you can get ready-made.

I have used a similar recipe for many years but prefer dill relish and use fresh lime juice rather than the lemon.  It's a staple at our house when fish is served!

Great for in a pinch and cheaper than store bought! I did add a little dill pickle relish in too. Thanks for the recipe!

We never make fried food in our home (mess + smell) but that doesn't stop us from going to our favourite fish joint and bringing it home to enjoy. This last time, however, as we were unpacking our order, we noticed that they forgot to include Tartar Sauce!!! The food was hot!, the nearest store is 20 miles away (as was the restaurant), so I had to find an IMMEDIATE solution and came >here

I don't buy tarter sauce at the store anymore after finding this one on the Internet! So easy to make it fresh, and a lot cheaper when you factor in the price of ingredients. I added 1 tsp of dill weed and modified the onion to use 2 large minced green onions (including the white). As for the citrus, I either use Meyer Lemon from my tree, or have used Lime Juice in the past. These additions give it an intense flavor with all sorts of layers, and not just some white stuff that goes on fish. Used it in a ham sandwich last week. Was awesome!!

As is, I'd give it four stars. I added more relish since the posted amount didn't give it much zing. I liked the addition of the lemon juice, but it seemed to make it too runny. But I'll definitely be making this one again!

THIS IS A GOOD BASIC TARTAR SAUCE. MY FAVORITE IS THE ONE THEY SELL AT THE STORE THAT SELLS CHEAP WINE.  THEIRS IS A JALEPENO TARTAR SAUCE.  BUT THIS ONE IS PRETTY GOOD.

This recipe was fabulous.  However, Instead of the relish, I chopped 2 tablespoons of bread & butter pickles, added the juice of two small lemons and 1.5 tablespoons of dried dill.   My family absolutely loved it!  Apparently, it's better than the homemade tartar sauce at the best fish & chip shop in our area....which is on the West Coast of British Columbia!  My family requests this recipe every time I mention cooking fish for dinner!  Thanks!

Absolutely great. I won't be buying store bought again. I didn't have lemon juice so I used sweet and dill relish to make up the tartness. It came out great.

I have been using this recipe for years. Except I use 2-3 Tbls sweet relish and a dash of dill. I have never bought tartar sauce out of a bottle.  This was the way my Mother fixed it and I have done the same all these years

I use India Relish instead of the sweet pickle relish, everyone wants to know what my recipe is.  Seems the India Relish gives it a little more zip.

This was quick, easy and yummy though I do agree that it was better after it sat in the fridge for awhile.  Also, I used closer to 2 tbs of onion and minced zesty dill stackers in lieu of sweet relish and also used closer to 2 tbs of that.  To round it out I added about 1 tsp of dill and that really did the trick!  This is now my go-to tartar sauce recipe!

oh my gosh! yum! I had all the ingredients and just eyeballed the measurements, i don't think i used as much lemon juice as recommended and the minced onion was dried so tomorrow when my husband eats the tartar sauce with the leftovers, it'll be even better.

Loved this recipe.  Simple and tasty.  I used a tbsp. of lemon juice, some chopped olives pimentos removed-1 tbsp and a tsp. sweet relish.  I added a 1/2 tsp. dill.  I did not have any minced onion so I substituted onion powder and chopped a tsp. of real onion too.  I wished my fish tasted as good as this sauce.  Thank you.

This was really good I made half of the recipe because it was too much. I used a sweet Valida onion and sweet pickle relish. I added garlic,onion,and chipotle powder. It was gone in a matter of seconds with fried fish

This is a great recipe on its own. I made it as directed the first time.

The 2nd time I changed it a little. I like lots of relish so I trippled the relish. Also I did use the lemon juice, but I used half lemon half lime juice instead. I did not add salt and added minced garlic with onions and lemon pepper for an extra kick. I also graded a zuchini into the mixture to add some veggies to it. It made me feel a little better about the mayo, and also thickened it up. The zuchini was hidden by the other flavors so that was nice to get some veggies in while eating something bad for me at the same time.

I used this tart sauce on top of a few crab cakes and it was great.

I used fat free mayo and I cut up one bread and butter stacker pickle (thin sliced pickles). 1 teaspoon onion powder, 1/4 teaspoon dill, 1/4 teaspoon chopped garlic, 1 Tablespoon lemon juice, a sprinkle of dried parsley and 1/4 teas sea salt and sprinkle of pepper.   So easy to whip up and have in the fridge.

This is a terrific recipe. Like so many others said, I'll never buy tartar sauce again. Yum! The only thing I changed was to add a little extra relish, as others had suggested.

Absolutely the best tartar sauce ever.  My husband, who thinks tartar sauce should be it's own food group, may well leave me to spend more time with this sauce. LOL

this was great, you really need to let it sit over night tho. I didn't have relish so i used kosher dill pickes since i had those in the fridge and it came out great, and i used onion powder instead of fresh onions. I'll be making my own tartar sauce from now on.

Yum!!!  I am never buying store bought tartar sauce again!  This was easy to make and it took about 5-10 min.  Making it a few hours in advance is a must.  Like some reviewers, I used pickles instead of relish because i prefer my sauce to be more tart than sweet but either way, this recipe is great.  Thanks!

Very good! I made this the day before I needed it for fried fish and it turned out to be excellent! It had such a fresh taste just like a restaurant. I will not buy bottled tartar sauce again! I doubled both the minced onion and drained DILL relish. Everyone in my family hates sweet relish! I also added onion powder and made sure to use freshly ground sea salt and black pepper. Next time I might add some "zip" with either horseradish or hot sauce.  I'm so excited to have this recipe & I will make it many times in the future. Thank you!

It was a pretty good recipe.  I doubled the relish and I did add the lemon juice...a must!  Next time I'll use onion powder.  I didn't really care for the crunch of minced onion...it overpowered the taste of the tartar sauce.

I have made this several times and it is so good. Don't waste your money on jarred sauce, it doesnt compare. I use extra dill relish (I dont care for sweet relish) in mine and add in some cream of tarter powder to give it that extra tang.  Prepared a couple hours in advance & refrigerated in a must!

Very good.  I didn't have sweet pickle relish, so I just chopped up bread and butter pickles until I had what I felt was enough.  I used probably 2-3 tablespoons, but I'm extremely fond of pickles and can't really get enough of them, so it's not a criticism of the recipe.  I made this last night and served it with fish sticks today and it was very good.  It makes a lot, but we have leftover fish so hopefullly we will use it.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wow! Great recipe!  I substituted the minced onion for some onion powder since my wife doesn't like onion.   We both loved this and I will continue to make this for my fish dishes.

This is a great and simple recipie.  I think it's the lemon juice that transforms this from just mayo to tartar sauce.  So I would recomend that option.  The longer you let it sit the better it tastes for sure.

Great tartar sauce. I used the lemon juice that was optional. Nice because you can make just enough for what you need.

this is a great recipe!! so simple and yummy.  i used dill pickle relish but added a little sugar to replace the sweet pickle relish.  also i used lime juice instead of lemon juice coz i find lime to be less sour.

This is a great recipe! I have used one like this for years. I use a small amount of white vinegar instead of lemon (we drizzle the lemon right on the fish), and I put about a teaspoon of fresh finely chopped red bell peppers (too much will turn your sauce pink), the bell peppers really bring the flavor our!

I'd never had tartar sauce, so I have nothing to compare it to, but everyone loved it. My husband said it was better than what you'd find in a restaurant. I added a little dill and a TBS of ketchup per another reviewer. I would make this again!

Great East Tartar Sauce, I added a little more relish and onion (I grated the onion) and a 1/2 teaspoon of dried dill.  Other than that followed the rest and it was great.

I only used 1 T. of lemon juice, and used dill relish instead of sweet.  Chilled for a couple of hours, and it turned out great!  A nice simple recipe.

I loved this recipes.  If I had realized before that making tartar sauce was this easy and delicious I would've been making it forever.  I used chopped dill pickles instead of relish because I didn't have any and maybe just a splash of lemon juice because I didn't want it too runny.  It was great and I will never buy store bought tartar sauce again.

Excellent as written. I had limes on hand, so I used lime juice rather than lemon juice. Let the flavors meld for an hour, and tasted, excellent. Decided to mix in a teaspoon of dillweed and a half teaspoon of chopped capers. A couple hours later and excellent was fabulous!

Absoletely delicious!  Better than any prepared tartar sauce I have ever tasted.  My husband even liked it and voluntarily took the leftovers to work (a miracle) even though he doesnt care for fish or mayonaise.  I cant wait to make this again.  It was so easy and so delicious.

Used this recipe as a base, though changed it for our tastes. Used chopped dill pickle (about 4 T total) instead of relish; onion powder instead of fresh onion; juice of half a lemon. Also added about 3 T finely chopped celery leaves. The celery added a nice fresh flavor and was a pretty garnish. Made it about 20 minutes before the meal - it was great with our grilled halibut!

I've used this recipe for years..we never buy store brand tarter sauce. I use dill relish or dice up some pickeles, one added extra touch is just a hint of horseradish in the dish and it makes this tarter sauce superb.

Excellent- I halved the recipe and doubled the amount of onion and relish.  Also, I added a dash of garlic powder.  I ran out of mayo so I ended up using 3/4 mayo and 1/4 miracle whip, which worked out just fine since its a little sweeter and the relish I used was a no sugar added variety.  We ate this with fish and chips tonight, and I can't wait to use the leftovers for fish sandwiches Friday.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This tarter sauce is awesome, to be fair though I forgot the onion, so I threw some onion powder in it at the last minute. Also, used about a cup and half of mayo, three tablespoons lemon juice, three tablespoons of sweet pickle relish, pinch of sea salt, pinch of black pepper, yummmy!!!!!!!! Hubby doesn't even really like tarter and he loves this. :)

I've made this recipe a few times now. Its perfect! If you don't have sweet relish on hand, I'd suggest you pick some up and store it in your fridge. I've made this recipe with both sweet relish and minced sweet pickles & I have to say it tastes more authentic with the relish!

Ran out of tartar sauce and hadn't realized it until I was putting the fish into the oven! Whipped up a batch of this sauce and my husband and I were AMAZED!!! It tasted great. It really tastes much better than store bought. I will be using this again and again. Thanks for the great recipe.

Woweee! I would have never guessed I could make a homemade tarter sauce that tasted this good! I didn't really measure anything, just whooped up all the ingredients and my husband ate the entire dish with his salmon. He was scraping the bottom of the bowl! I don't eat seafood, but I slapped a bit on my steak and it was fantastic! Thanks for this simple and very delicious recipe!

Great and easy recipe!! My son would always buy tartar sauce from Rafferty's restaurant but not anymore. Just make sure you make ahead to give the onions a chance to set.
Thanks, Southern Charm

Awesome. My husband and Father-in-law loved it. I used onion powder instead of minced onion and just squeezed some lemon juice in it. I thought a tablespoon or 2 would make it to runny. And I used more than a tablespoon of relish more like 3 to 4. A tablespoon didn't seem like enough... Definitely a keeper. Won't be buying tartar sauce anymore. This recipe is too easy...  THANK YOU!!

This recipe was hailed "best I've ever had" by my son, the tartar sauce junkie.  I did embellish to make it unique.  I put in a bit more pickle relish, didn't have lemon, so I kept my fingers crossed and it was fine.  I added green onion and a few finely chopped fresh chive.  Also, I have a beautiful mix of Green Goddess dressing mix from Penzey's Spices - I added a tsp of that.  WOW!!!!  Sooooo good, I must admit.  A great basic recipe to create your own signature tartar sauce.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this tartar sauce. I have not looked back at the store bought. I did add some minced dill pickles as well as they suit my taste more than the sweet relish.

If it were up to me it would have had 5 stars but my hubby prefers it made with dill. I substituted onion powder in place of minced onion to save me some time and was very good!!

I thought I didn't like tartar sauce!  Thanks for converting me.  The only thing I did differently was an additional tbsp of relish - and I used sweet pickle relish.

This was super easy, and good! It's so much cheaper to make your own because these are items everbody has on hand. The store bought ones are 3.00 or more! I'm so glad I found this recipe. I'll never buy store bought again!

My husband can't stand store-bought tartar sauce, so I tried this with only a dash of lemon juice and he loves it. He says it's almost perfect, but it is missing "a little something" that he can't put his finger on.

Really great and easy recipe.  I added some fresh dill to mine though. Only made it just before I started cooking the fish and that was enough time for the ingredients to mingle. I used it as a sauce for fish tacos with a little shredded cabbage and cheddar--very tasty.

This was excellent!  I made it in the morning and let it marinade for the day.  I served it as a side for 'My Crab Cakes' (from this site) and the result was so amazing!!  It's better than store bought in my opinion.

I didn't follow the amounts.  I just threw everything together and it was GREAT!!!  I used dried minced onion.  Tasted good enough I will probably just always use this recipe rather than buying tarter sauce at the store.  Two thumbs up.

4 stars because I just mixed a cup of mayo (best foods) & some dill relish (2 tablespoons) with a sprinkle of parsley.  my husband loved it & said it tasted just like store bought- one less thing to buy!  yea!

This was a good recipe.  I love tartar sauce but I usually don't keep any on hand.  Now that's not a problem, I can whip some up at any time.

I think it's a perfect base recipe (definetly w/ the lemon juice).  Add whatever you like to make it "your recipe".  For me that was a dash of garlic powder and fresh cracked black pepper (although sometimes it's dill pickles and a shot of mustard!).

This is so easy and so much better than tartar sauce in a jar.  I used all the lemon juice, and it was perfect.

Great recipe.  I included the lemon juice and it was quite tasty.  Only change I made was to use onion powder instead of minced onion. (About 1/4 teaspoon).

Served it with broccoli, and red snapper, and oven fries. Delicious.

Thanks.

Believe it or not, this is the recipe I "thought" I invented about 35 years ago!  Just sometimes I add about 1/8 teaspoon celery seed.

My husband made catfish last night and we didn't have any tartar sauce.  I whipped this recipe right up and it tasted great! It'll probably taste better after being refrigerated overnight so the flavors will blend.  No more store bought tartar sauce for me either.

My husband cannot stop raving about this tartar sauce. He really likes it, and since we have been so disappointed with all the recent jars of tartar that we have bought, this sounds like a keeper. Thanks for the recipe. I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic. I was so glad to come across this incredibly simple recipe. I had decided to make fish but realized I had no tartar sauce then I found this recipe and saw I had all the ingredients and I was thrilled. I was even happier when I tasted it. Thanks a ton!

I had some immediately after making it and it was pretty good, but Diane is right----it tasted MUCH better after several hours.  I'll try to plan ahead from now on and make this the day before preparing fried seafood.

Great recipe, you saved the day, I had no dill pickles or dill pickle relish and this recipe did not require it.  Not only was I able to use the ingredients on hand but I believe it is better than the dill pickle recipes.
Thanks,
Ken

Very good recipe. I add an entire lemon, juiced. Also, I add 2 Tbsp sweet relish and about 1 Tbsp water (I don’t like thick sauce). Never buy store bought anymore.

I made the recipe with everything listed, using red onion, and dill relish, plus the lemon juice. I served it on fish tacos with a little shredded cabbage, and everyone loved it. Sides were black beans and rice topped with fresh salsa. Thank you - this recipe is perfect.

I only added more relish because we like it that way. My biggest problem is remembering to make it early so it has time to enhance the flavors and get cold.   This is our favorite and so easy to make.

Really quick and easy. I used dill relish because I don’t like sweet relish, but I did miss the sweetness that the bottled sauce has.. I’ll buy sweet relish just to make this again. 

TIP: You can substitute 1/8 teaspoon of onion powder if you don’t have minced onion or want to use the sauce immediately.

This tastes great!  I cut up some Famous Dave’s pickle chips, because I didn’t have any relish. I do not like raw onions, so I added a dash of horseradish for some kick. It turned out great.

Simple prep but delicious. OK, I did add a couple of other things. #1, I added a few dashes of Louisiana Cayenne Pepper Sauce. # 2, I chopped up about 1 1/2 T. of pickled Jalapenos. I also probably went heavy on the pickle relish because I eyeball things. (More than I should sometimes!). Anyway, Excellent. Thanks a bunch. [BTW... I did omit the Lemon Juice, as I am not a big fan. I used the Jalapeno Vinegar instead for the acidity.]

Used red onion (sweet and colorful), kosher dill pickle instead of sweet. Lot's of fresh ground black pepper. Let it rest in the moderate Midwest, cold slate countertop and I am impressed. Thank you for the recipe. This tartar sauce will go well with my grilled tuna steaks. Thank you again.

This turned out great! I added about a teaspoon of dill weed just out of personal preference. But I believe the recipe would’ve been just fine without it. For the onions I rehydrated some chopped dehydrated onions from my pantry instead of chopping fresh onions. Kind of gave the sauce a cafe/fast food-ish flavor but still good.

This is a great recipe although I only used about a teaspoon of lemon juice and added a tsp of dijon for a little kick. My son and I did not like the tartar sauce my other half bought as it had dill in it. I made this and it is perfect. Grating the onion works super well.
Tonight I made this again and was out of dijon. I had some prepared horseradish. ie grated in a jar. I added a teaspoon of it instead. My other half found a mini food processor at a garage sale si I sliced some onion and processed it then added the mayo and horseradish and blended again then stirred in the sweet relish. Wow!

Excellent basic recipe. After it had been in the fridge for a couple of hours, I tasted it and added more onion (in the form of powder). Next time I will double the onion. We like it to be more tart than sweet. Taste-testing is always your best bet!;)

This came out tasting very buttery for some reason. Maybe it was the mayo I used (olive oil hellman's). I did use the optional lemon juice. I made half the recipe and to fix the flavour i added more salt and pepper, 1/2 tbsp each of sweet pickle juice and dill pickle juice and 1 tsp of mustard. Hoping it tastes better in the morning.

It was okay. The quantity of breadcrumbs is a warning that these are traditional fish cakes, with a LOT of breading. The flavor was a bit bland. I baked them, instead of frying.

I made it with just the mayonnaise, relish and minced onion.
I added more sweet relish.  So good!

I had some salmon I wanted to use up, but no tartar sauce to go with it, so I looked here and found this recipe to make my own.  I probably used more than 1 tablespoon of onion (like 2 tablespoons), but otherwise stuck to the recipe. It was really good!  Much better than the store bought stuff (of course "homemade" always is).  I'll use this recipe from now on.  Thanks!

Great recipe!  I added a pinch of sugar in ours but I suspect it could be because I have to use a specialty type of mayo for my son.  This is perfect and I will not be buying tarter sauce at the store anymore!

I combined part of this recipe with Tartar Sauce II and McDonald's Tartar Sauce by adding the capers from the McDonald's recipe and the yellow mustard from Tartar Sauce II. I also used onion flakes instead of mixed onions. I never liked nor ate prepared tartar sauce but found this to be quite tasty, easy to make and will add it as a garnish to our seafood dishes. Even my husband, who doesn't like tartar sauce thought it was pretty good.

I never liked tartar sauce. I always use mayo on my fried seafood. But my husband likes tartar sauce. I thought about running out and buying some for our perch. On second though, I googled tartar sauce and found your recipe. I have a mincer and all of the ingredients that I need in my fridge, including a bag of fresh lemons. I decided to try it. I LOVE it! I needed the lemon and just a hint of the onion. I squeezed half a lemon into it but I used less onion, maybe 1/4 to 1/2 tbsn. plus the juice that squeezed out. I put extra relish as well. I tasted it as I went along and am very satisfied with the outcome. Thank you for changing my world.

Definitely add in the lemon juice at the end to get a desired consistency, you can absolutely skip the lemon juice if you want however. I added a dash of garlic for personal taste, very simple and easy to make!

Just like the others, this is an Awesome sauce that makes me wonder why I've bought  the store brands all this time. Made as directed next time I'll change it up and add some sriracha seasoning, and maybe even a bit of horseradish.

THe Tartar II recipe is actually better if you have the ingredients.  Salt is really not needed considering the pickles and mayo have enough.   You can use lime too and it still has a great taste. I use home made canned pickles and chop them up fine for the relish.  Definitely delicious in a fish sandwich

Amazingly simple and flavourful! We picked up items for fish and chips at the grocery store, but didn't want to spend $3 on a small jar of tartar sauce :/ I realized I had all the basic ingredients to make it at home, so I consulted this site and voila! Homemade tartar sauce that's just as good (if not better) than store bought! I added extra relish and lemon zest (instead of juice), but other than that, I followed the recipe as is. Quick and delicious!

This is a very nice basic tartar sauce recipe. Dill pickle is my preference to sweet relish so I use that instead. I also add about 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder.

I did not care for the onion, even with it grated, so I substituted onion powder. I also tried it separatly with both lemon and lime juice with good results from both.

Does not taste to good if you leave the onion out  (for allergy reasons), however, my family loves the recipe as is (with onion). It is also good with chopped pickles if you don't have relish on-hand.

A good basic sauce, just a bit too runny. Next time I will add more onion and relish. Maybe next time I will just dice my on pickles instead of using relish.

3 stars for a solid base recipe... but nowhere near a winning tartar sauce as written. Added to the 1 cu mayonnaise:
1. 2 to 3 T sweet relish (not 1 T), squeeze out juice on paper towels.
2. 1/2 a lemon's zest (no lemon juice)
3. 1/4 to 1/2 t fresh Dill Weed (or Dill Weed herb paste sold in a tube in the produce section), to taste. 
(Salt + pepper to taste)
Do these 3 things, and you'll never want to touch store- bought tartar sauce again.

I have been using this recipe for years. Rather than lemon juice I add dill pickle relish to give a little bite. Since moving to the Philippines it can be very difficult to find dill pickle relish but there is a member-only warehouse store here that sells the large bottles of dill pickles so I just mince up what I need to add to the tartar sauce.

Delicious!!!  Altered it slightly by using dill relish and only 1 tbsp. fresh lemon juice.  It was extra light and so tasty on our flounder.  Used Hellmann's mayo with olive oil and I think it just added to the lightness of the sauce - a definite plus.

I made it just now and it's pretty good.  I'm not usually a fan of tarter sauce but it will go well with the fish and chips I'm preparing tonight.  The freshness of making your own sauce is certainly a plus.  I think I would like a little more sweet pickle taste to it so think I might follow Amy Howard's lead and mince some bread and butter pickles up.  Then it should be perfect.

I used lite mayo and doubled the relish and onions. I made this for myself to add to a po' boy shrimp sandwich. My son, who typically doesn't like seafood tried it and requested that I make him the same sandwich the next day for lunch. When my 14 year old likes something he typically would never eat, I think that spells success!

This tartar sauce is amazing because I made it for my dad and almost everybody loved it! Cooking tip, if you don't have relish try bread and butter pickles, just chop them up into cubes. This was about the best tartar sauce I have ever tasted and, I don't like tartar sauce, until I tried this recipe!??this recipe!!!

Add a little French's  or a half tsp powdered mustard.  I also prefer chopped chives to minced onions.

Accidentally hit the done button before I was done... Using a dill pickle / relish is my preference. Instead of using black pepper use white pepper. I used dried dill instead of fresh. When using dry herbs make sure to crush them in the palm of your hand. This will wake up the flavor. As for lemon juice, I used just one small squeeze of a lemon wedge.

I made this to go with the excellent battered fish sticks from Costco.  I didn't use an entire cup of mayo - used more relish and onion and less lemon juice.  I thought this was quite good!

As is, this is a 4.5 star recipe, so I rounded up. It is very good as written and may already be how most people like it, though for our tastes, I at least double the relish (and use dill instead of sweet), add a little lemon zest,  and toss in chopped fresh parsley. After 20 years of being vegetarian, this is helping me learn to eat fish again!

Really delicious tartar sauce. I halved the recipe and used the exact ingredients. I used fresh lemon juice from a half lemon.

I made pan fried tilapia coated with McCormick Cajun Seafood Fry Mix from the supermarket  This tartar sauce went perfectly with the tilapia. The sauce was so good I wanted to eat it right out of the bowl!!!

Excellent tarter sauce! I did add fresh squeezed lemon juice, but probably wasn't the full amount. Also added some horseradish cream. Will definitely make again. Do not buy prepared tarter sauce!

Excellent! I didn't even need salt or pepper! I even made it in the mayo jar so I could just shake it! LOL The relish does need to be drained, I guess, because it was a bit liquid. I really like it better than the bought stuff, however, and my kids & I love it mixed with ketchup to dip or fish sticks in.

Excellent sauce!!! ... Like some others, I use zesty dill pickles rather than sweet (preferable taste for us).  I added a teensy bit of dill weed and a small dash of cayenne to give it a lingering, wonderful aftertaste!  Thanks for sharing!

Your recipe is delicious! Thank you Diane.   :)   I like red onion, 1 tablespoon Meyer lemon juice (slightly less sour), and 1 teaspoon Lisbon lemon-zest for some zing.

I used dill pickle relish instead of sweet relish, and it ended up tasting really great. I also used more relish and onion than the recipe called for - enough to make the sauce look more hearty. I chilled this sauce overnight and it really made the sauce taste like classic tartar sauce; when I tasted it right after I made it, the sauce just tasted like mayo and pickles. I really can't believe I've been buying tartar sauce in bottles for all these years when this recipe is so simple to follow!

Simple and delicious! I did add the optional lemon juice, and would do that again. Used this for our beer battered cod that we had tonight. I made a half recipe, which was the perfect amount for the 4 of us.

This is a very basic tartar sauce, not bad but tastes like mayo. I modified it. Triple the relish, double the onion and lemon, then add cayenne pepper. Flavorful tartar sauce with a mild spicy kick.

I made this for the first time today and absolutely loved it! I find that store-bought tartar sauce is too sweet so I wanted to try making my own. This is quick & easy to put together. I used about half the amount of lemon juice and thought it was perfect. You could add more relish if it needs to be sweeter. I wasn't sure about the onion but I added it anyhow since I like onion....and I'm glad I did because it really adds to the flavor. I only used a small amount of salt & no pepper. I agree with other reviewers when I say that I probably won't get store-bought sauce again.

Since I found this a bit too mayo - heavy in flavor (and I used reduced - fat w/ olive oil, by the way), I added about 2 tbsp of red wine vinegar.  Sweet relish isn't big in my family,  so I diced about 5 tbsp of dill pickles and added an extra dollop of onions, and after an hour my 4 yr old, who never likes to try ANYTHING new, proclaimed his new-found love for tartar sauce!

Way too much mayo in that recipe. I ended up using a lot more lemon juice (2 full lemons) and added some balsamic vinegar for some more tang, but really it just tastes of mayo.

Never buying store stuff again.  I skipped the lemon.  It makes a world of difference of what brand of relish you use.  We found we like it best when using Vlasic Sweet Relish.

This is a base recipe but I believe the following to be best:
-One cup of mayo
-2 Tablespoons of chopped deli pickle or dill relish as a back-up
-2 Tablespoons of chopped capers
- a Teaspoon of white vinegar
- fresh juice squeezed from half a lemon

My beloved Uncle Dick Taylor was a head chef at Bess Eiler's in Santa Monica, CA in the 50's.  As a new bride he gave me this recipe for tarter sauce.  It IS the BEST.  Dill pickle relish can also be used or a combo of both sweet & dill depending on your taste preference.

This is pretty much how I've done it for years.  Except I use dill relish or chopped dill pickle as I don't care for sweet pickle relish in my tartar sauce.

Wasn't thrilled with this recipe.  I found the onion to be somewhat overpowering, and the taste otherwise bland.

I LOVED this!  we used chopped up sweet bread and butter pickles and did 2 TBLSP. We used sweet onion.  Also, if you have lemons it tastes much better with fresh squeezed lemon juice.  We haven't bought tartar sauce since we found this, it is delicious and super easy!

Very nice traditional version of recipe. Easy for kids to make and learn allowing them to feel a part of the cooking process even at a very young age. Mine started making this at about 5 years old.

This is a good basic recipe; just tweak each of the ingredients to your liking. For a cup of mayo, I used 2 T of relish, 1 just wasn't enough for me. I used some onion powder instead of real onion because I didn't want the raw onion taste. I used 1 T of the optional lemon juice, and I think it really makes the tarter sauce. I didn't use any salt, but I added some black pepper.

Great basic recipe!  I did include the optional lemon juice and doubled the called for relish.  I used a liberal amount of black pepper.

ok, I didn't realize how easy tartar sauce is to make... the only change I made was, like a couple of reviewers, I put in a touch of onion powder instead of onions (because I was too lazy to chop).  I just a couple of drops of lemon juice.  Will make this again, the only thing different I think I will do next time is add a little bit more relish.

I made this recipe as directed with the exception of adding 1/2 TBSP more of sweet relish (just because we like relish).  I made salmon patties and realized about 20 minutes before dinner that I forgot to buy tartar sauce and whipped this up. I was only able to let it sit in the fridge for about 15 minutes and it was still delicious. My husband took leftovers to work the next day and said the tartar sauce was even better after it sit in the fridge overnight. I will never buy tartar sauce from the store again-- so quick and easy! Thank you for posting this recipe! My entire family loved it!

I tried another tartar sauce recipe today and Allrecipe's won, It's the easiest and the tastiest. The first recipe called for dill pickles which we didn't care for and the consistence was too loose. Allrecipe's calls for sweet pickle relish, which we prefer. I made it to serve with Pan Fried Oyster Spoons. A dollop of tartar sauce in the spoon topped with a warm oyster. I made the oysters yesterday and served in a spoon with homemade cocktail sauce and think this combination is the winner. The oysters heat up fine in the microwave so I know I can make them ahead, clean up the mess, and nuke them the next day. We like this recipe.

Wowzers that's easy and yummy!  I didn't have any pickles but did have some jalapeño sweet pickle relish. So good. I love spicy anyway so this worked out swimmingly. I will try it with dill pickles when I get another jar but for now, Wickles Relish is it!

Delicious and perfect! I did add a little more relish, just because I love relish! I didn't use the lemon juice, since I had no lemon and I used chopped up green onion! Very delicious! There was none left by the end! Thank you for sharing!

I prefer using that less dark less sweet (dill?) relish.  Although this recipe shows the lemon as optional I think it's essential otherwise you don't get that acidic bite that tartar is known for.

Easy base recipe! I like to use miracle whip in place of the mayo, several bread and butter chips instead of pickle relish, and a teaspoon of onion powder instead of the minced onion. I toss in a couple pinches of fresh parsley and a few dashes of dried dill. I like a little extra lemon squeeze too. Way better than the store bought kind.

Some of my family members are not big mayo fans, so we cut out half of the mayo and used plain yogurt in place of it. I think next time I will add a couple of shots of hot sauce.

I wanted to love this recipe, but should've gone with my instincts (and some of the reviews of others) and used dill pickles instead.  I am not a sweet pickle fan, so guess that was my fault! :-)  Next time, I will use dill pickles and some pickle juice instead of the lemon juice.  Also loved the suggestions of turmeric and some dill!  While this recipe was okay, I definitely plan to make it again, only with some changes.

Way too mayonaissey for me. And bland. Had to zing it up with various items, which makes it another tartar sauce entirely.

This was an easy and excellent tartar sauce. The key is the lemon juice, as I was making basically the same thing without it. WE are a dill family, but since that is just a preference, the recipe still deserves five stars. Thanks for sharing!

Good base recipe.  A little bland for our taste so I did have to add some things to it.  But a good base

even after sitting for hours it was too mayo-y. remade with onion powder, garlic powder, three times relish (DILL) and half the lemon juice. much better than store bought, but still needs tweaking. great base to work from, thank you.

EXCELLENT!  Of course you can change it up to suit your tastes, but this is a thousand times better than anything bottled; as far as a basic tartar sauce goes.  I've made this numerous times; by adding fresh parsley from my garden, outstanding!  Any fresh herb goes very well to change up the flavor since we eat fish a lot.  Surprise your tastebuds.  Even great with curry powder; go on experiment with it.

This is a great and easy tartar sauce recipe.  I followed the recipe (including the lemon) but wanted a little more bite to it so I added about a tablespoon of minced capers and let it sit for a couple of hours. So yummy! I will be making this again.

I wasn't sure just by tasting this after it sat for awhile, since it does not have the 'tartar sauce flavor' I was used to from a jar, but this was EXCELLENT with the Spicy Tuna Fish Cakes recipe from this site.

Better than any store bought tartar sauce!  & so much more worth it because it's easier (more than likely to always have the ingredients on hand) & cheaper!  This one was a big winner with us and will be our go to tartar sauce from now on!  I used fresh, minced, sweet vidalia onion.  Loved it!  Can't tell you enough how I proud I am to have found this recipe.  Thank you, we will be using this every time there's seafood for dinner!

Same recipe I've been using for about 30 years.  I don't use the lemon juice as it makes it too runny.  I usually use dried onion flakes and they "reconstitute" in the sauce while the other flavors are "marrying".  It keeps for a long time in fridge if you don't use it all up.

I know longer purchase tartar sauce.  I add a few dashes of hot sauce and use creole seasoning instead of salt/pepper.  Sometimes I add a little lemon pepper and dill.  Homemade tartar  sauce is the best!

I made this recipe exactly as written with 1 TBSP of lemon jucie.  I found it to be way too bland - added another 2+ TBSP of relish for it to have any kind of flavor.

I was in a jam, having no tartar sauce with lunch ready any minute. Had to change it a bit, but turned out great! Used MW instead of mayo, and a baby dill with some juice for the relish! I've never liked tartar sauce now!

Great recipe but I know now to only use a little bit of lemon juice as the amount shown in recipe waters the sauce down too much and I had to almost double the recipe to get the consistency correct.

I really liked this for how simple it was!  Way better than buying tartar sauce in the store.  I think with a little tweaking it will make an awesome sauce.

Super easy and excellent.  When something is this easy to make, it's a hit to make homemade - every appreciates it that much more and you have better control over the ingredients.

Good, simple and easy recipe. I chopped some sweet pickles to replace the relish and mixed in a little juice for that sweet zing flavor, and re-hydrated some dehydrated onion in the lemon juice instead since I was out of fresh onion.

This tartar sauce was so much better than store-bought. I used dill relish and added some of the juice into the mayo, skipped the lemon, used onion powder and added dill. The flavors are best if left to "marry" overnight. Everyone loved it on fried basa sandwiches!

Wow so easy.  I'll never buy bottled again.  I used light mayo and crystalized lemon and let it sit for a bit.  Don't skip the lemon it made all the difference.

Delicious, made it with light mayo and added a very heaping spoon full of sweet pickle relish.  I think the lemon juice really adds to the flavor!

Excellent!  We didn't have sweet relish so my husband used dill relish and a scant Tbs. of white sugar.  Yum!  We ate it right away and it was pretty good, but after it set about 5 hours....it was PERFECT!

This was the perfect accompaniment to our fish sandwiches tonight! The only changes I made was to use a little more relish and only used about 1 teaspoon of lemon juice, just for a little kick. Making this ahead really allowed the flavors to blend nicely. The flavor of this was really good and I will be using this recipe again, for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is my first rating of a recipe.  Made it according to directions exactly, and all I can say is "Yummy". It was fresh and creamy.  I didn't even wait, ate it with my fried cod.

I made this recipe for the first time today. I used a few drops of lime juice, since I live in Mexico and limes are more readily available. The tartar sauce was yummy!

I love that this consists of ingredients that one would usually have on hand anyway, so it's great to be able to make some when you need it. Every time I buy jarred tartar sauce, most of it goes to waste because it spoils before I get a chance to use it all. Now I just make my own when I need it, and it tastes so much better than store-bought! This tastes best if made a few hours ahead of time so the flavors have time to incorporate. Sometimes I add 1/2 T of dried dill for a cooler flavor.

Love this basic recipe; added lots more onion and combined both sweet and dill relish (much  more), added sea salt and cracked pepper, used lemon juice and whipped everything with a whisk.  I never measure so I go by looks and taste, lol.  I like mine more chunky not smooth so the more relish and onions the more chunky.  I also sprinkled a little Accent powder and that works great too.  Hubby and I love it and plan to use it on anything we can think of.  I made this for some left over fish and it was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great and quick recipe for tartar sauce.  It is yummy right after you make it but it is even better once you let it sit and chill.  No more store bought!!!!

The commissary here on Okinawa was out of tartar sauce.  I just made this substituting minced bread and butter pickles for the sweet relish which I didn't have.  I used all of the juice of one lemon.  Not sure how much juice that was but the sauce is a perfect consistancy.  Also added about 1/2 teaspoon fresh dill to the mix.  The taste is way better than the stuff in the jar.

I was in a hurry so I didn't measure or add the onion, salt, or pepper...and it still came out fabulous. I've never been able to make a good tartar sauce or find one I like at the store.  This one somehow came together wonderfully and we licked the bowl clean.   Update: I continue to use this as a base recipe, and continue to not measure. Still better than any jar I've ever used.

This is such a great recipe!  I'll never buy store-bought tartar sauce again!  Omitted the lemon, doubled the relish, and used a reduced-fat olive oil mayo.  Halved the batch and served one as-is and added cocktail sauce to the other half.  Yum!

This is so easy to make and superior to the stuff bought at the store. Very glad to have found this recipe!   I made a half batch the second time since it doesn't keep for long, and kept the relish at 1 level tablespoon. I usually make this in the morning, so it's nicely blended by the time dinner rolls around.

Simple, simple! This took me maybe 2 minutes to prepare. Very nice clean taste. I added about 1 tsp. of the juice from the relish just to thin it out a little. I wouldn't skip the lemon juice. The smell and taste of the freash lemon really makes this special.

I made this as written and found it to be very bland. Even after letting it sit overnight, the only thing I could really taste was the mayo. So, I added another Tbs each of the relish and minced onion and then added a couple of tsps of sugar, let it sit for another night and it was great the next day!

Great, simple delicious recipe. Definitely tastes better with time but still good if you need to use right away. I used the pickle juice instead of lemon and it was better!

This recipe has been in my family for over 30 years. The only difference is mine doesn't call for lemon juice.Mine calls for 1 TBLSP. of minced dried parsley. I make it all the time and everyone loves it.

Perfect tartar sauce...kid approved...great with fish sticks.  Pickle relish is easy because its already chopped finely, but you can chop up dill pickles as well.

This was just ok (fresh). It tasted a little like glorified mayo to me. Given, I'm not a big fan of mayo and I really made this for my husband. I did make some changes.  I used about half the mayo, a little bit more of the relish, added a few dashes of garlic powder, skipped on the lemon (I was out), and added a few dashes of celery seed. I tried it while it was fresh, we'll see how it tastes tonight for dinner.

I do not like tartar sauce, but I made it for my boyfriend along with salmon cakes and he loved it so I gave it a try.  Oh my god!  This tartar sauce is excellent, I paired it up with hot sauce on my salmon cake and it was soooo delicious!  This is a keeper!

I have used this recipe for many years.  My mom made tartar sauce this way, sometimes she would add a little ketchup if she didn't have the lemon juice. One review said that she used horseradish....I make shrimp cocktail sauce with ketchup,horseradish, a little salt & pepper.....my guys say it's the best!!!

This is so versatile, made it last night to go with  batter fried cod and wanted something to dip it in.  Did not have any sweet relish but I chopped up some sweet pickles very fine and used a tad bit of juice.  Probably used a little less lemon juice then called for but it turned out so fantastic.  My husband said he's not eating fish without this sauce again.

This is the perfect tartar sauce recipe.  I substituted dill relish for sweet relish and I didn't even need to add any salt and pepper.   I found that the sauce tastes better if you chill it for a day or so.  I served this with shrimp, and I also used it in a tilapia recipe.  A keeper!

Made this about a week ago...  was not sure about it at first, but I had used onion powder.  Microplaned some fresh into the sauce and let it sit overnight and WOW!  What a difference.  This is wonderful, and I see why it has such high reviews now.  Perfect on french fries, fish, and pretty much anything you can think of putting it on.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

After reading other reviews, I cut down on the lemon juice - adding only a few squirts.  Instead, I added a few dashes of lemon pepper.  It was delicious!!

This was just so-so for us.  I tried it as is, but ended up tossing it--then I doubled the relish and used half the lemon juice the second time around.  It was better, but still a bit bland for my taste.  Might be better with Miracle Whip instead of mayo for the flavor factor.

I don't understand why everyone is so in love with this sauce.  Yes, it's easy, but it is also rather bland.  I used twice the amount of relish, and then poured some pickle juice into it as well to try to give it some flavour.

Great recipe. I think the onions really added a great flavor to this sauce.

I'll never buy prepackaged tarter sauce again!  So simple and yet so much better than anything I've bought at the store.  Only change was instead of sweet pickle relish, I put dried dill weed.  I didn't have any relish but still found this to be very tasty.  Kids agree!

HOLY SMOKES WHAT A RECIPE!!!!! This is one kick  sauce! I didn't measure but eyeballed everything to my liking. I know I used more relish than called for, b/c I like it tart. I also just squeezed half a lemon. Wowie wowie, I'll never buy store bought again. Also fyi, the sauce didn't taste good to me when I first made it, but I tried it after letting it set in the fridge for 10 min. That's when it tasted GREAT!!!

I really liked this recipe though I used dill relish instead of sweet to suit our tastes.  I also cut back on the lemon juice because of the dill.

We had a dinner party with friends and I served this along with the Bodacious Broccoli Salad, Dave's Low Country Boil, Summer Potato Salad, Old-Fashioned Lemonade from this site, my own homemade cocktail sauce, lots of melted butter, french bread and lots of beer.  Then we proceeded to celebrate and immediately fall into a food coma, followed by a movie at the beach.  Summer Perfection!
