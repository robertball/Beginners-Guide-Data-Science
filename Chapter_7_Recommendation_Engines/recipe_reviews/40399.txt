They ARE the best meatballs, even though I use all beef most of the time. I don't fry, b/c I am too impatient, and the meatballs break up more that way. I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball hoagies, along with sauteed onions and peppers. They also freeze very well when baked this way. When I take these to parties, I always get requests for the recipe.

This is soooo close to my Nonna's authentic Italian recipe! I am telling you, these meatballs ROCK! Uh oh, the word is out!!! How funny! 3 meats, the breadcrumbs, plus 1 egg. You can also use fresh chopped spinach instead of parsley (or 1 pkg frozen, thawed and all water squeezed out) and pecorino romano cheese instead of parmesan. I make sure I have these on hand almost all the time, I use one lb of EACH meat, and it makes 30-40. Instead of frying, I par bake mine on a cookie sheet at 325 for about 10 minutes, then set the tray (if room allows) into the freezer for an hour or so. Pop them off the tray, into a couple of large freezer bags. Meatballs on demand!! Drop them into a sauce or steam in a glass casserole dish for about 5 minutes, they will be medium-well on the inside. Absolute crowd pleaser if you are making a big Italian dinner!!

I use beef, pork, and veal, as it is readily available in my supermarket.  Also, I bake mine instead of frying them, use parchment paper, 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  Then, if I have sauce simmering, I drop them in for the finale, or I freeze them for later use, or to give away to the children.

There is nothing I hate more than to get a mediocre or worse review from people who do not follow the recipe as written, and then judge YOU on it. I followed this to a "T" even though my experience as a chef was telling me not to. Too much cheese. Not enough garlic. And "salt and pepper to taste" is a personal pet peeve. If you are going to post a recipe, include all the measurements, or be prepared to take your lumps. This recipe is good enough to avoid disaster, but DO NOT FRY. They stick to the pan and melt away when you add them to the gravy(tomato sauce). Instead, bake them for about 35 minutes at 350. Then, put them in the gravy for the last hour or two. Replace half the cheese with more breadcrumbs. Less mess, healthier and easier.

Honestly, I was skeptical using water in a meatball recipe, but it was really great!  I scaled to 4 servings, used only beef, 85%, 1/2 cup italian style breadcrumbs and Kraft parmesan cheese, as my young children do not yet appreciate the stronger flavor of "real" cheese, and they both said they were the best meatballs ever.  Also, I did not fry them, to cut down on fat and clean-up, and they kept their shape just fine.  I just put them in the gravy and cooked them on simmer for 30 minutes.  The sauce was a simple marinara, just sautee 2 cloves of garlic, add 3 cans of crushed tomatoes, 1 can paste, 3/4 c. water and simmer.  Add 1T oregano, 1t. basil, 1t. onion powder, salt and pepper and voila!  Geanine and I teamed up to make an awesome dinner!  Thanks Geanine!

This IS the best Italian Meatball recipe ever.  My ex-mother-in-law gave me this recipe more than 25 years ago.  We use italian style breadcrumbs and much less liquid (about 1/4 cup milk). What makes it so good is the ratio of meats.  You can adjust the flavorings to suit your family's taste.  Once browned, the meatballs can finish cooking in the frypan or by baking, or even add them to the sauce.  I would recommend this basic recipe to anyone.  Excellent addition to Allrecipes.com.

Thank you Geanine!  My husband told me that these were absolutely the best meatballs he had ever tried!  I didn't pan fry them in olive oil - I simply dropped them into a crockpot full of homemade spaghetti sauce and let them cook with the sauce all afternoon.  Also, I used italian style bread crumbs instead of making my own - just used a third cup less.  My husband absconded with the leftovers to take to work this morning, and three people from his office called me today to get the recipe!  Will ALWAYS use this recipe for spaghetti and meatballs!

Wow, This is the way that I make my meatballs (recipe from my Mom, not some cookbook), but instead of using water, we use milk, and soak the bread in it, and also skip the olive oil browning, as the meat produces enough fat for the browning proceedure.  Thanks Geanine!

Exactly the way I make them, except I don't use quite as much water and I don't fry them. I drop them in the sauce to cook.  Makes the sauce taste awesome.

Good, standard recipe. For a variation, try using ground italian sausage in place of the pork, along with some minced onion. I also add anise seed to both the meatballs and my sauce. The anise seed really makes it.

These definitely are some of "The Best Meatballs"! Using three types of meat really makes a difference and a good rule of thumb to ensure moistness is one egg for every one pound of meat. These were delicious - so good you almost could eat them by themselves, but even better when accompanied by an equally good spaghetti sauce. I used a compination of Parmesan and Romano cheeses. I put the Italian bread into my mini food processor and gave it a whirl to produce bread crumbs. Instead of water I used milk and only enough for the meatballs to hold their shape. You don't want these to be mushy or falling apart. I didn't use the olive oil to fry them in a pan but instead I put these into a baking dish and baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes. These were very moist and full of flavor -excellent recipe!

I have my own "best meatballs" but every now and then I like to try something different. What I particularly liked about this recipe was the combination of three meats, the addition of Romano cheese (Parmesan would work equally as well), and the fact that it's not loaded up with commercial "Italian Seasoning."  But I did back off on the cheese to 1/2 cup and added twice as much garlic - I think the amount of cheese called for is far too much.  I also used milk rather than water, just enough for the bread to absorb, then squeezed it dry.  I didn't want the mess of frying, so I took the easy way out and baked them on a large cookie sheet at 400 degrees for about 20-25 minutes.  At that point I tossed them in the Crock-pot with some of my homemade tomato sauce and let it all marry for several hours.  This made a LOT of meatballs for Hubs and me, and was just what I had in mind for easy meals for the next couple of nights while we take care of last minute packing and preparations for our return to Italy! There was even enough to give a good amount to Mom! While I'll always be partial to "my own" way of making meatballs (actually Grandma's and Mom's meatballs I grew up on), this was a pretty darned good meatball (backing off on the cheese), with just a few simple ingredients.

I first reviewed this in Dec. of 2011. I don't mind people posting recipes that belong to someone else but come on, give them credit. I'm sure Rao's Restaurant in Harlem could care less, but I've read every post since then and you never did give the proper credit. In my book, that kind of makes you a thief!! Live with it.

For the last 25 yrs I have used my Italian mother-in-law's meatball recipe (and they are good) but these are great!!  I told her about them and will bring some over Sunday for her to try.  A little tip; I fry a tiny meatball to taste for seasoning before I cook the whole batch.  Then you can add more cheese, salt, garlic, etc. Great recipe!!

Like others, I baked my meatballs.  I made mine a little smaller than a tennis ball.  I baked them on a cookie rake with a foil-lined cookie sheet underneath for 25 minutes at 375 degrees.  Instead of the called for water, I used 1/2 c. water, and 1/2 cup milk and substituted 1 c italian bread crumbs.    My family LOVED these!!

I only gave this four stars because I feel the olive oil and the water are so unnecessary. If you are using ground pork in your meatballs, trust me, there will be plenty of grease to keep them moist and delicious. No need whatsoever to add additional oils. And the water? That I truly don't understand at all. I make these without either the oil or water and they are super moist and extremely delicious!! Without those two unnecessary ingredients, and the addition of basil this easily goes to five stars and above!! Oh, I also do not fry my meatballs. I use a cookie scoop to make them a uniform size and drop them onto a cookie sheet lined with no stick foil (for super easy cleanup and easy removal from thee pan). I bake them for 40 minutes at 350 degrees F. Then I add some to my sauce and freeze the rest for another day, another meal. These are GREAT for meatball sandwiches!!

This meatball recipe is great! I just made them this evening for dinner and they came out great...I changed a couple of things, but it still came out great! I used ground beef only.  I substituted italian style breadcrumbs for the bread as Michelle suggested in her review, and I added some italian seasoning as well as parsley and basil to the meat mixture, I found no need for the water and the oil, so I omitted the water and the oil.  I find that baking meatballs is so much better and healthier than frying, and they seem to keep their shape better also.  The trick to this is, not to over bake them because they can dry out quickly if you don't keep an eye on them so I just use my timer on the oven and it works great, but don't cook them for more than 30 mins in the over.  I put a very light coat of oil on a glass pan, you can also use cooking spray as well. I cooked the meatballs on 350 for 20 minutes while I was preparing the sauce and then added a few extra minutes to complete the sauce.  As soon as, I got the sauce started I put the meatballs in right away and simmered them with the sauce for about an hour, every thing came out great!  Maybe it depends on the size of the meatballs also, but I made mine the size of golf balls, if they cook for only 30 mins they're more than likely not going to be cooked all the way through, but they will finish cooking with the sauce simmering for about an hour, plus some of the fat from the meat will give the sauce lots of flavor!

This recipe is from Rao's Restaurant in Harlem NY. Only difference is less water and more garlic; Google it for yourself. How can you take credit for someone else’s recipe?

I tried this recipe the first time 3 weeks ago when I had compny over and I loved it.  So did everybody else, so much so I was asked to bring them to a dinner party. Again they were a hit. I use Merlot in place of water, takes it to a different level, enjoy!

OMG!!! These are the BEST meatballs I have ever had! And we make meatballs on a regular basis since my family is from Europe! But these are better than ever! I used Parmesan cheese instead (I had that in the freeze) since I have kids, and followed the recipe to the dot!!!! Hubby and kids just devour them too quickly! I made 2 batches, and froze 1 batch! Oh and I baked them in the oven instead of frying them: 45 min. on 450 F. Heavenly! THANK YOU for the recipe!!! It's a keeper!!! ;)

I cut this recipe by half. I totally agree with the recipe submitter. Using fresh bread crumbs and fresh cheese is totally key. I did add about a teaspoon of homemade italian seasoning and now that I think about it, I totally spaced the egg but you know, I didn't even notice it was gone. I did not fry mine, I used a cookie scoop to make even balls and lined them up in my biggest baking dish and baked them at 350* for 30 minutes. The outcome was wonderful, I could just pour off the grease and add to my marinara. One of the tenderest, flavorful meatballs I've ever had made even better when paired with a homemade marinara. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Geanine!

Frying is time consuming, but it's great to know I could also bake them at 400 degrees for 20-25 minutes if I find myself without the time to fry, roll, fry, roll, fry, roll, drain...

The cheese and seasoned bread crumbs taste great. I couldn't find ground veal or pork at my supermarket, so I used a pound of Italian sausage in its place... tasted great!

Have been preparing meatballs this way for years, only exception is, I add basil, oregano, 1 egg per pound of meat and milk for the liquid.  I use to fry, but have changed over to baking them first before adding to my sauce.......they also freeze well after baking for use at a later time without losing their flavor......ME

I followed this recipe to a T and it came out perfect.  It tastes exactly like my mothers recipe.  My husband goes nuts for this.  Definitely a keeper.

This was my first attempt at meatballs and they came out great! I only had about 1 1/2 lb of 80/20 ground beef, so I tweaked the recipe accordingly. I still used 2 cloves of garlic, 2 eggs, regular dried parsley, and equal parts salt and pepper. I kind of tossed in around 1/2-3/4 cup grated cheese, around 1 cup of Italian bread crumbs, and about 1/2 cup olive oil. I didn't add any water to the mix since it was perfect as is and I fried the meatballs in olive oil until browned. I then added them to my sauce and let them simmer for about an hour. They were some of the best meatballs I've ever had! This is definitely a great base meatball recipe!

I love these meatballs - they are so tasty.  I use all three meats, and asiago cheese instead of Romano (what I had in the house).  I also microplane an onion and add it to the mix, cutting back the water by about a 1/2 cut (since the microplaned onion is pretty watery.  Adds a nice flavor.  I also use dried parsley flakes as I hate buying a huge bunch for 1 1/2 tablespoons.  I use a large cookie scoop to make my meatballs a nice even size.  Like others, I bake my meatballs in the oven on cookie sheets at 375 for about 25 mins and at 350 for another 15 minutes. I freeze half of the meatballs and keep the other half available in the frig.  Try 'em, you'll like 'em!

I made some minor changes but this recipe is a great start!  I used ground turkey and italian sausage in place of beef, pork and veal.  I used skim milk in place of the water and probably only used about 1/2 cup.  I grilled the meatballs on foil pans, about 8-10 minutes before turning.  Yummy!

This recipe is very similar to mine.  You don't need to add water.  Just soak your bread in milk for about 10 minutes, then squeeze the bread and add to your meat mixture.  Also one cup of olive oil is way too much!

The secret to these meatballs is the amt. of cheese, the more the better!  I use 1 cup breadcrumbs and 6-8 sclices of stale bread soaked in water or milk. I discard the rest of the water.  I also use the parsley, but add about 2-3 tbs of fresh chopped basil...oh sooo sweet. Then just enjoy the compliments and the taste. These meatballs are very close to my Granny's.  She was born and raised in Italy.

This is the typical Italian meatball recipe - best to use Italian bread crumbs (I freeze left-over bread and take out as much as I need).  I soak it in water - milk  is also OK - squeeze the liquid out and add the crumbs to the meat with the other ingredients - frying was what was always used, but most of us want to eat more healthfully and bake  them.  I add them to tomato sauce and let it simmer for a long time - 1-2 hours usually - the meatballs really get the flavor of the sauce.  Dropping raw meatballs in sauce does not appeal to me (my preference) - I feel the fat in the meatballs adds up in the sauce - frying or baking does release some of the fat.  My opinion only.
But am happy to see that so many people are going back to so many original recipes.

To reduce the fat significantly, I bake the meatballs at 400F until a meat thermometer comes out to 145-150F (about 30 minutes, depending on your oven).  This makes less mess, less fat, and they taste yummy.  I then put the cooked meatballs into the marinara sauce and simmer in a slow cooker.  Also, instead of water in the meatballs, try milk instead.  Last, I always use ground beef, no pork nor veal.  They still come out delicious and have a bit less fat.

The last time I made meatballs, they were too dry.  Not this time!  These were moist and delicious.  The beef/pork/veal is a great combination.  I used 93% lean beef, but after I bought it, I was afraid I should have gone with a higher fat content to prevent drying out.  But no, they were perfect.  I cooked them in a slow cooker for 10 hours in the sauce.  Great with spaghetti and made yummy subs the next day!

Being Italian I have spent  a good part of 53 years trying different recipes.....this is now my Meatball recipe.  You have to have the fresh Romano and I used Panko breadcrumbs, a little less water and put them right in the sauce.  So so good.  I always put onions, peppers and garlic in the good processor so you cant even see them in the sauce but you get the wonderful flavor.  Add some thin boned porkchops like my nana taught me and you are feasting.  Thank you.

I'd give it  10 *s if I could. ***You can sneak (add) pureed veggies with mixture for kids, they'll never know!*** just reduce the water. I will say that I didn't do the veal, however, I just upped the pork & ground beef ratio, it was enough flavor.  Def. agree w/ Fresh Romano & parsley, there's the secret! BAKE THEM! On the cookie rack on the baking pan, don't fry! Lay on paper towels to draw fat. They turned out incredible, we served them with my fresh marinara, side w/ penne in pesto. Of course, there's more than enough, so I froze the next dozen and we had some again sliced on homemade pizza, then again later,  with more marinara on sub rolls topped with shredded Italian cheeses.  I'll make them again for sure!!

Sorry to do this but I did change the recipe a bit.  I used 1# of gr. beef and 1/2# of mild Italian sausage.  Used an Italian herb mix, parsley, garlic and dried red onion.  To that I added 1/2 c. bread crumbs (made from several-day old sturdy white bread) which I mixed with 1/4 c. of milk.  Let the bread crumb/milk mixture sit long enough to let the crumbs absorb the milk before adding to the meat mixture.  Added 1/2 c. grated parmesan and 2 eggs, a teaspoon each of salt and pepper.  Mixed everything up well and used my cookie scoop to make perfect size meatballs.  Baked in the oven (350 degrees) for 30 minutes.  This made 23 meatballs (a little smaller than golf ball size).  Perfect!  Thank you, Geanine, for submitting this recipe, without it I wouldn't have had good meatballs.

OMG - soooo delicious!!!  I followed the recipe exactly, except I used italian bread crumbs (vs. the homemade kind)...and I baked the meatballs for 40-45 mins on 350.  This was probably the best meal I've ever made!  I saved the remaining 1/2 pound of veal and pork for another meal (wrapped it in plastic wrap and placed it in the freezer).  I am not a very confident cook, but these were quick, easy, and very do-able for anyone who wants to make a delicious meal.  I made a homemade tomato sauce to go with it and added some linguini.  YUMMMMM!!!

Similar to why my Italian grandmother and mother make.  I use Italian Bread Crumbs and instead of water, I use milk.  It binds better.  I do not fry my meatballs but I do bake them "semi done" in the oven  on a rack for 17-19 minutes, depending on how big they are.  I use some immediately and freeze the rest.  Always have meatballs ready this way.

Not "the best"  but good.  I can't figure out why anyone would fry meatballs?  I form them into balls and freeze them on a cookie sheet, transfer to freezer bags and cook a few in sauce as needed.  So I used none of the olive oil.  I used basil instead of parsley as I find parsley bland.  I added the water slowly, and didn't use the full 1.5 cups.  Chop the garlic very fine so it gets evenly distributed in the mixture as well.

I made this with 1lb extra lean ground turkey breast and 1lb 93% ground beef, used about 3/4 c dry red wine instead of water. Baked 10-15 min at 350 F. I added no salt because of salt in Romano cheese. They turned out awesome! I also made Best Marinara Sauce Yet, served with whole wheat spaghetti and these meatballs, plus leftover szchuan green beans from takeout Chinese!  I froze remaining sauce and meatballs for great lunchbox meals. I will definitely make this again.

good recipe, but if your cooking spaghetti and meatballs cook the meatballs in the sauce.  Cookingthe meatballs before hand in a pan or the oven robs them of the rich flavor that can only be had by slow cooking them in your sauce.

I followed another review's suggestion and baked for 30 minutes at 350 instead of frying.  they came out PERFECT.   Made for 24 golf ball sized meatballs.  12 for now and froze 12 uncooked for later use.   I made a few adjustments.    I used 1 teaspoon dried italian seasoning in place of the fresh parsley.    I also used only 2/3 cup of bread and moistened with milk instead of water.    Authentic italian meatballs that will now be in my family for years to come!

Have made these time and time again as stated and altering slightly with what I have on hand. I prefer using the day old bread but have used italian breadcrumbs(2 cups not needed-more like 1 1/2 cups) and have even used both stale bread and italian breadcrumbs.  All good variations.  I add water until I get the softness I like.  Usually 1 cup-if you dont like soft balls you can tell when mixing wether they will be softer or harder.  I do broil mine 5-8 minutes then flip and broil for another 5 minutes and toss in my sauce. Whatever is left I freeze.  Simply wonderful.  Meatballs are suppose to be simple and delicious-with just a few seasonings to make them grand- please dont let the person who rated them as BLAND..stop you from trying these(maybe they should try meatloaf-hehe)  These are the bomb.

This recipe is a good Italian recipe but try using milk instead of the water. Plain unflavored breadcrumbs in a can work just as well and you can moisten them ahead of time with the milk to make it easier to mix in. 1 cup of olive oil for frying is a bit much. Save yourself all the grease and line a cookie sheet with foil and place the meatballs close together and bake in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes or till done. They come great!

Really fantastic!  This recipe is very similar to my Italian neighbor who owned an Italian restaurant. They are delicious and I always use tri-color meat~~~beef/pork/veal.  It makes a much tastier and tender meatball than just beef alone.

These were delicious.  I was cooking for my husband and myself, so I cut the recipe in half.  Also, I only had ground turkey on hand, and used that instead of the trio of meats.  I added 1 teaspoon of italian seasoning, and I mixed in some parmesan cheese with the romano.  I didn't have any fresh parsley on hand, so I used 1 teaspoon of dried parsley.  Also, instead of adding all water to the mixture, I used 1/4 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of water.  Magnificent.  This recipe is a keeper.

I used 1/2 beef, 1/2 pork. Also used store-bought bread crumbs and much less liquid. Very good recipe! Excellent flavors, nice texture.

THIS is coming from an Italian who has made her meatballs like this recipe for years just like my mom made.  Only difference is I soak my Italian bread in water and squeeze out the liquid and crumble it into the meat and use milk instead of water for more moisture.  So glad the video emphasized using FRESH ITALIAN PARSLEY and not the curly stuff.  Also the fresh garlic and the good grated cheese are what makes these over the top.  
PLEASE, PLEASE NEVER COOK THE MEATBALLS IN THE SAUCE.  You won't get that crispy outside, just boiled meat. Some people roll their meatballs in bread crumb before frying. You could put them in the oven, but I like frying best.

I spent 17 summers in Italy and have had amazing meatballs and never could find a recipe that I loved until now! I use Italian seasoned breadcrumbs & bake the meatballs first. I have tried it with the 3 meat combinations and I've also done it with just beef. The 3 meat combo is the best, but don't hesitate to try this with just beef if that's all you have. I do bake mine for 17 minutes at 400 degrees on a cookie sheet.  I used to bake at 350, but the inside juice will all come out of the meatball. you want to cook at higher temp so it tramps in the ingredients/flavor! As far as the amount of water, I use the amount directed. You know it's the right consistency if, after the ingredients are all fully mixed, it doesn't stick to the bowl....the full meat mixture adheres together, if meat sticks to your fingers in clumps, it's too moist. (I did use too much water once and the meatballs fell apart). A mistake I can see many making is not using enough sea salt. You need a considerable amount.  I just used 6 lbs of ground meat and used a handful of salt. If you follow the recipe given you would probably need 2 heaping tablespoons of sea salt. You cannot just sprinke some salt and think that's enough. you need a decent amount. Finally, what really will give your meatballs 5 stars is the sauce you put them in!

Great recipe! I would recommend that you DON'T fry or bake the meatballs before putting them in the sauce.  I've been making meatballs for 50 years and have realized that just putting them in the sauce for 20 minutes (no more than 20 minutes) allows for the tenderist, moistest, most delicious meatballs ever.

I made these this past weekend. The mixture is the same as my Italian Nana's. It only needs 1/2 cup of water, and you need to let the mixture rest for about 30 min. before you make the balls.  Heat olive oil to med. high, gently roll them,under cook, and drain, before you add then to your "gravy" sauce. I usually build my sauce in the same pot as I saute the meatballs in so I can take up all the tasty little bits.

This is a tasty meatball.  I, too, used milk instead of water.  I have made a very similar recipe and used beef and pork because ground veal is hard to find.  My mother either baked the meatballs first, OR she carefully dropped the raw meatball one at a time in the gentle boiling sauce, and did not stir until the meatball was set (about 30 minutes)  The outside of the meatball is just as tender as the inside.  Either way, this is a saver.

I love these meatballs.  I used 1 1/4 c of Italian bread crumbs instead of Italian bread.  I used fresh grated parmesan cheese. I also baked instead of frying them.  Put em on a cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Yum!

AWESOME!!  Everyone in my family loved these, even the 11 yr old who doesn't like meatballs.  I only used ground beef & ground turkey.  They still turned out amazing.  I will be making them again & again.  BTW: they freeze beautifully, so make a double or triple batch & be ready for a quick dinner another night!

FANTASTIC!!!  I (and family) loved this recipe...only change was that i did not have dry stale bread to crumble so I used 2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs.  I also used a couple more cloves of garlic since we like garlic.. I fried in only a couple teaspoons of olive oil, that's all you really need, a cup seems much.  Olive oil is actually good for you so I did not mind.  I also added a couple tablespoons of worcheshire to half the mix to see if they would taste different...it added a tiny bit more flavor, but w/o is just as good.  I also baked at 350 for 20 more minutes just to make sure they cooked all the way.  This is my new meatball recipe for life!  p.s. MAKE SURE TO USE ROMANO CHEESE like recipe calls for AND NOT PARMESAN, tastes better.

This was absolutely amazing! I changed a few ingredients but this is the recipe I will use from now on.  First, I substituted milk for the water, then I used progresso bread crumbs instead, and I used sweet italian sausage instead of the pork and veal. You HAVE to try it this way, it's delicious.

This is certainly the best meatball I have made as far as consistency goes. The flavor could be amped up a bit...but it's great just as it is with a nice sauce. I did not fry them either. I placed in fridge to firm up a bit and then baked for 20 mins before placing in crock pot of sauce. Very good.

I had horrible luck with these meatballs.  I think they would have been okay if I hadn't added the water, but they just fell apart on me...  I think I'll stick with my regular recipe from now on...  :/

I am not a great fan of meatballs in spaghetti but my husband is.  He thought they were absolutely wonderful and I actually enjoyed them too.  Very simple to make.  No need to use oil in the pan when you brown the meatballs.  I will definitely make these again.

Too much bread - and - adding water to a meatball recipe is something I never heard of in my Italian family. Cut down the bread and get rid of the water.

I honestly couldn't taste the difference using 3 types of ground meat.  Its a great recipe but I'm not sure if the 3 different meats are worth your spent money.  I'm giving this 5 stars because they tasted excellent.  If you use the 3 different ground meats... just know it was expensive.

Absolutely wonderful, I used only 1 cup water and would lessen the romano a bit next time, and then I baked them in the oven for 40 minutes @ 350.  They were tender, moist, and very flavorful!  Will definitely make again!

My family and i loved these meatballs but i made some changes.. I only used 1lb of Italian sausage and 1lb of ground beef. I used dry parsley and Panko parmigiana bread crumbs. I used 2cups of olive oil by accident and 1 cup of warm water. I think it made around 38-40 meatballs. They were absolutely amazing......

These are very similar to the meatballs I've made for years and years - same as what my mother and grandmother made!  I use dry seasoned breadcrumbs - about 1 cup for this recipe and I add a small grated onion, about 1 T. Italian herbs and about 1 cup milk instead of the water.   I bake these to save on the fat from the oil.  These are always a hit!

These meatballs are so light and tasty!  I used just pork and beef, but followed the recipe other than that.  I fried them until they were crisp but they weren't cooked through, then froze them on a cookie sheet and popped them all in a freezer bag.  I grab as many as I need whenever I want and put them right into my sauce to thaw and cook through.  Yum!

Delicious!!!  These were simple to make but tasted like they took all day.  The only thing I did different was I used half parsley and half italian seasoning for personal preference.

Its a great recipe, to make it better, I suggest milk instead of water, use bread cubes instead of crumbs,and broil meatballs, turning to brown evenly, then cook in sause. Now you've got meatballs!

I'd have to say these meatballs were delicious!  I didn't add the veal though...it was a little expensive.  So, I added a little more pork and beef and it worked out just great.  I also added chopped onion for a little extra flavor and then added them to a baked mostaccioli....Mmmmm, Mmmmm...Good!

I make a lot of meatballs and wasn't impressed with this recipe...I never mixed different meats before and was excited to try it, but I couldn't taste the difference and it was much more expensive. I also prefer to bake them on a baking sheet instead of fry them in so much oil.

These meatballs were DELICIOUS!!!!! My family loved them and I will definately make them again. I substituted milk for the water and used a little less of the liquid than the recipe called for. This recipe is a keeper!

Love these. I bake for 30 mins at 350 instead of frying. Place a cooling rack in a cookie sheet (bake meatballs on rack)so grease drips off.  I also use milk instead of water. Very, very good!

This is a great basic meatball recipe! I modified the recipe for what I had on hand and from reading other reviews. I used 1lb ground Italian pork sausage (such as Jimmy Deans) and 1 pound of ground turkey because it is what I had on hand. I also substituted 1 cup of dried Italian bread crumbs in place of the stale bread and used grated parmesan cheese instead of fresh romano. I also used 1/2 cup milk instead of water. I baked these meatballs in the oven for 30 minutes at 350° and then added them to my sauce. My Husband and I both raved about the meatballs and we over ate because they were so good. We even fought about who got the take the left overs the next day for lunch. Truly a great starter recipe and I love that cheaper/easier substitutions can be made and they are still great.

I have been making these for years.  For those of you who say that the water is bizarre, I agree.  However, once you've done it you will understand. Do not use milk and don't skimp on the cheese.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but my family thought these were awful.  Followed recipe to the tee except only fried half because they were falling apart.  Placed remaining uncooked meatballs in my sauce to simmer.  My entire house smelled of the romano cheese (very strong). I always use parmesean cheese in my meatballs, who knows, maybe the romano was bad...  Between all the fresh ingredients, bread, salad, wine and the take out food, it was an expensive night... I had such high hopes because they looked amazing and the reviews were great:(

The only thing I do differently making meatballs is I soak the dry Italian bread in water, squeeze it out and crumble it into the meat mixture. I like to fry them so we can eat some before I put them in marinara sauce. The truly are the best meatballs!

Instead of water add spaghetti sauce or half sauce and half milk for more flavor.
Also, do not saute meatballs;instead place on a baking sheet and bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes and then finish cooking in sauce.  Much
easier and meatballs stay round!    Janet

Thank you, Geanine!  I had to make some adjustments and according to my family, they're still 5-star quality: 1) doubled the recipe - as long as your taking the time to fry these, make it worth your while, 2) no veal at my grocery store, so replaced with ground chuck (80/20%) - thus, it's 3 pounds ground chuck and 1 pound ground pork; 3) cost of fresh grated Romano was out of my budget, so one, 8 oz. plastic shaker of a  50/50% Romano/Parmesan blend; 4) no stale Italian bread on hand, so 1 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs for a double recipe.
While I agree with Geanine that freshly grated cheese and bread crumbs may be more flavorful, the prepared cheese and bread crumbs are much more time-efficient and cost-effective.

I bake these for 35-40 minutes at 350 degrees instead of frying.  The only other change I make (personal, nothing against the original recipe) is to add 3/4 tsp. dried marjoram and some minced fresh basil.

Wonderfully tender and tasty, not overly spiced. I also bake mine at 350 for 45 min. but I dip each one in olive oil, and place on a cookie cooling rack over parchment lined cookie sheets and use an ice cream scope to make them uniform in size. I double the recipe, and freeze them.

This recipe is almost a duplicate of my Italian grandmothers meatballs, which she kept a coveted secret right to the grave!   I've experimented over the years to get something close, but this recipe filled in the blanks for me.   The combination of the meats and the tips provided by others to bake the meatballs and not fry them was essential.   I couldn't be happier with the result!  SUPER EXCITED!!

My daughter was looking for a recipe to use for her ninth grade cooking class final project. She decided on an Italian theme and we made these meatballs. Made exactly as written and the flavor and texture was excellent. We made very large meatballs, but next time will make smaller, maybe golf ball sized. Served over spaghetti with home made tomato sauce. Awesome!

This is the best meatball recipe I have used bar none!!! We have been to best restaurants in New York, and have made meatballs for over 40 years.
I made this three times, but never had a copy of recipe. We had used all  the same ingredients for years except the warm water. That made the consistency tender and terrific!!!

I used equal parts of meat, and substituted the pork for italian sausage.  I removed the casings first.  I soaked my bread in milk instead of water and then squeezed most of it out.  You can fry the meatballs or bake at 350 for 30 minutes.  This is easier.  I also use a nice handful of fresh parsley. I then add the meatballs to the home made sauce which has already been simmering for 30-45 minutes, and simmer for an additional four hours.

Very good recipe! Mixing two or three kinds of meat
is a very good idea. Also water in the mixture is a must for really soft meatballs. Rolling the balls in flour before frying helps to keep them in perfect shape. If you prefer not to fry it is not necessary. Cooking them directly in a sauce or baking them also is very good, this way you avoid loads of calories and much healthier. Another good practice is to use old bread, preferably whole wheat, instead of dry bread crumbs, soaked in water. Using different spices one prefers also is good idea. These meatballs are really great for parties!

A M A Z I N G !  My new favorite meatball recipe! Only changes I made were:  I used fresh sourdough bread to make my own bread crumbs. Only meat I used was- ground beef.  I followed the directions to a T. The meatballs were tender and full of flavor!  You must try this recipe.

Thank you for the recipe!  I made this last night and my husband's response was "These are the best meatballs I have ever eaten".   I did use chopped fresh spinach as I didn't have the Italian flat leaf parsley and I baked them on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet.  A tip if ground veal is hard to find, your grocery store may have "meatloaf mix", which is a beef, veal and pork mixture.

Made these today using all 93% lean ground beef and other wise exactly as written.  I didn't prefry or bake... just formed them and put them in my spaghetti sauce, simmered for a bit, and then baked in the oven low and slow.   HEAVENLY!!!  I'll definitely be making these again... maybe tomorrow!   I want to package them in lunch size containers to freeze, then take to work for lunches.THANKS!!!
***edit***:  My husband had a lot of dental work this week, and is having trouble chewing.  He specifically requested these, as they are SO TENDER they require little chewing, and yet the flavor & 'real food' feeling/taste is definitely there! We really love them!

this is the second time I've made these. This time using half organic beef and half bison. Also only made half of the recipe for the two of us. I really love that feature on this site, changing the servings. I made these in my Bella meatball maker, looks like one of those cake pop makers, from Macy's. I am not a good meatball cooker but in 12 minutes Bella makes 8 big juicy meatballs. Tonight they were for a meatball pizza, yummmy.

I made these meatballs for a family dinner. Since it's my first time making any type of meatballs, I followed the recipe exactly. They really were terrific, moist and flavorful. I did get a lot of comments on the size, so I probably over did it there. It would be good for the recipe to state the approx. size to make them.  Mine were about tennis ball size...I think too big, but made great conversation!

although these are the first home made meatballs i have ever cooked i already knew to use less water,i must suggest adding water very slowly and mixing with hands each time you add a little more to make sure they do not become to watery also there is no such thing as too much garlic otherwise these are sooooo yummy!!!!!!!!!!! enjoy!!!!!!

great recipe -- I don't use veal b/c its not available. 50/50 pork & beef works great. I made huge batch and frozen them. I did make them kinda small so I an use they for quick meat ball sub dinner. :)

This is how I make my meatballs too,but like another reviewer, I use milk.  I also grate an onion so it is pulp and disappears into the mixture w/o any texture but with a good taste. Don't overmix b/c that makes them tough. I also don't fry them, just put them in sauce and gently stir with a wooden spoon until they set.

I just found this recipe on here and compared it to my own that I have used for many years.  I NEVER add water to my recipe. The eggs in the mix keep the meatballs moist! Also I use seasoned breadcrumbs & add more italian seasoning to the mix as well as onion powder. BAKE in oven @ 425 for 10 minutes then lower temp to 325 and cook for 10 more minutes and transfer them to your sauce to finish cooking. It gives the sauce the most wonderful flavor!  Add pepperoni & braised brasciole for a real italian sauce.

I made this with ground turkey, and only had regular breadcrumbs available. I had to edit my previous review as I just realized had the proportions wrong last time. It actually had good flavor with twice the seasonings, but consistency was terrible with half the meat. ;-)

Now that I've got it right, this is definitely replacing my usual meatball recipe.

Good flavor, but needed the addition of 5-10 minutes under a stand-mixer to make the meatballs tender.

I made this yesterday with slight variations and it was easy as well as delicious. I used ground turkey and hot sausage, browned the meatballs and then put them in a slow cooker with my favorite marinara sauce. With the cooker on high it took about 3 hours to finish cooking. I toasted some sandwich rolls and voila...meatball subs! I made the recipe sans water and I'm very glad I did. The cheese mixed in the meat was suficient to keep the meatballs very soft.

I've tried many recipes over the years but this one stuck out above the rest. Simple ingredients with a nice flavor that does not over power whatever sauce you use. The water sounds like a strange addition but I think it really makes the difference from a tight meatball to a nice loosely (not falling apart) textured meatball. I used 1 lb beef and 1 lb ground pork. Making up a couple batches this weekend to put in my freezer.

Everyone is right....they're the best! I think its the large amount of cheese that really adds to the flavor. Plus adding the water keeps them from turning into hard golf balls. I've been using panko bread crumbs and it works just as good.

These are the best meatballs I've ever made!  In fact, amazing.  I used ground beef and ground pork in a 2:1 ratio but not the ground veal.  Also I used the Italian style bread crumbs and baked the meatballs as others have suggested.  They were light and flavorful.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

These were VERY GOOD!  In fact, the best homemade meatballs I've had.  I added a touch of oregano. Used 1lb pork, 1lb beef.  Based on reviews I used 3/4 c milk instead of 1 1/2 c water and baked for 40 mins at 350 rather than fry.  Perfect!

While I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe exactly as is, I also made a variation.  My men deer hunt and we usually have an abundance of venison.  I mixed ground venison and ground pork 50/50 and we couldn't even tell the difference!  I bake them instead of fry.  They are equally good with spaghetti, bbq sauce for great hoagies, or hot chili sauce as an appetizer!  Best meatball recipe I've found so far!!!!

Hands down the tastiest meatballs ever.  I slightly modified by using 1lb of beef and 1lb of pork, as I had no veal on hand.  I also baked at 350, instead of frying.

Very delicious and tender!  I used more garlic because we love garlic so much and I took fresh italian bread from the bakery and ground it up in my processor.  I also browned them stove top but finished them off in my homemade sauce.  It made the sauce delicious too!  Would definitly recommend trying this!  Thank you very much for this recipe!

Definetly a staple in my recipe box.  I didn't use all the water called for.  I went by texture and I didn't use fresh bread crumbs.  I baked these in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes (I made them quite large)until light brown and added them to the "Best Marinara Sauce" to continue cooking.

Wow! My husband and I loved these. It takes a little time to prepare these homemade meatballs, but it's so worth the effort. I am vegetarian so I substituted veggie breakfast patties. These are extremely salty already, so I didn't need to season the mixture at all. The addition of cheese takes the flavor up to Delicious. I used good-quality Parmesan and Romano, grated myself, and I recommend it as a splurge if you're cooking these for adults who will appreciate it - the cheap pre-grated stuff just cannot compare. Enjoy!

My husband, who is Italian and loves his mother's meatballs, raved about these. The first time I made them I fried them. The second time I cooked them in a crock pot. Placed the meatballs right into the sauce raw and 6 hours later (on a low setting) they were cooked to perfection. If you're pressed for time or just don't like to fry, this was an excellent alternative.

Very good, but I think I'd use finer bread crumbs next time for less meatloafy texture. Also, I think I'd bake them rather than fry them. Frying adds nothing to this recipe, except a tougher exterior and fat. Maybe mist them in olive oil and put under broiler a couple minutes, then turn down the oven to 325 until done.

These really are THE BEST MEATBALLS.  I consider myself a pretty good cook, but I could never make very good meatballs.  They always came out too tough.  This recipe was fantastic!!! Just what I was looking for.  Flavor and texture are simply wonderful.  I do only one substitution.  I substitute warm milk for the water.  RAVE REVIEW!  Thanks for sharing such a yummy recipe with us.

I couldn't rate this higher because ground veal and pork were not in my store in this small town.   I substituted ground turkey for the veal, since in Israel turkey is frequently substituted.  I purchased some cubed pork steaks, cut in small pieces and put them in my food processor for a few seconds to get ground pork.  Very good flavor in this recipe and the texture was great, different from all beef.  With my substitutions it was a 5

This recipe made for some FANTASTIC meatballs!  Deliciousioso!  I was a little hesitant to try this....I've been used to making meatballs the same way for ages.  I've always started by soaking bread in liquids and seasonings first then adding meat....baking them in the oven or frying them in a skillet (relying on the fat from the ground beef only.  I NEVER fried my meatballs in an inch of oil!  Frying them gave them a great and wonderful exterior and such a moist interior.  Make them!  Couldn't find veal today....so went without.

I have a similar receipe using all 3 meats (only 1/2 lb of beef), but use 5 cloves garlic and instead of water, add fresh parley and 1/2 an onion to 3/4 c chicken broth in a food processor - then mix with everything else. This was decent, but I prefer the flavor of the broth and onion (i tried it thinking i would barely be able to notice). But all in all - my changes are just a personal preference and this does deserve at least 4 stars.

I have made this recipe  three times now.  This has now became my standard recipe.  These are the best I have every made and I always get compliments!
I will say for those of you that have not used the beef AND pork AND veal, you are not making the same meatballs so reviewing this recipe is really useless.  The three meats are really a classic.  The pork gives you flavor and the veal adds tenderness.  I also use a cup of FRESH Romano cheese, its the cheese that I think sends the meat balls over the top with flavor.  I would suggest again to use the real cheese and make it fresh.   normally do not put all the water in at once as sometimes it does not take the full amount. 
Its always my goal to put some of these in the freezer however the left overs normally end up on a sandwich which is fabulous!

As a Jersey girl with millions of great meatballs all around....kudos to you for providing a great recipe here!  Simply put, there is no better combo of meat for meatballs.  It's sold in the grocery store as 'meatloaf mix' for the same price as lower fat ground beef- so it's not more expensive than what I would normally buy.  I skip the whole frying/baking process and put these meatballs right into my sauce.  I've used all combination of bread crumbs and cheese and find that all work well.  These are just good meatballs!  This was my biggest craving when I was pregnant and it still hasn't gone away yet even though my daughter is 2!  I make these all the time and even Miss Picky (the same baby) loves them!!  Don't bother with any other recipes!

With well over 700 reviews is seems a bit redundant to add another but these were so good I just have to. 
Like others I baked them in the oven. Started off at 350 but then bumped it up closer to 400. Next time I'll do it all at 375. Took 20 min for the larger balls and about 10 to 12 for the smaller. I placed the larger balls on a cookie rack over a sheet and the smaller ones on parchment lined rimmed sheets. By far the best way is the parchment paper. Super easy clean-up.
I have been looking for a long time for the perfect meatball recipe and this is it - I am so happy to finally have this wonderful recipe. Many many huge thanks to Geanine for submitting and thanks also to other reviewers for all their input and suggestions.

I've been making my meatballs EXACTLY this way for 35 years... this identical recipe is in an old spiral bound Betty  Crocker Cookbook my mom had.  Many,  many of my family and guests rave about these.  Teo thumbs up... Bammm!

These are the best meatballs ever.  I doubled the batch and froze half of the batch a couple weeks ago.  What is great about these, is you can make any type of sauce and it goes great (brown gravy, red gravy, or an alfredo cream sauce).  My family likes the brown gravy the best.

I consider myself to be a pretty good cook, but I could never make a meatball worth a darn...until this recipe. I made these last night, pretty much as written, adding some grated onion, using plain bread crumbs soaked in milk and only one egg and about 1/4 cup water. These held together beautifully! I browned them in just a little olive oil then let them cook completely in my marinara sauce. They were so tender that when we cut them with a fork, they fell apart. Absolutely the best I have ever made! Thanks so much for the recipe! The only one that I will use from now on

I made these meatballs and omg,they were amazing! I have never made meatballs and surfed the net to find a simple yet flavorful recipe and this was it. My only regret was not making more! I plan to prepare another batch for dinner tonight. The only change I made was using milk instead of water and they turned out fantastic! Thank you for sharing!

These were the best meatballs ever!!!!! I like Subways meatball sandwiches but the meatballs are so blande. No more Subway for me. I used large Hot Dog rolls and  smothered them in Pizza cheese. Perfect. The only thing I did different was to use Parmesan cheese instead of Ramono cheese

Great recipe!  But instead of water, I added 1 1/2 cups of good red wine then browned them in the oven (coating the baking sheet with olive oil and turned them all over to brown.  They taste great right from the oven (my daughter will only eat them this way) or add them to sauce cooking in a crock pot.  They just melt in your mouth!  Adding shredded mozzarella for a different twist is wonderful too!

Very good- a lot of variations are possible, of course; a personal favorite is shredded cooked potato in place of bread.  The secret here is the amount of oil for frying- you need enough to partially float the balls when they are first put in, or they will flatten  on the bottom.  Not a huge deal, but balls are balls.

THESE  MEATBALLS ARE DELICIOUS. BUT I HAVE BEEN MAKING THEM WITHOUT THE WATER. ADD COOKED LONG GRAIN RICE (2 cups UNCOOKED for every 2 lbs of meat). THE RICE WILL MAKE THEM SOFT AND MOIST. I ALSO COOK THEM IN THE OVEN BECAUSE I MAKE AT LEAT 5 LBS. OF MEATBALLS SO THAT I CAN FREEZE SOME FOR FUTURE MEALS.

By far, the best meatballs!  I'm a little lazy and replace the parsley and bread with seasoned panko crumbs and they're still phenomenal. For some reason, I never need to add liquid though. And more laziness, I bake them (350 for 15 min) instead of frying them.  No matter what you do, these meatballs come out perfect!  Big thank you to Geanine!  :)

These were fantastic!  I just broiled them and yum!  You can half broil some and freeze them, then to reheat them, thaw and finish the broiling process.

Delicious- add more garlic, more parsley, and 1/3 cup less olive oil.  You will have flavorful, light meatballs that aren't swimming in oil after they are baked.  This recipe also works with only turkey meat- good in escarole soup too.

This is my go-to meatball recipe with a few minor modifications.  I never have veal or pork on hand, so I usually do a 50/50 split between ground beef and sausage.  I’ve used both pork and poultry sausage with equally good results.  Also, instead of frying the meatballs in oil, I spray a broiling pan with non-stock cooking spray & cook them under the broiler until browned.  I cook them the rest of the way in a large pot of homemade sauce.  Delicious!

Excellant recipe. I did bake mine because I didn't want to stand in front of the skillit. Next time I will spend the time and fry to get a crisper texture.

I used 1lb of Italian sausage instead of the pork and veal, Contadina bread crumbs, and I baked the meatballs rather than frying them. They were tasty, but oily. I wish I'd had a rack to bake them on.

Awesome recipe!  I've been using ground lamb instead of veal, and a mixture of wine and tomato sauce instead of the water and oil.  Oh, and savory cracker crumbs instead of the bread.  These just rock.  Only problem is having enough for leftovers...

Great recipe!  I didn't have parsley, used chop'd arugula and 1/2 cup of milk.  I also didn't fry them but baked them in my mini cupcake pan, then to paper towels to drain.  I also add a few uncooked directly to my sauce to flavor it.  Yummy.  Don't forget to freeze a bunch after baking for a quick fab dinner or snack!

Thank you, Geanine, for a terrific recipe.
For cost effectiveness and fat control, I used half hot Italian sausage and half ground turkey. And a handful of crumbled bacon. Cut the water, use 1/4 C milk to soften the crumbs. Bake instead of fry, or for soft meatballs, plop into the sauce to cook. either way YUM. Thank you for this new favorite!

This recipe reminds me so much of my late grandfathers!  I've tried for years making them, but they never came out close...until I found this one!  I've made these several times and this last time decided to fry the meat up instead, using it for our lasagna!  WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL, WONDERFUL!  It took the lasagna to  new dimensions!  This recipe will definitely be sticking around!  THANK YOU!

good stuff.... depending on the quality of meat, you may not need as much water....  buy better meat and use the water as indicated.

This is a great recipe! I made if with just ground meat and used freshly shredded Gouda cheese because that's what I had on hand. I used meatballs to make meatball sandwiches and they were a hit! They were very moist! Thank you!

So delicious! We used 3/4 ground beef and 1/4 ground venison (and added a little bacon fat). 

We shaped the meat into 40 mini-meatballs the night before our dinner party. Partially baked the meatballs for about 15 minutes at 350. After we cooled them off, we popped the meatballs into Ziploc bags in the fridge overnight. Finished cooking them on the stove-top in a tomato-based sauce for 20 minutes right before serving them .

This was really good. I tweaked it to use what I had on hand so far as meat and bread crumbs. The whole family loved and we have left overs. I will make this again and again.

This recipe is the best meatballs. They are easy to make. I used only 3/4 cup of water adding it 1/4 cup at a time. The meatballs are best when you take the time to fry them in the olive oil. I also used any leftovers to make Italian meatball sandwiches which were a huge hit with my small grandkids.

I made these with just beef and used panko breadcrumbs rather than Italian ones.  Instead of frying the meatballs I baked them at 325 for 15 minutes.  They came out moist and delicious!  After many failed attempts at meatballs I think I have finally found a recipe that tastes simple but great!

Great Meatballs. I did as some said and baked them to render the fat, and used 80% lean Ground Beef as that was what I had. I added fine chopped Fresh Spinach and more Garlic. I used Whole Wheat Bread and soaked the Bread in 3 Tablespoons of Milk. Added the soaked bread into the mixture with Italian Herbs. Slowly simmered into the sauce with Hearty Red Wine and a 1/4 cup of Olive Oil. The result was a great rich sauce. With Garlic bread and a Green Leafy salad was excellent, and of course we had a very dry Shiraz Wine with the meal. Keeper recipe. Thanks!

Excellent!  Moist and flavorful...just as a good meatball should be!  I used parmesan reggiano because I had a huge wedge from Costco.  I baked the meatballs until almost done and then added them to my sauce to finish cooking.  There is really no need to look any further for the perfect meatball recipe.

This was a decent meatball recipe. The Romano cheese was a little too much for me, and if I make them again I will probably reduce the amount by half.

These were pretty good.  I didn't fry them, I baked them as others suggested.  After baking, I let them simmer in marinara for a few hours before serving.  Good, but not great.

As written, very good.  However, it is hard (for whatever reason) to get veal here anymore - a package of veal culets was $30 at my supermarket last week!  I bought some gound veal at my local meat market ($8 per lb.) and made these.  Unfortunately, didn't feel it was worth the extra time and expense.  Next time, I'm going to try them with 1/2 ground pork and a 80% ground beef to keep it moist and leave out the veal - unless the price comes WAY down.

Loved this recipe!  The meatballs had the right texture and they were a great addition to my homemade spaghetti sauce.  I made them into teaspoon sized balls and they browned up without falling apart.  This ones a keeper=)

Wow these were great! I forgot to add the 1.5 cups of water, but they still turned out delicious. We used 1 cup of Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and after forming the balls we put them raw into the marinara sauce (Best Marinara Sauce from All Recipes) and simmered them for 1 1/2 hours. Didnt make the sauce too greasy and tasted great! Also we used 1lb ground chuck & 1lb ground pork. Thanks!

Great recipe and the meatballs were delicious.  The fresh cheese and crumbled, stale Italian bread instead of canned breadcrumbs really does make a difference.  I had to make a few changes though as I couldn't find ground veal in any stores in my area, so I just used a half and half mixture of ground beef and pork. Nor could I find the flat Italian parsley, but I used regular parsley and it was fine.  I also added minced onion to my meat mixture.  Lastly, I didn't use all the water as called for.  I've also used this recipe for a crockpot meatloaf - mixing in seasoned tomato sauce into the meat mixture and then serving with a side of pasta and it was delicious as well. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I made these on Sat. night for a large family dinner that included several in-laws that are Italian.  These were a hit!  They were the best meatballs I've ever made.  The only substitution I made was milk for the water.  Fantastic!

This was a wonderful recipe but I didn't use the water at all because I found it moist enough without it and I used store bought organic bread crumbs instead.  The recipe made enough for company of eight and everyone really liked them.  Thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. My twist on it was instead of dry breadcrumbs and water, is to use a few slices of bread soaked with milk and then massaged into the meat mixture. you can always add a little more bread if you got it too wet. Lightly brown meatbalss to retain shape, then transfer them to your gravy/sauce for simmering until ready to eat.

I really liked the this recipe.  I did use italian chorizo in place of the veal.  I also used crackers in place of bread crumbs.  Turned out great and have made several times since the first.  Make sure not to use to much chorizo because of the flavor and the amount of oil in the chorizo.

We LOVE these meatballs!  I made them exactly as stated, only sustituting milk for the water.  Well worth effort - excellent with "Best Marinara Sauce Yet"!  Will be a family staple for years to come!

Not as great as my moms, but I'm a tough one to please. I added a couple tablespoons of minced onions. Next time I'll probably add a couple more and sauté with garlic before mixing it in. 
Browned and cooked on high in the crock pot for two hours with hot sausage and gravy.

I have a recipe very similar to this that was handed down to me from a good friend's grandmother.  My changes to this recipe were using ground sage sausage, minimal amount of bread crumbs (sometimes Panko), minced garlic and using no milk or water at all.  I also do not fry mine in oil.  I drop the meatballs in the homemade sauce and cook on stovetop or in acrockpot for 4 hours (on low setting). My family LOVES these meatballs!  I make these about once a month with sauce.

We made these in bulk and enjoying pulling 12 or so from the freezer to add to our spaghetti.  These are full of flavor - delicious!

I modified this only slightly. I left out the veal (couldn't find it in the store), added more garlic and added italian seasonoing, added mozzarella in place of the romano cheese, added only 1/4 cup of milk to the mixture, and baked them at 350 for 25 minutes. These were flavorful, moist, and hearty. I think this recipe makes the best meatballs I have ever had. I served them with marinara sauce. Excellent!

These are the first meatballs I've ever made and they turned out good. I read the reviews first and cut down on the water, which I'm glad I did (I used about half the recommended amount). I usually like to follow recipes to the letter but I didn't have stale Italian bread or Italian flat leaf parsley so I used Italian breadcrumbs and dried parsley. They still turned out good!
The only thing I'm going to do differently next time is give them some SPICE (there was no spice to them!)

I like this recipe.  I really did.  We cut this recipe in half (only because it is just my husband and I), so please note these changes are made for FOUR servings instead of eight.  I made a few changes.  We made it with all ground beef.  Instead of stale bread, we used one cup of italian bread crumbs.  We used 1/4 cup eggbeaters instead of the egg.  As for the water, out of the "1/2 cup at a time" I only put about 2 TB of water altogether.  It held up really, really well. I pan fried my meatballs with just about 2 TB of olive oil.  Not one of my meatballs tore apart!!!  I think it's all in how you roll up and ball up your meatballs if you ask me.  They tasted so great.  I used the pasta sauce from Wolfgang puck's website and used spaghetti rigati and it was FABULOUS (according to my husband).  Enjoy everyone!!!

I used all beef instead of the beef/veal/pork mix, because that's what I had.  I tripled the garlic and used parmesan cheese rather than romano.  Left out the parsley.  I doubled the eggs.  I whirled the bread in the food processor.  Don't you all love it when someone says a recipe tastes great, and then procedes to change everything about it?  

I ended up baking these, and they were just wonderful.  I made them for a car trip and we snacked on them the entire way.

Wow- these turned out very well despite a number of substitutions. I used what I had on hand, which was all beef, canned Parmesean/Romano blend, packaged plain breadcrumbs, and dried parsley, plus only 1 cup of water. I also used a non-stick skillet with just a brushing of olive oil. These meatballs weren't too difficult, and I'll probably interchange these with my usual meat-sauce. I also like that I can prepare a big batch once and freeze some for later (a half-batch made ~40 1.5 inch meatballs). Thanks, Geanine!

Delicious meatballs! Just realized I forgot to add the cheese, but I'll have it later with them. I used the ~1 lb meatloaf mix of beef/pork/veal and only 1 egg. Added just enough milk and bread crumbs for the mixture to come together and not be too moist or dry. I added a little onion powder and went extra on garlic powder. I baked them at 375 for 20-25 min and used parchment paper that really helped to absorb a lot of the grease. Great recipe Geanine!

This recipe is terrible. Too many bread crumbs and too much water. It was like tasting soggy bread! Whenever you have that much bread crumbs, it takes over the taste of the meat.

I don't have to try this recipe to know it has to be delicious, The same as amatuer photographer takes hundreds a photos hoping to capture the perfect light and exposure.A great One Knows what he is shooting and only needs a few shots, This recipe is authentic Italian, My fathers mother raise in Naples and my Mothers family from Sicily. The only concern is the water is not needed and can cause complications depending on water vs fat content and that depends on the butcher and what water you use.Maybe better to soak stale Italian bread in water and add to meat while very moist or dripping. The water cooks out anyway. The most important do not over mix. Over mixing causes the juices to come out in the fry pan.

I have to agree with Dee - I have been making these meatballs for 50 some years, as my mother and grandmother did.  We do not fry them, we drop them in the sauce about one hour before sauce is finished and wow, what flavor for both sauce and meatballs.  Also, I have started using milk with the bread crumbs, softening them first, then putting them into mix.Yummy!

I am definitely a meatball purist...using a recipe handed down from my nana.....I tried this meatball recipe on a whim, they were outstanding!  I wish my nana were alive today to taste these meatballs...they would make her proud.  Tip from nana "Never Fry your meatballs, cook them for 20 minutes in the oven and then finish them in the sauce"

Very good Italian meatball recipe.  I used a little bit of cayenne which is my preferred seasoning & 1 cup of water which was more than enough.  I also baked them at 350 for 30 minutes.  Next time I will mix in a package of spinach.  Easy prep & will definitely make again.

These were great! I used 1/2 beef and 1/2 pork and baked in the oven. I will keep this recipe on hand from now on.
11/8/16
I am still using this recipe after 3 years and I used ground white cheddar Cheez Its in place of the bread crumbs for an extra twist.
Bake at 350 for 45 min. These also freeze well.

I live on an island so it was near impossible to find veal, if you can't find it either don't worry!  With meatballs its more like a suggestion.  I use sausage, ground beef, and ground pork and it tastes great.  I make a big batch for my family of 6 and freeze half to use later!  We love it!

I made a meatball buffet for my Hallowen party and this is one of the recipes. What a hit they were and the first to go! I didn't have any veal so subsituted more hamburger. Delicious! I used about 1/2 cup less water than it called for. Will make these from now on Loved them!

I add 2 more garlic cloves and a medium onion -chopped. Instead of the water, I  add some of the tomato puree (which I use to make the gravy) to the meat ball mix. I think frying sears the meatball so when you simmer it in the sauce it's tender and juicy and not hard/dry.

All I can say is, Oh my goodness these are good!!! I made them for a get-together and there were no leftovers, but people were asking if there were any more! One side note: I used ground turkey in place of veal because my grocery store didn't have any and the meat manager said in his opinion it was tasteless and expensive (I'm assuming if it really is tasteless it may be in the recipe to add texture?). But it came out really well! Thank you!

Great meatballs!  I used all beef because that was all I had.  I also used Italian seasoning instead of the flat leaf parsley...again, all I had on hand.  Didn't have stale Italian bread so I used seasoned Panko crumbs - Use only 1 1/2 C instead of 2 C (per another reviewer) and cut down on the water to about half.  I did not fry it in oil.  Baked it for 30 mins on 350 degrees on a cookie sheet sprayed with Pam.  Kids ate them up!

I usually make a double batch of these and freeze them before they are cooked.  They freeze beautifully and taste just as good.  They also make excellent leftovers.  These are my absolute favorite meatballs.  You will never order them in a restaurant again!

The meatballs this recipe produces are excellent!! I much prefer Italian sausage and meat sauce with my spaghetti, but when it came to these meatballs, I wanted to eat them all myself! I doubled the recipe, but it just wasn't enough. I should have tripled it. Thanks Geanine!

These are very good...they are better after sitting in homemade sauce for a day or two.

These also freeze very well.

THESE ARE THE MOST TENDER MEATBALLS EVER.  FRIED IN BATCHES (NO OIL), JUST SPRAYED MY PAN WITH COOKING SPRAY.  AFTER REMOVING MEATBALLS, ADDED ONIONS, PEPPERS AND GARLIC TO PAN AND SAUTEED TILL TENDER BEFORE ADDING MEATBALLS BACK.  YOU CAN ALSO ADD A JAR OF MARINARA SAUCE.  COOK ABOUT A 1/2 HOUR LONGER.  DELICIOUS!!!

I made meatballs tonight for the first time and they were DELICIOUS!  Thank you so much for the recipe. :)  I used the ground beef and mixed it with Johnsonville HOT ground sausage...tasty!! Instead of parsley, I used Italian seasoning, Panko for the bread crumbs (1 1/2 c.), added a cup of minced onions, and only 1 c. of water.  My family LOVED them.

This is a very good recipe.  Something I do slightly different that will make the meatballs less heavy is  instead of bread crumbs use a small stale roll and soak it in water, drain and squeeze the excess water, then add the soft bread to the mixture.

To make this GLUTEN FREE, add cornflakes crumbs instead of bread crumbs, make measure 1, 1/2 to 2 cups (add until meatbal is sort of stiff), and you can use milk or water.

I just made these and they are fantastic!   Extremely easy to prepare.  My grocery store did not have ground veal so I doubled my ground pork.   I followed the advice of numerous reviewers and used milk instead of water and then baked them in the oven.   I couldn't believe how tasty these were!  I'll be making these over and over again.  Thank you!

I used beef, ground turkey and pork. (the grocery store was out of veal) If you use turkey you don't need as much water. It was really yummy, I added diced onion and baked like the other reviews suggested. Spray the foil if you do this as well or they meatballs stick. Happy eating!

Best meatballs I've ever made! The meat mixture is a little wet and sticky, but that's ok. They turn out great! The meat mixture creates a flavorful and not-too-dense meatball. Very nice with spaghetti and homemade marinara sauce!

These were very good.  I did as other reviewers suggested and baked them on a cake rack over a cookie sheet at 350 for 40 minutes.  I used meatloaf mix for the meat(2.5 lbs), packaged bread crumbs, about 1 1/4 cups of water, and added a little bit of italian seasoning.  My picky husband's only complaint was they needed more salt and seasoning.  May use Kraft parmesan cheese next time to add some extra salt.

Delicious meatballs! The texture was perfect! I wound up needing only about a cup of water. Browned them on the stove and then cooked them some more in a red sauce in the slow cooker to finish em up. Fabulous go to recipe for meatballs! yay!

I've made this recipe twice and they have turned out fantastic both times.  I followed the recipe except I did use prepared bread crumbs. Also, like a few others, I baked them at 400 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes rather than fry them.  I'm sure they are great either way.  Both my husband and I agree this recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing.

WOW!!!  these were wonderful.  My wife is a very pickey eater and I wanted meatballs for spagehtti. I was looking for a simple recipe and I found this one.  I used all beef and instead of parsley I used oregano.  Like someone else suggested I baked them on a rack in a pan lined with foil for approx 45min @350.  I am already planing on making then again, can't wait to put some sause to them...

Very good recipe. It is almost identical to Rao's, a NYC restaurant's recipe. The only difference is that Rao adds more cheese  & 1 cup of breadcrumbs instead of stale bread.

This was really good. I used only ground pork though since I didnt have all the other on hand and I added Garlic Salt to the mixture. I also baked it for 30 mins and then broil it on high to make it extra crispy making sure to flip sides.

Meatballs seem a bit "fiddly" but this recipe makes it easy. The only changes I made were to use only ground pork, and I halved the recipe because it's just the two of us.

It's the kind of food that while you're making it, you're saying to yourself "This looks so good!"

I added less water but maybe next time I won't add any at all, especially if I'm using stale bread.

Mine didnt hold shape in the fry pan, but definitely were tasty, just not attractive ball shaped.

This is a great recipe! The best meatballs I have ever made. I did some alterations like everyone else: I just used 2 pounds of hamburger meat, used half a bag of stuffing instead of stale bread, 10 huge garlic cloves, and it turned out amazing! The extra garlic is what did it for me.

These are the best meatballs I have ever had. A little time cosuming to make but well worth the time. My family gets disappointed if I make spagetti without the meatballs. These are also great for meatball subs. They freeze well cause you will want to make extra for later use.

These are Soooo great!  I don't even use the mix of different meats, mostly because I don't have them in the house.  They turn out "company good" every time!  Don't hesitate...become a meatball hero today!

This is very close to my recipe also. I use about 2 lbs of good ground beef and just under 1 lb. of Johnsonville mild Italian sausage. I add 1 Tbsp of Oregano, 1 Tbsp of Parsley and 1 Tbsp of Sweet Basil. I also cut off about 2/3 of a 2 foot French Bread Loaf and run it thru the food processor to make very coarse fresh bread crumbs.  Plus a good amount of salt and pepper, garlic, and grated Parmesan cheese and 1 or 2 eggs. Thoroughly mix all ingredients and add the warm water in 3 doses while mixing by hand. I usually get about 1 1/2 cups in. Final mixture should be very soft. The warm water helps to make it sticky so when you're rolling the meatballs around in your hands they stay together very well. Bake or Fry in oil until brown, drain, add to your favorite sauce and cook for another 30 minutes.

This was my first attempt at making traditional meatballs and was extremely pleased with the result. Italian-style meatballs always intimidated me, but this recipe is a sure-fire success. Very simple ingredients and easy 1-2-3 directions. Loaded with flavor and very quick, weekday meal for family. I did not have fresh parsley or fresh breadcrumbs. Substituted with dry parsley (about a 1/4 cup) and Italian breadcrumbs (about a 1/2 cup) for 1.5 pounds of meat. Super moist!

These are very authentic.  I do substitute spaghetti sauce for the water and roll the  raw meatballs in grated cheese before baking them in my oven, just like my grandma and mom used to do.  Use an ice cream scoop to get uniform sized balls and be sure to bake them on a non-stick foil lined pan for easy clean up.  These are Tender and Delicious and freeze very well, so go ahead and double the recipe.

This is a wonderful recipe. I personally make a double batch at once freeze half (raw), cook half (raw) with Italian sausage (raw) in my sauce all day! The meat  flavors the sauce (I add not a single seasoning to the sauce itself). 
I did make two /sometimes three (depending on our mood) small changes to the meat mixture. 
1. I use only ground beef
2. I add Natures Seasoning to the spices ( it is AMAZING on just about anything)
3. *SOMETIMES* red pepper flakes

This recipe is a great place to start for basic ingredients that will produce a moist meatball that holds its shape. BUT, they're a bit bland for my taste. 

I use this recipe as my "beginning" and add oregano, basil, and a bit of chili powder. I just "eyeball" it and each time has come out just fine. I add salt and pepper and then taste one after its done cooking. If they need more, I sprinkle a bit additional at that point.

I've been cooking these in the oven as some other reviewers suggested and then place them in the sauce to finish cooking. It imparts a nice flavor to the sauce without the addition of the grease from the meat.

ALSO - one of the most critical components of this meatball is the fresh parsley. The parsley adds a wonderfully fresh flavor. Don't substitute with dried, it won't be the same.

These were fantastic.  The only change I made was I baked the meatballs instead of frying them in the olive oil.  This is my third time making them.  Once they come out of the oven, I drop them in my sauce.  Everyone LOVES them.  Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe!  The meatballs turned out the way a meatball should.  A nice crust on the outside yet moist and tender on the inside.  I can say that this is one of the best recipes that I have made.  I would have rated it a 5 star recipe, but I had to sub all beef for the veal and pork and I didn't have time to run to the store for fresh Romano (subbed grated parm instead).  Thank you for sharing!

Used half beef and half pork, along with Italian style breadcrumbs. Baked them before putting them into homemade spaghetti sauce for meatball hoagies. Delicious!

Really good...a must have with spaghetti!
I did make a few changes mainly because I didn't have all of the ingredients but it came out great.  I used only ground beef but used a lb. and I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano.  Also instead of cooking them on the stove I placed them over crinkled foil in a casserole dish in the oven on 350 degrees for 30min and then browned them on the stove in about 2tsps of olive oil.  
If you just bake them till they are done they freeze very well and you only have to brown as many as you need and save the rest for next time.

WOW!!  I have been trying for YEARS to make great meatballs and FINALLY I have found the right recipe! Another reviewer mentioned they were skeptical of adding water and I was as well.  But I'm not skeptical anymore!  I ususally add onions to my meatballs and was very tempted to add them to this recipe but I didn't and I'm glad I didn't.  The only thing I did different was I used canned Italian flavored bread crumbs and it didn't seem to make a difference.  These meatballs were just absolutly YUMMY!!!

This is the meatball recipe I have been searching for!  I used 1/2 beef 1/2 pork and used 1 cup of milk instead of water.  I will cut back even further on the amount of liquid next time as the meatballs were pretty soft and it was hard to keep the shape as I was frying them.  I fried them only slightly before adding them to the sauce to continue cooking.  This was the first time I have ever used fresh breadcrumbs to make meatballs, so that may be why they were so good.  I used italian bread and put it in mu food processor to make crumbs.

Really yummy!  Has the soft texture I have been searching for!  The only change I made was to use Pecorino Romano instead of Parmesan cheese.  They came out perfectly seasoned and moist.  Made a double batch and froze the half.  Will make again!!

I made these again last night (doubling the recipe to have more on hand) but did tweak it some and found them fantastic!  First I used 2lb's lean ground beef, 1lb. lean ground turkey and 1 lb. ground pork.  I also used only 1 & 1/2 cup liquid (red wine in lieu of water) instead of doubling it and found it to be just enough for the doubled recipe.  I added a few more garlic cloves and 2 med. sized minced onion and used 1 C grated asiogo and 1C Kraft parmesan & about 1 T of red pepper flakes.  I found baking them at 325 for 20 min to be an easy way to keep them lower in fat (turning about every 5 min or so) and they came out very nice & moist and MUCH lower in fat than frying.  My husband and I  LOVED them!  I have tons more on hand that I froze and will be enjoying these again & again!

Although this was my first time making meatballs, I have tried many meatballs from different places and people. These ones are by far the BEST meatballs ever (including my mum's)!!! Me and my husband enjoyed making them together (he likes to mix them) and were very impressed and pleased! Great recipe! Thanks!! :)

Fantastic Meatballs!
I halved the recipe. Used just 80/20 ground beef and baked them in the oven instead of frying them.

I must have tried HUNDREDS of meatball recipes to get something more uniform than what I usually do, which is just throwing things together till it looks right.
Thanks Geanine!

These meatballs were moist and tasty.  I did, however, change a one thing:  Instead of putting the garlic in the meatball mixture, I put it in the oil as I fried the them - as found within another review.  I think next time, I'll add it to the mixture instead since I think mine were lacking the garlic taste.  I would also use less breadcrumbs and add more romano cheese.  Next time with these modifications, I think they will be delicious!

I love meatballs and have attempted them a few times with no success.  Finally, with this recipe, I actually made meatballs that I liked.  Thank you!

Seriously the best meatball I've ever had. Incredibly tender and wonderful seasoning. I used ground sirloin and mild ground pork sausage. I also subbed Italian bread for Italian breadcrumbs. Absolutely perfect- will definitely make again!

This meatballs are awesome! I use milk instead of water which makes them more tender..I also use just ground beef. After browning I keep them warm in a crock pot with sauce for a couple hours. Great to bring to a pot luck or football game.

Wow, these were great and easy.  I made two batches for a Christmas Party.  I actually baked them on a rack over a cookie sheet.  I followed the recipe except I omitted the olive oil (since I baked them) and used warm milk instead of water - only about 1/2 cup though.  The texture was light not dense and that made for a great taste.   I served the cooked meatballs in a crockpot with a sauce of 2 jars Chili Sauce and 2 cans cranberry sauce and everyone raved.   I also made it a second time and froze the left overs for spaghetti sauce - my family liked them so much they told me just to serve them hot with nothing else.  Great recipe.

I was skeptical of using water in meatballs, but it gave it a nice consistency, and they cooked up great.  My son said they were the best meatballs ever! I only had beef on hand, but next time I will try with pork. 
UPDATE 7/7/11 - I didn't have time to cook into meatballs, so I put the meat mixture into loaf pans and baked it like a meatloaf.  I thought it was delicious.  We had it as meatloaf for dinner one night, then I used the leftovers to make a red sauce with meat for pasta.  Very tasty!

Very nice recipe for great meatballs... and given I had an "authentic Italian grandma" setting the stage for what a meatball should be, this is quite an endorsement.  I went a little crazy with the water (I think ideally one should pull back to between 1 and 1 and 1/4 cups) so the meatballs were a smidge less firm than what is ideal, but it only impacted final shape, not flavor.  I baked mine on a wire rack at 350 for about a half and then added them to my sauce.  DELICIOUS!!

Great recipe!  I've made these probably about 5 or 6 times over the past few months.  I took the advice of many reviewers and now have the perfect recipe for my family's liking:  sautee 1/2 finely chopped onion with the garlic cloves and let cool before adding to meat ball mixture; sometimes I use 1.5 lbs ground beef w/ 1/2 lb pork (the veal can give the meatballs a gamey flavor); sometimes I add a little fresh basil; and I bake for about 15 minutes in the oven.  I pop them in the freezer for a great insta-meal for my 14 month old twins, or I heat up in sauce for the adults.  Delish!

These meatballs hardly even tasted like meat to be honest.  The texture was all wrong.  Way too much filler (3 cups between the cheese and bread crumbs!)

LOVED this recipe.  Followed another reviewer's advice and used 1/4 cup of milk rather than the water, and only a little olive oil.  Already thinking about the leftovers for tomorrow.

These were just like restaurant meatballs and much lighter made with pork.  Didn't use veal, couldn't find it plus it is expensive.  Used milk instead of water and bread crumbs instead of bread since that is how I always made them.  Baked and not fried.  Simmered 1 hour in sauce.

My children loved these meatballs. Sometimes I only have hamburger so I just cut the other ingredients in half. I never had to use the water. Like other reviews i bake mine on a cooling wrack over a foil lined cookie sheet.

These meatballs are delicious but I have to be honest...I had to tweak the recipe because I didn't have all the ingredients... I replaced the Romano Cheese with some Parmesan (store bought) and the Italian bread with Wonderbread Light Wheat bread. And the meat I used was a pre-mix of Beef/Veal/Pork for meatballs and meatloaf... "Catelli Italian Bistro Meatball/Meatloaf mix)...it was about 1.3 lbs of meat... and saved me the trouble ;)  I also used a little less water. Possibly about 3/4 of a cup to 1 cup... I put all the ingredients except the meat and eggs in my chopper so that the cheese parsley and garlic would mix well... I beat 2 eggs and added the eggs and cheese/garlic/parsley to the meat (which was lightly seasoned adobo) and mixed everything by hand.  I took the chopper and used 2 1/2 almost 3 slices of wonder wheat bread and made my own bread crumbs.  I threw that in and kept mixing everything added some salt and pepper... I took a cup of water and added slowly like the directions said but never finished the whole cup.  I also took about 1/2 cup of olive oil and threw that in on top at the end so that it would get sticky and keep the balls together.  I baked at 400 degrees for 22 minutes (or so)... and came out with 24 meatballs about golf size... threw some in my spahetti sauce and my 6 year old ate 4 alone (she doesn't like "red" spaghetti sauce)... Simply delicious... I would say 4.5 stars cause you don't really need that much water!! Still great anyway!!!

I wanted \to do 4 and a half stars but it won't let me! Okay, disclaimer: I did not use the ground pork, which I think would have made these 5 stars, but my husband hates the stuff. HOWEVER, these were nice, easy to make, lovely texture even without the pork, and very flavorful. I baked mine in the oven, took about 30 minutes at 325F. Will definitely make these again, maybe try ground lamb in place of the pork.

It's pretty good, but I don't know how much "salt and pepper to taste" meant.  I guess I didn't put enough because the meatballs were a little bland.  I halved the recipe and maybe I didn't have enough meat, because I didn't weight them... but the final product tasted like bread crumbs.  Maybe I need to make some adjustments for next time.  Easy to make though, hence the 4 stars. :)

These are pretty good meatballs but nothing really stands out to make them a 5 star in my opinion.  I made them as the recipe calls for and then with only ground beef and I thought it was much better when only ground beef, I felt the 3 meats ended up making it sort of bland-tasting. Much stronger flavor when only ground beef is used.

The only suggestion I can make to this is add 2 dashes Worchester and 1 cup of bread crumbs instead of 2.  Add Water and milk to the consistency you like, a tad mushy but still able to hold shape.  If you use to much bread crumbs it masks the flavor of the meat.  I have tried this recipe to a "T" and those are the only tweaks I would make.

I have tried several recipes for meatballs, but  this was the first one to impress my family.  I skipped the veal, used  1 cup of canned bread crumbs, and 1 cup of warm water.  I did as another in the reviews suggested with baking at 350 for 45 minutes.  They were superb.

I omit the veal and only use beef and pork but this is a great recipe.  Instead of frying I bake them in the oven and my husband loves it.  I always keep some in the freezer for quick dinners.

I never thought that it would be possible to make good meatballs without pan-frying before baking.  I was wrong.  These meatballs are simple and delicious!

I enjoyed these meatballs! I ended up using a one pound roll of Bob Evans Italian Sausage instead of the pork and veal since that is what I had and it was great. I stirred this with my mixer thoroughly to get a nice, smooth texture as well. I just placed most of them in the freezer on a cookie sheet covered in freezer paper, will transfer them to a freezer bag when they are mostly frozen for storage and so they will be quick to thaw and add as needed for quick tasty additions for spaghetti in the future.

Made these meatballs last night and because we love spaghetti and meatballs, I made a double batch. I had company over for dinner last night (not spaghetti and meatballs) and I still had them on the counter cooling. Each one of them had a meatball and said they were delicious. Coming from an Italian community where most of the restaurants are Italian, I would have to say they are "The Best Meatballs" or darn close to it that we have had. Thanks for the recipe.

These are excellent and made me think of Sunday dinner at Nanni's house! One caveat ... start with just 1/4 tsp of salt. Add more if needed, but the Romano cheese is very salty so go easy. Excellent recipe and very easy. Thanks, Geanine!

Just finished making these for dinner.I had to test one! & they are great! I did use (ground white meat only) turkey.Subed out the water for low soduim beef broth & egg beaters for the egg.Used Italain seasoned bread crumb's,& added 1/4 cup dried minced onion.Used the beef broth to try and mask the turkey flavor and it worked out great! If i did not know it was ground turkey i would not have guessed it was tasted like beef!All in all a great simple recipe.With my changes i got the calories down to 335 per serving,Cholesterol 11.46! Which was what i was aiming for a healthier meatball with great taste! Thanks i will be making this again :)

I don´t know what to say about this recipe. I was really excited about it when I read all the great reviews, but was skeptical about the recipe. I tried it anyway, with no adjustments at all. It wasn´t bad, but it wasn´t great. When I make meatballs, there are usually none leftover. This time my family ate about half and didn´t ask for leftovers the next day. I guess this is a good recipe for someone who has never made meatballs before and would like a good base. I´m gonna stick with my original meatball recipe for now.

Made 1/2 recipe,using all beef. Gave DH a "taster" with sauce and he said, "OH, YEAH!" Later when it was all done and served with spaghetti, I asked if these were THE BEST MEATBALLS (I haven't eaten yet). He sincerely assured me that they are.  Adding to my recipe box now.  Oh, did bake in the oven.

These meatballs were really yummy. I used 1 pound chuck and a 1-pound package meatloaf mix.  I also used 1 cup italian bread and 1/2 cup seasoned breadcrumbs - cut down the water to probably 3/4 cup. I spread some olive oil on the cookie sheet and baked them high up in the oven then lowered them for last 5 mins. I made about 24 meatballs - 4 kids and husband ate all but 6  - will make a double next time!

I would give these 4 stars the way I made them, which was one pound each of ground beef and italian sausage...which had far too much of a sausage flavor in them to be true meatballs.  Next time I will use 1.5 pounds beef and 1/4 pound sausage - and I'm sure they'd be spot on!  I added these to my own homemade marinara sauce (with my home canned tomatoes), and it was the best sauce I've ever made!  Thanks for the recipe!

Moist and delicious, full of flavor.  I used half pork and half beef when I made them and they turned out great.  Instead of marinara sauce, I made a brown gravy from the drippings.  Excellent!  Will make again!

Followed the original instructions exactly except that I made a triple batch so didn't fry them - put them in a deep baking dish and baked them.  They turned out delicious!  Yum Yum!

These were really good! I didnt have romano cheese so i had to use parmesan but other than that followed the recipe. Oh-i added alot more fresh parsley than recipe called for to. I baked half the batch and browned the rest on the stove. I prefered the baked ones. No difference in taste just alot healthier and easier.

These are great, I've made them twice now.  Of course, I adjusted it a bit to my tastes but I still think the original recipe deserves 5 stars.  But that aside, here are my changes:  I only use beef (we don't eat pork), I cut the recipe in 1/2, I doubled the garlic, I used the Parmesan Blend cheese from Walmart and I didn't measure it so I'm sure I used too much, and I used fresh bread crumbs and left out the water since the bread wasn't dry.  I also don't bother adding any oil to fry them, just a quick spray of Pam to keep them from sticking.  Oh and I also added a couple of teaspoons of italian seasoning.  Man when you write it all down it doesn't sound like I followed the recipe at all LOL.  But they are delicous!  My husband loved them too and he is P I C K Y.

These meatballs were delicious. The combinatin of the different meats was great and they were very moist. This is the only meatball recipe I will ever use again. I baked mine on a cookie sheet in the oven to avoid the extra oil and they turned out perfect.

I didn't really care for this recipe, I think if I did try it again, I would only use ground beef and probably less parmesan cheese.  The amount of parmesan was a little overwhelming.  I like "Jenn's Out of this world Spaghetti and Meatballs" recipe better.

Very very good. I used Parmesan instead of Romano & all beef because that's what I had on hand. Added minced onion & Italian seasoning. Instead of frying I simmered the meatballs in the crockpot with homemade tomato sauce. Thanks.

These are the best meatballs and I make them with all beef just b/c I never have the veal and pork handy when deciding to make meatballs for dinner.  I also have a homemade sauce I make so after browning the balls I throw them in the sauce to heat through - then serve over pasta and garlic bread, yummy!

These meatball were fantastic.  I used store bought bread crumbs.  The meatballs were moist and delicisious.  I would up the amount of garlic.  I would use 4 cloves of garlic.  I have always wanted a good recipe for meatballs.  I usually make them with just ground beef.  I have had a problem with them being too hard.  These meatballs were moist and tender and just perfect.  My daughter had a problem with the ground veal being in them, but I think that is what made them so good.

These turned out great, my whole family loved them! I had to use italian bread crumbs because that's all I had and I used a beef/pork combination. I also fried the meatballs in only about 1/4 cup of olive oil instead of 1 cup. This recipe is a keeper!!

I have been looking for a great recipe for meatballs as my husband is not a fan of mine. These were very good and my husband says it was a big improvement. I used ground veal and beef only. Next time I will try with veal, pork and beef. Good. Thanks.

These are wonderful!  I used just beef, but I think these would be outstanding with the mix of meats.  I just used kraft parmesan and dried herbs because I was unable to get to the store.  Even so, these are wonderful meatballs!  I made them large (used 1/4 cup each), browned them per the recipe and place dthem in a crockpot of spaghetti sauce.  They were wonderful to make ahead for a party and were a big hit.  Everyone loved them!

These were awesome!  I only used ground beef *inadvertently*... put a couple slices of wheat bread in the blender to make crumbs, added italian seasoning and it was  very delicious!  Served it with Safeway brand marinara sauce (Really good from a jar sauce) and spaghetti noodles.  Made 26 meatballs.  Can't wait to make again!

I have been making these meatballs for a few years now and cannot begin to tell you how GOOD they are. I get compliments on them every time I serve them and even have a contractor who insists I call him whenever I make them so he can come over and have a few.

I usually subsitute ground turkey breast for the veal, just to lighten them up a bit, and I bake mine in the oven at 350 for 20 minutes, but other than that, I make them as is.

I cannot recommend these enough. YUM!

Great!!!! - - - I used 1 pound ground bison and 1 pound ground veal.  I only used 2 tablespoons cheese and increased the eggs to 3.  I fried in a combo of oil and butter.  Then when I was done with the meatballs - I added salt and spices to the leftover oil (and bits!) and fried some onions in it.  Took those out, strained them - then put the meatballs, onions, and my homemade sauce in the slow cooker for awhile.  Yummmmmm!

Very good recipe.  I used 3/4 cup Italian bread crumbs because I was short of time.  I also cooked for 25 minutes at 350 instead of frying them; flipped them half way.  Came out great & made them for dad on Father's Day. Very pleased!

We enjoyed these last night for dinner.  I had hamburger thawed and wasn't sure what to do with it so I thought I'd give these a try.  They were wonderfully moist and had great flavor.  Personally I hate when people rate recipes and don't follow the recipe exactly because you can't give a fair review, but the only changes I made were I did not add the veal (family won't eat it) and I only added half of the pork - like I said, I didn't know what I was making for dinner.  I will be making these again and next time add all of the pork and  maybe sneak some veal in as well!  Thanks for sharing!

I used all beef and cut the recipe in half. I also used crackers instead of bread and added more garlic and no oil but made them in  a tomato sauce. Very good for a basic recipe. Will make again.

The best meatballs.  When I originally made this recipe I read it wrong and added the olive oil to the meat mixture.  That is how I make the meatballs now because it is very flavorful.  I add a dash of olive oil and then add the water in small batches until the meat is the right consistency (probably about 3/4 cup of water).  I let the meatballs simmer in my sauce since I like them better that way instead of fried.

These ARE the best meatballs I have ever made, though I did change the recipe a bit.  I used all beef, and added grated mozzarella instead of romano.  Plus, I omitted the olive oil and baked them.  The BEST!

These are the first meatballs I have ever made. They where really easy. I listened to everyone else and used a little less water. Talk about a hit. They where gone before anything else.

These were really good!  Nice texture and good flavor.  Like other people, I used less water and less oil.  I followed Geanine's advice and left the lid on the pan while cooking the meatballs - otherwise a few of them started to fall apart.  I'll make these again for sure.  Thanks!

This meatball recipe is the closest I have seen to my moms,  and hers are the best.  She usually uses more veal and pork and less beef.  If you simmer the meatballs in the sauce for a couple of hours,  they become soft and delicious.

OH MY GOODNESS!!!  These are, hands down, the best meatballs ever made.  I did not have any veal, so I used 1/2 ground beef and 1/2 spicy Italian sausage and then followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  I will be serving these meatballs to guests.  They are out of this world.

Very tasty meatballs!  I didn't have all the ingredients so I had to use Italian seasoned bread crumbs and 85% lean beef chop meat.  Nonetheless, the taste was fantastic!  I made a 3lb batch and only used 1/4 a cup of olive oil and it was more than enough!  Can't wait to serve them during a trip this weekend! Delish!

This recipe is so easy and freezes well. I make up a big batch and set up several containers for future meals. Although I've switched the veal and pork with ground turkey. I get gets raves everytime.

i don't know that i'd call them the "best" but they were pretty darn good.  my 11 year old son is learning to cook and this is the recipe we used, so directions were easy enough to follow.  i would definitely recommend.

I love this recipe so much that I make six times the recipe each rime so I can freeze them. I never bother with the fresh parsley or fresh bread crumbs and they still turn out amazing. Today I used sweet sausage and hot sausage in the mix and they were epic! Everyone raves about these balls. They are THE BEST .... for real!

I would definitely make this again and it takes great with or without red sauce.  The changes I made were only because of what I had on hand - I did not have fresh bread crumbs, unfortunately, so used Progresso Italian breadcrumbs but only 1 cup.  Used 1/4 cup milk instead of water because I thought it might add a bit more depth of flavor,  used 1 pound of veal instead of 1/2 and then baked instead of fried since I don't need any more oils even if they are "good" oils. 
 On the baking sheets - I used two - I put several tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil on the sheets and nothing on the other sheet.  The sheet with the olive oil was on the bottom of the oven and browned considerably more than the one at the top of the oven but they both tasted exactly the same.   I baked for 30 minutes at 400F because I had to go somewhere and didn't want to leave the oven on and they were perfectly cooked but not pink - more medium. If you want them to be medium rare I suggest you taste them after 20 minutes or cook for 30 at 350 instead of 400F.  Especially if you will be cooking them in tomato sauce after the oven.

Excellent recipe! I used milk instead of water and added a healthy splash of olive oil and I think it helped the meatballs stay moist. I also baked mine in the oven at 350 F for 25 minutes before throwing them in a cast iron pot of sauce. Yummy!!!

I didn't care for this recipe. I admit I only used beef and pork because I don't eat veal. I think all beef would have been better. I did not like the pork flavor and they also had too much bread crumbs. This recipe makes a LOT of meat balls. It was too much. One pound of beef would be plenty for a family of 4.

Yummy! Will definitely be making these again.  Accidentally bought cilantro instead of parsley  (yea I know not an easy mistake to make  but it happened none the less) so I thought hey let's try it and it was yummy. I made them again later in the week with fresh basil instead of the parsley and it was also yummy.  Both times I baked them at 400 degrees for between 15 and 20 minutes depending on the size I made them.

I reworked the recipe to yield more to lower fat due to health issues. 

Approx. 1 pound of the leanest ground beef
Approx. 1/4 cup of Romano Cheese
2 eggs
Approx. 1 cup Italian bread crumbs
2 cloves of garlic cut up finely
Approx. 1/2 cup of onions cut in small, fine pieces

Mix together in large bowl. Roll into balls and put on a cookie sheet with tin foil on bottom.  Bake in oven at 350° for 35 minutes or depending on how big you bake your meatballs. Add to sauce.

I followed the recipe exactly and got a delicious moist, meaty meatball bursting with flavor.  The chopped parsley I found to be the most interesting ingredient, as I would never have thought of using it, yet it added herbaceousness (as they say on the cooking shows, ha ha). 

Of course I've made it again, trying little varieations and will continue to do so, but so far the original has turned out the best.  

Tonight I'm making some with beef, veal, pork and lamb, adding a little sage, some onion flake and crushed red pepper. Mmm, spicey meatballs.  I'll let you know

Loved it!  Will make again.  Made some tweaks; don't hate.     1 lb. of Italian sausage and 1 lb. ground beef.  FOUR cloves garlic, and milk instead of water. I think grating the fresh cheese is imperative.  I cooked in the oven at 325 for 20 mins then transferred into sauce in the crockpot for the day (on low).  Everyone LOVED these! Small family, so froze a bunch which are being consumed as I write this. Great recipe!

I think that the recipe needs more garlic. I always add  Parmesian or Romano in the meat to add saltiness.

Absolutely PERFECT!!!  Followed recipe exactly!!  We had an Italian theme Christmas dinner!!  100% agreement to do it again next year!!!  Can prepare a day ahead, placing meatballs in the sauce. Before dinner, bring out & simmer.  The more done earlier...the more enjoyable is Christmas day for the main cook!!!!

This is the recipe my grandmother uses at our Italian Restaurant - she never uses olive oil to fry - too heavy and greasy - we use vegetable oil and brown on all sides - but not thoroughly through.  We also add a little milk to the mixture as well. We then put them in a VAT of marinara sauce and let it simmer for about an hour.  Best meatballs in the world - never tasted any better.  My grandmother (born in Italy) used to add raisins - but I never cared for them.  Enjoy!

I used only 1 2/3 cup of breadcrumbs and about a cup of bottled water . I used extra cheese for sub as bread crumbs ?? Pan fried in olive oil, enough to coat the bottom , browned all sides. Then took aluminum cooking pan and added a layer of my home made vodka sauce and panned in the meatballs. Covered , baked at 350 for 15 mins, then uncovered for 5

I made these meatballs with 1 pound of ground beef and 1 pound of ground pork. I also baked them instead of fried them then added them to the sauce. The sauce was simple; 2 15oz cans of tomato sauce (+1 can of water for each)
2 8oz cans of tomato paste (+1 can of water for each)
1tbs oregano
1tsp basil
2 tbs sugar
salt and pepper to taste

These were delicious! I made them for the first time just now and made the following adjustments to recipe:

1) only used about 1/3 cup of water and the meat was moist enough to form meatballs 2) used Italian breadcrumbs 3) used 1lb beef and 1lb pork 4) used 1.5 teaspoon of salt (recipe said to taste but i had not idea how much that would be.  tried this and it was perfect) 5) baked at 350 degrees for 30 minutes on a foil-lined baking tray. 

I'm making a slow-cooked red sauce from another recipe now and will simmer the meatballs in there prior to serving.  Enjoy!

My husband raved over these and he isn't even a fan of meatballs. They were really good and I will definitely be making these again! They were mild flavored and no particular flavor dominated making them perfect to showcase the delicious sauce I put them in. I cut this in half and only used ground beef. I only had white sandwich bread(2 slices), canned shredded Parmesan and Romano, and regular dried parsley. I added 1/2 c. milk instead of the water. I did have to be really careful turning these as they had a tendency to try and fall apart, but once the outsides were browned they held together just fine as long as I was careful with them. I let these simmer in the sauce for about 15 minutes while I was preparing the pasta and salad. My husband doesn't usually rave about a meal but this one he did. I agree these were tasty and were perfect with the homemade spaghetti sauce. I used a cookie scoop to make the meatballs and then only made 14 or so for tonight and froze the rest for later. This gave me 31 meatballs just from the lb. of meat. Thanks for fantastic recipe Geanine! We love this.

Great base recipe.  I don't follow the whole thing.  I only use beef (for ease).  I use the cheese, egg, salt, and pepper.  For the spices I just use dried oregano, basil, parsley (for ease). I use a whole lot less breadcrumbs and no water.  I pan fry in a whole lot less oil (just get the pan thinly covered).  They turn out great!  And keep well in the frig.  Thanks!!!

Delicious! I also added a finely chopped onion and minced garlic because I had so much on hand.  Also I used just 1/4 cup of milk for liquid with 2 1/2 cups crumbled bread.  I baked them on parchment paper at 350 for 45 minutes.  Yum - now I can pull them out of the freezer and make a quick meal or sauce.

This is the way my Italian Momma made meatballs and the way I make meatballs.
The key is the 3 meats and especially the frying in olive oil.   The frying gives the meatballs that extra flavor.
If including tomato sauce, poor the frying oil into the sauce when you add the meatballs to cook.  Adds an extra kick to the sauce.

I only had a pound of 95% lean ground beef on hand.  I halved the rest of the ingredients, except I still used 2 cloves of garlic and I used not even 1/4 cup water.  Also, to cut down on the fat I prefer to bake my meatballs in a roasting pan on a rack.  They came out great, thanks for the recipe!

I used 3/4 c water.  1/2 c may be enough.
Also used only enough oil to cover bottom of pan.
Very good!
I gave it 4 stars, but everyone raved about them so I guess I should give them a 5 star rating!!!
The meatballs are very soft and fall apart easily.

The next time I made them I used about 1/3+ C  water and I baked them at 350.  I shredded the bread, garlic and fresh parsley in the food processor!! (1 1/2 T fresh parsley = 2 tsps. dried)
I used     1 LB GROUND PORK  AND I LB GROUND BEEF.

These meatballs are delicious! I was looking for a meatball recipe that makes soft meatballs and this is it. I used only beef, added finely minced onions (as is my personal preference), and used milk instead of water (as some other reviewers suggested). I made ping pong sized balls and baked them at 350 degrees F for about 45 minutes, instead of frying. Then I added them to the sauce and served with pasta. I froze leftovers, popped them off the pan, and stored them in a bag in the freezer for another meal. For an easy meal, I just re-heated the frozen meatballs in sauce. We got two meals out of this recipe for our family of three with hearty appetites. We'll definitely make this often.

Best meatballs ever! I'm not a meatball fan per se, but these were so flavorful and easy that I might end up one! Pair this with a fresh, homemade marinara sauce, cover with freshly grated mozzarella, some garlic bread, and dinner is served! Gonna make smaller balls next time so I can serve as an appetizer. The meatballs I made were mini-meals!

Like another reviewer, I used equal parts veal, pork and beef (1 lb. each). Sometimes, I throw in an Italian sausage (removed from the casing) or an ounce of shredded ham. I bake them in the oven at 350 for 10-15 minutes, cool completely, then freeze. I make them using a 1 1/2 inch cookie scoop so I can use them for Italian wedding soup as well as spaghetti sauce.

I have been making my meatballs like this for several years and they truly are the best.  I did make a few adjustments which I think made these even better....I mix the meat, eggs, cheese and fresh parsley first.  I use fresh bread and make my own breadcrumbs using my mini food processor. Don't be afraid to go heavy on the fresh bread crumbs as it is what makes these so soft and tender!  I then use warm chicken broth( no sodium ) in place of the water as I beleive it adds more flavor!  I add about 1/4 cup at a time until the meat is very moist.  I  prefer to bake the meatballs in the oven at 350 for about 20 minutes. I usually make a double batch and freeze some .  Add meatballs to the sauce and simmer away.  Simply the best!!!

Very similar to what I am used to but for some reason(maybe the fresh bread crumbs) they were very delicious and needless to say, the recipe of choice!!! I don't fry - once my sauce is simmering, I drop them in the sauce very carefully and the seasonings even give the sauce more flavor!

Great recipe--I also like to bake at about 375 degrees.  I use parchment paper instead of foil--they don't stick that way.

I altered the ingredients and cooking method a tiny bit, so I'd give the version I made a 4.5, but I'm confident that if this were followed exactly they'd be a 5. These turned out yummy. 

My changes: I only used 1 pound of 80/20 ground beef so I halved the rest of the recipe (it yielded about 23 meatballs) and replaced the Romano with some shredded Parmesan I had in the fridge.  I also nixed the oil since I baked them in the oven. I baked them on a foil-lined cookie sheet at 325 degrees for about 25 minutes, then I put the oven on broil and let them cook for a minute or so. They were very juicy but I could've left them on broil a little longer to get them crispier. 

This was served over whole wheat penne with an out-of-the-jar version of tomato-pesto sauce... So yummy and relatively quick! I will be eating some leftover meatballs in a sandwich for lunch.

I made this exactly as written as I really don't think it's fair to make too many changes to a recipe and then review it.  Too much cheese, not enough garlic, not enough bread crumbs.  My meatballs were woefully under-seasoned.  I ate one on it's own first - bland.  I ate a 2nd one that I added salt and pepper to and it was much better.  I hate recipes that say "salt and pepper to taste".  That's fine if I'm making a sauce and I can taste as I go (although a starting point would be good i.e. 1/4 tsp. salt and increase to taste).  This is raw meat that you can't taste until it's fully cooked and too late.  I was worried that the Romano cheese would make them too salty and wish I'd seasoned more heavily.  I would also have used twice the garlic.  I MAY try these again but kind of doubt it.

I did a half batch for the meatballs.  I'm not a huge fan of cheese in my meatballs so I did not add any and used about 1 1/4 cup of fresh bread crumbs. I usually bake mine, but tried the frying.  It was a little too oily for me.  And because I didn't use the cheese, I only put in about a half cup of water.  I also used about 2-3 tsps of Herbs de Provence instead of parsley.  They came out light and flavorful.  Despite them feeling really wet when they were put together, they held their shape well enough.  Next time I will try baking them instead and adding a little more bread crumbs. Otherwise my family really liked them.  I was asked to keep the recipe.  :)

These are absolutely amazing! I scaled it down to 4 servings and only used ground beef for the meat. And I didn't use near as much olive oil as it called for. I used Parmesan cheese instead of Romano and bread crumbs instead of stale bread. Sorry to the people to hate when someone rates a recipe then says all they've changed about it. This is for my future reference the next time a make this.

These were really good!  I didn't have any pork or veal, so just used beef.  I also upped the garlic for personal preference, and used dried parsley and Italian breadcrumbs because that's what I had on hand.  Subbed Parmesan cheese and added some Worcestershire Sauce.  Baked in a 400 degree oven for 20 minutes instead of frying.  Delicious!  (And my husband's the meatball fan, not me.)

Next time I'll use a lot less cheese.  Don't get it twisted.........they were excellent.  But I wanted them to taste like meatballs, not Romano cheese balls.  I wasn't able to fully appreciate the taste of the combination of the 3 different meats.  Will still make again.  You do want to bake them instead of frying 'em.  Much easier.

Other than the fact that 1 and a half, even 1 and a quarter cup of water was WAY too much water (only slightly less than half a cup will do), this recipe was easy to prepare and tasted good.  I personally baked them on a cookie sheet with parchment paper at 350 degrees for an hour versus the oil and skillet.

Texturally, they were great.  I followed the recipe but reduced the cheese to 1/2c (which was perfect) and broiled to brown, rather than fried (finished cooking in sauce).  I'm trying to cut back on fats (although even w/changes, it's certainly not low fat!).  I will also add a bit more seasoning next time...maybe some minced onion, more garlic,  fresh basil, a little fennel seed? They were very tasty though.

I loved the recipe, but did change a few things.  Didn't use veal, used dried Italian seasoned bread crumbs, and dried parsley. Also, didn't fry, but baked for 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  They were light and delicious, and my family really liked them, too!

Very good recipe, although I did alter it a bit.  Used half beef & half pork.  I didn't have romano cheese, so used parmesean, powdered garlic instead of minced, used Italian seasoning instead of the parsley, added 1/4 tsp of red pepper for a little kick,  used a half cup of beef broth in place of the water, and I baked my meatballs rather than frying. A cup and a half of water seemed to be way too much.  My meatballs held up well baking as well as when I placed them into my pasta sauce.  They are very tender and have a great flavor.  The recipe made enough that I was able to get 40 nice size meatballs, half for now and half for later.

I think the recipe is written incorrectly.i made changes based on other reviewers suggestions
 For1 pound of ground beef I use 1/2 cup freshly made dried breadcrumbs, one egg and 3/4 cup milk. I add 1/2 cup chopped spinach in place of parsley., add cheese, seasonings, mix together, then roll 1/3 cup meatballs - place on EVOO baking sheet bake @ 350    40-45 minutes.
Great to freeze- quick meatball sandwich w red sauce.

I make this recipe every time I make meatballs, but I change a couple of things (I hate when reviewers do this, too, but it helps when you don't have everything in the kitchen):

I use only ground beef, I never have the parsley so I leave it out, canola oil instead of olive, I will sub in a little milk or half and half for some of the water, and Trader Joes Romano/Parmesan mixture (the one off of the shelf) instead of just fresh Romano.  I have used both regular Italian bread crumbs and gluten-free bread crumbs, and they both come out delicious. I make the gluten-free ones when my gluten-free people come over - they love it with the Udi's gluten-free bread and mozzarella cheese.  Yummy gluten-free meatball parm!

I brown them in the oil and then the key is using Rao's Marinara pasta sauce to let it simmer for an hour or so (the next day it's even better.)  The sauce is on the expensive side, but it is truly the best sauce for meatballs.

My fiance came home with a pound of ground beef requesting fried meatballs. I've been trying to find a recipe like his grandmother's for the last decade with little success and decided to try this one.  I didn't have fresh parsley, garlic or breadcrumbs on hand and subbed store bought versions. I fried them on med-low then finished them on medium to get the outside extra crispy.  My fiance and our kids loved them (I'm vegetarian) and it is the closest I have come to Ma's elusive meatballs! This recipe is going in my cookbook - I'm sure they'll be even better with fresh ingredients next time.  Thank you!

I used venison in the place of the veal and sausage in the place of the ground pork.  I also used homemade gluten-free bread crumbs instead of the italian bread crumbs.  We par-baked these in the oven and popped them in the freezer.  I usually make a very large batch so that I always have them on hand.  They make a quick meal, and my whole family just loves them!

This is a very good recipe. I changed the Romano to Asiago for fun and like that a lot also. Also, I'm reading other people's comments about the ball sticking to the pan...Cooking 101 people...turn down the heat...you way too hot!!! If your oils is at a correct temperature, they will not stick...I bet the pan is smoking when they are sticking??? There is no way that guy is a chef if he is going to write a comment like that...

Just baking the meatballs are going to dry them out. If you want to bake them, at least get a nice sear on the meat so the juices stay with the meat...I like to fry and them simmer in sauce...again...this recipe Is fairly decent! Good job! :-)

Really good meatballs. I followed the recipe as indicated except I only used ground pork.  I eyeballed the measurements for the seasonings since I only had about half a pound of meat.  I used the lukewarm water as mentioned in the recipe...wow!  What a difference!  The meatballs came out juicy and tasty.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Wow! These meatballs are great. As good as or better than most restaurants where we enjoy Italian food. We used good quality ground beef and spicy Italian sausage from our local farmers market. And we baked instead of pan frying as many other reviewers suggested. I can't even believe we made these ourselves! They are so good. This one's a keeper.

I wanted to make some meatball sandwiches for dinner and found this recipe for meatballs. I reduced the recipe down to 4 servings  because there are only two of us. followed the recipe exactly except for the fresh parsley I used dried instead because that is all I had. And I didn't use veal.  I used some homemade sausage that I had in the freezer. I didn't fry them I baked them in the oven as others suggested.  These turned out great.  The only thing I will do different next time is to make them smaller.

I never had the knack of making good meatballs  until now.   These meatballs are the best.  I made some substitutions out of necessity -  1 1/2 # ground beef,  1/2 cup cheese, and 2 english muffins soaked in water.  The meatballs came out tasty and light and just delicious.  Thank you.

I made this with 93% lean beef and ground turkey, but followed most of the rest of the recipe.  Seared the outside and finished in crock pot. Was very delicious without the extra fat.  This is my "go to" recipe when making meatballs for any occasion.

Baked mine on 350 for 50 minutes, simply amazing. I also used someone else advice to cook any extra on 375 for 10 minutes, then put into freezer for one hour, then transfer into freezer Ziploc. I used a 12 serving size recipe. It made 45 larger sized meatballs.

Fantastic! I added one pound of each meat then added a little more of everything else (except for the water, only added half a cup of that) to make up for the extra pound of meat. I baked mine for 30 minutes at 350 and they are perfect, simmering now in Arribiata sauce for about 10 minutes.

I did tweak it a bit, but the basic ingredients were an awesome delight.  Instead of stale bread crumbs I used asiago cheese bread and pulsed it in my food processor.  Instead of salt, I added 1.5 tsp. beef base past and 1 tsp pork base to the 1.5 cups of water.  I didn't have Romano cheese so substituted fresh parmesan.  I think the asiago bread made up for the difference. I also used a small ice cream scooper and never had to touch the mixture.  The final results were awesome!!

I make my meatballs using equal parts ground beef and ground turkey. I also bake them. Just line your pan with parchment paper and they will come out perfectly round and they just roll off the paper. I also wear nitrile gloves when mixing the meats, spices, egg and breadcrumbs and also when shaping them. Keeps your hands clean and wear and tear of the skin. Adding an egg to the meat mixture helps to hold the meat together.

I thought they were really good meatballs.  I screwed up and lined the pan with foil instead of parchment and that was a huge mistake - all the extra delicious cheese I added to the recipe stuck to the bottom of the pan as di half of each meatball :(  BUT despite my sticking disaster, the meatballs themselves were great.

Your recipe title is correct.  These are absolutely the best!  I made a triple batch as written the other night &  my husband was practically tearing the refrigerator apart last night looking for them! I had frozen them in meal size portions so I had to show him where they were.  I fear there'll be none left when I go to make them for a meal!!  Absolutely the greatest!!!  Thanks!

This is the best meatball recipe I have tried so far. They are light in texture and very moist. We baked ours in the oven on a lightly greased cookie sheet (with the edge) and they come out just as good.

I got a little carried away. I misread the original recipe, and added about a cup of parsley, plus I added a sauted onion. Instead of Italian bread I used Planko instead, had it on hand. also added some mozarelle I needed to use up.AND, ( I told you I got carried away), instead of water, I used some red wine. Now I know there is debate about whether to cook your meatballs in the sauce, or pre-brown (which I have always done in past), so I did 50-50. Used a tomato-basil sauce, and added some fresh mushrooms. This was a FEAST! The meatballs were the star!!! I used all beef, 93% lean, but I figured the extra cheese made it less so. All in all, the original recipe is a great base recipe. By the way, added some red win to the chef too! :).

My family of 4 men liked these, including my picky eater. I used 1/3 cup already grated parmesan/romano cheese in stead of what they called for. I used all ground beef, and substituted the parsley for 1 Tbsp. Italian seasoning. I baked them instead of frying them, but because some of the fat was lost, I would definitely put them in some sort of sauce/soup.

These are wonderful! I do add sautéed finely chopped onion and more garlic...and bake them in the over on a cooling rack and cookie sheet to drain the excess fat. This is my go-to recipe!

Wonderful M-Balls!!  I used 1 1/2 Gr. meat and 1 lb Italian Sausage.  1 Envelope of Good Seasons Italian dressing mix and instead of water, grated a cup of zuchini for the moisture.  Instead of parsley, I used fresh sweet basil.  Yum!!

I made this recipe almost exact. I only used ground beef and veal. It came out very tasty and moist! I didn't measure out all the ingredients, I just "eyed" it but overall I loved it!

I tried this recipe and it came out a weird texture that was mushy. We kept them in the oven trying to get them to solidify more. I followed the recipe, but added more garlic, pepper, and salt and used store bought bread crumbs....This is where I think it went wrong. Do yourself a favor and make your own or at least get the cubed stuffing ones

This recipe was very easy for a first timer like myself.  I used another reviewers advice and used ground italian sausage instead of pork along with veal and ground beef.   I also didn't use as much water as the recipe called for.  Instead of using stale bread, I used Italian bread crumbs.  Excellent recipe and fiance was impresssed.  These were some of the best homemade meatballs I have ever had...

Very good. But try useing equal portions of the B,V,P. The Garlic that you use brown it in the oil just to flavor the oil I find if you put the garlic in the meat you're tasting it all day. a little parm. cheeze in the meat gives a little extra  flavor.

I make these meatballs using fresh chopped basil instead of parsley.  I also freeze them uncooked and drop them directly into my homemade spagetti sauce and cook in the sauce, it gives the sauce a real nice flavor as well as the meatballs.

Undoubtedly the best Italian meatballs I've ever made OR tasted!  I made this recipe twice and both times only used ground round, used canned italian bread crumbs, added about 3 tablespoons of minced onion, and used about 1/2 cup of water.  Once I sauteed and once baked and both were excellent!  This will be my standard

Meatballs cooked this way are AMAZING! They taste good the day you make them but get better after sitting in the fridge over night. I like eating them cold the next morning.

I've been looking for an easy to make, good meatball recipe for a long time and this is the best I've made yet. To stay true to the recipe, I pan fried a few of the meatball, but baked most of them. The fried meatballs were a little drier than the baked ones, so I would reccomend baking them. I made them roughly the size of golf balls and baked them at 400 degrees for 30 minutes before dropping them in my marinara sauce for a few more minutes. The only other change I may make in the future is finding a way to spice them up a bit as I love a good spicy meatball.

Great recipe!!  I got rave reviews from the family; this will definitely be our new recipe for meatballs, because when they're this easy to make, why would you buy those preservative-filled meatballs from the freezer section?  The only changes I made were omitting veal and substituting more pork, one package of chopped spinach for the parsley and I was out of cheese, so I left that out too.

Geanine - You outdid yourself with THIS recipe!  Absolutely the best meatballs I've ever made.  The only thing I did differently was to drop them in the sauce instead of frying them.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as written.  Even my husband who has never been a big fan of meatballs, raved about these.  Today is the second time this month that I am making them.  This recipe is a KEEPER for sure! I'd give it more stars if it were possible!  Thanks for sharing. All the best. Maria

Excellent meatballs. Maybe the best I've ever had. I used Kraft parm cheese (all I had handy), and just used 1 cup of water. I did fry them which I NEVER do. It took forever but they are great. They didn't hold their shape well for me but they taste great.

Very tasty - I baked in the oven to reduce the fat. I made the mistake of not adding additional salt thinking they probably wouldn't need it since I used a Tuscan italian seasoning blend that had salt in. Could have used a bit more. I made half tiny meatballs for wedding soup and the other half standard size to freeze for sauce later.

These meatballs were quite tasty. I tweaked the recipe based on what I had in my frige, but they still came out great. I eliminated the ground beef for fear of a heavy greasy taste. I forgot the crusty bread, so I used a little bit of 4C breadcrumbs. And I used pecorino romano cheese...delish!! Next time I will bake in the oven on a rack so that the grease can drain as they cook.    Also, go easy on the salt b/c the cheese already has a nice salty bite.

These were absolutely the best ever. I used 1/2 c milk, 1 c water and Italian bread crumbs as suggested by others. Baked at 350 deg for 45 mins using parchment paper on a cookie sheet.

I used the ingredients exactly as outlined and these meatballs were just alright. Quite heavy on the parmesan for me... I par-baked them as another user suggested and finished cooking them in a homemade marinara sauce - Big Mistake! Definitely cook these meatballs completely before adding to any kind of sauce. Otherwise they render a ton of grease and leach a lot of parmesan into the sauce, clouding it up.  I'm not positive but I think frying/baking them completely (as the recipe says) would help mitigate the leaching.  Definitely couldn't hurt to have less cheese in there to begin with... The meat should be the star here!

I have to say these were great. I added the olive oil to the mix, misreading, but added less. That and the water made the difference. Incredibly moist and delicious.Will have to apply this technique to turkey meatballs and burger patties.

These are really good.  I used 1lb beef & 1lb italian sausage.  Used about 1 cup water & 1 cup italian bread crumbs.  Will make again.

I recently had dinner at a place in Toronto known as "the nose" and one of their signature dishes is an appetizer of one giant meatball swimming in sauce with shavings of asiago.  It is melt-in-your mouth good.  This meatball recipe comes the closest to it I have ever had.  I did make some changes because I couldn't get the ground veal that day and instead used chorizo sausage and lean ground beef.  Kept true to the rest of the recipe but also baked instead of frying and only because after adding the water, with the already moist sausage meat I wasn't sure it would hold up in the frying pan.  Despite using no oil at all it was fantastic!  It looked beautiful too but we were too hungry to stop and take a picture. Thank you for a great recipe!

These are "Anna & Frankie's Meatballs" from Rao's Restaurant Cookbook.  Make sure to use good olive oil for frying(avoid extra virgin as it has a lower smoke point), then drop into simmering sauce for 15 minutes.

I don't know where to start. These are the_ B_E_S_T_!!! I saw a picture of RandyRandy's the other night, and thought; Those look really good, I had to try. I don't eat veal, so I subed 'ground turkey' for it. I made eighteen 'meatballs[ larger then a golf ball, smaller then a tennis ball] Was worried about the water, [used it slowly],it works. GREAT RECIPE! Also baked them on a broiler pan,425 degrees, about 10 min. on each side.

These are seriously Fantastic! I've made them about 5 times, and the last time I made them I forgot to add cheese. They were still pretty good but cheese is crucial to their 5-star deliciousness. I add milk to my homemade breadcrumbs and add only a little water as needed. I've baked and fried - both ways were great so now I stick to baking for health factor + ease. I love to freeze them and drop into sauce as needed. This has now become my signature dish! Thank you for posting!!!

My family didn't really like these.  I thought the taste was good, but the texture was way too soft.  I never added water to my meatballs before, so I'm sure that had something to do with it.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly.  I did cook them in a slower cooker on low, but they literally fell apart in the pot.  If I do make them again, I will not be using all that water.

This is "the best" for sure.  I've been looking for a meatball with the right texture and taste and this is the one! The fresh bread crumbs and cheese do make the difference.  I used to use dried crumbs but was never happy with the taste or texture.  Thanks for a great recipe.  This one is a keeper :)

We are trying to watch our weight but got really sick of raw veggie diet.  We decided to make something tasty but yet wouldn't jeopardize what we've lost.  This was just the recipe we wanted... water and cheese in meatballs... who knew? (at least I didn't). After looking at the nutritional value, we decided to make a few changes... half the cheese and bread crumbs. In addition, we added worchestire sauce, sicilian bread dipping salt, and mustard for flavor... instead of frying, we pan fried which eliminated a lot of the fat from the meat... and of course, portion control, smaller balls. End result... YUMMY!  The smell was amazing the whole process...

Finally I have found the recipe for great meatballs. The best I have ever tasted. My sons loved them. I followed the recipe to the letter, although I was a little apprehensive about using water, but they were delicious. This is certainly a recipe I will prepare many times in the future. Thanks!

I made these per the recipe but used only ground beef and pork (I couldn't find ground veal at my store)and omitted the water.  I also used gluten free bread crumbs since I'm intolerent to gluten.  I was afraid that the meatballs would fall apart but they held together very well.  The taste was great.  They were easy to make and I will definitely make them again.  I will try to find the ground veal for next time.

Very good recipe...could not find veal so just used 1 pound of hot sausage and 1 pound of hamburger meat and baked the meatballs as suggested by other reviewers and it came out great.  Even made some with alfredo sauce and they were very good with that too.

Like others, I soaked the bread in milk not water. I also upped the amount of garlic, and used an Italian seasoning blend instead of fresh parsley. One cup of oil for frying is ridiculous - I just lightly sprayed the skillet with Pam. These weren't the best meatballs ever, but they were definitely very good. Thanks, Geanine!

For health reasons I use ground turkey and bake the balls in the oven and drain off the fat.  I know its not as tasty as the pork/beef/veal version but its healthier

i do my meatballs almost the same way....but.....you don't have to spend all that time frying them and making a mess.try placing meatballs in an oblong glass pan and cook in microwave 10 min per 15 meatballs..then place in gravy or sauce.......let them   finish cooking for about 30 min. you will love this easy way.

This recipe is wonderful!!  My college age children are home for the summer and this recipe is perfect for a quick spaghetti dinner, meatball subs or a great snack.  I followed the recipe to the tee except I used less water and baked instead of frying.  I doubled it for plenty of leftovers!!

Really good recipe.  I won't use veal so I doubled the ground pork and it was very good.  I'll make them again.

These meatballs were fantastic! My market doesn't sell the three meats individually so I lucked out with a ground beef, veal, and pork meatloaf. I also used dry Italian bread crumbs. They worked wonderfully. After sauteeing the meatballs I added them to my marinara to simmer all day. Day three I made the best lasagna we've ever had with the leftover meatballs and sauce. Mmmmm. Thanks for the wonderful recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!!  I've been looking for a good meatball recipe for years that has the right consistency and great taste; this one is definetly it!  I made a few changes out of necessity mostly....I used 2lbs. of ground beef (80/20), 1 1/2 cups of dried italian bread crumbs, 1 1/2 tbsp of fresh basil and chives (I didnt' have parsley), and 1 cup of water.  They turned out great; thanks for the recipe!!

The quintessential meatball!  So good and a piece of cake to make.
I didn't have the stale bread so I used bread crumbs and they were delicious.

I made these meatballs yesterday with homemade sauce and followed the recipe and did not make any changes.  This ios the BEST meatballs ever they are very tasty and moist.  Everyone loved them.  This made 24 meatballs and I have none left they were fighting over the last ones.  And it was only 4 adults and a toddler eating.  Thanks again so much for this recipe this is going to be my meatballs recipe for ever.

Just like my italian grandparents used to make.  I followed this recipe exactly until the end.  I cooked the meatballs in a baking dish in the oven at 350 for 30 minutes instead of frying them.  

Thanks.

I was a little skeptical at first but these turned out quite good. I would recommend using as little oil as possible since my meatballs came out a little greasy. Still really good though!

First attempt at meatballs, a decent starter recipe but not the best. I'll cut the breadcrumbs in half next time since the texture was not the greatest. Will also try some extra seasoning. Also, used only a tiny bit of oil in a skillet and rolled them around to evenly cook them.

these really were the best meatballs I have ever had, let alone made. They were so moist, everybody kept going back for more. They have become a family favorite overnite. The only change I had to make was I used a pound of ground pork because I couldn't find any ground veal.

Great meatballs.  Beats what I've been cooking for 20 years.  I had Panko (Japanese bread flakes) so I used them instead of the Italian breadcrumbs which gave the meatballs a light texture.  I also ground my meat twice using my Kitchenaid meat grinding attachment.

Oh wow, these were fantastic!  I only had ground beef and italian sausage on hand, followed others advice of using milk instead of water.  I baked instead of frying.  These morsels turned out better than I had hoped!  Perfect for meatball subs, yay!

These are super. I did make some changes...I cut the recipe in half and just used 1 lb ground beef. I didn't use french bread, but used 1/4 cup of Italian bread crumbs. I cut the water down to 1/2 cup instead of 3/4. Oh, I didn't have fresh romano cheese, so I used the dried Parmesan/Romano blend and I only used 1/4 cup. I didn't have fresh parsley either, so I used fresh basil. Honestly, I kind of made my own meatball, but they were super good. Thanks for the base!

This was very good.  The only substitutions I made were using dried parsley for the fresh (1t dried to 1T fresh) and used Italian Seasoned Breadcrumbs instead of making my own.  Be careful not to overcook the meatballs, which can happen if some are smaller than others.  And remember, they continue to cook when you put them in the sauce.

These truly are the BEST meatballs!  My Italian Grandma always made delicious meatballs but as with all good Italian cooks, never used a recipe.  I have tried for years to duplicate her recipe and this one is as good (or maybe even a little better) than what I remember.  I cook them all day in sauce, along with Italian sausage.  Leftovers are great as hot or cold sandwiches!

I really like these meatballs. They are very tasty! I only change one thing since my husband is allergic to eggs I use an egg replacer and they still are great. I will continue making these meatballs with my sauce.

This is a wonderful recipe. My family really liked this. I could not find any veal so I used Sweet Italian Sausage. I removed the skin and worked it into the ground beef.I was a bit concerned about the addition of that much liquid. I only used 3/4 cup of warter. The meatballs came out just fine. I will be using this recipe from now on.

These were delicious!  I substituted 1 LB ground pork and left out the veal.  Also used 1 cup of fresh Parmesan and Italian Bread Crumbs and they still turned out great.  They go well with the Best Marinara Sauce Yet on this site!  Thanks for a keeper!

Great meatballs. I used all beef, parmesan instead of romano, and italian seasoning instead of parsley. A+

I took the easy way out on this and used prepared bread crumbs and prepared shredded romano cheese because it was all I had in the house.  I used beef and pork and eliminated the veal. It was still excellent.  I used italian seasoning and basil. I used a little less water and less olive oil for frying.  These were very tasty!

The Best! I used ground turkey in lieu of all the other meats and had to omit the water.

These are absolutely the most delicious meatballs I have ever tasted.  I made mine with a pound and a half of ground pork, 1/2 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb ground veal and they turned out very moist and yummy.  This recipe is definitely a keeper!

this is great!!  makes a ton of meat balls.  I've also used this as a meatloaf recipie.  350 for 45 - 60 minutes.  the only thing I do differently is add 1 1/2 tbsp of Italian seasoning.  Also, I didn't use 1 1/2 cups of water.  I only used a little over 1/2c.

these are great meatballs.  i made them last night & cooked them in the oven at 350 for about 15 minutes (i guess the cooking time depends on how big your meatballs are).  that way it wll cut down on fat.  i used ground sirloin.  i'm going to add them to spaghetti sauce tonight.  great for a make-ahead meal!

First time I attempted meatballs; they came out pretty good!  I was a little confused by the bread crumbs.  Two cups of cubed bread, then whirl them through the blender?  Or two cups of crumbs?  I started with one cup of bread crumbs (what I had on hand) and the meatballs flattened out like crabcakes.  I added another cup of crumbs and they held their shape a little better.  Maybe less water next time?  But they tasted great!!

This was the first time I've ever made meatballs and they turned out great!  I used a combination of hamburger and ground pork.  Also, I substituted regular white bread for the Italian bread.  

The recipe was big so I set the extra uncooked meatballs on wax paper and froze them until they were hard.  Then I transferred them to a Ziploc and froze them for another meal.

Very good basic meatball recipe. I threw in more seasonings, cut way back on the water and skipped the browning step. Hubby and I feel that frying turns the meatballs into round hamburgers, so we prefer to place them right into the sauce. Really delicious and thanks!

Very good! My meatballs came out a little bit too soft, but it was the first time I've done meatballs, and I live in a humid area. Next time I will add less water. But they were very tasty, and froze well. Will definitely use again. Thanks!

I had never made meatballs before and was a little skeptical that they'd turn out. And guess what, they turned out beautifully. I used just ground beef, and used parmesan cheese instead of Romano. Very tasty! Thanks Geanine!

I added onions, used italian breadcrumbs and parm chese.  I fried half the recipe and baked the other half.  I found the baking easier and I didn't lose any meatballs that way.

I've been trying for years to make a good meatball.  I haven't made one until I found this recipe.  They were great and my whole family enjoyed them. I didn't use veal, though.  I substituted more ground beef.  The consistancy and flavor were just what I was looking for.

These were good, but not much different than other meatball recipes I have tried.  I was hoping for a recipe that was a little more unique, more of a signature dish.  I added equal parts of the three kinds of meat because it is usually sold in the grocery store packaged as a meatball mix.  I did not brown them ahead of time, just threw them in the slow cooker, covered them with sauce and cooked them for 4 hours on high.  Added some red pepper flakes to give them a little more flavor.

These turned out really well! I tweaked the recipe based on what I had around: I used half beef/half pork, substituted parmesan cheese for the romano, used store bought romano flavored breadcrumbs, and used about 1/2 cup of milk instead of the water.  I also omitted the oil for browning the meat, they did fine on their own.  I baked them for about 10 minutes before letting them cook in the sauce for a few minutes.

Excellent recipe!  I used the combination of ground meats, fresh breadcrumbs and freshly grated romano cheese.  I used no more than a 1/2 cup of the water though, and you really don't need all that oil.  I used about 1/4 cup.  Very moist, great taste.  Even better the next day!

I never thought I could make meatballs, since I'd never tried, but these were so easy, and they turned out really good.  I didn't have the variety of meats on hand, so I just used ground beef.  I would reduce the amount of water, because they were a little too moist.

These meatballs were delicious, but they turned out a little too watery.  I didn't have fresh parsley on hand, so I substituted the parsley with italian seasoning and it worked out nicely.  We really enjoyed these meatballs with our pasta.  Thanks for sharing!

Made a double batch of these. Followed instructions precisely.  Disappointed. Nothing special. No zing. They are OK, but not worth the trouble. Guess I need to add some Italian sausage.

I've never been a big meatball fan.  I like the concept, but find I am disappointed with most of the recipes I have tried.  This one is the exception.  These were VERY tasty and relatively easy to make.  What else could you ask for?  I combined with some pasta and a simple Ragu sauce and it was an amazing meal thanks to these flavorful meatballs.  I will definitely keep this recipe handy and use it often.

Love, love LOVE these meatballs!! I doubled the recipe to freeze and baked them like everyone suggested. I used them for meatball subs and spaghetti with Rao spaghetti sauce and was the BEST spaghetti I’ve ever tasted. Thank you for sharing!

A couple of months ago Savour Magazine had this recipe, it was featured from Naples.  I made it without veal for some reason it hard to find good meal in Maine, but just using beef and pork worked just find.  I think the secret to the best results to this recipe is not over handling the meat after adding the bread mixture.  These were superb!

I make spaghetti and sausage and everyone loves it.  But I like meatballs way better.  I decided to add some meatballs along with the sausage.  So happy to find this recipe.  Read the reviews and made the following changes.  A dash of oregano, a splash of Worchester sauce.  Next time I will add a little more garlic )what can I say, I love garlic).  I baked them as suggested and brushed with olive oil to brown them.  They finished cooking in the sauce and I have request now for more meatballs in the future.   Thank you Geanine for"Really The Best Meatballs Ever".

Perfect meatballs! Will never make another version again. Made with 1 pound ground beef and 1 pound turkey Italian sausage. Added a bit more breadcrumbs and a bit more cheese. Tossed in red sauce after the oven. Delish!

I needed a quick meatball recipe  and this was the perfect one!  I just used ground beef and 3/4 Cup breadcrumbs (didn’t have any bread in the house) baked them for 25 minutes!
The meatballs were moist and delicious!

My Mother in-law who is Portuguese & Italian taught me this recipe. I had lost her recipe years ago. But this pretty much the exact recipe. Makes exceptional meatballs, can't go wrong if you follow directions. I on occasion do Ground Beef and Ground Turkey together (1lb GB 1/2lb Turkey) these are moist, and soft, but do not fall apart. Great recipe! Thanks

This was really tasty, best meatballs I've ever made (not that *that's* a big thing, as I think all I've ever done in the past is put a few spices in some hamburger and roll it into balls, then bake them). I only had hamburger and ground pork, and I had to use dried parsley flakes, but otherwise followed the recipe. So good. Thank you, it's in my recipe book now.

These are the way my grandma and my mom made them, and now I do.  They really are delicious.  I don’t use veal in mine, just beef and pork, and you can taste the difference if you have had them that way, but they are still really a great meatball.  Everyone loves them.

The taste of the meatballs are amazing! The only thing I would change is instead of frying them -  bake them. Just as tasty.
 ( I did both ways).

Since there’s only two of us I cut the recipe down:
1lb 90% lean ground beef
1 c fresh grated bread crumbs
1 egg
1/2c Mexican shredded cheese
Salt & Pepper to taste
1 Tbls dried chopped parsley
1/4 c extra virgin olive oil
1/3 c water
The meatballs turned out crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. Wonderfully seasoned.

I used 1 pound of hot Italian sausage and 1 pound of ground beef (80/20). Instead of water I used 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of buttermilk and 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of pepper. I rolled the meatballs (1/4th cup) and cooked them in muffin cups. They cook perfectly in 30 minutes on 375. This recipe was great. I let half of the meatballs cool and put them in the freezer for later.  I added the other half of the meatballs to marinara sauce and they were perfect as meatball subs.

Some of the best I’ve ever made. I substituted bison for the beef. I put in about 1/2 cup each of finely diced onion and bell pepper.  That made them nice and moist and I baked them on a rack instead of frying them.

I hate to rate a recipe I've made changes to but this deserves 5 stars  before my changes.   
I won't go into which types of meat to use, ground veal in not commonly available in my area, we tend to let the cattle get a bit bigger before we knock 'em in the head. 
I use lean meats and sometimes a mixture of Romano and Parmesan cheese,  fresh grated.  
The one thing I do that I think really sets this off is I use Chianti wine  instead of water.   Or sometimes a Shiraz.  
I bake mine on  a rack so they drain in a hot oven to an internal temp of 155.   With a hot oven (375) it does a nice crust on the exterior.  You just have to pull them quick.  I roll mine by hand about the size of a golf ball or even a bit bigger. This keeps the cheese from all melting out.

This is one we batch cook in a large about, 5 times what the recipe calls for.   We freeze them.  These are great when we go camping.

I used half beef/half pork and subbed milk for water, reduced cheese by half- per other reviewers, baked at 350 for about 30 minutes... tender, delicious probably the best I have ever made.

Anyone who says these don’t fry perfectly may be using the wrong oil and not getting the temperature correct. I use a cast iron pan but you don’t have to. I also use a blended oil which cooks evenly. Get your pan as hot as you can-you May have to adjust as you go on and go slightly lower. You don’t want the oil to flash. They cook evenly and the cheese gets yummy and brown. The meatballs are delicious! I haven’t needed to use quite as much water as called for. Give it a go!

I balked at the number of bread-crumbs the recipe called for, but it turned out exceptionally well! I added a minuscule amount of jalapeno pepper to the recipe a second time around and it was a nice touch.

Absolutely amazing. Combined them with a tomato and basil sauce and served them with tagliatelle. Now I have a new ace up my sleeve. Recommended 11/10.

Never liked meatballs bcs they were just so much MEAT! These have great balance, are soft, moist. Have become a staple: my preschooler can help AND will eat them! 

I use lean gr beef (cheaper, I can’t tell much diff, Italian ground mix not common in my area), prepared breadcrumbs, but do grate fresh cheese, and I bake them (easier, bit healthier, approx 35mins @ 350F on greased/lined cookie sheet). 

Def follow instructions about water when mixing: want almost too much water so they “just” hang together. When done baking, I simmer a few minutes in GOOD jarred marinara (Rao’s is my fave, worth the $$ for your yummy meatballs!), serve over pasta. Quick, family friendly, kid involvement = A+

One situation I began with is the ground pork and ground veal are only sold in my area frozen in 1 lb packs.  So therefore, I used 1 lb each of ground veal and ground pork and 2 lbs of ground beef.  I also increased the eggs.  Since I wasn't sure if the recipe called for large or extra large eggs, I put in 5 extra large eggs and would probably make it 6 extra large eggs when I make this again.  I was able to get 6.5 dozen meatballs from this amount of meat, making them the size of a golf ball.    I also increased the garlic to 6 cloves minced, 4 TB parsley, added 4 TB fresh Basil, Fresh Oregano because I like those seasonings.  I had 4 cups of stale bread and added my milk ( recipe called for water) to the bread to let it soak together. I also increased the milk to 3 cups and did add about another 1/4 cup as the bread really soaked up the milk quickly. I followed one of the other reviewers suggestion and baked the meatballs on parchment paper for 50 minutes at 350, turning them over at 30 minutes. I drained the meatballs on paper towel after coming out of the oven.     I made Chef John's Mushroom Gravy ( found on Allrecipes) and added 2 dozen meatballs for our dinner that night.  I froze the rest to have later.  I plan to make a tomato sauce and or more mushroom gravy or both as we have 4 dozen plus meatballs left.  I would make this recipe again, with these adjustments due to our tastes and style of cooking.

We have been making these, as written, for years. When we moved we found that obtaining veal is nearly impossible and $14/lb when we could. So sadly, no more veal. But with the beef and pork, it is just about as good.

The best meatballs ever. They take time to make but they are worth every minute.  Double the recipe and freeze some for another day.  They freeze very well.

This is the best recipe I have found for meatballs. I did change a little by adding about a 1/2 cup panko since I ran out of bread crumbs. I made close to 2 lbs of  meat loaf mix (veal and ground chuck). Oh, I also added a whole medium diced yellow onion.  The taste was wonderful and the meatballs melt in your mouth! This will be my go to recipe for meatballs!

Every time I try to make meatballs they never turn out right.  Sometimes they are dry, other time they don’t have the taste.  Just a terrible time trying to make meatballs.  However, this recipe is amazing!  It was easy to follow and make and tasted amazing!  Anyone can make these and enjoy!  Great recipe!

I really like this meatball recipe. It's a little on the bland side - next time I think I'll up the garlic and add more seasonings. But for a good, basic meatball, it's very good. PS only added 1/2 cup water and that was sufficient.

I’ve made this 3 times now. First and second times exactly as written. This third time I included all ingredients except breadcrumbs and then split it in half. I then soaked breadcrumbs in milk (1/2 recipe) for one part, again exactly as written except milk instead of water. The other 1/2 I wanted keto friendly so used crunched up pork rinds in water and used that to replace breadcrumbs in that half. I baked them all instead of frying.  The keto ones were good but texture not as good as the ones with breadcrumbs. My husband liked them better when I fried them. They browned up more. Although it was so much easier and way less mess to cleanup baking them. I put them on a cookie rack while baking. Next time I’m going to try to baking them right on the tin foil and see if that is more browned/fried tasting for my husband.  This is such a good recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Finally made a meatball I like with this recipe. I used beef and mild italian sausage 2:1. Used fresh bread and italian breadcrumbs 2:1. Dried parsley because I didnt have fresh, the rest the same. These meatballs were moist & delicious. Honestly best Ive had in a long time (much better than my mother in-laws).Almost forgot to mention I baked them in the oven 350 for 45 min and made them about 2 inches in diameter - I like them big and juicy.

Great simple recipe. I added 2tbsp worcestershire and 1 diced onion. I also oven baked at 375 for 20 mins instead of frying. Mistakenly added all the oil to the mixture anyways and they came out of the oven a perfect golden brown.

Best meatball recipe (so far) that I've found, and fun to make.  The only note I have, is how large to make the meatballs?  We did 2oz, which seemed a tad on the large side.  Maybe do 1.75oz or 1.5oz next time and see how it goes.

Par baked these at 325 degrees for 10 minutes and froze them like one user recommended and just heat them in sauce when we are ready to eat them. Amazing.

OMG I don't have a Nonna although we have one in our extended in law family. I love her and her meatballs (among other delicious meals). They are always so light and fluffy and unbelievably good. This is the first time I have ever made meatballs like hers. I don't use veal and I didn't cook them as long but otherwise pretty much followed the recipe. I feel Italian tonight!

I didn't use veal, used only 1 egg and less than a cup of water. I used plain sausage and added garlic powder, crushed fennel, dried oregano, Italian seasoning, and dehydrated onion flakes. Rolled into small meatballs, baked at 350 about 20 minutes until internal temp was 165: WOW!! SUPER TENDER AND DELISH. I'll make these often. I made them for an easy spaghetti and meatballs dinner last night, and the extra batch for tonight's spinach tomato tortellini soup (also from this site). Thanks for sharing the recipe!

Great! Moist I've always put some of the sauce/gravy with meatballs instead of WATER- I just used same amount of sauce as water fyi-Even beef broth would give more flavor than water! Baked on rack in oven 25 minutes at 350 then added to sauce another 30 min. Tried frying and they fall apart!

Very good! Used almost 4 pounds of lean ground beef  only and doubled to 16 servings. Stopped at around 2.5 cups of water, used dry parsley since I didn’t have fresh. My husband said they were the tastiest meatballs I’ve ever made. Kids approved, too!

These meatballs were fantastic! A few substitutions but it was a winner! We used 2 lbs deer meat-1 lb beef-1 lb pork. I didn’t have the right cheese so I used Parmesan reganno with stunning results! Next time I’ll split the recipe with this, and then when done cooking add some chili powder to make it spicy! Seems versatile, and with how much it makes doubling the recipe you’ll be set. We have plans for leftovers with teriyaki and udon noodles, then curry powder and rice. Will let you know if it’s worth a try!

A very good meatball.  I did make some substitutions based on meat type and cooking method.  The flavor is great, texture is good and my daughter who doesn’t typically eat meatballs likes them!  Made quite a few, so I’ll freeze some and have meatball sandwiches with the rest another day.

Made it exactly as listed, except dried parsley. I might have used garlic cloves that were too large. And I thought the meatballs were much better once simmered in the sauce. Very nice recipe.

I made the recipe as directed. Think that ¾ cup of cheese would have been plenty. Whole family enjoyed them. Made with gluten free bread crumbs. I would recommend wearing some surgical type gloves while rolling the meatballs. The recipe makes plenty of meatballs, consider planning to freeze half unless you have a large family.

I enjoyed this recipe!!! I have been looking for a tri-meat recipe, like the one my dad used to make. This is close... I would not use as much breadcrumbs. I used about 1 cup and a half and they were beautifully balanced.

First time making meatballs and never turning back to store bought. Made a few changes because I didn’t have the ingredients on hand: used all beef, cilantro sub for parsley, and hard bread rolls that I softened with water. Shredded cheese instead of grated because no grater. The mixture was VERY moist so I only used 1 cup water. Should’ve reduced the oil too because my test batch was just sitting in excess oil; definitely had to blot with paper towels. 

Even though the outcome was oily, one bite and I was in heaven. Regretted that test batch only cooked 9 because it was snatched up in an instant by family. I freezed the rest of them for a future pasta night! Most delicious recipe

I tried this recipe recently and found it to be very disappointing.  I follow the recipe exactly- the only difference was that I baked the meatballs.  I was initially surprised by the amount of breadcrumbs and Romano cheese listed, but since this recipe got such rave reviews, I just went with it.  Overall the meatballs had a mushy consistency and the only real flavor was the overpowering Romano cheese.  I would find another recipe- this was simply just not very good.

I'm sure veal would have been great but here is what I used and they turned out great!  Ground beef, hot Italian sausage and ground turkey (I had all this already).  I didn't have bread so I used breadcrumbs but roughly half the amount to account for commercial bread crumbs (tiny) versus crumbled bread.  I did fry them in olive oil, just watch your heat originally, it has a lower heat point then other oils.  Once I got that down everything went smoothly!  I also used stacking cookie racks, lined them with paper towels and let them drain/rest there.  

I reserved some of the last of the mixture (I doubled it) to add some extra savory bits to some lasagna for Christmas! Yum!

Delicious! So easy to make, I change things up a bit, using homemade tomato sauce instead of water and various cheeses in addition to Parmesan. My favorite meatball recipe! You can also substitute meat if you like - it will still be fab if you loose the veal and use just beef, like I do.

Followed recipe to the letter plus added sautéed onions and garlic, I only used 3/4 cup water and my family loved it.

I make these regularly. Hint that I use, rather than water and bread crumbs, soak white bread without the crust in milk for a couple minutes. Makes them a little more moist.

Very good, veal makes a difference in texture and taste. I agree with other reviewers, I put 2 tsp salt and 1.5 tsp pepper, 1/2 c cheese and 1.5 c bread crumbs and 3 tsp garlic.  Just right spicey.  I also backed at 350 for 25 min.  Sorry there were so many variations but it was the best of both worlds.

Excellent!  Used regular bread with Italian seasonings and baked them to save on fat.  If you've never tried this combination of meats before, you should.  It's authentic Italian.

I'm gonna do all ya'll a favor.... Follow the recipe but brown the meatballs in olive oil in a cast iron skillet, remove from pan and turn the heat down. Add a small amount of butter and chopped garlic to the pan, cook for about a minute, re-add the meatballs, and place in oven at 350 until cooked all the way through. Mine didn't fall apart like other reviewers said. Definitely use real block grated cheese. I did place a few meatballs in simmering homemade marinara to finish cooking to test and much preferred the garlicy oven finished ones.

I only changed the recipe by putting them in the oven to cook and then made some homemade marinara where I put them to simmer for about 30 minutes longer.

Mediocre. This might pass muster in someplace like Utah or North Dakota, but no god-fearing Nona would feed this to her grandchildren. Better recipes abound.

I use 2lbs of ground beef instead of pork and veal.  I use Parmesan cheese instead of Romano.  I use Progresso Italian breadcrumbs.  I bake them at 400* for about 20 minutes.

Baked instead of cooking in oil on stovetop making recipe healthier. Reduced water by half so balls would stick together better. Small balls 15 min at 350 F

Followed the recipe to the T and it tasted great. The only thing I would modify is to add a little bit more of salt. Maybe next time I will measure it to know exactly how much salt is right.

Followed recipe to a T!
Changed the meats to alpo and added to ketchup instead of spaghetti sauce.
Fed to dog and called dominos!
Everyone loved it!

Love the recipe. I made these with a pound of turkey and a pound of pork the only thing I did different was bake the meatballs in the oven as another person suggested. I also used fresh parsley and my garden tomato sauce. Next time I will add the beef.

Simple, and amazing.  I used panko soaked in 1 c. milk instead of water but otherwise followed the recipe.  I pan fried half and oven baked the rest.  The pan fried were superior ~ by far.  Thank you for this fantastic recipe!

I made a mistake and put the oil into the meat mixture duh -- put the sauce together dropped the meatballs in and slow simmered.  They were really great!!!  No frying, quick n easy, didn't make a greasy sauce...just flavored.  Family  loved them.  Recipe on the side of the fridge.  Foolproof. Yum Yum.

Couldn't find my go-to meatball recipe recently but found this one and it looks really similar.  I was making really large meatballs to be cooked on the smoker, so I doubled the recipe from the get-go.  No intentional changes made ... I do think I only ended up using half the amount of breadcrumbs (2 cups for a double batch) -- we had company over while I was putting these together and I was distracted and didn't realize until afterwards that I think I'd forgotten to double the breadcrumbs amount.  However, I also noticed as I was working the mixture that I didn't need to add the water at all.  I think next time I make these I'll hold back half of the breadcrumbs and see how they come together and then add in the other half if or as needed along with any water.

Wow!  I have to admit I didn't believe this recipe could be "best ever" but I was gladly proven wrong.  Not sure what exactly is the magic, but I've been requested to make them again in a week's time.  They disappear quicker than any other meatballs I've ever made.  If you can't find ground veal, use turkey or bison or lamb.  That third meat type gives a great zing.

As somebody who loves to cook it was very tempting to deviate from the recipe and change it up the way I thought would be best. Let me tell you, do not change anything. These meat balls are now my go-to favorite. I watched Hancock the other night and really wanted to make a good meatballs... this is it!

I didn’t have the right cheese so I used shredded Parmesan cheese and I used beef broth instead of water. These are so yummy. I made meatball sandwiches, spaghetti & meatballs, meatball pizza. Every one was fantastic. Nice moist flavorful meatballs. Good bye hockey pucks, hello yummy meatballs! Thank you for his recipe

these are the"best" meatballs  didn't change a thing ,accept I use  plain Panko breadcrumbs makes it much easier to use that whole 1-1/4 cup of water. I also break out the old 10' black cast iron frying pan ...for the last step once the olive oil is hot, there is no sticking , and the cast iron gives the balls a great crust

Yummy recipe! I didn’t have the pork or veal but used ground beef and sage sausage, I thought it was amazing and the husband raves about them. I also baked mine rather than frying. I made 12 large balls and baked for 45 minutes at 350. Perfect!

This is the first time in a long time I made scratch meatballs and I have to report that I will never buy premade again. Thank you. I did however change a few things I used 1 pound beef 1 pound pork and 1/2 pound bulk natural sausage and parm cheese and I did bake them for 10 min before putting in sauce. Again thank you for a fabulously delicious recipe.

Delicious! The family loved them.  I ended up with 54 meatballs which was enough for dinner and then one package to go in the freezer for a future meal. 
One person doesn't like cheese and I didn't have any Romano on hand so I used about 1/4 cup fresh Parmesan because I figured I could get away with that and he would never know.  Our market doesn't normally have veal so I used more pork in place of the veal  I cooked them in the oven at 350 rather than frying in oil as it's my preferred method for meatballs.  Served them over rice with a mushroom gravy.  Will definitely make these again and again with various sauces.

Absolutely perfect!!! Easy to make and very delicious. This is the first time I made it and it turn out great. Only changes I made- I substituted water with milk and I added 1 small onion shredded and used only pork meat. Also, I deep fried them in the wok. Not to dry, not to moist...Perfectly seasoned...Really best meatballs.

I didn’t KNOW I liked spaghetti and meatballs until I tried these meatballs.  Amazing. I was at the river and didn’t have fresh parsley, so used Italian dried seasoning.  I had sausage and ground beef.  I also used suggestion of baking them instead of frying.  Every person eating this had a fit they were so good!!  I love Allrecipes!!!

These meatballs are amazing and so easy to make.  I usually use half the recipe and use a small ice cream scooper to make the meatballs. Gives me a good two two dozen a two least.  I bake them in the oven on a cookie sheet with a little olive oil for 20 minutes at 425, then finish in a pot of spaghetti sauce for about 10 Moreno minutes. Simple and delicious!!

I am 69 fellow and I love great Italian inspired food. 

 Living in the Great White North, outside of Toronto, Canada, a hearty meal suits us well. 

I modified the recipe a bit, added red pepper flakes, some other spices and minor made changes to cook it in my Instant Pot.  Turned out GREAT.  

I feel that this recipe and using the Instant pot, is simply fabulous.  I have cooked meatballs for year and these are my best yet

I opted to use my air fryer to brown the meatballs  instead of pan frying in oil. Very happy with that result. Then finished cooking them in the sauce.
This is a very easy recipe with a great result.
I made a few tweaks to my liking, like most of us will do.

Between using twice the amount of bread crumbs compared to any Recipe on the planet and the water I thought these came out terrible. Even if I made these wrong some how they still taste like biting into a slice of bread with all them bread crumbs lol, if you like that then this is perfect for you. I’ll stick to my family recipe.

I made these with an air fryer.  Just a little olive oil on the bottom,  shake at about 5 minutes to  roll them.  Cook another 5.  I used 350 degrees.  Perfect.

I made them with what I had on hand (1lb ground beef, parsley flakes instead of fresh, plain breadcrumbs, and parmesan instead of romano) and baked them instead and they turned out fantastic, I can't wait to try making them with the ingredients the recipe calls for!

Followed the advice of other reviewers and baked at 350 for 30 minutes. Delicious and very little mess compared to frying!

This is a great recipe as is but please bake them.  Much better.  I also have made a few modifications.  I use Backwoods Hot Italian sausage seasoning in the meat following the mix the have on the label.  They also have a mild mix as well if you prefer.  I also use parmesan and mozzarella cheeses.  I also sometimes add deli sliced pepperoncini and diced mushroom.  I make large meatballs so I cook at 350 for 55 minutes.  Great on spaghetti with a marinara of your choice, or simply straight up.

People aren't kidding: These meatballs are great! Changes I made/would make later: I added some Worcestershire sauce and paprika for tang, and also only used beef (our grocery store apparently doesn't carry ground pork or veal). I also baked it at 350 for 35 minutes on parchment paper (per someone else's suggestion), then simmered in a spicy marinara for another ten. A change I would make is to maybe cut down some of the breadcrumbs but that was a very minor thing. Everyone at the table ate about 7 or 8 big ones so I'd say it was a hit!

I make this at the fire station on a regular basis. It has become a huge favorite. I add a slight twist.
I finely chop a medium to large Portobello Mushroom and sautee it for a few minutes with 1 tbs butter until fragrant. I add this to the meatball mixture.
They add a good, earthy flavor.

Followed recipe as written, except we baked the meatballs on a rack over a baking pan.  40 minutes for 1/3 cup size meatballs.  Added to sauce for 15 minutes.

These are just fantastic.  I followed recipe as is except for baking them at 350 for 30 mins then put them in to simmer in some red sauce.  Be generous with the salt.

I didn't use veal but followed the rest of the recipe and this is officially my new meatball recipe...so tender and delicious. I rolled them in parmesan cheese before i fried them which gave them a nice crust.

Great family dinner but i didnt use the veal and pork and still got great results all round. 10/10
I suggest for a sauce use this website. Taste.com.au. (pasta with simple tomato sauce).
Even with one meat still makes heaps of meatballs and good to freeze for leftovers.

I followed the recipe it was so good and moist my kids weren't fans because of the cheese so next time I will not add it. But my husband and I couldn't stop eating them! And I didn't have veal so I doubled the pork and beef to make up for it. Recipe saved!

My kids loved it.  I've made it for my parents too so that I can leave them with a freezer full of food after I visit.  Its so convenient to have them on hand.  The only thing that I changed was to add about 1 t. of onion powder and I switched the water for about 1/2 c. of milk.  I baked them at 375 for 40 minutes and froze them in batches for easy use.

Very good.. whole family loved them!  I made a few changes based on reading other reviews. I cut the veal and used beef/pork only (all other ingredients as directed) then baked them on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet @ 350 degrees  for 35-40 min. Only thing I would change is a little less cheese.  Will definitely make again.

I made these meatballs over the weekend, and they were very good. However, I followed the recipe to a "T" and I think they were a little dry, and could have used some onions, or onion powder... next time I think  I will try to add some more water/milk, and some onion powder, BUT I will definitely use this recipe again.

Our family LOVES this recipe. I do make one adjustment--I soak the breadcrumbs in about 1/4c-1/2c (I'm not always a big measurer) of milk while I am getting the other ingredients ready. It makes them much more moist and brings out the flavor of the cheese.

Dont add the water, it really isnt necessary if you have decently fresh ground beef and your eggs are good sized. I used store bought bread crumbs (used 1 1/2 cups) and parmesan cheese (3/4) of cup since I had those on hand. Also used more garlic than was called for in the recipe since 2 cloves is a paltry amount for 2 lbs of meat. As written this recipe needs some tweaking to be great

I never had a good recipe for meatballs and the few times I made them they were dry hamburger balls. These were easy to make and delicious! I didn't make any changes to the recipe. I added them to my marinara sauce and simmered them for about 30 minutes. Best spaghetti ever. The recipe made twice what I needed for two people so I'm freezing the other half. I will be making them again!

This recipe is fine - nothing special.  Meatballs are lacking in flavor.  I followed it exactly except added a teaspoon or more of Italian seasoning, and also added extra garlic, and I still thought they were somewhat bland.  The only thing I did that was really different was just cook the meatballs in the sauce.  Started doing that years ago and they cook just fine if you put them in gently simmering sauce and it saves a step or two and saves on clean up as well.

We've made these meatballs twice now, and we LOVE them.  We have made a couple of minor changes, though.  First, unless you have a family of 8, half the recipe is more than enough.  Second, instead of the parsley, we use Italian seasoning.  Finally, instead of the bread, we use Italian flavored bread crumbs.  Yummy and moist!

Outstanding, wish I could give this recipe 15 stars!  :)   I baked mine for 10 mins at 325 in a convection oven, rather than frying them, then dropped in marinara sauce and cooked for another 10 mins. Stayed perfectly together.  Thanks for sharing!!

I don't use veal, I use 1 pound 93 percent hamburg 1 1/2 pounds and 1/2 pound lean ground pork.  Rather than add water to the meatballs, I use the sauce that I make prior to making the meatballs.  I don't bake or fry the meatballs, I put them in the already bubbling sauce.  I cook the meatballs in the bubbling sauce for about 15 minutes, reduce the heat and simmer everything for hours.   As far as the spices in the meatballs, I use a mixture of oregano, basil, thyme, and what ever else I have on hand.  People love my sauce and meatballs.   I improvise just as my grandparents off the boat from Italy.  Never measured, and used what was on hand.

I used one pound regular Jimmy Dean pork sausage in place of the 1/2 pound each of ground pork and veal, and baked instead of fried the meatballs.  They tasted so good.  I will definitely make them again.

This was delicious!  I did make some changes though since I had limited ingredients to work with.  I used turkey meat which worked well because there was very little grease.  I baked at 350 for 35 min or so as suggested by another reviewer.  I used a lot of minced and powdered garlic and some other seasonings I had on hand.  The water really helped hold it together which is something I've never added before.  Will definitely make again!

Pretty tasty! Though I didn't try the original recipe since I didn't have all the ingredients and we're on a budget so I couldn't go out and buy them! Instead I used all beef (just 1lb, so I edited the amount of the other ingredients as well), dried parsley (no fresh on hand today!), milk instead of water. The mixture seemed to wet when I made the first meatball, so I added more breadcrumbs (I make my own) and that did the trick. I just added the meatballs right to the sauce and simmered them in the sauce for 30 minutes. I'm planning to make a bigger batch and bake them in the oven so I can freeze them.

Made to specs.  Good meatballs.  IMO...too much breading.  Next time I'll use less.  I disagree with the suggestion of more cheese.

Fast, easy and delicious recipe.  I just used ground beef, and I'm not a big fan of paprika, so I cut the amount I used to half the recommended amount, but the meatballs still turned out great.  My wife and brother in law both opted for seconds.

Love these!! I've used beef and also a mix of Italian sausage (veal isn't easy to find where I live) and they've worked great. I used mozzarella one time and Parmesan another. It's GREAT as-is and easily changed without issue. I also prefer mine baked at 350 for about 45 minutes.

great meatballs.  I used day old homemade biscuits in place of bread crumbs i didnt have.  I used 1/2 milk and 1/2 water as another reviewer recommended and finally i rolled meat balls up and cooked in sauce.  This was so good and the changes i made were small.  I always add milk to my meatballs and meatloaf so this was a no-brainer.  Great recipe.

It was a hit. I used skim milk for water, and ground turkey for veal. Also had to make it gluten free. I use Whole Foods  365 Light White Gluten-free, and the grater disk of the Cuisinart to make bread crumbs. Fresh bread worked well. I think fresh grated cheese was a good tip. I baked them in a 350 degree oven. The convenience far outweighs the slight loss of roundness.

These were excellent!  Juicy and loved the flavor, different then the traditional meatball.  I am glad I took the time to use all 3 types of ground meat.  It was worth it.

I was really excited for this. Meatballs aren't something I do too often. These were wonderful, and I added a few personal tweaks. For the bread crumbs, I used fresh three cheese semolina bread, and I substituted the 1lb of ground beef for 1lb of bison. I also followed other reviews' suggestion and used milk instead of water. The meat is a tad sweeter in my opinion. Tonight's a busy night so I just used canned sauce but my oh my these meatballs were good!

I used this recipe to make mini meatball subs for Super Bowl.  I made two changes. I use parmesan cheese versus the Romano because that is what I had and I baked them. They were delicious. Will be making them again and again

This is definitely a special occasion dish. These are really decadent and rich. So, so, so delicious. I wouldn't recommend making these more than a few times a year, because you'll weigh about 500lbs if you eat this regularly.

I will definitely make these meatballs again! The added water makes them very moist and tender. I did not fry them, however, I baked them for 45 minutes on 350 and then I added them into my sauce. They came out perfectly and delicious.

Absolutely delicious!!!  If you can, DEFINITELY use 'stale' Italian bread, crumbled and soaked in 3/4 cup milk and squeeze out excess liquid and use Pecorino/Romano FRESH grated cheese too!  Omit the water as it is majorly unnecessary.  I don't fry I bake them like others as this is healthier and less mess.  I added a little fresh chopped tarragon (1/2 tsp) and some dried basil (1/2 tsp).  The BEST meatball recipe I have tried!  You won't be disappointed  - my dinner guests took home the recipe to make for themselves!

Finally I have made a meatball that is incredible.  I have searched for years and even my kids were like - Mom not your thing until last night.  Took advice from 2 other reviewers - chopped spinach instead of parsley and baked them 350 for 45 minutes on parchment paper.  Absolutely perfect.  I started to question myself with the water a little bit - I didn't know exactly how much but it is less than recommended.  I think that will be the only variable when I make these is getting used to what that texture should feel like.

These were pretty bland as is. I made 2 batches, one exactly to the recipe, and the other with additional herbs and spices (double the parsley, garlic powder, fresh basil, fresh sage, used milk ..etc).  It's a good base recipe but you need to add your families fav spices or you'll find it lacking in flavor. My hubby said "did you forget to put something in them?" It was still a decent meatball

Best. Meatballs. EVER. 
Seriously! I've made these at least two dozen times and they never disappoint.  I usually omit the veal, but the combo of pork and beef is just as delicious.  Everyone looks forward to this meal!

Awesome recipe!!! I used 1lb. Elk and 1lb. Ground turkey... followed the rest of the recipe to a "T".  Such a tender and flavor filled meatball!  Cheers!

Fantastic!!!  I substituted parsely with fresh basil. Also add a 1/4 cup of Parmesan in addition to the Romano. Instead of baking I fried them for a couple minutes and used the dripping in my spaghetti sauce :)

I love these meatballs; so does my family.  Some recipes you find you just know: this is a keeper!  (and you never try another)

I bake them as well:  350 for 40 min or so.  I have never had success at frying any meatball :(

I made these  as it was written.  They are AMAZING!  We had them on spaghetti last night but today I am eating them with crusty bread.  It made about 4 dozen golfball sized meatballs.  I fried them in a well seasoned and much loved cast iron pan and nothing stuck at all.  

Really - these are tremendous!

These are 'The Best Meatballs'!  I have made them a few times.  I do like them best when I use the beef. veal/pork combo. I also like to use milk instead of water and I will often add in 1/2 - 3/4 cup  of ricotta cheese in place of part of the milk.  Thanks for the awesome recipe.

I have made this recipe for years. I HAVE followed the recipe exactly many times. Ground veal is had to find at my grocery store. My husband & kids love these meatballs.  When I can not get veal I have substituted ground chicken, no one has ever noticed.  The reason for 4 stars not 5 is the meatballs don't hold their shape while frying and often break. I now bake them 30 to 35 minutes @ 375.  I prefer baking for the ease but pan frying produces a better texture.

These tasted amazing!  I wonder if they could go right in the oven instead of being pan fried.  It was a little time consuming, but well worth it.

These turned out perfectly! This was my first attempt at homemade meatballs and the frozen ones will not be coming back in my house again! I appreciated the reviewer's suggestion to use the cookie baking rack over a baking pan – it was perfect for keeping the three straining. If you live in Ohio or Pennsylvania, giant eagle market place has packages of meatloaf mix, which was the combination of ground veal, ground pork, and ground beef which made things just a

After having found and made this recipe, I now make the best meatballs out of anyone I know.  The combination of the three meats really pushes these meatballs to the head of the line.  I followed the recipe as written, for the most part, but did make a few minor substitutions.  First, I used parmesan cheese, the cheap stuff worked fine,  Then I used closer to three cloves of garlic rather than two.  I subbed store bought panko for the stale bread crumbs the recipe called for.  I only used on 1 cup of water, and I baked them at 350 for around a half hour instead of frying.  They were outstanding and the leftovers froze well.

I have been cooking as an adult, and Mom, for my family  for 22 years and I love it.  I came from a family who loves italian food but no secret family recipe for meatballs. So I, myself, have altered my meatball recipe over the years thinking I had the best one within the last 6 years or so.  I came across this recipe and followed it to a “T” except I do bake them....it’s just easier and I suppose healthier too.  These ARE the best meatballs EVER!!  I have served them to multiple people and even brought them as a heavy appetizer and people literally just can’t even help themselves from blurting out “OMG these are amazing”.  And they are. Not only that but so easy to make and love the ideas of freezing them to have on hand but they are easy to make  even in a pinch.  I use to simmer mine after baking to get them tender. I don’t have to do that with this recipe...they are just so full of flavor and so moist.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!!

This was my first time attempting homemade meatballs. I was pleased that they were easy and turned out better than store bought, flavorful and moist, but I don't think I'll make them again. I prefer denser meatballs and even though I barely used 3/4c, the cheese was still very overpowering to me.

I did some baked and some fried to taste the difference and both were good. I preferred the browning on the fried but the hands-free of the baked. I dunno, maybe I'll make them for a potluck some time. But for my own recipe box I'll keep looking--and leave out the cheese in any future attempts.

OMG, these are wonderful, was skeptical after reading some of the reviews, but decided to give it a try. I made a few changes:  I needed a an extra large batch, 1lb ground beef, 1lb mild Italian sausage, dried parsley, oregano, dried minced onions, black pepper and  ice water (NO SALT.)  Thanks for the tip on using croutons, brilliance!!  I froze mine for future use and will bake to use, but tested one sans sauce.  YUMMY!!

Wowzers!  These were great!  The only mods I made were doubling the garlic, only using 1 egg, and using crumbled garlic croutons instead of the bread.  Quick, simple and delicious!

They were delicious!  Tasted good, didn't fall apart and the taste was close to Italian cooking as I have ever managed to cook.  Everyone raved.  Thanks!

I made this with less than 1.5 water, and more to the suggested in recipe of the 1.25 cups of water.  I also did not have veal, but substituted with equivalent pork.  They were edible, but I have made better and I am not a chef nor Italian.  I usually bake meatballs from stuff I just throw together.  My kids ate them, but my ex-husband thought they were bland and I had to agree (which is a rare).  I think I might try again using milk & adding some onion/garlic powder. Btw, frying in batches was a lot of work.

Love these meatballs! First time I made it I followed the recipe exactly except used all ground beef. It was so good I started experimenting with it. Now when I make these instead of water I use chicken broth for extra flavor, only 1/2 cup of cheese and bread crumbs(trying to make it healthier), only one egg, and put in extra garlic. I also add some Worcestershire sauce, some Dijon mustard and I carmalized green peppers and onions and mix it all together and bake at 350. So good!!

I made the meatballs exactly as written. I have always been afraid of trying these little buggers because I just had no real experience or firm recipes. They turned out great. Don't change a thing.

Wonderful!  I have made many times, both following the recipe to the letter, and with my own alterations.  
Great either way.  Generally I will skip the veal and use 1.5 lb ground beef + 1lb Itialian sausage, Italian bread crumbs, milk instead of water, and I bake at 350 for 40 min in the oven (on a broiler pan).  Good stuff!

This is definitely my go to recipe for meatballs. So delicious! I actually use ground turkey or ground chicken, but they still taste great. I do fry them with a bit of olive oil to get them a bit brown on the outside first. Then I finish cooking them in the slow cooker with a bit of chicken broth. So juicy!

I use this quite often as a quick meal. They freeze great so you can have them ready to go. To make it slightly healthier, I use only Ground Turkey, A bit less cheese and as others have stated I bake them at 350 for approx. 30-35  minutes.

I used 1 cup Italian breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup water, and approx 3/4 cup milk. Used a 1/3c measuring cup to portion out each meatball...recipe made 19 meatballs in this manner. Lined a cookie sheet with foil, then put a double layer of parchment paper on top of the foil. Baked meatballs at 375 for 35-40 min then let them simmer in marinara for another hour. Delicious!!!

I am making this for the second time tonight.  Last time I reluctantly substituted ground turkey for the veal, because I couldn't find ground veal.  It was delicious, cheaper, and slightly more healthy.  So good in fact that I didn't even bother looking for veal for tonight's batch. 

No other substitutions, though I do make a quadruple batch and freeze them all.  Warming in sauce when serving works great.

Great meatball recipe. I'm giving 4 stars because I revised it enough that it wasn't the same. I followed other reviews and used 1/2 cup milk instead of water and Italian seasoned sausage . Since Im on a low carb diet, I replaced the breadcrumbs with pork rinds.  I baked the meatballs at 350 for 25 minutes then added to the gravy at a simmer for a couple hours. My family had on rolls that I covered with mozzarella  and melted in the oven before serving with shredded Romano cheese. I'll definitely make this again!

I can't say enough about this simple recipe. Geanine, it's all about the moisture. When I shaped the meatballs before cooking I thought they were so wet ... how would this every work? Well, it does and it's great!!!! I had huge compliments. Thanks for a great and easy recipe.

This is very close to our family recipe.  I used ground turkey in place of the veal just because that is what I had.  I believe the amount of water called for is more than you need.  I used completely dry Italian bread, crumbled and soaked in only 1 cup of water and the meat mixture was still very mushy making it a little difficult to roll into balls.  Next time i would probably cut the amount of water down even more.  I also browned them in a 475F oven instead of frying in oil. Then I added the meatballs to my already simmering pasta sauce and cooked for 2 hrs.  DELICIOUS.  i will use this recipe again.

l followed the recipe as directed and they tasted like store bought frozen meatballs. These meatballs are so bad that giving them to your animals would be animal cruelty. Will never make again. This is not a good recipe... at all.

These are great tasting meatballs for spaghetti and meatballs. I did what several others did and baked them for 45 minutes @ 350 degrees. I also added couple teaspoons of olive oil to the mixture and this kept them moist (did not add any water). Once they were cooked I dropped my balls into the sauce I was making as well (Grandma Maggio's Spaghetti Sauce). Turned out perfect. Topped off some homemade spaghetti and this made for an authentic Italian dinner.

This made 30 medium sized meatballs, the only thing I would want different is to bake them all at the same time instead of frying them if the same taste could be accomplished.

One more trick. Bake them in oil sprayed minni muffin pans. They hold their shape and they get real crispy on the outside from the fat! Oh, and roll them in bread crumbs prior to loading them in the pans. Yummy balls!!

These were great!
Veal wasn't available at the store, and I used romano and parmesan cheese, since that's all that was available as well.  
I followed other reviews and baked these instead of pan frying.  Baked at 350 for around 40 min.
These were a huge hit in my house, and I'll definitely be making them again!
Note: 2 lbs of meat made so many meatballs (around 50), so I formed half of them and put them in the freezer on a pan to cook another day!  Can't wait.

These really are the best meatballs and my go to every time I make them. The only thing I really do different is I do not typically cook with veal, so I use extra hamburger instead. I also do not ever have bread crumbs on hand, so I use old white or french bread crumbled up.

Definitely bake them on low as the comments suggest. I feel the texture is so much better when baked! Less mess, less falling apart.. perfect every time when baked.

I always make at least 2 batches, bake them all and freeze the extras in portions for quick dinners later!

Made this using a pound each of pork, veal and beef.  I used an additional egg and only about 1C of milk instead of water.  I baked them for 20 minutes on 325 and will freeze them.  They are very moist and have good flavor.  Next time I will probably play with them a little more to perfect the flavor.  Otherwise, this is a great recipe that I would recommend to others.

Thee BEST meatballs we've ever had!!! Takes a little extra preparation but well worth the effort.  I took ideas from other reviews and added a pinch of oregano, 1/2 tsp. Basil, used less cheese, added more bread or lower the water amt, added peppers and onions.

Yep.... These got a high five from my best and most honest critics, my kids. I too didn't fry but baked mine as many of the reviewers did and I did mine at 375 for 40 minutes.

I love Italian meatballs in pasta, subs, and broken up in pizza. This recipe was perfect. I used very good quality meats. Makes all the difference in flavor. 5 Stars.

Wow! What can I say. Excellent, but, and I'm sure the 'chef' who doesn't think we should review if we don't follow the recipe exactly will roll his eyes, I modified it based upon personal preference and comments.
I used 1/2 pork and half 80/20 hamburger CAB. Increased bread crumbs using half Panko and half progresso italian. Increased garlic to six cloves. Used half parsley and half cilantro. Baked 30min @ 375 turning half way through (the rack on a cookie sheet worked great).

excellent just like my Italian mother always makes. Only thing I would add is: the meatballs are better when rolled in bread crumbs before frying. I also like more garlic. Beware if you decide to bake it completely changes the flavor. Frying the meatball enhances the  garlic makes ALL the difference. Much better!!

Great recipe.  The only change I made was to combine the water and eggs and garlic in a bowl then add the seasonings, bread and cheese.  Mix thoroughly till combined and let it sit about 15-30 so dry ingredients can be thoroughly absorbed.  Then I mix in 1/3 of the meat followed by another 1/3 and finally the last 1/3.  This may seem like an unnecessary step but it assures a nice textured meatball and I do bake mine instead of fry.

First time making meatballs in my life (was not a staple at Mom's). They were very good, and they were approved for diner parties! ;-)

I smothered them in homemade Italian tomato sauce (made with with onions, garlic, whole tomatoes), and served alongside rice.

I made this recipe as chef Jimbulya said....not fried, but baked, and removed 1/2 the cheese and replaced it with bread. Worked just fine. I only used 1 cup of water, and baked for 30 minutes, as they seemed done by then.

This recipe is the best meatball recipe you can use. I come from an itallian family and I feel I know authentic itallian meatballs. It is the same recipe I use, my mother and grandmother used. There are so many meataball recipes out there with all kinds of other things added but if you want a real tasty itallian meatball use this recipe as is.

I made a couple of additions. Total of 3 cloves of minced Garlic and 3 TBSP grated Parmesan. I browned the meatballs in a skillet with EVOO then placed them on a rack and finished them off in the oven at 350F. They were excellent.

I made a Tomato Sauce to serve them with but that's another story.

This was an amazing recipe, even though I didn't have all the exact ingredients.  I used a cheese blend of Romano, Mozzarella, and Asiago.  Also, I used fresh ground venison. 
Also replaced the bread with Italian seasoned crumbs I bought.  Even with those changes, EVERYONE loved the meatballs.  They held together very well.  
I decided to brown them slightly in a fry pan, then added them in marinara sauce to finish cooking them.  It was amazing for pasta and meatball subs.  Thanks.

These are the worst meatballs I've ever made by far. Far too much bread and almost no flavor. Going back to my old recipe with sausage rather than pork and much less bread.

I use this recipe for both meatballs and meatloaf.  It doesn't last long if there are leftovers. For the meatloaf I mix bbq sauce with brown sugar and a little ketchup and it makes a yummy, sweet and savory glaze.

I didn't have any egg or Romano, but dang! These were good. Substituted Parmesan for the Romano. I don't know if I will try the egg next time or not since they turned out so well. My wife made me promise to save the recipe.

A good meatball though under seasoned for my taste.  We baked instead of fried and threw in a crockpot in sauce for an appetizer. Will try with more salt and pepper and maybe some onion or more garlic next time.

Great recipe!   I used store bought bread crumbs and grated cheese, just 1 cup each, and it came out great both times I've tried it. I also baked them in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes then lowered the temp to 350 until they were nice and crusty on the outside. Ingredients were perfect.

This is a solid meatball recipe.  I did add less cheese though, and to me it was still quite tasty.  And I used no where near the suggested amount of water...perhaps near 3/4 c before it started getting too wet.  And even with the decreased liquid, the meatballs came out very moist.  I just threw them in the crockpot with my sauce and let it cook on high for 2.5hrs.  I'm sure if I had used the combination of meats it would even be tastier, but husband only eats poultry, so I used ground turkey and it was delicious.

I'm so happy to see how many people enjoy this recipe as much as I do. I wanted to update a new method I use to cook my meatballs. Prepare the recipe and instead of deep frying them, bake them in a 375 degree oven until they are cooked through. Usually 15-20 minutes or so. I add them to my sauce after and they are just delicious and a little lighter without frying. Enjoy!

I've made several types of meatballs over the years, but for me this one has the perfect flavor profile of veal, beef, and pork. They also turn out very tender when baked. That said, I now use this as a base recipe and change a few things as my mood dictates. I bake them, not fry. I don't use water; I use a combination of broth (chix or beef) and/or a little organic 2% milk, probably 1/2 cup or so (organic is thicker and much tastier than regular 2%.) Also the amount of liquid vs breadcrumbs depends on the humidity and type of breadcrumbs you use. One needs to adjust it accordingly. The rule of thumb is that they should be very sticky and slightly sag and lose their shape after rolled into balls. This is so they bake up nice and tender. I throw all the ingedients into my Kitchenaid stand up mixer and it is so easy to combine. I also recently have started replacing some of the other meat with ground turkey (usually the pork or beef) to make it healthier, and it still is great. I also prefer parmesan to romano, which can sometimes make dishes taste salty and sharp.

Way, way too much bread crumbs, not enough cheese, nor parsley. Made these exactly following the recipe and found them to be very bland.  I will modify the recipe next time I make them and add a bit of onion and use the suggestion of others to use milk instead of water.

This recipe is the absolute best meatball recipe anywhere!  My entire family loves them and I no longer enjoy meatballs out at Italian restaurants.  They are that good!

I hate making meatballs,  but this recipe is so good,  I did not mind. I used beef and pork. Used half bread and half Italian bread crumbs. I fried them.

Used this recipe for my husband's birthday party.  All of his male friends from work came over.  They couldn't get enough!  One even asked me for the recipe telling me he would have his wife make it because the meatballs came out tender and moist.  I did modify it.  Some guests couldn't eat pork for religious reasons.  So I used 100% beef.  I tripled the (fresh) minced garlic and also added a finely diced medium sized onion.  Both garlic and onion were sauteed before adding them to the beef mixture.  I didn't have Romano cheese, but I had leftover mexican 3 cheese blend and italian parmesan.  Since both cheese had herbs and spices, I didn't add the parsley.  Also, I substituted beef broth for the water.  I pan seared these and then placed them in a covered pot with a bit of fat from the saute pan in the oven at 350F for 30 minutes.

Made this a week ago and then again today.  The first time I did it, I made a really stupid mistake, so I'll try and stop you from doing the same thing... This is ALMOST, but not quite a "throw everything in the bowl and mix" kind of recipe.  The olive oil at the end of the recipe is for frying the meatballs.  DUH!  It does NOT go in to the meat mixture.  I can't believe I didn't read the instructions any better than that.  I kept wondering why the mixture was so gooey, and I kept adding more and more bread crumbs!  My excuse is that I was having a really good conversation with my husband while we were cooking, so I was distracted!  LOL!

Bottom line, these will taste good either way, but if you follow the directions, you will enjoy the experience a lot more!

These were the most delishous meatballs I have ever made. They were moist and very flavorful. I made the recipe as written except like many others I baked them on a rack at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. I got 28 nice sized meatballs. A definite keeper.

I used store bought "Italian seasoned" bead crumbs instead of making my own. I thought it was pretty good, but my girlfriend said all she could taste was the breadcrumbs. I'm going to try this again, but I think I will cut the amount in half and see how it turns out.

These are the best meatballs, they are the only ones I make though I haven't used veal but one time.  I sub the veal for hot italian sausage.  They are the most tender flavorful melt in your mouth meatballs going.  I cook them in the marinara sauce that I make too.  Half of the recipe gets browned in a skillet and finished in the oven, the other half gets the skillet then finished in the sauce.  Dynamite

Quick and easy!  Skip the fry and just bake! Shape the balls no bigger than a golf ball, place on cookie sheet covered with parchment paper and bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees.  If you're making sauce on the stove, drop the cooked meatballs into your sauce!

Have made this meatball for years.  I would put in less cheese.  The amount of garlic is ok because you probably will cover the meatballs  or cook them in sauce (gravy) that has a bunch of garlic in it too.  I would bake them for 1/2 hour before I would ever fry them, easier.

This is "authentic Italian" ... I've been making them this way for over 30 years... I also have made them with ground turkey.. no one knew the difference. You can also bake them and use milk instead of water, tastes just as good.. try a cold meatball with sour cream.. yummy..

I have never used oregano in my meatballs nor did my grandmothers.. One Sicilian & one from Abruzzi..and they were amazing meatballs.. Very similar to this recipe.. The only "thing" I would say is use Locatelli cheese in the meatballs if you can( it's a brand of Romano) really good stuff! Thank you for sharing, Geanine!

I have made this recipe numerous times with three adjustments. Add 1/2 teaspoon each oregano, basil and garlic to mixture. Use milk in place of water and refuce to 3/4 cup. After rolling the meatballs, please on wire rack in baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees for 35 minutes.

I am Italian and this is the way I make mine, except I use warmed milk instead of water and mix the bread in it to blend before adding it to the meat.  Also instead of the cheese I use onions.  I bake them in the oven at 325 degrees for approximately 25 minutes just enough to brown them so they don't fall apart in my sauce.    I then drop them into my spaghetti sauce made from scratch to continue to cook.  They come out very moist and yummy.  I make my meatloaf the same way.

Excellent!!! I've tried a lot of different meatball recipes and have never found one that I really enjoyed until this one. The others usually had too much onions, spices weren't perfect, etc. Whatever the case. This is a GREAT easy to follow recipe. They came out very moist and everyone loved them. I used seasoned bread crumbs and fresh Parmesan and Romano cheeses and a little less water. Highly recommend!!

Very good, cheated and used canned parm cheese, dried parsley and dried bread crumbs.  A little too time consuming for what it is.  That is why I cheated, still very good.  And I only used half gr. beef and half sausage. It is the only way I make meatballs now.  :)

I enjoy this basic recipe for meatballs because I can be as creative as I like.  I use 80/20 beef instead of veal and pork.  Of course the fat from the meatballs has to be rendered.  These are very juicy and fall apart.

These meatballs have earned their title. They are the best meatballs I've ever made. Made exactly as recipe showed and will not need to search for another meatball recipe. These are perfect

OK, I may be the worst cook alive; can't make anything without a recipe.  That said, I cut this recipe down to 4 servings to use 1 lb of ground beef only; no pork, no veal.  This is the best meatball I have ever made!  I LOVE that it uses no onions too!  My son, who usually shies away from meatballs & is extremely picky put away 4 of them!  Thank you, thank you!

These turned out great.  I used half beef and half pork. I also only used about 3/4c. of water.  Finally, I only browned them in the pan before I added them to the sauce to finish off the cooking, but my kiddos ate firsts and seconds.  Highly recommend.

This is my go-to meatball recipe! It mimics a family members recipe with the lukewarm water! Even my kids eat them! I do all beef, just the way we like them and they turn out great!

Makes about 50 meatballs. So I 1/2 the recipe and just use 1 lb ground beef only. You still get 25 meatballs and they taste just about as good without the meat variety. Also, do not overcook, just turn them a lot. Use hot hot oil and be careful.

Favorite Italian style meatball recipe. I have cooked it with spaghetti sauce and it was amazing. 
I doubled the garlic amount and added some crushed red pepper to add some spice.

I'm rating this recipe a 5 even though I made some changes. First change I made was using half the amount of cheese, and using parmesan because that's what I had on hand. Then I used 1 cup milk and 1/4 cup water, letting the eggs and milk come up to room temp. Instead of veal and pork I used a lb of Italian sausage. I baked the meatballs at 400 for 25 mins, put them in sauce and simmered for a half hour. Turned out great! Perfect recipe to use as a guideline.

Just made these. I made some alterations per my personal tastes.  I replaced the water with milk, and used 1/2 romano and 1/2 parmesan (freshly grated).  I added some dried oregano and granulated garlic to the meat mixture. I baked these in the oven at 375 for about 30 minutes, then browned the tops under the broiler to crisp them up a bit. They're simmering in the sauce right now and the one I sampled was perfection! This is a good recipe to use as a base and I'm glad I found it.  Tender, moist and full of flavor. YUM!

I had forgotten how good it is to use the blend of the 3 meats.  I made a double batch and had some for meatball subs and some for spaghetti and meatballs.  They also froze great.  Love the use of romano, my personal favorite over parm.

Love this recipe! however, I don't add veal, just beef and lean pork. Its my go-to recipe for meatballs. I bake them at 350 for about 30 min, and freeze them after they've cooled. Meatballs on demand!

This is a delicious recipe, made exactly as stated and I doubled it for a family dinner. This is the second time I have made these. The first time I baked them on parchment paper ,lined cookie sheet , 350 for 45 mins. Then transferred to slower cooker and covered them with a marinara sauce for a potluck.  These freeze perfectly for a special occasion, just thaw and put in a slower cooker with a favourite sauce. I took them to a spring potluck and my sauce was BBQ & orange marmalade, these went well with potato salad, macaroni salad etc.

Made this several times and it's gotten rave reviews. I fiddled with the ingredients a little to make a smaller batch the last time and it came out even better. I think the secret to that was using a little more water as you see fit. I accidentally came up on this because I added what I thought was too much water but they came out so nice and moist I want to replicate that.

I followed the recipe and made half fried and the other half baked. I personally always fry my meatballs but since they were so flimsy when I fried these, I decided to make them both ways. The meatballs had too much grease on them from the oil in the pan. Ground beef is fatty enough that it shouldn't need it but in this recipe it is absolutely necessary if you expect them to resemble some sort of ball when frying. The water made the meatballs lack any real density and in return, taste. I like my meatballs to have a much heartier taste. I won't be making these again.

I roughly made one third the recipe it's just two of us. Just used ground beef and made it pretty much as written except I had dried parsley. It was quite delicious and very tender and moist. I think the trick is not to over cook the meatballs because they continue to cook in the sauce and the sauce moistens them. I coated a non-stick fry pan with olive oil and just cooked them over medium heat turning them once really, there was no sticking I'm guessing it's because I used nonstick and beef with 15% fat too lean beef will not be good in this recipe. I used Bertoli sauce which is sweet but very good. We inhaled our dinner, thanks.

The recipe is fantastic and incredibly simple to follow for someone like me that normally uses the smoke alarm as a timer. :-). However, they do tend to fall apart too easily - could it be that I used store-bought bread crumbs instead of the more rustic "crumbled stale Italian bread"?

These meatballs are the best I've tasted. Great recipe! Easy to make. I have been baking them in the oven only because I'm lazy and dont want to baby sit them in a skillet. ;) I have used hot pork sausage meat instead of ground pork for a little bite. Thanks for the recipe.

I make these quite often per the request of EVERYONE in the house, which includes two picky teen/tween boys! I leave out the veal but follow the rest of the ingredient list. These are absolutely delicious and are worth the time to make!

BEST.MEATBALLS.EVER! I didn't use the water and only had breadcrumbs, however I did pan fry the meatballs in the pot I made the homemade sauce in and it definitely makes the sauce taste much better! No as healthy, but better tasting! Even my VERY picky 8 year old devoured them!! Thanks for the recipe!! :)

Made these meatballs, and they were great! I was planning on meatball subs, and cut the recipe in half, but think I added too much breadcrumbs....so added the rest of the meat I had brought. 

The meatball subs were great....and I used the extra meatball mix, added some allspice and nutmeg, and will use them for swedish meatballs.

All said, this is a good, solid meatball recipe.

Have made many recipes from Allrecipes over the years and have made meatballs many, many times, so I decided why not try a meatball recipe from Allrecipes????   SO glad I did!!!!   This recipe is fantastic, for many different reasons.  Simple ingredients and few steps, in fact the only thing I did differently was bake instead of pan fry, just my preference for meatballs.  Baked at 325 for about 20-25 minutes, but I make large meatballs.  They are so flavorful and moist, perfect balance of meat/bread crumbs/garlic/cheese flavor!!!  You will not be sorry if you try this recipe!!!  Thank you Geanine!!!!

Never going back to pre-packaged! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe; today I tried it out -- I did everything, except I used beef, turkey and lamb; added the anise seed as one Reviewer suggested, doubled the recipe, and baked @ 325F, instead of fry. Can I say this is absolutely amazing?! I have 2qt and 2 gal sized freezer bags, full off the little balls of deliciousness. I used my cookie scoop, as I couldn't find my little meatballer tong, and it still turned out very well. Thank you again for sharing!

Baked the meat balls to cut out a lot of the fat. 
Did not use salt.

Best recipe!!! Have made these many times. They are my go to recipe....so easy and produces an amazing meatball. Followed recipe, just didnt fry them. Why stand over a stove frying when you can bake them 375 degrees for 20 min, then add to your sauce pot or freeze for future use. Fantastic recipe!!

great recipe! Followed recipe exactly except I baked the meatballs on foil sprayed with cooking oil at 350. I made cocktail size meatballs. Finished in 35 minutes. Husband LOVED them. Said they tasted just like his mother's and she came from Italy!

I wouldn't use the veal or pork as described (1/2 pound sounds like something a butcher's in a big city might have though) so I used the Italian Sausage in place of those two. I tried to make this recipe otherwise as described but since I have celiac disease, I had to use rice cereal crumbs instead of bread crumbs.  But using fresh parmesano and fresh parsley is definitely required!  Once you roll these and start cooking them on medium, let them sit in the pan and cook pretty well before you flip them.  I used tongs.  But the heat under the pan was uneven and some of the meatballs weren't supported and they just flopped into bits when I turned them.  I wonder if more bread crumbs would have helped.  After cooking them pretty well, and browning them on two or more sides, I threw them into simmering homemade spaghetti sauce.  The kids loved them, I loved them and I liked my necessary substitution :).

ETA: tried the 2 cups of GF bread crumbs today (my handmade Udi's crumbs) and there have never been more savory, soft, fluffy meat balls than these, though I merely coated them in oil, then cooked them for 30 mins. at 350 degrees.  I finished them in a loose sauce which I learned from a Sicilian immigrant, which is the perfect way to flavor and spice these delicious, succulent and savory creations.  Bravo!

I have made these meatballs numerous times. I used ground beef and pork, omitting the veal on principle.  I have substituted Parm for Romano in these amd they remained very tasty.  I did fry them once simply because I have not done that in years.  It made no difference to the taste when compared with the batch I baked. Keep this recipe!  Bad meatball recipes abound.  This is a treasure!

I followed the recipe to a T and I thought it was horrible. Very bland. Not sure if it's because I baked them but either way, I hated it. No flavor. And it made so many. Not sure what I'll do with them.

I use this with what ever meat I have handy.. even deer meat and ground meat. I bake the meatballs then add to the sauce later. Never use deer meat alone.. I always add beef.. gives it some fat for flavor and not the wild taste..

used 1 pd ground beef and a package of hot turkey italian sausage.  Very Good.
Made again, doubled the recipes using 2lbs gr beef, 1 lb veal and 1lb  hot italian sausage.  Used prepared italian breadcrumbs, next time use half of breadcrumbs suggested.

These came out great!  It was my first attempt at meatballs.  I didnt use veal as I dont know any stores that carry it.  I used regular breadcrumbs and italian seasoning since I didnt have parsley.  I baked the meatballs instead of frying them and left out the cheese due to allergy...they still came out great.  Also, just over two pounds of meat made over forty meatballs which is a great way to stretch out meat for guests or family.  I brought these to a potluck to great reviews.

Amazing recipe.  Light meatballs with a fantastic flavour.  I also baked rather than fry as I was cooking a big batch to freeze.  This will be my go to meatball recipe going forward.

The recipe as is, is very good. One change as some others have mentioned is to use milk instead of water, and nowhere near as much. Another change is in the method used to cook the meatballs. Bake them in the oven first and then brown them in a frying pan. This will give a much better browning on the outside than baking alone will and they will hold together much better than simply frying them.

I tried these the other week and they were incredible! My girlfriend's niece who won't eat anything that isn't cheap and prepackaged even loved them. I used Panko bread crumbs and far less oil. I am going to make them again today using a mix of veal and lamb to see how extra tasty they turn out.

Great Recipe. I use tomato sauce, I always have Rao's Marinara on my shelf (for when I am too lazy to make my own)and I substitute this for the water.  It brings out the flavor very well.  I also add onion powder, mustard (or mustard powder) and some parmesan as well... I bake them 40 minutes at 350....

This is the best meatball recipe I have tried! I have tried a lot of different meatballs in my life...but nothing compares to this one. I only had beef on hand, so I used 2 pounds of ground beef instead of it mixed with the pork and veal...it still tasted AMAZING...YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS RECIPE.

I actually had a good hunk of stale Italian bread at the time I found this recipe and a half pound of ground pork left over from a Bolognese sauce a week or two ago. Love it when a great recipe like this comes together. These meatballs could and probably will become my go-to for spaghetti dinner...

I use this recipe as a base and add my own style to it and they consistently make the BEST MEATBALLS EVER!!! Our family is grain free so our meat is more expensive, thus we just use ground beef because it's cheaper. I also replace the bread crumbs with toasted almond meal, saute some finely chopped onions and celery (this helps to add moisture since the texture is different when you use almond vs flour), and I also add fennel and paprika to the mix. I bake them low and slow on a rack over a cake pan so the fat all drips off of them, then kick the temp up for the last few minutes to brown them. SO YUMMY!

I thought these were good, but not "the best". My grandmother makes her meatballs, which I like a whole lot, with the three different meats so I expected that these WOULD be the best, but I found myself wishing I'd used all beef. I would have preferred garlic powder too I think because my little pieces of garlic didn't really 'cook' and I had semi-crunchy bits of strong garlic in some bites. I also used far less water. The texture of these was good, and they tasted good too, just not GREAT. I may make again with all beef and a couple other little tweaks.

Great job Geanine! Loved the basics. I relatively stuck to them. True to form, it got it done. I strongly agree with your recommendation of the mix of meat, fresh herbs, cheese, initial binders. They DO make a difference! 

I did take some culinary license, like some others, in regard to adding a bit of red onion, Worcestershire, Panko crumbs & stale bread. I also added 1/4 cup of Italian dressing in lieu of olive oil. I did bake the meatballs rather than fry them. Ping Pong size, 30 minutes at 350. I finished cooking meatballs in slow cooker on high, in basic red pasta sauce for about another hr.

I took them to our Super Bowl party and they flew out of my crockpot! It was not only cool that my team won, but I came home with an empty crockpot. Wow! I felt like I won the Lombardi trophy!  Thank you.

Exactly the way my Nonna, rest her soul, (mostly with ground beef, though) used to make them! These ARE the best meatballs ever. Neighbors always know when to visit when I start cooking them! Always make a huge batch, but I end up only having a few dozen left for the freezer!

I thought the recipe alone was a bit bland. I added onion, more parsley and Italian seasoning and the 2nd part was much better and got rave reviews. I also baked it in the oven at 375 instead of frying in the Olive oil.

Excellent! I only put them in the olive oil long enough for them to keep their shape, them put them in my sauce to simmer away for 3-4 hours. They were absolutely delicious! Will make these from now on when I don't want to spend all the time making my stuffed ones.! Oh BTW I only used 90/10 o/o lean ground beef to make these.

This was my first attempt at meatballs. I didn't have veal so I used beef and hot italian sausage. I used stale wheat bread instead of italian and it was STILL delicious!

This recipe is AMAZING!!! I have been looking for a great meatball recipe and this is it! The base of this recipe is wonderful - it has a great taste and texture. I will change a couple things to fit my family's taste next time though: buy the = parts meatloaf mix meat, use 1 1/2 c. bread crumbs, 3/4 c. water max, 1/4 tsp. onion powder.  I substituted Italian seasoning in place of Italian parsley. I used 1/2 tsp. dried minced garlic because that is what I had on hand; it turned out fine but I will use fresh next time. I baked 1 1/2" meatballs in the oven at 400'f instead of frying them.  I put them in for 30 minutes uncovered, checking temp at 20 min.  I added a dash of hot sauce to the red sauce when heating the balls and sauce up together..

So good! My modifications: 1 lb. ground beef & 1 lb. ground pork; chicken broth instead of water. Will make these again--in about a year. I think I've eaten 20 meatballs over the last five days.

Used 1/2 pork and 1/2 beef.  Else, used the rest of the ingredients as written.  Baked the meatballs for 45 minutes at 350.  These freeze very well.

I made this recipe on the fly last week and boy am I happy that I did! I have been trying to find a meatball recipe that reminds me of my grandmother's meatballs. This is the closet I've ever come. I halved the recipe and it made about 12 meatballs. I only had plain bread crumbs so I added a bunch of seasonings to make it "Italian." This was also the first time that I've fried meatballs, I loved the crunch on the outside. This will be my go to meatball recipe from now on.

I followed the recipe exactly and they literally fell apart in the pan. That would not have been a big deal by itself because I could have just made a bolognese sauce, but they were so bland that I had to add a ridiculous amount of salt to make them edible. Too bad.

This was great! I used less water but mine still fell apart a bit.  I saved all of my "mistake" pieces and tossed them into a scramble the next morning with tomatos, american cheese, potatos, and eggs.  My hubby claims it is the "best breakfast ever".

I had limited ingredients, but needed to do something with a leftover pound of ground turkey.  I used this recipe but used regular grated parmesan, and dried parsley flakes (but less), regular multi-grain bread for the crumbs, and obviously the ground turkey instead of the other meats.  Still came out tasting excellent:)!  Thanks for posting!

The title of this recipe says it all! I only made a few changes, I didnt use veal because my local store didnt have it, so i just doubled the beef. I added seasoned breadcrumbs instead (just the store bought ones), and i added a bit of Italian seasoning. Everyone loved these meatballs. They taste AMAZING! Great great recipe!

I halved this recipe since I'm cooking for two.  Next time I will make the full batch and freeze half.  These are not exact, but are close to the meatballs found in our local Italian places in North Central West Virginia.  I omitted the parsely because I didn't have any and used store bought grated Parmesan because that's what I had on hand.  I did not fry, I boiled them in water and then cooked them in sauce.  I use some of the water from the boil to add to my homeade sauce.  Definitely try this with all three meats - the results are worth it!

These were definitely the best meatballs I have ever made! My bf loved them.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly, except I used only beef and I didn't fry them, but instead baked in oven at 350 for about 30 minutes.  They felt slight too moist to me, I would do less water next time, probably only one cup instead of 1 1/2.  I also may try adding sauteed minced onions next time.

I only used beef instead of the three traditional meats, but still good. Very flavorful and freezes well.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe :) However, I have been using only ground turkey for years. They are healthier and still VERY tasty! My friends and family really enjoy them. Yum Yum!

Definitely the best meat balls i've ever cooked - i gave it 4 stars because even though frying is probably the tastiest method for prep'ing these, it is pretty time consuming and adds a lot of fat.  Next time i will broil them on each side, and then combine with the sauce.

UPDATE: GAVE A BAG OF FROZEN MB TO MY PARENTS. THEY USUALLY LIKE EVERYTHING I SEND THEIR WAY, BUT EVEN MY DAD DISLKIED THESE (HE THOUGHT THEY WERE TURKEY MB'S!!!). These were allright. They certainly are not my mother's MB's, but decent nonetheless. My mom cannot remember her recipe (she add. a dash of this & that) nor can she find her handwritten copy, so I guess I am stuck! Mom hasn't made her MB's in ages - and prob. won't  since my dad is now on a restricted diet (her "all beef" MB's are anything but healthy lol!), which is a darn shame. I'd certainly post her version if I had it. :-) I pretty much followed this to the ltr. w/ the except. of a few ch. I add. a sm. (finely) minced onion, used 1/2 Parm / 1/2 Romano cheese & subbed Italian bread crumbs for fresh bread b/c I didn't have the latter. I end. up dbl. everything (my store only sold indiv. pkg. of ea. meat - in 1 lb. increments) & only using 3 c. worth of breadcrumbs (which was plenty, IMHO) that I soaked in ~ 2 c. lukewarm milk. This made a TON of meatballs (I had to use 3 cookie sheets!!!). Made subs (sub rolls were Garlic Bread Fantastique recipe, also on this site), add. meatballs/sauce (MB baked at 375 deg. for 25 min., then popped into spaghetti sauce & warmed on the stove) & topped w/ shredded mozza. Broiled for a few min. to brown the cheese & viola - restaurant-quality subs! I still think these MB's are pretty bland (comp. to mom's), but that's just me. Chips were an easy side. Tx. Geanine. :-)

Not so good it seems. I don't eat meat,  but the NY boyfriend is a meat disposal, so I tried this out last night for him. He eats ANYTHING....except these meatballs. I followed the recipe exactly. His description was "ok but weird." That is as nice as he could be without hurting my feelings, and we both know it. This is the first time he hasn't cleaned his plate. I have a feeling he was put off by the veal since there is nothing weird about pork and beef. I won't make this again.

These were very tasty!  I used 2 lbs of turkey instead of all the meat and used maybe 1/2 cup of Romano cheese.  Instead of the 2 cups stale bread, I used 2 pieces of regular bread in the food processor and then I baked them in the oven instead of frying them in the oil.  They turned out very yummy!

This is a great recipe.  I made more than the original recipe, using 1.5 lbs. ground chuck, .75 lbs. ground veal and .75 lbs. ground pork, 3 eggs, 3 garlic cloves, 3 T. parsley, 1.5 cups of freshly grated romano and 3 cups of a combination of fresh bread crumbs and Progresso Italian bread crumbs.  I only needed 1 1/2 cups of water/whole milk.  I baked the 2 inch meatballs on parchment paper in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees, turning them after 25 minutes.  I then threw them into a saucepan with Marinara sauce for 15 minutes. The only issue I experienced was "oozing" cheeze while baking.  While it didn't affect the overal flavor, it made a little bit of a mess to clean up.    Overall a very tasty recipe.

I thought they turned out pretty good. Everyone seemed to really like them. I didn't fry them, as most of the reviews recommended, but otherwise I followed the recipe pretty exactly. I think next time I'll add more garlic, but otherwise they came out really well.

Oh my goodness - these were good.  I have never made meatballs from scratch - to be honest, it never occured to me to do it.  These were so easy.  I bought the beef/veal/pork mixture at Whole Foods and went from there.  I think mine were a bit too wet because I struggled to keep them together when I was cooking.  But I have to say they were so tender, I am not sure I'd do them differently.

I never made meatballs but this recipe worked so well. I used 1/2 lb each lean ground beef and Italian flavored sausage. I also used Italian flavored breadcrumbs that come in a canister. This made quite a bit so I froze about 3/4 after frying them...hopefully they'll be as good when we eat them next!

I made these for the first time tonight - and they were absolutely wonderful.  I substituted sweet sausage for the veal, and they came out beautifully.  The best news is that my husband, who has sworn for 25 years that he does not like meatballs, LOVED them!

This was a great recipe and the first time I had ever made homemade meatballs. I used equal parts hamburger and spicy italian sausage ( our local grocery store sells an aweseom homemade version). I also added some onion to the mixture. The water really did make a difference, b/c 2 cups of breadcrumbs is a lot! I made some in a skillet on the stove top and baked the rest in the oven at 325 for about 45 minutes. They were so delicious and had a nice kick to them. For the ones I made in the skillet I added diced italian tomatoes and a small can of italian herbed tomato paste. We used them for meatball subs. Terrific. I froze the oven baked meatballs for future dinners. I will make these again!

Too much mixing makes the balls mushy.  Way too much bread crumbs and water.  Cut them both back.  otherwise these are tasty if you really spice em up.

These meatballs were absolutely perfect.  I followed the recipe exactly, except I had to substitute ground lamb for the veal.  I couldn't find ground veal.  The meatballs had a great texture and flavour.  After baking, I decided to simmer the meatballs in some tomato sauce.  The sauce tasted better afterward.

I am SO HAPPY that I found a recipe that I have lost 5 years ago! The recipe was very similar to this one, though it called for Asiago cheese (1 cup), and 1 cup of Parmesan reggiano. For meat, I used 80/20 ground beef, pork and sausage. I love this, and I'm sure hubby will be asking me to make this more often!

very well done! I saved the rest of these and froze them. They are very easy to throw into marinara next time I need them. No changes suggested.

These went over well during our Christmas party.  I cooked the meatballs on my BBQ grill to eliminate having to cook them in oil and bother with paper towels and grease.

I could not find ground veal.  So, I substituted ground lamb instead.  I used milk instead of water for moisture.  They were really good.  Although the lamb did have a strong flavor.  This recipe makes a lot of meatballs.  So, after browning I froze some for future use.  I did brown mine, but no way do you need 1 cup of oil.  Just lightly coat a non-stick fry pan and brown.  Then just pop in sauce for about 30 minutes to continue cooking.

These are truly fabulous meatballs.  I made them last night for a big family dinner, and they were devoured by everyone.  I was skeptical of adding water to the meat, but it came out great.  Make these, and enjoy all the compliments!

Love this recipe.  Have made it many times.  However, my husband and I are now making an effort to eat less beef.  Today I made this recipe with ground white turkey.  Gotta say I was skeptical, but they were delicious.  Just sprayed a non-stick skillet with olive oil and browned them before adding to sauce.  Delicious!

Delicious!  I halved the recipe and didn't use veal.  Used milk vs. water but will try water next time.  Also, just dropped them into my simmering sauce.  Yummy!

Great recipe. I always wondered what my meatballs were lacking!!! Warm water is key!!! We don't eat veal in our house so I used ground beef and pork. Fabulous...

I used all ground beef and prepackaged breadcrumbs (about a half cup less).  It made SO MANY meatballs, great for a big family dinner.  However, it was just me and my boyfriend eating them... he loved them as much as I did!

I used all lean ground turkey and this was great.  I used 1/2 cup of regular parsley as well as cilantro.  I think next time I will make a 'spicy' batch and add sweet and sour chili sauce.  This is for sure a keeper!

I thought the flavor was good, but I used a reduced amount of italian bread crumbs instead of fresh bread crumbs and my husband thought it tasted like cardboard.  Maybe the bread crumbs really do make the recipe.  It makes a ton - so I froze quite a few and will serve again later.

These are better than my mom's recipe. I used lamb mince instead of the veal and sharp cheddar instead of Romano- I live in New Zealand and it is easier to come by. They really are fantastic.

Best meatballs I ever tasted!  Used italian breadcrumbs and skipped the salt pepper.  They were moist and addicting!  I usually don't like meatballs but I'm going to be making these more often.

I made these meatballs last night, and we enjoyed them.  The recipe is a good starting point, but I will play around with it when I make them in the future.  They weren't so heavily spiced that they would overwhelm any particular sauce, which is nice, since I froze them without any sauce so I could use them in different recipes.  However, I will probably experiment with adding more seasonings in the future.  I browned mine on the stove and finished them in the oven.

These meatballs reminded me of the way my great grandmother's use to taste.  I really enjoyed them.  They are better than any restaurant meatballs that I have ordered.  
The listed serving must be incorrect.  I got 30 good-sized meatballs out of this recipe.

Im not a big meatball fan because no one can seem to make them right, but these were great.  The only meat I chose to use was the beef and replaced the stale bread with Italian style bread crumbs then added extra garlic...delicious!

I made this recipe and thought it was very good.  My 5 yr old picky son enjoyed it as well as my teenage dtr.  My husband thought it was like his grandmother's recipe.  The only thing I would change is the time it took a little longer to make/cook than usual.  It made plenty, enough to freeze for later!

These were very easy to make and came out delicious.  The only substitution I made was to use regular breadcrumbs instead of making my own.  They came out a little too dense for my taste, so I think next time I will add a bit more breadcrumbs.  The flavor was awesome.

Fantastic!  I made these exactly as the recipe asked (aside from using 1 tsp. of dried parsley instead of fresh, and despite the fact that my combination of meat was a third of each- no more beef than veal or pork) and they were absolutely delicious.  As my boyfriend said, "This one's going in the vault."  I wouldn't change a thing.

This is a great recipe. I use beef, turkey, and ground italian sausage.  I double the recipe and baked the meatballs, then freeze them in freezer bags for quick meals.  I use them in everything and it is easy to pop out a few for a quick meal.  My kids love them in BBQ sauce.

My husband and 9 yr old son loved these.  I didn't use the meat mix, but instead used the Italian sausage I had on hand (that I can't eat due to the additives).  I did fry them in a skillet due to time constraints, but next time will bake them in the oven.

I finally found a traditional style Italian meatball recipe that taste wonderful.  I normally would throw together nonspecific amounts of ingredients to make my meatballs thus making them taste a little different each time I made them.  This one is a keeper.  I used ground beef only and substituted ½ cup of milk instead of water.  I make these often!

Not bad. They tasted like they needed more seasoning although I couldn't quite figure out which one. Also, I baked the meatballs instead of frying them in a pan. I also added some grated parmesan.

i thought this was pretty good! i ended up just using the meatloaf mix from the grocer because i couldn't find ground pork OR veal alone. i also just eyeballed the seasonings, but next time will add some paprika and a pinch of red pepper. i also used less breadcrumbs than called for, no water, a TBL of olive oil in the mix and then baked for about 15 mins at 350. i promptly then moved them into the sauce that i was making. very tasty, indeed!

Extremely delicious recipe! Used ground beef and pork, parmesian cheese, and bread crumbs as other reviews suggested.  My boyfriend and I ate these meatballs 3 times in one week!  We ate them with hoagie/sub rolls and loved every bite! Great recipe!

First time making meat balls.  Very good!  Very easy.  Makes enough to freeze some.  I baked some and fried some; then I added them to Meaty Spaghetti Sauce by Stacey (great combo)!  Next time, I think I will try to brown the meatballs in a small amt of oil or in water; although meatballs might loose shape if browned in water, they won't be as greasy.  I will definitely be making these again!

The perfect meatballs...we really loved these.  I made spaghetti for myself and my husband had a meatball sub.  Only change I made was to add a bit of oregano along with the parsley.

I made a few changes to the recipe. The biggest was using turkey meat.  I also had to use breadcrumbs and parm cheese.  The meatballs were the consistency that I liked, however my husband could not get over the turkey taste. he said would be a 5 star if I used the right meat.  I also put them on a cookie sheet in the oven before putting them in marinara.  b/c they were turkey, there was no fat anyway.  I will def try again with grounb beef!

Excellent! These are so moist. Everyone in the family loved them. Made meatball subs for dinner the next day with the leftovers.
