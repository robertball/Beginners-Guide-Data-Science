I totally altered this recipe. My mother used to mix just the beans and hot dogs but I knew I wanted to add something else. I mixed all the ingredients except onion because I didn't have any into a casserole dish and I microwaved it til cooked through. I served it with brown bread. I really liked it with the applesauce and mustard. It gave it a sweet and sour taste. I gave it four stars because I'm not fond of hotdogs but the kids liked it. Very good.

My five year old said yum! five times which rarely happens. I mixed up a box of Jiffy corn bread mix and put that on top of the beans THEN layed shredded pizza blend cheese on the top of that and mixed it into the cornbread just barely. Forty minutes and it made a casserole that fed three with leftovers. Very easy weeknight meal.

This was really good!! I altered it a bit though. I added brown sugar and diced bacon and omitted the onion and ginger because I didn't have any. I was pleasantly surprised though in how well this came out and will be making this again!!

I highly recommend using Bush's Steakhouse beans with this meal. The flavors all end up complimenting each other really well.

This was a wonderful and quick dinner to fix. My family loved it and it was a great quick fix after the football game ended.

I really liked this recipe. I was super excited for the kids to try it. However none of my three kids or husband liked it at all! I thought it had great flavor but ended up throwing most of it away unfortunatley.

This one has too much going on in it. The cheese and mustard flavors seemed out of place. Applesauce made it runny. Son picked out hot dogs and husband could hardly eat.

Made it for the first time tonight while suffering from a Beanie-Weenie craving and it was good! I used turkey franks and left the cheese off to bring the fat down and dried onions instead of fresh since that's what I had. It did turn out soupy however so I think next time I will make it on the stovetop and let it cook down a bit - that's the reason for the 4 instead of 5 stars.

Not sure if I will make this again. I got this recipe for my 10 y.o. son and he did not like it at all. He threw his away. But I on the other hand who doesnt even like beans thought it was really good. The jury is still out but its not a bad meal just not great. I also made it with the applesauce cornbread on this site. Cornbread was great.

Really good without any modifications needed. It can be adjusted to personal taste as well without any major changes in preparation or cooking time. I served it with cornbread casserole and they were amazing together.

I liked it my boys didn't. I did things a little differently- I sauteed a whole small onion along with two large cloves of garlic until tender then added the thinly sliced hot dogs. Cooked until all was lightly browned then took it off the heat. For the sauce/bean portion I used one regular sized can of original recipe beans with pork 3/4 cup homemade chai spiced applesauce 1 tablespoon each Dijon style mustard/ketchup/maple bbq sauce and a little liquid smoke. Whisked it all up then stirred in the hot dog/onion/garlic mixture. Topped with cheese. I likely won't make this again since I'm the only one who will eat it;) But if there were a next time I wouldn't use the bbq sauce liquid smoke or cheese. I'd keep the rest as I mentioned the same. Served with cornbread muffins.

I wanted to try a new beans and franks recipe just because I had some apple sauce kicking around I wanted to use up and I'm very sorry I did. My whole family hated it including my little boy.. I followed this recipe except for the onion...which is good cause I just would have wasted a 1/4 cup of onion too. It's safe to say I'll stick to my old fashioned beans and franks recipe. =)

I have some room mates that insist on eating like kids. This has great taste compared to the regular franks and beans. Easy to make and very quick. Great for lunch or snack. I will make this again.

Served it to my family and noticed that everyone left some on their plate...not a good sign. I thought it was ok but wouldn't make again.

I did not care for this recipe. I could taste each ingredient nothing blended together like I thought it would.

This was O.K. It did not taste much different from the beans and franks that I make on the stove top with franks beans barbeque and hot sauce. I like the idea of adding mustard to it though but the frying the hot dogs before hand just seemed like extra work to me.
