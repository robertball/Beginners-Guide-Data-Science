This was yummy.  I like things less sweet so I did not add sugar to the tea mix itself.  I just used a some of the syrup from the bubbles to sweeten.   I used the instant boba and cooking time was much shorter per package directions.  This was significantly  cheaper than going to a bubble tea shop. I will make this often.

Absolutely delicious. The method in this recipe works perfectly. The coconut cream really gives it body. Keep leftover pearls in the fridge. Thank you for the recipe.
