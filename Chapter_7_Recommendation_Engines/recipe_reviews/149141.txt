Wow, this was great.  I was craving a soup like the Butternut Squash soup at Bruegger's Bagels.  I think this outdoes theirs.  I admit I did make a few changes/additions.  I used a sweet potato for the regular potato, apple cider for the wine and added a dash of ginger and cumin.  Oh, and I used a Honeycrisp apple (very similar to Granny Smith but not quite as tart) instead of the Granny Smith.  I will definitely be making this one again.  A tip for handling the butternut squash-microwave whole for a few minutes, let cool then cut in quarters, seed, peel and cube.

I made this soup, leaving out the cream & using a hand-held blender.  It was awesome!  I made another recipe the next week & was so dissapointed that I had to find this again & write a review.  The apple & carrots are the key to making this soup tasty and hearty.

Great base - experiment with spices how you like.  Can substitute apple cider vinegar for wine. 

Cinnamon is a great fit, with the apples & the squash.. as are nutmeg and ground cloves.  Tastes better after a few days.  I make ahead and freeze in jars to take to work :)

Perfect soup! A balance of tangy and mellow, sweet and savory , comforting, fresh, and wholesome. The only changes I made were to add a little celery that needed to be used, used heavy cream because that's what I've got, and to leave a little texture when I pureed it.. Garnished with beaten heavy cream and chives. Perfect, perfect, perfect. THANKS!

Love this soup.  I've made it several times in the last few weeks.  I used canned pumpkin in place of the squash to save on some time. I also never ever have leeks on hand so I used regular onions.  Used butter substitute and fat free half and half.  No need for the extra fat.  This soup does not need it. I've also given it a few shakes of sage,thyme,rosemary and black pepper in addition to the nutmeg.  Awesome soup.  Just made it again tonight and added about 1 tspn of chopped fresh ginger just to give it some kick.  It was super.  Topped it with fat free sour cream and some homemade croutons (recipe from this site) Thanks for sharing !

This was delicious, though I did not follow the recipe to a T.  I was hoping to not add the cream (lactose intolerant) so I tried it before adding--delicious without it!  This was a family hit.

We loved this soup. I followed the suggestion of using a sweet potato rather than white potato and liked that idea. Lazy me also used vegetable bouillon powder to make the stock. And I omitted the cream and didn't miss it. Will definitely add this to our list of favorite soups.

I LOVE this recipe. My picky 7 and 2 yr olds eat this up like there is no tomorrow.

I bake the squash in the oven with olive oil and salt and pepper (cut in half). When I pull that out, i start putting the soup together, i add the squash last by just scouping it out of the outer peel and right into the pot. SUPER EASY

I will definately be making this regularly

Mmmmm, this soup is good!  I made the recipe pretty much as directed.  The only changes were that I used roasted butternut squash I had made the day before, and I added @ 2 tsp of light brown sugar. I will definitely be making this one again!

Excellent soup!  Very quick and easy to put together.  I pureed mine smooth (no chunks, kids will pick them out) and it's so comforting and filling!  I didn't add the optional wine. THX

So good. Didn't add the wine though, just added more stock. Next time i may try adding apple juice to substitute the wine.

We really enjoyed this soup. I've tried other butternut squash soup recipes before and have never been happy with them. I'll hang on to this one for sure but I'm only giving it 4 stars because of the changes I made. I left out the leeks because I didn't have them on hand. I used and entire small squash which turned out to be 3+ cups. I used a Fuji apple because it's what I had. I used a tablespoon or so of apple cider vinegar in place of the wine (per other reviewers recommendation). I added just a dash of nutmeg and several dashes of cinnamon along with a pinch of cayenne pepper for a little dimension. Then the major change I made was LEAVE OUT THE CREAM! I'm sure it's very tasty with it. But I'm trying to eliminate some post-baby fat and this soup does NOT need the extra fat if it suits you to leave it out. It's delicious without it.

This recipe was great! My husband even liked it and he is not a big soup fan. I thought I had bought a Granny Smith apple but it never made it home. I used a Gala apple instead as that was what I had on hand. I still think it turned out awesome. Not sure what difference the GS apple would have made. I will defiantly make this soup again.

Wonderful recipe, exactly what I was hoping for from a squash soup. I used a whole butternut squash (probably an extra cup) - no reason to waste! Based on some reviews, I used a sweet potato and added 2T brown sugar and 1t cinnamon. I (shockingly) didn't have any white wine in the house, so I used apple cider vinegar instead of the wine - word of caution: you do NOT need 1/4 cup of vinegar! 1T or 2T would be plenty. It didn't ruin the soup, but it was a tad zingier than I planned. I used the cream - for the amount you're adding to such a large pot, it doesn't make the fat content go through the roof, and adds extra depth. Pleased even the skeptics in the group. Making it again for Thanksgiving Eve!

I thought this was going to be a fantastic soup, but it was super bland and not flavorful at all. I agree with some other reviewers on those counts. I followed the recipe exactly, without the optional wine. It was so bland what after we tried it, we went back and added a lot more things like cinnamon, cloves, more salt, just trying to get it to taste great but it still is just a very bland soup.  I very much prefer the Creamy Butternut Squash with Cinnamon Soup from this site. NO comparison!!

This soup is awesome!  I made some adjustments, mainly because it's what I had on hand.  I did not have leeks so I used some extra onion.  I used gala apples (what I had).  I didn't add the white wine.  I also chose to leave the skin on the potato and apples and to skip the cream to make it a bit healthier.  Once you blend the soup, the skins just get nicely mixed in!  
The soup smells heavenly while it's cooking and makes a great fall meal!

I roasted the squash, carrots, apples and onions along with some sweet potatoes (which I sub'd for the white potato) I think the roasting intensifies the flavor.  Delicious soup.

Would give it 10 stars if I could. Absolutely perfect! I added celery, but otherwise followed recipe to a tee. It also freezes well, which is wonderful when you're cooking for two. Great with a loaf of crunchy hot bread. I've also used it as an appetizer by serving it in little shot glasses (you can get them at a dollar store in packages of four) - put them on a silver tray -always impresses! Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

Have made exactly to recipe for the third time.  Totally, completely awesome.  This time, I used the butternut sqash cut up in packages in the product section of the supermarket.  Every bit as good and saves a ton of time.  Thank you, cynjne for sharing this.

A delicious fall soup! I added cloves, ginger and cinnamon (1/2 tsp each) to enhance the the apple flavour. My husband isn't a soup person, but this soup might have changed his mind.

My family and I loved this soup.  I did take the suggestion of others and baked the butternut squash in the oven whole for 1 1/2 hours at 400 degrees. It was so easy to peel the skin off, scoop the seeds out and puree with the rest of the soup.  I added 1/2 cup of milk instead of cream.  It is such a nice warm hearty soup, perfect for cold and rainy days.  Thanks for the recipe!  It is a keeper for our family!

I have made Butternut Squash soup before so when I read this recipe I thought the addition of apple and potato sounded interesting. I used 2 medium butternut squash,cut them in half and scored the fleshy part, added Splenda brown sugar, cinnamon, bit of butter, salt and pepper, and,then roasted it in the oven at 400 degrees for 40 minutes. When they were done, I took the skin off, and cubed the squash for the soup.  I followed the recipe for the rest of the ingredients, using the immersion blender to puree it.  It was wonderful and our house smelled like autumn! My very picky daughter ate 3 bowls!  Thanks for the recipe.

I don't think that my review actually counts 'cos I made so many changes. I swapped the potato for a sweet potato and roasted the pumpkin, sweet potato, apple and the onion. I like warm spices in my pumpkin soup, so I added nutmeg, allspice, ginger and cinnamon. Instead of cream, I added approx 1/2 a cup of coconut cream. SO good! Maybe I should post my own recipe...

I loved this!  High in fiber and great taste!!!  Wonderful fall soup.  It did come out thick which was bothersome to my husband but didn't bother me at all.  For his, I thinned it out with a little white wine and water.

I loved this soup!  I followed the recipe as is, except I didn't blend the entire soup, but like someone else suggested, blended 3/4 and left the rest chunky.  I also added some rice.  I would definitely make this recipe again!  Yum!

Perfect!!! Based on other comments I added a few spoons heavy cream, ground cloves, salt and ground black pepper. Just one pumpkin made a a large amount of soup that I put in several small containers and put in the freezer. You can later defrost in the microwave, put on the stove for a few minutes and add a few spoons of heavy cream. It makes a perfect meal, either as a side dish or by itself. To me, this is healthy and yet tasteful eating, I know what's in the soup and it is very inexpensive.

Turned out perfect in every way.  Used one less leek and a bit more onion, plus added some cinnamon and ground cloves to the final product.  One of the best soups I've ever made, thanks for the recipe!

Everyone loved this soup. It's flavorful, creamy and wasn't all that difficult to make. I added a bit more squash, and a bit less carrot ... and it was yummy!

This soup is simple,elegant and perfect for a cool fall evening. The only thing missing in the recipe as printed is a fair amount of salt. Also, to add depth of flavor and some more savory-ness to the soup, I added about a cup of beef stock. That may help those of you who had trouble with a 'too mellow' flavor.

Fabulous! I made this for 1 person, adding 1/2 an apple instead of a 1/4. I'm not a fan of soup but this was delicious.

Missing the smell of fall already? This is perfect for a fall evening, hearty and delicious. Made a few minor changes based on reviews; added a dash of ginger and cumin, omitted the cream for allergy reasons, and used the blender to puree. Doubled the recipe and had quite a bit to share with Grandparents and neighbors. Thank you for a wonderful recipe, will be sure to keep on cooking it over and over again!

EXCELLENT! It tastes like a an expensive gourmet soup. Rich, but not heavy. I went a little less on the cream and didn't have an onion at the time and it still turned out excellent. I like the but of white wine in there a lot. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants to impress some guests with an incredible soup!

Delicious dish! First time trying it and it went very well!! I only wish the proper salt and pepper amounts would have been given, just because I was unsure of how much to put. But overall, GREAT flavor and what amazing health benefits in one dish!

I do admit I hated chopping all the ingredients up. This soup was really very good and I am glad I made it. I do think it needed just a bit more flavor but not sure what to add season wise. I will definately make this again.

I don't care for chives, so I didn't put them on top and I think it needs something to add flavor to the soup.  I did freeze half, so when I thaw it, I'm going to top it with green onions and chili&lime pumpkin seeds.  I think it would add a lot of flavor to (kind of) a bland soup.  Overall, I do think it's worth your time to make it, I would just add something with a little bit of kick (to your liking).  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  It's a nice base.

Awesome.  Used a food processor instead of a blender, so it was a little "chunkier"; which I actually like.  Also didn't use the wine, as others have said.  Also, was reading other reviews:  I NEVER try to cut/peel raw winter squash.  I poke a few holes with a knife and stick it in the oven for a while until it is softer--time depends on size of squash.  THEN, I cut it open/ peel/ cube/etc.

After trying several of these squash soup recipes, I think I've found my winner!  Following the advice of some of the other reviewers I used sweet potatoes, substituted frozen squash for the fresh and added apple juice instead of the wine - it was AWESOME!  I also added a couple of shakes of cinnamon and ginger to accent the "sweet" in the soup.  I threw everything in my crockpot on high for the day and then used my hand blender to puree it right in the pot.  Again, AWESOME!  Thank you cynjne for a great soup!

It was easier than I thought it would be. The hardest part was just peeling and cutting the squash but there are methods for that. My fiance and I loved it with some French bread. It was so delicious and filling!

Quite delicious, even without the cream. The amount of squash called for didn't seem like enough, but I trusted the recipe and it was fine. The wine I used was too sweet I think, so make sure it really is dry if you use it, which I don't think you need to, really. Definitely a fall hit.

Very traditional tasting soup with all the flavors of fall!  I did a few things different though.  I used both a baking potato and a sweet potato.  I also used veggie broth and not chicken.  I increased the squash by about 3/4 cup as well.   I got a large squash, which was WAY too much.  I would reccomend (unless you want left over squash) to pick the smallest squash you can find!   I cooked it all and froze half of it.  Even using the half squash, there was still more than called for in this recipe, so I added more to it.  I think this ended up being a good thing as it made the soup thicker.   Even this made a very large pot of soup.  I ended up freezing half of the soup as well, which thawed and heated tasted just as good as the first time!  I will make this again.

Instead of using butter to saute the vegetables I used vegetable oil. What I like about this soup is that even if you don't have all the ingredients it comes out great.  I did not have on hand, the leeks and the cream so I left those out.  Once the veggies have cooked I do like cooling the soup before pureeing using my stick mixer. Use the pulsing motion to avoid splattering.  Once the soup was pureed, I did add 1 cup apple cider.  Using ready cut up butternut squash from the store saves a lot of time and energy.

Every time we make this soup I remember how wonderful it is.  We cook our squash a little in the microwave to speed up the cooking time, use a sweet potato and apple cider as recommended by others.  We have yet to make it with the cream because it is yummy without it.

This recipe was labor intensive, but on a cold, rainy, fall day it was a labor of love to feed to my family.  None of us had EVER had butternut squash, so it was a delicious way of introduction.  I followed a reviewer suggestion and roasted the butternut squash first and had to stop myself from eating it all out of the pan by itself!  Thanks for the recipe and the reviews as well:)

Everyone loved this soup! We modified the directions a little because of the ingredients we had around the house and it still turned out wonderful. We used canned yams instead of the potato and already had cooked butternut squash from another recipe. We added these veggies for the last 5 minutes of simmering since they had already been cooked. After blending we added nutmeg, cinnamon, and curry. We didn't have cream and planned on adding milk instead, but after tasting we decided it didn't need anything else! I think next time I will add more apple to see if I can make the apple flavor stronger.

This was pretty good butternut squash soup, and I would probably have loved it if I didn't compare it to the "Spiced Butternut Squash Soup" that is also on this website. We found it a big tangy, probably because of the wine and the apples, and it was not as thick and rich as we liked. I confess to using canned evaporated milk instead of cream (which I always do in recipes to cut some fat).

Delicious! This soup even pleased my picky daughter.  As a great base soup each family member seasoned it as they liked it, nutmeg, cayenne, added pepper. I used water instead of chicken broth and omitted the leeks and wine and it was rich even without them.  I left out the cream and we each poured a few tablespoons of Fat Free Half & Half into our hot soup at the table.  This is a winner.

Great Recipe. I was looking for a new butternut squash recipe, and this one hit it out of the park. It will make it on to our table again. I'd like to try the sweet potato instead of a white one next time :)

My whole family loved this recipe! It's delicious, makes a lot and is really easy to make, especially if you buy butternut squash that's already cubed, like I did. The only thing I added that wasn't in the recipe was a couple of teaspoons of cinnamon and also kicked up the amount of nutmeg, salt & pepper too. Besides topping it with the chives, we also topped it with cheddar croutons. It would also be great served with BLT's or grilled cheese.

I adored this recipe.  It was a fantastic way to use up some huge butternut squashes we had.  Even my husband who isn't a huge fan of butternut liked it!

Great soup! I added some cooked spicy chorizo at the end to add a little more spice. Also, added a little cilantro at the end and topped with diced Crimini mushrooms and a dollup of sour cream. Delicious!

This is my new favourite soup. I only pureed about half of the vegetables but I will probably go ahead and do all of it next time, and just leave it a bit chunky.
I followed the recipe for the most part, the only changes being that I sauteed the onions and leeks in olive oil and a little less butter, used a sweet potato instead of a regular potato, and added garlic, cumin, ginger, and a bit of yellow curry powder in addition to the cinnamon and nutmeg.
I added a couple tablespoons of apple cider vinegar because I didn't have any white wine or cider on hand. I'm not sure it changed the flavour much, but I'm not a fan of vinegar so I didn't want to add too much. I will make sure I have apple cider to use next time.
I baked the butternut squash seeds with a little olive oil and salt and used them as a garnish - so good! And they are really good for you. Don't just throw them out. I like them even better than pumpkin seeds.
Even with the changes I made, this was perfect. You can't really go wrong with this and it's a great soup to experiment with.

This is an outstanding recipe!  It's easy and delicious -- even without the cream.  I made it as written, but on the second time around, I omitted the cream.  Either way, it's a winner in my house.  Thanks so much for sharing it!

Just loved he soup made with this recipe.  --Even with leaving out the half & half & wine.  It's the best I've tried so far.  And I've tried quite a few.
I look forward to growing more butternut squash next year so I can use this recipe.  Maybe I'll even try growing the leeks too.

Excellent soup! We added some cayenne and ginger at the end (instead of nutmeg) for a little extra kick. This soup is surprisingly filling. Great for a cold fall day.

So good!  I love how you can taste all the ingredients individually within the blend.  I used a whole squash which was probably double the amount, but it was still delicious.  I will be serving this as our first course for Thanksgiving.  YUM!!

This was a great recipe, but I tweaked it a little. First, I cut the squash in half and sprinkled olive oil, fresh ground black pepper, thyme, and rosemary on them, then baked for 40 minutes at 400 degrees to soften the meat of the squash. I added a teaspoon of minced garlic and chopped bacon to the initial butter, onion, and leek medley. I followed the rest of the steps as written, but in the end, used heavy cream, cumin, and ginger in addition to the nutmeg. My dad hates squash, but he sure liked this! Definitely a big hit all around!

This wasn't a bad soup. Quite bland especially pureed. It took a lot of work to peel, core, and dice the food. I would not make this again.

Very good! I used a sweet potato instead of a regular potato, and cider vinegar instead of the wine, as I never have any wine. Also, I used skim milk instead of cream to lower the fat, and didn't miss the cream at all.

Good base recipe!  I wanted more spice and flavor, though.  So I added:  

1 tsp freshly grated ginger, 
2-3 dashes ground cinnamon, 
1 tsp curry powder, 
1 TBSP brown sugar.  

I also skipped the leeks and used more onion.  May try the leeks some time.  
I added a half of a sweet potato I had in my frig.
AND- I peeled and cubed the squash, then roasted it w a bit of olive oil for 20 minutes and added it half way through the cooking time.  I think the partial carmelization may have added flavor.

This was great! I made it twice, and the first time my family liked it, but it was a little too thick and 'squashy'.  So this time I added cauliflower too, plus a bit more broth and some extra potato - didn't have leeks so just used extra onion.  Used a gala apple.  Much better with this extra other vegetable variation.  I used white potatoes instead of sweet, since we were trying to get away from the strong orange vegetable taste.  Also added a pinch of cinnamon along with the nutmeg, no wine, and only a little bit of lite half and half.  Thumbs up!!

Came out great.  I omitted the leeks, chives, and wine because I don't like them.  I used a Sweet Potato.  I also added about a cup or so more Squash, and used about 1-2 teaspoons of Nutmeg, Sage, Cayenne, and Rosemary because people said it was bland.  Flavor was subtle but good.

OMG!  Made this last night!  DELISH!!!  You won't be disappointed!  I bought two butternut squashes as I was not sure how much I was going to get out of just 1 squash.  But you only need to buy one for this recipe.  However, it won't go to waste, I am going to make another batch this week!

Excellent! Rated it 4 stars because I had another version at O'connors Restaurant in Worcester, MA that is 5+ stars (sweeter for some reason).  Will make again! I omitted the white wine and cream.  Still great.

Excellent Recipe. However i did modify it. I had no leak or chives so omitted these. i used yellow Yukon Gold potatoes. i had no dry white wine so instead I put 1.5 Tspn of mirin (japanese rice wine) which made it more healthy, i wanted this dairy free so i omitted the cream and sour cream. i did not feel like using pepper and i seasoned with a pinch of sea salt once the soup first came to a boil so the salt was cooked in and released more of the natural sugars in the  veggies (also  seasoning first makes salt more digestable and better for your intestines). my kids had two servings they loved it so much .  We decided to be even more healthier and not eat bread with it. It was more than satisfying on its own!   i have been trying healthier buttnernut soup recipes and haven't been happier until i found this one and modified it. i should just repost it as a new recipe LOL.  YUM!

This was pretty good.  When I tasted it it seemed like it needed to be a little sweeter...with the apple flavor so I added a couple Tbs of brown sugar.  Everything else I followed exactly.  Oh but I didn't have the wine so left that out.  Overall after the added sweetness it was really tasty!

This had a good flavor, but MAKE SURE YOU COOK IT UNTIL THE VEGGIES ARE VERY SOFT.  Mine was still a little chunky after blending.

This soup has an excellently smooth and subtle taste.  It would make a great before dinner soup. We put one sweet potato and one red potato.

This was my first soup recipe ever. I never knew the complexity of yummy soup recipes. I enjoyed working with all of the varied ingredients and the final outcome. The only reason I didn't rate this with 5 stars is because I didn't feel as though this soup was perfect on it's own, but needing additional supplementation.

Excellent. Definitely a keeper. I followed the recipe to the letter, and it turned out beautifully. I swirled some heavy cream into the top of each bowl prior to sprinkling fresh chives for a lovely presentation.

I love this soup. I made the recipe just as it is written- didn't add the optional wine because I didn't have any on hand. It is such an appropriate food for autumn and apple season. Will definitely make again and accompany it this time with a good sandwich.

Excellent recipe!  I used 1/2 & 1/2 rather than the light cream, plus a bit of ginger.  Yummy, and satisfying on a chilly fall day.

It is good, but lacked a layer of flavor for us.  I did as some reviewers said, and used a sweet potato and added cayenne.  It did have a kick from the cayenne but was still just a bit "flat".

My hubby and I truly enjoyed this recipe.  I made it with what I had on hand and it turned out excellent.  I used a really large acorn squash in lieu of the butternut and a Fuji apple instead of the Granny Smith.  It was very flavorful.  I added a bit of ground black pepper, white pepper, and red cayenne for more flavor.  I didn't add the cream or the wine.  I used an immersion blender and it turned out very creamy and hearty.

This was excellent.  I am not at ALL a squash fan but my husband, who is not much of a veggie, fan will eat squash.  I was a little leary, but the recipe sounded tasty and the reviews are right! It was actually quite excellent especially with a dollop of sour cream! Thanks for sharing!

Yum! This soup was perfect for a cold winter evening. The apple gives it a bit of tang and makes the flavors of the other vegetables really stand out. It tasted great even without the wine. Next time I will try the suggestion of using a sweet potato rather than a white potato just to make it a little different. Super easy to make and makes the kitchen smell so good when cooking!

I love this recipe especially with the ceyenne flavor. This blended much better in a blender than in a food processor. Instead of cinnamon I used pumpkin pie spice which was very good because of the blend of multiple spices. Would be a perfect soup for guests because it's an elegant dish.

I really wanted to love this soup because I love all the ingredients and thought this sounded like a unique and tasty combination.  Plus, it is super healthy.  However, something was just missing for me.  I didn't use the wine because I didn't have any but it is listed as "optional" so that shouldn't be too big of a deal.  I enjoy the mellow flavor but it's a bit too mellow for me.  I actually do plan on making this soup again, with some tweaking, because I really, really want it to work for my family.  Maybe more nutmeg, maybe some ginger.... I'll keep an eye on these reviews for suggestions.

There was nothing 'wrong' with this recipe--it just didn't suit me.  Used the apple cider instead of white wine as someone else suggested, more than a quarter cup, actually.  The nutmeg flavor was nonexistent and I doubled that and added a generous handful of brown sugar after tasting.  A little too mellow for me; nothing wrong with it, just won't make it again.  Certainly gets lots of points for being healthy, though.

Everyone LOVES this soup! I tripled everything and made a big pot. I used sweet potatoes instead of regular, didn't use the leeks (they smelled weird after I cut them up), and I used sweet white wine instead of dry. So so so yummy!

I thought this was just okay. I followed the recipe but used sherry instead of white wine. I was disappointed by the flavor of the soup--not enough squash flavor, and bland overall. I ended up doubling the nutmeg and adding a little cayenne, and there still wasn't a whole lot of taste there. Also, what flavor was there was a little too onion-heavy for me(and that was without the chive garnish, even)--I think either the onion or the leeks would have been sufficient. I think I'll keep looking for a squash soup recipe, but thanks.

This recipe is fantastic.  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was the hit of the dinner.  Definitely use the white wine; can easily do without the cream.   I served it with a dollop of sour cream and chives to garnish.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!  I added about 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon, which really livened it up.  I am also going to try to roast the squash next time, just to add a little more flavor.  I am using it as a first course for my fall dinner party!

This was a delicious recipe. I made a slightly bigger batch as I didn't want to waste the butternut squash (added extra carrots etc.) I also added 1 stalk of celery and added a bit of turmeric, curry and cayenne pepper to give it some extra kick. Would definitely make this recipe again.

I can't give this five stars as I made some changes.   I doubled the recipe for a large group but that made a LOT of soup - I could have kept the recipe as written.  I used leeks and a combination of red and yellow onions due to what I had on hand.  I also used Golden Hubbard and Ghost blue squash instead of butternut - again, what I had in my freezer.  I used a very large Jonagold apple (sweeter than a Granny Smith). I also used coconut milk instead of cream.  Everyone loved the soup and so did I.   It is a keeper.  Thanks.

I only had one large leek so I added a  large sweet onion instead of the second leek in the recipe. I also added a teaspoon of fresh thyme while it was cooking. I frizzled some fresh sage and added a couple of pieces along with a drizzle of olive oil and a dollop of sour cream to each bowl to serve. Not only was this a dish of delish but it was also a soul warmer on a cold Fall day.

Made as written except I omitted the onion because my leek was so large, I used all of it. Didn't use wine either. I used by blender to puree the soup in batches as I do not have an emersion blender. By light cream , I assumed half and half and used that. I alway use "Better than Bullion" to make chicken broth. Also used frozen and defrosted butternut squash. Used a pink lady apple as that is what I had on hand. Very good soup and easy to make. Makes a ton, so I froze half of it.

Absolutely delicious.  I wouldn't change a thing.  I look forward to making this bisque every fall & winter.  Buying the squash cubed from Costco saves time and is easier on arthritic hands.

Followed this exactly, except for subbing a 1/2 cup  of half n half for the light cream, and didn't bother with the wine.  It's very healthy and warming, and the blend of flavors is excellent.  Also agree with others that it's even better the next day.  I happen to have chives in my herb garden, and they really add to both the presentation and flavor.  Great recipe, my thanks to the poster!

Made it without the leeks because I didn't have any.  I roasted the squash and carrots in advance.  I would like the tart taste if the Apple to stand out more.  I love the texture of this soup.

Overall, really solid soup! I incorporated a few of the common review comments, left it largely unchanged. A nice meatless (although not vegetarian since I used homemade chicken stock), cozy fall soup. Nutritious and delicious! I'm definitely looking forward to lunches this week :)

Felt it was too bland. The ratio of leeks and onion were too heavy so I added another apple and doubled the squash. 
It warmed the ribs, but I prefer more spice.

I didn't use a potato and I used my garden chives. I like it without the milk or cream.  It is an easy base soup to try different things with.  I really love using curry and ginger and another "try" that we liked was a pinch of nutmeg.  I have made several large batches and plan on doing more to freeze while the squash is available.  It was good with acorn squash too.

Made the soup.  Read a few reviews before making it.  I used sweet potato instead of potato.  I added cloves ( only 1/8 tsp) and wish I hadn't.  This soup was very bland as some said so I improvised.  Added more nutmeg, brown sugar, more salt.  Still wasn't right so I had an orange and juiced about 1/8th cup.  Now you're talking flavor.  Added a dollop of sour cream and handed over to my husband.  He said it was better than the restaurant we frequent.  I guess it was finally a "hit"!!!

I made this to the T.  There was quite a bit of prep in comparison to some other squash soup recipes I have made.  I put up squash every year, so I used already cooked and frozen squash which was a time saver.  It is good, but I have some other favorites from allrecipes  that I prefer over this one.  Still a good soup!

I gave this recipe a 4, even though I thought it was just alright, because my husband loved it. I followed the instructions as written.  Even though I salted and peppered it while cooking, I found that I needed to add more salt and pepper to my own individual serving --- it just needed extra flavoring.  It was a very filling recipe served with a salad and rolls and great for a cold night meal.

Love butternut squash soup, but I added a bit of cinnamon to this for extra flavor, as well as extra cream.  I think this recipe to made with far too many onions.

This is about the 4th or 5th time I've made this soup. It is delicious!  The only thing I changed was that's I used vegetable stock instead of chicken (to make it vegetarian).  I don't usually cook with leeks but I think that might be the key ingredient that takes this soup to the next level.  My whole family, even the meat lovers, enjoyed this soup!

Amazing. My husband and son usually don’t go for anything but chili and stew. They loved this recipe. I personally loved it as well. It came out very smooth and creamy with just enough sweet. I didn’t have a nutmeg so I just threw in some apple pie spice. It was still really good. I will definitely be making this a lot

I didn’t have chicken stock. My chicken broth worked well. I melted my blender during the purée process. Boo hoo.

I will make it again!! Delicious.

I really liked this, I used all frozen veggies including the butternut squash.  I also added a small can of pumpkin and just eyeballed the nutmeg and cinnamon. I doubled this and made it in a crock pot. I also added frozen sweet potato, which I found at Walmart, because it was organic, it was more expensive, but you can find regular frozen sweet potato at Market Basket.   Because all of the veggies were frozen it took eight hours on low and my crockpot is fairly new so it runs really good, your crockpot may vary in time, but you can just set it and forget it. I used a hand held blender to blend and it was a big hit!! It all went. I served this with grilled cheese sandwiches.  You could serve this with just about any sandwich or fresh bread and a salad. Enjoy!!!!!

I made it and I’d make it again.  It was a bit sweet to me, I was light on the salt but that’s an easy fix.

Very good soup, would make again. I might add more butternut squash next time. I didn’t have nutmeg, so I used a pinch of cinnamon.

This soup is what my husband calls “very pleasant”....meaning please make more!  I followed the recipe almost completely except that I used a sweet potato instead of a regular one and I used a Vidalia onion and some fresh minced garlic instead of the leeks.  I also took the advice from some of the comments and roasted the butternut squash.  A small handful of fresh herbs (thyme and sage) brought it home!  Don’t let the purée step stop you!  It is worth the effort for a truly elegant presentation.

Made this soup today. It is delicious. I didn't have leeks so used all onion. Also used Gala apple and a squash I had baked in the oven. Didn't have the wine so left it out. I always have fresh nutmeg so grated some in.  It really added a nice flavor. Separated some and added light cream and some apple cider to that.  The recipe is very good without cream and cider but I prefer it with. One other difference is I used vegetable stock so I can let my vegetarian friends try it. I will definitely make this again. Thank you for sharing.

We loved it - adding the wine adds more flavour, as well as the cream. We added a little extra spices. We make it every thanksgiving. It's become a family favourite.

best soup ever! I make this every year at the start of fall and freeze it. It does take a while to make. I use sweet potato instead of regular. I also add a sprig of fresh rosemary while the butter and onions are cooking. Do yourself a favor and put all the ingredients like the apples, onions, carrots etc into a food processor before cooking. This soup can get quite chunky if you don't and that means more time in the blender later. I see a few people here don't add the cream. I personally like it much better wth the cream

This was delicious!!!  I don't know how anyone can say it's bland because it was very flavorful.  I made the recipe as written, except I didn't use a leek and I used milk instead of cream.  I prefer a little thicker soup so I thickened it somewhat at the end.  I precooked the squash for about 5 minutes in the microwave (pricking it several times), to make it easier to cut.  I made a double batch and it used about 1/2 of my squash (so I cut the rest in cubes and froze to use the next time I make this).  I made this last night and my house still smells SO good!

Awesome recipe, will make again! I used about 3/4 cups of white wine instead (used a chardonnay). Used a sweet yellow onion and omitted chives. Had no problems with blandness.

This soup was the disappointment of a lifetime. There was no point in putting any apples in there because their taste could not be detected whatsoever after they got mixed in with the rest of the vegetables. The finished product was a bland pool of mediocre-at-best slop. I'm not sure how they managed to ruin butternut squash, which was previously my favorite vegetable but now I'm not sure if I can trust it anymore. RIP

I thought this was soooo yummy. I was looking for something similar to Campbell's golden butternut squash soup in the box & oh man, this was like it but even better. It was so hearty & delicious & a lovely flavour. I used a sweet potato & half & half cream, & I also omitted the wine. Other than that, everything was the same. I will be making this A LOT in the colder months! Thank you!

Addicted to this soup!

I made this on a cold Autumn day. I did substitute the wine with apple cider and added lots of carrots. Everyone went crazy for it. It is addictive and healthy. Dropped some off to my sister and her family and for days they text me how much they loved the soup.

I did make some changes but I'm giving this 5 stars because it's a great base! I added 2 cloves of garlic, 2 tsp grated ginger, left out the wine, subbed out a few tbsp of sour cream for the cream since I didn't have any... so no it's not super close to the original but man is it ever good with a generous grind of sea salt and pepper!

I just finished making this soup!  This was a very easy soup to make, which I like.  Instead of potatoe I used sweet potatoe, i also substituted 3% milk instead of cream.  In addition, I found the soup to lack a bit of flavour so I added allspice, ginger, cayenne pepper, and cinnamon.

I rarely review recipes because I read over the other reviews and use the suggestions. I don't feel you should rate something a 5 star when you have drastically changed the original recipe. But this one gets a true rating as I changed nothing. Followed the recipe as stated and we all loved it. We found the soup to be very filling so as suggested next time it will go with just a salad and some bread for a healthy and filling lunch or dinner.

Will make this soup often - loved it.  I added a chopped gala apple after the soup was puréed, as we like small chunks  mixed in.   The apple softened up nicely since the soup was hot.  For the spices I used allspice in place of  the nutmeg & I also added cinnamon.  Smells & tastes great!!!

Good basic recipe! Proportions of vegetables worked well.  Followed previous reviews adding sweet potato (instead of a white potato) and 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, and omitting the white wine and light cream.  Opted to season with cinnamon rather than nutmeg.  Hearty, tasty, easy!  Also used olive oil in lieu of butter.

I made this soup for my family last night and they loved it.  Because of some dietary restrictions I changed it slightly by omitting the white wine and using full fat coconut milk instead of cream.  It was divine.  This will become a regular at our house.

I didn't have any wine and I'm avoiding dairy, so I left out the cream as well. It was still delicious and so easy to make.

This was a delicious recipe and so easy to make. I followed other readers' advice and used cider vinegar instead of wine (2 tbsps) and I used a tbsp of brown sugar to enhance the sweetness.

Outstanding, comfort soup. Only changes I made were apple cider in lieu of wine and pecan soy creamer rather than half and half. I topped it with roasted pumpkin seeds.  Yum,

Wonderful! Made Vegan. Read the comments and made my own adjustments. I had 6 Cups of Butternut Squash, so I used it all, added an extra apple(didnt peel) and 2 carrots to balance the increase in squash. Used Sweet Potatos (2) & didnt peel. Substituted Herbamare & water instead of Chicken broth. Used Apple Cider instead of wine and omitted the cream. I also used an impersion blender and left it very chunky.  Thank you all who shared comments, I combined many of your changes.

Pretty tasty! Used a sweet potato instead of regular as others suggested. Also a fuji apple since I can't have granny smith ones.  
Also I HIGHLY advise you use 1/8tsp nutmeg and taste it first- nutmeg can REALLY overpower the flavor of a dish easily! I found 1/8tsp was plenty. I added a few dashes of cinnamon and a pinch of cayenne as well- Made for a nice mix of savory, sweet, and spicy! 
I only used 1/4 cup cream, but honestly it would be fine without. I also used dry vermouth in place of white wine (I always do this, it's never let me down) and found it added a nice flavor. I can't have ACV, but I can see how that would be tasty as well instead of wine (but only like a tablespoon or so). My husband typically isn't a fan of pureed soups, but this one he liked!

This was a really smooth, silky, very tasty soup.  Just enough sweetness and I added a bit more nutmeg to give it a fall flavor.  I really enjoyed the thick, creamy texture, and is delicious as is.  It is a nice change from the chunky soups I usually eat, and is a great comfort food on a fall day.  I added the white wine and light cream and it was a nice touch of flavor.

No wine, leeks, or cream. Based on other reviews and what I had on hand: used one red potato and one sweet potato. 1/2+ tsp nutmeg and cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves. Several shakes rosemary and thyme. Generous salt and pepper. 1 TB Apple cider vinegar in place of wine. Tasted pretty good!

I can't say anything bad about this. Followed mostly to a "T" and it was yummy. My only sub was a sweet potato instead of regular. Maybe added a bit of extra squash because I had a ton, making it thicker. Nice sweet savoury flavour. I added a bit of cinnamon to enhance the sweetness and some sliced kielbasa to make it a meal because I had it. Great on its own though.

This soup was wonderful!  I only made a few changes to the recipe.  Instead of leeks, I used scallions because I had them on hand.  Also, instead of nutmeg, I added cinnamon.  It came out Awesome an I will definitely make it again!

Incredibly bland - I ended up adding another 2 cups of butternut squash that I had roasted, and then added hard apple cider instead of the white wine. I also added some ginger (not sure how much), more nutmeg, 1/2 block of cream cheese and two tsp brown sugar.

I have used this recipe for years and I love it. I often substitute apple juice for the chicken stock and I add 1-2 tsp curry powder.  For a spicy variation, add cayenne pepper to the soup or garnish with red pepper flakes.

We love homemade soups, & we love squash. I admit to a couple additions, an apple & some cream & spices I use when cooking squash,  BUT, the recipe could easily stand on it's own.

Wow.  This is just what my mouth was watering for.  I didn't have light cream, so I used lite culinary coconut milk.  I can't know if it made a taste difference - I just know this soup is very tasty and comforting.  I will make it again.

This is the second time that I have made this soup and each time it has turned out wonderfully.  What I like best is that it is so versatile!  I made it the first time as written, except used a sweet potato instead of a white and it was awesome!  This time I didn't have leaks, so used more onion, roasted my squash (used both acorn and butternut), carrots, apples and onions; I also used apple cider vs. wine and it was amazing.  Like any recipe, you should season to taste, so I may a dash more of this and less of that, due to preference, but overall great as written!

I used the stock from simmering the veggies in place of chicken broth. It was a vegan version for me. I also added 1/8tsp of pampered chef's cinnamon blend. My apples were freshed picked from the orchard. This soup was such a hit I have made it three times this fall and renamed in,"Encore Apple and Squash Soup" !

My husband and I both love Butternut Squash by itself and can pretty much make a meal out of that alone. A co-worker friend who uses allrecipes suggested I try one of the Butternut Squash soups. So I chose this one. In all honesty I had 3 small bowls (more like cups) and the verdict was still out as to whether I liked it. My husband had some later and he wasn't sure either. Of course it made a lot for just 2 people so we had it the following day for lunch. And we both agreed the second day was better and agreed this one will get made again. This is a very unique soup.  We could taste the apple, the onions, I didn't puree it too finely so we also had carrots and finely diced potato to taste. We couldn't distinguish the squash in it. Which I think is why it took so long to make a decision on whether we liked it. I followed the recipe to the tee with the exception of a second leek. I just used one and I think that was perfect for us since there was also onion in it. I shared with my co-worker friend that this was a good soup and that she should try it also. I will make it again but I think the next time I will add crumbled cooked bacon bits. Probably will cook those in with the onions.

I followed the advice of other reviews and roasted sweet potato, carrots, and onions in the oven to make the soup more flavorful. I also used apple cider vinegar instead of wine. I thought it tasted great and so did my roommates! I'm not sure if I would make it again, since there was a long amount of prep time. It definitely took me longer than 30 minutes, probably because I roasted all the vegetables. However, it was great for a rainy fall day!

Fabulous soup. Love the combination. I used cinnamon instead of nutmeg and the whole family loved it (including the kids).

This was very good. i had to make some changes because we are vegan.  I used veggie stock and the wine. No cream necessary.  I had a fire roasted hubbard that I just did with brown sugar and that was my base. I sauteed in sunflower oil instead of butter.  I added a nice pinch of chipolte chili powder and omitted the nutmeg.  My daughter appreciated the potatoes~ we left it chunky. She is licking the bowl right now! Thanks!

I enjoyed this a lot.  Like most reviewers, I made some changes but mostly due to what I had on hand.  I used butternut and acorn squashes.  Omitted carrots because I didn't have any.  I added an apple and a pear and used a sweet potato.  I simmered the veggies with a cinnamon stick.  I omitted the wine and used almond milk in place of cream.  This had a very smooth, nutty flavor.  I will definitely make it again.

SO good, but a little time consuming. Still- makes for quite a few meals, definitely worth the effort. 

Changes: Sub sweet potato for regular potato, sub apple cider and apple cider vinegar instead of white wine (1/4 cup of the cider and maybe a little less than that for vinegar), and I added brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger and cumin. Probably doesn't need the cream, I may try without it next time.

This was our first fall-themed soup of the year, and it was absolutely delicious.  I disagree with the critical review that said this soup was bland - obviously you have to add some salt and pepper but once it was seasoned it was full of rich, warm flavor with a lot of subtlety courtesy of the variety of vegetable (and fruit) ingredients.  I also left out the white wine, otherwise I followed the recipe closely.  I garnished it with chives, and served it with sauteed kale and sausage on the side, and another side of some sharp cheese - which I also garnished the soup with, it was delicious.  Highly recommended!

I roasted the squash first and added last to pot. I made 3 cups of squash and left other proportions the same. Added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and all of the cream and white wine. We thought the taste was great without the cream but added it for additional texture. Big hit in the family.

This is so good that I find myself craving it periodically. Have made it many times, sometimes without the wine, or without cream, or changing the type of apple depending on what I have on hand. It's best as written but it's never bad even with substitutions. Honestly, I'm a person who struggles to eat vegetables (a 5 year old inside an adult's body) but I love, love, love this soup- in fact it's a hot summer day and I'm making it (again) because I had a craving.

Yes made this today I doubled the recipe. Then tweaked it a bit I used all sweet onions, no leeks, also used Fuji apples and garnet sweet potatoes.  I added two cups of chopped organic carrots.  Then spiced it up I added cinnamon one tsp, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and a one TBLS of light brown sugar.  Used two TBLS of cider vinegar instead if wine, sea salt and ground pepper to taste.  Added a cup and half of half and half at the end after using the hand blender.  DELISH with some crusty bread for dipping in a cup.  So good, Yummy.

i made this for dinner and it was a hit with my 3yo too , she chose not to add chives to hers. we used red skin potatoes instead of russett because that's what were available to us, and i felt like the ingredient list could be more specific about the amount of leeks. the nutmeg and light cream really balances out all the flavors. i really liked it!

I like most of my soups to be thicker consistency unless we are talking good old fashioned chicken soup. This soup is thin for me so I added another idaho potato. Next time I will just cut down on broth instead of adding another potato. I also found it missing an ingredient so I spooned a small portion and explored. Cinnamon was the answer!  YES!  Yummy! I didn't have cream or white wine on hand but with the cinnamon I was happy. It is healthier this way anyway!!

Deeeelish!!  I really loved this! I used vegetable stock because that is what I had on hand and left out the wine.  All of the different components can be adjusted to your own preferences for flavors.  Easy and yummy, not to mention how wonderful it makes your house smell!

Wasn't going to rate because I made so many changes to make it aip friendly and I was out of some thing but it was so delicious I just figured I'd note what I did.  Changed white potato to sweet potato and had no carrot so I added a second sweet potato.  I'm sensitive to onion so I just left thst out but left the leek, I only had one cup of squash so I added a cup of pumpkin, nutmeg is not allowed on my diet so I added cinnamon and ginger instead and used coconut milk instead of cream.  Loved this soup

As usual I didn't follow exactly. No carrots, so used two golden queen tomatoes, skins removed, and an additional early red apple. Just as with my garden tomato leek soup, I add a glop of sour cream to each bowl when serving, instead of adding to the pot. Really delicious and smooth, but next time I'll leave out the extra apple. The golden queen tomato provides some acidity and balance to the sweetness. Yum is the word of the day! Patricia in Washington, PA.

It was  a lot of work to chop up all those veggies (although I made a double batch), and I thought it was bland - the wine and nutmeg did help - I used milk instead of light cream - which would probably have been better. I also ended up adding ginger, cinnamon, and cloves. I actually thought that made it worse. so I then added some apple cider vinegar. I feel like it tastes thin to me. I've read it's better after it sits for a day or two - we will see. At this point, I probably won't make this again.

Followed the recipe exactly, and it was incredibly bland. The smell was nice, the color is pleasant, but there is almost no butternut squash flavor.

I would omit the potato, double the squash, add some more spices (cinnamon, curry powder, or cayenne are all good options), leave out the wine, reduce the amount of leek/onion, and cut the cream. 

The portion size indicated is vastly underestimated, I would guess this yielded twice the number of servings the recipe said it would.

Essentially, I would not make this again.

I have made this many times, and modified it every time, depending on what I have on hand.  I hardly ever remember to buy leeks, so I usually just add more onion. Lately I use coconut oil instead of olive or butter, as it has a higher smoke point, and I think the coconut flavor is complimentary. I recently cut back on eating nightshades, so I sub a sweet potato for the white potato.  I also use about a 2 x 1 inch piece of fresh ginger peeled and shredded. This is a must!  It adds susch a great compliment to the orange veggies. At the end I stir in coconut milk and nutmeg.  No need for the heavy cream IMO, though it does add richness, and will make you more full.  If you want it a little thicker, use less broth.

It smelled wonderful. The flavor was not to my liking.  Definitely would not recommend this.

This recipe was nice, but I feel like it needed a little extra "something" to give it a kick; maybe some chorizo or other spicy sausage next time to add flavor and round out the meal with protein.  My family liked the flavor blend of all the ingredients, but I think next time I will incorporate the advice of a fellow reviewer and substitute a sweet potato for the regular potato.  I used a spiced white wine, but still didn't feel like it was enough spice...add some ginger next time, too.

I have made this a number of times but have modified it to my own taste. I always roast the squash. I think it imparts a smokiness to the finished product.  I add a generous pour of Sherry, 2-3 tbls of ginger paste or minced if I have it, mild or yellow curry to taste but..not enough to over power, but to punch it up.  I have also used apple sauce when I was out of apples.  I use heavy cream..(its a luxurious soup and we don't eat it more than once or twice a year). I use an emulsion blender and finish it off with another splash of Sherry, a dollop of plain Greek yogurt, a sprinle of nutmeg and a pinch of minced chives.

I made this recipe pretty much as described. I used a whole butternut which was about 4 cups. I garnished with little bits bacon. Next time I will roast the veggies as that sounds like it will develop more flavor. I will try vinegar instead of wine because it needed a little more acid. I will also try adding a bit of cayenne. This was a very nice meal with fresh homemade bread.

Delicious! It's true, it didn't need cream. I used milk instead, mostly just because it was pretty thick without it. It's a lovely consistency when it's finished. I also added cinnamon, double the nutmeg, and a dash of cloves. So tasty! Perfect fall soup.

I have made this twice already in two weeks. The first time I made it I didn't have leeks or wine but it was so good! The second time I used leeks but no onion or wine and a little extra nutmeg. That was even better. I added a little bit of ginger both times.

We did not like this very much at all. I even used a small potato, and that's all we could taste. There was nothing good about this recipe. We were very excited to try it, but were let down.

This soup is not worth the effort.  There are too many ingredients and the flavors end up muddled and bland.  One review recommended substituting apple cider vinegar for the wine - do NOT do this.  The vinegar flavor takes over the soup.  I was so disappointed when I tasted this soup.

So rich it could pass for dessert! Made a few changes, notably switching out the cream for vanilla almond milk. Used two sweet potatoes instead of a white potato. Doubled the apples and left out the carrots (only because we were out.) Used apple cider in place of white wine. Also added spices to taste including cumin, nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice. Served with hot bread out of the oven.

I made this after our first official New England snow storm, it was delicious! I added four heaping spoonfuls of pumpkin cream cheese spread to add a little sweetness and used almond milk instead of the light cream, I will make this again!

This soup was fabulous!  It almost tasted like dessert!  I didn't have wine so skipped it and really didn't measure the vegetables.  I used an acorn squash because that's what I had and added two apples.  To finish, i added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg.  So delicious!

This soup was great. I followed the recipe pretty much to the T except that in addition to the regular potato I added 1 sweet potatol. Oh, I did not have serve it with chives as I didn't have any on hand. I would make this again. It was easy to make after you have all of the veggies cut up.  I served it with homemade bread sticks.

Definitely a recipe worth keeping!  I changed it a little: I added another potato and some sausage, left out the cream, and pureed only the butternut squash to add texture and make it feel more sustaining.  The flavors were awesome!  Also, sprinkling some sharp cheddar cheese on top is a nice little touch and brings out the flavors nicely!  :)

I followed the recipe accept I substituted apple cider vinegar for the wine and I didn't measure very carefully because my squash was huge and I figured I'd need a little extra of stuff to balance things out.  The soup turned out very good but I think the apple cider vinegar was too much.  I may consider adding ginger and maybe garlic next time

I didn't have leeks so I used green onions. Didn't have wine and didn't miss it. And only had HEAVY cream. That's probably what made it so good haha. Very filling. Delicious :)

This is fantastic.  The apple adds just the right amount of sweetness and zing.  I even simplified the recipe and it still came out great.  Instead of stock I simply used two cups of salted water.  I also left out the leek, as we had none, and didn't add the cream or wine.  I also varied the spicing a bit.  I used one quarter teaspoon nutmed, a quarter teaspoon cinnamon, and a quarter teaspon sage.  It was soooo good.

really healthy and very tasty!  I used organic vegetable broth, and as i didn't have any dry white (very unusual!) i used organic apple juice and in place of cream used fat free milk - as that is what i use.  Deeeelicious:)

Great recipe! I left the cream out of much of it so it freezes better.  The only things I added were a bit of cayenne and some garam masala to give it some Indian warmth. This will definitely be going in my recipe database!

Fabulous soup!  I have never had much success with pureed soups, however this recipe was easy to follow and absolutely delicious! I admit I will add a wee bit of brown sugar next time just to add a bit more sweetness, but overall this is an absolutely delicious recipe! Thanks so much for helping me find a use for those root vegetables!

We didn't care for this soup. Runny with no flavor. Maybe I did something wrong, but I will definitely not make this recipe again.

I really liked it.  I made some minor adjustments.. added a tiny bit of cinnamon, a parsnip and left out the cream.  I will definitely make again.

I made a huge batch of this last night and love it, and will for the next few days ;-). These are the changes that I made: I used sweet potato instead of normal potato, instead of the cream I poured in a sauce I had just made out of soaked macadamia nuts, pine nuts, garlic and water. I didn't use the wine. I had planned to use cinnamon instead of nutmeg and grabbed red pepper by mistake - ahem - that gave it some kick, but the nut sauce mellowed it down. Overall it came out awesome. The little nut pieces really add something to this.

This is a simple and delicious fall soup. My husband can be pretty picky and squash tends to scare him but when he tried it, he loved it! I omitted the onions/leeks, because he is allergic to them and added onion powder and cumin at the beginning with 1 small clove of garlic. I used Pepper Squash instead of butternut because that is what I had in the house. Everything came together very easily and was really tasty. I will definitely make this again and am already planning a menu around this soup for my next dinner party with friends.

I've had this in my recipe box for ages and now can't believe I've waited so long to try it. As there's a vegetarian in the family I used vegetable stock instead of chicken. I thought I had cream but didn't so used milk instead. I used my immersion blender to puree and left it slightly chunky. Thankyou for a great recipe Cynjne.

This is an amazing soup! I used a sweet potato instead of a regular potato; this gave it a prettier color as well as more flavor. My leeks were huge, so I only used one. I used a golden delicious apple instead of a granny smith, because that is what I had on hand. Instead of light cream and wine, I used milk mixed with a little water, so that it wouldn't be quite as rich. It was awesome! I will be making this one again...thanks for sharing!

this soup was good and cremy. It is a little more work than most squash soups, and one of my daughters liked it less than the usual, while another said it was just the same. Not sure that the extra effort in peelong and chopping is worth it. However, it was an interesting experiment. thanks!

I loved this soup!  I wanted an easy recipe, and this is definitly it. Loved the combo of flavors.  I had to make a few changes, as I wasn't able to get leeks, and didn't have any chicken stock. I substituted vegetable broth, and used dry sherry for the wine. I also seasoned it with a teaspoon of sweet curry powder.  I'll definitly make this again!!!

This is OK, but I have other squash soup recipes--with fewer ingredients--that I like better.  Even though I roasted the squash, the other flavors overwhelmed it.

I used a sweet potato.  The soup is a little too sweet in my opinion, and i might go with a regular potato if i made it again.

I received nothing but praise on this recipe!  Everybody loved it and I found that it was easy to make.  The hardest part was cutting up the squash since it is so hard, but nothing I couldn't handle.  I will definately make again.

I left out the wine and switch the potato for a sweet potato and the chicken stock for veggie stock - it was super super good!  We ate this all winter and I can't wait for the cooler weather to start making it again!  Definitely my FAVORITE recipe!!

Made this soup tonight! My husband and I enjoyed it very much! We will enjoy the leftovers. My only critique is that for a novice cook like myself it took longer than indicated to prepare everything by about an hour. :-) Even so, it was great!

this is the first squash soup I have ever made and it  is supreme!! I increased the recipe to 12 servings because I wanted to have enough for both my mom and mother in law, and some to freeze. it was enough to feed a party of 30 people which is good to know for future potlucks.  changes I made were minimal. I only used on large potato and one large sweet potato. I also added about a 1/2 to 1 tsp cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of cinnamon.   one other change I made is that I used buttercup squash instead of butter nut squash because it was all I had growing in the garden.  I will make this soup again and again. it is a Keeper .  My mom called and said that she didn't want to insult me by telling me she didn't like squash but she tried it any way and proceeded to eat 2 bowls full loving it.  Thanks CYNJNE.

Great soup! Taste is good but I would have liked a bit more kick in flavor. I will continue to experiment with different ingredients until I get it. Overall, it's a simple and tasty soup.

This soup was so tasty! I felt I could only give it four stars since I didn't follow the recipe exactly; I made several modifications. However, this was the perfect starting point for the ingredients I had on hand and the soup I wanted to end up with.

This was good, but it wasn't much different from other butternut soups I've made. The apple and wine gave it a slight tang; other than that, it wasn't really a standout. I used coconut milk instead of cream. A nice soup, but I have other recipes that are better.

Very nice soup.  I like the tanginess balanced with the sweetness.  Very easy, if a bit time consuming, to make.  It's a perfect complement for a cool fall day. I used half sour cream, half milk for the half and half since I don't have half and half.  I also didn't have leeks or carrots so I eliminated both.  I like leeks but bf doesn't so I don't usually buy them, otherwise I definitely would've put them in.  I put in onion powder and minced garlic instead.  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm not sure if I did something wrong, but this soup was nowhere near as good as I thought it would be (based on all the other reviews). I'm not sure if I'm a slow chopper or something, but it took me about an hour to chop everything for this soup! In the end, I felt like it wasn't worth it. The soup was good at first, but it tasted like something was missing, even though I did in fact put in all the ingredients. 
I might try to make this soup again, but probably with some changes.

Wow! Omitted the cream, substituted wine with cider (great suggestion). Added nutmeg, salt and whatever apple I had on hand.  So Autumn-esque that I enjoyed some cider with the soup.  The chives weren't my thing; however, this was ones in my top ten!!

This squash soup was very good, a nice mild, pleasant taste, however I am still looking for the very best butternut squash soup.

This is one of the best tasting soups I've ever made - I wish I could give it 6 stars!
