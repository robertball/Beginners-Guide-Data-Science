I love jiggles but BEWARE! I was making this for someone else and they gave me Royal Gelatin instead of letting me buy my own Jello because it was cheaper. I noticed that the weight per package was very different but substituted  it ‘ box per box’ for the recipe. Well it turns out the weight is different because a significant portion of the Royal is artificial sweetener instead of sugar. You can really taste that artificial flavor the way this recipe concentrates it. Several people got napkins and discarded the jigglers that they had popped in their mouths at the event this was for. So CHECK the ingredients on whatever brand gelatin you buy and know it makes a difference.

Used to make this to take to my son's nursery school when it was my day for treats. The kids loved it cut up in different shapes.
