I've made this soup MANY times over the past couple of years! It's definately my "go-to" soup recipe! Sometimes I add ham in place of bacon. You can also leave out the potatoes & it's just as good & hearty! Freezes well too! Thank you for a great recipe!!

Not a fan of black eyed peas but my husband loves them. This recipe was tasty enough for me to really enjoy and even my picky hubby liked it too. Next time I'll use peppered bacon just to give it a bit more kick.

I really loved this recipe.  It was delicious over cornbread.  I added more bacon and used frozen black-eyed peas instead of fresh since I had them on hand.  It was a great was enjoy a New Year's tradition.

Yum!  Great, easy recipe.  Just made this to have tomorrow for New Years lunch, and plan to serve with the Waikiki Cornbread recipe from this site.  Used pepper-crusted bacon like the last reviewer (used the full pound - we like bacon!), and added a few dashes of hot pepper sauce and Worcestershire sauce.  Very good; will definitely make again!

This was GREAT! I was afraid of the amount of salt so I did make a few adjustments: Used only 1 bullion cube, a quart of low salt chicken broth and only 2 quarts of water.  I also used cracked pepper crusted bacon (yum!)I didn't add any extra salt or pepper.  At the end I added a few pinches of cayenne and a couple dashes of cajun seasoning.  I cooled it and refrigerated it overnight to let the flavors meld together.  Great soup!!!

The end result was very tasty, but it took quite a bit longer to make this than what the recipe stated.  Perhaps soaking the beans overnight would have speeded up the process.

Only added about 1.5 quarts of water. Served over corn bread. Very yummy, reminded me of my grandmother. Even the kids ate it. Thanks, I was craving black eyed peas and no recipe to pull from.

I liked this recipe and so did my husband.  I let it simmer for about 30 minutes longer so that it would thicken.  I used a little more salt and added Tony Cachero's cajun seasoning to give it just a little kick.  Very easy and it went over well.

This recipe was perfect for a dreary day. I didn't have enough bacon so I added smoked sausage as well and this turned it into a real meal. I also added 2 cups of carrots, which improved the heartiness.

Made this recipe for the New Year and loved it.  Used the bacon drippings to make a roux to thicken it up a little.

My southern husband and I thought the recipe was too bland.  We served it with cornbread as others suggested- maybe I will try it again and add more seasonings and a bolder flavored bacon, like the pepper crusted many have used.

When I said I would make this soup, my husband said, "Aren't black-eyed peas eaten as penance?"  After eating it, he says, "This is like 15 bean soup, but better!"  This was a big hit.

I made this using a vegetarian bacon substitute and vegetable bouillon instead of chicken.  It was excellent, and definitely a recipe I will make again!

I loved this recipe.  Perfect for New Years! I know Ham Hocks taste delicious, but have you ever actually seen a ham hock before it has stewed in your beans?  Well I did and would not want that in my food no matter how good it tastes. Bacon was fine Thank You!

Ever since I can remember, my grandmother made black-eyed peas every New Year's Day. I didn't change anything and the soup was excellent. Even my wife had an extra serving! I'll make this again soon.

I recently bought an Instant Pot and this soup turned out perfectly using high pressure set for 35 minutes. The beans were soft and creamy. This is a simple recipe, but delicious!

I doubled the recipe as my husband is taking it to work to share. I was out of celery, but I added a sweet potato. I also added some Herbs de Provence and two bay leaves. I may try some fresh herbs next time. I just had a tiny bit and am hoping there will be left overs.

I made this dish for New Year's Day.  It was amazing and I'm not really big on black eyed peas.  I substituted 1 quart of water for chicken broth, left the potatoes out and used 1 pound of bacon.  Most importantly, I cooked it in my cast iron Dutch oven over a bed of coals.  This will definitely be made in my household for years to come.

Absolutely love this recipe.  Changed very little...less salt yes...potatoes in or out, doesn't matter....the pepper bacon is definitely a good addition.  It's wonderful and easy!  Have made it at least a dozen times.

I do not love black eyed peas but I had a pound of them in my pantry. Thank you Allrecipes ingredient search! I made this soup as presented but I did presoak the beans (I couldn’t stop myself - I always presoak). Also I added 1 tsp crushed red pepper. A lovely way to use a bean that I don’t really like that much but apparently bought anyway. Thank you.

Made this on New Years Day as a side dish to pork and sauerkraut. It was quick, easy, and good. Could use a little more flavor, maybe some extra herbs or spices. I used some veggie stock I had in the fridge instead of the bouillon cubes, and used a little less water to make it thicker. Will likely try it again, probably next New Years.

Holy goodness! I made this today for New Year's.  First of all, it made the house smell amazing! Secondly, it's DELICIOUS!  I used 3/4 lbs of bacon (bacon lovers here) and it calls for 3 qts of water or chicken broth.  I used 2 qts chicken broth and 1 qt of water.  I only used 2 bouillon cubes but added a smoked ham hock.  I served it with fresh cornbread. This is most definitely a do-over!! Happy New Year!

Very good.  I raise a lot of black-eyed peas and am always looking for new ways to use them.  We had some fried green tomatoes and cornbread with it. Perfect Southern meal. This soup was hearty and flavorful.  I used beef bullion instead, but it worked just fine.  Also I used a lot less water, and next time I will probably only use half the recommended water.

Good soup and easy to make. However I have trouble getting over the dark brown colour that black eyed peas turn the water / soup into. I have tried rinsing them, but I can't get over the sight.

Tried this recipe today..New Year's Day 2013. It is excellent! Added Worcestershire Sauce, green chilies, little Cajun seasoning and carrots. Will make it again for sure. Great with cornbread muffins (gotta love Martha White...with some enhancements like sour cream, cheddar and green chilies).
