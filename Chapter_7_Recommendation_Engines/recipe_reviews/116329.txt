Delicious!  I only made one half and used an entire granny smith apple.  I forgot the celery and added some salt, but pretty much kept the rest the same.  I can't believe how quickly this comes together in the microwave!  The tartness of the granny smith apple was a perfect compliment to the sweet raisins and the taste of the squash.  Quick, easy, and delicious!

This was a great sidedish!  I added just a bit of butter to the apples, celery and brown sugar and micorwaved the filling just a bit before adding into the partially baked squash.  I was serving it with roasted pork loin so I wanted to do it in the oven.  It made a big hit and was just as good reheated later in the week.  I'll definately make it again!

I hated squash as a kid but am trying to acquire a taste for it now that I'm middle-aged.  This was a good recipe to start off with.  Very easy to make, no fat added, no sodium added and I actually liked the taste!  I left out the celery because I didn't have any on hand and added a few teaspoons of lemon juice to perk up the flavor a bit.  I think that the next time I make this I will try whole cranberry sauce as the filling to offset some of the sweetness.

I made this recipe exactly as posted with one change; instead of raisins, I used 1/4 cup of dried mixed fruit. The result was delicious! This is an easy yet elegant dish that turns a ho-hum meal into something special.

Pretty good but missing something for us.  I think a bit of butter in there as another suggested would help a bit...it was fast and easy though!

I'm not a huge acron squash fan, but hubby likes it and bought some the other day and I surfed for a good recipe and found this.  Hubby made it and I thought it was pretty good, almost like a dessert.  If I have to have acorn squash this is how I want it.  It was quick and easy too.

Didn't have raisins so used Craisins. Didn't have celery so used carrots. Pulsed everything together. It was fantastic! Can't wait to make again!  :)

I tried this recipe and not only me,but the three othr members of my family only liked the inside. The fruit was delisious, but the squash was sort of hard even though easily pressed. It taste even better if you cook it in the oven at 350 degrees for 15-20 min instead of using the microwave.

First, let me start by saying that I am not someone who especially likes squash.  I tend to avoid it.  However, I'm trying to branch out a little and try new recipes to take advantage of these gourds that seem to be so versatile! I forgot the celery and honestly probably would have left it out anyway.  This was so good!  I made it last night and I even had it as leftovers for lunch today!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Very simple and quite good, although next time I'd double the brown sugar and pumpkin pie spice.
