Very simple, don't worry about substituting butter for shortning, I did and it turned out great.  I made these as part of our big Thanksgiving and now I'm required to bring these for Christmas!

The BEST dinner roll! I made them into clover leaf rolls by placing three small dough balls into each muffin tin and allowing them to rise. They are beautiful and delicious. Don't require a ton on kneading like other yeast breads I've made.

I made a half recipe of these rolls. I made this recipe in my Kitchen Aid mixer. I let the yeast bloom with the warm liquids and sugar in the mixer bowl for ten minutes, then added the other ingredients. This dough needed an additional 1 cup flour to form into a solid ball. I then kneaded it with the dough hook for five minutes. After the second rise, I rolled the dough into heaping 1/4 cup balls and plopped them into my greased cast iron skillet, then covered them and set them to rise on my warm heating pad. After the second rise, I brushed them with melted butter. I got TEN rolls out of the halved recipe, not 12--but I did make them a little big. These rolls were perfect! They were light and fluffy and just wonderful. This absolutely was a success.

These were fabulous...right out of the oven.  We brought them to a dinner party (to be served w/soup) and they were dry and blah.  So, if you're going to eat these right away, they were very good - if not, look for something else.

These rolls were very good, the texture was very light and fluffy.  I halved the recipe, used butter instead of shortening and increased the salt.  Next time a tad more salt to suit our tastes.

Good rolls. I cut the recipe in half and it made 9 large dinner rolls. I also used country crock instead of shortening and they came out really good. The dough is very wet- I used almost another cup of flour during the kneading stage. Next time I will add honey to the dough to play up the sweet flavor. Will definitely make again.

Simple, and easy.  I am usually impatient when it comes to rising times, but the flavor really comes thru if you can sit tight!

This will be the staple recipe for dinner rolls now.  Absolutely easy to make with delicious flavor.  Excellent right out of the oven.  I was impressed by how well they kept and were still as good a couple days later.  I served it with a honey butter.

My mother-in-law said of these rolls, after I made them for Thanksgiving, "These are just like my mom's." You can't get better praise then that.I used butter flavor Crisco for the shortening which gave them a nice, buttery flavor.Will make again!

These were delicious and even survived the Thanksgiving day power outage that forced us to put the already raised rolls in the freezer for a couple of hours so we could bake them when the power was back on. A little less flavor than the breadmaker roll recipe I use.

Wow!  I love any type of bread, especially yeast bread/rolls.  I absolutely love this recipe.  I've made some minor adjustments by adding honey.  I've made the recipe 6 times in one month.  I made the rolls for all of my holiday events, everyone loved them, including my family.  When I make them I always leave just 4 at home, if I leave more we'll try to hurt ourselves eating them.  Excellent recipe!!

SO GOOD!!  Halved the recipe, used quick rise yeast but it took almost the full rise time, served w/ Shepherd's Pie.  Did "clover" rolls - after first rise, pulled off small pieces of dough, rolled into balls a little smaller than ping pong balls, greased a muffin tin, put 3 balls in each cup. Let rise about 25 mins, then baked 14 mins at 375. PERFECT.  So good, in fact, that I'm having one w/ honey butter right now instead of ice cream.  THAT good.

These were very good. I would definitely make them again. The only thing I would change is that they were a little too sweet. So I'd take out a little of the sugar and add some extra salt.

I made these rolls last night and was very pleased with how they turned out!  They tasted very good right out of the oven and my two year old kept going back and stealing more off the counter every time we turn our head.  I used better for bread flour, but next time I'll use regular unbleached.  Six cups destroyed my brand new bag.  I also brushed the tops of the dough with some melted butter right before I put them in the oven, just for a little buttery flavor and it turned out great.

Oh my goodness.!  I halved the recipe because it's just the two of us --- my husband ate most of them and declared they were the best rolls he'd ever eaten.  They smelled so good baking and I just love this recipe!  I'll be passing it on to my daughters, daughter-in-law and grand-daughters!  Thanks you so much, Colleen, for a blast from the past; they reminded me so much of my grandmother's rolls...yum!

Thank you for this awesome recipe! These turned out great. I measured out 7 cups of flour as someone suggested but put 1 cup to the side and stuck with the 6 for the mix. As I made the balls, I added a little bit as I went because the dough was too sticky. The outcome was fantastic! They were a HUGE hit today at Thanksgiving dinner! My family has already requested I make them again!

Everyone loved these buns!  I did end up having to put in apx 1.5 more cups of Canadian flour than the recipe called for.  I find Canadian flour has more gluten and bakes differently than the American bread flour. This is a huge recipe and it made 20 rolls plus 2 small loaves of bread.  I really wished I made all into rolls because they were the best ever!  Next time, I'm using the recipe for chelsea buns...can't wait!
Excellent recipe but it might need extra flour!

Fantastic!  I'm a total loser when it comes to making 'bread', 'dough' or any yeast product.  THIS is unbelievable!  Its easy-made AS WRITTEN.  Made 1/2 recipe first; now onto the full recipe today!  Light, fluffy; rises without problem.  THANK YOU!  I'm a bread maker now!

Delicious!  My husband is a health nut & hardly eats any white bread, period.  However, when i made these rolls he gobbled up 3-4 at the dinner table & stated this will be his cheat day!!  I halved the recipe and placed rounded dough about the size of golf balls touching one another in a pie plate.  Baked for about 16 min on bottom rack with pizza stone.  They didn't get too brown & the center rolls were a little under done (gooey) but we like em like that.  I also added an extra 1/4 tsp salt, used real butter, used all milk, and 2 eggs instead of 1 1/2 like the "halved" recipe called for.  I'll be making these again!

These came out very tasty but they needed A LOT more flour than called for- probably at least 3-4 cups. I would also add more salt next time.

I made these rolls for my family 1 night and they were all gone before i knew it. so i made them again and doubled the batch and the same thing happened. Great tasting and fluffy also.  the flour was off by at least a cup though they were way to sticky with just 6 cups. so the second time i added about 1/4 c of honey. and did not have to add more flour than the 7 cups i had to add with the original recipe. this added some sweetness to the roll which my family loves. im making rolls for my parents and best friend, i tried the second batch but between my hubby and kids they didnt make it even close to the door. but all in all i love this recipe and have and will continue to use it.

My family LOVED this recipe.  I'm a live-at-home college kid, and my "rent" is to make dinner.  I'm no expert baker, by any means, and I was looking for an easy dinner roll recipe-- basically one I couldn't screw up.  This was it!  My only suggestion is to really sift the flour, otherwise, like any bread, it turns out really dense.  I only sifted the first three cups of flour or so and got lazy with the rest.  My only change to the recipe was I melted butter on them before I put them into the oven which gave them a delicious crunch to the crust!

Fantastic!  I substituted the shortening with butter as well.  The dough was a little sticky but the key was to keep a small smattering of flour on it without over working it.  The finished product was light and airy.  I ended up using about 7 cups of flour in the end.  Depending on your elevation and levels of moisture in the air you can use more or less flour than this recipe calls for.  I will definately make it again.  It tasted like my grandma's bread and I've been dying to get that recipe for ages!

That is the closest recipe I have seen so far that is like what my Mom used to make all the time.  So light and perfect! I made 12 rolls and 1 loaf from it.

I did not like the flavor of the rolls, which is too bad because they were light and fluffy.  I made these along with another yeast roll and these barely got touched.

These were very good.  I was a little suprised after adding the 6th cup of flour the dough was still very wet and I would not have dumped it out to knead it.  I had to add about 1 1/2 more cups.  Next time I will also add about 1 tsp more salt.  Very good tasting though and I still give a 5 star.  I also used the rapid rise yeast and it worked fine.

This dinner rolls were quick and easy to make.   I divided the dough into 12 balls and baked in muffin pan lightly coated with cooking spray.   The rolls were slightly crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside.

I would definitely make this again. I did the recipe as instructed and turned out really really good. Lots of rolls and we did both formed rolls and clover leaf on the muffin pans - Highly recommend if it's your first time to have a thermometer to make sure the liquids are at the right temp :)

The recipe is too sticky and gooey. I had a hard time shaping the balls as a result. The crust is always too hard, but the inner portion is soft and delicious. The buns become hard a day or two after- so they are for immediate consumption.

Really tasty! I accidentally added too much sugar, and even though they were a little too sweet they were still great. I cut the recipe down for 12 servings and then made huge rolls for black bean burgers. It was perfect, and they puffed up beautifully for buns!

Good basic bread for beginners.  Easy rise, second rise was also easy.  Definitely needs more salt, by double.  Also more sugar.  The bread ends up fluffy but tasteless, even with butter.  Next time I'll use rosemary or roasted garlic.

Wonderful fluffy, melt in your mouth rolls. Easy to make if you are patient and let the rise the right amodunt of time. Ours didn't dry out over the three days they actually lasted. Great recipe. I used vegetable oil/canola oil instead of shortening and it didn't make a difference and was easier.

Yummy...fluffy! Delish! I used butter also, and they turned out great. It also took about a cup more flour than called for.  I made a loaf and 12 VERY BIG rolls...I will make a bigger pan of smaller next time. These were great!

Yummy! I did use butter instead of shortening. And I had to add an extra 1 1/2 cups of flour as well. No biggie. My family loved these rolls though. Hubby said they were second to my aunts rolls. That's a really big compliment from him! Very soft and fluffy and I loved the flavor. Thanks!

I really can't rate these because I never got to bake them.  The dough was so sticky that I could not work with it to shape them into rolls.  The dough ended up in the trash.  Six cups is definitely not enough flour for these rolls!  I'm surprised that more reviews didn't mention this.

I made these rolls on Thanksgoving day and they came out delicious! I had to substitute the milk with rice milk and for the shortening I used a vegan option and the rolls tasted really wonderful. I did need extra flour though.

Update 3/10/13: I've been making this recipe for three years. I changed the recipe when I gave up dairy and meat. My vegan version replaces the egg with "Ener-G" brand egg replacer. I replaced the cow milk with coconut milk. Immediately I thought they tasted better.

These were fantastic. The best rolls. I used 3/4 teaspoon salt, butter instead of shortening, cut the recipe in half, used two smaller large eggs. I made on Thanksgiving and formed them to read THANX. They were ready early so they had extra time to rise. The letters were huge. I've been looking for a replacement for the hamburger rolls my husband likes, because they aren't organic. I'm going to try to form these into hamburger rolls next time. I used a meat thermometer to check the water temp - never did that before. My usual hot tap water was hotter than the recommended temperature. I let cool to the perfect temperature before mixing with the yeast. I think these were my most successful yeast rolls ever.

Loved these rolls!  I followed the recipe exactly & they came out very good.  However, I would probably recommend halving the recipe as I had 12 people over and still had a ton of leftover rolls.

I'd give it 5 stars if I didn't end up having to add an extra cup to cup and 1/2 of flour every time. The taste is fabulous, it just eats a ton of flour.

Wonderful!  I made two different recipes for Easter.  This one and another. Both were excellent.  I used butter instead of shortening. Great texture and great taste.

delicious! i substituted fake butter for the shortening, and rice milk for milk, and fake egg mix for the eggs. I also halved the recipe, and somehow only got 6 rolls about the size of a small orange, and a mini baguette that would have made another 2 1/2 rolls maybe. I think I have to work on the rising stage, making sure the dough is moist instead of crusted over a bit.

These are amazing. Very chewy and soft and they definitely come out with a nice golden top. But what amazed me the most about these rolls is they keep really well. Usually rolls dry out after a couple of days even when kept in a sealed container. But 4 days later when I pulled these out of the bag they were still super tasty after a 25 second spin in the microwave. Definitely keepers! I just made these again and used bread flour because it was what I had and they turned out perfect again.

My family loved the rolls.  Even my mother loved them and she has an awesome recipe of her own she's been using for years. Thanks.  I'm making more tonight.

Very impressed.  I always seem to have a problem with my rolls when it comes time to rising!  However these came out absolutely perfect and so delicious!  This made right around 60 rolls and they saved great!

I am not the world's bes baker by any means. However, these rolls were easy to prepare, and quick. A last minute idea which will be a perfect cap to a family dinner. I did cut the recipe down, due to the amount needed, but, they still turned out great.

This was my first time making bread from scratch. Instead of kneading it myself, I used the dough hook attachment on my mixer and that worked well. I thought that the flavor of the bread could have used more salt and sugare.  The texture was perfect but the taste was a little "flat" to me. I will try again adding more salt/sugar.

Very good! I halved the recipe (used 2 eggs and used real butter instead of shortening)and got 20 beautiful cloverleaf rolls from it. Just be careful and lower the temperature and watch them because they got a little darker on the bottom from the muffin pan than I wanted but that was my fault, they tasted great.

I love these dinner rolls.  They come out light and soft.  
P.S. I don't like hard, dense sticky buns, so I use this recipes combined with a sticky bun recipes.

Texture lovely, color beautiful, but came out very bland tasting and rather dry - and I used less flour than the recipe called for!  Tried using a bit of the dough for a decorative loaf and my braided load came out just beautiful looking - should make a nice centerpiece.  I'm really disappointed in the taste, but hope to save them by pairing them with lots of honey butter.  I might give it one more shot another day and add some other ingredients for flavor.

I used this recipe for making rolls for Christmas dinner.  They were easy to make and turned out amazing!  I shouldn't have bothered with the turkey and all the trimmings - as everyone loved the rolls so much.  I served them with the butternut squash soup appetizer, and needed to make more a day later for the Christmas leftovers.  Great recipe!  Thank you.
