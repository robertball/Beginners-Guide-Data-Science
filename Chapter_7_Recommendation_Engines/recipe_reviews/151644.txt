Made these for thanksgiving dinner and they were a huge hit.  I used the sour cream option instead of the regular cream.  Everyone raved about the flavour in them.  We have a lot of people in our family on a low carb diet and they all had second helpings of the potatoes.  I also made these ahead of time and let them sit in the slow cooker to keep warm until dinner was ready...worked out great made for a less hectic kitchen!!!

Best mashed potatoes ever. Used sour cream in place of the light cream, and added a splash of milk.

There's nothing like creamy mashed potatoes!  It's comfort food at its best.  I never tried it with chicken broth before, I usually just did the traditional milk and butter stuff with maybe some sour cream mixed in to make them even creamier.  This was a nice alternative.  I used a bit more butter, half and half instead of cream, and added a bit of garlic powder.

I make these almost every Thanksgiving, only  using sour cream in place of the heavy cream.

Everyone always wants to know how I make them, but I'll never tell. ;)

but they were creamy and smooth! yum!

This is the best mashed potato recipe on this site that I've made so far!  I didn't have light cream so I used a quarter cup of milk plus a few tablespoons of sour cream and a few tablespoons of cream cheese.  Definitely good!

Just like it says, they are ultra creamy!  Great recipe that I will definitely make again.  I did not add any of the "twist" ingredients, just made the recipe as stated.  The only thing I did to the potatoes (something my mom taught me when I was young) is once you drain the potatoes, put them back in the pot and back on the burner that you've turned off.  Let it sit for about 30 seconds and then give the pot a shake.  Do this for a couple of minutes...it will take out the excess moisture in the potatoes so they do not get gummy when you mash them.  Works every time!

Good. I had to spice them up a bit with garlic & more butter. Also used evaporated milk. Good, basic mashed potato recipe. Thanks!

Doubled the recipe and it didn't come out right.  Used sour cream and milk instead of the light cream (like many suggested).  We had to add a lot of butter and garlic to salvage it...it ended up being ok.

Amazing potatoes- I don't have really any cooking experience and they were super easy to make.  I used light sour cream instead because it's what I found and it worked perfectly.  No more insta-mash for me :)

delicious! my boyfriend and I are both very picky when it comes to mashed potatoes, ever since I was a little girl I hated lumps with a passion, but as I don't have a mixer in my new apartment yet I was hesitant to make mashed potatoes. This recipe was a godsend, I plan on using it at least once a week!

Made these the day before Christmas for Christmas day, and they were awesome!  I added more cream than the recipe called for, and even more when I warmed them up for dinner.  Great recipe!!!

I followed the recipe exactly, including the "interesting twist" at the end.  Potatoes turned out perfectly cooked, and flavor was good, but very bland absent the optional sour cream, bacon bits, and chives.

Wow...so good and very creamy. Loved these! Used fat free/low sodium chicken broth and fat free half and half and also added some sea salt. I have never used chicken broth in mashed taters before even though I have always heard of it and been wanting to try. Served along side The Best Meatloaf and Garlicky Green Beans with Mushrooms both from this site. These were fantastic covered in rich brown gravey. Thanks!

Mine came out a little too mushy due to a slip of the hand when pouring the broth back into the potatoes, but they tasted phenomenal! I used the sour cream option for fewer calories- my sour-cream hating fiance couldn't taste it at all! Will make sure not to add so much broth back in next time!

I've always wanted to make those old fashion style of mash potatoes, that just look so fluffy and perfect, but had always had mine come out a little chunky (which my husband actually kind of likes), but this recipe was the key to my dream (lol). Its so much easier this way too! The broth just barely covers the potatoes, so the cooking time is split in half. I tried to cut the potatoes into 1/4 " equal sizes to further expediate the cooking process (totally worked, and helped them cook evenly), than put the potatoes in a heat proof bowl, mashed a way as directed, and they came out so easy, tasty, and idealic. A tip I read in one of Jamie Olivers cook books concerning mashed potatoes- and I use this all the time!- is if you need to keep them warm for a little longer because you're still cooking other components of the meal, put them in a heat proof bowl, wrap tightly with plastic wrap, then place over a small pot that is gently boiling. Keeps them nice and hot! But you dont want to keep them heated more than 30 minutes; otherwise they loose there fluffyness, and optimum taste.

I've made these potatoes twice now.  The first time I was low on broth and did not boil the potatoes in broth, but just added when mashing.  They were good and a do again.  The second time I boiled as directed in the broth and could not believe the difference it made.  The broth enhances the flavor emensely.  They were fabulous and I am doubtful I will ever make them anyother way.  I am making them again today for my New Years dinner :-)

This will now be my official mashed potato recipe!  They were amazing!  I made them exactly how the recipe was written, and the texture came out so smooth and creamy.  They were just as good warmed up the next day.

This was absolutely yummy!!  cutting the potatoes in pieces definitely speeds up the cooking process!  cooking in broth gives it more flavor-i would suggest either using low sodium broth or not adding as much salt to the mash.  I added about 7 cloves of garlic while boiling potatoes which softened the garlic and mashed perfectly in with the potatoes to make the perfect garlic mash!!  and the optional sour cream made it extra tastey!  great recipe and five stars! YUM!

Very good potatoes. Really creamy and rich. I used heavy (whipping) cream. Other than half and half, I'm not sure what light cream even is. We enjoyed these.

I've never cooked potatoes in broth before. They turned out great. Tender and flavorful. Used heavy cream and they whipped up into a soft cloud of creamy mashed potatoes. Really, really nice.

We LOVED these. I used milk not cream, and halved the amout and instead added a bit more of the broth. I used my hand blender to make them smooth and creamy. I also added garlic powder to the butter before blending it in. A tasty little classic.

I always boil my potatoes in chicken broth, adds so much to the flavor, if you don't have cream use evaporated milk, I do not use quite as much cream or milk I just watch the consistency

This recipe was interesting. I have never boiled the potatoes in broth before. I read a few of the reviews and realized a lot of the broth gets wasted. So, I just went for 2 cups. It just covered the potatoes, but it was fine because the pot gets covered and it doesn't evaporate. I give it to the recipe they are creamy potatoes. However, something seemed to be missing taste wise. I did add the generous amount of black pepper and I don't even care for it. Oddly even though the potatoes were boiled in broth with plenty of sodium I still thought they needed a pinch or so of salt after beating.

These potatoes were exceptional. Tried w/Yukon gold potatoes. Rich, creamy, &  flavorful. I've made them as the recipe states & also tried w/non fat milk, garlic & a touch of Parmesan cheese for a different flavoring. Always delicious

I have tried (unsuccessfully) to make homemade mashed potatoes for years. They usually turn out bland and lumpy. I decided to give it one more try with this recipe. YUMM-O! Super creamy! I used Yukon gold potatoes. Don't think I'll ever go back to instant! Thanks!

i followed this recipe using 2 potatoes and halving all the ingredients - i thought it was pretty tasty, but my husband said it didn't have a taste? i guess i will find a mashed potato recipe with more salt or garlic flavors? hmm.  i still think it's a good recipe.

After following the recipe for cooking the potatoes, I first added heavy cream with the butter to start mashing. I used the chicken broth last as needed to bring it to the consistancy I liked and give it flavor.

This was good, but not as creamy as i had hoped. Still a good basic recipe for mashed potatoes, but next time i will tweak it some.

This turned out horribly.  It had the consistency of Elmer's Glue, and there was no recovering no matter what I tried. Followed the recipe, but used half and half because I couldn't find any "light" cream.  Maybe that is what did it, though other reviewers claim they did the same and were fine.  Had to run  Boston Market for mashed potatoes for Thansgiving dinner- thank goodness they were open!!

I followed the recipe exactly and although they were tasty, they still needed salt (at least to our taste).  I used a hand masher, so they weren't quite as creamy as maybe a mixer would have made them...but still really good.

I loved this recipe!  The only thing I changed was I used homogenized milk instead of the cream.  The potatoes wer soooo fluffy and they remained soft and fluffy even though I didn't serve them for many hours after I had made them!

Light, fluffy, and flavorful! I've been trying out mashed potato recipes for a while and this is the first one that my husband has loved. We used it as a topping for shepherd's pie.

My changes were minimal. I left out the light cream and substituted with low fat sour cream.

I really liked this mashed potato recipe.  I have had trouble in the past with my mashed potatoes being too pasty so I thought I would look for a recipe that would resolve that problem for me and this recipe did the trick.  I made a couple substitutions, I used sour cream instead of the light cream and didn't have chicken broth on hand so I substituted chicken bouillon.  I will most definitely use this recipe again.  Thanks.

I made these last night for our pre-Thanksgiving feast, they were wonderful but I'm not so sure the boiling in broth is as necessary as putting broth in them after you cook the potato's for the flavor, regardless it's a wonderful recipe and everyone went back for more!

Outstanding twist on my favorite all-time side starch.  Mixed and mingled all suggestions. Used six med. potatoes, 3 chix boullion cubes for the broth.  3 tablespoons cream cheese, 4 strips bacon, 1/2 cup sour cream, 1/2 cup half-n-half, 1/3 cup reserve broth, 1/4 stick butter, black pepper and garlic powder.  And threw in a sweet potato I had made the previous night just for kicks.  Delicious!

Very good, I did use some already prepared vegetable broth to boil the potatoes in, then added bought chicken broth.  I also use WHITE pepper only - works so much better than black with potatoes, brussel sprouts, etc.

I am a novice cook. I used whole milk and sour cream in place of cream and it was bland. The chicken broth was a waste of money, and the boiling time was not long enough.

First off, let me just say that I've been searching for a very long time for the perfect mashed potatoes recipe that had the perfect flavor. And this is it!! The only thing I did was add a little onion powder, garlic powder, and some ranch seasoning mix. Added the perfect amount of flavor and it was delicious! So delicious I had to share.

There's something about cooking the potatoes in broth that makes a difference.  I only had half and half on hand, which was not a noticeable substitution for the light cream.  A dash of salt was needed, as well as a bit more butter.  To mine I added the chives as suggested, and a teaspoon of crushed garlic which was not.  Still, you can't beat the versatility and creaminess of this dish.

This was delish... I didnt use any butter because I used heavy whipping cream (all I had on hand) and I didnt have any canned/boxed chicken broth but I had chicken paste type stuff that you add to water.  Very good taste and texture.

I omitted the cream and added just a splash of milk, I also used 3/4 cup of the broth.  Fantastic!!!  I went with the optional bacon and cut the butter to 1 TSP.  Will be making this for all the traditional holidays from now on.

These were really good. Boiling the potatoes in chicken broth really makes a difference in the flavor. I did add some salt just for extra flavor but these mashed potatoes didn't really need much else. Great recipe. Will use again.

Awesome recipe and so easy!  I bumped up the servings to 10 people and served for our Christmas Dinner.  The Chicken Broth definitely adds a lot more flavor.  I added about 1.5 cups of a Tri-Cheddar Cheese Blend and all three of our children loved it and asked for more!!!

So good. I can never get a good creamy taste with 1% milk and the cream cheese helped. Even one my kids, who hate mashed potatoes, ate it!

I saw this recipe after I already boiled my potatoes so I put broth, some milk and heated and then added to potatoes this way I didn't need nearly as much broth and the same delicious results!

I didn't have light cream, but it wasn't a problem. The only extra thing I added to the basic mixture was the sour cream, it made for such great tasting mashed potatoes! Served this with gravy baked pork chops...was a hit with my hubby and son :D

I had yet to make any mashed potatoes that I really liked. I grew up eating super creamy mashed potatoes and loved them, but every recipe I have tried has been somewhat watered down. I tried this recipe and substituted low fat sour cream for the cream. It was very tasty, but still not as creamy as I would have liked. Next time I will try using a bit more sour cream. This recipe is a keeper!

These are outstanding! I let them cook in the broth until the broth had almost completely been absorbed by the potatoes and they were perfect. So much flavor from the broth and cream, you don't need nearly as much butter as typical recipes! This will be my new go-to recipe for amazing potatoes!

These were simply delicious! I used red potatoes instead, mostly because they were what I had on hand, and then I used two cans of chicken broth, with about two cups of water (To completely cover the potatoes) I boiled them covered for about twenty minutes instead, and then I I added 1/3 cup heavy cream, and 1/4 cup milk instead of the 1/2 cup light cream. They were so creamy, and amazing! My husband even ate them without gravy! This is going to be my new mashed potato recipe!

Very delicious! Didn't add THAT much broth and they were still really creamy. I think next time I will even cut down a little more considering I like them a little thicker.

I made this last night with sloppy joe's.  My son who normally doesn't eat mashed potatoes devoured it.  I didn't have gr. onions on hand.  They'll be even better next time with the gr. onions. He asked me to make again.

I didn't really like the flavour with these cooked in the chicken stock. They were ok but not that great. I added the sour cream and used milk instead of the light cream. Maybe it really needs cream to make it good?
