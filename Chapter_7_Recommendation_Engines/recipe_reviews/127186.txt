I actually ended up changing this recipe a bit. I didn't have the proper pumpkin spice mix so I just added cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg. Didn't have pecans, so I used almonds. To make it more like pumpkin pie I used pumpkin puree instead of apple sauce. Found I had to bake it longer than the recipe showed, but it continued to dry after I removed it from the oven. It has excellent pumpkin flavour with the puree in there and the whole family loved it. Will definitely make this time and time again! Don't be afraid to play around with the recipe.

One of our favorite granola recipes!  I do bake at 300 instead of 250 and stir about every 10 min until lightly browned, then it only takes about 40 minutes or so.  One tip I've learned is granola gets crunchier after it cools!

This is very tasty granola! My little siblings were eating straight out of the pan; they love it! One change I made was to substitute canned pumpkin (mixed with 2 tbs. of milk) for the applesauce. I was really looking forward to making this, because it sounds like such a unique and delicious recipe. I was a little disappointed, however, that it really didn't taste a whole lot like pumpkin pie. That is why I am giving it four stars. It is a very easy, healthy, and tasty granola, though. Do not hesitate to try this! Just don't expect it to taste a whole lot like pumpkin pie!

It took all of my power to to rate this while I was cooking it. It made my apartment smell sooooo GOOD!! Smell aside, this is a terrific granola recipe. This is the first time I've made granola, so after browsing through all the other recipes I decided to try for this one, since it didn't use oil. SO happy I did! I read the other reviews and decided to compromise with the oven at 275. It took a little longer to cook, 1 hour 15 minutes, but after letting it sit, it became much more crunchy and I decided I may have overcooked it very slightly. I also used walnuts instead of pecans because that's what I had on hand.  Added a few dashes of cinnamon as well. Other than that stayed true to the recipe, and so glad I did. While it didn't really taste much like pumpkin pie, the flavors worked so well together, it didn't seem to matter! No more expensive store bought granola for me!

I took larkspur's tip and used Trader Joe's pumpkin puree instead of applesauce. I did not use dried cranberries because I do not have any. This was so simple to make and it turned out fantastic! All three of us (my two sons and myself) thought this was one of the best granolas we've ever had. I made this early this morning and let it cool and we had it for breakfast an hour later so it was nice and fresh and crunchy. I have about a cup leftover that I stuck in Tupperware, I'll update my review if it turns out that it's less not as good the next day. I don't think of pumpkin pie when I eat it but it does make me think of fall/winter. I'll make this again--next time I'll try this with applesauce and my homemade apple pie spice.

I was out of applesauce, but had lots of fresh pureed pumpkin, so used that in its place!  And, it gave more of a genuine pumpkin flavor to the granola.  I was also out of the dried cranberries, so subbed in golden raisins, which worked fine.    Good stuff, esp during the Christmas season!

Excellent recipe! I didn't have regular oats and I ended up using quick-cooking. They didn't get crunchy like the recipe name suggests, but the flavors were awesome! Very good on top of yogurt, very good plain as a snack!

Follwed this recipe exactly, crunchy when I made it last night....but softer today....it lost its crunch....flavor is good though...I may even add more cinnamon next time. This is a good recipe and I love the applesauce factor in this vs. oil that most granola recipes call for. I will try this again, add cinnamon and maybe bake at a higher temp. Thanks!

Wonderful granola! I used 5 grain plus flaxseed whole grain cereal (Bob's Red Mill) & added dried apples and used walnuts instead of pecans.  I also turned the oven up to 300 degrees the last 20 minutes.

I may never buy store bought granola again!  This is a great recipe & I love how easy it was to make.  Instead of regular applesauce, I used the cinnamon stuff because that is what we had.  Baked this at 300 degrees on the convection setting for 1 hour & it came out just right.  LOVE the flavors!!!  Yeah, it doesn't really taste like pumpkin pie, but it is still sooo good.  It smells awesome while it is baking too!  For my own personal preferance I think next time I will skip on the cranberries & add just up the raisins, but that is just to suite my own personal taste.  Thanks bg for such a great recipe!!

I made this recipe exactly as written! It is super tasty granola and it does smell great baking! My friends and I all decided that it tastes more like apple pie than pumpkin pie!  It is great with and without raisins. I recommend adding the raisins/dried cranberries as you use it, rather than storing the granola with the fruit in it (I think that may be the cause of it turning soft quickly, as some reviewers complained).  I will try it next time with pumpkin puree to see if I can make it more like pumpkin pie, but if you can settle for apple pie granola...this recipe is awesome!

This was yummolicious!!!!! What didn't get burnt anyways. I also subbed pumpkin puree for applesauce an added 2 TBSL of skim milk to compensate. The pieces that weren't overbaked had a spicey, yummy flavor, mmm. This was my first time making granola, an without oil!!! I'm going to use this as my base from now on. Next time I plan to use maple syrup. THANK YOU so much.

Make this!!!! It's a great recipe. I didn't think you could make granola without any oil, so I have to say I was skeptical (I added a couple teaspoons but probably didn't need to). This smells amazing baking, and you can adapt it to taste easily.  I added a few tbs of pumpkin puree, my own mix of ginger, cinnamon and nutmeg, and did almonds, craisins, raisins, and chopped apricot plus wheat germ and flax meal.  It's really no fail, just make sure you stir it in the oven so it doesn't burn.  I'm hoping it stays crunchy b/c some people said that it got soft after a day!

This was an excellent garonla recipe.  I like the fact that is didn't have oil but applesauce.  I made this recipe plain by omitting the nuts and raisins.  My kids love it plain.  We put this garonla with yogurt and fresh fruit or we munch on it just  by itself. The first time I made it, I did bake it for an hour but I think that was too long as the garonla hardened even more once it was cooling, I will try 45 mintues next time.  Overall great garonla!

This is a pretty good recipe for a reduced fat granola. Love the pecans! Not the nut once commonly sees in granola. I use this granola on yogurt to make it more palatable - does the trick.

It was a nice recipe, I used pumpkin puree instead of applesauce, and a mix of cranberries and blueberries dried. It is really good, a nice size recipe too, the house smelled fabulous. Thanks!

Like others have said, not sure about the "pumpkin pie" part BUT using the applesauce instead of oil is OUTSTANDING.  I'll cut out one of the nuts next time to keep the calories down.

This was my first granola making experience, and I'm quite proud of the results!  I didn't have applesauce on hand and using it over oil was the primary reason I used this recipe.  I pureed apples in the blender instead and it worked perfectly.  I also used agave instead of honey and baked it at 275.  It doesn't really taste like pumpkin pie, but it's delicious, nonetheless!  I left out the fruits so I can add whatever I feel like the day I'm eating it.  Great recipe!

This was a good base recipe for me. I used walnuts instead of pecan (what I had) no cranberries and apple pie spice instead of the pumpkin. I thought since it called for applesauce, why not spice? The flavor was excellent. My problem was that the oats remained single, didn't "clump" up with the nuts. I thought it was a ltad overcooked a full hour. Could have been that my oven is gas. I will make again with adjustments. Double the brn sugar, applesauce, vanilla and honey. Add 1/2 cup more oats to balance. My family really liked flavor.  I would say try it if the description fits.

Applesauce has gives granola the same texture as water does - moist. =/ I like the crisp & crunch that oil provides.

I omitted the fruit and added shredded unsweetened coconut. It turned out splendidly. I also had to cook it considerably longer than the recipe called for, but it was worth the wait. You would NEVER guess that this didn't have oil in it. However, as other reviewers mentioned, the pumpkin pie spice didn't make it taste like pumpkin pie at all.

Did not like this. Followed recipe exactly and it was bland. After baked at 250 for 1 hour it still wasn't crispy (after letting it cool for 3 hours) so I had to put it back in the oven. Won't be making this again.

I enjoyed this recipe. Does not taste like pumpkin pie but has that nice pumpkiny spice. I followed the advice of some other reviewers and turned the heat up to 300 for the last 20 minutes. I would not recommend doing this, as the granola came out a little too crunchy. If it doesn't seem crisp enough after 1 hour at 250, I would just let it bake a few minutes longer. Also, I used all craisin's for the fruit.

I used canned pumpkin in place of applesauce, and the pumpkin adds a fruity note just as I would expect from applesauce. You won't notice that there is no butter or oil in this recipe--it's crunchy and just what a granola should be.

Yummy, crunchy, addictive! Can't tell it's lowfat! I used only a few tablespoons of brown sugar, and I used 4.5 cups of oats instead of oat/nut blend (I'm lazy, and this is less caloric). Sugar free syrup instead of honey worked great. Also, no vanilla necessary. Sorry for rating a recipe with substitutions, but these are super similar to the actual recipe, so I think my rating is valid.

This was pretty good. I couldn't really taste the pumpkin pie spice, so if I made it again I'd definitely up the spice. It also didn't really clump at all, so it was just loose oats, which I didn't care for. It also burned a little bit. I might make it again, but probably not.

Delicious and so easy. This recipe is easy to change up. I used walnuts in place of pecans because I did not have the latter.

Lots of pumpkin pie spice flavour.
I used pumpkin seeds because that's what I had and they were good. A little sweeter than I like. I'd definetly make again but reduce sugar.

I made this recipe using Libby's Pumpkin Pie Mix - the sweetened stuff. By decreasing the honey slightly, it made for a great substitution for the applesauce and REALLY amped up the pumpkin theme. This is some great granola, yum!

I love this! So delicious and super easy to make. As others have suggested, I used puréed pumpkin in place of the applesauce (with excellent results). I also added pepitas and roasted, unsalted sunflower seeds as well as the pecans and almonds. Everything in this is healthy, so you can feel good about indulging. Paired with yogurt, it's a real treat! Thank you for this great recipe.

Hubby made & thinks it is a 5, I would say a 4.  It is very filling so can't eat much at a time. Hubby says this is the best granola recipe we have & I do agree. Will make again. Didn't change a thing, but may add a little more cranberries just because we love them.

Update 2019 review: I have now made many batches of granola using other recipes and decided to revisit this one and tweak it a bit. It's not crunchy because the applesauce replaces the oil that is normally there; so I used 1/2 cup applesauce and 1/4 cup oil and got the crunchy texture I wanted. I also added 1/2 tsp salt to bring out more flavor. 
Those changes did it for me! I also, because of what I had on hand, substituted pumpkin seeds for the slivered almonds and dried sweet cherries for the raisins/cranberries, and these both worked great.

Original 2015 review: I followed the recipe exactly, and yeah, there's not a lot of pumpkin flavor. It probably would be better to substitute pumpkin puree for the applesauce. Also I didn't love the texture; my regular granola is made with maple syrup, and that gets much crunchier than this granola did. It probably would be better over yogurt as one reviewer suggested, but I don't find it very satisfying as a standalone breakfast. It did smell amazing in the oven!

I made this yesterday.  Instead of baking in the oven, I cooked it in my crock pot (which I've also done with another granola recipe).  I used a crock pot bag and a vented lid from one of my regular pots instead of the glass crock pot lid.  I let it cook on high for 2-3 hours, turned it down to low, removed the lid, and let it cook for probably another hour.  I stirred it a couple times during the cooking process.  It did have a crunchiness to it even though I made it in the crock pot.  I added the craisins and raisins after it was done cooking per the directions.  Flavor-wise I wasn't wowed.  I have a cherry almond granola recipe (Light and Tasty  magazine; here's the link for anyone interested http://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/cherry-almond-granola) that I like better so I probably won't make this particular recipe again.

I only used almonds. Didn't put honey in it, as a friend is deathly allergic to it, only used brown sugar.  I am a granola and pumpkin spice fan - the two together? What can go wrong! Very tasty!!

I have been trying different recipes for this Thanksgiving feast and this recipe is awesome but instead of using pumpkin purée I used sweet tators (cooked them like I was making a pie) using allspice, cinnamon, nutmeg, etc and no applesauce. Added 1 tsp of sweet chili powder and toasted my pecans, almonds and walnuts. Stirred and cooked accordingly. Then I drizzled more honey on top of mixture and made into small bite size balls. You can play around with this recipe and no one person would ever be disappointed. Thanks for the recipe

I love this recipe I have used this recipe a bunch of times and its great! The reason I gave this recipe four stars was because the pumpkin pie spice flavoring just did not seem to go well.  I omit the pumpkin pie spice flavoring and use cinnamon and nutmeg instead which is close. I would highly recommend making a big batch on this one its delicious!

This was really tasty and makes a good cereal or a snack. However, I would cut back on the baking time. It seemed like even 45 minutes made it too crunchy for me.
