Thank you for this recipe! Tried it for the mochi only (so no ice cream) and it turned out really nicely. For anyone considering using this recipe, just make sure you're really generous with the rice flour/corn starch on the counter. Thanks again! :)

Turned out great! Followed the recipe to the t.  I made my push matcha icecream to wrap the mochi around.   My husband has been to Japan and China so this was a huge hit for him

I love mochis! Asians are naturally lovers of this kind of desserts. I think steamer is a good option other than microwave.

Love the recipe, but I think my microwave is too strong. What kind of microwave did you use? I have a 1250watt.

Thank you

Good recipe for mochi, but the ice cream bit was a complete failure for me. The mochi is too fragile (easily torn) to stretch around the balls, especially if you try to roll it out as thin as this calls for.
 The mochi itself came out nicely, though. Maybe a bit too much matcha powder, though.

Nice recipe, but I needed a LOT more than 1 tbsp of corn starch for my rolling pin and surface. Still, once the dough was cool enough to handle and everything was covered generously in starch, it was easy enough to cut and roll. (I used a pizza cutter,  blade rolled in starch first, to cut the pieces.) However it took someone with perhaps more nimble fingers to seal the edges smoothly and shape the balls nicely. Mine came out kind of ugly, but with more practice I think they'll look better. I might use matcha ice cream next time for more matcha loveliness. Or maybe chocolate, hmm...
