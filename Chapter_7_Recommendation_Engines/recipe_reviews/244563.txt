This was really good. The flavors melded together nicely. The test of a great recipe is how many leftovers I have, and we had none. I held the wine and served it on rice. We will definitely be making this again soon.

I hate having to only use 2Tblsp. Of paste out of the can & then trying to figure out what to do with the rest of the can, so after cooking it for a while, I added the rest of the tomato paste that was in one of those little cans & continued cooking the remainder  of the time. Other than that & having  to use 2 skillets instead of one, to fit everything in with the chicken too, I really liked this recipe. I definately will be making it again. I paired it with a penne, pepperoni & cheese pasta & the sauce form this was an added addition to the pasta.all around, a very good recipe.

This was delicious and my husband and daughter gulped it up even though I did not add any mushrooms, added 2 tbsp of capers and used basil instead of parsley at the end.  I think it is difficult to go wrong with this dish.   Served over rice, it is a delicious and simple meal.

This was very good and next time I will have to add a little more broth to it and maybe some more of the tomato paste.  I used chicken thighs because that is all I had and served it over rice.  I also added some seasoned salt and ground black pepper to give it more flavor.

love this recipe.  used one large pot vs. two skillets, tomato sauce vs. paste, and served with rice noodles. pretty popular in our home.
