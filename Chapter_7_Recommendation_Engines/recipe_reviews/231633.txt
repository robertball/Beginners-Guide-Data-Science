DELICIOUS! I made the dressing earlier in the day, omitting the egg (I just couldn't, lol), but adding in a little extra olive oil...the flavors fo the dressing are fantastic. Also, I forgot to buy croutons at the store, so I made my own, which made this that much better. Loved the mushrooms and bacon in this, as well. I think maybe next time I would add some fresh grated parm. cheese, but other than that, this was wonderful~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

i omitted the egg and used more Parmesan in the dressing than in the end. it came out very well with some chicken marinated in Balsamic Vinegar fried up in a little olive oil.

Omitted the egg, skipped the bacon (a few vegans at the table) and it was still fabulous. The dressing is excellent! Made croutons with the Garlic Crouton recipe on this site which I highly recommend.  Only change I'd make next time is maybe go with a half teaspoon of pepper rather than the full teaspoon.  Thank you for a great salad!

This is a very good salad, but it is NOT a Caesar salad - not with all the other ingredients a true Caesar salad doesn't have - bacon, mushrooms, etc.

I've never put  mayo in my caesar  dressing, nor a POUND of bacon, and no onions, but I DO use capers  and anchovies sparingly. By the way, I think you HAVE to have dijon mustard in there, or is that just my secret ingredient...A teaspoon of salt is a LOT, and you forgot the pepper. Where on earth do you get a "pasteurized" egg? It's supposed to be raw. And you forgot the parmesan, which all Caesar salads have. Actually, I wouldn't try this as it is described here.

This is a great recipe but as usual, I added extras: boiled eggs, parmesan and jalapeno cheeses.

I will say that I am not fond to salads at all. I want to share something with us (Yes, I included). Take off any extra ingredients to the original recipee, only add an very done avocado. I am from Caracas, Venezuela and Graduated from University of Houston, very proud ! Delicioso!!
