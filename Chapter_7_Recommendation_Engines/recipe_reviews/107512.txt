really tasty! I only give it 4 stars because I modified it a bit. I used frozen mexican corn with blackbeans and added a little chili seasoning. It was aweswome!  I did have to heat it longer and hotter than the recipe called for but it all came together in the end. a definite keeper!

This dip is quite good, but the fat count is just off the charts...2 sticks of butter!  Yikes!
Here's what I do:
I used just 1/2 stick of butter, (unsalted,) and I also use the lower fat cream cheese, (Neufchatel.)  I also put the canned tomatoes into the food processor and pulse it a bit, to chop up the tomatoes, and give more consistency to the tomatoes when they are in the dip.
I use frozen corn, as other do.  I just zap it in the micro for about a minute or two.  If you can't find white corn, yellow frozen corn works fine.

Made on the stovetop because I didn't have an hour to wait for it to cook in the slow cooker. This is good, but would be better with some spice added to it, like sliced pickled jalapenos. I added some onion to it and topped it with sliced jalapenos. Great dip, I used it as a side dish for nachos and tacos.

Loved it with my changes. I've made this LOTS of times and always get asked for my recipe. First of all, I completely eliminate the butter. You don't need it!  Partially drain the rotel, use just regular corn (usually use bag of frozen, just because that's what I have on hand), and MOST IMPORTANT - add chopped pickled jalapeños.  Usually at least a half of a cup, but easy to make hotter or milder. Delicious!!!

Very tasty!  I used half the butter and added a few dashes of cayenne as we thought it needed more heat.  Next time I will drain the Rotel, as it is a bit runny.  We really liked the texture the corn added.  Not what you usually find in a dip. Will for sure make again and again!

I made a half recipe because this makes a lot! I couldn't find white corn so I used yellow. I used salsa instead of tomato, added a bit of shredded Tex mex cheese and a few chopped green onions. Delicious!

Wasn't bad, wasn't great. Nobody had anything bad to say but nobody ate it. So, I added more Rotel and chopped up some jalapeños. They still didn't like it. Strange since they all love corn.

Good stuff with tortilla chips. I threw everything into a casserole dish in the oven at 350 and just let it chill while I prepared the rest of dinner. I did add a good bit of cilantro it just felt right and used canned corn because that's what I had on hand but with the many varieties of Rotel available these days you could make all kinds of flavor combinations.

I did not like this. It was overpowered by butter.  The flavor was not pleasant either. I would not make again.
