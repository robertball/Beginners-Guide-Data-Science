Beans knock this out low-carb consideration, but in particular black beans, among the highest in carbs.

I'm so sorry, but this recipe just wasn't for us. It was too heavy on the tomato paste taste. And with only 1/2 tsp. chili powder, it just didn't have enough chili flavor. I added more seasonings but couldn't salvage it.

I made this with a few modifications. I used 2 TBSP of chili powder (not 1/2 tsp); I used 2 cans (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes, I DID NOT use tomato sauce OR tomato paste. We liked it with theses changes.

can use green beans for the black beans. Way to much tomato paste.

It is okay.  I added more meat and didn't add hot sauce.  The celery doesn't really go so much with it.  Needs more chili powder or seasonings.

A fast and simple basic chili. I only used one can of tomato paste, based on other reviews, and it does have a very strong presence in the dish. I may play around to see what I can do to cut the taste of that. Efficient, but just ok.

much more chile powder and added cumin. i used salsa instead of tabasco, but next time I will add franks and see. I really don't believe it's low carb so I took out tomato paste & sauce and just used whole tomatoes. Can't find any nutrition info, so I'm guessing
