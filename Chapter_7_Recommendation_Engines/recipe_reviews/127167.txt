soooo good.. made for a dinner party and everyone loved it! I used roasted pecans, pom, red onion and feta cheese. I made a dressing ( balsamic with honey, salt and pepper...mixed well then add a bit of olive oil ) and it was great with it! Plus be sure you dont drain the pom seeds and add the juice on top of the salad! Yummy!!

I made this for Christmas last year and it was beautiful.
It's easy to remove the pomigranate seeds if you place it in a dish of water and remove the seeds underwater.  This prevents them from popping out on the counter and floor.
The red and green presentation of this salad is very elegant.

I toast the walnuts first.  The best dressing for this is if you can find pomegranate molasses and whisk in some EVOO, little sugar and a dash of S & P.  You can also buy pomegranate seeds already cleaned and ready at Trader Joes!

A great combination of ingredients!  My store was out of my favorite spinach, so I used a spring mix instead.  I also skipped the sprouts.  I used the Balsamic Vinaigrette recipe from this site and it was a superb salad!  One suggestion would be to toast the walnuts.

Easy, pretty to look at and delicious! I loved the crunchy texture the walnuts and pomegranate seeds added. Next time I think I would divide all the toppings into two halves so that I could toss a bit of it all together and then top artfully with the rest. This recipe's a keeper!

Love this recipe!  Most recently, I was unable to find pomegranates out-of-season, so I had to do a last-minute substitution of mandarin oranges.  Was delicious and colorful too!

this was a hit in our house!!  i think you could serve it with or without the feta, but i'm not a big fan of feta cheese.  i served my salad with a homemade vinaigrette which i based off of "balsamic vinaigrette" on this site. Mix together the following ingredients and let sit for a little while to allow flavors to work together: 1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil, 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1 clove crushed garlic, 1 tsp ground mustard, 1 pinch salt, black pepper to taste, and 3 TB honey

We love this salad.  I make variations on it:
 - substitute Craisins or sliced strawberries for the pomegranate 
- substitute chevre goat cheese for the feta
-substitute almonds or pecans

Add a grilled chicken, salmon fillet or juicy steak and you've got a fabulous meal!

A taste sensation! I LOVE this salad! 

For Thanksgiving I made Candied Walnuts and added them to the recipe and it was even better!

I love the different flavors together in this salad.

This salad is FANTASTIC!! Both my husband and I loved it and plan on making it again very soon.  Didn't use the sprouts and didn't really measure anything out... Just grabbed a handful of the ingredients and threw them in a salad bowl and voila!  The one thing that I did change or alter is that I soaked the red onion in ice water to soften the flavor a bit.

This salad was excellent, I made it to go along with our Christmas Eve dinner.  For the vinagirette I used juice and zest from a half a lemon, 3 TBL of red wine vinegar, 1 TBL of honey and 3 TBL of olive oil.  Seeding the pomegranate was pretty easy.  I just quartered it and then inverted each quarter and the seeds easily popped out. Everyone loved it.

I took this to a dinner with my girlfriends and it was not a hit.  The pomegranate seeds did get some attention, though.  It'd make a nice salad around Christmas time, given the red, green and white colors.

Made this for a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it.  
Now to be honest, I didn't follow it exactly.  I made the balsamic vinaigrette http://allrecipes.com/recipe/balsamic-vinaigrette/detail.aspx
I added shredded cheddar, because I didn't have any feta on hand.  I skipped the onion and walnuts for the same reason.  I also used a bag of organic power greens (spinach, kale, chard).  
So, I guess I didn't make this recipe at all...I suppose I am saying I like it because I had everything I needed and it tasted good.  Are there any other qualifiers?   :0)

This is a wonderful salad. It is so fresh and great in the winter. I made it this Christmas and last. Even my daughter who does not like salad loves this one. Tonight we used craisens instead; it was fine but better with pomegranate seeds.

Great salad! I like to turn this into a full meal by adding grilled chicken. I don't like onions so I replace them with clementine slices, which makes the salad nice and sweet with the pomegranates. I also like to add candied walnuts/pecans instead. Fantastic!

I added grape tomatoes, mushrooms, glazed walnuts instead of plain walnuts, some snips of green onion, and added fresh pomegranate juice to the balsamic vinegar.  My guests loved it!  What a beautiful Christmas salad! dlbradow

This salad is delicious, filling & beautiful!     DEFINITELY toast the walnuts first. Simple- five minutes on the stovetop with a touch of oil, & so worth it.     And I also made a balsamic vinegar/honey/oil mix for dressing, with a touch of salt & pepper.     I will make this many times in the future- I really enjoyed it!!

My substitution was cranberries instead of pomegranates, but either way it would be a 4. The amount of ingredients is good, nothing is overpowering. I did brown the onions though because we are not big onion fans.

This was a great recipe. I didn't have any sprouts so I omitted them. I added bacon instead. I chopped 4 strips of bacon and then added red wine vinegar to pan after the bacon was crisp. I then let the vinegar dissipate to about half the original amount and poured it over the salad. The heat from the dressing blended very nicely with the feta and gave the dressing a creamy quality. I will definitely be making this again!

It turned out that pomegranates aren't in season anymore, so I replaced the pomegranates with blackberries and raspberries. I brought this to a potluck and it went over pretty well.

This is a great salad! I did however, add thinly sliced anjou pear and chopped, sauteed turkey bacon to offset the bitter taste in the pomegranate. Even my 3 year old loved it.

I made this salad for lunch today and it was delicious. Although I used olive oil instead of a balsamic vin. Such a healthy meal or even snack.

Fabulous salad and easy to make, except for seeding the pomegranate. My daughter said it took her about 15 minutes to seed it. This is a keeper, and is the perfect Christmas salad. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great salad, has become a favorite in our house.  I switched the red onion with 3 sliced green onions (white and green part) and took out the walnuts - it still tasted GREAT!

The taste and the VISUAL are both important with salads.  This one has good blend of colours as well as flavourful.  Easy but looks a little special.

I made this salad for a pre-holiday dinner party and it was a big success! Very delicious with a variety of textures and flavors. My husband said his “taste buds were dancing”. I used half spinach, half spring mix, and goat cheese, along with all the other listed ingredients. Definitely five stars!

I made this pretty salad for Christmas dinner. I used 15 oz of spinach, soaked the red onion slices in ice water for 15 minutes (to mellow them out), dressed the salad (using a balsamic vinaigrette recipe from this site, and then plated it. Delicious!

Delightful flavor and so pretty!  Served at Thanksgiving with a Balsamic, honey vinaigrette-everyone commented and requested the recipe.  No sprouts and I used candied pecan bits (salad toppings in the produce section).  Used POMS and now I've been requested to do for a wedding for 100!  Really like this fresh, new salad!

This is an awesome salad and I have a great easy dressing for it too...equal parts of sugar, canola oil and Red Wine Vinegar.  Make as much or as little as you like but I usually do 1/3, 1/3 a 1/3.  Let it sit in the fridge for at least 4 hours, occasionally stirring before using!  Delish!  :)

I made this superb salad to accompany a lamb/date tagine, which had a red onion & pomegranate relish on the side *(salad continued with the pomegranate theme!).  Let me tell you, everyone loved it, including me (this, from a person who turned her nose up at spinach!).  Thank you for posting.?

This was good and so pretty to serve!  I felt the toppings were a bit too heavy and all fell to the bottom .. so in the end, we were left with lots of toppings and no spinach!  Otherwise, it looked and tasted great!

I just served this for 5 girlfriends of mine and it was fabulous!  They all raved about it.  I didn't use the alfalfa sprouts, but I did almost everything else as directed (except maybe shorted the onion a bit, I wasn't really reading the directions at that point).  I also used glazed pecans rather than walnuts because I prefer them.  The pomegranate was an interesting and tasty touch, and they all commented on it.  Very easy to make, even though the pomegranate seemed daunting, it ended up being really easy.  I would definitely recommend this recipe.  Also, I found online if you have extra pomegranate seeds, they go wonderfully with vanilla ice cream for dessert!

We didn't have alfalfa, but even without it, it was a beautiful refreshing change.  I made my own balsamic dressing.  It makes a gorgeous salad for the holidays.

As the other reviewers said, this is EASY and DELICIOUS. We didn't have the nuts, so I omitted them. I also did as suggested and whipped up a quick balsamic vinegar/ honey dressing with canola oil. Do try this recipe.

This was a fine salad, but nothing earth shattering.  I didn't add feta since I was serving vegans, so that could have made it better.

Was looking for pomegranate recipes and came across this one.  Unbelievably I had everything on hand.  Stopped looking at my laptop and made it.  My husband, 10 year old daughter and I are munching on it right now!  I didn't have regular walnuts so I used black walnuts.  Will definitely make again and next time I will add grilled chicken strips. mmmm

Mixed in some baby romaine for the non spinach lovers and kept feta on the side for non feta lovers but everyone liked it and some teens even went back for seconds.

This salad turned out GREAT! Although..I didn't use any alfalfa or onion. and I made a pomeganate vinegarette instead of the suggested balsamic vinegarette.  I brought it to a school potluck and it was a big hit even for those who were not sure about the pomegranate. =) YUM!
