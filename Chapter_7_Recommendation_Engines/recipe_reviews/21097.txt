Mas Harina I found out is: Corn Flour.  This is finer than corn meal.

This is so delicious! It is exactly like the sweet corn cake the mexican chain restarants, like El Torito, serve. Usually I buy the mix at the store and make that, but this is so much better. I served it with enchiladas and rice and beans, and it was a big hit. 

For the masa harina, I read the other reviewer state that what this is, is corn flour. So instead of going out and buying this ingredient, I took cornmeal and ground it up to a flour like texture in the food processor. And it worked perfect. I highly reccomend this recipe. 

I think the reviewer that stated it was too buttery, and too gooey, expected it to be corn pudding, or something else. This is not that. If it is what you are expecting, the sweet corn cake like served in popular mexican restarants, you won't be disapointed.

I will make this every time I make mexican food!  Thanks!

I am gluten-intolerant (cannot have wheat, barley, or rye products) and finding a cornbread recipe made with ONLY corn flour (and not wheat flour) was extremely difficult! Thank you for posting this delicious recipe.

This is absolutely delicious!!!  The importance of the masa harina is that it contains lime which aids in digestion and absorption of the nutrients found in corn.  The Native Americans originally would use ashes from their hardwood fires to the corn flour/meal originally.  Lack of knowledge of this to the Europeans that brought maize back with them caused many to die or suffer Mal-absorption issues.  I hope this clears up any confusion of the difference between the Mas Harina and Corn flour.

Oh just inject the fat right into my thighs!  Why oh why did I decide to make this?  Now I know just how easy it is to make this tasty stuff.  This was just TOO GOOD!  I used one can of creamed corn in place of the frozen corn & whipping cream.  One can worked out exactly to 1.5 cups.  And since it was "creamed", I skipped the food processor step.  I also used splenda instead of sugar.  Total comfort food...corny carby goodness.  BTW:  This is EXACTLY the same as "Sweet Corn Cake" by Lee Ann Clarke and "Chi Chi's Corn Cake" by Saundra...trying to save you the step of comparing recipes like I do.

This recipe is delish. I substitued a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix for the cornmeal and masa  flour but the muffin mix amounted to 1 1/2 cups so I used a can of creamed corn instead of frozen.  Also replaced the cream with eggnog.  Baked it like the recipe said for about an hour and it turned out beautifully.

After reading the mixed reviews I was a bit concerned buy followed the recipe exactly except only added 1/2 the sugar stated. We were concerned it would be too sweet.  It was very good! This tasted very similar to Don Pablo's restuarant corn cakes.  I used fresh sweet corn I had frozen this summer's crop.  Next timeI I may add an additional 1/2 c. corn.  It was quick and easy!  It's a keeper..

Yum!  I used corn flour for the Masa Harina, and 1% milk in lieu of the cream and used fresh corn.  You definitely do not need to grease your pan.  I used a ceramic casserole dish because it was easier to put in a water bath.  Served it with Chicken Mole and Mexican rice - it helped balance out the spice.  A huge hit with the hubby and the 1 year old in addition to myself.

Incredible! 

I substituted the 1/2 cup of butter with 1/2 cup of plain yogurt to cut the fat. It came out beautifully and tasted great.

This is really good.  I love the sweet corn cakes from El Torito but couldn't have them after I found out I could no longer eat wheat / Gluten.  This recipe is the closest thing I have found.  Thank you for the recipe.

OMG!!  I made this recipe a couple nights ago, and let me tell you...these are EXACTLY like Chevy's!!  The only changes I made were to substitute cream corn for the 1/4 cup of water, added about 2 tbs of water, and used regular flour instead of masa harina.  The texture was perfect, the taste was perfect and authentic.  My boyfriend, who's Honduran, said that this tastes exactly like a type of tamale his mother and aunt used to make.  All he kept saying was 'wow...wow'.  Try this recipe, it's wonderful!!  Thanks for the submission.

my dad has a gluten intolerance so this recipe was perfect for me to make for my family. Did everyhting as writen except didnt have corn meal so had to replace it with more masa harina. turned out great though everyone loved it including my dad. Baked 60 min in water bath w/ foil, the last 20 min i did no foil no water bath at 400 degrees. next time i might double the recipe but still use an 8x8 dish

I thought this was a great gluten-free sweet cornbread and have made it several times, but my non-gluten-free friends thought it was a little odd.

Very good and moist.  The whole family loved this dish as I served it with tacos and beans.  I used evaporated milk instead of heavy cream and sweet white corn found at Trader Joes.  To make this a Gluten Free Casein Free for my Autistic son, I will substitue a GFCF butter and use hazlenut milk.  This recipe is a keeper in my book :0)

I followed the recipe exactly and didn't particularly care for these.  (I like the sweet corn tomalito recipe on this website better.)  The cakes seemed to have a "squashy" taste.

Good stuff. It was a little sweet with 1/4C. of sugar. I also used 1/4C. of butter and that was perfect.Instead of frozen corn and water, I just pureed a can of corn in the blender. It was perfect, just like the restaurants. I cooked it for 50 minutes and let it rest for 10.Probably a good way to get a kid to eat veggies. Thank you.

I tried this with a yummy broccoli/cheese soup recipe I make. My family raved! Next time I will double the recipe! My boys said they would it with butter and syrup for a dessert! I substituted the masa with half flour and corn meal. Very yummy!

Although very delicious, this came out very moist after staying in the oven for an entire hour. For that reason my hunny did not like it. I enjoyed it rather well and will make it again with some adjustments.

5 stars plus! It is buttery but oh so worth it. When I went to CHI-CHI's I always asked for more sweet corn cake instead of spanish rice so after trying 4-5 different recipes this is the one that tastes just like the sweet corn cake at the restaurant! I made it for my mom's 50th birthday party for 50 guests and they all wanted the recipe so I changed the recipy to serve 50, however they all took more then an ice cream scoop worth so I should have doubled it.

Husband and I love this recipe! It was great with the "My Chilli" recipe that is on this site. Tweaked for our preferences of course -.0 For this recipe the only change I made was using only one can of corn. I give this 5 Nom's!

Delicious!! It almost turns the corn into a custard. We both loved it, and we changed not a thing...except that I made it in a round pan. Regardless- you can eat it with a spoon. It's a nice, quick side that you can make.

I followed the ingrediants as directed but instead of making one large cake I made little individual ones. These where extremely greasey and you can tell in photo I posted. Although they tasted reasonable they were jsut to greasey. I think if I make them next time I'll reduce the butter and increase the flour as suggested in other posts to get a better rise.

YUM, YUM, YUM! I made this for my sons birthday and it was a hit. I tripled the recipe and every single piece was consumed. All my guest thought I bought it from Chevy's.

I always used a packaged mix and a can of cream corn to make these, until I found this recipe. So easy, less expensive, usually have the ingredients on hand, and very moist, yummy corn cakes. I am wheat intolerant and looking for recipes that work for my diet.  This one is great. I often put the batter into muffin tins for individual servings.  Just spray with nonstick first. They don't raise like a muffin, but still taste good. Goes great with tacos and enchiladas.

These corn cakes are delicious!  I made them exactly as directed and had fabulous results.  Everyone loved them when I served them with enchiladas, and my husband ate the leftovers with chili the next day.  Fantastic!

This is very sweet, but pretty good anyways. I subbed oil for the butter, used soymilk for the cream and used 1/3 c plus 2 T of cornmeal and 2 T flour for the masa harina. It's very rich, so next time I might reduce the sugar.

These were the worst corn cakes I have ever made. I personally found these to be too dry. The masa harina was too over-powering and I didn't think these were sweet enough even though there was 1/3 cup of sugar. There are definately better recipes out there. Sorry :(

I thought the flavor was fantastic, but they were a little dry.  I'm going to add more cream next time to see if that helps.

I had been looking for something cake-y, but tried this and was pleasantly surprised. It was a nice gluten-free side dish to our gumbo.

This came the closest to the restaurant corn cakes we love! I will cut down on the amount of butter next time.  I would a little more cake like consistency. Thank you for sharing this.

This was a great addition to Thanksgiving, but a slight change ton the traditional cornbread.  Great for the sweet and savory lovers.

This is actually a question.,
I will like to know if instead of putting the pan with foil and place into a 9x13 inch pan filled 3/4 inch high with hot water in the oven. Can I just put it in a corn cake pan directly to the oven and bake for how long to have a regular moist corn cake. That is what I actually want  but Can I? And if that is OK then for how long and I also need the preheated temperature. 

Thank You

This is the best recipe ever.... Thank you for posting this "Sweet Corn Cakes" recipe.  It is very easy and VERY tasty if you are into soft corn cakes.
