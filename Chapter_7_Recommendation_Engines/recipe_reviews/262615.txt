Horrible. No need for a block of Cheese Whiz (Velveeta). Too much cheese and not enough flavor. This was the first Allrecipes example that went straight into the trash. Even hours later I am nauseated by the thought of this thick mass of ick. I tried all sorts of tricks to thin out the "sauce" but it was little more than melted cheese with a hint of pasta.

Up the water and cream. Lose ALL of the Velveeta and half of the American cheese. Add SOMETHING for character. I tried a cup of diced cooked ham and even that didn't help.

No need for a pressure cooker since all that's cooked there is the pasta. It's just as fast to cook on the stove top.

Super easy way to make mac & cheese.  I used 2 cups of water and 2 cups of ck broth.  I had to tweak the time on the pressure cooker.  I did 5 minutes on pressure and then let it sit 10 minutes till releasing the pressure.  Macaroni was perfect. Then I added the rest.  I used shredded triple cheddar and parmesan cheese.  Instead of heavy cream, I used sour cream.  (3/4 cup)    I did add onion powder and garlic powder and cayenne (instead of the hot sauce) and of course the mustard powder!  Delish!!!

Really overcooks the pasta into a gooey mess. So that's as far as I got with this recipe. Didnt want to waste all the ingredients so decided to start over with the pasta and just cook it on the stovetop and bake.

This is a super easy mac & cheese recipe and it was very tasty.  It was very cheesy so I added some extra milk to thin the sauce out a bit.  It's the first homemade mac & cheese recipe I've made that my youngest daughter didn't complain about it being "gritty."

I omitted the heavy whipping cream.  It turned out super creamy.

so creamy and cheesy.  Very good and the fastest homemade mac and cheese ever made.
