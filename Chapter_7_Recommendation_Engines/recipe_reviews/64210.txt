I have been eating meatloaf made from this recipe for over 25 years; I loved it as a kid, my friends loved it, and my kids love it. Unlike meatloaf made with bread crumbs, it has a more even texture to it. 

I use 8 oz. no-salt tomato sauce instead of the tomato juice, increase the salt to 1-1/2 tsp (as it was in the original recipe, which I still have cut out from the box), add chopped green peppers, slather catsup on top 15 minutes before it's done, and let it sit about 15 minutes or so before slicing. 

I also drain some of the grease about halfway through cooking. And remember, do not wrap the leftovers in tinfoil if you use catsup. The catsup reacts with the foil.

Another option is to lay three strips of bacon across the top. You can also use a mix of ground beef, ground pork and ground veal for a more tender flavorful meatloaf. I like the original beef version best.

Great recipe. Try 1 package of Lipton Beef Onion or plain onion dry soup mix in place of the raw onion. It is awesome!

I think this recipe is great, but I altered it by adding 1/4 cup brown sugar, a squirt of regular mustard and two dashes of worcestshire sauce.  I also laid 3 slice of bacon on top while it cooked.  It was so good my husband didn't even have to have any sauce or gravy with it -- absolutely scrumptious!

This is the best I have ever made.  For one thing, it uses oats instead of bread.  Far more healthful, and I like the taste much better.  

I also like its adaptability: use BBQ sauce (thinned a little) or marinara sauce or ketchup (also thinned slightly) for the tomato juice; use Worcestershire Sauce in place of the salt and pepper; add minced and sauteed celery; serve with a brown gravy........

I made this meatloaf last night and it was delicious!  Not only are the leftovers almost gone, but my husband keeps commenting on how good it was!  I used tomato sauce and added one small, diced bell pepper.  I also glazed the top with a mixture of the remaining 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, a sprinkling of brown sugar and a squirt of yellow mustard.  The slightly sweet glaze gave it that extra edge - so good!

I made this for my family and everyone loved it!  I used 2 lbs of ground sirloin instead of 1.5, 1 cup of oats instead of .75, and a package of Lipton Onion Soup mix instead of raw onions and tomato sauce flavored with garlic and oregano and it was excellent!  I will definitely be making it again!

I have been making this recipe for years. Always great! I pour honey over the top before baking, it makes a great sweet crunchy top. I serve it with cowboy mashed potatoes from this site. Great comfort food.

I grew up with this meatloaf recipe. It is simple and just a "meaty" tasting meatloaf. The only thing my mom did different was to place a strip of bacon on the top and spreading a thing layer of plain ketsup over all.

This is a great no-fail recipe mom made when I was growing up.  She made a sauce for the top which includes 4 TBLS vinegar, 4 TBLS brown sugar, 4 TBLS mustard added to one 8 oz can of tomato sauce added to the top half way through baking time.

I was looking for a different meatloaf recipe and I found it.  I used half an envelope of beefy onion soup mix and added bacon and ketchup on top.  The family enjoyed it.

A great basic recipe that can be altered for different occasions.  Also great as a meatball recipe.  This can be made with or without the tomato sauce/juice, with vegetable or onion dry soup rather than onion-very flexible recipe that I've used for years.

Very, very good. Quite moist...I didn't let it rest long enough and it almost fell apart. Can't wait for leftover meatloaf sandwiches. Sometimes old classics are the best!

I have been eating this meatloaf for 45 years.  My mom made it weekly when I was growing up.  My family loves it too. I have also added to this recipe with great results.  However, the taste of the original is comforting to me and I prefer it un-doctored.

My mother cooked it and now I'm cooking for my family. I think my mother has the original Quaker Oats box cut out of the recipe. My husband and son love it!  I add one small can of mushrooms and a few scattered chunks of sharp cheddar cheese (pushed down into the loaf). 15 minutes before it's done, I combine ketchup and light brown sugar to top it off.  Hummmmm good!

The idea of the quaker oats to add stiffness to meatloaf was really interesting.  I think it turned out pretty good, but I increased the lemon zest and made a glaze for the top.  All in all a good meatloaf.

I am an oatmeal filler convert! I was convinced breadcrumbs were the only way to go. This was moist and flavorful and wasn't sitting in a bath of liquid when finished. Loved it!

I have been using this recipe for years.  I love it and so does my family.  I top the meat loaf with ketchup or BBQ Sauce and then bake for the required time.  I serve with baked potato or mashed potato's.

This "old-school" recipe is THE best!  I love trying and cooking new and unusual things, but sometimes plain and simple is best.  I don't add any additional salt because I use ketchup in place of tomatoes sauce.

This is great, normally I don't like meatloaf but this doesn't have an overbearing ketchup-y taste. I used onion soup mix instead of the onion as some suggested and tomato sauce and it came out perfect

This meatload had good flavor, but didn't set up real well.  Came out pretty mushy (used tomato juice).  May turn out better with tomato sauce.  Bumped oats to 1 C, but could probably use some spices and/or garlic.  Good basic recipe, but could use some "oomph."  Probably be best for a fussy eater who likes basic fare.  Kids maybe?

Based on others' recommendations, I added a packet of Lipton onion soup mix and some finely chopped celery, carrot, and garlic.  I think without these additions, the meatloaf would have been bland but who knows?  I didn't try it without so I can't knock it!  Anyway, the loaf needed a lot more cooking time and still came out kind of soggy and mushy.  But it tasted great!  The oatmeal was both good and bad.  It added an interesting "nutty" taste but also a strange gummy texture and I suspect it was a factor in the loaf's mushiness.  If I were to make this again (which I don't know if I would with so many other recipes out there), I would substitue bread crumbs for half the oatmeal and cook it longer to hopefully get a firmer, more solid loaf.

This turned out fabulous.  My fiance loved it.  I substituted lean ground turkey because we don't eat read meat, and it worked perfectly. (I also used a packet of onion soup mix instead of chopped onion as another reviewer suggested.)  The cooking time was exactly right on.  Easy to prepare and impossible to mess up... I'd recommend this recipe to everyone.

Outstanding!, I added an extra egg to help hold it together. I also used ground sirlon (93% lean) and there was a world of difference in the flavor from my first loaf which was 80% lean. 
On one of the loafs I slathered some steak sauce on the top and it came out great!

I've never made meatloaf before and this was so easy to follow and it came out moist and very good.  I also added a ketchup topping from another recipe & it was so good.  My boyfriend who didn't grow up with meatloaf really loved it.  I will definitely try some different suggestions from others next time.

I love this recipe, I use it all the time.  I use minced dried onion, finely chopped mushrooms and about 2 tablespoons of sour cream.  Stays moist and is so full of flavor.

To me, that's the best basic meatloaf recipe ever. I began baking meatloaves with this recipe that I found years ago on a Quaker's package, and it took me years before I even just try another meatloaf recipe. Definitely a stapple.

Tasted great, but too wet, it wouldnt' stay formed when I sliced the meatloaf. Also, the cooking time wasn't nearly enough. It takes me an hour and 45 minutes to cook a 1.5 lb. meatloaf. Maybe this is oven specific, but just a headsup.

I have used this recipe for years and it is my favorite meatloaf recipe.  Just great exactly as shown and easy to use different seasonings or other additions for variety. The oatmeal makes a much, much tastier dish than using bread crumbs.
