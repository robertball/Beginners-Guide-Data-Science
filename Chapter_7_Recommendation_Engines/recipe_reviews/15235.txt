I broke my cookie press and had to improvise and came out with the best cookies ever! I rolled the dough into balls, rolled that in coconut, and put strawberry jam in a thumbprint I made in the middle--people tell me they're the best cookies ever!!

Absolutely perfect little butter cookie that's highly addictive! They just seem to pop right in your mouth. They're not overly sweet and I love the addition of the orange zest. I did increase the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. but other than that I didn't change a thing.  This was a great recipe for a cookie press! Just sprinkle with some colored sugar and you're ready to make a holiday cookie tray look like it came straight from your favorite bakery.

Wow!  These knocked my socks off!  They are delicious.  I also doubled the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. and added a little nutmeg.  Then I added a 1/2 tsp of almond extract to the mix.  I colored half the dough green and pressed into Christmas trees and the other half I left white and used a snowflake design.  Mine were done in about 5 mins though so the first batch burned (had it set for 12 mins).  It also made more than I thought -- between 7-8 dozen.  Thanks for sharing!

These are the best cookie press cookies I have ever made.  I omitted the zest and added a bit more cinnamon as suggested by other reviewers.  I used the disk that I thought most resembled a snowflake and sprinkled them with red, green and white nonpariels before baking.  They look so festive and will make a great addition to my cookie trays.  Thanks for the recipe

Thank you, thank you, thank you!!!  I lost this recipe years ago and have been unsuccessfully trying to duplicate it for many holidays.  I found that by increasing the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp or adding 1/4 tsp nutmeg to recipe, it increases the taste tremendously.  Cookie can also be decorated with sprinkles, cherries, or colored sugar for holiday.

Oh my, these are wonderful!  I increased the amount of cinnamon, used 1/2 tsp orange extract and 1/2 tsp vanilla extract, and used the zest of a whole medium orange to make them extra "orangey".  The next batch I plan on dipping one side in Melted Ghirardelli Bittersweet Chocolate.  I think that will be heavenly!

*yummy*! I don't have a cookie press (yet), so I made these as regular cookies for one batch, then turned them into thumbprint cookies with raspberry jelly for the next batches -- delicious! Definitely will make these again :)

This recipe was so easy and the cookies turned out great.  This is a wonderful pick for a cookie exchange or a filler among a plate of other goodies.  I added a bit more orange zest and also squeezed about a 1/4 teaspoon of the orange juice.  It turned out so yummy!!!!!!

This recipe is sooo tasty! I've tried several times to successfully produce pleasing spritz cookies but somehow something always went wrong. With the process of trial and error I've finally succeeded! Here are my suggestion to make your attempt successful. Firstly refrigerate your un-greased cookie sheets prior to baking, I leave mine in the fridge until I need it. Also if using a cookie press I find it helpful to make a slight twist of my wrist before pulling back with the press, this produces a nicely shaped cookie. Last but not least DOUBLE layer your cookie sheets this way you wind up with a properly baked cookie without over browning or burning the bottom.

These turned out nice, a good coffee cookie.  I used strawberry extract, doubled the cinnamon.  I bought disposable decorating bags & that didn't work so well as the dough was too thick & kept popping a hole in the bag.  Well, I then ended up rolling them into balls & flattening them with my egg seperater to make a neat little "swirl".  I also sprinkled them with red decorator sugar & they looked so pretty.  Next time I think I'll use lemon zest.  Thanks Linda!

I ommited the zest and cinnamon and made the batter as directed. Then I divided the batter in two and added red food coloring to one half and 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the other. I sprinkled coarse sugar over the cookies and baked them as normal in a heart shape. Finally, I assebled bicolor sandwich cookie with nutella inside. I think my husband is buying me jewelry tomorrow! :)

Wow, wow, WOW! These are divine! I only made one small change to the recipe and that is that I used 4 oz cream cheese instead of 3 (because I used one 8 oz block and doubled this). I don't know how people got away with adding 8 oz. The dough is sticky enough for a cookie press as it is.

I also cannot figure out why people would eliminate the orange zest. In my opinion that is what puts these cookies above and beyond other spritz cookies. The subtle taste of orange makes these so much more interesting and so elegant. They really make these stand out. AT LEAST give the orange a try before you decide not to use it. It's delicious!

Great, great recipe. I will make these often!

I followed this recipe to the T and it was delicious!! I think next time I will probably omit the zest (although it does give it a nice zing to cookies) and try adding a bit more cinnamon, or nutmeg, or almond extract. Oh! And maybe it was my oven, but 350 for 12 minutes didn't work. My cookies started to burn at 8 minutes! So I turned down the heat to 325 and left them for 10 minutes and they came out perfect!! Great recipe--Thanks!!

I wanted to make some Christmas cookies with my cookie press. I've tried other recipes but this one is definitely the best. I left out the orange zest because I didn't have any- still very delicious. The dough is easy to handle and the cookies had a great shape. They melt in your mouth...I didn't want to give them away.

5 with modifications. Per other user suggestions, I doubled the cinnamon, used 1/2 tsp vanilla extract + 1/2 tsp orange extract and the zest of one medium orange.  I couldn't believe how buttery the cookie tastes with the orange in it!!  Btw, don't chill this before using it in the cookie press (it won't work well - ask me how I know).  Love this recipe.

I followed other readers' suggestions and made these into thumbprint cookies filled with seedless raspberry jam.  They were so well received on Christmas Eve that I came home and made another batch right away for Christmas day.  Definitely a recipe that will be on my cookie trays every Christmas from now on!

This is an awesome recipe. I just got a cookie press and wanted to try out some different recipes. The traditional, plain recipes are just not that good... not worth wasting calories on, I say. These are amazing. The second time I doubled the cinnamon and orange zest and they were even better. Very easy to work with in the cookie press. My mom and grandmother loved them!

This is the most wonderfully easy recipe to use.  I just purchased the Pampered Chef cookie press and made this recipe (doubled the quantity).  I am blown away by how easy the dough was to handle and how beautifully it worked in the cookie press.  In the past I have had very little luck with recipes like this.  And not only was the recipe easy, but the flavor and tenderness of the cookie was just amazing!!!  A keeper for sure. If you have shied away from using a cookie press, fear no more!!!!  Thank you Linda B. for this great recipe. It will be a family classic here in South FL

I made this exactly as the recipe said and I tried to press them through a pastry bag...That didn't go so well, it was way too thick to even go through the piping tip so I had to make it softer. This changed the recipe a bit and the cookies came out flat. They tasted VERY good, and they were soft, but I was very disappointed that I couldn't use my pastry bag, and I don't have enough money to buy a press, since I'm a college student and can barely make it as is.

Definitely the best recipe for the cookie press I've found.  I generally dislike spritz cookie recipes, but this one worked very well with my press, and it tasted very good, too.  I added a little orange extract and extra spices, and they are fabulous.  I think I have found my keep cookie press recipe after about ten years of searching. I had no problems whatsoever with the flour ratio of the consistency of the dough.

Truly excellent cookies!  I didn't have orange zest so doubled the cinnamon and they are perfect!  Can't wait to try them with the orange!  Every oven is different of course, but I burned my first batch-7 mins is perfect in my oven, 12-15 was way too long to bake.

I made these cookies for a High School Senior Girls Mother/Daughter Tea.  I followed the recipe exactly as listed, and the cookies turned out fantastic!  Honestly, well above my expectations.  They formed well and held up, even in my humid/hot kitchen.  I would recommend these cookies to anyone looking for a great spritz cookie recipe!

This is a really good recipe, but if anyone had any doubts as to whether or not there should be 8 oz. of cream cheese or only 3 oz...doubt no more. I made this recipe both ways so that I could be sure. The 3 oz. recipe was literally awful! They were pasty, gummy, and yucky. They came out of the press beautifully and baked just as well....but they were sooooo yucky. The 8 oz. recipe on the other hand was great. Once again, they came out of the press well (a little stickier, of course), and they baked up great. And they tasted wonderful. Will make again...and the orange zest is a great touch.

I have been using this recipe for years. It is definitely my "go to" spritz recipe.  Whenever I make them I get people that comment on how they don't normally like spritz but these are very good. 

I do usually omit the orange zest.  My spritz usually get done in 9 to 11 minutes so don't wait until 12 minutes to check them or they may become over done.  Also, make sure they are COMPLETELY cooled off before storing them in an air tight container or they will lose their crispness.

SO much better than the recipe that came with my cookie press.  They are still yummy the next day and maybe even better.  I have been looking for a recipe that would produce cookies that tasted like the ones a former neighbor gave us.  I followed this recipe to the letter.  It makes a very flavorful cookie but the flavors are not overpowering, just delicious! Not your plain butter cookie!

No Cookie Press needed! I didn't have one, and want to make this recipe..OH my DOG...are these amazing.
I followed instructions, no changes to dough.  Then I chopped pecans very finely and rolled 1 tsp size balls, and then rolled them in the pecans.
Then took a small juice glass bottom and pressed them out a bit. 
Tried to cook in balls also, not so good. They need to be flattened a little. 
Cook time was still about 15 minutes.. 
WOW... Best cookie I have ever had 
Enjoy

Perfect cookie press recipe.  I omitted the orange zest and salt and added 1/2 tsp of lemon juice.  My extended family LOVED them and requested more and the recipe.

I used this recipe with my Wilton Press and the flower shaped stencil.  Filled the center with homemade jam that I heated up first. (Place cookies on wax paper before filling them!) They tasted great!!! Also tried to fill the centers with melted chocolate. And another batch with chocolate as first layer topped with jam.  These are sooo good!!!

Excellent spritz cookie!  Worked very well with my cookie press (better then most other recipes I've tried).  I used almond oil in place of vanilla and omitted the orange zest.  They didn't last long and are great with coffee, although you won't need coffee for these cookie.  They are alot more moist then most of the spritz recipes I've made in the past.  Delicious!

These were a HUGE hit at my house!  My kids favorite by far!  I did increase the cinnamon to a full tsp.  I also used my cookie press w/ a doubled recipe so we could share w/ neighbors for Christmas.  I pre-chilled the cookie sheet in the frige and then used the cookie press to put the cookies out for baking.  Made all the difference in the world!

Delicious and the dough was easy to work with. Cream cheese comes in 4 and 8 oz packages here, so I used 4 ounces. Also, in my oven, 9 minutes was the perfect cooking time. What shape you choose to spritz might also affect cooking time, so I would suggest checking them at 8 minutes and adding baking time as needed. Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful!  The house smelled of oranges after making these!!  My changes - used 1 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice (as I ran out of cinnamon making other cookies) & the zest of an entire orange as others had suggested.  Yum Yum!  You gotta make these!

I always thought my orange spritz recipe was near perfect, but we like this one much more!  We do prefer it without the cinnamon, though, but that's just us.  This year (Christmas) I sprinkled a little white coarse sugar on them before baking to give them a bit of sparkle and sweet crunch.  Addictive!

These are fool proof spritz cookies! I omitted the cinnamon, vanilla, and orange zest and instead divided the dough into three parts and flavored each with either almond, peppermint or vanilla, and added a different color to each. I used a cookie press and the dough held up very well- like others have said, it didn't stick. These also held their shape very well during the baking process- no spreading. I found that 5 minutes in the oven, plus one minute cooling on the tray before removing them was perfect.  I got about 15-20 cookies out of each third of dough, depending on what cookie shape I used.

TRY THESE! These cookies are really versatile! Like others, I added 8oz of cream cheese and it tasted great. Worked very well in the cookie press and everyone raved about them! I've made them in every possible way : cookie press, jam thumbprints, rolled in coconut, food coloring added. Thanks so much for this recipe!

These cookies were perfect to use in a cookie press. I decided to omit the orange zest, but the cinnamon was a nice, suttle flavor. Also, the cream cheese gave it that extra "zing." I cooked them for 13 min. This is a perfect, holiday recipe.

These were pretty easy to make. They didn't stick to the inside of the cookie press barrel, like most doughs I have tried. I didn't have any orange zest on hand, so I used lemon zest instead. Turned out good regardless. They do not have a bland flavor like many spritz-type cookies. 
My husband liked them too. :) Thanks.

I had rated this 3 stars before when I first made it because the dough was too sticky for my press, but I just made them again and the dough was the perfect consistency.  I think the difference was that I used the full fat cream cheese instead of the 1/3 less fat stuff.  The flavor was good.  My kids liked it.

I'm not usually a fan of spritz cookies but these are particularly good.  The only change I made was to add a little orange extract (1/4 tsp.).  The flavors meld together well to the point of being unable to tell quite what is in them but knowing they taste good!

WONDERFUL!!! The flavor is to die for. For the last few years, my family has done the battle of the cookie press and this is the only recipe that really works in all of our different presses. 

I cut the baking time to 9 min on an airbake sheet and they turn out crispy on the edges and soft in the center.

I didn't use a cookie press, but instead made these into thumbprint cookies filled with strawberry jam.  I thought they tasted good, but without the jam, they were a bit bland.  I will probably make these again and use a cookie press and add a bit more cinnamon like some of the other reviewers recommended.  Overall, a good cookie recipe.

Pleasantly easy with a very buttery flavor. Didn't have an orange on hand so I added a splash of OJ instead (something my grandmother used to do with her butter cookies) and they came out delightful. Great reason for me to take out that cookie press that I haven't used in years. Dusted them with white crystal sugar for an added texture.

A simple and quick recipe.  I fridged it as directed and it wouldn't come out of my cookie press (too hard) so I had to bring it back to room temp.  My cookie press is plastic...maybe that's why.

These are amazing!  Melt in your mouth goodness!  A few helpful tips for those who are new at using a cookie press - like me...make sure your baking sheet is completely cool, otherwise the cookies will not stick. I also found it easier to fill the dough in the cookie press and place in the fridge for about 10 minutes.  It hardens the dough just a little and helps with pressing.  I sprinkled my cookies with some colored sugar before baking.  They tasted sooo good!  You don't even need frosting!!

I've made this recipe twice now and it always turns out great. Some of the best cookies I've ever made. I happened to have WHIPPED cream cheese on hand so I used that instead and it tasted great. I just used a little more because its so airy. I used a little more cinnamon the second time I made it because 1/4 tsp of cinnamon was barely detectable (or not enough for my taste)

I really liked these. I thought they had a great buttery flavor. They aren't too tasty fresh out of the oven though, they are much better when they cool off. Odd for a cookie

My husband couldn't stand them.

I made these with a bunch other to give as Christmas presents. These were the favorite cookies out of all the others. Easy to use in a cookie press and fun to decorate!

this was a good recipe and made a lot of cookies. i added green food coloring to half the dough to make cute christmas trees. i also piped icing onto them and added colored sugars. they were very festive and pretty. i did however cut down on the cooking time...i baked them for 9 minutes. i was hoping for a more flavorful cookie. if i make these again, i will do what other readers have suggested and make them into jam thumbprints. thanks for the recipe! i had a fun time making them.

This recipe is fantastic!!! I bought a new electric cookie press just to make these, and I was NOT disappointed. It was super easy and everyone that tried them absolutely loved them. I didn't do a lot of tweaking, but I did use seasonal mandarin oranges for the zest and added a bit more vanilla as well as a little of the manadrin orange juice. I also sprinkled some nutmeg in, as I am totally addicted to anything with nutmeg. I will definitely be keeping this one in my holiday repertoire.

Moist and delicious little cookies!  I needed a press cookie recipe using ingredients I had on hand when I came across this one.  I don't keep crisco (shortening) on hand which eliminated a lot of recipes, including the one that came with the cookie press.  The only substitution I made was neufchatel cheese instead of cream cheese and I don't think it made a difference.  The orange zest gives a great, subtle flavor.  I watched these cookies like a hawk to be sure they didn't overcook.  I took them out before the edges browned.  I didn't use a food coloring, but I could see how that would work well with these.

I've used the Williams Sonoma cookie press for years and this was hands down the easiest recipe to press.   Cookies were light, tasty and came out of the press perfectly.

This is by far the best tasting Spritz cookie recipe I've ever made.  That being said, I doubled the cinnamon and vanilla and used two teaspoons packed orange zest.  The flavors blended perfectly, but one did not over power the others.  The consistancy of the batter was perfect and I had no trouble whatsoever using my Pampered Chef cookie press.  I used professional grade white and red sugar crystals to decorate the stars--very elegant looking.  These cookies were served at a luncheon and I got many requests for the recipe.

I've searched high and low for a spritz cookie recipe that has flavor. I didn't have orange zest so I left it out. I did follow some of the suggestions and doubled the vanilla, added 1/2tsp of almond extract and 1/4tsp ground nutmeg. They were a hit. I used two different cookie sheets - on one sheet the cookies baked in 5mins, 8mins on the other sheet so watch the cookies carefully to adjust your baking time

The consistency of this dough is perfect for a cookie press.  I had no trouble working with it.  I omitted the cinnamon and added 1/2 teaspoon almond extract.  These are buttery, yummy cookies!

These were perfect. They came out great using a cookie press, the dough was easy to work with. I didn't have orange zest so I used some almond extract instead. Lovely cookies.   I also tried one of the top rated recipes that did not have cream cheese and it was dry and hard to work with. These were much better. Thanks.

I used this recipe the first time I made spritz cookies and I've never looked back! They're so buttery and rich but dainty enough to eat several in one sitting. I often omit the orange zest and add 1/2 a tsp of cinnamon, and will try adding a tsp of allspice instead for a more christmassy flavour. I've also rolled them into balls and turned them into little jam thumbprints. This is now one of my favourite cookie recipes :D

These were light and delicious - I took out the cinnamon and orange zest and put in a little blue food colouring and these made beautiful little snow flakes with my cookie press. The dough worked really well in the press and the cookies didn't spread so I could make a ton at a time. Thanks for a great recipe!

I made this recipe with three other Spritz recipes from this site.  The dough was absolutely delicious (I couldn't stop eating it) and the texture was perfect for making press cookies.  I was a bit disappointed with the taste of the baked cookies, though.  Not sure why, they seemed a bit blander than I was expecting.  I took all the cookies to work and to a church social and asked folks to rate them.  A few people liked these best, but not all that many.

Followed the recipe except left out the orange.  Perfectly soft and manageable dough went thru my Wilton's cookie press very nicely.  As another reviewer did, I dipped the bottom of each cookie in melted chocolate, then sparkly colored sugar, and set them chocolate side up in the freezer for about 10 minutes.  They were amazing!  Brought them to Christmas dinner and absolutely no one, not even the dieters, could resist.  My stickler gourmet aunt even said she'd never seen or tasted anything so lovely in a homemade cookie, and joked that she wanted to place an order with me for her next get together!  This will be a new Christmas tradition for sure.

This is an excellent cookie. This was my first time using a cookie press, and the dough was perfect. It was very easy to make nice looking cookies. The house smells wonderful still - the orange and cinnimon are wonderful aromas. Next time, however, I will add more cinnimon and will chop the orange zest into tiny, tiny specs. I will probably add a bit of orange juice too. I sprinkled red and green sugar on top before baking, and that worked out very well too. I froze 1/2 of the batter, and don't yet know how that will come out. (We'll see!)

This recipe was definitely the best spritz cookie I have tried.  Unfortunately, I still do not like them as they are too buttery.  If you like spritz cookies, you will probably LOVE this recipe.  If you don't like spritz cookies, these won't make you like them either.

A nice switch from traditional spritz recipes.  The number of cookies yielded depends on which spritz form you use.  I used a swirl pattern and pressed a Red Hot into the center.  I only got about 3 1/2 dozen that way.  Stars made about six or seven dozen.  You can tint the dough or leave plain for a nice buff-colored cookie with visible cinnamon flecks.  I increased cinnamon to 1/2 teaspoon.  Freeze beautifully.

This same recipe has been used in my family for years, and is a favorite. With the frosting recipe from the back of a powdered sugar bag and some cinnamon dots, they make great little wreaths and Christmas trees for the holidays! They're very addictive, especially when you freeze them!

The best spritz cookie I've ever tasted.  The cream cheese and orange give it such an awesome zingy flavor.  I like them best a little more done so they have a little crunch on the outside and they are still soft on the inside.

Made these instead of my usual Spritzer recipe.  They are fantastic!  Very creamy with great flavor from the cinnamon.  I cooked them for different lengths of time as some of my family likes crunchy cookies and some of my family likes softer cookies.  Both tasted yummy!  It is a looser batter so you may need to refrigerate for a few minutes before you press them out.

These cookies are delicious.  They work very well in a cookie press as the dough stays firm.  I also made some without the press and both batches turned out great.  The orange zest gives them a nice taste.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This is an excellent recipe!  I followed the advice of other reviews and upped the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp.  This was the first time I'd ever used a cookie press and it was easy and fun.  The cookies turned out delicious!  I can't wait to make them again.

First time I ever got dough through a cookie press so that's why I gave this two stars, however, I did not care for the texture of this recipe at all.  It didn't melt in the mouth like I remember butter/spritz cookies is suppose to.  I think it's the cream cheese.  Will be trying another recipe that doesn't call for cream cheese.

This is an absolutely fabulous cookie that keeps for weeks in a Tupperware container on the counter - if they last that long.  I also increased the cinnamon and added the nutmeg.  Great cookie to make ahead for the holidays so you don't have to do everything at the last minute.  Thanks so much!

Best spritz cookie I've ever had. Delicious! I made them then froze them for a week and they were still good several days after being thawed.

I love these cookies.  The orange and cinnamon really make these stand apart from the ordinary flavorless spritz cookies you usually get around the holidays.  The only suggestion I would make is to make these right before you plan on giving them out.  I made them a week a head of time and they had turned somewhat soft.  Otherwise, these are great.

This is the first spritz recipe that i have not thrown in the trash!  Absolutely great!  I have always had trouble with the dough not releasing from the cookie press. Every cookie released and held their shape.  I used a Wilton press and some inexpensive cookie sheets.  When the dough became too soft, I put it in the fridge for about 5 minutes.  Cookie sheets at room temp, or a little cooler.  i washed them after each batch to get rid of the grease.  8 -9 minutes tops.  I think this one is foolproof!.

I received a cookie press last year and using another highly rated recipe from this site for spritz cookies, I was highly disappointed and thought all spritz cookies must taste like that. Thankfully, not so. I'm not much one for butter and sugar cookies, but WOW! I could eat far too many of these. I dyed the dough green using the tree on my cookie press, sprinkling them with sugar dyed red. Not only are they adorable, but really tasty! I regret not doubling the recipe as these were so good, but I'll be making these again this week, for sure. Also, these only took 5-6 minutes to bake for me.

Delish!  Did not have orange zest, so I left that out and doubled the cinnamon.  Worked perfectly in the Wilton cookie press and they look & taste great.

Very good cookies. I used 2 tsp of lemon zest and lemon juice instead and double the amount of cinnamon. I rolled the dough into balls. Half of them I pressed with the bottom of a glass jar (covered with parchment paper to prevent sticking) and then decorated them. The other half I made into thumbprint cookies with strawberry jam in the middle. Baked in my oven for 13 minutes and they are great!

This is my first time making spritz cookies and the recipe is great!  I love the orange zest that gave an extra flavor to the cookie.  The batter came out of the cookie press easily.  I would definitly try this again with different flavor.

These tasted like orange cream cheese.  If that appeals to you, by all means, try it.  I thought the flavors would come together and compliment each other, but they really didn't.  One good thing about the cookies: great texture.  Flavor needs some work.

We've attempted spritz cookies in the past with very poor results.  This was kind of a last minute attempt.  If it didn't work out, we were going to toss our press in the trash.  I was thrilled to find out how easy this this was to work with and honestly shocked when I turned out a full sheet of cookies without a single problem.  This is honestly a great recipe and will be our "go to" for all future spritz.  Our cookie press is breathing a sigh of relief!

Great flavor and consistency. I made the recipe as written and they turned out great. It made about 70 cookies for me with the cookie press. I cooked them a little less than stated so they would be a little softer and still light brown on the bottom.

The basics of this cookie are good, but I think it's got a bit too much going on.  I'm used to the plain, traditional almond-flavored butter cookie variety, and decided to try these out for a change of pace.  The cream cheese and orange flavors really stood out (in a kind of "hmm...interesting..." o_O) way, but the zest was a hindrance, because it kept getting stuck in the cookie press.  Without the zest, there wouldn't be so much to take in, I don't think.  Other than the taste, they came out of the press well, didn't spread too much, and looked great coming out of the oven.  Were a little flatter than what I'm used to.

These were the best spritz cookies!  The flavor was phenomenal!  We had to add just a little more milk to get them to press nicely, but once we did everything went smoothly.  Pampered Chef cookie press is the only way to go.  My coworkers asked for more!

OMG I just made these and they are FANTASTIC!!!!!  I'm giving them at least 7 stars,  I used the full tsp. of vanilla and 1 tsp. of almond extract.  I also had to add an additional 1/2 c. flour.  Hope there are some left when my family gets home.

This is a very good recipe.  The "press-ability" and "stick-ability" is great at room temp.  I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting 1/2 t almond extract for the orange zest.  I'm just not that crazy about orange stuff.  Lemon, I'm sure, would be fantastic, though.

This is the first time that I have used my cookie press and this dough worked wonderfully, even with the "help" of my  my 3 year old.  My kids wanted lemon cookies instead of orange..so I just added some yellow food coloring and 1 teaspoon Natural Lemon Flavoring(Back Bay Trading Co.) instead of orange zest and put the dough in the fridge for 5-7 minutes to firm up. Great texture. Crispy outside, tender inside. My pre-schoolers loved them! Thanks.

Wow, this cookie was so easy to make!  The taste was just scrumptious.  It was buttery and very rich. This recipe is a keeper and I plan on making them often!  I made one change, I used almost 1 cup of Splenda Banking Blend.

This recipe makes a dough that is perfect for using the cookie press. The only change I would make is to use more orange rind. I grated with a microplane and it was perfectly fine in the dough (no big chunks). I dusted the finished cookies with powdered sugar. Yum!

I tried the recipe as listed, which gave a very bland, cream-cheese flavored cookie.  I thought I would try it again with some variations, so I triple the cinnamon, added almond extract and nutmeg.  Still, these were very blah.  I didn't have good luck pressing them, either, but I'll won't blame the cookies for that.  I tried dipping the cookies in melted chocolate bark and drizzling it on them.  Not good.  I was not very impressed with these, but, to each her own.

I always make multiple batches of Spritz each year, and tried this recipe for the first time two Christmases ago.  I made it again last year, and will be making it this weekend!  These are so flavorful and delicious -- I just love the orange in them.  Some people still prefer my traditional Spritz, but this is now my favorite.

Very good.  I liked them a lot.  One of my friends didn't like the cream cheese taste- said it was too strong.  I added orange zest and extract.  I will probably make them again.

Delicious spritz cookies that are easy to work with in the cookie press!  I made over 600 of these for my wedding reception as favors.  I wrapped a few in each small bag and tied with pretty ribbon.  I had so much fun making them and it made my day more special!!

These cookies turned out great.  I added 1/4 tsp nutmeg for more flavor.  I also topped them with a light glaze.  Everyone loved them.

This was the first time I made a sugar cookie, and it turned out great!  As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the cinnamon and added a little nutmeg.   MMMMMMMM!  Even my husband liked them, and he's really picky! ;-)

These are so good! Cinnamon and orange give a nice twist. The dough was easy to work with in my cookie gun. Try them--you'll be glad you did.

The recipe yielded far less than advertised...I barely got a dozen small cookies out of the recipe.  They are pretty tasty, but alot of work.

What great tasting little cookies!  I baked them to put in gift baskets I made for my grandparents and parents.  They were such a hit...great with tea and coffee.  I used a small round scoop to form the cookies...easy and uniform shape!

These were good but something went wrong.  I think it might have been my fault (my flour was pretty old) but my baked cookies had a tiny bit of a sour aftertaste.  My butter and other ingredients were fresh, but I don't bake a lot so the flour may have been past its prime.  I am unfamiliar with baking spritz cookies and it didn't say in the instructions, so I cooled my dough like I do with sugar cookies. BIG MISTAKE!  If you haven't made spritz cookies before, the dough needs to be sticky so it can stick to your cookie sheet (cookie sheet has to be cold, dough warm.  Once I got the dough warmed up, it went fine.  I also was unaware how tiny spritz cookies are.  When I was reading the reviews about how you can make 6 dozen cookies, I was astounded.  Spritz are one, maybe two bites, so 6 dozen doesn't last long.  

Anyway, they were good but I need to try again with fresher flour to see if the bitterness was the recipe or me.  It might have also been the orange zest, but I WILL try again.  Oh, and mine took EXACTLY 12 minutes to bake perfectly.

Yummy recipe! I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  I colored half the dough with green and used my cookie press to make trees & wreaths.  I used the egg white to brush on top of the cookies for glue and used colored sugar and sprinkles to decorate them. They look great! Thank you!

I liked these cookies well enough for a tasty little butter cookie that was a good filler in my holiday cookie platters.  Unfortunately, the dough would not cooperate with either of my two cookie presses (manual pampered chef, nor an electric one) so I just used a small scoop, flattened with the bottom of a glass and pretty colored sugars.  I did not alter the recipe at all so my rating is based on the recipe as posted, and reading reviews I see many reviewers increased either the cinnamon or orange zest. If I tried these again I would definitely do that.

Oh ... these are GOOD! The only thing I did different was double the cinnamon - we like cinnamon. These turned out light, buttery and had the perfect texture! I did have to bake them for the full 15 mins to get them to lightly brown on the tips. But you would have to adjust time according to your oven as everyone's is different. ;) I had no problems pushing this dough through my $10 cookie press! Worked perfectly! Well ... almost .. I need to bake MORE because we ate them up too fast! LOL!

These were such a great alternative to the spritz recipes that call for almond extract.  My kids never cared for those but they raved about these little cuties!  I did increase the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. and decreased the oven temp. to 325 since I was using dark, nonstick pans.  Delicious!!!

I was at my mom's house without a cookie press. I rolled the dough into balls. Half I flattened by pressing with the back of a fork. With the other half I made thumbprint cookies as another reviewer suggested. Rolled in coconut, created an indention with my thumb and filled with cherry preserves. Awesome cookies! Both versions were a hit. These are going to be my favorite non-chocolate Christmas treat. Thanks for a great recipe!

I was very excited to find so many great reviews on this spritz cookie twist. I love orange and vanilla (creamsicle, yum) so the combination seemed perfect. The texture of the dough was perfect for the cookie press. However, I was very disappointed in the final product. They had a great initial flavor but the follow up taste of the cream cheese seemed almost like a chemical flavor - a little sour and dissappointing. I used 4 oz of full fat cream cheese, only real vanilla extract, lightly zested orange rind and a tiny bit of vanilla bean.   Next year I will stick to the classic recipe.

This recipe was great, bu i tweaked it a bit, less flour only 2 cups and more cinnamon and a little nutmeg! Loved the way the orange zest brightened it up! If your having trouble getting the cookies to stick to the sheet you can put the pan in the freezer, it helps them stick better!

This cookie was simple to make and tasted buttery, just as promised!  I found it a little too plain for my taste, though, so I added an orange glaze (simple orange glaze on this website) to the top, and then it was PERFECT.   Also, I had to reduce teh temperature to 325, and my cookies only baked 8 minutes, even at that temperature.

Fantastic flavor, but I think the time is wrong for these. . .when I left them in for 12 minutes they burned.  I had to pull them out at 8 minutes.  Also, it was my first time using a cookie press and I wasn't impressed with how the cookies were turning out so I rolled the rest of the dough into balls and made jam thumbprint cookies.

I thought these cookies had a unique taste but a little bland for me. My husband felt the same way and I followed the recipe almost exactly.. it's missing something but I declined to try to add anything because I was busy making other Christmas cookies!!

YUMM! These cookies were so easy to make and baked evenly and to perfection! I also love the tang that the orange zest and cream cheese give; it's perfect! I am now a HUGE fan of my cookie press!

Going to make these for the 3rd time now. They are so soft and easy, and not overly sweet. Great recipe for using my cookie press. Thanks for sharing!

I subbed the orange zest for lemon zest, increased cinnamon, added 1 tsp nutmeg and 1 tsp almond extract.  Unfortunately the cookies did not turn out well using my Pampered Chef press.  I tried one batch with chilled dough, one with room temp dough and neither made a difference.  I ended up rolling the remaining dough and pressing them flat.  The results were better without using the press.

I copycatted another reviewer. Rolled the dough into balls, rolled those balls in coconut, then made a thumbprint with blackberry and raspberry preserves. Also, doubled the cinnamon. I ended up with festive delights. I like that you can taste the orange zest.

Excellent recipe.  I used a cookie press for the first time and these turned out really nice.  They are delicious.  I left out the zest & doubled the cinnamon.

These cookies were just okay.  I felt they were a little greasy.  I was excited by the cinnamon and the orange zest, but I can add that to any butter or spritz cookie.  I have other recipes I think yield a better result.

This recipe is wonderful! We had so much fun making Spritz cookies! I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon. It came out of the cookie press VERY well, and we were amazed at how easy and how many cookies these created. It is a new family favorite. Thanks Linda!

Absolute perfection! I left out the orange zest just because I didn't have any handy, and added 1 tsp almond extract. Worked perfectly with my Kuhn Rikon press. Ideal with coffee or tea! Looks to be very versatile flavoring wise. Will be great with lemon, lime or orange in summer. Thank you for a great recipe!

Since it was a few years since I had made Spritz cookies I came looking for a new recipe.  This one looked promising.  Sadly it didn't turn out as I hoped.  The dough was much too soft and I had to add additional flour - about 1/3 cup more.  I also had to chill the dough because even with more flour it was still too soft to make nicely formed Spritz cookies.  I followed previous hints about chilling my cookie sheets in order to help the cookies stick to the pans.  That helped somewhat, but I still had trouble with the dough releasing from the cookie press onto the pans.  The end result was cookies that tasted good but didn't look nice and well-formed.  My search continues for a new Spritz Cookie recipe.

I would give this recipe five stars for flavor, but it was too sticky for my cookie press. It needed a lot more flour added, although I never got the balance quite right. I need to work with this recipe some more.

This was a very easy cookie to make with my new Pampered Chef Cookie Press.  I got almost 5 dozen cookies from this recipe using the Christmas tree disc.  I didn't have any oranges, so I used granulated lemon peel that I reconstituted in the vanilla extract.  I added green food coloring to my dough, but didn't remember that I wanted to until after I had added the dry ingredients--my cookies had some air bubbles in them which I am attributing to mixing too much after adding the dry ingredients.  **I would strongly recommend adding food coloring when you're creaming the butter & cream cheese**  I also used margarine, which is OK but I'm sure that real butter would make these taste even better! I'm not sure that the citrus adds a lot to these cookies, but that may be because I didn't have the fresh orange zest. I added some holly quints to some of the trees and they really look like finished, special cookies-- even better than the red sugar ones.

i used my new cookie press with it and it made them way too thick and misshapen... didn't really work at all -  all that aside, i didn't even really like the taste. tasted very cream cheesey to me and had a weird aftertaste.

I used half a tsp of vanilla and 1/2 tsp almond extract because I ran out of vanilla.  Everything else I did exactly like the recipie called for.  Next time I may add even more almond extract.

LOVE this one.  I have made a few from this site and was pretty disappointed.  Just got the cookie press.  This recipe was AWESOME compared to the others.  I added a little extra flour cause it was too sticky for me and replaced the orange zest with 1 tsp almond extract.  Looked good & more importantly tasted good too!  Thanks!

I also added more cinnamon bringing the total to 1/2teaspoon.  Balances the flavor.  The cookie itself is firm on the outside but still soft (not crumbly).  I only needed to bake mine for about 9-10min.  Keep an eye on them.

I really liked this recipe and it worked beautifully in my cookie press.  I tweaked the recipe slightly by substituting the orange zest (because I didn't have any) with almond extract. Use the same amount that you would use for vanilla extract.  It gave the cookies a very nice flavor.  I will definitely be adding this recipe to my cookie arsenal!

Absolutely divine taste. Thanks so much for posting this.  I accidentally left out the vanilla & they still tasted grand.  We also used "green apple" flavored sugar crystals.  It was a nice compliment to the slight cinnamon taste.  Great texture, dough very workable (put in fridge, in between batches), and the kids had a blast.  Thanks again.  Happy Holidays!

This recipe was amazing, I brought them in for some friends and they all went crazy over them.  They stay soft and delicious.  I added some more cinnamon and some nutmeg, which I think made it.  Thank you for the recipe!

This is the first recipe I've used with a cookie press, and they're perfect!  I omitted the orange zest and didn't miss it.  Make sure that the bottoms are golden brown as the recipe directs--it really enhances the buttery flavor.  They taste undercooked otherwise!  I baked some with chocolate chips in the centers and liked the combo.

Excellent, easy cookie.  I omitted the orange (didn't have any) and added green food coloring to make my trees green.  I sprinkled the unbaked cookies with colored sugar.  It added a nice touch!  Will be making more of these tomorrow, possibly will drizzle icing on them prior to adding the colored sugar to dress them up more, but these are great and worked so well in my cookie press!  THANKS!

We got a cookie press as a wedding gift over a year ago and I finally decided it was time to use it with this recipe.  Very good!  I don't usually like orange flavored stuff, but these were awesome and came out so soft and wonderful.  Also, I dusted them with powdered sugar after they came out of the oven and it was the perfect topping

i thought these were very good.  i used orange extract instead of zest.   i like the hint of orange flavor in these along with the cream cheese.  these might make it to my christmas cookie line up every year.  thanks!

Excellent recipe!  I didn't change anything.  They tasted great and had perfect consistency for a spritz.  To decorate I dip the top in a bit of glaze then dip the wreaths and Christas trees in green sprinkles then add red hots for decoration.

Substituted a tsp of orange marmalade for the zest and added green food coloring when pressing my wreaths and trees.  Perfect!  Thank you for sharing.

These are phenomenal!  They are very flavorful and rich.  Just perfect.  The dough was just right and did not jam up my press in any way. As someone else said, they are very easy to eat (like popcorn).  Thank goodness Christmas only comes once a year!  As for baking time, 9 minutes did it for me.  Thanks for the excellent recipe!!!

These are excellent.  I made them for the 2004 Christmas Season and will make them again this year.  After they cooled, I coated the bottoms in melted dark chocolate dip.

For a cookie press cookie which cannot be gooey, chewy or filled with chocolate and nuts it is the best.  They are small, crisp and flavorful.  The only caution is that they are highly addictive.  I could eat these everyday and never get tired of them.  The flavor combination is outstanding. Thank you.

This is a nice spritz cookie - one of the better ones I have tried.  The dough is really firm - shaping it into a "tube" before putting it into the cookie press makes it a lot easier to fill the press.  The addition of cream cheese makes these cookies taste a little like kolacky cookies.  It's been a week since I made them and they still taste good!

This is an excellent recipe! I love the orange zest taste. Yummy! It is a wonderful recipe for my cookie press, which I have never used before. I did find that my cookies were done in 8-11 minutes and yielded 4-5 dozen depending on press design.  I used a 1525 Pampered Chef Baking Basics Cookie Press, what a cinch. These cookies rock!

These cookies are pretty good.  I made the following modifications: added a little more orange zest, added ~ 1 tsp of juice from the orange, increased cinnamon, and added 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  I made little Christmas shapes with my cookie press and then decorated with green & red sugar.  I only needed to bake these for 6 minutes.  Everyone at work loved them - they said the orange added a little zing!

I used a small cookie scoop instead of a press and they almost looked store bought. Great and easy. The cookies got RAVE reviews at a potluck.  I even experimented by changing the cinnamon to nutmeg and the orange zest to lemon and the vanilla to lemon flavoring.

Lovely recipe!!!This cookie has wonderful texture and the dough was easy to work with. I will make them again but I will not add cinnamon but will double the orange zest. That's just me though, everyone else loved them just the way they were.

I've searched high and low for a spritz cookie recipe that has flavor. I didn't have orange zest so I left it out. I did follow some of the suggestions and doubled the vanilla, added 1/2tsp of almond extract and 1/4tsp ground nutmeg. They were a hit. I used two different cookie sheets - on one sheet the cookies baked in 5mins, 8mins on the other sheet so watch the cookies carefully to adjust your baking time

I have to say, this is the BEST sprtiz cookie I have ever tasted! I skipped the orange zest.  I used red food coloring and made hearts.  Once they were cool I spread raspberry jam on the back of one and made little sandwich cookies.  Then I dipped half the sandwich cookie into some melted dark chocolate.  Put them in the freezer to set.  These are for my husband for Valentine's Day, he loves Spritz Cookies, I can't wait to give him these.

Love these cookies.  I hadn't baked in 15 years but
Felt this year was my year to try and I wanted to make a spritz cookie.  Great recipe- just needed to adjust temp a little lower for convection oven.  Took to 2 parties and received many compliments.

Fantastic Recipe!  The only change I made was to increase the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp as other reviewers mentioned. The orange zest is perfect!  It gives just the right touch of flavor to this cookie. My cookie press gave me fits and for some reason I could not get them to form, so after thinking on it for a while, I rolled the dough into small balls, baked for 14 minutes and drizzled with semi-sweet chocolate.  Probably the best cookie I've ever made!  Thanks for the recipe!

Was to sticky for the electric press I have to do with the flower disk, so I had to use the tube instead. Not a good recipe for a cookie press. But they did test good. I was only disappointed on not being able to put them through the press=Anita

I didn't change a thing in this recipe and the cookies turned out fantastic! The dough worked well in the press too - no sticking or clumping.

DELISH!!!!! Delightfully easy to make and very tasty. I had a little trouble with my cookie press for some reason so I just rolled the dough out and cut with Christmas cutters. Baked them at 350 for 10 to 12 minutes depending on thickness.You can decorate them with icing, sprinkles or color the dough.. FANTASTIC

These cookies were pretty good, but I do have to agree with those before me and say that the cream cheese and orange zest do NOT compliment each other. Next time I would definitely omit the zest. I also increased the cinnamon a tad, as other reviewers mentioned. The positives of this recipe were that the dough was very easy to work with and the cookies had a great texture. I would give this recipe another try.

Very easy to make. Didn't care for orange zest but Joshua loved it.  Tried with lemon zest but you need to put in quite a bit before flavour comes out.  The raw dough was tastier than the actually cooked cookies.  Will look for even a better cookie recipe.  This was good though but not fabulous.

This recipe was so good I made a double batch. It is an excellent cookie just as I remember it as a kid.  The only thing I would do a bit different is add a little extra cinnamon.

These make delicious, sturdy spritz cookies.  I used orange extract instead of zest because I didn't have oranges on hand.  Cookies turned out beautifully.

Perfect recipe for the cookie press! The cookies turned out so yummi! The orange zest gives them a good flavor. I added a little bit more cinnamon and some nutmeg to the dough and decorated the cookies with m&ms, almonds and white chocolade drops. Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. I bake a lot of cookies and always have problems with the spritz cookie dough, but not with this recipe which has a great orangy-cinnamon-holiday taste. I did increase the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp. Thank you for this recipe.

For those who had problems with the cookies not coming out, I think the type of cookie press you use makes a big difference.  I tried this recipe with two different models of the W----- cookie press and had trouble every so often and had to re-do some in every batch. I decided to invest in a K--- R---- cookie press and did not have any problems this year. It went so fast and I finished making the cookies in record time. =)

I made this with only 2 substitutions.  I used lemon zest and almond flavoring instead of vanilla.  Even after refrigerating it was sticky.  The cookie itself was chewy in the center and crisp around the edges.  With cold milk they tasted really awsome.  I rolled them into balls and pressed into sugar then flattened them on the cookie sheet.  When I tasted them by themselves they had a weird after taste.  Not sure what it was.  Not sure if I will try this again.  Maybe it was the substitutions that made it off.  Anyways I give them 4 stars.  My Husbnd loved them...

I'd never made a spritz cookie before, and this was a great first try! I actually made it during a dinner party in about 10 minutes. Extremely easy and tasty, even after I "veganized" it!

These were very good but I do prefer the taste of the more buttery traditonal spritz.  the flavor of the oranje zest came out alot and did give it a good taste.  I did add 8 ounces of cream cheese like the other reviewes did and that seemed to work great.

i gave this delicious recipe a 4 only because it is 4 a cookie press and it did not work well with my cookie press, it would not stick to cookie sheet at all. The cookies were absolutely delicious though! I only had lemon flavoring so i used that, but they are soooo good, they just melt in your mouth, orange will be just as deeeelicious!

I loved the texture of these cookies!  I made these with the orange flavor, and also with almond. Both were delicious. When I wanted to make them again, and I only had soft cream cheese, I added an extra 1/4 cup of flour--and they came out perfect!

This is the perfect recipe for a cookie press.  Oh, they are so delicious.  The dough is the perfect consistency every time.  The recipe makes so many cookies, but I still need to double it in my house because they disappear so quickly!  :o)

I had a hard time with the dough being too soft for the cookie press. And don't go anywhere near 12 minutes if you are using a dark cookie sheet! I was finally able to achieve a non-brown cookie at 325F for 8 minutes.

Deeelicious!  Such a wonderfully flavorful cookie.  This was my first time with a cookie press and the dough was super easy to work with.  Will definitely make over and over again!

Fantastic Cookies!  These came out perfectly and tasted great!  You do need the orange zest though, it makes a huge difference.

These cookies were amazing! They have a wonderful, delicate flavor. The only change I would make would be to add more cinnamon next time, since I am a huge cinnamon fan.

The flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  They are quite plain looking if not decorated, though.  I had trouble getting the cookies to stick to the pan when pressing them out.  I'm sure it has something to do with me or the pan since I have this problem every time I appempt spritz cookies.  Anyone have ideas on how to decorate them once they are baked??

I loved the cookie's texture - very soft and creamy.  I found that the recipe yielded a mildly sweet cookie and I would've preferred something sweeter.  I might try to make these cookies substituting regular cream cheese with strawberry or some other fruit cream cheese.  Hopefully that will produce a sweeter cookie.

I like to use a pastry bag instead of a press and this dough worked very well.  The cookies held their shape when baked.  I dipped them in chocolate patially for a more festive look.

Although these are the only cookie press cookies I have tried that actually work with my cookie press, we did not really enjoy them. They are too bland for us. I even doubled the cinnamon like some suggested and added one fourth teaspoon of nutmeg. They smelled great baking, but we just didn't find them flavorful enough for our tastes. I think I would prefer them with lemon extract and lemon zest instead.

Linda, these are wonderful cookies and I thank you for sharing the recipe.  They turned out perfect and still were yummy two days after making them.  My son bagged them up for a Christmas present for his teacher and they were a big hit.  Thanks again!

good quick cookie-but out of the three i made this is the one i decided not to make for Christmas-i'm just not used to the cream cheese taste in a cookie-it is still a good cookie almost like a shortbread but softer-although i'm not making it for Christmas i will probably make it again-just because it is so easy

Tasty cookies!  My cookie press yielded many more cookies than the recipe
stated.  The citrus flavor is quite nice, but I couldn't taste the cinnamon at all;
using more than the specified amount will solve that problem.

this cookie was amazing! first, I should point out a few things. I wanted a cookie that I could use my cookie press with. I wasn't paying attention to the cream cheese amount and put 8oz in. I assume this is what caused it to be too sticky for cookie press, but not sure. that was a delicious mistake honestly! then, I left out all flavoring called for and added lemon extract. this was delicious! I am going to make the cookies again today for a pot luck. will see the difference, when follow recipe correctly. all in all, this is a great recipe. cookies were very light and fluffy. I'd even go so far as to say, Baker quality

Got a new spritz gun so looking for a great recipe to go with it and I found it. These are tender and light. I sifted the flour with the dry ingredients and I highly recommend that. I baked for 14 minutes at 350 and they were perfect. I used the dough right after mixing and it went through my gun perfect. I enjoy the cream cheese flavor. I added vanilla and almond flavoring with a little orange peel. Now I'm ready for Christmas baking but these should be eaten all year long. I always use parchment paper when baking cookies but this said not to so I put them on a dry cookie sheet but then had to try them with parchment paper and they were great that way also so I will continue to use parchment paper for easier cleanup and cooling down the cookies.  They say they freeze well but I don't think that will happen in our family. Eat and enjoy.

The cookies are the best! I omitted the orange zest because I didn’t have any in the house and like other reviewers wrote the cookies turned out fine. I used a Christmas tree and wreath design from my cookie press along  green sprinkles for a very pretty and yummy Christmas cookie! I received lots of compliments on this recipe! Highly recommended!!

Every year my husband asks for the Spritz cookie with cream cheese that he ate as a child.  i used his mothers (original recipe with cookie gun from 1950s), my mothers recipes, internet, etc. to no avail.  So i tried this one.
THIS IS IT!   he loves them.  The dough is easy to work with, no issues with cookie press, moist, etc.  Thank you !

Turned out great! Love the recipe!
Minus one star because the batter did get too thick to use comfortably in a cookie press. My hands were bruised by the end but the cookies were delicious :-)

I made this recipe as written. They are quite good. My husband loved them! I prefer a more buttery flavor with less citrus. We divided the dough into thirds and made some with red and green food coloring for the kids. The prettiest were the regular dough with red and green large grain decorative sugars.

Cannot stop eating these cookies.  So delish!  I increased cinnamon to 1/2 tsp and put in 2 tsp orange zest.  I used the Oxo cookie press.  I did put sheet pans in freezer, although not sure that was necessary.  Easy and delicious!

5 stars with changes. This is one truly yummy tasting cookie dough and it works perfectly in a cookie press. As suggested by other reviewers, I increased the cinnamon and the orange zest. I added 1 full teaspoon of cinnamon and the zest of one whole orange to the dough. I made these cookies for Christmas and the extra cinnamon and zest added to the traditional holiday flavor. The stickiness of the dough is perfect for use in a press. It worked very well. As others have said, the trick is to NOT chill the dough before use and to NOT use parchment or silpats. You need to press the dough directly onto the cookie sheet for this to work well.

These taste good. I didn't add the cinnamon or zest, because my girls like more vanilla. When the dough got too warm, it would not peel from the cookie press. I will continue to play around with the recipe. Liked these cookies so far!

I busted out the 1962 MIRRO cookie press that I'd scored at a garage sale and wanted to find some reviews for comparable recipes to the ones in the little booklet wrapped around it in it's box.  This is identical to the "Butter Snow Flakes" recipe they provided.  I made a half batch, (refrigerated half of that to make closer to Christmas) and got 22,  2" pinwheels with the 1/4ish chunk I used. I didn't use /have the orange zest.  I had to add a little more flour to get them to release from the press, but otherwise I found it pretty easy for my first try at these vintage goodies. I found it helpful to express/ crank the dough fully on the cookie sheet then express a little more after lifting the press slightly off the cookie, as it make for a thicker cookie with nice ridges/ relief.  These held their shape well in the oven.   I got rave reviews from co-workers, who said they found spritz cookies frustrating so this recipe is a keeper.   I also made shortbread (which I expected to be my favorite)  and lemon crisps and have to say that this is my favorite.  I love the little cream cheese tang and melt-in-your-mouth texture.  This is the one I will make every year.

These are very rich and very good.  I made them as directed and doubled the recipe.  I would not double the grated orange rind as it is a little too overpowering.

These were ok. Made as recipe said.  Personally I didn't care for the orange flavor but both my kids and husband loved them.  Used food coloring and made green Christmas trees, red hearts and white snow flakes. Added sprinkles and decorations and then flash freezed them and then froze them unbaked. Froze well.

This is a great recipe. I also made some with almond extract instead of the vanilla extract and they were delicious. These are easy to make and there are so many different variations that you could do.

This was perfect for the cookie press. This a keeper! 

I did change a few things. Doubled the batch and used a 8oz package of cream cheese. I didn't have an orange so used lemons instead and replaced the cinnamon with fresh nutmeg.

Delicious little butter cookies! The cinnamon and orange flavors are very subtle, but I like the slight tang from the cream cheese. Next time I will bake them for a slightly shorter time, I did the full 15 minutes this time and they were slightly too crunchy for my taste. I sprinkled them with a little colored sugar before baking, and I didn't feel like they needed anything else. Simple, but delicious!

Love the flavor of these cookies, the orange zest is what makes these cookies perfect! The only change I made to the recipe was taking previous posters advice and doubling the cinnamon. After the bake I was so in love with the orange flavor that I decided to play on it and I glazed half the batch with an orange glaze recipe I found on the site. Definitely a five star cookie!

12-22-15 ~ Very tasty spritzer cookie. I made these for our cookie/candy exchange of 2015. Recipe is very easy to work with and one I would make again. I made this twice and made the recipe as written - but I can see where this would be very easy to change up the flavors. We liked the texture when the cookies were just a little brown on the bottom. It makes them a little crisp. (4-stars)

Revised review -- I'd delete the review if I could because I didn't get to taste them as per directions. The cookies spread  on the sheet and didn't taste good and  I realize now that I didn't put the full amount of flour in.

INGREDIENT 'CHANGE:' I didn't measure the zest amount, because why bother? I zested two oranges and called it good. 

COOK TIME CHANGE: I think spritz/butter cookies should be soft and melty, so I only baked them 6-7 minutes per batch. 7 minutes for big wreaths, 6 minutes for little flowers. Even my big wreaths were not very big. My cookies only barely browned on the bottom, everything else was still completely pale.  

---TIPS---

DONE-NESS (very soft cookies): Touch the top of cookie with fingertip. If the top is just hardened (like an impossibly thin shell of done-ness over completely soft insides), I take them out of the oven. Seriously just touch, don't put pressure. The only browning was super duper light on the bottom. 

TRANSFERRING: Let them cool on the cookie sheet. It won't take long. Then, gently twist them by the base and they'll release. Mine did not crumble or break. One fell on the floor and didn't break.

NOT RELEASING FROM PRESS: put a drop of nonstick spray on the outside of the cookie press plate. Make sure the baking sheet is not hot (just a little warm is okay). Wipe down the baking sheet with a barely damp paper towel between batches.

CRUMBLY COOKIES: You really need to incorporate the ingredients. This is best accomplished by mixing well. Whip up the butter and cream cheese to fluffy. Mix in the egg and sugar and whip until fluffy. After all the flour is incorporated, whip it up in a mixer on high for a couple minutes. 

EXTRA YUM: Melt very dark choc

I added about 3 T of cocoa powder to half the dough & made chocolate ones as well. Turned out great. May try twist or half & half ones next. Perfect recipe.

The dough was a huge sticky mess and didn't work in the press even after about 1/2 c of additional flour.  Ended up adding more flour and rolling them out.  They did rise up nicely but my family all thought they tasted not only lackluster but like "Play-Doh".   Sorry.

Absolutely delicious...my two toddler girls enjoyed helping me make them as well as eat them.  I pretty much stuck to the recipe although I added a tad more cinnamon and sugar based on other's comments.  I also used premium ingredients such as Saigon cinnamon, Madagascar vanilla, and fleur de sel.  I figured what the heck, I had it all and was only baking once this Christmas.  Definitely don't skip the orange peel as this really gave a new dimension to the cookie and the complexity of flavors is indescribable.

These are the BEST cookies I've ever made!  I doubled the amount of cinnamon and they came out amazing.  They worked perfectly in my cookie press as well.  This is my new Christmas cookie recipe!  So delicious!  Thank you!

Good recipe but I needed to use about 1/2 cup more flour so it would go through the presser and I only baked them for 10 minutes since they were very small cookies.

This was my first time attempting a press recipe and it was perfect! I followed it to a T with the exception of upping the cinnamon to 1/2 tsp as others recommended. This is a definite keeper!

Delicious cookies!  This was my first attempt at making cookie press cookies, and I read lots of recipes and reviews before deciding to try this one.  I followed the recipe exactly (which was hard for me because I almost always make a few adjustments)and they tasted great!  Very subtle orange flavor; really couldn't taste the cinnamon. Good texture.  My teenage son and my dad loved them too.  You do have to be sure that the cookie sheet is completely cool and not greased, so that the cookies adhere to the pan.  I used my mom's old Mirro cookie press and the dough went through it just fine.  I would recommend this recipe to anyone wanting a flavorful cookie press cookie.

Definitely not the best spritz cookie I've ever had.  I liked the orange zest but thought there was way too much butter, they came out greasy and flat.

Wow, I made this recipe using the ingredients exactly and I was very disappointed in the results.  I put the dough through a cookie press and they did not hold their shape, went really flat, and are crispy and not chewy like others have mentioned.

This is a great base recipe, and tasted even better with a few changes- I took out the cinnamon, and orange zest and added the zest of 1 medium lemon and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. It sounds like a lot of lemon, but it actually creates the perfect delicate flavor! Huge success!

I would like to give these a 3.5, but there's no way to do that.  I wanted something similiar to spritz, but yet different.  I thought this recipe would fill the bill.  I wish I would have added some orange juice or orange extract as other reviewers did, I think it would have given it a more distinct flavor.  There is a not-so-nice aftertaste to these cookies that makes me go to brush my teeth afterwards...the only way to get rid of it.  I finally concluded that the culprit is the cream cheese in the cookies.  I agree with a few of the other reviewers, I don't know how anyone could add an entire 8 ounce package of cream cheese to these...they would be just awful.  The next time I think I'll stick to my old spritz recipe.

I have a cookie press that belonged to my husband's grandmother. This recipe worked nicely in the press. However, I didn't like the sour flavor the cream cheese gives them and I only used the 3 oz. as the recipe states. I can't imagine how awful they would be with 8 oz. Also, it could probably have used more cinnamon and maybe some almond extract. The vanilla was overpowered by the sour flavor.

I just made these cookies for a cookie exchange and they are WONDERFUL! I've owned a cookie press for years and never had the nerve to try making some. I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out exactly as I hoped. I will definitely be making more of these!

these are great, delicate cookies.  The orange zest overpowers the cinnamon a bit, so if you want more spice, you may want to up the cinnamon.  I liked them just the way they are!

These were phenomonal!!  I didn't have an orange to zest so I did without it, I also doubled th cinnamon, added some almond extract and added a tsp of nutmeg.  The consistency of the dough was absolutly perfect.  The end result was a lite, crispy cookie with INCREDIBLE flavor.  My huband said it was a perfect Christmas cookie, which is what I was hoping for, and without the nutmeg is would e a perfect yearround cookie.  Give this recipe a try!!!!!

I started my baking experiments with this recipe and am now an awesome baker. This recipe is easy, foul-proof and delicious. My parents love the taste of these and ask me to make them all the time. And because it's so easy to do - I dont' mind :) YUM YUM YUM! Great with tea and coffee!

This was ok. I did not add orange zest. I think it needs more flavor - perhaps in the form of frosting. It just seemed a little dry. I liked the idea of cream cheese in the recipe, but I will probably try other recipes.

I made this one and the "butter rich spritz butter cookies" from this site I liked this one better, it did  remind me of a lemon cookie I personally will omit the orange zest next time and you can taste the cinnamon but it's good and not too much,  it's a crisp cookie and came out of my pampered chef press easy!  Thanks

Yum, yum! Some of the best butter-spritz type cookies I have ever made/eaten! I too added a splash of almond, which was good, but the subtle flavor of the orange zest is the best thing going for this cookie!

These were really good.  They cooked way faster than ther recipe said, but it could have been that my cookie press made very small cookies.

Decided to try this recipe with my brand new Williams Sonoma cookie press after much research.  Only change was using low fat cream cheese.  Consistency was good and didn't need to be refrigerated.  Worked very well with several of the designs and not so well with others, but that could me since this was my first time using the cookie press. 
Smells wonderful during baking; good flavor.  Husband said this was a keeper! Will definitely use this as one of my standard recipes for the cookie press.

This recipe worked wonderfully in my cookie press.  Cookies held their shape coming out of the press and through the baking.  I used the 3oz of cream cheese as stated and they came out great.  No crumbling or stickiness. The recipe says it makes 36 servings, though it says the original recipe (I didn't scale it) makes 72.  Regardless, I got 106 Valentine's heart cookies out of my press with this.  I used the Sugar Cookie Glaze to decorate them.

I did have to watch them very carefully in the oven.  On the darker of my nonstick baking sheets, the cookies were starting to burn after 10 minutes in my gas oven.  The small regular tray I tried in my toaster oven came out great in about 12.5 minutes.

I made these cookies two days in a row because they were so good.  Both times I substitued butter with butter flavored shortening.  The dough was too dry for me to use in my press, so the first time I used about 1/2 cup milk and the second time I used 3 oz. more of cream cheese.  It came out great each time.  I had a neighbor stop by and ask what I was making because they smelled so good.  I gave her some of the cookies and she couldn't believe they weren't store bought they were so delicious.

These are the best butter cookies I have ever had!!! I added 8 oz cream cheese, then followed the rest of the recipe. They came out beautifully in my press (1st time user)! I can't wait to make these part of my holiday tradition!

This recipe is the best I've made using a cookie press. I've made other recipes that the cookie tasted bland. This has a good flavor. I did add the 8 oz. of cream cheese instead of the 3 oz. I did not add the orange zest (personal preference). I made one dozen with a very small dallop of jam in the center and they were wonderful. My kids loved them. This recipe made 7 dozen small cookies.

These are a nice twist to the regular spritz cookie, but next time I won't add as much orange zest and maybe a little bit more cinnamon.

Good taste.. Too sticky for cookie press.. Increased sifted organic flour to 2 1/2 c., added an additional 1/4 c. Baker's sugar.. Did use a Clementine rind for zest! Yummy! Refrigerated for an hour to firm up. Used orange sugar on top.. FUN!

I used the recipe as is and tinted half the dough green to make spritz trees. The orange zest gives the cookies a great and "not typical spritz" flavor. I did not notice the taste of the cream cheese.  The dough held up well and pressed easily and the cookies freeze beautifully. Definitely a keeper.

Not too bad! I had a hardtime using my cookie press for these, however - the dough was a little too crumbly. I added a little bit of orange extract to lighten it up and just went with rolled cookies instead of shapes. They got rave reviews at a work function!

I enjoyed the flavor the orange zest and cream cheese gave the cookie, but I found the cookies to be a bit hard and crunchier than I would like.  I even tried adjusting the baking time to make sure I wasn't over baking.  They were superb directly out of the oven, but once they were cooled, they were a bit hard.

I wish that knew how you folks got this sticky dough to work in the cookie press. I had to keep putting the dough in the fridge and the cookie press in the freezer so that it would actually make cookies. Sometimes the dough was so soft it would just come out in blobs. Other times, the cookies were lovely. And, no, it wasn't my cookie press. It worked beautifully with all the other recipes I tried.

Be that as it may, the cookies taste wonderful. The orange flavor is so refreshing. I even put orange food coloring in mine and topped them with chopped pecans. Yummy.

I do not like orange so I left that out.  This is one of the best spritz cookie recipes I have tried.  I actually think it could use more than 3oz. cream cheese.  I also dipped the backs in chocolate, yum!

These were not the best cookies I have made, they did not have the taste I was looking for.  Way too much of a cream cheese flavor.  Sorry.

I made these cookies for the first time and they are going to be a Christmas tradition!  The only problem I had was learning to use a cookie press.  Unlike some of the other reviews, I loved the orange zest.  It's very subtle.

Yum!  Very easy.  I made it without the orange zest because I'm not crazy about orange-flavored sweets.  Turned out great, kids and husband loved them.

This is a very good recipe. I used my Pampered Chef cookie press which made very darling little cookies very easily. Mine were done in less time than the recipe suggests, but I have an older oven. Thank you.

Very good and easy spritz recipe. This has become a family and friends favorite. I use real orange zest to enhance the orange flavor.

I love spritz cookies and decided to try something other then almond flavor. Thought they were very good and everyone else seemed to like them.

I omitted the orange as others did.  They were moist and worked well.  The cream cheese was a different twist -- spritz I am used to do not include this.  Good recipe.

Was able to make a balky cookie press work with this!  Left out cinnamon and vanilla and used a tiny bit of lemon flavoring (Lorann brand) for the dough and frosting, too.  Made heart-shaped cookies that turned out very nicely.  Thanks!

This was the first time i ever used a 'cookie press' I was so impressed with it and this recipe is perfect for the press. The cookies were delicious. and i'll definitely be making them again. Made loads though - not that that was a problem!! Yum yum.

This did not taste much different from any other Spritz cookie.  I was not impressed.

I found this turned out to be very salty.  I had to add more orange peel and cream cheese.  I will not make these again.

My kids loved them. My 2 year old doesn't like cookies and she ate these up. 

It was my first time making pressed cookies and this was a breeze. Quick and easy!

I really didn't care for the cream cheese flavor in these...also, they didn't want to come out of the cookie press right, although that could have been my fault as this is the first time I've ever used one.
