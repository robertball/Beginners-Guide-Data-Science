This is just great, but I do follow other's advice and omit the eggs and more than double up the mont. jack, cheddars and mozzerella (which I had on hand instead of muenster).  I used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2 as well.  I mix up the Velveeta cubes until they're melted and then mix in the shredded cheeses real well too, before adding in the rest.  Also I bake for 17 minutes and then do some more mixing and then sprinkle the last of the cheese and butter on top for the remaining 17 or so minutes.  That's the magic ticket for me.

YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM!  WOW-thanks for the delicious recipe!  I modified the recipe a bit per the other reviews:  No eggs, 2 cups half-and-half, extra shredded cheese (I used about 2/3 cup of each of the four cheeses), no black pepper.  I also modified the directions significantly (ONLY BAKED FOR 15 MINUTES TO AVOID THE "DRY-MAC", along with some other modifications!):
Directions:
1.  Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2.  Shred all 4 cheeses (not including the Velveta).  Mix them together.  Set aside.
3.  Put half-and-half in a small pot.  Add the cubed Velveta.  Turn the stove on low and cook until the half-and-half is warm (not boiling) and the Velveta is melted.
4.  Meanwhile, while you are waiting for the Velveta to melt, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Add pasta and cook for 7 1/2 minutes, or until al dente; drain WELL and return to cooking pot.
5.  Melt 8 Tablespoons (1 stick) butter in the microwave.  Pour melted butter all over the hot noodles.  Then pour the pot of half-and-half/Velveta in and stir.  Then add ALL the shredded cheese and mix until well combined.  Then salt to taste.
6.  Melt remaining 2 Tablespoons butter in the microwave.  Add some bread crumbs from a can to the butter.
7.  Pour the Macaroni and Cheese into the baking dish.
8.  Sprinkle the bread crumb/butter mixture over the top of the Macaroni and Cheese.
9.  Bake for 15 minutes at 350 degrees
10.  THEN, broil for a couple of minutes until the bread crumbs are golden brown.  Serve im

This is an EXCELLENT, rich recipe.  I made some changes.  I doubled the recipe for a large group. I melted the butter in a pot on the stove, added the Velveeta cheese, then half the halfnhalf and half skim milk, then the schredded cheeses.  I was continually stiring with a rubber spatula and slowly adding all the cheese.  When it melted completely, I took it off the heat.  Then I tempered the beaten eggs with some of the warm cheese mixture.  I then added the elbows, s & p, beaten eggs and warm cheese mixture.  Stirring.   Then baked in a glass pan.  I did not sprinkle cheese on top or dot with butter.  Preparing it this way gives it a nice creamy consistancy.  It was great.  This is a great recipe for guests, but for everyday I still make the Down Home Macaroni and Cheese recipe from this site.  Thanks.

This is just a take on Patti LaBelle's recipe. If you use the original recipe (1/2 cup more half-and-half, and bring the cream to a boil and really make a true cheese sauce) you will not get the horrible consistency.

This recipe was fabulous...WITH a few minor modifications.  After reading other reviews, I omitted the eggs, doubled the shredded cheeses, and used 2 C. Half & Half.  Then...

Cook macaroni until al dente.  Return to cooking pot and mix with 1/4 C. butter.  Set aside.

Melt 1/4 C. butter in a saucepan.  Stir in 1/4 C. flour.  Gradually stir in 2 C. Half & Half.  Cook, stirring constantly over medium heat, until sauce thickens.  Stir in salt and pepper.  Stir in cheeses.  Cook, stirring constantly until cheeses are melted.  Mix with macaroni and transfer to a lightly greased casserole dish.  Top with some shredded cheese and 1 Tbs. butter.  Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until cheeses on top are melted.

This process helps give it a much creamier texture--like Stouffer's.  YUM YUM!!!!!!  :)

***UPDATE***  Although I enjoyed this recipe with the changes I made, I decided (despite my doubts and the opinions of other reviewers) to try following the original recipe, with the only change being doubling the cheeses.  OH MY GOODNESS, my search for the ultimate mac & cheese ended there!  It was the creamiest, gooiest, cheesiest mac & cheese I have ever had!  I threw out all my other mac & cheese recipes and decided this will be the one my kids will grow up on.  Delicious!

I made this Christmas Day - to my family's amazement-everything I made was superb.  My son-in-law ate this and normally doesn't care for Mac and Cheese - doubled the recipe and still none leftover.  I followed the suggestions of previous reviewers and omitted the eggs, melted all the cheeses in a sauce pan and then mixed with the pasta.  Your family is in for the BEST mac and cheese they ever had with this recipe.

Excellent! I only used one egg because I like it creamy & cheesy, not fluffy. I served this to company and they loved it. It really makes a LARGE amount. You can add milk & reheat the next day.

This was very good... [Note: I probably shouldn't actually rate it, since I didn't follow the directions in any way, shape or form, but I used (most of) the same ingredients].  I used Monterey Jack, Sharp Cheddar, Mild Cheddar, and Fontina cheese.  I melted butter in large saucepan over medium heat, then added half-and-half until very warm.  I added the Velveeta until it was nearly completely melted, then included the rest of the cheeses, and added some garlic powder, ground mustard and paprika for some extra flavor.  Next, I poured the creamy cheese mixture over the slightly cooked macaroni, added it to a greased casserole dish, and sprinkled with a mixture of plain bread crumbs and Parmesan cheese.  It was quite good, very rich and creamy.  So thank you so much for the incredibly indulgent idea, though I won't make this very much due to the high fat and calorie content (much to husband's dismay)! ......................................... UPDATE:  I made it this way the night before a work pot luck & my co-workers raved... even microwaved.  The more cream & butter, the better!

I haven't tried this recipe but it is VERY similar to mine so I assume it's good 8-)) At any rate I use 5 cheeses instead of four. I use Muenster, Monterey Jack, KRAFT Shredded Mild Cheddar, KRAFT Shredded Sharp Cheddar and the kicker, VELVETTA. I buy the 16oz stick and use more than half. I cut the velvetta in small cubes. I also use 2 sticks of butter and 2 cups of half & half. In addition the basic recipe call for only a 1/2 cup of the cheeses however I use more. Which makes for a cheese, creamy mac n cheese. DELICIOUS! It is a hit everytime. I made it over a dozen times now and the prep time takes me less than 15 mins now. One more thing thats essential is to serve it HOT! Fresh out the oven. I made some last night with wild rice, fried chicken wings and cheese-brocoli, can you said YUMMMMMY! 8-)) Try it you would LOVE it!

For more then 25 years I have been living in UK(England & Scotland). Mc and Cheese has been a staple diet in this country for many more years before I came here. I cooked it many times too but never heard so fattening version and with use of processed cheese???!! + use of other weird cheeses(exept from versions of cheddar).Make basic white sauce add cheeses,salt,lots of pepper.Add finely cut bacon fried with onions(in olive oil), tin of chopped tomatoes,mixed herbs.Add extra cheese on the top.Put in the oven. Grill or heat for 10-20min.Serve with green salad.

This macaroni & cheese was absolutely phenominal! I got many raves! I did make a few changes though, following other peoples reviews. I used 8 TBLSP. of butter instead of 9. I melted the butter in a small saucepan, & then added 2 CUPS of half and half. I heated it through for a few minutes, & then added the cheeses, which I doubled, excluding the Velveeta. I only used 1 egg, and then tempered it into the cream/butter/cheese mixture. I then added salt & pepper to taste, 1/2 TSP dry mustard, & 1/2 TSP hot sauce. I stirred to combine, & then combined the cheese sauce with the macaroni. (I used shells.) I poured the macaroni & cheese into a baking dish, & sprinkled the top with orange cheddar, sharp white cheddar, & the remaining shredded cheeses I had left over from the cheese sauce. I sprinkled the top with parmesan/romano blend, & also topped it with melted butter & bread crumbs. It baked at 350 for 15 minutes, and was phenominal. I will definetley make this again.

This is a good recipe, but I didn't follow exactly. For one thing, I omitted the eggs since I like it creamy and eggs cause it to be more "firm." I used Havarti cheese, Kraft Four Cheese blend, Velvetta, and cheddar. I used more than the recipe called for. Also, I don't top it with the cheddar because when that cooks on top it doesn't stay creamy. 
The Havarti was so good in the mix that I am now assigned to bring Mac and Cheese to all family events.

I've been making this recipe for years for my family for Christmas Dinner. May I say, all these changes have complicated this dish!!.  In it's original form it's simple and delish!!  Just cook up the pasta elDente!! Drain.  Melt 1 stick of butter into pasta. Mix 4oz each freshley shredded cheddar, monterey jack, mozzarella (good quality NO CHEAP CHEESE here. IF you don't use good quality cheese you won't have good mac n cheese). Cube up 8 ox Veleveeta. Mix cheeses into pasta coated w/butter. Beat up 4 eggs in separate bowl.  Add 2  C 1/2 n 1/2.  Fold into pasta.  Pour into buttered casserole. Bake 350 deg. for 30 min or until hot and bubbly!!  Don't mess w/this recipe. Tip: Can be made ahead and refrigerated until baked, but it will be a little drier due to pasta soaking up some of the liquids.

First let me say that Patti LaBelle should be credited with this recipe; "Over the Rainbow Macaroni and Cheese" is in her cookbook. I've been making it - with some changes - for about 8 years and am now sort of famous for her recipe! I like a creamier consistency than the original recipe produces and I just couldn't use half and half! I make a white sauce (as another reviewer suggested) using whole or 2% milk, butter, flour, salt & pepper. Then I use more of the four real cheeses (not quite double the original amounts) and a little less Velveeta (Patti says you have to use Velveeta for the creamy texture!. After the white sauce has thickened, the cheeses are stirred in until melted; then stir into the cooked macaroni and bake until bubbling. If I'm feeling very retro, I top it with crushed corn flakes or bread crumbs tossed with a little melted butter (just like the 60s!). Or, you could just sprinkle more cheese on the top. Fabulous recipe! I promise you will be a legend! Just remember to give Patti some of the credit!

The BEST!! I have tried all kinds of recipies, and cook for a Mac & Cheese aficionado who agrees this one is the best, I have made several variations including a no-bake, and a "grown-up" version with chicken, bacon and onions, but no matter what you do YOU NEED THE EGGS!!! Having left them out on accident once, believe me they are worth the effort (just make sure you get them well mixed before they begin to cook) and they will keep the dish from getting hard and gelatinous as it cools, and help with the creamy texture as well. I also recommend the munster as it adds a sofisticated tase (not overpowering). I have decided that my favorite way to cook it (with or without baking) is to mix all the ingredients together (minus the macaroni) in a sauce pan to ensure proper melting of the cheeses then pouring over the noodles. That seems to yield the best texture and creamyness! This is also when I fold in sauted chicken, bacon and onions for the "grown-up version (more of a main dish than a side dish). Peppers work too!

Absolutely the best mac and cheese ever, and the recipe couldn't be simpler.  We used a little more cheese (about 3/4 cup of each) and it came out perfect.

This is much like my family recipe, we always layered it in a huge bowl instead of mixing it up.  We never use processed cheese, we never considered it real cheese. We have used all kinds of cheese, usually the left over cheese tray after the Holidays makes a great feast. We always add a little dry mustard to bring out the taste of the cheese and we add Lawry's season salt to add to the taste.
It is our family comfort food and if you know anyone on chemo, it really tends to settle well when they don't feel good. My Mom lived on it through two fights with breast cancer.  It is a great food!!!

This is what I have been making for 2 years at every holiday meal my family has.  I made a few changes:  3/4 cup of the 4 cheeses instead of 1/2, 2 cups of half-and-half instead of 1 1/2 and only used 1 egg instead of 2.  I add the beaten egg to the macaroni noodles with the butter, heated the half-and-half in a large pot over low heat, add the processed cheese until melted and then add the 4 cheeses until all is melted.  I then poured the macaroni into the cheese mixture, mixed it all up and poured it in my casserold dish.  I only bake it for 20-25 minutes.  It is awesome and since I only bake it 3 or 4 times a year, I don't feel so guilty for going back for seconds (okay, thirds).

This is a sinfully good mac & cheese. So creamy and flavorful - love it. The only thing I added was panko Italian seasoned bread crumbs coated with a little melted butter.  The crumbs really added a nice touch. Great recipe! Thanks.

The first time I made this recipe, I followed the recipe exactly.  It was very good but not very creamy.  The second time, I used an extra cup of sharp cheddar and omitted the eggs.  It made a huge difference!  It was so much creamier and much better all around.  We couldn't stop eating!

This was alright mac and cheese, but for all the money we spent on cheese we expected something a whole lot cheesier. If we decide to make this again, which we are on the fence about, we would use cheeses with a bolder, stronger flavor to them and perhaps add some mustard powder and some hot sauce before poring it into the pan to make it a little less bland.

I HAVE BEEN MARRIED 25 YEARS AND MY HUSBAND SAID I CAN FINALLY MAKE MACARONI AND CHEESE.  HE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT!  AS SUGGESTED BY OTHERS I INCREASED THE VELVEETA CHEESE TO 16 OUNCES AND INCREASED HALF AND HALF TO 2 CUPS.  GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

We loved this.

I did make a few changes, but kept the process the same.  I skipped the eggs.  I've used them before and didn't quite like the texture.  I did like that this recipe doesn't make a roux (I like mine cheesey and not too creamy)

Also skipped the cheese food and salt.

Used heavy cream.  Used cheddar, monterey jack, havarti and applewood smoked gruyere.  Also threw some bread crumbs on top, but prepared it otherwise the same.

Okay, I followed the ingredients exactly except did not use the eggs and only used 4 TBS of butter.. I warmed the half and half in a saucepan and added all the cheese and butter. I warmed on Medium heat until smooth. I then added to the cooked pasta and tasted it! OMG it was great. But the directions said to put in the oven so I did. FAIL! Thats when the fats from the cheese separated and the pasta dried out. (I cover the pan with foil even).  SO long story short, cook pasta and add the cheese/creamy mixture and eat. THEN it would be 5 stars!

This recipe had so many great reviews, so I decided to give it a shot. Of course on this website I've been trained to read all reviewer's suggestions for an optimum dish. I don't understand why anyone would give this recipe five stars WHEN NO ONE ACTUALLY USED THE RECIPE. Every review had a different story, different modifications, so I decided to try and follow the original recipe with the ONLY common modification of doubling cheeses and half-and-half. The result was horrendous! The cheese was chunky (BAD!! consistency) and almost overbearing, no one liked it at all. :( Just macaroni in a fattening and chunky mystery sauce...

I can't figure out what all the rave reviews are about. I made this recipe exactly as written and was unimpressed.  Not enough cheese to pasta ratio.  Maybe doubling the cheese would help.  The flavor wasn't bad, but my 3 year old who loves macaroni and cheese wouldn't eat this.  It wasn't creamy like mac n' cheese should be, it was dry.  I was looking for a recipe that was better than the one I have used for years and this is not it.  I think the best base for mac n' cheese is a roux made into a cheese sauce.  I will keep searching for an ultimate macaroni and cheese recipe.

Mmmmmmm ~ ! After several failed attempts at delicious homemade mac and cheese, I'v finally found it.  Heated 1/2 stick of butter with 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2. Salt and pepper.. Then added the Velveeta to make a nice creamy sauce. Puured over noodles and shredded cheeses. Stirred in a 1/4 C. light sour cream. No eggs.  Topped with more shred ched, french fried onions and paprika. Then baked. Soooo creamy & indulgent but worth it! Make this special treat for the ones you love!! =)

definately an winner!  Made this twice in two days for social get-togethers.
Like most others, changed the recipe a bit.  Used one egg, 2 cups of half and half, all cheddar was sharp cheddar and increased cheddar by 1/2 cup.  Heated half and half in sauce pan then added processed cheese, stirring until melted. Then added the shredded cheese and the egg.  Kept stiring until creamy and mostly melted.  Poured egg/cheese/milk mixture onto melted butter noodles, completely mixed all and poured into baking dish.

Made this recipe on a rainy cool day (comfort food), and my family adored it. Warm, comforting, good tasting and super easy to make. I added cracker crumbs and Parmesan cheese on the top with a bit of melted butter and it came out great. This recipe will be saved and used many times again!

Liked the idea of the different cheeses, but was leary about the baking method. I stuck to my old standby to ensure a creamy cheese sauce. I made a roux, added the half and half, some seasonings including dry mustard, stirred until thickened, turned off the heat and then added my cheeses. I didn't measure the cheese, but I used much more than stated. I used fontina instead of the muenster and replaced asiago for one of the cheddars. Wasn't quite sure what purpose the eggs served so I left those out. I then melted a few tablespoons of butter in my skillet and mixed in panko crumbs to top off my casserole. Again, the various types of cheese is what drew me to this dish and it was a really nice change from my usual cheddar only recipe. Thanks Kim!

This was so good!  I used milk because I didn't have half & half.  I didn't use vegetable oil or drizzle mac & cheese with a tablespoon of butter.  I added 1/4 tsp minced garlic & 1/2 tsp minced onion.  I didn't have sharp cheddar so I used medium cheddar.  I combined all the cheese, milk, eggs, & spices in the baking dish.  Then stirred in the cooked noodles & baked for 1/2 hr.     Will definitely make again & would serve this dish to company, however double the recipe because my family ate the whole thing!

This was very very good! I made a few changes based on what I had. I used sharp cheddar, pepper jack, and mozzarella, all of which i upped the amount on. Also as others suggested, i didn't use eggs. Here what I did: cook noodles to al dente, strain and put into separate bowl. Mix noodles with melted butter. In large sauce pan, add cream and warm. Add "velveeta" and melt. Once melted, add other cheese slowly until melted. Add noodles and some cooked, chopped hot italian sausage & chopped jalepenos (wanted a meaty, spicy dish!). Spread in baking dish, bake 17 minutes, stir, sprinkle with cheese, and bake for another 17. YUM.

EXCELLENT!  I used all sharp cheddar rather than regular cheddar and sharp. I made a cheese sauce by heating up the half and half and melting the cheese into it.  After I made the cheese sauce, I tempered the eggs into it (in the egg bowl, I slowly added a little of the hot mixture at a time, acclimating the eggs to the heat so that they wouldn't scramble).  I put the noodles in the baking dish and mixed in the cheese sauce.  Since I made this the night before Thanksgiving, I put it in the fridge and the next day, I took it out and let it get to room temperature, added some more cheese on top as a crust and baked as directed.  EVERYONE raved about it and I think we found our new mac and cheese recipe!

Great recipe IF modified. I recently made it for an early Thanksgiving dinner party and everyone loved it, no leftovers! I warmed 2 cups of half and half and butter, then addded Velveeta cheese. Once melted, I then stirred in 1 teaspoon dry mustard, and 1 teaspoon paprika along with the s&p. These spices give it a nice deep taste to the dish. Then add the shredded cheeses and melt it all together. I poured it onto a pound of rotini pasta (the spirals are good at holding in sauce, and i prefer the texture) and stirred it all together. Topped with some shredded sharp cheddar and baked it for ~20 minutes. Very rich and delcious!

I changed this recipe too, with much better results.  Left out the eggs, and made a cheese sauce by heating the half-and-half (I used whole milk instead) with about a tablespoon of flour until smooth and beginning to thicken.  Add 8 ounces of sharp cheddar, 8 ounces of jack or mozerella, and 8 ounces of american or velveeta cheese.  Stir on low heat until cheese is melted and sauce smooth.  Mix with the macaroni and bake.

I made this for Christmas dinner and got rave reviews from the family. Like others I only did one egg so it would not be to dry. I also added two tablespoons of dry mustard and used heavy whipping cream since I was out of half and half. I did not have all the cheeses so I just doubled up on some to replace what I did not have.
My husband said this is the best mac and cheese he ever had, so I will be making this again and again.

Made this recipe for Christmas last year and it was such a hit I was asked to make it again for this year's holiday dinner.  I did not change the recipe.  We will be using it as a family holiday staple dish for years to come.

I made this earlier today and it's wonderful. I omitted the butter and left everything as is. Nice and creamy, and it's great as leftovers. The calorie count is high, so solve the problem by not eating it every day (and review it AFTER trying the recipe). :)

This recipe was great. It is exactly like Patti Labelle's famous recipe for macaroni and cheese. Like Patti, a variation can be made if no half & half is used. When she omits the half & half, she subsitutes milk, but uses 2 sticks of butter instead. This is the way I did it, but doubled the recipe. The next time, I will add more spices, more seasoned salt and garlic powder for addl flavor. Very good recipe, the only one I will use from now on. Thanks for submitting.

You have to remember, because of pasturization on cheese now, it's not like the 50's and 6o's when it was real and you never heard of cheese foods. The cheese will develope small clumps for the oil that is in it. 
No way around it. Learn to add more liquid than the recipe calls for and you will come out with a better product.

My boyfriend said that this was the best macaroni and cheese he's ever had! I changed the following: 2 cups half and half, 1/2 a cup of milk, 1 1/2 sticks of butter. I just used the cheese I had on hand, about half a stick of Velveeta, 1 cup of colby jack and 1 cup of Amish Bleu cheese. I added a small white onion to the butter and sauteed it for a minute before adding the macaroni. Half way through cooking I took it out of the oven, mixed if up to make sure the cheese was fully incorporated and then added a breadcrumb topping of plain bread crumbs, olive oil and garlic salt. I cooked it a bit longer than listed to make sure it was nice and crisp on the top! It was AMAZING!! I'm making this for my boyfriend's family reunion this year.

Like a reviewer before me (Linda) I was nervous about the cooking method. So, instead I sauted some onions with a little white wine, made a roux, added my milk (I used canned evaporated instead. It's got a nice creamy flavour). I then added my cheese (Aged Cheddar, Imperial, Monteraty Jack, and Havarty) and let them all melt in. I didn't measure anything, just eyeballed it all. I then added my cooked pasta to that, put it in a baking dish, and sprinkled it with Parm before baking it for about 25 mins. Turned out very nice in the end. :)

I love this recipe.  Took advice from other reviews.  Omit eggs.  Double the cheese.  Also 10 minutes is too long to boil the pasta to have it be al dente.  Make sure not to over cook it or everything will come out too mushy.  I hate leftovers normally, but I love these leftovers.

One word can describe this recipe: YUMMY! But I altered the recipe a bit: left out the eggs, DOUBLED the real cheeses, used LARGE elbow macaroni instead of small, and used Mozzerella instead of Muenster. Everyone loved this recipe, and it made more then enough. To reheat, we added a little bit more milk, or it would of dried out. This was SOO rich, it was *ALMOST* too much. This is a big no no for you dieters! Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is a very good macaroni & cheese.  Perfect southern homestyle cooking.  All very good macaroni recipes consistently use Velveeta & Half-Half.  Decadent, I know.  But worth it.  Most macaroni & cheese dishess need a little extra salt as well.  So I added to this one.  Great recipe!!

This is another one of my holiday regulars! I use this recipe every year. I did make some changes....I use mozzerella instead of muenster (I never use muenster!) and omit the egg (I don't see the need for it). The first time I made it I found it a bit dry, so I add a little more liquid ingredients. I like my macoroni creamy.

incredibly creamy and delicious recipe. i did as others did and added almost 2c half&half, but i heated it on very low heat first and added the velveeta cubes to the liquid so it could start to melt. i then added that to the penne (no elbows at the store)/butter mixture, and stirred till the velveeta was just started to melt into the pasta. added about 2-2.5c shredded cheese, eggs, garkuc salt and pepper, then baked for about 20 minutes and broiled the cheese on top to get a nice crispy coating. delicious! and everyone at thanksgiving dinner loved it

This was okay, but I like the "Macaroni and Cheese with Caramelized Onions and Bacon" a LOT better.  This one seemed bland in comparison.

I went straight from the recipe above with only 3 minor changes…1) I double it all because I need more.  2) I used pasta other than elbow macaroni (because I wanted the effect of longer tubes) but it was still macaroni-ish.  3) I replaced the regular cheddar with Colby because I wanted the leftovers for cubes. ?  Bottom line…Except for the Colby I really didn’t deviate from the main recipe’s intent for texture and flavor and it was awesome!   Yes I did have some dryness issues, but not from lack of liquid, what dried was any pasta that was exposed without sauce so I will either cover or stir once or twice next time.  I’ll also cut the cubes much smaller so I can spread them out more evenly and make an effort to pack it all in with no pasta sticking out, something I couldn’t do with my extended curly tubes.  Try this recipe as-is once folks, you won’t be disappointed.  When you double JUST the cheese you alter the consistency and also the cost! …it didn’t need it.   [Review #2]  I made this a second time as-as for all ingredients although doubled EVERYTHING again.  I baked it in my slow cooker crock in the oven so I could just toss it in the slow cooker the next day to reheat and it came out of the over awesome.  Next day in the SC however was not as good..it separated..so next time it's fresh out of the over or nothing!

Way to much cheese!!! We could only eat a small amount and ended up throwing most of it away. Next time I will cut the cheese in half and leave out the velvetta completly.

I make this all the time and it's fantastic!  There are several required modifications, which is why I put it at a four stars: (1) Use 4 Tbsp max of butter when first mixing with the pasta, 9 is overkill (2) Use 1 cup mozz, 2 cups cheddar/jack blend, 1 cup sharp cheddar for the shredded mix, only add 3 cups of this to start with (3) Omit Eggs (4) Halfway through baking, remove the dish and mix up to better combine the melted Velveeta and shredded cheeses.  Then add the remaining 1 cup of shredded mixture on top to give some crunch to the top layer.

Finally a homemade mac and cheese worth making!  Macaroni and cheese has been my favorite food for years, and I have tried countless recipes, always feeling disappointed.  I travel long distances frequently to go to Noodles & Company to get their mac and cheese because I've never found a replacement.  This is it!  Kids loved it - I loved it - potluck guests loved it.  The only changes I made was that I increased the half and half to 2 cups and omitted the eggs and baked for only 15 minutes.  I like CREAMY mac and cheese, not cakey, which has been my primary complaint with other recipes.  I have to say, though that next time I will either not bake it, or I will undercook the noodles.  Baking turned the noodles mushy, not affecting the taste, but it made it seem more mushy rather than creamy.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

WOW!! I followed the recipe as written with few minor exceptions. I doubled all of the cheeses, added an extra 1/2 cup half and half, used shell pasta instead of elbow and also added in some strips of chicken breast. This is THE best mac and cheese EVER!  ***TIP*** I stirred this every 10 minutes throughout the cook time. That really helped get the cheeses mixed well and kept the noodles on top from drying out.

Delicious recipe! My family loved it. I substituted Muenster with another cheese because I couldn't find Muenster.  Very creamy and decadent (not to be eaten everyday lol).

This was the best mac and cheese I have ever had. I made it for a dinner party and everyone raved! I did take the suggestions and doubled the cheese (not the cheese food), omited the eggs and used 2C of half and half- it was perfect!

This is really rich, decadent, and yummy mac n cheese. I have made this a few times now with other reviewers suggestions; 1/2 cup extra 1/2 and 1/2, no eggs, and adding extra cheese plus some paprika. It's always delicious. I've baked it as well as cooked it in a slowcooker for Easter and another party. I followed the recipe and steps in order as usual but just threw it in the crockpot on high for two hours. I always toss my shredded cheese with a little bit of flour and I haven't had any of the consistancy issues. Crowd pleaser and great recipe!

Very good flavor, even my "box baby" loved it - the first night. The leftovers are not as great. I may make this again, but still searching for the perfect homemade mac-n-cheese. Thanks for the recipe!

I followed Patti Labelle's recipe (off of the Oprah website), which means I used 1/2 c. extra half-and-half.  It was totally delicious.  I made it on Christmas Eve and baked it for 15 minutes, then covered and cooled and refrigerated it overnight.  I then baked it for 30 minutes on Christmas day, and it was a hit.  Very fattening and creamy and delish.  I used Jane's Krazy mixed up salt instead of plain salt.  I let all the cheeses (including Velveeta) melt before moving on to the next addition (i.e. eggs, salt, pepper).  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  I didn't notice any weird texture issues.

I modified the recipe adding bacon bits and using different cheeses, but this was a HIT!!! I took in to my company Picnic lunch and it flew! Only thing I would prefer it more creamy, so less eggs. Either way it was delish! :)

If you add 1 cup of Velveeta/processed cheese, the recipe is perfect.  This is the same as Patty LaBelle's Over The Rainbow Mac & Cheese recipe.  I've been making it for years.

Sorry, but this recipe isn't quite right for some reason.  I don't know if it's the eggs or lack of starting with a roux, or what.  Good point is that it's really rich. And the bad is the egg, not enough cheese taste, and it was very bland.  I would make homemade mac 'n cheese again, but I'll keep searching for another recipe.

Very delicious and creamy.  I sprinkled some extra sharp cheddar on top for a little extra zing, and it turned out nearly perfect.  Next time, I'll use 1/2 tsp of salt instead of 1/4.  Several people voiced that it needed a little more salt.

I made this for a family party and it was a big hit with both kids and adults. I did feel a little guilty for serving this dish because it is not exactly a healthy recipe and I even reduced the amount of half and half and butter. It was very tasty, though. Just not the kind of food you would want to eat on a regular basis. I'll be exercising all week to undo this damage...

THE BEST!  Only used 1 egg, although 2 eggs would be good as well as no eggs....  Heck, this recipe is good no matter how you make it!  May use a pinch of cayenne pepper next time.  This is now my "go to" recipe for Mac 'n Cheese.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but for me this was just okay.  It seemed a little bland to me and I added extra cheese.  Maybe a different combination of cheeses would be better.  Maybe if I make it next time I won't bake it because it had more flavor before it was baked (I didn't use the egg).

Baked mac n cheese is a dream and can not be compared to the box stuff. I have made this a few times and now I have made a permanent alteration to the recipe: breadcrumbs. After the mac n cheese is in the dish, I sprinkle enough bread crumbs to cover the surface and I do not top it with the remaining butter. So good. Sometimes I have been without processed cheese food, but it still turns out great. I just compensate with more shredded cheese and enough half and half for the cheese sauce to be nice and creamy.

Very rich and creamy! I love mac and cheese, even from the box. But this is nothing like box mac and cheese. Total comfort food

I didn't mind this recipe, but it wasn't great.  I used chard cheddar but other than that followed the recipe.  I really disliked the topping, so if I were to do it again, I would omit that, it make it grainy and I didn't care for it.

The BEST macaroni and cheese! I've used different combinations of cheeses- all have been wonderful.Don't forget to stir part way through. Another note, I think this is more than 6 servings- seems to go a long way!

Really awesome macaroni! I Melted just 8 Tbs of butter in a pan, then added the half n half. Once the milk warmed up I added the cubed processed cheese food and continued to mix until melted. Once melted I added 2 C of mild cheddar and 2 C of Monterrey Jack (I just bought the two bags of cheese) and stirred those in until melted. Then, I turned off the heat and slowly mixed in the beaten eggs. I added a few seasonings (garlic salt, paprika, and pepper) then poured into a dish with with cooked macaroni, then sprinkled a little bread crumbs and a little butter, popped into the oven for about 25 minutes, and it was awesome! You can definitely substitute some of the cheeses with what you have on hand. This turned out nice and creamy and super cheesy!

Super Recipe!! So yummy, i made a few changes, I added some paprika to add a little bit more flavor, and for really creamy mac I used half heavy whipping cream and half of the half and half, this made a huge difference it made it super creamy, and I used vermont cheddar cheese for more flavor as well.

I have made this recipe a few times and it is always a hit! I do add some more 1/2 and 1/2 and cheese, but that's it. I do NOT omit the eggs. For those of you that do, I would say give it a try once, you might be surprised.   I will sometimes add a crushed butter cracker topping. Very nice on it.   This is definitely not a low fat recipe, but I am sure modifications could be made to lower the fat content. For me and my family when we want to treat ourselves or splurge we go for the full on fat recipe! HA!

I made this Mac & Cheese for a potluck lunch at work and my coworkers loved it.  The recipe was followed exactly as written, which resulted in a nice and cheesy M&C.  I will definitely be using this recipe again and again.  Thanks for sharing!

DELICIOUS! I just made this on Saturday for a group of 18. everyone came back for 2nd and 3rds! my oldest son who doesn't like mac and cheese loved it. I used skim milk inplace of the half and half simply to reduce calories. I did melt all the cheeses in a pan with the milk and butter to make a cheese sauces, omitted the eggs, topped with italian style bread crumbs and baked for 30 minutes.  will definately make again!

THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!!!  After 942 reviews and 4 1/2 stars...how could it not be great.  I have three boys, all who like DIFFERENT types of mac-n-cheese.  Finally, a recipe that they ALL LOVE!!  It will make life easier when it comes to dinnertime.  :)  I didn't use the eggs, used 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2, and 1 cup of each shredded cheese.  Melted the Velvetta with the 1/2 & 1/2, then added to the buttered elbow noodles (once they were cooked and drained).  Tried this recipe with baking and without baking; simply delicious either way!.

THIS IS THE BEST MAC & CHEESE I HAVE EVER EATEN!!! I read all the reviews and was torn about what to do...do I tweak it like so many other people did or make it as it is written...Well, I read a review where someone tweaked it the first time and then made it like it originally supposed to be made and said that she should have never changed anything the first time...that made my decision for me and I made it EXACTLY as it is on here and it is PERFECT!! I consider myself a mac and cheese lover since it is my most favorite food and haev tried many many recipes, including Martha Stewarts famous mac & cheese recipe...this eat every other recipe I have ever made hands down...I am eating leftovers as we speak and it's even better the next day...thank you so much for this recipe...it will now be a family favorite and passed to my daughters when they get older to keep it in the family!!!

This recipe was great.  I don't know why but I filled up almost two cassarole dishes.  I learned a trick a couple years ago for macaroni dishes.  I cook the macaroni up per the box directions and then I let it soak in cold water for a couple hours or even overnight.  The macaroni soaks up more water and does not get any more done.  You never end up with a "dry" recipe.  When it was done I added a layer of valveta to the top of it to finish it off.  I imagine you could use which ever cheese you like the most.

Incredibly delicious!  I omitted the egg only, just because I was out.  The sauce was creamy without being to thick or too runny.  This was seriously the BEST MACARONI & CHEESE I EVER ATE!!!  :)

This was a GREAT recipe - although I did make a few changes....as I'm sure we all do :) I left out the eggs and vegetable oil. I also used just sharp cheddar & monterey jack since that is what I had on hand. I just eyeballed the salt and pepper and added some cayenne pepper, which really gave it a nice kick. Will definitely make again!

With modifications this rates 5 stars.  As others suggested I doubled the cheeses, used philadephia cream cheese instead of Velveeda, used aged extra sharpe cheddar and tomato basil cheddar, a mixture of monterey jack, pepper jack and mozzerella and just a bit of grated fontina cheese.  I also used Farfelle pasta instead of elbow macaroni.  Left out the eggs and added a teaspoon of dejon mustard, an 1/8 teaspoon of nutmeg (always add this to my custards for cheese dishes) and 1/4 teaspoon of white pepper.  Used 2 cups half and half and a quarter cup of evaporated milk.  I made a topping with a half cup of the grated cheese mixture and then topped it with seasoned Chrispy Panko bread crumbs mixed with grated parmesan cheese.  Baked for 20 minutes. Now this was yummy, creamy and delish!

Awesome! I even tried making this using all "low-fat" ingredients. I used only 3 tablespoons of butter, all 2% shredded cheeses, low-fat processed cheese food, and egg substitute. It was still fantastic and the boys never new I was trying to cut some of the fat!

I made this as a side for my brisket dinner - to feed a bunch of grown men.  it recieved rave reviews!  i did make a couple changes.  i used 1 cup of the sharp cheddar instead of buying reg. cheddar too.  froze my block of munster before to help with shredding.  i melted the butter in a sauce pan...wisked the half n half into it...then melted the velveta into it...then melted all rest of the cheese.  wisking constantly.  then i just poured and mixed into the noodles.  mixed in the eggs - poured into the baking dish.  and needed to bake only 15min or so till bubbly!  mmm..left overs were great too!

I have made this recipe several times now. Everyone that has tried it, loves it. It is creamy and delicious. I omit the eggs and use 2 cups of half and half. Heat the half and half, add Velveeta and stir until melted, add shredded cheeses and stir until melted. Pour melted butter over cooked macaroni, add cheese mixture, stir. Pour into glass baking dish, add crumbled Ritz crackers to 2 tbs butter and sprinkle over top. Bake for 15 minutes. Excellent!!

I have tried every recipe in the book to made a homemade style macaroni and cheese! Unfortunately each attempt ended poorly. This macaroni and cheese was creamy and delicious and my family gave me the seal of approval. I omitted the egg and increased the half and half to 2 cups as recommended by another reviewer. I also omitted the Muenster cheese as I thought my family wouldn't like it and increased the amout of cheddar,sharp and monterey cheeses. This made it turn out extra creamy. My favorite part about it is the browned cheesey top! This is one of my new favorite recipes! Thanks!

made this for a 1 yr. old birthday party-kids and adults alike loved it! Made several changes. Doubled the recipe for 20 people although didn't really need to- added an extra cup of all cheeses- and some extra Velveeta. Added an extra cup of half and half. The key to the consistency is heating the h and h and adding the cheeses to make a cheese sauce-added the butter to the noodles but not on top--also added half of the eggs to the cheese mixture then mixed with noodles--baked for a total of 45 min. Will definitely make it again and add more zip to it!

Love this rich recipe. This is the 2nd time I've made it. I did increase my cheese mixture to a cup of each and about 11 ounces of velveeta.  I also used about 1/8 teaspoon of cayenne to zap it up a bit. I think evaporated milk would work as well as 1/2&1/2. It's raining on Maui today (hard) and I  am serving this with my bacon wrapped meatloaf and steamed vegis.  Oh the fat!!!! Thanks for this great recipe.

Going by other's suggestions I left out the eggs and doubled the cheese but this turned out greeeeat. Will be making it as a side dish for this Thanksgiving - planning to blow the in-laws out of the water!

This is DELICIOUS!!!! I did add extra cheese and half and half as others suggested and it worked well. This recipe makes WAY more then 6 servings, I have two tupperwares full of it right now. My boyfriend isn't really a mac and cheese fan and he loved it and kept picking at it even after dinner.

Thanks for the great recipe!!

Very good.  I did make some changes per other reviews.  Left out the egg.  Melted the Velveeta cheese in saucepan, mixed all the shredded cheese in a large bowl, adding shredded cheeses to the melted Velveeta until melted, then added the 1/2 and 1/2 until the mixture was smooth (using 2 full cups).  I added the melted butter to the noodles, then added the cheese with salt and pepper and topped with planko.  Cooked for 30 minutes, everyone enjoyed the dish.  It had a nice smooth and creamy sauce that stuck to the noodles but wasn't too thick or too runny. A+++

This was good but I made some revisions after reading other's reviews.  I added an extra 1/2 cup of half and half and about 8 oz of sour cream to keep it from drying out.  I also added some onion powder to the mix and crushed potato chips to the top.

Look no further...I certainly didn't...I've tried several other recipes with moderate success over the years but this one is it...I will never need another recipe for baked macaroni & cheese!  This is beyond delicious and incredibly easy.  I use one egg and the texture was perfect.  The egg makes it kinda like the macaroni pie I've had in the Caribbean but this is much richer and creamier.  I had to omit the muenster the first time I made this since, oddly, my local supermarket didn't have it, and it was still off the hook. A definite OCCASIONAL pleasure given the high calorie count but nontheless...better than any restaurant version of this dish I've had.

I have made this several times and agree with many of the others in doubling the amounts of cheese except for the processed cheese. I have made this with and without the eggs. It was just as good without the eggs. I have also made it with a cup of diced white onion and cubed ham. In any form it is excellent and have received rave reviews on all occasions.

We loved this.  I didn't have the muenster so instead I used Mozz.  I also used whole wheat penne pasta b/c it's what I had and I think that dressed it up a lot.  I was worried about the cheese not melting evenly, so when I melted the butter I added the 1/2 & 1/2 to the pot and then the cheeses to make a cheese sauce.  Once melted I added the pasta and salt/pepper, then put in a dish to go into the oven with the sprinkled cheese on top.  I loved it so much that this will be my contribution to the Easter dinner we will have.

Good macaroni and cheese, was easy to make.  I don't know how much of a difference all the different cheeses makes though.  I only used Munster, jack and sharp chedder.   I think the reason I will keep the recipe around though is it was so easy to make.  Really quick too.

Wow! This was great. The muenster cheese added just the right note of pungency. And actually, this does reheat just fine; you just have to stir a bit of milk in because macaroni has a tendency to dry out. Also, for the BEST macaroni, use the jumbo macaroni, not the regular size. I don't know why that makes a difference, but it does.

Bravo!!  I love a good mild cheesy macaroni.  This was all of those things.  I made it twice in one week.  The second time I added some crushed crackers on top for added crunch.

If you are a cheese lover, then this is the recipe for you! I used the suggested changes by other reviewers (nix the eggs, more cheese, less baking time) and it was so delicious! I also didn't get two kinds of cheddar and instead used mozzarella, which was very yummy. My family ranted and raved about this and I will definitely be using it again.

This is an excellent recipe.  I've made this for pot luck dinners, bbq's, church lunches and family dinners and gatherings. I never have leftovers, I'm always asked for the recipe, and if there is another mac n' cheese on the table mine is the first one gone.  What I like most about this recipe is how versatile it is...I've used different cheeses, I've omitted the egg and made it on the stove top for a quick and easy dinner, and I've changed the recipe to make it a little more heart healthy...and the bottom line is it's still a wonderful meal.  Enjoy!!

My family and I LOVE this mac and cheese.  The only change I make it to double the cheese.  It's so gooey and delicious and we never have leftovers!  I use the eggs in mine, and I find that it holds the dish together nicely without interfering witht the overall spirit of yummy delicious baked mac and cheese.  Try this one!!   You'll want to make it 100 times!

As someone else commented - this recipe is very similar to a Patti Labelle recipe I saw her make on Oprah....I have made it many times before but followed the advice of others and just doubled all the cheeses (except the velveeta) and left the rest of it the same - it was PERFECT!  My kids who really like the boxed dry power stuff were even finally fans!

I followed other reviewers' modifications by using no eggs,  2/3 cup of each cheese (kept the Velveeta amount the same) and made a cheese sauce with 2 cups of half & half. The conistency of this stuff is great when it's fresh and hot - but the cheese sauce kind of gets pasty as it cools. I really like Amy's Kitchen brand frozen mac & cheese, and they use low fat milk. I think I'll try using that next time instead of half & half in order to try to get the sauce to stay more liquid for longer. I put bread crumbs on part of my dish, but didn't think they added much. I also mixed in bacon crumbles, which added A LOT of flavor - delicious! Next time I think I might add some cream cheese or a little more Velveeta to give it more of a creamy, cheesy kick that was lacking this time around - even with the extra cheese. If you're worried about the cost of all that shredded cheese, then go to the deli and just buy exactly what you need. If you use the cheese sauce method then your cheese doesn't need to be shredded, just very thinly sliced - which your deli counter person can do! 2/3 cup of shredded cheese equals about .17 lbs or 2.7 oz. I just ask for a quarter pound of each, but they should be able to give you almost an exact amount if you please. This entire recipe cost me about $10 to make, and I think I got about 8 servings out of it - which makes it pretty cheap at $1.25 per serving. Also, it re-heated just fine with a little splash of milk mixed in.

I tried this with whole wheat pasta and assorted grated cheeses.  I think that it would've been better with regular, white pasta.  Also, I think that Velveeta should've been part of the recipe.

My husband is a fan of the boxed processed mac and cheese. He has declined my offer to make it from scratch for months but I finally convinced him to let me try it. He LOVED it and gave me permission to make it again anytime instead of the boxed kind! 
UPDATE: We made this a second time and omitted the egg and doubled the cheese as others had said. We used Cheddar, Mozzarella, and Pepper Jack. It was perfect! It always makes my day when someone asks for a recipe, which they did at the dinner I took this to! (95)

I really want to give this recipe a 5, because, honestly, the flavor of this macaroni was really good. But if I'm going to rate it fairly, I really just think there is WAY too much butter. I mean, I like butter...I REALLY like butter...but this was soooo greasy! I think I could easily cut back the butter to 4 - 5 Tbsp and it would be perfect. The mixture of cheeses was great, though, so I will definitely be trying this again with just a bit less butter. Thanks for sharing! :o)

Very good stuff.  I omitted the eggs and added more cheese.  Stick to your ribs kind of food.  Very easy to make and has a good flavor.  If you add the egg the consistency of the dish comes out like a frittata.

Fantastic  & fluffy!! I did use the two eggs, i wanted a mac'n'chesse casserole type of dish where the cheese on the inside was fluffy and rich. I omitted the meunster & velveeta & added cream cheese ( i love it btw) it turned out wonderful! i added some parmesan cheese on the top & it was a hit. finally found a mac & cheese dish I LOVE now everyone thinks i can cook...YESSSS!!! ;)

I've been making this for several years as it is almost the same as Patti LaBelle's Over-the-Rainbow Macaroni and Cheese. She appeared both on Oprah and Good Morning America and made this recipe. This recipe uses 1 1/2 cups half and half and Patti LaBelle's uses 2 cups half and half.  It is without a doubt the BEST mac and cheese recipe you will ever make.  Any where I take it I get asked for the recipe.  Glad to see it posted here on allrecipes.com for all to try.

I've tried many homemade mac and cheese recipes and this one is the best, by a mile..  It's perfect enough to become my new mac and cheese recipe!  The only changes I made were: used 2 cups of half and half (definitely keeps it from drying out); I used a little more cheese than it called for...didn't measure, just dumped it in -- also didn't use muenster cheese -- used a mexican blend; sharp cheddar and mozzarella (personal preference) AND I added in the half & half and the cheese when I melted the butter.  The recipe was moist and delicious.

I guess I shouldn't technically review this since I didn't really follow the recipe at all barring using butter and four random kinds of cheese (Haha--I did use the processed cheese food and two cheddars, but I otherwise used this...french kind of cheese, I can't remember the name, and some mozzerella because I had it in my fridge). I also used skim milk and kept the eggs in. It turned out good, though, so hey!

Double the cheese and omitted the processed cheese.  DIdn't think it had enought flavor and wasn't creamy.  Kids loved it but I was expecting a little more.

Wow, this was really good!  I only made minor modifications based on other reviews.  I used 3/4 cup of each of the cheeses (next time I will use a whole cup to be even cheesier), I used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2, and I used 1 egg.  I melted the velveeta and butter and then added the 1/2 and 1/2, then the cheeses slowly. I tempered the egg with the cheese sauce.  It was sooo creamy!!  I only baked it for 20 min.  My husband loved it - he even said it was better than his cousin's, which everyone always raves about! Will definitely be making again!

I've been cooking my mac and cheese this way for years and I noticed that Patti Labelle cooks her's the exact same way as well but I think she uses four eggs which I use also if I'm cooking a large batch (for Thanksgiving and Christmas)...Everyone loves this and I get asked for the recipe all the time.

Very nearly THE BEST mac and cheese I've ever had.  I'm in love with the mac and cheese at Tully's restaurants, this comes pretty close.  I did as the other reviewers suggested and doubled up on the cheese and half and half.  And I used penne noodles instead of elbow.  The next time I don't think I'll let it bake as long.  Maybe half the time and broil it for 5 minutes to crisp up the top.  Thanks for an AMAZING recipe that my family loved.

Absolutely wonderful!  With the help of others advice I omitted the egg. I brought 3 cups whole milk (that's what I had on hand), ½ tsp. paprika, 1 bay leaf, and 1 tblsp. Powdered mustard to a simmer. After about 10 min. I removed the bay leaf, THEN added my cheeses( I used 1 cup of each cheese). I topped it with more cheese and dotted with butter.  I baked mine for 20 min. and it came out yummy! Super ooey gooey cheesy! Loved it!

I loved this recipe!  I did many of the changes other people mentioned...doubled the non-processed cheeses, tempered only 1 egg, used 2 cups of half and half.  I also added parmesan cheese and 2 tsp dry mustard.  Then I made a cheese sauce before adding the noodles.  I sprinkled an italian breadcrumb and parmesan mix on top.  Then I baked it at 350 for 11 minutes and broiled it for 5.  Yum!!!!!

Good recipe,except I used less butter and more cream.  You do  not need to use oil in the boiling pasta water, all it does is sit on top of the water...it is completely pointless.  I do not like processed cheese (read Velvetta) so I didn't use it and the dish still turned out great.  THe eggs are not necesarry.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. This has become my new specialty. My family members ask me to make this all the time now. I left out the processed cheese food. I don't really see why it is necessary with all the other yummy cheeses!

This recipe is good and too those who omit the egg I will say that's a southern thing and a matter of taste. For myself and my family we love our mac and cheese that way.

I didn't use any velveta/processed cheese b/c my husband doesn't like it. SO just doubled up on the other cheeses. The taste came out great, but there was WAY too much butter/oil. You could tilt the pot over and it would just pour out.

EDIT:I've made this recipe closer to the written one and it was still just a 3 star mac and cheese. Good, but not great. I still added more cheese than what was called for which I think is a must.

I LOVE THIS RECIPE!!!  Now this is comfort food!!!  I took the recommendations of others and omitted the egg.  I also melted the cheeses slowly into the half and half and butter first, then poured over the pasta.  I then added a bread crumbs and parmesean cheese mixture over the top and then baked in the oven.  Oh, and I also seared ham chunks and added it into the whole mixture.  It was a huge hit at a potluck with requests for the recipe.  I will be definitely making this again.

This was a nice mac & cheese dish but, like many others have mentioned before, came out far drier than I expected. Because I didn't have Velveeta (it doesn't exist here), that could be why it lacked creaminess. However, I also attribute the dryness to the cheddar cheese. Perhaps next time I will add some ricotta or mozzarella. I think I will omit the vegetable oil as well, as there is really no need for it. All that cheddar brings enough oil on its own. Note: This makes a lot of food! I would say this dish could serve at least 10 people. This was an overall good recipe that I will use again with personal tweaks. I don't think I'll ever find a recipe that stands up to my Grandmother's 'magic' mac & cheese, so this will do for a bit! :-D

Absolutely amazing! Followed others' comments and doubled the cheese and used Pam instead of vegetable oil. Definitely not for calorie counters, but SO worth it! Made it for a dinner party, and everyone loved it - even the person who said she normally doesn't like homemade macaroni and cheese!

Let's put it this way... mac & cheese will definitely be involved in my last meal, given that I get a choice! Because it's sooo unhealthy, though, I rarely treat myself to something like this. If I'm going to eat this much fat & calories, it had better be worth it!! I can promise you: this recipe IS!!!! Do what others have recommended-- double the cheeses (not the velveeta), and use 2 cups half & half. Melt all of the cheeses, butter, and half & half into a sauce first, and then mix it in with the pasta.  I used rotini. The boyfriend loved it (as did his friends-- they took all the leftovers!!). This is definitely a recipe I will be using on the once-a-year occasion when I make this stuff :) DELICIOUS!!!

Some of the best mac n' cheese I have ever tasted. I omitted the egg, did the 2 cups half and half, and added the ground mustard and cayenne pepper to the mix. I would have liked the consistancy better before baking - it was VERY creamy! But my husband prefers the cassarole-like consistancy of baking. Next time, I'll add some bacon to the mix - because everything is better with bacon! (Hey, no one said this recipe was healthy!)

This is my favorite macaroni and cheese recipe. I love mac n cheese but i dont like manny kinds.  A small take on it-grate and boil an onion in with the noodles, it gives it a great flavor.

Made this today for guests to go along with ham. I wanted something different, and this wasn't it. I followed the recipe as written except for adding a tiny bit more cheese and cream. I cooked as directed. It looked beautiful, but I could see the look on everyone's face that I had just made a major failure in the kitchen. I always make a recipe as written for the first time, then modify it to suit my tastes thereafter. It's a costly recipe with all the cheeses, cream, and butter. Also, a very disappointing recipe. I don't believe that a recipe that needs SO MANY major modifications to be edible should have such a high overall rating.  I will not be making this again. The rating is misleading on this.

Very simple, traditional mac and cheese.  We like a sharper, cheesy taste, so used all the cheeses suggested and added some sharp italian Grana Padano, which certainly helped to sophisticate this dish some. I kept the eggs, doubled all the cheeses, and it makes quite a lot, enough to share with a crowd, so I'm taking to work on Monday to see what my co-workers think.  Will make this again, but will definitely use a sharper, more flavorful cheese combination.

I made this recipe exactly as is, with none of the recommended changes. I hated it. It came out very dry, the half n half looked almost "curdled," so it looked as though there was ricotta in there. And it was so very very bland. :(

Prepared exactly as directed.  The taste is great, but the consistency is awful.  The cheese in the dish came out with cottage cheese consistency instead of creamy.  I was wondering if I did something wrong, but perusing the reviews it looks like it really just needs to prepared differently than written.  I'll certainly make it again as it tasted good but next time I'll be following the advice in the reviews rather than the recipe as written.

I made this for some friends who brought their 3 year old son over.  I though, what kid doesn't like Macaroni?  And I was right!  It was a total hit.  the 5 of us ate 3/4 of the pan that night.  I did change a few things though.  I omitted the egg like some of the other reviews suggested and used 2 cups of half and half instead of 1 1/2 cups.   I also used 4 cups of shredded cheese total, a combination of sharp and mild cheddar and monteray jack.  I also used the whole 16 oz of processed cheese.  1/2 of the block I cubed and mixed in with the noodles and the other 1/2 i cut into slices and laid on top once the noodles were poured into the pan.  On top of the processed cheese slices, I put a layer of provolone cheese (about 6 slices) and then the final layer of remaining shredded cheese.  I can't say enough how great it came out.  Golden brown and bubbly.  My husband said this one is a keeper and I can make it any time I want :-)  Thanks for the hit recipe I'll be making this for years to come.

Very good macaroni recipe. On my first batch I used 2 eggs and it was a little funky so for the next batch I only used 1 egg and it turned out great. Very creamy and gooey. I added more cheese because I am a cheese-o-holic. I also used 2 cups half and half like other reviewers mentioned.

Sensational recipe! Made it with a little more half'n'half as advised by other reviewers. Mixed some plain bread crumbs (panko) with the cheese on top. WOW! Can I say that I am now famous for "my" mac'n'cheese?? Thank you!!!!

Best mac and cheese I've ever made.  I didn't put the extra cheese or butter on top, instead I topped with paprika and when there was 15 minutes left of baking I added thinly sliced tomatoes.  Will be making this lots more.

I made this as a side for my Thanksgiving meal.  My family loved it. I modified the recipe a bit.  I used only sharp, mild and velvetta.  I omitted the eggs and used heavy whipping cream and carnation milk.  It was so creamy and not too cheesy. We will never eat boxed macaroni and cheese again.

didn't find this too appetizing after the first round during dinner, because it was too oily and rich.  maybe i'll take out some of the butter next time, because the layer on top really grossed me out.  i don't think its worth the extra money and time to use all the diff types of cheese and baking it.  not even as cheesy as i like it too.

Super good recipe.  I just kinda got the jist of the recipe and directions, read some reviews and kinda forged my own macaroni trail.  I omitted the eggs, only used mozzarella, colby jack and chedder cheese along with the velveeta. I heated the milk on the stove then added velveeta, then the cheeses.  I added worcertershire sauce.  And just used italian bread cumbs.  Oh and only half the butter for the noodles, and was still totally rich, creamy and delicious.  Thanks for this great recipe.

AWFUL!!!  Only change was I used 2 cups half and half.  It was not creamy or rich at all.  It stuck together like a macaroni loaf because of the eggs, and it was really greasy and bland.

I've been looking for a good homemade macaroni, and this is it! So delicious and easy to make. The only change I made is that I upped the half&half to 2Cups like others suggested.

The best mac n cheese.  Very bad for you but everyone loves it.  In this recipe the velveeta makes the difference.  I cut it by 1/2 because I hate the taste of velevetta but you can't omit it.  It doesn't come out the same.

This was very good!  I melted the cheese and butter in the half and half first and then added the cooked pasta to the melted cheese, because my husband likes a creamer mac and cheese.  I left out the eggs.

THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR!!! When I lived in East Texas, I remember having mac and cheese just like this with the same "consistency." Ever since I was little I've been trying to recreate this dish. AFTER ABOUT 15 YEARS OF SEARCHING, FINALLY!!! MY SEARCH IS OVER!!!

When I made this I took the other reviewer's advice and doubled the cheese (except the cheese food) and half & half, I left the eggs in though.  I can see how, as written, this recipe would be a disaster.  I gave it three stars as it was a good starting point.  With the egg, it was very casserole like, and not very creamy.  The taste was good, but I've had better.  Next time I will further follow the advice of others and leave out the eggs, and also double the cheese food.  It was my first time making homemade mac & cheese, so it was a good learning process.

Kept the egg, doubled the cheese. This makes a HUGE amount. I halved it and it could have fed 5 at least.

I love baked Macaroni and Cheese...but hate the box.  I have a couple of recipes that I go back and forth between because they have different flavors, and this is one of them.  I just love it...I make the recipe just as it is written, but perhaps get a little more cheese in because I'm eyeballing it.  To me, this consistency is perfect.  Old fashioned baked macaroni & Cheese has a lot of body to it and without the eggs in this recipe, it would be too gooey for me and too much the consistency of the box. It's a matter of personal preference. This recipe is just delicious.

Oh man, this was really yummy.  I made a few changes from reading the reviews.  I used a cup of each cheese, used 1 egg and raised the half and half to 2 cups.  I melted the stick of butter and mixed it with the cooked macaroni, then I melted the velveeta cheese with the half and half on a very low temperature, and then poured it on the buttered macaroni, added the beaten egg, then mixed in the other cheese.  I then topped it with a healthy covering of cheddar before baking.  It was really awesome. It's not a gooey mac and cheese, but really good.  My husband said it was the best I've made so far. Will definitely add to my recipe box.

This was the best mac and cheese I have ever made. Taking the suggetions of others, I added more half and half and almost tripled the amount of cheese. I used the exact cheeses the recipe called for and one egg. Turned out really good. Thanks for sharing the recipe and have fun cooking.

YUM!!This is a great recipe. I followed the advice of other reviewers and doubled the cheese and eliminated the eggs. It is so rich but not "ugh I feel sick" rich. There's just enough cheese to be gooey and savory but not so much that it's overdone. This was great for my 5 kids and my husband and I loved it too!

Fantastic with suggestions from others. Upped 1/2 and 1/2 to 2 cups and left out eggs. Heated up the 1/2 and 1/2 with the cheese to make it smooth. Added a little extra cheese and used swiss instead of the muenster. DELICIOUS and sooo decadent. I could eat the whole thing.

I am a true to life macaroni & chesse addict! However, I did not thank this recipe was all that great. Surprising to see how many people rated it so high. I chose to give it a 3 star simply because I have had ALOT better and without all the extra calories and fat content.

This is very good, but I followed other people's suggestions and nearly doubled up the cheese, added an extra 1/3 half & half, and omitted the eggs. It's very rich & heavy so don't plan on having several servings, but it's very good and re-heats well.

Pretty good recipe. I doubled the cheese. Very good, very oily from all the cheese. Make sure pan is large enough, so that grease from cheese does not overflow.

Update 7/09 I searched for a mac & cheese having forgotten I already had this recipe saved.  I picked it again.  Made it only changing 1/2&1/2 to 2 cups, and only 4 oz of velveta. Everything else was following the recipe. It was great & only 1 hour start to table.  AGAIN,a keeper. I should add, in the last month I've tried 4 diff recipes looking for one to make for a party.  I've found it.  Old review: I did tweak...added 1/2 tsp. dried mustard, 1 bay leaf, few splashes of hot sauce.  I didn't have jack cheese so had to substitute mozz. I had on hand.  Seemed like a good ratio of sauce and macaroni to us.

Great recipe with a few changes. I only use 1 egg, I double the four main cheeses, I use 12 oz of cubed cheese and use 2 cups of milk. It is a hit over and over again. Everyone asks for the recipe.

Made this for nice cheesy side.  I changed it by adding 1/2 cup of no fat sour cream and substituted part of the half & half with milk.  Only used 1 large egg.  I also omitted the last bit of butter on the top.  Excellent creamy and cheesy, a keeper.  Thanks.

This was really good.  I did as others suggested and melted the cheese, half and half,and butter together then mixed it all together before baking.  I also added a bit of onion salt.  This was great!!

This was just ok for me, and I used velveeta, along with the other cheese thinking that it would make it creamy, I like some other reviewers thought the texture was yuk!!! and to me a little dry. My friend Monica makes a four and a seven cheese mac and cheese that is to die for, I guess I will have to learn how to perfect her recipe, sorry will not waste cheese on this one again.

Great Recipe Idea!  Used cream cheese in place of velveeta and .  A sprinkle of parmesan cheese on top is yummy too.  I also added some croutons to the top.  Just melt a little butter in a bowl, cube bread, mix and place on top of mac.  Omitted the eggs as per other reviews.  I felt like 35 mins was too long, which may be the cause of the 'dry mac' reviews.  Only cooked for 10 mins then broiled the top for 5 mins.  Sprinkled with some fresh parsley prior to serving.  Delicious and very creamy.  YUM :D

Easy recipe to make and delicious. Not exactly low fat but worth it when you want to splurge. I just use 2 cups of any kind of shredded cheese: colby jack, cheddar, etc, and all turn out wonderfully. We make it for a large group when we go skiing each winter, kids and adults and it's loved by all. Simple, quick, warm and tasty!

This recipe was just what I was looking for. I did increase the amount of Velveeta to 16oz and also put two cups of half and half. I also had some breadcrumbs on hand so I add them to the top to make it sort crunchy and give it a nice topping. This was a sure hit in my house and I will for sure make it again!

Never made homemade mac n cheese before but this was not only easy, it was delicious.  I baked it for a co-worker's birthday because he hates cake but loves mac n cheese.  It was gone in a heartbeat.  Everyon kept coming back for seconds but it was gone!  I did not have Muenster cheese so I used extra of the cheddar and jack cheeses.  I also doubled the amount of shredded cheese I used. Very yummy!

Perfect for the pickiest of preschoolers. Used wacky mac for fun. For once my four year old tried something that wasn't neon orange. So simple that my hubby couldn't screw it up!

Wonderfully rich and creamy, worth the money and extra calories (only on special occasions) :-)

Vert creamy and cheesey.  My family ate every last morsel.  I did, however, cut back on the butter and it still was DELICIOUS.

I altered this quite a bit, but the basic ingredients gave me the creamiest mac and cheese I've ever made.  I boiled the noodles.  Melted the butter in a separate saucepan, added some flour, then the half and half, added the cheeses (I only used cheddar and velveeta) until melted, then mixed that into the noodles.  I added salt, pepper, and ground mustard and baked for 20 minutes or so, adding some extra cheddar on top about halfway through cooking.  It was creamy even the next day.  I made this a second time with not as much half and half (I ran out and used skim milk) and it still tasted great.  So-- I didn't use the egg or the veg. oil at all.

This is a very good macaroni and cheese recipe, but here's the thing: There are LOTS of very good macaroni and cheese recipes out there that don't require me to have five different types of cheese in my refrigerator. So I probably won't make this one again, not because it wasn't delicious, but because it's too much trouble.

I think this is a good base recipe.  When I made this following the recipe as written, it was bit too sticky for my tastes.  I made it a second time by omitting the egg, and pouring all of the melted cheese over top of the pasta.  I let the cheese cool for about 10 minutes, then serve it.  I skip the baking process altogether.  I also added mustard powder as someone else suggested--it really makes a big difference in the taste.  

I'd recommend this recipe if you are looking for something to build on or experiement with.

I love trying new recipes, which is why I gave this a try even though macaroni and cheese isn't a regular menu item in our family.  I was very disappointed.  The taste was okay, though a bit bland, but the texture was anything but creamy.  I just thought with the 1/2&1/2 and all the cheese and the Velveeta (processed cheese) that it would be creamy.  So for the cost of all the cheeses and the 1/2&1/2, I would stick with Kraft Velveeta shells & cheese.

I made this dish looking for an alternative to the Store bought box stuff.  I was so happy with it too!!  Talk about delicious.  The only down side is all the shredding but if you have a food processor it goes by like a breeze.  This recipe is a definate keeper.  Thanks Kimberly for submitting it :)

This was a really really good recipe. The only change I made was I used low fat milk instead of 1/2 and 1/2 and I cut down on the butter a  little and used a combination of swiss, cheddar, fresh parmesan, mozzarella and Velveeta. Loved the recipe.

Departed just a bit from the posted recipe. Half sharp cheddar, half Monterrey jack, kept the processed cheese "food," though (it does make for a nice mac). Added a pinch of cayenne, used white pepper, and added a  healthy sprinkle of Parmesan over the top. Oh ... and San Giorgio pasta, FYI.  Got rave reviews at a late-summer family reunion.

I downloaded this recipe two years ago, and began making it for Clubhouse Tailgate at Virginia Tech football games.  I have no need for any other mac and cheese recipe, as it went over so well that I now make two batches and have no leftovers!

This is a very rich and creamy macaroni that is comfort food at its finest.  I followed other reviewers’ suggestions and only used one egg.  Also, I had purchased the cheese ends at the local deli, which is a variety of different cheeses, and it worked out very well.

I made this for the first time at a family gathering, and now I have to make it every time.  I did only use one egg, and i used sliced muenster instead of shredded.  I added shredded mozzarella and mexican cheese.  I mixed all of the shredded cheeses into the noodles and then covered the top only with the sliced muenster.  Definitely a keeper.

I pretty much followed this receipe except for the types of cheeses. I usually use cheese ends for more flavor. The eggs really makes this mac and cheese very thick.

I was not impressed. It was not awful, but it tasted like nothing more than glorified Velveta Shells and Cheese. Will not make again when I can save time and money and buy it in a box for the same taste.

This is very dense, like a casserole, but is delicious!  I double the cheeses and use 1 egg, up half and half to 2 cups, use 8oz Muenster, 1 t. paprika, 1 1/2 t. onion powder.

6 stars!  I was nervous b/c everyone says homemade mac and cheese is hard to make.  Although there were a lot of ingredients, it wasn't hard.  And I did NOT change a single ingredient or step listed in original post.

Seeing this recipe made me want to try it, after all mac and cheese is the ultimate comfort food!  I went to two different grocery stores and neither one had muenster cheese (go figure!).  Since I really wanted the 4 cheese experience I substituted smoked gouda.  The result was amazing!  Creamy, rich, satisfying goodness!  Other than the cheese substitution I prepared the recipe exactly as written and wouldn't really change anything.  This does make quite a lot and the left overs are pretty dense so I may try to whittle down the recipe next time.

I was at work two days ago and there was this magazine right by my register that had homemade mac n cheese on the cover. It mad me so hungry just looking at it I had to mad some when I got home. So being that I only get my recipes from allrecipes.com I decided to get on and find a good mac and cheese recipe. I came across this one and decided to give it a try. It was amazing!!!! Lots of flavor and really creamy. I also added little smokeys links in with it. This would be a great dish to take to a bbq or potluck :)

This was amazing.  I admit, I did not follow the recipe exactly, and I know how irritating this can be for some people.  I did not add the eggs because I didn't want it to be too much like a casserole.  I replaced the Muenster with Mozzarella because that's what I had.  I didn't add the extra tablespoon of butter to the top before baking because I ran out.  Still, turned out wonderfully and everyone loved it.  Super easy, too.  I will definitely make this again!

This was really good and like more everyone else on here I made modifictions. I didn't have all the cheeses so I used 5 oz of velvetta, a whole kraft block of Colby/Monterey jacket and about 2 cups of sharp cheddar and left everything else the same, it was great!!!

I thought this recipe tasted great, but to be fair I must say I made some modifications to cut fat.  First I did not include the vegetable, I also used Land O Lakes Lite Butter, and instead of half and half, I used fat free sour cream.  This probably didn't turn out as creamy as it is supposed to, but it tasted great.  My modifications made it more of a baked casserole vs. a creamy dish.

I'm giving this only three stars because I think it's a good base recipe to build on, but not good enough on its own. The only modifications that I made was omitting the eggs and melting the cheeses first. I also added bread crumbs on the top to give some texture. This mac SCREAMS for flavor. I would suggest adding garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, and maybe some cayenne. If I make this again, I will probably add ham too.

This was good, but I just don't like the fake cheese taste that the processed cheese food gives it.  I'm going to stick with a recipe that only uses real cheese.

I used this recipe as a basic guide for mac n' cheese as it was highly reviewed.  I have issues with macaroni dishes that call for a roux that usually leaves the cheese mixture granular.  This one does not and it really comes out creamy.   However, I now realize that this is at the cost of an extreme amount of additional fat.  The additional 9 tbsp of butter doesn't help in that department. I also realize that much of its smoothness and cheese flavour comes from "cubed processed cheese product" - aka velveeta.  I think ( not that mac n' cheese will ever be a healthy side dish) in the future I will just melt some velveeta on pasta and save myself and my kids 3/4 of the fat in this recipe.

Just made this and am waiting for it to cool!  I took a taste off of the top and can tell you that it's Delicious!!! (Yes, that's a capital D!).  My only issues is it looks alittle runny and I was hoping for more creamy, but it tastes good, so who cares:) UPDATE***  I stand corrected!!  It was not runny at all!  I made no modifications EXCEPT that I used more cheese (about 1 cup of the cheddars and muester).  I forgot to buy monteray jack, but will add it next time.

I made a pan of this for myself and hubby and then another pan for another couple to drop by their home.  It was SO good! I would just be sure to use only the block cheese and shred yourself as the pre-shredded would make the cheese stringy.  So perfect and keeping this one around!

Very good!  I eliminated step 2 and just added the butter to the hot pasta and stirred for about 30 seconds until it melted (saves having to clean another pan!)  I also added breadcrumbs to the top for some crunch!  Served with some veggies and crusty bread.  Tasty meal!

Because I'm not a stellar cook yet, I made the recipe as is, but I doubled the cheese since that seemed to be consensus in the reviews, and it turned out only ok for me.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was entirely my fault.  Please, please, please don't let that ooey, gooey mixture go into the oven UNTIL all of the Velveeta is melted.  I didn't think to do that and got only lumps of goodness surrounded by barren wastelands of grainy melted cheese.

The fats/oils in the cheeses started separating out almost right away leaving me with a slimy texture.  The flavors were way too mild/subtle for me.  I ended up adding tons of salt to the dish and I still couldn't get any flavors to perk up.  Overall it's a bland, texturally unappealing dish.

I make this recipe ALL the time, but like others have said, I more than double the amount of cheese used.  Sometimes I use the eggs, sometimes I don't - it all depends on whether or not I remember!  I can't always find the cheeses required, so I've tried many combinations of cheese, including adding Mozzarella!  Next time I make it, I'm going to leave out the egg and add Ricotta cheese instead.

I was soooo excited to make this ultimate comfort food! But I was so disapointed in it once I tasted it. I kept going over the recipe trying to think what I did wrong b/c surely I messed up somewhere, I just knew when I was making it that it would be awesome. But I was really let down. It's just bland. The cheese taste was mild and just not special.  It wasn't bad, it's just that a bottle of Kraft and Macaroni and cheese would have satisfied me more. My friend and kids all said the same thing. It did look beautiful and smooth but the taste was only ok. We really had to salt it up and add more sharp cheddar to it to finish the leftovers the next day.

This was tasty.  It was a lot of work, though... if you can, get pre-shredded cheese.

I have been making this mac and cheese for some time now.  It is the best recipe that I have found.  I do vary the type of cheese I use according to what I have on hand.  Mexican blend works great.

This was just OK.  I was expecting something smooth and creamy but it was a little dry and not the right blend of cheese that I like..it seemed a little too sharp and I followed directlons exactly.

This is very good, but you almost have to double up on all the cheeses and use 2 cups of half and half to really get the creamy consistency.  I enjoyed this recipe very much.  Will make again. :)

so i needed a recipe to bring to a BBQ, figured this would appeal to most. so i doubled the recipe... if you do that, make sure you have the equipment to deal with it. i didn't think 28oz of macaroni would require so much pot space. yeeesh. and then trying to mix the cheese and macaroni all together required my kitchenaid mixer metal bowl, and i mixed a smaller batch on the side. anyway, i omitted the eggs bc i dont really like eggs and they didnt seem necessary. i used extra cheddar instead of processed cheese food. and the cheeses i used were cheddar, muenster, monterey, and colby. I think next time i'll get the jalapeno monterey bc it could use the kick. i also suggest you throw in some paprika with the salt & pepper. I also added panko bread crumbs to the cheese that was sprinkled on top. and before i sprinkled i sliced two small tomatoes over the top... REALLY recc'd that last part!

One of THE BEST macaroni and cheese dishes I have ever had!  I didn't use the eggs and I added a bit more cheddar than called for.  I also melted all but 1/2 cup of the cheeses (for sprinkling on the top) together with the butter and half and half before mixing with the macaroni.  Divine!  Definitely only a once in a while dish due to nutritional content, but it is certainly worth it for an occasional indulgence.  Heaps better than anything you'll make out of a blue box!

I made this last night and it turned out excellent. I like the fact that you don't have to do the milk/flour thing for this recipe. I doubled the amounts of the cheeses and did not use the processed cheese food because of my personal taste preference.

I tasted this going into the oven and it's delicious. I used 2 cups of a white/sharp/mild cheddar blend and 2 cups of a 5 cheese Mexican cheese blend queso quesadilla, asadero, queso gallego, manchego, and anejo enchilado) because that's what was on hand. I also substituted a 12 oz. can of evaporated milk for half-and-half because that's all I had. One thing I added was buttered bread crumbs to the top, because that's my favorite part. I was searching for a baked mac 'n cheese recipe that didn't include onions like the traditional recipes on the boxes of pasta. My daughter just doesn't go for onions. I'm glad I found this nice middle-of-the-road recipe that pleases all.

Wonderful!  I agree w/ (reviewer) Debsdolls... do not omit the eggs, temper them with melted cheeses then add the cheesy mixture to buttered macaroni.  So yummy... but I wonder what it's like w/bacon??

My husband was skeptical about a mac and cheese dish. I set it out and had no left overs. I didn't add the eggs and followed the suggestion to double the cheese. This will remain on my easy to please menu for when the kids have friends over on cold winter days.

Great and easy recipe. I was unsure about the process cheese food. So I used cheese spread. It was great. After mixing all the ingredients and pouring the pan, I poured a little milk over the top. It was creamy, and cheesee.

Made this for a crowd for the superbowl and wow was I disappointed in the bland flavor of this mac and cheese.  I tried doubling the cheese, omitting the egg and adding more half and half as suggested.  But the cheese blend was blah.  I tried to correct by adding parm, ground mustard, diced ham, onion... nothing added enough flavor to make up for the original recipe.

This was delicious, but because I had to make a lot of changes to the recipe, I am rating it 4 stars.  I followed others' suggestions, and omitted the eggs, because I did not want that fluffy, "eggy" flavor.  I doubled all of the cheeses except the processed cheese, and also added romano cheese and a little bit of mozzarella.  To avoid lumps, I made a sauce out of the cheeses and half and half before I mixed it with the macaroni.  I wanted to make a meal instead of a side dish, so I added a pound of spicy Italian sausage, which I seasoned with garlic powder and crushed red pepper.  I baked it for about 25 minutes with a breadcrumb and romano cheese mixture on top.

I followed the recipe perfectly.  It does not have enough cheese.  For those who doubled it the cheese, you were correct!  It was not at all creamy.  I was disappointed.

Beware this recipe serves 12 as a side dish. The original recipe indicates that it serves six, this is a GENEROUS entree portion.  That said, the taste is just average. I thought it dry and relatively bland.  I'll make it again but will add spices to perk up the taste.  As it's made, I think Kraft M&C is creamier and has more flavor.   Think of it this way, if you're going to be takin in almost 900 calories in an entree portion of this dish...it should taste a lot better.

I'm disappointed that it didn't turn out the way I expected.  I followed the directions without looking at the suggestions which is usually not a good idea.  I would definitely make some changes.  I believe it was bland so I would use all sharp cheese.  One person suggested that you make a cheese sauce by first heating up the 1/2 and 1/2 I think that is a better way of making.  It came out thick and not creamy at all.  I might also try it without the eggs.

This was amazing!  I took the advise of several different people and made some adjustments.  First, instead of buying 4 different types of cheese, I bought the Classic Melts shredded cheese pack and used 2 2/3 cup.  Much cheaper that way.  Second, I omitted the eggs.  Third, I melted the butter on the stove, then added the 1/2 and 1/2 (2 cups instead of 1 1/2) shredded cheese, and Velveeta stirring frequently until melted.  Finally, I only baked for about 15 minutes.  Everyone loved it and had seconds!  It's not bad reheated either (I'm actually eating some leftovers now!)

I did an adaptation of this recipe. I eliminated the processed cheese as a personal preference. To reduce the fat I eliminated the butter and used 1% milk instead of the half-and-half. I increased the salt to 1/2t and added a T of dry mustard. This is an excellent stand-alone recipe but I think there is more than enough fat in the cheese and, to me, dry mustard is a must with mac and cheese.

After reading the reviews I made this recipe with the following alterations.  I omitted the eggs (big mistake, I think), and increased the shredded chesses each to 2/3 a cup.  I also made a cheese sauce before baking.  The recipe was absolutely delicious, but so creamy and sticky that we literally had a cheese coating on the roof of our mouths after eating it.  I definitely think the eggs are needed to give it a bit of a fluffier texture, but the flavor and recipe is spectacular.  I think this recipe beats Chuck's by FAR.

Very good.  As others suggested, I doubled the cheese and put a bread crumb topping on it.   Reheat was very dry.  No sure why.

Great base recipe, but the next time I make it I will be changing a few things. This time around I used one egg and 1/2cup more half and half. Next time I will leave out the eggs, use a little more half and half, and a lot more of the sharp cheddar and the processed cheese. But, all in all, very good.

I made this last night and it was the best mac n cheese I ever made. I did make a few revisions that made it really creamy. I added more half and half, more cheese and only used one egg. I also topped it with cheese, then bread crumbs and melted butter. You will not be disappointed! EVERYONE LOVED IT. Dont forget the salt and pepper.

I am very picky about mac & cheese, and wanted to make something that rivaled my husband's aunt's version (the best I have ever tasted). They are secretive about their recipe, so I've been searching for something that can top it. This recipe is it. My husband ate half the pan.  I didn't change the recipe other than to add more cheese (I think I used two cups each). I would have liked it to be a little more creamy or gooey-cheesy, but I've been forbidden by my husband to change it because "it's perfect as it is. I don't think I'll ever eat another kind of mac & cheese again. So good.

This is similar to my recipe for mac and cheese! I used extra sharp cheddar, mild cheddar, medium cheddar, and mozzarella. I doubled the amount of cheese, and I melted all cheese on top of the stove on low heat, mixing with the half and half, and I also used a small can of evaporated milk. After the cheese was melted and combined, I removed the pot from heat and whisked in the two eggs. I'll definitely be making this again. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Sorry this was crazy over the top rich for us. Spouse thought it was too rich and gooey. I know, I know, it isnt a diet dish. That said, it just tasted like gooey cheese.

this was amazing. Easy to make and delicious.  I took others' recommendation to heat the cheeses and half and half before mixing with the macaroni.  Yummy!  Thank you for sharing this.

This was very good!  I cooked the processed cheese and half and half together and then I added the rest of the cheese to blend it all together.  I mixed the eggs in with the macaroni and then poured the cheese and half and half mixture over the whole thing and stirred.  You really do need the eggs to keep it creamy.  My husband said it was his favorite mac and cheese.

We love this recipe at my house. I have used Rotini and whole wheat pasta as well which make it have a little different taste. I also use whatever four cheeses I have on hand (usually sharp and mild cheddar, colby, and monterey jack cheeses). My family loves this recipe we have it at least once a month.

WOW!!!  Definitely take out the eggs, and use 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2, and this is DELICIOUS!!  I've never made mac & cheese homemade before, and this reminds of Luby's, which is my favorite!

This is the recipe I've been looking for, though I made several changes that I think really pushed it over the top.  First, I diced 6 oz. of bacon and fried it, adding 6 oz. chopped onions halfway through.  Once that was done, I dumped it (with bacon grease) into the cheese mixture.  I combined all "wet" ingredients in a large saucepan (including 1 egg, not 2) and very slowly warmed it.  I put the cooked macaroni in the baking dish, poured the cheese mixture over it, and mixed.  Finally, I topped it with Panko breadcrumbs and then drizzled butter over that.

This is the best macaroni and cheese recipe I've found. I used the eggs, but made sure to temper them first because I was afraid the other ingredients might cause them to scramble. I used large elbows, but next time I may use a sturdier pasta only because the large elbows kind of disintegrated once reheated. This is kind of an expensive mac and cheese recipe, but you won't be disappointed. One of the ways to cut the cost is to buy exactly the amount of cheese you need, by ordering 3 slices of each cheese at the deli, and then making confetti out of the slices so it's similar to shreds.

Pretty good though I will make a few changes next time around. I did add fontina and omitted the eggs. Think next time I will use more sharp cheddar and added velveeta. Thanks for the delish recipe! :)

25 minutes to cook, only change was 2 cups each Monterey Jack and X sharp cheddar cheese and 8 oz velvetta was the only cheese I used. Very good, needs salt and pepper. While draining pasta, I used the pot I cooked it in to melt butter and then returned pasta to pot and added the rest...no need for all the extra dishes. I usually go by reviews, but this time tried it as is (almost) and it was very good...keep the eggs

I made a roux and added the cheese to the roux. I added a little more of the cheese to it, added some paprika for a kick. I did not add the eggs, as suggested by alot of the reviews, came out very creamy. Tasted great, everyone  like it.

This was awesome!!!  Very creamy and yummy.  My husband loved the combo of the different cheeses!  I did omit the eggs (much like other people did)I also put all the cheese in with the pasta and then added shredded mozzarella to the top.  This is the recipe that I will make from now on for Mac and Cheese!!

I have been trying to convince myself that mac and cheese w/o a cheese sauce is the way to go, but I can't seem to do it. This recipe is ok, but it tasted kinda bland to me. I didn't think that the sauce was creamy at all. It just made the macaroni taste oily and cheese-LIKE. I think that I'm going to stick to the kind with a beschamel sauce.

MMMMMM!  This was great.  You can pretty much use whatever cheese you have on hand.  Also, like other users I didn't feel like adding eggs would do anything.  I'm glad I omitted them because the recipe turned out great without them.  Instead of using regular cheddar + Extra sharp cheddar, I just used medium.  I was all out of Jack cheese so I just added more muenster.  Next time I will throw in whatever cheese I have, plus processed cheese food to keep it creamier.  I added parmesan and bread crumbs on top and it added an excellent touch.  This stays nice and creamy as long as it's warm, because once it cools down it cakes up.  I'm hoping that adding extra milk/cream next time will help it stay creamier longer.  I already have requests to make this for the next party.  Definitely a keeper!

This recipe was pretty good. I made a couple changes; i used one cup of milk, and sharp cheddar cheese as opposed to the array of cheeses that the writer sugessted. All in all the recipe was easy and tasted pretty good!

Ridiculously easy and ridiculously good!  If you were wondering, the tablespoon of oil is for when you are cooking the pasta while it is boiling so that it doesn't stick.  I didn't add any eggs, used a little more Velveeta (maybe 2/3 of the block) and mixed a bit of light cream to the half and half to make it bit more watery (when it baked it thickened nicely and stayed creamy).  I would say for those who found it too dry to add more liquid and bake it for a shorter time.  Also added some onion powder to round out the flavors and give it a little more dimension.

OMG!!!!!!!  This is the best.  I had to recalculate the recipe to feed 30, and I made 3 large catering pans of this stuff...it's great!  I couldn't find shredded Meunster and was too lazy to grate my own, so I just replaced it with more cheddar/Jack cheese.  Using the eggs is essential to the creaminess of this dish.  Awesome recipe!

I made this for my sons Boy Scout  Ceremony and it was a huge hit! They were begging for me to bring more. I added a little more cream, a blend of 7 cheeses, but otherwise stuck with the recipe and it was fabulous!

This was pretty good. I followed the reviews on here and omitted the eggs and doubled the cheese. This tastes great out of the oven but does not store well at all. It was expensive to buy all the cheeses, and since I cook for only myself I don't think I'll make it again b/c it isn't all that good the next day. And, just a side note - did anybody else realize that the recipe calls for vegetable oil but never says what to do with it?

This was wonderful. I took the advise of another user and heated up 2 cups of half & half and added the Velveeta and cooked on low until melted then poured over buttered cooked macaroni (1 stick of melted margarine). I used about 3/4 cup of each cheese and tossed it. with macaroni. I left out the eggs. I then  crumbled Ritz crackers over the top and baked. This was maybe the best macaroni & cheese I've had. Paired it up with BBQ Pulled Pork and my friends LOVED it!!

This is the best mac and cheese I've had. I tweaked it a little by adding almost double the amount of cheese and I added some seasoned brad crumbs to the top for an added crunch!

This was fantastic!  I will never be able to pull off Kraft Macaroni and Cheese again!  I added extra cheese as suggested by other reviewers and added keilbasa before baking.  Everyone loved it!  Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! I did what a few other people did. I heated the butter, then the cream (2 c. not 1.5) then added the Velveeta and then the cheese. I didn't use Meunster (couldn't find) and I used about 2 c of the shredded cheese. Then added it to the pasta (I didn't use elbow, I used corkscrew ones which are much better) I did use the 2 eggs, and garlic powder. And added about a cup more of cheese on top. 
SO CREAMY! We're a cheese loving family so it was a definite hit!
This is a keeper!

This is pretty good.  And it really was creamy.  I used 1 cup of mild cheddar, and 1 cup sharp cheddar.  I also used baby pene pasta. I also added some paprika, cuz I always gotta add something!lol, IT was good, and my two year old who doesnt even like macaroni and cheese ate this one! so i guess its a keeper!

This was very yummy but a bit on the greasy side. I also increased the amount of cheese and did not add the eggs. Other than being high in fat, It is a very yummy comfort food.

I was a little worried because I've never had Muenster cheese, but after tasting it, I LOVED it!  The cheese mixture in this is sooooo good.  I actually baked some seasoned chicken breast and shredded it, then added it before baking and ... oh my God it was wonderful.  This is my favorite dish by far, with the chicken in it.  I'm making it for my girlfriend's mom for Mother's Day.

SOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!

I am not a macaroni fan, so I am giving you my husbands rating.  He thought it was good, but could use a little spicing up.  I did use 2 cups half & half, and doubled all cheeses but the Velvetta.  I added 1/4 tsp garlic powder, and then a little more after I tasted it.  I used white pepper instead of black, as my oldest child wouldn't have eaten it with "black pieces" in it.  She liked it, but my husband and youngest really enjoyed it the most.  Thanks for a good recipe.

I made this as the recipe says to because otherwise that wouldn't be reviewing it. It was decent but lacked in flavor a bit. It was not very cheesy and could have been creamier. By using other suggestions it could make for a good recipe. Also would be good with a bread crumb topping.

This recipe is wonderful! Adults & kids loved it! I followed the recipe and I found there were pockets of super creamy, cheesey macaroni. And some "dried" spots. In order to even it out, I think I need to cube the velvetta smaller or add more half-n-half. That was my only issue. Definately try it!

Good recipe.  I added much more cheese and much more half & half (about 3 cups).  I also heated half & half and melted cheeses in it. I only cooked for about 10 minutes... just long enough to melt cheese on top.  This kept it kind of creamy.  Also, I just added 1 egg.  Served this at a church dinner and it was one of the few dishes there that was all eaten.  I would like to try again using a white sauce to see if it would come out creamier.

Very, very good.  1st time, hubby made recipe just as written.  2nd time, I read the reviews and used only one egg plus heated the milk and add Velveta and butter to it to melt.  This makes it turn out much creamier!  This recipe is definately a keeper.

I made many modifications to this recipe, but only because I didn't have all of the different kinds of cheese that was listed and, I wanted to add chicken to make this a main-dish course.  My modifications included roughly a total of six cups of shredded white cheddar/vegetable and sharp yellow cheddar cheese.  I melted the cheese in two cups of whole milk (instead of half and half) after making a roux with about 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 cup of flour, and then added roughly a cup of seasoned broth that came from poaching the chicken for this recipe.  The macaroni was boiled in the rest of the chicken broth (which, in addition to bone-in chicken breasts, included three bay leaves, lots of chopped sweet onion and celery hearts...leaves and all...some dried parsley flakes, seasoning salt and cracked black pepper), boiling the macaroni in the broth made this dish extra savory.  Once I had the cheese/milk/broth mixture heated through I mixed in the macaroni and chicken and baked as written.  (Based on other reviews, I also omitted the eggs.)  This turned out fantastic!!  This recipe made the creamiest macaroni and cheese that we have ever tasted.  I am certain this recipe would be equally as good without my modifications and will try it as written next time.  My husband loved this, and our son has come home two days in a row to eat leftovers.  This made a big pan and I'm happy not to have to cook for a couple of days.  Thanks for this fantastic recipe; we all really enjoyed it!!!

This was the VERY BEST mac and cheese that I have eaten. I did omit the eggs as I didn't want it too dry and also, with all those cheeses, I surely didn't need the extra fat and cholesterol. I used 2 cups of half and half for good measure. Sure glad I did. Leftovers the next day were even better than the first day's dinner. I reheated it slowly in the microwave and it was to die for. There are only 2 of us, so, we had more than enough for 1 day of leftovers. The second day, I had it for breakfast! How nutritious is that!!!! All that protein and calcium! We will not get into the fat or caloric content. It's great to indulge once in a while. Be sure and serve it with a nice salad if you want to ease your conscience! This is a true keeper!

It was very good everyone enjoyed it!  I halved the recipe because there's only three of us, and maybe next time I'll add a bit more velveta.  I did sprinkle some italian style bread crumbs on top with the butter before baking and I liked that added touch!  Try this you won't be sorry!!!

This was pretty good but not as creamy as I would have liked - and I added more cheese than it called for.  Maybe more Velveeta next time and less Cheddar.

This was not what I was expecting by the great reviews. The flavor was ok, nothing great, and I thought it had kind of a strange texture. The only thing  I used that was different than the recipe was Ronzoni Smart Taste elbows. I will not try this recipe again.

I substitute 2 cups of mixed shredded cheese, add 1TBS mustard powder and also omit the eggs. This is a favorite in my house.

I got mixed reviews on this one...but no wows! like the other dishes. It was just okay. I spent a lot of money and I think just using elbow noodles, velveeta chunk cheese, and milk probably would have been just as good.

Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this was not very good.  I thought it'd be great since it had a high-rating and good reviews.  It wasn't very creamy and the texture was questionable.  I won't use this recipe again.

Out of this world - nothing but rave reviews!!! I upped the 1/2 & 1/2 to 2 cups, and use a full 16 oz of Velveta.  Yum!

This was closer to 3.5 stars. I'm still looking for a creamier recipe. The flavor of this was rich, amazing, but the texture was ok.  I used gruyere and sharp cheddar, and used heavy cream rather than  half and half.  Perhaps the egg makes it a little too firm. Topped with a corn flake and butter topping.  Added one clove of pressed garlic, maybe 1/4 cup of green onions, lots of paprika for color.  Again, flavor was outstanding, but texture needs help.  Used less butter altogether and it was still a little greasy.  Maybe add sour cream next time and increase the velveeta?

I loved this dish and so did my entire family including my very extra-picky 8-yr-old.  Up to this point the kids would only eat the day-glo orange stuff in the blue box.  I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I didn't have any Muenster cheese and didn't feel like buying it so I just increased the amount of the other cheeses a little.  Some reviewers said they skipped the egg but I couldn't figure out why so I put the egg in, too.  The dish was creamy, had a nice smooth cheesy flavor and was very filling.

Great recipe, but to make it even creamier, add 12 ounces of processed cheese food (velveeta) rather than 8 oz.

Versatile recipe.  I did not have muenster cheese, so I used some shredded mozzarella, but because I did not have much, I addes 1/3 of a block cream cheese.  Doubled cheddar and velveeta.  Rich and cheesy and extremely filling!  Very good.

So yummy, even my husband who never likes macaroni & cheese loved this.  I used penne noodles instead of macaroni, and doubled the cheese per previous reviews - turned out so cheesey and delicious, I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely the best Macaroni and cheese I have ever tasted.
Rich,dense and filling-not the
gooey,plastic taste of Kraft
nor the dry soufle like taste
of a casserole.This recipe got
it EXACTLY right.Like others I
doubled the cheese,used one egg,used 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2,I
also used large rigatoni noodles-it made a huge difference in the presentation,
and then at the half way mark
in the oven,stirred and topped
with MORE cheese.I'm still
full hours later(and "full" of
myself for making such a great dish!)

Was good, but not the best I've ever had.  It was very easy to make and as others recommended I used extra cheese and half and half.  It wasn't quite as creamy as I would have liked though.

I'm not sure how to rate this one?  The end result (as written) was very dry, not creamy at all, and just not edible in my own opinion.  As is, 1 star at best.  I looked at this giant dish of Mac & Cheese and I was determined to salvage it.  I whipped up a cheese sauce (made with milk, onion & garlic), and mix it in, then returned to re-bake with even more cheese on top!  Now I had this Mac & Cheese that was more than edible, it was sinfully delicious! The combination of the cheeses blended very well and it was so rich and yummy.  But, there was so much cheese in this recipe how could it not be good!  After just a couple of bites, one is truly full.  I decided to give it 4 stars.  With the added cheese sauce, this was the best, and I mean BEST Mac & Cheese I have ever eaten. This dish should only be made once in a blue moon though because of the health factor.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I also ommited the eggs and doubled the cheese as suggested.  And, I layered the macaroni mixture with additional layers of shredded cheese and topped with a bread crumb/melted butter mixture before baking.  Very tasty!

This was pretty good, but rich, and I even made it with lighter ingredients. I used low-fat margarine, low-fat cheese, skim milk and skipped the velveeta and just upped the cheddar. We all liked it, but after about 5 minutes of finishing, it really hits your stomach like a rock. I can't imagine eating it with the full-fat ingredients, but this is a good meal every once in awhile, and still better than some of the boxed stuff.

WOW, this turned out to be the favorite at a party I gave.  I made it with the children in mind.  I should have made more....the adults loved it!  At first, you may wonder why the five different cheeses are needed.  After you eat it you'll see how all the cheeses combine to make a delicious taste.

Just what I was wanting - wonderfully creamy and yummy.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and doubled the cheeses, omitted the egg and cut way back on the butter.  I also used fat free half and half... it was wonderful!

Wow.  Really tasty.  I basically took all the cheese I had in my house and just threw it in there.  I also halfed the recipe - with only 2 people in my house, 1/2 a box of macaroni left us leftovers for days!  Sprinkle some bread crumbs on top for a nice crunchy coating!  FOR CREAMY TEXTURE:  Double the shredded cheese and ADD A CAN OF CHEDDAR CHEESE SOUP!!!  Trust me, it gives the creamier texture and a very cheesy taste!!!

Finally! A homemade mac-n-cheese my kids loved!  My 7 and 4 year olds had three helpings for dinner, then actually cheered when the next day I said we were having the leftovers for lunch.  The one year old loved it too.  I did use the cheeses I had on hand, however, but I don't think it would make a difference.  I used: sharp cheddar, American, colby/jack, and mozzerella and then sprinkled parmesan over top.  I also used non-fat half and half.  It was bland for me,(that's why only 4 stars) but some pepper and tobasco at the table will fix that.  It's worth it to see my kids eating mac-n-cheese that's not bright orange!

This was great!  I did as other reviewers suggested and doubled the shredded cheese and did not use egg.  The leftovers were great too and did not dry out at all.  I will be making this over and over again!

Very yummy! I did cut down the egg to the equivalent of 1 using egg beaters and instead of half and half I used evaporated milk. No velveeta because we don't buy it so we doubled up on the other cheeses - its a huge hit on out house and makes fabulous left overs! Thanks for this recipe!

For the amount of time involved, and the amount of ingredients, I was very disappointed in this recipe. It tasted really "Eggy". That was a total turn off to start with. It was also very dry. Not impressed at all. Will not make again. I'll stick with my shells & cheese velveeta mac & cheese. Much better.

Excellent texture and taste.  Heavy cheese taste and it's a meal, a heavy meal all on it's own.  This one is going into my recipe box.

I love this recipe.  I have made it numerous times and it always turns out wonderful.  However, I do make some changes.  Instead of velveeta (sorry but I cannot stand the stuff) I use a can of cheddar cheese soup.  I also add 1 tsp of dry mustard and use about 1 1/2 times the shredded cheese.  I add a little whole milk for a creamier texture and use bowtie pasta instead of elbow macaroni.

Made it with and without the eggs, and without definitely makes it creamier.  Added paprika for more flavor.  One of the best homemade macaroni and cheeses I've ever made!

Always use more cheese....at least that is my husband's philosophy.  I doubled the cheese and it turned out great.  I did have to add milk to make a bit more creamy.  Thanks for a base that you can pretty much jazz to suit your own tastes.

I have made this recipe a number of times, and I have found that not adding the eggs makes it much creamier, and they really aren't needed anyway.  I like to either crush potato chips or pretzels and sprinkle over the top with parmesan cheese.

Excellent.  I was a little skeptical about using Velveeta in this recipe (I'm a bit of a cheese snob) but the other real cheeses are the dominating taste.  Very delicious recipe.  Very creamy, very rich.

Rather disappointed in this dish. My 12 year old likes it; but then again, if it is a noodle, he loves it. This just isn't as rich and creamy as I had hoped. Hubby asked if this was from a box if that tells you anything. I really was super careful and followed directions and had high hopes but I will continue my quest for the perfect rich and creamy macaroni and cheese and may use this recipe as a starting point.

I'm from the Deep South where comfort food is the norm.  I followed this recipe all the way through, and my dish came out kind of dry and not really creamy.  The cheeses tasted better when we re-heated the left overs. Overall, I give this recipe ***** for ease, *** for taste, and **** for leftovers!

This recipe didn't result in a cheesy, gooey mac and cheese I was hoping for.  I would definitely add more cheese and also top with a breadcrumb topping for an extra crunch.  (A breadcrumb topping can be made with breadcrumbs, olive oil and whatever seasonings you prefer.  I used garlic powder and onion powder, salt and pepper.  Mix so it's a bit on the wet side - the olive oil will help give a golden crust.)

Super good and easy recipe.  Family loved it!  I did "TRY" to cut the fat and I used 1% milk instead of half and half, half the butter, and I only used one egg.  Turned out terrific.  Reheated with a few tablespoons of milk in the microwave and it was very creamy and good. I will be making this one again!  Thanks Kimberly.

My daughter has been begging me to make mac and cheese forever! I haven't bought a box of mac n cheese in ages so I thought this would be great to try! Very successful lunch! My daughter is one happy customer and the adults were equally pleased. I like mine a little creamier so next time, I might just used 2c half & half, leaving all other ingrediants the same. Also, I'll be sure to remember the advice from a previous reviewer about adding some kielbasa. Sounds like an even tastier addition. Thanks Kimberly.

I've tried many macaroni and cheese recipes and this is one of the best so far.  However, I did make a few alterations...I only used 4oz. of processed cheese and added a little extra sharp cheddar to the other cheeses for a little kick.  I also added a bit more salt than the recipe called for.  It turned out yummy!

This was very tasty!  I followed the recipe to a "T" adding only some bread crumbs on top.  The extra T of butter on top is probably not needed.  This was a very good home made mac n' cheese.  If you're looking for a creamy box style look elsewhere.  This ia a nice firm dish with a great rich cheese flavor! The addition of velveeta gives it just enought creaminess.  I loved it and so did my family!  Next time I think I will also cut back on the amount of butter you toss into the pasta. PS.  If you're on a diet....watch out!!!

Delicious! I will give it five stars because it is good on its own. However, I make a few edits to suit our personal tastes: 1 cup each of the cheddar, sharp cheddar, monterey, and muenster; I also use 2 1/2 cups of half and half and add 1 teaspoon of mustard powder to the sauce. I also prefer a bit of a crust so I sprinkle a little of shredded cheddar on top and panko bread crumbs before putting in the oven at 375 for 20 mins. Then I broil for a few minutes to get a golden brown crust. To die for!!!

Exceptional.  Like others, melting down the velveeta makes it much smoother. My only change is substituting gruyere for the munster.

I'm going to go ahead and admit that I used this recipe pretty much as a base. I altered it quite a bit, so maybe this rating won't be fair, but that being said...I LOVED it! We all did here. I'd never had that Muenster cheese before (never even heard of it) and I could only find it in slices, but I found that that made the mac suuuuuuuper cheesy, and the taste was SUPERB. I omitted the eggs (just didn't seem right) and the Velveeta (don't like the taste of it) and used two cups of half-and-half. Next time, I will use even more half-and-half though because it still just wasn't quite creamy enough. So basically, I just poured the noodles in some regular boiling water for 8 minutes, mixed in a stick of melted butter in that, mixed up a cup of each of the cheeses (half the package of the sliced Muenster) with 2 cups of half-and-half, poured that over the mac in a greased dish, topped that with half of cup of the rest of the cheeses and the rest of the Muenster slices and baked it at 350 for about 20 minutes. Needed more half-and-half but next time it will be perfect!

It overflowed in my oven, but that's not the recipe's fault. Other than that it was super creamy and cheesy. You can never go wrong with those!

This was really good, both my boyfriend and I loved it! It smelled so good baking that we almost didn't let it finish before we dug in... the only downside is that there are WAAYYY too many calories to have frequently, but its definitely a good cold-weather or comfort-food!

I have an impatient family when it comes to mac and cheese, so minimal changes were made.  (didn't need the vegetable oil, 5T of butter, or the beaten eggs; substituted 6 Babybel Gouda for the processed cheese) 4 T butter melted; add 4 T flour (wheat, brown rice, white. . .all work) to make a rue.  Added the 1/2 and 1/2 until thickened and then added the cheeses until melted.  I did this while the noodles were cooking.  Mixed everything together and served.  YUMMY!!  I apologize for tweaking your recipe, but we couldn't wait to eat it!!  Thank you!

I made this on Thanksgiving and it was wonderful.   I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of using Cellentani pasta instead of Elbow.   Cellentani is a the same diamenter of Elbow, but longer, in a spiral shape.

4.5 stars... really?  This version was so-so at best.  No deviation from the original recipe, so maybe that's the hitch.  Bland, mediocre, plain vanilla, best summarize this dish.  I was hoping for 'blow my mind' mac 'n cheese, but this recipe fell desperately short.

This is my first time making mac and cheese from scratch and it turned out delicious!  I omitted the oil and melted the cheeses and butter in the half and half before adding it to the mini fussilli pasta.  I did add the eggs to the cheese mixture but I think it created this curdled texture so I will not include them next time.  This recipe was very easy to make and tasted super cheesy.

Excellent!  Perfectly creamy and delicious.  Like the other reviewers, I simmered 1 pint of half and half, melted several cubes of velvetta, then melted approximately 2-3 cups of shredded sharp cheddar cheese and monterey cheese.  I boiled up the paste ( I used rottini ), poured 6 tablespoon of melted butter over the pasta, then poured the cheese mixture.  It'll look really wet but when you bake it for about 15-20 minutes, the mac and cheese gets more congealed and gooey.  Yum!

Excellent Recipe (with a few modifications, as per other reviews).  Didn't add eggs and used 2 cups cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella (that's what I had on hand).  Baked for 15 minutes at 350.  Sprinkled some cheese on top for the last 5 minutes.  Really good!!

My changes were to double the cheese, just use one egg, and use 2 cups of half and half.  I also sprinkled some seasoned breadcrumbs on top before baking.  It wasn't creamy and liquidy like boxed mac n cheese but it was amazngly tasty.

This was delicious.  I followed the suggestions of other reviewers and omitted the eggs.  Also, I used different types of shredded cheeses, but it doesn't really affect how good it tastes.  I added oregano, Italian seasoning, and garlic as well.  The reason I gave this four stars instead of five is that it's really, really unhealthy.  It tastes divine, but I'd enjoy it a bit more if I didn't have to put so much butter, cream, and cheese into it. It's still satisfying, though!

I will not make again, I am disappointed that I couldn't just follow the recipe and have it turn out great. There are a lot of suggestions on how to improve it but for the first time on this site I didn't read them because it had such a high rating. Very misleading. It was dry and not cheesy

Very Filling. I followed this recipe exactly as stated. It looked like Cheesey noodles with Scrambled eggs mixed in. Tasted way better than the boxed variety .

Great recipe, I also omitted the eggs and baked it for about 20 minutes after putting some butter on top.  I might add some butter crumbs next time too.

Let's start with saying this is the first time I ever cooked something that wasn't out of a box...EVER. I am very picky about my mac n cheese...very picky. I decided to give this a try...I left out the eggs because of others reviews...put 3/4 cup of each type of cheese (more cheese is always better!). Sprinkled some Parmesan cheese across the top. It turned out AMAZING. That goes to show how easy it is to make and just how good this recipe is because I had no idea what I was doing :).

I used kimzee's method of making this recipe and it came out perfect! The bread crumbs on top were the perfect contrast to the cheesy mac! Delicious!

Loved this!! I changed it up a bit; used mild and sharp cheddar cheese, a mixture of Italian cheeses and the processed cheese. I also added some chopped-up, roasted, New Mexican, green chili. It was awesome!! Everyone loved it!!! :-)

I make this recipe nearly every other week.  However, I have been trying to make a lighter version because my husband is on a diet. In the lighter version I use 2 cups of milk and add a little cornstarch to thicken it.  I add the salt, pepper, and some mustard powder to this mixture. I place the noodles in and sprinkle about half the cheese over the top and bake it.  I still love it and it has the benefit of being a lighter version.

I LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe!! Anytime I make macaroni and cheese I use this recipe. After a request from my husband I cut down on the butter just for a "healhier" dinner. I made this for a family gathering and it was gone in mintues and my husband's cousin told me it was the best macaroni and cheese he's ever had.

20+ years and I finially found the perfect mac and cheese recipe! Next time I am going to try to melt all the cheeses with the half and half to make a sauce to get a creamier texture. I also omitted the eggs, doubled the cheese amounts and substituted 1 cup of the cheddar cheese for Cooper Sharp American (my families favorite cheese!)- very rich but very yummy- great for a special treat.

LOVE this recipe. I isnt good for you but MAN is it good!     I used shredded Mexican 4 cheese blend and shredded cheddar instead of all the different kinds to simplify it but I'm sure doing the recipe properly would be daaaarn good.     I sauteed bacon (about 5 slices) then cut up and set aside. Then I sauteed 1/2 onion (chopped fine) adding a pinch of sugar to it while it cooks.    I add the bacon to the onion once it is browning and leave it on a low heat stirring every so often.    When I add the cheese mixture to the macaroni, I add the bacon/onion mixture along with the eggs and stir it all in.     I top the mac and cheese with bread crumbs and a little more cheddar before baking it (I also turn it once in the oven half way through the 30 min so it cooks evenly.   Like I said- no the healthiest meal but crazy good! :)

i cooked this for a group of hungry college students and they absolutely loved it!  I substituted parmesan cheese for the Muenster cheese, and didn't add the sharp cheddar at all.  It was great!

This recipe gets rave reviews from my friends and family everytime I make it for them.  A true winner and new staple in my household recipe collection.  I use Lite Butter, 2 percent milk and it still turns out GREAT! This recipe can be halfed or doubled and still great results.  Two thumbs up comfort food and protein too -- YUUUUMMMMMY!

I made this for 4th of July and it did not go begging!  My family couldn't believe it was my first time making it.  I have to say what I did different too, only a few things..I followed everyone's advice and also added 2 cups half & half and used 1 cup each of sharp cheddar, colby & monterey jack & almost half of the velveeta.  I sprinkled the top with paprika.  That was it and it was a hit!  Thanks for a delish mac & cheese recipe that I will be making again :)

This recipe requires an awful lot of work for mac and cheese.  Also, it's more of a casserole (I like mine creamy and saucy).   To improve this recipe, I'd recommend skipping the egg and replace the 1/2 and 1/2 with some milk.  Heat everything in the pot on the stove until the cheese is nice and melty...and voila! That's my kind of mac and cheese!

This recipe was very good!  I have tried several other macaroni and cheese recipes from this website and this was definitely the best.  It's not health food, but definitely a good treat!  I did add about 1/2 C more milk than the recipe called for and some cubed grilled chicken.  I also omitted the eggs.  Overall, very good!!

This recipe is dry, tasteless--other than the heavy taste of all the cheese it asks for and the lumpiness of the macaroni.

I also omitted the eggs, good choice to omit the eggs. I made this for my friend who loves mac & cheese and he loved it, the only thing he wanted me to do to it make it a bit more crispy on top.  I will be making this over Memorial Day!

This recipe is a keeper! I left out the egg, and added 1/2 cup more of the half and half.  Also used different cheese velveta 8oz, Kraft parmesan asiago romano 1cup, and sharp chedder combo 3cups.  I like this recipe because there is no flour, sour cream, or cottage cheese.  Love it with the half and half makes it very creamy.  You can use this base with the half and half and butter ratio with any cheese you like.

Delicious! I didn't use eggs and used two cups of half-n-half. I melted everything together on the stovetop then stirred the cheese sauce into the  cooked noodles, topped with bread crumbs and butter, and baked in the oven for 20 min. Amazing!

Great starter recipie. I subbed the cheese though for Jack, Sharp & regular chedder (about 1-1/2 cups each) and omitted the processed cheese (not a fan of it). I would also use a bit more salt and for my bread crumbs, I shreded a few sliced of sara lee white bread tossed with 1tbs melter butter turned out great.

This is really good!  I only had a 13 ounce package of noodles, so instead of increasing cheese and cream as other suggested, I left the amounts the same, but because of having less noodles, it still was nice and cheesy.  I did not use "Cheese Food" (yuck) but just subbed more shredded cheese.  I used 100% whole wheat noodles, and next time I'll use skim milk to try to make a dent in the fat content.  Otherwise, I followed the directions as far as mixing and baking goes, and it was very, very good.  Obviously, you can use any combination of cheeses for different flavors.  Thanks for sharing this!  By the way, the kiddos went "eww" when they saw it because it didn't look like the disgusting boxed stuff.  One taste and the kids admitted to LOVING it.  My husband had THREE helpings and nibbled during clean up.  That's a victory!

Yummy!  Kids loved it!  We doubled the recipe.  Kept the eggs.  We have always used eggs in our homemade m&c so I guess we are used to them.  Also heated the half and half with the velvetta on the stovetop.  Cooked for 25 minutes but may do 20 next time.  Hot out of the oven it is creamy but as it sits on the counter it will dry up.  I understand why some think it tastes bland, if you know you like seasoning in your food I would say go for it.  Also, I hate Velvetta, but in this dish I could not taste it at all.  Hope this helps!

This was a decent recipe.  The eggs did add a certain good rich, binding quality.  The processed cheese "food" however, added a certain artificial quality.  I remade the recipe adding 4 ounces of parmesan and 4 ounces of gruyere and it was FAR better.

I did not like this recipe at all. I followed it exactly as i do with all recipes i make the first time. The consistancy was terrible which when i was making it and reading the recipe, i thought it was odd that you didnt make a true cheese sauce you just mix in the cheese and dont melt it before hand. MAybe if you make a cheese sauce and then mix it all together that may be better. I dont think i will make this again. My search continues for that perfect mac and cheese.

Excellent. Out of practicality, I don't always use the different types of cheeses and usually just do the processed cheese and one style of shred. Any way you do it is wonderful. I have made this several times and will continue to make it.

Oh my - this is rich and creamy!  I made mostly as written except I used mozarella cheese instead of Muenster and shells instead of elbow mac.  I doubled the shredded cheeses as well, and I only used 1 egg.  Baked for 25 minutes and it was perfect!  Very cheesy!

Mac and cheese is one of my favorite foods and this is sooooo good. I only added panko bread crumbs and broiled it for about 3 minutes after I baked it.

Excellent!  As others suggested, I omitted the eggs, doubled up on all cheeses except I omitted the Muenster cheese (personal preference).  I will definitely make this recipe again, however next time I woke bake it quite so long.  The top was a little too overcooked for me.

We have boxes of mac and cheese in our cupboard that will go to waste now that we've started making this! The two major changes we made were to cover it with foil until the last five minutes so it doesn't dry out and we melt the velveeta with the butter before mixing it in. One minor change is that we make a layer of muenster slices in the middle instead of shredding it, but that's out of laziness. :)

I followed the recipe exactly aside from the egg.  I used half the amount. I also mixed 3/4 cup bread crumbs and two tablespoons of butter to put on top. So delicious! Took it to a potluck at work and it was the first thing to disappear.

This was worth the extra effort.  Very good, nice creamy consistency.  I altered the types of cheese a little, but I think any combination would be good.

This is really very good, my only recommendation is to stir it every 5-10 mins while it's cooking. Otherwise it gets a curdled cheese consistency. We add chopped bacon to it and it's great.

Not what I was expecting from homemade mac n cheese. I will find another recipe that does not inlcude processed cheese. Even with all the other cheese it still was overwhelming velveta.

WOW Thanks for this delish recipe!! Of course I also made some changes. For one I did not have Muenster so I used Mozz. Secondly I did do the 1 cup vs. 1/2 cup of ALL the cheeses. Not a good idea for the sharp cheddar. I also took the advice of another reviewer and melted the velveeta with half and half on the stove. I did not let it boil just let it melt. I ommited the eggs and it did need more salt and pepper. I only baked it for 20 mins. vs. the 35. This was the best homemade recipe I have cooked. Great job with it.

I followed the advice of others and doubled the cheese...I thought that made it WAAAY too cheesy, but the man liked it!  So doubling it is good I guess, as long as it is not just for me.  I also used 3 cloves of roasted garlic mixed in with the butter when I melted it for a little extra flavor.  Thanks!

This was really good!!  I did use only 1 egg, just sharp Cheddar and Monteray Jack cheeses and not as much of the Velveeta.   I also followed suggestions and warmed the half and half.  I added the velveeta and about 2/3 of the shredded cheese and melted.  Then mixed everything together.  It is not dry at all but very good reheated, too.  It's a keeper for me!!
update 5/10 - melt 1/2 c marg, crush one sleeve of Club Buttery Garlic crackers, combine and top mac & cheese with that.  Yummmmmmy!!

This was really good. I made it for Christmas dinner and prepared it the day before and then baked it Christmas day. I actually think I liked it better before it got baked. It was sooo creamy and cheesy, we couldn't stop taking little bites. Maybe letting it sit overnight made the creaminess disappear, but it still tasted wonderful. I didn't have muenster cheese so I used a colby-jack mix.  I also doubled all the shredded cheese amounts as hubby is a cheese lover!  I've been looking for a homemade mac n cheese recipe for awhile and I think this one is a keeper!

I had misgivings making it as is, since it calls for no seasonings besides salt/pepper, but I thought I'd take it on faith that it was as good as everyone said.  It's not bad, but it basically does just taste like macaroni with a whole lot of rich cheese.  Maybe I've just become a mac and cheese snob, but I expect my mac and cheese to have a little more kick/spice to it-at least mustard powder or something else to give it more depth of flavor.

I've made this 4 or 5 times now, more or less to the letter, and while I enjoy it and have received a few compliments, this isn't what I was looking for. It isn't creamy at all.  I've never put eggs in macaroni and cheese before so I think I'll take the suggestion from other reviewers and skip the eggs, increase the cheese, and mix together the cheese sauce separately.  I might also skip the baking entirely since there won't be any raw egg at that point. Even baking this for 25 minutes seems to make it way too dry on top and send all the melted cheese to the bottom.

I added more cheese to the top layer, and I had lots of compliments at the Christmas dinner with coworkers. It was really good, and the leftovers are good too.

My kids loved this casserole (the reason it gets 4 stars).  I didn't like it (the reason why it didn't get 3 stars).    The flavor was fine, but I just thought the consistancy would be more like macaroni and cheese.    I only added one egg...maybe I should make again with no egg?  I will try one more time with no egg.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this recepie for our family Thanksgiving dinner. For the most part I followed the recipe very closely with the only exception of adding some bread crumbs to the top which added to the taste. My family liked it so much that they were disappointed when this receipe was not at our Christmast dinner.

FABULOUS!  I followed the recommendations of others and doubled the shredded cheeses (but not the processed cheese) and used 2 cups of half-and-half for 6 servings. Like others said, I made a cheese sauce with the half-and-half and processed cheese (and 1 tempered egg - but only for a double batch), and then added that to the buttered noodles and added the shredded cheeses.  It was soooo rich and creamy and delicious, I've been eating it for two days straight.

This is such a great and tasty M&C recipe - only I made it even BETTER with some bacon and apples!!   I fried the bacon first, and cut it up into small pieces. Then sauteed the diced apples (1 whole braeburn apple) in the same pan to give the apples a nice bacon-fried flavor. I followed the suggestion of others and increased the amount of cheese (almost double). I did add the eggs to see how it would turn out, but I won't be doing that next time - it made it less creamy.  I ended up melting the butter, the cheese, and the milk (and tempered the eggs into this mix) all together to save some time, and then poured it on top of the macaroni. I mixed in most of the bacon and apples into the M&C.  After spreading it into the glass dish, I topped it all off with more cheese and the remaining bacon and apples. I baked for 15 minutes and broiled for 8 minutes until golden on top. It was PERFECTION.  Leftovers were just as good, and I'm really happy with this recipe!

This was AMAZING!! It was my first time making homemade macaroni and cheese and it was really quite simple. I really love the texture the eggs give but if you like a creamier consistency then leave them out. I sauteed some broccoli florets with Italian sausage and garlic in a little olive oil and then stirred them in once they were cool (so as to not cook the eggs.) I stirred halfway through the cooking time and then let cool for a good five minutes or you'll have molten lava mouth - and that's never a good thing. Everyone raved and went back for seconds. Good times :)

DELICIOUS!! I made the recipe exactly as written (minus the eggs) and it was awesome. My guests loved it and it was still yummy reheated the next day. I forgot the eggs, but I don't think it affected it at all. Excellent recipe, very cheesy and creamy. One tip: use a LARGE saucepan or dutch oven to boil mac and mix ingredients and use a 3qt or larger casserole dish to bake...I made quite a mess using a medium saucepan and 2.75qt dish :)

I was a little bummed this year because it was the first year I was not making Thanksgiving dinner myself.  I was asked to bring macaroni and cheese and used this recipe.  The only thing I changed was doubling the cheese and omitting the muenster.  IT WAS INCREDIBLE!  I felt kind of bad because it was the dish everyone was talking about.  No one even commented on the turkey, stuffing, ect!  It was the only dish that was completely gone!  I made 3 batches for 15 people.  If you are searching mac and cheese recipes like I was, use this one!

This is an awesome one & I added buffalo chicken which rocked. I do think you should add more cheese to the top cause one can never have too much cheese & the top was a little dry.

This has now become my favorite! The family loved this last night.  I didn't have muenster, so used the mozzerella I had in the fridge.  Used 2 cups of 1/2 & 1/2, melted the velveeta cubes in the 1/2 and 1/2.  Also, put in a lb of cubed ham...yumm.  I used to make Chuck's mac n cheese, but this recipe edges that one out.  Thanks for sharing!

I added the eggs and wish that I hadn't. I ended up with dry mac with globby cheese, not creamy in the slightest. I followed one reviewers suggestion of melting the cheese, butter, and cream together and I think it helped, but then egg (even tempered) still made it globby during baking. I'd say leave out the egg and bake it for much less time--15 min or so. The taste was great though as far as mix of cheese goes.

This recipe was exceptional! Like many reviews... I omitted the eggs and it gave the recipe a creamier consistency.  I used velveeta (over 8 ounces) and cubed it as well.  I mixed all the cheeses and the cubed velveeta and didnt melt them before adding the cheese to the noodles.  I just mixed all the ingredients together in a bowl and put into a glass dish then I added a few more cubes of velveeta on top and covered with slices of muenster cheese! It was the creamiest, gooiest macaroni and stress free recipe there could ever be!  Ive made this recipe for thanksgiving, family functions, and even work/school events! Never had left overs!

READ REVIEWS!  I didn't bother to read the reviews first because everyone gave it a high rating.  I wish I had.  Putting in the eggs was a mistake.  I did not like the fluffy texture at all.  Next time I will omit the eggs, or at the most put in one.

Someone else mentioned that they used Patti Labelle's mac and cheese recipe- I looked for that and it is almost verbatim- this exact recipe. The only difference was 1.5 c of half and half in this recipe compared to 2 c of half and half in PB's.

Good mac and cheese recipe. I halved the recipe and used fat free half and half. I used a bit more cheese than called for. I melted the butter and cheese in a sauce pan and omitted the egg. I stirred in the noodles and then poured everything into a pyrex dish. I mixed some breadcrumbs with olive oil and threw it over the top. I thought the mac and cheese was very good, but there was WAY too much butter. Next time, I will cut out half the butter, since the cheeses produce a lot of fat as well. My boyfriend loved this dish despite all the grease.

This recipe is amazing! The cheeses were rather expensive (since they are sold in larger quantities than what the recipe asked for) so I won't be able to make this all the time. But as an occasional treat, definitely!

I make a quicker version of this. I use only cheddar and the velvetta. I do four cheeses for a dressed-up version. For less dishes, i drain the macaroni in the same cook pot, then add the milk, cheese, egg mixture into the warm pot with the macaroni----just let it melt slightly, and add into the greased pan and bake!! Very easy and family loves it.

very good...I used 2 cups of half&half, and 3 8oz. bags of shredded cheese (cheddar,mont.jack, and italian blend) along with the velveeta.  Omitted the eggs, and it turned out dry. I will add milk next time.

I made this and it was so awesome! I did however use shredded Parmesan cheese instead of Muenster. It is the absolute best recipe I have found and I'm tossing my old one out.

A few changes made it divine!! Instead of regular cheddar, I added bleu cheese crumbles. I followed the other reviews and doubled the cheeses, omitted the eggs, and extra cream!

I made this for my husband to take w/him for his "guys" only weekend.  When I called, his friend instantly commented on how great it was and he said everyone else loved it as well.  I did change a few things.  I added dry mustard and extra half and half since it wouldn't be eaten until the next day.  I also added a little more processed cheese and made a true cheese sauce before mixing it w/the noodles.  I can't wait to make this at home for our family.

I like the recipe; reminds me of moms only with better cheese. Play around with it by adding different meets in to alter the flavor abit and you can have multiple dishes.

I simmered the velvetta, egg, & half-half on low for about 15mins (enough so that the mixture was creamy in texture). The burner can't be high and you have to constantly stir. I poured the sauce into the pasta then seasonsed and stirred, then added the remainder of the cheese. I omitted the muenster & used more sharp. My family enjoyed.

This was amazing!  I took it to a pot luck at work, so I made it the night before and warmed it up in a crock pot the next day.  I took others advised and cut the eggs, and amped up the cheese!  I cooked a cheese sauce over the stove by mixing milk and velveeta and then adding the shredded cheese.  I also through in some ricotta cheese that I had in the fridge, and that really made it nice and creamy!  I crumbled bacon to put on top, and the crowd went crazy!

This recipe it AMAZING!!! I made this for Thanksgiving last year and when the kids went back for seconds all they got was this macaroni. Now, anytime we're having a big dinner I'm always asked to make this dish. I haven't tried it without the eggs yet but I did change the half and half to heavy whipping cream the second time i made it and used more sharp cheddar instead of muenster and doubled the amout of all of the shredded cheeses. This is THE BEST MAC EVER!!!!!!!!!!

Same here, I would omit the eggs and use 1/2&1/2 and extra cheese. If you dont mix it up well enough, you can get a bit of egg-white crust on the edge..not my favorite. The result is a perfectly comforting dish!

i like my mac & cheese baked and eggy and my husband likes it creamy - so i tried to find one we both liked and this was it. so awesome! i used only one egg, and only cheddar and velveeta cheeses. also - i used rigatoni instead of elbow macaroni because i like my mac & cheese big. this was a super easy, super YUMMY recipe.

I followed the recipe, but did NOT like this recipe.  I usually love recipes with such a high rating, but this just did not do for anyone in my house.  I am guessing I did something wrong, but I don't know what.  The consistency was terrible!

Maybe I should have just followed the orginal recipe. I tried to follow some of the other cooks advice on doubling some of the cheeses and omitting eggs, etc. Unfortunately I tried this for Easter dinner and it was curdled!

Wow, this is the first time I've made Mac & cheese NOT fr a box and this turned out better than I expected. Definitely cheesy, creamy and the flavor is just right.  I omitted the egg; double ALL the cheese (including the cheese food).  I mixed the melted butter into the freshly cooked pasta, then poured in the half & half/cheese food mixture, then ALL of the shredded cheese.  The store didn't have shredded muenster cheese, so I ended up having to use the only thing they have:  sliced muenster cheese, which I tore into little pieces.  I topped it w/a plain bread crumb & parmasan cheese mixture before putting it in for 15 mins.  Didn't want this coming out too dry.  Broiled it for at least 5 mins (we were hungry & couldn't wait much longer).  Very filling, and very much an indulgent comfort food.  Definitely a keeper!

AMAZING!!!! I did change it up a bit, but not much... I did not use the egg, I used 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and used Panko bread crumbs on top. WOW, I will use this during the holidays!

This recipe was AMAZING!  Everyone loved it.  I did change it up a little bit.  I cooked the noodles in chicken broth.  Then, instead of the four cheeses, I used 1 cup of Medium Sharp Cheddar Cheese, 1 cup of Colby Jack Cheese and 1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan Cheese.  In my opinion, the Parmesan cheese made the dish.   Also, separately, I heated the half and half added the eggs and then mixed in and melted the shredded Cheddar, the Colby Jack, and the Velveeta.  After everything was mixed and melted I stirred in the 1/4 cup of Parmesan.  After everything was mixed through I then added the sauce to the noodles.  Simply Amazing!

The best mac and cheese ever. I also use what ever cheese I have in the refrigerator, usually mazzarella, chedder, jack and velveeta. The more cheese the better. The whole family loves the gooey cheese.

i was in a hurry to make this, so i glanced at the recipe a couple times, then threw it together...i used one package of valveeda cheese, a package of mild chedder cheese and tex-mex shredded cheese, i completely forgot about the eggs and instead of butter, i just threw in a bit of margarine, i also added some paprika....i baked it with cracker crumbs on top....it was really good!

Fantastic recipe- has become a staple in our home.  I only use 4 Tablespoons of butter, omit the eggs and increase the amount of cheese.  I leave the 1/2 and 1/2 the same, but I heat it with the velveeta cubes to create a nice thick sauce.  It comes out great every time!

I had my 5 year old son help me with this recipe because his favorite thing to eat of course is mac n cheese.. He loved it... I loved it too!! It's very rich and creamy. I followed some advice of others and omitted egg and used 2 cups half and half! Amazing.. Thanks!

Excellent!  We did not use the eggs, and we used whatever cheeses we had.  The muenster cheese is key.  This is very rich and creamy so it is definitely more of a side dish vs a whole meal.  We will certainly make it again.

My entire family loves this recipe. Oven baked Mac & Cheese is so good. The Jack cheese is what makes it stand out from the rest. I like it more creamy, so I leave the eggs out. It looks like a lot of cheese at first but it will bake down.

BEST macaroni I've ever had. I made this for a luncheon at my husband's work and everyone raved about it. There were no leftovers and a quite a few people asking me how I made it. I will not make this a lot because it is not the healthiest thing to eat, but I will certainly fix it every time there is a special occasion.

This was good when it came out of the oven.  The leftovers were not good though.  When it got cold in the fridge and then we tried to reheat it it was too hard and didn't work out.  It was delicious, though, when just made!

this was TOO cheezy. i could only eat a quarter of a bowl before feeling too sick to continue! i think it would be good with twice the pasta for the amount of sauce it makes!

I made this for Christmas this year and everyone loved it.  I made two batches.  One was as specified in the recipe and on the other I used another viewers suggestion and ham, sliced tomatoes on top and smoked gouda.  They were both wonderful!

This recipe was ok. I did not follow the recipe in terms of just throwing all of the ingredients together and putting it in the oven.  I did use all of the ingredients and created a cheese sauce, then mixed it with the buttered noodles. This ensured all of the noodles were cheesy. The consistency was very good, but I definitely think it lacked in flavor. Maybe next time I will use a different cheese combo, and add some more seasonings and maybe onion. My 4 year old, who only eats Kraft mac and cheese, did LOVE it.

This is not a recipe for those who are watching their waistline, but if you want to splurge for a couple days you'll be glad you did. I pretty much followed the recipe with the exception of adding more cheese because I like my macaroni cheesy. This is indeed good macaroni & cheese.

I basically ignored the directions for this recipe and followed reviewer Kimzee's advice but omitted her breadcrumbs and broiling time. This is more of a rich and creamy mac & cheese and is different than a flour based mac & cheese with a crusted top. I did not get "dry mac" and I think it's because I took the dish out of the oven every 5 minutes during the 15 minute bake time and stirred it well. I also dropped the oven temp to 325 since my oven tends to be on the hotter side. 

Overall, this dish came out wonderfully creamy and cheesy. It was fairly quick and easy to make too. Thank you to Kimzee and all the reviewers for the tips!

Was pretty disappointed with this recipe.  It was not very cheesy at all.  It seemed very dry to me.  Followed the directions the full way through.  It made a ton of food, and the leftovers did not reheat nice at all.  But I guess thats expected with mac and cheese.  The only reason I am giving it three stars is because some people in my family seemed to like it a little bit.  Will not be trying this one again.

Loved it!  This was an experiment for Christmas buffet dinner and it was a huge hit!  I didn't have all four cheeses so I substituted mozarella for the muenster.  It was creamy and not greasy - will definitely make again.

I did what several stated and doubled the cheese.  TO MUCH I can see doubling the cheddar but next time not the white cheese and I will not add the 3 oz extra velvetta as it was oily.  Everyone said it was good but it was thick and rich and could not be eatten in large amounts.  I think the recipe as is would have been better.   If I followed the recipe =)  More is not always better....

I also omitted the egg this I will repeat.  It is a great dish to make the day before.

This had great flavor but even with using 2 cups of half and half, as other reviewers suggested, we still found it a little dry. Next time I will probably try 2.5 cups and maybe even add a little more velveeta. I mixed the last half a cup of cheese with panko and it was delicious, though my husband asked for it to be covered in french fried onions next time for more flavor. I'll definitely be making this again..just with a few adjustments.

Not too difficult but I didn't much care for the taste.  Mine was more dry then creamy! I give it 3 stars because my 2 little ones ate it for a few days in a row - with no complaint! I am still seeking a good home made mac & cheese recipe! Thanks anyway!!

Pretty decent macaroni. Reminds me of Noodles & Company's mac & cheese. Made this for dinner last weekend for my bf and I. I liked it, but my bf did not (but he doesn't care for cheddar cheese and prefers bacon in his mac - he likes bacon in EVERYTHING!!!). I was craving something "homey" on a cold, snowy Chicago evening and this hit the spot! I modified the recipe slightly. I warmed (on low heat) 2 c. half-half and all of the Velveeta until the cheese melted. I also mleted 2 T butter and a 1/2 c. of seasoned bread crumbs, tossed together and sprinkled over the mac & cheese. Finally, I upped all of the cheeses to 2/3 c. and subbed corkscrew pasta for macaroni (can you believe the store was all out of macaroni???). Other than thant I followed the directions to a T (I did however, cover my dish for the first 15 minutes of baking and broiled on high for a couple of minutes at the very end to brown the bread crumb topping). I want try this without eggs and bake for half the amount of time directed next time as other reviewers have done to see how the consistency changes (my mac was slightly dry, but edible). Served with a glass of milk, a side of steamed broccoli and good 'ol Jell-O chocolate pudding for dessert. Thanks for sharing!

I used a slightly different combination of cheeses (including cream cheese) and added mustard powder and some cayenne. It came out great, but not very creamy. I will add more cheese & milk next time.

Omitted the eggs and used 2 cups half-n-half as recommended in other reviews.  I also added crushed red pepper, used a spicy Velveeta, added 1/4 cup bleu cheese and subsituted cheddar and monterey jack for the expensive muenster.  I brought this to the company party and it was eaten up.  I will surely make this again!

Wow, this is the most flavorful homemade mac and cheese I've ever made! Amazing!  I did make some changes but nothing too drastic.  I made enough to fit in an 8X8 glass baking dish (about half a 16 oz pkg).  I used a 2 cup pkg of cheddar/montjack cheese and 8 oz of velveeta and 1 pt of half&half.  Also, I threw in about half a small onion, chopped, with the butter.  And NO EGGS - Yuck!  Eggs don't belong in my mac and cheese.

I really enjoyed the taste of this mac and cheese, but the consistency for me was a bit off. The sauce was smooth and creamy when I melted in the cheese, but once I baked it the mac and cheese seemed to have curdled a bit. I added double the cheese and only one egg, otherwise I stuck to the recipe.

This is the best mac n cheese I have ever made.  I melted the cheese with half n half then poured over noodles.  Unfortunately, I left the kitchen with my mother in law watching the oven, and she burned it (how you dont smell it burning, when your sitting in the kitchen is beyond me).  Fortunately I tasted before it went into oven, and was so creamy, but was still good burnt.  This is going into my recipe book

This was not to my liking at all... I followed the recipe with no changes. I was expecting a creamy flavorful Mac & Cheese but it wasn't creamy and there wasn't much flavor. My family didn't eat it and I ended up tossing it. Sorry, but it just didn't work for us! Thanks anyway.

This recipe was very easy to make, made enough servings for roughly 12 ppl, and had great flavor. I happened to only use sharp cheddar, monteray jack, and velveeta. I didn't melt the cheeses first, however they quickly melted when added to the hot noodles. I only added one egg, used 2 cups half & half, added a small container of sour cream, and added a buttered bread crumb top (with bacon bits!). I also included three sliced raw jalapenos (including seeds!) to the mixture before baking for an extra kick. This recipe made a ton! I had plenty to completely fill a 2 quart casserole dish plus extra. It wasn't super creamy/gooey (more like a casserole), but definitely had a good cheesiness factor. My roommate couldn't stop eating it! I definitely recommend adding the buttered bread crumb top, bacon bits, and jalepenos! Next time I may skip the egg and add more cream.

WOW - this was very decadent. Made a roux with butter and flour, added 2 cups half/half, doubled the cheese (mild cheddar, jack, 6-cheese Italian mix) except for Velveeta (which I substituted with American cheese) and omitted the eggs. Took another's suggestion of adding fried bacon and onion (doesn't bacon make everything taste better?). Then I topped off with additional cheese and buttered bread crumbs. I think I gained 10 lbs. just eating one helping and my hubby LOVED it!

This is a really good base for mac and cheese, I did change the recipe slightly, as per the other reviewers- i.e. I used 2/3 cups of the shredded cheeses, I only used one egg, and I used two cups of half and half. Additionally, I added about 1.5 cups of frozen peas to get some color and veggies in there, but I think you could add just about anything to the mix. Also, I found that it reheated better than I expected, just like any other cheese-based dish.

The family loved it and ate it all up!!!  A few small changes I made.  I cut up and fried (not crispy) bacon and chopped up onion (fry till soft).  Then added it to the cooked macaroni.  It just added that little extra.  I also used Roasted Garlic and Red Pepper cheese instead of the Muenster & Monterey Jack.  Definately will make it again.

Really, really good!  I added leftover ham to it and used a mixture of colby and monterey jack cheeses in addition to velveeta.  I made it for an office full of guys and they've all been begging me to make more and I definitely will someday soon!

This recipe was AWESOME.  Following the recommendations of other reviewers, we doubled the amount of cheese (except the velveeta).  We did leave in the egg though.  I like a more casserole-like mac & cheese, and I think the egg served that purpose.  Plus, Paula Dean uses egg in her mac & cheese so I trust her judgment :)  It was totally decadent & something that I wouldn't suggest eating on a frequent basis, but absolutely delicious.

I am considering making this version soon, but I have made a mac and cheese similar to this one and for those of you out there who are unsure of what "processed cheese food" is, I am glad to inform you that it is nothing more than one of those velveeta cheese blocks that they have next to the chunk/block cheese . There mystery solved, Happy mac'ing!

My family on both sides LOVES this recipe.  The muenster adds that extra flavor we all love (I always add a little extra). This is the ultimate comfort food.

when buying ingredients wasn't sure what "processed cheese food" was in the ingredients.

after completion, the end product was not that good, probably because i just use more cheese instead of that "processed cheese food"

AMAZING!  When I told my family I was bringing mac and cheese for the 4th of July, they were hestitant- said it's something that is hard to "get right."  Boy were they surprised!!  My fussy niece ate a giant bowl of it, and raved the whole time.  I did do stuff differently- doubled the cheese (instead of Muenster, I doubled the Marble Monterey I had), used 2C of half and half, and only used one egg.  Did use any oil, as I didn't know where to put it!  I also added a few sprinkles of paprika in the cheese (which I melted before adding to the pasta) for color.  I think you could skip the oven part if you want super cream macaroni (like Stouffers), but baking it made it sooooo good!  Add some bread crumbs with melted butter to the top, and it's amazing!  I'm sure I'll be asked to bring this again!

I followed this recipe exactly and I was very disappointed.  It was not creamy at all and was dry. I think the macaroni is too much for this recipe. I suggest reading the other reviews for changes to make it better.

I gave this a five. I used two cups of half and half and doubled the cheese. I thought it needed a little more spicing up but nobody else thought so. It was a hit at our Father's Day gathering. Everyone kept asking who made it. It doesn't reheat very well but it's still a keeper.

A hit at dinner...I added a little something different. I tore up bread slices into pieces..poured a little melted unsalted butter over them and then topped the dish with them before it went into the oven. Gave a little crispy contrast to the gooey. Good recipe.

I'm always a little confused when people give a high rating to a dish and then tell about the many changes they make, but on this one I'm going to do the same.  I first made a roux sauce with butter, flour and the half & half, then added the processed cheese.  I also added a few slices of smoked provolone cheese and stirred until these cheeses melted.  Since many people commented on bland taste, I added approx 1 tsp cayenne pepper.  I poured this over the cooked macaroni and stirred in the other cheeses (I just eyeballed the amounts).  I did not use the eggs.  This was very cheesy with a hint of spice and my guests raved about it!

This was good mac and cheese and not difficult at all to make but I prefer a stronger flavor.  I intend to add some hot pepper sauce to it the next time I make it and maybe some pepper jack cheese.  I might omit the eggs as well and increase the half and half for a creamier texture.

HUGE hit at our house.  If you can get past the idea of all the fat, it's the best mac & cheese around.

This will be a staple in our house - we used muenster, pepperjack, cheddar, & colby and whole wheat pasta.  It turned out great!  I also made an extra pan and froze it in plastic containers for future lunches and it heats up wonderfully!

If you don't like a creamy mac and cheese this would be ok but it is too dry for my taste.

Much tastier than average. I cut back on the eggs, used more cheese, threw in some sour cream and topped with bread crumbs. It's a lot more work than your standard mac-and-cheese and more expensive, too. It keeps well.

Good but not my favorite mainly because I like a creamy texture on my macaroni and cheese which I can get with a lot less trouble by just using American cheese and milk on the pasta. For the heavier cheesy/butter type macaroni this is good.

This was great... pretty similar to Noodles and Company Mac and Cheese.  I used 2 cups half and half, no eggs, and reduced the butter by about half, but increased cheese amounts.  To cook the sauce, I just heated up the half and half to boiling, added the cheese until melted, then poured over macaroni.  I didn't have time to bake it and it was still fantastic!

Always a hit! Definitely a go-to when I need a crowd pleaser. I make sure to melt the velveta with the noodles before I add everything else (make sure its not hot when you add the eggs). Also, I don't add butter. So So So yummy

This is definitely my favorite baked macaroni and cheese recipe. Using several kinds of cheese really adds a lot of layer to the flavor. In order to be more budget-friendly, I sometimes find it easier to buy variety bags of shredded cheese (ie italian mix, mexican mix), so as to include as many cheeses as possible and experiment with the flavor.

It tasted good but was very rich and greasy. I did add tuna to it the next day for lunch though and this seemed to make it better. Probably wont make it again.

Delicious. I used 2 cups of milk and the cheeses I used were the velveeta, cheddar, and a chipotle cheddar from whole foods. Added extra cheddar to the top and a sprinkle of paprika... it was beautiful and tasty. I made the sauce separate but it still split a little, did not effect the taste. Made this to go with a grilled pork tenderloin and the sesame green beans from this site.

This was a cheesy sensation, I just love it.  I took others advice and made the roux with the half and half (2 cups) and the cheese.  I would cut back on the velveeta and I added 1/2 brick cream cheese that I had on hand.  I also cut the butter in half, as it it plenty rich without it.  I topped it with bread crumbs and parmesan at the last, and it was really cheesy and yummy.  Make sure you don't overcook the noodles at the beginning, however, or it will be too mushy.

After reading other reviews, I made it with 2 cups of half&half. I made no other modifications to the recipe and it was great.   Creamy, rich and cheesey.  Not dry at all.  And it reheated great too.  I will probably make it one more cold winter night this year and then put it away until next winter.

This is great but makes a ton! (There's just two of us and a 9x13 is too much.) Great comfort food and tastes okay as leftovers even though the consistency gets kinda chunky. Still great. I've scoured the web trying to find a good homemade mac & cheese recipe and wanted to cry when I found this one. :)

Loved this recipe! It was VERY easy and so delicious.  I used 1 cup of mozzarella, 2 cups mild cheddar, and 1 cup colby/montery jack mixed.  I also used 2 cups 1/2 and 1/2 and melted the 8ozs of velveta in the 1/2 and 1/2 before adding to the macaroni. All other directions were followed to the letter.  Great! I will definitely make this again!

This is incredibly addictive!
My hubby's idea, which made the dish OMG goood, is to add a bag of CRUSHED croutons to the top!  When it's done baking, the texture and taste are perfect!

Very yummy and creamy. I made for sons B-day party - kids and parents had seconds. I have been asked for the recipe. I only used cheddar, mozza, and velveeta as it was all I had on hand.

Simple and delicious. I've made this recipe several times and my family absolutely loves it. I omit the butter in this recipe. I also substituted Parmesan cheese for the muenster, because that is what I had on hand. Delicious. In a separate bowl, I melt 1 cube of butter and combine with 1.5 cups of breadcrumbs. Sprinkle on top. Creates a nice, light crumbly topping. Yum!

Quick, easy, and fun.  This is a MUST for anyone who loves cheese!  It's a personal flaw, but I ALWAYS add extra cheese to everything, and it only made this one better.  The last time I made this, I didn't have the cream so used regular milk instead and it came out just as great.  This is definitely my new mac & cheese staple.

This recipe is expensive and a lot of work for the taste being as bland as it is. I won't make this again when there are better recipes out there.

Creamy cheesy goodness!  I used a lot more half & half (about double) and some milk, cream cheese and velveeta.  I skipped the eggs altogether.  This recipe is easy to do, and mixes well with other flavors.  I added bacon. My husband opened a can of chilli and added it to his helping (leftovers, the next day)

Delicious!  I left out the egg and put the sauce over the macaroni straight from the stove instead of baking it in the oven.  I will definitely make this again!

Seems I am the odd man out  for this recipe.  I followed the recipe, except for the common review suggestion of adding more cheese and more half and half.  The result was okay, but certainly nothing to rave about. It also made a whole lot more than I expected. The recipe says it will feed 6, but it's more likely to feed 10-12 adults.

Fabulous!! This is very, very rich.  I followed others advice and omitted the eggs.  Blend I used was 1c sharp cheddar, 1c mild cheddar, 1c colby/jack, 8 oz velveeta and 8 oz. cream cheese.  Of all my easter side dishes, this one was easily the best. Just divine!  Best when served immediately, but leftovers (the little that there was) were good when a little milk was added when reheating.

The recipe was excellent.  In addition to the half and half I added another 1/2 cup of milk but it still could have been a bit creamier. I did make it the day before I cooked it so the pasta may have soaked up some of the liquid.  It got rave reviews from everyone.  I didnt' have any muenster or monteray jack so I used more extra sharp cheddar, a bit more regular cheddar which was fat free, a little mozzerella, and some pizza cheese, and of course the velveeta.  Yummy.  Will make again and add ham!  Thanks!

Everyone loved it and it was the first time I made macaroni and cheese from scratch.  I did take the advise of others and left out the eggs.  I also used BBQ potatoe chips on top.  It was a success and a keeper.  Oh I also just mixed together a good blend of whatever cheeses I had on had, it didn't seem to change anything.

This is a good recipe if you like macaroni and cheese square, which I do.  It really stuck together but had a delicious cheesy flavor.  Next time I would add some bacon to it to give it just a little different flavor.  However, if you are expecting a creamy mac and cheese, this is not it.

I was really disappointed by this recipe. It used a lot of ingredients and it wasn't really cheesy or creamy like others mentioned. I followed the instructions to the letter. Somehow it came out both runny and lumpy. Too bad.

Wonderful and creamy.  I did add extra cream (not sure how much; just kept mixing til it looked right) and also added in extra shredded cheese (but not processed).  I served with grilled ham.  Next time I will cube the ham and add that in as well.

I followed the recipe minus the egg. This was one of the best mac n cheeses I have ever had after it came out of the pot, everyone agreed. However, after it came out the oven it lost its creamyness. Next time I will serve it without baking.

Man, oh man!!! This was a HUGE hit at a comfort food dinner party I had recently. I followed the suggestions from several other commenters and cut back on the liquids and it came out perfect. I did find that the cheese on top made it almost too cheesy (if there is such a thing). Some of my guests preferred the second version I made, in which I didn't add the cheese topping but rather put on a thick dusting of breadcrumbs. I will definitely be making this again!

I've searched awhile for a good mac-n-cheese recipe and this seems to fit the bill.  I prepared this dish exactly as written for Thanksgiving, and it turned out very well.  Next time, I will take the advice of previous reviewers and increase the amount of Velveeta for an even creamier result.

We loved this mac and cheese! I roughly doubled the cheeses and did not use the egg.  I also used less than a lb of pasta because it wasn't all going to fit in my casserole dish. It turned out beautifully, and we are enjoying leftovers. Definitely will be my new mac and cheese recipe!

Huge hit, I made this as part of a comfort food dinner party for friends and it was gone. I had upped it to 12 servings but forgot to get enough half and half so I added a can of cheddar cheese condensed soup and it worked devinely.  Thank you!  This will become "my" mac and cheese recipe from now on.

Really good. I doubled the shredded cheeses, as other reviewers suggested, and used the 8 oz of processed cheese as in the recipe. I then topped it with buttered bread crumbs and left off the extra butter that the recipe says to put on top. It was very good. My only complaint was that it didn't heat up very well. The cheese didn't melt properly when heated up the next day and it was in clumps. So eat it the day you make it for the best flavor/texture.

This macaroni & cheese recipe is awesome! I really loved it... my boyfriend thought it could use a kick, but he's dulled his tongue with too many peppers, so he's a little biased.  It was just the right mix of creamy, without being like a box of Velveeta. The only change I made was to add some sausage (the grown-up version of mac & cheese with hotdogs). Thanks for the recipe!

This is now my standard mac and cheese recipe.  Everyone loved it.  It is just the way my husband and I like our homemade macaroni and cheese.  I did use just sharp cheddar instead of mild and sharp.  You could use different cheeses and it will still be great!

Delicious!  I made this for Christmas dinner along with meatloaf - true comfort food!  I added a few more spices to mine, but it is delicious with just the base recipe!  I also added crushed Ritz crackers to the top to add a nice crunchy texture.  Wonderful reheated the next day as well!  Thanks for a great recipe!

It took longer than expected the first time to prepare, but what a hit with the family! I used about one extra cup of cheese. The kids loved it. Said it tasted like a dish at the Olive Garden.

WOW I made this dish for a potluck and it showed up late (thanks to my hubby), but people still ate it when they were full!  We took the leftovers and ate it for dinner and i couldn't believe how creamy and wonderful it was.

I omitted the eggs like the other reviewers had suggested.  I used evaporated milk instead of half and half, and it did come out very rich and creamy, but very bland.  When reheated it tasted a little better, with lots of salt and pepper, but I spent a LOT of money on the cheeses and it wasn't worth it in the long run.

My husband and I love mac and cheese.  This is the best receipe I ever made.  I use Pepper Jack cheese in place of the Monterey Jack for some zip and have used  other types of cheese in place of the Muenster and it is great!

This recipe was pretty good, I made it for thanksgiving so I added extra of everything into my recipe.  People said it was good but I felt that it was a bit bland.  I think it would have been better if I added some mustard powder along with a bit of onion powder some salt and pepper.  It tasted better warmed up in the microwave though.

I thought this was really bland and I used all good quality cheeses.  Too bad, I was really excited about this one.  The eggs are nice though - really makes the dish fluffy.

excellent recipe, if you really want to make it into a "meal" add either cubed cooked ham or cooked crumbled bacon. Really tasty!  I also topped mine with diced fresh tomatoes for the last 5- 10 minutes of baking.  Hubby loves it

wonderful. Like other's I ommitted the egg.  I used a mixture of the cheeses, since it can be expensive and it turned out fab.  Put kilbose on top and serve with a salad.

This recipe was far too rich. Next time I will use low fat milk and a little more than called for. I'm still looking for the perfect macaroni and cheese.

This recipe was good, but, I too, was disappointed that it was not as creamy and gooey as I expected.  It had a good flavor, but was a little dry.  I will add more cheese next time.

This is THE BEST Macaroni and Cheese that I have EVER tried! It didn't dry out...this recipe stayed creamy and gooey like Macaroni and Cheese should be! My whole family loved it...even my picky 4 year old! So I would say this is an excellent recipe to try if you do have a picky eater at home like I do. This recipe will be my contribution for the next Holiday meal. Wonderful recipe Kimberly!

Not sure what happened here, but this tasted just like regular macaroni  cheese. I guess all the cheese' tastes cancelled each other out. Pretty expensive too.

Nobody in my family liked it the first night.  It was very rich, and sort of bland, like maybe it needed dry mustard or something to jazz it up.  I reheated the leftovers and we liked it better then, maybe because it seemed less rich when it was drier.

This was indeed a rich, creamy version of mac-n-cheese.  As though it needed more calories, I added chopped kielbasa which provided an excellent foil for the dense pasta.  I am quite impartial to Velveeta (really, what IS it, after all?) and will leave it out or cut it in half for the next time around.  I also tried some pepper jack cheese and fresh parmesan on the top for a little more upscale version.  This will be a keeper for me.

This macaroni and cheese recipe was the best I've ever had.  It was so good I had to make my husband save me a piece to take for my lunch.  It was really easy to make too. For an extra crispy topping add crushed crutons.

I’ve made this recipe before and love it - it’s my go to Mac and cheese whenever cooking for a potluck! Quick question, has anyone made this in a crock pot?  I want to make it for Thanksgiving but oven space will be limited, so hoping to make it easier on the hosts. Any suggestion appreciated!!

Kids love it and we make it on a regular basis.  Every 2 to 3 months.  This time, I upscaled to high end italian cheeses, provolone, parmesan, and others.  Wow.  What a difference when you change from the basic North American cheeses

It's not as delicious as I expected it to be. With all the cheese I put into it, it seemed like I was still lacking cheesiness. I may have done something wrong.

I've made this several times for reunions, Thanksgivings, and Christmases. It's a hit with the kids AND the adults. My husband also hates mac n cheese made from a roux, so this recipe is perfect.

Easy to make and my children and their girlfriends loved it. I mean, my husband and I liked it too, but our opinions don't count. I will be making it again tomorrow for thanksgiving!
On a different note: I didn't have any processed cheese on hand, so I substituted cream cheese. It worked out very well. I just melted it while I melted the butter and that coated the mac!

I followed the recipe aside from doubling the amount of cheese. I thought this was AMAZING. So good and easier than making a cheese sauce like i usually do.  Next time I will try with the original amount of cheese in the recipe.  This is my new favorite mac n cheese.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this by the recipe  but it is far from Creamy as other mentioned. I will probably use the cheese combination again but will plan to change the overall recipe if I make it again

This was one of the best Mac & Cheese recipes I've ever had! My whole family loved it! I took other people's suggestions and used 2/3 cup of the Monterey Jack, Muenster and Cheddar cheeses. Also, before I added the half and half and the Velveta to the noodles, I mixed the half and half, Velveta, salt and pepper in a small saucepan on low heat until the Velveta was melted.

This is a family favorite.  I made this one year for some holiday and now am asked to make it every holiday!  I've simplified the recipe in that I use 4 cups of whatever cheese I have (usually cheddar (2 cups) and some other cheese (2 cups) and the Velveeta.  No matter what cheese I make it with, it's a hit!  But I started off with the original recipe which was a winner!   You can't lose with this recipe!

This is my favorite Mac and cheese recipe. I like to change up the cheeses sometimes. I have replaced sharp cheddar with havarti and used Colby instead of mild cheddar. I also like to add diced ham but smoked sausage works nicely too.

This was made when we were expecting a lot of kids for a family event.  The kids loved it and so did the adults!  I slow cooked in crock pot for several hours.  When ever we have any large family events, this is the first thing requested for me to cook.  It's easy and quick to prep.

this is the best macaroni and cheese recipe that I have ever tasted. When I make this recipe I usually have to double or triple the batch. My family can wipe this out in one swoop. I have now put this as one of our regular meals twice a month.

I have made this several times over the years with a variety of cheeses- all good. My favorite is simply a block of the cheddar gruyere blend from Trader Joes and the Velveeta. I use almost double the shredded cheese, 3-4 cups based on what I have available. I also sometimes add a dash of nutmeg, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and/or ground mustard. You can't go wrong so feel free to experiment!

This is a great baked mac and cheese, but I only gave it 4 stars because I did have to add more half and half, cheese and seasoning to adjust (50% more). My kids love breadcrumbs, so I took the last tablespoon of butter, mixed in panko breadcrumbs, sprinkled on top and broiled til golden at the end of the baking time. It looked delicious!

I thought this was a pretty good dish. It was easy to make. I went to the store late and could not order Munster from the Deli so I used double cheddar instead. It tasted good but I did not enjoy the "egg" texture of the dish. I think next time I make this, I won't use egg as others had said not to and use more cheese. My husband said he really liked it and would like me to take it again, so score for the DH

I hosted a party for 125 people. This was a big hit. Everyone though it was delicious. Next time (for my taste buds),  I would add a little less of the processed cheese and a little more sharp cheedar. Very Good!

When you double the cheese, this is great! I also added 2 cups of half and half per other reviewer's suggestions. This was very creamy and had a nice consistency. Next time I might try adding a bread crumb topping, and maybe a little garlic powder and red pepper flakes to jazz it up a bit. But even made as directed, this is a great, basic mac and cheese recipe. I will make this again for sure!

Made this for a pregnant friend who was craving creamy mac and cheese.  She loved it and finished the whole pan within 24 hours.  I don't eat cheese, but if her reaction is worth anything, this is definitely a winner!

Great Recipe: some of my orig review was cut off... I posted that this is Patti Labelle's recipe but someone else mentioned it too, gotta give props to Patti! I used whole wheat medium shell noodles and it was great with the whole wheat! I also added just a little extra of each cheese and liked it better with slightly more cheese the second time.

Came out very tasty because of the 4 different kinds of cheeses used.  The only changes I made: (1) instead of the processed cheese, I used the same amount of mild cheddar and (2) I baked it for 25 minutes instead of the suggested 35 to avoid potentially overcooking and drying it out and (3) I skipped the egg like most people here.  Probably the best mac n cheese I've had!

Loved this recipe but made a few changes to lighten it up. Used whole wheat noodles, 3 T margarine, skim milk, egg whites, 2% cheddar, light velveeta, and smoked gouda instead of shredded muenster (not sure that saved calories but it was delicious!). I can only imagine how good it is if you follow recipe as is!!!!

Much the same as Patti La Bell's Mac and Cheese, which is the BEST mac and cheese ever.

I also left out the eggs, used a mixture of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses, and subbed whole milk for the 1/2 and 1/2.  I didn't dot butter. I did  bake part-way, stir, and then cover and bake the remaining time.

The BEST Mac n' Cheese I've had. I've made this for a few parties and it has been a hit every time. Friends always ask for the recipe. It is a bit time consuming and all the cheese can be a little pricey but it makes a lot and is totally worth it. Great comfort food!

I thought it was pretty good. I like things a little spicy so I added some cayenne pepper to the mix. But I think it needed something a little extra. But I would make it again.

Pretty good, much too rich for me and my kids, though. I followed all of "Kimzee"'s recommendations, not exactly the original. I actually liked it better when I sampled it prior to baking. Thank you for sharing this.

oh my gosh;  I've never made mac and cheese and I really don't care for it but I made this and thought I died and went to heaven.  It was so good.  Next time I will cut in half though because it makes so much.

I omitted the "processed" cheese for obvious reasons. Came out great! I would omit the egg next time as I think it may have cooked in the macaroni giving it a weird texture. All in all, great recipe! Went together great with our E. Carolina Pulled Pork!!

very good, with a few modifications. I cooked the whole grain macaroni, then made a separate mixture of the cheeses, half and half, egg (i only used one), Velveeta, and butter. I used twice the cheese that was called for in the recipe. I also added a tiny bit of powdered onion and paprika before mixing it in a large casserole dish and topping with a little of the shredded cheeses, but no butter. Next time I will cut back on the amount of butter called for in the recipe by just a little.

THIS IS SOOO GOOD!  I am not a fan of mac and cheese at all and I loved this!  It is just the right amount of richness and creaminess.  I used margarine because I had no butter on hand and used 8 oz. of montery jack, 8 oz. of Velveeta, and the rest was a Mexican blend of shredded cheese since that's what I had on hand.  Fantastic and will defnitely keep this one around!

Surprisingly it wasn't cheesy enough.  I even thought I had too much cheese at one point, but by dinner time, it was obvious that it was a little flavor-less.

This is the Mac n' Cheese I've been waiting for!  Only a couple of changes; omitted the eggs, used whole milk in place of the half-and-half, and didnt bake it.  So creamy and cheesy...YUM!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I had my tonsils taken out not even a week ago and I have been going stir crazy so have taken on cooking for my boyfriend. His favorite is mac and cheese so he is a tough critic... my parents stopped by to check on me (and right before the macaroni was finished) so they decided to eat too. I followed the recipe with some minor changes based on other reviews...   I boiled the macaroni with 1 tbsp. veg oil, drained then added a stick of melted butter. I heated 2 cups of half and half and then tempered my two beaten eggs with it, in which i added to the macaroni along with all of my cheeses. I shredded a cup each of mild cheddar, sharp cheddar, monterey jack and pepper jack (so much better when done yourself) and then added 8 oz of velveeta, which didn't completely melt in the pot (a good thing).  I then transfered my macaroni to my baking dish and added italian seasoned breadcrumbs. I baked it on 350 for 15 minutes and then broiled it for almost 2 minutes so the breadcrumbs crisped.  I let it sit for 5 minutes before serving and everyone RAVED about this dish! (Unfortunately I couldn't have any, but just knowing they enjoyed this mac and cheese so much made it worth it) As for the velveeta, after baking it the cubes had melted forming little cheesy pockets!! SO YUMMY! :)

I've been wanting to make homemade mac n cheese for a while, and this recipe was pretty good.  I substituted mozzarella for muenster because that's all I had.  I doubled each of the cheeses except for the processed cheese.  That was perfect.  My only complaint would be with the processed cheese.  The recipe didn't really say what to do with it and I just cut the 8 oz. into smaller cubes....when mixing together they didn't melt completely so some spots are cheesier than others.  Next time I will either cut into smaller piece or maybe layer the noodle mixture and place slices of the "velveeta".  Other than my few changes I will definitely make again.

I tried to make this recipe a little more affordable by using 2 cups of a cheese blend instead of buying 4 different cheeses.  This recipes is not the most healthy or cost effective version with all of the butter and cheese. But, I thought I would try a different version, because it was for a work party. I melted the cheese in the half and half a little in the microwave to make a more smooth sauce and then whisked in the eggs. It would probably also work together on the stove on low. The sauce has a really good flavor.  But, it wasn't really creamy in consistency and when baked it had some separation. The flavor overall is very good, but the mac n cheese once baked has a texture that is "chewy."

This recipe is great.  I made this for Easter and doubled the recipe but forgot to buy sharp cheddar cheese so I just added more mild cheddar cheese.  Also, after about 15 minutes of baking the mac n cheese I took it out of the oven and added a crushed Ritz cracker/butter mixture crust and put it back in the oven for the rest of the time (keeping an eye on the crust though so it didn't burn).  It was great and everyone raved about it!!!

This was really good! I sized it down a bit for my boyfriend and I, but came out better than we thought. This was the first recipe I tried from this site and it came out awesome! Though, the only thing-we didn't use all the butter the recipe said for. Next time I'll try adding ham to it, thanks much.

My mom used to make a homemade mac n cheese, I don't think I appreciated it as much then as I do now.. Everytime I make this recipe, they ask if it was my mothers.. No, I got that card long ago and lost it! This is a good replacement, always a hit, and I never get any leftovers to take home!! =( oh well. I usually add ALOT more cheese than the 2 total cups in the recipe, for example I used two packages of shredded cheese labeled two cups each, plus a good chunk of Tillamook shredded in as well (plus the Velveeta called for in the recipe). OMG it is soooo good!! I can never remember which cheeses it calls for so I just pick and choose- usually I do mozzarella, colby & monterey jack mix, medium cheddar (Tilla) and I think thats it.. One day I plan to add pepper jack. Anyway, GREAT recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Excellent recipe...great flavor and simple to make!  I also followed the reccommended modifications as per the reviews (no eggs, extra cheese and half and half).  Instead of the Mont. Jack I used a Mexican cheese blend.  Plain pepperjack would be good too if you're like us and like a little heat!  I felt it needed some kind of protein though, so I fried a pound of bacon on the side and crumbled it, and sprinkled it on top after baking...YUM

I could only give this recipe 2 stars because I think that it is a good "base" recipe but can be improved with a couple of alterations. I will try this again but I will omit the eggs as well the processed cheese (I don't care for the texture of either ingredients). Also, I will cut back on the vegetable oil and the butter (the dish came out to be a little too greasy for my taste). I may also experiment withsome additional spices and other types of cheeses as well.

This recipe worked well the first time I made it!  I used more half and half and some extra cheese, and only one egg so it wasn't too dry.  I didn't do the cheese/butter sprinkled on top but next time I think I'll sprinkle grated cheese and bread crumbs on top for a crunch.

This is the most amazing macaroni and cheese recipe of all time. My husband doesn't like any homemade macaroni and cheese, and his friend doesn't either. He tried a bite of mine after I made it, and made himself a plate - AND went back for seconds, and his friend did too (and his friend is WAY picky)! The only modification I made was to double up on the cheeses like everyone suggested, and I added 1/2c italian breadcrumbs to the top, let it bake the amount called for, and then broiled it on HIGH for about 2 mins to crisp the crumbs on top. An absolute winner!!!

I followed the directions and it doesn't taste cheesy at all. Kinda plain...and I used the cheeses mentioned in the ingredients. Maybe I did something wrong? It doesn't have that strong cheese flavor.

this recipe was great!  the only changes i made were adding 3/4 cup milk and 3/4 cup heavy cream, and i tempered the eggs before adding them to avoid the eggs turning slightly scrambled.  my husband and two boys loved this recipe...i'll definently use it again.

So creamy and cheesy.  I really like the use the different cheeses and I've substituted cheeses, whatever I have on hand with the exception of the velvetta cubes..that's a must.  Also, I made it ahead one morning and didn't bake it until the afternoon and that really affected the creaminess, don't make ahead unless you're going to bake it immediately.

EXCELLENT! Reading the reviews I was tempted to leave out the eggs and blah blah blah I am glad I didnt change it!  All I did was add a bit more cheese and it was delicious!  My husband had 3 helpings and my super-uber-pickyer than picky 4 year old ate some too, which almost NEVER happens, without persuasion.  I am saving this and will make it many more times.

Wonderful recipe! I used 'cheap' cheese loaf which made this a little 'grainy' so the next time will go for the real mccoy....Velveeta....other than learning that lesson from my own frugality this was a GREAT recipe. Comfort food for sure.

This is phenomenal.  I took another reviewer's advice and doubled the cheese - it was heaven.  It's one of those dishes that is so heavenly, it's sinful.  I'll only be able to make this on holidays because it's way too yummy and way too bad for me.  I'm sure one serving would take up my entire days worth of weight watchers points, but it's worth it every once in a while.

This was good and rich. I think I still prefer the recipe for baked macaroni and cheese from the back of the Mueller's box better. Just haven't been able to find anything to compete yet.

After reading some of the existing reviews I used a tad more cheese than the recipe calls for and only one egg. This was my first time making  m & c from scratch and it was to die for, if I do say so myself! lol Even my five-year-old niece asked for more. I will definitely make this again.

This was a HUGE hit with my family. Served it for Christmas dinner. Dbled the shredded cheeses only and also used 2 cups of half n half. Did not add the eggs just because I have never made Mac n Cheese with eggs.  Was very creamy and tasty. The leftovers were just as good. Heated them with a little milk and butter.

I used 2c cream, 1c hickory maple cheddar, 1c muenster, 2c mozzarella. I melted them all with the cream and butter then mixed with the cooked pasta. I sprinkled parm/romano mix over the top. It was super creamy and delicious. Reheating takes away the creaminess for the most part. I didn't use eggs or salt or pepper and used olive oil instead of veg oil.

This was very good, my husband loved it.  I too only used one egg.  I doubled the cheese and I used a pint of half and half.  I baked it a little longer so the cheese on top got nice and golden.  It was yummy.  Nice comfort food for a cold day.

I get so many requests for this.  I actually do something a little different but I believe other people have commented on doing it this way.  I put the half and half on the stove and melt the velveeta with the butter.  I pour that over the cooked noodles and stit in the eggs and most of the cheese mixture, leaving some for the top.

This was a huge hit at my house over the holidays. I was only able to use sharp cheddar, mild cheddar & jack cheese in addition to the processed cheese but it was still very good and encores were requested when we ran out!

Wow, sure beats the blue box! This is excellent. Follow almost everything except the baking part. Super creamy and super delicious. My suggestion is use the cheese that you like. If you don't like the particular cheese don't put it the mac and cheese. Chose something you like. Excellent!

I was nervous about the eggs since everyone went on and on about avoiding them. But if you like southern style mac and cheese, you will keep all of the ingredients as suggested and add more cheese if you like.  Without the egg, I'm guessing you get a creamy (soupier) result like the picture on a velveeta box. But I followed the recipe to the T and Everyone liked it!  I think if I had made smaller cubes of the processed velveeta I could have spread this out more evenly. I will definitely make again and will definitely keep all of the ingredients and perhaps try a bit more cheese as suggested by others. this was deeelish!

I have made this several times now exactly according to the recipe, and people love it.  It seems a lot of reviewers have played with the recipe, but it is very good as it is, too.  It does make a mess out of the kitchen with all the cheese shredding, and it probably costs $20 to make each time because of all the cheeses you need to buy when you make it.  This has become a very "special occasion" mac and cheese for my family, but everyone always enjoys it and people ask for the recipe all the time.  Who doesn't love a good, homemade mac and cheese?

I just made this for Thanksgiving dinner.  I used 2/3 c. of the shredded cheeses, omitted the eggs, and used 2c 1/2 and 1/2.  I put the 1/2 and 1/2 and all cheeses in a pot and melted them all together into a sauce.  Before putting it in the oven it looked like it was going to be so creamy and good.  Not so much afterwards (and I only baked it for 25 minutes).  It was dry, and I was very disappointed.  It wasn't too expensive to make- I found all the cheese on sale- except for the muenster.  Oh and I also used half the butter.  I don't know how anyone can call this a "creamy" recipe.  It is not creamy!  I agree with others when they say the pasta:sauce ratio must be off.  The flavor was good- it was just dry- I didn't want dry, I wanted creamy.  I would try to make this again, because it did taste good.  Next time I will use less pasta and hope that it turns out creamier.

Wonderful! I have never made mac and cheese in my life, and never thought I would make it good. Both my parents are great cooks, they LOVED it! By suggestion of my dad, I used some hard flaky strong smelling cheese we had in the fridge for many months lol. That with the cheddar added some flavor to it. I also followed other reviewers' suggestions about mixing the cheeses, butter and half and half together before mixing it with the macaroni.

This was really good.  However, I changed up the recipe a bit.   I mixed all the cheeses, butter, 1 egg, and half and half together is a sauce pan and melted.  I cooked the macaroni seperate.  Then I mixed the two together.  It was so creamy. I and already cooked I didn't even have to put in the oven to heat up.  Everyone loved it!

This is the best mac and cheese! I make it gluten-free with brown rice elbow pasta because my daughter has celiac. It is requested at family parties- it's so creamy and delicious!

I cut the butter in half because the first time I made it it came out too oily.  I doubled up on the cheese and used the eggs.   The result has been delicios.  Crispy on top and creamy inside.

I made this for my son's 1st Bday party. I omitted the eggs becuase the baby hasn't tried them yet.  I made 2 batches- the consistency wasn't quite right on either. One was soupy and one was grainy. Tasted awesome though. I will try again, but will melt everything down first into a sauce.

I made this according to the directions and then again with changes others suggested, like substituting the muenster with mozzarella. Personally, I think it would be better without either of them. I did prefer it with the changes such as making a cheese sauce and pouring it over the noodles and not sprinkling cheese on top the mixture. It's a lot creamier with the changes.

I made this tonight. Great recipe. Although I accidently used too much butter! Speaking of that, I read through some of the reviews for this recipe and Patti LaBelle's and many people complained that the flavor was a bit bland. I suggest using salted butter, no other salt is needed and it gives just the right amount of seasoning to balance the pepper.

I was looking for a creamy mac-n-cheese and found it with this amazing and yummy receip! Dont let all the ingredients scare you either..(I was scared) it goes together so easy. I also am a resident of MX and some of these cheeses are had to come by so I used pepper jack, white cheddar and a similar product to the Velveeta. I didn't have half-n-half, but my 2% in the fridge worked fine. Yummy! I also only baked for 20minutes in my gas oven.

This recipe is awesome! I used 2 cups half-and-half and left out the eggs. I added some grilled chicken and sprinkled with parmesean. A perfect fall casserole. I invited my neighbors over and they loved it too!!! Thanks!

I love this recipe. My family is really big on Mac and Cheese. They all loved it and asked for the recipe. The only change I made was I switched out the plain Cheddar Cheese for a smoked Gouda. It gives it a little more southern taste. Goes great with everything.

WOW... I am eating it right now and is is soooo cheesy! Maybe cus i added A LOT of cheese. I added 1 cup of both the sharp and mild cheddar, 1 cup of monterey jack and 8 oz of velveeta. (I couldnt find the muenster), 2 cups half & half and no eggs. It is very good but next time I'm going to lessen the shredded cheese because every time i get a forkful the cheese strings up from the plate, lol! Mmmm... so so good!

This recipe was really really yummy! I had to double it because I needed to make this for my class tomorrow morning. Since I doubled it I used the whole half and half. I like creamy mac n cheese. I did everything the directions said. I left it in the oven for 17 mins. Since I had read a lot about the eggs i decided to only use 2 since I doubled it. It was soo yummy and very very filling which i love.

I love this recipe it is very versatile.  I've made this twice now with and without eggs and both times my family ate it up.  The last time I made this recipe I made some changes to this recipe that I found to be very tasty and I wanted to share them.  Here are my modifications: I used more cheese and half and half than the recipe called for (about 2 cups half and half and well over 1/2 cup of each cheese).  In a saucepan over low heat, I added half and half, all the cheeses, and a little white wine stirring constantly until all the cheeses are melted and the sauce is smooth.  Also, I did not add the eggs to the cheese sauce.  I then mixed the cheese sauce into the buttered elbows.  Next, I had some leftover rotisserie chicken and carrots that I cooked up in chicken broth, white wine, and all purpose seasoning.  I mixed the chicken and carrots (juice and all) into the macaroni and cheese before baking the macaroni and cheese in a glass dish.  I found using the juice from the chicken and carrots kept the macaroni from getting too dried out and it gave it some nice flavor.  I hope this helps.  I'm sorry I don't have measurements on some of these ingredients as I mostly cook by eye and taste.

Made this recipe last week with some of the modification suggested by others.  Was disappointed.  Did not find it rich or creamy.  While the flavor was good, the consistency was terrible due to the cheddar cheeses.  It was gritty and very oily.  I will not be making this recipe again.

This wasn't bad ... I wouldn't call it "creamy" though. I even doubled the cheese and it still came out in a dry, solid, block ... will keep looking for a creamier mac and cheese recipe ...

This recipe is delicious!  I took it to my boyfriend's family reunion and it was a big hit!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it's pretty expensive buying all of the different kinds of cheeses. I made it exactly like the recipe says but don't forget to temper the eggs before adding it to the mixture.  I think that might be causing the bad texture some reviewers are talking about.

This was actually pretty dry and fluffy and I cut it down to one egg, per other reviewers' advice. I did add some minced onion and garlic to the butter in the beginning but even then it didn't have a ton of flavor.  This probably is a good base mac and cheese recipe.  I will add more Velveeta for creaminess and some sharper, better cheddar for the next try.

This recipe makes a very classic macaroni and cheese dish. We loved it! I'd like to try it again and substitute the half and half for milk for a lower fat recipe. I'll be adding this to my recipe book.

i omitted the velveeta because i'm not a fan. but that was a mistake. even with all the other cheeses, it wasn't nearly cheesy enough. and i found that it was way too oily, even after draining some of it off once we took it out of the oven. if i make this again i'll definitely use the velveeta.

I made this as a surprise for my husband last night.  He loved it!  This was a delicious recipe for traditional-tasting mac and cheese.  I made a couple of changes, though.  I didn't use an egg, but I added an extra half-cup of half-and-half.  I also sprinkled plain bread crumbs on top of the dish before I stuck it in the oven.  Changes aren't necessary; I just made it the way I thought my husband would like it best.

Very good!  I've made it twice now and have had several requests for the recipe.  As suggested by other users, I do double the cheese (except for the processed cheese) and only use 1 egg.  Also, be careful not to over butter.  And I'm a big fan of butter, but in this case more butter is definitely not better.  I added a little extra to the top the second time around and it was very greasy.

This was really good, my kids loved it. The only thing I did different was I didn't use the Muester cheese only because I already had so much cheddar and jack cheese in the fridge already. I aldo didn't do the egg and added 2 cups of half and half.

I made this last night and it was great!  I doubled the shredded cheese and used 2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2.  I melted it all together before mixing in the macaroni.  I all added 1 pound of bacon that was cooked and crumbled.  I used the eggs. Yum!

I love this recipe...when I first made it did it exactly how the recipe said to. But the second time I skipped the muenster cheese cause it's to hard to find and just added extra cheddar and sharp cheddar, I also add cooked bacon and diced jalapenos.  It was a smash hit. It's not to spicy, it's just the right amount of spice. it's also good with just the bacon for people who aren't a fan of spice.

I am planning a picnic to surprise my date, and her favorite food is simply mac and cheese.  I decided to take it up a step and was looking all day for "the perfect" recipe to make some home made mac-n-cheese.  I came across this one the list of ingredients looked a little intimidating at first, but it was actually incredibly simple to make.   I followed the ingredients exactly, but made a few minor changes.  I cooked the pasta a tad bit longer so it'd be a little softer when complete.  I also mixed all the cheeses, eggs, and half and half in a bowl together first before adding them to the noodles.  I found it was a lot easier to mix this way. I have been eagerly awaiting the results and just took a few bites of the end product... amazing!  This completely changes my view on mac and cheese from being a $1 snack from a walmart isle to something that could be served while fine dinning.  I can't wait to surprise my date with it. :) Thanks for this recipe.  The only con I have is all the cheese start to add up and take a bite out of your wallet.

This was very good macaroni and cheese. It's actually only the second "serious" mac and cheese recipe I've tried. Prior to that I just used the Kraft packaged mix and added shredded cheddar. Like many other reviewers I made some changes: I omitted the eggs, increased the shredded cheese by 50%,used parmesan instead of meunster and added fontina. I also added 1/2 tsp. minced garlic, used white pepper instead of black, and topped it with fresh bread crumbs mixed with the parmesan. Like other reviewers I melted the velveeta with the half-and-half and butter and mixed in most of the shredded cheese, then added it to the macaroni and topped it with the remaining shredded cheese. It turned out really good and was great re-heated. Next time I think I'll try it with two cups heavy cream, halve the velveeta, and add additional cheddar. This is definitely a keeper.

This recipe is exactly like what my mom used to make, except I like the addition of the Muenster cheese (awesome!) I some advice of the other reviewers and I made a "cheese sauce" with the half and half this was a great idea since it made such a great consistency throughout.  This is a winner!  I'm going to experiment with other cheeses in my "cheese sauce" next time.

So good! I did what other reviewers suggested, I doubled the shredded cheese and used 2 cups of half and half, and omitted the egg and pepper. I also topped with Panko crumbs mixed with melted butter. Baked for 15 minutes and then broiled for a couple minutes to brown the crumbs. I brought this to a party and recieved so many compliments and recipe requests. Next time I think I will use the larger macaroni pasta so it resembles more of a restaurant style.

This is the BEST mac & cheese ever!!  My son who is a picky eater, asked for seconds. I just polished of the little that was left for lunch and it was still as yummy as last night!!! I made it without the half and half and the processed cheese cubes. The recipe was cheesy and scrumptious!!! Must try this recipe!!!

I made this recipe as specified with a few exceptions. As other users suggested, I omitted the eggs, doubled the cheese, and upped the amount of half and half to two cups. Oh, and I used shells instead of macaroni. Also, I couldn't find plain Monterey Jack, so I used Colby Monterey Jack. I didn't follow the directions either - I mixed the half and half, butter, and cheeses until it was all melted. Added the sauce to the cooked pasta. I was skeptical as to how it would turn out because at this point it looked extremely soupy, but decided to give it a shot since I figured the sauce would reduce while baking. Baked for 17 minutes, stirred, baked for another 17. Now for the big moment: disappointment!!! For some reason, it came out gritty. Not a hard grit, but a soft grit. Also, there was grease pooled at the top. The flavor was alright. I could really taste Muenster cheese, and I didn't quite enjoy the tang. The soupiness went away for the most part. My boyfriend loved it, other than the gritty texture. I don't know if I'll make it again. I might attempt again to see if I can avoid the grittiness.

Good stuff.  didn't have velvetta, so just added other cheeses of choice.  Today, sub'd cream cheese for it to give a creamier/ smoother flavor.

My nine-year old went back for seconds. Need I say more (well, if you knew my kids you'd understand that this alone makes this a 5 star recipe!) I used shredded colby-jack cheese and heavy cream since I had no half & half. What's a few thousand more calories? Delicious!

I loved this recipe and how it uses so many different cheeses however i would leave out the velveeta next time.  All the cheeses were fine without it and when i heated it up the next day the velveeta(processed cheese) didnt exactly melt that well and i just didnt like the velveeta in it. I will definitely make this again but leave out the processed cheese.

I thought this recipe was alright, but a lot of work, and I wasn't extremely satisfied. First, I doubled the recipe. I used 2 cups of half/half, and all cheese, etc. Breadcrumbs on top were actually REALLY good, I'll definiately use those next time. It came out perfect, but dried out really quick. I'll try this again sometime, adding maybe a cup or so more of half/half.

Very nice.  Base recipe is a bit dry; eggs make it custardy once it cooks together. I made about 1 cup extra cheese sauce (half + half + cheddars) and poured it over after everything was baked.   Still, I'd likely make it again.

I really liked the taste of this.I made it for a b-day party I had over the weekend. But I wouldn't recomend making ahead of time if you want it creamy,[I do.] I thought this might happen so I added a can of cheese soup, thinking that might help keep it creamy. It didn't. I'll make this again just not ahead of time.

This was great!  I did make a few changes otherwise I would have rated a 5.  I used 1/2 c monterrey jack with jalapenos, 1 c white sharp, and 1/2 c parmesan as well as velveeta and mild cheddar.  Had no muenster on hand.  Used only 1 egg.  Mixed 4T melted butter with 1/2 c panko and sprinkled on top.  Put broiler on last few minutes to crunch the top.  Thanks for the recipe!

By far the best mac & cheese I have ever had! Instead of Meunster I used Mozzarella. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. It really puts the boxed stuff to shame.

I followed Kimzee's directions and made a few changes.  -I used different cheeses: 2 c Munster, 1 c Vermont cheddar, 1 c sharp cheddar -I had some heavy cream on hand that I needed to use so I used 1 c heavy cream and 1 c 2% -I caramelized onions and green peppers and added them to the mix  Enjoy!

Very dry. Not creamy at all.  I guess I should have made recipe with all the changes recommended by other reviews.  My son liked it so I will give it two stars.  Will not make again.

This recipe went over well at my house. I live with three boys - my fiance and his two brothers. This recipe does not make it twenty-four hours in our house - if there are leftovers, they are gone my morning. =)

My fiance made this one day while I was at work and we ate when I got home. I must say that I do not really have such a strong affection for cheese as she does, however, this was awesome! The cheese was not overwhelming but still had great flavor. Really heavy dish so unless make this sparingly.

Amazing! Despite the fact that this is so incredibly bad for you, it really is worth it (at least once or twice a year!).  I doubled this recipe and made it for Thanksgiving and a holiday party. It serves way more than it states on the recipe and, unless it was the main course, I would never double it again. I doubled the amount of half and half, but next time I might use a little bit less. I could ony find slices of Muenster, so I had to cut it up by hand which was a pain, so the second time I used Mozzerella instead. Either way delicious!

This was a very good recipe. I almost doubled the cheese called for and melted the cheeses and half & half before adding to noodles. I also added some Parmesian cheese to the mixture and topped with smashed cheese crackers on top of the left over shredded cheese. Next time I will add a little more liquid, the mac & cheese did turn out a little dry. Very good taste!!!

Great! The recipe is fine as is, so don't worry about all the edits to the recipe in the reviews.  I multiplied by 1.5 and it was WAAYYY too much for 2 people (but delicious leftovers!).   Here's a tip: I used fontina, mozzarella, gouda, sharp cheddar, meunster, and a little less velveeta than the recipe called for.  That combination was DELICIOUS!!! More cheese is the only addition I would make to the recipe. Also I'm a guy with little to no skillz in the kitchen so as long as you have a big casserole dish, this one should be no problem. One more tip: "a small saucepan" in no way, shape or form, is large enough to hold all the macaroni, sauce, etc.

I was not happy with the results at all.  What was good: I like using half-and-half with mac and cheese. I always use the fat free.  I love a variety of cheeses... but I don't think I like using this combination again... especially the processed cheese food.     I suggest instead of processed cheese to make a rue and      make the cheese sauce separate. The right sauce and      cheese will make it even more creamy and a little more of     a natural taste than cheese food has to offer.   What was bad:  The recipe wasn't written the best.  No herbs or seasoning. I ended up adding some basil and powdered mustard. Powdered mustard adds a very nice flavor to mac and cheese. Even if you are not a fan of mustard do not be afraid to try it. You only need about a tea spoon or so... I believe you will be pleasantly surprised.  Processed cheese food - I don't like the it adds... at all.

Good flavor.  But too dry.  Next time, I will add more cheeses, more half and half, and melt cheeses in the half and half.  Plus, I will bake for only 20 mintues instead of 35 minutes.

This is an excellent recipe. I made it in a pinch after someone requested it at a Christmas Eve dinner. I didn't have everything I needed so I improvised. I had to use fat free milk instead of half and half so I added mayo to the mixture to give it some richness. I left out the egg because of this and I had to use the cheeses I had in the fridge instead of the ones listed. It was the best I have ever made and there was none leftover.

This was excellent Macaroni and Cheese.  I normally do not make a creamy Macaroni and Cheese but my son asked me to for Xmas dinner.  It was delicious and my husband and son raved about it.  I omitted the eggs and increased the half and half and it was perfect.  We even had leftovers at lunch and another dinner and my family does not normally eat leftovers.

I am so bummed that I didn't like this.  I had high hopes for it--in fact, I took it to Christmas dinner at the in-laws which was a mistake.  I have NEVER had success with using real cheese in mac and cheese.  It always gets grainy and this was no exception.  My 3 year old wrinkled up her nose and said, "It's fuzzy."  The adults politely commented that they hadn't had mac and cheese like this in years.  Sorry.

I made this on xmas eve.  I altered the recipe a bit.  I omitted the eggs, used 1/2c more half and half and used: smoked gouda, colby, jack and fontina as my other cheeses.  It turned out so yummy!  I had tons of compliments.  It was creamy and cheesy!

This is just like Patti Labelle's Over the Rainbow Mac and Cheese except her recipes calls for 2 cups of half and half. The only difference is I melt my cheese in the crockpot before I combine and bake.

I made this for thanksgiving this year.  My daughter and husband, who are very picky eaters, loved it and requested to have it again this week.  I didn't have any muenster cheese, so I just double the other cheeses.  It still turned out great.

Sooooo decadent, soooo yummy. I'm a cheese lover, so the only change I made was to add even more cheese. I know. I'm nuts. It was a hit. I've been asked for the recipe a few times now! LOVE IT!

This is the macaroni & cheese recipe I've been searching for all my life. It is the right texture and has great flavor. This will be a "regular" on our home menu.

Great recipe - the only thing is that the next time I make it, I will omit the egg.  Otherwise, I was really happy with how this turned out.  Thanks for giving me a new mac n cheese recipe!

Awesome. Like everyone else, I doubled the shredded cheese (not the Velveeta), upped to 2 cups of half-and-half, and omitted eggs. Turned out perfect.

If I wouldn't have baked this I would have rated it a 5 star dish!  I did NOT use the eggs and I used 1 cup of the cheeses.  I made my sauce with the cream and the velveeta melted together and then I added ground mustard and paprika.  The flavor was amazing BEFORE I baked it and then it came out NOT as good.  My advice is too omit the eggs, make the cheese sauce, and DO NOT BAKE.  Hope this helps.

This is the best mac-n-cheese I think I have ever eaten. My mom made some great mac-n-cheese too. I went with the advice of most of the reviewers to up the half-n-half to 2cups and and chees to 1 cup. It was so good. I made it yesterday and my husband and I are still pigging out on the leftovers. So glad we didn't have company over this year. :)

My family liked it but weren't crazy about it.  It was easy to make but nowhere near as cheesy as I expected.  If I make it again, I'll skip the eggs as suggested.

I dumbed the recipe down because A) simple mac and cheese is just good B) because I didn't have all ingredients on hand (just got done with some major baking) and C) because I didn't feel like it (lol...just being honest)  

Sharp Cheddar melted inHeavy Cream and butter. Poured over macaroni and then sprinkled more cheddar on top...there you go.  A yummy simple meal. Not taking away from what this person did, I def will try out the recipe but I still believe there are some ingredients like the egg and salt for instance that are not needed at all.

Delicious!!! I added a little more cheese than the recipe called for and only one egg. I also used fat free half and half. It was still great, but I think next time I might try the recipe exactly as is and see if it turns out even better.

Not as cheesy as I wanted it to be. Followed the other reviews to double the cheese, omitted the eggs and put ritz crackers combined with butter and parmesan cheese on top, which did help the dish's taste to level up. For those reviewers who aren't sure about the veg oil, I'm sure it's to be put into the water/pasta while cooking. It helps the cooked pasta to be too sticky after it reaches al dente point.

Absolutely amazing! We decided to change the cheeses and chose our favorites- cheddar, american, muenster and goat cheese- yum! The only downside is that it does not save well AT ALL. My husband made it for Christmas the day before and it lacked the amazing flavor it had when it first came out. Really needs to be served right away/same day, but absolutely delicious!

I tried making this, but it came out a little bland. It seemed like there wasn't enough cheese. I'm going to try it again, but changing the shredded cheeses to 3/4 cup each. But everything turned out good. pasta was nice and firm, the final dish turned out creamy and delicious. But my family likes its cheese.

Very smooth and creamy. I used a 14.5 oz. box of the spiral noodles and used what cheeses I already had which were parmesan, mozzarella, and mild cheddar and it was delicious. I also left out the egg like the other reviewers said.

This was delicious! I did start out with a roux to make a cheese sauce and I did double the amount of cheese.  I also used smoked muenster, added some garlic and onion powder and a few dashes of cayenne and topped the whole thing with lots of bread crumbs. And as suggested I omitted the egg.  I did forget to add any butter (except in the roux) and added a few tablespoons during the combining of the cheese sauce and noodle.  I'm not sure if you need the butter. This  dish was a HUGE hit!!

I was nervous with the few 1 stars I saw but did it anyway. It is great! I had to make some changes because I didn't have some of the particular cheeses on hand. I used monteray jack, colby jack and mozzarella and velveta. I used lots of cheese and didn't bother measuring. I also didn't have cream so I created a rue with 2 tbs butter melted, 2 tbs flour, browned the flour and added milk until thickened and then added the veleta cheese. I mixed the egg, rue sauce then the cheeses. Placed in a casserole dish, topped with italian bread crumbs, salt and pepper. Great dish!

Superb.  Easy and enjoyable to prepare and delicious.  My only change was adding a cup of breadcrumbs mixed with 1/4 cup of melted butter over the top before placing in the oven.  Made it a great golden brown and had the extra benefit of a taste like a grilled cheese sandwich!  mmmmmmm, will be making this lots more as a great sidedish.

Wow, this has a LOT of cheese in it. It was really good. Not the best I've had, but good. All of the cheeses blend well together. My husband said it is in the top 10 of mac and cheeses he's had. :-)

Wonderful mac and cheese...I also double the cheeses as others have and leave out the eggs. It's perfect!

I was surprised at all the rave reviews that this did not turn out well for us at all.  I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out very dry and pretty flavorless.  Surprising with the amount of cheese that was involved.  The eggs were a bit odd also.  Is it possible this recipe called for too much macaroni?

I have tried several mac n cheese recipes and this one was the best.  I didn't use the exact ingredients because I didn't have them so I just used whatever cheeses I had on hand and somewhat followed the recipe.  I did use the eggs and I melted the cheeses I had into the half & half (cream)as the other reviewers suggested and then poured them over the cooked macaroni and then added more shredded cheese on top before baking.

Really good but I'd certainly nearly double all of the cheeses.  Certainly a keeper though.

I did not care for this recipe at all! With all the differant cheeses it was a bit "grainy" and a lil greasy. It was not cheap to make either. I followed the reviews and made changes, but it just wasn't good at all!

Followed the recipe exactly. First time I've made a true-baked mac & cheese dish and it turned out great. I didn't tweak the recipe at all.
After heating some of it up later on, I noticed the macaroni doesn't take on as cheesy of a texture in the middle as it did after baking. Maybe that's just a macaroni and cheese thing, I don't know.
Nevertheless, this one's going in my recipe book for sure!

I can cook anything but this was just plain awful.  I took the reviewers suggestions and omitted the eggs and melted the cheeses before mixing with the noodles.  Awful.  The cheese consistancy was grainy even though I used high quality cheeses.  The flavor was severly lacking.  I will not be making again.  Worst mac and cheese I've ever had.

I am searching for the perfect macaroni and cheese recipe. I read everyone's reviews and followed the suggestions with doubling the cheese and the milk. It ended up oily and it was embarassing. I will not be making this again.

This recipe is one of the best I've tried yet.  It's very creamy and the cheeses give it an interesting flavor.  I was a little skeptical about the processed cheese, but it does help with the creaminess of the recipe.  I added a little ground sausage, and it was delicious!

When I made this it came out looking beautiful and thought I had found a new mac and cheese recipe but it wasn't really what I expected in the way of taste. It was was better than most but I think it needs some tweaking. Next time I try this I'll omit the eggs and increase the half and half.

I halved this recipe for my boyfriend and I but kept the same proportions of cheese (1/2 cup of each).  With modifications: 1/2 cup more half & half), no egg, bread crumb + butter topping, paprika, garlic powder to taste, warmed half & half with Velveeta first...it was excellent!  Even reheated the next day (and the day after that).  Not a scrap left in the baking dish.  :)

WOW! This was the best Mac n Cheese I've every had and the family agrees. It was so creamy and turned out beautiful. I added a topping of 1 cup of golden bread crumbs and   half stick of melted butter. Combine the two and crumble over the top. Yummy!

I used 1/2 cup each of Monterey Jack, Pepper Jack, Mild Cheddar, and Sharp Cheddar.  Used 3/4 cup of heavy cream and 1 cup of milk since I didn't have any half-n-half. Next time will only used 1 egg instead of 2 as it was slightly dry but still good.  Also added breadcrumbs with the topped cheese mixture.  Next time will experiment w/ different cheeses and probably add some crispy bacon on top.

I thought it was great and I had a few friends try it and they loved it also. This is going to be the only macaroni and cheese I make from now on. I used fat free half and half and reduced fat cheeses and it still tasted as good but without so much fat!

The flavor is great, and it is easy to make (no white sauce to make), but the leftovers are horrible.  They are so dry.  My kids (5 and 3) actually won't even eat it the first night I make it and prefer boxed mac and cheese unfortunately.  I changed the recipe to include 2 cups half and half and only 1 egg.  My husband and I really enjoy it the first night (I've made it several times) but I think it's not worth it since nobody loves the leftovers.  I'm going back to my mom's basic white-sauce mac and cheese recipe.

To be honest...I can see where this would be good...however it not as saucy as we had hoped.  I tried it a second time and eliminated the egg and baking time (reduced baking time in half!).   It turned out better the second time...we also grilled some chicken breasts and served over the macaroni and cheese the second time.

Very good, very rich, very cheesy. The taste is amazing, but I think I could taste every calorie. I added 1 cup extra cheese and 1/2 cup extra half and half as others suggested. Everything else was exactly as written. Next time I think I'll use the exact recipe.

Excellent.  Made a couple of substitutions.  Used milk instead of half and half and Colby/Jack, sharp cheddar & Velveeta (no muenster).  I did melt the butter & Velveeta together in a pan, then I added the milk, egg, salt & pepper.  Tossed in the macaroni and shredded cheese (I ended up dumping some more shredded cheese in the pan), mixed it all up and baked for about 15 min, which was plenty of time.  It was the best ever!  No more boxed mac & cheese!

For some reason, Muenster cheese is hard to find here in the south, so I just used all colby/monteray jack and then mixed in probably 1/3 cup of Swiss for that bite.  Too much cheese is not a problem here.  I almost wish I hadn't made this now because I've HAD to make it 3 times since because my wife and buddies are addicted.     It really is that good (for mac and cheese anyway)

This is a great mac and cheese but I would suggest adding an extra 1/2 c. milk to moisten it up a bit. Would be great with a little chopped up left over ham added as well.

I love this recipe. My husband won't usually eat Mac & Cheese but he had seconds last night. I didn't have any processed cheese on hand so I used cream cheese instead and no Munster either so I used a 1/4 cup of Parmesan instead. Used an extra 1/2 cup of half and half too.... I didn't heat the half and half like other reviewers mentioned but I think it would be a great idea as the texture would be a bit creamier. Which ever way you decide to go, you can't go wrong with this recipe... Totally Awesome & the best I've EVER eaten. :)

It's a great recipe...I actually tweaked it a bit. I use 1 1/2 cups each of mild & sharp cheddar and the same amount of  processed cheese. These are the only cheeses I use. You could also substitute the half & half for whole milk. Not as creamy, but still good. I get nothing but rave reviews both ways.

I was looking forward to having this for New Year's Day dinner.  It looked promising before I put it into the oven.  But, it  changed in the oven into a dry mess.  And, I didn't overcook it.  It would have been better to have just eaten it without sticking it in the oven.  Anyway, I ate about two bites and my husband did eat a serving but had no desire to keep the rest so it got dumped into the trash.  What a waste!

It was very simpe to make.  The ingredients are almost always on hand around here.  The cheeses can be interchanged.  If you're wanting a little crunch add some crispy bacon on top when it comes out of the oven.

Easy to put together but next time I will not add the "processed cheese" as I thought it gave it an odd taste....I don't think it will be missed.  The rest of the reviews were ripe with ideas! ...BUT...if you don't make it, don't review it....we can all read and KNOW it isn't the healthiest of dishes.

Oh my gosh! This was incredible.  We had some leftover ham from Christmas that I was running out of ideas for using it up.  I cut up some hunks and added to this cheesy delight and it was delicious!  I did take a few of the other suggestions, i.e., no eggs and melting the cheese first.  Oh, and I used grated parmesan instead of munster.  I will make this again and again!

This recipe is great!  I omitted the processed cheese food, simply because I didn't know what that was.  I added 2 cups of cheese ontop along with 3/4 lb of bacon and it turned out yummy!  For more seasoning/flavor you could add a few herbs.

I made this recipe for a Christmas dinner at work.  It was not what I was expecting.  I was expecting the dish to be very creamy, rich and moist.  It was not any of those things.  I believe I will be returning back to my family recipe next time.

I followed this recipe exactly as it was written, because I didn't have time to read everyone's helpful hints. I thought it was ok, but for as much fat and calories as are in this, I would have expected more out of it. It wasn't good enough to justify how unhealthy it was (and I am not really into healthy food usually). :) I did receive compliments on it, but probably won't make it again.

This is very creamy and tasty straight out of the oven, but the leftovers (which, even with a family of mac'n cheese lovers, you will have unless you're feeding an army) were dry.  I ended up buying another pkg of noodles to make another batch to use up the rest of the cheese.  I split that batch into two aluminum pans to bake and freeze for later.

I also omitted eggs and added extra cheese...I made two batches of this at Christmastime and it was a HUGE hit.  I love it but will only make it a few times a year due to the fat content...it's worth it though!

Exactly what I was looking for.  I had been craving baked macaroni and cheese like my grandma used to make, and this sure did the trick.  So, So TASTY!  I used milk instead of half and half, because I didn't have any, and I used 12 ounces of Velveeta.  So good.  I can't say it enough!

This dish has wonderful flavor, but the texture is a little unappealing, especially when reheated.

Awesome! 5 stars! Love-Love-Love! I had to use Mozzarella because I didn't have Muenster. This is my new recipe for mac and cheese and can't wait to make it with muenster. If you add 1/2 cup of half and half then you have Patti Labelles over the rainbow recipe. Anyway this is a great recipe! If you haven't already... try this one!

I am so picky about mac and cheese.  I have only had one or two homemade versions that I really loved.  I am so glad I found this.  This is nice, old fashioned tasting mac and cheese.  I have to admit the addition of the velveeta unnerved me because it's not exactly what grandma put in it, but everything was perfect.  So rich and satisfying to the bone.  I followed recipe exactly.  Will make this again.  Make sure, though, that you don't eat this for a couple of weeks before a cholesterol test.

This is *wonderful*!  Thank you so much for this recipe.  I have tried so many mac and cheese recipes and have been disappointed.  I can stop looking now b/c this one is awesome.

The only changes I made was I used about 6 tbsp of butter and a bit of olive oil.  I didn't add the extra butter on top before putting in the oven.  And I didn't have half and half so I used 3/4 cup heavy whipping cream and 3/4 cup whole milk.  It is not creamy, but oh gosh its really good!

This was good but not awesome. I think it would have been much better if I had added the half and half to the butter, and slowly added the cheese mixture. I also added about 1/2 a cup of diced onions and fresh garlic to the butter. If I made it again I would skip the processed cheese too (it was globby), but it might have been tolerable if it had been melted in as suggested.

Very good, Very rich! I 2x for a big family and we have enough for 3 meals. I feed 4 growing boys, and they eat a lot. I left out the egg, and did what others suggested in adding all chesse together over heat and making it a cream. We also added a smoked sausage. All my boys loved it.

Not as good as I was hoping, I took this recipes to a family potluck, we all found it to be rather bland and tastless, not the creamy cheesey recipes I thought it would be. I will give it a second chance, maybe I screwed it up?

Wow...this was delicious, just what I wanted. Based on earlier reviews, I omitted the eggs and added breadcrumbs on top. Since I made this for four people I also adjusted the amount of the ingredients. I decided to make it with fat-free half and half, 2% cheeses, whole wheat pasta, and turkey bacon, but none of us could tell it wasnt't the full fat version....it came out super creamy and will be made again soon.

Sadly, this was my first attempt at making home made macaroni and cheese. Thank you for the recipe, it was a huge hit. I used the Mexican 4 cheese mix and than added additional sharp cheddar cheese. It went over so well, I am getting non stop requests from my kids to make it over and over...lol. I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks.

This is excellent!  I made 1 1/2 time the recipe for 6 adults (as a main course), and it was the perfect amount w/some leftovers.  I doubled the cheese anounts and omitted the eggs.  I also added about 6 strips of bacon...could have used a little more.  That was a really tastey addition!  If I do it again, I may add bread crumbs on top.
This one is a keeper.

This recipe is great! I made a few changes that turned out well. Like some other reviewers, I omitted the eggs. I also upped the shredded cheese to three cups, and the velveeta to nearly 16 oz. On a whim, my fiance sprinkled crushed barbeque flavored potato chips on top. Very tasty, and highly recommended!

I made this on Thanksgiving and everybody raved about it. I have always had bad luck with mac n cheese and almost gave up trying to make it but then I saw this recipe and thought it sounded good. It is delicious and real cheesy. I had some guests on Thanksgiving that are used to very good homemade soul food and they all gave this recipe the stamp of approval! Thanks!

I love this creamy mac n cheese recipe. I only used one egg and I used 2 cups of half n half. I topped it off with crumbled potatoe chips. When I mixed the cheeses I just used a zip lock freezer bag and I crushed the chips in there too. After I dumped the pasta into my strainer I melted the butter on high in the pot and then took it off the heat to dump the macaroni in. I just wanted to limit the amount of dishes I used and that made it very simple.

I don't like muenster cheese, so 
I used Mozzerella instead. It was delicious!

I made this for a neighbor's family to eat while the husband was in the hospital and I also made a batch for my own family. I was amazed at how creamy this was. Everyone gave it rave reviews and it tasted even better reheated the next day. I also omitted the eggs but made a special effort to find the muenster cheese. I think it was worth the effort! This has now become my favorite mac 'n cheese recipe!

I use this recipe for Thanksgiving since it makes so much.  It is always an absolute hit. I am not one for using measurements when I cook, so I usually add additional cheese.  I think pepperjack is the key to making it original and different than just plain ole mac and cheese.

Good in small doses!  it's just so heavy, you can't really eat much...which is good because it's not exactly low cal!  I cooked some smoked kielbasa along with it--the dish needed some "kick", like some have said.  By the way, this makes more than six servings, I think! If you're going for an extremely cheesy dish, this will do!

Very tasty indeed!! Dropped the egg as suggested in the previous reviews, and doubled the cheese.  I will certainly make it again.  Probably add a spicy sausage or three.  Just for kicks.

This was ok, but not quite what we were looking for.  My boyfriend didn't quite like the processed cheese being in it.  Also, I didn't use Munster because I didn't have any and used colby instead.  Personally, I thought it tasted better reheated the next day.

This dish rocked! My 20 year old son came home from his construction job, called me on my cell and yelled "SWEEEET!". I added onions instead of sausage and used more mild cheddar instead of the Munster. At almost the end of cooking, I sprinked Italian cheese on top. Even my picky daughter ate two bowls!

My family of 4 ate the whole thing within 24 hrs.
I substituted medium cheddar cheese for the muenster cheese (just could not find it)

JRW gives it a 4-star; I give it a 3-star.  Somehow, mine didn't turn out very creamy.  The texture of the cheese sauce was a little odd, but I think it must have been chef error, not the recipe, as everyone else seems to love this one.

I found this recipe a little dry... too much macaroni and not enough cheese. I think I didn't quite follow the recipe as directed as I was missing short on the quantities of cheese needed. My fault. I also added a bread crumb topping. I mixed bread crumbs and butter together and then spread them over the macaroni before baking. Tasty. I will definitely try this one again, only the next time with more cheese.

VERY good macaroni and cheese!  I would suggest not buying two types of cheddar (not necessary) and being generous with the muenster or velveeta to make it extra creamy!

This past Thanksgiving a friend, who claimed to be "macaronied out", joined us for dinner.  After dinner was over he commented "wow, I was just tasting the macaroni and cheese to be polite, but I'm glad I did because that was the best macaroni and cheese I've ever tasted.  Thumbs up to a great recipe.  We'll definitely have it again.

Excellent, creamy very delicious.  Everyone absolutely loves this recipe.  The Muenster cheese give is a nice creamy texture.  The blend of cheeses is very nice.  The addition of Muenster intrigued my husband, and now he is a Muenster lover!  Will make again, and again.  Will be a holiday staple from now on!

If you're looking for Velveeta Shells and Cheese, don't look at this recipe.  If you're looking for a good Southern recipe for homemade Mac N Cheese your search stops here.  This was delicious!  We'll be having this again and again and again and again.  We loved this all will be making it many times in the future.

This was great, i made a few changes since I didn't have all the ingredients.  I used cream cheese instead of velveeta,--colby, cheddar,a little parmesan and evaporated milk instead of 1/2&1/2. The result was a yummy VERY cheesey meal for my picky kids.

I love mac and cheese so I really enjoyed this.  It makes a lot - we have leftovers for almost a week.  The good part was it tasted just as good (if not better) reheated so that was no problem.  The only change I made was using half the butter called for and putting a bread crumb crust on top.

Yum! Easy comfort food at its best. You can substitue cheeses if you want to vary the dish or jazz it up, but it's tasty the way it's written.

My family loves this macaroni and cheese.  The only change I make is that I use one egg because I'm not too fond of eggs.  This is the only macaroni and cheese I make!

This was very good but I think I left it in the oven too long, because it wasn't as creamy as I thought it should be.  However, my family loved it and I will be making this again!

I left out the eggs as others had suggested. It was very good the first day. I did think that warmed over the next day it was a little greasy. But all in all it was very good.

This recipe is SOOO good! I heated up the butter in a dutch oven, added cream (only used half at first) and then slowly added the cheeses...mixing constantly (added more cream if the cheeses got too thick). Next I added the macaroni and poured everything in a dish. It didn't even need eggs. Then I put an extra sprinkling of cheese and progresso italian style bread crumbs on top for crunchiness. Delish

I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I'm generally a good cook, and this turned out dry and bland with a nasty texture from the egg.  Still looking for the perfect mac and cheese.

I'm a mac and cheese fan from the beginning and this dish knocked my socks off.  I added all the cheese I had in the house to it and could feel my arteries clogging with every bite.  So good... Thanks.

this is very very good. i didn't have any sharp cheddar, but i'll use it next time for sure. I think I also use some of the mexican shredded cheese with hot pepper to give a little kick.

Very good, a bit too thick for me though. Would love to try different cheeses, but for a first time went well

This recipe is so wonderful.  My husband and I love it.  I made it once before, and am making it again tonight.  Nice, easy home-cooked meat.  Comfort food, as my husband says.

Kind of expensive for one side dish, but if you love mac and cheese, it really is good.
