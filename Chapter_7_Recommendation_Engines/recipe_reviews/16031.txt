Best truffle recipe!  I like to divide the chocolate mix into four even parts and add 1 Tbsp flavoring to each.  I've used almond and vanilla extracts; raspberry, orange, irish cream, whiskey and mint liqueurs; and cinnamon and orange oils. I've only heard rave reviews!

These are great. Easy, crowd-pleasing and very attractive and decadent looking.  Tips; divide the mixture into four parts and chill separately. They take a while to roll, and while you're making one batch, the rest of the mixture may get soft and sticky.  Also, chill in a shallow container so the mixture hardens more evenly (and faster).  I used ground pecans, cocoa and medium flaked unsweetened coconut.  My friends loved them and thought they had a dozen ingredients!

Yum and easy! Definately a keeper for holiday tins. BTW - check out Chocolate Truffles by Eagle Brand on this website...it is the same recipe, but outlines how to handle flavour variations.

These were so good and easy to make.  I added vanilla to half the chocolate mixture and Bailey's to the other and then rolled the truffles in chopped walnuts or powdered sugar.  One helpful hint: use a melon baller to scoop the chocolate out, it is so much easier and less messy. Also, do not put in the frezer, they stick to the pan.

the truffles were easy but were not very flavorful. I thought it tasted more like a dense fudge than truffles. I did find that microwaving the mixture for thirty seconds if it was too hard made it much easier to work with.

Really easy to do; the hardest part is just rolling all the balls.  Maybe a melon baller would work?  The people I gave them to were very impressed and said they were rich and delicious.  I rolled them in colored sugar until I ran out.  Then I rolled them in white sugar, which is perfect because it's always on hand and it looks like snowballs for Christmas.  Work quickly and don't handle a ball for too long or it will become soft.  Work with small batches and keep the rest in the fridge.

I would have to say these were fantastic. I read all the reviews before making and found them helpful. I did adapt the recipe. I made three flavors: Kahlua, Vanilla, and Cinnamon. The cinnamon were the biggest hit. In Order to make them more authentic truffles... I dipped them in a mixture of almond bark and chocolate ships which made for a nice hard outer shell. Very simple but more authentic.

The only problem with this recipe was the fact that i could not stop eating them. They were so addicting! i tried a variation with peppermint instead of the vanilla but they just weren't the same! stick to the original! i've also found you should not refrigerate it for too long before breaking them into balls as the dough gets very hard. If  this happens however, putting it into the microwave for a few seconds worked well for me. Thanks for the recipe!

I loved how easy these were, and they were a huge hit at the office.  I put may different coatings on mine: colored sugar, sprinkles, etc.  Next time I will add some raspberry flavor.

"Luscious"? If you're looking for a truffle that tastes as sumptuous as the ones you buy in a fancy confectioner's, you're going to be disappointed mightily. This tastes like, well...sweetened condensed milk combined with melted chocolate chips, mega watt, tastebud-numbing sweet. Not at all what I have come to expect a truffle to taste like. Truffles should be a celebration of perfect chocolate flavor, one that  melts lovingly and lingers on the tongue. Sure, these are easy. But easy is only good if the results are something you're proud to serve. Sorry to have to say I found this recipe to be disappointing.

I followed this recipe exactly, and they turned out to be (to us) little balls of fudgy sugar.  They were so sweet and rich we could barely finish one!  Not sure if that's what truffles are supposed to be, but I won't be making this again.

This recipe is actually how I used to make fudge, before I braved the more complicated methods. I do think this recipe makes fast, easy and tasty truffles that can be flavored any way you choose. Sometimes I just melt the chocolate and condensed milk in the microwave a minute or two, keeping an eye on it and stirring it, until melted and combined, add the vanilla (or whichever flavoring I'm using), and proceed with the recipe. For simple tastiness this recipe can't be beat! :)

Yum! These turned out great! Not quite as creamy as typical truffles but definatly a great lower fat version. They keep their shape nicely if left in the fridge, however keep them out of the freezer, mine developed crunchy lumps... not good!

These tasted pretty good, but they were more like fudge rolled into balls. Still very good though.

I have made these with my mom every Christmas for as long as I can remember. Although we use MINT extract, not vanilla. Also, to make it easier to roll into balls, I put shortening on my hands so the chocolate does not stick. These are sooo good and sooo addicting!! We also store them in the freezer when done and eat them right out of the freezer!! :)

This is a great, easy recipe. For those who like their truffles a little less sweet, try making one of the cups of chocolate baker's chocolate. I added some raspberry infused vodka. YUM!

I made 200 of these truffles for our wedding and WOW. My aunt considers herself THE truffle maker and she couldn’t believe that these weren’t her hard to make million step truffles. I used maple flavoring\extract…yum (make sure you use mapleine in the blue box, the others just have an alcohol flavor, not good.) I dipped each ball in chocolate flavored almond bark that I thinned slightly with a dab of shortening and then drizzled each with a bit of butterscotch almond bark. These were amazingly better than any truffle I could have bought and they looked great too! If you are trying to make these in the summer or when it’s humid it is a little tricky. You will need to freeze (not refrigerate) in small batches. Using a scoop is mandatory whatever time of year, takes the hard work out of rolling. I also found that they were not nearly as creamy when I used store brand milk. Happy Truffle Making!

Easy recipe and tasty too! After I rolled them I dipped them in melted chocolate. Half in white chocolate and the other in dark. Then I sprinkled crushed oreo cookies over the top. They were beautiful and divine! They looked like I spent a fortune at the candy store.

We used these for Christmas gifts for our neighbors and co-workers.  Rather than risk scorching, I used the microwave to do the melting.  Rolled them in cocoa powder  (we didn't add any flavorings).  They were very easy to make and everyone seemed to like them.  We'll definitely be using this recipe again!

These are so easy and good!  I used 60% cacao Ghirardelli chips to make them a little more dark chocolatey.  Three varieties from a double batch - (1) vanilla extract and crushed candy canes, rolled in crushed candy canes mixed with powdered sugar, (2) Bailey's Irish cream, rolled in cinnamon mixed with powdered sugar, (3) Skyy raspberry vodka, rolled in unsweetened cocoa powder.  I found that I could roll the balls not too long after being done melting it together, and did not chill 2-3 hours.

Made them for work and everyone loved them! I rolled some in sprinkles, cocoa, and others in confectionary sugar. Oh. I also poured some melted carmel candy on some. Instead of vanilla extract I used rum flavoring. Same amount. Thanks!

Very easy.  Sticky, but occasionally swiping stick butter on my hands helped with that.  I made two batches - one rolled in toasted coconut and the other in crushed candy canes.  I won a Christmas cookie contest with the candy cane ones!

These truffles are amazingly good considering the simplicity of the recipe. It was however a little challenging to initially break the chilled chocolate into chunks, but that was the result of chilling it for 12 hours instead of three.

These were pretty good. I like the recipes with whipping cream added to them a little better. I love sweetened condensed milk,(it would even make a tire taste good!) so I thought I'd give it a try. It is just a little too much added sweetness to the chocolate. I had my daycare kids make these and give them to thier parents for valentines day, and the parents thought they were great! I divided the chocolate and made 3 different flavors as suggested by others.  Great Idea! The best one was the one I added peanut butter to. I just winged it so I cant recall the amount, but those were tasty!

This is a great, but simple recipe!  My family has been using this recipe for almost 15 years. We heat it up in the microwave on half power--simple enough for kids to do with supervision and all in one dish! The neighbors, teachers, and grandmas would love them as they were personally made by the kids and given in home made containers! Some of our favorite toppings are powdered sugar, cocoa, crushed peppermint candy canes, and crushed walnuts or hazelnuts grown in our backyard!  Don't forget the little paper cups you can purchase at the store--cupcake papers just in bite size!

I was given this same recipe by a family friend.  It also suggested substituting the vanilla with orange liqeur but I didn't have any so I tried it with other flavor extracts and it is very versatile.  It is a great recipe.  The results are quite rich and I have a friend who wants nothing else but this whenever we go to their house for a party.  As far as what to roll them in, in 2006 I printed off the same recipe by Eagle Brand which suggested rolling the truffles in "finely chopped toasted nuts, flaked coconut, chocolate sprinkles, colored sprinkles, unsweetened cocoa powder, confectioners' sugar, or colored sugars".  I can no longer find that version on this site.  The only one I have tried that didn't turn out well was the confectioners' (powdered) sugar.

I love truffles and these were nice but not as "truffle-like" as I would have liked them to be. I did not make a lot of these. I actually made these to use up some homemade condensed milk and like other reviewers added a touch of my favourite liqueur to the mixture. These rolled up really easily and I rolled them into chocolate sprinkles. I decided to have one after an hour or so of rolling them and I have to say they are good but not what I expected exactly. The middle came out more like a soft caramel which admittedly tasted very nice. Nice and smooth and not too sweet (but then the recipe I used for the homemade condensed milk isn't as sweet as the store-bought kind) These were good, but it won't be my first go to recipe when I want truffles.

My 12 year old daughter and I made a batch of these and I brought them to the office Christmas party. Super easy and a huge hit. We used peppermint extract instead of vanilla. I'm going to make tons of these all Christmas.

Amazing!  I whipped these up last minute for a family gathering.  I, however, divided the batch into three sections, and used an entire tablespoon of vanilla in one third, whiskey in another, and a cherry chocolate liquor in the other.  I coated half of them in cocoa and the oher half in sprinkles.  They were a HUGE hit with every single guest.  I am dieting so I didn't try one ::sniff sniff:: but I trust everyone else that they were delicious!

this was really good. i used semi sweet nestle chocolate and melted it over the stove with 1 1/3 cups sugar. If you do that and want it to have little bumps in it add the sugar and chocolate at the same time and melt them together but if you prefer it smooth, microwave or melt chocolate over stove then add sugar. I rolled them in ground almonds with cinnomon and them some powdered sugar. I prefer the ones rolled in the almond mixture. These were great! thanks!

These taste great! I followed the recipe exactly, but I did divide it up into smaller bowls as suggested by others.It was a bit difficult to roll them into the balls, and I think using a melon baller would probably be best for this. I used colored sugar sprinkles, which didn't really come out too great. However, the colored sprinkles worked out great and they tasted like the candy Nonpareils. I love those!

i must not know what a truffle is supposed to taste like, because these just tasted like melted chocolate chips in a ball, to me! i agree with another reviewer - very fudgey.  i was going to give them as christmas gifts but i couldn't make them look very pretty - i tried rolling them in crushed pecans and also crushed candy canes but they just looked messy.  i have more to roll (makes a lot!) so i'll try again.  at the suggestion of some other reviewers, i divided into 4 parts:  kahlua in one (this was best), chambord in another, vanilla extract in 3rd and almond extract in 4th.  oh, also i thought that melting the chips in a double-boiler would be a good thing, but i ended up switching to a regular pot because it was taking waaaay too long!

These were the best truffles I have ever had! They were a huge hit at my Christmas Party, and my roommate won't stop eating them! They are so rich, and delicious. I recommend this recipe to everyone. If you make these, you will have to make them year round! Just try them, and you will see!!!

I liked this recipe but would like to have had a softer center to my truffle. To make different flavors, I divided the truffle mixture into three dry, heated bowls before adding the vanilla to make different flavors. I added peppermint extract to one, rum extract to another, and vanilla extract to the last one. Then I covered the formed balls in a mixture of milk chocolate chips and unsweetened dark chocolate melted together in a double boiler and used different colored sugar sprinkles to tell them apart. My fav was the peppermint one. I will probably make this recipe again, but I would add something to make the center a bit creamier, like butter or shortening.

I’m not sure if I did something wrong, or what happened. I followed the directions which were super simple, but they never firmed up. I chilled them in the bowl in the fridge for four hours and then in the freezer for an hour and a half and the mixture never became firm enough to mold into balls. I scooped them into balls anyways and put them back into the fridge and they never firmed up.

I added Hershey's coco powder to the sweet and condensed milk and it made the lower grade chocolate taste great! I microwed it and stirred every fifteen second after a initial minute. sets up well and is very much a base recipe. I'm glad I tried it. :)

Pretty good recipe; after reading other reviews that said it was too sweet, I decided to use about 7/8 of the can of sweetened condensed milk instead of the entire thing and add in cinnamon to the melted chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk. I also added 2 tbsp of vanilla extract (instead of just one) and I coated each of the truffles in a little bit of unsweetened cocoa powder as I was forming them.

This is the recipe I have used to make fudge for the last few years. I love the taste, but not real sure if it is really truffle.

These were really fun and easy to make! I really liked them and I would definitely make them again. I did, however, make them the opposite, using a white chocolate base and a dark chocolate drizzle.

I made the truffles, and they are perfect. What i did was roll them in coco powder and confectioners sugar, and they were gone within seconds.

Recipe was great, I covered the truffles in a chocolate coating, melted 4 tablespoons of wax with 1 bag of semi sweet and 1 bag of milk chocolates, dipped them in to make real truffles. Though with this recipe the inner part of the truffle was a little dryer than I would like, next time around I will add more sweetened condensed milk, maybe melt some butter to add to the vanilla and condensed milk, I'll let you know how it goes!

Not quite what I was looking for, but still AMAZING. I mean, come on, how can you go wrong with chocolate chips and sweetened condensed milk!?!? I don't think I have a melon baller, so I used the smallest cookie scoop thingie. Works great!!

I've made these before and I like them. But I'm still gonna call you out on the fact this is a recipe directly from the Eagle Brand Sweetened Condensed Milk Cookbook :)

this recipe was amazing! although i did make some changes...instead of using sweetened condensed milk, i used the regular unsweetened stuff...and may i recommend dark chocolate rather than milk chocolate, but thats just a personal preference....also, the vanilla really doesnt make much of a difference!
