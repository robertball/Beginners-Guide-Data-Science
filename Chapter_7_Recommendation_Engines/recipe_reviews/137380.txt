The recipe looked great. Unfortunately, I didn't have much luck. Maybe I didn't mix the flour/sugar/egg mixture enough?

Even after an hour of cooking, it was mushy on ithe inside but threatening burning on the outside.  Maybe a lower cooking temp would help this.  Way too squashy for me and my husband.

This is a great example of a different variety of kugel. Using flour as a binder is rather popular with more traditional Lithuanian recipes, as are kugels made with broccoli and potatoes. Using a starchy vegetable, matzoh meal and flour are all ways to skip using noodles in a kugel recipe. 

As for this one, I've never seen or heard of a 7"x 11" baking dish, so I used an 8"x8" dish, made sure that I placed the baking dish on a sheet pan for extra insulation and baked it @ 350F. I used a can of pumpkin pur√©e (not pumpkin pie filling!) as my squash, and covered it for the first 30 minutes of baking. 

No problem! The kids loved it, and they were all stoked to have 'pumpkin pie squares' to eat along with dinner.
