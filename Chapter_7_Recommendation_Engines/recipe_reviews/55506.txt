Hello! I created this recipe and I wanted to address the color concern.  My recipe actually only calls for 1/4 cup of diet cola.  I don't know why allrecipes.com changed the measurements when I posted this recipe.  Using less of the cola will fix the coloration problem, but it still will be enough to give the drink that "spiked" quality.  Actually, you could use diet lemon-lime soda too, but I feel the cola adds a little kick.  Just be sure that what ever you use, the diet soda has a non-aspartame sweetner.  Aspartame gives the drink a "diet" taste instead of a "spiked" taste.   -Matt

Good!  But the diet cola made this drink a funky color.  I tried to add food coloring, but it didn't help much.

Excellent! I had to make a non-alcoholic drink in a hurry for a good friend's boozy birthday bash. I made my own "limeade concentrate" from lime juice concentrate and corn syrup, but I followed the rest of the recipe exactly, even down to the Safeway-brand cola. This was delicious, lusty and limey - enjoyed by the teatotalers at the party. Thanks for the recipe & happy birthday LTH!

Made as directed. Kids seemed to like it more than us adults. That said it was a pretty good mocktail.

This was great! Very sweet, but balanced out with tartness and the slightly funny taste of the diet coke - which was perfect though! Next time I think I might try and substitute the coke for something else, but I liked it as it was.

This is a delicious beverage. It's great servied with mexican dishes. I've made it several times and found that I have to use more ice cubes than specified to get the slushy texture. However, I just noticed that the creator of this recipe posted that it's supposed to have 1/4 c. of diet cola, not 1 c. which I suspect will affect how many ice cubes are necessary.
