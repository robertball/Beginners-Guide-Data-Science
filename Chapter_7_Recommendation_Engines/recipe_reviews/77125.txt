I too agree this is a very good quick pork chop recipe.  My kids are allergic to dairy and I have never found a replacement for old fashioned Scalloped Potatoes.  I was skeptical but these are very good!  The kids liked them too.  The only thing I did different was to add and additonal cup of beef broth to the gravy to make more.  The recipe handled it just fine and I didn't need to add extra flour at all. Also, don't cut the potatoes too thin (as I did) or they come out a little mushy.  Cut maybe 1/4 inch thin.

This recipe turned out pretty good. But I did make some changes. I only used half an onion, thought that was plenty. I just sprinkled a pinch of  
thyme on each layer -also plenty...Instead of beef boullion and water, (allergic to MSG) I poured a cup of chicken broth over the top. 1/4 C. butter seemed like too much too. I dotted the layers with several dabs of   Smart Balance (butter substitute). I was already to make the gravy after I took the casserole out of the oven, but after removing pork and potatoes to serving dish, the dripping were already thick enough to pour on the chops.

We used beef broth instead of the bullion, and added 1/8 cup white wine, 1/8 tsp each minced garlic, oregano and ground red pepper.  After about 55 minutes in oven,we topped it with 1/4 cup French fried onions and 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese.  It was broiled till cheese was crispy to our tate, about 5 minutes.  I forgot to thicken the juices as it was getting late but I'll do that on my next attempt!  This was good!

I don't know why more people haven't tried this recipe--it's great.  I can't eat cheese, so the other scalloped potato and pork recipes don't work for me, but this was is perfect.  I scaled it back for two pork chops, and I used beef stock instead of the beef bouillon and water.  I took two pork chops out of the freezer and thawed them, and then my husband, who had packaged them for the freezer, told me that I had taken out turkey breasts or tenderloins.  But, I made the recipe anyway, and it is very good with turkey.  Next time I will make it with pork. The gravy was excellent! I served it with green beans and Irresistible Soda Bread--easy and nutritious meal.

Great idea to mix these two dishes, and I don't know why I've never thought about it before! I used pork tenderloin, and I cut it into medallions. I also omitted the thyme, and just put dabs of butter on each layer, I don't think it was anywhere near a quarter cup. No need to thicken the juice at the end either, and this was great for lunches the next day. Delicious, tender, and quick.

I am glad I tried this, the pork chops came out VERY tender and the gravy was good too.  Next time I will cut the amount of pepper way down, there was too much.  The only thing I changed was the gravy, I added salt to my taste and also added enough water to get the gravy to be the consistancy that I like.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great dish in no time! This was super easy to prep and the result was satisfying.    I needed to add more seasoning (garlic, salt, pepper) because it came out kind of bland for my taste.   I'm going to try this same cooking technique with other kinds of meats with the potatoes and onions.  Yummy!

I didn't use the flour. Used white wine instead of water, added a chopped red sweet pepper I had in the fridge and needed to use, also a couple of chopped green onions.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish.  It was easy to make, had good flavor, and the port chops turned out nice and juicy!

The only thing I would change next time is how the gravy is made.  I would mix the flour with a little of the drippings instead of regular water to prevent clumping, and I would slowly add it to the rest of the drippings until I got the consistency I wanted as adding all of the flour mixture made the gravy too thick for my taste.

My husband loved this. Usually any pork I make is overcooked. For this, I had a really big pork loin that I cut into 6 chops (the other half went in the freezer). I used my own homemade spice mix - not that big of a fan of thyme. Cut up the potatoes and onion in my food processor. Easy, delish and the chops were SOOO tender! I did skip the last part - I already had some store bought gravy - bad me, but so easy!

I knew 1 hour would produce overcooked chops, so I cut the time to 30mins. Even then, the internal temp was 180*.  I may try this recipe again, and check at 15mins.

Cooked perfectly, with no need to thicken the gravy. Even my little sister had two servings (her favorite "food" is Taco Bell), so I consider this a success!

I found this to be an ok meal.  The chops were done long before the potatoes though.  Far too much onion as well.

My family really enjoyed this dish.  The pork chops come out very tender and the potatoes are perfectly seasoned.  I think the dried thyme adds a wonderful dimension to the dish.  I have made this several times as written and has turned out great each time.  Thanks for sharing.

My family liked this dish, and I found it super easy to prepare.  The thyme flavor was very strong, but we like it here.  I did season my pork with salt, pepper, and garlic powder when browning but felt that no other changes were needed.

I loved this.  I did use bone-in pork chops, because that is what was thawed out.  I cooked a little longer.  I used Spike seasoning instead of thyme and added salt.  Loved the gravy!

This is good.  A bit bland.  I will try frying the chops in onion and garlic first and maybe adding some salt to the potatoes.

I definitely enjoyed this meal, though it did need some salt added. The gravy came out too thick, and wasn't very flavorful so I think next time I will just leave the juices in the pan. My boyfriend enjoyed the meal. I used pork chops on the bone instead of the boneless simply because that's all we had in the fridge.

I used 1 inch pork chops and some salt and substituted the seasonings with Mrs. Dash and IT WAS AWESOME!! I loved it and my boyfriend had fun helping make it. It was so easy. He just followed the directions it will definatly go into the recipe book I am giving him! So easy!

HINT: Do not sear pork chops to long can make them tuff.

I liked the recipe, like the other reviewers, because it was pretty low fat if you went light on the gravy AND it didn't call for cheese.  The recipe doesn't call for salt and it definetely needs salt - you always have to add salt to potatoes - they are much better that way.  My pork chops came out a bit tough.  But, I think next time I will try searing them a little longer and maybe try using pork chops with the bone because they are often more tender than the boneless.  Thanks for the great idea!

This turned out pretty good.  I'll admit that I haven't made scalloped potatoes in years...(probably close to five or so)...and the results weren't exactly promising last time...(potatoes were under done)...so with this, I wanted to make sure that THAT didn't happen again.  I changed a few things on the recipe, using this as a foundation more then anything else.  I didn't have pork, so I chopped up two large sized chicken breasts and browned them with garlic, butter, onion powder, garlic powder, cayenne, salt and pepper. I layered it according to the directions above, adding 1/2 a block of cream cheese in cubes between the potatoes and onions and meat...(you'll probably want to soften the cream cheese a bit first)...Then finished the second layer of potato and onion mix, putting the second half of the cheese on top of it, with an extra touch of garlic and onion powder sprinkled over top.  Instead of beef bullion, I used chicken.  Followed the baking time, then added a layer of sharp cheddar on top, baking uncovered for ten more minutes.  It came out remarkably well...(I was actually quite surprised myself)...the flavors mixed well and the chicken complemented the dish awesomely.  I think if I were to make it this way again, the only two things I'd change up a bit, is add Cajun or creole seasoning...(didn't have any tonight)...and maybe add some fresh squeezed lemon juice to the mix.

Not good and not bad!!  I read all of the reviews so I was prepared.  My potatoes cooked (yeah) and my 1+ inch boneless pork chops cooked (yeah).  It took 1 hour.  I thickened the sauce with Kitchen Bouquet.  Potatoes were very bland.  I did not use all of the Thyme but I don't think using all of it would be the answer.  The potatoes tasted like they were boiled.  Ugh.  I missed the crustiness of the milk and cheese.  I won't be making this again, although my husband would disagree.

This was really good and quick to put together!  My pork chops were a little tough, but that was probably my fault by over sauteeing them.  The potatoes and gravy for me stole the show.  I'm not a potato lover, so when I'm going back for seconds, that means it's spectacular.  I liked the tip to not cut the potatoes too thin, 1/4 inch is perfect.  And you can season this any way you like.  Yum!

So I basically followed the recipe except I did add a few things based on other reviews.  First, I used beef broth, second, I added one garlic clove to the dish, and thirdly I garlic salted and peppered the pork before browning.  The pork came out a little dry and bland...but that could have been because I cooked it for about 10 minutes longer as we are 5,000ft and the altitude usually makes things like potatoes cook longer.  The potatoes were done to perfection though, so I am glad I cooked them a little longer.  I did find the dish a little bland, even w/ the gravy and addition seasoning on my part.  I think that I may try and remove the pork and juice, then add a little panko flake to the top of the potatoes and onions and then sprinkle w/ some cheese, put back in the oven for 5-10 minutes and see how it turns out next time.

I really liked this dish.  Family is not fond of one dish meals so it wasn't a big hit.  But the flavors were really great.  When I make any kind of pork gravy I usually use 1/2 chicken 1/2 beef bouillon.

I had the pork chops and potatoes - just needed the recipe and picked this one.  It was a hit with the family becuase the pork chops weren't dried out.  I used a cup of broth instead of boullion.  I used Italian seasoning instead of just thyme.   It could have had a bit more flavor but I think I'll be making it again.  The potatoes were great.

The only reason this recipe got 4 stars is because I made a few changes.  I reduced the salt like others did and I also added tarragon, garlic, onion powder and used chicken broth instead of the beef bouillon cubes.  
The fam,ily loved it.  My boyfriend ate seconds and my friend who took it for lunch called to let me know that it was smashing.  She absolutely loved it.  It has been added to my recipe box and I promised my friend to always let her know when it is on the menu.

Thank you for this wonderful recipe.
The thyme is just right.  
I made it with golden mushroom soup, and medium-thicker potato slices, and it turned out great.

Very good!  The pork chops came out insanely tender.  I only made 3 pork chops and I would say that 45 minutes is a good cooking time.

These were okay. Not as much flavor as I had expected. I used the leftover potatoes and onions to make fried potatoes for breakfast the next day, though, and those were delicious! Everyone ate their dinner, but all except me smothered it with ketchup.

I definately will not be making this again.  The potatoes were ok, a nice herby change from the fatty cheese version.  But the meat while tender, was very bland. I used bone-in chops and a hefty amount of Mrs Dash according to another rater.  Never used Mrs Dash before, maybe thats the problem.  If I were to make again, I would brown the chops with garlic and some of the onions before putting them into the baking dish.

I loved this recipe!  I used thick bone-in pork chops so I needed to cook for an additional 15 minutes or so.  The pork was tender and the gravy was yummy!  I'm adding this to my rotation for sure.  Thanks!

Made this last night hoping my family would like it, and they LOVED IT! My 1 1/2 year old was actually pulling the entire pork chop off of the plate, because we couldn't cut it fast enough for him. Will be a "family favorite". T
Thanks for helping a picky eating family

A very nice evening meal that would have been even better if I hadn't ruined the gravy.  I cut the recipe down to two and well, it is hard to make "gravy for two".  Other than that we really enjoyed it.  The chops were nice and moist and the seasonings brought it all together nicely.  I took the cover off the last 10 minutes and it added a nice top to the onion and potatoes.

Quite good - cused the review that said add 1 cup of beef broth to the gravy juices, that worked well. Also must reiterate the review that says don't cut the potatoes too thin. They end up mushy.  I also used 1 cup of beef broth instead of bouillon cube and water. Really tasty meal tonight and will repeat often. Easy to put together and really easy to clean up too.

Excellent Recipe! Had it tonight for dinner and my boyfriend and I loved it! The sauce is just so delicious. I only baked my pork chops for 45 minutes and they turned out so moist and tender. I did add a few extra spices as I tend to do with recipes to make them a little my own and added some garlic powder that added an extra touch to the recipe itself. We will definitely be having it again! :)

I used beef broth as opposed to the boullion cube, added garlic (about 2 cloves, minced) along with salt and it was still bland.  The whole recipe was tasteless and I won't be making it again.

I am alone now that my son is off to college, and sometimes it's difficult to scale recipes down and have the flavor you want!
This recipe turned out well for me though. 
The only real change I made was to add just a little left over cream I had to the gravy. I let it cook down on the stovetop.
Very good recipe. Thanks so much for sharing it!

I did not enjoy this recipe at all.  For some reason, my pork chops came out like leather, the thyme was overpowering, and it was an overall, white mess.  Hopefully it was just me and the rest of you will enjoy this recipe - it did get some really good reviews, which is why I tried it.

This was delicious!  My toddler gobbled up everything on his plate and asked for more. My hubby (who is the picky eater in the house) actually liked this dish too.  And wouldn't mind if it's in our rotation.   I served it with some brocolli and it was a great compliment.  Thanks for this recipe!

Didn't like this recipe too much.  Family voted to not have again.  Something missing-not sure what.
