This banana bread was amazing!!!!  It was so moist with a crisper top.  I've tried quite a few banana bread recipes and usually go for the ones with high ratings and a lot of people that have tried it but I decided to try this one because it  sounded interesting.  I thinking creaming half the bananas with the sugar was a great idea.  The cinnamon and sugar on top also added a great flavor.  I split up the mixture and put it into 2 5x9 pans.  They made smaller loafs and I cooked it for 55 minutes total.  I did put in a teaspoon of cinnamon because I love it.  I did rotate halfway as well.  I will be using this as my future banana bread recipe... it was that good.

Tried this recipe today.  Oh my God is it good!  Nice touch to sprinkle cinnamon sugar over the top before baking.  Smelled SO good baking on the oven.  My teenagers asked me when they could have a piece even before it was done baking.  I baked it for an hour and 15 minutes like the recipe said, I think next time I will try taking it out 5 or 10 minutes before that as the top looked like it was starting to get too dark and the crust was a bit too hard for me.  Otherwise a GREAT recipe!

Best I've tried, and believe me, I've tried a bunch!!  I think the secret it the creaming of the two bananas with the sugar.  Really infuses the flavor.  Good going!  Did not need to tweek this one.

Okay first off let me start off by saying I've tried pretty much every carrot cake recipe known to man from this site and many others. I've never left a review because I'm usually just too lazy to be honest so this is a first for me. This recipe is AMAZING. Every time I've made banana bread there is always something that seems to be lacking. Too overdone on top, not enough banana flavor, not moist enough, it's never just been PERFECT. Well THIS is. I'm sitting here laughing because when I gave a piece to my husband to try after it was done I was literally jumping up and down saying YES! YES! FINALLY! That's how perfect it is. I know some of the other recipes on here may stand out due to their bazillion stars but trust and believe this is one serious underrated banana bread! TRY IT! You will NOT be disappointed!

This is seriously the worst banana bread recipe I have EVER made. It's so heavy, you could throw it at somebody's head, and they'd get a concussion. I am a very good baker, and I would NEVER make this again.

I only had three banana's but it worked great. Everyone loved it. I tried my homemade vanilla for the first time and doubled the recipe amount because we love vanilla. Don't know if that made any difference or not but this is an easy and simple delicious recipe. Highly recommended.

I prefer muffins instead of a loaf when I make banana bread when it will be eaten at home. It's easier to freeze muffins & pull out just what will be eaten. However, muffins tend to be drier even if I reduce the oven temp or the baking time. About 2 months ago I had 4 very ripe bananas & all of my recipes called for 3. Not wanting to throw away the extra banana I thought to search for a recipe that called for 4. I found this recipe & since the bread was going to a church function I made a loaf. Best darn banana bread I ever did eat.( Yep, I'm a Georgia girl.) Not sure if it is the extra banana the sour cream or both, but the moistness & texture was awesome. Of course I couldn't wait to make muffins & they turned out great. Right out of the oven they were slightly crisp & chewy on the outside & moist on the inside. When I take one out of the freezer I microwave it for 30 sec. Then put it in the toaster oven to crisp the outside.  By the way, I threw away all of my othe recipes.

I was super excited to give this recipe a shot, but it is definitely not what I was expecting. Made as instructed to ensure it came out with the same results. It is much too dense/heavy for my liking. Heavier would have been welcomed, but it has to have some fluff to it as well. I bake a lot, and don't think I would use this again as written. However, it DOES have terrific flavor to it, and it doesn't fall apart on you! Those are two things I did love about this recipe. I might talk to some others and see what I could do to tweak this recipe to try it again with better results, because it has a lot of potential. I would like it a whole lot better if it wasn't so flat & so heavy. It doesn't bake like a real loaf of bread, and needs something to help fluff it a bit and get it to raise up better (maybe baking soda and less egg?) because it didn't rise much at all when it baked. It does have great potential, with great flavor and no mess which I did love, but it just needs the fluff factor and it would be great! Also loved the idea of sugar & cinnamon sprinkled on top... great addition!

Love this recipe, I've used it several times. The only thing I add is a flour, Brown sugar, butter and cinnamon crumb topping that gives it a little something extra.

Made this recipe exactly as written (omitting the walnuts). I am not a baker, but this was easy! Smells great in the oven and the cinnamon sugar topping is perfect. The inside of the loaf is very moist but not doughy. I used a nonstick loaf pan (though I did still use cooking spray), and as another reviewer stated, I would probably take this out of the oven 5 to 10 minutes earlier next time. It wasn't burned, but definitely browner than it needed to be. Very, very good. Will most certainly make this again.

Yummy!!! I did not change a thing in the ingredients. I did however bake it at 350 for 1 hour and then 325 for 45 min because it was so brown and still not even close to being done after an hour. But it is so yummy! did not last even 24 hrs at my house. Very moist and just the right flavors

I make banana bread a lot but tried a new recipe because I had some sour cream I wanted to use up. This didn't turn out well for me. Baked it over an hour until toothpick came out clean but once it cooled the middle was just too doughy and heavy. Not undercooked just bad texture.

I never review recipes. Ever. But days after I made this recipe, I'm still so blown away as to how moist and flavorful the bread is that I felt compelled to do so. I haven't eaten, much less made banana bread from scratch in many, many years because I didn't like it: always too dense, dry, lacking. I opted for zucchini bread thinking that the banana just didn't carry the bread well enough. NO MORE! This bread is so delicious I can hardly stop eating it. I posted a photo of the last quarter section because I didn't think to take one earlier. I must admit that I didn't see the point of mashing half the bananas and blending the others; but NOW I get it. It's just perfect! I'm tempted to try this method when zucchini season arrives. Oh, and it doesn't even remotely resemble a brick, so I can only assume that the negative reviewer made it wrong or is some kind of bread nazi. ?? Thank you for sharing this amazing recipe that we are sure to use again and again!

The 1 hour and 15 minutes is deceiving!   No wonder one got rocks instead of muffins!
Just go with the "until bread is golden brown on top"
I made muffins; 30 minutes to golden brown.  One 5x9 inches loaf 40 minutes to golden top! in a regular, no-fancy kind of old oven....
The flavor was good.  The sour cream is the secret for a moist fluffy bread!

It came out flat and spongey. 
It seemed like A LOT of butter. Would love any advice.

It's delicious. I substituted 1/4 cup coconut oil for 1/4 cup of the butter, 1 cup coconut flour for half the flour plus 1/2 cup water, and substituted Splenda (sucralose) for the sugar except for the 2 tsp sprinkled on top with cinnamon . I doubled the recipe and made two loaves, and they were done in an hour and 15 minutes. I would have used whole wheat flour too except I was out. Those going sugar free could skip the sugar sprinkled on top.

UPDATED
I didn't realize I had made this before. I don't know what the heck happened, as I followed the recipe exactly and this time it had WAY too much butter in it. It's a greasy mess! 

Old Review
I was disappointed with this recipe. It turned out dry and flavorless. I followed the recipe except I added a little more cinnamon and vanilla extract. It was finished cooking in 45 mins. It would have burnt to a crisp if I had left it in for the time stated. Glad others had success  with theirs.

I made it according to the recipe, but I did omit the nuts.  It was a big hit at the family reunion.  It's a denser bread (not fluffy like many store bought processed foods) but we liked that quality.  It's moist, but not oily.  My other recipe requires more bananas and makes two loaves, so this is my new go-to recipe when I have fewer aging bananas on hand.  It came out of the pan easily, which I can't say for all banana breads I've ever made.

MAN!  I hate to be "one of those people" who changed things BUT I read reviews.  #1 thing I did was I switched out baking POWDER for baking SODA (yes, it made a difference).
I also cut back on the butter & sugar (I used BROWN sugar) and I switched out sour cream with whole milk Greek vanilla yogurt.
Sorry......I said I changed things!  I also cut the recipe in half as I live alone and used 2 MASHED bananas.   This is THE BEST and most simple banana bread I have EVER made and next time I would have no issue at all using sour cream but the rest I will keep it like I did it.   It's banana bread so it will have a certain amount of "dense" to it but it did raise as expected and it was not overly moist.......just right.  I hope this helps someone?  
Also, for those not able to bake a loaf of banana bread without it burning I will advise getting a Nesco cooker.  I have the smaller one and it holds 1 loaf pan perfectly and I have never had a burnt/underdone loaf of banana or ANY "sweet bread" while I have been using my Nesco.  Just a suggestion or if you have one it bakes perfect banana bread.

I just made this recipe and it is wonderful! For me...the recipe made 2 large loaves and I had a little left over to make 5 muffins! I have a double oven so was able to cook both at same time. I even accidentally left out both the salt and the cinnamon and it was still wonderful. My butter came lightly salted so guess that must have helped! ( cooked the extra muffins at same temp. for about 15 minutes until lightly brown in my convection top oven--was great!)

Made exactly as stated in recipe.  Did not rise at all.  Very dense as others have stated.  I will try the baking soda instead of baking powder next time just to see.  Taste was incredible, just not used to such a heavy banana bread.

Moist, dense, flavorful, awesome. This is the recipe you have been looking for. Adding the bananas in 2 parts makes a delicious difference as does the cinnamon sugar sprinkle on the top. I did however make a single recipe that was enough for 12 muffins as well as the loaf (albeit in a somewhat smaller loaf pan). I followed others advice and took it out 10-15 min early and wow. It barely made it a day on the counter. It's a keeper!

I just made this tonight and I love it! I like my breads moist and heavy including my pumpkin bread recipes. I am not a fan of the light airy "bread" type recipes. Thats why I always look up "sour cream" recipes. So if you don't like heavy moist breads then this is not the one for you. We just ate some warm out of the oven with a little peanut butter on it and it was delicious!!

Really, truly good.  The processing of the bananas plus sour cream makes it special.  Adding nuts/choco chips or coconut just boosts the flavor and texture.  I bake for about an hour in a glass pan.  It could go a bit longer as instructed, but I'm ok with a bit of squishy banana goodness in the middle. I save that piece for myself.

I made this recipe (omitting walnuts--blech) as 12 mini leaves in my square muffin muffin pan. They didn't last long at ALL. I liked how WHITE they baked up. I guess my bananas didn't stand a chance of going brown.

I made this following the exact ingredients and directions, it adequately cooked golden brown on the outside, clean fork upon inspection, but seems mushy in consistency, prefer other recipes I've tried from this site instead.

I tried many many banana bread recipes, none compare to this awesome awesome delicious recipe. I added a little more sour cream and used Pecans instead of walnuts (I didn't have any on hand). My whole family loved it. Oh so moist and the sugar and cinnamon added a special touch! I definitely will be making it again. gr8agent

My family loves banana bread and we are always searching for new recipes.  We have a few we always go back to and this will become one of them!  Super moist!  I see different reviews about cooking times.  I had it in the oven for about an hour.  I love cinnamon sugar, but I was unsure of it on the bread.  It was delicious and crunchy, and even a bit subtle.  I will probably also try the recipe without the topping, but it was nice and a bit different.
For the one reviewer who gave it one star, saying it was so heavy, I am not sure how they didn't get the right results - I am wondering if he/she skipped the step of beating the sugar & bananas together until they were light and fluffy.
Thanks, Grandma-Diane!

The whole family loved this banana bread.  It takes a bit more time to make than my usual banana bread, but the little bit of extra time is so well worth it.  This is very tasty and delicious.  I used almonds instead of walnuts, as that's what I had on hand.  I also only used 3 bananas as mine were very large.  I got a little worried that it would burn, so covered the loaf loosely with foil after about 50 minutes in the oven.  It smells wonderful when baking.  The cinnamon-sugar on top makes a really thoughtful touch that everyone noticed and enjoyed.  Total baking time took about 10 minutes less than recommended.  My oven does seem to run a bit fast for most recipes.  This will be my new go-to banana bread recipe and everyone cannot wait until I make it again!  Thank you for sharing this lovely recipe.

Fresh out of the oven, it tasted doughy, but then it set and it was delicious! The bread burns quickly so check on it while it is in the oven frequently.

I have made this recipe 3 times now, and my family LOVES it!  However, I have been using vanilla greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and I think it's the secret ingredient.  I had never made banana bread before this, but now I feel like a pro.

I made this last night and it came out great!  Some had indicated the cinnamon sugar mix on top ended up darkening the top quite a bit, so I used just cinnamon and it added a nice extra kick.  In lieu of nuts, I added mini chocolate chips.  Came out wonderful and incredibly moist, which you sometimes don't get in a banana bread (ironically).  Will definitely be making this again!

Just made this. Perfect for a snowy winter day. Had some frozen  bananas I wanted to use up. So moist and yummie with a bit of peanut butter spread on a warm slice. Next time I will add some cinnamon to the batter for a bit of extra zing. Definitely will be making this again.

yes loved this bread. Thank you for sharing this recipe qhich was different from the cakey more mild banana bread recipe we tried last time. Loved the denseness and  strong banana flavor. We used 1 teaspoon cinnamon but will use more next time.

Best Bananna Bread recipe ever! I split the batter into 2 small loaf pans. I put half the batter into pan sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon, then added the rest of the batter on top. I baked it at 350 for one hour. Perfection.

I followed the recipe as noted and it came out great.  This is the first time I have made banana bread and since I do not like ripe bananas, this was great!

I made these exactly as written except I baked them as muffins.  I baked them for 35 minutes and they were perfect. These are so banana forward and stayed so moist.  I will defiantly make this again!

Okay I’m am NOT a baker by any means, I love to cook but baking is not my friend, I saw this recipe and thought I would give it a try. OMG!!!! This bread was amazing so moist and delicious. One of my children does not like banana’s and he devoured almost all of it. So I went back and bought more bananas but I have another child who I have to hide them from just so they can get ripe enough to make again keeps eating them. I can’t wait to make this again.

GOOD.  Used 5 bananas and 1 cup sour cream.  Should check in 1 hour to see if it is done.  Used no sugar and cinnamon for topping.  Lance likes it.

I usually hate banana bread, but decided to try this recipe with my five year old. I had to call it banana cake to get him to help (hence icing the bread). This is the best banana bread recipe I’ve ever had! Left the mashed bananas slightly exposed when folding them in caramelizes the edges. Very tasty with a slight crunch.

I've made it several times and it's a family favorite. I mix all the bananas in at once, we don't like the big chunks of bananas.

The best I have ever had of banana bread! only change is that I only cooked it for 50 minutes. I used crisco vegetable shortening to grease the pan so it fell right out. I put the cinnamon sugar mix on 15 minutes before it was done because people said it gets to brown. 2 pans not 1, mine rose. I followed the directions for the ingredients 100%. It isn't too butter and I love the density. 5*s! I think this should be everyone's recipe for banana bread if you like a dense bread. Not too sweet, used large bananas. I figure it would be good to mention how big the bananas should be. Cream the sugar and bananas for as long as she says. Add the ingredients exactly how it says. Don't vary and don't forget to make sure the butter is cool, not hot. 
Amazing bread!  Also don't over mix it, just until it is mixed fully by HAND. Just fold in until mixed, again, don't over mix. That way it cooks correctly. I tapped it down 5x. It is not over buttery and I was worried about that since someone said it has too much butter. They must not have cooked it all of the way or didn't mix in the ingredients in order.  Do not use a mixer except to cream thesugar and bananas.

This banana bread was very good. Adding sour cream gave the bread a great texture. I would probably not add the cinnamon sugar on top but it was definitely a keeper.

I modified the recipe only slightly.  I thin sliced the bananas and heated them a couple minutes using the microwave on 30% since they were still yellow ripe and not soft.   Mashed them together and then split it half.  Added half to the blender with the sugar (3/4 cup) + sour cream + eggs + butter + a little maple syrup and honey (probably about 1/4 cup together).  Added that to the dry mixture and fork stirred before adding the rest of the mashed bananas and the vanilla.  Skipped the cinnamon.  Baked at 350 for 45 minutes using an ungreased nonstick 9x9 pan and it came out the pan perfect after just a couple minutes (was still warm).   Moist but dense.   Easy to cut into bite size pieces and doesn't crumble.   Would back on the sugar a little more if I made it this way again.   (honey/sryup is probably a little extra sweet compared to sugar)

I was a little short on sour cream and used vanilla yogurt as a substitute.   New family favorite.

I used some peaches from my bumper crop in the backyard, so this isn't a truly accurate rating - BUT I followed the recipe exactly otherwise, and it's a very flavorful bread.  I'll definitely be using it with bananas once the peaches are gone.

Amazing flavor though the texture was more like a cake.  I might adjust the recipe by replacing some of the flour with whole wheat flour.  I cut the butter back to 1/2 cup and it was still very rich.  I made it in 3 mini loaf pans  350 degrees for 40 minutes.  I will make this again!

Best banana bread I have ever made.Delicate banana flavour with a slight tang of sour cream topped with the sweetness of the cinnamon sugar crust.Great texture. I did add a shake of cinnamon to the flour mixture  and reduced the oven temp to 325 because I used a dark pan .

Baking Soda or Baking Powder?  I read some of the critical reviews and saw complaints of "heaviness" etc.  So I wondered if  Grandma Diane meant to call for baking soda instead of baking powder.  I took a gamble and used 1.5 teaspoons of baking soda instead of the 1.5 teaspoons of baking powder she called for.  As long as your bananas are very ripe, there is plenty of acid in them so you shouldn't have to use baking powder.  Although you certainly can use baking powder.  Anyway, the result was absolutely perfect.   It came out ever so slightly more dense than a cake and much lighter than a typical heavy bread.  In fact one might want to throw a glaze or frosting on top.  But I just ate a piece while it was still warm with a pat of butter and it was so lovely.  Very moist.  The only other changes I made were to use 1/2 tablespoon of vanilla because I like a lot of vanilla.  I added a half tablespoon of cinnamon to the batter as well. And I baked it in a buttered and floured Bundt pan at 350 degrees for 53 minutes.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  So delicious.

Because I did not have butter, I used 1/2 cup vegetable oil instead -- and it came out perfectly!  I also doubled the amount of  chopped walnuts (love that nut!).  I definitely will make it again and again.

The batter was dry and more like dough, and it only took an hour to cook. It isn't bad, per se; it's a nice, moist loaf, but ... it is bland and does not taste like bananas or anything in particular. I will look for a more conventional recipe.

I followed the recipe to a tee. Instead, I poured the mixture into  muffin tins. They're perfect and a hit with the entire family. Best banana bread ever-- bar none!

I have to say this is the best banana bread recipe that I have ever tried. The batter is really fluffy and light and not dense like most other breads that I have tried. The sour cream adds an excellent moisture to the bread.....another issue I have had with past recipes.....dry bread! Nobody wants that. I like that it is sweetened more with bananas over sugar. Other recipes I have used called for up to 3 cups of sugar!! This is a great mix and yes, I agree, the cinnamon sugar topping is a nice touch. Great recipe! I think I will be using this one going forward.

Made this tonight on a whim and love it. Added chopped walnuts and Reese chips in layers in the loaf and sprinkled the crumbs on top, along with the cinnamon&sugar. I also sprinkled a little cinnamon&sugar on the layers I made. Smells amazing, looks amazing. I don't have a bread pan so I used a small casserole dish, Which did not leave it a lot of room to expand - which I think caused the fractures on top. 

I only had 3 bananas, and it did taste good with just three. I can tell it would taste THAT MUCH BETTER if I had four. Next time, four bananas and I need to buy myself a bread pan

I made this today with a sick friend. It came out more like a banana pound cake, but still really yummy!  Maybe I mixed the bananas too long??

This is the BEST, but put it in TWO pans, it overflowed the first time I made it, turned out perfect when baked in two 5 x 9 loaf pans.

This bread ended up looking strange because the sides rose up like a box around the top, but the bread was very good tasting.  I thought it might cook over the top of the 9x5 inch bread pan because it was almost to the top when I poured in the batter, and I did not use the optional nuts either.  However, it did not.  I ate those crispy edge corners off while it was still warm and the bread was delicious. I tried this recipe because it was different than most other recipes with using melted better and a cinnamon sugar sprinkled top.  I can't wait to taste it when it cools completely.  I think this recipe will be a keeper.

this recipe is moist and delicious and easy to make.  i made it exactly to the recipe, turned out great.  i had to put it back in the oven after an hour and fifteen minutes, as it wasn't quite done.  and i forgot to rotate it halfway through baking time.  the only problem i had was the bottom crust got a little burnt, i think maybe because the rack was too low in the oven.  will try it one rack up next time.  i'll make this again for sure.

I don't know how to edit my review.  I wanted to add - the absolutely most important key to making good banana bread is to use really ripe bananas, the riper the better! :)

I've made this banana bread many times and it's the best that I have ever had. Often share it with my next door neighbors and they love it! I think adding sour cream makes a difference and the cinnamon sugar mixture that you sprinkle on top, adds an extra touch of goodness!  I will give this recipe a 5 star rating for sure!

I suggest adding the sugar and cinnamon topping with a little bit of butter about half an hour before it's done.  Mine burnt slightly.

My usual standby recipe is Banana Sour Cream Bread but yesterday I got a little crazy and thought I'd give this a try.  After doing so I think I'll stick with my original recipe choice.  This seemed less dense, almost leaning towards cake-like, which is not what I'm going for in a quick bread.  I also thought the banana flavor was lacking but that may develop more over time.  The loaves did bake up very pretty and were quite large with that beautiful cracked dome that we all look for.  I may give it another go by doubling the recipe and trying it out in a tube pan to see if we'd like it better that way.  Maybe with a glaze of some sort....

Oh my . . . this bread is delicious!  I usually make the same banana bread recipe all of the time, but thought I'd venture out and try something a little different.  The addition of sour cream in this one sure does add to the moistness of this bread.  My daughter has been bugging me to make banana bread for a few weeks now.  She's going to be one happy camper when she gets home from school today, that's for sure!  This is one for the recipe box!  Thanks Grandma Diane!
