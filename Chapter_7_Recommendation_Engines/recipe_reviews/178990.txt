I use a very similar recipe, but I like to add a little rosemarry to taste. it also makes my house smell great, and the looks on people's faces when they come home to it is wonderful to me.

First the breasts at my local grocer are super thick so I cut them in half horizontally then I split the chicken into two batches: one made exactly like the recipe and the other I added Mrs. Dash garlic and herb seasoning (about 1/2 tsp each halved breast).  The ones with Mrs. Dash seasoning tasted so much...well actually tasted!  The ones in broth only were moist but not much flavor.  I served with grilled asparagus and brown rice.
