Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!!! Instead of using the 2 crusts I used a 13x9 and made my own graham cracker crust with 2 cups graham cracker crumbs and 1/4 cup melted butter. I pressed it on the bottom of the pan and baked at 350 for 15 min. Then I let it cool until room temp. It turned out great and I got rave reviews. Will definitely make again!

I did modify this recipe quite a bit, but kept the principle of the dessert the same.  After seeing the reviews and wonderful pictures, I decided to make this today.  When I saw that it had coconut and pecans, I pretty much figured I would be the ONLY one eating this (no one else likes the two), and that would be a problem.  So I started thinking what I could do instead.  I started with a chocolate crumb crust instead of graham.  I made the cream cheese filling as directed.  After pouring 1/2 in the pan, I sprinkled the filling with more chocolate crumbs, and drizzled with hot fudge instead of caramel.  Then put the rest of the filling in and topped with mini chocolate chips and more hot fudge drizzle.  I hope that this gives people some ideas of things they can also do.  I think that the filling is the main part of the recipe and people can use their imagination to layer whatever their family likes.  I made this in a 10 inch springform pan, and needless to say, I am not the only one eating this one.  It's outrageous and I will continue to make and come up with new flavor combinations!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I put this in a 12" springform pan (sprayed with Pam) with a graham cracker crust made with 1 1/2 c. graham crackers, 1/3 c. sugar and 6 T. butter(melted). Make 10 min. @ 350 degrees and cool completely. Then layer the cream cheese mixture,caramel,coconut and pecans mixture, as recipe describes. It fits perfectly in the pan.

I have been making this pie for almost 20 years now and it is always a huge hit.  However, I do have some tips for people who have had problems with it.  I use a frozen regular pie shell (comes in package of 2), defrost and pre-bake as directed.  For the coconut, butter and pecan mixture I cook mine on low heat for at least 15-20 minutes to get the coconut really crunchy (but not burned) which makes a HUGE difference in the texture of the pie. For the caramel sauce, I use Smuckers but I slightly heat the jar in the microwave just enough to get it to drizzling consistency, about 10-15 seconds on high.  When ready to freeze, I use waxed paper over pie and then wrap top only with foil.  I always keep a spare one in my freezer for unexpected company or for when I don't feel like making a dessert (which isn't very often as I love to bake).  Hope this helps!

Moo. I used a chocolate cookie crust and put chocolate chips and a little chocolate drizzle on the plate in addition to the caramel and pecans. One guest asked if it was rude to lick the plate. Easy and good!

I have made this for years & everyone RAVES about it. Always a huge hit. The family is disappointed if I don't make it for Thanksgiving. Where I found it, it was actually called "Oh gawd Pie", )because the first bite everyone says "oh gawd".) (in the South :).) I don't layer it, I just dump all of the filling in the crust & top with the coconut/pecans & caramel. And I don't use a graham cracker crust. It's a little harder but much better with a pecan/flour crust: Crust: Preheat oven to 350. Mix 1 1/2 C flour + 1 C finely chopped pecans + 1 stick melted butter together until combined & all moistened. Press evenly into 2 – 8” pie pans, or 1 - 9x13 baking pan, (sprayed with cooking spray). Bake @ 350 for about 10-15 min, or until edges start to brown. Set aside to cool. MUST try it. You won't be sorry! (except it's addictive!)

This pie is great. I did use a lighter version of cream cheese, which I think is awesome, since it made the pie a little softer and could be eaten right from the freezer with no thawing. Next time I may try to add toffee bits to give a little more crunch in the middle layer, but it came out wonderful the way it is.

This is a delicious pie that is so quick and easy to make.  I got the recipe from a friend a few years ago and was going to put it on this sight but saw that it was already here.  Every time I serve this, I am asked to share the recipe.  It is a great "make ahead-of-time" dessert.  You won't be sorry you tried this one!

Good. Like a cheesecake without all the work. My family was a bit unsure if they would like this but they really did. We needed to keep it in the fridge for about a half hour to soften enough to cut well.

Good but it's so super sweet.  It was kind of a pain to drizzle the caramel evenly, I think next time I'll just mix it right in to the Cool Whip mixture.  I'll also use a sugarless graham crust and maybe a lighter Cool Whip or condensed milk.  Good pie though, just really sweet.  I let the pie sit at room temp. for 1/2 hour before slicing.

As my 10 year old would say----"This pie was the Bomb!"   It was delicious and oh so easy.  I had to make dessert for a thing at church.  I took one pie and put the other one in the freezer and forgot about it.  I can't believe that pie sat in my freezer without being eaten!!!  That will never happen again.  I will be making this again---definitely!

Very good but very sweet.  My suggestion, do not use light wipped cream, it will be too runny and will not freeze well.

WOW! This pie is amazing! It tastes like a mix of a cheesecake and an ice cream cake with yummy caramel oozing out of everywhere, and the added crunch of the coconut/pecan topping is just perfection. I made it in a 12" round springform pan as per another reviewer's suggestion, and it fit perfectly! I don't know if I will be making it again for myself any time soon due to the outrageous calorie/fat content, but I will definitely make it for any get-togethers or events and pass it off to other people! Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

Wow, wow, wow! I couldn't believe how yummy this pie was! I made mine from homemade by using a homemade graham cracker crust with cinnamon, homemade caramel sauce, and homemade whipped cream. Also, if you make this recipe in a springform pan you are able to make ONE pie that will be a little taller rather than two pies in pie pans. Other than subbing homemade ingredients for store bought, I followed the recipe exactly as is and it was fantastic!

I just made this for the inlaws the other night. Instead of making a whole pie, I made them in muffin cups. It ended up making just about 36. Because they are so small, I didnt layer the caramel, just drizzled it over the top. They are very sweet, and the hubby and I decided that without the caramel they tasted just like ice cream sandwiches. In such a small size, they take very little time to thaw, so pull them out when you are ready to serve, not half hour before or you will have little puddles!

VERY delicious-  I made it for a family function and 11 out of 11 people just raved about it.  I did add a bit of dry butterscotch pudding to the mixture before layering.

Absolutely delicious!! Don't know why, but I added a tsp of vanilla to the cream cheese mixture- tasted great. This may be obvious, but make sure you FREEZE this. I froze it, then left it in the fridge for couple of hours before I served it, and it turned out to be too soft...people loved it all the same! Perfect for a hot day!

Served this at our Easter gathering.  Rave reviews!  I turned it into a 9x13 with a graham cracker crust of 2 c. crumbs mixed with 1/4 c. melted butter, baked at 350 for 15 min then cooled to room temp.  I also cooked the coconut mixture on low for about 30 minutes, stirring constant, as another reviewer had suggested.  The coconut and pecans were perfectly browned and crunchy.  One of my guests suggested chocolate topping next time, either alone or in combo with the caramel.  I think that will take this dessert to the next level of awesomeness!  This is a keeper!!!!

Wonderful! I read all the reviews and decided to go with homemade Graham Cracker Crust I (from this site and it's great) and used my 10" springform pan. I also made rum caramel sauce because I had everything on hand to make it. This is excellent. We did not think it was too sweet. Dessert is supposed to be sweet! Everyone raved about this. The topping is just too good! I'm going to try it with chocolate and peanuts, too. One note, my condensed milk and cream cheese never got fluffy as I whipped it, just very creamy. I only have a hand mixer, maybe that's why. Don't let that throw you if it doesn't get fluffy. A keeper and repeater!

This was a delicious summer dessert!  I made one like the recipe said and made the second different to change things up.  Instead of just layering with caramel in the middle I put a layer of heath bar pieces (already in pieces in the baking section of the store) and chocolate syrup and caramel throughout the middle.  I also put that same sequence on the top with pecans.  It turned out like a turtle dream pie!  Everyone preferred this one compared to the original.  Since we only had a small dinner party I just cut pieces from the frozen pie and put them on plates to thaw instead of thawing the whole pie.  It was much faster (about 5-8 minutes) and we were able to put the rest of the pie back in the freezer.  I would recommend this to anyone for a quick easy dessert.

Everyone loved this but I used only a drizzle of the caramel over the layers the second time I made it which was just the right amount. Any more made it too sweet

This was absolutely DELICIOUS and super easy to make.  I used the standard recipe which only called for 1 crust but really I had enough for 2.  I had a graham cracker crust on hand but made the other one with an oreo crust.

Really good and super easy!  I bake a lot and was skeptical but people flip out over this pie, it's kind of crazy.  My only issue with it (which actually isn't a bad thing) is that I found for the 9 inch pie plates, there was just too much filling.  To that end, when I make it with the 9 inch crusts, I also make some mini individual pies OR I use 2 deep dish plates.  I currently have 3 "orders" for this pie, so there you go.  *One addition I sometimes make to this recipe is adding some Kahlua to the cream cheese mixture -- yum.

An easy way to add the caramel is to use Smuckers Sundae Syrup.  You can squirt it out right where you want it!

This is a great base recipe. I'm not a fan of nuts so instead of the pecan/coconut mixtures, I chopped up Twix bars and topped the pie with that.

This is very good but I used more cream cheese and a little less of the whipped topping.

Good. However I used whipping cream instead of cool whip. I made my own pie shell with oreo cookies and butter.

I've made this recipe twice and both times it was gobbled up at home and at work. I followed the directions given. This is very easy to make and is cool, rich and delicious. I will make this whenever I need an easy, no cook dessert. Thanks for sharing!

We loved this!! I tried to lighten this up... then added chocolate chips. Go figure! I made it in a spring form pan, it fits and layers perfectly. I started by making my own graham cracker crust- recipe off the box. I used low fat cream cheese, low fat sweet condensed milk and fat free cool whip. I did not miss a thing with the lower calories!! I didn't have enough pecans, so used up all remaining nuts I had, peanuts and walnuts. I did add chocolate semi-sweet chips to the middle layer and topping, delicious and a nice crunch! I didn't use the whole jar of carmel sauce, it just seemed like way to much, so I eye-balled it to my liking. My husband and I both loved it! Weill definitely make again!

FANTASTIC!!  I made this in a springform pan and made my own thick graham cracker crust.  For one side of the pie I sprinkled mini chocolate chips atop each layer, to give it a "turtle" character.  Hard to say which side was better because they were both wonderful, and the pie was totally gobbled up by my family on Easter Sunday.  The only change I made was using light caramel syrup with Splenda (Smucker's) and light sweetened condensed milk.  You couldn't tell the difference at all.  Wonderful and unique dessert--thanks Karen!

I do not care for coconut or pecans. So I made my own version of this and it was incredible. I replaced the coconut with white chocolate shavings and dark chocolate shavings. I replaced the pecans with chopped macademia nuts and chopped dehydrated banana chips. Saute the the macademias and banana chips in butter and do not melt the chocolate shavings.
For those of you like me who don't like either or both coconuts or pecans...give this a try by substituting one or both. It is mmmm mmmm good.

I made this for the 4th of July, and it was pretty darn good on a hot summer day.  Definitely decadent and very rich - everyone enjoyed it although some couldn't finish their piece it was so rich.  I made one 9x13 instead of two pies.  I also made my own graham cracker crust by using 2 C graham crumbs, 1 stick of butter, and 1/3 C sugar.  I would do it this way again, just because it seems easier to me than making two pies - easy to transport and serve.  Also, be careful when toasting the pecans and coconut.  I was distracted by my three-year old and burnt the first batch, and had to start over (not unusual for me).  Like another reviewer said, one of the guests suggested chocolate in addition to the caramel.  Yum.

This was fabulous! Everyone raved and raved about it! The only change I made was to omit the coconut, as nobody in family likes it. I don't normally like using whipped topping, I almost always substitute heavy cream I have whipped, but this was good! Will make again!

This recipe was awesome! I made it for my family for Thanksgiving and it was a hit. I sprinkled toffee bits on top which made it even better. I would suggest making it in a 9x13 pan instead of as a pie.

This one is a to die for winner.  I made a minor adjustment and added 1/2 cup sour cream to the sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese.  It was just a little too sweet at that point for me.  It was absolutely delicious.  Not sure the second pie will make it for a party next weekend.  My husband is hesitant to share.

Instead of making two pies though I used a 10 inch spring form pan and made one, I didn't cut down the recipe at all it all fit in the one.

This pie was soooooo good. My husband raved about it, he thinks it should get some kind of award! Usually when there is one piece of something left he always insists that I have it. Not with this pie! He wanted as much as he could get. We took the second pie to my sister's house when my parents were visiting and they all really liked it too. I have just sent them the recipe. 
I used low fat cream cheese and half the butter. 
In one word: Scrumptious!
11/19/2008  I am updating my review: I have now made this pie using peanuts and using walnuts depending on who I was making it for. (Peanuts is my preference.) It is delicious no matter which nuts you use. Everyone LOVES it. It is very rich and creamy. I do use fat-free caramel and light whipped cream and low fat cream cheese.

Delish!!! Now, I didn't have 12 hours so I made a modification that worked out PERFECTLY. I followed the recipe but poured only half of the condensed milk in the bowl. Then I mixed one packet of unflavored gelatin with 1/4 cup of water. I heated it for 30 seconds in the microwave. Then tempered it by pouring it into the half-full can of condensed milk, stirring it up, and then mixed it with the condensed milk and cream cheese in the bowl. I folded in two tubs of fat free cream cheese and followed the rest of the recipe as called for. Because of the gelatin, I only needed to put it in the freezer for a couple of hours and the pies keep well in the refrigerator. No need to keep them in the freezer. So yummy. Thanks for sharing!!!

My husband loves this dessert.  I make a homemade graham cracker crust from this site & use a 13x9 in pan instead of making 2 pies.  Notes for next time - I don't think this needs 6 tbsp of butter to toast the nuts & coconut (they are just soaking wet & it ends up super greasy).  I would try just 3 tbsp (maybe even less?) of COCONUT OIL next time & in my biggest skillet (so can spread out more).  I also add a bit of almond & coconut extracts to the filling to give it a little flavor.

Light and delicious!! 
I used an oatmeal and almond meal crust, made the wiped cream by whipping heavy cream, then folding in the cream cheese/condensed milk mixture ( I only used half of the condensed milk that the recipe calls for) abd it was sweet enough, if you have time making your own whipped cream taste waaay better

I didn't use butter to toast the pecans and coconut, since the coconut has natural oils it toasts and browns just fine itself without having to add butter.  ( now you can eat way more without feeling I just ate too much , bad stuff guilt) the coconut shreds will turn crispy and Brown! Just takes longer so be patient! 

I also drizzled a little  caramel on the crust before putting the whipped cream mix, to add a layer of flavor. 

save some toasted coconut and pecan mixture for later to sprinkle on top of the pie just before you serve. So it's still super crunchy. ( When you put the toasted coconuts along with the whipped cream and freeze it, the crunchyness kinda goes away. )

Awesome! I use low fat cream cheese and low fat whipping cream. Next time I'll try low- or non-fat sweetened condensed milk. Also, another easy way to cut a few calories without cutting taste is to toast the coconut and pecans without the butter. I do mine in the toaster oven, and it's perfect! No need to use 6 T of butter!

I normally wouldn't make something like this as I am more of a chocolate person over coconut and walnuts, but I made it for my moms birthday. She loved it and I must say I also have a new favorite desert. Trust me you won't miss the chocolate this is super rich without it. Since this recipe made two pies I kept the other one in the freezier for about two weeks, it was still really good but not as airy thought out, just something to consider but I will definitely be making this again, again, and again.

Try THIS TRY THIS NOW!!!!!! This is the most best caramel pie you'll ever taste! Some reveiwers think it has too much sugar, but if you have a sweet tooth like me you will love it!!!! Even if you dont like as much sugar... you like it a lot still if you use: normal condesed milk (not sweetened) and  not as much caramel topping.... Bona Petit'!

I'm eating this right now. It is sooooo good. I have made numerous of these pies since I added the recipe to my recipe box on July 23rd. Everyone in my family loves this pie. I made it for my Grandma's birthday, and she loved it so much she cried. The recipe doesn't tell you to add coconut and pecan to the middle layer, but I strongly suggest that you do. It makes it that much better.

It is hard to believe something as awesome as this came from my two hands.  This is just decadent!  I made the recipe as written, with the exception of just a few more calories (what the heck) by adding a small amount of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips in the middle and on top.

Never make desert, but the Adult kids were in town and this was a huge hit!  Love the crunchy nuts/coconut with the creamy consistency.  Note, if you want to cut this recipe in 1/2 it doesn't calculate.  Made a tasty pancake topping!

I've been making this pie for 20 years, originally got the recipe from a lady in Houma, LA. I've always used the Pillsbury refrigerated pie sheets baking for the prescribed time before filling. I will have to try with the graham cracker crust, just a little concerned it might be too sweet.  Once you make this pie it will be constantly requested by your family. It's the best!

This dessert was a huge hit with my family!  I sprinkled a few mini semi-sweet chocolate chips between the layers and wish I added even more. Great "company" dessert.

OMG!  This pie was phenomenal!  It is very sweet though, but everyone in my family was OK with that.  I personally don't think that you need to add any candy bar bits or more caramel, because it is already so sweet.  Can't go wrong with this one.  Enjoy!

Oh my goodness! This was amazing! I made it exactly like the recipe said and everyone LOVED it! I think I went a little light on the caramel, so I'll use a little more next time, but it was absolutly wonderful. The perfect summer dessert!

I made this exactly as written and it was delicious!!  Everyone loved it and I had requests to take home the extra one in the freezer.  The only thing I may change next time is to do more layers of caramel then I did the first time.

This pie is outstanding! I make it in a casserole dish with Graham Cracker Crust I--the one with cinnamon in it. Everyone who I have made it for has L-O-V-E-D it.

EXCELLENT! My company didn't like coconut but they ate one piece and asked for another. I also drizzled chocolate over the caramel in the middle and on the top of it. I made my own graham cracker crust and put in a 9x13 pan. Very good. Highly recommend.

Very good, very rich. I liked that is frozen. It's delicious. I made it exactly as written, and brought one to my daughter's for Thanksgiving, and everyone loved it. I have another one in the freezer to take out at Christmas! I also thought if you want to make this without the pecans you could top it off w/ crushed Heathbar candy.

What a wonderful dessert!  I did end up changing it, unintentionally.  I made my own graham crust, enough for a 9x13 pan.  I used only 8 oz. of light whipped topping, because although I thought I had more, that was all I had. After reading that it was very sweet I decided to use only half of the caramel topping.  I was very hesitant of the pecan and coconut topping, (I detest coconut), but browning it in the butter makes it delicious!  It is a perfect pairing with the sweet filling.  I will be using this recipe again, but will make it the way I ended up making it.

Absolutely amazing - my husband texted me mid-dessert to tell me that everyone was flipping over this pie and that it was a "hugeeeee hit!". Make sure to get the bigger, 9" pie crusts, or you will WAY overfill!

Oh. . this was so good. It was simple to prepare, but was a hit. It would probably be nice with a bit of chocolate. I think next time I will try to mix some chocolate sauce or cocoa into the cream cheese/whipped cream mixture.

We loved this! Great flavor and the coconut/pecan/butter mixture is delish. I added a crushed Skor bar & 4 oz shaved German chocolate because I was craving chocolate. I'll definitely make this again--I can see infinite possibilities, but it's a keeper as is!

This is the BEST PIE I have ever ate.  My family loved it.  I can't wait to make it for my Home church group!  I used chocolate fudge topping only because I didn't have any caramel in the house. It was GREAT!  The best pie you ever want to eat.  It taste a lot like Ice Cream Pie.

Very similar to the "Frozen Butter Brickle Delight" recipe on this site, just has coconut instead of the "brickle".  Nice twist.

Every time I make this pie, it's a HIT!!!  :)  One time I had to substitute white chocolate (I melted the white chocolate in a little Half and Half, along with a vanilla bean and it's seeds), delicious!  Same thing with regular chocolate and a chocolate cookie pie crust.  Also, look for a brand of whipped topping that comes in "French Vanilla" --- MUCH better tasting.  HTH  :)

OMG! This is absolutely delicious! Made it the first time for Christmas and have been making it ever since. It has become my boyfriends number 1 favorite! And has now been added to the request list for family pitch ins! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have a hard time with the graham cracker crust sticking. Kinda hard to serve without tearing it up. Also takes a while to freeze to a good serving consistency. Have made both the pie version and a 9 x 13 version. Both are great! Never ANY to go to waste! Highly recommend!

This was a little too sweet for us. I think it was the sweetened condensed milk that was too much for us. I will try this again skipping the condensed milk. I really liked the coconut/pecan topping. Plus it had a marshmellow taste and consistancy that was unexpected and too sweet.

Wooooweeeee!!!!!!  I can not believe I made something that tastes this good!  I made it for a get-together with the inlaws.  Shared with my neighbors and even took some to work.  EVERYONE enjoyed it.  I would rate it more stars if I could.  Thanks for a great easy recipe.

Sweet, but excellent. The topping is to die for. I made my own crust in a 13X9 pan and followed the rest of the directions exactly.

Everyone loved this pie.  We had a group test kitchen day at my home and everyone brought pie recipes to try.  We made pies all day and ended up with 12 pies.  This pie was the most unique tasting pie and was the most requested recipe.  I didn't taste anything like I expected.  Everyone said it tasted like....   You have to try it for yourself.  I'm not going to tell you what they compared it to, but it was very delicious.

I didn't actually taste the finished product, as this was made for my husband's office potluck at the last minute, but the filling was very tasty. My husband said that his entire office was raving about the pie and it was the only dessert entirely gone! I will definitely have to make this again so I can have a taste.

This pie was far too sweet. I was disappointed as it was so overwhelmingly sweet it was hard to eat more than a few bites. The rest of my family agreed, so it wasn't just me. Next time, I will definitely use less caramel and possibly less sweetened condensed milk. Good basic idea though.

I made this in a 9" X 13" pan, using 2 cups of gluten free graham cracker crumbs (which I made myself), 1/4 cup of melted butter & 2 Tbsp. of sugar.  I used a 1 litre container of cool whip, as we don't have 16 oz. size in Canada.  Over the first layer of the cream cheese mixture, I sprinkled 2 crushed up score bars and mini chocolate chips, drizzling caramel ice cream topping over the top.  Repeated the layers.  I made this for a family gathering this weekend, but had to try a tiny piece before they all get here.  AMAZING!!!!!

OMG this is truly delicious!! and you can freeze it for weeks or months. Instead of using graham cracker as crust, I used frozen prepared pie. it tastes like very creamy ice cream. I used fat free whipped cream and it tastes just as good! coconut is the key, make sure you have it well toasted on the pan. toast it slow and it will stay crispy for a very long time.

Wow! So glad I finally made this because the cream cheese mixture taste like the haagen-dazs dulce de leche caramel bars which I really love. Now, I feel like making bars out of it lol. And of course the coconut/pecans are yummy, too. I didn't have any frozen whipped topping but I did have cream, so I just went ahead and whipped it until fluffy....followed the rest.

This pie was awesome. I did have a problem with the sweetened condensed milk and cream cheese getting fluffy. I have no idea what I did wrong. It mixed in my blender for 15 minutes and still didn't fluff up.

I thought this was ok. It was WAY to sweet.  Next time I would use less evaporated milk and maybe even a layer of Penut butter.  The pecans and coconut were great.

This was so good!  I could have doubled the coconut/pecan mix (same amount of butter) and been happier.  I also wish that I would have put a layer of the coconut/pecan mix between the 2 layers of cream cheese/carmel layer.  The flavor would not have been better, just more of the stuff that makes the pie great!  Thanks for the recipe.

This had to be the BEST "pie" dessert I've ever made!  And SO easy too!  I used a lower cal caramel and was still awsome!  I will try this again with low fat/low cal ingredients and see if it comes anywhere near the regular version.

So easy, stays great in the freezer FOREVER, thaws quick, and tastes absolutely to-die-for!  The first time I made this, everyone asked me for the recipe...not to mention, not a bite was leftover!  This is a wonderful recipe that I will be making again and again.  I don't see any reason to change anything...though I may take the advice of some reviewers and try the addition of some chocolate if I'm ever in more of a chocolate mood.  Perfect as is though.  Thanks for sharing!!!

This pie is great, with a few tweaks!  1. You do not need the condensed milk at all.  The cream cheese/cool whip mix is plenty sweet (I used light versions of both).  This may also be why my pie did not freeze hard, I could cut straight out of the freezer.  2. I could not justify adding a whole jar of caramel, even with 2 pies.  I used about 2 tablespoons on each, and then added about the same with chocolate sauce.  I skipped the coconut as I just don't like it, and added the pecans without toasting them.  I figured out that this brought the calories down from 500/piece to about 275.

This sounded great, and all the reviews were so positive.  But this was just too sweet for us to eat, for all 4 who ate it, and believe me when I say we all love sweet things.  Nobody even wanted any more, it was much too sweet.

If my sister-in-law could have worn this pie, she would have.  I have never had such a strong reaction to something I have made.  I kinda feel bad cause she is dieting, but she could not stay out of this pie.  I made it for the Fourth of July weekend, and both pies were devoured.  I changed nothing....perfection!!!!!  If you are dieting, this is extremely dangerous!

Delicious & very simple! If you do not want to use 2 pie crusts, 1 deep dish works well. I omitted coconut b/c I'm not a big fan. I will definitely be making this again & again.

OH.MY.GOD.  So good (!), and decadent tasting. Only thing I added was a drizzle of hot fudge and a 1/2 c. of chocolate chips.  My family devoured this pie!

Yummy.  Super easy to make. The coconut/peacan topping on the top was wonderful.  It was sweet but wonderful on a hot summer evening. I never make pies and this was simple.  If you have a stand mixer use it...a big help.

Wife made this in a 13 x 9 cake pan.  I told her if she would make this all the time, she would never have to make another kind of dessert.  We loved the taste. Thank you.

My mother in law made this the other day, as she had gotten the recipe from her daughter. This makes enough filling to do 2 ready made crusts, but you have to do more of the coconut/pecan mix for them. Or it can make one 9 inch glass deep dish make your own crust, as she had done! This way makes for a bigger, deeper nicer looking pie!! I did cut back on the butter for the coconut/pecan mix, and used both light cream cheese/cool whip, and I used unsweetned coconut and made my own crusts.  Took it into work and got rave reviews...had to write out the recipe then and there for everyone.  Was awesome!!

This is soo good! I'm actually glad DH doesn't like it (a whip cream thing of his) because now I have the second pie in the freezer... all for myself. I'll definitely make it again. Thanks for sharing!

Scrumptious!

When first glanced at recipe, I thought "caramel ice cream topping" referred to caramel ice cream for use as a topping.  Thus, purchased ice cream and no caramel topping.  Instead, used Dulce De Leche, which was lying around the house, and the results were fantastic!  Since Dulce De Leche is thicker than caramel sauce, it did not drizzle evenly on each layer.  Instead, we achieved a marble swirling effect, which was simply delicious!

I wish I could give this recipe more than five stars!!

Made this for 4th of July, and everyone loved it!  The only modification that I made was to use 3 TBSP butter instead of 6, and add a dash of olive oil to a cast iron skillet for the toppings.  Next time I am going to try the large-sized pie crusts to keep the toppings from falling off the pies.  Wonderful recipe...thanks!!!

This is hands down the best pie I have ever made. I took it to work and they are still talking about it. It's as easy as it is delicious and you get 2 pies! I call this my secret pie recipe that I will only share with my best friends who promise not to pass it around! That's how much I love it. Make this for your friends and family and you'll be their hero!

Truly amazing!  This recipe is highly customizable.  Next time I am going to add some chocolate fudge ice cream sauce to the cream cheese mixture.  This is so easy to make.  I want to just eat the coconut mixture.

I ended up (accidentally) leaving this pie in the freezer for 2 weeks and it was STILL great. The recipe definitely gives a lot of extra filling for just 9-inch pie shells, don't feel obligated to use it all. A really really sugary-sweet pie though. Between the batter being so sweet and the caramel inbetween and then the topping - you really have to be able to hold some sugar! Might cut back on the sugar next time. Thanks!

This pie is outstanding!  The recipe makes 2 pies, but I made it in one 9x13 pan.  I made my own graham cracker crust and cut it into squares when frozen.  It worked great and I found it easier to cut for a larger crowd.  I have also made it in a regular pastry crust that I prebaked.  Delicious!

This was a big hit at our Memorial Day picnic - out of personal preference I omitted the coconut and nuts. I replaced the sauteed nuts with chocolate chips and some chocolate syrup and it was absoutely delish!!! This is a great recipe!

Yummy and easy.  I use a chocolate cookie crust and drizzle with caramel and chocolate syrup.  Kind of like Girl Scout's Samoas.  I also toast the coconut and almonds in the oven.

I followed the basic recipe with these changes.: I used dessert girls recipe for the crust (1.5 c ap flour, 1 c pecans finely chopped, & 1 stick butter bake 15 min, cool) I made my own whipped topping and used only 1/4 of the caramel sauce. It was a huge success!! Everyone raved about the crust.

Very good. Very sweet! I made this in a 12 in springform pan with three layers and my own graham cracker crust. I brought this to a BBQ and everyone raved about it. I like it defrosted just enough to cut. It's too sweet to eat very much at one time but it is also very addictive.

I have made this several times before.  I was introduced to it 8 years ago by the dietician at the nursing home that I worked for.  She called it ice cream pie.  There is one major difference in the pie that I make and that is I use a short bread crust.  I have tried the graham cracker and prefer the shortbread. You can vary the toppings to suit your taste.  I also layer my pie by putting in half the cream cheese mixture then the next layer is the pecans and coconut and so forth.

I was searching for this pie recipe after trying at a restaurant in St. Croix.  This was definitely the pie though I don't think they used quite so much caramel sauce on theirs.  This was extremely rich and really good though next time I think I'll use half as much caramel and maybe sprinkle some of the pecan/coconut mixture in the middle layer.  I might even drizzle a very small amount of chocolate sauce on the top layer.

I made this pie to take to a dinner party. It was fabulous! It made 2 pies, so I had one to leave at home for the family. Everyone thought it was fabulous! It was super easy and a great dessert for summer! It also looks pretty. I will definitely make it again!

It was easy and cheap to make. I froze it for a day before serving it out though since I didn't like how it looked dished out with only 12 hrs [but that's just my freezer]. Trying this with an Oreo pie crust seems tempting to try also with this type of recipe, or any "chocolate" type crust. It was a little sweet to some people in the house but for me it was fine. I cooked the coconuts and pecans a bit longer on a low temperature because I wanted it all to be browned evenly as possible and have the flakes come out more crunchy. Depending on what type [brand] you use for your chocolate and caramel syrup be careful when you drizzle it since mines spilled a bit over the crust because I thought it would be thicker in texture; should have tried a little on a spoon or something to see how it would come out first.

Great but changed it to my family's likes. Added 1/4 cup of caramel syrup to the cream cheese mixture. Instead of layering with caramel I layered it with chocolate hot fudge and then topped it with mini marshmallows, chocolate chips, chopped toasted almonds and drizzled with caramel syrup. My family was in love!

This pie was fantastic and so easy to make!  I used the caramel topping in a squeeze "jar" and had no problems with getting it even as some others have said.  I actually used more caramel than the recipe calls for.  Everyone at my party loved it, which was surprising because all of them said they hated coconut.  lol  Thank you for such an easy, great tasting recipe!

I have made this recipe for years and think I have perfected it! The first time I made it, I followed the directions exactly, and it was fabulous-but is definitely better now with the changes. First of all, the magic is definitely in that filling. Like the others reviews say, the possibilities for toppings and flavor combos is endless. That "ice cream" center is what stays that perfect consistency and makes it fabulous every time. I like the coconut/pecan/Carmel but another favorite is a Oreo crust, Peanutbutter sauce and chopped Reese's PB cups. Modifications-definitely reduce the amount of butter from 6 T to 2T. With 6, the nuts and coconut are heavy and greasy-totally unnecessary. Also, 12 oz of Carmel sauce is overkill. And I'm not one of those people who doesn't like sweet desserts-I love decadent desserts. But with that much butter and Carmel sauce, it was super heavy and rich to where you could only really enjoy a small sliver. I just do a cross-cross pattern of Carmel once over the to of the frozen layer and its the perfect sweetness.

This was one of the most FANTASTIC desserts I have ever had.  It was super easy, and everyone that tried it loved it.  My husband said it was the best thing I've ever made in the almost 11 years we've been married.  And he's not a big sweet eater.  Just delicious!

SUPER YUMMY!!! This pie is absolutely wonderful. I took the tip of toasting the coconut a little longer and it made for a nice crispy topping. And I loved how the pie was just soft enough to cut as I took it straight out of the freezer. I hate eating a freezer pie that is icy because I'm not patient enough to let it thaw out...this one was creamy goodness.

Amazing pie!  Tastes just like ice cream but doesn't melt into a pool on your plate.  I used a chocolate crust and sprinkled mini chocolate chips on top of the caramel.  Yum!

I'm pretty disappointed with this pie. I followed some of the reviewer suggestions which were helpful, but it just doesn't taste like much of anything. About all I can say is that it's rich. I won't be making this again.

YUMMY!  I lightened it up a bit and don't think it was compromised a bit.  Used reduce-fat graham cracker pie crusts, only 3 T of butter for the coconut and pecans and lite cream cheese and whipped topping.  Rave reviews from all who shared it! Thanks!

At another reviewer's suggestion, I used a chocolate crust and added mini chocolate chips. Made all the difference. I also used fat free whipped topping and cream cheese, as that is what I had, and it turned out great. Let it sit out for 30 mins before serving.

Delicious.  I made one for my husband and I and one for my parents.  Everyone loved it.  People at work raved.  Will definitely make this pie again.  I did cook the pecans and coconut a little longer than called for though.

Rather than using 9-inch crusts, I actually used the miniature, pre-made graham cracker crusts that you can buy at the grocery store. The final result, a tray of mini freezer caramel drizzle pies, were a hit!

I turned this pie into a cheesecake (12 inch).  I also used coarsely grounded pralines instead of coconut and plain pecans.  I also layered the praline mixture( be sure to ground up extra amount).  It was delicious.  Everyone at the bbq loved it.

I thought this was delicious.  I don't like coconut very much, but it actually gives this pie a chewy, great texture.  I enjoyed it.

OMG!!!! LOVED this pie! So rich and decadent. Made it exactly as written, except only made one pie instead of two. The coconut/pecan topping really puts this pie over the top! I will definately be making this one again! Thanks for posting. :)

Oh-so-good and easy!  It is very sweet but we didn't mind that.  I made this in a 9x13 pan and next time I would like to try adding a layer of either chocolate sauce or mini chocolate chips to make it taste like Girl Scout cookies.  Mmmm!!

This pie is yummy!  It is very sweet, so a small piece goes a long way!  I used fat free or sugar free for all ingredients except the cream cheese which was full fat.  I put the pie mix in a springform pan and used Graham Cracker Crust I from this site.

Wow...so good!  It is excellent as written.  Everyone raved about how good it was!  The only thing i did differently was to use only 8 oz of whipped topping cause that's all I had.  Next time i'll definitely use the full 16 oz.  Loved the coconut/pecan topping on it!

I wish I could give this more than five stars too.  I made my own graham cracker crust and put one in a spring form pan and one in a pie plate.  I also used fat free cream cheese and fat free cool whip and came out just great.

Very delicious!  I made both pies thinking one for dessert tonight and one tucked in the freezer for a night I was needing a quick dessert, but my husband and 2 sons cleaned up both and were looking for more!  Definately a keeper recipe.

I am in LOVE with this recipe. Maybe my best dessert find on AR! (that good!!) I made this for a cookout tonight, and I hardly got any because it was eaten so quickly. The few bites I did have were outstanding. I made my own carmel sauce, and I also made a raspberry drizzle (I adore the combo of raspberry and chocolate, so I figured carmel would be good too... it totally was). Thank you so much for this recipe, so easy, so good.

This pie is like heaven in your mouth. I will definitely be making this again...and again. To cut down on the sweetness I used a regular pie crust, sugar free caramel topping and lite cool whip. I also used reduced fat cream cheese, and it still tasted sinful. although it should be noted that when using reduced fat cream cheese you have to let it stay in the freezer longer for it to set up. It may have been the combination of all the reduced fat ingredients that made it a little looser, but no matter, the end product was a winner.

One of the best pies I ever ate and so easy to make. I served it to a group of friends and they all wanted the recipe. I didn't change a thing in the recipe and wouldn't.

So so yummy! Even though it is a frozen pie, we make it for Thanksgiving and Christmas. We pair it with homemade caramel drizzle sauce and it is amazing!!! I have been making this for several years now and I always have people ask for my recipe. I've had to save the link on my phone so I can forward it on to everyone.

Added 1 tsp vanilla bean paste to cream cheese/Eagle Brand condensed milk mixture and chocolate chips. Light, very tasteful Summer dessert.  Will definitely make again and use my own graham cracker crust recipe.

I am making it the second time how.  Halved it for on pie at a time.  Changes:  Instead of  sweetened condensed milk, combined 1/2 cup vanilla protein powder in 7 oz of milk.  Deliciously sweet.  Made a crust with vanilla wafers (made crumbs, combined with butter).  Used lowfat cream cheese and topping and did not add caramel sauce as it was plenty sweet.  Used walnuts instead of pecans.   This time I am using almonds.  I think that this could be varied in a lot of ways and still be wonderful.  Husband, who is a chocolate man, won't let me change a thing.   Great company dessert and very easy.  Doesn't requite an oven so it keeps the house cool in the summer.  10!

I did utilize real whipped cream ( yes, it freezes well) in the recipe, more coconuts & pecans toasted a bit longer & spread in the layers before the caramel drizzle. Great recipe!

Yummy,  this pie was a HUGE success with my family.  Instead of making two pies, I  made one big one in a 13x9 pan.   I  also doubled  the caramel.

*Extremely* sweet.  I think next time I would leave the condensed milk out altogether.  I let the coconut and pecans sit on very low heat for about 20 minutes so they got nice and crispy.  Definitely serve this right out of the freezer.  I think with a few changes this could be a really exceptional pie.

As everyone else says, this is a popular selection in my home.
I made my own graham cracker crust, which was delicious.
Next time, I would use all of the filling for one thicker pie.  I used unsweetened coconut, which helps with the sweetness.  The caramel is what makes it sweet so if you prefer less sweet desserts, I'd reduce the amount.   It's really easy to make and I love that you can make it ahead!

Fabulous!  I made it in a springform pan and since we are gluten free, I made a Chex Cereal crust instead of the graham cracker crust.  I used a bit more caramel than called for, but all else was to the recipe.  Everyone raved over this easy to make dessert and have requested it twice since.

A new family favorite that will show up again and again. It was amazing. I also appreciate the fact that you can make it ahead of time and put in the freezer when guests are coming for dinner. It was very easy to make, I wouldn't change a thing.

This pie was quick to put together and utterly delicious.  I made it exactly as written.  The only thing I might do next time is put a little caramel on the bottom of the pie crust and a little less in the middle.  Definitely make again.

Very tasty!  I did this recipe in an 8" springform and made the crust from shortbread cookie crumbs mixed with some melted butter.  Also, can't get frozen whipped topping here in Oz, so I whipped up some normal cream until it was quite thick, and that worked fine.  Other than that I followed the recipe as written and it was great.  Will definitely make again.

This pie is the best I have had in a long time. The first time I made it, I did not have all the ingredients, so I made 1 pie instead of two. The second time I made it. I made two and left the coconut and pecans off of one because my husband and son do not like it, but they loved the pie plain. I will be making this for the holidays.

This pie was amazing! I made it as is and it was perfect. I left the nuts and coconuts off half of each pie because my kids don't like them. I am going to try again with Heath bar crumbles!! I used hit fudge and caramel topping!

We doubled the recipe and put it in a 9x13" glass pan. We had extra topping and cheese filling that we will use for ice cream or fruit this week. It is very sweet so you do not need a large portion. A strong cup of coffee would have been a nice addition. Next time, I will use a springform pan as it would be better presentation. But messy but delicious!

Excellent recipe! I did this in a 9X13 pan and just made my own graham cracker crust. I did everything else exactly as stated. Delicious! Everyone loved it.

Delish & easy to make.  I did substitute a shortbread crust only because I get tired of the same old graham types as well as used light cream cheese. Everyone raved over it!

WOW- now this is a pie!!  I used fat free sweetened cond milk and light cream cheese.  Smuckers caramel- the whole jar.  I used 2- 10 inch pie crusts bc it drives me nuts when I make pie and it all overflows.  the 10 inch shells worked perfectly.  Used sweetened coconut.  I let the coconut cook a few minutes longer just to be sure the consistency would be right.  This pie freezes perfectly.  Doesn't really need to be set out first to cut although I think the best flavor comes when it gets a little more soft and creamy.  Yum!  LOVE that it makes 2 pies so you can always have one in the freezer.

I just 1/2'ed all the ingredients and made 1 pie. I really liked this, the family thought it was ok. Served after freezing for about 5 hrs. and approx. 1/2 hr. in refrig. Used Marzetti's caramel dip, a bit difficult to drizzle but rich and buttery tasting.

This pie was so delicious.  I made this for a homegoing service at my church. Everyone was asking me for the recipe. I plan to make this again real soon. I do have some tips about this pie not to use a whole package of coconut, maybe a half of bag. Teresa Hale

Made this for Mother's Day and it was a big hit.  It is sweet and I suggest cutting in smaller pie pieces.  Definitely will make this again.  But then again I gave the recipe to everyone there so I'm sure the rest of the family will be making it as we'll :)

It thought is was really sweet.I did  not  use all that butter in the coconuts and pecans,I think next time I would just toast the toppings without the butter and leave some of the carmel out.The center did taste like ice-cream.

Yum, yum, yum, yum!  I made my own whipped cream and my own sweetened condensed milk.  I found that I used less caramel sauce.  I served this to two people who claim not to like coconut and they loved it!  Toasting the nuts is a must, it makes for such a wonderful topping to this great pie!

This is absolutely awesome!  In stead of making two 9 inch pies I just made it in one 9x13 which seemed to work great!  I used the Graham cracker crust I recipe from this site and did not double it.  This was a very sweet dessert.  It also held up well as I took it to a family reunion.  I probably got it out of the freezer about 15 minutes before it was time to eat and then cut it right before we ate.

Amazing! I followed the ingredients exactly and it worked out great. I did have to saute the pecans and coconut a little longer than five minutes though (about 8). Definitely will make again!

I made this for Christmas.  It was very good.  The only thing is that once I got to mother-in-laws house and set it unlevel in her freezer, the carmel oozed to one side.  It was still very good and I will make again on New Year's  for family reunion.

Delicious, got rave reviews from the family. This recipe was very easy to make, and makes two pies which is a plus when serving a group, or you can save one for later. Will be making this again.

YUM! This is a delicious pie! I'm not a fan of coconut or pecans, but toasted and put on top of this pie made them great. I will be making this again.
