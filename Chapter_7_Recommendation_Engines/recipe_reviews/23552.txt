The only thing bad about this recipe is that it was not detailed enough on the ingredients.  I was not sure how to "cut" the bananas (I short sliced them).  I was not sure whether to use strawberries with or w/out sugar.  Also, it would have been helpful if a suggestion was given on what sherbert to use.  I used Pineapple with pineapple bits in it, but would have been nice to know what the person who submitted the recipe used.  Everyone at the party liked it.  Be sure to have colored toothpicks near by so your guest  can eat the fruit!

I made this for my sister's Baby shower and it was a big hit.  I listened to the others and left out the bananas. We had 40 people, I made the punch 3 times and it still wasn't enough!! Thanks for a great recipe!! P.S. we kept a bottle of vodka on the side and those who wanted to spike their glass did so.

This punch was an absolute hit!  I froze the bananas for an hour then let them thaw while I was preparing the strawberries, and they turned out fine.  I used rasberry sherbert, too.  I made this for my daughter's birthday recently, and it was gulped down!  There was about 15 people there who drank it, and I had to make it twice!  That's some good punch!

Totally scrumptious! My friends were kind of nervous about drinking it because of the floating fruit but they ended up loving it! Pretty easy to make and serves a huge amount!! YUM!

This was excellent and everyone enjoyed it.  I doubled the punch and used only about 1 liter of 7up.  I took the advice of others to slice and freeze the bananas overnight.  I also made the sherbet into balls with a mini scooper and put them in the freezer overnight.  Try it...You will LOVE it

Its quick, easy and tastes wonderful... what more can you ask for! I put orange sherbert in mine, but I think any flavor of sherbert would be good.

This is a wonderful tasting punch.  I have used it twice at baby showers (the non alcholic version of course!).  I have gotten great compliments both times.  I will use this recipe again and again.

What a wonderful tasting punch. It reminded me of the punch I used to have a church socials as a child.  I omitted the Bananas and froze half of the pinapples and strawberies, it came out yum!  I must also say that I appreciated the leeway left to the cook to alter the recipe in the way they saw fit, I think a part of growing as a chef is learning to incorporate your own flair.  I could use sprite, and someone else would use 7up, and they are both correct to the punch, just made our own way (both delicious too!).  Way to go, great recipe!

I really loved this punch as did my guests. The fruit chunks make it pretty and are fun to eat! I used orange sherbet and the bananas were my favorite part.
