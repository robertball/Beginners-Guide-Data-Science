As I read through the reviews just before cooking this I thought uh-oh!! Almost evryone said they had a hard time with the "batter", I thought I will fix the problem before I have it!  I follwed the recipe like it said but before frying the chicken, after dipping it in the batter, I dipped it in a basic flour mixture to coat over the batter!! this worked out very well! It browned nicely... and didn't stick at all!!! Mind you it has to be a good medium-hot lard you are frying it in!!and youare only browning the outside of the chicken not cooking it!! It cooks in the slow cooker!

What a waste of a can of soup.  The "batter" peeled off the chicken but stuck to the bottom of the pan, leaving the meat white and my pan black.  In retrospect, I see no reason to use the soup at all, since a basic dredge of flour, salt and pepper will create a better fry-crust and won't stick to the pan.  To add insult to injury, as I was scooping up the frozen concentrate for the sauce, I saw a recipe for the exact same orange glaze on the side of the can. Dang! So next time, save money, time, and dishes. Just fry your chicken as usual, scoop on the glaze in the same pan and have your dinner in 10 minutes instead of three hours.

This recipe is a 5-star with corn starch in the orange sauce (add 1 tsp to chicken broth before it is heated).  We served with rice.  Also I used a whole can of campbell's chicken broth with the entire small minute maid OJ container (6 oz?) and brown sugar to taste (several tablespoons).  Absolutely delicious!!

I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because it was extremely fattening to start.  I tweeked out most of the fat by omitting the shortening and using the 98 (I think)% fat free creamed soup by Cambells. I also cooked it alittle differently.
I mixed the seasonings together, floured the chicken and threw it in a nonstick skillet with cooking spray to brown.  
For the sauce I used fat free chicken broth, sugar twin brown sugar and 2/3 cup orange juice concentrate.
Threw everything in the crockpot for about 4 and a half hours and YUMM! Will definately make it again, and again and ....

Really a nice dish.  I skipped the browning and just threw everything in the crockpot because that is why I use it- so I don't have to do more than one step in preparing dinner!  I left the lid off the last hour to thicken the sauce.  Tasted delicious with potatoes (instant).  I will make again!

Not at all what I was expecting.  But it was good.  I did not use the condensed soup, or shortening.  I browed the chicken coated the chicken with the flour mixture and browned it with vegitible oil.  It worked wonderful.  The chicken was moist and tender.  Thicker pieces did not have the orange flavor in the middle, but the left over juice in the crock pot makes a wonderful dipping sauce!

The same basic taste can be had quicker with less waste. Dredge  4 chicken breasts in seasoned flour , and fry up til done. Take  1.5  pint of heavy cream , a stick of thyme, and cook about 8 minutes for a sauce. Add  4 to 5  tbsps orange marmalade to sauce at the end, and stir til smooth-don't forget to remove the thyme stick . Season to taste. Spoon over chicken which is served on a bed of saffron rice. Same taste idea as original recipe though. Less time and less waste.

This was wonderful and  and wasn't very difficult as long as you flour the chicken so the coating will stay better when you cook it. We all loved it and will have it again.

Like many other reviewers, I wish I had read the reviews before making this. The sauce didn't stick to the chicken and my pan was black. Next time I'm going to try coating the chicken with a thin coating of soup and then dip it in seasoned flour before I brown the chicken in the pan. The rest of the soup I'll put in crock pot. Loved the flavor but not the procedure.

I really wish I had read the reviews and tips prior to cooking.  The soup was a waste, it peeled right off in the pan.  I almost used my deep fryer, it probably would have stayed on better if I had.  I think I'll try to coat with an egg wash first, then basic flour mixture an then maybe use the soup mixture next time.  Not to sure if I'll try this one again though.

I cooked this in the electric skillet and added the chicken soup to the broth and brown sugar instead of dipping the chicken in to fry.    Also added rice.  Quite tasty!

I went ahead and added white rice into my crock pot with the chicken and used the full can of chicken broth and orange juice.! It came out very tasty and is even better the next day!

My son really loves this recipe. I took the advice of other reviewers and omitted the soup. We do an egg wash, turn it in flour and ccok on stove top. Saves time and tastes pretty good.

This dish was wonderful! I served it over white rice. The chicken had such a good orange flavor. I took the suggestion and dipped the chicken in the soup and breaded it in seasoned flour before cooking. I was going for a healthier way so I used olive oil instead of cooking oil. Also, I did have to add some corn starch to the liquid in the crockpot to thicken it up some. I will definately make this one again. The husband loved it and so did I!

This was very good. It had a nice taste but I did do one thing different....I added a nice slice of hot pepper cheese to it while the chicken cooked in the crock pot. I would make again even if I didn't add the cheese. Thanks for sharing!:)

I had the same problems with the batter as everyone else did. Next time I would add more flour to see if it sticks then. Was not the type of Orange Chicken I was thinking about.

My husband thought this dish was okay, but my kids didn't like it.  Too orangy-tasting for them.  I didn't have fun preparing it - messy and cumbersome process of dipping chicken in soup and frying; then most of it didn't stick to the chicken during frying.  Most of the can of soup is unused, so you just throw it out afterward, which is wasteful.  The finished dish isn't visually appealing.

I really liked this recipe! It was pretty easy to prepare. Instead of the shortening for frying the chicken I used a few tablespoons of olive oil. I also floured the chicken before dipping it in the soup mixture. Also I used the Splenda Brown Sugar in place of reg. brown sugar. I served it with a classic risotto & it was delish! My 17 month old son LOVED it! I'll be making this a lot from now on! Thanks for sharing.

Some reviewers have had problems with the chicken soup mixture not sticking to the chicken breasts. I solved this problem by dipping the chicken breasts in the chicken soup mixture, and then dipping them in bread crumbs before frying.

Ok, so I was VERY weary of making this, after reading the reviews and especially after seeing the picture (I Thought, wow, that looks like something you'd see at the bottom of a porta-potty, not the bottom of a crockpot!!) But Im very glad I did try it...for the whole batter-falling-off issue, definitely recoat with another layer of flour when your done coating as per recipe directions.  Or leave the soup out all together, but you will lose a thickness of coating if you do this, I know, I've tried it both ways.  Also, I add the whole can of chicken broth and the whole OJ, as I like lots of extra sauce for dipping! It wasnt what you'd get at your local Chinese place, but it had an awesome orange flavor, and we loved it!!

This was pretty good.  The frying before slow cooking was kind of difficult and I don't know how worth it.  I slow cooked this for two hours and it was nowhere near done, so I transferred it to the oven (covered with tin foil) and baked for 30 minutes on 375 - it was cooked perfectly.  You could definitely taste the orange juice.  I would make it again.

Really difficult recipe for the crock pot and it didn't taste all that good to me.  The texture was all off.  My husband said he liked it well enough, but I will not slow cook it again.  If you just pan cook the chicken in the breading and make an orange sauce to serve over rice it would be better.   I might try that.

I've made this recipe twice and both times I did not use the crockpot, I thought it was easier to just mix the orange sauce together on the stove top while the chicken is frying and then toss it all over some rice. I also don't use the soup on the chicken. I don't see how it would make it better. My husband and 2yr old both love it!

Breading fell completely off the chicken just like almost everyone else..
Flavor was delicious though! Will make chicken different next time but will keep orange sauce. Perfect over rice.

I did not like this recipe at all. I couldn't take the smell of the sauce. The sauce was also way too orangey for me. Unfortunately, I will not try this one again.

this was a good basic recipe.  Definately like the sauce.  Will probably play around with it to try and vary it in the future.

I followed another reviewers suggestion, and fried the chicken as I normally would, then added the orange glaze.  Very good - but didn't use the crockpot.

Pretty good, needed a little more salt but overall pretty good. I suggest following the recipe on browning the chicken well for a good flavor. I will make it again.

I tried this recipe today and although I always follow a recipe to the T the first time I make it (I experiment later on) I quickly saw the frustration of trying to dip the chicken in the soup and I even tried dipping it in bread crumbs/flour after. I ended up dippig the rest of the chicken in bread crumbs and browning it..The rest was easy..

This was a big hit at my house.  I took some advice from other reviews and coated the batter with flour before frying, as well as using an entire can of soup and the entire 6oz can of frozen concentrate.  The chicken had a wonderful orange flavor all throughout, and although some of the batter ended up coming off in the slow cooker, what was left was delicious!

Agreed, that after all the hassle of having to continuously scrape the batter off to keep the pan clean enough to cook in - because it was NOT gonna' stick to the chicken, the final product was quite tasty, and my family did enjoy and compliment it.  But i think i'll go with the review  by 'KITTENWITHAWHIP' below next time - i wish i had read this before i made it... she has a great idea for tasty chicken without a hassel and the 3 hour wait!

Coating stayed in the pan, not on the chicken. Also, I wish I would have thickened the orange sauce before serving (it was a liquid consistancy.) I served it with rice.

It tastes really good, but the coating of the chicken was just awful to deal with. It didn't stick to the chicken well then when I fried it the coating started to peel off. I really had to work with it, but finally got it in the cooker and then the coating just started to come off even more. The taste though is really good. Made it with coconut rice and me and my husband really enjoyed the flavor of it all.

I really liked this - served it over risotto. I, too, skipped the pan frying and doubled the OJ concentrate. my daughter thought it was too orangy, I thought it was just right!

The chicken retained a very good flavor, but the frying before the crock-pot was definitely unnecessary.  I'll make it again--without frying it first.  It just fell off and made the crock-pot hard to clean!

I was also concerned about the fat content, so I fried the chicken in cooking spray and used 98% fat free cream of mushroom soup (it's what I had in the cupboard.)  I also didn't have frozen oj, so I used the juice of an orange, with some orange slices trown in.  We really liked it, the chicken was tender and the sauce was flavorful.  Not bad for the first time using my crockpot!

Final flavor turned out great, but I like many others could not keep the coating on the chicken upon frying. There was almost none of it left on the meat when it went in the crock pot. Still tasted great though.

If you make sure your lard is HOT, this works fine. 

Just like another said - your not cooking the chicken in the skillet, it cooks in the crock pot.

We loved it!

It had a good taste but not what I was expecting. Adding the flour to the chicken soup as a coating wasn't what I was expecting. It was hard to coat the chicken with and it didn't brown up.  thought it would be a more candied sauce. It was really good but I probably won't be in a hurry to make again.

Really enjoyed this - easy to make, tastes great and my wife now thinks I'm a chef.  Add just a little heat (chili or hot sauce) to give it just a little more tang.  I'll make it again.

This is my favorite so far.  I did it on the stove top and the flavor is amazing.  It looks bland but it isn't.  I added a can of carrots, pimentos and sliced bell pepper for color.

I started making this recipe exact just to see if the reviews were true.  After finding most were I quickly tossed the soup and used seasoned flour which worked great.  The only one in the family who liked the recipe was my husband.  I used a full can of broth and OJ.  It seemed to much but with rice it was perfect.  I don't know if i'll make it again.  Only if my husband begs.

I agree with the other reviewers.  This is a great recipe if you just change it completely.  Skip the soup, brown chicken dipped in seasoned flour, then simmer in the sauce (but use the whole can of broth and whole can of OJ with brown sugar to taste).

Dummy me, didn't read the reviews, first. The batter didn't stay on the chicken, but the sauce was pretty good. I'll make it, again, but will play around with it. To me, GOOD chicken is "Food of the Gods!!!"

because my guest was late, I ended up cooking for about 3.5 hours on low.  the chicken was VERY DRY, but tasty enough with lots of sauce served to each guest in a side bowl to dunk it in.  served it with some pan fried zuchini in italian seasoning/olive oil, preceded by a carrot ginger soup.  very good combination.

I didnt even brown the chicken.  I tossed the dry ingredients into the crock pot.  Sliced the chicken into strips and tossed it in the dry stuff to kinda coat it.  Then I put the rest in the crock and cooked it on low for about 3 hrs.  Turned out great.  I would be interested to try it w/ browning the chicken first w/ a better coating.  Its just too easy not to go for 4 stars, although the taste isn't bursting with excitement.  it tastes like chicken with an orange marinade.

It was ok. Prob wont make again.  Was missing something and I just can't figure out what it was, even after i read reviews and other suggestions.
