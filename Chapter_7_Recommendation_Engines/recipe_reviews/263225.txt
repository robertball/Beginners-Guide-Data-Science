I set the oven at 450 instead of 500. I broiled on low for the last two minutes to brown up the topping. I used parchment paper and sprayed some olive oil PAM. Didn't use tomatoes or spinach. Added Mrs. Dash and garlic powder to the almond mixture.  No salt. The salmon I had the second time I made it did not have skin on it so I coated both sides with almond mixture.

The salmon portion of this recipe is a solid 5 but we both agreed that the salad dressing had very little flavour, a quick fix with a drizzle of balsamic vinegar.  My salmon was on the larger side, closer to 12 ounces, and I cooked it for 12 minutes or 10 minutes per inch of salmon. I couldn't find cherry tomatoes so I added wedges and some shaved carrot for colour.  The salmon portion of this recipe will be a repeat! Thanks for sharing.
