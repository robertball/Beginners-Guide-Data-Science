I didn't have the cherries and I only had a little butter so I used coconut oil for the remaining 1/2 cup...and it was still great! Nice flavor and texture. I will definitely be making these again.

Hard to go wrong with so much butter and brown sugar! I followed the recipe exactly, though baked the bars for 35 minutes, and they still seemed under cooked.  Because mine were under cooked, the middle was gooey, which some people might like.  I de-frosted sour cherries from last year's harvest, though the cherry flavor didn't come through as much as I would have liked.  Maybe next time I'll add more cherries or add almond extract.

I really thought this recipe sounded great and healthy ingredients made it worth trying.  While it was tasty with the coconut, cherries and raisins mixture, the recipe does fall short in one way.  The bottom of the baking pan should be sprayed with vegetable spray for ease of removing the bars from the pan after baking.  Also, everyone who makes this, make sure you do not overbake the  bottom crust - 15 min. max and make sure to spray dish beforehand.  They were good but not sure I'll take the time to make again.

These were quick and easy. I used frozen cherries - didn't bother to thaw but put a bit for flour in the egg/ fruit mixture.  Freezes well

Delicious!!  Didn't have sour cherries so I soaked dried cherries in some orange juice and used those, using orange juice to loosen batter.

We scoffed down the first batch almost before I got the cover  on the container, so made a second batch right away.  Rationing  these out one at a time!!
