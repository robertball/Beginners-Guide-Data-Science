I added a little Chinese 5 Spice to the wonton filling, and some soy sauce to the chicken broth. It was pretty good but not really worth the time and effort. Thanks anyway!

Yummy!  I left out the celery and green onion and made plain shrimp dumplings and they were fabulous.  Everything was quick and easy to make, and tasted just right!

I doubled the recipe, the scallions I put in a big hand flu, until I put in the shrimp I didn't pulse, I blended it throughly. The shrimp thickened the sauce. Also I used two egg white instead of another full egg.

We liked it because it was a nice light meal, but it lacked flavor and substance for us. Perfect for someone who is trying something for the first time. Makes a nice base for add-is and tweaking. Thanks for sharing!
