I had a couple different get-togethers today, and knowing I couldn't be in any control of the earlier one and knowing it would be full of calories, when I was asked to bring something for the later one, I went on a search for a good low calorie veggie dip. I ran into this one and it looked to be right up my alley. I have to say I enjoyed it very much. I only made a couple minor changes. I used fat free sour cream, and added some dried thyme and some black pepper. It was delicious, and after taking my kids to a carnival where my only choices for dinner were full of calories, it was nice to be able to take something healthy to my other get-together. The only thing I would have done differently if I had had it on hand at the time is instead of regular black pepper, I would have used freshly ground black pepper. Very good recipe. Thank you.

What a wonderful way to use dill and cucumbers from the garden!  I chose this recipe because I did not have Greek yogurt on hand and wanted a sauce that could pass as tzatziki.  I would definitely recommend this as a substitute.  I added a small bit of olive oil mayo to the mixture, just to add thickness.  UPDATE:  Today I did not have any lemon juice on hand.  If you find yourself in this situation, use vinegar as a substitute.  However, do not use the full amount.  Just add until the dip tastes right.  I don't even know how much I added.  Also, green onions make a nice addition.

I made this dip last minute to go along with my salmon with lemon and dill (I was a little nervous my company would find the salmon bland).  It was super easy and came out great after sitting in the fridge for about an hour.  Great complement to the fish I'll most likely serve it on the side anytime I have salmon.

Excellent recipe.  I made this for work and 2 people asked me for the recipe and 3 people can't stop talking about it.  Instead of grating and extracting the juice, I seeded the cucumber and chopped the cucumber into small pieces.  This way, you could still taste the cucumber.  It is a very refreshing dip!!

I had never made a dip with grated cucumber, but that is a wonderful tip.  I salted the grated cucumber and let it drain for a few minutes in a colander, then squeezed it dry.

This dip is excellent. I needed a dip for a crudite platter I made, and I thought about buying a dip, then I found this recipe and thought I'd try it. I'm so glad I did because people RAVED about it. People said, "it tastes so fresh". It's so light, it's perfect for the warm weather. I'll definately make this again. Oh, I didn't add nearly that much lemon juice, I added just a squeeze.

I love this recipe with garlic. Add one clove of pressed garlic for each 16 oz of sour cream. Or more if you are a garlic lover like I am.

This is fast quick and easy.  A Great alternative if you don't have plain yogurt to make Tatziki.  I added a little bit of mayo with olive oil and a teaspoon of minced garlice.  I didn't have fresh dill so I used dried.  I also  used reduced fat sour cream.  I used this to top the Spinach and Feta Turkey burger (recipe can be found on this site) So good!

This recipe is almost identical to a salad that my husband grew up with in Germany.  He uses dried dill and slices the cucumbers.  We eat it often with fish and mashed potatoes.  I had never thought of making a dip out of it - but that's a great way to provide that fresh flavor we love in different way.  Just a tip - to drain the water from the cucumbers so they don't make the salad or dip watery - my husband sprinkles the cucumbers with quite a bit of salt and leaves it to pull the water out.  Then drain the water off (I usually just put them in a colander to start and sit it over the sink).  I'm not sure about the salt getting off of the shredded cucumbers, but it pretty much leaves with the cucumber juice so the cucumbers don't end up being too salty - just skip the salt in the recipe.

This is delicious for sure & Perfect for summer. I added freshly ground pepper and garlic powder and also used sea salt. Don't skimp on the lemon juice, it adds such a nice *zing* I took another's advice to squeeze the shredded (unpeeled) cucumber between paper towels and this worked perfectly to keep it from getting too runny. I served this with carrots, celery and cucumber slices. Yummy!! I'll make this often. Thanks!

This was a great light and refrshing dip. I served with traditional gyro meat from this site and thought it was great. Made no changes whatsoever. It did make a lot though! Next time I will probably cut in half. Thanks!

It's OK; but it is just an Americanized version of the Greek Tzatziki - which uses Greek Yogurt, cucumber (Peeled, seeded and finely chopped), garlic, dill, and a tad of XVOO.

Delicious.  Extremely refreshing!  I think this would be great with pita chips and maybe carrots and cherry tomatoes.

This stuff is awesome.  I love dill and cucumber, and this is another great recipe with the two.  I'm not sure we have chips anywhere, so I just tried it with bread cubes.  Very good!  I think I added a bit more lemon than called for--it's a bit lemony--but it's still wonderful.  Thanks for the recipe!

very good...added 1/2 tsp thyme and 1/2 tsp black pepper. Used with Light Sour Cream. I also only used about 1/2 cup of fresh chopped dill since that was all I had and everyone loved it. Said it was fresh and light.

I have made this several times and it is always a hit!  This time I didn't measure the lemon juice but just rolled a medium sized lemon until soft and then used the juice from it.

Good flavor but very soupy. I squeezed the heck out of the cucumber, so not sure why that happened. I think next time I’ll skip the cucumber. I think having chunks in dip is a little too off putting.

I wish I had read the reviews first. 1/4 cup lemon juice is way to much for this recipe. Ruined the whole dip.

This recipe is so easy and quick!  It's ready in about 10 minutes and tastes better the longer it sits in the refrigerator.  It's great with veggies or chips and goes well as a dill sauce with asparagus.
