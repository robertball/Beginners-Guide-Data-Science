I had a bit of trouble following what went where before in the sauce before the scallops but it all went well and I 'll definitely make it again.

The sauce was delicious, different but we loved it. Definitely need to use vanilla paste or seeds, I used vanilla extract and it seemed off. My family loved it! Will definitely make this again with vanilla paste. I served it with zucchini noodles but pasta would work better especially with the sauce!

This is a wonderful scallop recipe.  The sauce with the oranges make it very special.  Easy to make and will certainly make this a lot in the future.
