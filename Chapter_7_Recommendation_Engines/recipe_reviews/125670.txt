Delicious!  Everyone wanted seconds! This is one of those high calorie salads.  I cut the butter for the croutons in half.  Next time, I'll try to cut more fat content from this salad while retaining the flavor!

Wonderful! I forgot the tomatoes, used store bought croutons, and used FF dressing. Even my 3 year old loved it!

I mad this for a bithday dinner and it turned out well.  The oiny thing I found is that there was too much dressing.  I had actually layered it differently then what what was suggested using a trifle glass dish, layering ingredients with dressing in between layers. everyone loved it and there was only a spoon full left.
