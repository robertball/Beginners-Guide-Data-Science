Delicious.  Some minor changes to suit my personal tastes: One can beef broth, almost one can burgundy wine, the rest of the can, water. Rather than slicing, I chopped the carrots and celery in bigger chunks so they won't disintegrate in the crockpot and also added 2 big potatoes in 1" cubes.  To make up for extra carrots and the potatoes which weren't in the original recipe, I added 1 T soy sauce and additional 1 t worcestershire sauce and more black pepper.  I also used only 1/4 of an onion cut in big 2 inch pieces so it wouldn't turn to mush.  In the last half hour I added pearl onions.  For spices, I followed the recipe and then added sprinkles of cumin, savory, rosemary and parsley.   8-9 hours in the crockpot was just right for 2 lbs meat.  It really was a hearty, flavorful meal.
P.S. My husband thought this dish was okay.  He's not into large chunks of beef in a dish.

This is the best stew I've ever made.  I added cubed potatoes in the beginning, to make it bigger.  To thicken, I took the cover off the slow cooker for the last 30 minutes of cooking on high.  Served with french bread it was a very hearty meal.  Even my finicky kids and husband loved it.  Will definitely make this again.

My good friend is a wonderful cook and caterer. Her husband said that this was the best beef stew he has ever had which is quite a compliment. Tweeked it a little by chopping up everything in small cubes, addded 2 potatoes,a little cumin, rosemary and parsley, can of diced tomatoes, 1 T. soy, das of hot sauce, frozen peas, didn't have burgandy so used cooking cherry and added frozen peas at the end. Also used half beef broth as the liquid and a pack of onion soup mix.

I use this recipe, but substitute 3-4 small potatoes for the celery, and cook it on the stove on low for 3-4 hours rather than in a slow-cooker.  I usually serve it with fresh bread, sliced cheeses and sliced fruit.  Great winter meal!

This recipe is fantastic. . . with a few changes.  Some I took from other reviews - I added soy sauce, used beef broth from bouillon cubes instead of water and added cabbage.  I also didn't have bay leaves on hand so those were not in the stew.  I also found that the stew was too thin for my taste.  So halfway through cooking, I took part of the broth and thickened it as if I was making gravy until it reached a texture I preferred.  The final result was great.  I would definately make it again.

Very good - I added 4 cups of beef broth in place of the water, and also potatoes.  The best beef stew I've ever made.

I love this stew; it is wonderful for frozen snowy days.  When I make it I omit the bay leaves and cloves, and add a cup of chopped mushrooms, a leak, a can of garbanzo beans and a can of kidney beans, I also add the leftover flour from dredging to thicken the stew.  My family loves it, and we have found that it tastes even better the next day, as leftovers.

Now this is a hearty stew! I have never made stew until attempting this recipe...It was a family hit, even with my picky daughter who claims not to like vegetables had two servings! I tweaked the recipe a bit to satisfy everyone in the family.  I added quartered white potatoes, sliced fresh mushrooms and carrots.  I only used 1.5 stalks of celery because most of the family is not fond of the taste.  I omitted the salt, bay leaves and cloves and used a pouch of Bovril beef bouillion mix for more flavor.  I also added a little thyme, onion and garlic powder. The beef was tender and tasty,the vegetables and potatoes were cooked perfectly, and the broth was rich and savory, not watery and soup-like. I saw that other recipes required cornstarch to thicken the broth towards the end of cooking time, but this recipe produced a stew of excellent consistency.  I would have taken a picture but this dish didn't last long enough.

NOT FOR KIDS
This was an ok stew.  It was flavorful without making modifications.  Neither my husband nor I were fans of the clove flavor. My kids, very good eaters, did not like it.  I will stick with a more basic recipe with traditional seasonings in the future.  

This I would like to note...I found this recipe last minute and decided to use it based on the 5 star rating without reading the recipe reviews.  You should not give a recipe 5 stars if you made 5 adjustments to make it taste great.

This was perfect winter dinner food. I cooked this on high for 4 hours. I added two extra cloves of minced garlic, three red potatoes cut up into chunks, and added the celery to cook only for the last 1 1/2 hours, so it wouldn't get soggy & limp. Celery was overcooked anyway. Next time I'll add it 1 hour before it's to be served. The cloves add the tiniest hint of that certain special something, such a good flavor. I will be making this again!

This was so delicious and so easy.  Like another rater of this recipe, I too added cubed potatos about 45 minutes before it was done and it was the biggest hit with my family and friends.  I also added just a little extra salt, but I will be sure to make it over and over again!  Great for cool days.

I didn't like the sweet taste of this stew so I simply added one extra teaspoon of salt (2 teaspoons total) and it was almost as good as what mom used to make.  Great recipe for those who like to add their own favorite vegetables.

I used beef stock in place of half the water and added a pack of beef mushroom soup mix and diced potatoes. My family was getting impatient so near the end I threw everything in a pot and brought it to a boil on the stove and let it simmer and it was done in no time. I'll probably use less cloves next time, but other than that it was a great blend of spices. Simmering it at the end really helped thicken it up too. It was very good on a cold, snowy evening.

great stew! I made some modifications that worked great - replaced the water w/ 1 bottle of beer (honey brew - but I'm sure any kind of regular beer would work, too) and 2 cups of beef broth. also added a tablespoon of soy sauce and two tsp of minced garlic from a jar. I put the flour in a gallon zip lock bag and shook the meat cubes in it instead of "dredging" for less mess. 9 hours was plenty. I also added egg noodles which made it a bigger hit with my husband. Tasted even better the next day.

This was really, really good.  But not as good as my mom's. 

The only thing I did differently was add three cubed russet potatoes, because it's a crime against nature to not have beef stew with potatoes in it.  

I browned the beef on the stove and just cooked it all in the same pot.  It took about 1.5 hours until it was done.  I didn't have time for a crock pot.

Loved this stew.  Seemed more like a goulash without the potatos and served over noodles.  But it had a marvelous flavor.

Flavor was there, but only if you double the spices as other reviewers suggest. I started out following the recipe exactly, but after tasting it after a few hours of cooking it definitely needed more spice. Also added beef bouillon and potatoes. Very watery, so added flour to thicken. Would not make again.

Very Good!!  We added potatoes and thickened the broth with flour to make it heartier. Otherwise, followed exactly.  Tasted excellent!! We uses shoulder blade steak, and the meat was very tender.

This tasted like so much more work went into it than just throwing some easy items into the slow cooker! Very filling and yummy. Followed the recipe as is, but next time I might do what other reviewers suggested and sub beef broth for the water.

I took my first crack at stew with this recipe and was very pleased with the results. I loved the combination of spices, lemon juice and Worcestershire sauce. I had to use garlic powder and dried onion because I did not have fresh on hand. Also dissolved 2 bouillon cubes in the water for flavor. No Crockpot, so after browning the meat, I brought everything to a boil in a pot on the stove, then turned down to low heat and simmered for 2 hours. I added 3 cubed potatoes during the last half hour of cooking. They came out perfect. I think in the future I might add the carrots a little later as well, as they were a little on the soft side.

After having a can of beef stew last week my son announced that he wanted beef stew for his birthday dinner. I turned to allrecipes since I'd never made beef stew before, and I was not a bit disappointed in this recipe. I only made a couple minor changes one of which was to add 3 diced potatoes because I've never heard of stew without potatoes. The second thing I did different was that I marinated the meat in Worchestershire sauce overnight. Finally, rather than cooking it in the crockpot I did it on the stove. I probably cooked it about an hour after I had cooked the meat and added the remaining ingredients. The potatoes did get mushy so next time I will add those halfway through the cooking time. Coating the meat with the flour thickened the stew perfectly. Thank you for a great recipe that the whole family loved! I will be making this often!

This was OK, but WAY too watery for a stew.  I only used 3 cups of water, and thickened it up with more flour at the end of cooking and it was still not as thick as I would like stew to be.  I may make this again but  will use less water and will probably add potatoes.

I love this site because of the reviews, this is my first contribution so here goes: This stew is GREAT! As far as I can tell, its the same as my mom's recipe, (God rest her soul), that I somehow lost. The only changes I made were adding salt and pepper to the beef chunks before I breaded them in the flour, I added chunks of potato and I used canned beef broth instead of water. For those of you who find the soup too thin, make sure you use plenty of flour on the beef, and its OK to let a little extra flour sorta fall into the pan as you are browning the beef, then try to get it all into the pot and it will thicken the broth as it cooks.

After reading a few reviews I added 3 diced potatoes and a packet of gravy mix.  I cooked on high for 4 hours.  Didn't get to taste until the next day, but it was very good!!  My husband didn't get to try it until 2 days later and he said "tastes like another bowl"!!  He said you definately need to make this again.

Can't say it was the best, but it was OK.  I would've liked it a lot thicker.  It kind of had a sweet taste to it.  Next time I will leave out the sugar and also use some of the other suggestions.

I did as others mentioned and added beer, etc...also tried with egg noodles but they were mushy by the time we ate - would serve on them next time but not add them to the recipe.

Good.  For personal preference, we added barley, a little more water, sautéed mushrooms and less beef.  Would be great as is, and it was great w our small changes just to lighten it a bit.  Thank you.

Very tasty! I live in China at the moment, so most of the herbs and sauces are quite hard to find locally, but even without it is a very hearty warming meal. Extra broccoli and potatoes were a great addition. Some chili flakes and extra pepper helped, along with about 500mL of red wine for some body. I am really looking forward to trying it with all of the spices and sauces I want, but it was still very good and easy to change to your own taste.

I was really looking forward to a great tasting stew but didn't care for this at all. It smelled good cooking but it was way too watery. I used beef broth instead of water and that didn't help. It shows potatoes in the PICTURE of the stew but they are not mentioned in the recipe. That makes me wonder if other ingredients were left out as well. I was looking for something different but I guess I'll go back to my own beef stew recipe that yields a nice thick stew instead of a watery soup. I had to buy the cloves just for this recipe and they are not a cheap spice. It was a waste of money for a poor outcome. I'm glad to see so many enjoyed the recipe. I wish I could have been one of them. I'll be passing this stew on to my neighbors. Maybe they will enjoy it more.

This recipe was delicious. I used beef broth in place of the water and I also added my carrots and potatoes about 2 1/2 hrs into the cooking time to prevent them from being overcooked. My husband enjoyed it! I took some over to my parents house for them to try and now they want me to make them a pot!  This is the second recipe by Corwynn that I've tried and both were very, very good!

This was delicious and a great spin on beef stew. I've never added cloves or lemon juice before and it made a wonderful subtle difference. My only changes were braising the vegetables with the beef and adding mushrooms to it.

A very tasty recipe, but the ratio of meat to veggies was too high for me, even though I added a potato and some green beans. Will add even more veggies next time. Hubby requested I leave out the cloves in future. Will definitely make this again.

I love this stew recipe!  I add about a half-cup of red wine and about 2 teaspoons of organic beef stock powder for a little extra flavor.  I don't have a crockpot, so I cook it on low on the stove and it still turns out tender and delicious.

Now this is the best way to make stew.  I did thicken it with cornstarch.  I also added 1 beef bullion cubes and 4 or 5 small red potatoe wedges.  Whats a stew without potatoes.  Delicious!!!I will never again buy the pre-packaged dry stew mix.

As the others have submitted, best beef stew ever!  I do not like beef OR stew, and I loved it!  Added a can of crushed tomatoes (using the juice as part of the water), and 3 cubed potatoes.  I also thickened it at the end as it was too thin for my taste.  But DELICIOUS!

Whenever a BIG snow storm is predicted, as it was for today, I love to cook something that will warm up my husband and kids after they shovel.  I made this stew today with a few modifications and after supper my husband said "I think that was the best", I said "best I've ever made?" and he said "no, best I've ever had".  I added potatoes, I didn't have worcestershire so I used a little A1 Steaksauce, a few bouillon cubes and a splash of red wine. About 1 hour before it was done I whisked about 2 tbls of flour into a little milk and added it, it thickened up nice.  I'm sure I'll be making this alot over this long cold New Hampshire winter.

I was really disappointed at first because I thought it would be one of those "blah" dishes. By the time my husband came for dinner it had cooked all day in the slow cooker.  He said, "This is the best beef stew I've ever had- your mom could take some pointers from you!"  My mom makes a wonderful beef stew...it was the first time mine was better.  I added 1/2 jar Italian pasta sauce to the pot and it was excellent!

Made this stew according to the recipe with no changes. The flavor is a definite 5-star but I only gave it 4 stars because the stew is way too thin. It was more of a beef soup than a stew. Cooked it on low in my slow cooker for 6 hours. When I saw how watery it was, I mixed a tblsp of corn starch in a little water and stired it into the stew and let it go for another 30 minutes. It helped a little but was still too watery for me. I'd make this again (because the flavor is really good) but would try to do something to make it thicker.

Great recipe...I will try some of the other suggestions next time.  Would like it a little thicker.

This was a great stew. Smelled delicious all day. The things I did differently was omit the garlic and celery (didn't have any) and I added rosemary, corn for the crunch and color and some flour to thicken since I didnt brown the stew meat first. I will make this again soon.

Didn't thicken up like a stew at all... more like Beef Soup.  Flavor was good and smelled great cooking, but I ended up mixing in rotelle pasta noodles so it wasn't just all broth.

THIS WAS VERY TASTY BUT A LITTLE BLAND.  IT NEEDED SOMETHING WITH MORE ZAP.  I ADDED POTATOES TO MAKE IT MORE CHUNKY AND LESS RUNNY.

I used one lb. of beef instead of two, and added four russet potatoes (cubed). I liked the addition of the lemon juice and the clove. I was on a time crunch so after browning the meat and adding all the other ingredients I just put it in a 375 degree oven for about an hour (stirring half way through). Great meal for a cold or rainy day!

I rated this based on what I changed which wasn't too, too much. First, 4 cups water sounded blah so I went 1 1/2 cups beer (Keiths) and 2 cups broth.  No cloves or bay leaves. I used onion powder as I had no onions. I doubled Worcestershire sauce because I usually do.

The stew is a bit runny.  However, the beer makes this taste incredible.

I find stews blah but this has helped.

Just made this today with only a couple substitutions - beef broth instead of water and added 3 small potatoes. Very tasty, but next time I will eliminate the cloves and cut the bay leaves in half. Thanks for the recipe!

This was an excellent stew. I usually use a pressure cooker. This was a great alternative because of a busy day. I added potatoes for the last hour.

Needed more spices, salt or something.  I added potatoes also. The thickness was perfect. I cut the stew meat really small because my husband prefers it small. Everything was good, just needed that wow factor in spices. Not sure what to add though.

I made this on a cold, rainy fall day and what a comfort on such a day!  It was fantastic!  The recipe was great as it is although I added a about 1/3 cup of white wine and 4 medium potatoes.  I didn't have ground cloves but it tasted great without I also used 4 cups of beef broth instead of the water, which i think really enhanced the flavor and towards the end I did have to thicken it up from a soupy consistency to the "stew".  I intended to add peas but forgot and will add them next time because we will definantley have this again!  My sister made beef stew from another recipe on this site and she tasted mine and said that mine had a lot more flavor than hers and took the recipe!  I am glad i didn't add any tomatoes to it but next time I will add some sour cream which I think would be a good addition for a bit of creaminess.  A loaf of warm crusty bread was a splendid touch to this wonderful dish!!!

This was not a very good recipe.  My husband didn't like the cloves taste in it (neither did I), and there wasn't much to it.  It needed potatoes for sure, but that still wouldn't have helped much!  I did add some beef bouillion to the water to give it flavor, and had to thicken with corn starch once it was done so that it wasn't completely runny.  We will not be making this again.

I added potatoes to this recipe to make it into more of a meal, also added half teaspoon of celery salt and 2 oxo cubes and replaced the water with beef stock it was worth waiting 8 hours in the slow cooker anyway

This is the first time I made Beef Stew that hubby actually complemented me on.  I added about 8 quartered baby rose potatoes to the pot and used 2 cups beef broth instead of water. The sauce was outstanding!!!  A definite keeper.

This was fantastic!  I did make a few modifications, however.  I put the 4 cups of water, but I also threw in 2 cubes of beef bouillion with it.  I added a splash of sherry, a few squeezes of ketchup, frozen peas and 3 potatoes.  With those changes, this was the perfect stew.  Served with crescent rolls and we all were in heaven!  Thanks

This was great!! I didn't have a slow cooker,used a large pot,  just cooked it on low for 2-3 hours, until it was right. I used soy sauce, and only had about 1 1/2 pds of meat so I just "eyed" the rest of the ingredients. You really could add almost ant veggie you wanted to it. I added mushrooms, next time maybe green beans? So warm and yummy on a cold night. Great.

Loved it. I did add the potatoes as well.  I placed them on the very top of the ingrediant pile above the juices and they were perfectly cooked at the end. If you cook it on low for 11 hours (I did), it is a stew consistency (e.g no broth, just a thick brown gravy like substance that clings to vegetables and meet).

I'm not a big fan of beef stew, so I didnt care for this myself.  However my boyfriend loved it.  Worth a try if you like beef stew.  I did have to add a bit more flour to get the sauce to thicken. I will probably make this again for him in the future.

I wish I'd read the other reviews before trying this recipe. The stew came out quite thin - I guess I was hoping the flour used to brown the beef would have thickened things up a little. Also, seemed somewhat bland, but that could be due to all the salt included in everyday packaged foods. I would try this recipe again, though, making the changes others did.

This was the best stew I've ever made.  I also used 4c. beef broth.  I didn't use the bay leaves, paprika or cloves b/c I didn't have them.  DH and my children loved it!  Thanx.

Unbelievably bland.  Only changes I made were to add 1 potato and sub broth for 2 cups of the water.  I even took the time to flour and brown the beef.  Major disappointment.

This is by far the best beef stew recipe I've ever had.  I think the ground cloves are the secret ingredient.  I add potatoes but otherwise keep the recipe as is.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was really easy and really good.  I mostly followed the original recipe, with a few additions based on what my family likes and the suggestions of other reviewers (the addition of potatoes, beef broth, and soy sauce).  I cooked it on high for 5-6 hours in the crockpot and it was terrific.  I will most definitely make this again.

This was very good!  I added potatoes and used some of the other suggestions, like soy sauce, from others.  I am going to add curry powder to what little I have leftover and serve over rice.  Yum!

Love this recipe. I seasoned meat with garlic powder, dredged in flour then browned in a little vegetable oil in my pressure cooker for 30 minutes. After releasing pressure, added stew vegetables and other ingredients for additional 7 minutes. Transferred stew into casserole pan the thickened with cornstarch to my liking. YUMMM,

I did a different take on this recipe by making it vegetarian (crazy I know!!!). I have to say this stew came out superb! I used the beef substitute from Trader Joe's (I'm sure seitan would work just as well). I sauteed the "meat" with rosemary and butter to start and then added it to the crockpot. The only other change I made was to add 1 vegetable bouillon along with the water. I was amazed on how adaptable this recipe was and how hearty and comforting it turned out.  Thanks for sharing!

I have a question for "Skillet photo #3" How did you get your stew so dark a delicious looking? I could eat the photo. Do you have any tips or tricks? I do not like a stew with allot of liquid and yours looks like what I am looking for.

I found the spices were a good start but it needed way more. I made the recipe in 1/2 the time and had to add thyme, soy sauce, bouillon, rosemary. Also I added potatoes in the last hour, and right before serving I added some canned peas for some sweet contrast. The result was great.

This is a good base recipe for this stew but I added sweet peas, potatoes, spinach and red pepper. I found this stew to look more like a soup.  I had to add cornstarch to thicken it.

A good base recipe, but made some changes:  - No cloves! - Beef brother instead of water - Add potates - Pinch of rosemary, parsley, basil, thyme - 1 cup of favorite spaghetti sauce - Worcestershire to taste - Lowry's seasoned salt instead of salt/sugar - 4 slides of chopped sauteed bacon - Brown meat in bacon fat, then deglaze - Add cornstarch slurry for desired thickness Overall impressions:  Great base recipe, but a little on the under-seasoned side.   The combination of tomato sauce worcestershire, and paprika provide a nice balance of flavor with a bite.  Reminded me a bit of a Manhattan clam chowder broth, without the clams.

First time I've ever made beef stew and this is was exactly the flavor I was looking for! I was looking to get as many vegetables as possible so I also added peas, corn, spinach, green beans and potatos. And I replaced half of the water with beef stock.

Great classic stew recipe. I added 2 large cubed potatoes and 1 jumbo cubed sweet potato. Also used beef stock instead of water. Turned out great except it didn't take anywhere near 10 hours on low. Even with large chunks of potatoes it was completely done in less than 7 hours.

Really great recipe!  I doubled it and think I'm going to be really glad I did; we're having friends for dinner and I think we're going to really plow through this dish! Perfect for a chilly, rainy or snowy day.  I appreciated suggestions from other reviewers and incorporated some of the ideas like adding potatoes, tossing in about a tsp soy sauce, and thickening a bit if it was too soupy (mine was, but I created a roux on the stove top and incorporated it to solve that problem).  My husband doesn't really like tomatoes in his stew, so I didn't follow that reviewer suggestion, however, I DID toss in about 1 cup of tomato sauce that I had leftover in the fridge (which could account for the soupier consistency).  I also added about 1 to 1 1/2 c of frozen peas just about 30-40 minutes before turning off the crock pot.  The combo of the paprika, cloves and lemon are really interesting and I think they probably account for the sort of unusual taste of this stew.  I'll definitely make this one again!  AWESOME!

I thought the recipes was great and made a few changes.  I added 4 bouillon cubes with the 4 cups of water, 1/2 cup of mushrooms and added 2 medium potatoes two hours into to cooking so the potatoes would not be mushy. In addition, I reserved the remaining flour and used the last two hours of cooking to thicken the broth. My husband and I liked it so well that we didn't have leftovers.

This was a good soup recipe. I added corn, two potatoes, and four peices of bacon. Since I didn't have worcestershire sauce so I actually opted for soy sauce and A1 mixture, and it really was good. I made corn bread to go with it and it was a great cold day dinner.

Made this recipe for the first time today and was very happy. The only things I did different was add a squeeze of ketchup and partly cooked white potatoes added halfway in. The stew was perfectly thick but I added flour just in case. It was not needed though. My son loved it.

Very easy recipe.  Can't say I followed it to a "T", since I never do.  Threw in whatever spices we had in the cupboard, added a little extra sugar and a little less Worcestershire sauce.  It went great with the Beer Bread I made.  Husband LOVED it.

This beef stew was a hit at my christmas party. I added some vegetable soup mix, but otherwise followed the recipe. I allowed it to cook in the slow cooker for atleast 10 hours, and the meat melted in your mouth. You can't go wrong with this recipe.

The addition of ground cloves made this pleasantly different, however it was more a soup than a stew.  I would definitely reduce the beef broth to 3 cups.  I cooked this only 4 hrs on high in the crockpot - maybe a longer cooking time would have thickened up the broth a little, but for once the vegetables did not dissintegrate into the broth. I will make this stew again, but I will rotate with other stew recipes.

The best of the best.  We were still talking about how good it was 2 hours later.  I have 3 kids 5,7,and 9 they all had seconds.  The only change I made was to add a boulion cube to 2 cups of the water and I did add 3 potatoes.  Enjoy this is great!

Awesome stew recipe and quite easy to make.  Could be better with potatoes or rice added.  Husband loved it.

All the spices in this were so complimenting! I used left over beef from a pot roast and cut down the water and used the left over juices as well.

Very good!  I added a bunch of stuff to it like potatoes, barley, soy sauce, and more pepper.  I also just used leftover beef that I had, so I skipped the first step.  Still delish!

This was pretty good. I used some beef broth & red wine to replace some of the water. I also added some potatoes. Still it was a little bland.

This was a satisfying meal and I will make it again.  I took the advice of other reviewers and substituted broth for the water.  I also added a can of garbanzo beans, as another reviewer suggested, and added fresh mushrooms.  Definitely keep the ground cloves; they add depth to the dish.

This stew is simple to make and delicious. The meat was so tender too . I only made a few adjustments. I used a little bit less than the 1/8tsp of cloves , not knowing if it would be too strong. I used 2 C of beef broth with 2 cups water. I added a few shakes of Lawry salt and Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute.  I meant to add potatoes but forgot so will add them next time. I would also thicken the gravy as it was a bit soupy.  It was a hit with my husband and college aged son. Will def make again

Excellent! I used this recipe but had to add quite a bit of cornstarch to get it to thicken up, I also added 1 can of brown gravy to the mix!

Somewhat bland in my opinion, although I am a chili head. Added potatoes like many others, but they need to be partly cooked prior to doing so as they took forever to cook...
