Oh wow.  This is so simple, and so brilliant.  I just made some with a handful of frozen strawberries instead of caramel sauce.  Thank you for sharing an idea that has brought frozen treats back to our allergen free kitchen!!!

Amazing! I used a low cal caramel dessert in place of caramel sauce (all I had on hand). This will be my go to frozen treat from now on.

Made this just as directed and it is so good! My daughter and I each had 2 servings. Just make sure you have really ripe bananas or it might not taste that great. Our was perfect though. An easy Summer treat that really is pretty guilt-free.

Delicious and no quilt! And no more pile of frozen bananas in my freezer! I happen to have a jar of dulce de leche. A milk caramel making it quite decadent!
