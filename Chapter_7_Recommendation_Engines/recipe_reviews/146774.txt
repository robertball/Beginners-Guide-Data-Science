I made this recipe for a Father's Day gathering.  I followed the recipe exactly except for one exception. I used heated Smucker's Strawberry jelly instead of the starberry glaze. Also, I found a sugar free angel food cake while I was at the store.  This recipe turned out delicious and looked as tho I had spent a lot of time working on it when I didn't. Because my family is small, I used two 9 inch square glass pans. The Smuckers jelly worked very well and the only change I would make is to make more of the cream cheese filling.  You can bet I will be making this very easy and mouth wateringly delicious dessert quite often. I plan to try this with peaches and other fruit when strawberry season is over.

I didn't have Splenda, so I substituted powdered sugar. I used a reduced calorie & fat angel food cake and whipped topping. Next time I'll try a reduced fat cream cheese too.

I gave this 4 stars because it was heavier than I thought, next time I'll probably only use one block of cream cheese and extra cool whip. I used strawberries and blackberries and that part was great!

A lovely cool dessert that doesn't require baking.  I found the dessert a little heavy; will try it with one package of cream cheese, as others have suggested.  Easy to make, can be low-cal, low-fat if you so choose.

This is a great dessert, just too much cream cheese, I used 1 package and it was much lighter. also you can use the low fat cream cheese and cool whip lowering the fat content significantly.

This was really good!  Easy to make and a light dessert.  I got rave reviews on Mother's Day!  If it hadn't been eaten so fast I would have taken a picture to post!

This is the best strawberry dessert ever! I am continually asked for the recipe.  I do, however, change a few things:  2 qts of strawberries and just enough glaze to cover the strawberries (about 1/4 of jar).  Yum.
