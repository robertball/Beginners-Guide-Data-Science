From the previous person who rated it on 10/31 05, i did one more thing, i put in the pumpkin spice as well as the cinnamon, but intead of milk, use heavy cream, all my customers love it, and want more, I put in 5 inch pie shells to bake, and serve indivially, pipe out whip cream on the crust with a pastry bag, drizzle chocolate over that, and you have a dessert that rates world's Best.  thanks

This pie was great.  It was very simple, I had everything I needed on hand.  I did use 2 tsps. of pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon.  It was really one of the best pies I've made.

I run a Prechool and Kindergarten program and for a fundraising project we choose to make pumpkin pies. We chose this recipe because the ingredients were simple and most items we arleady had at the center. We sold 50 pies and had rave reviews from our families who bought the pies! Many people even asked for the recipe! The only change we made was to add pumpkin pie spice to the recipe! Yummy!

This was very good; however, I don't think it deserves the name "the world's best". Will probably make it again and like the fact it calls for regular milk. Still like the old "Libby's pumpkin pie" recipe best!

I've NEVER baked a pumpkin pie before!  This came out BEAUTIFULLY!!!  I used a Marie Callender frozen pie crust... it was perfect.  I did cut down on the milk per other reviewer's suggestion's to 3/4 and even used some half and half that I wanted to use up in my fridge.  This is an AMAZING pumpkin pie.  If you want to cut the sugar you can, but my hubby likes it just the way it is.  This pie will impress!!

rating given is due to changes i made to recipe.  
using a deep dish pie pan, i used 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup milk, 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 each ground ginger, allspice, nutmeg, cloves (i like my pumpkin spicy).  also didnt use a pie crust, i wanted crustless and turned out just fine.
filling is still too sweet.  next time i'll use 1/2 cup each brown and white sugar.  consistency isnt as firm as i'd like but its fair.

Turned out Great!  I usually do not like all of the spices in pumpkin pie, this one kept it simple.  I even got compliments from my husbands grandma!! I usually get, this is good.. but not like Memas! (grandma)

I agree with the past reviewers.  Too much filling for 1 pie, but not enough for 2.  Also, the older folks found it too sweet, but the younger people thought it was fine.  No need to add more sweetness with whipped cream topping.  FYI, works with homemade pumpkin puree, just need to cook a little longer.

It needed more spice!  I'm lactose intolerant, so I liked that I could substitute lactose free milk and enjoy it instead of being sick or skipping over it.  To ensure it 'set' (I used homemade pumpkin puree) I added a heaping tablespoon of cornstarch to the eggs before I added them in.  I made a mousse and didn't use a pie crust.  I also used 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar.

I was skeptical, and only made this recipe because I was missing key ingredients to make my normal pumpkin pie.  It turned out wonderfully with modifications.  I used 1 cup sugar, and it was still very sweet.  I think it would be disgusting with the full amount of sugar.  I also cut the milk to 3/4 cup and used a deep dish pie crust.

This was my first attempt to make pies from "scratch".  My 26 year old son loves pumpkin pie and came to me today and said that this was the best he had ever had.  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for sharing it!

The filling has an okay flavor, but the recipe as-is makes entirely too much for one pie! It also takes a long time to firm up. I'll probably try a different recipe next time.

This turned out a gooey, bland mess. I made it EXACTLY like it says. It might be that I live in the mountains, and count it that this just doesn't work for high altitude... but I don't know how that would effect the blandness... I cooked it for 2 hours until it started to burn and it was still not set up...

My first from scratch pumpkin pie. And it was incredible! I was worried when I used skim milk and only 1/4 cup whole (the recipe does not specify so i wondereded if whole was implied). I also used 1 yolk vs 2 (2 whites). I made fresh pumpkin puree vs. canned. It was delicious! I did add a little nutmeg, allspice and ginger.

I've never made pumpkin pie before so I don't have anything to compare this to, but this was pretty good.  My kids loved it.  I used 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice instead of the cinnamon as someone suggested, and the flavour was great.  I chose this recipe because it called for milk instead of evaporated or condensed milk like other recipes did, and I happened to have all of the ingredients.  My only problem was that I had way too much filling for one pie shell, so I divided the filling between two pie shells.  This made for two thin pies - next time I'll use one deep-dish pie shell.

This was my first ever pumpkin pie, and my daughter and I made two of these with a few of the reviewer's suggestions and they turned out great. We used heavy cream instead of milk, used 3 tablespoons of cinnamon plus 1 of pumpkin pie spice, and then at the end threw in just a few pinches of cloves, and the flavor is amazing.

This really is the best pumpkin pie I have ever tasted. I used fresh pumpkin puree, not the canned stuff, so I did have to cook it about 15 minutes longer and it took a while in the fridge to get firm. Also I get pretty heavyhanded with the cinnamon, this pie has excellent flavor!

First time I've made Pumpkin Pie and was pleased with it! My 9 year old son ate almost half the pie himself so I know he really enjoyed it! I will make this pie again but will use other suggestions of adding pumpkin pie spice to it! :)

This came out very good, how ever I think it should call out for a deep dish pie crust. Like the previous reviews it was too much for 1 pie but not enough for 2. Still it was very good.

I wish I would have read the reviews first! WAY too much milk and sugar! Unfortunately I was already all-in before I realized this mistake. The mixture was so runny I thought "this can't be right?" There was also way more than enough for the pie so I ended up tossing the rest (what a waste). I think it would be absolutely perfect with 3/4 cup milk or cream and the brown sugar ONLY! Seriously, you really don't need that much sugar.

This is an amazing pumpkin pie recipe that is easy and simply GREAT. Half of us don't even like pumpkin pie and we love it anyway. My 13 year old daughter has made this 3 times for dessert.  One filling makes 2 pies.

I followed the advice of using 3/4 milk (but I used nonfat) and 3/4 cup white sugar as well as the 1/2 cup brown sugar. I also used egg beaters in place of 2 eggs and 2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon.  I also used the Marie Callendar pie crust.  These pies came out perfect!  They went in a flash on Thanksgiving.

this was just okay. very very sweet and it made far too much filling for one pie crust, even when i cut the milk down to 3/4c. i wouldn't call this world's best.

I made this pie, and blindly trusted it because of the 4.5 star rating. It turned out TOO SWEET. I don't know why it didn't set off any alarms to me that this recipe uses 1.5 cups of sugar to just under 2 cups of pumpkin puree. I didn't realize how wrong that seems until I tasted the filling.

This recipe is great! I followed it exactly, making two pies. It's easy to make and almost all the ingredients are already in the cabinet. Though, I have to admit as many others have, that it is too sweet (in addition to a lot of filling)! I will definitely be cutting down on the sugar. I always appreciate reviews that follow the recipe exactly first before adjusting measurements to their tastes. As I have followed the recipe, I hope I can spare my thoughts on it. I am definitely one with a sweet tooth and this recipe calls for too much sugar.

I chose this recipe after reading others, because it uses milk, and I don't usually stock condensed milk or evaporate milk.  I also like it when I can control the amount of sugar in the recipe.  I followed Kleerae's suggestions of cutting down on sugar and milk, and I really like the slightly soft texture of the pie.

I chose this recipe because I had all the ingredients (called for regular milk). I followed the instructions exactly, and added 1/4 tsp ginger powder. The taste is fine. I'm not too thrilled with the consistency--it's way too soft/mushy. However, my husband didn't mind, he asked for seconds. I think it was because there was too much milk. If I made this again, I would only put in 3/4 cups milk maximum. I couldn't fit it all into the pie plate, I had to toss the rest (3/4 cups). I'd like to experiment on some of the other recipes now.

Wasn't as sweet as everyone says...I loved it! I don't like spice in my pumpkin pie, so this recipe was perfect! I followed the recipe exactly as it is. And I am a big time sweet tooth!! Yum! My husband loved it as well.
