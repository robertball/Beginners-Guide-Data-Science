Forget the meetings and unexpected guests, make these addicting little things for yourself. I had leftover black beans so I refried them. If you do decide to make these for a meeting, company or unexpected guests, not to worry, they are just as good at room temperature. I'll be making these again, maybe with refried pinquito beans and use pepper jack cheese.
