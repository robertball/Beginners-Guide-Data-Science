This is one of my most favorite ways to make green beans. I like to add a little finely minced onion to the skillet with the garlic as well. I usually double this recipe because my family inhales it.

Great base recipe for fresh green beans; the simmer, drain, saute method helps maintain crispness and color.  Started garlic in the butter before adding beans back in. Subbed fresh cracked black pepper and juice of one small lemon at the end instead of dry mix, and it was phenomenal!

I really like this method of green beans!
I have to say I stepped it up by adding chicken bouillon to the water while parboiling the beans, and then using both garlic powder and fresh garlic when sauteeing in the butter.  This is a staple in our home.

Use real garlic -- dry, minced garlic didn't do anything for the green beans.

I do it a bit differently. I steam the beans for about 15 minutes. Then, in skillet I saute garlic and butter (I love garlic...put in as much as you re comfortable with...and when they are sauteed add the beans to the skillet with garlic, butter, and salt/pepper....I suppose lemon pepper works as well...mix up, for a few minutes, and serve. SO good!

These were just ok.  I used real garlic and more than called for-glad I did.  A few pinches of lemon pepper doesn't add substantial flavor, nor were they all that buttery.

I didn't really follow the directions, so I'll rate what I actually made.

It's hard to go wrong with this combination of flavors.  I never was a big fan of powdered lemon pepper, so I used one fresh lemon with a double recipe, using fresh french green beans. Like another reviewer, I added sauteed red onion to the recipe.  First of all, I blanched the French green beans in boiling water for 8 minutes, and removed them to a colander... then dumped the pot of water. In the same pot, I sauteed a medium red onion, slivered, in  the butter for about 6 minutes. I added garlic paste (the fresh kind in a tube), along with the zest of the lemon. Sauteed for another 2 minutes and added the juice of the lemon to the pot.  Reduced for a few minutes, then added the green beans to the pot, and sauteed for another few minutes.  Add pepper to taste...no salt needed.

I made these for Thanksgiving. The day before I parboiled the beans for 5 minutes, then cooled them by flushing with cold water & put them in the fridge. On Thanksgiving, I sauteed the beans with butter then added the garlic and cooked til fragrant. Super easy & super yummy!

I liked this, as did the 14 other people at the Valentine's dinner I just came home from. Steamed the beans to the desired degree of crunch, washed under cold water, then put into the pan with the topping. Didn't have lemon pepper so used a bit of lime zest and lime juice. Really good.

Delicious!  I didn't have any lemon pepper but the dish didn't seem to be the worse for it.  A great way to add some veggies into any diet.  Next time I think I may add some lemon juice for a little extra flavor.

Buttery Garlic Green Bean Haiku: "Totally five stars! Just as easy as can be, what a great side dish!" So I used frozen green beans and followed the rest of the recipe, adding a squirt of fresh lemon b4 serving. Perfect, lightly-seasoned, buttery green bean goodness!

Cooked our green beans about 7 minutes as we like them a little softer.  Guesstimated on the garlic--approximately 4 cloves.  Needed a bit extra salt and pepper, but on the whole no complaints.

Just tried it. I cooked mine longer because I prefer softer textured green beans. I used fresh cloves of garlic as well as a little bit of minced garlic and browned it (almost tasted like bacon bits). I also used a bit of sea salt. Came out delicious!

This was a major hit on Thanksgiving. Although I didn't use the lemon pepper and I added fresh sliced mushrooms. Also cooked them about 10 minutes, 5 wasn't enough....

This was so easy and delicious.  I was looking for a new green bean recipe to use as a side dish for Thanksgiving.  We have so many casseroles that we need a simple vegetable side - and this recipe delivers just that!  I used frozen french green beans (the thinner haricots verts) and placed them in a large pot with  1.5 cups  of boiling water (because I was tripling the recipe and the beans were frozen so I didn't want to run out of water).  I kept a close eye on them so they wouldn't be overcooked.  At the same time, as other reviewers suggested, I melted the butter on the stove in a separate pan and then added the garlic to cook for a few minutes.  Once the green beans were crisp-tender, I drained the water and added the butter/garlic mixture and also added the zest and juice of one lemon.  I tossed the green beans in the butter and lemon and then seasoned to taste with some seasoning salt (I don't have any lemon pepper seasoning and didn't want to buy some just for the recipe so I followed what some other reviewers did).  My family raved about the green beans.  They were delicious.  My teenage son said "these are the best green beans I have ever tasted".  That is a big compliment!  Great recipe - what makes it a hit are the flavors of butter, lemon and garlic so I'm sure it is just as delicious as written.  Thank you!

Simple recipe for your every day green beans that is kicked up a notch. The lemon pepper on the green beans gave it a bright flavor profile that my family really liked.   I ended up using 1-1/2 tsps to get the taste I wanted.  I personally thought 3 tbs. of butter was too much.  I will make again, but, probably cut that amount in half and add more if needed.

Easy way to make great green beans!  I bought mine in a “steam bag”. Rinsed andcooked as directed and quickly found out that someone had stolen my lemon pepper.  I used a splash of soy sauce instead...they were wonderful this way also.  The green beans themselves could have been my supper.

Loved this. I am on a lo sodium diet so used unsalted butter and no salt. Didn't miss it a bit with the strong garlic and lemon flavoring. This will become one of my go-to recipes.

This recipe is super minimal but so rich in flavor! I added two extra cloves of garlic (I’m a garlic addict) and I added a shallot as well and it came out great! This was also super quick and easy to make! You can’t mess this up!

I've made this recipe for a while but never tried it with the lemon pepper before. I also brown the garlic for about 30 seconds in the hot butter before I add the beans. I also use dried or fresh basil instead of the lemon pepper because I had it that way at a local restaurant and loved the flavor. Quick easy recipe that looks beautiful plated  next to a piece steak or chicken

These green beans were definitely tasty!  I used jarred garlic instead of fresh and simmered the green beans 10 minutes instead of 5, as we like ours less crispy.

A very simple recipe. I used minced garlic and added sliced almonds at the end. Sautéed with the beans. Everyone loved!

I fixed this green bean dish as one of the sides for our thanksgiving dinner,  I added a little less garlic so as not to over power but for a regular dinner I would add it all.  This was a nice fresh color too.  I get so tired of the same old "gloppy"
green bean casseroles, this was a refreshing change.

These turned out great!  I steamed my beans first and then sautéed four cloves of minced garlic in about 4 TBSP of butter before adding the steamed green beans.  Instead of lemon pepper seasoning, I added a tsp of Creole seasoning and continued to cook for a couple more minutes.  They were excellent!

I've made similar green bean side dishes, but I've never pre-boiled the beans before. This seemed to make all the difference as the went from "just OK" to being a big hit with the family. Plus, this is such a super-simple recipe!

I made this for three people and it was way too much. I would probably half it for smaller meals. I think I would add more garlic and lemon pepper as the beans felt underspiced.

Made this tonight. Only changes: didn't have lemon pepper, used garlic pepper instead and zest of one fresh picked lemon. Added another garlic clove and used sea salt. Very good, but too much butter (and we love butter); next time I'll cut down by half. Will make again and use fresh lemon zest again.

We did as one user suggested and added onion when melting the butter and garlic, then added the beans. This was good but needed more garlic and definitely needed the lemon pepper.

I cheated and used frozen, but will certainly use fresh when summer comes.  Couldn’t really taste the lemon, but maybe my “pinches” were off.  Would use more next time to see.  Still delicious and different.

Yum!!
I often use this as a base recipe and it never disappoints! I do tend to 'cheat' by microwaving the green beans with a bit of water for 3 mins or so before adding them to the sautéed garlic (and red onion on occasion). I use regular salt & pepper and get the lemon flavour from a T of lemon juice. Next time, I'll use some lemon zest as well! I also tend to add a good dash of cayenne pepper when I want to kick it up a little! The family enjoys it every time, even my picky eater!

I made them the family loved them.  The only thing I didn't do was add the lemon pepper because I didn't have any. I sprinkled parmesan cheese on top before serving.  I have already made them again.

Delicious! I had to change my diet drastically for health reasons and I refuse to eat anything that tastes like grass. This is healthy and so incredibly delicious! I’ll never go back to canned green beans again!

I tried this verbatim hoping the result would be similar to those at my local Asian buffet. They were very good but not a great match for those at the buffet which were crunchier and more flavorful. They may have used a different bean, unsure. I'll have to pay better attention the next time we eat at our buffet to try to better discern the difference. I'll definitely make these again, perhaps with some minor tweeks such as a touch of salt and ...

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I cooked them for about 10 minutes as we like them a bit softer. I didn't have lemon pepper spice, so I used black pepper and a couple of TBS of lemon juice.

I put in much more garlic but it still didn't come through very strongly. Next time I will put in the garlic sooner instead of waiting until the very end like the recipe suggests. Still, they were a hit at my potluck dinner; they were almost completely eaten!

I loved this. It is so quick and makes a nice change from steamed green beans (my usual method of cooking green beans). My only caution would be to taste after adding lemon pepper and before adding salt. Turns out my lemon pepper has salt for the first ingredient, so there was no need for me to add salt at all. I will definitely make this again--and again and again.

I made these tonight to audition them for Thanksgiving..They are outstanding!  I steamed them until crisp-tender then sautéed them with the rest of the ingredients..I added a little splash of the steaming water to the beans to keep from browning the garlic.  It evaporated quickly and the beans were perfect.  Everyone loved them. They will definitely be served on Turkey Day!  Thanks for the recipe!

I had this dish at a Chinese restaurant recently, and it was delicious, so I tried to replicate it.  However, I didn’t have any lemon pepper, so I just used plain pepper.  Since this turned out pretty good, but not excellent, I’ll get the lemon pepper and try again.

This was perfect for my fresh beans from the garden. I didn't have lemon pepper but I squeezed a bit of fresh lemon onto the beans when cooking. It was perfect!

Great recipe. Super easy and delicious. I customized it a bit just to my tastes. I added extra garlic a big tablespoon of minced garlic and some sprinkles of granulated chicken seasoning for some saltiness and flavor.  The cook was perfect and was it hit for dinner.

I have made these a few times and they are always good. I had left over parboiled green beans so just used those. I added the last of a red onion, thin sliced and a bit of red bell for color, also thinly sliced and threw in a tad of red pepper flakes with the garlic. Great way to help use up the leftover veggies!

Made it exact except I didn't have lemon pepper. Just used ground black pepper. Very good. I wasn't expecting to to be so good since it is so basic. But they were very good. Will make again and try some variations.

Thanks for sharing! I didn't follow your recipe exactly, but they turned out super delicious! I steamed the string beans, melted the butter (only used 2 tbsp) and let it simmer with the garlic. Then I added the beans and tossed them. After that I sprinkled lemon pepper generously and a dash of salt. I think the recipe could do without the salt, but that's just one woman's opinion.

For those who are commenting about the use of garlic and how they used fresh: you people do realize you can mince fresh garlic, right? The recipe did not say to use jarred or dried garlic.

Really good! I didn’t keep the beans in the water until it boiled and instead did for just about 8 min on high then cooked by following the rest of the recipe until I liked how they tasted.

I've made this twice.  Excellent both times.
Very minimal seasonings on the original so you can really taste the green beans.
Second time, I used chicken bouillon cube in water with some white pepper.. cooked the beans and onions about 15 minutes until most of the liquid was gone and they were tender.  Then I added the butter and kept the heat pretty high and added the garlic after the butter began to brown slightly.. then a generous sprinkle of lemon pepper seasoning..
The garlic flavor is nice and strong since it's not cooked very long and you get a beautifully nutty brown butter flavor.  I prefer my green beans a little softer so this works perfectly.
 I will make the adjusted recipe again soon.. very, very good.

This is a great base.  Instead of lemon pepper, I used a lemon, zested it and squeezed half of it over the beans at the end.  In addition I added 1-2 tsp of crushed red pepper, trust me.  It brings it to another level!!

Buttery Deliciousness.  I have made this several times.  I don't bother boiling the green beans; I just melt the butter in a skillet, cover, and stir occasionally.  The key is to use a large enough skillet so that everything is in a single layer.  I have also added onions and/or peppers if I want to use them up. Always a hit.

Excellant! I didn't have fresh green beans but used  2 bags of frozen petite green beans which I microwaved till just al dente then added to the pan. They were gone in a flash and everyone wanted more.  Definitely a quick wonderful way to cook green beans.

Delicious!  Steamed the green beans for 10 minutes.  Sauteed the garlic with chopped round onion in ghee then added the steamed green beans.  It was superlicious!  Ate it with cripsy fish fillets recipe.

Great recipe; my dinner guests all enjoyed it. I forgot to blanch the beans so I threw some water into the pan and let the beans steam for about 5 mins, then continued to cook as the recipe states. The beans turned out perfectly-with a light, crisp bite but not undercooked.

To save last minute prep I steamed the green beans. Right before serving I warmed with the butter and garlic. Worked well for me

I make something somewhat similar to this only my garlic is bumped up and lightly cooked beforehand and my other seasoning is Garlic and Herb Salt Free Seasoning. I never cover my fresh veggies with water I always use lower sodium chicken broth or stock and even then they are never "covered". My family loves the veggies cooked this way and when I try another they ask me why.

Our family loved these!   I have a husband who avoids anything green if he can.   He ate these, and said they were the best he's prob. had.  I didn't have lemon pepper, so used real lemon.   Yum!

This recipe is great. I thought I had lemon pepper and I didn't, so I used adobo with pepper. I also took someone's advice and added onion.
I usually don't like green beans or onions but I couldn't stop eating them. Sooo good!

This was delicious. Though instead of 2 pinches, it was more like 2 tsps (I accidentally opened the wrong part of the cap while in a hurry). I thought it would be too strong but it was yummy.

Good but not as flavorful as I had hoped. but not bad. I will try again, maybe a little lemon zest for punch at the end and more onion. Thanks for a different take on green beans!

This recipe is delicious. In my house we eat clean. The simple tweak was to take  out the butter and salt. I used  1/2 tsp of lemon pepper and it is delicious. It’s definiely on my meal prep rotation. Thank you for sharing!!!!

I didn't have lemon pepper on hand. So I added some lemon zest and juice of half a lemon.  It turned out wonderful!!

Green beans are not my favorite vegetable. This was quick and easy, but I think needs more seasoning. However, it gets 5 stars for using butter instead of margarine.

simple recipe - the whole family liked it and they normally don't like green beans!  I didn't have lemon pepper  so I used regular pepper and added some lemon and herb seasoning I had on hand.

Pretty easy and tasty. I boiled longer than 5 minutes as my daughter doesn’t like green beans too crispy.

This is the way the Chinese food buffet makes their string beans and I LOVE how mine came out.

Two things: I didn't have fresh garlic so I put 1/4 tsp of dried garlic in about 3 tbsp water and let it sit for 20minutes while I boiled the green beans. After draining the green beans I put them in the pan with the rehydrated garlic AND the water it had been sitting in and added the butter and a half tsp of lemon juice and sauteed them until the water evaporated then I sprinkled salt and pepper over them and viola! They were PERFECT!

I doubled the recipe for our large Christmas gathering. I heard people say that these were the best green beans they’ve had. Perfect texture, slightly crunchy but not too much. The garlic added a perfect pop of flavor. Super easy too.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it's definitely a keeper. Used turkey stock instead of water and minced garlic from a jar. Tasted great and was super easy.

Very good! Salt was the first ingredient listed in my lemon pepper seasoning, so I did add a little salt later after tasting it. This is good as-is, but I can see sauteeing onion and mushrooms with this, too.

These turned out so GOOD! Only things I did differently was to cook the beans in chicken broth instead of water and I cooked them a lot longer because I like my green beans extra tender. I probably cooked them about 15 minutes or so before draining the broth and adding the butter. One of my new favorite side dishes!

Quick, easy and delicious!! I used garlic paste only because I ran out of fresh garlic and it was delicious. I really like this cooking method.

This was great !! Picked young beans from the garden so they were really fresh. I added sliced mushrooms while the beans cooked and thought it was great. I have made this twice.
Thank you.

Very good and easily to make. This dish went well with the lemon buttered salmon I made but it would go with almost anything. I will definitely make it agian.

So GOOD! Didn't have lemon pepper but after reading reviews, added pepper, lemon zest and squeezed lemon juice at the last moment.  Also we use smart balance a lot instead of butter. Definitely a repeat!!!

these were really good. i added about a tablespoon of extra butter, an extra clove of garlic or two, and a few extra pinches of lemon pepper. so basically extra everything. would a bit bland if i made it how the recipe called for. i also added a bit of garlic salt which improved the flavor by far. the timing is waaaay off. it says they take 20 minutes to make but mine took like an hour or so. i guess that might be okay if you like your green beans crunchy and undercooked.

I love the way this is prepared.  It reminds me of the green beans served at a chinese restaurant.  However, my family did not like the lemon flavor.  I definitely will prepare this again using pepper only.

I usually do my green beans out of the can.  In an effort to cook fresher foods, I tried this recipe.  I followed exactly and my husband raved about how delicious they are.  I would highly recommend trying because it is so simple to make, but super yummy!

Good base recipe if you want basic green beans.  It just didn't quite do it for me flavor-wise, so I added a Tbsp of Penzey's Mural of Flavor seasoning and that did the trick.

I ended up boiling the green beans on medium-high instead of medium-low for about 15, maybe 20 minutes and added a few strips of bacon cut into slices after the butter and garlic. Overall, I was pleased with the result, but it needs a kick or to be served with something strong/powerful, otherwise it gets a bit boring. Overall, great, buttery flavor, just the right amount of butter. I didn't use lemon pepper, preferring normal pepper, so maybe that gives it an interesting flavor?

Great recipe, this is a quick way to add flavor to everyday green beans. I used fresh garlic, added finely chopped red onions l, diced tomatoes, and a medley of freshly cracked pepper from a grinder. I did not use lemon pepper seasoning. Once finished I sprinkled about 1 tbsp of fresh lemon juice on top. I will make again for guests!

Easy, delicious and healthy.  If you need more 'taste' add additional garlic, butter and/or lemon pepper.  In other words, season to taste.  Whole family really enjoyed this.

Fantastic green beans. Used a little broth during the boiling stage, for flavor. Also I like my GB not so crunchy, so boiled much longer than the recipe. Added bacon to the butter/garlic second stage cook.

Great flavor profile, wife loved it!

These were tasty and well received.  I have  a heavy hand when it comes to garlic and pepper...  so I may not have followed quantities exactly but I always season to taste.  I'd make thus again - easy peasy.

Yum!  Delicious and a super easy way to spruce up ordinary green beans.  I used frozen green beans and also added in some finely minced onion with the garlic as well.  I cooked the green beans first in the pan with a little chicken bouillon and water, then lightly sauteed the garlic and onion in the butter, tossed it all together with the cooked green beans, and put them in a baking dish to keep warm in the oven until ready to serve.  To spruce it up even more, right before serving I dusted the tops with freshly grated parmesan.  The best!  Thank you for the recipe!

I would have liked this better had there been much flavor but there wasn't.   I added more garlic and more lemon pepper but it was still bland.  I'll do something different next time.

This was my first recipe I've ever tried for fresh green beans (as opposed to out of the can). It was easy, and the flavors were good! I'm not sure I followed the quantities exactly on the recipe, but I might do a little more lemon pepper next time, or something else to add a bit more flavor.

I started with juice from 2 lemons and then added olive oil and garlic to a pan. Let that cook for about 3-5 minutes. Added the green beans and removed once slightly softened. Added balsamic immediately before serving. They were the surprise hit of the Thanksgiving Meal!

I made this for 12 people. I used the serving size ingredient estimator. I didn't think the garlic flavor came out enough so I ended up adding some garlic powder as well.

made this recipe yesterday. green beans came out really good. I didn't have any lemon on site but wonder if it would make a big difference.  They were really good with garlic, salt and pepper only. I added some sesame seeds too. delicious!

I've made these several times - - never any leftovers!  I generally need to boil longer than the recipe states.  I drain the water, then add the butter to the pan with the green beans and some jarred chopped roasted garlic.  I don't care for lemon pepper, so I use freshly squeezed lemon to taste and a few grinds of pink Himalayan sea salt. My 8 year-old daughter can't get enough, so I'm more than happy to oblige her request for these anytime!

I can seldom use fresh green beans, so I resorted to canned. Just two of us, so one can. Heated the beans in water from can, thoroughly. Drained. Put in some butter, etc.Adjusted  the amount of seasonings. Really enjoyed it and will use it again...and probably again......etc. It's not difficult. Just never thought of it. Creative cooking is not my forte.

I made these beans twice, the first time I followed the recipe to the letter, the second time I did not put the lemon pepper in, I liked the first one just okay, the second time they were fabulous! Sometimes less is more and better.

This is one of my favorite green bean recipes.  So easy and very tasty.  I simmer the green beans about 7 minutes & use salted butter, but other than that follow the recipe as written.   Delicious!

This recipe is delicious and easy. I used minced garlic out of a jar and it was still great. Loved that the beans stayed nice and crisp.

Easy and quick. It's hard to mess this up. Flavor to taste. I like a lot of garlic so I adjusted up. Also, i didn't have lemon pepper so I used about 2 tbsp of preserved lemon rounds instead. Came out quite well. I suggest using grass-fed butter instead of regular butter to keep it as healthy as possible. I used Kerry Gold which is usually available in most stores and typically costs the least.

These are so good. When I drained the green beans I sautéed the garlic in the butter for a couple of minutes before adding back in the greens. I never knew green beans could be so yummy!

Excellent!  I just experimented with the few green beans from my garden and this recipe, and can't wait to go to the farmer's market tomorrow for more green beans!  Simple and yummy, and you could play with this recipe to change it up a little.

Super delicious. I didn't have lemon pepper, so I used about 1/2 tsp of lemon zest.  I also cut the butter in half and didn't miss it.

Very tasty. Fresh is the only way to go and the quality of the green beans makes all the difference. Real butter was used, but I substituted the garlic cloves with powder. Ground pepper and salt to taste. Did not have lemon pepper.

I used can green beans because I wanted to use what I have and it came out wonderfully. I know when I do it again with fresh green beans I know it would be better. Also I think that by adding a pinch more of the lemon pepper seasoning makes a big different expecially with large amounts.

Made this on Mothers Day to go with Chicken and Mushrooms.  I did not use the lemon pepper but, otherwise, followed the directions here.  It was my first attempt at making fresh green beans.  These were enjoyed by all and I would recommend this recipe to everyone!

I've made this twice now.  It's very easy to follow and to do.  The first time though I forgot to add the lemon pepper and actually liked it better that way. I found that the lemon pepper was a little too aggressive a taste and seemed to mask the fresh taste of the green beans.  I will definitely make it again with just this minor adjustment.

Made this exactly as directed, except reduced butter to 1 T. and garlic to 1 clove. It was delicious and easy! My only regret is that I didn't make a double batch!
