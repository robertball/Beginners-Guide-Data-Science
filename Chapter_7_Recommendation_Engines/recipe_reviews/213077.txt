I just tried these and they are very good though a bit dry I found. I added an egg and that rather helped.

These aren't bad cookies; but they aren't great. They taste like sweet bread, really. I followed the advice of the other reviewer and added an egg, but that made the dough too sticky to roll into balls and press flat. Instead, I used a spherical tablespoon scoop and then pressed them flat with my (clean) fingers, and THEN I put the sprinkles on them. Also, they were done baking after just 10 minutes, not 12-14.  Still, there just isn't much to these cookies other than their fun and festive colors. Like I said, they're not bad. But they're not good, either. I probably won't make them again.

I was so excited to find this recipe and use champagne in the cookies. Like the other viewers said, the dough was so sticky and IMPOSSIBLE to roll into a ball. I almost threw it away but I decided to spoon it onto the cookie sheet and see how they would turn out. Not so good.

I had to use part white and part whole wheat flour because I was running low on white. After reading the other reviews, I used 1/3 cup shortening with the intention of using one egg. Once I got everything mixed up, it was so sticky I had to add more flour without ever adding the egg! the only other change I made was I added a capful of each vanilla and strawberry extract. They turned out good and tasted good, but without the strawberry extract, I don't know how much I would have liked them. I will make these again, with my changes.

I don't know why other reviewers didn't like these cookies! I thought they were very good! They remind me of a sweet bread! I did have the same problem as other members...the dough was way too sticky to form into balls. Instead I just dropped them onto a parchment lined cookie sheet using a tablespoon measure melon baller. Then I sprinkled them with the nonpareils(multi-colored sprinkles). I baked them for 12 minutes and they were perfect! These are a nice soft cookie with a slightly crunchy edge. Not too sweet, which is how I like my cookies! And they did taste great with a glass of champagne! This is a good way to use up leftover champagne! I added a few photos!

This recipe is not AT ALL what I remember a true Italian champagne cookie to be. I was expecting a dry shortbread cookie, and wound up with a goopy flavorless mess. This whole recipe is off, start to finish. The dough is too sticky and wet to do anything with. I even tried throwing it in the freezer, but after 15 hours in there, it still hadn't hardened even slightly. Maybe I was expecting too much from this, but either way, it's definitely not worth the time and trouble. Worst cookie ever.

They're okay.  I followed the recipe and after my first pan of test batch, I decided to add an egg.  It seem to work better.  I could not roll them in a ball so I used a pastry bag.  I also ended up mixing in the sprinkles in the batter and adding some to the top as well.

Very sticky. I added 2 cups of flour because dough was so sticky.  I also rolled the dough out to a 1/4 inch thick. I used a 4 inch round cutter.  Itâ€™s ok, very plain, just kinda of one tone.

I just made these but I didn't use the sprinkles. They were so sticky I tried to add more flour so I can roll them into a ball. The shape isn't that great but better than nothing. It's for a bachelorette party so hopefully the guest will like the taste more than the look.

They are so pretty and festive. They are not the best tasting cookie. The dough was a sticky mess and I will never cook these again. They are too much work for not that great a result. I do wish someone could perfect this recipe.
