This is an excellent recipe that my mother has been making for years - my own recommendations: use ONLY Granny Smith apples, for low juice and perfect baking results; use only 4-5 apples, rather than the 8 suggested here, enough for a single, dense layer; and you don't have to use corn flakes for the base, you can use any flaked cereal, or even crisped rice cereal works great.  I made this last night for some dinner guests, and they RAVED about it.

I made these for my husband who loves apples and they were a big hit.  Great for dessert or with morning coffee.  
Note:  The recipe should read 1 1/2 tablespoons (not teaspoons)milk for the glaze.

I used four good sized granny smith apples = 8 cups. I mixed ingredients and apples together in a bowl to evenly coat them. Great recipe, unlike other reviews, mine held up well for a few days.

Excellent stuff! I've always used green apples and frosted flakes, but otherwise the recipe goes unchanged. I do roll the dough out to fit a (sided) cookie sheet - makes more. A must on my christmas trays and happy indulgence any other time of the year. The only complaint (and it's not much of one considering they're gone within two days) but they don't have a good shelf life...only two days without becoming soggy.

Yummy, yummy! This is really easy and fun to make! The crust is a breeze if you've got a pastry blender - and if you don't, use a fork. The only thing I would add to this is a couple pats of butter over the apples before adding the top crust, but that's just because I love butter. It doesn't "need" it - it's great just the way it is!

Delicious! Just like apple pie! But that means this recipe is definitely not "traveler friendly". Much too much ooey gooey sticky streuselness to be a good item for packing. But that's ok; just eat them warm right out of the pan!

These are delicious! I am not sure what role the cornflakes play, I could not taste them and there was not a texture difference in the bottom crust... As for the sogginess-after-two-days issue, I reheated them for 15 minutes at 250 degrees, then upped the temp to 350 for another 10 minutes or so and the crust "freshened up". They were a hit with our Bible Study Small Group. 
I also liked the way the glaze hardened in the oven after the second heating, so I might add it 1/2way thru next time. (If serving it to a crowd) Thanks!

This looked and smelled wonderful.  The crust was very very nice, both in flavor and texture, but the filling was dry.  I used gala apples, sliced thin as directed.  Perhaps thicker wedges would have held the moisture better.  This was my only complaint.  The flavor was nice.

This is soooooooooooo good and easily made with common household ingredients.  I would have given it 5 stars except it is a bit too sweet.  Next time I will cut down on the sugar from one cup to a half cup because the drizzle on top is just too good to skip!  My husband loves sweet things, so this suits him just fine!

I made exactly as recipe indicated using a variety of apples. These do take some prep time but the flavor is so worth it. The hardest part was rolling out the dough so I'd add flour to the counter as needed and lift the dough to sprinkle flour underneath & continue to roll out. It takes a little work but take the time needed and it will be much easier. Very yummy. These bars are great for bake sales. Once cooled they hold together well.

Very good.  This is a bit time consuming, but it's all about the steps.  I didn't roll the crust, just patted it out both times--worked better to pat out in the pan the first time, but I still didnt' want to roll the top layer due to the stickiness of the dough, so I made it work.  I halved the recipe so as to put it in an  8x8 pan and used 2 apples.  I really didn't bother measuring the apples, so I'm not sure how many cups that is.  I used Granny Smith and they worked wonderfully well.  I left off the final topping and I don't think they need it.  Very good, very similar to an apple pie but a tad easier and a  bit less calories (well, if you can keep yourself to a serving each time!)  Thanks for the recipe!

This was a very tasty recipe.  However the name "bars" is misleading because it suggests a  finger food.  It is really an apple pie in a 9X13 dish.  It is cut into bars which hold together nicely when cool, but it is really too messy for a finger food.  I chopped 6 Granny Smith apples and it was plenty for the apple layer.  I made only one change and that was cutting the sugar to 3/4 cup.  I think next time I will leave the glaze off as it really didn't add much to the overall flavor.  Maybe for a  variation I will add some craisins to the apple filling the next time.  But it got rave reviews from my friends, so overall it is a good recipe just as it is written.

My mom was famous at potlucks for her delicious Apple Pie Bars.  These are almost as good as hers.  I didn’t have her recipe in hand, so used this one.  I have since found her recipe and there are just a couple small differences, so next time I’ll try hers and see if I can achieve her apple bar goodness.  To the reviewers wondering about the cornflakes, that’s to absorb apple juice and give body to the syrup that develops, like a thickener.  To the reviewers who said the name “bars” is misleading and it’s too messy for a finger food and that it’s not travel friendly, that is because the apple layer is too much.  My apple layer was also too thick.  I didn’t measure, just cut of 4 large and 1 small granny smith, so I don’t know how many cups I had.  Try reducing the amount of apples to make it a handheld bar.  My mom’s bars were definitely finger food and transportable.  She would cut them into squares and stack them in a Tupperware container.  No wax paper liner needed between layers.  They were not messy.

Love this recipe.  Super easy.  And turn out every time.  It is exactly like my mom made growing up.  It is the taste of autumn to me.  My daughter and I make a pan each weekend until our apples are used up.  I do not use the cornflakes and it seems to turn out just fine without.  Not sure of their purpose.  I also bake the bottom crust for about 5 min before layering the apples on top.  Seems to make it slightly crisper/firmer and seems like it prevents it from getting soggy a little longer.

I had forgotten about this recipe but made it years ago.   It is still one of the best apple bars I have ever found.  Always use Granny Smith apples and cut back on the sugar.  Cornflakes on the bottom are a must for texture.

Absolutely delicious!  I used 4 Granny Smith and 4 Braeburn apples and increased the sugar in the filling to 1 cup.  Baked in a cookie sheet cake pan (a little larger than a 9X13 cake pan).  This is a wonderful recipe.

This tastes just like apple pie! The crust is flaky and moist, and the sweetness is just right. I added a teaspoon of vanilla into the crust just to bring out the flavor more. This recipe is a definite keeper.

I made this for our 4th of July party. Defiately an "All American" dessert. My family requested last night that I bake it again. They didn't have to twist my arm too hard. It's actually a very easy recipe, and I love how flaky the crust turns out. Crusts can be a tricky think to accomplish. It was definately a nice twist to the Apple Pie. Much easier to serve too. I can see that this has definately become a family favorite.

This was great, I thought the dough could be alittle sweeter and the next time I make this I think I will use brown sugar to coat the apples. I will definently make this again!

Made no changes, did use Macintosh apples, would use a different apple next time, maybe granny smith. Would make less glaze, about 1/2 the amount would have been good for me.

My family lives these! I'd like the crust recipe to be just a little bigger so it's easier to fill the pan. I made it GF and dairy free once and Mum loved them too! (She's Gluten and dairy intolerant)

I made this recipe yesterday and was disappointed with the taste. Too bland. I have a similar recipe which I will use next time. I don't like the butter pastry so I'll keep to my tried and true pastry which I know is a winner.

Outstanding!  Like other's comments, I didn't understand the purpose behind using the corn flakes....but I did chose to try Raisin Bran instead.  The touch of raisins were like a surprise inside.  I also chopped my apples into cubes and left the peeling for greater nutritional value. The crust was wonderful as well.  I will probably cut back on the sugar next time, as it was a bit too sweet.  :)

Thout this was a easy (with an apple peeler/slicer) apple pie.  Like the sweetness, good crust.  Much better right out of the oven with a scoop of icecream.  Too soggy the next day.  Glaze works with skim milk as well.
