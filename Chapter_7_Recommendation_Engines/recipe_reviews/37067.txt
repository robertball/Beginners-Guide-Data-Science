Excellent recipe!  I added avocado as well.  Perfect side dish as well as an appetizer on top of a cracker with cream cheese!  I will make this all summer for everyone I know.

FANTASTIC!
I LOVE this recipe! (I added tomato too & sautéed the majority of the onion)  My husband and my 3 year old both couldn't get enough.  We served this over 1 1/2 lb salmon the first night.  Ate it on crackers with cream cheese as suggested by another user (mmmmm sooooo good!) for lunch the next day and finished it off on top of the Pico de Gallo Chicken Quesadillas from this site for dinner.  This is a no fail AWESOME recipe!  I can't wait to make it again!  Incredibly good for you too!

This was awesome. I added lime juice (which helps keep the avocado from going brown, a bit more cilantro and a bit more balsamic vinegar and omitted the onion (allergies). This was served with baked halibut and was definitely a huge hit with my family and our guests. I plan on serving this again very soon. I put the mixture in a Tupperware container so I could rotate it to ensure all the flavours melded.

The fresh flavors make this a perfect accompaniment to a lot of foods. I happened to have beef chuck steaks on hand which I grilled. I topped it with more than a generous portion of the salsa. I still have some left over that I think I'll try on fish tomorrow. I did add the juice of 1 small lemon and 1 lime and 1/2 jalapeño pepper minced at the advise of another reviewer which I think added just the right bit of kick. I'm going to try this in beef fajitas too. Great, thanks for sharing!

This was so good, we were eating it by the spoonful straight out of the mixing bowl in the kitchen! I only made minor changes in the amounts of the ingredients I used: didn't use a whole papaya, only about 1#; only used 1/2 of a large red bell pepper; used about 1/4 cup cilantro (we love cilantro). I followed other reviewer's suggestions and added about 2T lemon juice. It was so pretty and so tasty.

A good base. I was hesitant to add the vinegar to the entire mix without knowing how it will taste - it's definitely an interesting flavor and could be great if you're serving it with the right dish (chicken?). I would prefer this to have a kick--some jalapeno and a hit of lime juice would be preferred. aybe even red onion instead. Since I have neither jalapeno nor lime on hand, I just added fresh lemon juice... good mix of flavors though...

I didnt have mango or red pepper and used green onions instead of sweet and used dried cilantro.  I added a squeeze of lime.  This was delicious with fish.

bursting with flavor even without having to let stand for 30 minutes! I added extra balsalmic vinegar (since I love it lol) and stuck to rest of the recipe, will make this over and over again

This recipe looks sooo beautiful on the plate. It also tasted so good!  I skipped the balsamic vinegar though.  Instead I used lime.  I also added a habanero pepper which tasted really good and added some spice but beware if your sensitive to spicy!  I am pregnant and talk about heartburn!  I served the salsa with the chicken kabobs mexicana.  The salsa comlemented the kabobs perfectly.  I felt like such a gourmet cook!  I had to call and recommend the recipe to my mom and sister.

I kind of messed this up b/c I forgot to write down *exactly* what's in it but I liked it nonetheless.  I forgot the balsamic vinegar and I loathe onions so I didn't add it to mine.  I added some honey b/c our fruit wasn't very ripe.   I put it on salmon and it was delicious. (I have some leftover and will add balsamic to it.)

Very good salsa.  I made this to go along with spicy shrimp, also from this site.  Both were excellent.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I paired this salsa with some roasted pork loin (salt, pepper and garlic powder) and it was fantastic! I prefer it with the pork loin rather than fish (salmon), which I also tried - still very good though. I'm going to make another batch just for plain salsa. Just can't get enough of this stuff!

Good but was missing a little kick.  Ended up adding a little all purpose seasoning mix, a dash of hot sauce and a little fruit flavored vinegar and  it was perfect.

Yummy. I used this as a jumping off point to work with ingredients I had on hand. I used frozen tropical fruit that I thawed overnight in the fridge. I added red peppers and avacado plus salt and pepper and balsalmic vinegar. Served over baked mahi mahi and a bed of brown rice this was great.

I thought this recipe was great! I ended up adding a little sugar to it to bring out the taste of the fruits. Instead of using it to top the jerk flavored chicken I made, my guests ate it as a salad on it's own - and loved it! I can't wait until summer to make this refreshing salsa again.

This was amazing!  The perfect sidekick for Jeff Calkins' blackened salmon fillets.  I also served it to the in-laws as an appetizer by layering with softened cream cheese in a bowl and serving with crackers as suggested.  Magnificent both ways!
Will keep this one handy!!

This is wonderful on the side or on porkchops. We did not have a ripe avocado but threw in sliced grapes on a whim. This was our only change made to the original recipe.

The wife said it was an excellent salsa (I had never used Papaya before)...refreshing. I squeezed a lime, added minced celery, apple, and a 4.5 oz can of chopped green chilies.

Loved this.
No peppers, and I used a standard onion rather than a sweet one, plus a mixture of  Pedro Ximenez Vinegar Reduction and balsamic.
Absolutely fabulous,  and  will definitely make again.

Pretty good stuff! Since avocados, papayas, and mangos are often purchased in different sizes, it would have been helpful having the ingredients measured out rather than just identified. Although a bit challenging getting the ingredients in the correct proportions,  a lot of tasting took care of that. I liked the salsa very much and have already used it on fish and tacos.

Awesome salsa! Even my guy loved it and he usually isn't a fan of anything too healthy ??

 I used red onion, added about 1 1/2 tbs extra cilantro, and juice from 1/2 of a lime. We ate it with cream cheese and crackers.

I didn't have papay so my salsa turned a bit too salty.  Had to wash it to get rid of the extra vinegar taste.  Can use 1 tbsp vinegar.  Otherwise it was a party HIT!
