This was tasty. I thought I had cilantro in the fridge. Turned ut it was italian parsely but I forged ahead anyway. I used a mixture of basil and parsely in this instead. Next time I think I'll cook the cauliflower a minute or so less. I wouldn't mistake this for white rice, but it is a nice side dish

This is so easy and very tasty. If you are looking for directions on how to pre-prepare the cauliflower and freeze it,  suggest storing the rice in "2 cup" batches. Pull it out of the freezer and prep (I too used a skillet without a microwave). Another butter substitute is coconut oil. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is really good. I just cook the cauliflower rice in a skillet with coconut oil instead of butter. Finish off with some Siracha chili sauce for a nice kick.

Wow! This is the second time I am making this. I omitted the butter, really doesn't add anything to the taste but calories, and added finely chopped scallion and fresh ground pepper. I could eat the whole thing in one sitting!!! Don't be afraid to add the lime zest, cilantro and lime juice to taste. I used 2 limes, zest of 2 limes and a bunch of cilantro.

Super easy to make. My fiance and I are on a carb-less diet and I LOVE cooking spanish rice (and crave it more than anything), but this was a great substitution! I cooked it in a skillet, one tbs of butter, instead of two and I used 2 limes for extra flavor.

What a great idea! I am a fan of cilantro lime rice, and I love cauliflower. This came out great. Even my husband (super picky, and doesn't care for vegetables, hates cauliflower) thought this was rice. Because he saw me cutting the cauliflower he knew there was cauliflower in it, but he thought it had rice too! Next time when I make it I will make it when he can't see it, and see if he can tell!

We loved this recipe! Even though we are a family of 3, I could have and perhaps, should have doubled the recipe; it warms up wonderfully the next day. I second the recommendation of using two limes - we love citrus in our household! Also, instead of butter, I used coconut oil and added just a bit of unsweetened shredded coconut. I can't say that we thought it was really white rice, as some reviewers mentioned, but it was so darn good nonetheless accompanying my husband's tasty Asian stir-fry. Already picked up two more cauliflower heads to make it again this week-end! Thank you for sharing this recipe, Abussone!

This was not a hit for us. We eat a low carb diet and have prepared cauliflower in many different ways. I found this to be both bland and a little sour. There are MANY better recipes using chopped cauliflower.

Added coconut oil instead of butter per recommendations and loved it. I don't even like cauliflower but could eat this daily! It doesn't taste like rice though.

This is SO good. I did use 2 limes, but everything else was exactly as listed originally. My husband and I are both on low-carb diets, and I can tell already that this will be added to our list of staples. Delicious!

Used basil and lemon with a little parm and garlic butter to pair the idea with my meal. Loved how fluffy it was. Will "rice" cauli a lot in the future.

Was a little bland.  Boyfriend thought it was quinoa.  Next time I will try my own ingredient blend and add some chicken stock instead of water.  Seems to need something salty.  I exchanged butter for olive oil.

Excellent recipe!  I was a skeptic, I have to admit.  I hate cauliflower and I love rice side dishes. The only changes I made to the recipe were that I used popcorn-seasoning powdered butter- just a couple shakes, instead of real butter.  (I did this mostly to cut calories.)  I was so scared of tasting cauliflower, I also upped the lime amounts to 2 limes, zested and juiced and it was perfect to my liking.  No cauliflower taste, and with only 7 min in the microwave, covered, it was cooked to perfection and little to no smell to tip off the kids ;)  Thanks so much for sharing, this is a keeper for sure!

This was actually quite nice.  I was looking for something different as a side and decided to try it.  I also used a skillet instead of the microwave.  It has a more subtle flavor, so pair it with a main dish that is bolder.  Otherwise it may seem bland.

I don't think you could really pass this off to anyone as "rice" but it was a great alternative with much more nutritional value and one I will make often. Cauliflower is a bit of a hassle to chop and deal with but I knew this going into it. I think it needs a dash of salt. That or use salted butter. Regardless, this was nice and a side dish that would work with many different things. Thanks for sharing and I will be making again!

The dish turned out great! The only change I did was to use the frozen riced cauliflower steamed in the microwave. A pinch of salt made it sing. My husband loved it!  It is a keeper.

Very very good. Juiced half a lime (not very juicy) and zested 2 limes and used a bunch of cilantro. I did add some green onions and garlic too and omitted the butter. Paired with Carne Asada made the perfect meal.

It's been a while since I made this so I don't remember the exact changes I made (though all changes came from other reviewer suggestions) but it was really delicious and a great healthy alternative.  It's important to note that I do NOT like cauliflower! That's the amazing part!

This recipe is easy to follow, not my favorite cauliflower recipe but to be honest it has a good taste. Grated parmesan cheese makes this recipe a lot better.

Great idea! I've made this three times in the past two weeks and tweaked it to our taste... Cooked it closer to 3-5 minutes depending on the shallowness of the dish, longer made it too mushy. Left out the butter too, just didn't need it. The first time we had it as above but added sliced green onions, diced red bell peppers, and cotija cheese... Yum! Looking forward to trying a Thai version next, with hints of lemongrass and ginger. This one goes into the rotation!

This has become one of my go-to side dishes. Everyone who tries it loves it and asks for more. The only change I made was cooking it on the stove over medium heat instead of the microwave. Fantastic!

Maybe I had an extra juicy lime or something, but the lime flavor in this dish was way too strong for me.  I did use the optional butter.  We still ate it but if I were to make this again I would only use a half of a lime.  On the plus side, this was fast to make once the food processor part was over and was an interesting way to add cauliflower to a mexican themed meal.

Loved it!   Used olive oil instead of butter, was excellent.
We are big cilantro lovers in my house, so this was a hit!

Very fresh, had a sweet taste that I wasn't expecting. Probably pretty tasty with a spicy Mexican dish and margarita, but did not taste right with baked chicken and mashed potatoes.

Just started Phase 1 of the South Beach Diet- I'm vegetarian and someone had bookmarked this recipe.  Love it!  Awesome flavor- I added a few chili flakes and some green onion.  The next 13 days will be alot easier as I try variations of this recipe!

I just made this and am eating it right now.  I agree with everyone - tasty dish, but I wouldn't mistake it for rice.  I was so excited to make this I didn't see the butter was optional.  Next time I will omit it as it didn't add any flavor, and maybe add more lime juice and try some garlic granules.  Will definitely make again....soon.  :)

Different, fairly easy, just ok but a good idea as a Mex. accompaniment. Consider more seasoning.

Cauliflower rice is great when seasoned right.  For just "rice", butter and salt is all you really need.

Really surprised at how good this was!  And really easy to make.  It took just a few minutes to grate.  This would be good in a burrito instead of rice too.

Working on a diet with a lot less starches, this has become one of my favorite go-to's. It has a bright, enjoyable flavor. I've used it with stir fry or as a side dish.

Even my two teens agreed this was a great substitute for rice on our burritos.  I'm going to try to freeze it and hope that works, it'll be great to have on hand for Mexican night (or even when we have Asian bowls).

I made this using the processor to "rice" the cauliiflower and that was easy peasy.  This was pretty good when it was hot.  Out of the fridge the next day, and it definitely had to be heated up.  I did not care for it cold.

Made this dish due to all of the reviews saying they couldn't tell the difference between regular rice and this and even tricked their kids. Well... maybe I used the wrong kind of cauliflour because there was no way my family or I wouldn't be able to tell this was cauliflour.  It stunk so bad, I couldn't bring myself to try it. You must like cauliflour to like this recipe.

I really like cauliflower rice since discovering it, but couldn't get past the lime taste in this recipe. I tested a small batch cooking in microwave, but didn't care for the cauliflower as it got too soft. Cooked in skillet with olive oil instead of butter. Used 2 tbsp lime juice (would cut this back if trying again to 2-3 tsp--1 tbsp) and used 3/4 tsp dried cilantro. The amount of cilantro I used was fine, but the lime I just couldn't overcome with the cauliflower. Hubs thought it was ok, hence the rating of 3 stars. For me 1 star. See the review that mentions adding some butter if it's too tart for your tastes--missed that one last night.  Served with Salsa Chicken by faye along with black beans and corn lightly seasoned with taco seasoning.

Refreshing.  Will bolster lime and add a dash of salt next time.  Highly recommend to swap out the high calories of a rice dish.

I used a 14 oz bag of grated cauliflower the first time, but followed the recipe exactly.  The cauliflower was mushy and overcooked at 7 minutes in the microwave.  The next time I tried it I only cooked for four minutes and it was perfect.

Made as written, including the butter. Exceeded my expectations. Going to serve with a chicken curry.  Nice alternative to white rice.

Very bland....no one added seasons to this?  The taste was very sour. Usually I love cilantro, but it really did not add anything to the taste. I saved the rest to eat cold. Perhaps that is the way it should be eaten.

Pretty good for a snack/lunch! I like a little crunch so I cooked the cauliflower (I bought mine from Trader Joe's already to go) on the stove top with avocado oil, salt, and pepper until a little brown. Then I let it cool for a little so it doesn't welt the cilantro, doubled the lime! Will make again

Made this for a replacement in a Chipotle burrito bowl.  Couldn't tell the difference when it was mixed with all the other fixings.  By itself it was close but needed some work.

I added chopped fresh mint because it was too tart and it did help.  I don't know if the lime I used caused it to be tart, but the mint did take the bit out of it.  I wanted to love this, but didn't, but I will try it a one more time.

Was a little disappointed.  It lacked flavor.  Lime was too strong. Took MUCH longer in microwave to get the consistency I wanted.   We ate it but probably would not make it again.

Made this for Thanksgiving as a nice, light side. Glad I did. Some people at my table thought it was a bit too limey, but I truly enjoyed it (but I also love lime so take that with a grain of salt).

This is a wonderful 'base' recipe for cauliflower rice. I don't use microwaves so I boiled, instead. I like to boil in a veggie broth for added nutritional values. I don't use butter, so coconut oil gives it a great taste and substitute, here. Also don't always get my cilantro fresh but dried cilantro works just as well if not better. There's a lot you can do with this recipe and of course cauliflower rice in general. It's great warm or cold, too! I actually prefer mine the next day once he like saturates the rice and the favors fuse, and served cold. I like to add shredded salmon to it as well for a full meal. Overall, this recipe can be tweaked and used many different ways, which I give it 5-stars for.

Really good and easy recipe!! Didn't use butter nor microwave. I added some water to the pan with the cauliflower and let it cook for a few minutes until tender, but not mushy. 
And just like other people said... my husband hates cauliflower and he liked it! so did my picky daughter. It's a keeper!

I need to try this again as I struggled with using my blender vs my food processor so the cauliflower came out more ground than it should have. It tasted okay but wasn't the consistency of rice. I'll will try it again.

This has the exact texture of couscous but tastes nothing like cauliflower. Even picky husband liked it. I used about half the cilantro and lime, and that was plenty. I also added salt, pepper, and maybe a tablespoon of parmesan instead of butter (as suggested by another reviewer). Delish. I will be trying other seasonings with this to replicate other rice/couscous sides too, as it seems versatile. Thanks OP!

Well, I guess if you like cauliflower it's okay.  The people in my family who like cauliflower liked this, those who didn't did not.  I was hoping with all the other flavors from the chicken, cheese, sour cream, etc... that I wouldn't really be able to taste the cauliflower, but since I don't care for the taste ot's all I could taste.

Well, this tastes nothing like rice and the cauliflower flavor comes shining through.  It paired well with marinated wild salmon on AR (also only ok), but the flavor didn't do anything for us.  Mashed cauliflower whipped with light cream cheese (or laughing cow wedges) is better.  It was editable but we won't have again.  Perhaps it would be better with a strong Asian flavor.

Before we went paleo I used to make this with jasmine rice for our, "Chipotle" night.  Trust me when I say you need to add just a few teaspoons each, of real lemon juice and real orange juice.   It makes it soooooo much better. And gives it that, "umami" flavor it's missing. Do it and thank me later.:)

Cauliflower is new to me. I am only just starting to enjoy it, and only in select ways. Gotta say - this was phenomenal! I could have eaten the whole bowl in one sitting. I paired it with a "Sweet and Spicy Salmon with Grapefruit Salsa" from this site, and it paired extremely well. The only change I made was roasting the cauliflower instead of microwaving it.

It is a great side dish, and has become a regular thing in our house.  I generally use large heads of cauliflower, so I use two limes instead of one (no zest).... also, I prefer it with Italian parsley. 
One more thing - I add the lime to the mix before I nuke it. :)

Great substitute for rice with so many fewer calories and lots more nutrition. Do not skimp on the lime juice or cilantro. Needs a little salt. My husband who thinks he does not like cauliflower, loved this. Served it with a Olive & lemon chicken in place of rice.  Winner!

I added a quarter teaspoon of salt and pepper, skipped the butter and added a half of diced poblano pepper. I also cooked the cauliflower closer to 10 minutes. Adding the poblano pepper at the last two.

I will probably attempt to make this again because I think it has good potential. I love cilantro so I thought the amount it calls for is great. I just felt it was too strong in the lime and felt it was lacking something else... Not sure what, but I will definitely try experimenting using this as a foundation!

I made this per the directions and while most of my guests ate it they did comment that the lime was too much.

Everyone enjoyed this! I added more cilantro (we enjoy cilantro). I felt it is easy to make and tastes very fresh.

Great low carb option as a side.  Tasted great.  Texture was slightly different than rice but it was still great!

I did the same as another reader and added garlic butter, basil, salt and pepper.  This really takes cauliflower from bland to something delish!

We will make it again.  Hubs really liked it, too.  Substituted unflavored coconut oil for butter.  Seasoned to taste with salt and pepper.  The fresh lime and zest were a nice addition. 

Served this as a side with Ginger Glazed Mahi Mahi (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/45833/ginger-glazed-mahi-mahi/)

A very easy low-carb faux rice. I used only 1 teaspoon of lime juice and added salt and pepper to taste. Tip: If yours ends up too tart, adding more butter or a touch of olive oil or cream will help balance the flavor.

I love this recipe! I took some of the recommendations from other reviewers and skipped he butter, used two limes, a bunch of cilantro and added a tablespoon of sriracha hot chilli sauce for a bit of a kick. It turned out fabulous, thanks for a great recipe!

We followed the recipe closely, but cooked our cauliflower on the stove instead of in the microwave. The original recipe left us with far too much lime taste, so we added salt and some extra butter. Overall, I'd recommend this recipe. I'm sure we'll use it again.

I substituted this cauliflower recipe for rice when I made black beans and rice today and it was a very different, mushy texture and I craved a starch with the beans.  Probably better to keep this recipe as a vegetable side dish than part of an entree.

This is really good just as the recipe is written.  For a variation, mix in equal part cottage cheese, a half teaspoon of chicken broth powder, salt and pepper.  I will try it also with either red or green salsa mixed in before serving!

I love cilantro and lime, but I didn't care for these flavors in this dish.  It was overpowering. I never heard of cauliflower "rice" so I'm so glad I tried this recipe!  I am going to make this with Italian seasonings instead.

cilantro tastes to both my husband and myself like soap; it's one of those genetic taste things.  It might work with parsley which we both like.

This was OK.  Not bad.  I ate it but it is not something that I "need" to make again.  If you were on a diet or needed more veggies this would be the way to go. Hubby liked it as well but it won't be added to our must-have list.

This was an awesome low-carb side dish.  I will add this into the rotation.
