I am hooked on McDonald's Frappes.  This recipe is so close to them, that I will probably not be buying Frappes anymore.  I have served them to a number of people and the recipe has gotten raves from everyone.  Thank you, Susan!

Yummy! I did not have any powder coffee creamer, so when I mixed everything together in the blender, I added some half and half to the milk. This was delicious and refreshing. I like having the powder already made up and ready whenever you want this drink. I loved this!

This is five stars with a tiny bit of modification for me.  I doubled the coffee and used 1/3 c. of mix to make the drink instead of 1/2 and it was perfection.  SO good!!  Very addicting and I used decaf coffee b/c my 5 year old loves anything coffee flavored.  He keeps asking me for the "coffee milkshake".  Thanks so much. Would make excellent gifts.

I did a half batch and omitted the coffee so I can use the mix in hot coffee or tea, or I can add instant coffee crystals, or I can even add brewed coffee. I mixed the dry mix in the blender so it was fine. When preparing the cooler, you don't really need to add milk. The milk powder in the mix is sufficient (and, as I said, you can use brewed coffee in its place), but adding milk makes it taste richer and more ice-creamy. Oh, and for one serving, I use 8 or 9 ice cubes, about 1/4 cup of mix, and about 1/3 cup or so of milk/brewed coffee/water (with instant coffee). Thanks for sharing, Susan, this recipe is awesome!

I found a container of instant coffee in the back of my pantry and thanks to the Ingredient Search on this website, I was able to find a use for it! This recipe also called for non-dairy creamer which I had half of a huge container left from making homemade hot cocoa last month. I wanted more of a coffee flavor than milk and sugar so I upped the coffee granules to a little more than a third of a cup. Because I have a mini-food processor, I just threw my coffee granules into there and pulsed until it was a fine powder. I did not add the sugar. My powdered creamer was sugar-free french vanilla. I dumped all the ingredients into a Ball Jar, slapped a lid on it and shook it until all the ingredients were uniform in color. When I made my blended coffee, I used a half cup of the mix as directed, nonfat milk and for sweetness, I added 1 ounce of Starbucks' sugar free vanilla syrup, as I did not add sugar to the mix--this way I get my sweetness but am not consuming a mess of sugar. This was a great way to make my own blended coffee at home with ingredients I needed to use plus it's a fraction of what Starbucks charges for their "light" Frappucino's.

This is every bit as good as McDonalds.  I used Spenda baking sugar instead of sugar to save a little calories.  When I made it I used skim milk.

All I can say is "God Bless You Susan Beck"!!!! I can't waite to share this with my friends at work today - we all love Mickey D's frappe's - now we can make them lower cal. and cheap!!
I did add a bit extra coffee  with half sugar and half Splenda - FAB!! 6/18/11 Conclusion: after making this several times already - I am now using 1/3 c. coffee - S.F. creamer & all "Stevia in the raw" - so much better for you than Splenda. With that said - 1/2 cup mix is aprox. 98 calories!! I've also been using water instead of milk - enjoying it just as much as with milk. TOTALY HOOKED!!

*** Update 6/17/11: In case anyone's wondering - this does not work with regular coffee grounds.  It has to be instant coffee. ***  I have personally tested three different McDonald's Mocha Frappe copycat recipes.  This is the closest I've found.  If you want it to be more like McDonalds', substitute water for the 1/2 cup milk when blending the drink.  After studying the ingredients in McDonalds' mix (they use a pre-made liquid mix and simply blend it with crushed ice), I think the main differences between this recipe and their mix is that McD's mix uses real cream instead of dried creamer and coffee extract instead of instant coffee.  (Coffee extract meaning the concentrated liquid extract, similar to vanilla extract -- however, much harder to find).  I think without using the real cream and coffee extract this is about as close to McDs' as I'm gonna get!  And to be honest, it's really good.  After testing it out, I'm gonna make up a big batch and keep it on hand.  Just wanted to let those McD's Mocha Frappe addicts like me know how this one stacks up!  In other news, I've drank three whole frappes tonight testing this stuff out and I'll be lucky if I see any sleep tonight.  Haha!  Good thing tomorrow is a holiday! :)

What a great surprise!  We love McDonald's Frappes and have been looking for a recipe to make at home and this hits the mark - it "almost" taste like the real thing!!  I always recommend trying it the way the recipe is written the first time and than tweaking it based on your tastes - I think that I will cut the salt in half next time though.  This is, in my opinion, slightly creamier than the real thing but it is oh soooo good!!

I loved this!!  What a great recipe when you are craving a coffee drink with no ice cream and you don't want to go spend your child's lunch money on a drink!!  I made it just as directed (but in half, since there's only one of me!)  My blender blended up the ice perfectly -- i didn't have chunks of ice like I was worried about.  It tends to separate a bit, so you may want to have a spoon nearby and give it a little stir as you're drinking it.  Also, to crush up the instant coffee crystals, I just put it in a ziploc back and pinched with my fingers, and that worked fine.
Great taste!  I wouldn't change a thing!!

I hate to give anything a bad rating but the title 'Mocha Cooler' is a bit misleading. This tasted more like a malted milk shake so if that is what you are looking for then this might be for you.  I followed the recipe to the T, I wish I hadn't made a full batch because I ended up throwing it away. I like to taste my coffee in my mocha so I thought it would taste better with a bit more coffee so after tasting the recipe as is I added more instant coffee but that honestly didn't really help. This recipe is definitely convient for people on the go but this just was not a good recipe for me.

I normally love the coolers at coffee shops but this just tasted too artificial to me. Perhaps, it was the store brand creamer I bought to save pennies...

WOW! Wasn't sure what to expect - could it really be as good as Mickey Ds? I wondered! Well, yes it is!

I used the 1/3c coffee as suggested by other posts  - I used a spice grinder for to grinder the coffee to fine (worked wonderfully!), and I made my mix with Splenda - the 3/4c suggested by another poster. I used milk this time - just because the original recipe called for milk. I'll try water next time. HOWEVER, I did have to add a bit more milk to get the consistency I wanted. I figured the calories made with splenda to 120 calories per 1/2dry mix - that is without counting the milk! Still WOW! Love calories Heaven! Thanks Susan Beck! 

I can't wait to share this recipe! Thanks!

This is good - I use more instant coffee for more coffee flavor, and use water instead of milk.  If you do that, and use splenda, fat free creamer, it comes out to about 58 cals/serving - great for hot summer days like today!!!

All I have to say is OMG this is wonderful!  SO close to the McD's frappe it is crazy.  I added some International vanilla caramel powder to the mix, just because my daughter wanted to, just a couple tablespoons and I will be making this probably too much!

I used 1 1/2 cups of Swiss Miss Hot chocolate mix instead of powder milk and creamer. It was great. The next time I tried Ovaltine Classic Malt mix (instead of powder milk)and the powder creamer and that is a hit also. To make it less calories I put 1 cup of Splenda instead of sugar and that is good too.

Our family just loves these!  I quadrupled the recipe and put it in an empty canister & scoop w/directions on top and we've been enjoying these as a special treat just like from McDonalds (topped w/canned whipped cream and a drizzle of Hershey's chocolate syrup).  The kids just love them!  Thank you for saving us the $3.00/each we were paying at McDonalds!

My mom was looking for a low fat/ low calorie 'frappe' type drink similar to McDonald's mocha frappe. She needed to make this healthier, so she subbed splenda for the sugar (only used 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup), non-fat powdered non-dairy creamer, fat free milk and fat free whipped topping. She also drizzled the top with sugar free chocolate syrup for more of an 'authentic' feel. The verdict...she really, REALLY loved it! Her only complaint was that she wanted it to have more of a coffee flavor, so to the rest of the mix she is going to add more instant coffee, but that's just her personal preference. This definately filled her craving for the McD's frappe, and she will be using this recipe VERY, VERY OFTEN! thanks for sharing. :)

I actually think this is better than McDonalds Mocha Frappe, which I'm totally addicted to. I like that I can control what I add to it as well. I substituted Splenda sugarblend (1/2 cup) and used all non-fat ingredients for milk products. Loved it!!!

Absolutely delicious!  I was previously semi-addicted to McDonald's mocha frappes, but since I've discovered this recipe, I've decided mine are better!  This recipe needs no alterations: it's perfect as is!

I have tried so many recipes for blended iced coffee drinks. I have been trying to find one that tastes good enough to get me to stop spending all of my money on Tim Horton's Iced Cappuccinos and McDonald's Mocho Frappe's.  I think I've finally found the recipe that comes the closest.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to use Splenda instead of sugar.  I love the idea of having a mix made up ahead.  Very easy to whip up a drink whenever I have that urge!  Thanks so much!

This tastes just like the McDonald's Frappe.  I used Splenda instead of sugar and I drizzled some hersheys chocolate syrup instead of the cocoa.  I used Coffeemate dry cofee creamer.  VERY GOOD!

I added a little bit more coffee and I also use decaf because my kids love these and we often have these in the evening.  I also use a sugar substitute (Stevia) to make a healthier version.  So good I could have one of these every day!

I have been a member here for 9 years or so and I am ashamed to say I haven't really reviewed many recipes.  But after trying this one, I just had to get off my chair and type one up.  This is great.  I am addicted to frozen mocha drinks and this is exactly what I was looking for.  I made it exactly as written but I will probably try some other variations with Splenda and decaf coffee to see if it affects the taste.  For now, I am going to make a great big batch.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

Very tasty.  I put all the ingredients in the food processor and let it go for about 1 minutes.  I used Splenda in place of the sugar, decaf crystals, and non-fat milk & creamer.  Nice treat after supper with NO guilt!

This is really great!  It taste just as good with Splenda and low-fat ingredients.  I also like that I can make it a little more coffee tasting, or more chocolate flavored if I want to.  Alot easier on the wallet too! Friends have even used flavored creamers and they say that is really good too.

This is super yummy! I even substituted Splenda for the sugar and it turned out great! Looks like I'll be saving some money by not going to Starbucks!

I use tons of recipes off this site. I actually take the time to review only a select few that I think are just downright fantastic. This one is. It is right up there with Aunt Teen's Creamy Fudge and Grandma Ople's Apple pie. I added a bit more instant coffee but other than that I made it as listed.  Thank you Susan for sharing this wonderful treat.FOLLOW UP:  This is my second summer making this and we still love it.  I up the coffee and used different creamers with my fav being Coffee Mates Belgian Choc. Toffee.  Also, vanilla or choc. soy milk instead of reg milk adds a little different twist. I have still looked at other recipes and keep coming back to this one b/c it is so convenient to make a big batch and then I keep it in a pretty jar on the counter.  Very simple to whip up some after supper. Thanks again for the recipe.

Fabulously delicious! I have made this both cold and HOT depending on my mood.  It goes quickly so I think I will start making a double batch to have on hand all the time.  I have had it every morning for about a week now and I have no inclination to stop!  Thanks for sharing!

This excellent! I now keep it on hand and share with friends who drop in.  I increase the coffee by a tablespoon because I love the flavor.  Sometimes I add 3 tablespoons of protein powder as I blend it.  Great as a meal substitute!

Loved it. I first made like to recipe called. Very good and creamy. Second time instead of milk I used water and added Protein powder. That was super, so much flavor.  So I have I have one container with coffee mate creamer chocolate   (sugar free )and one with vanilla caramel (sugar free) used 1/4 t of stevia instead of sugar. No whip cream!

I also was hooked on McDonalds Frappes', but who can afford that? I double this recipe twice and substitute Splenda in place of sugar. Everybody request these in summer, I can't keep up. Great recipe!

Absolutely fabulous recipe!! Just as good as something you can spend four bucks on from Starbucks. Crushing the ice is a pain, but completely worth it!!!

This is a great drink!!  I did leave out the creamer and coffee crystals, though.  I added 1/2 cup milk and 1/2 cup strong coffee at the end.  Family thought it was a great coffee on a hot day!

They say necessity is the mother of invention and this beats all! It's a hot day and the coffee shop isn't in my budget. I didn't have powdered creamer so I omitted that and when I reconstituted the mix I added 1/2 cup half and half as well as 1/2 cup of milk (and 2 ice cubes, need to refill those trays). This was excellent and I'm thrilled it made extra so I can have some more tomorrow!
