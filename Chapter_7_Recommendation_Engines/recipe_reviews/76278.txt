This is an excellent recipe.  I didn't need to modify it at all, but I did based on what I had available.  I substituted walnuts for pecans and added orange-flavored cranberries before layering the bread.  The flavor was excellent and the walnuts helped to tone the richness of the french toast.  The only note I would add is that I would let it set for approximately 10-15 minutes before serving.  The butter, sugar, syrup mixture needs a little time to carmalize and the french toast retains the heat for quite a while after serving.  The 10-15 minutes will also allow the bread to firm up a little and arrive at a nice texture.

SOP, I love you.

I made this today for a friend of mine who came for breakfast with frozen blackberries sweetened with a little sugar and some homemade whipped cream...and out of the baked French toast recipes that I've tried this one is absolutely the best. 

I did make some adaptations which worked out quite nicely; added a little more orange peel than the recipe called for and a little less orange juice (about 1/2 cup). I also used brioche instead of French bread and was delighted with the results!

Thank you (and the bed & breakfast you and your husband stayed at!) for supplying this amazing recipe. It'll be on my repetoire for YEARS to come!

Great recipe!  Tasted just like warm pecan rolls, but much easier to make.  After having read over 200 reviews of the recipe, I made the following adjustments:   greased bottom and sides of the 9X13 pan with shortening (for easier release of the baked french toast); cut the slices of french bread 1" thick; added twice the amount of orange zest; used a total of 6 whole eggs (both yolk and egg white) and 1/2 c. + 2 T. 2% milk for the liquid mixture (to better cover all of the bread); baked the dish for 45 minutes; and let the dish set for 10 minutes after taking it out of the oven before serving it.  I did not add the white sugar to the liquid mixture, but I did use an entire cup of light brown sugar for the pecan topping as the recipe called for.  My company loved it and immediately asked for the recipe.  It made 6 large or 8 small servings.

This recipe is phenomenal.  One tip is to either use stale bread or crisp it up in the oven before hand.  My family adores it!

WOW- was a hit for Christmas Eve brunch! I used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup & 3/8 cup of Egg Beaters for the egg whites. The pan was completely empty when I went back for seconds!!! P.S.- If you use one of the loaves from the twin pack of Pepperidge Farms french bread, it fills the 13x9 perfectly. Good texture, too.......

Very good!  I used skim milk and 5 whole eggs.  I also used walnuts instead of pecans.  I used sourdough and I wouldn't recommend that, because it tasted too "sour" with the OJ and all.  My 3-year old loved sprinkling the powdered sugar on top!  (And...this is the first thing I've baked in my brand-new oven!  I'm so excited!)

I made this for Christmas day breakfast. They were good, but way too sweet, and I even cut the sugar down a bit. They were not immediately requested again by the kids, which is my barometer for rating a recipe. I may try this again sometime with a few tweakings to the recipe.

This was really good, and really easy!  I'm making it for the second time this morning.  Going to leave out the cinnamon this time.  Does fine to make it the night before.  Going to make it immediately this time.

I made this for a brunch at work and it was a big hit. I baked it in two round dishes instead of an oblong, so I could warm it in the microwave. The round bread fit nicely in the round dishes. I will definitely make it again!

Sometimes I laugh at some of the changes to a recipe people post to make it a little better.  This recipe is way above average and if I could give it 10 stars I would.
Don't change a single thing and it will be fantastic.
Magnifique!!!

I made this as listed, and it was exceptional.  I did have to cook it 45 minutes, rather than 35, for it to reach the appropriate crispiness.  I served this with raspberries and a mascarpone topping (mascarpone cheese thinned with cream, sweetened with a bit of sugar, and flavored with orange liqueur and orange zest.

This was very good.  I zested an orange (more than a tsp) and then juiced 2 oranges for the 1 cup. I buy loaf breads from the store that have been reduced and throw them in the freezer in freezer bags. They came in handy this morning when I saw this recipe. Not sure how others felt, but the recipe says it serves 12 people!!  My husband and I almost ate the entire casserole!  At most I would say 4 servings for adults, IF you are having something else with it like bacon, sausage or fruit.

Oh my... I'm glad that I tried this recipe!  The flavor was lovely, and Hubby wants it again even though I made a bit of a mess out of it.  For the record, do NOT use regular sandwich bread (I didn't have any crusty bread on hand).  Not surprisingly, it comes out mushy.  I am planning on making this again, but with crusty bread!

This was delicious topped with fresh blueberries! We served it July 4th morning for a special treat. I didn't refrigerate the dish overnight because I forgot to read the recipe the day before. I cooked it right away and it was still yummy and the egg mixture soaked through just fine!

Positively delicious!  Be sure and use a crusty bread for thsi one-regular loaves will get very soggy-French bread worked great.

Great recipe!!! I just have a question: should you turn it upside down as soon as you take it out of the oven?  I did not and after a while it became hard to serve since it was sticky on the bottom.  I left them in the pan I cooked them.  Whats the best way to pull them out?

I made this Sunday morning for my whole family for brunch about 20 people. I tripled the recipe and it was great. I did turn it over the last 6 minutes of cook time and it was crunchy and wonderful on both sides.  You do need to eat when it comes out of the oven.  If it sits, it will get really hard.  Will be making again

Its so funny because no one wanted me to prepare this because my boyfriend thought it was weird to use french bread (what does he know?), and my son hates food with nuts in it. Well when I flipped these out of the pan on christmas morning EVERYONE was suprised 
at how yummy these looked. There little eyes lit up!!! Not only did they look incredible, they tasted just as good as they looked! We decided that whipped ream would be the best on them but my son prefered them with nothing. This is such a great recipe....thank you for sharing!

Update; Made these once again for Chrismas Brunch and once again, amazing. Prepare the nite before. Didnt change a thing, but again, served with fresh whipped cream to tone down the sweetness. Excellent! No syrup needed.:)

Made this today for a light lunch and served it with a chopped salad. Changed servings to 6 and used Challah bread (egg bread) instead of French Bread. I used 8-9  1/4 inch thick slices slightly overlapping in 2 layers, in small oval baking dish.  I was in a rush so it only refrigerated for 15 minutes, but all the liquid was absorbed into the bread before it went into the oven. It came out very puffy, but deflated as it cooled a bit. It was delicious and moist even though the top looked a little dry. Not bsure why the recipe puts the sugar and pecan    mixture on the bottom and not the top since the casserole is not inverted when you serve it. A much easier and less fattening recipe than Paula Deen's French Toast Casserole, which I have made and is scrumptious. 
This is a definite keeper.

I absolutely loved this, but the rest of my family did not (the 5 stars are from me).  I accidentally bought wheat french bread, which may be why they didn't like it, but I did.  I also didn't have pecans, so I used walnuts instead.  The orange flavor is just perfect and the brown sugar caramel that comes out of the pan is wonderful.  I was scraping it all onto my plate this morning.  Doesn't need syrup, jam, or sugar - it's great as is! I also loved that it used 3 egg whites because the cheesecake I made took 3 egg yolks, so no waste.

Very very good!  Will make again!  The only thing I would recommend is up the cooking time just to make sure the middle pieces aren't soggy.

I'm confused about something: Is the bread the bottom layer or is the brown sugar mix the bottom layer? In the instructions it's a bit confusing how they are stacked.

This recipe deserves way more than 5 stars!  I didn't change a thing, and it turned out great.  My husband reved about it as well.  Will make again and again.

I think this is the best breakfast I've ever had. This is just delicious. The french toast melts in your mouth. The consistency of it is heavenly. I did modify the recipe a little bit, because I am very intolerant to sugar. I used 1/4 cup brown sugar for the top (no syrup), did not use sugar at all for the orange mixture, and did not use confectioner's sugar for dusting). My husband told me when he had the first try he had an "Anton Ego moment". I stayed happy all morning. This recipe made my day.

This was enjoyed. Not much orange flavor at all-but the orange was not very ripe so that must have had something to do with it.   I don't think it had a "french toast" flavor to it though...needed more egg!

WOW!  So easy and amazingly good!  I used regular whole wheat bread, cut the white surgar to 1 tbsp and added a pinch of salt.  What a treat, definitely on our family favourites list now, thanks!

Great recipe except the brown sugar/butter mixture was a bit too much (sweet). I will reduce it to 2/3 next time. ! I used 4 eggs instead of eggs and whites, and it turned out great. Thanks for sharing!

These were wonderful! I followed the recipe exactly except I substituted honey for the corn syrup. I also let the french toast sit for about 10 minutes after baking to give the sugar-nut mixture time to carmalize and hold to the bread. This ones a keeper!

I've made this French Toast a half-dozen times now and it's always a winner.  I make a few adjustments for our tastes, but, keep the recipe almost the same.  I always refrigerate over-night, and love how easy this is to prepare the night before and pop in the oven for any occasion.  I increase the orange zest to about 1 1/2tsp, add lots more pecans, and cut my bread closer to an inch thick.  Bake for closer to 40-45 minutes to get the center a little firmer.  So easy, so good.  And always impresses.

It sounds great - but I'm confused; do the nuts & butter etc. go in BEFORE the bread, & if so - do you reverse it all to serve it?  Looking at the photo, the nuts etc. are on top.  Please - someone tell me. Thank you.

I think i know the reason for soggy results. You must use bread with a dry texture. Moist whole wheat or moist white bread will not absorb the liquid. Dry texture white bread like the days old italian i used worked perfectly! 

*****the first time i made this and followed the directions exactly, it was pretty sweet.  Hands down, this is still the best sweet thing i ever made and ate! ****The second time I made this, I used half the sugar for the topping and did not put any sugar into the egg mixture.I think much better. I made this in two layers in an 9 x 13 baking dish and poured the milk/OJ/egg mix over top BOTH slices of bread. NOTE: the amount of serving says 12 but double layered, i got 4 servings out of this. To get 12 servings it must be a 1 x 1 inch square serving. Not enough food! There is no way i can make this a low fat, low sugar thing and still taste this good so I'm not going to try. I will eat this full fat and enjoy every minute of it.

When making this recipe I found out I needed a larger pan. 9x13 is not big enough for 12 slices of bread. In the picture it shows a round crescent or muffin. I followed the recipe to the "T" and it turned out very good. A little too sweet for us. I will make this again but cut back on the sugar to 1/2 cup for the topping and leave off dusting with confectioner sugar. Also will lay down foil then grease. 
the sugar and nuts  stick to the pan when cooled off. I also love the orange flavor that it gives.

Really awesome flavor!  I couldn't fit  12 pieces of french bread in my dish, so I cubed the bread.  It worked great, but next time I will double the brown sugar/pecan mixture on the bottom and maybe up the liquid mixture by half to really soak all the pieces - there were some spots near the top that didn't get enough of that flavor.  Definitely add more cinnamon and orange peel too.

We really enjoyed this on Christmas morning and I'm making it again for when we stay over at a friend's house for New Years.  I used Challah bread which always works wonderfully for french toast.  Make sure you let it sit for 10-15 minutes before serving as well as it lets everything firm up.  When you serve it, flip the slice over on the plate so you can see the nice pecan caramel topping.  This is very, very sweet and a wonderful treat for a holiday.

This is a very good, very easy recipe.  It is also very sweet.  I'll try it again with less sugar next time.  I used French bread, cream instead of milk, the zest and the juice of two oranges, and four whole eggs, because that's what I had on hand.   All in all, a great, simple recipe if you're wanting a sweet dish in the morning.

OVER THE TOP!!  Served on Christmas morning and only changes I made was to use 1/4 C of Grand Marnier and only 3/4 C of OJ.  Used 3 eggs and 2 egg whites.  Will definitely be our new Christmas brunch tradition for years to come.

I made this for Easter brunch this Sunday and it stole the show!!!!  Everyone- from my sister, to my husband, to my parents, to my in-laws- said it was one of the best french toasts they'd ever had. The brown sugar pecan topping is perfect!  I followed one reviewer's recommendation to use frozen loaves of french bread- Pepperidge Farm or your local grocery store brand- so that the pieces didn't get too soggy.  Worked out PERFECTLY. Soooo impressive.  I would give it "10 stars" if I could!  Love, love, love.

Made the night before as I knew I had a girlfriend coming to visit and we both liked it.  I used skim milk and wheat bread and left out the corn syrup. Served with bacon and orange juice. Will make again!

This was very good - and easy.  I did cut down the sugar a little in the toast. Next time, I'm going to try baking it on the upper shelf of the oven, or finishing it there so that the bread gets a little crisper.

Was great!  Can't wait to make it again with all the ideas in the other reviews.  I love breakfast stuff you can make the night before.  I really hate to get up too  early to whip up something special.  This is special and I get my sleep!

This was delicious and simple!  Oh, so tasty!  I made this for a "Bosses Day" breakfast at my office and it disappeared.  I promised my family I would make them some too.  I double the recipe and used to loaves of french bread.  I also used two eggs and the remaining 3, I used egg beaters.  It cooked perfectly and the carmely goodness on the bottom of the pan was heavenly.  I loved the combination of the orange, pecans and carmalized brown sugar.  This will become a standard in my recipe box.  Thank you SR!!!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I've been making this for my mother for the last couple Mother's days, and it gets rave reviews every year.  I follow the recipe exactly, and the only thing that I've ever had to alter is the cooking time.  For us, it's always taken longer than the 35 minutes indicated, probably closed to an hour before it's cooked enough.  Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

Definitely good & surely much easier for a large group compared to 'real' french toast - but as others have mentioned, it's really, extremely,  sweet.  (I halved the sugar and it was still very sweet. I'd recommend quartering the sugar, especially if you want to use syrup or whipped cream.)  Partly because of all that sweetness,  do expect that this will taste more like a cinnamon or orange roll rather than traditional french toast.

Very good! But very sweet (as expected).  I halved the recipe except that I used a half cup of pecans and two whole eggs for the six slices of bread.  The recipe says to make the bread fit snugly into the dish.  I made six slices in a 7 x 11 baking dish and they were snug...so snug that I had to pour the egg mixture onto four slices to snuggle the other two into the pan.  We each ate two slices; according to the recipe, that's two servings, but two didn't really seem excessive.  This is a keeper!  Thanks, SR.

These were delicious! Although, I thought it was a wee bit sweet, so maybe next time, I will use light brown sugar. Of course, my kiddo didn't mind the sweetness but would like the orange taste to shine. I had halved the recipe and used a remekin. I simply cut round breads from a drinking glass.

I loved the idea of a "different" french toast.  It was simple to make and the idea was right on, but IMO it was a bit to sweet for me and my family and I really would have liked a bit more of the orange taste to come out...it was just a squeak of a taste here and there.  Overall I liked, but with a few mods.

Absolutely wonderful!  The next time I will leave out the added sugar in the eggs.  I only put in 1 T, but it was really sweet.  I used Italian bread from Costo and left the crust on. I would say it would serve 6 to 8.  I think I had 8 slices of bread in my 9 x13 pan.  I also doubled the orange zest.  It took all the liquid just fine.  Leave it alone.
A real keeper.  Thank you for the recipe SR!

This had great flavor but I will not make it according to these directions again. The bread came out super soggy- I almost couldn't tell if it was even acceptable to eat. Maybe I messed up the recipe somewhere. I am going to try out my own adaption. This was a little sweet, but in a good way.

This was absolutely fabulous! the only change I made was to use 5 whole eggs. I let it sit at room temp for about 30 minutes then baked as directed. Came out perfect! Very rich, great orange flavor. Will definitely make again!

This french toast is delicious. I made this for a Mother's Day brunch and it was a big hit. My guests found it to be more like a cinnamon bun, but loved it.  I prepped it the night before and put it in the fridge.  I was worried the next day because all the liquid was absorbed into the bread, but it came out perfectly.  I can't wait to be invited to a brunch so I can make this for others!  Thanks for the recipe.

It burns a little and people don't know what it is because it doesn't look like the picture. The top of the roll is on the bottom of the pan.

My family loved this!  It is a bit more rich than I'm accustomed to for breakfast, but it smells heavenly and gets everyone to the table quickly.  In fact, my brothers and husband were checking on it before it was even ready.  Great choice for brunch or a special  morning when you have time to enjoy this with loved ones.

This is a fantastic make ahead recipe. The orange really makes this different than other toasts.  Substituted honey for the corn syrup and it worked perfectly. This is perfect for a brunch or special morning dish.  Huge hit for young and old.

I think it had good flavor, but Im not quite sure the egg and liquid ratio was right on.  I followed directions exactly and after I baked it the next day, it still seemed soggy or moist in the middle of the bread (and I even left it in longer to bake after trying a piece).  Maybe it needed more egg and less other liquid?

Will try suggestions of other reviewers re: slicing in 1/2" slices. Some didn't like the mushiness but all enjoyed the topping. My butter was room temperature so the topping was more pasty than crumbly so had to spread it on but it still turned out great.

This sounded like a unique recipe, but for some reason my husband and I didn't care for it.  We didn't love the texture.  I gave this 4 stars because I will most likely make this again for family gatherings as I know my aunts/uncles/cousins would love this.

This is freaking amazing! I am eating it now and couldn't wait to review it!!!!!! OMGoodness. This is the best ever! I will never be able to eat regular french toast again. A question though... how can I save left overs, I cooked way to many for my small family, but would like to eat them later! Thanks for sharing.

I served this to guests at my B&B this past weekend - they loved it.  I found it a bit too sweet, hence the 4-star rating.  I will serve it again, but cut down on the sugar.  The orange flavor is very nice, though!  Thanks for a good recipe.

This was not as wonderful as I expected it would be from the reviews. Not bad, but VERY sweet and I couldn't really taste the orange. Not worth the effort to make again.

I have made this recipe twice. It is incredible! Very rich and very, very sweet with a heavenly aroma of oranges and cinnamon. Next time I will cut back on the sugar as it was a bit too decadent. But we loved it!

I followed the recipe exactly, and doubled it for a larger group. The cooking time remained the same of about 35 minutes. It was super easy to prepare.  I prepped it the night before, used 1.5 French baguettes, which soaked up all the liquid by morning. Let it sit out as directed for 20 minutes than baked it. The I flipped it over as I served the guests with the sticky gooey yummy side up. Everyone loved it!  I'll definitely make it again when I'm hosting a large group for brunch.

I was disappointed. Much of the carmelized sugar stuck on the bottom of the pan.  What I did lift up was really sticky and chewy. I also did not taste orange at all. I did not have thick bread so used two thinner slices. I might try it again but put the sugar/butter/pecan between the slices. Then I'd make an orange syrup to pour on top when serving.  The taste was OK just not at all what I expected.

I liked how the orange came through, though it was a bit too sweet for my tastes.  The caramel layer seemed thick and distracted from the French toast itself.  I'm glad I tried this recipe, though it's not a keeper for me.

This recipe is an absolutely indulging treat!  Prepared the night before Christmas and served after a fun morning of present opening.  I used egg nog in place of milk and I'll do the same when I make this recipe again.  I found the baking time to be way too short.  After an additional 10 minutes in the oven, the bread was still too soggy in the middle.  Next time I'll bake for ~50 minutes tenting the top with foil after 40 minutes to avoid the top getting burned.

I prepared this for Christmas morning brunch.  My husband looked at the recipe and told me not to make it that he did not think it sounded good.  He admitted later that he was wrong and has asked for it again since then.  The rest of the family (25 in all) loved it too.  Very tasty.  Something different then the usual egg strata/casserole.

Made this for the first time on Christmas day.  It was amazing.  I prepared it all on the same morning with a loaf of day old French bread.  Only changes I made were to use maple syrup instead of corn syrup, 1/2 c. OJ, and reduce the sugar slightly.  Let it refrigerate for one hour and baked 30 minutes.  Delicious!

This was a great company breakfast and didn't require as much time in the kitchen as some other baked french toasts. The only negative is that it was very sweet. In the future I would cut back on the brown suger, or add more bread and milk mixtute to balance it out. I would make this again.

I really enjoyed this dish.  The rolls (they look like carmel pecan rolls when you're done) are very rich, very sweet, but very very good.   It would be perfect for a brunch since it's really easy to prepare ahead and pop in the over 30 minutes before you're ready to serve.  1/2 c of chopped pecans didn't seem like nearly enough.  I doubled that.   Be sure to use good robust bakery bread, sliced thick like it says.  Excellent overall and when you flip them over onto a platter they present beautifully!

Wonderful recipe!! The only change I made was using two round cake pans instead of the 9x13, and it still came out perfect:) Not only does it taste good, it looks beautiful too. Thanks for sharing!!

I made a few tweaks to this recipe.  The first being that I used cinnamon swirl bread (from Trader Joes).  I also used 3 eggs instead of the mixture of eggs and egg whites.  I also pan-fried the french toast, which I felt gave a better crust on the bread.  The flavor of this french toast is incredible.  Serve this to people you want to impress!

This was great.  I don't do a lot of cooking and this was easy enough for me to do.  Only things I changed was using OJ with pulp instead of the rind.  Also, I would submerge each slice of bread in the mixture to fully cover it before placing them in the pan to avoid having to flip them.  The remaining mixture was still poured over the top and I sprinkled extra cinnamon on top.  Excellant!

Served at a baby shower brunch, had people asking for the recipe, so that tells you something! Easy and loved the fact that you can make it the night before.  Made as is, so if you think you need to read 100 reviews to see if you need to make changes, stop reading and just go make it now.  It was great!

This recipe is delicious!  My only modification is to reduce the brown sugar to 3/4 or 2/3 cup and eliminate the corn syrup.  I also made it once without the pecans and didn't like it nearly as much, so don't skip the pecans!

We had this for breakfast this morning and it was very good.  After reading other reviews about how sweet it was I didn't add the corn syrup, the white sugar or powdered sugar on top.  I think I had the brown sugar mixture a bit uneven because some places it seemed to be a bit much and other places was just right.  I toasted the pecans for the richer flavor.  I had both challah and french bread I needed to use up, not enough of one for the pan so I used both, cut into 1 inch slices.  In the places where the bread didn't fit together tight I put in some pieces of bread to take up the space.  I had 4 eggg whites in the fridge so I used all 4 and the 2 whole eggs.  I forgot to add the orange zest but the orange flavor was still noticable, I will add it next time for some extra flavor.  I baked it for 40 minutes because I wanted it a bit more brown that what it was at 35.  We let it sit for about 10 minutes before cutting it and had no soggy bread problems, nice and moist and tasty.  Next time I make this I was thinking about mixing some cinnamon with the brown sugar, melting the butter in the bottom of the pan and sprinkling the brown sugar over it.

Soooooo good!  Very sweet, other reviews are right about it being more of a pecan roll consistency.  I don't use the corn syrup when I make this and it is still plenty sweet.  It tastes best if you use homeade cinamon swirl bread.  I make this everytime I have overnight guests because it is so easy and always gets compliments.

This is delicious. The opinions varied in the family so I only gave it four stars. Those who like sweet things really liked it and those whose sweet taste buds are more conservative thought it was too sweet.

We have done this recipe twice over the past weekends with bettering results. A FAMILY FAVORITE. This second time we've reduced sweet and topped bread with brown sugar, pecans and banana slices. Next we'll try strawberries, blue berries and chocolate.

I made this for Christmas brunch. Everyone loved it! Almost all went back for seconds. I enjoyed a slice that was left over the next day. Definitely will make again.

My husband and I loved this dish. It reminded me somewhat of the PA Dutch sticky buns I grew up with. I halved the recipe, and used skim milk and 2 whole eggs. I baked it in a quiche dish. Served it with a bit of leftover Easter ham and fresh fruit salad. Thanks for sharing this.

I made this for my mother and step-father for his birthday and they loved it! It was delicious and not too sweet. I made no changes from the recipe and followed the exact instructions. The only thing I would maybe do differently would be use staler bread (I used fresh)to give it a thicker consistency.

It got raves!! I substituted a cranberry walnut peasent type loaf; cutting each long slice in half,then sprinkled raisens and more pecans before covering the bottom slice. I did omit the 2 tbls. of sugar in egg mixture.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. It was plenty moist, but the crusts got a little crispy. Perfect. This will be a classic.

I made this recipe Saturday night and cooked it Sunday morning and it was DELICIOUS!!!!!!! I made it exactly the way directed. If you don't like sweets very much I would lighten up on the sugar. And I would recommend to cook it about 50 minutes instead of 35. Other than that it was outstanding!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This french toast was SUCH a hit at yesterday's father's day brunch! I followed what other reviewers said and cut down slightly on the sugar (did about 3/4 cup of brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of white sugar). I also put the bread in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes, turning over halfway through. This kept the bread from getting soggy.
This was so easy to make as well! I made it all overnight and then just in the oven when guests were arriving. Once it was done I let it set for about 5-10 minutes so we got a nice caramelized texture on top. 
I served with cool whip and blueberries, raspberries and blackberries. It was excellent! Not too sweet at all!

I agree that this was too sweet. It also didnt taste like oranges whatsoever, and I even added more orange zest than called for. Ill give it a 3 because it was still good and it was very very easy to make.

Super-easy and super-yummy. The orange taste was mild - next time I'll add more zest.

I made it exactly as directions showed. It was perfect without changing a thing. The wonderful thing is it makes it's own syrup, it takes less time to cook than most overnight french toast recipes and the house smells wonderful while it's baking. This is great for any occassion and to wow a crowd.

This recipe did not turn out for me.  The bread was soggy and the brown sugar mixture was so sticky I thought it was going to pull out my fillings!  The brown sugar was difficult to get out of the pan.

I made this for breakfast yesterday without modifications. I thought it was a very nice dish. My husband didn't like it at all and my son said it was good but way too sweet. I have to agree it was pretty sweet.

I thought this recipe was wonderful!  I did use walnuts rather than pecans and added some extra orange zest, but this was just for my own preference.  If I made again I would probably add a little more egg than the recipe calls for, but thought the egg amount stated in the recipe was fine.  The recipe is a keeper!

i made this for a sunday brunch ...it was amazing!  i followed some of the tips by other reviewers...i baked the bread a few minutes on each side to crisp it up before pouring the egg mixture on....i also cut the cinnamon in half because i was afraid it would be overwhelming ...it wasn't and i think i'll try the full amount next time....yes, there WILL be a next time.  i served it with fresh whipped cream, a friut salad and mimosas.  my guests all loved it. no syrup necessary in my opinion!

Definite keeper...hubby liked it and he claims to have an "elite taster." Goofball. I made it as is and will continue to play with the amount of pecans to suit our tastes (I think I made the pieces too big) but we didn't find it too sweet at all. Thank you!

This is a great base recipe...but needed a lot of improvements.  I used 1/2 the brown sugar and didn't add any white sugar to the egg mixture.  Also used 1/2 cup orange juice and 1 cup milk.  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  It came out PERFECT!  I made it for our Father's day brunch and my family couldn't get enough.  It is just sweet enough with the perfect hint of orange.

This was amazing.  I pretty much made as is, but added some dried cranberries in with the pecan brown sugar mixture.  After baking, I let it sit for about 15 minutes and the nut mixture was nice and gooey.  A holiday favorite.

This recipe was outstanding. We served it for our Mother's Day Brunch and everyone loved it. It is sweet but can be tonned down by omiting the pecan/brown sugar topping in the baking process and sprinkling the pecans over top the French Toast prior to serving. Either way it is awesome and my new all time favorite.

Because I don't have a griddle, making French toast for a big group would be time consuming if I did it on the stove top.  This is so tasty and time-efficient!

This was absolutely delicious! The only changes I made were to substitute the milk and orange juice with egg nog. I also used a mixture of leftover hamburger buns and white cottage bread. Everyone loved it.

This is one of the best french toasts my sister and I have made it for Christmas morning and bridal showers.  Make sure that you cook it long enough otherwise the top can be a little soggy.  But the taste is amazing

This is so delicious!  I used real maple syrup instead of corn syrup and swapped the butter for my favorite Fleischmann's olive oil tub margarine (which doesn't taste like olive oil in case you were wondering).  The orange flavor was such a wonderful suprise and really brightened it up.  Highly recommend!

Wow!! What a great recipe! It's so convenient to prepare it the night before and pop it in the oven the next morning. The combination of orange, brown sugar & pecans was really unique and delicious. I followed the recipe exactly, except I used Italian bread instead of French. I wouldn't change anything else!

This tasted fine, but the bread just tastes a little goopy in your mouth.  The bottom and top was great, but overall, I wont make it again.

This was really out of sight!!  It was super easy to make, and so good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect.  If you are going to have people over for brunk or breakfast this would be a perfect thing to serve.

I don't think I can say enough about how DELICIOUS this is! I loved the extra zing the orange zest added and if I had to compare the taste to anything, it would be to a pecan cinnamon roll with orange glaze icing. Before dusting with powdered sugar, I inverted the slices onto serving plates and it just looked beautiful! I'll be adding this favorite to my brunch menu!

Love it!!  Made everything the same as stated in the recipe, but sprinkled a few more pecans on top of the recipe.  Take the advice and make it the night before and you'll have less stress in the morning.  Pair it up with the egg and sausage casserole and mimosas and bam! you got brunch.

Very good, though a bit too sweet for our liking.  Our first attempt used HALF the sugar and was still sugary(if you wanted more than 2 pieces).  More of a treat than breakfast.

This was a huge hit when I took it into work for a breakfast feast I provided for our staff. However I flipped them over in  to have the sugar and nuts on the top. The picture shows the nuts and sugar on top and the recipe calls for it to be on the bottom. I'm not sure if that's ok, but it sure looked better.  I am a true believer in the dish starts with the presentation. Either way... this was an amazing recipe, easy to make and easier to please everyone! Thank you allrecipe you are always my "go to" place for deliciousness.

Oh my stars! This was fabulous! I will definitely make it again. Hubby really enjoyed it, too. I loved the orange flavors. The bottom was like candy, although it did stick to the pan, even though I greased the bottom with lots of butter. I didn't have corn syrup so I substituted 2 Tbsp real maple syrup, so maybe that's why it stuck (???).  Next time I'll try drizzling the brown sugar/butter/corn syrup mixture over the top of the custard-soaked bread, then sprinkling the pecans on top, too, just before baking.

This was so good!  We had 20 people for brunch and everyone raved over the French toast (doubled the recipe).  After reading the reviews, I toasted the bread for 20 minutes at 350 degrees (perfect), added more orange zest to the egg/milk/juice mixture using 8 whole eggs in wet recipe the night before. In the morning there were a few dry spots on the bread so I  beat 2 more eggs with about ½ cup milk to cover them.  Spread the brown sugar mixture on top of the bread the next morning and added chopped candied pecans.  Baked as directed.  Everyone requested the recipe!  Will definitely be making this again!

This really hit the spot on Christmas morning!  I've made several overnight french toast dishes and will make this one again.  I made a few adjustments according to my preferences but overall stayed pretty true to the original recipe.  I lined a 10x14 dish with parchment paper to keep the mess to a min.  I  don't really measure, but used at least a cup or more of chopped pecans and increased the amount of the sugar mixture. And I used a loaf of diced texas toast bread (that I left out to crisp up a bit) instead of french bread.  I also found that it works best for me to leave the foil on for the first 25 minutes of cooking so the top doesn't dry out.

Sorry to give this one such a poor review. I’m not sure what went wrong. My casserole turned out very mushy. I removed the hard crust and added more bread to compensate, perhaps that is why. The top was way too sweet. No one liked it.

Okay so I have to say I WAS QUITE DISAPPOINTED with this recipe. After searching and searching allrecipes.com and reading most of the reviews, I thought for sure this would be an excellent french toast recipe for Christmas brunch. Boy was I sadly mistaken. It really was nothing special. I follow most users reviews in that I added the extra eggs and orange zest and also cutting the bread an inch thick. I let the dish sit overnight and by the time we baked it and ate it, the egg mixture had only soaked down to barely the top portion EVEN AFTER I pressed on the bread while pouring the egg mixture onto it. The pecan topping was ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT. It was sweet with a hint of orange something.

Tastes great. Needs more pecans per my tastes. Doubled the amount called for and could still use a few more. If you like pecan pie, then you'll want to add extra pecans. Otherwise, it's just a sprinkling of nuts as it is.

I liked the bits of orange peel in this, but it does need to be grated fine.  The spice of it was just right.  This is a nice offering for any brunch.

Such a great recipe! I edited it a little bit. For those who are wondering about putting the brown sugar mixture on the bottom, this is what I did. First off, I used 4 eggs, 3/4 cup oj, 1/2 cup milk, and 1/4 cup half and half. I then added the cinnamon and vanilla as well as a bit of nutmeg and allspice and the zest of an entire orange. I didn't use any white sugar. I then placed the bread in the pan and poured the mixture over the bread and let it sit overnight in the fridge. In the morning, before placing it in the oven, I mixed half a cup of brown sugar, 1/4 cup melted butter, 2 tbsp maple syrup, and 1/3 cup chopped pecans. I then spread this mixture over the top of each slice of bread and then put it in the oven for 45 min. It made a delicious brown sugar crust and tasted heavenly. Nothing stuck to the bottom and everyone loved it. Just a thought for those that worry about it sticking to the pan!

Made this for visiting guests.  Just prepped it the morning of and let it sit 1 hour before putting in the oven and came out great.  Not too sweet...tripled the pecans because I love them, and it was perfect.  Gone in minutes with people going in for seconds and thirds

Absolutely a hit. I am going to use orange extract next time instead of vanilla. I would like more of an orange flavor. Very easy to assemble and cook. Great for a crowd or for two.

Very nice, we all enjoyed the subtle orange flavor.  We found it to be a little lighter than the traditional cream based baked French toast recipes I have tried.   I used a challah bread I had made instead of the French bread – just a personal preference.  If you are going to use thick slices of bread as I did, I would increase the liquid mixture slightly.  It was a nice change of pace from our usual baked French toast.

I made this for Mother's day brunch. Everyone loved it. It was so easy to prepare. I was so glad I made the full recipe for only eight of us so we could have leftovers. This is a keeper and something I plan to make again and again. Thank you for such a great recipe!

An absolute winner! Will definitely be making this again. The only complaint was that it was very sweet. Might cut out the white sugar next time. The syrup is sweet enough!

This was amazing. I made it for Mother's Day brunch. The only thing I did differently was cut the bread thicker and soaked it before I put it in the dish. By doing that I should have baked it longer as some pieces in the middle were not done enough. It was a huge hit!

I have made this for Christmas morning two years in a row.  The sweet smell of orange and cinnamon filling the house is (almost) enough to tear the kids away from their toys.  Absolutely delicious with real maple syrup!

Very good.  Added orange flavored cranberries (not sure I noticed them).  Could only fit 10 pieces of bread in my pan. Let sit 10 min after baking, as suggested by a reviewer.

Disagree with previous reviewer. This was very good as is. the only change I made was to use 5 whole eggs since I like it custardy. the orange flavor is very mild (if you use fresh oj as the recipe calls for)so no need to use less. took this to a work breakfast and everyone loved it. Very easy so will make it again...as written!

I'm not a fan of french toast but this was amazing! I followed the recipe almost exactly, though next time I will sub maple syrup for the corn syrup, just because I don't care to use corn syrup. The only other thing I did different was I didn't measure the orange zest. I used 3 large oranges for the juice and I used all the zest off the oranges, which may have been more than what was called for, but I would do it again. I've made this twice for weekend company and it was a huge hit, with everyone asking for the recipe.

Great flavor!!!!  But a little too sweet.  I cut the recipe in half and used 3 whole eggs, and real maple syrup instead of corn syrup ... and regular sliced whole wheat bread.  Foolish me didn't read the reviews first, but it looked like too much brown sugar, so I reduced it, but not enough.  I'll use half next time and I'm sure it'll be perfect.

Made it for Mother's day breakfast. All generations of our family LOVED it!
(I did turn down the sweet ingredients by almost half though)
Thank you for a delicious keeper.

If you've never tried baking french toast, this is a great recipe to use.  The flavors of the ingredients really compliment each other.  Also, don't be afraid to squeeze in those bread slices.

It was OK.  There was definitely a problem with getting the caramel out of the bottom of the pan once it cooled a little.  My kids really liked it, but my husband hated it.

This was way too sweet, but the texture was right on.  I used day old Italian bread and followed the recipe exactly. I'll make it again, but I'll leave out the white sugar and the powdered sugar and I'll cut the brown sugar and corn syrup by half.  The orange flavor is great.

Just made this for a brunch with my friends and we all agreed this was really good. I was so worried the bread would get soggy..but it turned out really good. I used Challah bread like someone else suggested.
I like it was so easy since you put it together the night before.
I am definitely going to try it out on my inlaws when they come and spend the night with us this summer. Thanks!

What a great breakfast.  I was afraid it would be too soggy, but it wasn't.  The edges were nice and crisp, and the center was soft, but had a great texture.  I made the morning I served it, refrigerating for an hour.  Next time I'll add more Orange zest (or maybe use fresh OJ) and double the pecans. ---Update:  It even re-heats well in the microwave!  Obviously loses a bit of it's great texture, but still very good.  Had leftovers for breakfast two days in a row.

Great flavor....but way too soggy.  We ate the soggy toast, but the rest I flipped over in the pan and cooked for another 20 minutes.  After I took it out, (it was still soggy) I let it sit for 15 minutes.  It's a lot better.  Next time, I might be tempted to put it in the skillet instead of baking it for so long---but wouldn't that defeat the purpose of baked french toast?

Very good! Next time I will add a few more pecans, but otherwise, this was a great breakfast. I didn't have french bread, so I used leftover homemade white bread and it was great.

Excellent breakfast treat! I made this for my fiance, and he is a major sweet lover.  He had the syrup all cranked up and ready to pour, and then we realized that the french toast was perfect without the syrup. It is almost like upside down cinnamon rolls, and they melt in your mouth! Definitely adding this to my collection of great recipes!

This is some good stuff, Maynard!  "Mmmmm..." is all my boys could break long enough to say, and my husband expressed, without being asked, "That stuff is good!"  This goes into my recipe book.  I used cinnamon-swirl bread, and I left out the corn syrup (didn't really see the point of it); these are the only changes I made.  Good stuff!

This recipe was great! It makes a great compliment to any breakfast brunch. I increased the butter/sugar mix by 1/2 for a more 'gooey' topping. I let it set for about 10 minutes before serving, allowing time for the sauce to cool. I will definately make this again, and again, and again. Thanks for sharing!!!

It was a hit at our brunch. I might tweak it and use a little less sugar, but otherwise it was perfect.

This is a great variation to your breakfast menu.  I prepared the night before and then baked in the morning.  It would go great with a cream cheese frosting!

Great flavor but it's too mushy!!! What did I do wrong? I was so looking forward to eating this. I've made an overnight French toast before and it turned out good so I don't understand. Maybe do the chill in the fridge for an hour instead of overnight. The bread's sogginess just wouldn't bake.

Fabulous! Made a half recipe (8x8 pan). Used challah bread that had been in the freezer. Didn’t have oranges but had clementines. 2 clementines gave me 1/2 c juice and I used the zest from one of them (well over the recipe amount but we love the orange flavor). So easy. So yummy.

It was more wet in the middle than I thought. It needed more orange flavor also. Overall it tasted good.

This is a real winner.  I used unsalted butter also used 2 T sugar instead of 3T.  [Just tried to make it healthier.]  It was still delicious.  I will be making this again.

I have been wanting to try this recipe for awhile but needed more than just the hubs and me to eat it.  I finally got a chance this weekend when we hosted out of town family for a brunch.  The only change I made was to use maple syrup instead of karo syrup, and that was because I didn't have the latter.  Everyone raved about this.  No syrup was needed for the top.  I will be making this again, and I am glad there is a little bit left for me to eat tomorrow!

This is a wonderful breakfast dessert.  If you do not like overly sweet meals at breakfast cut the sugar in half and have bacon as a side.

I made it as written and my family liked it.  I would make it again but leave out the sugar in the egg mixture (and I have a non-ending sweet tooth) and cut down the amount of OJ to maybe 1/2 cup by substituting milk instead.  We all agreed that we would like a hint of orange but that it was the predominant flavor, along with the sweetness of the caramel topping.

I made this recipe for a brunch party and everyone liked it!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was delicious as is.  However , I think I would add a little more orange zest next time.

Should have taken a picture before I served this delightful tasty French toast, because there were no leftovers! People think when they see it in the pan, Oh French Toast, then you dish it out turned over & they say OH MY!! Next time I may cut the white sugar, but when I mentioned this while dining, everyone said Don't change Anything!

I don't usually write reviews but this french toast was awesome!  And I made it as written besides a little less sugar just for personal preference and I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup as I didn't have any.  I would highly recommend this dish!!  I refrigerated overnight and it turned out great!

Wow! This is so good, I cut the brown sugar by a third and the white sugar by using tsp instead of TBSP.  (I also sprinkled a touch of sea salt atop the mixture before placing the bread down.). I had to bake it 5-10 minutes longer.  My family loved this recipe! (I had to leave a partial area without pecans for one crazy kid.) I have already shared the recipe with four others and want to say thank you to the OP!  I have not been able to find a recipe I liked for baked french toast before now and this will be a new family fav!

This was a delicious breakfast dish, but be prepared for a very sweet taste.  We did not add any extra powdered sugar.  I baked it longer than the recommended 35 minutes because the bread was still very wet.  I would say 45-50 minutes was required, and letting it sit for 10 minutes after baking is a good idea.

This is so good I can't wait to make it again and I'm not a sweets for breakfast kind of person. When I make French toast I do it my own unique way and my husband says it's the world's best. This recipe uses a lot of the same ingredients. Yummy!

This was awesome for Easter breakfast today!  That slightly orange flavor was light and refreshing...I used 4 whole eggs, cause what am I going to do with extra yolks?

So great! I was out of vanilla, so I subbed in a splash of Grand Marnier for that. My only recommendation is to make sure you get the French toast out of the pan before it cools down if you have leftovers. That caramel is delicious, but it solidifies into a sticky glue that's hard to chip out of even the most well greased pan!

No, I wanted to rate the recipe the way it is. I laugh at some cooks who rate a recipe after they have completely changed it , then say thank you for a great recipe.

I made this for Christmas morning and everyone loved it.  I did make a few changes:  I increased the pecans to 3/4 cup since we love pecans and then I toasted them.  After that, I only broke them up into smaller pieces rather than a fine chop.  Also I decreased the brown sugar to 3/4 cup and still found it a tad sweet, I may go to 2/3 cup of brown sugar next time.  Finally, I was quite generous with the orange zest, pressing it down for a heaping teaspoon full.  This dish was delicious!

Didn't have orange juice so I used apple juice instead.  Still fantastic.  Next time I'll try it with apple juice and chopped apples.

This was a hit for Christmas morning breakfast! My only suggestion is flipping it upside down onto a new platter once you take it out of the oven. If you don't, and aren't eating the whole thing immediately, it makes it difficult to cut and serve (even if you need to reheat a piece). Other than that minor difficulty, this breakfast casserole is amazing!

This is an exceptional Baked French Toast recipe, and so convenient that you can prepare it the night before baking. After reading the reviews, I did make some adjustments - I substituted maple syrup for the corn syrup, doubled the orange zest, added 2 tbsp of milk, omitted the cinnamon, used 5 whole eggs (for the 3 egg whites and 2 eggs), and I cut the bread in 1" slices. I baked it in the 9"x 13" pan for 45 minutes, and let it sit for 5 minutes before serving. No syrup required for this sweet brunch dish. Thanks for sharing the recipe SR!

Followed the instructions to a T. It was delicious and everybody loved it. Next time I will cook a tiny bit longer though as it was a little underdone. Still a winner though!!

It's funny how these less intelligent people will look up a recipe and proceed to change everything about it listing all the changes they made until it's not even the same recipe lol. Silly silly people.

Anyways, great recipe. Thanks!

awesome. Easy, would definitely make again. Made right away, only refrigerated about 30 min and then set out and baked. Done right at 35 min. Quite delicious, made as written, other than substituting maple syrup for corn syrup and using a lot more pecans. Needed about 18 pieces of bread to cover bottom of 9x13 pan. Could cut back on the sugar slightly.

Excellent!   Used cinnamon bread because that is what I had on hand--layered 2 slices to make it 1inch thickness.    Otherwise, I Followed the recipe exactly.   The leftovers I cut into small rectangles and used like a muffin/bar the next day.....even the leftovers were delicious!

Made it twice. Once just as recipe said. You can not say anything bad or good until you make it as is. Well it was good as is. But I added twice plus the nuts, did cut stale bread 1 inch thick. Let it rest in oven for 10-15 minutes. took it out and turn over onto serving plate scrap left over in pan onto this easy recipe. Grand kids love that they could help before bedtime and in the morning make breakfast for everyone all by themselves. Now the grand kids make it for me each time they come over for a sleepover.  It's a type of bread pudding but just better.

I made this recipe as its written, very easy and I liked making it the night before.  It fed 6 people, rather than 12, 2 pieces each. It was delicious!  Rich, and sweet.  I couldn't taste the orange in it as much as I thought I would.  The caramel sauce was wonderful though, and it is definitely a family favorite now.

These were very easy, I made them the night before and popped them in the oven in the morning. Everyone loved them however if I were to change anything I would use stale bread or toast the french bread pieces before hand. The bottoms were nice and crispy but the tops were a bit soggy due to them sitting in the mixture all night.

This was delicious.  I was unsure that's I'd like the orange flavor because I'm not a citrus fan, but it was really good, especially with the pecans.  The whole family gave the thumbs-up.

I thought the French toast was amazing, I decided to make it for New Years Eve Breakfeast. It was delectable, they were very sweet and moist, and when the flavor hits your mouth you feel joy throughout. This recipe was extremely easy to follow. I added some red pepper flakes to the cinnamon topping, and it added spice and amazing flavor. Thank you so much for introducing me to this new type of Breakfeast.

This was so simple to make and we loved it. It was devoured quickly! I followed the recipe exactly. I let it refrigerate overnight which made breakfast in the morning so simple.

Excuse me, But 20 mins of prep time plus 35 mins of cook time does not equal 1 h 55 mins!

Definitely way too sweet. Also, I thought it was done because the bread was done on top but once I took a slice and ate it, it was pretty soggy in the middle. The orange flavor was good.

This was AMAZING! The brown sugar turns into a super sweet glaze on top, I like sweets, and I thought this was perfect. I loved that I could prepare this ahead of time!

A big hit at our house!  Very few changes that were suggested in previous reviews.  1" sliced wheat French bread, 3 eggs/2whites, only 1 TBSP sugar in egg mixture, slightly baked bread and used a 10 x 15 pan to accommodate 12 pieces.  The finished product was easily served with all the goodies on top, crispy and slightly soft inside.  Sprinkled with powdered sugar!!  Fantastic, a sure keeper!

This was delicious. Definitely a keeper. I didn't have pecans so I used walnuts...turned out great. Small suggestion, let it sit for about 15 minutes before cutting.

Made these for the first time Christmas morning. Rave reviews all around. My only suggestion would be to make more than 2 slices each, everyone will want seconds.

Yummy, yummy, yummy! I made it for Christmas brunch and it was a hit. The only modification I made was to add an extra egg in place of the egg whites, since I didn't want to think up something to do with the yolks.

This dish was a hit with my family!  The combination of orange & caramel flavors are delicious and I love that it is prepared the night before.  I would highly recommend this; we'll be having it again on Christmas morning!

This recipe was one of the few recipes I kept as is. I made no adjustments and it was great. I served it for Mothers day last year and I had many many requests to make it again.

This has become our Christmas morning breakfast.  I make it the day before and just pop it in the oven in the morning.  It's a bit decadent, perfect for a special breakfast.

Made this  Christmas morning for my husband and I.  It was great and a keeper receipe!! I halfed the receipe, used 3 whole eggs instead of egg whites, more nuts than called for, and Italian bread.  Baked it in a 9 inch square pan.

Amazing!!! Everyone loved it. After reading the reviews I cut back the sugar and corn syrup by a little bit and added a little most zest. Everyone at the brunch really liked it.

I really liked this, and I'm not a fan of french toast.  That being said, it was rather sweet and I didn't use the corn syrup or confectioners sugar.  So with the added sugar I think I would have been too sweet for me.  My bread was soft but crunchy on the ends, which I really liked.  I couldn't find my pecans when I was making this last night (that's what happens when I'm tired) but this morning I found them and toasted them in a pan, then just sprinkled over the top and served.  I'll put them in the pan next time.  Thanks for the recipe; I'll make it again!

I have made this recipe several times now and it always comes out scrumptious. It is a great way to use up left over crusty french bread. It makes a great brunch meal.

I followed this recipe exactly except I did leave out the Pecans. It was the best french toast I have ever had. And I am not a fan of french toast. It was sweet so no syrup was needed. I definitely recommend this recipe.
