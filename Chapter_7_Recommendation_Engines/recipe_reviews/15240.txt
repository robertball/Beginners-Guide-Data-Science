Hubby and I both love sesame seeds and enjoyed them this new way. Only drawback is that they seemed pretty lean on sesame seeds.  Next time I'm going to add 1 cup and see how they turn out. It might take some tweaking but I'm hoping they'll have more sesame flavor.

The doctor told me that sesame seeds are a very good source of calcium- a tablespoon a day is what he recommended.  This recipe is a delicious way to incorporate them into your diet!  Be careful not to overcook so that the bars turn out moist.  I added raisins too. Fantastic!

Liked this one.   The kids and hubby too.  I used mini muffin tins since my Pyrex dish is (still) missing, it made 32 total.   Also, added extra sesame seeds per others reviews. Browns quickly..keep an eye on it!  Next time I will try it as bars.  thanks!

Excellent bars! Very easy and quick to make. I followed the recipe adding a sprinkle of powdered sugar to the finished product. They are very reminiscent of a peanut butter bar. Enjoyed by all.

It wasn't what I was expecting, but it still tasted good.  The only thing I changed/added was cashew nuts.  Since the cashew nuts were salted I omitted the salt from the recipe.

Not too bad but not what I expected. I think I would have like the cookies rolled in the toasted sesame seeds as opposed to the seeds being IN the cookie.
