Let me just say that these are a great idea.  I was hesitant to make them for a party, because I am known as the Martha Stewart of my group of friends, and I usually spend lots of time and effort on everything I make.  I didn't want to ruin my reputation by making something easy, but I was running out of time!  For this recipe, I used two 10" tortillas for each quesadilla-- one on the bottom and one on top.  When they were done, I cut them with a pizza cutter for cute pizza-slice-shaped appetizers.  For the sauce in the quesadillas, I used my favorite pizza sauce recipe:  3 (8 oz) cans of tomato sauce, 1 (6 oz) can of tomato paste, 1 tablespoon dried oregano, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried marjoram, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil, 1 teaspoon garlic salt, and 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon white sugar.  (Combine all in saucepan, bring to a simmer to combine flavors, and adjust seasonings to taste.  Use leftovers dipping sauce for the quesadillas!)  I used mozzerella cheese, pepperoni, sun-dried tomatoes, and sliced italian sausage links inside, and they were sooooooooo good.  One thing to note-- these hold together really well if you put cheese down as the first layer (after sauce) and again as the last layer after the other ingredients.  Everyone thought these were great.  I called them PIZZADILLAS.  Yum, yum!

These are so good!  We have them almost every week now.:-)  I did make a couple of changes.  We used cheddar and mozzerella cheese, and we added olives and sauteed mushrooms with the pepperoni for "toppings"  Also so we don't burn them, we cook on the stove until the tortilla is golden and then put the on a cookie sheet in a heated oven.  That way the cheese melts and they stay warm while the others are be cooked.  Thanks for the recipe!!

Awesome little snack! So simple and especially good when you're craving pizza. I used "Pasta/Pizza Sauce" from this site and opted to cook these in the oven @ 375 for about 15 minutes on a foil lined baking sheet. I sprayed a little Pam so nothing would stick. I used an Italian cheese blend and used a combination of pepperoni and salami. I left the sauce on the side for dipping and these were oh so good! You could easily put your favorite ingredients inside this and design your ideal pizza wrap - YUMMY!

My mom has made these for 20+ years.  She, however, put down foil, then a tortilla and the fixings *yes cheese first and last* then folded tortilla over and sealed the foil up and put them *IN* the oven for 30 minutes at 350 degrees.  I make this often when the kids are feeling picky and I am in a pinch for dinner or lunch or snack time.

We used to have a caterer that brought these into work and I would buy one every time.  This is exactly how there were made except the also had suasage, canadian bacon and supreme (that had pepperoni, sausage and green peppers).  You can play around with these and they're very tasty!  They also make a quick lunch!

Good quick dinner. I didn't use the margerine (my pan was a non stick) and I made my own pizza sauce. Inside my own pizza "quesadilla", I added pickled jalapenos. Kids especially liked this.

Very good, and simple!
I didn't use any butter at all...I used a nonstick pan, and didn't need to use anything. I want to stress what another reviewer said..put cheese down as the first and last layer, and they hold together really well.  The recipe says to use a tablespoon of sauce on each one, but I like a lot of sauce, so I put a few spoonfuls on each one. They were very messy! Next time (and there WILL be a next time) I will follow the recipe and use the correct amount of sauce! Or I might try just serving the sauce on the side.
I served them with a little salad, it made a cute little dinner for my husband and me!
Yum!

Since I'm pretty much obsessed with any form of pizza, I've been making these for years. I use mozzarella, store brand pizza sauce (which I like better than the brand name), and turkey pepperoni. I use cooking spray instead of butter. I sometimes eat these as a wrap, cold with fresh tomato, kind of like a pizza lunchable (some think it's gross, but I like it) and also pop them in the toaster oven or microwave.

very fast to put together/cook. nice alternative to traditional quesadillas and pizza. i added a little more cheese on top of the pepperoni to ensure a good "seal" with the top half of the tortilla. versatile recipe because you can choose your own fillings. perfect for a quick lunch or no-fuss dinner.

What a great idea!  My son makes Mexican quesadillas almost everyday  for a fast lunch-now he has something new to eat.  These are so versatile, we added some sauted mushrooms, onions and bell pepper to ours to have with an antipasto salad I made one warm evening.

I was disappointed but it was my fault. My oven is broken and until I get it fixed I get by with the stove top, microwave and toaster oven. I had been craving pizza, which is one of the few things I really need a full size oven for, and this sounded like a great idea to make “pizza” on the stove top in a skillet. We like our pizza with all the goodies so I tried to load up the tortillas with onions, mushrooms, black olives, peppers, sausage, pepperoni and cheese. They were so full that the cheese didn’t melt all the way through the fillings to hold it together and they were very messy to flip. The fillings fell out all over the skillet. I used the 2 tortilla method-one on the top and one on the bottom- instead of the fold over method. Also cooking the tortillas long enough to heat all the fillings tended to make the tortillas tough and rubbery. I did try to anticipate this and even pre-cooked the onions and peppers a couple of minutes in the microwave.  I never did cut them into wedges. They were already too messy. I was expecting the flavor to be just like a thin crispy crust pizza. The pizza filling was tasty just like pizza but my head kept insisting that I ought to be tasting something Mexican between the tortillas. This is the one single reason I wouldn’t make these again even though the method could be refined for less cooking of the tortillas and making them stick together better with the cheese for flipping. Perhaps folding them up like burritos to keep the fillings i

Great idea that can easily be tweaked to accommodate any taste. These turn out just as well if you spread all the toppings on your open tortillas, fold and place on a nonstick (or greased) cookie sheet. Bake in a 350 oven til warm and melty. Let them cool a bit and then cut into quarters with SCISSORS. I know it sounds weird, but it works better than anything else!

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars just for the inspiration it's given me. Originally I went to make a wrap but now I just make everything "pizza like".  We spray Pam in a hot pan, add 10 inch tortilla, and as it's heating we add pizza sauce, garlic powder, oregano and basil, diced or sliced tomatoes, red pepper, ham, pineapple, mozzarella and Parmesan.  Wait a few minutes to let the cheese melt a bit.  By this time the bottom of the tortilla is nice and brown.  Remove from pan, put pizza on pizza pan and place in oven.  Cook it for an additional 10 minutes or so on broil/toast setting until cheese begins to brown a bit.  (Any watery vegetables must first be drained - we use paper towels to get as much water out as we can when dealing with tomatoes, pineapple, zucchini, etc.  We also toast the red pepper a bit before adding to pizza, and cook and squeeze dry with paper towels any pepperoni before adding to any pizza.)  We've made this pizza, veggie pizza, tuna melt pizza (using "Barbie's tuna salad" from this site along with sliced tomatoes and swiss cheese.  To me it's just like eating thin crust pizza - except you can make any exotic pizza you like for about two dollars.  Just make sure to drain and pat dry very well any veggies you're adding to the pizza.  Thanks for the inspiration.

I did this as each individual tortilla. One tortilla has 1 Tbs. spaghetti sauce, 17 turkey pepperonis, sauted onions and bell pepper, and 1/8 c. shredded cheddar cheese. each serving has 255 cal and 9.25 g of fat.

We really liked these, especially my kids.  I used turkey pepperoni and didn't put the sauce inside the tortilla, but served it on the side.  If you are looking for a super fast, easy, tasty, kid-friendly dinner, this is it!

The possibilities for the filling is endless.  I made this today for lunch for myself and my 13 month old daughter. Instead of margarine I used EVOO and mozzarella and sharp cheddar cheese. I also add some sausage. This was a quick easy delicious meal.

Oh my... So simple and so delicious! I used colby-mozzarella jack cheese and added a little bit of bacon bits. I had prepared all the fixin on half of the tortilla first (sauce, cheese, pepperoni, bacon bits, cheese),melt butter to the pan, transfer the fixed tortilla flat on the pan, fold over when soft and press with turner, flip and press again until crispy.

I've made these so many times for my little guy, and he just loves them!  Sometimes I add the sauce inside (just eyeball it) and sometimes I serve it on the side for dipping or eliminate it all together and just use salsa and sour cream on the side (his favorite). Also, I always just bake mine in the oven, spay the tops w/ cooking spray and bake @ 400 degrees for about 8-10 mins. or so, just until browned and all melty. A real kid pleaser! :)

Great easy dinner! Toddler was a little suspicious, but eventually warmed up to them. I like that you can add whatever you want to make a little pizza. I think I'll try Canadian bacon and pineapple next time. I'll also use the full sized griddle next time so that we can all eat at the same time.

My boyfriend and I absolutely love these, we have them occasionally for lunch or a little snack throughout the day. I also saute onions in butter and put them in w/ the cheese, pepperonis and pizza sauce, turns out great every time and they're very quick and easy to make! We always have left over tortillas from tacos and such so it works out great. I definitely recommend these for others, they're very kid friendly as well and I'd imagine you could try w/ other ingredients too. Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe!

These were great!  I could make the pizza each person likes.  I used my griddle and they worked great.  I prefered not folding the tortillas but using two.

Made exactly as written.  Very convenient and quick to use up ingredients I had on hand.  If I make them again I think I will add sauteed onions and peppers to add some flavor.  Thanks for the quick dinner idea.  Served with a fresh chopped salad.

This is a great idea!!! My bf is really picky when it comes to dinner.  I am pregnant, craving pizza ALL the time!!! He was tired of pizza so this was an alternative and a lil healthier for the baby and I.  My bf loved it!!!   I made pepperoni, and lean hamburger wraps.. so delicious.  Really loved the butter on the tortillia!!

This tasted good but doesn't want to fold very easily so I probably won't make them again.  I also tried to fold them burrito-style and that didn't work very well either.  I found them to be too greasy, also.  Sorry.

I do daycare and this was a big hit. I served applesauce on the side to complete the meal. My husband saw the kids eating them and asked me to make him a couple too. He loved them. This will be a definate every two week meal for daycare.

I made these last night for a quick, easy, mess free meal. I cooked them on the George Forman grill and they turned out GREAT! I used a blend of mozzarella and provel cheeses, pepporonnis, italian seasoning and garlic powder. I used PAM on the outside of the tortilla and cooked for about 2 minutes on each side. I didn't have any sauce on hand but will def use some nextime- but they had great flavor w/o it!!

A certain restaurant that makes you Thank Goodness It's Friday used to have something on the menu called Pizzadillas - I absolutely loved them & of course, they didn't stay on the menu.  It's good to be able to try to replicate them at home!!  I love how versatile these can be - there are endless varieties depending on your personal tastes!

This recipe was really fast and tasty, in fact my husband said it looked like fun cooking them so he came in and took over the cooking. We also made Mexican Pizzas just swaping out pizza swauce for taco sauce and we mixed chopped sirloin with taco seasoning packet and used that for the meat instead of the pepporoni's. So we ended up having Italian for lunch and Mexican for supper. This would be great for a little family project for the kids. I had three grown men making them and having a blast. Thanks for the recipe it was wonderful.

I had some leftover meatballs, so I sliced them up and used them instead of pepperoni.  Used mozzerella and parmesan cheese inside and sprayed the tortillas with cooking spray instead of margerine. I thought they were great!!

I used mozzerella and cheddar cheese, and these were great.  Make sure you evenly press down on the folded tortillas with a spatula so that they are nice and evenly cooked.

My husband and I have 5 kids and own our own business. Needless to say time is in high demand in this house. I came across this recipe and decided to give it a try. I have one thing to say: AMAZING!!! Not only was it fast to make but the entire family loved it. My favorite part: with 7 mouths to feed there are many different favorites, this allowed me to cater to everyone's taste buds very easily.

I thought these were pretty good. They are not a subtitute for pizza, but an interesting take on a quesadilla. I did really like how fast they were to make. To lighten the calories and saturated fat I used lite butter and mozzarella cheese and added the cheese to taste. I also made them vegetarian and left out the pepperoni. For the sauce I used a modified version of "Easy Pizza Sauce III." The best part is they really can be made to taste.

Easy and tasty!  I "degreased" the pepporoni per other reviews suggestion.  I did have pizza blend cheese and it melted well.  Had about a half a container of pizza sauce and got to use that up too!

Easy. I used turkey pepperoni, and added some onion. Was okay, but not spectacular. Will try again with some additional ingredients.

Simple and good.  I added some diced green pepper and sliced black olive - anything you like on a pizza will be great.  We made these on our George Foreman grill and it worked really well.  Next time we'll experiment with different cheese and maybe some sort of white pizza sauce.

I've been making these for a long time.  However, I put the sauce, cheese, and "toppings" on half of a tortilla, fold the other side over and put grill it in a George Foreman grill.  It only takes 2 mins and is cooked perfectly.  You also don't have the added fat and calories from the butter.  My daughter loves them!

I loved this b/c it was easy, quick and yummy!  I only used 1 tortilla and folded it in half...that was enough for just me.  I didn't have pepperoni so I used mozzarella and sauce which tasted great!  I fried at medium heat, which was low enough to allow the cheese to melt and not burn the outside.  Next time I will try different fillings!

Very Good and sooo easy!! My 3 year old loved them. I layered tortilla, cheddar cheese, pizza sauce, turkey pepperoni, cheese, and the other tortilla. I omitted the butter all together, definately not necessary.  Thanks for the post:)

What a wonderful lunch idea!!  I made these this afternoon for my boys and myself, and they were such a hit!  My 15 month old loved them so much, he screamed with excitement after each bite.  It was quite entertaining.  I will definitely be making these more often.  Thank you Ultracruiser!!

This was great!  I made a variation of our favorite pizza - bacon cheeseburger.  I filled the shells with ground beef and bacon pieces (plus cheese and sauce) and topped with a thin layer of mayo, lettuce, and diced tomatoes.  It was just like the real thing!

Easy, fast, delicious and fattening. Did spray the tortilla with cooking spray but it gets cancelled out three times over with the cheese, pepperoni and tortilla. Will make these again just not real soon.

My husband loved them!  I also added mushrooms and italian sausage when I made them.  Used mozzerella cheese with a little bit of cheddar instead of following recipe.  Nice because you can let everyone pick the fillings they want and everyone is happy - not like ordering pizza and having to argue over the choice of toppings.  Quick and easy!

FAST and simple lunch or snack.   Rather than fold over one tortilla I made them with one tortilla on the top and one on the bottom.

I made this to take to a super bowl party.  Everyone loved it and it was SOOOOO easy to make. Have made this for quick lunches, suppers and appetizers several times since then.  The only change I make is to use Hunt's Zesty Spaghetti sauce in the can.  It is much cheaper than the jar pizza sauce around here and my family likes the added little kick.

Um.....hello....BRILLIANT??!?!?!  It seems so simple but it's soooo satisfying.  Had some supplies leftover from making Pizza on the Grill I (from Allrecipes), and always have tortillas on hand so.....this was perfect.  Pepperoni or not, it's awesome either way!

This was a good variation on a quesedia however there is a lot of fat in pepperoni.  I always render the fat as you would bacon before using it in any recipe.

Very good recipe. I would have never thought of doing this. Makes a quick easy meal. I put green olives and some other goodies but one of those recipes you make towards your tastes and can't really mess it up.

Awesome recipe! I'm on Weight Watchers and was making regular pizza for my family, and I wanted more bang for my buck (one little 5 oz slice wasn't going to fill me up). Here's how I lightened up the recipe: I weighed out light mozza cheese with a kitchen scale (30 g) and used 2 oz of meat (half pepperoni and half ham - I had it thinly sliced).  I also sauteed mushrooms and onions (I used canned as they are smaller than fresh.   I split these ingredients between 2 tortillas (I used the Weight Watchers ones) so I had to use more pizza sauce (a little over 1 tbsp on each).  I followed the cooking instructions except for I used Becel cooking spray.  I splurged and dipped in 1 tbsp light ranch which only added one point.  My total (not incl ranch) was 11 points and I got to eat 2 tortillas - I almost couldn't finish both.  The meat really bumps up the points so I would imagine a person could experiment and put more veggies in - as long as they are cut small/thinly sliced - I didn't really have a problem with ingredients falling out.  I also made one for my 20 month old (easier for him to eat it this way than traditional pizza) and he loved it as well.  Thanks for allowing me to enjoy pizza along with my family and not feel deprived - definitely a 5 star in my book!

This was so easy and so good.  Me, my husband and picky 2-year-old all loved them.  I just made the whole package of 10 tortillas.  This was great for dinner and would be easy to make just one for lunch.

Loved these! we love cheese, so I added more of the  Monterey Jack cheese on top of the pepperoni so the tortilla melts all the way through.  Very easy to make, and you can change and add other pizza toppings!

Loved how easy these were.  Used turkey pepperoni and sprayed a non-stick pan, no need for the extra butter to try and cut down on the fat.  Will make again and again!

Wonderful recipe. Only, mine must have tasted quie different from what is suggested. I had to tweak cause I was short of ingredients. I didn't have tortillas, used home-made rotis (roll whole wheat dough and flip on pan), spread refried beans on them and added diced bell pepper, onion, tomatoes, cilantro, pizza sauce and cheese. Spiced it with a wee bit of tobasco.Husband loved it. Thanks for an excellent idea.

Quick and easy! We really enjoyed these! We made a meal out these and used a pesto ranch dressing for dipping! I used a non stick pan and skipped the butter/spray olive oil ..I never coat my tortillas when making quesadillas.

These were yummy!  I made them on my quesadilla maker, sprayed with Pam(thus I didn't butter my tortillas)laying one tortilla down, then the filing and then another on top (rather than folding over).   I cut them with a pizza cutter.  i also added jalapenos and bellpepper, but you could add any pizza toppings that you like.

Fabulous! I added Italian Seasoning to give these a little more "zing".  I also cut them into smaller pieces as an appetizer.  These were a huge hit and now a new favorite for my teenage daughters!!!  Thanks - this is a keeper!

Delicious!!!  I used cooked chicken (marinated overnight in Italian dressing) cut up in small pieces instead of pepperoni slices. I sprayed skillet with Pam instead of margarine.  Also, I sprinkled crushed red pepper flakes at the end after I added the cheese—added spiciness.  THANK YOU FOR RECIPE!

SO simple!!!  It seriously took NO time to fix & they were so good!!  I didn't use pepperoni since I'm a vegetarian, but I put in mushrooms.  You could add just about ANY pizza ingredient to this!  Definatly a keeper :)

I cooked some italian sausage and use that instead of pepporoni. I put the filling in a tortilla and wrapped it like a burrito and browned them in a frying pan with butter. It turned out pretty good.

Because of the tortilla and way of cooking them they tasted a little off although overall were good, quick and fun for the kids to help with!

Very good.  I added olives and sauted mushroom and green peppers.  Didn't use margerine, just sprayed.  The pepperoni caused them to be a little greasy.  Maybe precook the pepperoni even though I used the hormel pre sliced pepperoni.

My family really enjoyed these. I didn't use the butter but sprayed my pan with PAM. Also didn't measure the pizza sauce and cheese. I just added the amount I thought we would like. We loved these. They could be made with any ingredients you enjoy. Will be making more often.

This is a great recipe, I am even pretty picky about what I like.  I did however change a couple things.  Pam worked good instead of margarine and it worked better to do sauce, then 1/2 the cheese, then toppings and then the rest of the cheese.  I also thought mozzarella tasted better.

These were easy and great!  Next time I'd leave off the butter as it had a tendency to burn, but other than that the kids loved them.  Something even my husband can make.  Bravo!

Simple and yummy!  Who wouldn't like these?  We didn't have jack cheese, so we made them with cheddar and a little shredded mozzarella.

The frozen ones are just as good with a lot less trouble. Dip in sour cream for a truly artery clogging experience.

I make these slightly different. I fill these and then roll them up egg roll style and deep fry them. YUMMY! You can really play with the ingredient filling of these and find something to fit your tastes.

Very tasty! Halved the recipe, used turkey pepperoni, 8 oz. of sauce and discovered that they're less greasy when cooked with non-stick spray instead of margarine. Very easy and quick. Loved them.

A nice quick and easy meal. I used turkey pepperoni, and added some onion and mushrooms. I also used mozzerella and extra-sharp Cheddar, and sprayed the skillet with butter-flavored Pam. A good and somewhat healthier alternative to pizza. Thanks!

quick, easy, nice and light.  This recipe is as easy as 1-2-3. Great and easy enough for kids to have something to do in the kitchen.  They taste great. I added italian seasoning to my tomato sauce.

This *was* fast and easy.  I just sliced some cooked sausage and put that in with the pizza sauce (from a jar) and cheese and had myself a quick lunch.  
However, I much prefer using tortillas for quesadillas so I probably will not make this again.  Personal taste preference only - it's a good recipe.

Good for a quick supper!  I didn't use margarine, just sprayed a little Pam on the pan and cooked over higher heat, less greasy that way.

I made it with whole wheat tortillas and it was okay, I’m definitely thinking flour would have been better, but I still think it was just okay and maybe a little plain.

Super easy.  Might add a little garlic salt and Italian seasoning to the butter next time to give a little more flavor to the tortilla.  Used hot Italian sausage, turkey pepperoni and shredded mozzarella.  Kids loved this.  A keeper!

These are addictive. They're so easy to make, and absolutely delicious. We used to make a grilled cheese version of this on camping trips, but this is my new go-to when I want a quick pizza substitute!

Very yummy!  I saw the headliner pick had added some pickled jalapenos to theirs and that sounded good.  I only had fresh though so I used some thinly sliced ones.  I think pickled would be better though to remind you more of a pizza.  It was really good though and quick to throw together!

This is a great recipe!  We made it tonight for a superbowl party and everyone gobbled it up!  I could see us making this as a meal as well.  Very quick and kid friendly.  We did omit the cheddar cheese and use mozzerella instead, but everything else was the same.

so wonderful. I like to do these open-faced in a very hot oven. Just personal preference so it seems more like pizza! Also, great with flavored tortillas.

These were pretty good.  Certainly not pizza, but they will do in a pinch.  My 5 year old loved them.  The rest of us just thought they were ok.  However, they are easily made, with ingredients I always have.  I always have tortillas...don't always have pizza crust...so this is a good standby for us.

I omited the margine and used a non stick griddle.  I used both cooked and uncooked flour tortillas, they both tasted good, it's your preference.  I heated up one side of the tortilla first, flip the warm side over then put sauce, cheese and pepperoni on half before folding the other half over it.  I also reduced the amount of cheese in each tortilla to about 2 tablespoons.  My children and husband loved them.  It makes a quick and easy pizza if you don't have time to wait for frozen dough to rise.  Thanks.

I fixed these awhile back when my husband and I were both starving after work, TOO hungry to wait TOO long for anything to cook.  We really liked these.  They're a great alternative to regular quesadillas and are a cinch to make.  My husband loves ranch, so of course dipped his in ranch, while I dipped mine in a little extra pizza sauce.  Thanks for the great recipe.

These were delicious! I'm a new college student, and these were very simple and quick to make,  I was able to throw in some vegetables, and the leftovers tasted great a couple days later. My room-mates and bf also enjoyed them. They're easier than KD and taste way better.

I made these for the kids one night and something different for hubby and me because these sounded too "kid-ish." Well, after I tasted it, I wished I had made some for me! This is a really good combination that turns out well quesadilla style! And for those watching carbs, might be a good way to have pizza.

Good and versatile--you can play around with what you add, such as broccoli or zucchini and squash.  Surprisingly, they're not too bad as leftovers.  A reliable recipe to keep for a slight change of pace.

This was a great and VERY EASY recipe.  I made with different varieties of cheeses.  Also, once I folded over the tortilla, I put cheese where it met the bottom layer of the bread.  And it was not messy.  One more thing, I added peppers and tomatoes to the inside!
