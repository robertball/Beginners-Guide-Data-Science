This was okay but it needs more. I used this as 1 of the 2 dipping sauces for egg and spring rolls and it really lacked in flavor. Sorry. I think some sesame oil, Sriracha, and rice vinegar would bump this up a lot regardless of what you are using it for.

Used stevie instead of sugar, one packet, tasted great. Will definitely make again. Very easy to make.
