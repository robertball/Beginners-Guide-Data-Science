My grandma has been making this for as long as I can remember! It brings back memories. The one thing I suggest is using those colored mashmallows. They are flavored, are a perfect addition, and the only way I would make this.

My mum used to maek something very similar to this, minus the rice.  I would add shredded coconut.  Do not make this more than a few hours before eating.  It does not store well, infact goes quite dry.  Great with ice-cream.  Sliced bananas and mango peices mixed help togive this an extra boost.

I doubled this recipe for a neighborhood block party. It was not "yummy". It turned out to be too dry, thick, and not sweet enough.  The recipe did not make it clear whether to drain the pineapple or include the juices. I would like to try this recipe again, but need input from others. Thanks.

This was way too sweet for my taste.  It was all fluff and little nutrition.  Without the marshmallows, it might be good; but I won't be saving this recipe.

I used my family recipe I learned from my mother. I cook the rice and stir it with a fork to make the rice fluffier. I then add 1/2 the bag of marshmallows and stir it in with the rice. Add 2  cans of chunk or crushed pineapple drained.  (I recently got crushed pineapple by mistake, but usually chunk is better). Then take a container of whipped topping 8oz. Fold it into the combined cooked rice, marshmallow, and pineapple mixture. Chill for awhile. When cooled, add the remaining marshmallows and the 2nd container of whipped topping and fold into the cooled rice mixture. Garnish with maraschino cherries. Serve cold.

This is a Minnesota dessert staple, not to confused with it's Southern counterpart Ambrosia, which uses coconut, walnuts and no rice.

This was great!  My boyfriend asked me to make it and said it was just like what his mother used to make... and he proposed a couple of days later!  Definitely whip the heavy cream... much better than cool whip... only takes a minute and is so worth it.

My mother made this for years as we were growing up but she substituted fruit cocktail for the pineapple. Yesterday would have been her 87th birthday...To continue her legacy I still make it and have just explained the family significance of this dish to her great grandchildren that I've adopted. Like my mother I also make it with homemade whipped cream. This dish is like heaven in a bowl!
When making it, drain the fruit well but be sure to not skimp on the whipped cream since the rice and marshmallows will soak up the moisture!

This was a favorite of my father's to make for the holidays.  He always added the hot over the marshmallows so they would melt a bit.  Very tasty that way.

I used heavy cool whip because I didn't feel like whipping real cream and it turned out well, I also add more rice because 1 cup just doesn't seem enough to the amount of crushed pineapple. So I used 2 cans crushed pineapple, about 2.5 cups rice and the entire (small) container of cool whip. It turned out really well. I bet it would be good with coconut in it too. It is a really good, cool and refreshing treat!

good basic recipe, my mom used to make this, but she added lemon jello, fruit cocktail, and used the colored mini marshmellows and sprinkle pecans on top.
