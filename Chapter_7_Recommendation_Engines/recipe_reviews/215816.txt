Very tasty recipe! It was super easy to make. The only change I made was using ricotta instead of cottage cheese.

Very nice recipe! This is the first time I have made homemade lasagna and it turned out great! The only changes I made were adding chopped onions and diced black olives to the cheese mixture, and I used garlic salt instead of table salt. This recipe is definately a hit at our house! 
Thank you!

My family had second helpings! Be aware that you will need 1-1/2 jar Classico; that you center the noodles & everything else in the dish (3 noodles do not take up all the space); and you can layer 1/2 c (vs 1/4) sauce after cheese mix and not run out. The flavor and consistency were wonderful even with the cottage cheese (vs ricotta), no boil noodles and the water around the edge, which I was worried about. It came out delish. Hope that helps someone.

I used half the meat called for and added in chopped vegetables; zucchini, onion, garlic, peppers, mushrooms and a can of organic diced tomatoes, that I rinsed and drained. (I've really got to stretch my meat budget so filling in with vegetables bumps up the flavor and is a nice filler.) I actually used an organic sauce (Italian Herb) and I cooked my noodles ahead of time because I did not have the no-boil noodles on hand. The water was not needed. This was quick and simple, which I really appreciated, plus my dinner guests loved it. Quite adaptable to any budget and stretches really well to feed an army.

This was a very good simple lasagna. Prep time was a little more than 15 min. Sent my hubby to the store for the ingredients. I forgot to put Parmesan cheese on the list, but was still very good. We like Prego sauce so used the traditional flavor of that. I'm sure you can use whatever is your favorite. I was a little uncertain about putting the water in the pan, and was afraid it would be too runny. When I took it out, it was very soupy, but as it cooled some it thickened up. There's just two of us so the 9x13 pan was plenty. The leftovers will be really good!

I can't cook to save my life, but my boyfriend and I joined culinary forces to put this recipe together, and we did well!  I used ricotta cheese instead, but that was the only change we made.  We will use this recipe again and again!  Too easy!

Super easy to make and my family loves it.  I have made this recipe twice now, no adjustments needed. Takes me about 25 mins of prep time though.

This was a great recipe for a lazy person who has never made Lasagne.  My daughter (7) had a fabulous time making it.  I did add Italian Seasoning mix instead of parsley....liked the flavor a little better.  Also, I used a random sauce not the same one.  It turned out perfect!

Great lasagna.. only thing I didn't do was add the water to the edges of the pan- not sure why you would want to do that? Make sure your top layer of noodles is completely covered with sauce and cheese so it doesn't get crunchy.

Excellent recipe!  The whole family loves it.  They say it's the best they've ever had and made me promise not to buy another frozen lasagna; and since it is so easy to throw together, that's definitely doable.

This was a great recipe. I also used ricotta cheese instead of cottage, and I actually only used 16oz of ricotta instead of 32oz -- it still turned out great!

Made 3 pans of this for a large crowd. Usedbarilla no boil oven ready noodles. I agree that more sauce was needed. I used 2 lbs of lean beef and 2 lbs of spicy italian sausage. Definitely could of used far less meat and more sauce. But had a nice kick. I personally prefer the traditional noodles to the thin no boil I used. They were just too delicate and a bit too mushy. I added the water to the edges of the pan even though I also used extra sauce. Got compliments on it though and most of the three pans were gone in 10 minutes. also I made and baked these the night before and hubby warmed them in the oven before the event. Used Classico sauce variety of flavors together.

This was my first ever homemade lasagne receipe - easy & delicious! Biggest lesson learned: do not cheap on the sauce! Much easier to buy the specified Classico, then make your own. Freezes well for future dinners too.

delicious! my husband loved it. I used the Kraft 4 cheese italino shredded cheese instead of just mozzarella; reduced to only 1/4 cup of water since somehow I had only 2 layers of noodles (not sure how that happened but it was still fantastic). nice and cheesy - thanks !

This has become my go to lasagna recipe. It's fairly simple and my whole family loves it. Whenever I make it, I double or triple the recipe and freeze the extra batches. It freezes beautifully and in a few weeks I'm sure to have a busy evening and everyone will be eager to have it again.

Wow! This is one of the best lasagnas I have ever had. I wasn't sure about using cottage cheese for lasagna, but I am so glad that I trusted the recipe, as the cottage cheese actually tasted delicious in the lasagna.

Best recipe ever! I am a terrible/inexperienced cook, yet this lasagna still turned out great! Very simple and very tasty!
