I was looking for a Bacardi Rum Cake just like my mom used to make back in the '70s.  This seems to be the one; very delicious and just like I rembered!  I love the butter rum flavor of this cake.  I used Bacardi Select instead of Bacardi Gold for a richer rum flavor.  My mother used to use Bacardi Amber Label, but it doesn't seem to be in production anymore.  Bacardi Select made the cake taste exactly like the one I remembered so fondly from years ago.
