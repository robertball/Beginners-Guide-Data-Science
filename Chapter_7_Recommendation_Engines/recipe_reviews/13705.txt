Put this over cream cheese, to be spread over crackers, and it is absolutely WONDERFUL!  Everyone that I have served it to has asked for the recipe.  It takes awhile to make, but isn't hard.  Its great to have on hand for unexpected guest.

This is a fantastic recipe!  We have a pear tree and this is a tasty way to use them up.  I add dried cherries to the fruit mix and 1 cup of brandy just prior to processing.

Wonderful way to use pears from our trees. Mixed with a chopped apple and baked in a pie. Best ever mincemeat pie.

This is a excellent recipe that I have made six times mostly with all apple and I have held off reviewing since I altered it.  This was the first time I made it exact to recipe as recommended including pears and it was great both ways.  I weighed the fruit and found that diced and added together with dried fruits it was a level 8 quarts so I just use an 8 quart bowl for measuring fruits.  I usually get 6 quarts after cooking so I think the pints yield (12 cups) might be wrong. Northern spies worked the best, the 20 ouncer apples I just used were not as dense and released a lot of air in the sealing/cooling stage after processing.  Curious if others have the same higher yield.
