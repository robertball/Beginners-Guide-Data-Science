Excellent! Reaffirms my love of both avocado and black beans. The only change was swapped chili sauce for chili oil as I don't have chili oil. It seemed too wet and was a little mushy the next day, as is the nature of avocado, but I used a slotted spoon to serve and the flavors were still great!

To be honest I really didn't care for this recipe. I made it like the recipe reads except I used a yellow pepper because that's what looked good at the market. It could be my taste buds but if I ever made this again I would eliminate the sesame seed oil all together. In my opinion that's what ruined it for me.

Pretty good.  I wasn't sure what sweet red pepper was, so I used a red bell pepper.  I was nervous about it because I don't really like raw peppers, but it worked so well with the combination that I even ended up adding extra!  I left out the hot chile oil because I didn't have any, but I added cayenne pepper instead to taste to give it a kick.

Delicious!  I had everything on hand except hot chile oil so I used chili garlic sauce instead.  Also added one extra tblsp of sesame oil, 1/4 head of red cabbage, 2 cloves of garlic and sesame seeds.  I'm sure it will be a hit tonight.  Thank you!

This is one of the tastiest black bean salads I've made - a nice subtle flavor change from the usual.  I'd recommend using lime juice instead of lemon.

Great taste but I found the avocado didn't provide much in the way of flavour although gave a texture contrast.  Definitely let this sit to marinate a bit, let everything meld together.  There was something about the sauce that was a bit too intense if you eat more than a small serving, maybe the vinegar???

LOVE THIS SALAD. I have added tomatoes and corn to this salad. I don't have any hot chili oil so I dont use that. Also to make it even healthier, I use Braggs Amino Acids in place of soy sauce....no salt in it. I think I need to make this again tomorrow.

Fantastic!! Very flavorful with just the right combination of spices - your taste buds will be wowed with every bit . My 4yr old daughter can't get enough! Even though we're not big bean eaters, mostly because of their flavor, I have been looking for ways to incorporate more into our diet. This one is definitely staying on the menu.

I really liked this.  The only complaint I have is that, despite the asian dressing ingredients, it had a mexican flavor.  I served this with an asian inspired meal and it did not compliment the other dishes at all.  I did use cilantro where it states cilantro or parsley, and I didn't use the chile oil (I have two toddlers) which may have changed my feelings toward it.  That being said, it is VERY tasty!
