Wow, and I always thought of chicken breasts as flavorless.  The bacon and guac made them out of this world.  These sandwiches made our bbq seem like a special occasion.  I also grilled some onions along with the chicken and piled those on top too.

The Pig Burger: Because you will feel like a pig after you eat it. :o Seriously, this turned into a MAMMOTH burger for me. But talk about delicious. Omg. I wasn't too sure about the herb-y mayo and the guacamole, but do it. I made Nana's Fabulous Faccacia Bread to go with this, and it was for lack of a better word - fabulous!

This was delicious, messy, but very delicious! I made my own guacamole and herb mayo (lite mayo w/ some oregano, basil, and a bit of dill.) I cut the bacon in half for small slices instead of crumbled and also used big onion poppyseed rolls. If you don't mind making a bit of mess while eating, the combination of flavors here is very good!

Fabulous! This "burger" was definitely a nice twist on a "BLT" and took it up a notch or two, espcially with the addition of the creamy guacamole and herb mayo.  This was oh so good and perfect for a quick and easy weeknight meal. I seasoned my chicken breast with "Cajun Spice Mix", made my own herb mayo using Hellman's light mayo and mix of my own favorite herbs (just get creative and do what tastes good to you). I also used "Simply Guacamole" from this site. I can see how one can make a "Pig" of themselves because these are so good you'd be tempted to eat more than one!

There's no mention of how to make or where to purchase "herb mayo" so what did everyone use for this item ?

Great combo!!  Yum!  My husband couldn't stop with the compliments.

Make sure you don't use chicken thats too thick, I could hardly get my mouth around this with the focaccia being so thick.

This is, without any doubt, one of the best recipes I have ever tried.  I have made this, repeatedly by request, for family and friends. A typical comment is "this taste like a sandwhich you would enjoy in a fine gourmet resteraunt"; no kidding!

My advice is to serve the sandwhich sliced in to two servings and be prepared with the napkins. It is juicy and a challenge to keep together but, oh so well worth the effort. I substituted a spicy guacamole dip in lieu of making my fresh spicy version one time with success.

Give this recipe a try, you won't be disappointed!

Almost forgot, try this recipe using Garlic/Sun Dried Tomato Focaccia Bread; GREAT FLAVOR!

Man this was a BIG BURGER!  It was almost inedible, we had to keep squishing ours down!  But it was soooo good!  I made an herb mayo as following: 1/4 C. mayo, 1 tsp. buffalo sauce, 1/2 tsp each: dried basil leaves, italian seasoning and parsley.  It was perfect!  I used an italian cheese/herb focaccia.  I think it's better if you lightly toast the bread first because focaccia has a very chewy texture that doesn't make good sandwiches in my opinion.  Instead of making guacamole, I just mashed an avacado and used that.  This was really delicious, I will be making it again, but probably flattening the chicken breast before I cook it.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Made this "Australian" sandwich at a bon voyage party for my parents who are leaving on a 35 trip to ANZAC.  I marinated the chicken in Lawry's Lemon Pepper marinade.  I made herb mayonnaise with mayo, fresh thyme & basil, lemon juice & zest.  Got very good quality rolls and served with guac, mayo, bacon (split in half, not crumbled), lettuce & tomato.  We liked it heaps!

PRETTY GOOD, BUT I CHANGED IT A LITTLE BIT...I USED REGULAR BUNS AND MADE UP MY OWN HERB MAYO WITH HERBS THAT I LIKE. I ALSO JUST LAID THE BACON ON TOP OF THE CHICKEN AND MELTED SOME CHEDDAR CHEESE ON TOP OF IT ALL...VERY YUMMY..I WILL MAKE THIS ONE AGAIN.

We LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe.  My 9 year old son and I make it once or twice a month and he gets excited every time we do.  We usually substitute a whole wheat kaiser bun for the focaccia to save on cost.  As a dad, it's nice to have a hearty recipe that I feel good about serving.  Really easy to make, too.

Great recipe, used regular buns as I didn't have focaccia, and used the bacon sliced instead of crumbled. Had some avocado I needed to use up so this was fabulous. Thanks!

Superb recipe! Only negative I can think of is the name of this sandwich. Didn't crumble the bacon and made my guacamole spicy so the grilled chicken was just that, grilled chicken. I didn't add salt or pepper. This is messy! And so yum yum! Husband loved this and said it tasted like something out of a "really good deli". Not sure what that means but I know he loved this sandwich. Next time, I will have some things already to go -- I had to make the foccacia from scratch, make the guacamole from scratch and grilled the chicken.

Just made this for dinner tonight.  Follow the directions and it's just tasty.  Took another reviewer's suggestion for herb mayo, but added mild tabasco instead of buffalo sauce.  Messy.  Yummy.

I liked this a lot, but I didn't have guacamole or all the ingredients to make it, so I just used sliced avocado and it was great.  Can't wait to do it with guacamole...

Messy but good. I made my own guac, and added some regular Italian seasoning to some lite mayo - I wish I hadn't actually, it would have been better plain. I kept the bacon whole (only needed 2 slices as it was pretty thick) and I did the chicken on the Foreman grill. Very tasty. Thanks, Geoff!

We LOVED this! The only change I would make next time (we all agreed) would be to use a different kind of bread, as this was not sturdy enough to hold all the goodness, and was sort of dry and fell a part, but that could've been this particular focaccia. This is a keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

DELICIOUS!! Clearly not a calorie conscious meal but when it’s this good who cares! I used extra thin chicken breasts and seasoned them with pepper and Cajun seasoning then fried em up in the bacon grease. Buttered and broiled the focaccia and used Kraft garlic aioli I found in the mayo aisle.

I'm giving this 5 stars for the idea of this recipe, however the true rating would be based upon many  different factors. The sandwich will be as good as your guac, grilled chicken and herbed mayo. I made my own for all of the above.

Awesome! Made as instructed. Huge hit with the family and I don't usually rate recipes.
