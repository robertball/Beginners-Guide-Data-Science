This came out incredible! I can't believe how tasty this is. Went without blackening seasoning... since we didn't have any but is still great. Put it on top of some lettuce and totally set!

I have made this recipe twice now. The first time I followed the recipe and the result was good. For the second time, I used three shallots for the onions and added two strips of bacon. During the final phase I covered the dish and it allowed the bell peppers to cook down a little. This made this good recipe even more nuanced.

Didn't use the blackened seasoning. Served over a bed of greens. Very good!

Followed the recipe with our venison and it was actually really good. I didn't/wouldn't change a thing.

This was delicious and very easy to make! We used ground bison because that's what Kroger had, but I'm sure any lean ground meat would be great. We mostly kept the same spices, subbing a Creole seasoning and a little of Emeril's seasoning  and some pepper for the Blackened seasoning. We served it over mixed greens as well. As written, the recipe makes a good amount, 2 dinners and 3 lunch portions.
