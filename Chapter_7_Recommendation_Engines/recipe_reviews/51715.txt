Wow - nice twist on regular 'ol hard shell tacos! This is kinda like traditional Mexican meets old school Italian. Like others, I was a bit skeptical but overall it's really good. It tastes like a meatball hoagie fused with a hard shell taco. So, if you like both of those you're bound to like this. My husband is a fan of both, so he really enjoyed this. Plus, it was quick and easy to put together for a weeknight meal. I seasoned the ground beef and sausage with a little minced garlic as well as Italian seasoning. I omitted with sugar from the jarred sauce as I used "Classico's Sweet Tomato Basil Sauce". I topped the "tacos" with a combination of mozzarella and parmesan cheeses. Overall, simply delicious!

This was really good and super easy, but it would have been better on bread than in a taco shell. If I make it in the shell again, I will add some roasted red peppers and ricotta cheese to make it more taco like and less like a meatball sandwich.

For a quick and easy meal, this was a five star recipe.  I loved the crunchy taco shell mixed with the Italian flavors.  I wasn't sure how this was going to be, but I was pleasantly surprised.

I WAS A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL OF THIS RECIPE BUT IM GLAD I TRIED IT. IT WAS YUMMY. I USED TURKEY SAUSAGE AND GROUND SIRLOIN TO MAKE IT LOWER IN FAT. I DIDNT HAVE MOZERELLA CHEESE SO I USED FAT FREE CHEDDAR AND IT WORKED OUT FINE. THIS ONE IS A KEEPER.

Although I doubled the entire recipe (big eaters/teenagers at my house)  I followed it exactly.  It was AWESOME!  It is now the new official taco of our house!  I did add ricotta cheese to the bottom of the taco but that's just because we are huge ricotta cheese lovers! A must try!

Of course like other posts... surprisingly good! They were very easy. I added some diced onion and green pepper for a little color and flavor.

Tasted yummy. We used hard taco shells and it was very messy. Next time we will use soft taco shells.

i thought these were great so flavorful i added some italian seaosnings to give the hamburger a bit of flavor... word of caution... my boyfriend prefers soft taco shells. NEVER USE SOFT TACO SHELLS trying to appease him they just turned out bad. the soft taco shell ruined it.

These tacos were out of this world. They are a quick and easy dish that combines the crunchiness of a taco shell and the italian zip of spaghetti sauce. I am telling everyone I know about this recipe. Good Job and I hope to see more like this.

I had to make these with the ingredients I had on hand. I used ALL chicken italian sausage instead of ground beef. I also omitted the sugar in the sauce cuz it is sweet enough. I tossed some minced garlic and italian seasoning in while browning the meat. I sauteed a sliced onion and red peppers to serve over the "tacos". Served with slices of mozzarella and provolone. Simple and budget meal that I think would please kids. Thanks for sharing Super Dave!

I wasn't crazy about this recipe.  I thought it was lacking "traditional taco" toppings like onions, tomatoes, lettuce.  The meat seemed dry too, could simmer in 1/2 cup water.

Like many of the other people who reviewed this recipe I was skeptical, but this was really good.  I have a 2, 3, and 6 year old and they ate them up and my 6 year old said she liked them better than the traditional tacos.  My hubby had to work late and hasn't ate them but if he likes them I will definetely make them again.  I did change things a little bit.  I did not have italian sausage so I just used ground turkey.  I added diced tomatoes and the sauce directly to the meat and left the sugar out.  The only taco shells I had on hand were salsa flavored so that is what I used.

This was a nice twist on tacos. I did use sweet Italian sausage, which I don't think worked very well for this recipe. I also made refried white beans to put on the tacos. Drain a can of white beans, heat over medium heat in a skillet, season with salt, pepper, garlic powder and Italian seasoning, and mash. Hubby had a hard time accepting this recipe, so I'm not sure if I'll make it again, but it was good.

This one is definitely a keeper; my family of four (which includes a 10-year old, and a VERY PICKY 6-year old) all raved over it. And it's incredibly quick and easy to make. My 6-year old doesn't care for tacos at all, so my wife fixed a little side for her, thinking she would have nothing to do with these. However, the little one ate three of them (with the shells, no less!) and wanted more! My wife and I added crushed red pepper and a spoonful of pinto beans to our tacos, and the added flavor and texture was a big plus. Changing the basic sauce to one of these "flavored" sauces would add an interesting twist, also. But this recipe is a winner just like it stands.

Loved this recipe. Was looking for an Mexi-Italian dish for my sons birthday.  Found this and was suprised at how much we enjoyed it.  I did garnish with cottage cheese, however ricotta and mushrooms would be great too.  Will be making this again.

This recipe is just too cute for words! It's kind of like a mexican calzone without all of the work. Kids of all ages will love this. I eliminated the sugar and heated up the shells to make them warm and crispy. Pretty cool Super Dave!!!!

great, easy recipe! thought it would be a bit weird at first eating a taco shell with italian type food inside, but it was really a nice contrast. the recipe didn't say what to do with the italian sausage so i took off the casing and browned it with the rest of the meat. i also used ground turkey and turkey italian sausage and it was just the same. omitted the extra sugar for the sauce and thought it was perfect.

Not bad, but I will stick with the old fashion tacos.---The second time I made them I decided that adding the Italian seasoning at the end is over powering, and I still don't agree with adding sugar to pasta sauce.  Wish there was some way to bookmark recipes that you give three or less stars to.  Although this recipe sounds good, after two tries I realize that it just doesn't work for me

Sorry, I just didn't like this one at all. Maybe it was because the family, when they saw it being cooked (even after I told them repeatedly it wasn't) expected traditional taco's. The only thing I added was that I ended up mixing the meat and the sauce together in one sauce pan because the meat was so dry, after a few tacos we thought it needed to be stuck together with the sauce. Anyways, I give this a two because we ate them, but will not be making this one again. Just didn't do it for this Italian-loving family. Sorry!

These were great - a nice change to tacos!  I made them with ground turkey, and since I couldn't find ground sausage, I used the regular links and sliced them.  Very easy to prepare.  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  It was VERY easy.  It let us filling satisfied with something a little different.  I will probably make this again, but not on a regular basis.

This is a very nice change of pace dinner.  I made extra meat mixture to freeze and use in other recipies, like pasta sauce and lasagna.

An easy & fun recipe!  I used a full pound of hot Italian sausage, and also sprinkled in some red pepper flakes into the meat mixture.  Thanks Super Dave for getting us out of the dinner time rut!

I thought this was a interesting change from the norm as I like Italian food (Northern that is) but still prefer the real deal when I spend a month in San Miguel de Allende. The recipe didn't include the sauteed peppers, onion and fresh tomato as shown in the photo and a touch of lime juice made it better. I make my own tortilla's and prefer to fill less and eat more!

Easy to make, but won't make as is again. I think you really need to add mushrooms, ricotta cheese or something. Also I'd add the sauce to the meat mixture so it isn't so runny. I'm going to try this with large pasta shells and as a sub/hoagie I think.

I'm not a big cook, but wanted something easy and different, so I decided to try this recipe.  I used ground turkey with the sweet Italian sausage and after reading other reviews, did not add the sugar to the traditional pasta sauce which was sweet enough.  I did add green peppers at the end of cooking the meat.  My husband liked the crispiness and flavor.  I forgot to get the hard shells, so we used whole wheat soft shells and I also put ricotta cheese out to spread on the shells like we would put sour cream if making Mexican fajitas.  Overall, this was a big hit!  We all liked it better than we had expected!  I was worried because one reviewer said not to use the soft shells, but we wrapped them like a fajita and we really enjoyed them, so I'll plain to make this again!

This receipe was great and a nice change from regular tacos.  Still trying to think of some additional spices to zest it up a little more.
