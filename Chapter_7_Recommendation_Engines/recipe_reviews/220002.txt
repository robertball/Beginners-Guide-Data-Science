Hi, I'm Jillian the submitter of this recipe.  I would like to correct a couple of things with this recipe: 1) Using a paring knife, remove the core of the cabbage then boil it (the leaves will come off easier that way) 2) In the list of ingredients after 1 (28 ounce) can tomato sauce it should read 12 oz. reserved cabbage water 3) Once you're done with step 9, then you take any leftover leaves, cut them up or (shred) and place into the bottom of a roasting pan and layer the stuffed cabbage rolls over top. I use large eggs and 90/10 lean ground beef when preparing these and sometimes sub fresh minced garlic for the garlic powder. (Also, 2/3 Tbsp. is 2 tsp. for the sugar) I've been making Halupki (stuffed cabbage) for years and my 98 year old Grandma has probably made thousands of these! She taught me how to make them and that's a memory I'll always treasure. We had such fun that day... Be sure to serve with mashed potatoes or sour cream and chive mashed potatoes for a twist. I hope you and your family enjoy these as much as everyone in my family does! UPDATE - It is with great sadness that I announce the passing of my Grandma Jean at the age of 104. June 26, 1914 - November 23, 2018. Love and miss you!!!!

I made this when it was a personal recipe.... Delicious! Delicious! Delicious! Just the right amounts of everything - I followed the recipe with the exception of using fresh garlic not powdered. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for a great recipe Jillian! **update** I used some I had frozen - they were perfect! Freeze very well! ***I would like to add that this was one of my mom favorite things to eat when she was living with me.  I had to puree it for her as she eventually developed swallowing issues.  She always ate this for me and she turned away MANY other things I might offer her.  Thanks Jillian for the recipe and for making my mom happy. :)

Thank you Jillian for sharing your Grandmother's recipe!!! It is absolutely WONDERFUL. I made it exactly as you have it (including the additional info you have in the review section). It takes some time to make but so worth every minute (granmom's recipes are always the best). It was a hit with the family and it makes so much (we will have no problem eating this again tomorrow. I highly recommend this recipe!!!

This recipe was okay but probably the least flavorful I've ever had. Having grown up in a diverse family (Russian, Polish, Hungarian and German family members), I've had a LOT of "Galumpies" as I called them. Our Russian family added shredded carrot and sauerkraut to the meat mixture, along with onion and rice. This had crushed tomatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, brown sugar and a little lemon or vinegar. The German recipe was similar, only no sauerkraut and shredded carrot. The Polish family had a sweet/sour tomato sauce made by adding raisins (not a big fan). Our Hungarian family used paprika (1 tbs or so) along with sauteed onion to the meat, again no egg. They were placed on a bed of sauerkraut with Hungarian smoked sausage chunks or kielbasa tucked around. I tend to make the Hungarian version, without the smoked sausage but with a can of crushed tomatoes seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, brown sugar, vinegar and paprika. I put the unused cabbage, chopped, around the rolls (seated on Bavarian-style sauerkraut) before I pour on the tomato sauce and bake.

One of my grandmothers was Hungarian and she taught me how to make these. It is pretty much the same way except I use all lean beef and no pork. I also add canned tomatoes to the meat mixture since I have plenty I can myself. I add the rice raw and it cooks with the rest of it. Also, a tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce added to the meat gives it more flavo. I also use brown sugar instead of white in making the sauce. BE SURE YOU ONLY WILT THE LEAVES AND NOT COOK THEM COMPLETELY. Once they begin to look translucent (change color) they are ready to be taken off of the core. 

This is one of my family's favorite recipes!

I'm of German decent and this sure looks like what I've made (and of course my mother/grandmother) except we've always used our own canned stewed tomatoes along with sauerkraut. The tomatoes cut the sourness of the kraut so the kids would eat it. But the sweet/sour caught my eye and I think it's a nice change. I've only given this four stars so far as your recipe is in the oven right now. I'll edit this after I'd tasted but it sounds yummy. Oh and I did put all on a bed of sauerkraut...it's a rule! lol lol
ok...next day. I'm now giving it 5 stars1 Only thing I'd change is adding some tomato sauce to the meat/rice mixture. YUM.

Jillian, thanks for the recipe.  I'm planning to make this evening (1/16/15).  I know it will be as good as I remember as its the same recipe my Mother used to make.  Imagine my surprise when I looked at your profile to learn you live in Allentown, PA (I was born and raised in Catasauqua, I now live in Georgia).  My mouth is watering just thinking of dinner.  YUM!

I modified this recipe as follows:
I do not use eggs for stuffing, because rice is holding the meat together. I add grated onion, rice half way cooked, salt and pepper to the ground beef and turkey.
I sateed the stuffed cabages in olive oil on the skillet before putting them in a pot. At the bottom of the pot I place remaining cabbage leaves, then I add choped onions, babby carrots, a few bay leaves and blac pepper corns. Then I placed all stuffed cabages in a pot. To make sauce I use tomato juice,tomato paste, a dash of salt, black pepper,1 Tbs honey and very small amount of water. Mix it all up and taste the sauce. It should be sweet and sour. Pour sauce over the stuffed cabbages. Cook on the stove for almost 1 hr and then bake it in the oven at 375F for another 45 min covered. When cabbage is soft bake uncovered for anothe 15 min. Seve it with side of sourcream. It is a lot of work, but it freezes well and I make a big pot for left overs.

I added a 28 ounce can of diced tomatoes to the recipe.  I also cooked mine on top of the stove simmering for 3.5 hrs.  My mom passed away 16 yrs ago and finally a recipe that tastes just like hers.   Love it Thanks so much for sharing Jillian.

This is by far the most delicious Stuffed Cabbage I've ever eaten.  I made them pretty much exactly as the recipe was written and it was so, so good. I had extra large cabbage leaves and I was a little worried about that, but I filled them pretty full and I made 12 - 5" rolls that were about 2.5" in diameter. We each ate one, which was plenty. I'm happy to have the leftovers!!!!

This recipe took a while to make but it was well worth the wait.  My son is usually the slowest eater but he finished first and asked for seconds! He was so happy to find out there were leftovers for dinner tomorrow. 

Note: My husband doesn't eat meat so I made a second pan with grilled tofu crumbles. I kept everything else the same in the recipe and the vegetarian version was a hit as well.

This is a great recipe.  One secret ingredient was added which I think takes it to a new level, if that is possible.  I added about half a teaspoon of Cinammon to the meat mixture.  There is something about the cinammon which enhances all the flavors.  You don't really taste "cinammon" you just taste a robust comfort food. 
For Sauce I used what I had on hand.  1- 20 oz can tomato puree, 1 -14 oz can diced tomatoes, 1 can Campbells tomato soup, about 1/4 c red wine vinegar..    I mixed the sauce in a bowl and spooned a little of it into the  meat mixture.  Then I poured the rest on top of the assembled cabbage rolls.  Oh so delicious!  
I did run out of cabbage leaves before I ran out of meat, so I just formed some meatballs with it and cooked in right in the pan with the cabbage rolls.       So love having this recipe to remind us of our Lithuanian grandmother who was an amazing cook and I never saw her measure anything!

OMG!  AMAZING!  Thank you so much for sharing such an amazing family recipe.  The only thing I did different was freeze the head of cabbage instead of boiling it and just used regular water for the sauce.  (I didn't read any other reviews, so I'm not sure if the freezer trick was mentioned.)  Definitely making this one again and again and AGAIN!

Changes I made: I arraged 2-3 sliced apples and a handful of grapes around the Golumpki beforpouring in the sauce. I grew up with a Polish caregiver and this is how she made her cabbage rolls. I am aware the recipe is Russian however I chose it because the ingredients were traditional. DELICIOUS! I impressed my family and myself. this is a staple in my home from now on.

I made a half recipe and a 2 lb (little less than 1 kilo) cabbage barely provided enough leaves. If you are going to make the whole recipe, use a BIG cabbage.  I used twice as much cabbage water as needed by accident(forgot instructions didn't adjust) with the tomato sauce so it was runny but still a decent flavour, could possibly use a bit of herb or spice in it also next time. I may add basil or oregano, but it wouldn't be needed, I'd say. I also recommend doubling the rice amount. When prepared this way the meat held together well and secure. I thought the filling was bland and could really use a lot more salt, pepper and garlic powder. The parsley really didn't add much to the flavour either, I think next time I will use dill instead or in addition to parsley.

This came out really good.  However, I did add a little brown sugar instead of white.  I did not need to cook this dish as long as the directions recommended with the recipe, and I only had brown rice on hand which worked out fine.  I will certainly make it again :)

My husband's post on Facebook says it all:"Growing up with Polish and Lithuanian relatives, and eating at Hungarian restaurants in New Brunswick and Trenton, I've had plenty of authentic stuffed cabbage. But the best ever was last night's dinner, made by my wife on her first attempt using an online recipe. Embarrassed to reveal how many I ate!" I substituted parsley with celery leaves, just because I did not have parsley at the time.

DELICIOUS!! I cut back the sugar by a tablespoon because I didn't want it overly sweet but other than that I followed it to a T and my family totally loves it. It has been added to our meal lineup! :)

Great recipe!  Very similar to my Russian family recipe.  We use a large can of tomato soup. Personally I prefer all ground beef and add mushrooms for flavor.  A side note: Polish use beef broth and Russians use tomato based sauce.

found meat to be a little dry and bland. second batch i added a bit of paprika and onion powder to coat the raw meat. also used campbells' condensed tomato soup. be careful how much cabbage water you mix with the tomato soup, if it gets too watery then you're basically boiling your stuffed cabbage in the oven, which will overcook the meat.  i found the consistency of the tomato soup should be a little runnier than ketchup consistency.

With the exception of adding 1/2 teaspoon of onion powder, I follow this recipe exactly. The flavors and texture are a great combination and the beef/ground pork combo are a must for good authentic taste. Served with mashed potatoes it is definitely a dinner all star.

What a great recipe! The stuffed cabbage and sauce both have a lot of flavor and this is definitely my go-to recipe from now on. I followed the recipe as is, but I double the sauce. These freeze great also!

This dish turned out wonderful.  Neither my husband or I have Russian or Ukrainian background, But we have close friends who are Ukrainian.  We were introduced to this dish at their home.  I decided to take on the challenge of making this dish myself.  How pleasantly surprised we both were. It came out wonderful.  I made just a couple of changes.  I used fresh garlic instead of powered. Substituted half the white sugar with brown. I also added about a teaspoon of vegeta  (a Croatian seasoning, you can find at many Eastern European markets) to the meat filling.  Once it was cooked I served it with sour cream. Absolutely wonderful and delicious.  The only change I wold make in the future is making less filling.  We were left with a little less than half of the filling and not enough cabbage.  I fixed that problem and made the remainder of the filling into a meat loaf.

This is almost the very same my Irish/German mom made and now I do, with a little bit of changes. We add Worcestershire sauce to the meat and we simmer on stovetop in a tall pot instead of over. Always love the comfort food!

I love these!  I add a 28 oz can of diced tomatoes just to make sauce with chunks.  I also use tomato sauce, have two 15 cans on hand, use one other incase the cabbage soaks up the juice.  I like to serve juice on mashed potatoes.  Very good!

Most excellent! It's helpful to use the tomato sauce in the Polish section of your grocer. The second time I made it, I used some Worcestershire in the meat with soy sauce in place of the salt for added flavor.

I made this for dinner last night -- still trying to replicate my late mother-in-laws recipe.  It turned out wonderful and my husband says it's a keeper!  The only change I made was to substitute couscous for the rice (that's what I had in the house). This is definitely a dish I'll add to my favorites list.

Dare I say that this was better than my buscha's. :O 
I used San Marzano tomatoes, but did everything else as is. Maybe I added a little bit more salt, too.  Thank you for this recipe. My Buscha died 8 years ago, and I never got the recipe. My Polish grandma would be proud of me tonight feeding my kids this (and they devoured it!).

I made this today.  The ratio of meat to rice was spot on.  I doubled the amount of salt pepper and spices because of a few reviews stating blandness.  Didn’t have tomato sauce so I used Tomato soup  (it's what I had on hand ) and omitted the sugar.  This was the best stuffed cabbage I have ever made!  Could never get my stuffed cabbage to taste authentic.   
The beef and pork mixture really make these rolls so tender and the rice was just enough to hold them together.
So happy for such a success!  Thank you!!!

I would suggest that you tell the cook to core the cabbage before you boil it.  That makes it much easier to peel the leaves off the cabbage in boiling water.

I highly recommend you watch a YouTube video on how to roll these! I did one head of cabbage. Rolled a lasagna pan full and made halupki lasagna style with the rest! It makes a truck load! We froze the rolled and ate the lasagna style.

Delicious! My only critique is that it needed more salt. 1/2 tsp. of salt isn't enough for over 3 lbs. of filling.

OMG had 10 over for dinner as a thank you to a friend. He asked for stuffed cabbage so I made this receipt, I doubled it to make enough for all. He LOVED it and all who had never tried stuffed cabbaged loved it too. I made it exactly as the recipie shows except I added a little bit of tomato sauce to the meat mixture.  Made 29 cabbage leaves and everyone took home leftovers.

Loved this dish! However, instead of tomato sauce, I used crushed tomatoes for a thicker, richer sauce. My Man and I loved it!

This was one of my favorite recipe I have found for these so far. I liked the addition of vinegar in the sauce. We have always added tomato soup and Heinz ketchup to our sauce because we love  both together. I only use 1 egg as it makes the inside hard. Thanks Jillian for a good recipe.

Super yummy! Followed everything except for a few minor changes - I used 3 lbs of ground beef instead of the 1.5 lbs of ground beef and 1.5 lbs of ground pork, and substituted 2 large garlic cloves in place of garlic powder. It makes a lot so I had 2 roasting pans of stuffed cabbage so I had to make sauce for each pan (thereby doubling the sauce ingredients) however, I only added 8oz of cabbage water per pan. I put both pans in the middle rack of oven and convection baked it for 2 hours at 350 degrees. I didn't baste cause there was a good amount of sauce. The last half hour I removed the foil so the sauce could evaporate and brown a little. So yummy! A good amount of time was spent boiling the cabbage so next time, I will carefully remove the leaves and boil them as I have seen on another recipe, hopefully reducing the amount of time needed to boil.

I pretty much made it just like the recipe said and it was WONDERFUL!!!  I served it with mashed potatoes and some cooked carrots and everyone enjoyed it, including one son-in-love that said he doesn't normally eat cabbage.  That was a great compliment!

I grew up next to an older Hungarian couple who loved to feed my sister and I . I have searched for something even close to my memory of her amazing cabbage rolls and unfortunately I'm still searching. I found this recipe to be incredibly bland

This recipe tasted exactly like my grandma from Ukraine used to make.  I have made them a handful of times over the past 30 years but was never really satisfied with the way they turned out.  This recipe however was point on!!!  I will be making these regularly now.  Thank you!!!   Scrumotious

Great recipe-- just like Baba's.  Don't skimp on the tomato sauce; it really does make a difference.  (A lot of cheap canned tomatoes are too acidic.)  I used Cento tomato puree, and this was sooo tasty followed exactly as written.  Thanks!

Absolutely delicious. I made it a few times the original recipe, but alter it slightly for my family (more meat, garlic powder upped a bit) and we love it. It tastes just like what my grandmother used to make. Thank you for posting this recipe and taking me back to my childhood every time I make it for my family.

This is one of the very best cabbage rolls recipes I have ever used. The only thing I do different is I throw half a can of Campbell's tomato soup in with the meat mix.

I loved the sauce. Vinegar and sugar added a nice tang.  The meat was very flavorful, yet a little dry.  I will definitely make again.

The basic recipe is what we always used.  But... Everyone went crazy for Mom's "pigs in the blanket" (what we call this in W. Pennsylvania). The 2 secrets: We NEVER bake - we boil the cabbage rolls. For the sauce - add DICED ONION, and use KETCHUP. It makes a sweeter sauce! Mom learned to make this way 80 years ago as a small girl!

This is the closest recipe I can find to my family’s recipe. We could eat halupki every day.

Excellent!  I grew up with my grandmother making halupki and pierogie  for dinner.
   I modify mine a bit.  I layer bacon with a little tomato sauce at the bottom of a dutch oven, place the remaining cabbage leaves on that.  it prevents sticking!  Also, I add onions to the meat and rice, and only use ground beef (the bacon gives the pork flavor.  
   I love the suggestion of coring the cabbage before boiling!  Why didn't I think of that!! 
   Great recipe.

I shouldn't even give it one star. I followed the recipe to the letter. It turned out so bland with these dry globs of meat rolled up in cabbage. Sorry, it is a bust as far as I am concerned.

This was a bit of work. Our store doesn't stock ground pork, so I bought boneless country ribs and ground it myself. Anyway, it was just like my Polish grandma and mom used to make. Well worth it!

These were very good.  I used all ground beef, because that's all I had, and fresh minced garlic and followed rest of the recipe.  I took the leaves off the cabbage and boiled them.  It took quite a while to make.  I rolled them all together and put them in the fridge for the next day.  I made the sauce the next day and baked them for an hour and a half.

This is a very good basic recipe, but I did add some things and we really enjoyed it. Giving 4 stars as written.  I used brown sugar instead of white and added a couple of tsp of Worcester sauce to the tomato sauce (and doubled the sauce because we like a lot of sauce) I used fresh garlic instead of powder and ground ham as opposed to regular pork.  I appreciated the tips for preparing the cabbage leaves.  I used about 4 inches of water in the pot which was plenty.  I didn't use any of the water to thin the sauce. I also didn't precook the rice, after 2.5 hours in the oven, it was perfectly cooked.

My family & I have found this our favorite dish of all time. We all love it!   At 78 Y.Ol, I don't cook a lot but when the mod strikes me they all beg me to make this recipe.  They help with boiling & removing cabbage leaves & I finish up.  I always triple the recipes so everyone can take leftovers home.

This recipe's ingredients are exactly how I made it with my Hungarian grandmother almost 20 years ago. I made it for my family, I received many compliments from them that the hulapki tasted exactly like the way my grandmother made it. 
Easy recipe to follow, no problems at all.
I plan to use the recipe in the future.

Very good!  I used sausage in stead of simple ground pork.  Gave it more spice.  Careful with the vinegar.  I used a bit too much but still was delicious

This is a family Hungarian traditional meal I grew up on.  I added Paprika, celery seed, pepper, salt, cumin, Jsmine rise cooked in a rice cooker, and all spice. 1/2 table spoon for all the spices. Next time I plan to make it with purple cabbage.

Stuffed cabbage rolls is one of my favorite meals from my childhood. Unfortunately, I could never find a recipe under that name that tasted right. Then a friend of mine posted a photo on Facebook and called the dish "Halupki." When I looked it up under that name, I suddenly found tons of recipes that matched my mother's recipe from my childhood! This recipe is the closest I've found, and it's amazing! I made it exactly as it's described here, and it was a huge hit for my family. I'm actually making it again tonight! :D

I have made this before from my grandmothers recipe or what I remember. She never put the extra cabbage on the bottom but I got to say it was fantastic and everyone in the family raved about it. Will definitely make it again following the recipe and maybe even try putting more cabbage on the bottom because the family loves cabbage.

Have you ever used a pressure cooker to make Halupki? I want to try, but I'm nervous about it. Someone told me not to use tomato sauce in pressure cookers because it burns easily. But would the leftover cabbage at the bottom help with that? I always serve mine w/ pierogis mixing nationalities!

I have  always made mine in crockpot with tomatoes and sauerkraut (a must in this dish). I also core cabbage before immersing in water; and slice off the spine on each cabbage leaf after cooking.  Cabbage stuffed with raw meat and cooked rice mixture. One of my all time favorites!! Always make extra, worth the time.

My husband loved this and he is a picky eater. I used fresh tomatoes that were canned from the garden this summer.  Organic large head of cabbage and fresh parsley. Fresh is best. I normally tweak recipes but this is perfect the way it is.  It is time consuming to make but well worth it. I will make again.

We really loved this dish! I did make some alterations for our taste (I used brown sugar instead of white, I used minute rice and added it to the meat mixture uncooked, I also added 2/3c finely diced carrot and 1-tBSP of Worcestershire sauce. I also used dry minced onion instead of fresh diced. My meat mixture was 2lb of pork & 1lb of ground turkey) and they turned out great. 100% will make again!

This was a fairly simple dish to make (other than those blessed cabbage leaves, but that's a given).  I really enjoyed the taste and I would definitely make it again, with the exception of adding some additional sauce or other material to loosen up the filling just a little.  It comes out very compact (good for stuffing) but really dry.  I will give it another try, perhaps with a little extra tomato sauce mixed in, and hope it will show all it's promise!

Excellent! The  things I did differently was, I did not use 12oz of cabbage water in the tomato soup, Yes I used tomato soup (2 large cans) however, I did use the water to thin the soup  to my liking.  The other thing I didn't do was, I didn't add sugar to the soup, but i did add a little vinegar. Great recipe!

I made this recipe and it was EXACTLY as my Mother ( Italian by birth), made it when we were growing up in Pittsburgh, Pa.
She added a can (or bag) of sauerkraut to the recipe, which made it that much better !!

I use Napa cabbage instead. The leaves are more tender, extremely easy to cut and roll making things go much faster. I also add 1/2 pound of cooked finely chopped bacon for an extra bump of flavor.

I made exactly as written and it lacked flavor.  I should have known that a ½ teaspoon of salt and pepper was not enough for an entire pan of rolls.  I also hesitated to add the cabbage water and should have listened to my instincts.  The sauce was way too thin and was almost tasteless.  I've since read other recipes that do not add water but also add a few tablespoons of the tomato sauce to the meat mixture which I think would help. keep the meat tender.  I think the cooking time is too long - two hours would do it.  My apologies to the author of this recipe but I would not make again.

This was great! The only change  I made was to add a can of cream of mushroom soup to the sauce because we like a creamy "pink" sauce. Yum.

don't use tomato sauce, use whole tomatoes , squish the tomatoes into the pot...also, don't use eggs ….ever...not in this recipe  also, use a handful of sauerkraut, makes such a difference....delicious!

WE only made 2 changes to this recipe.... the first one was I only used salt in the water for the cabbage I was cooking because we are cutting back on our salt  & the 2nd change was instead of regular rice , we used Charleston red rice....... it was amazing..... it had plenty of seasonings in it.

My  Italian Grandmother learned how to make halupki's after she immigrated to the U.S. by a Russian neighbor. Through much trial & error, these taste the closest to Nanny's recipe. I sub the 1&1/2 lb. pork for 1&1/2 lb. Jennie O Italian turkey sausage ...(personal preference) otherwise follow it exactly. We LOVE these, Thank you so much for sharing , Jillian!

This Polish Girl doesn't add the egg but I do add 2 or 3 TBSP of the tomato soup to the meat  mixture for a little added flavor.  May be a benefit, may not be, but I've been doing it this way for years. I like it.  :-)  
We also from the time I can remember, cook them slowly on top of the stove, covered with a lid. We place a dish directly on the top of the halupki to keep then from shifting while cooking.  
Thank you for this authentic recipe!  It's deliciously delicious. I have made it twice already and I am making it again today. Will add a photo later too. :-)

4.7.18   A tip from years ago from the Cabbage King cookbook made me prepare my cabbage leaves differently:  freeze the entire head of cabbage, then defrost, cut out the core, and cabbage leaves just fall out.  Sorry, I just couldn’t see all tomato sauce, so I used 1 can each of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce.  I used what was on hand which ended up being more pork than ground beef, but all tasted fine.  Made these cabbage rolls in the morning, refrigerated, and then into the oven for dinner for an easy, but tasty entree. These were very, very good cabbage rolls, served with mashed potatoes and freshly-cooked apples.  Definitely would make again.

These were delicious. I loved the sauce. The filling was very moist and flavorful. Will definitely  make again. Only changes I made were I used fresh garlic and finely chopped onion. also added Hungarian  paprika.  Thanks for the recipe.

I did it unstuffed, like lasagna style, and sprinkled flour on the meat before lettuce, like I would have done had I rolled it.
