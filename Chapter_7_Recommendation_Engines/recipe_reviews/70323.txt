This recipe was actually quite excellent when I made it. However, I did alter the ingredients slightly, omitting the italian seasoning and light cream and substituting fresh basil and oregano and half a cup of sour cream. I also used a strong-flavored mushroom broth in place of the chicken broth.

I have to admit, I decided to go for an ethnic twist to this one, so I substituted coconut milk for half and half, and used cumin, curry, ginger, and garam masala in place of the salt/pepper/seasoning. It was awesome! Very hearty, filling, and easy to make! Thank You!

My husband loves veggies and I love rich foods, this is the best marriage of the two. I double the amount of rice to make it less soupy; and vegetable broth can be easily substituted for chicken broth.

I must say I made some revisions to this recipe.  First off, the eggplant must be soaked in cold, salty water after being cubed, for at least fifteen minutes, then rinsed before cooking.  This alleviates the stringy, bitter toughness you often get with eggplant.    I doubled the amount of mushrooms in this dish.  I sauteed the onions and garlic together until translucent then added the mushrooms and eggplant together instead of cooking separately.  I also splashed some white wine on them while they cooked.    I'm pescetarian, so I subbed vegetable stock for the chicken, and cut the amount in half.  The liquid cookoff from the veggies seemed pretty ample already!    I added a cup of cooked brown rice in addition to the wild rice and it still seemed like there was more than enough liquid so I used only 1/4 cup of evaporated milk to replace the cream, whisked it with the cream of mushroom (I used a lowfat version) and added that for the simmer.  I also subbed 2 tsp. Greek seasoning for the Italian seasoning.  I was going to top it with some crumbled feta but I was out so I garnished with a dollop of Greek yogurt and it was fantastic!    Mine came out great, and I give it a 4.  Since I didn't follow the instructions exactly it is hard to rate this recipe, but it seems as though it would have turned out overly liquidy with all that cream and stock, considering I doubled the rice and the mushrooms and had to cut back on liquid.

this is a great eggplant recipe! i made necessary changes (i excluded cream and cream of mushroom soup) due to current dairy restrictions) and it still turned out excellent.  i added 1 1/2 c extra chx broth and 1 c uncooked basmati race and cooked it all together.  it was wonderfully savory.  my hubby (who is not much of a rice fan) even commented on how good it was.  thank you so much for this recipe!!!

Sooo good. Works as a main dish as well as a side dish. I actually followed Alysta's variation on this recipie, and added cashews as well. It was a hit! Thank you both for saving Christmas Eve dinner!

what an awesome dish to use up my extra eggplant !  extremely rich, so went perfect with a loaf of brown bread.  i can't wait to make this for my vegetarian sister.

and btw: i used cottage cheese instead of cream (because that's what i had) and 2 cups chicken-flavored wild rice-a-roni instead of regular rice (because that's what i had).

I thought this recipe was really good.  I added chicken as another user suggested and I also added a can of diced tomatoes.  I must say that it did look absolutely awful but the taste was great.  Please remember, for those of you that didn't like the recipe, maybe it's just that you don't like eggplant!  It's no for everyone...

Delicious and hearty!  I too cooked the veggies together, not separate, to save time - substituted basmati rice for the wild, sour cream for the half-and-half, and sprinkled feta on top.

Great recipe! I did think it needed a little more salt and garlic. I also soaked the eggplant in salt and water (in the frig) for about 45 minutes as suggested. It worked great! The eggplant did not fall apart.

Hmm. Well, there are good and bad things here.  Mushrooms and wild rice were made for each other.  I kept to the recipe other than doubling the rice.  It was a nice creamy sauce, I liked that texture after I doubled the amount of wild rice.  The seasoning was great.  On the other hand the canned soup flavor/stickiness didn't work that well here.  I think a homemade bechamel would be a better flavor/texture balance if we are looking for creaminess.  The eggplant was completely lost.  If I didn't cook it myself I would never know eggplant was even in there.  To recreate this better for me I would leave out the soup and make my own thinner, lighter cream sauce.  I loved the idea of eggplant with these ingredients so I plan to revisit this with the tweaks I mentioned.

How simple. I used fat free milk and was very pleased. It was like a really easy risotto. Oh, I ended up using sushi rice, adding it uncooked so it took longer and I needed a little more moisture.

This was very good! My picky boyfriend who hates eggplant even liked it! I did take someone's posted suggestion and added a pinch of curry and cumin, also a pinch of cayenne pepper as well.   Also,I used brown rice instead of wild. :)

My second time making it I also switched the half and half with sour cream, and fried on each side pork loins and added them with the cream of mushroom soup and stuff. SUPER!

This is the first eggplant recipe I've ever liked, and it's delicious.  With family dietary restrictions in mind, I skipped the last 3 ingredients.  It was wonderful on baked potatoes.  Also, we added soy parmaesan on top to add a bit of zip.  Yummy!

I like all the individual ingredients of this dish, but putting them together just made a mush.  I didn't even add the cream and it was still way too soupy.

Eveyone loves this. I used Creole Seasoning instead of Italian Seasoning because that's what I had on hand, and it adds a nice kick to it that I think makes it really stand out.

This was unusual but tasty. I would make this again. I added some frozen peas to mine as well. Served with some breaded baked chicken. My 16 month old loved it (he's not a typical toddler....he'll eat just about anything!).

In my opinion, this is too heavy for a side dish.  It is a fantastic recipe.  I made a few substitutions: veg broth, creamed golden mushroom soup and extra garlic.  I wound up adding more rice to absorb the extra liquid.  To make this a main dish meal, I added seasoned ground beef (it was what I had on hand).  I will be making this again but will try ground Italian sausage.

This is a simple recipe that is creamy, has great flavor and a rustic, homey feel! I had to make a few adjustments based on what I had on had (veggie broth instead of chicken broth, evaporated milk instead of half and half, and brown rice instead of wild rice, and baby bella mushrooms) but it was still delicious and a hit with the whole family, even my picky eater/semi-vegetarian daughter.

Really good! The family enjoyed it at Easter dinner. But it took me twice as long to cook as the recipe indicated (probably partially because I made a double batch).

I added white meat cooked chicken breast to my recipe and instead of adding cream of mushroom soup I used a can of cream of chicken.Was really a great recipe.

It was ok... It looked like something I don't want to say since this is a food site, I did changed the rice for brown rice, maybe that's what made it look like v...t? Oh well, won't make it again to find out.

But it was fun making it and trying something different.

Thanks!

I thought this was kinda a plain and a mushy texture.  I put the mixture over pan fried chx and it was just okay.  I don't think I'll make it again.

Simply awesome.  The only thing I changed was to make it vegetarian by substituting vegetable broth.  Will definitely make this again!

Very rich and creamy.  Reminds me of Italian risotto.  I really liked a lot.  I have substituted with sour cream instead of half & half, but will try with half & half (or even milk) for a bit lighter texture.  Also I doubled the amount of wild rice.  Since the base is rather rich, I think that wild rice is a good choice for the entire texture and balance.  Will reduce amount of salt/pepper/Italian seasoning a bit next time, as the chicken broth has enough flavor on its own. Or perhaps use vegetable broth for lighter flavor.  Love it! Very flavorful and delicious.

I gave this four stars because I think there are some inherantly good ideas and many possibilities for this recipe - but as is, it's a bit creamy/soupy for my taste.  I think I'll try this again with twice the rice and poured over chicken and then baked, or as a modified stroganoff with pieces of chicken or pork.  Nevertheless, it was yummy, it just needs to be served carefully so as not to be overpowering.

I love eggplant, but this just didn't do it for me.  The consistency was mushy and unappetizing, and it lacked flavor.  I don't know what could be done to help it, but this was a waste of ingredients.

I used whole milk instead of the cream.  I  cooked 1 cup of wild rice and used it all in the dish.  We thought this dish was nice and tasty.

This was a wonderfully different way to eat eggplant. I am an eggplant lover, so I don't need it to be hidden away, but my husband liked this too, and he's NOT an eggplant fan normally. Because I had a package of Uncle Ben's long grain and wild rice, I used that for the wild rice, and I used the seasoning packet that came with the rice with water in place of the Italian seasoning and stock. But otherwise I followed the instructions exactly. It was delicious, and made great leftovers too!

Very tasty. A little rich however for a side dish and that was even using milk rather than cream. Next time I will halve the recipe and 1/4 the sauce, leaving out the cream of mushroom soup and thicken the sauce with a touch of flour. The left overs are not good - the ingredients all become mush. Only make enough for that night according to number of diners. As is I would say it serves 6-8.

This was not a hit in my family. It is not even worthy of keeping leftovers. It has an odd taste from the Italian seasoning.

I gave it four stars because it started me off on the right path to a new vegetarian dish. I subbed/omitted to much to make any comments. Thanks for the idea:)
