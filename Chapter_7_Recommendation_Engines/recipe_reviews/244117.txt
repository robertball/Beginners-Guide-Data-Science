Steak was delicious and had lots of flavor- we too cooked it inside and it worked out great. I would have liked more pepper but that can always be added.

This is a great marinade. The only change we made was we cooked the steak in doors on a hot skillet vbecause of the weather. It a very good steak and weâ€™ll use it again.

Used the sear burner on my grill to make this tasty way to prepare sirloin.  Will use it again.

I didn't have access to the beef base listed so I substituted Savory Spice Shop Mt. Massive Steak Seasoning.  I followed the rest of the recipe precisely and marinated the steaks for 2-3 hours.  Delicious!
