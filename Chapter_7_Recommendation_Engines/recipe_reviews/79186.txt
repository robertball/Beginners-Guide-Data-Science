The only thing I changed was the amounts of milk and cream of mushroom.  My family doesn't like the "gooy" texture.  So, I used the same ingredients, just enough to make a sauce, Man, these were the best green beans ever!!!! Everyone raved over the taste!! Thanks you made green beans a HIT!

Very good, I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving and it was totally wiped out!  The only change that I might make in the future is to cut down on the soy sauce or to use lite soy sauce.  The flavor of the soy seemed to be a little overbearing, but still tasty!

This is very good, I did make my own cream soup/sauce and added lightly sauteed chopped fresh mushrooms to the sauce.  I also used fresh green beans, but frozen are fine too.

I thought the red pepper taste was a little overwhelming and the mozzarella cheese was unnoticed and therefore probably unnecessary.

I'm a pretty tough reviewer and have lately found flops here, but this recipe turns that around!!  I'll never make another green bean casserole than this one again -- and liked it so well, I'll probably make it for several parties. WOW!  Neither I nor my family could believe that GB casserole could be so easy and deliecious. Used 2 drained cans of french cut beans, went with vermouth, didn't add any salt, and didn't measure fried onions.  Also used about 2:1 chopped onions to red peppers.  Next time I may throw fresh shrooms into the saute, too, but just 'cause I love them, not need them.  AWSOME RECIPE!!! Thanks for it!

Thanks Andy! This recipe is fantastic and a great twist on an old standby. Everyone at Thanksgiving raved about it. I'll definitely use it for Christmas too, especially because it looks so festive with the green beans and red bell peppers.

Everyone at Thanksgiving loved this and even my mom requested the recipes (she doesn't even like green bean casserole that much). I liked it so much I think that I will make it again this week for dinner! Thanks Andy!

Love it! I was looking all over for a variation of the basic recipe.  And I found it the night before Thanksgiving..lol.  I did change it for my tastes. I used 32 oz of frozen green beans (partially cooked until all warm, drained). 1-1/2 cans cream of mushroom, eyeballed the milk that looked like a slightly thick gravy. I didn't have red bell pepper, so just used 1/2 of large onion.  I didn't use soy sauce, however, used 1-2 tsps of dry mustard (Note dry mustard is not wet mustard. They are two different animals), garlic powder to taste and two shakes of worcestershire sauce and black pepper to taste. I also didn't use butter and cheese.  I didn't think it needed butter and the sauce tasted great without it. Everyone loved it!

SO GOOD! Always a huge hit, the red pepper is a great pop of color and flavor to this traditional dish. The white wine is also a must!

Here are my changes to the recipe: I left out the bacon and mozzarella cheese.  I also included 1.5 cans of the cream of mushroom soup instead of 1.  Overall, I liked this recipe.  I am sure it would have been fine with the bacon and cheese; I just wanted to reduce the cost and caloric intake.  I was hoping the thawed french cut style beans that I had used would have been a bit more tender.  (At the time, I didn't want to use canned beans.)  That's the only reason for giving this recipe a 4-star rating.

Amazing flavor even before putting it in the oven!  Everyone absolutely loved this dish!  I didn't have any wine so that was omitted and frankly, I don't think it could have tasted any better with it. I added extra bacon because really, Who doesn't? Also these were great heated up and eaten the next day.  This recipe will be forever in my favs box. Thank you so much for the share :)

If you don't like green bean casserole and were hoping you could make this and finally enjoy it -- YOU WON'T.  It isn't much different from the original -- which I hate -- and if you don't like the original you won't enjoy this either. I made it because my father-in-law likes green bean casserole and I hoped we could make this part of our yearly spread.  I noticed he didn't touch much of it and didn't request any for his leftover package. We tossed 3/4 of a casserole dish full of this stuff. A real waste.

Once you make this green bean casserole you will never make the old "blah" recipe again.  This recipe is delicious.  Everyone raved at Thanksgiving dinner.  I made a few minor changes however.  I substituted diced fresh mushrooms for the bell pepper and used shredded fresh parmesan cheese.  I also cooked the green beans a bit.  Fantastic recipe!!!

Did a pre-Thanksgiving test run and voted to include it this year.  Needed a little more salt than I thought...and I used worcestershire instead of soy sauce, which I think was better.  Will probably add a ritz cracker topping.  It's a keeper.

YUMMY!!!  The BEST Green Bean Casserole I have ever made and tasted!  Tastes like the original but better.  

A few things...I was chopping celery for stuffing and was multi-tasking and accidently put 1/2 cup in this mixture.  I don't know if it changed the flavor but it didn't make it bad.  And, I live in a small town with only one grocery store.  I waited to the last minute to shop and they were out of plain Cream of Mushroom soup so I used Cream of Mushroom with Garlic...yum.  (BTW, the red pepper is an interesting twist.)

My husband does not like green beans that much but gobbled this up!!  Will definately make this again.  A new holiday staple!

I would give this one a 10 star if I could. Everyone loved this recipe. The only difference I did, since I have to cut down on salt, was omitted the soy sauce and I didn't even add the salt and pepper to taste. I would have put the pepper in, just forgot. It tasted just fine. Soups tend to have a lot of salt in them anyway. Plus, I accidentally put in 1 cup of mozzarella instead of 1/2 cup. My Mom took home the recipe :) Another thing I did was buy a jar of real bacon bits. I cooked the onion and (whole) red bell pepper and put 4 Tble of the bacon bits in the butter. Yummy! This one is a keeper for sure.

Wonderful Andy!  I took this to our family Christmas Eve dinner party tonight.  Everyone loved it!  The red pepper makes it a beautiful dish for Christmas.  I used frozen Italian green beans which were thawed in fridge overnight.  I followed the recipe exactly, only doubled everything.  I still used a 9 x 13 and increased baking time by 15 minutes.  Our family came up with new names for the dish when they asked me for the recipe: Internet Green Beans and High Tech Green Beans.

This is a keeper!!! My only change was to triple the recipe and added the cheese to the sauce and then mixed in the beans.  This still easily fit a 9 x 13 pan.  I predict that this recipe will be a big hit in the future.  The sauce would work well with all kinds of veggies or potatoes.

While this is an improvement over the basic Green Bean Casserole included on most product packages, I still wouldn't call this great.  It has some great flavors like the white wine, onion, and just a touch of soy sauce, but the bacon is overpowering I think.  I find the cheese an odd addition and although I LOVE cheese, it just didn't go with these flavors and only added to the weird slimy texture.  Mainly though, I just don't care for the canned soup flavor and slimy texture.  

Although it takes so much more time, I will keep making my green bean casserole from scratch by cooking down fresh mushrooms and making a rue.

I followed the recipe except used 2 cans (14.5oz each) of cut green beans (1 can did not look like enough); ommitted alcohol (could not find either). Just AWESOME.  Will be making again soon.  Thanks so much!

Absolutely the BEST green bean casserole I've ever made for Thanksgiving. I only added minced fresh garlic to the onions and peppers but kept the rest exactly as it is here. I would like it not to be so high on sodium since I do have high blood pressure but hey...once a year...that's what BP meds are for, right?

This was amazing! My daughter and I don't really like green bean casserole but this was great. I changed it up a bit because I didn't have all the ingredients,like instead of mozzerella i used shredded cheddar and no peppers and no white wine . It was amazing ...Everyone ate it all!!!

I've always found green bean casserole kinda boring.  I was asked to make it for Thanksgiving, so decided adding bacon and cheese would make it fantastic! Sadly, it still did not make any impression.

This was awesome! Fixing a new dish for my three kids always runs through strict scrutiny by them yet they loved it! I used maple flavored bacon and like it better than with plain bacon. Will try to get low sodium mushoom soup and soy sauce as well because it was too salty last attempt. I didn't have the bell pepper either and used a dash of crushed red pepper. Skipped the french fried onions as my kids won't touch them. Still became one of their favorites!!

Made this with a few modifications for xmas dinner and everyone really enjoyed it. I omitted the bacon and cheese, added sliced fresh mushrooms, water chesnuts and substituted chow mein noodles for the French fried onions.

My husband, who hates vegetables so much that he claims to be allergic to everything, LOVED this dish. I made it sans bell peppers and french fried onions - also used fresh mozzarella balls for the cheese. Served with rice and grilled salmon steaks seasoned with salt & pepper and a squeeze of lemon. YUM!

This is hands down the BEST recipe for Green Bean Casserole! I have been making this for a few years now and have not changed or modified one ingredient. I always find the need to tinker with recipes BUT this is one of two recipes from this site that I refuse to modify, they are perfect as is.  If interested, the other unmodified recipe is "Awesome Sausage, Apple and Cranberry Stuffing" submitted by Stacy Polcyn. Outstanding, thank you!!

I tried this recipe a little over a year ago because I was tired of the same old green bean casserole. I was not for sure how the family would take it, but dinner was at my house. Ever since ANY time we have a dinner get together holiday or not, this is what I'm asked to bring. GREAT RECIPE!!!

I loved this recipe so much last year at Easter that I searched through my 27 pages of side dishes so I could make it again this year! I've never been a big fan of Green Bean Casseroles until I tasted this one. The soy sauce, onions, and bacon, and red pepper mesh beautifully to spice up the old standard.

Great recipe to give you a nice variation on green bean casserole while making it still recognizable.  I made a few changes based on what I had on hand and my laziness tonight.  Used two cans of cut green beans, a bag of real bacon bits, dehydrated chopped onion, jarred roasted red peppers, worchester in place of soy sauce and two triangles of laughing cow instead of mozzarella, .  Skipped all the stove top cooking since I didn't need to cook bacon and onions and just threw it all together in the oven.  Came out very good and I will probably make again.  Next time I'll use real bacon and onions as those are the perfect compliments to green beans.

I made this for our Thanksgiving family gathering and it was a definate hit.  Even my kids loved it and went back for seconds.  I made it again upon their request and it was just  as good the second time.  This will become our new green bean casserole recipe for Thanksgiving from now on.

I almost NEVER write reviews for anything, but I had to for this recipe.  It is sooo delicious! I was looking for a different green bean casserole recipe because I do NOT like the typical slimy, stringy casserole that you usually get. This recipe is on a completely different level. Also it's pretty easy to make, but tastes like a more complex, you-slaved-over-it type of dish. I now make it every year for Thanksgiving dinner.  Great job, AndyKnepper!

This was great! We had to substitute a few things...we didn't have soy sauce so we used Worcheshire sauce and we didn't have a fresh onion so we used minced onion. The family loved it!

This was awesome!  Even my fiance gave it a 5 star rating, and he usually doesn't give higher than a 4!  I used fresh green beans and parboiled them first, and they came out perfect!  Will definitely be adding this recipe into my main rotation of meals!

I have been using this recipe for green bean casserole for a few years now and to this day, we still love it as much as we did the first time I made it.  All of the ingredients in this version work so deliciously together it should almost be against the law to make it any other way.  It's a 'must have' at every holiday dinner I cook...Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, birthdays, anniversary.  Everyone loves it.  Bravo Andyknepper.

Made this for a holiday party pot luck and it was a big hit.  Much better than the traditional bland green bean casserole.  Only change I made was to use about 50% more green beans than the recipe listed (used three 8oz cans instead of frozen).

i altered the recipe to yield more servings it then required for me to use 2 cans of cream of mushroom, but since im not a big fanof those condensed soups or creams  i added 1 can and 1 can full of chicken broth. I added 2 more cups of cream beans than what the then altered recipe called for and they came out delishis. Thank you for your recipe!

I will never make that traditional green bean casserole again.  This is dee-lish and always gets big thumbs up.  I usually double the recipe and use a 9x13 dish, but I use only one can of cream of mushroom soup and trim down the butter a little--it doesn't need it.  And I can't help but use lots of bacon, which only makes it better.

This made a hit for my Thanksgiving meal with my husband's family, so I cooked it the following week for my brother's home coming and was again raved about by my family.

I made this recipe with fresh green beans, it tasted great (no yucky mushy beans) and everyone loved it.  It was a bit time consuming preparing the beans, so next time I will try it with frozen beans.

This is almost exactly how I make my green bean casserole, except I add a few slices of bacon crumbled up and no wine. I did make this though at it was pretty darn good. I still like adding bacon and green pepper though. It is different from the old standby green bean casserole and that is what caught my attention. However I think I will stick to my version. It is not as healthy as this one b/c of the bacon but oh well.

This is wonderful!  Very good change to a traditional recipe.  I left out the red pepper (didn't have any) and added a bit more mozzerella cheese.  It was nice and stringy and creamy.  VERY good!

Very interesting twist on a old favorite, a more grown up version!  This was a litlle more involved than the standard (open and dump), but worth the effort.

Loved this!  I don't usually care for green  bean casserole, but this was great!  I didn't use bacon (though it would probably be good w/), and I added a bit of Tabasco sauce.

I was going to rate this 2 stars, but some people ate it.  I made this for the first time on Easter.  I'm glad I warned everybody that I was experimenting with a new recipe! It says to put the fried onions on before putting it in the oven.  I put them on after it had been in for 15 minutes and I'm glad I did.  After 10 minutes,they were very dark.  Besides this, I made it as the recipe reads.  I found it bland and I agree with others that the cheese was unnecessary.  At the end of dinner, I noted that guests had eaten everything on their plate EXCEPT for the green beans.  Nobody wanted to take any of the leftovers home.  That told me all I needed to know.  Will go beck to the traditional dish next year.

I found the flavor too complex; the ingredients argued with each other. In addition, the dish was a bit too unattractive for a special-occasion table.

Very good! I was excited to find this recipe because I did want a green bean casserole, but something with a little pizazz. My husband won a Honey-Baked Ham at work and this side dish perfectly complemented it. My husband (and stepson) loathe mushrooms, so I used Cream of Chicken instead. I also used 1/4 cup of bacon bits because I was in a bit of a hurry. I used green pepper instead of red and simmered both the onions and peppers in the butter. I then added the rest of the ingredients according to the recipe. It came out so delicious! My stepson has brought in his girlfriend for Christmas and she loves the "usual" green bean casserole but said she really liked this one! I was tempted to finish the leftovers but knew I'd look like a piglet! Definitely will make again. Thanks for sharing!

Simply delicious. I got away from my normal green beans for Thanksgiving and went to a casserole. It's a normal casserole until you alter the taste with the wine, soy sauce and cheese. It was so good I made it again the next nite to go with the leftovers 'cause it was all gone the first day.

Really like the color addition of the red peppers, but the cheese was more an annoyance with its stringiness than a positive with flavoring.  I think I prefer the original.

This was a nice twist on the traditional casserole. The red peppers really added to the flavor--in fact, I think it could have used even more. I used fresh green beans, so the dish needed to bake longer. Plus, I omitted the bacon, caramelized the onions, and added a few french-fried onions into the mix. I didn't use milk, and I thought the dish was fine without it. The leftovers were even better. I'll definitely keep this for holiday dinners.

I made this for Thanksgiving and got lots of compliments, though some were disappointed that it wasn't my sister's "traditional" recipe with canned beans.  I used fresh green beans...which turned out to be a bit tough (out of season), so I had to cook a bit longer at lower heat, but it turned out well. Next time, I'll use frozen beans and try topping with cheddar cheese and something "crunchy". This is definitely a recipe I can "work with"!

This is the best green bean casserole I have ever had. I made it as written with the only exception being I use 3 cans of cut green beans instead of frozen I have always found other green bean casseroles rather boring. Not this one. My grandson who isn't a vegetable eater went back for thirds. Definitely a keeper.

Too salty. May decrease soy sauce to 1 T. Also has a lot of excess moisture, probably from using frozen green beans.

This was a little more labor intensive than the standard recipe, but sooooo worth it!   I didn't have fresh red peppers so I added some diced roasted red peppers, and I used Merlot instead of white wine since that's what I had on hand.   I trippled the recipe for a neighborhood party and it was all gone!

I've made this 3 times now, the first 2 following the recipe except that I omitted the red bell pepper and used 14.5 oz canned cut green beans.   The 3rd time I made it I realized, too late, that I had forgotten to buy the cream of mushroom soup.   I googled for substitute and replaced the soup by using the following.  

1 1/2 tbs butter
1 tbs flour
1/4 cup chicken broth
1/4 cup milk
4 diced fresh cremini mushrooms (stems removed)
Melt butter, add flour and whisk till nutty smell. 2-3 min over med heat. Whisk in milk & broth and bring to boil, whisking till thick. Add mushrooms and set aside.

I also combined crushed Ritz crackers as well as the French fried onions for the topping.   The recipe as it stands is wonderful, but I thought substituting the above when time to normally add soup gave the dish a deeper flavor.

The above is similar to a bechamel or blond roux depending on how long you cook it before adding the milk & broth, but I'm tempted to try it next by making a darker roux...and YES, the bacon is a MUST!

Love this recipe!!  The bell pepper and bacon make this so much better than the average bean casserole.  I doubled the recipe and followed as is.  It filled a 13 x 9" baking dish.  This will now be on the menu every year for our Thanksgiving dinner, and several times throughout the year as well.

I found this recipe in here a few years ago.  I use it every Thanksgiving.  My green bean casserole is always a huge hit and everyone always compliments it.  I pretty much keep to the recipe, sometimes I swap the bacon out and use ham instead.   I use fresh green beans instead of canned or frozen. I add a little more onions since we love grilled onions.  The red pepper adds a great extra flavor.  I don't even like mushroom or cream of mushroom but once it is cooked in with all the flavors even the mushroom tastes good to me.   It is always very delicious and definitely the best green bean casserole I have ever had!

Made this for my first ever time cooking Thanksgiving Dinner for combined family.  They all loved it, even my mother asked me for the recipe, as well as the other family's normal holiday chef.  Nice combo of flavors.  The cheese and soy sauce really do bring a change.  Also, I didn't use the wine, and it still came out PERFECT!!

I liked having a green bean casserole that was a little different from my regular one.  My daughter really missed the Worcestershire sauce so she gave it a 4. I think it was great.  I did have to make a few changes, due to what I had on hand. I don't think they would have made a great big change though.  I only had an orange pepper, not a red.  I used fresh green beans instead of frozen, and the last one which may have changed things a little was that I didn't have cream of mushroom, only a cream of chicken & mushroom soup. As far as the cheese the shredded I had on hand was a mozzarella mixture with other cheeses.  Over all I think it still did great.  Next time though I would want to use the mushroom soup so I could taste the mushroom more.

I will never touch another green bean casserole recipe again, this was soooo nommy! The only thing I changed was that I used turkey bacon instead and used a bit of olive oil in the place of grease. I have been asked to make it time and time again, by friends and the family. This recipe is worth keeping and handing down to my kids. Enjoy this one!

I don't normally like green bean casserole but thought I'd try this one out, hoping my kids would like it.  My picky daughter wouldn't touch the gooey beans, but the rest of us loved it!  I used a full small can of dried onions, omitted the red pepper and think that the mozzarella was unnoticable so I will omit that next time as well.

I made this for Easter and everyone loved it. I am now in charge of green bean casserole for Thanksgiving :) I subbed out the canned soup with CREAM SOUP BASE FOR CASSEROLES(fat-free) Worked out fantastic. Thanks for the recipe.

This is excellent. Enough like the original to satisfy those folks and enough different to make it interesting. I used fresh green beans, so if you like those better go for it - it turned out great. My only mistake for Thanksgiving dinner? ... I should have doubled the recipe!

I have to say, I was very disappointed with this recipe considering the rave reviews. I followed it exactly except for subbing chicken broth for white wine. I actually prefer the original recipe over this. I think the soy sauce was too strong of a flavor in it. Other people did say they liked it, but no one raved over it.

I will never make the old traditional green bean casserole again.  This dish smells so good as you are making it.  I doubled the recipe for Thanksgiving.  My mother-in-law who generally does not like green bean casserole said that it was "very good" and asked for the recipe.  I used vermouth - would probably use a tad bit less next time as it was a good but strong taste.  I also used onion salt in place of the onions that were to be sauted with the pepper since my family doesn't really care for onion pieces.

I made the regular boring green bean recipe for Thanksgiving last year I had made this particular one and FORGOT about it until last minute- so took the regular boring green bean and added the cheese at last minute-it was very good- however, this Christmas we are going with the Tasty Green Bean Casserole which got rave reviews last year. It is in my permanent recipe box now!

Absolutedly Awesome!! I made this recipe for the guys at deer camp this year and doubled it to serve 16. Some of the guys never got a chance to even taste it - that is how fast it went.  It was delicious and not your plain green bean casserole which everybody makes.  I like to give my dishes an interesting twist and this certainly had it.

Outstanding -- much better than the usual bland version.  I'll definitely be making this again.
