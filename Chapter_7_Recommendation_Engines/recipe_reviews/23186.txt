I added two tablespoons more milk (I did use lactose-free milk, as my youngest boy has a milk allergy), upped the cinnamon to a half teaspoon and I added a splash of vanilla extract. I chose to use Wonder Texas Toast--what happened is I was able to make five pieces of french toast because the bread was quite a bit thicker than your average white bread. The kids loved it. NO leftovers.

Of course this is just a plain old fashioned french toast recipe! Isn't that what's it's all about? With all of the more "gourmet" type french toast recipes on this site, I'm sure there are plenty of novice cooks out there who welcome knowing how to make this basic comforting dish.

This definitely is "good old fashioned french toast" - one of my all time breakfast favorites! I don't know if I'd call this "ultimate" and everyone has their own particular way of making french toast to their liking.  I add a little more milk, some white sugar, a tsp. of vanilla and a bit of nutmeg along with the cinnamon to the mixture.  And just as the submitter states, serve hot wtih butter and maple syrup (a little dusting of powdered sugar never hurt either) - YUM!

I love french toast. I adjust the eggs to however many slices of bread I use. Usually use french, italian or white bread. I start out with 2 eggs and a little bit of milk and sprinkle in cinnamon and about 1/4 tsp. of vanilla extract. Then sprinkle additional cinnamon on each side. Sometimes I've even added a touch of orange juice to eggs. Then I fry in oil until crispy. People that have had it say it is the best french toast. Such a good flavor with the vanilla and cinnamon. Try it! Thanks!

Both of my little ones really enjoyed this.  I did add some sugar to the batter because I don't like to drown their slices in syrup.  My son enjoyed his with peanut butter.  Thanks for this simple but kid-friendly recipe Sevanna.

You need to add a bit extra grease to the pan so the toast won't stick. Also, I had to double everything but the bread because there weren't enough eggs. It could've done with about a tablespoon extra of milk, and when I ate some, I found that the inside was a bit mushy, as though it hadn't been cooked enough. Next time I'll go a little lighter on how much egg I put onto the bread so it's not so mushy.

This has a very high egg to milk ratio, basically an egg for every slice of bread.  I needed to double the recipe, but just couldn't justify using 8 eggs for 8 slices of french toast.  So I only used 6 eggs and increased the milk just a tad.  The recipe turned out great, and not too eggy.  Everyone loved it and it cooked up nice and fluffy.

I loved this recipe, but added 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 TBSP cinnamon, 2 Tsp sugar, and 2 TBSP heavy cream.  Also depending on the type of bread you are using don't let it soak too long, or it will get very wet and be hard to get in the pan.  Also whisk your eggs, cinnamon and vanilla all together before adding milk or cream to evenly disperse the cinnamon througout, otherwise your cinnamon will clump.

This recipe is easy and good.  Definitely fulfilled my french toast craving.  I used texas style bread.  I did add 1t vanilla.  Topped with syrup and fresh cut strawberries.  ALSO, very important step my mom taught me... TOAST THE BREAD FIRST in the toaster!

Very good!  Made three slices per person (young teenagers) and it was too much for half of them.  If you plan about 2.5/person that should be good. (Two was too much for me.) I am sure leftovers will heat up in snap.  Added vanilla as recommended and used cinnamon raisin bread (perfect choice).  The ratio of eggs to milk is perfect not too soggy or dry.  Did up all the bread and set aside. Used both a frying pan (3 slices) and a griddle (6 slices), went very quick. Added margerine to pan/griddle to give some more flavour and crispyness.  Put some thick-sliced bacon on parchment paper on a cookie sheet (with edges) in the oven at 375°F for half an hour ahead (drain fat and broil on low for last few minutes) and everything was ready at once.  Start to finish, including eating took one hour.

This is a basic recipe, a good start. Like many others, I use a tsp of vanilla and up the cinnamon (it depends on how strong/fresh yours is). I also add 2T. of maple syrup and 1/8 tsp of ground nutmeg to the soak (it's not meant to be a batter, it is a soak). I use stale/day old bread--the origins of this dish is pain perdu, lost bread, it's what one can do with less-than-fresh bread (hence the need for a soak). Alternatively, one can do as someone else suggested--toast the bread first.

IF YOU WANT EXCELLENT FRENCH TOAST, USE DAY OLD ENGLISH MUFFIN BREAD OR HOMEMADE WHITE BREAD THAT IS SLICED AND DAY OLD OR STALE.  ALSO, WHEN YOU FRY THE FRENCH TOAST, SPRINKLE ONE SIDE WITH A CINNAMON SUGAR MIXTURE BEFORE YOU FLIP IT. IT WILL MAKE A NICE SUGARY, CARAMELIZED "CRUST" ON THAT SIDE. IT WON'T EVEN NEED SYRUP!

Wonderful basic recipe...quick hint, if you want the cinnamon evenly distributed throughout the mixture, whisk eggs and cinnamon together, then add the milk.

Great recipe!  Tasty, fast and easy to make and fast and easy to clean up.  I double the amount of milk so it wouldn't be so eggy and added 1 tsp. of vanilla as others suggested.  I also added 1 tbsp. of sugar to sweeten it up a bit.  Will make again!

This was so simple and so great - I read through all the reviews and decided to use the flavored creamer in place of the milk – I used Vanilla Carmel and did 1Tablespoon per egg and upped the cinnamon and wow – had some Redi-whip handy so I put two dollops on for looks – we loved it!

My family loves this recipe!! For a little holiday flavor I substitued egg nog for the milk and nutmeg for the cinnamon. My family loved it. The recipe is great as is though.

This recipe is easy and delicious.  Nothing fancy, just down-to-earth good home
cooking!  My husband is usually wary of trying new things, and a generally picky 
eater, but he loved this (and so did his picky younger brother)!   This will be a 
well-used recipe in our home!

I did end up adding additional cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla extract as suggested by other reviewers but it ended up taking GREAT! Thanks for the recipe.

Can't beat this old standby - for the mom who adds sugar to the batter --- we never had ours with syrup - mom always put butter on ours and lightly sprinkled with sugar -- I still eat mine the same way.  I do add vanilla to mine and have some friends who add almond extract.

4.5 Stars: This is a great classic French Toast, but I added at least a teaspoon of vanilla.  I have made it twice and found it a little eggy.  I will decrease it by one egg and/or add more milk next time.

I'm going to try it the way one suggested, like her Mother taught her, to TOAST the bread first. It took me years b4 I found someone said to add vanilla. You'll always need minimum of 1 t vanilla That will always 'make' your french toast. Not fair to 'rate it' if you change it s. I'm 'rating' it low as it is not a good recipe 'without' a teaspoon of vanilla, it's dull!!! I'm an old/er person that bakes a lot and loves to 'revamp'/'perfect' recipes.  (That's per FECT, not PER fect). JudyK Iowa

"This is a good, old-fashioned way of making delicious French toast. To add a little pizzazz to it, sprinkle on some cinnamon after dipping the bread into the batter. And add a couple drops of vanilla (to your taste). Serve hot with butter and Sugar or powder sugar not maple syrup. This is so good, enjoy!!"

I totally agree with reviwer Linda M. I have made french toast for years and always wondered why mine never tasted as good as others. Wasn't til I got on this great site and learned I was using way too much milk which was why mine was too soggy! This basic recipe is all ya need. Nothin fancy but does the trick!

I've been making french toast for years with pretty much this recipe.  It's super easy and so good!  It's also really easy to half the recipe or even do a single serving, just reduce the amount of eggs and add just a splash of milk.  It's great with or without the cinnamon, but as a cinnamon lover I say the cinnamon only serves to make it better!

I've made French Toast this way for years! Although, sometimes I don't use the cinnamon as in this case. Cinnamon does add a nice flavor to it. Will continue making my French Toast this way for years to come.

In the place of the milk I used flavored coffee creamer. I used cinnamom vanilla but any kind would work to add extra flavor. Next time I might try pumpkin or caramel flavor.

This is the way my dad always made french toast for me growing up, except he added a little vanilla to the milk/egg mixture and put the cinnamon in as well, although i think i like the idea of sprinkeling on the cinnamon, sometimes it would clump or just float on the top.

Whenever I make French Toast, I always add almond extract, instead of adding vanilla. It's much more flavorful.  And I know it's weird, but ever since I was a kid, I have always preferred sprinkling sugar on my French Toast instead of syrup.

Just like other reviewers, I agree that this is a "basic" french toast recipe that is easy to prepare and quite good. I add vanilla butter nut extract and orange zest to my egg mixture and sprinkle the finished product with extra cinnamon and powdered sugar. YUM!!

Not ultimate, since you need to add vanilla, but a good start.

One of my husband's favorite breakfasts is a simple French toast. And that's exactly what this is. Simple and delicious. Hubby eats his French toast plain so I like to slip in a tablespoon or two of sugar to the mix.

This is IT! This is now my go-to recipe for French Toast.
Loved how it's more eggs than milk. I used my electric mixer to mix it up real well. Other than that, I didn't change a thing.

I kicked up this French toast a peg or two by utilizing sour dough bread; use this bread when I cook for large groups...100 to 500 and they often ask how I make it....soooo good with maple syrup and or whipped cream or just power sugar on it....ummmm! jim

It was good, except I didn't like how the cinnamon acted in the egg and milk mixture, so I just sprinkled it on top at the end. And to give it a little bit of a sweet pick me up, I added 4 drops of liquid sweetener and 1/8 teaspoon of vanilla. The hint of vanilla in the after taste was really good! This was my first time making French Toast myself, and this recipe was really good!

This was okay. The egg batter was very thick though and the bread didn't really get moist in the middles. I had more than enough batter and could have gotten by with half the amount. It turned out fine, but wasn't my favorite.

This is a really good base recipe however when making it, it just felt like it was missing something so I added a bit of nutmeg (about half as much as the cinnamon) and it was awesome.  I was able to cook it 8 slices up on my griddle.  I used thick slice bread and there was none left!

Yummy in my tummy.  No need to complicate French Toast.  Good recipe although 8 slices may be a little generous depending on the size of you eggs.

Yum - I just wanted a basic recipe and this was just like mom made!  I then topped it off with homemade peach syrup and a sweet cream cheese dollop.  My boyfriend said they were awesome - and he is very picky.  Perfecto!

Perfect! This is just the type of old fashioned french toast my Mom used to make for me. I used white sandwich bread and added vanilla creamer in place of the milk. It was a hit my kids loved it!! This will be my standard french toast recipe from now on.

Great easy recipe. Only want to say that the bread to egg ratio is a little optimistic. I ran out of batter two slices of bread early, and I was using fairly small slices of bread.

could never figure out why my mom's french toast never tasted like the restaurant now I know it was too much milk and not enough eggs. this was exactly what I was looking for a basic french toast recipe. I made it as written except I added about 1 tsp cinnamon and vanilla extract for my own taste. recipe was delicious and I'll make it again.

This tasted just like my granny use to make when I was a kid. Don’t change a thing about this recipe. It’s just plain simple homemade southern comfort food at its best!

At first I was cautious of the heavy egg to milk ratio. It has been a saga for me, searching and shifting through many recipes to find the perfect ratio. This one happily surprised me! I used thick slices of challah bread that was quite dry and some croissants that were well on there way to being old and dead. This brought them back to life in an amazing way! Pillowy and rich, these slices of goodness made a wonderful Saturday morning treat. I also added some vanilla so sweeten the deal...

I made this using the recipe. However I used raisin bread instead of regular bread. It is so delicious!  Sorry no pictures. Ate it too fast!

I only had 5 pieces of bread, I used a brioche loaf, and so instead of 4 eggs I used three. I wanted it a little creamier so I did 3 tablespoons of milk and added a 1/2 tsp of vanilla. They were perfect! I just wanted a classic french toast and this was a great foundation.

Yum! We use this recipe as a base and add to it seasonal things (eggnog in winter :) subtle but yummy). We also add a splash of vanilla. After the first few pieces I start dusting them with cinnamon individually since the first few get the most.

I was looking for a recipe for French toast the way mamma used to make.  I think I found it!  I used Pepperidge Farm Cinnamon Swirl Bread and added 2 tsp. cinnamon (we like cinnamon) to the eggs & whole milk - Yep!  Just like mamma used to make.  However, wish I had read these reviews first. Would have added the nutmeg and vanilla' too. That sounds like it would make it even tastier.

Good basic recipe. Quick, clean, and simple. I added nutmeg and vanilla extract in equal portions to the cinnamon. Used french bread. Finished with butter and maple syrup.

It was very good! I used 3 eggs,4 slices of 100% whole wheat bread, and unsweetened original almond coconut blend milk. I also added some powdered sugar on top and had some meatless sausage on the side.

I made this recipe AS WRITTEN (my pet peeve is people who make changes and rate the recipe based on the changes) even though I was surprised there was no vanilla in it.  I would give it 5 stars for being quick and easy to make.  I used French bread and cut the slices about 1" thick.  I used 4 regular slices plus the little "toe" end.  There is some of the egg mix left--probably enough for 2-3 more slices.  Taste was decent--could taste the cinnamon but it wasn't overpowering.  I would possibly make this again but add some vanilla.

This was just ok without the addition of nutmeg, vanilla and salt.  Nutmeg always goes with cinnamon.  I've been making it this way for years, but always add the nutmeg, salt and vanilla.

Came out perfect! I did add a dash of vanilla and used 6 slices of bread instead of 8. The bread was a honey wheat and at its expiration. That really helped absorb the egg mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

Its average.  I use flavored creamers such as hazelnut, French vanilla or my favorite butter pecan instead of milk.  I serve two slices .  I spread cream cheese on one side and strawberry spread 100% fruit.

Great recipe! Made delicious French Toast for my family. However, if you are making 8 pieces, I would recommend using an extra egg or two because I fell short and had to make more batter in order to make 8 pieces.

This is great traditional French toast recipe.  Fancy isn't always the best and I like that the ingredients are always on hand. I did as everyone suggested an added vanilla and upped the cinnamon.  This is always my go-to recipe.

This recipe had too much egg and not enough liquid for the amount of bread, I thought. I ended up adding some oj for flavour as well as to dilute the egg some, but a couple of my pieces of French toast still came out with a scrambled egg look to it.

This is a very classic French toast. I used Sara Lee Artisano bread and scaled the recipe down to 1 serving. Still enough to make 2 slices of this thick bread. An extremely filling breakfast.

I added chocolate. For just one serving I used 3 eggs and two large pieces of dense multi-grain bread, and fried them in a bit of vegetable oil...when each side was done I shaved dark chocolate on each side...and it tasted JUST LIKE A chocolate croissant.....spectacular

This was lovely. I only have a few other options to add. I always add vanilla, as well as cinnamon. Also, challah bread in thick slices  is delicious, though it needs to soak  in the mixture a bit longer. Also, grocery store raisin bread works well and is also delicious.

This recipe helped me remember key ingredients. I also added a splash of vanilla. I used the bakery French bread we bought fresh from the grocery store for last night's  BBQ dinner. Its crispy crust and soft center made for delicious French toast. I also warmed some all fruit strawberry spread. I sat out warmed syrup, the strawberry spread, powdered sugar and butter for the family to choose from for toppings. Needless to say, there is no French bread left.

Someone said that this recipe was too simple. Simple is not necessarily bad. When I want to make a quick treat for my family for brunch, I don't want to waste half the morning mixing up batter. Four simple ingredients that make a tasty entrée that any hungry group would love to eat. So if you're looking for a time efficient recipe to feed your small army, you've found the right one. Makes 6, but if you need more, I recommend doubling the recipe.

I decided at last minute to make this before I left for church, and it turned out AMAZING! It was quite delicious and it was gone in minutes! If I had one thing I would change, I would add a little bit more cinnamon, but it was a great recipe! Thanks for posting this recipe!                                                              -Hannah :)

This is how I've always made my french toast aswell, if you make sure the pan is nice and hot, the outside should be crispy and the middle soft.  Sometimes I even add a little nutmeg.

Best french toast I've ever made.  I doubled the recipe and used a whole loaf of Texas Toast bread.  I also added vanilla extract like others suggested.

This is a very tasty recipe. It's simple and straight to the point. Nothing fancy, just delicious. I made mine with sour dough bread and a bit of vanilla extract for added flavor. It's quick to make and breakfast is done within 10 mins. This one is a keeper, for sure.

Yumm! Turned out nice and fluffy...perfect texture! Reminds of french toast my dad made for my brothers and I as a child :) My kids loved it too...they had fun making as well! We added 1/2 teaspoon of VANILLA...probably could have used another 1/4 teaspoon (we love vanilla)!

Used with thick whole grain spelt bread, this recipe really held up to it... delicious. There wasn't enough batter to coat 6 big slices, so next time I'll double the recipe.
