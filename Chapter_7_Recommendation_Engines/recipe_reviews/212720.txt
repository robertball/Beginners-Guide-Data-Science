Faster version of Butter Chicken. One could use about 2 ts of Garam Masala as well instead of the cardamom pods cloves cinnamon to make it less work. I used cream but next time I will use Greek style Yogurt for a creamier texture. Did not have Serrano peppers so used hot Sriracha paste and also used Ghee instead of regular butter. I simmered this for about 30 minutes. Also sauted half an onion. (A note about the ingredients: calls for fenugreek 'leaves' but the directions refer to fenugreek 'seeds'?? I used seeds but did grind them a bit) Will make again.

Takes a bit of time to make but once you put it on the plate it will all be worth it. The family loved it!

An Indian lady who served lunch at my office got me hooked. But she'd make it infrequently. Then I left the job never to have again. Found this recipe tried it and it was AWESOME!!!!

This was really tasty! Just a note. Be sure to fully pur√©e the tomatoes so there are no chunks before cooking. That helps the cream and butter flavors blend better. Also I doubled the butter since it didn t taste like what I usually have without doing that. I will definitely make this again!

So good. I added more butter and cocked my chicken in butter. I also added chicken stick instead of water. Great recipe

A little bit time consuming but I like the way it cooks together without ground spices in the sauce. Removing the spice bundle seems to result in the best butter chicken.
