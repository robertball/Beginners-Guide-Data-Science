It was delicious!  I left out the food coloring, but other than that, I followed the directions exactly.  Will try it on company now.

Excellent taste.  First time I have made ribs and these came out excellent!  I followed the recipe down to the letter including using the red food coloring.  

I like salty so when I make it next time I will put a little more soy sauce.  Also I will puncture the ribs with a fork before marinating them to absorb more flavor.  I will let them marinade at least 3 hours.  This is important because as the ribs cook, the sauce drips down into the pan of water so it is wise to saturate the ribs and maybe basting every 15 minutes may not be a bad idea.  But I dont want to be bothered,  so I think the steps above will improve the recipe to give more flavor on the inside. 

These ribs where fall of the bone and succulent but I like mine a little crispier and burnt a little which is why I advise after the hour in the oven is done I would turn up the heat in the oven and let 'em roast an extra 5-10 minutes to make the outsides more crispy.

Must also say that the leftovers taste even better than the fresh batch.  

The leftovers that sat overnight in the fridge had even more flavor the next afternoon when I microwaved them.  

I made them with the chinese chicken fried rice recipe from allrecipes.com and got many compliments.  

A+++++

I just made these ribs and everyone went wild!  What a fantastic recipe.  I didn't cook them on a broiler pan with the water.  I put them single layer on a cookie sheet and baked them at 350 degrees on convection roast.  I changed the foil on the cookie sheet and then basted them with some fresh marinade I made.  Put them back in on convection roast for another 5 minutes and basted them one more time.  I also sprinkled some sesame seeds on top.  Finger licking good!!  This recipe is a keeper.  I also served it with the Vegetable Lo Mein recipe I got off of allrecipes.com.  Great dinner!!!!  Thanks!!!

These were delicious and did taste like Chinese style spareribs.  I was only cooking one rack of baby back ribs (about 2 lbs.)but made the sauce for 4 lbs. of ribs. I did not change one thing in the recipe except for the cooking time.  I cook ribs constantly in the oven and I know that mine would not have been done in 1 hour at 300 unless I had parboiled them first.  I ended up cooking them for 2 hours and basting them every 30 minutes for the first hour and then every 15 minutes for the 2nd hour - which explains why I used up all the sauce.  I broiled them for 3 minutes before I took them out which gave them that nice charred flavor and look that you get in the restaurant.  This was easy and I will be making this again.  Thanks submitter.

I omitted the food coloring.  The flavor was wonderful.  I finished off the ribs by putting them under the broiler for about four minutes on each side.  The only thing I'd do different next time is roast them longer so that the meat comes off the bone easier. This was a family pleaser!

I loved this recipe, easy and good.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I cheated on the recipe alittle...I didn't have cranberry sauce, so I used duck sauce.  It was just like the chinese ribs...thanks

Just like Chinese restaurant ribs - broiled them for a couple minutes at the end. Perfect. Definitely a keeper.

When I found this recipe I knew right away that I had to try it. I went to the store to buy all of the ingredients I didn't have on hand and used substitues for whatever I couldn't find in the store. I used Bragg's Liquid Aminos instead of normal soy sauce, a half and half blend of regular salt and garlic powder instead of garlic salt, and because my local grocery didn't have any cooking wine I used some flat 7Up (

I just finished licking the sauce off my fingers after polishing off a bunch of these. Fantastic! These were better than some of the takeout places around here! I can't think of anything to change in this recipe. I will be making this one often.

These ribs are incredible! I marinated the ribs overnight and boiled the leftover marinade before using it to baste. I only added 1 step: I turned one more time, basted again, and put them under the broiler for just a minute to crisp the meaty side a bit more.

these were good.  My ribs were "fatty" so they didnt turn out as good as the ones I get at the chinese restaurant.  But the flavor was the same and they were very easy to make.

These ribs are awesome.  I often eat in Chinese restaurants, so I've had plenty of the ribs prepared with this style.  This recipe very closely approximates and in some cases betters the ribs I've had in these restaurants.  I did make a mistake.  I mixed two cups of water with the marinade.  After realizing my mistake, I mixed another batch of sauce and finished the recipe as written.  I imagine these will only get better when I prepare them next time since the marinade will be more concentrated.  These ribs are highly recommended.

This was good but not the restaurant style Chinese ribs I was looking for.  I think the ribs need more seasoning.  Thanks JRIVIERA77 for sharing the recipe.

Not only is this sauce good on spareribs but on chicken wings as well. My kids love it. We have made it so many times already and will make it many more times.

I didn't have any 5-spice powder so I added a bit of cinnamon, cloves, ginger and alspice.  I have a feeling it made the dish sweeter than originally intended, but it was still very good.

Over all a very good recipe. I followed the sauce recipe exactly but cut the ribs and steamed them in a steamer pot for 20 minutes to de-fat them as I usually do, then baked them in the sauce for 1.5 hours. The family loved it but I felt it was a little off mark. Next time I'll substitute 1/4 cup brown sugar for the the honey, double the 5 spices and add some ground ginger.

I made these for new years party and they were great. I didn't use the 5 spice powder cause my supermarket didn't carry it. Also I used red instead of white wine and regular cranberry suace instead of jelled. First they smelled just like the restaurant then they tasted the same.  So good, everyone pigged out on them.

I don't know how they make them by you, but these were EXACTLY like the Chinese restaurants in Atlanta.  They were sooo good!  I used baby back ribs and followed the recipe exactly.  I marinated them for about 2 hours and cooked them for an hour.  I then boiled the marinade and brushed it on before serving.  Everyone loved them, thank you!

We absolutely love this recipe! I do change the method though and it turns out tender and delicous. I mix together all of the sauce ingredients, put the ribs into a crock pot and pour the sauce over the ribs. Then I cook the ribs for 6-8 hours on low ( I suppose you could cook them for 3-4 hours on high if you needed to) and occasionally spoon the sauce over the ribs if I get a chance and turn the ribs. If I don't get a chance to turn the ribs or baste them they still turn out great. We love this recipe with rice and the 'ginger veggie stir fry' recipe on this site which is very versatile. Thanks for a great recipe JRivera77!

These were quite good but not as good as I'd expected based on the previous reviews.  I followed the directions to the letter only adding to the cooking time like several people suggested, oh and I also marinated the ribs all day too.   I think next time, I will try this with boneless ribs or babyback ribs if I can get them on sale.  But the taste is extremely close to restaurant Chinese spareribs.

These ribs were EXCELLENT.  Exactly, if not better than take out. Followed recipe ingredients, used a bit more since I had larger ribs. I also cut my ribs in half to make them more like appetizers. I took the advice of others. Marinated overnight in a zip-lock bag. Slow boiled the extra marinade (on low) before basting.  I turned the ribs a few extra times than suggested and cooked a bit longer. Turned out delicious and just as good reheated the next day.  I also prepared a batch and put them in the freezer with the marinade.  Defrosted and baked another time, and they turned out perfect. What a time saver to have them on hand.  Thanks so much for this recipe.

Great flavor, but I based on other reviews I was expecting finger lickin' sauce.  I marinated them in the "stuff" for a few hours, having taken other reviewers suggestions and stabbing the meat all over with fork so it would infuse.  That definitely happened, but there wasn't any "sauciness".  Fixed that by heating the leftovers up the next day in the Rice Vinegar Basting Sauce also on this site.

I made this red food color and all, as written. It was perfect. It just so happened my husbands family was in town and came to our house on their way out of town. I added egg rolls a quick stir fry and the ribs. They were very impressed. It was strange how it all worked out. Now they think I'm this great cook.... If they only knew. Ha ha the ribs were great and another food adventure for me. Everyone remarked on the ribs. Will make again.

Wow!  So good!  I was confused with the recipe on cutting into 1 inch strips with bones in the spare ribs so I took the meat off the bones.  I laid them on a cookie sheet to cook.  Came out so good!  Just like the ones I like from the Chinese restaurants.   Paired it with a homemade chicken fried rice recipe I found too.  Quote from husband:"you can make that anytime!"  Thanks so much for this recipe...it's going in the book!!!

These ribs were pretty darn good. I might have used too much 5 spice but they were good!
