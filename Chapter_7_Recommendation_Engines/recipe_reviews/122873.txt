These were very good.  We love baked potatoes and it was nice to find a "twice-baked" recipe that isn't oozing with unnecessary cheese.   The touch of parmesan and other seasonings were all that was needed, although I did add some snipped chives.   I tried to take a shortut and pre-cook the potatoes in the microwave instead of baking - don't do that!  You need to bake them to get the skins crispy, otherwise they are flimsy and fall apart easily when trying to scoop out the potato.  Will definitely make these again!

FABULOUS RECIPE!  I have made this a few times now and it is always yummy.  I added more garlic to the recipe since we couldn't taste any garlic when made as the recipe indicated.  More garlic definately helped! I agree with the other posts that it's nice not having to use sour cream.  Easy dish and definately a favorite. Thanks!

These were awesome! I am glad to find a twice-baked potatoe recipe without sour cream or cream cheese. I used chedder because I didn't have any parmasean, but I think they would be even better with parmasean. I was looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch today, but when I got home they were already gone!

I love this recipe!  (I found that if you work it right, there's a little leftover filling to snack on when you're done stuffing.) I served them at a special dinner, and my guests loved them, too!   I did freeze a couple, but wasn't really pleased with them reheated...too dry.  So I don't recommend making extra especially for freezing.

This was excellent! The paprika on the top was a nice touch. The potatoe looked as good as it tasted!

I omitted the oregano, Parmesan cheese, and paprika because they were the main seasonings for my main dish, and I added a sprinkle of salt and parsley on each potato.  These were delicious!

These had a great flavor however were a little dry for my taste. Next time I will make the mixture a bit creamier. Will defiantly make again!

Thought these were pretty good. I had to find a potato without using sour cream.  I scaled the recipe for 6, and cooked one piece of bacon and crumbled it into the mixture.  I also added some shredded parmesan cheese to the mixture.  I personally didn't care for the powdery kind on top of the potato (even though I didn't use much) I'll use the shredded on top as well next time.  I loved these done in the oven rather than micro b/c of the crispy outside.

Sooo good! I omitted the oregano, because I'm not a fan.  Added extra garlic powder and a tiny bit more celery salt.  No cheese, but I did top them with smoked paprika instead of regular and green onions.  Served with steak and a green salad Yummy!

I always stayed away from making these...thought they would be to hard to make and to fattening.  Thank you for changing my mind on both of those past ideas!  I am making these tonight as a matter of fact.  LOVE them!

Easy, and really, really good.  You can add any kind of modification like green onions and with the spices.  My husband and I made these on Christmas day and I made them again last night.

these were deemed "just okay" by my family.  My son wants me to try another recipe. I like the oregano and cayenne combo, but still wasn't happy with the overall flavor. Thanks anyway!

This is a good basic recipe and leaves room for your own preferences.  I added sour cream along with a little more milk.  Also sauteed a cup of onions and 1 Tbs. minced garlic. Skipped the cayenne and celery salt.  The oregano is a must.  Accidentally left it out the first time and potatoes were not nearly as tasty.  I topped with cheddar rather than Parmesan.

I made these for dinner tonight and they were wonderful.  My family loves twiced baked potatoes, but I always thought they would be hard to fix or too time consuming.  Not the case at all with this recipe.  I made them exactly as the recipe reads except I used shredded Cheddar Cheese instead of the Paremesan Cheese. I plan to make these for our Easter Dinner for the entire family.

I followed this recipe yesterday for Christmas dinner. The potatoes were excellent- very flavorful. The only change I made was to sprinkle the potatoes with shredded Cheddar instead of Parmesan.

These weren't bad, mostly like mashed potatoes with just a little extra flavor, I may add parmesan cheese to the mixture next time for more flavor within.

Wow!  These potatoes were great.  I enjoy twice baked potatoes but I feel like the cheddar/sour cream recipes are predictable.  I wanted something lighter so I made these and my family loved them.  One change I made was to add grated parmesan to the filling instead of just on top.  I didn't add a lot but it was really great.  Thanks for a great recipe - I'll be making these again.

So good. I get so bored with regular baked potatoes. This recipe is better if you bake them in the oven first, however in a pinch I tried it with microwaved potatoes and they we're still great.
