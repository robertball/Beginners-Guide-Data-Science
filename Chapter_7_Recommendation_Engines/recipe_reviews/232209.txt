Wonderful easy dinner for the health conscience (flank steak has little fat).  I was marinating my flank steak (mixture of Paul Newman's lite balsamic and Wishbone's Italian dressing) when I saw this recipe and changed directions.  I used the first batch of cherry tomatoes (red and gold) from the garden and boy were they ever so good!  Served over whole leaf romaine as it holds up better instead of the butter lettuce and added croutons for a little crunch.  HELPFUL HINT:  To kick up the flavor, try adding and reducing balsamic vinegar. To reduce your vinegar, pour into a small saucepan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat constantly stirring to prevent scorching the vinegar. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer until the vinegar has reduced by half. Set aside, and cool to room temperature. When ready to serve, drizzle over the greens in place of the olive oil and balsamic vinegar the recipe calls for. NOTE: the vinegar will naturally sweeten as it reduces and will keep for months properly stored. Served with Prosciutto e Melone from AR as a starter.  Thank you cookinmama, this one's a keeper!

Ideal healthy summertime meal, especially when it's hot. Easy enough to make and tastes great. I however used another marinade for the flank steak (not that there is anything wrong with the one noted for the recipe) and used a Spring Mix that I added Butter Lettuce to because my store does not carry a Butter Lettuce Mix. Light and filling without leaving you stuffed. (recipe made for *RECIPE GROUP*).

Recipe Group Selection:  13, July 2013 ~ Flank steak is the one cut of steak that I do enjoy, and this was a good recipe to use it on.  I marinated the steak over night, so it was well seasoned when it was time to grill.  I mixed up the olive oil, tomatoes, mozzarella, basil, garlic and onion (I added those) in the morning so that the flavors would be well blended.  I did use a mixture of romaine and spinach leaves as that is what I had on hand.  This was very quick to pull together and made for a nice filling meal on a hot summer day.  The grilling time of 5 minutes per side at medium-high temps produced a perfect 140° steak.  I served this salad with ‘Unbelievable Grilled Garlic Bread’ from AR and we had a delicious meal.

Fabulous! A perfect summer meal that's light, easy to make and tastes great without a ton of effort. I didn't bother refrigerating the caprese salad and made that last while the meat was grilling. I lightly scored the steak on both sides and cut it into four individual steaks to make grilling it a bit easier. I put the steak into a ziploc bag along with the olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper with just a splash or two of white wine vinegar and let it marinate for a couple of hours. I served the steak along side the lettuce and caprese salad with "Linda's Best Ever Garlic Bread" from this site. The only thing left was to open a nice bottle of wine and enjoy!

This salad recipe was very good.  I added a few items to the salad:  sliced, fire-roasted, red peppers; 1/2 of a purple onion, finely diced; and bottled balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  It turned out great and there were no leftovers.  I used a different steak marinade as I prefer my flank steak to marinate for a minimum of 8 hours so I can't comment on the meat portion.  The salad part was fantastic, with the modifications.  Thanks!

This is my go-to recipe for a tasty, filling lunch this summer. We use Ginger Honey Vinegar! I look forward to it when it's on the menu for the week - which is usually 2 times each week!

This was fabulous! I did not have flank steak, so substituted flat iron steak. My husband hates tomatoes but he literally cleaned his plate! Thanks for sharing!

I was really disappointed with the marinade and toughness of the steak. I marinated it for a good 6 hours but the marinade does not have enough liquid. I even used tenderized flank steak. I would suggest using a different juicier marinade.

Genius idea for a salad! I made a few changes: I used sirloin steak instead of skirt steak, and added balsamic vinegar to the oil and garlic and let it marinade for a few hours. I also made a balsamic reduction (balsamic and honey) to drizzle on top instead of vinegar and oil. My family raved about this, they wouldn't stop eating until there was nothing left to eat. Super good recipe!

Recipe Group 7/13/13. Very light and refreshing salad. The tomato mixture with the basil was delicious. Garlic was not overpowering. And the balsamic dressing was just enough with the EVOO to not need any other additional dressing. I will make this again.

Very good. I did change it a little on what I put in the bag :

1. 2 cloves of garlic
2. Trader joe's balsamic glaze (good squeeze so that you can coat the meat, about 2tbs)
3. Hand full of Cilantro 
4. About 3 - 4 tbs of olive oil
5. 3 1/4lb london boil, could not find flank steak today.

A good, quick weekday dinner for my family!  Used ingredients as written. The only difference was my cook time. I have a wood burning grill so I let it smoke for about 8 minutes on each side then seared it on the stove in a cast iron skillet. Will definitely add this one to the rotation!

The only thing I did was kept the Balsamic out, I personally don't like dressings on my salad, me and my wife LOVED it, and already planned to make it for one of our family BBQs!

My Husband and I both really enjoyed this.  I prepared the salad as written except for one personal preference.  I enjoy a bit of honey with balsamic and oil. The recipe worked well for us and will be a favorite in our rotation.  It was wonderful!

made it and loved it - as did hubby &  daughter.  I didn't have time to marinate the flank steak (you'll definitely want to do that as flank steak can be a little tough), but it is a perfect dinner for a hot summer night.

Only changes were 1/8 tsp each of garlic powder and onion powder in the dressing only because it seemed like such a simple recipe that it might need it. I did substitute a grilled bone-in rib eye since it was on sale for $4.77/lb. versus $6.99/lb. for flank steak. Basil and tomatoes fresh from the garden. Very easy, simple recipe and will make it again.
Side dish was orzo with tomatoes, feta, and green onion salad that I make several times a year. Not a recommended pairing, just had it leftover from the day before.

I think the only thing I would change is the lettuce. Butter lettuce is pretty "soft" and doesn't really stand up to the rest of the ingredients. Next time, romaine.

GOOD EASY I love this light salad with a meal,  any meal.
I use with brunch egg recipes or light suppers. I have used 
goat cheese at times and love.

It did not have enough spice or pizazz for us.   Maybe a different marinade?    Some additional salt?    I would make it again, but just change up the marinade and seasoning.

Didn't have basil, but had sweet pepper, so used that. Also just used left over steak, season with salt and pepper only, that I heated lightly on high heat.  It turned out great. Can't wait to make this again.

I wasn't that impressed with this meal. There wasn't enough marinade for the steak and I found it a bit tough. It's fine if you like semi-tough meat and not a steak that's completely marinated. If you were to make this meal and not like tough meat, try making an increased amount of marinade and cook the steak a bit less on higher heat.

Is it me or does this recipe not indicate marinating the flank steak?  All the reviewers seemed to have done it.  I marinated for about 4 hours because I was confused.  :-).  Turned out very good.  I will make some adjustments.  Stronger marinade and longer.  Will add some heat. More mozzarella per serving. Other than that...pretty darn good.

Pretty tasty and easy! Used flat iron steak, but I do think the meat needs to marinate for awhile.
