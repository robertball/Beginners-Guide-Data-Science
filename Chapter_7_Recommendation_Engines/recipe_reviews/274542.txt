Yummy!  I realized too late that I only had 2 orange bell peppers so I added a medium summer squash sliced like the zucchini to round things out.  I used Italian seasoning rather than oregano and added some garlic too.  Delicious!  I used hot Italian sausage and sliced each link into thirds before browning it.
