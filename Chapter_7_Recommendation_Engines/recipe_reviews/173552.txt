Wow! This is excellent - and loved by 4 teenage boys, too. Got busy and ended up leaving my rosemary steeping for about 3 hours instead of 1 - which turned out fine. Tip: 1 largish baby 'seedless' watermelon makes almost exactly 12 cups of cubed melon - and you don't have to seed it. I'm sure fresh lemon juice would be best, but after squeezing forever to get 1 cup, I supplemented the rest with bottled lemon (I told you I need a citrus press, MisterByrd, take note). Tastes fantastic! A bit time consuming, but fun for every once in a while. Thanks!!

This was a nice lemonade. But next time I will squeeze juice from watermelon for the perfect lemonade texture.  Be sure to refregirate this lemonade a few hours or overnight before serving, it will be much better.

This was just OK in my opinion. I liked it better after it sat for a bit.  I could not detect any rosemary flavor at all, which is what I was interested in tasting.  All I really got was somewhat of a bitter taste from the lemons.  If you are not into tart flavor, add more sugar than called for. I was wishing I had added a bit more.  Don't think I would go out of my way to make this again, but it is a good way to use of a lot of watermelon quickly if you need to.

A very interesting change from the typical lemonade. Even my family (who don't typically welcome 'different' recipes) enjoyed this!

I LOVED this. It was so unique and refreshing and a bit floral. If it were just me, I'd give it 5 stars. However, I made it for a party, and only about half my guests liked it. So, I don't know if I'd make something this unique for a mixed crowd again. But, I will thoroughly enjoy the half pitcher that's left from the party.

Only one person out of 10 didn't like it! A little too bitter for me, but still good. I wish I had chilled the glasses, though.

Tastes great. A little labor intensive. But, well worth the work.

I loved this!  Only used enough watermelon to fill up the blender because I wanted a potent rosemary taste. Best drink I've had in a while.

I was so happy to find this as I've been craving it!  The recipe is amazing, I used a full cup of sugar and about 6 sprigs of rosemary. A little messy but totally yummy!

Not bad, a little too much rosemary taste but may be my fault too. I added some sierra mist and it made it a lot better.

This was loved by our family and friends! I used 4 sprigs of fresh rosemary from our garden, letting it steep overnight with 2 lemon peels after boiling, then drained off solids. I juiced two lemons instead of using 2 cups of juice. The steeped lemon peel has more vitamins that the concentrate. I used 3 blenders full of frozen and fresh watermelon and filled the rest of the pitcher up with water. My husband isn't a big fan of fruit in general, but said he would gladly drink his watermelon from now on! Thanks for the recipe! :o)

This is very delicious.  I used dried rosemary because I didn't have fresh.  So the rosemary taste isn't as strong.  But I am enjoying it very much.

I discovered this drink at lemonade as well. It was so delicious I requested my caterer to make it for my wedding reception. This recipe tastes pretty close to when I first had it at the store! I added a couple extra sprigs of rosemary for a heavier flavor, and substituted 2 cups of store bought natural lemonade with juice from two squeezed lemons to speed up the recipe. 5 stars, thank you for the recipe!

I made this for a Labor Day cook out and it was a big hit. Super yummy and not too sweet. Just how I like it.
