Everyone in my family liked this which usually doesn't happen.  I have also make it with chicken broth and chicken breasts.

I liked this recipe.  It was very "different".  I bought cream-style corn by accident and think this made it even better, because it made the mixure a little creamier.  I gave a low "kid rating" because of the cilantro.  I don't think you could successfully eliminate the cilantro because it would be too bland.

This was very easy to make and turned out to be quite flavorful.  My boyfriend and I had never had orzo and we both enjoyed it.  My boyfriend said that this meal was the most flavorful meal that I have made thus far.  (I have only made him about 10 meals so far though!)  He did suggest that I flavor the meat next time with garlic.  Overall, easy to make and a nice change of pace.

I used a premixed rissoto which had sundried tomato spices instead of the orzo. I left out the corn and added spinach in w/ the cilantro. I had left over steak that I just cut into tiny pieces. I also added the leftover stuff that we had leftover from the fajitas we ordered the other night at a Mexican restaurant. This is a good recipe to get rid of all of your leftovers and everyone really enjoyed it! Thanks for the recipe.

I've discovered I'm not fond of Cilantro :-)

The pasta amount is too much for the beef.  I will reduce the orzo by 1/2, it really plumps up.  I beleive I will also double the beef amount.  I added about 1/2 cup chopped onion to the beef mixture.  I added 1/2 tsp. garlic powder, and kidney beans to the pasta mixture.  Next time I believe I will add 1/2 cup of salsa to the meat mixture just before serving.  Rice can easily be substituted.

This was a pretty mediocre dish.  It was kind of like a bland fajita running into a box of rice-a-roni.  My husband didn't like it at all - the cilantro frightened him.  I kept some and ate it for lunch the next day...it was better, but still not incredibly impressive.
