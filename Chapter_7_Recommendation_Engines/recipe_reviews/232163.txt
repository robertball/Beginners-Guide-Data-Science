3.27.18  I like granola on my morning yogurt, and this was tasty.  Doesnâ€™t say what kind of almonds to use (whole, slivers, sliced), but I used the slivers, and probably will try with pecans the next time.  For the dried fruit, I used a combo of cranberries, cherries, and apricots.  I wanted to be sure that the chocolate chips melted a bit, so I mixed them in after cooling the granola for 10 minutes, rather than 20 minutes.  Thanks for sharing your recipe.
