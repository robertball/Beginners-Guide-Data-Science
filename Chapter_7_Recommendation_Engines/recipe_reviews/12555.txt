This makes a very yummy cherry pie.  I've made it twice now - once with frozen cherries and once with fresh.  Both turned out great.  Instead of using a pie crust on top, I used a streusel topping like you would use on top of a crisp or crumnle.  Wonderful served with vanilla ice cream.

Dried cherries were hard to find, but the search was well-rewarded--this pie is excellent!  The almond extract makes it not-your-ordinary pie.  The only drawback is that the pie didn't hold together very well when cut...perhaps I should have let it cool, but the troops were clamoring!  A great Thanksgiving pie alternative!

The store was out of frozen cherries so I substituted canned pitted tart cherries packed in water, which I drained. I also added lemon juice and used the Pillsbury pie crusts because I was in a hurry. This was an excellent pie and so easy. We served it with Breyer's vanilla bean ice cream and had no leftovers. I'll definitely make this again!

I've made this recipe three times and all attempts have been flawless and delicious!  Some observations:  when the filling ingredients are initially blended together, the sugar/tapioca will tend to stay white, dry and separate from the cherries.  You'll need to let the cherries thaw some to juice up and soak into the sugar mix.  That way, the sugar and tapioca will cling better with the cherries and distribute evenly once spooned into the pie dish. And don't skimp on the 15 minutes rest time because the tapioca needs to soak in the juices before baking.  And last, to cut waste I just used 2-12 oz bags of frozen cherries and 1-6oz bag of dried cherries (to avoid leftover ingredients), which brought the volume a little higher than the recipe called for, but it still easily fit into my pyrex pie dish.  This addition didn't make the pie runny either...thank goodness!  :)

Generally speaking I don't care for cherry pie.  But this one is different...and I think I ended up eating at least half of it.  I used 4 cans of cherries a couple of different kinds and some extra dried cherries.  I also used a little extra tapioca because I donâ€™t care for a runny pie.  I'm making again for Christmas but may soak the dried cherries in brandy overnight for an extra special treat.  Make sure you put a pan under this while its baking...it's messier than most pies I've made.  But oh so worth it!  Thanks for sharing.

My boyfriend's mom has made this recipe for a few dinner parties and it is always a hit!  The dried cherries give it the perfect tartness.

This is excellent!  An easy pie that tastes like you worked all day.  A good combination of sweet and sour.

I agree that this is a perfect combination of sweet and sour. I made mine the night before and had no problems with it being runny. I may have added a few more cherries, since I eyeballed it and was filling up a deep dish pie plate, but it came out great and I didn't change anything else. I buy the dried cherries in bulk and this is a great way to use them up! I love the texture they give to this pie!

I'm sorry, but I did not like this recipe. I used both the frozen and dried cherries, followed the recipe including standing time for 15 minutes.  Once completed, I did not like the consistency of the filling.  Maybe it was the type of frozen cherries...who knows.

I had no problem finding the dried cherries.  But the first time I made this I thought it needed alittle more sweetness. The second time I dusted the top with the nutmeg but also with white sugar and a dash of cinnamon. Combined with a crumble top.  It was perfect! My future in-laws asked me to make again.

Really good flavor. However, the pie got really runny after the second day. Too much juice!

Awesome!  Great presentation and flavor.  I used 30oz of sweet frozen cherries and 2 cups dried tart cherries.  Next time I am going to try making a crumble topping to reduce the amount of crust.

Couldn't be easier to make. A little to sugary for my liking but it was very tasty, liked the use of the dried cherries. I split the 4 cups of frozen cherries into 2 c. cherries 2 c. blueberries
took a little less than an hour to bake so make sure to keep an eye on it
