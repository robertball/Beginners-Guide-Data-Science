The flavor is great! The method however needs some tweaking. Carrots take much longer to soften than a couple of mins. I suggest sauteing them on med-low heat for at least 6-8 mins on their own before adding the scallions and garlic. Then add the broth and simmer for 5-6 mins before adding the orzo, and continue simmering til orzo is done.  Finally, add the spinach and stir til softened.  Tip: if you are making the soup ahead of time, undercook the orzo slightly.  Makes a nice, healthy lunch! So yummy! I'm definitely  making this again!

Good, fast, easy and low in calories.  I used fresh spinach, increased the carrots and added about 1 tsp. of sugar, 1/2 tsp. of vinegar and 1/4 tsp. of thyme leaves.  Will make again for sure.

I used rotini noodles instead of orzo and vegetable broth instead of chicken broth. It's a quick to make, great tasting, healthy meal! My husband and I love it!

I like it because it is easy and healthy to make.  Like one of the reviewers said, the carrots and orzo takes longer to cook.  I only made one change, I added shredded chicken to make it more filling.
