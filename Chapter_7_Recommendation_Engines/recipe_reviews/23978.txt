I first made and reviewed this in January 2007, and I have made many, many times since.  It is our absolute favorite meatball and sauce recipe.  However...I do not like this made with tomato sauce, and I also bake my meatballs for a few minutes to brown rather than fry.  I use crushed or ground tomatoes, and I always add chopped onion.  Sometimes I add chopped roasted red peppers or carrots for a little sweetness if my tomatoes are particuarly acidic.  Leftover sauce, makes a great pizza sauce.  We used it on the Brick-oven pizza from this site (another favorite of ours), and it's wonderful--try adding thin slices of the meatballs to the pizza  before popping in the oven--fabulous!  We sometimes double the meatball recipe and make meatball sandwiches.  It's also fantastic in lasagna.  We love this sauce and the meatballs, too.

I really love these meatballs, although I don't make them exactly as the recipe says. Since I'm only cooking for two, I only use 1 lb of ground beef and omit the pork all together. I use 1/3 cup each of bread crumbs/parmesan cheese. This makes plenty for 2. I follow the recipe for the tomato sauce exactly, and it always comes out great. I've made this recipe many times. I've served it over pasta, I've tweaked the recipe slightly to make it a "sweet and sour" meatball dish, and I've also made meatball subs out of it (french loaf cut in half with the middle scooped out, toasted under the broiler until just a little "crunchy", then slice the meatballs in half and lay on the bread, spoon a little sauce over all, add mozzarella cheese on top, stick back under the broiler until melted and viola!). Really versatile, tasty recipe that I will continue to use. Thank you for sharing!

I used this recipe for the meatballs only and made the Best Marinara Sauce Yet to go along with them.  They turned out really tasty.  I used all ground pork and 1 large link of hot italian sausage.  (Hubby used all of the ground beef the night before in his burgers)!  I also added some grated Romano cheese along with the parmesan and a dash of salt and pepper. I baked my meatballs at 350 for about half and hour rather than pan-frying them.  I was able to drain off quite a bit of oil. I let them simmer in the sauce for a while and they gave off a real "meaty" taste which we all enjoyed.  Thanks Joiamia, this was good.

Pretty good.  Substituted a can of crushed for the sauce. Added a splash of red wine.  I prefer using stale baguette buzzed in the blender then soaked in a little half and half instead of boxed bread crumbs.  Also you needn't cook the meatballs in the fry pan, they can gently simmer in the sauce and their texture will be much softer.  Don't leave the pork out of the meatballs! Mangia

I have been searching for a recipe to resemble make my husband's Sicilian grandmother's homemade sauce, and this is the closest I have come! Alleluia! If you are used to American spaghetti sauce, this is not it. This is the real deal Italian stuff from the homeland. I pretty much followed the recipe to a t, but made a few additions: half of cup heavy cream and a cup of parm to the sauce to try and cut back on the acidity (parm was a mistake, it became too salty, next time I'll try carrots). Followed the meat-a ball :) instructions exactly and added six links of hot Italian sausage. TIP: don't pre-cook the meatballs (or sausage), just gently add to sauce and stir occasionally. They'll cook during the four hour simmering and will come out perfectly. If you are looking for authentic Italian meatballs and gravy, look no more.

I've made this twice now and both times it was wonderful.  This is almost as good as my Italian Grandmother's recipe.

If you're looking for that authentic Italian taste you remember when you visited Italy...this is it.  It's easy and simple to make and there are tons of leftovers.  I made smaller sized meatballs and only used beef.  Still came out fabulous! Now thats a spicy meatball! Mmm...

Used all beef and made only half the meatballs - used minced garlic (and doubled the amount of garlic called for) and sauce was amazing.  Thanks so much for such a super easy WONDERFUL recipe.

I made this sauce, froze a portion of it and a week later made the Hall of Fame "American Lasagna" from this site.  Let me tell you....I've always been a good cook, but this was outrageous.  This sauce has body.  It has an attitude too....don't mess with it unless you're serious about your Italian food.  Really great.

I know everyone raves about this recipe, but it wasn't that great. It needs salt and some extra seasoning. And the meatballs were a bit bland.

The sauce was very bland and too think and acidic. By cooking it the prescribed 4 hours at the lowest possible temperature, the sauce stuck to the bottom of the pan because it was way too thick. Fortunately, the meatballs were very good. I ended up serving the meatballs with a jarred sauce that I keep on hand for emergencies. I can't understand the rave reviews. The meatballs were very good. The kids and grandkids loved them and leftovers were sent home with them, but forget the sauce!

Please keep looking for an authentic, delicious slow-cooked sauce - this isn't it.  It tasted like the sauce in a can of spaghettios.

OUTSTANDING!  I was so fortunate to spend 3 weeks travelling through Italy with the love of my life last summer that it actually brought tears to my eyes when i tasted this sauce!  Joiamia - I never made it to Sicily but your Nana has brought back so many memories of great italian home cooking to me - thank-you for those, and thank-you for this recipe.  I didn't change a thing and wont ever.  Thank you.

This was delicious and it makes a ton of sauce. I added a large chopped yellow onion, a tablespoon of red pepper flakes (adds a nice bit of subtle heat to the sauce), and a dash of oregano. And for the meatballs I added some black pepper and one egg. Very very good!

While this recipe was easy enough, I don't think it had much distinct flavor to it.  My husband thought the meatballs were a little too mushy and the sauce needed "something".  Maybe some red pepper flakes?  This will be a recipe to play with, though ... thanks!

I, too, was looking for something that tasted like my Nonnie's meatballs and sauce. Unfortunately, I never got her recipe. These meatballs are so good and the sauce is delicious. I always make more than we need and then freeze the extras for easy weeknight meals. There's no reason to use any other recipe than this one!

I made this for a holiday family get-together and heard only rave reviews!  I was short two cans of tomato paste, so the sauce was a little thinner than it was supposed to be.
The meatballs had great flavor!  (They didn't taste like balls of meat, but like wonderful italian meatballs.)
I plan to make this for a dinner party later in the month.  It is simple, inexpensive and absolutely delicious!

I have to give this recipe 5 stars because it is very, very delicious. I have been having a hard time getting my kids to eat tomato sauce because they hate onions and chunks of cooked tomato.I scaled it to 6 and followed the directions without adding or omitting anything. The secret is in the simmering!!! Italians are very patient that way. It was so nice to make a sauce that everyone loved from a recipe that had no bizarre ingredients (i.e. sugar, baking soda, I have seen it all) and NO dry Herbs- I used Hunt's tomato sauce. It was perfect! no additional salt, pepper, nothing! Thanks so much to Joiamia and her Nana. This sauce is going to be my new secret.

This recipe was fantastic! I have made it many times, always to rave reviews. I have also given this recipe to many friends, they have all loved it. The two changes I have made are; I doubled the amount of garlic and I use italian seasoned pork sausage instead of plain ground pork.

I did not realize that using regular tomato sauce and cooking it for a long time could taste so wonderful.  This is the first time I used pork in meatballs, and not the last.  The best meatballs my family has had!  I had to back to the store and buy more meat to make this recipe again.  The Best!

Very good but does anyone recall their grandmothers, aunts, moms, etc. "frying the tomato paste with the garlic in the olive oil" BEFORE adding the San Marzana crushed tomatoes (not tomato sauce) or Contadina crushed Italian tomatoes is another good one.  My mom also would crush the WHOLE italian plum tomatoes if she had to, by hand.......but I do recall the frying of the garlic in with the tomato paste.  When I began doing Italian genealogy, I could tell which were true family members by this particular habit, maybe just from the mountain region of Italy.....but they are all good recipes today.

My kids and I were looking for an authentic Italian dish after studying Italy.  This one was great.  We didn't vary from the recipe.  The meatballs were great with the combination of pork and beef.  It made a ton of sauce!  I think I would probably cut back on a little of the tomatoe sauce next time, but we will make these meatballs again!!

Very good. We are having the left-overs as meatball subs. The meatballs were a little dry to me. I might add an egg next time. Added quite a bit more garlic & Italian Seasonings. We liked it but didn't love it.

This sauce was delicious!  I added a carrot, chopped, to balance any acidic tang from the tomatoes (and used crushed tomatoes instead of tomato sauce), added one chopped onion and the whole family raved!  I didn't have ground pork on hand, so I used Jimmy Dean bulk sausage with the ground beef for the meatballs and they were great!  I will definately be making this recipe again----delicious and easy!

Grown ups love this, kids love this.  My italian husband said it was most like his grandmother's recipe.  Really simple sauce no chunks to prevent children or picky adults from eating.  Makes a mountain of meatballs and sauce.  Leftovers are awesome, will be trying some as suggested in lasagna today.

Good spaghetti and meatballs.  I did add a little chopped onion and red pepper flakes to the sauce.  I made a huge pot, and its almost all gone!

this sauce was not bad...a little plain but it did have a nice richness to it. i added extra garlic and put minced garlic in the meatballs...i noticed that i needed to really season this sauce...maybe next time i should add oregano.

This was the first time that I made spaghetti sauce.  My husbands family is italian, and they said the sauce was better than Grandmas.  It is easy and my family cannot get enough.

My wife's family is Sicilian, and reading the author's comments brought it directly to home.  The "secret business" was also in her family.  Instead of frying, I dropped the meatballs into the succo, and let the meat fats infuse the gravy.  One addition, add both hot and mild Italian sausage links into the gravy and cook along with the meatballs.  The combination of succo, sausage links and meatballs is hard to beat.

This is similar to my grandmothers recipe. She roasted a beef roast and simmered it in the sauce. She fried the meatballs and removed the roasted meat and put in the meatballs to simmer and she hard fried about 36 plus eggs and simmered them in the sauce while she made the pasta.  As a child this was my favorite meal she made.  All the platters of simmered roast, meatballs, fried egg  and huge bowl filled with spaghetti with the sauce over it was fantastic.  I loved the simmered fried eggs.  Now I am the only one in the family that makes it at family gatherings.  I will make it when my husband asks me to, he says it is THE BOMB!  All 7 of my grandchildren love it.  I guess it is time to pass on the recipe to one of them.

These meatballs are missing some flavor.  I would doctor the recipe to your tastebuds.  I made them exactly as the recipe states and they're bland.

This sauce was really good, however I do prefer a chunky spaghetti sauce. This one had a lot of flavor, and the meatballs were great (although I only used beef). I did add fresh, chopped mushrooms, I only wish I had added chopped onion and green pepper as I had intended. I served this with Easy Focaccia from this site.

I personally thought something was missing from the meatballs...not too much flavor.  My son loved this dish and so did my daughter.  I couldn't get a comment from my husband.  Not sure if I'll ever make again.  It did take some time and made a big mess on the stove.

I have to say that my family and I like this meatball recipe the best of all the ones I've tried on this site and I've tried a few, while they were really good, I think the texture of the meat was better since it used no eggs.  I also added onions but that is a personal preference for my family.  Thanks so much for the post.

A good basic that kids will like. A little on the bland side for adult taste. The ingredients are easy enough to come by so this could be included in a basic meal plan.

This was delicious!  We were drooling from the smell all day and when we finally sat down we were not dissapointed.  Rich and satisfying!  This will be my permanent spaghetti and meatballs recipe!  The meatballs were sooo good and I made a double batch to freeze some later for the most awesome meatball subs I've ever had!  I did add a little more fresh parsley and fresh basil from my garden but otherwise I wouldn't change a thing!
