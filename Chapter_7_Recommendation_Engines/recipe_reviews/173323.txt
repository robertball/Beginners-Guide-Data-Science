I found this recipe when I was looking for side dishes that I could eat while on the South Beach Diet. I have been making this for several months and even my two year old asks for second helpings.  Two things that make this a little easier are 1) If you don't have time to let the couscous chill for an hour, make it the night before and then mix it with the other ingredients the next day.  2)Either leave the cucumber out all together, or cut it up and add to individual salads. I find that the leftovers don't keep as well with the cucumber mixed in.

Love this recipe - made a few modifications - use salt only to taste - not amount in recipe - used 3/4 c olive oil & 3-1/2 T red wine vinegar - was out of Dijon, so used regular mustard and 3/4 t sugar to cut the tang down.  Also added 1 c carrots (matchstick size cut); 1 can garbanzo beans and cut back on feta cheese slightly.  Excellent summer dish - added extra fresh herbs from garden - definitely a keeper recipe - thanks so much - next time, going to try cooking cous cous with one can chicken broth instead of water for more flavor.  The cous cous called for in recipe is equivalent to one box.

This salad turned out great!  I didn't make any modifications to the recipe whatsoever.  I didn't care for the pine nuts and will leave those out the next time I make this salad. Thanks for passing this recipe along. It's a keeper.

I swapped the pine nuts for fresh tomato and marinated the tomato and cucumber in the vinegar, oil and mustard mixture while the couscous cooled.

This salad had a nutty taste that overpowered everything else. I love feta and the other flavors in the dressing but I couldn't taste them at all. There are better couscous recipes out there and I wouldn't try this again.

Has become a firm favourite with all of the family. As a side dish or as a bed for fish or chicken. I have added other things like sundried tomatoes, olives & capsicum. What ever you like really. The pine nuts make it though. I did reduce the amount of water to 1 1/2 cups as I found it to wet otherwise.

I LOVED this, but my husband wasn't so crazy about the dressing.  I really can't see why.  We both generally don't like mustard, but this was a perfect use of it.  I would make it again maybe for other people, but apparently not for home!

This has become one of my favourite recipes, especially in summer months.  I love to add in different ingredients to play with texture and colour.  I often replace the pine nuts with sunflower seeds, and I often add in garbanzo beans, tofu, or chicken pieces to add some extra protein and make it a rounded out meal.  I've also tried it with quinoa and pearl cous cous, but it's hard to beat the texture of regular cous cous.  Delicious recipe.

Very good. I'm always looking for new couscous recipes and we really enjoyed this one. I subbed Balsamic vinegar for the red wine b/c I didn't have any. Also decreased the OO to 1/4 cup and used whole wheat couscous to make this a bit healthier and subbed toasted almonds for the pine nuts (they are so expensive). Great recipe, thanks:)

EXCELLENT! Made as is, except for omitting the cucumbers (had none on hand) and only had dried parsley, so I used some of that. After mixing the dressing (which I just shook everything up in a mason jar) it tasted really salty and I was scared, but once everything was together it was fine. Great flavor! Will definately be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

Just made this for my husband to munch on while the kids and I are away and I am really disappointed.  I just don't care for the dressing at all--very salty.  If you try it, I would adjust the salt to taste.

This is good, very quick and easy. I ate it warm-ish because I didn't want to wait any more for it to chill. It was good warm-ish though. I did use walnuts instead of pine nuts because I had them on hand, and I used honey-dijon mustard because that's what was in my fridge. It worked out well, adding a touch of sweetness to the dressing. I also added more red wine vinegar as I prefer a slightly more even ratio of vinegar to oil in a dressing. I didn't have any cucumber, so skipped it. Tomato would be nice too. I would definitely make this again.

Made it for a 25 person dinner party. Everyone wanted leftovers the next day. If you want it to be incredible one do 1 teaspoon salt as the feta is salty. I also added lemon to cut the salt and honey to sweeten the dressing a bit.

This is a perfect summer BBQ side dish. Easy to make, tastes great. I could have eaten that alone, it was that good. Followed the recipe exactly except for the parsley (I hate the stuff). Might use balsamic instead of the red wine vinegar next time for just a tiny bit more of a kick. Loved the pine nuts in this! No problems with the dressing otherwise - I thought it was perfect (keep in mind the couscous is not seasoned at all).  Thought about marinating the cucumbers in the dressing while the couscous cooled - may try that next time. Rave reviews at our last BBQ!

The whole family loved it! It's a nice alternative to rice or potatoes with a grilled chicken or fish dish. I've even eaten it by itself as a lunch entree. Make sure you toast your pine nuts, otherwise they make the dish bitter.

Love this dish...so do my friends and the Hubster!  I have always left out the cucumber and instead added chopped sun dried tomatoes.  I have also added chicken a couple of times to make it more of a cold main dish.   Otherwise, no other changes to the original recipe.  Friends continue to mention it when I see them or want the recipe.  One friend tried it with quinoa, and liked it, but prefers the couscous.  Thanks for sharing!

I've made this every 4th of July for many years, but the salad dressing is optional. Just a bit of olive oil is sufficient (and vinegar and mustard are not great additions to this salad). Also, you can use a mix of herbs: parsley, basil, and mint from the garen.

Delicious! My picky husband even took seconds.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except that I cooked the couscous in chicken broth and used walnuts instead of pine nuts.  I also took someone's suggestion and marinaded the cucumber in the dressing while the couscous cooled.
