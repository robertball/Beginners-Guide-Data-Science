Easy to make, really nice side dish for curries and other spicy food.  I was surprised at how much my husband and I enjoyed it.

this is such a delicous side to have! It can go with almost anything, but is especially good with rice! I absolutely adore it!

Delicious, cool and easy to make.  I added more cucumbers and less yogurt but kept the seasonings the same and the dish was a hit.

This was perfect with our kababs and we made gyros with this. I shredded the cucumber with the small side of the cheese grater. I used greek yogurt, kosher salt and just a sprinkle or two of coarse ground black pepper. My son even said this is the best tzaiziki sauce so don't lose this recipe! (I can't spell it, you know the stuff I mean) I added about a half tsp of dried mint too since it was in the meat marinade. Thanks, we loved this!

Beautiful! I used less yogurt like many reviews said, but I have to say that I enjoyed it right away (couldn't wait, it looked sooooo good) more than later. But it was still darn good a couple days later over some fresh greens. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

This was okay.  I think it would taste better with mint instead of dill.

This recipe is refreshing.  It used a lot of yogurt than I liked.  So, I just used 6 ounces of yogurt instead of 32 ounces.  I also used 3 cucumbers instead of one just because I love eating them.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good with the caveat that I did not use anywhere near this much yogurt primarily because we would never use that much of the dressing.  I used about 10 ounces of it and halved both the garlic and dill keeping the cucumber the same.  Added kosher salt & ground pepper to my taste.  Served it with a lentils & rice dish and it was wonderful.  Perfect tang.

I thought it was too bland, but my mom seemed to like it (maybe because its healthy?) It may be that I didn't let it sit over night to infuse the flavors.  I might try it again and do that, but I'll probably just look for another recipe.

I used nonfat Greek Yogurt instead of plain, and added about 3 tbl of sour cream for more dimension. Added mint (in addition to dill), parley, ground cinnamon, ground ginger, paprika, a dash of lemon juice and used a cheese grater to have smaller cucumbers into the mixture. It was great! I incorporated all of these other flavors from another recipe I saw.. and it worked beautifully.  Ate it with some chicken kabobs and had it as a dressing for my salad. Super healthy and tastes so yummy!!

This was very good but the ratios are way off. 
To avoid getting a soupy dish I used 3 big cucumbers + about 15 oz plain yogurt and kept the seasonings the same (adjusting salt/ pepper of course). I also added fresh parsley from my garden and doubled dill and garlic. 
This made a kind of a cross between a chunky tzaziki and a cucumber salad which is enjoyable as a side to a spicy main dish, or as gyro garnish (depending on how small you chop your cucumbers.)

I used greek style yogurt, mint instead of dill (this is more authentic), and and handful of raisins (yes this sounds odd, but it's oh so good!).

I have this recipe from Persian relatives except that the recipe I am accustomed to has mint in it also.  It's easy to alter with more cucumber making it chunkier, or more yogurt and smaller chunks of yogurt so it's more of a sauce.  Play with it.  Just a spoonful on your plate to accompany grilled meats or fish is terrific.

Very easy to make! Very tasteful too! I may add more garlic, or dill, tweak it to my particular taste...but I make this over and over..in fact we are having it tonight with souvlaki kabobs! 
DO NOT use the vanilla flavored yogurt! I accidentally bought some this time, figured I'd try it..and wow, was it sweet! oops! Stick to the plain yogurt!
and I make this 2-3 days before we use it. the longer it sets, the more flavor!

Easy, fast, healthy, fresh! What's not to love!!! Fresh mint makes it a five star salad/dip.

Just like the restaurant.  This is one of the best dishes I've ever found: it takes under 10 minutes to prepare from common ingredients, and it knocks your taste-buds off (in only the best way).
