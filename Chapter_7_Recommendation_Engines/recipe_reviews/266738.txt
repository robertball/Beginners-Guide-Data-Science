After making traditional horchata and not loving the time consuming technique but loving the result, I tried this recipe. I couldn't tell any difference between this and the ground rice and almonds version! The only thing I did differently was two cinnamon sticks instead of five and I omitted the almond extract. It was absolutely perfect! I'll definitely stick to this, goodbye blender!

I made this for a big Mexican Fiesta.  I was a hit! Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe.  It was simple and so good.  I did not add the Almond extract but I followed the rest of the recipe.  I also quadrupled the recipe.  I made it 24 hours ahead of time.
