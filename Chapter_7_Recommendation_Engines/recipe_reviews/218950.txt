Out of dry bread crumbs at the moment, I used crushed garlic croutons instead. I made no other changes. GREAT meatballs. Excellent for meatball sandwiches.

Fabulous as is!!  I did make my meatballs bite size since that is how my family likes them.  At that size, I only cooked them 6 minutes and that seemed about right (less or more depending on if you like to see a little red or if you like crispy mearballs).  Thanks for a great recipe, my new "go to" recipe!

These were so good.  I forgot to put the bread crumbs in.  They were still really good, but fell apart when we reheated them.  Also made them much smaller

These were great and EASY!  I took others' suggestions and made mini meatballs about 1 1/2 inch diameter.  They were awesome and baked at 425 for 15 minutes (hot oven).  Thanks, Starr, these are ex-L-ent!

I made these for a Christmas party and they were delicious! I added a half pound of sausage because I had some to use up.  These will be my go-to homemade meatball from now on! Thanks Superstarr!

Starr's Savory Meatballs Haiku: "These were pretty good! Ate them with spaghetti squash. (I made mine smaller.)" I followed the recipe exactly as written, only making my meatballs smaller than indicated in the directions (bout ping-pong ball size.) Tried them right from the oven (tasty, but not mind-blowing - a good, basic meatball), then let them simmer in sauce for a little while b4 serving over a spaghetti squash. The whole family declared them wonderful, so we gotta give props to Starr for her easy meatball recipe.

I thought these were pretty good. I followed the recipe, I just used 93% lean beef and cut the black pepper amount in half. They were a little on the herby side, but I can see them working with a tomato or a beef sauce. They were huge, compared to what I expected. They were about 3" and after cooking were still about 2 1/2" sized meatballs. Mine needed to cook 35 min. be flipped and then have another 20 minutes more. I cut the onion kind of small, worried they wouldn't cook in time, but with the extra minutes that helped. They were good with best marinara sauce yet. I plan to try them with a gravy to. 2 are filling to me, especially if eaten with something else.

Good meatballs; used for subs.  I felt the portions were HUGE, double my typical portion anyhow, so I ended up freezing half.  I had even halved the recipe! I think you could get 8 servings if served in sandwiches or over spaghetti out of 2 lbs of ground meat. I used ground turkey and added more Worcestershire b/c I think it helps 'beef' up the flavor when using ground turkey in recipes calling for beef (I find it makes turkey less noticeable to the usual beef-eaters).  I made the meatballs a bit smaller than directed, and they were perfectly cooked after 15 minutes.  Good balance of the onion, garlic and spices.  Thank you!

Great meatball! These were full of flavor with a nice cripy outside - plus they were baked not fried.  I used Italian style bread crumbs and subbed a bit of the ground beef with Johnsonville Italian Sweet Sausage. These were perfect topped with marinara sauce and a dollup of ricotta cheese! All I need to do was serve these with pasta, a garden salad, warm bread and of course a nice glass of wine! Thanks for a great recipe!

These were good, but a bit bland.  Next time I might try 1 lb of ground beef and 1 lb of ground sausage.

I also used a 2" ice cream scoop to divide the beef.

I liked these a lot!  My kiddos don't like onions in their meatballs so I used dried minced onions, which they don't mind.  My daughter (9) and I rolled these together so some are a bit misshapen :)  That's okay!  Great recipe!!

I loved it! I added one package of Lipton onion soup, 1/4 cup of cooking sherry and a few drops of tabasco sauce and did not add as much onion and bread crumbs. Yum!

They came out very sturdy, but a little dry. I only just omitted the Parmesan and added a little marjoram. But overall very tasty, thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is so versatile! I added mild Italian sausage and it turned out perfect! I cooked 10 minutes then added 5. This stays in my list of ‘go to’.

I don’t see my original review, but... I really liked this recipe. I purposely omitted the onion because baby-on-the-way doesn’t like them at the moment, and I didn’t have thyme or basil on hand. They still came out delicious and not overpowering. I will make them in the future will all ingredients called for. Great recipe!

Made these meatballs last night & loved them.  Easy to prepare.  The only change I made was to the size of the meatballs.  Added to my simmering spaghetti sauce. Receipe made way more meatballs than needed so I froze for use at a later date.   Thanks for sharing, these will be my go to meatball recipe.

I'm not a fan of meatballs, but I made these for my family for subs. Of course, I had to try one first before serving them. Well, I shocked myself because I couldn't stop eating them!!! Good thing this recipe made more than we needed. I made them smaller than the recipe instructed. Delicious. I will never use another recipe for meatballs again.

Great!  A little heavy on the thyme, but still very good - will just use 1/2 teaspoon or less when I make it again, which will definitely happen!

made this recipe almost as posted. I made fresh bread crumbs and I also added a little water 1/4 cup to mixture because i am so used to adding liquid to my meatballs.  I figured they would be dry without some moisture.  They turned out fantastic!!!  Perfect and i definitely will use this recipe from now on.  Its a plain, simple recipe that works and the worchestchire sauce is genius.

Now, that's Italian! Love the italian herb flavors in this meatball. I should have minced the onion as my chopped onion pieces were too large for my liking and made shaping the meatball difficult. I didn't have parmesan cheese so substituted a string-cheese mozzarella stick that I grated. It worked really well and 1 stick = a scant 1/4 cup of grated cheese! Only thing I wish I had added is fresh parsley as I personally love it in meatballs but that's just me. You need to NOT have lean ground beef for this meatball as lean beef may make them dry. I made the mistake of having lean beef but it was still fairly moist. I didn't add the full 1/4 cup of bread crumbs as I knew my meat was lean. Made mine a little larger than golf balls and they're simmering in the sauce now. Thanks!

Very tasty, but I didn't want to make huge meatballs, so I rolled them into little 1 1/2 inch balls.  Watch your cooking time if you do this, or they'll overcook.  Very good!

Very nice tasting meatballs, and I'm not a fan of them. Herby, yes, and maybe a tad salty, depending on what you are doing with them. I followed the recipe precisely 'cept for using a few dehydrated onions rather than fresh. Remember to wear a glove on your mixing hand so you don't get "garlicked" and I thought a med size cookie scoop was perfect for our family (3 small kids). The other thing I'll do next time is to pluck the meatballs off the parchment when they come out and let them sit for a minute on a paper towel. There was plenty for dinner, left overs, and a few to freeze for a separate meal. This was easy, quick to prepare and leave in the fridge until dinner time and left overs were gone within 24 hours, so the recipe was a keeper.

Perfect!!! I made these last night to put in spaghetti sauce. I used ground venison in place of the ground beef and used dried, minced garlic. Also, I used Progresso Italian Seasoned bread crumbs. I omit the salt because parmesan cheese tends to be salty and the bread crumbs contain salt. They were excellent. Even good on their own without any sauce.  If you are a venison lover and have hunters in the family, try these with venison. My 14 year old son was excited that I made such a great meal using "his deer".  I will double the batch next time so I can freeze some for later.

Too much oregano. I recommend using 1/2 the amount because the tablespoon of oregano made the meatballs too aromatic - almost minty tasting.

These were perfect for sub sandwiches! We tweaked them by browning them stovetop first, then we put them in a baking dish lined with marinara, topped the meatballs with marinara, shredded Parmesan, and mozzarella. They baked for about 45 minutes and fit right into French hoagie, all saucy and cheesy! Definitely added to our regular monthly dinner menu!

These are definitely delicious! I made them with ground pork and I had to substitute provolone and mozzarella cheeses because I had no parmesan. Made the rotini pasta and marinara sauce the highlight of a week night meal!
Thank you Starr for submitting these meatballs.

These were great with spaghetti. The only thing I di was use onion powder instead of diced onions and I didn't have basil, so I used dry italian bread crumbs.  I will use this recipe for future meatballs.  I made 38 meatballs using this recipe and made them about an inch and half.  Thank you for this great recipe.

Very good meatball recipe. I used a combination of ground beef/turkey. I substituted Italian seasoning for the herbs called for in the recipe, and added a little ground sage, to give it the "sausage" flavor I like in my spaghetti dishes. Served with homemade sauce and bucatini pasta (the spaghetti with a hole in the middle). Very satisfying when craving a heavy Italian style meal

These meatballs are delicious! The only changes I made was adding parsley and fresh rosemary. I also made them smaller using an ice cream scoop to ensure even size and cooking. I used them in spaghetti but I'm sure a meatball sub will be fabulous. Will be making it again.

Incredible meatballs! Full of flavor, moist and perfect. I made smaller meatballs than the recipe called for, but I couldn't stop eating them after they came out of the oven. Super yummy!

These were good meatballs.  I made 1.5" meatballs and ended up with about 30 of them.  We ate 10 and froze the rest.   Good recipe though and it's nice to have some to heat up quickly on weeknights.

I made these meatballs to use with my own sauce recipe, though they were good, they were not as good as reported.  If you like your meatballs more hamburgery than you'll like it.  I like my meatball texture to be more smooth and juicy inside, maybe it's just me.

Used 1 1/2 lbs ground beef and 1/2 lb hot sausage.  I would recommend dicing onions very small as mine were a bit too large.  Very greasy....I had to wipe each one off and the pan was a pond of grease.  I think next time I'll bake them on a wire rack on top of the cookie sheet.  Next time I will reduce the thyme as it kind of overwhelms the other flavors.  Good base recipe that can easily be adapted to your liking.

GREAT meatballs! These are definitely some of the best meatballs I've ever had. Husband agreed. The only thing I didn't follow exactly was that I was out of Thyme so I substituted Italian Seasoning for that and made them into smaller sizes. So easy to make and this recipe is a keeper!

I love this recipe. I have  made this several times and they always turn out perfect. One thing I do differently is use crackers as my breadcrumbs. These are perfect meatballs just bursting with flavor and I will continue using this recipe.

These were amazing, I LOVED the flavor. I didn't have breadcrumbs so I used old fashioned rolled oats because that's what my mom used to do and I like the texture, has anyone else heard of that? I used about 1/3 to 1/2 cup instead of 1/4 cup, you might want to use less if you try this that's just how I like them.

These are the best meatballs I have ever made. I even liked them better than the esteemed Meatball Nirvana recipe on this site -- though those are delicious too.  Used seasoned breadcrumbs because that was all I had, but otherwise I followed the directions exactly. The seasoning was robust and my husband just raved. I halved the recipe and we ate half of that and froze the rest. Just hoping I can stay out of them until next time I make a pot of spaghetti -- yep, they're that good!

Amazing recipe! I'm just starting to cook and this was my first attempt at meatballs. Glad I found this recipe! I didnt have any Worcestershire sauce or thyme on hand, but they still went over very well with my family! Can't wait to make it again, hopefully with everything!

As an Allrecipe's Allstar, I was given a challenge to replace ground beef in a favorite recipe with Johnsonville brand sausage. I swapped ground mild Italian Johnsoville sausage and it was quite a success! These meatballs were crispy on the outside and very moist, juicy, and full of flavor on the inside! This was such a simple swap that imparted some new flavor into a favorite recipe, I will definitely try this again!

I was able to make 21 inch to 1 & 1/2 inch meatballs that I plan on putting in Spaghetti sauce. I needed to clean off the grease from each one after baking them in the oven for 15 minutes. I will use less onion next time, I think the kids would like that.

I just made these tonight (late), but they came out just wonderful. Our family loves garlic so I did add a couple more cloves. They looked like they needed a couple more minutes in the oven so I flipped them over after 15 mins. & gave them 10 more. Then I dropped them into a pot of spaghetti sauce with the intention of having meatball subs, but because of the late hour, we just ate a meatball with sauce on the place and it was fantastic! Can't wait to have them on a sub roll tomorrow night! Thanks Starr!

Used these for meatball subs.  Loved them and didn't (for a change) change the recipe!
