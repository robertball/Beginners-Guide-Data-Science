Let me add my 5 stars to the others and continue the perfect score.  This bread was exactly what I have been looking for while on the keto diet.  I used 1/4 tsp. salt  which seemed to be just right for me.  Other breads that use cheese in the mix are good,  but this one is the closest to real bread in  taste and texture.  I think this will make a good 'pound cake' with some vanilla and erythritol sugar maybe. I will make again...and again....

Great recipe!  Tastes wonderful, and has a nice crumb, tender crust.  I used extra fine blanched almond flour. I made the mistake of getting some egg yolk in the whites and had to start that again.  I found that the separation of whites and yolks was easier with cold eggs. With The second batch of eggs, I put each egg white aside before doing the next one.  Oh well, it will be scrambled eggs for breakfast tomorrow.

Totally on the list now. I made the egg whites a little more stiff. Also, I used salted butter. Makes all the difference

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly - and it was way too salty.  I used salted butter and that may have been the problem.  The second time I made it I again used salted butter but skipped the additional salt altogether and it was very good.    For diabetics who need to stay away from carbs and sugar, this is a great find.  The most recent time I made this I added some spices (dill and chives) as well as some shredded cheddar cheese.  Very good!

I remade this recipe because I liked it the first time. But I felt that I could improve it. The original recipe want neutral enough for my taste so I added a bit of vanilla, 3 tablespoons of honey& an extra 1/2 teaspoon of baking powder& what is difference it made. I didn’t taste any egg this time& the bread was so much more moist. I definitely recommend giving this version a try

Thank you for this recipe. This bread is just amazing. I cannot eat yeast, gluten, and very little sugar. It’s nearly impossible to find a yeast free gluten free bread. The recipes that I have tried over the years have been hard as bricks that taste terrible. This bread is delicious. It’s easy to make. It slices so easily. After four years of such a restrictive diet, I can finally have a slice of toast or a sandwich.

This recipe is great.  I did forget at the end to fold in remaining egg whites.  I just put them in the food processer and mixed them in (which did not mix well), so I finished mixing by hand.  I am not sure this changed the texture but mine turned out more like a pound cake.  It had a fine texture and was moist and very good.  I will definitely make this again.  Maybe even follow the recipe.

I would suggest a little less salt, and perhaps adding a little sugar. other wise its perfect.

Loved it.  I made sandwiches and strawberry shortcake. Amazing in comparison to mug bread. I sliced it and let all the moisture dry out before toasting.

I enjoyed this bread, nice rise. It would probably be even better if I didn’t have a corn allergy and have to make my own baking powder substitute. Here are the changes I made: I added about 2 Tbsp flaxseed meal to dry ingredients. I also used olive oil instead of melted butter. I added afew drops apple cider vinegar with the final mix with egg whites. I added no salt. 
Baking powder: 1.5 tsp cream of tartar and .75 tsp baking soda
Cooked a little over 30 minutes

Thank you for such a wonderful bread recipe! So simple. So easy.  I like the egg base it makes the bread dense enough to hold up to toasting.

This is excellent!  I’m new to Keto and have been missing morning toast.  I followed other reviewers and cut the salt to about an eighth of a teaspoon.  My processor was in the dishwasher, so I mixed and filed into the whites with a rubber patiala.  I also baked it in a small square casserole dish so it would be a bit taller.  I’m thrilled it all worked out, I thought I was probably going to ruin it.  This is a keeper!

Bread is very "eggy" and dense. So I decided to make french toast sticks out of it. Cut the bread into sticks, dip into a batter of egg, cream and cinnamon, fried in hot oil until golden brown and served with a topping of butter and a cinnamon/Serve mixture. Yum! Also, good with a blueberry compote made from cooked blueberries and Swerve.

I have made it 2x in as many weeks.  It does have its limitations .  I would not use it for a sandwich, but that is me and I dont like sandwiches.  Great for toast or just to have a slice of bread.  You dont need any more  butter.  It does not keep long in a humid warm environment so the second loaf was put in the fridge for a day then the remaining was sliced and put in the freezer.  A bonus is that you can slice it very thin or as thick as you would like.  I will be making bacon, tomato cheese melts with this bread.  PS, I am gluten free.

Really good, just a bit too salty. I will try the next batch with 1/2 the salt. Otherwise it’s just like a bread and for me being on the Keto Diet, it’s perfect! Definitely worth making, and it was an easy quick recipe.

I followed the steps and the bread came out perfect. It tastes great, the only thing what I would change is the amount of salt. If you don’t your bread to be salty just add 1/2 tsp  of salt instead of 1 tsp. Thank you chef for this delicious recipe ?? now I can satisfy my bread craving on Keto diet.

I have tried many different grain free bread recipes in the past.  There are so many that are either way too heavy or that taste too eggy.  This recipe is very good.  The bread has an exceptional texture and lightness that I have not been able to find in other recipes.  It has a nice neutral taste, too.  I will definitely make this again.

The first time I made this bread it didn't rise like I thought it should. Second time around, I whipped the egg whites to almost stiff-peak stage. Success!! I'm learning about barometric pressure and how it affects "lift/rise" because of having a home in the mountains, too.  I do plan to make this bread often, and will try it up at 10,000 ft sometime.  I do taste the egg a bit, but it in no way detracts from the texture and palatability -- in our opinion. Butter and honey just enhances this bread.

I made this for a friend and it looked great with good spongy texture. But it was too salty for her to eat. Will try again with very little salt. Maybe 1/4 tsp would be enough.

As others have said, this is the best keto bread recipe I tried.
It was light and fluffy, unlike the denser recipes out there.

I'm just wondering if it needs to be refrigerated?

Came out just like the picture. Left out salt because I used salted butter and some people said it was too salty. Also whipped the egg whites to stiff peaks because I live at 6000ft. One reviewer suggested that be done. It's beautiful and was done at 30 mins.

This bread is good but for some reason it tasted more like a cornbread instead of bread. I would make it again. I liked it. I was thinking I could make a sandwich with it but no unless it is an open face sandwich but again it didn't really taste like bread at all. I will make this bread again.

Great basic recipe! Followed exactly as written but stiffer egg white peaks. Allow to cool completely before slicing- it’s hard, I know but sooooo worth it! Will try with sweetener next:) Thank you chef!

I really enjoyed the taste of this bread.  I found it to have more than a "subtle egginess," as in the description; the egg flavor was dominant.  My loaf turned out soft, and while the slices stayed together, it would not work for a sandwich.  I am writing this as the bread is still warm, so perhaps it will be a bit more firm after it cools  It toasted very well and was good with honey and butter on it, and I'm assuming other sweet stuff as well.  I had a concern about the amount of almond flour to use, because this was my first time making something with it.  Because of its texture, I wasn't sure whether to treat it like regular flour or to pack it down a bit.  I opted for the first (loosely packed), so it could be that I didn't use quite enough, which might have affected the texture.  My only issue was that it seemed too salty.  I might try only 1/2 tsp. of salt the next time I make it.

Unbelievably good! Currently eating a sandwich I made with it, and YUM!  It baked up beautifully, got a nice rise in the oven. This is going to help keep me on my keto diet for sure! This possible variations on this bread are endless.

The texture reminds me of a cross between white bread and cornbread.  Not as soft as bread, but not quite as much texture/coarseness as cornbread.  Neutral flavor is a plus and is certainly not offensive.  Toasts nicely.  Mine did not rise much.  Next time I will try whipping the whites to fairly stiff peaks instead of soft peaks.  Very acceptable recipe for me, thanks!

Very nice bread.  The texture was like a sponge cake.  For me, though, it was very salty, and I love salt.  Next time, I will reduce the salt to 1/2 tsp, or even 1/4.

I wanted very much to like this recipe but it was just too eggy for me. I reduced the salt like others have suggested and that was good. Excellent lightness though. Just too eggy.

I thought this turned out great. Texture was good, better than expected. I used unsalted butter but it was still a little salty for my taste.  I will reduce the added salt next time I make it.

Do not make this with the expectation of it being bread. The only satisfying thing about it is that it has the form of bread. The egg taste is there so if you like eggs then this is a plus. But!!! I will say that it is super moist! Definitely not dry in any means (which is a bonus). I think maybe next time I’ll add some coconut sugar (paleo but still doing butter) in hopes to make the egginess more mild.

I followed the recipe to the T and I really like it.  Can't see making a sandwich with it but definitely use it for breakfast or with soup and chili.

Awesome! I do not believe in adjusting any recipe until I have made it once. This is wonderful as is..
There are a few variations I may try later, but I am really pleased with this bread.

Unfortunately, mine turned out very salty and I couldn't eat the remaining loaf.  I will try again without salt altogether. Chef John's video was helpful.  The texture was the same as the video and tasted more like pound cake than bread.

Didn’t like it.  Far too many eggs.    When toasted it tasted like a well done plain omelette. Will never make it again.

Ok for what it is. Can't stand alone on its own but good with preserves or used for a breakfast sandwich.

Liked it a lot but it tasted a little too “eggy” to me. I used Himalayan pink salt instead of table salt.  I wonder if that had something to do with the taste?   Haven’t toasted  it yet but can’t wait to try!

Well the "batter" was a dough. Flavor was ok but it is so dry MAYBE I can eat it if I put it in a bowl and pour milk on it like cereal. I'll try something else.

Turned out great! Followed recipe and loved it. I had to use mixer in egg whites rather than whisk due to wrist pain but very happy with the outcome!
