These turned out wonderfully, very simple to make.  Just a couple of comments:  I left out the almond extract as my nephew has a nut allergy & everyone still thought they were delicious.  Also, I baked them on sheets lined with parchment paper instead of foil.  This eliminated the need to grease the foil, and preserved the gluten-free nature of the recipe (my sister has celiac disease, & Pam for Baking contains flour, so that wasn't an option.)  I was able to reuse the parchment sheets for each batch; the cookies slid right off the paper & cleanup was a cinch.

I use unsweetened coconut when making these and they turn out great.  I often omit the egg also.  One time I just forgot it, and they turned out better. I also use a small scoop to form them and then press slightly with the bottom of the cookie scoop once they are dropped onto the pan.  I use Pam on the foil or more often parchment and haven't had a problem with sticking when I take them off immediately. It's a nice touch to place a piece of sliced almond on top after baking, or to dip the tops in a little melted dark chocolate.  I've served these at my daughter's weddings.  I recently changed my rating of these from a 4 to a 5 because I continue to make them after 4 years, and they are always a hit.

I made a test batch because of all the varying reviews, but I needn't have worried.  Soooo easy to make, even with a toddler at my heels.

I pretty much followed the recommendations of the other reviewers..I whipped the egg white till it formed soft peaks, used unsweetened coconut - I think it would have been too sweet otherwise. I added the almond extract to the condensed milk and mixed it together before adding the other ingredients (I only used 1 tsp). I formed little balls with the mixture, pressing them down slightly, then put them on greased tin foil.  After about 15 min. at 325 they started to get brown on the bottom, and I removed them  immediately from pan. 

They came out perfectly and didn't spread at all.  I will definately be making a big batch of these for the holidays!

I found this to be a very easy recipe.  I did alter it a bit.  First I doubled the recipe (with 8 married kids and 13 grandchildren I double everything), then, to prevent the cookies from flattening I added another 14oz bag of coconut.  I rolled them with my fingers a bit forming balls.  The balls kept their shape just fine.  Then I poured a chocolate glaze.  I had read another reviewer's comment about not over-cooking them.  If stored in an airtight container the toasted coconut will soften.

Really liked this recipe - I followed a lot of the tips of everyone else. I whipped the egg white and the condensed milk together to give it a bit of volume.

As well, I also added about 1/2 a cup of flour, as many of the other ratings said they were too runny. The flour gave it excellent consistency and the taste is still great! The balls of macaroon kept their shape perfectly.

Oh! And to prevent them from sticking to the pan I used silicon mats/silpat - did the trick, didn't need any foil or non-stick coatings at all!

I think these are very good, however I did leave out the egg white. They are a very sweet cookie so I think the next time I will add a little flour to see if that cuts the sweetness on them. I had no problem removing them from the pans because I used parchment paper. I use it on all my cookies actually because you can just slide the whole bunch off your sheets for cooling. Try parchment! You will LOVE it!

First off, use aluminum foil as it states in the recipe to line your cookie sheets & you won't have a problem with them sticking.  This recipe is really easy & delicious.  Also I found that turning my spatula over so that it is in a 45 degree angle helped to remove each macaroon easier.

These are good, just a word of warning for anyone making these. I put the waxed paper on the cookie sheet, buttered and floured, the trick to removing them after they are cooked is to remove them immediately from the cookie sheet or else they will all stick and you will get very frustrated!

good recipe! these turned out pretty well! i whipped the egg white to soft peak before adding the rest of the ingredients- they olny spread a bit during baking. next time i think i will whip the can of S. C. milk, too. (yes, it does whip up some) i thought the dough was a little soft- next time i will buy more coconut and add untill i get the right consistancy. beacuse they were a little soft, i got my hands wet and made balls to put on the cookie sheet- then they didn't spread much at all. i cooked them at 325 (to dry them out) for 15min or so and they were lovely! i don't know what every one else is doing w/ the foil- because i sprayed "pam for baking" on my foil and they come off great- maybe theirs were too runny.

I think that other reviewers that ended up with a runny mess fell victim to a flaw in how this recipe is written:  it doesn't say HOW whipped the egg white needs to be.  If you simply beat the egg white, no dice.  It must be beaten to stiff peaks;  then it will have enough body to bind the mixture.  Also used Silpat sheet liners (no need to grease or flour them) and the cookies came off no problem and could be cooled on the sheets.  Used sweetened coconut, and the cookies weren't too sweet.  Very nice, chewy and satisfying (despite using coconut that was a little old because I felt guilty tossing it out!).  Now that I've made these many times, would add these changes:  four teaspoons vanilla, no almond extract (why should a pile of coconut taste like almond?), and, cook a few minutes longer than called for, until the bottoms are nicely golden brown.  If you pull them when they look really perfect and only lightly golden on the bottom, they will be too sticky and soft the next day, not a nice texture at all.  Plus, the browner bottoms have a delicious, caramel-like taste!

I have made these macaroons for years, saving the recipe from the Baker's coconut bag.  The BEST tip I can offer is to use the Reynolds NON-STICK foil on the baking sheet.  It works waaay better than parchment.

This was my Easter gift to my husband and HE LOVED THEM! I had made them years ago and they were too soft and sticky, so after reading lots of reviews, I decided to try them. Here are my tweaks: 2 egg whites and I beat the heck out of them, 1/2 cup of flour, and non-stick foil. I also had to cook them for an additional 7 minutes (total 22 min.) They came out with a nice crisp shell and chewy inside. My husband liked them because they were not as sweet as before. Very attractive because the little flakes of coconut on the outside browned nicely. I think I made them too big because there weren't 48 of them, but that is a matter of taste. I will definitely make them again. Also, I put the can of sweetened condensed milk in a bowl, added the extracts, and then added the flour, then folded in the egg whites, and finally added the coconut.

This is a super easy receipe and always turns out great. The one bad review from the "excellent baker" did not follow the directions and used evaperated milk not sweetened condensed. That's why she got a runny mess. Even a 8 year old could make these and everyone loves them. Take them to around Passover to your Jewish friends and or family.

Do NOT make this recipe. I followed everything exactly and all it made was a runny, expensive mess. I'm an excellent baker and have never had anything turn out poorly except a dry cake here or there. This is the worst recipe ever! I even added an extra whipped egg and it was beyond saving. Don't waste your time!!!!!

These are very tasty! In the spirit of spring and easter I made them into little nests and nestled a Cadbury egg in the center of the coconut. I then sprinkled a bit of cocoa powder over the top to give it a tinge of chocolaty brown color. When they baked the chocolate Cadbury egg cracked a bit so it looked like a chick was hatching. They looked totally adorable. I suggest this snazzy touch for easter and spring parties- it might also be a cute, sweet addition to a baby shower. See the images on this recipe for pictures of the coconut nests. : )

Very quick and easy!  I used the quick release al. foil and did not grease and flour it.  I had no sticking problems.  These cookies are very sticky.  I baked mine for only 13 min. because they starting getting really brown.  I will make these again!

Everyone here seems to love em!  It's hard for me to judge cuz I don't like coconut. ;)  I read all the reviews and decided to try them without the egg first...we have sensitivities and allergies in the house...and they seem to be just fine.  I'll prolly do the next batch with the egg to see how it changes things.  Our only complaint was that the tops were "sharp."  So I moved my oven rack down, and it was a little better.  Oh, and I used parchment paper as was mentioned...I love that stuff!

UPDATED: cooked it this time with the egg white, and it was much fluffier!  I think I'm changing it from 4 to 5 stars now.  :)  Especially after dipping this batch in chocolate! ;D

These were delicious and very quick and easy. I would suggest to fold the whipped eggs (with a touch of salt so they stay whipped better) into the coconut, sweetened condensed milk mixture for cookies to stay together better, and spray baking sheet with Pam so they come right off and have a crispier bottom. Other than that, this recipe turned out just the way I wanted! And they taste just as good with the fat free condensed milk! A little less guilty feeling ;)

This is a wonderful recipe for homemade macaroons! They're soft and chewy with lots of flavor. I reduced the amount of almond extract to 1/2 tsp since that's what it calls for on the actual eagle brand website. It was a perfect amount! Also, make sure you read about much coconut you actually need! That's what I'm assuming happened to all the people's who turned into a liquid mess-not enough coconut. Overall, a wonderful recipe!

I read the reviews and some said to use sweetened coconut and others said unsweetened so I used half sweetened shredded coconut and half plain old unsweeted medium coconut and they turned out the perfect sweetness and texture. Used the fudge filling recipe from the fudge puddles recipe on this site and put mini eggs in the center for eeaster nests. super cute and easy. I whipped the egg white until soft peaks formed before adding it. also mix the extracts into the condensed milk.

I can't believe how easy and delicious these were!  I made them to give away for holiday gifts but I hope I can avoid eating them all.  I didn't change a thing.  I beat the egg white to soft peaks.  I will definitely make them again!

Couldn't be easier or tastier! I left out the egg based on others' comments and found them to be excellent. They slid off the parchment easily. I made 3 different flavors by adding mini milk chocolate chips or white chocolate chips, plus the plain original recipe. (See the photo)

EASY!  I wore latex gloves to keep my hands from getting messy.  Also, I used only one teaspoon of almond extract, that was plenty for me.

I pretty much followed this recipe to the letter (except I left out the almond flavor), it seemed ok until I actually baked them. I put the rounded balls of coconut batter mix on an airbake cookie sheet and put it in the oven for 15 mins like it said. When I went to pull them out, they had melted all over the pan, and it was a mess! I don't know what I did wrong, but I don't think I will try these again, or if I do I will add some flour like another person suggested and maybe a second egg white.

This is the first macroon recipe I ever tried and I think they turned out just about perfect! I used parchment paper and didn't have any problems with them sticking.

This was the best recipe for macaroons I've ever tasted. I almost committed gluttony. Can't wait until Thanksgiving gets here as I plan on quadrupling the recipe. Leeflea.

These are wonderful, but I did have to add the 1/2 cup of flour that some recommended. I tried without and they were too runny and wouldn't stay together. Once I got that figured out, it was a breeze. I used the parchment paper and melted dark chocolate chips to drizzle on top. :) Only finished an hour ago and they're almost halfway gone already! (have to hide them next time from the family lol)

Love how easy these are to make!! I do use parchment paper and I scoop them with a cookie scooper and they hold their shape. I also refrigerate batter in between baking so the mix stays cold

I love these, but when I bake them, i add flour, coz otherwise they are too soft and break easily. Flour makes it stronger and harder, which i love ;) But in general, very good recipe, yummy ;)

I really like this recipe and love macaroons however, it was quite sweet so next time i make it i would like to find a way to lessen the sweetness.  I also added some flour to make them a little less sticky and by adding the flour  it was also easier to remove from the cookie sheets. I did not use foil, wax or parchment paper. I found it easier to just grease and flour the cookie sheets .

This recipe just didn't work for us.  We added more coconut than the recipe called for and added 1/4 c of flour.  We also whipped the egg white as indicated in the reviews.  They were still really sticky and runny.  We won't be making these again.

These are the best macaroons I've ever made. Try using parchment paper on the cook sheet for easier clean-up and no sticking.

Because I never has any success using foil with cookies they always stuck to it & I would have pieces of foil in the finished cookies I decided to use the parchment paper suggestion, but I thought parchment paper & waxed paper were the same thing I found out after they stuck to the waked paper that I was wrong. So DON'T USE WAXED PAPER! When I tried to get them off the waxed paper half the cookie stuck to it & I got just the tops of the cookies. What was left from that mess tasted EXCELLENT though :) Best macaroons I've ever tasted can't wait to make them correctly!

My husband made this recipe yesterday and we think they're wonderful!  We made two small changes - the egg white was not whipped but rather stirred into the condensed milk and we left out the almond extract. We also made the cookies fairly large - ended up with 2 dozen, not 4 dozen. We will be making them again!

These came out perfect for me, but only on the second go-around after I'd worked out the bugs.

First, the All Recipes version contains an obvious error: it's just 1/2 tsp of almond extract, NOT 1-1/2 tsp. .

Second, this recipe absolutely *needs* 1/2 cup of flour added, to hold the cookies together.  Otherwise they get runny in the oven and turn into puddles of sweetened coconut.

But, once I made those two changes, I'm pretty happy with how they look and taste.

These turned out really well considering it was my first time. I did use the egg though some suggested not using it. Next time, I will be sure to roll the cookies into tight balls before putting on the cookie sheet because it was really hard to get the baked cookies off the sheet without them breaking apart. They were all completely stuck to the bottom even though I greased and floured the pan prior to baking.

This was relatively easy to make for a novice cook. However I did find some flaws in the recipe which I plan on modifying in the future. First of all, the cookies stuck to the pan immediately after being removed from the oven (literally, i had to rip them off while the pan was still hot) even though they were greased and floured. Many have suggested parchment paper instead. Another flaw was that the dough was way too runny, I think adding about a 1/2 of flour would have helped it immensely. Finally, they were way too sweet, I would use unsweetened condensed milk in the future and sweeten with sugar to taste or something.

these coconut macaroons were deliciously packed with coconut. i absolutely enjoyed them. the only downside was that they were IMPOSSIBLE to remove from the pan! i tried aluminum  foil, parchment paper, and even tried spraying with nonstick and butter- nothing would make them unstick. Which left me with an ugly mess of macaroons. if only there was a way to fix that....

Excellent, easy, macaroon recipe. I added 1 additional egg white which was perfect for for the recipe. I was a little concerned that it would make the macaroons meringue(y). It didn't. They were very moist, old-world type, that i will make again.

I omitted the almond extract.  I wish I hadn't but didn't have any on hand.  Mine came out super sticky.  I do not think I cooked them long enough.  They tasted good but kinda hard to eat.  I will definitely make them again but cook them longer.  I cooked them about 15-16 minutes but they could probably have gone about 20.  I also cooked them on wax paper and that seemed to work well.

I found that using an entire 14 ounce package made the taste of coconut a little overpowering.  Being that I would prefer more of a cookie taste, I would probably use less coconut in the future.

easy-schmeasy recipe!  make sure you beat egg white to STIFF PEAKS and use parchment paper.....no sticking!!!!!!!!!   i like making them smaller rather than bigger so each cookie gets more carmelized and i drizzle with melted dark chocolate.

By itself, a good recipe for macaroons. I don't have any problem keeping the cookies together, and didn't add more coconut. I make them bigger, about 32 cookies. I also drizzle 70% chocolate on top. This makes them have a better presentation- and even more delicious!

These macaroons turned out soooo much better than the first time I made "Rock hard hockey pucks" 38 years ago!! I followed reviews and added 1/3c of flour to make sure they didn't spread out, and they didn't. Also used 1/2t of coconut extract for more flavor.  I topped them with a single raw almond and a dollop of melted semi-sweet chocolate chips. I am going to try these again and do it as the recipe is written just to see how they taste with out the flour.  Still not sure about the using almond extra in the amount stated though. All in all a very easy cookie to make. Oh, I did beat the egg white to a firm peak before folding into the coconut.

i liked this recipe because it's easy.  i tried the suggestion of adding 1/2 c flour, and that was fine.  there was a slight funny taste, but i don't know why.  i might try it again without the flour and see what happens.  my macaroons were a little big, so i'll just do small spoonfuls next time.  thanks!

I make this recipe every year at Christmas. I love it. I do add at least  a 1/4 cup of flour & reduce the almond extract to 1 tsp. This recipe has never yielded 4 dozen cookies for me; I usually get about 3 dozen. I'm not sure if I'm making the cookies too large. I have a small scoop that holds 3 tsp of water (yep, I measured it!) for scooping the cookie batter. I like the size of the cookie that it produces, but as I said I never get 4 dozen cookies.
The taste is great, better than candy, and the texture is great.

Great flavor but this recipe needed more dry ingredients. Also the macaroons were hard to get off the cookie sheet even when warm. I had greased and floured my cookie sheet!

One very good tip I would recommend to those that have a sticking problem....Use Bakers Joy Spray on the baking sheet. I dont bake without it. It helps so much. Another thing I do is I put the coconut in a food processor so the coconut isnt long and stringy and it comes out in a nice chewy consistancy. Mine bake runny as well, but after I remove them and "trim" the runny hard stuff off the macaroon, I get a nicely shaped, chewy macaroon. Hope this helps a bit.

Big fan of coconut, but had never dared make macaroons at home.  Until today.  This recipe is easy, quick and delicious.  I added  significanly more coconut and omitted the almond extract - didn't have any - and they taste great.  They are a bit drippy on the bottom but, I think next time I might add another egg white to stiffen them a bit more.  Good idea?  I used parchment paper and it worked great.

I couldn't find this recipe anywhere until now.  I had forgot (and my Mom had forgot)how to make them.  I thank the previous ladies for submiting their ideas!  I have made them, and they are great -- reminiscent of the OLD days when Mom made them for Christmas and colored them with red and green food coloring!

Even with greasing the foil, these are nearly impossible to take off the tray hot or cooled.  Macaroons in general are always tricky to remove.  They do taste good, but of the 40 I baked six were beyond repair and the rest all needed some remolding after they were removed from the tray.  That's what I get for trying to take a short cut.

Too sweet for me.  Guess I'm not a fan of sweetened condensed milk.  I buttered and floured the wax paper and they still stuck to the paper.

they are a very sweet and simple macaroon. they are tasty but i can't help but feel they could have a little more body to them.  they are missing the flour  that would give them buoyancy.  all in all not bad but not great. they don't come out looking like the picture at all.

Followed directions exactly & by far the easiest cookie recipe , and for such a delicacy, you can't beat it! 
I am a lover of coconut, other recipes call for flour...if you don't love coconut, use that other recipe, but this is a coconut livers dream!

I was surprised at how great these tasted. I whipped the egg whites until stiff peaks formed and then combined all other ingredients as written. After they cooled I took a piece to taste test and wound up devouring the entire macaroon.

Fabulous recipe! My family can't get enough of it! And gluten free! I used fat free condensed milk and it tastes just as good! I also added chopped pecans or almonds to make it like a low-fat homemade AlmondJoy!

I made these with leftover stuff: 1/2 a can of sweetened condensed milk, a little under 1# of unsweetened coconut from the bulk section of the health food store.  I still used a whole egg white, for reasons of convenience.  They turned out perfectly!  If I make a full batch, I'll most likely use two egg whites.  Don't worry, these are a snap.

This was so runny. I tried using a paper towel to soak up some of the liquid, but when I took them out of the oven, they had run all over the cookie sheet. This is not a recipe that I will try again.

I followed it to a tee and they were overall disappointing. First, consistency was super wet (actually an excess of wet ingredients) making them difficult to place on cookie sheet. Secondly, I removed them right away onto a cooling rack once baked, and they practically fell apart! THEN they stuck to the cooling rack (after letting them cool for over an hour) and ruined the bottom of every macaroon. They taste was OK, more like a coconut candy than a traditional coconut macaroon.  I will not be making this recipe again.

I made these today and I can only say WOW. I didn't modify the recipe in any way, but I will follow the recommended advice to use parchment paper instead of foil next time. The aroma of these baking was absolutely amazing, and I admit I was craving a glass of Amaretto after LOL. I will definitely be making these for the holidays coming up. Absolutely fantastic.

Easy to over or under bake these macaroons. Also, not much substance to them, seemed like they needed more ingredients. I lessened the almond extract to 1t and it was plenty of almond flavor.

I made this cookies for a holiday at my son's school and they were a big hit! I put them out and they were all gone in no time.  I will definitely make again, for a little added something I dipped the bottoms of all the Macaroons in melted milk chocolate, so yummy...

Recipe 4 stars b/c it was easy to follow. Macaroon turned out OK but I wasn't thrilled w/ flavor. Used parchment paper - did not stick. Mix did not turn out runny for me - seems it lacked SOMETHING...not sure what. Not sure if I'll try again.

These are very yummy!  Made them for Christmas party last year, everyone loved them!  I'm not a fan of things made with condensed milk, but I found that if I used Fat Free condensed milk, the flavor was lighter and not too sweet!

These failed miserably for me. I tried three batches and couldn't get any of them off the cookie sheet. they are very very sticky.  so I have these very tasty crumbs.  Will probably eat them that way (like macaroon popcorn).  I can't figure out how these would ever turn out right.  And I bake alot.

I have been using this macaroon recipe for a few years. It is my favorite. However, I have found that using Pam or other sprays make them fall apart in the oven, so I only use flour on foil. Also, this last round I put in floured mini cupcake trays which worked very well!

AWESOME recipe! I have made it a zillion times, just like the original, and it turns out great everytime! I do use parchment paper instead of foil, and I have no issues.

FIVE stars. I love this recipe. Easy to make, and delicious. I get the candied cherries, that are used for christmas fruitcakes, and press one into the sfot macaroon right after they are baked. Awesome.

I didn't like it. The condensed Milk leaked out on the baking sheet. Was TOO sweet, sticky, and  chewy, hard to swallow! I won't make it again!

mine did not turn out. the condensed milk leaked out of the macaroons during baking and were very sticky. i almost got foil into the actual macaroon. i was very disappointed and i thought they were way too sweet.

This was my first time making macaroons. I was a little iffy at first by how they looked before baking. They were a bit sweet for my taste. I was looking for more of a "cookie" type macaroon.

These turned out very yummy.  I added 1/2 cup flour so they are not too sticky at all and you cannot detect any flour in the cookie.  As soon as cooled enough I will drizzle them in melted chocolate. Thanks for a great cookie recipe :)

I'm surely doing something wrong because this is supposed to be easy and versatile.  First I forgot to whip the egg and that turned out pathetic.  With the next batch, I whipped it well and then whipped the condensed milk in with it.  They run all over the pan.  So then I put them in a silicaon mold to hold them together, but they still fall apart and don't come out like all the pretty cookies in the pictures.  I'm not giving up yet, but certaily wouldn't say this recipe is for dunces like me!

These turned out wonderfully! I added 1/3 cup of flour based on other reviews.  I also substituted the almond extract with coconut extract.  I used a silicone baking mat and didn't have a problem with them sticking at all - hot or cooled.  Everyone LOVED them, including my husband who doesn't like coconut! People are already begging for more.

I wasn't crazy about this recipe; maybe I did something wrong, but they were runny, and the runny edges burned. They weren't pretty at all, the flavor wasn't very coconutty, etc. Do not recommend this one.

Very good!  I did two balls and put them together to create macaroon snowmen & then added faces & a scarf with frosting.  They were a HUGE hit!  (In fact they won best cookie at the Christmas cookie party I took them to!)

These are very good, but they definitely stick to the pan.  You   need to remove them immediately. Also, next time I will grate the coconut or chop finely.

Thanks for this recipe. I love coconut macaroons and finally got to know how to make them. This is a very very easy and tastes yummy. I saw reviews that it is not easy to remove from the tray and gets sticky. My advice is grease the baking tray/cookie sheet with butter dust with flour. Once cookies done just give a light push from a spatula for each individual macaroon and you can remove them very easily without damaging the shape.

I made as the recipe said and the cookies spread out on the pan. The next half of the batch I added about a 1/3 to 1/2 cup of flour and they turned out much better. Good reviews from those that liked macaroons!

My first time making macaroons and these are easy, tender and taste great.  I used 1 teaspoon of almond extract, and sweetened coconut because that was all I had.  They were not overly sweet, although I'll try it the other way next time, and definitely try parchment paper.  They were a little runny, but easily shaped back up.  I am not too fussy about appearance of my cookies;  it's all about taste for me, and these are good!

These turned out great. I made the change of using a few drops of lorann gourmet pina colada flavoring oil, instead of the vanilla and almond extract to just have a change from the traditional and my family loved them.

Great, moist macaroon.  Turned out much better than the "Farm Macaroon" recipe on this site (though I like that one too).  Only thing I would change next time is cut or omit the almond extract.  It really seems to overpower the coconut flavor.

I just made a batch of these and they came out wonderful!  Very easy and I followed the direction exactly.  Can't wait to take them to the cookie exchange this week.  Thanks.

While these are very tasty, I had a huge problem with them oozing all over the place.  There was liquid seeping out all over my cookie sheets.  I made 4 batches for a cookie exchange and will have to dip the bottoms in chocolate so they don't look so messy.  I used Reynolds "Release" foil and had no problem with sticking.

These are really delicious and beautiful on a plate of cookies. I added somewhat more coconut, probably a cup mire coconut. This kept the edges from sweating out onto the baking sheet. I also partially buried a maraschino cherry with stem into the center of each cookie, which greatly increased the pizzazz factor. They were a huge hit!

I made this for a girl's tea party expecting there would be many more left based on how much this recipe makes. But of course, it did not turn out that way. The plate was licked clean. It was so clean, that if one was a mile away from the plate, oneself would be able to see it even with one's eyes closed.
(I suggest you try this recipe. it is the best coconut macaroon I have ever made.)

I first found this recipe on a can of eagle brand sweetened milk, I've been making them for many years and they are a favorite of my family. 
I omit the egg and almond extract and they always turn out fabulous. Favorite Christmas cookie!

I live in Canada and converted the measurements for the coconut packages and Eagle Brand can and I am sure that’s why this turned out a runny mess! I found this recipe on Eagle Brand Canada’s website and it was obvious what went wrong: https://www.eaglebrand.ca/En/Recipes/Snowy-Coconut-Macaroons. 

This Canadian version only requires a 300ml can of Eagle Brand. I used 414 ml, which is what 14 fl oz converts to in ml. It also calls for 3 X 200g packages of coconut; I only used 2 because I actually weighed 2 packages on my kitchen scale and they weighed 15 oz. 

For all you Canadians out there that had a runny mess, I’m guessing you had the same issues. Although I haven’t tried this Canadian version yet, I’m guessing it will be much better!

Absolutely delicious. Whipped the egg white and Eagle Brand first as another user suggested. Cooked 14 minutes. A little difficult to “drop” as the dough is sticky, but the result was very tasty.

I used 1/2 sweetened coconut and 1/2 unsweetened, just because that is what I had.  It worked great.  I had no difficulty removing them from the parchment paper.

Tried this recipe based on all the positive reviews. I couldn’t find my gramma’s recipe which included flour and a dash of salt. Nonetheless, I gave this one a try. It was very runny and did not form the perfect little done shape that I was used to based on my grammas recipe. Don’t know how they’ll taste but with all the sugar I’m sure they’ll taste sweet at least.

Crispy on the outside and moist on the inside!   I first tried the 5 star recipe with flour, which was like eating straw.  I also used finely shredded coconut after the whole 'straw' debacle and then pressed the balls into some larger flakes for a great look.  I also followed another reviewer who used two egg whites.   I did add about 1 Tbsp of coconut oil (again, fear of 'straw').   Parchment paper worked perfectly, btw.   Love these and am running out to make another batch to give to friends!

I only give this three out of five only because the directions aren't clear. It doesn't state whether the egg white should be whipped to soft or firm peaks and, since I was measuring the coconut in cups (I bought it in bulk) I wasn't sure how many cups to use. They came out very flat! Next time I will use more coconut and whip the egg white to firm peaks. They taste amazing otherwise!

The only reason I gave this a 4 was because of the sugar content. I only used 1/3 cup sugar to beat with the egg and the sweetened coconut. Next time I will try the unsweetened. To each his own but seriously I will never by them at the store again unless there is a shortage of bagged coconut. BE ADVISED...we aren't kidding when we all say take them off right away. one of the batches I waited until after scooping the next onto the baking sheet and they were already starting to stick!! Try chilling the mix before baking, I had no flattening. Sorry Pep. Farm, your coconut goose is cooked...

Would've been 5 stars, but the egg white added too much liquid and they 'leaked' during baking. Luckily, I was able to trim off the leakage and ended up with a delicious centre! I'll definitely make these again, but without the egg white (and maybe a bit more coconut).

I was very disappointed in this recipe.  It says to remove from pan right away so it won't stick.  Unfortunately it came out of the oven stuck.  The idea of lining the pan with aluminum foil is a terrible idea.  I ended up having to reshape most of them.

I think this recipe is missing the refrigeration before baking or something.  The cookies didn't hold their shape when baking.

I followed this recipe exactly and it did not hold together in the oven at all - all the liquid seeped out into a goopy mess. Avoid.

I too had the experience of them being runny. I did not alter the recipe at all. Everything ran together, and they stuck to the greased, floured foil liner. I was able to scrape enough coconut off of the pan to put together about fourteen macaroons. I have been baking for forty years, and carefully follow a new recipe.

after reading mixed reviews I thought I'd give it a try anyway. It spread just like one reviewer stated.  I did try to taste it, and from what I could pick out to try, I'm glad that I only used 1/2 tsp of almond extract as another reviewer pointed out to do.  Will not be making this one again.

Fabulous recipe!  I brought these to a cookie swap a few years ago and am always asked to bring them again!  Like others, I use parchment paper to line the cookie sheets; I re-use the same paper for the entire batch of cookies.  Also, I use a small, rounded scoop to put the cookies on the paper.  They pretty much retain their shape while baking and this ensures moist, chewy macaroons.  As a special treat, I press an unwrapped Hershey's Kiss into the macaroon when they are fresh out of the oven (before removing from the cookie sheet), then I move them to a rack to cool.  When they cool, it is a chocolate / coconut sensation!!

I did not like the taste of these at all. Perhaps I added a little too much almond extract. They just tasted off. My husband didn't care for them either. I took them to work to get rid of them. I will not make these again.

This was a good recipe and quite easy.  I drizzled melted dark chocolate over them after they cooled and they were quite delicious that way.

Not sure what happened but when my brother tried to make these they turned out a soggy mess that we had to drain and reshape into balls after we baked them. They still taste good though. It could be because we had shredded instead of flaked coconut.

I have baked macaroons before with a recipe without the egg and less condensed milk.  These were stickier and runnier.  But tasted the same.  I will go back to my original recipe.

I made these kinds of cookies before and they kind of oozed out. I don't know that there are many variations on this recipe however this year the macaroons turned out pretty good. I find you have to make much smaller cookies and of course depending on your oven you might need to cook them higher or longer to really brown. The taste was good and they held their shape this year, very good results.

For me, this didn't hit the spot of a macaroon I was tasting in my mind. This was easy to make, super simple, but I found them to be to extremely sticky and wet and when they baked, they spread. While the kids liked them, I found them okay.

This was very easy to make.  I did combine the extracts into the sweetened condensed milk before combining with the whipped egg white. I used parchment paper as well to keep the recipe gluten-free.

I did not care for this recipe. I've made macaroon cookies in the past that were delicious. This called for the cookies to be toasted around the edge before removing from the oven and for the foil lined pan to be well greased. I followed the directions carefully and found that the cookies were  difficult to remove from the foil. How much more butter could I have used to grease the foil?? I also did not care for the taste of the cookie with sweetened condensed milk. This is the first time I have used it in a macaroon cookie recipe. I won't be doing that again. I'll stick with the recipe I have always used.

I think omitting the egg as someone suggested might be wise.  I made them according to the recipe, and it almost seems like the macaroon is sitting on top of a pancake.  Like all the egg mixture cooked apart from the rest of the cookie.  They still taste really good though!  And parchment paper is the way to go!!

I made a 1/2 recipe since I only had 1/2 bag of coconut. I added 1/3 c flour per suggestion of other reviewers. I baked them at 325 for 15 minutes and they puffed up, not round. I put a 1/2 maraschino cherry on top. My husband didn't like them.

Absolutely delicious! Very easy to make. Look beautiful and are wonderfully moist and coconut -ty. I lined my cookie sheet with parchment. It worked great. The macaroons slid right off.

These were great!  I did follow the tip on adding some flour and the consistancy was perfect.  When they came out of the oven I put a (whole natural) almond in the middle and drizzled chocolate over them, yumo its an almond joy!!!!  Next time I may try some slivered almonds then do the chocolate, so the almond is all through the cookie.  I will definatley be making these through the holidays.

Mine turned out quite runny and added some flour to the next batch to bake but otherwise preferred my other recipe that I have instead.

These were ok in the taste department, but they were so sticky that we lost most of them as they stuck to the foil.

There is definitely something missing from this recipe-it was too wet even when I tried to add some flour as some of the reviewers suggested.  I think if you really want a macaroon recipe you need to try another resource!  Disappointing to say the least,

So good.  Definitely didn't make 48, but maybe mine were just a little large.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Easy and delish!

Mmmmm! Chewy-sweet and good! I like to make two variations as well: 1) I slightly flatten the balls and bake as directed, then dip halfway into melted semisweet chocolate; or, 2) I press a dark chocolate Hershey's kiss in the center of the cookies while still warm. Yummy!

I agree with other reviewer's although they are tasty this recipe was definitely missing something. My best guess flour. I didn't have a problem removing them from parchment paper but I had to add 5 minutes for a total of 22 in the oven.

very sweet if you use sweetened coconut in addition to the sweetened condensed milk. otherwise, delicious! reduced almond extract to 1/2 tsp and put chocolate almond on top after cooled for a minute.

Initially I followed this recipe exactly, and the first batch was very runny; I ended up with little puddles of condensed milk and islands of coconut.  For the second batch I followed the advice of other reviewers and added 2/3 cup of flour. This somewhat decreased their tendency to spread, though they were still quite messy.

These were a pain.  They need something to hold them together.  I would not make these again.

They look just like the pic  but dont have the body and texture of the real Jewish macaroons I buy in the store. Need flour to add more texture ,will try another recipe next time.Also ,be sure to use unsweetened coconut otherwise the recipe is way to sweet.

These were easy to make and my husband loved them. I followed recipe but added a 1/4 cup more of coconut as the consistanty seemed a little runny. Also I added chocolate chips to half of the dough. I used a round scoop to make the balls so my hands would not get as messy...worked out wonderfully.

I LOVE coconut but never got around to making macaroons.  These were so easy to make and everyone in my house loves them!

I left out the almond extract, as I did not see it pleasing to my taste preferences.

I also omitted the use of foil. It isn't necessary as long as you thoroughly grease and flour the baking sheets you use, and still remove the cookies immediately.
