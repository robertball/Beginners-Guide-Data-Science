I made this recipe exactly as stated.  It is uniquely delicious.  The banana and coconut flavour are strangely delicate yet lasting.  Can hardly taste the cranberry but there is a tangy taste that hints at fruity.  Simply, healthy and delicious.  Thanks for this recipe.  I like these types of recipes, no sugar no processed foods, just the natural flavours.

Yes, I followed the recipe as printed.  The footnote did not appear on my printed page. The mixture was crumbly, not at all like a cookie dough.  The bars were too crumbly because I added the amount of applesauce as indicated.  They were delicious but instead of bars, I had nothing but crumbs.  I went back on-line and saw that I was supposed to have something that resembles cookie dough.  The next time I will leave the almonds a bit chunkier instead of processing them like flour.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfectly. It was not dry or crumbly. My husband thought maybe it was under cooked especially in the middle, but after reading the note at the bottom I think it turned out right. Definitely a keeper. It's great for a healthy sweet dessert.

I added more coconut milk to help with the consistency, but found it still a bit dry.  It does have that unique taste that keeps you wanting another piece.

I just made this and the taste is good but it's way too dry.... Very hard to swallow.
