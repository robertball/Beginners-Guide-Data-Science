I used boneless pork chops and omitted the salt and these turned out perfect!  They were very juicy and flavorful and they were plenty enough salty from the bouillon alone (I think they would have been much too salty with the extra 2 tsp. salt).  At the end of cooking time I removed the chops from the pan and thickened the juices with 3 tablespoons cornstarch mixed with 3 tablespoons cold water and it made a nice, thick, brown gravy that had a very good flavor.  I served the chops and gravy with mashed potatoes and broccoli spears.  This was a delicious, easy meal that I would definitely make again!

This is a great way to cook pork chops fork tender.  I did a variation on this.  I used rosemary and thyme instead of sage because it was all I had.  I also cut out the salt in favor of fresh garlic.  I used "Better Than Bouillon" in a jar at most grocery stores, instead of dry cubes because it is more of a beef stock reduction than regular cubes.  I also used 1 1/2 inch thick chops and reduced the simmer time down to 30 minutes.  Tender tastey and a hit!

These were really really good. The 3rd time I made them, I used 1 tsp salt instead of two, 1 tsp of sage PER chop (i like sage,can ya tell?)   beef broth, 4 whole cloves of fresh garlic and I cut up 1 medium yellow onion. I took other users advice and thickend it up with 3 tbs corn starch and 3 tbs cold water. Came out awesome! Thanks!
Edit* After going back after several months and reading reviews after I made this one, I would recommend timing your cooking to the thickness of the chops. It seems the thinner ones will dry out and you might need to cut back on the frying/cooking time, Just a suggestion!

Best and Easiest Pork Chops Ever! Instead of using the bouilion cubes, I just poured a can of beef broth (reduced sodium) over the chops.  I had 3 boneless and sauteed them for 5 min per side then added the broth and simmered for 25 minutes.  Added 3 TB cornstarch and 3 TB water mix to broth after removing pork chops.  Made the best gravy ever.  Will make this a stable in our home.

I used boneless chops and only cooked them for 1/2 hour.  Even that was too long.  Had it been any longer, they would have been inedible.  I recommend browning for 3 minutes per side, then cooking on the low setting for 15 or 20 minutes.  Check the inside of the meat at that point.  45 minutes cook time seems completely unreasonable, unless the chops are super thick or you prefer  them dry as the desert.  I did not like the overwhelming sage flavor, which comes across better as a more subtle flavor in most meats, I think.  After reading the reviews, I didn't use any salt at first, but then added 1/2 teaspoon or so after tasting.  I doubled the water and bouillon mixture because I needed more gravy.  I added 2 tablespoons and 1 teaspoon corn starch to thicken the gravy after removing the meat.  The gravy was wonderful, but I will not prepare the meat again without reducing the cook times and sage.

GREAT recipe! I substituted 1 tsp. garlic powder for the 2 tsp. salt, used chicken bouillon because I didn't have  beef, and used Smart Balance instead of regular butter/margarine. Came out delicious! I made the gravy with
cornstarch and water and it was the icing on the cake!  My husband and my 4-year-old practically inhaled it! This recipe is definitely a keeper! Thanks Tiffany!

My family loved these pork chops!! I had no problem with the salt content. Then again, I did use really thick pork chops. However, if you would like to change the amount of salt. You can buy low sodium boullion. I will definitely be making this again.

This was a nice simple way to fix pork chops.  They were not what I would call exceptional, but they were good.  Cutting back on the salt is a must.  I only used 1/4 t. in the rub and used low sodium chicken broth for the sauce.  I thought that made the salt content perfect.  I also used a little cornstarch and water to thicken the sauce.  It was good over garlic mashed potatoes.  
The sage did add a little extra flavor to both the meat and sauce.  Next time I will try adding some onions to the sauce.

It was good and I will try it again - I only had thin chops so I cut down the cooking time and I used canned beef broth rather than having to play with the water and cubes and it worked out fine.  I also followed other viewers suggestions and sauted some onions and mushrooms. Served it with mashed potatoes using the gravy from the chops.  Next time I will use thicker chops and I think what I now consider a good recipe might be a great recipe.  It's a keeper.

These were very tasty.  I used beef broth, and I will also be cutting the salt next time.  I thickened the broth and added about a cup of light sour cream, which made a great sauce for these very tender pork chops.

i gave this a 4 since i changed a few minor things. i used 3 thick boneless pork chops. i mixed the sage with about 1/2 tsp of thyme, garlic powder and onion powder. i also cut the salt in half.i rubbed this mix into the chops and let that sit on the chops for about 15 mins. i browned the chops in 1 tsp of butter and 1 tsp of olive oil. i would suggest not using a non stick skillet to brown the chops so you get a nice crust on them. i used my cast iron skillet. after browning i also threw in some sliced onion into the skillet to caramelize them.then took chops out, added 1 cup of beef stock, scarped up the bits and put chops back in. cooked them for about 30 mins and they were delish! they were so tender and the spice did not overpower the meat. i was unsure of this recipe when i first looked at it but i am so glad i tried it! this is going into my rotation for sure! served it with cheddar mashed potato bake from this site and a cucumber/tomato salad and fresh homemade bread. thanks tiffany for the recipe.next time i might thicken up the sauce to make a gravy. try this one..i doubt you will be disappointed!

This was very tasty.  I sauteed an onion with garlic in butter.  Rubbed pepper and sage on the pork chops.  I omitted the salt as there was enough in the bouillon.  Browned the chops in butter and added them to my onion garlic sautee along with the bouillon.  When they were done I took them out and made a gravy with cornstarch.  These were amazing.  Thanks for sharing.

Very tasty and flavorful. I used fresh sage along with one garlic minced. I cut down on the amount of salt to 1 tsp. I seasoned and rubbed the pork chops with salt, black pepper, sage and garlic. I let it sit for a little while. In the skillet I added 1T butter with a little olive oil, heated it up. Added pork chops and fried until golden brown before flipping to the other side. When they were done I placed the pork chops aside and added 1/4 cup of white wine to the skillet and combined the brown bits with the wine well, letting it heat up. I mixed 2T of cornstarch along with beef broth and added it to the skillet to thicken up and make a gravy. I added the pork chops back in the skillet and let it simmer for about 25 to 30 minutes, until it was done. It was so tasty, juicy, and so flavorful. The sage really came alive in this dish especially in the gravy. Using fresh herbs makes such a huge difference in taste and flavor. I am glad that I did not add the 2 tsp of salt called for because I had a feeling it would have been way too salty and unedible. This dish went well with the, Garlic-chive Mashed Potatoes," also from this site. Will be a definite repeat again.

We really enjoyed these pork chops. Salted chops individually then added sage and pepper. Browned in equal parts butter and olive oil. Used beef flavored "Better than Bouillon" (it's gluten-free). After removing the chops thickened the sauce with cornstarch/water mix. The sauce became a wonderful gravy to pour over the chops and would be outstanding over mashed potatoes (trying to stay low-carb so no potatoes for now). Sweetheart had left-over pork chop with eggs for breakfast and said it was better than at dinner last night. We will definitely be making these again. Thanks so much for a wonderful new way to make pork chops.

I only gave 4 stars because of the salt. Why didnt I read the comments before I added the salt? live and learn. I will try these chops again without the salt. I made gravy with the drippings, but it was to salty so I added honey which helped a little. definetely try this easy recipe.

Very, very good recipe. I did have thin pork chops so as previous reviews noted I did cook them at a shorter time (15-20 min) They were tender nice and juicy.

very good! I made a few adjustments after reading the other reviews and one major change was that I began this on the stove and transferred it to the oven to cook for an hour on 400'. To reduce the impact of the salt I added sliced potatoes on top of the chops before baking and topped it all with cracked black pepper & parmigiana regiano. delicious!

Wow! Is something this easy really supposed to be this good?  I also cut back the salt by 1 tsp, but added a dash of garlic salt and 2 dashes garlic powder to the rub, then let the meat rest for about an hr in fridge. Used 1 T butter & 1 T EVOO & also used a can beef broth ......this will be made again & again in this house...Good advice with the 3T cornstarch & water...perfect gravy for the 'taters.

Truly the most moist pork chops I've ever made! Easy, too! Like others, I omitted the salt from the rub. I also took a reader's advice, and made gravy by combining 3 Tbs of corn starch, and 3 Tbs of water. Mix and then pour in saucepan after you remove the chops. Raise heat to high, and gravy in 2 mins. Definitely a repeat recipe!

Boy, talk about easy & tasty (which + 5 stars in my book anyday)!  I also cut the salt to 1/4 tsp. and used "L.B. Jamisons'" beef flavored soup base, which is what I sub for beef bouillon and they turned out fantastic!  I also took the advice of "Wimsey" and carmelized onions and some baby portabellas before browning the chops.  If I had the energy, I would have made a gravy with the extra "broth"....maybe next time.  Thanks for the great recipe Tiffany!

Omitted the salt because of the amount of sodium in the the beef bouillon, and used four cups of water as the instructions on the box of cube beef bouillon. One cup of water as the recipe suggest would dry out I'm sure, as other reviews complained about.  I also used Olive oil to brown the chops instead of the butter to make things  a little healthier.  Used four chops instead of six chops because it was larger chops that I had on hand.  I cooked the chops as the recipe directed and they were absolutely one of the best recipes I have tried.  Goes great with Garlic mash potato, and some asparagus, onion and fresh mushroom.  Super tender and tasty.  Will be making this recipe again but next I will make a gravy from the leftover broth as some other reviewers suggested.  Thanks for the simple but great recipe.

I used boneless pork chops for this recipe and only one bouillon cube, omitting the extra salt. (Had I used two it would have been much too salty.) After adding a little bit of garlic powder and cooking them until I got the perfect color (looking at the recipe I was a little skeptical.)The end result tasted graet, and I will definitely make this again.

They sure are easy to make and tasty, but not spectacular. I'm not sure how the beef stock helps in the overall taste of the dish though... good recipe for a weeknight dinner.

This recipe seemed to simple to deserve the glowing reviews.  It was however very good.  Rather than dirty a second pot for the bouillon and water, I added the water and some beef flavor base to the fry pan, and, following the advice of another reviewer, thickened the broth with cornstarch. This made a nice, dark, tasty gravy, perfect for mashed potatoes.

Great recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly. I didn't have beef bouillon so I used beef broth instead. I also cut back the salt and only used 2 pork chops. My boyfriend and I love sage so I kept the seasoning measurements the same despite only using 2 chops and it turned out amazing. 

I took the advice of other reviewers and added 3 tablespoons of cornstarch to 3 tablespoons of cold water and mixed that into the sauce to make a gravy. I'd never attempted a homemade gravy before and it turned out amazing. It was a little on the salty side but that's probably my fault because I didn't use reduced sodium beef broth. 

All in all, we will be making this again.

Good recipe and deceptively simple.  I only used 1/2 tsp of salt and it was enough.  I also added cornstarch at the end to make a gravy but next time I'm going to use flour instead because it was unattractively gelatinous.  It all tasted good though and with inch-thick chops, the moisture and texture were just right.

VERY NICE!  I used thinner pork chops and cooked for less time.  After reading some reviews, I decided not to add salt.  It could always be added later if needed.  I still found the results very salty but Hubby did not.  It had to have come from the bouillon.  I think the addition of onions would have made this even better.  Next time I think I'll substitute the bouillon and water with pork gravy.  Thank you Tiffany Nixon for sharing such a VERY NICE recipe!

I made these as written, and they were very good. I'll probably decrease the amount of salt and pepper next time. I followed the suggestions of others and made a gravy out of the sauce after removing the chops from the pan by adding 2 tbsp of flour and adding cold water until it looked right. Served with broccoli and roasted red potatoes.

Absolutley delicious! I made two pokchops planning on taking one of them in for lunch tomorrow but I ended up eating both of them for dinner! FANTASTIC. I took the leftover broth, thickened it with some flower and mixed it right into the mashed potatoes as I whipped them. Wonderful!

I can't understand how this recipe has a 5 star overall rating as it is written. There is WAY to much salt in this recipe and I love salt! In order to salvage dinner I dumped out half of the *gravy* and added 1 additional cup of plain water to cut the salt along with a cup of sour cream and 1/4 of white wine. Without the changes there would have been no way my family would have been able to tolerate the salt. I would definately recommend removing all salt from the rub as the meat absorbs the salt from the bullion. It was a decent meal after the changes. I also thickened the gravy with 3 TBS cornstarch and 3 TBS of water.

Very good!  The chops ended up tender and tasty!  I mostly followed the recipe, except I used a cup of reduced-sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon (thus avoiding the extra salt problem -- you can always add more at the end), and I sauteed onions, mushrooms, and a couple cloves of garlic, chopped, along with the pork chops.

My family loved these! They were soooooo easy, and turned out very tender, juicy, and flavorful. Make sure in the browning step you are only browning them, not trying to cook all the way thru, or they will be overdone. Great recipe!!

Using the 2 teaspoons of salt seemed a bit much for my taste..maybe use a little less, or none at all while cooking. I also quartered cleaned mushrooms and added to chops for the last 10 minutes of cooking. A wonderful addition to this meal!

My hubby & I aren't huge pork chop fans, but this recipe is wonderful! The kids love it too. The flavor is absolutely divine, and due to the way its cooked the meat is juicy and tender. Definitely give this a try!

Wow.....can't believe I forgot to rate these!  I've made them several times, and every time is a real winner.  They're easy, and the result is a very tender chop with a tasty sauce.  I do like to use more sage than called for, but we love the flavor of that herb.  It's a real keeper...thanks!

These are so good and so delicious. Very easy, but they do take a bit of time to actually cook. We have fresh sage in our garden that is perfect to use. Also, use a can of beef broth instead of the boullion. I personally prefer the taste and ease.

As some other reviewers stated, omitting the added salt would have greatly improved this dish. As it was, having followed the recipe, it was EXTREMELY salty. In the future we will omit the added salt and use a low sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon.

This is a great recipe!  The pork comes out super-tender and moist.  I didn't have the beef bouillon so I used chicken stock.  The stock was plenty salty so I omitted the salt as well.  I think I over-peppered it because there wasn't a ton of sage flavor, but the pepper tasted great with it too.  I created the gravy with the pan drippings and that was perfect with it.

I love love loved these pork chops.  They were so easy to make.  I took others advice and added the cornstarch and water to make a nice gravy at the end, it was such a good idea.  The gravy comes out nice and tasty! No salt needed on the chops even though the recipe calls for it, the bouillon gives it all the salt it needs.  I also just added a touch of rosemary to the chops and some onion.  Overall a wonderful recipe that my husband ate up, literally, and I will be making again!!

Wow!  Really good.  I will leave the salt out of the rub next time- and maybe use low sodium bullion because I did make gravy out of the drippings (for potatoes- pork didn't need any) and it was too salty.  But the chops were so tender and had a ton of flavor.  reheated the next day in microwave and was just as good!

I made the recipe pretty much as stated, but with 3 pork chops, and it was a bit salty, so I stretched out the gravy with another 1.5 cups of water and another tablespoon or so of butter, thickened with flour, and poured it over rice - it was delicious! The sage is definitely not overpowering, as other reviewers said. I actually used a tablespoon of softened butter to mix with the spices and rubbed it over the chops before cooking. Don't forget to brown the chops on high heat to avoid drying them out later during simmering!

I read some of the reviews about too much salt, and adjusted it somewhat, and they just ended up being bland.  May not try again, but I would probably follow the recipe as written next time.

Delicious.  I added more sage, simmered for 30 minutes, not 45- perfect.

Maybe I have weird taste-buds? This was a bland recipe to me. It doesn't have a lot of flavor. No WOW factor. I doubt I'll make it again.

I have made a few changes but now LOVE this recipe. 1) I add a teaspoon or two of garlic powder; 2) I at least double the bouillon and use this for gravy, 3) my chops only need about 25 or so minutes to cook. You do not want to overcook these chops. It may seem odd to use beef broth with pork (I thought so anyway) but you will be pleasantly surprised.

I have made this recipe at least 20 times and couldn't be more pleased. I have never found a more moist pork chop recipe than this! The tweeks I have made to this recipe over the years of making it include: adding dried thyme to the herbs at the beginning (SO GOOD!), only using 8 ounce thick pork chops, and doubling the liquid.

These were a nice change from regular old pork chops.  I used boneless chops, and in place of butter substituted for olive oil.  I don't get the bouillon cubes, but instead use the loose powdery kind.  Instead of wasting a pot on the stove top, I run the tap water until it gets very hot and then fill my Pyrex measuring cup up with the hot water.  I mix the bouillon in and it dissolves nicely without the extra clean-up.  I'd definitely recommend this recipe.

Made as stated this time and would definetley use less salt in the rub next time I make it. Will do as suggested by others and decrease salt. Also adjust cooking time if you have thinner chops.

Wow, this was amazing! I think my husband said at least three times how good it was. I will definately try to use cornstarch to make a gravy next time and I did the recipe exactly the way it calls and next time I won't use as much salt.

Was a good and simpl meal for a  weeknight. I used 4 thick bone in chops, and before I added bullion I deglazed the pan with about 1/4 cup of sherry cooking wine, But I think any cooking wine could be used here. Thicken with cornstarch and it makes a great gravy.

I'm not a big pork chop fan, but these turned out great. I didn't use salt in the rub since so many other reviews complained of saltiness, and I used boneless pork chops. I browned them for 5 mins on each side and then cooked them in the broth for 15 minutes and they were already done, so be careful if you're using boneless chops. I also made the gravy recommended with 2 TBS of cornstarch and 2 TBS water along with a little fresh sage and it was awesome. This will be a staple from now on!

I made these tonight with very thick pork chops. I only simmered them for 30 minutes. They were amazing! When I make them again I will omit the salt. Very salty but whatever. I thickened the gravy with corn starch. I also used thyme instead of sage because I didn't have any on hand.

Simple and yummy! As others have suggested, I sauteed onions and mushrooms before browning the chops. I added them back in when simmering with the beef broth to infuse the flavors. Be careful to modify cook times based on the size of your chops. Mine were less than 1" thick (boneless) and I probably could have browned for 3-4 min per side and simmered for 45 mins. With browning the full 5 minutes per side, they were done (and a little dry) after 20 min of simmering. The meat thermometer is key!

I found the sauce too salty - i think  perhaps my stock was to blame!  However I quickly cored an apple cut into eight and added when cooked I drained off the remaining liquid and added some half fat creme fraiche.  It was delicious the meat was cooked to perfection.  I served it as recommended with roasted vegetables.  Everyone thought it was delicious.  Even with my hasty modifications.

Great recipe, but it definitely needed a bit of a kick to it.  I made it for my boyfriend and he not only fell in love with it but asked me to make it for his mom!

While the bullion was cooking, I added a tbsp of minced garlic.  The bullion by itself was way too bland (just salty).

I cut back on the salt, added more sage and also added a italian seasoning and paprika and put all the spices in a plastic bag.  I put the pork chops in the bag and rubbed the spices all over the chops.

I seared the spiced pork chops on both sides before adding the buillion and simmering for a few minutes.

The added spices and garlic made all the flavors pop out.  Yummy!

I rated this recipe 4 stars as-is, but with the add-ins it's definitely a 10.

I took the suggestion to make more of the salt/herb mixture for my chops(with a little less salt). I used western style pork chops and everything tasted great. I took these "easy-to-make" chops to my in-laws for dinner and they said that it was really nice. This was the first time that I cooked with sage and was pleased with the outcome.

I loved this.  I carmelized a large onion and added a large teaspoon af chopped garlic toward the end of the carmelization.  I added this to the broth and cooked it for the 45 mins.  It was so good we had it again the next night!

These were very good, and very easy.  I think the next time I make them, I'm going to add some mushrooms, and maybe some onions, possibly some wine with the bouillon, just to see how it works.  Great "building blocks" recipe, though!

This was an excellent recipe. I didn't use any extra salt for the rub. I also added a package of chopped mushrooms the same time I added the bouillon. I did remove the chops and thicken the sauce with cornstarch in water (3 T of each). The one mistake I made was overcooking the chops. I had thin, bone-in chops and they could have cooked for a much shorter time. This was very good with garlic mashed potatoes and peas.

I had six 1/2" boneless loin chops. As others suggested, I cut back the salt by half. I added 2 cloves of minced garlic to abt. a cup of beef stock and heated in the microwave. After consulting the otherwhitemeat.com website I decided to brown the chops over medium high heat for 1 minute on each side. Added the hot broth, covered tightly and simmered for 8 minutes. They seemed done but I let them go 2 more min. to be sure. They were very thoroughly cooked but still tender and flavorful. Served with potatoes and green beans and my family RAVED!  Many thanks!

Very easy and good!  I didn't use very much salt, and not that much bouillon.  I also used boneless pork chops.  I will probably make these again.  The "sauce" left over was good over steamed asparagus.

My whole family (hubby & 4 young kids) really enjoyed this recipe. When I broil/bake pork chops, they often end up dry & tough. These were great - moist and delicious! I followed the recipe except that I used L.B. Jamison's beef flavored soup base instead of bouillon.   I also added the soup base & boiling water directly to the pan I browned the chops in. After the chops were done, I removed them, reduced the sauce & added flour to thicken it. It made good gravy, served with dumplings & roasted asparagus.  Thank you for the great recipe!

I thought these chops were really tasty the second time I made them. However, the first time the salt was way too overwhelming. We actually threw them away. The second time, I cut the salt down to half a teaspoon and they turned out great.

And the lesson for today is: A little sage goes a long way.  Very tastey, and the sage packs a powerful punch, be careful not to overdo it.

I just made this and loved the flavor! My chops were thin so I simmered for 20 mins. And I agree the broth made for an excellent gravy!

These pork chops were so good! When it was time to simmer the pork chops, I added baby carrots and fresh mushrooms and simmered everything together for the full 45 minutes. The dish was wonderful and my husband loved it!!

I used fairly thick boneless loin chops and finished them off in a 325° oven vs on the stovetop. Also used 1/2 chicken, 1/2 beef stock and only used 1/2t salt before browning.  There was quite a little liquid left, I thickened it and it was a tasty gravy.  Great sage flavor, this is a keeper.

These were delicious! The only thing I will do differently when I make them is try less salt. I'm thinking maybe 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 bouillon cube?
or maybe no salt and 2 cubes, since bouillon is already pretty salty?

Excellent recipe.  Thanks for sharing.  I didn't change a thing...  Will make this over and over again.  Sure it would taste great on chicken breasts as well.

My husband let out a little groan when I told him I was making pork chops for dinner...but then he tasted these and was pleasantly surprised.  Even our 14 month old loved them!  Pork chops are usually so dry and tough, but these were moist, tender and flavorful.  Like some other reviewers, I used "Better than Bouillon", left out the salt and increased the amount of sage.  I also thickened the sauce with a mixture of 1Tbsp corn starch and 1Tbsp cold water.

This recipe is the bomb! The taste is fantastic, whether you decrease the salt or keep it the same. I add extra spices and bouillon and add cornstarch (mixed in cold water first) when finished to make an out-of-this-world gravy and serve with potatoes. I use cheap pork chops, like pork sirloin, and they come out very tender every time (when I try it with leaner, whiter meat chops, they just aren't moist). Thanks for my favorite pork chop recipe...EVER!

Notice a lot of comments about salt and time.... Time will definitely depend on bone in or out, if you use a thin "breakfast" style chop or thick cut. Salt- I teach cooking classes on this subject.. Professional cooks only use kosher salt, iodized salt is pure sodium, and so much more refined that you get way more salt flavor as a posed to bringing out the flavor of your food. The type of salt you use makes a HUGE difference. Iodized salt is so bad for you...

Holy WowzaaH!
I never knew!...... 
I never knew how easy it is to make good chops or how tender a pork chop could really be!!  I literally said MMMmmm after every bite.. even my wife and 2 year old loved these... I did use less salt and added garlic powder.....  and as I was gathering the spiced noticed I had just ran out of sage, so I used a bit of thyme... still turned out soo good, and tender.    Used what was left in the pan to make a quick gravy and ended up throwing it all out because we didn't need it. haha!!    
Overall... Super easy recipe and so good.. I'm tempted to go out and buy some more pork chops to make tomorrow :D      Thanks for an awesome recipe.

The taste of these was good, but the recommended cook time for these was WAY to high and left me with tough, overly cooked pork chops.  I will try the rub again, though.

The first time I made this I did as the instructions said except I eliminated the salt.  It was good.  The second time I added some dried minced garlic and and onion to it when it simmered then thickened the juices for gravy.  We liked it the first time but the second time really made the difference.  We don’t eat a lot of salt so this was perfect as it was without that additional salt added.

I made this for dinner last night and my two teenagers said it was the best pork they ever had!  Some of the pics make the chops look like they are carmelized, mine did not turn out that way at all.

Really tasty. I used beef broth instead of bouillon. I would use low sodium beef broth next time. I would also double the broth because it reduces quite a lot. That would help with the dryness. It turned out really well.

Where to start . . .  great meal and everyone enjoy it!  Followed the advise of others, eliminated the salt from core rub spicies and added onions to the pan frying of the pork chops. Served with butter noodles and acorn squash for a fall dinner treat.  Easy. Simple. Delicous.

Trying to avoid shopping for dinner, found 2 thick pork chops in the freezer. Went straight to Allrecipes to see what to do with them. This was the easiest recipe, sounded good, and I had time to cook them the alloted time. My husband loved them! He kept saying how tender they were. I made gravy with cornstarch as suggested by other reviewers. Outstanding. Wonderful flavor. We had mashed potatoes and green beans flavored with butter, garlic, onion powder and a little oregano.

I was very excited to make these but sad to say it didn't turn out well.  I bought two double thick bone-in chops that looked perfect for the ocassion.  I seared the meat for only 3-4 minutes each side getting a nice brown but trying to avoid over doing them with heat.  They ended up chewy and hard to get through.  The sauce added a strange element of flavor that we did not enjoy.  Wished I could have had great results as others but don't think I'll be trying again.

GREAT!  Thank you to all who gave suggestions.  I opted to use no salt... it was perfect!  I used canned beef broth so there was plenty of salt for our test.  Kicked up the pepper too because of our taste.   Hubby LOVED it.  This is a keeper!

The chops were moist and tender. It was my first time cooking it so I suggest skipping salt altogether (from the first step)because the bouillon is already high in salt and use 2 cups of water to 2 bouillon to tame down the saltiness.

Very simple and heeded the warnings of not adding additional salt.  Made gravy at the end by adding cornstarch (1 T.) in cold water (1/4 C) then added some milk to desired thickness.  Was really easy and the kids loved it.  Served with brown rice.

I made these with a rather cheap cut of pork chops (the dreaded "assorted pork chops" on sale for less than $2 lb). Turned out excellent--the pork chops were juicy, the seasoning was just. enough.sage. Good stuff! This was the first recipe I made from allrecipes.com and it inspired me to try more.

This was really close to how I usually make pork chops, but I prefer using either wine (white or red) or even plain water instead of the bouillon.  I think that's just our tastes, though, as I thought it seemed too salty, and I even reduced the salt in the rub by half.  I also reduced the simmering time to about 20 minutes, as I used pretty thinly cut pork chops.

I used 1/2 tsp salt and low sodium beef broth, but it was still a little salty for me.  Otherwise, a great recipe and very easy.  I'll make this again for sure.

The pork chops turned out tender. I think this would be much better if the juices were thickened for a gravy.

So easy! I had 8 thin sliced pork chops so I just barely browned.  Also used "better than boullion" beef base.  I just sprinkled on pepper and sage on both sides of the chops (no salt) and simmered in the gravy for 15 minutes only and they were perfectly done and juicy and tender!  Also thickened gravy with arrowroot! Flavor was great!!

These weren't too bad.  Easy to make.  Mine turned out just a bit salty for my taste, but not really really salty, just more salt than I would have preferred.  I didn't have to cook mine as long .. they were probably thinner than recommended.  Overall not bad.  I didn't give them 5 stars because I didn't think they were an exceptionally great pork chop... but for a good middle of the week-night easy to throw together chop the whole family will eat.. these will do!  :)

I thought I had sage, but I didn't. So, I used italian seasoning instead and put the whole thing in the crock pot for 3-4 hrs instead of simmering in the pan. Dude! It was delicious. And still super tender the next day as leftovers. And I made a gravy out of the broth that was to die for. Definitely a do again. I didn't give 5 stars because I didn't follow the recipe as written.

Great recipe.  I did not have sage, so I use instead fresh thyme, tarragon and rosemary. I had about 12 mushrooms, which I sliced and added to the pan while the pork chops were browning - this was a great addition! I thicken the sauce with 1 T cornstarch dissoved in 2 T of water.
Overall it was a hit with my family  and it's a keeper!  Thank you Tiffany for the recipe (next time I will make it with the sage!)

Quite good, with the following changes: way too salty, I used a premade rub so I cut the bouillon in half; it only cook 15 minutes to simmer and my chops were quite thick; and I added cornstarch with cold water at the end like the others suggested.  Came out excellent, and SO easy!

I made this last night for dinner and we thought it was just ok.  I did make some changes that I do think improved the original recipe.  I cut way, way back on the salt and used beef broth instead of water and bouillon.  I can’t imagine how salty this would have been using 2 t. of salt and bouillon!  The butter would have burned at medium high heat, so I browned my chops in a little olive oil.  I also added a splash of white wine and thickened my sauce with a little cornstarch and cold water.  I used the butter, but not until the end, when I swirled it into my finished sauce.

Awesome recipe. I also omitted the salt and put a little garlic powder into the rub.  Threw some fresh chopped garlic in with the pork and beef broth while they were simmering and also thickened the broth with cornstarch and water like others. Yummy!

5 stars no doubt.  I got the Costco extra thick pork chops.  I dredged them in seasoned flour first.  Then browned them on med-hi heat.  Then added the bouillon, a lid and simmered at lowest setting for 35 min.  Fantastic.  Removed teh pork chops, covered, and turned up the heat to reduce the broth/sauce.  The flour from the chops also helps to thicken the sauce.  Great recipe.  Served with garlic mashed and steamed asparagus.  Quick, easy, Fantastic!

These seemed so simple, I couldn't figure out why they were getting so many reviews but they really are delicious- especially if you add a little Wondra to the pan drippings and make gravy to go along with them. Yum!

This was surprisingly good. I am always in search of the perfect pork chop recipe, and this was a good contender. I used boneless chops, which was my mistake, because my only complaint was that they were a little dry. Bone-in chops probably wouldn't have done this. I did everything else the same except to add a little parsley and garlic powder to the chops, and thicken the sauce up a little at the end with some corn starch. Very yummy! The chops were perfectly tender and had great flavor. I will have to try this one again with bone-in chops. Thanks!

Fast, easy, and tasty.  What could be better for a weeknight meal?  I omitted the salt, and increased the water to 2 cups.  The broth is great for gravy and tastes wonderful with mashed potatoes or noodles.

Mmm!  I cut the salt down by half and added 1 tsp of white sugar.  I also rubbed them with a bit of chopped garlic.  I used chicken bouillon as that's what I had on hand.  I simmered for about 10 minutes because I used boneless chops.  Delicious!

LOVE THESE! I made this for my boyfriend and I, using two thicker chops but kept all of the seasoning measurements the same.  Used about 1c. reduced sodium beef broth in place of water & bullion cube. I was wary cooking for the full time and found 35 minutes to be perfect. Added a little corn starch after I removed the meat and this made a great gravy.  But FYI - I thought the salt was fine but you may want to half it if your not a fan of super salty.

Update: I made these yummo chops again tonight and I substituted a little bit. The first time I made them strictly by the recipe but I didn't have sage this time. I used some season salt, onion powder, garlic powder and S&P. Same cooking method and we were not disappointed. 

(last review)O.M.G. I made these EXACTLY as written. The best pork chops that I've ever had. I'm not a huge pork fan but I've been forced to find new recipes because my husband bought about 40 lbs of pork. I will make these over and over again.

Very good pork dish, I added some fresh garlic and towards the end of cooking time I also added 1/2 cup of heavy cream, made the sauce rich and creamy. Great meal!!!.

Yum!  I made the following changes:  decreased salt by half, added 1 tsp of garlic powder to rub, doubled the sauce, and added 1/2 sliced onion and 1 small can of mushroomss to the sauce.  I took other reviewers suggestions and made a thick gravy by adding a cornstarch/water mixture to the sauce.  Note that it is important to turn up the heat to medium-high and stir constantly when making gravy.

Very good.  After reading the reviews I did not add any extra salt.  And using a sausepan to disslove bouillon??  COME ON!!!  Can you say microwave??  I only simmered the chops for about 30 minutes, but that will depend on the thickness of your chops.  Oh and I used olive oil rather than butter and added onions and garlic to my saute.

Excellent! I made a couple changes as suggested by others. I cut the salt in half and added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder to the spice mix. I also let the chops "marinate" for a couple hours before cooking. My last change was to use olive oil instead of butter and also use only half the amount called for...it was more than enough. I also made gravy. Delish! Hubby went back for seconds so this recipe is already going into regular rotation. A very easy, quick, healthy and flavorful dish. Thanks!!!

We really enjoyed this recipe but had to go with a number of changes which were were mentioned earlier.  I used less than 1/2 the salt called for and added garlic salt to the rub.  I also have fresh sage in the yard so substitued this in but increased the amout to 3 tablespoons.  I also carmalized some sweet onion to add to the simmering chops.  I will probably swithch to canned broth next time since it was still a little too salty for me.  Overall my wife and I liked it more than enough to continue to make.

I used 1" thick boneless chops. I substituted one cup of canned beef broth for the bouillion and water.  Sprinkled lightly both sides of chops with salt, pepper, and sage and then rubbed it in.  Very, very good.  Everyone loved them!  Thanks.

Far too salty, but I'd make it again, without the salt (since the beef bouillon has so much by itself).  I kept having to add water (x3) because it all evaporated and the meat started drying out.

I made this for my family last night.  I used boneless pork chops and thickened the sauce to make gravy.  I used much less salt as previous reviews advise.  I served with mashed potatoes and peas.  The pork chops were a little dry but since we had gravy it wasn't too bad.  I'll probably make again, but maybe not cook as long.  Thanks for the tasty recipe.

Tasty, moist and tender - and easy. I used a total of 3T of butter. Used half to first saute some sliced onions. Removed the onions added the remaining butter and sauteed the chops. Returned the onions to the pan with low sodium beef broth rather than bouillon. Remember also that simmer is not the same as boil! Reheats well in the microwave. Serve over white rice to soak up the liquid.

This recipe came out great! The only changes I made, were to cut out the salt, add a bit of paprika to the rub mix, and instead of using beef bouillon, I used a combo of half beef broth and half cooking sherry. Mmm, mmm, good! I served it with a fresh mixed salad, and garlic-mashed red potatoes. Thanks Tiffany

Good, but I'll try again.  Maybe with a little more sage. I added less because of a few reviews stating that it tasted like sausage.

I'm not a big fan of pork in general, but my husband loves pork chops, so I decided to try this.  It had a very good flavor and even I liked it.  It is definitely on the salty side but I love highly salty foods.  If you don't like salty, you might have to omit the additional salt.  I used boneless thin-sliced pork chops, and they cooked very quickly.  I had to drastically reduce the cooking time.  They got a tad bit dried out, but I think part of that was because my husband got home from work later than expected so they ended up simmering for almost the full 45 min, which was too much with the thin chops.  Overall, would absolutely make them again, minus the additional salt.  =)

Delicious recipe!  Our family has enjoyed this many times.  Sometimes I play with the ingredients...like a bit less salt and a little more pepper.  I also use canned beef broth for the ease.  Love it!!

Me love salt.  Me likey! This will now be in the menu rotation for my family. Seriously though, it was scrumptious. The only thing I found myself having to do differently was doubling the broth because my Sam's Club pork chops were HUMONGOUS.

I loved this. Loved reading the other comments, because they helped me in the sodium part of this recipe. I must say that just need to be careful with the kind of bouillon you buy. I usually buy Goya brand beef bouillon which are very salty. So, I had to reduce to just ½ packet(equals 1 bouillon). But otherwise, this was a great recipe which I will repeat over & over! Thanks!

Super-easy!  Will definitely fix this again.  Having read the other comments, I reduced the salt to 1 1/2 tsp, and decided to try adding about a 1/2 tsp. garlic powder.  Yummy!

I thought this was very tasty and simple to make. My husband walked in and said it smelled great, then he said it tasted great! The only thing I changed was added a little bit of minced garlic.

I made this tonight for dinner and we decided it was a keeper if I used less salt the next time.  I thickened the sauce for a gravy and while everything had a good flavor, it was far too salty.  The rub would be awesome on a roast, but for chops the salt needs to be cut at least in half.

The recipe, as stated, doesn't make enough rub to cover all the pork chops.  I quadrupled all the spices, but that was really too much salt.  I would suggest doubling the salt and quadrupling the rest of the spices.

My favorite pork chops -- ever!! Thanks for sharing.  I used chicken stock instead of water and made gravy out of the left over juices.  Got to go, they are done!!!

Great recipe.  I like salt so no problem with the original quantities.  Gravy was really nice.  Used thick french-cut chops and it was delicious!

This came out nicely.  Pork was tender and the flavor of the sauce was great.

One one: I live at 7,500 feet.... and so braising is tricky.  I used over 2x the broth and low boiled for 60 minutes... that's just the kind of thing we need to do... water boils at about 185 F here. The only problem is that this recipe, using bouillon, is prone to over-saltiness.  Next time I'll use a good beef broth and halve the salt in the rub.

OMG!  Seriously the BEST pork chops I've ever had (and my mother makes awesome ones) but these are amazing!  Easy to make and taste like a million bucks!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!  I didn't make any changes and they were fabulous; definitely will be made at our house over and over again.

Kids enjoyed it.... I also cut down on the salt and made a gravy with the water/bouillon mixture at the end for mashed potatoes.  Simple, easy. Will do again.

Great Recipe! I have trouble doing a really good moist pork chop.  These ones are great.  I had a pack of about 8 chops that I used.  I added garlic and onion powder to the sage and salt.  (they are my staple seasonings, i use them on everything)  I also doubled the sauce to make sure there was plenty, and there was.  I added 3 Tbsp of cornstarch to 3 Tbsp water, like another review suggested to thicken the sauce.  I guess I should have used more because I had double the sauce.  Even though the sauce was kinda thin, it was still very flavorful and was great over pasta.  My husband even enjoyed the meal cold when he got home a few hours after it was done.  I think I'm making it again tonight for dinner.  Yum!

Everyone loved these chops. I  browned chops for 10 mins each side, we like the crunch & substituted the bouillon for half a can of beef broth & simmered for only 20 minutes covered. I made brussel sprouts & couscous for side dishes and it all went well together

This is an incredible tasting and incredibly easy recipe! I used a fraction of the salt though. I don't like salty food and the beef bouillon provides plenty of salt to begin with. My husband loved it and so did my two young children.

this recipe was alright but I found it too salty with the salt and bullion.  I'll probably omit the salt when I make it next time! Served with twice baked potatoes and asparagus.

Didn't have enough sage, so I made 2 with pork rub, 2 with rosemary and 2 with sage...all turned great. Cooking with the bouillon and cover kept the meat tender and moist.

We LOVED this recipe!!  Absolutely wonderful.  I doubled the broth part so we would have more gravy, which I thickened with cornstarch/water.  It was such a simple recipe but tasted like a complicated one.  :-)  I'll make this one over and over again.

Great!  Def a little salty, and I love salty foods!  I used one Tbsp and it was still too much.  I also substituted "Better than Bullion" in place of the cubes, and added 1 Tbsp each of onion and garlic powder.  Served with french style Green beans and garlic mashed potatoes... superb!

I'd never made gravy before, and thanks to all the tips in the reviews, I did successfully last night!  Also, having Omaha Steak chops really helped!

Yum!! Had some pork chops I needed to cook up and was looking for something completely different from the Portobello pork chops I had the night before.  Followed the recipe except for some suggestions I read in other reviews. I cut the salt in half, added a tsp of garlic powder and added some cold water with flour to make gravy from the pan juices...This was so simple and very flavorful! I like salt so it was perfect for me...My man loved how tender this was but for him I could have cut it back to 3/4 teaspoon as he has gotten used to cutting back on his salt. Served with mashed Yukons and steamed asparagus...it was one of the simplest after work dinners I have ever made. I was very nervous about the cooking time but another reviewer pointed out, it doesn't get tender unless you cook it on low for the whole 45 minutes. My pork chops were boneless, I cut off the fat and they were about 3/4 of an inch thick.  This recipe is definatly a keeper!! =)

Wonderful recipe!  I used extra thick pork chops and seared them well (about 3 minutes per side).  Then I tossed them in a 9x9 baking pan for about 20 minutes while I finished the rest of dinner.  My husband loved these.

Very tasty and easy!! I used extra thick boneless chops and threw vegetables (potatoes, carrots, and green beans) in to make it a one pan meal. Just add extra broth and water (you have to use a fairly large pan). The family loved it.

Very tasty!  I used thick cut, boneless chops, the ready made beef broth instead of bouillon cubes and water, and in the end before serving made the drippings into a gravy.  Super tender and a huge hit!  Thank you for sharing!

This was a really great recipe for pork chops rather than my regular recipe which got really sickening fast. I didn't cook my pork chops on the stove top, i placed them in a pyrex casserole dish and marinated them in French's meat marinade, it was excellent!

Great, easy dinner.  I sprinkled salt, pepper, and sage on each side of the chops, used olive oil instead of butter, and used one reduced sodium bouillon cube.  I also only had 3 boneless pork chops, and reduced the simmer time and still could have pulled them out earlier.  I added water/flour to make a thicker gravy and served over egg noodles.  Even the 4 year old liked these.  We eat pork chops 1-2 times a week and will be adding this to the rotation.

Very easy and tasty. Somtimes pork chops can be dry but simmering them in broth made them so juicy. Boyfriend loved as well. Will definitely make again.

After reading other reviews, I decided to also make some gravy out of the juices left in the pan.... I thought it was a little too salty, next time I will just use 1 bouillon cube instead of 2, but other than that I would not make any changes to this recipe! Very easy and super tasty!

I used ground sage, 14.5 oz can of beef broth (had milk in it), and boneless thin chops since that is all I had.  Also, skipped the butter by using a little EVOO.  It was a tad peppery & salty but not bad.  I also took 2 chops out since I made a double batch for my son with allergies and put it in chicken broth which was dairy free and he ate both w/out complaints.

This recipe made the best pork chops I have ever tasted, and they had the most tender texture.  I simmered them in my cast iron skille, and when they were finished I added some flour to the remaining liquid and made gravy.    The only change I made was to use vegetarian bouillon powder instead of beef bouillon cubes, because that's what I had on hand.  I think next time I would probably reduce the salt slightly.    I served them with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.

Very good!  I used poultry seasoning since I didn't have sage and it was excellent!  The juice poured all over it makes it extra delicious.  It's a very easy, low-maintenance dinner.

These came out very moist and a nice change from the usual pork chop. I did not have the beef bouillon but used a pork gravy season packet instead. My kids loved it! I will be using this recipe again.

Excellent Recipe.  I used it for 6 chops as well, but didn't think it was enough seasoning since we like a lot, so I tripled the seasoning and rubbed it on the chops.  Substituted Garlic Salt for the salt. Added about a teaspoon of crushed rosemary. Used 3 cups of the bouillon.  We like a lot of gravy so any less would not have been enough. This was so good, that my 2.5 year old who rarely ever eats the meat, only ate his pork chop and kept coming to me for more bites! :)

Amazingly tender, pretty brown color.. and so salty when prepared according to the recipe that my family promptly dubed then "jerky chops". I have saved a custome version, & plan to make again using low sodium broth or bouillon, and little to no salt.. will update when I do.

This is a pretty good base recipe, but it needs a few changes. First, don't mix the seasonings together (you can't control how much you use). Use the salt, pepper and sage to your taste, seasoning both sides. I added garlic powder and onion powder. Brown the chops in a combination of olive oil and butter (oil gives a higher burning point, butter gives the flavor). I put low-sodium chicken broth, onions and garlic in a baking pan and placed the chops on top. Cover the pan with foil and bake for an hour on 300. The chops are moist and tender and NOT SALTY. Whisk a little cornstarch in the pan drippings for a tasty gravy.

Made this with modifications: omitted salt, but added lemon pepper and lemon zest. My chops were very thin and i think i over-cooked them, so they were a little tough.  These came out VERY spicy, but that was probably because of the modifications I made. For the gravy, i took the chops out of the pan, added about 1/2 c of the beef broth, and then thickened up with flour.  Would definitely do that again!  would like to try again without lemon pepper and thicker chops.  that being said, my 3 year old said they were "tasty" and ate a whole chop with no prompting! : )

These pork chops are TO DIE for! They're so juicy and flavorful! I actually ended up using the amount of seasoning for only 3 pork chops, though, so if you're going to make more, I would recommend doubling the spices. But as is, the recipe is AWESOME! My fiance, who doesn't like pork very much, LOVES these! Totally 5 stars!

Great recipe.  :D  I changed nothing, except to follow another reviewer's advice to add corn starch to the sauce to make a gravy.  This has to be one of the easiest, but most rewarding, recipes I've tried.

Tasty and easy, but could use a little less salt. I didn't have sage, so I used a combination of other dried spices -- plenty of parsley, and a little marjoram, rosemary and italian seasonings. I doubled the seasonings, but next time I will only use 1 tsp. of salt, and 2 tsp of green dried seasonings (sage or a combo similar to what I put above). I put in half an onion and a clove of garlic in the broth simmering, and made gravy out of the broth. Served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. Yummy and so easy, using ingredients on hand!

I've used this recipe several times and have to say.....I doubt I will ever make chops any other way.  The chops always turn out tender and the beef broth makes them taste alot like steak.  Instead of using table salt I use garlic salt.  Also, I let the chops stay in the pan until the broth is boiled down, then the broth makes a nice glaze for the chops.  Love it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Such a simple and easy recipe.  I do use chicken broth instead of cubes. I also take the recipe and tailor it to chicken with basil and thyme. I make a gravy out of the chicken broth with 1-2Tbls corn starch and 1-2 Tbls broth.   Serve over rice, it is great.

I have made a similar version of this for years.  Mine have onion powder and garlic powder in addition to the sage on the chops.  I  use a mixture of chicken stock and water for the cooking liquid, about 1 1/2 cups.   The chicken flavor blends better with the pork.  When done, I remove the chops and thicken the remaining liquid for gravy. Great with mashed potatoes. YUM.

This a great recipe, the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is the cooking time, 3 to 4 minutes a side is sufficient for searing and 25 minutes is enough for simmering unless you like dry chops, and I used 3\4 inch thick chops, but the flavor is awesome! Thanks for the great recipe!

These were soooo good! Extremely easy,as well.   I do recommend cutting the salt back. I used boneless chops as they were on sale. I cooked my chops 3 minutes on each side, and simmered them 30 minutes instead of 45.  I thickened the sauce with cornstarch and added onion and garlic powders, as well as more sage and black pepper.   Wonderful served with rice, egg noodles or garlic potatoes.   This was a huge hit with the family and will be added to our regular line up of quick family meals.

A little too salty for my taste. But I thought this was an easy way to prepare pork chops with ingredients I actually had on hand. I thought it could've used a bit more sage as well.

Not a good recipe at all!  It's much, much, much to salty as written, and the sage flavor overwhelms the taste of the meat.  My pork chops were pretty much ruined, and I ended up eating scrambled eggs for dinner.

This was very good, but still too salty even after the changes I made.  I used boneless chops and low salt canned broth. I cut the salt back to 1 1/2 teaspoons and cut back browning to 3.5 minutes per side and 25 minutes simmering.  I also added cornstarch to the pan after I removed the chops and made gravy.  Chops were nice and moist and it was just the gravy that was too salty.  Next time I will cut the salt back to 1/2 teaspoon, but I will make it again.  My family loved it because it was so moist and I loved it because it was soooooo easy!

I used boneless porkchops, fresh sage, and added onions and garlic to the sauce, didn't salt the meat, and cut down the cooking time...but the meat was VERY tough and though the pork chops were bland, the sauce was very salty...even though I only used one beef bouillon tablet in 2 cups of boiling water (for 4 small boneless porkchops).  My husband said it tasted like bad Chinese food...probably from the MSG from the bouillon cube.  Should have known from the ingredients.

This was an easy recipe and didn't take a lot of time.  I didn't have any dried sage on hand, so I used ground and I also used 1 cup beef broth.  It was very flavorful!  Since my pork chops were boneless and not very thick, it only took about 3 min. each side to brown and then 30 min. to cook.  Very tender and not dry.  Next time I will sautee some mushrooms and onions to top with.

These were fabulous.  I followed the recipe for the most part; I cut the salt down to a teaspoon and used garlic salt instead of regular, and I used beef broth instead of cubes.  These were moist and delicous.  I thought the sage would be overpowering, but it wasn't at all.  I didn't adjust the rub measurements and used it all on two thick pork chops.  I also, like others suggested, made a gravy out of it by adding corn starch.  The chops and gravy were excellent, I highly recommend this recipe.

I'm not a huge fan of pork, but this recipe may have converted me! Just while cooking it, the strong aroma of the sage was enough to make your mouth melt. Though a personal preference, next time I will not use as much pepper.

This is often requested. If doubling the rub go a little light on the pepper. After removing meat from skillet use pan juices to make gravy, I sprinkle a little flour, whisk it around and let it cook, then slowly add more broth. Note - If you use a low sodium broth it will solve the problem some reviewrs found with saltiness. Thanks for sharing a new way to cook pork chops.

I love this recipe -- the pork comes out so tender...I use beef broth and do cut down on the amount of salt.  I have even added some flour/water mixture to make gravy after - then serve it with egg noodles (no yolk noodles are great too) or rice to change it up a bit.

Very good.  Changed it up a little, added a third cup of red wine, fresh oregano, garlic and onion to the beef stock.  Also omitted the salt as there was enough in the stock.  Thickened the sauce with cornstarch and added it to rice.  Very good for the effort.  Simple and tasty.

We loved this recipe!  It is simple and tasty.  I did make a couple of previously suggested recommendations: reduced the salt by half, and added sauteed onion, garlic, 1/4 cup red wine, and oregano to the beef broth.  This will be in the regular rotation.

This is a really good recipe.  I used beef broth instead of the boullion cubes (didn't have any on hand).  I also added some sliced onions and mushrooms with the broth and covered the chops.  I also cooked some roasted red potatoes from this site.   Yummy!!! Will make it again, and again.

This was VERY GOOD! However, I followed the advice of some others and cut the salt in half, and I think it's still too salty. Next time I won't add salt at all. There's enough with the bouillon, I think. I also doubled the sauce and I'll double the sage next time. But overall very good, thanks!!!

My oh my!  These were awesome.  Melted in your mouth, they were so tender. Only change I made was to cut salt to 1/2 tsp and they were still too salty.  If you look at the boullion container you will see that the first ingredient is SALT.  WILL make again, but cut salt out completely

This, by far, was the best pork chop recipe I have ever used.  I took the advice from others and did not use much salt.  I also use boneless chops.  They were moist and tender.  Thank you for sharing

This was a very good pork chop recipe.  I only used 4 pork chops and the same amount of sauce.  Next time I will only simmer for 20 minutes...I simmerred it for 30 minutes tonight and it was over cooked.  I also made a gravy with the sauce.  Great flavor in this recipe.  Yum!

Wonderful!!  So easy to make, and came out VERY moist and flavorful.  I thought it would be too salty just by reading the recipe, so I used only 1 bouillon cube.  It was still a little too salty, so next time I will reduce the salt in the rub to 1 tsp.  I lowered the fat by reducing the butter to 1 Tbl.  No change in flavor!  I was specifically looking for a recipe that didn't make a gravy or contain soup, as I served these with candied sweet potatoes and apples - they were the perfect complement.  This was perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

This one is great!  I made it last night, just for something different, and my kids ate everything on their plate!  And they are picky picky eaters!  I did change a few things, used a can of beef broth, added 1/2 can of water, doubled the rub on the pork, also the juice makes AWESOME gravy!  My hubby even ate the leftovers last night, which he rarely does.

I usually hate cooking pork chops because they come out so tough and chewy.  These chops were fork tender and my 2 picky kids loved them. I even made them again the following night when we had company. I did a couple of things differently.  I didn't have any sage, so I used poultry seasoning & pepper - left out the salt.  I simmered for just 30 minutes and they were done beautifully.  This definitely goes into the monthly dinner rotation!

I made these pork chops on Thursday night and Saturday my husband mentioned how good they were and asked me to make them again on Sunday!!!  I added just a touch of garlic powder to these and they were fabulous!!!  It's great because it's ingredients that you already have in your house...and so easy!

I have to say that I was delighted with this recipe! I did change it a bit using beef broth 14 oz can and adding garlic powder to the rub. Also I found I had to make more of the rub mixture, but that could be because I used thick large porkchops. Added some carmelized onions and mushrooms put on top of pork chops for the last 20 min of cooking. Thickened the sauce with cornstarch paste.  It was a biggg hit with the family!

Great recipe.  I used a huge rack of pork I got from Costco - I cut it into very thick chops.  I didn't use the salt per other reviews and it turned out delicious!  Very juicy! Thanks!!!

I made this recipe for the first of many times months ago. We love it. It can be a little salty, but it is great. I've added garlic and onion powders to the beef broth for some more flavor. I've also added mushrooms from time to time. We love these pork chops. Yummy!

I used 3/4" boneless pork chops and simmered 30 minutes.  VERY tasty, but next time I'll reduce the salt to 1t.  My husband said these were the best pc he's ever tasted.  I served with boiled potatoes -- next time I'll thicken the delicious sauce and serve over mashed potatoes.

I love this recipe and have already made it twice within a short period of time! Like the others, I decreased the salt. Be careful with the amount of sage you rub on the chops until you know how much suits your taste. Also, make sure you thoroughly brown the chops before adding the bouillon in order to lock in the moisture. I didn't brown them enough intially and they were consequentially a bit dry. Other than that, they taste fabulous and go well with stuffing and mashed potatoes!

This turned out really dry and bland, and I used fresh sage too.  Maybe it's because the Japanese pork chops are too lean, but it was barely edible.

Very good if you don't like a sauce to cover up the flavor of the meat.  The pork chops were very tender and delicous.  The only change i made was I only put in a teaspoon salt and I didn't cook it quite as long.

I really enjoyed this recipe. My husband loved it, but I thought it was a little overdone. I'm sure this was my fault since it was a busy night and I used thin boneless pork loin. I would suggest that you reduce cook time to 30 minutes if you're using a thin cut like I did. I also used canned beef broth instead of bouillon and sauteed 2 cloves garlic & 1/4 onion prior to pork sautee and set aside until I added broth. I must say it was a very tasty dish. I'll adjust time or use a thicker cut for next time. Thanks!

This recipe is awesome!  I am not a big fan of pork chops and I have cooked them, maybe about 5 times during my 13 year marriage.  They were always dry, or not enough flavor, or both.  I decided to buy a package this week and give it another try, because they were particularly cheap.  I searched for a recipe on this site and found this wonderful recipe!
The chops I bought were pre tenderized for grilling, so I didn't need or use salt.  I also didn't have the dried sage, so I sprinkled pepper and ground sage to taste.  I browned the chops, removed them, cooked chopped onion in the pan.  Then I put the chops back and cooked them with the beef cube broth.  So good!  My husband said it was the best pork chops ever and he isn't very fond of pork chops either!  My picky kids loved them too!  I never imagined they would have so much flavor with just a few ingredients!  This recipe has a permanent spot with my family!  Thanks for sharing!

Tender Pork Chops! I used boneless pork chops and reduced the cooking time. They had great flavor and a good companion to cooked apples. I took other's advice and reduced the salt and added sliced onions. Thank you for sharing this easy yummy recipe.

This recipe is amazing, who could imagine that so few ingredients would taste so good.  After reading the other reviews I used just under 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/8 tsp ground black pepper, and just under a 1 tsp sage with 1 cup of campbells beef broth.  My chops were quite thick and after simmering for 40 minutes ended up having to add another cup of broth so that I had enough liquid to make gravy for the mashed potato's. I actually think that any kind of broth or combination of broths/juices/wine would work (worth experimenting with).  Wished I would have doubled the recipe, everyone loved them, will definitely make again.

My husband really enjoyed these!  I used 4 bone-in center cut pork chops and omitted the salt as others suggested.  I followed the rest of the recipe to the letter.  When the chops were finished cooking, I removed them from the pan and mixed 1/4 cup of water with 1 tbsp. of corn starch and added it to the beef broth in the pan.  I brought it to a boil and cooked it for 1 minute.  It made a delicious gravy.

I actually loved the flavor, only gave it 4 stars simply bc 45min turned out to be a little too long & they were fairly dry.  I didn't have beef bullion cubes & didn't want to run out just for that so I replaced the water & bullion with 1 cup vegetable broth, 1tsp worstershire sauce & also added 1tsp of Apple butter I made awhile ago & the flavor was incredible. I will Def make again...but keep a closer eye on the chops!  ; -)

This was a flavorful dinner. It was not exceptional, but makes a good weeknight dinner. It's quick and easy to prepare and allows the cook to attend to other dishes while its cooking. As is my routine, I follow the recipe exactly as written the first time I make it. for this dish, I did have to adjust the cooking time since my pork chops were thin. Next time, I may make some adjustments like adding onions and a little more sage to the pot.

I have made this recipe at least once a week for the past year! It is my love's favorite dish. I did make some changes that proved to be good.  I replaced the bouillon cubes and water with a can of beef broth and thickened the sauce with corn starch, it makes a glossy, rich gravy. I also use thick boneless chops and added  minced garlic while sauteing the chops in the butter. It really is a lovely meal.

Quick and tasty, and the gravy tasted great over mashed potatoes. I would add way more sage next time, since I really couldn't taste it, and I love that flavor.

This was so simple and the family gave it two thumbs up!  I prepared them exactly as stated and they were delicious.  Next time, though, I'll use a bit less salt.  Otherwise, they were fabulous!

I have made this recipe twice now.  I have followed the suggestion of others and omit the salt from the rub...with the bouillon cube it really isn't nec to have salt in the rub... I just use sage...pepper & I tried a sm amt of poultry seasoning for the rub....works perfectly.  I also use  enough cornstarch to thicken the liquid left in the pan after cooking the chops to make a gravy.....and I now add a bit of sherry and a touch of cream for a wonderful sauce to top the chops with....family loves it!! Made it along with a simple rice and steamed broccoli... great meal & simple enough for week night dinner.

great flavor, tender when done. Would try gravy/potatoes/stuffing next time or an apple chutney or sweet chili sauce to complement.

Finally a wonderful moist pork chop. I used only 1 teaspoon salt and everything else exactly what the recipe stated. Bouillon has a lot of salt already.  I used unsalted butter because that is what I had open. I could have pulled the chops out at 30 minutes but they would not have been as tender.  45 minutes was perfect for medium thickness chops. Not sure how time will work with thick chops.  After 20 years my husband said I finally found a pork chop recipe that he loves. I normally rotisserie pork roast to keep pork moist and now I finally have and alternate.  I added flour to the pan after removing chops for a bit of gravy that I drizzled over chops.  Not heavy just a drizzle and it was fabulous.  Thank you for this easy yummy recipe.

I've tweaked the recipe around; crush together into a paste 3 cloves of garlic, pinch of salt,  peppercorn, few leaves of sage, thyme, 1tsp mustard seeds, olive oil. Rub on pork chops and fry in 2tbsp butter until one side is slightly brown, turn over then sprinkle over the top chopped onions (1/2 white, 1/2 red), fry until caramelised. Remove chops and 1/2 of the fried onions from pan, add beef stock and boil for couple of minutes with cornflour to thicken, amazing gravy...and voila chopsters are ready!! I served them with mashed potato&swede and broccoli..

I am not a fan of bouillon cubes. I subbed a small amount of no sodium broth mixed with maybe a tablespoon of packaged beef gravy for 2 medium thickness bone-in pork chops. I added a small onion and sliced garlic to the gravy. Simmered on LOW for the 45 minutes produced a tasty, moist chop. I also use a quality butcher meat- You get what you pay for when it comes to meat!! That's a fact jack!!!

These were really tasty. I used olive oil instead of butter for a healthier fat and omitted the salt. When the pork chops were finished cooking, I removed them from the liquid and added in a couple of tablespoons of corn starch. I let it simmer for a few minutes until thickened for a yummy sauce and served it all over a bed of rice.

I leave out the sage and use ground white pepper instead of black pepper.
I also use half the butter and only use enough water to barely cover the chops completly. I simmer them on low for about an hour and 15 min. I have been cooking them like this for over 35 yrs and everybody just loves them this way. Another option is to add a can or two of cream of mushroom soup but use less water.

I have been making these pork chops for years for my family of 6 boys. It's a regular in our house, even a meal they request for their birthday dinner! I have used bone in and boneless chops, always with fantastic results! A must try for everyone!

My father-in-law normally eats without much comment, but he said it was one of the best pork chops he had ever had.  I was so happy to have stumbled across this recipe.  Easy to make but tastes like you've slaved away in the kitchen all day.

I have a hard time liking anything made with pork these days, because it rarely has much flavor, at least not the flavor I'm used to from many years ago.  Having said that, I made this recipe tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  In addition to being tender, moist, and very flavorful, it was incredibly easy to make.

I can't say I disliked them but not sure if I thought they were anything special. My sauce was way too salty for one thing. I would use beef broth if I made them again and forget the bouillon. They were moist but I was careful not to overcook them. I probably would not make these again. I love sage so that wasn't it. Just didn't think these were anything to "write home about", sorry.

This was great.  I rubbed with roasted garlic, rosemary and montreal chicken seasoning.  I needed to make ahead of time due to a busy softball family so I just let the chops soak in the broth while we were gone and then heated it up when we got home.  Very flavorful and moist.  A keeper!

This was so good.  I cooked it exactly like the recipe read, except for I used fresh sage because I didn't have any dried.  Served it over sauerkraut and it was delicious.

I did not care for this recipe. Way too bland! The meat was tough and dry, even after following some of the other reviewer's advice of cutting the simmering time down. I won't be making this again.

These needed a lot more spices than was in the recipe. I had to brown in batches as even my biggest skillet was too small. No problem. I was able to work them in together during the simmer. Unfortunatley, I didn't have any beef boullion so used chicken instead. It was okay, just not really special. I did add about a TBS of cold butter in the sauce after removing chops from skillet to make a bit of sauce to go over the chops. I know that upped the calories, but wasn't much split 6 ways and added a lot of flavor spooned over the chops and the roasted potatoes I fixed with them. I would like to try making them again increasing the sage and salt and pepper and using the beef boullion.

I followed the recipe exactly since this was my first time making it. I cooked this in my new ceramic lined frying pan so they would not stick.  They turned out awesome!  I highly recommend first trying it per the directions.  You may not want to make any changes the second time around.

These pork chops were very tasty, but in the future I will omit the salt and reduce the number cubes of beef bouillon (a tad salty). I may also reduce the cook time a bit. With those modifications I think it will suit my tastes well.

I used boneless chops and, at the last moment, realized I didn't have bouillon so dumped in a packet of beefy onion soup mix.  While one might argue that the onion might overpower the sage, no one in my household was complaining.  They were too busy eating!  Yum!  Will make again.

This was really good. I did what others said and took the pork chops out and added corn starch mixed with cold water to the sauce to make it thick. I also didn't add salt and the saltiness was perfect.

I loved this recipe, but I am glad I took the advise of a lot of the reviewers.  I cut the salt way down to about half a teaspoon.  I split the sage in half and added half a teaspoon of thyme to even out the strong flavor of the sage a bit.  I used three boneless chops, but still needed an extra bouillon cube to give it the right flavor.  With three boneless chops, I only needed a 25 minute cook time and they turned out perfectly tender.

When I was done, I was even able to take the leftover broth and make it into gravy for potatoes with just a few teaspoons of corn starch and a little extra water, and that was some pretty good gravy.

As is, this recipe is okay. It was way too salty for my taste, but I should have suspected this beforehand and adjusted accordingly. Would make again, but without the added salt.

A tasty variation on Pork Chops. Like many here I cut down on the salt in the rub and used a can of low sodium beef stock. The cook time given seems like it is for very thick chops. Mine were done much quicker. I also deglazed the pan and made a gravy. It was quick easy and very good.

Used boneless pork chops and followed directions entirely, and when ready to serve, looked very dry. The flavor was good, but they had cooked way too long. I would suggest cutting the cooking time down by half and work from there....

I bought some rather thinly sliced chops, so I knew there was a danger of getting them overdone/dry/tough.  I used Smart Balance cooking oil instead of butter and seared them at very high heat for only 2 1/2 to 3 minutes on each side.  I have discovered when cooking meat in liquid that it is less likely to dry out and get tough if the liquid is thickened and kind of gloopy.  I increased the amount of water by about a cup, added more buillion, and put in a tablespoon of guar gum ( a thickener found in health food stores), so that before I ever started simmering the chops the gravy was thickened.  I also found it necessary to make a lot more of the sage rub than what the recipe called for.  The chops were very tender and good when they were done.

Hubby and I enjoyed this recipe.  i took the advice of others and cut down the salt to 1/2 tsp and used one can of beef broth instead of the boullion cubes.  I carmelized onions in butter before adding pork chops to the skillet. After chops were done I used remaining juice for gravy which was fabulous!

Hubby and I just made these, and the chops gets 4 stars.  They were a bit dry even though we cooked them for 30 minutes.  We added baby bella mushrooms to the chops and let them cook the entire 30 minutes.  We didn't add salt at all based on other reviews and we're glad we didn't.  I think I also used a little too much sage, but it was still pretty good. However, we did make gravy out of the drippings as other reviews recommended, and it was amazing.  We took the chops out of the skillet after the 30 minutes, left the mushrooms in there, then added flour until it became thicker.  Served with roasted potatoes that had been mixed with rosemary, onion powder, black pepper, and olive oil--absolutely amazing!  Will make again, but not cook as long. :)

These pork chops were very good.  I used beef broth instead of the bouillon.  I used boneless pork chops and they were a little dry.  I think next time i won't cook them quite the full 45 minutes.  I'll just check for doneness with a meat thermometer.  But this recipe is definitely a keeper!

I am not a huge pork chop fan, but I had to eat these as they smelled so good. My husband absolutely loved this! I did double the sauce spices and ingredients so we could have a gravy with it, but really this is a great easy recipe.

Very flavorful recipe. I cut out the salt the second time around. It was still salty, only because I misread the instructions for making the beef broth. I simmered two butterfly chops for about 80-90 minutes on the stovetop and they were falling apart. In the rub, I used garlic powder and onion powder and it worked just fine.

I agree with many posts. Too salty. Reduce salt by 1/2 and its pretty good.

Quick and easy.  I agree with those who say a bit less salt.  I slow cooked for only 35 min so as not to over cook as some recomended.  I added garlic and onion slices.  Serve with mashed potatoes and a veg for a week night dinner.

These were so delicious , I used the sage , etc . but next time will use a low sodium beef bouillon as it was a bit salty for my taste.  Since I only made 2 I did not cook for 45 min. , instead cooked for about 15 since they were already browned .  I also added some Wondra flour to the beef cubes and made a nice gravy for mashed potatoes , loved it .  so easy and so quick.

Awesome flavor - NO need to add the 2 t. of salt as the bouillon adds more than enough. At the end, I took the chops out of the broth and thickened it up with a dash of cornstarch. I also added a few garlic cloves at the beginning.

These were some delicious pork chops. I did however do some of my own substitutions, such as 2 tsp. dried sage, 1 1/2 tsp black pepper, 2 tsp dried rosemary and 2 tsp. parsley. I was also cooking 10 pork chops instead of 6. :) thanks for the recipe

I made this last night and it was awesome. I could not for the life of me find sage at my supermarket so i bought oregano instead. It turned out fabulous so much flavor. Makes me wonder what it would have been like with sage. But definetly gonna be a staple for porkchops in my kitchen.

*Update* I make these ALL THE TIME. It's so simple. I just put the sage, some salt, pepper, and minced garlic in a bowl and then spread it on top of the chops. I grill them and they're SO GOOD! 

This was really great!! My husband said it was the best seasoning he's had on a pork chop. I used 2 thin pork chops with the bone. I added some garlic powder to the salt, sage, and pepper. Instead of using a boullion (I didn't have any), I used 1 cup of low sodium beef stock. My chops were very thin so I only had to cook them for about 20 minutes. They were so tender and moist, I really enjoyed them. Next time I might thicken the sauce up with some cornstarch for a nice gravy over the top. Thanks for the great, simple recipe!!

Best pork chops. I reduced the boullion to one cube and this was plenty of flavour. Juicy and tasty. A very cheap, easy dinner that smells incredible while it cooks.

I have made this type of recipe for years, from my mother.  Instead of bouillion I use packaged french onion soup and water; cook 20 minutes, then add 1/2 c of regular rice and cook 20 minutes more.  Delicious!

My family does the Sunday dinner thing......and I have come to dread hosting it since returning to work full time.  The idea is the extended group coming together each week- not to be about the food- but it has become that way (smile).  I search for something easy, but memorable. In this dish, I have found it!!!!  I followed recipe exactly with the exception of using boneless pork chops and better Than Boullion Beef Base.  Everyone from Grandpa to my 8 year old raved.  I had 16 people and EVERY SINGLE one ooooooh'd and ahhhhh'd.   Definitely make the gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and broccoli like in the picture....this was the easiest and best dinner I have made n a long time.  This is truly a keeper!!!!!!!

Excellent pork chops.  I have made them twice now and they are so juicy and tender.  My boyfriend is crazy about them too.  They are so simple.  I think the only thing I need to change is to get a different skillet.  The one I have now is cast iron and my apartment has an electric stove, so it can make things difficult.

Hubs said this was the best pork chops ever.  I omitted the salt, but then decided it did need a little afterward. Next time I will sprinkle each chop with a touch of salt.  It was a great and easy meal.

This was easy and delicious; my husband raved and my young son ate it happily. I didn't have beef bouillon cubes but used vegetable flakes instead. Also omitted the salt completely. Will definitely use this recipe again.

Very moist! I had to adjust the recipe to do only 2 chops (without the help of the nifty calculate button). It stilled turned out fantastic! I've never had such moist pork chops without oil!

OOOOOOOO so yummy! It can be so hard to prepare pork chops that are not dry and this is one of the best recipes to avoid that! This recipe is going to be added to our favorites!

I thought this recipe looked great from the beginning but I always have to  my own special touch to anything I try. So I added a tablespoon of minced garlic to the butter when I sauteed the pork chops. I used soup base instead of bouillon. And I used stock to make some rice. After the pork chops were done I topped them with the rice and added a little flour to the remaining juices to make a sauce. I poured it over the rice and pork chops. It was delicious! The rice and sauce really added something and made it a little extra special!

Thank you for sharing this recipe.  I had to exchange the salt with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, used fat free low sodium chicken broth and 1 tablespoon of smart balance but followed the recipe steps and they came out perfect.  This is going to stay in my menu rotation.

I have never been a fan of pork, but my husband wanted to try this to break out of our same ol same ol routine. It was fantastic. The only thing he did differently was oregano and cilantro to substitute the sage since we didn't have any on hand, and we used thin boneless pork chops (we didn't have to cook it as long either because of that).

One of the tastiest pork chops I've eaten.  I omited the 2 tsp salt (hubby has high blood pressure) and added garlic powder.  I sauteed in 1 Tbsp butter and 1 Tbsp olive oil.   I use the Better than Bouillon base instead of bouillon squares in all my recipes for the same reason I omitted the salt.  I agree with another reviewer that suggested using this with chicken.

I thought the pork chops turned out wonderfully, very tender. I had 10 chops so I doubled the recipe except the salt. I used only 1 tsp of salt and 1 tsp of garlic salt.  This was perfect for out tastes. I also took the suggestions of other reviewers and used cornstarch and water to make a gravy, served over buttered noodles. Not so good. Perhaps using one less bouillon cube would lessen the salt taste in the gravy, or maybe mashed potatos would have been a better choice to off set the salt.

Excellent flavor. I omitted the salt and pepper (personal preference) and used Beef "Better than Boullion" Base in place of those little cubes. I wanted to thicken the broth up during the last few minutes of cooking time. I was out of cornstarch, so I made a slurry of milk and flour (1/2 cup milk and 2 Tbsp. flour placed in a cup with a lid and shook the dickens out of it!) Just prior to serving I added in 2 Tbsp. sour cream for added flavor. Thanks for this recipe. I'm always looking for new ways to prepare pork chops. This is a keeper.

I have to rate this 5 stars because my husband said they were the best pork chops I have ever made!  I probably would have given it a 4 stars, but when the man starts asking where the chops have come from, well, you know your on to something.  I thickened the sauce with some corn starch and it made a lovely gravy.  Thanks for sharing Tiffany.

Terrific flavor! My only suggestion is to take the juice and add a bit of cornstarch to thicken it so it can be used over the chops withopur running all over the plate. We may also add some caramelized onions next time but it certainaly isnt required.

This was a pretty good recipe, I used herbs de' provance instead of the sage as I didn't have any.  I also used a beef broth instead of the bullion as I find it too salty.  I made a reux first with some flour and butter before adding the beef broth to thicken the sauce.  The pork chops were very flavorfull and juicy.

I made these and they ended up turning out spectacular.  They were a little salty as is, in the recipe, however I had ommitted salt, but I think it's because I used the really large bullion cubes.  I ended up just adding more water and dilluted the mixture.  The pork chops were a bit hit, and I made some gravy out of the left over sauce.  I will make again and again!

These were amazing! I was never big on pork chops when I was younger, but my boyfriend really likes them, so I thought I'd give them a shot. I'm glad I did! I love love love the sage! I didn't have beef bouillon, so I used chicken bouillon instead. I don't know if it made a huge difference or not, but these turned out absolutely fantastic. I will definitely be making them again.

This was AMAZING! I followed other's advice and did this: Used boneless pork chops and omitted salt (used garlic and b pepper instead. After cooking I removed the chops from the pan and thickened the juice with 3 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 3 Tbsp cold water making a thick, brown gravy that had a great flavor. I varied using rosemary and thyme instead of sage. Used "Better Than Bouillon" over dry cubes - it is more a beef stock reduction than cubes. Used 1.5 inch thick chops and simmered for 30 minutes.

loved it! such a nice sage flavour. I used only 1/4 teaspoon of salt alongside 1 teaspoon of sage and 1 teaspoon of pepper on 2 large bone-in chops. 2 cups of beef stock and cooked covered for 45 minutes after adding the stock. Just under 2 tablespoons of butter.  What really made me happy was the gravy! I took the advice of other cooks and added 2 tablespoons of cornstarch mized with 2 tablespoons of cold water and it worked out so well! It didn't separate and it had so much flavour. This is amazing for gluten-free gravy... a miracle!  Thank you for this recipe. Will make again many times.

I deep fried and simmered these chops last night, and I must say this is a good recipe.  They were more tender than my usual way of cooking pork chops and they had a pretty nice flavor.  I marinated them for an hour using 1 tsp. ea:  kosher salt, ground black pepper, and ground sage.  When I took the chops out of the fridge, they had a very nice aroma.  I seasoned my flour w/ black pepper and saizon b/c I thought the sage may be overpowering.  I always have to deep fry chops b/c I can't fry/saute them without the breading breaking up and falling apart.  I also sprinkled on some saizon when I marinated them.  Will keep this recipe in my rotation.  Thanx.

I never liked pork chops because they always were too dry but this recipe makes them tender and flavorful.  The key is using the bone-in center cut chops and the slow cooking time.  I just used beef stock since I didn't have the cubes and didn't find it too salty at all.

I omitted the salt, and added garlic powder.  I didn't measure the spices, just put enough to lightly coat the pork chops.  I used vegetable oil instead of butter or margarine. I browned both sides, then set them aside on a plate. I used chicken soup base instead of beef bouillon in the water. I also added brown flour, which can be used to make gravy. Mixed it all together and added it to some sautéed, diced onions. It tasted a little floury so I added more water, Worcestershire sauce, grainy Dijon mustard and onion powder to boost the taste. I cooked this until thickened, then added it to the pork chops and let cook about five minutes longer until done. I like my pork with a tinge of pink in the middle. Served with homemade seasoned potato chips and a green salad. I used  the excess gravy to dress it. I don't think I'll make it again.

We always have these basic ingredients on hand.  So simple, so tasty.  Easy to substitute any pork cut or even veal.

I tried this recipe last night. It was great with the other suggested changes. I substituted 2tsp. of garlic instead of salt. I did not have beef bouillon cubes so I used low sodium chicken broth instead. I also rubbed kosher salt on my chops before rubbing on the sage mixture.I also had to add some flour to thicken up the gravy. My husband loved it. Thanks for all the helpful suggestions. This is a keeper. M. Baker

I'm surprised by all the rave reviews for this recipe because my chops turned out surprisingly dry and tough. We drowned them in the au jus from the pan, which helped. Excellent flavor, though. I doubt that I'll make this again.

Original Review: Good recipe that I want to try again. I used 3/4" boneless chops, and the original cooking time was too long: even though they tasted fine (I cut the salt by half), they were way too dry. Maybe the longer cooking time might be required of bone-in chops?  So, next time I try this recipe (and I plan to), I'll do as some have suggested: 3 minutes browning per side and 25 minute cooking time. I might also add some fresh garlic to the rub since it goes so well with pork.

Second review: Shorter cooking time for boneless chops is KEY. I had chops of varied thickness (1/2"-1"); the thickest I cooked for 4 minutes per side; the thinnest 2.5-3 minutes.  Simmered for only 25 minutes, and it came out perfectly this time. Nice and juicy. I added a little more beef broth because the prescribed amount didn't cover the meat well enough, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. I'm glad I did this one a second time.

i used boneless pork chops and 5 minutes was too long to brown on each side. it probably would have been better off at 1-2 minutes. after the 10 minutes, it was already too tough. with the leftovers the next day, i diced the chops and simmered again in the broth with veggies. it was much softer. overall three stars because there wasn't much flavor to it either.

these were AMAZING!!!!! i tweeked the recipe a little of course and made it my own. i added an extra 1/2 tea. sage and i added 1 1/2 tea. lemon thyme (its this herb that my landlady grows, it has a very subtle taste of thyme, and a sweet taste of lemon, almost like the lemon heads candy) i also added on clove of finely chopped galric to the dry rub mixture, i recommend using fresh garlic, not the powdered stuff, and i also added the same amount of garlic to the butter when you saute the chops, it helps to sear in the flavor! the only problem i had was that the beef bulion mix evaporated to fast in the pan, so there wasnt any left for gravy, but it didnt really matter, cuz the chops were very juicy, next time however, im jsut going to double the beef bulion mix so that i have more juice. i also used boneless chops, cuz it was all i had, but all you have to do is reduce the sauteing time to 3 minutes per side, and after you put in the beef broth, cook them for 15 to 20 minutes, so they dont dry out. all in all, this recipe was fantastic! its deffinatly one im going to do again and again, my family loved it!

Delicious. In addition to the sage, pepper, and salt, I added a bit of onion powder, a bit of paprika, and a bit of garlic powder. It was so tender and delicious.

Very good method of cooking chops. I have used butterfly chops instead, only 1 tsp of salt [1/2 would have done it] and 2 cups of broth instead of one. I also added some sliced mushrooms and cooked for the entire time. I removed the chops after the 45 mins and mixed in 1 tsp of flour at the end. The broth with the flavors from the chops, butter and mushrooms made for an awesome gravy for the mashed potatoes I served the chops with. Yum!

This was VERY good. I did make a few changes: I actually marinaded boneless pork chops the day before preparing. I mashed 2 garlic cloves, 2 sour oranges, a pinch of salt, and pepper and placed everything in a large zip-lock bag overnight. Then I followed this recipe.... WOW....Delicious.

I love this recipe! I'm a huge sage fan.  It's great as is, but I always use boneless chops.  I also have made variations including simmering the chops in boullion with sliced onions and  sauerkraut.  Sometimes start out the butter with sauteed chopped onions and/or or garlic.  Always yummy and so simple!

This was great.  Next time I will use low sodium beef broth, as it was a little bit salty.  The gravy was fantastic. Made this with yellow rice and broccoli.  Kids loved the gravy on the rice.  Will definetely make again!!

I give this recipe 5 stars because it's very very easy to make (only need a few ingredients) and the gravy is so delicious.. I used pork steaks, rubbed them with Italian seasoning, paprika, garlic powder and black pepper. I sauted them 3 minutes on each side and simmered them for 30 mins. I am glad I omitted the salt. Like the others, I thickened the sauce with cornflour and poured it all over my steaks and mashed potatoes. My hubby, who is not a gravy fan, gave a compliment to this gravy !!! Try and you will not regret :)

Followed the recipe exactly and it came out GREAT! But, for a little change to an already delicious flavor, sprinkle in some orange zest.  I love the flavor of sage and ornage together!

I use this recipe regularly.  The only difference I do is to use a can of stock rather than water and bullion.  The nicest thing about it is that I can cook pork chops and chicken breasts at the same time, as my hubby doesn't like pork chops.

This is the best thing I've made in years. Amazing. We even served these to a crowd for Father's Day and everyone, ages 2 - 84, devoured them. These find their way onto our menu at least every other week.

This was just okay to us.  It tasted exactly like its name.  The only change I made to the recipe was to add garlic while sauteing and I also cut the time since I used boneless chops. 

Recipe is fine, but to us it was just a basic chop recipe.  We have had much better.  Thank you for posting it though. It was worth a try.

This recipe was so simple and it turned out amazing. As the other members suggested, I used beef broth and thickened it with 1 1/2 tbs of cornstarch mixed with equal amount of water and chopped onion, the result was a delicious gravy to go with the pork chops.

Yum!  I didn't follow the recipe exact (missing stuff) but for the technique alone I rate this a 5*!  I rubbed the chops with what I had on hand (eyeballing everything): poultry seasoning, black pepper, garlic powder, and seasoned salt.  Since there were only two chops I used an inky-dinky frying pan but still used a full cup of water (but one boullion cube).  I simmered them while I worried about the rest of dinner and setting the table so I'm not quite sure how long they cooked.  With the leftover liquid I made gravy by adding cornstarch (an excellent tip from others) and it was perfect for the taters and the chops.  If you are making more than 2 chops I suggest using more water or you won't have enough gravy.  It was such an easy and tasty recipe, I will definitely be making chops this way again!

I LOVE sage, so I love this recipe! I skipped the salt, doubled the sage and pepper, and added one minced clove of garlic to the broth. The chops turned out so tender and flavorful--making this one again soon!

I cut the total cook time to 40 min. for bone in chops and they were still dry.  The flavor however was excellent. Will try again with less cooking time. If using Knorr cubes only use one for a cup of water.

I was surprised how well these came out and my husband really liked them. It couldn't be easier to make, but I did make changes as others had suggested before. I used a poultry seasoning that had sage in it plus several other seasonings, and also added garlic powder. Once I cooked them in the butter I added about 1/2 cup of sliced onions and cooked them about 40 mins. I think the added seasonings and onion can really make a difference.

This was ok.  I made it as it's written.  The gravy was good but the sage/pepper flavor was a little stronger than I like.  I might make this again and put the pepper, salt and sage into the bouillon and see how it turns out like that.

These turned out good, but a little too salty.  I'll make them again since they are very easy and cut back on the salt.

I thought this was a really great recipe for pork chops.  My only changes were not using any salt for the rub (and it was still salty from the bouillon), and adding a little flour to the rubbing process.  I don't like the taste of cornstarch and I figured this would thicken the sauce just enough, which it did.  (I boiled down the sauce for a few minutes after removing the chops.)

I used some really nice thick chops and they turned out very moist and juicy. Normally my chops are dry and tough so I don't cook them too often. Glad I found this recipe! The saltiness was fine for my tastes but I could see how others would need it decreased- the bouillion is salty enough on it's own.

I used almost an entire package of fresh sage and about half the amount of salt.  The porkchops were still a bit salty for me but they were outstanding.  They almost melted in your mouth and were so tender.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

I don't really care for pork chops--they are usually dry and chewy.  These turned out perfect.  I did increase the amount of seasoning on each chop.  They were fork tender and delicious.

Very easy! I used a little olive oil to coat the pan. Added garlic salt and lemon pepper to the sage. This came out great! Next time I won't add the salt b/c the boullion cubes added enough salt for my taste. Chops were tender. My fiance' said they are a keeper to the recipe box!

Great flavor!  I was running out of time, so I was only able to simmer the chops for 20 minutes instead of 45 so they weren't as tender as they could have beeen, but were still juicy and delicious. I also thickened the boullion with cornstarch to make a gravy to top the chops and mashed red potatoes.

I didn't expect great things from this recipe because it's so simple, but was very pleasantly surprised by how the pork chops came out. I didn't measure the seasonings, just sprinkled them on the chops and rubbed them in. I used garlic powder instead of the salt and threw 4 or 5 fresh sage leaves in with the liquid while it simmered. I also just boiled the water in a measuring cup in the microwave to dissolve the bouillon cubes. The meat wasn't dry at all and the taste was excellent.

Very good flavor!  Will be in regular dinner rotations.  I suggest using thin pork chops.  I used real thick ones and I think the flavors would have been much better with thinner meat.

This is a delicious recipe. I love sage! I added 1 more cup of water and 1 more tsp of sage. Toward the end I made a sauce with the liquid by using Wondra. I drizzled it over brown rice and mixed veggies also. Very tasty!

I used low sodium beef broth(the kind in the box)and used about a pinch of coarse salt; I find the coarse salt (sea salt, kosher, etc.) has a much better flavor than the regular iodized salt.  Very good.

Pretty good pork chop recipe overall.  I gave it a 4 because I think making the gravy would really set it off and give it 5 stars.  I didn't have any cornstarch on hand though.  I doubled the sage and pepper (skipped salt as suggested by others) because I thought they needed to be coated in it.  Mistake!!  They were way to "sagey", but that was my fault.  I guess you just need to rub a little on each side of the chops!  They did turn out very tender and moist and will be better next time I make them.  The "Baked Pork Chops I" recipe on this site is still my fave.

Very good, very easy.   I too have scaled back the salt, I only use a pinch or so because the bullion is so salty.  My whole family loves their chops this way.

This was a very tasty recipe and I will definitely make these again, but my chops came out tough and chewy so next time I'll put them in the pressure cooker.  I added flour to the leftover sauce and made gravy - served the chops with steamed broccoli and mashed potatoes - the gravy was wonderful!  I used no-salt bouillon so I salted the chops before browning and the flavors came out just right.

Very nice, A bit too Salty and I had to make more of the mix (There was only enough to do 2 1/2 Chops).

But I've done it twice and enjoy it very much.

this is a five star recipe with out the salt. i used only half the salt the recipe called for, and it still was way to salty. i will make it again but completey omit the salt all together. it was very juicy, and other than the salt had a really good flavor.

Served this to my family lastnight.  Went over very well with my 3 and 4 year old.  I added mushrooms as well and made the sauce into a gravy.  That was, absolutley, the best part. Served with garlic mashed potatoes. YUM

My family & I loved the flavor of these pork chops & the gravy made from the bouillon. However, as others have noted, they were way too salty, & I used a little less salt than called for. I would definitely recommend one teaspoon or less to make this a five star recipe.

Nice easy basic recipe, but I thought it was too salty.  I cut the salt in half and added a 1 t tarragon to the rub which gave the dish a little depth. My husband loved this dish

Lots of potential.  It was definitely too salty.  I suggest using sodium free/low sod.  beef broth in place of water & bouillon, and cutting the salt in rub in half.  Chops were very tender and tasted wonderful.  Used stock to make gravy.  Will definitely make again with above mentioned modifications.

These chops are absoloutly wonderful. My Husband came home from work and had 3 servings! I did make them a lil' different.I marinated my meat in the fridge for 6 hrs I added onion and garlic, and instead of beef cubes i used chicken cubes. And when the pork chops were done cooking in the chicken broth I removed the pork chops and added wondra flour with 1/2 Cup of water. I will definetly cook this meal alot! Thank You !

Yummy!  We loved these.  I've made them several times, sometimes with chicken instead of pork since my husband isn't a pork chop fan.  The chicken is still good, but the pork is definitely better to me.  They are tasty and easy to make!

This is a terrific pork chop recipe - no more dry chops!  I marinated them overnight in the rub and used Smart Balance Light and olive oil to cook them.  Added a little cornstarch slurry to the beef broth and WOW, what a great meal.  Thanks!

These were great!  I brined the chops first in a sugar/salt/water solution for 1/2 an hour, and didn't add any salt to the rub.  I used low-sodium canned chicken broth instead of beef anything (I think beef bouillon or broth tastes tinny), and added a flour/water slurry when the chops were done cooking to make a first-rate gravy for mashed spuds.  Will make this over & over!  Thanks!

This recipe is so good. My family loves it. I add some onion to the butter until its soft then add the chops. I use 1 can of beef broth instead of the water & boullion and at the end I mix 2 TBP. of flour to 1/2c. cold water and add it to the remaining liquid. This recipe is A+.

I made some of the recommended changes from other reviews (only 1 boullion cube and 1/2 the salt - I used garlic salt) and the result was very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

Excellent recipe!! I always have a hard time with keeping pork chops from getting dried out but this one never did; very moist and tasty. I'll definitely make again. I did not add any of the salt and used only 1 boullion cube, per the other reviews and I'm glad I did b/c it would've been too salty.
Loved this one!

These were good...four star worthy. The cooking method is great, very easy to throw together at the last minute and the chops turn out very tender and are appetizing. I think they could be improved on with a few other seasonings. I think I'll try a generic Italian seasoning blend the next time we have these. There was nothing wrong with just the sage...we prefer a bit more flavor. Definitly worth making again, though!

We really enjoyed this recipe, I just wish I could have given it some time to marinade because the flavor was a bit lacking.  Definitely worth making again, though!  Only next time, I may add some seasoning salt and let it marinate for a bit longer!

Great recipie - but definately forget about adding salt and I'm a saltaholic (at least give a taste to the rub before you add it and remember the bullion is almost all salt)!  I added garlic powder to replace salt.  Don't think onions did much.  Simple - robust taste - not big on pepper so I may cut back on that too next time.

Excellent recipe. My modifications - added crushed red pepper for a little zing and omitted the salt - the bulion was plenty salty for us.  I usually cook for 2 so reduced the ingredients to two chops but left most other stuff the same.  The rub is delicious and I would expect you might need more if you are making it for 6.  But the pan drippings/sauce made a great gravy when cooked down a bit.

REALLY good for being so easy! Anyone can make these. I only cooked two chops, so I halved the ingredients and reduced cooking time to 30 minutes. I also sauteed onions and mushrooms, and simmered them with the chops, which I highly recommend.

The first time I made these, I made the mistake of not reading the comments and following the recipe exactly  -- despite being concerned that it "seemed like it might be salty." Sure enough, while they were incredibly tender and smelled wonderful, they tasted like we were licking salt blocks. 

Next time I made this I replaced the buillion with broth and omitted most of the salt and for some reason they lacked the same tenderness and still felt too salty.

This recipe is great, the pork chops were so tender they just fell off the bone. And the smell when they're simmering made my mouth water. My husband also loved themhe wanted them again the next night! Great recipe! And easy!

I found this recipe to be bland and very uneventful.  I used fresh sage leaves and otherwise followed the recipe to a tee.  I would recommend sauteeing the pork with butter, salt and pepper to taste, and one large fresh sage leaf per chop. Cover until the chops are cooked through and serve.  This is also delicious for chicken breasts.  The chops will have a wonderful sage and butter flavor.

This was fantastic !!!  My husband and daughter and I LOVED it.  After reviewing other comments, I decreased salt to 1 tsp and used 1 1/2 cups water with the bouillon and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce.  Went well with brocolli and mashed potatoes.  Thanks for the recipe.  This is certainly a keeper.

These were delicious and easy to make.  I read other reviews and adjusted the salt to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp of garlic powder.  I also used a can of french onion beef broth and a small can of mushrooms and thickened the broth with cornstarch at the end of cooking.

YUMMY! I used only 1 1/2 tsp. salt, vegetable bouillion instead of beef, and added about a 1/4 tsp. of marjoram to the recipe. PERFECT!  Also, the butter worked perfectly and I added sliced onion and mushrooms in the browning process. Made gravy after done cooking with cornstarch and served over mashed potatoes with steamed veggies. Perfect!

This is absolutely a keeper!  I used about 3/4" boneless pork chops, because they were on sale.  Didnt brown the whole five minutes per side because i was afraid of overcooking them.  After they were browned, simmered for about 35 minutes, then took out the chops and added 3 TBSP cornstarch mixed with 3 TBSP cold water and it made a great gravy.  Served with mashed potatoes and buttered brocolli.  YUMMY!!

This recipe was ok but not outstanding. I'd describe it as an every-day meal. I used a lot of the suggestions of other reviewers and cut back on the salt, added sauteed onions and mushrooms, and thickened the sauce. But I felt that it was still missing some interest. I'm not sure if I'd make this again, but if I did, I'd probably experiment with adding wine or sour cream to give it more of a twist.

This was excellent! I added about a tsp of corn starch to thicken the gravy, which helped the gravy stick to the pork chops. I only used 1 tsp of salt and had to keep adding more sage to the salt/pepper mix. This is definately a keeper!!

There is some definite tweaking to do with the cooking time as my chops, which were 3/4" thick, were almost done at 5 minutes per side so they only needed minimal time (10 - 15min)in the sauce. I followed others and did the cornstarch bit to thicken the sauce. I also caramalized some onions before hand and mixed in crimini mushrooms. All in all a good base recipe, the taste was subtle but well mixed. Next time I will add a splash of red wine to the sauce before thickening.

This recipe was wonderful. I never put sage on pork chops, but the combination was very tasty. Skipped the salt & added lots of fresh ground pepper. As others, I made a gravy using cornstarch and sliced up some baby bella mushrooms. Will be making this one again. I will use a nice thick chop, so it doesn't dry out.

Wanted to try something different with chops, so I tried this one last night. It was terrific. In fact, my husband commented, "you can make this anytime". He said it was delicious, and asked me not to change the recipe when i made it again.  The only thing I did change with this recipe was, as other reviews had stated, I thickened the juice up after taking out the chops. I thickened it with milk and flour, as I had no corn starch. It was delicious. My son went back for more gravy to put over his rice and boiled potatoes, but there wasn't any left.

I thought this sounded so good but when I started it up I realized I had no sage so I used thyme and I had no beef bouillon so I used chicken broth.  Let me tell ya, it was still very good.  I can't wait to make it the way it was intended.   Thanks

I didn't have any sage, so I used thyme and it was very good. I also made the gravy like someone else recommended, with cornstarch and milk and it was wonderful. I had thin pork chops so they were a little overdone, but I will adjust the time when I do it again. Excellent flavor!

I used 3 tsp sage.  It was not too much. I'll use more next time as we like the sage flavor. Also, for the cooking liquid I used a combination of chicken and beef with 2 cups water.  Thickened the liquid after removing the chops with cornstarch and milk for gravy with mashed potatoes.  A real "hit" dinner

My husband and I LOVED this recipe!  We used boneless thin sliced chops and they were pretty moist.  I cut the salt by half and we both thought that the chops were very spicy, perfect for Texans.  Maybe they would not have been so spicy if they were a larger cut.  Would definitely make it again, most likely with a mashed potato to even out the flavor.  Thanks Tiffany!

This recipe has become 'THE' pork chop recipe for me. The pork chops are moist, flavorful, and delicious.  Sometimes I cook the chops in a can of beef broth instead of dissolving bouillon - that makes the recipe even faster and easier - and dirties one less pan.

I thought it was ok.  I was looking for something different to do with pork chops.  The kids didn't go for the sage and my husband thought it was too salty. Kind of tasted like stewed meat after sitting in the broth for 45 minutes.  While it wasn't a disaster, I won't make this again.

THIS IS SO GOOD.  The husband loved it, even my finicky 2 1/2 yr old  wanted more.  I don't usually take second serving, but if there was another chop I would of.  DEFINITELY A KEEPER.

I followed this recipe exactly and they turned out fabulous!  I guess the only thing I did differently was used three very large tenderloin bone-in chops instead of three regular-sized ones.  We really love recipes with a lot of sauces, but sometimes we like the freshness of no sauce -- if so, then this is the recipe for you.  A couple of people said theirs were dry, but ours weren't at all.  Maybe that's because I occasionally turned the chops as they were sauteeing.  My husband even liked them a lot and he normally gets quite when he knows we're having chops!

This was pretty tasty- I only used 1 teaspoon of salt and a can of beef broth instead of the cubes. I also sauteed some onions and garlic with it as well. Will make again.

This was so good.  I scaled it down to 2 servings, and used chicken bouillon instead of beef cause that's what I had on hand.  I added a ton of onions, and simmered it all for 30 minutes....perfect.  Will definitely be making again.

Easy to make, great flavor
I cut down the salt but other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.
Thanks

This was so simple and so tasty!  They got a little dry going the full amount of time.  I have new pans that I am not used to, so it's probably user error, but I can't wait to make them again.

This recipe suprised me I was concerned that I would have really dry pork chops however I was glad to say I didn't.  The only change I made was I did not have any beef bouillon so I used a can of beef broth I had in the cabinet.  I think this really helped to cut back on the saltiness.  Will definitely be keeping this one

Simple and delicious! I even liked them and I HATE porkchops! My husband who usually doesn't care for most pork chop recipes other than fried (lol) loved them too! Reminiscent of fried, but with more flavor, and the boullion keeps them moist. (Oh btw I halved the recipe) As far as the salt content, I thought it was borderline too salty, but dh thought it was perfect. For those that enjoy salt, you will like it as is; for those that like a lighter salting, opt to half the salt and add more after cooking to taste.

My 12 year old daughter made these chops for dinner.  Using tips from other users, she reduced the salt to 1/4 tsp, used 1/4 tsp paprika, and used canned beef broth instead of beef boullion.  Everyone loved it, and she was thrilled to be the star chef. =)

I wasn't impressed with this recipe.  It wasn't hard to do but I didn't feel like there really was that much taste with them.  I love sage but I would not make this recipe again.  It wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't worth remembering.

Very different, but extremly tasty. I would suggest cutting the pepper down to 1/2 or so as it is quite overpowering. I will be making this again!

I don't give out 5 stars easily, hardly ever, but I'd give this recipe 10 if I could! I didn't think I'd care for the sage, but all the herbs blend so well, and finishing the cooking in the beef broth really keeps these chops juicy. Everyone loved these and wanted more. Double the recipe so you can all have seconds...you won't regret it!

Such a good dinner! I've made this a few times now and the only thing I do different is use more seasoning because my family loves a lot of flavor. This recipe makes the pork chop so tender that you don't even need a knife.

I add a healthy dose of garlic powder to the salt, pepper, and sage rub, increase the amount of sage considerably, and reduce the cooking time. Other than those changes, this is my family's favorite pork chop recipe by far. I usually serve them with garlic mashed red potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts and kale.

I LOVED this recipe. I didn't realize it called for bone-in chops, and I only had boneless ones, but I just reduced the cooking time to about 30 minutes and they were succulent and delicious. I do agree with the comments about not adding any salt  - the bouillon is salty enough on its own. I think I'm going to try this with chicken breasts too.

Good meal! I changed a few things. I omitted the salt  after reading reviews (didn't miss it). I browned the pork chops for 1 minute each side. Used 2 teaspoons of bouillon granules in 1 cup of warm water  and then I only cooked covered on low heat for about 25 minutes. Was very good with a surprisingly good flavor and stayed tender! I will make this one again.

Very easy and very tasty!  I reduced the salt to less than half  the second time I made it, and will halve it again next time I make it.  I used bone-in chops at little more than a half inch thick.  By the time the chops were browned, they were almost fully cooked, leaving very little time for cooking in bullion.   Stated cooking times are WAY out of whack.  I'm still trying to work on that because I like my pork chops to be very moist.  Other than the salt and time issues, it is a very flavourful recipe.

I didn't use the beef bouillon, instead I added a splash of water and a squeeze of fresh lemon after Browning both sides. I also added paprika to the seasoning. It tasted really flavorful, so I'm sure if I'd used the bouillon it would be really salty. But man this is a good combo - pork + sage + butter = mmm mmm

These were very good! The only thing I did was use less salt. I brine my pork before cooking because I feel it just makes the pork more tender. These were very tender and very moist. Thank you!

Very good. Glad I read the reviews and skipped the salt. It was perfect with the bouilion. I browned the chops the night before and put them in the frig. In the morning I put everything in the crockpot on low for 8 hrs, used the broth for gravy. Family loved it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.

Great recipe! I tweaked it a little bit by using Lipton Beefy Onion soup mix in lieu of beef bouillon and ground sage, and just added parsley for looks. My family loved it!

I have a love hate relationship with pork chops that I often mend up making into pork bricks. This recipe is flavorful and the chops came out the perfect consistency. Not mushy. Not dry. Just right. I will able adding this to the rotation of dinner recipes.

I was just tired of the same old recipe for pork chops, so I thought why not try this.  The were very good and very tender. I served them with dressing and green beans....kind of a traditional meal. I will make them again, only I might use a little less salt.

I used boneless pork chops and substituted Oregano for Sage since I didn't have any on hand, no other changes. Turned out great! Very juicy and full of flavor. Husband and teen boys loved them!! Will definitely make these again.

Awesome! I took everyone's advice & didn't add any extra salt. After I sautéed the pork chops, I took them out & sautéed some minced garlic & thinly sliced shallot, then replaced the chops & added the beef broth. When it was done, I removed the chops & used cornstarch to make a gravy. Served with mashed potatoes. SO good!! Thanks for sharing!

This is a staple in our house.  I gave it 4 stars because it's just too salty as written.  I reduced the salt to 1 tsp and it's much better.  The only other thing I do differently is to double the sauce for extra gravy over the mashed potatoes.

This was amazing! I used boneless chops and I did make a change because I had no beef stock or beef bouillon. Instead I found a packet of herb gravy mix in my cupboard  so I made the mix as directed on the packet then I added it to the chops after browning them. I added a tiny bit more water just to make it not as thick as gravy. With the size of my chops I let them simmer about 25 mins and omg...so delicious. I did everything else the same!

I substituted boneless pork chops for the bone in pork chops and made the recipe as written. Super easy to make!   I didn't cook the chops as long as the recipe suggested.  We thought they were just okay.  We weren't wowed by them.  They were a little dry.  I should have cooked them a little less time.

Salt overload!  I will probably try this recipe again but will omit the salt altogether.  As another reviewer mentioned, the bouillon cubes contribute enough salt already.

I cooked the 3/4 thick boneless chops for 3 minutes on each side and then simmered for 30 minutes instead of 45 and it was getting close to over cooked. They were not dry, but they weren't juicy either. Next time, I would do 2 minutes each side and then 30 minutes simmering as low as I could and I think they will be perfect. The flavor was very good. I'll make it again.

GREAT flavor, simple, satisfying. Great recipe. Use broth instead of water + bouillon and then make a brown gravy out of the drippings. Will be making this many times to come.

This was a good basic recipe!  I browned  my bone in chops, then added butter and beef bouillon broth (no salt I added after cooking). I only cooked the chops for maybe 30 mins the most. They were good, not falling apart, but tender.

I  added 1/4 tsp. of  salt  to this--I only made two chops--mainly because beef bouillion, in my opinion, has more than enough salt in it (my hubby said he thought his initial taste detected a tad too much salt, so I'll know to leave the salt out of it completely next time).  I also only used a teaspoon of bouillion powder for my two chops.   I read a few other reviews that wanted a thicker gravy, which I can always do next time around.  I would also not cook it as long--my chops almost got a little dry--doesn't need to cook 45 minutes (I'll experiment with 30 minutes, no longer).  The chops did have a good flavor and I would make this again.

Used 6 thick chops, 1T sage, no salt, 4 bouillon, 3 c. water, added 3 cloves of garlic and a chopped yellow onion. Used pam and sprinkled buttered flavoring over chops too. Simmered for 45min covered. Made gravy with 2T cornstarch. Served the chops with the gravy poured all over baked potatoes and broccoli too. OMG this was delish.

My husband and I made this last night and we enjoyed it. We did take other reviewers' advice and thickened the beef gravy after pork was done cooking. We used 3 tablespoons corn starch to 3 tablespoons cold water. It thickened up after no time and was much needed. NOTE: The gravy is VERY salty since recipe calls for using 2 cubes to one cup water--double what you normally would--but it works well when you mix it with chops, mashed potatoes, etc. So, no worries there!

We also halved the salt content in rub, though could actually use more to help out the chop's flavor.

What we will try next time: Adding more sage per chop (I know one reviewer recommended 1 tsp PER chop), cooking for less time, and perhaps adding some garlic. Overall, it was a great, easy recipe that we will definitely make again.

This is a really great pork chop recipe. I have always loved the flavor a of sage and butter together. I usually serve with roasted red potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. I also mix a little bit of flour and water together and add it to the pan sauce to make a gravy. Gravy goes great with all three items!

These were a big hit! I didn't have bouillon cubes, so I just added water when it was time for the chops to simmer, and they still turned out great! My chops were thick, so the cooking time was perfect. And they weren't too salty, since there was no broth added.

I like these pork chops. My boyfriend LOVES them. He says they taste like bacon chops (and anything with bacon=better) SO it's a hit in my house! They're also almost painfully easy to make and near impossible to screw up.

These were probably the best pork chops that I've ever made.  I used the seasoning mix recommended for salt, pepper, and sage, and only made it through 4/6 chops.  The last two I just eyeballed it on each one and rubbed the spices in before adding them to the skillet.  They just fell apart, they were so tender.  Followed the rest of the recipe exactly, 5 min per side to brown, added the broth and let simmer away!  I will say that my chops were a little big for my 12" skillet, they were climbing the walls, but they all turned out wonderfully!

Pork chops were plenty tender, but I was a little disappointed that there wasn't more sage flavor.  Biggest complaint was that it was just too salty with the salt in the rub plus the bouillon cubes.  If I were to make again, I'd definitely cut back on the salt in the pork chop rub.  I did a little corn starch slurry for a nice pan sauce for the chops and the mashed potatoes.

Easy recipe and very good; the chops were very tender. I omitted the salt; also removed chops from pan and made gravy. Will make again!

This recipe was a real hit with the family.  Browned the pork chops for three minutes per side and cooked for 20 minutes.  I added a dash of salt to the rub along with the sage and pepper.  I also added a couple of pinches of garlic and onion powder.  I used two cups of chicken broth as I wanted more gravy.  I used 3 tbsp of corn starch mixed with the broth from the pan. I served it with garlic mashed potatoes also from this website.  Next time I will leave the dash of salt out as it was just a tad too salty.

I didn't have beef bouillon so I substituted chicken, but it still came out very tasty. It's a keeper for our house.

Delicious!  So I was a bit lazy.  I melted about a TBSP of butter and added a bit of olive oil.  I didn't feel like measuring so sprinkled the salt, pepper and sage on one side of the chops.  I also sprinkled a bit of rosemary, too.  I put the cops seasoned side down in the frying pan and sprinled the seasonings on the other side. I browned in the pan on both sides and took out the chops.  I then added bouillion concentrate, a few splashed of white wine and a little bit of water (didn't measure).  Stirred it up and returned the chops and simmered on low turning a few times.  It was really good and chops were very tender.  I covered when simmering.

I used 1/2 teaspoon thyme and 1/4 teaspoonful of salt to the sage and pepper. and-added 1clove of garlic and some mushrooms when sautéing the onion.  Thickened the juices to make a lovely gravy which I couldn't resist finishing off with a slice of crusty bread. Mmmmmmm

These came out very tender, but too salty for us. I just sprinkled the chops with some salt instead of using the recommended 2 tsp, and I used unsalted butter. I wouldn't use any salt next time as the bouillon has plenty. I added fresh garlic and some sliced onions when I was browning the meat. And you definitely need to add a cornstarch slurry and make gravy--that really makes the whole dish. You can tweak this recipe to 5 stars.

So easy and delicious!  I used a smidge less sage than called for.  Served with egg noodles and broccoli and I'll be making this again.  Oh, I followed someone else's review and added some chopped onion to the sauce

Very good, very easy.  I bet this would work nice with other herbs (rosemary sounds especially nice). Fixed this exactly as stated and it is a keeper!

This had the potential to be great but I decided to use the salt according to the recipe instead of omitting it like the other reviews mentioned. It was WAY too salty and we could barely eat it!! I am even wondering if there was a mistake in the recipe. I will try this again without the salt.

They are simmering as I write.  I have  made these four times and this is the only way I will make pork chops.  I don't add the salt to the rub, as the beef broth has enough for us.  I do add garlic powder to the rub.  The sage is a fantastic addition - the gravy is so good.  I love these and so does my 84 year old Mother.  I look forward to dinner in about 40 minutes.  Thank You - I was about to give up on pork chops....

Made this with boneless, thin cut pork chops and it was delicious.  I just should have reduced the pepper but still was very good.

Super tasty beefy sage style pork, Way way tender falling off the bone status. Did mashed potatoes and green beans that complimented them great! Next time I will try boneless chops to avoid the fat & wasted bone weight.. but chops are pretty cheap anyways!

My family thought this was delicious!  I thought it was just okay, but I think it was just too much pepper for my taste.  The only changes I made were reducing the salt, and using 8 oz of sodium free organic beef broth.  I also made the gravy like others suggested.  I served with cooked potatoes and green beans.  It was very easy and I will keep this one in my recipe box!

Loved it! Very easy and very tasty. I did not have sage on hand, so I subbed in Thyme, but I will definitely be making them again with sage in the future! I also used a can of low sodium beef broth instead of bothering with the bouillon cubes.

Followed some other suggestions & cut the salt in half and used 2 cans beef stock. Also added thyme & fresh rosemary. Cooking time was a bit much, thought they could have been more tender. Added flour and water to make gravy. Served with mashed potatoes & corn. Kids loved it. All 3 had 3 servings each. Next time I'll try it in the slow cooker.

I followed the recipe as given, and found that it was too salty. Overall a good recipe, just exclude the salt in the rub. Plus, I was only cooking for two people, so 45 minute simmer might be a bit too long.

Good flavor, a bit to salty... next time ill adjust that. Also need to adjust the time depending on the thickness of the chops.

Did not rub salt onto the chops - REASON: used 1 can of beef bouillon (already salty enough) instead of water and beef cubes. Added 3 teaspoon of starch to cold bouillon before adding to simmer - this created a lovely gravy.

Easy, tangy, my son's favorite meal. Cook in chicken broth and skip the bullion cube.

These are very tasty. I added a TINY bit if salt on each side of the pork chops and extra sage. I used only one cube of beef bouillon with the cup of water. They were so tender and juicy.

I don't think this would have been nearly as successful if I hadn't followed the advice of other reviewers; I omitted the salt and sprinkle about 1/2 tsp of thyme over them.  Sauteed in 1/2 smart balance, 1/2 olive oil.  Then I used beef broth instead of the water/boullion.  I also added a about 1/4 of sauteed onions, 1 small can of mushrooms and 2 cloves of garlic to the pan when I added the broth.  I simmered the chops for 25 minutes and then made a slurry to make the gravy.  The chops were a little dry, but the gravy was fantastic and certainly helped them seem more moist.  I need to figure out how to get this meat tender and then the recipe will be perfect!

The recipe definitely has potential to be delicious.. it was just way WAY too salty (wasn't edible, sadly), even though I only added 1 tsp salt. I definitely want to try this again, but next time, I will cut out the salt completely, as the bouillon cubes add more than enough.

A little too much pepper, but good and easy otherwise.  I'll probably make them again and add less pepper and more of the other 2 spices.

This was just ok. I was really hoping for something amazing since I love sage. Even cutting the salt down and only using 1 cube, it was pretty salty.

I cooked these in the oven at 350 because I had 8 chops. They turned out OK. I don't care for just sage and pepper for the main seasonings for flavor. I left out the salt b/c of the bullion. I did like the beef bullion idea and adding water for extra gravy, which turned out pretty good.

Three stars for being quick, easy and tasty.  It's not the healthiest dish, but next time I'll swap the butter for olive oil.  I loved this because I had everything in the cupboard, and literally I had dinner ready in 40min, with 30 of that being the simmer time that I could walk away and do other things.  I did alter the dry ingredients slightly - basically I halved the salt and the pepper and made up for it with the sage.  I also used boneless chops and simmered them for 30min, though next time I'll drop that to 20-25min.  I'll definitely add this to my staple pork chop recipes, and next time I'll try putting my own flair on it.

I'm surprised at how many people rated this recipe so highly.  I  give this recipe 0 stars because it's a travesty to put beef boulion or beef broth for that matter with pork.  Not thinking what it would do I tried the recipe with beef broth. You should just use water.  The pork chops make their own flavor when cooked until their brown.  I might try them by just salting and peppering them and coating them with flour,  the traditional way. That's good enough.  But you can try just frying them after rubbing them with sage.  You shouldn't want to compromise the true flavor of the pork that's so good by using a beef flavoring of any kind.  I cooked them again by first dipping them in flour with salt, pepper, and paprika mixed into it, then egg and milk, then in Panko Bread Crumbs.  You can use regular bread crumbs if you like.  This is how they do Schnitzel. I like Panko sometimes but  for this I would prefer regular bread crumbs  even though it was pretty good and much better than the Sage Pork Chop recipe.  A delicious sauce to go with it is dill mixed with chicken broth and a cup of sour cream just warmed in a pan.

These turned out flavourless and dry.  I even took the advice of other people and lowered the cooking and simmering time but it didn't help.  I also added some ground garlic and red onions for extra flavour and that didn't do any justice.  I won't be making these again.  I should of stuck with the mushroom soup port chops

I rubbed the seasoning on 4 boneless pork chops and let them sit in the fridge for a couple hours before cooking, using a can of low-sodium beef broth instead of the bouillon.  We loved this recipe, but found it a little salty - would definitely reduce the salt next time.  The gravy was really yummy on mashed potatoes!

This was a good recipe but I did alter it before cooking. I decreased the spices by half because my husband isn't a big fan of sage. Next time, I'll use 1/2 tsp for the salt, sage, and black pepper.

These were easy simple and delicious.  The entire family loved them.  They almost had a steak like taste to them.  We all love sage so I added some additional sage to the rub. The pork chops were tender and moist.

I used thin cut pork chops vs. the center cut bone in pork chops because that is what I had on hand.  These were very flavorful and I loved the sage flavor in these.  They almost tasted like a beef stew vs. a pork chop but still very good.

I am not the greatest cook, but I made this for my wife and myself, and it was delicious!  One tip in preparation, place the spices in a ziplock bag with the pork chops to help evenly coat them.  I used boneless chop, so I reduced the simmer time to 30 minutes, and also reduced the salt by half.  It tasted great.  Both my wife and I loved it!

I enjoyed this recipe. I used fresh sage (diced) and beef broth instead of bouillon. The leftovers I think were even better. However, I was a little confused about whether or not all the juice should be simmer down or not, since you are suppose to cover the pan, the one cup of broth stays. I suppose if you added cornstarch to it you'd have a nice gravy to add to some potatoes.

I am not typically a pork chop fan, but this was delicious.  I used low sodium chicken broth because that's all I had and it was still wonderful.  I only simmered it for 20 minutes and it was tender and juicy.  WONDERFUL! Will definitely make again!

BEST pork chop recipe I've ever tried!  Simple, few ingredients--has a very savory and homestyle taste.  Moist--not dried out like most pork chop recipes I've tried.  Can't wait to make again!  Husband loved the gravy (I added the cornstarch and water mixture to thicken).

Love this recipe. It's actually the first pork recipe I've ever used. Not my favorite pork recipe, but it's the best for a simple homestyle meal. It's really easy to over-salt this dish, so be super careful if you are adjusting the number of servings, especially if you are using a cooking wine that already has salt added. I've made this a few times and it's great as-is but also good if breaded lightly with flour. The gravy is fantastic too! Brown a few tablespoons of flour in a remainder of the grease (make sure it's brown with no white remaining, or the gravy will have a powdery texture) then add water and/or milk until you have the desired consistency. You may need to salt and pepper to taste!

Very good recipe. I used the exact rub for the chops, but they were only about 3/4 inch thick so I seared them on each side for 2 minutes, and then simmered them in broth (not bullion) for 15-20 minutes. Took them out and stuck them in the oven to stay warm while I reduced the broth a little bit and then added cornstarch/water. Made a lovely gravy for my mashed potatoes. I'll definitely be using this recipe again!

These pork chops were great! I used the recommended amount of sage and added miniscule amounts of ground oregano, Coriander seed, and Cumin, and it was a major hit with my family. The flavour was great and it wasn't to dry. A great recipe.

This is a great recipe for pork chops. I am somewhat picky about the way I like pork chops and before this, the recipes I would actually use for pork chops was around four - any other way and I didn't like them. My recipe number is now five. This is a deceptively simple recipe. It is simple and only has a few ingredients and a few directions, but the result is simple and delicious. This is a huge hit around my house and I get requests for the recipe often. This recipe is good for regular dinner rotation as well as a recipe for company. I highly recommend it.

This had good potential but it turned out really dry and salty for me. I plan to try it again but simmer the pork for a much shorter time and also not add the salt to the rub and just use one bouillon cube. You can always add more later.  Could also use more sage.

Cooked as recipe states except I think I messed up by using boneless pork chops.  They were not bad... my husband and kids used bbq sauce though to flavor them up - ugh!  Will try again with bone-in pork chops and am guessing this will make a pretty good difference.  Will re-rate after 2nd attempt.

Mmmmm! Excellent recipe, I did as others advised and omitted the salt when coating the chops, and found the seasonings were perfect with the salt thats in the beef bouillon. I would definitely make this again!

Added rosemary and paparika to the rub.  Also browned minced garlic in the butter.  Finally instead of water and broth/cubes I used white wine and 1 tblsp of balsamic.  I followed others suggestions and made a sauce by adding cornstarch/cold water.  WOW!

I used this recipe to make 2 lbs. pork loin roast.  I was kind of worried it would be too spicy for kids because the rub was such a dark color.  Didn't need to worry.  It was great.  I added 3 bouillon cubes and no salt because of the comment I read about it being salty.  I browned the roast on the stove. Then, cooked it in the crockpot.  It was great with baked potatoes and corn on the cob.

The flavor of this is divine.  What an incredible and unexpected combination!  But reduce the salt.  Either use less salt on the rub or use low sodium broth.  Way too salty.  Will make again and again.

These turned out nice and tender. Followed the recipe then was worried about them being to salty so when they were simmering I added more water and they turned out just fine. Also added some fresh mushrooms to the sauce. Will make these again!

Lots of flavor, easy to make, smells wonderful while cooking - reading other reviewers suggestions, I added in some garlic, halved the salt, used rosemary instead of sage and added the cornstarch to the beef broth.  I will definitely make this again but next time will not add any salt (the beef boullion more than makes up for it) and possibly add some onion and mushrooms, too!

WHOA SALTY!!! These are only get a '3' because they were WAY TOO SALTY! Even my husband, who loves his salt said they were. I followed the recipe exactly as written. With that said, I will probably make these again because underneath all that salt we could taste potential. Next time I will make with less salt & add some garlic.

Very good!  Everyone cleaned their plates!!  I did only put 1tsp of salt in, and cooked in olive oil instead of butter.

This recipe is so simple and turns out wonderful every time! My husband never leaves any left-over, and my one year old can chew it since it always is so tender.

Excellent pork chops, and so easy.  We don't usually buy bone in pork chops, but we were given some by bf's parents, so I thought I'd try this recipe.  I eliminated the salt but did use meat tenderizer in the rub mix.  I boiled the water in an electric kettle and mixed the bullion in; I didn't want to dirty another pot.  Worked perfectly.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty and tender. I did us a little less buillion and less salt than it asked for and it came out just right for us. I was always looking to use the sage I bought from the Amish farm nearby and now I have a wonderful recipe that I will make again and again.

Really delicious!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, except I reduced the salt to about 1 teaspoon and added some crushed rosemary to the sage mixture.  I also followed the advice of some viewers and cooked the chops for only 30 minutes.  Rather than make a gravy, I served some of the au jus on the side for dipping.  I served with a sweet potato mash and salad.  My husband loved it!  Thank you!

Even though I used half the amount of salt called for, these were still too salty.  However, they were nice and tender and I liked the sage flavor so I'll try again.

Wonderful!  I used olive oil in place of the butter due to my kids' allergies.  After the chops were done I strained the liquid and made a gravy using cornstarch. I also doubled the bouillon and water.

Very good!  I like my food salty, and it was just right for me, but others may want to cut the salt down a bit.  Probably one tsp would be sufficient.  Also, the cooking time is longer than what you need, and we used 1" thick pork chops!  We will certainly make again.  Yum!

Very good.  Used thick, center cut boneless chops.  Came out very tender and flavorful.  Much more roast like than chop like.

My boyfriend and I devoured these, they were delicious! I followed the advice and only sauteed them for about 20 minutes and then just checked to make sure they were cooked through. Delicious! They go really well with roasted potatoes.

I used thyme, rosemary & garlic instead of the sage.  I also used boneless 1/2 thick pork chops.  After browning the chops as directed, I added some mushrooms & onions.  Then I added the beef broth and simmered.  The pork was very tender. Served with garlic bread & brown rice.   Will have it again!

I made these because my husband likes pork chops but I have never found a way of preparing them that I personaly like.  These are hands down the best pork chops I have ever had.  They were extremely moist.  I used fresh sage rather than dried and did not use the bullion but rather served it with a light gravy.  Excellent.

I was surprised how wonderful these pork chops were. They are so tender and have a great mild taste not like sage but just seasoned mildly.I made homemade stuffing to go along with and my husband loved it. I added an extra half cup of water so I would have more gravy and it turned out just right.Used Knorrs grandules about 2 teaspoons and added a little more sage rub than called for since it wasn't enough to cover 6 boneless pork chops.

I used poultry seasoning instead of sage and beef broth instead of boullion.  I cooked them for about 15 min due to the thickness of the chops.  I also added diced onion and apples with the broth.  The taste was only so-so.  I wouldn't make again.

These were quite good, and the recipe didn't require much tweaking if I recall.  he three boys in my house gobbled 'em up! Served them with mashed potatoes, a gravy made from the pork drippings, and I believe corn on the cob.  Very nice!

Delicious! My whole family & bf loved it. My twist was to add 4 TBS of Fresh squeezed lemon juice in the bowl of sage, it made the meat more moist and flavorful, and helped the sage stick better. Didn't mix boullions with the sage. During last 10 minutes I poured boullion juice into the saucepan and let the pork chops soak in it and added the sage/lemon mix.

awesome! added thin slices of garlic on to the rub, used fresh sage (didn't have dried) and added about a fourth of a cup of chardonnay to the water while it simmered and threw some sliced mushrooms on top of it all. It was great! I'm sure it would be wonderful without the additions they just sounded good when I was cooking

We didn't have sage so we used rosemary instead. We used 3 tablespoons of rosemary and 3 beef boullion cubes. Not salty at all! Will make again.

Very very good, but I agree with others who have said that the cooking time is too long.  Perhaps if you had super thick chops, 45 minutes would make sense, but with regular thickness chops, 45 minutes was 25 minutes too long.

These came out very dry. I might try again but with lowering the simmering time. I only used 1/4 t salt since boullion is salty enough. All in all these weren't anything special

I've totally quit using bouillon, it's just way too salty for any recipe IMO. I now buy the various kinds of "stock in a box" which has much lower sodium. Used the beef stock for this recipe and it turned out very nicely. I followed the recipe other than that. Next time I'm going to buy fresh sage and add that during the simmering time... I think it would improve this recipe even more.

Fantastic flavor, but very salty!  I followed other reviewers advice and cut out about half of the salt but it was still too salty.  Next time I'm going to double the sage and omit the salt completely - with the beef bullion it's just too much.  Very tender and juicy though! Will definitely make again.

The recipe calls for too much salt. The boullion (sp?) has WAY more than enough salt. I would also add a little more sage. Other than that...the recipe was good.

These were excellent!  I have never made anything with sage before but am still very new at this cooking thing.  These were better than how my mother made pork chops.  Thank goodness for this website!

Very good, but very salty. I had to keep adding water after I poured in the beef boullion. I even added a little sugar to balance out the salt. After trying to cook out the liquid, the pork chop were really dry. Then I took another users advice and added some cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Overall it was good and the family loved it despite the salt. I think next time I won't salt the pork chops as much. Will definitely make it again! Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!!

Wonderful flavor and moist!  I used boneless thick cut chops and they turned out wonderfully.  I added cornstarch to the remaining liquids and it made the most devine gravy.  I made the "Perfect Baked Potato" from this site and poured the gravy on that.  Oh my, sooo good!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.  Definitely a keeper.

This is a great recipe.  Very easy!  To reduce the sodium, I always leave out the bullion and just allow it to simmer in water.

These were a hit with my family.  I've never cooked with sage before and the smell while it was cooking was divine.  I took another reviewers tip and used more sage than the recipe called for (about 1/2 tsp per chop).  But do be aware, even though you're cooking the chops in beef broth, they can dry out pretty quickly so just keep a close eye and take them off the burner as soon as they're cooked all the way through.

TOO MUCH SALT! And that was after I cut the salt amount in half too. Other than that, fine. I added chopped onion to the liquid and made it into gravy with cornstarch as well.

I use this recipe ALOT in the summer because it does not require the oven.  As quick, easy and delicious way to make pork chops.  My family LOVES them and asked for them regularly.  I gave this recipe to a friend of mine and it quickly became a "keeper" in her family too.

Awesome. This is loaded with flavor. Extremely moist. I made it a second time for my parents. I didn't have beef bouillon so I used chicken bouillon with about 2 tbsp of Worcestershire sauce to get a beef  flavor. It was better than the first time. My mom asked for the recipe.

This was my first ever attempt at pork chops and I was not disappointed. I had 3- 1 1/4 inch boneless chops, I only used 1 tsp salt but kept the sage and pepper the same as the original recipe. I browned them in butter 5 min per side, added one can campbells beef broth and a splash of water and 1-2 tsp minced garlic in the jar (my favorite invention ever!) and simmered 40 minutes on low. I checked the chops at that point and they were moist and juicy. However, since hubby wasnt home yet I covered a dish in foil and kept them in the oven (heated but turned off) for maybe 20 min while my brown rice finished boiling and I made the gravy w/ 3T each water and cornstarch. The chops did dry out slightly in the oven, but the gravy was fantastic (just a tad salty, but still great) so wasn't really an issue. The gravy was also good on the brown rice. Next time I think I will reduce the sage and pepper a tad in accordance w/number of chops, omit the salt altogether or perhaps use just a pinch, and opt for the reduced sodium beef broth and I think it'll be 5 stars! Really easy recipe, thanks for sharing!

Made as directed and they were amazing. I can see how some may think it was a little salty, so you may want to reduce the salt. But OMG, I even overcooked them a little (I used thinner chops then I should have) and still were amazing. I can't wait till next time!

Excellent recipe and very easy to follow.  The combination of the sage and black pepper is very good and tasty.  Instead of center cut bone-in pork chops, I used 1 inch thick pork tenderloin instead; I also used chicken bovril rather than beef bouillon.  It took me about 45 minutes at the very most - rather than 1 hour - to cook properly the pork tenderloin.  Safe to say, I will definitely make this pork dish again.

Hmmm, I've made this twice now & it was just okay.  I'm wondering if I'm doing something wrong, because of all the reviews I expected it to be much better. The taste is pretty good, but not super tender as many reviewers say.  I didn't cook it for quite as long as the recipe says, so maybe that's the problem.  It just seemed like way too long . . . I may have to try it one more time & cook for the whole time to see if its better.

GREAT!  I omitted the salt and added some parsley, I rubbed the pork and let it sit for an hour.  I added the broth to the pork and cooked (or poached)it for 20 minutes or so.  It was moist and had great flavor.

I followed advice and added 1/4 cup chopped onion and 1 tsp salt. I did thicken the sauce a bit at the end. I used beef broth (I would never use a cube). Not amazing but pretty good. I might make it again. Some red wine during the simmer might help it, some in the pan and some in a glass.

I loved this recipe.  A nice change.  I used sea salt, I may just reduce the salt a little.  I also used 1/2 inch chops and reduced the time of browning by half.  They were extremly tender and tasty.  Thanks.

My whole family likes these pork chops--even my picky 6 and 3-year-olds.  I used 1" thick pork chops and the spices were just right for them.  They were really moist and yummy!

This is the best recipe for pork chops I've had so far!!  I used a huge boneless chop and vegetable buillion instead (all I had on hand).  It was FABULOUS!!

I omitted half the salt.  The flavor was nothing extraordinary but the cooking method made these one of the best and tender pork chops I've ever had.  They seemed like crockpot cooked.  I'll play with the spices.  Thanks!  I cut about 10 minutes off the cook time on boneless chops.

I omitted the 2 tsp. of salt since previous reviewers said it came out a bit salty.  Chops came out very moist, and I didn't miss the added salt at all.

This was okay.  I added garlic powder and cut the salt and also cut the bouillon in half.  I added mushrooms at the end.  The sage flavor was a bit much.  The chops were very tender and moist, but still not sure if I'll make this again.

Very good.  Fiance and I aren't crazy in love with sage so I probably won't make this on a very regular basis.  However, we do like the sage flavor for an infrequent meal and I would certainly turn to this one again.  The pork chops were very tender and the house smelled incredible while they were being prepared.

Great flavor! I also lessened the salt and used season salt.  Also, my family said it was a bit much pepper, maybe use 1/2 teaspoon.  Real easy to prepare.

These were really flavorful.  I used Lawreys instead of plain salt, and a little extra sage.  I also thickened the sauce with corn starch at the end and added 1 sliced onion during the browning process.  Instead of a lot of oil in the bottom of the pan, I used cooking spray to cut back on fat.

These were the best pork chops I've had in a long time.  They are very easy to make, are very moist, and have great flavor.  I recommend using "real" butter for browning the chops as it adds to the flavor.  I didn't have beef boullion on hand, so I used chicken boullion and added beef seasoning to that.  I will definitely be making these again.

The kids saw me making these chops and wanted them to be lemony, so we added a splash of fresh lemon juice to the sauce and they were delicious.  It really brightened up the saltiness of the boullion.  Easy and flavorful recipe.  Thanks!

Something about this recipe did not rub me the right way.. maybe it was the sage?? Not really sure.. however the chops were very moist and tender.. My husband liked this recipe, he gave it 4 stars. I think I may try this method again but use other spices besides sage.

Very simple and very good.  I omitted the salt.  The mixture was enough for 4 chops.  I had to cook them longer and so ran out of liquid.  I added a can of beer I had on hand to finish the cooking and made a nice gravy out of it.  I guess that doesn't sound too good but you couldn't taste the beer at all and was wonderful over mashed potatoes.  A fast and easy meal for such great taste.  Thanks!

Mmm this is great on pork or beef steaks.  My husband was worried about the meat drying out but it was perfect.  You can double the "marinade" and then make a delicious gravy (with the unused portion of the marinade) for potatoes to go with it.

Very nice recipe: excellent flavour, minimal ingredients, and very little prep work! I didn't rate it 5 stars because I only used a quarter of the salt called for, as well as low sodium bouillion. Any more salt would have been too much for us. I also added a sliced onion to the broth while the chops simmered, and thickened the gravy with a bit of flour. Will definitely make this again! I wasn't expecting such good flavour from something so simple :)

I followed the recipe exactly and found the chops a little bit salty for my taste. They turned out very nicely tender and moist, although next time, I think I will use boneless pork chops instead.

I followed this recipe to the letter, but my chops turned out rather dry.  Perhaps i should have cooked them less?  Either way, the flavor was good.  Next time i'd skip the simmer and use the rub in combination with grilling.

Yummy! I used 'crazy mixed up pepper" because I like the way it looks in a gravy. Everyone loved it! I did use less salt, too. Our Family likes salt, though.

This is absolutely fabulous.  Thanks for a great recipe which could easily become a standby.  I used thick boneless chops, cut the salt to 1 tsp. as advised and added a little cornstarch/water to thicken at the end.  We all loved this and it's good enough for company.

I have made this twice, and it has been good, not great. Maybe I cooked it a bit too long, but the chops were a bit dry. Making a gravy from the broth mixture is the saving grace. I think I will try the onion and garlic to jazz up a bit.

I was pleased, but not Wow'ed by these. Used more sage than called for and used beef broth (low sodium) instead of a cube. Think it would have been better if I made gravy like the others did, but we are being healthy around here right now - will try thickening it up and using it another time.

Excellent dish.  I simmered the chops for 35 minutes instead of 45.  I also added a flour/water slurry to the sauce (after removing the chops) to make a nice gravy.

Tasty!  I did this according to the recipe except added a sliced onion, no added salt and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  I didn't cook as long as my chops weren't super thick.  They turned out wonderfully tender and with good flavor, but I wasn't head over heels about the gravy.  I'd like to try this again with chicken broth instead of beef, then I think it will be just right.  Boyfriend loved as is though!

i made these as directed with the exception of decreasing the salt to 1 tsp. & adding a dash more sage, then rubbing the dry spices into the chops as a marinade about 6 hours before frying them. i also added 1/2 sliced sweet onion & thickened the broth with a mix of 3 T. cornstarch/3 T. cold water. this dish served well over brown rice. my boyfriend thought dinner was delicious. thank you tiffany!

I modified this recipe a bit.  I didn't use any boullion and made a sauce out of red onions, green and red peppers, a little pinot grigio wine, and some butter.  I also stuffed the pork chop with cheddar, but I used the same spices on the pork chop beforehand.  This is definitely worth keeping, but I agree with everyone that the amount of salt in the recipe is too much.

This was great!  I cooked this for my fiance, who doesn't even like pork chops. (Shake and Bake flashbacks!)  He loved the chops.  I made a gravy from the broth, as a previous reviewer suggested.  Used a little cornstarch and water to thicken it.  Super tasty!

This was simple, but very good!  I didn't measure out the spices, just sprinkled on salt, pepper and dry sage, but it came out very tasty!  Also, after simmering, I removed the meat and cooked the boullion down into a gravy to pour on top.  That was very good, but might be better to thicken the boullion with flour instead as it got quite salty this way!  Also, I used the leftover meat on a salad and made up a dressing with lemon juice, salt, pepper and sage.  It was very good this way, too!  Overall, this is a very nice recipe!

This rating isnt really fair bcuz I changed the recipe.. but this was excellent!  I used my crock-pot since I had time, per other suggs. I mixed italian dry dressing w/ a shake of sage, then browned in butter.  Added browned meat to the crock pot w/ the h20/bouillion mixture and cooked 4+ hrs on high. Made gravy out of the juice and srvd w/ mashers.  Awesome all the way around!

These were yummy!  Very tender!  I cut back on the salt based on previous reviews.  I also carmelized some onions before adding the chops to the skillet.  I added a can of French Onion soup to the bouillon(low salt) and water.  Be sure to mix the spices well before rubbing on the chops; also distribute the rub evenly so you don't get too much spice in some areas (If the sage is too heavy, they can be similar in taste to sausage).  Will definitely make again.

Excellent tasting chops!  We had to eliminate the salt and use a low sodium beef broth due to health reasons, but this did not take away from the taste.  The whole family loved it!

The kids devoured these! But, unfortunatly my husband only likes pork chops battered and fried like his mother always made:( I still give it 5 stars because there is no comparison to momma's cookin'!

I loved this recipe!!  I did reduce the salt, but otherwise I thought this was fantastic.  I loved it, hubby and the kiddies loved it too!  This is a great recipe, and one that you can play with too adding other herbs if you want a bit of variety. This will be one I make often!  Our favourite new pork chop recipe! Thank you thank you thank you!!

very easy to make and quite tasty and tender.  i used boneless chops, added onions, cut the salt in half and used very low sodium chicken broth.  i think it would be good with mushrooms added too.

I made the changes recommended by others...cut way on the salt, kept an eye on them while cooking to avoid drying them out.  I think it's a good basic pork chop recipe...but you definitely need to reduce the salt in the recipe.

I'd like to have given this recipe 2 1/2 stars, but couldn't make myself rate it a 3, sorry.  I made as directed but used only 1/2 the salt called for (should'nt have used any).  They were beautiful in the pan after browning.  I used boneless chops, so I decreased the cooking time, but they were still pretty tough and dry.  I thickened the broth with cornstarch as another viewer suggested, but geeeeez...the salt!  We did eat them, but I'm afraid I won't make again, even without all that salt.

These chops were SUPER SALTY!!  I would cut the salt out of the rub altogether as beef boullion is salty enough.  I also agree with another reviewer who said the pepper was a bit dominating.  I think I will reduce the pepper and add some onion powder or something to the rub.  I also think this recipe would work well with big thick chops.

They had a nice flavor, but they were very dry.  I make breaded pork chops once a week and they are never dry.  I used bone-in, about 3/4" thick, but they were definately overdone if you follow the directions.  My 7 yr old daughter said she felt like she was eating the inside of her shoe.

some of the best pork chops i've ever made off the grill.  They were extremely tender and moist.  My hubby ate the leftovers for 2 other meals that week. I used a can of beef broth as suggested in another review.  We also only had ground sage so with the other seasonings i mixed it in and covered each side of the porkchop. We're making these again tonight.  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I must've done something wrong with this even though I followed it to the letter, chops were dry and tasteless.  I think Tony was being kind when he said they were okay.  I may try again for benefit of the doubt.

This recipe is excellent.  I used the thick cut boneless pork chops and rubbed the sage and some granulated garlic on each side, covered and refrigerated for a couple of hours.  Browned them in the butter and some black pepper and cayenne red pepper. As some reviews mentioned thickening the broth with a little cornstarch and water made excellent gravy.  The chops turns out very moist and tasty.  We will make again - soon!

These chops were tasy but extremely salty.  After I cooked the pork chops I had to simmer them an additional 10 minutes in just plain water to get rid of some of the saltiness.  I probably won't make them again.

This recipe turned out great!  I omitted the salt as others suggested and I'm glad I did.  The beef bouillon was salty enough.  My chops were about 1.5 inches thick-I simmered for about 20 minutes.  I'm definitely planning to try this method with other spices like garlic, parsley, ground mustard, etc.  Thanks so much for this great recipe!

This was finger-licking, bone-sucking good!I drastically cut down on the salt based on previous reviews. I added some garlic powder to the pork chops and cut up some onions in the butter. Who knew sage could be so tasty? :) Thanks alot!

Excellent, easy, and tender w/ tremendous flavor! What more could you ask for! I did use garlic salt instead of regular and sauteed some garlic in w/ the pork. Served w/ a salad and crusty bread. The aroma is fantastic!

This was very good I didn't use as much salt and used a little more sage. I did use Iowa chops which are about 2in thick.  I would have given 5 stars but the meat was a little dry, but that may have been my falt I have a little trouble with dry pork chops.  But it was good and I will make them again and perhaps not cook them as long, maybe 20 min

I liked these.  I did only use half the salt and sage since the broth already has a lot of salt in it.  I only had 4 pork chops.  I will make it again.  Very easy.

This was ok. Not a real hit at my house. It was tender but a bit on the salty side. I probably won't make again. I really couldn't taste much of the sage either.

good, not great.  kids enjoyed it and will make again.  cut salt to at the most 1 tsp. and double water to cut back on salty taste - 1 boullion usually goes with 1 cup water.  1 tsp. pepper may be too much for younger kids. watch cooking time too. 45 minutes too long

I agree with the previous reviewer. This recipe is way too salty. However, my husband, the saltaholic, wolfed his down. The next time I make it, I will not rub the chops with salt, and will add a few more things to the bouillon broth to cut down on the saltiness. I also used 3 tbsp cornstarch/3 tbsp water to thicken for gravy. Not a 5-star recipe, but will try it again - with adjustments.

This was extremely tasty!!!  I used boneless chops and did as others and thickened the sauce with cornstarch.  We all just marveled at how delicious this recipe was. It is good enough for company and we will definitely make this yummy recipe again.

Simple and delicious.  Meat was moist and very flavorful.  I reduced the remaining cooking juices to serve as au jus (I watched the salt content having used Miner's Beef stock instead of bouillon cubes), hubby loved it.  Thanks!

When I prepared this recipe I discovered I didn't have any sage so I used marjorum instead and it was delicious.  Easy to make and tender.  Just don't use the pan juices for a gravy because they are toooooo salty!

I skipped the butter and used a non stick pan.  They browned much better.  Very moist and delicious.  My 3 year old ate them like it was her last meal!

LOVED these. Followed others advice and reduced salt. Added a slurry of cornstarch and water to thicken sauce slightly. Just wonderful! Served with gorgonzola polenta and truly impressed the guests!

Very good. Served with white rice so the "gravy" was put over the rice. Family thought it was yummy. I also omitted the salt from the chops and they were fine.

Good flavour but the cooking time needs to be tweaked.  I seared my 3/4" chops for two minutes each side and then braised for 30 minutes but they were still overdone.  Next time I will braise for 20 minutes.  I omitted the salt and added sauteed mushrooms to the broth, which was a nice touch.

I did not read the reviews prior to preparing this, but I did think that 2 tsp. salt combined with beef bouillon would make i a tad salty, so I cut back from the very beginning.

Suggestion: add some garlic to the butter and if you do not have sage, try some tarragon -- the aromas in my kitchen had me bouncing off the wall!

Great basic recipe!

These chops got rave reviews from my boyfirend (can't speak for them myself, as I'm a vegetarian). I used butterflied chops, so I did reduce the cook time and I also added cornstarch w/cold water to thicken. The sauce became more of a gravy which was very well-received. Thanks!

These were pretty good. I didn't add the salt and they still came out pretty salty from the boullion. I did add flour and milk at the end to make gravy.

I have never reviewed a recipe before but have been getting my recipes from this site for a long long time.  This recipe is absolutely delicious and my husband think so as well.  I didn't cook the chops as long because they were butterflied, but they remained tender which was a concern that I realized once I got them home.  This will be my pork chop recipe I use always.  Excellent with mashed potatoes and a vegetable.

My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe. Even my finicky 4 yr old liked it. It IS a bit on the salty side, so I have cut back on the salt, and just used the boullion. Ohterwise, it has become a staple in our household, as my husband doesn't like breaded meats.

Nice flavor. I used 3 pork chops and cut the seasonings in half. I found this dish to be too salty for my taste. Next time, I will salt at my plate if needed. I used a little butter and olive oil and chopped garlic when browning. I also used cornstarch and cold water to thicken. This made for a tasty sauce to pour over the chops.

Was good.  My husband even liked it and he is never a fan of pork chops.  But the pork chops were dry so I was thank for the gravy.  (added 3 T of cornstarch to 3 T of cold water) Added to the broth.

These are the best pork chops I have ever made!  Absolutely delicious!  I used 4 boneless and cut the salt in half.  I have to say the best part was the gravy.  I thickened the sauce with a little cornstarch and we almost licked our plates!  Thank you!!!

The boys gobbled these right up and looked for more. I thickened the cooking liquid with a little cornstarch dissolved in water after removing the cooked chops, as per another reviewer's suggestion. Great with mashed potatoes and veggies. Next time I'll decrease the salt to 1 tsp. because I did find them a bit too salty-tasting. Otherwise, great recipe Tiffany! Thanks.

Quite yummy and easy!  Very flavorful.  Next time I will thicken the sauce to make gravy (but right now my husband's diet forbids that......).

I reduced the salt, and added sauted onions and garlic (but did use the bullion cubes).

This is a great recipe - it's easy to make and allows time to get your side dishes ready. I just guess on the seasoning, but I would say I use a little more than the recipe calls for for extra flavor.  Thanks!

Very good.  Added onions, will add mushrooms next time also.  Made broth into a gravy at the end.  Herb gravy was great over garlic mashed potatoes!

Great taste.  I had a bit of difficulty evenly rubbing the spices on the pork chops - I had to add more sage to ensure they were evenly covered.  Great recipe.

Loved these! Will make again. We used boneless thin chops.
Very easy. We used chicken broth rather than beef flavored cubes. Thanx for the recipe!

These chops were delicious!  I used chicken broth instead of beef bouillion (enough to cover the chops completely).  I also put my chops in the slow cooker for 3 hours after I sauted the chops...they were yummy and not at all dry!!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

I loved how easy and wonderful this recipe was!  I may sub the bouillon with some broth to cut down on the salt the next time.  Otherwise, this recipe yieled a very tasty and juicy porkchop.

I used a pork tenderloin and it was not only delicious, but when you slice into pieces, it looks very pretty on the plate. I will definitely make this again.

The pork chops were very tasty and it was so easy to make.  I will simmer the pork only 1/2 hour next time and will probably use a thicker cut.  Will make this again!! Thank you!

Thanks, Ms. Nixon, for the recipe. It's an excellent taste that's easy to prepare! Following the suggestions of past reviewers, I used ready-made beef broth (two cans of low sodium variety) and some cooking wine instead of the bouillon cubes. It turned out moist without being overly-salted. My husband enjoyed it, too.

I served the 1.5in thick chops with Sauerkraut and cooked yellow squash.

I actually joined the forum to add my two cents-these were amazing-I'm so used to just throwing the pork chops in the oven and waiting for the dried out leathery things to come out so I can hide them under sauce or gravy-UNTIL NOW! these were one pan on top of the stove (I heated the boullion in microwave)I also used ground sage to taste, as I had no dried on hand My husband who is the pickiest guy I know said that these were on the top of the list-and thanked me for taking the time to prepare such a delicious meal when I have the 3 kids all day....our little secret!  Thanks so much!

I was about to give up on pork chops and gave them one last chance with this recipe.  I'm so glad I tried it because it turned out GREAT!  My husband loved the chops, I loved them, and most importantly my kids loved them!  I took another reviewer's advice and cut the salt back to 1 teaspoon, but followed the recipe exactly after that.  Yummy!

I agree that the salt should be taken down a bit.  But other than that, this recipe is INCREDIBLE!  I made it for my husband the other night, and he said that my cooking had surpassed his mom's! (which is a compliment--she's an excellent good cook)  The pork was so tender, you could cut it with a fork!!

All I can say is YUM!  I double the amount of spices in the rub.  But I do that to almost all my recipies!  Oh, and I used Kosher Salt instead of regular table... it really made it tasty!

Very tasty. Nice change of pace, you absolutely have to like sage, which unfortunatly I now know my husband doesn't, but I really liked them. Classy dinner with no fuss.
