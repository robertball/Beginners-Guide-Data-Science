I love dill and I love sour cream but I'm being generous giving this 3 stars. Since the submitter didn't specify what type of potatoes, I used red skinned and left the skin on, the type of vinegar also wasn't specified so I used white wine vinegar and cut that down to only 1/2 tsp.  I upped the dill to one Tbsp. and left out the veg. oil and dill pickles as I thought those two ingredients in particular would ruin this completely. I won't be making this again.....

A surprising disappointment.  This was a beautiful salad that appeared to have everything going for it.  I used fresh dill and lots of it.  Knowing I don't like an overpowering vinegar tang, I cut back on the vinegar to two tablespoons.  I mixed in the sour cream and, because it was so pretty at that point, speckled with its flecks of fresh dill, green onion and celery, reluctantly added the chopped dill pickle - and I almost immediately knew I would regret it.  Unfortunately, this was still too vinegary, all but obliterating the fresh taste of the dill, celery and green onion and the mellow creaminess of the sour cream. This would have been so much better with very little or even NO vinegar,  especially if you're  going to add the dill pickle,  which I really would have preferred left out altogether.  And come to think of it, I'm not sure what the need for the oil was.  That could have easily been left out as well.  I have a feeling there will be lots of leftovers.

This was a little too tangy for my taste.  I would go easy on the vinegar.

This potato was very fresh tasting.  We used fresh dill from our garden.  Definitely a keeper.

My husband especially liked this because he isn't a fan of mayonnaise-based potato salads.  It tasted a lot like baked potatoes.

Love it.  Not a potato salad fan, especially mustard style, but, I love this.  I have made it twice, and the 2nd time I ommitted tomatoes and added the pickles immediately, then let it chill.  Brought it to a tailgate and everyone loved it.

I made this for a cookout & everyone loved it. I used steamed red potatoes and a handful of fresh dill. I didn't measure the sour cream, but I'm sure it was more. Instead of regular vinegar I used two tablespoons of white wine vinegar. I topped with three tomatoes.

Excellent! Even my supposed potato salad hating fiance had seconds of this. I omitted the green onions and sprinkled in a little garlic powder. We loved it, thank you! :)

Two very important tips will improve your potato salad for life!  First, boil the diced potatoes in water with 1 teaspoon of vinegar added.  This will make the potatoes hold their shape well.  Second, while the potatoes are cooking, mix up the oil, vinegar, s&p, and lots of dill.  Drain the potatoes and immediately toss the hot potatoes with the dressing.  Let stand at room temp until cool.  This makes the potatoes soak up all that good flavor.  Then add the rest of the ingredients, adding sour cream and pickles before serving.  Follow this tip for all your potato salad recipes (toss with vinegar) and you'll never have bland potato salad again.

Very nice and refreshing.  I didn't add the oil, pickle or tomato.  Might try adding pickle and tomato next time, but didn't miss the oil.  Nice crunch to it.

I tried this because I'm not really a fan of traditional potato salad, but I should have listened to other reviewers--quite bland!  At the very least, it needs more salt.

I made this tonight for the second time.  Both times my crowd loved it.  Although I love vinegar its a little overpowering.  This was better with Salata, a German seasoned mild vinegar, rather than with white vinegar.  I also added more dill to it.  Potato salad is a hard dish for me to make being allergic to mayo and miracle whip.  This was a hit with my family and we will make it again!

If you make this as it is written it is horrible. All the changes folks have made probably DO make it better but it is sour at best and just tastes rotten, literally!  Sorry!!

Okay, I was not a huge fan of the salad, but my friend loved it so it got 4 stars.  I used more than 4 cups of potatoes (probably close to double that) and just eyeballed the sour cream.  I made this up the night before and added on an extra tbs of balsamic vinegar as well as garlic powder and doubled the amount of dill.  It really needed it!  I also added in the pickles the night before as well and let them sit with everything else.  I have a friend who cannot eat mayo, so she was very excited about this recipe and said it tasted just like real potato salad.  The guys dug it and I was just not feeling it.  It's not bad, but I think the Tangy Potato Salad recipe from this site is way better!

This recipe is awsome! My family just loved it and I didn't even add the oil or vinegar. Hard to believe some thought it was bland.

I liked the fact that this potato salad was a little different from the usual tangy ones made with mustard and/or Miracle Whip.  I found the subtler taste quite pleasing and so did my guests.  It turns out that as we sat down to eat the late afternoon sun was shining in on the table and everybody commented that not only did it taste good, but it was very pretty too!

I'm kind of indifferent towards this recipe.  Maybe I'm biased because I'm more of a mustard potato salad person, but this recipe is was somewhat too bland for my liking.

Found it to be too bland.  May be better with Miracle Whip instead of sour cream.  Not a keeper.

Not a favorite.. A bit too creamy with not much of a taste. Needed something to add a bit more flavor.
