We thought it was just okay.  It was missing something and maybe garlic would help the flavor.  The servings are generous, I'd say it serve 4.

This was really good, and quick too. The only thing I added was some garlic. We had it tonight,  Hubby is still talking about it.

Quick, simple and inexpensive, not to mention delcious! We added a little extra cream cheese to thicken the sauce, and would suggest a little more pasta than what it is recommended.

This was outstanding. The only change I made was to add a little garlic.

This is so good. My boyfriend loved this. I did add garlic to the olive oil when I was browning the chicken. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This was great. Easy to make for me. A novice chef. I did add the garlic. That was nice. I cooked extra pasta 4 oz, and it was too much. Used up too much sauce. So I would stick with the 2 oz recommended or increase the sauce by 1/2. Flavor was great. Even my husband was like " you made this "
