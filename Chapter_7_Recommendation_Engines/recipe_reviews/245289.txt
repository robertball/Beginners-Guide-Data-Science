Oh MY, what a good muffin for Christmas!!!  The eggnog, rum and nutmeg tastes are very subtle but combine to make a delicious muffin, wowser.  Wish I had some chopped pecans, could only make it better!

Not sure if I did something wrong, but very dry and tasteless... followed the recipe with no changes.

A great way to use up the eggnog at the end of the season.  I just made a few minor changes:  substituted one cup of the flour with whole wheat flour and added a teaspoon more of baking powder; used one small very ripe banana, because I had it, and added enough oil to make 1/3 cup; substituted pumpkin pie spice, because I had that and no nutmeg; used a little less sugar than called for.  Then I made mini muffins so I could take them to work and share with the whole office.  Everyone loved them!

On day 1, the taste was a little bland, but the next morning, the egg nog flavor really came through. Definitely a make-ahead, which makes it handy for the Xmas season.
