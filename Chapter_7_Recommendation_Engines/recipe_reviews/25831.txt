After reading some of the other reviews, I added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1 cup chopped walnuts and 1 cup chocolate chips. I used a size 40 cookie scoop and baked them for 15 minutes. These cookies have been a huge hit! One of my friends has tasted dozens of different types of cookies that I've made, and she told me she thought this was the best thing I've ever made! These are super delicious and super easy...a definate keeper!

The grocery store I work at makes these same cookies in the bakery!!!  We add Chocolate Chips and 1/4-1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and they fly off of the shelves for $6 a half dozen!!!  Great recipe!

I thought to myself-"There is just NO WAY these are going to be good with only 2 ingredients..." But, I was in a rush and needed something fast.  I couldn't help myself-I added an egg to the 2 ingredients to help bind it together.  I frosted them with a canned cream cheese frosting. The cookies were well received by 12 kids and their moms, earning me high praises.  Thanks Tonia for making me look so good, so easily.  It was like eating the tops of a cupcake-the very best part!  I sprayed the pans with Pam, and the cookies didn't stick.  Mine were not gooey as some described, but I bet theirs just needed a little longer in the oven. (all ovens are different) This recipe is delicious, kid friendly, and easy to prepare and that makes it a winner (and a recipe you hand out to others)!

I prefer the taste and texture of gingerbread to fluffy cake, so I used a box of gingerbread mix, plus half of a 15-oz can of pumpkin. I ended up with soft, dense, moist, spicy cookies that I will make again and again! Make sure you grease the cookie sheet, though, because the lack of added oil makes them stick...

I make a recipe similar to this one for muffins... The only difference that I add a 1/3 cup of water and bake them according to spice cake directions for cupcakes. They are delish and only 2 points according to weight watchers.

This is the perfect quick cookie!  I don't like pumpkin cookies unless they are cake-like in texture, and this one certainly fits the bill.  I didn't have a spice cake mix on hand, though.  I used a white cake mix and added 2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp ginger, and a couple dashes of nutmeg, as well as 1/2 c raisins.  I also baked the cookies on parchment paper sprayed with nonstick spray, flattened them slightly before baking with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar, and took them out at exactly nine minutes.  I don't know how they tast cold, because I've eaten several straight out of the oven, and they are terrific!

Great cookie! I don't know what the other reviewers were talking about when they said it would make a better cake.  This makes a great cookie.  Really cute!  The cookie doesn't spread much while cooking so you end up with this little tall cookie.  I used a melon ball scooper to drop the dough onto the pan and it was perfect! You absolutely have to use cream cheese icing though, because they aren't sweet enough on their own.  I used these for a preschool thanksgiving party and they were a kit with parents and kids! Yum Yum, these cookies were delicious and very very cute!

It's an easy and delicious recipe, but they just don't seem like cookies. Something was off about them... the consistency, I think. However, I tried it again and put the whole mix into a 9x13 greased baking dish and cooked it for about 17 minutes. After it had cooled, I put some cream cheese frosting on it, and cut it up into squares. It was fantastic!

I made this as a cake and baked it for 30 or so minutes at 325, then when cool I added cinnamon walnut cream cheese frosting to make a decadent top to a fat free cake.  It was awesome!  I recommend this highly- it tasted just like carrot cake with cream cheese frosting!

Awesome recipe! Could it get any easier? The best part is everyone thinks I must have slaved over these delicious morsels. Definitely a big hit at parties! Anti-cooking friends have even been turned on to cooking by these. Definitely let “cool completely” as the recipe states. I cook for 14-16 min., let thoroughly cool and then keep refrigerated. They are moist, because they are supposed to be cake-like. In my experience, the gooeyness, however, can be prevented by cooking longer and avoiding warm or humid storage conditions. Of course, these cookies are always such a big hit with my friends and family that they are usually gobbled up before much storage is needed.

A PERFECT PUMPKIN COOKIE!  As mentioned by another reviewer, our local grocery store sells these exact cookies for approximately $4 per half dozen.  I was on a quest to find a similar cookie and this is it!  I followed the recipe and added 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and mixed it all together in my mixer until it was smooth.  I used a medium sized cookie scoop and got approximately 3 dozen cookies.  I baked them at 350 for 15 minutes and the result was fantastic: moist and delicious!  I topped them with "Cream Cheese Frosting II" from this site and the family LOVES them.  Only 12 hours after making them, they were nearly gone.  This is an excellent and simple recipe and I plan on making these throughout the fall/winter seasons! YUM!

UPDATE: I DECIDED TO USE SOME OF MY CREAM CHEESE FROSTING ON THE COOKIES I HAD TODAY. ALTHOUGH GREAT WITHOUT, THESE WERE AWESOME WITH IT!!! Yum! These are FANTASTIC!!! My hubs and I treated our new neighbors to dinner at our favorite Mexican hangout and in turn, they gifted us with spiced wine and the most delicious pumpkin cookies I've EVER tasted. My hubs is not a fan of anything pumpkin, so I was the one to INHALE (yes, inhale...) them! :) I haven't been able to ask my neighbor for her cookie recipe, so I decided to see what I could find on here. To my surprise, these taste EXACTLY like the ones she made us! My only change was to add 1/2 t pumpkin pie spice, simply because I had some handy. I purchased a container of prepared cream cheese frosting, but decided to not use any of it (these are perfect as is, IMHO). NOTE: If placing your cookies in an airtight container, DO NOT seal them until completely cooled. If you do, the steam that condenses on the lid of your container will make your cookies gummy. This in no way affects the flavor, but they will be a bit sticky (which is off putting). Thanks for sharing such a great recipe, CARRUTH! This one's going in my "keeper" file for sure. :-)

This recipe did not work for me. I guess I made mine too big, but it took a lot longer to cook. (I used a tablespoon full) My 1st batch I took out at 12 minutes, because I was worried they would be overdone. Bad idea. They were not cooked in the middle. The next batch I made a little smaller, and cooked for 15 minutes. They were done, and my kids did like them so that was good. Just be warned...do the toothpick test on them before you take them out of the oven. Also, don't expect them to flatten out while baking. Whatever they look like when you spoon them out, that is what they will look like when they are done. They don't look appetizing!

I changed this recipe enough that it isn't even the same recipe, but here goes!  First, I couldn't find spice cake mix at the store so I used yellow cake mix and stirred in about 1 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  In addition to the pumpkin, I added two eggs and a tsp of vanilla.   All of this got a good beating from my stand mixer, and then I stirred in half a bag of chocolate chips and half a bag of cinnamon chips (just because I had them lying around!).  The batter was then spread in a greased 13X9 inch pan and baked at 350 for about 22 minutes.  Cooled and cut into squares, I got a moist, delicious bar that doesn't need frosting at all.  My kids are going to love it when they come home.  Even though I altered the recipe so much, I had to comment just to say that I love a versatile recipe like this that is very good on its own also serves as the perfect starting point for cooks who like to try something different.  Thanks!  p.s.  It also makes good muffins, minus the chips but frosted with cream cheese frosting!

This is the PERFECT easy Fall cookie Recipe!  The only thing I did differently was to use Easy Pumkin Pie Mix in the can by Libby instead of the packed Pumpkin as stated in the recipe(both are located next to each other on the store shelf). It gives it more "boost" to the spice flavors since the Easy Pumpkin Pie mix also contains spices.  I also added 1 cup of chocolate chips and when eaten just out of the over, they are heavenly!  Definately making these for my son's Fall Festival! Five Stars!

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  I added mini chocolate chips to mine, and "squished" them down a bit after dropping so they baked more evenly.  (Figured this out for the second batch.)  They're a perfect clone of the ones I wait all year for in the store, but with a fraction of the fat and calories.  I'll definitely be adding them to my repertoire!

Decent for how easy it is. They were soft and gooey, maybe they need to be cooked more like 15 minutes? After the first batch of soft muffin-top like cookies, I added oats and an egg to the dough, hoping to make them more "cookie-like". It worked. They are still quite soft, but they are denser so it is more like a cookie. Both sets were quite popular. I'd make it again with plenty of oats.

I did not care for this recipe.  These hardly qualify as cookies.  It's more like a muffin texture, and a tough, chewy one at that.  Frosting wouldn't rescue these cookies either.  I'm off to find an edible pumpkin recipe.

I'm another person who did not like these cookies. They were too moist and gooey, especially in the center. I even baked them for 15 minutes. I ended up throwing them out. I have made other cake mix cookies and they always came out fine.  What could I (and the other low raters) have done wrong??

These are so good!  I added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup of chocolate chips, took them to work, and they were gone by 9:00 am!  I had to bake them for 12-14 minutes because they were so gooey at 10 minutes, but maybe that's just my oven.

DON'T BELIEVE THE HYPE!  These turned out mushy and ugly and not very cookie-like.  I baked them for 15 minutes and they were still gooey in the center, and not in a good way!  Try the Iced Pumpkin Cookie recipe on this site, they are delicious.

These cookies are great! The batter was a bit sticky and hard to work with, but just a bit. The cookies were delicious, moist with a great flavor.

The texture was too spongy and really fluffy. No one in my family liked them. I used a Duncan Hines Spice cake mix.

Added a little extra spice and cooked each cookie sheet about 20 min. Cream cheese frosting is a must!

As is this is a wonderfull cookie. Didn't have a spice cake mix in the house but I did have a can of pumpkin. Added 4 tsp. pumpkin pie spice to a reduced sugar yellow cake mix and 1 tsp cardamom, mixed to togeather before adding the pumpkin. Then I added 1/2 cup Craisens, 1/2 cup chopped nuts & 1/2 cups Cinnamon chips.  Too good.

Great idea- I added pumkin pie spice (about 1/2 tsp) and white chocolate chips; I think they would be too bland without some kind of addition. I love the way the house smelled while these were baking!

These were a hit!  I realized too late that I only had pumpkin pie mix & not solid pack pumpkin, so I used that with a butter yellow cake mix, added a bit of cinnamon, sprinkled cinnamon sugar on top of each cookie, and baked for 12 minutes.  They were good right out of the oven, if not a bit sweeter than I expected.  Sweetness was mostly due to the pie mix, though.  They were a little crusty on the outside & soft in the middle initially, but overnight while stored loosely covered they became moist on the outside as well.  I called them pumpkin muffin top cookies & both parents & children gobbled them up & raved.  I will definitely bake these again with just plain pumpkin & perhaps try a few cranberries, raisins, or mini choc chips as mix-ins, too.  **Update** I baked these again with solid pack pumpkin and a chocolate cake mix, added a splash of vanilla extract, then sprinkled cinnamon sugar on them before baking for 12 and a half minutes.  They weren't spectacular right out of the oven but were great the next day.  Got rave reviews & requests for the recipe.  As an experiment I stored half in a plastic container with the lid just placed on top & half on a paper plate with another paper plate on top.  The ones with just a paper plate on top stayed dry to the touch even the next day.  Not sure how they would hold up longer than that though, because they are all gone!*****Update #2***** Finally made these with Spice cake mix.  They were my least favorite.

Ok, I've tried the Two Ingredient cake recipe (from this site) but I did not realize you could do the same with cookies. I only changed it a bit. I added white chocolate chips and about 2 Tbs milk (to aid in the mixing).  I made them a little larger and baked them for about 12 minutes to get them slightly browned on the bottom.  These came out very rich, fluffy and irresistable!  My only complaint is I should have doubled the recipe!

Fabulous fall flavor and absolutely simple to make!  How can it get easier with only two ingredients in the base recipe?  I added one egg, 1 cup chocolate chips, and drizzled melted cream cheese frosting over the tops (about 2-3 tbsp. melted for 30 seconds in the microwave tops 12 cookies).  Love the fall aroma throughout my home, and the pumpkin-spicy taste can't be beat.  Will make for get-togethers throughout the season!

This is a great and simple recipe.  Due to lack of spice cake mix and the only can of pumpkin I had was 29 oz., I used one box of banana cake (not bread) and one box of yellow cake mix.  I then added 12 oz. of white chocolate chips and 6 oz. of "Craisins", 2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice and 1 tsp. of cloves.  I am the master mixer!  I had to increase the bake time to 15 min.  Maybe because one of the cake mixes had pudding in the mix or because my rounded tsp. was large.  Flattening them a little before baking makes them bake and look a little better.  Again, mine were "higher" because of pudding in the cake mix.  These are GREAT!!!!!

I took the suggestion of some of the other bakers. I used yellow cake mix, 1-1/2 cups of pumpkin puree, 2 tsps. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. ginger, 2 dashes of nutmeg and 2 cups of raisins. After blending very well I was able to drop by teaspoon. Baked for 15 minutes and had a cake-like consistency. My yield was 84 cookies. They went in a flash!

This was the best and easist recipe for the holiday season, or anytime.  They are so moist.  They are on top of my cookie list from now on.  May need to adjust for raisins and high altitude cooking.  I LOVE this recipe.

Wow, for something so simple these are really great. I made half the batch as stated and the other half I added some pumpkin pie spice and semisweet chocolate chips. I loved the doctored up ones, but some of my friends preferred the original ones. It's nice to have a cookie that isn't that horrible for you! I'll make these again very soon, thank you!! :)

These are not very much like cookies--more like very small cakes. Appearance-wise they look funny. They rise quite a lot.  They taste better after sitting for awhile--they become very moist.

This is the perfect fall cookie recipe. Very easy and very tasty! I took the recommendation of previous reviewers and mixed in one egg to bind the ingredients together. These cookies are so moist they will last well over one week! I used them for two parties at my house within 6 days!

I have been making this for a couple of years now, and wanted to add a GLUTEN FREE option.  I am sure there is probably one on here, but just in case...we used the can of pumpkin, one egg, gluten free spice cake mix that makes two 9-inch layers, and about half of a bag of mini chocolate chips.  These came out BETTER than the original!  We made them for a friend with sensitivity, and the gluten free mix is more expensive, but I WILL be making this again before I use the garden variety cake mix!  Very flavorful, very spice-flavored, and had a nice crispish texture to the outside.  No gummy results for us this time as we have had in the past.  Baked them at 375 for about 12-13 minutes and they were WONDERFUL!

These are great and so incredibly easy! I threw in some white chocolate chips to give them a little something extra and it was a great addition. I wish that they were a little flatter and crispier instead of so cake-like but I guess that is expected for a cake mix cookie. I will definitely keep this on hand!

These were definitely easy to make, but as written they are a little less sweet than I would like, and I even sprinkled cinnamon and sugar on the tops before baking. I think adding a cream cheese icing drizzle would do the trick. I also didn't like the spice cake mix as much as I thought I would, I may try these again using a cinnamon swirl cake mix or something and make an icing as well.

This cookies are great but they cook exactly the way you put them on the sheet.  I recommend pouning the cookie sheet on the counter so the dough flattens out.  I always add chocolate chips - their the bomb!

These are not very good.  They have no taste when made as written.  When I mixed up the batter, I considered adding some cinnamon, nutmeg, etc -- pumpkin pie spices.  Then I thought I'd just try the recipe as directed and see how it turns out.  As I said -- no flavor.  They may be better if you add some spices, but really, it's not much harder to make a pumpkin cookie or pumpkin bar from scratch and they would be much, much better than these.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because they are incredibly easy, but your effort, or lack thereof, will show.  Personally I feel better about spending an extra 10 or 15 minutes to make something worthwhile, than spend 5 minutes for something so bland.  I'm sorry to say that anyone who is impressed by these cookies has not experienced true homemade baking.

Too easy!  I did add about 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice, as per other reviews.  To half, I added some chocolate chips, but I will admit the ones without the chocolate are much, much better (and I love chocolate!)  Start to finish it took less than an hour - can't beat that.  In addition, it is cheap and healthier than most cookies!  Will make again!

I just made these cookies, I did add 1 egg and a dash of ground cloves.  Too bad I only used 1 box of the cake mix.  They are excellent.  This is going to be my Christmas cookie for my gift baskets, and everyone will think I cooked all day.

I think these were very delicious!  I added some chocolate chips and used a cookie scoop and put them on parchment paper lined cookie sheets.  They turned out very moist.

Holy cow super simple! I did add chocolate chips and my family loved them. This is the absolute go to recipe when you need a "quick cook".

This recipe is FANTASTIC!  I am not a kitchen person at all!  I wanted something easy and quick.  These cookies are so tasty, its unbelievable that it was so easy to make.  I added 1 tsp of Pumpkin Pie Spice, and I used canned cream cheese icing to top them.  I baked them for 17 min and I feel that was the perfect amount of time.  I used 2 different trays, so I did 7 minutes of each, then switched from top shelf to bottom, and then just added 3 more minutes...PERFECT!  I made them for a School function, but I can seriously go eat that whole batch!  Mine were about a size of golfball when I scooped them.  I was able to get 28 cookies from this batch.  AMAZING!!!!!  I will make these for Thanksgiving next week!

Too sweet, and the spice cake flavor overwhelms. The texture is cake-like and becomes slightly rubbery after a day or so.

My daughter liked them though, so I guess it's a matter of taste/preference. For that, and the convenience of only needing two ingredients, I rate it 3 stars.

Okay, call me weird...but I was skeptical how good GREAT cookies need only two ingredients.  I am in a "clean pantry" mode before we move in four weeks.  I ingredient searched spice cake mix and found this recipe and found (for whatever reason, I am NOT a baker) I had a can of pumpkin..well, let me tell you THESE ARE NOT JUST GREAT BUT SUPERB!  I made my first dozen w/o choc chips (and baked them for 9 min) it was like eating a small pumpkin pie (I used the spice cake mix and a can of pumpkin).  The second dozen I added the choc chips to (as suggested by other reviewers)--yum!  I would suggest these cookies again and again.yumm!

I only had a carrot cake mix and not much time, so I took the advice of another review and baked it for 18-19 minutes in a greased 13 x 9 pan and it was so moist. Very good! Very easy! Disappeared quickly! A great snack cake!

Oh my! I am a BIG TIME chocolate fan and pretty much only make cookies that include chocolate. But, I made these and they are my NEW fav! Topped with cream cheese frosting or just as they are, these cookies are super easy and yummy! (I did use pumpkin pie filling instead of plain pumpkin!)

This was quick and easy. I did however find that adding mini chocolate chips and 1 egg made it quick, easy and extremely tssty.

These cookies are excellent. However you can also add 1 cup of chocolate chips to make them a lil' bit sweeter. It takes the same baking time and temperature. Enjoy!

Wow, I couldn't believe how good these were. So moist and full of flavor. Only changes I made was adding a few dashes of pumpkin pie spice and frosting them while they were still a little warm with cream cheese frosting. Even my picky 13-year-old gobbled these up! So did my hubby....will be making again real soon!

Yum! I couldn't believe it, it only took me 1 minute to whip up the batter for these cookies, and they turned out very delicious. They taste like the pumpkin cookies from the bakery, very soft, moist and fluffy. The only thing that they were missing is chocolate chips! I will make these again.

2 ingredients?  what could be any easier.  Followed recipe as written with no changes.  Lightly sprayed the cookie sheets and didn't have any problems with sticking.  I removed from the sheet after about one minute and they slid right off nicely.  Very nice taste...not sickening sweet.  Cookie scoop made this very easy.  Thanks for the advice to keep these in the fridge so they don't get a jelly-like texture.  Beautiful cookie and oh so low fat!

Talk about easy!  When I crave pumpkin bread, I'll do this instead. It's practically instant. This is great stuff. Also, for the kids I made a batch with some White Chips added in. YUMMY! Try it, it adds a touch of creamy sweetness that the kids loved.

This gets the top rating for ease of preparation and tastiness factor!  I've made these cookies several times now -- sometimes I vary the ingredients a bit, adding nuts or chocolate chips, and frosting them with a cream-cheese based frosting if I feel like it.  They come out wonderfully every time!

These were so great & ez. Love. I added chopped walnuts to mine & when they were cooled down I added cream cheese frosting & each one got a candy corn on the top. Yum. I also made mine just shy of a teaspoon so they were more bite size. Try 'em.

I rate this 5 stars because of it simplicity.  The recipe is wonderfully simple and makes a moist low fat cookie.  I frosted them with a thin layer of cream cheese frosting.  Next time I will add chocolate chips and walnuts.

I loved this recipe, it was moist.  They didn't even last a day in my house.  How could you not like this recipe with only two ingredients.  I am a busy mom and grandma who works and I need really quick recipes and this was great. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I added a dash of ginger and some raisins and choclate chips with good results.  This is our families new favorite way to make choc chip cookies.  They were easy to bake at high altitude and had a pleasing texture.

Sorry, gals... I know this rating will bring down the rating overall, but I did not like these cookies. They didn't look appetizing and they barely tasted any better. This, of course, is only my opinion. If you're reading this, make them... what've you got to lose? Your ingredients will only cost you a couple of bucks.

I was really unsure what to think of this recipe because they tasted delicious but I didn't like the texture at all.  The longer they sat, the gooier they got, but the better they tasted!  I think I would try it as a cake recipe next time, add some buttercream or cream cheese icing.  I think it would make a great low-fat cake.

So easy!! My 4 and 7 yo daughters made them! I couldn't find spice cake. So I got carrot cake and added some cinnamon. My 7 year old daughter suggested adding white chocolate chips also! She's a natural. It was an awesome touch!!

Sooo good! I had my doubts because they sounded too easy to make. Because I love lots of spice,  I added, ginger, cloves, nutmeg, cinnamon, a little bit of cardamom plus some maple flavoring. I also added raisins and Heath English Toffee Bits.  A very, very light sprinkle of salt on top before baking. So yummy and so easy! I forgot to grease the pans, but they slid off beautifully!

I made the cookies exactly according to the recipe, but mine were done after 12 minutes and I added cream cheese icing after they cooled a bit.  I agree with the others who say these cookies have an odd, spongey, cake-like consistency.   It definitely helps both the appearance and the taste to drizzle them with cream cheese icing.  The flavor of the cookies is good (I used Duncan-Hines spice cake mix).  But I think it is worth it to go to a little more trouble with more ingredients to make a better, more "cookie-like" cookie.  I probably wouldn't make these again, but I'm sure my family will enjoy eating this batch, especially with the addition of the icing.  UPDATE:  the cookies got worse as they cooled down and became more spongey.  Not impressed AT ALL.  Would not recommend.

I had a 15.25 ounce box of spice cake mix and it made a nice, moist cookie.  I added 1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips and 3/4 cups chopped pecans.  18 minutes was perfect cooking one sheet at a time.  Also, these don't spread out when they cook so I easily fit 16 on my cookie sheets.

These are a good cookie. If you are going to use Muffin mix instead of a cake mix I suggest added at least 1/2 cup of sugar. I also added cinnamon and ginger. :)

These have been great both times I made them! I made them for a holiday party and received many compliments. I followed the recipe exactly, except I took some others suggestions and added cream cheese frosting. The cookie is very dense, but delicious. I made them a second time, but added 1 cup of oatmeal and some cinnamon, again adding cream cheese frosting. They were even better with oatmeal, as they were less dense.

Any recipe that has only two ingredients and tastes this good gets 5 stars in my book!  I added 3/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice and flattened the cookies with the bottom of a glass dipped in sugar before baking 12 minutes.  Perfect!

Excellent recipe! One thing I wish I'd known is that the cookies pretty much keep the same shape as when you drop them. So, you can fit a lot on a sheet, but if you drop them in a big globby mess, they'll look like a big globby mess. (Oh well, guess I'll just have to eat them myself). Excellent cookie, and this is said from someone who pretty much only likes chocolate chip cookies. I will definitely make these again.

These taste yummy, but the texture is different from traditional cookies. I added a teaspoon of both pumpkin spice and cinnamon. I made some plain and then added mini marshmallows to the remaining batter. For those with a sweet tooth, the marshmallows make them a little for sweeter.

The only addition I made was LOTS of mini chocolate chips. Delicious. I also frosted some with canned cream cheese frosting - just a thin coat, but both versions were excellent.

DELICIOUS! AMAZING and super easy and tasty...would never think it! Great for a family with egg allergies...this is a delicious cookie....it may seem very bread like and sticky while making it but it comes out delicious! I put chocolate chips in mine and it turned out absolutely amazing. Didn't put icing and it was delicious just with the chocolate chips!

These are a huge hit at our house.  We use fresh pumpkin that I have baked/blended, and we also add 1 c. of semisweet chocolate chips.  AMAZINGLY good, and I feel virtuous making them, as they seem pretty healthy.

Great recipe, but the cooking time isn't nearly enough!  I did the first pan for 9 minutes, and ended up with gooey globs of dough.  I thought maybe they just needed to cool, but no, now they are cold gooey globs of dough.  This second batch I'm leaving in for at least 15 minutes.    Oh, and I also added 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice and 1 cup chocolate chips.

I didn't have spice cake mix on hand, so like another reviewer I used a white cake mix and added pumpkin pie spice. Tastes just like pumpkin pie, but small and finger food sized. Really yummy, but they were definately more like cake or muffins than cookies. Still a great recipe :) Thanks!

I used a yellow cake mix & a 15oz can of pumpkin pie filling instead of the regular canned pumpkin.  Added about a teaspoon of Penzey's baking spice & baked for  12 minutes as they did not look done at 9.  I then smeared a tiny bit of Smucker's pumpkin spice topping on while they were cooling to add a bit more love.  They are (were) delicious!

So easy and so delicious!  I added some white chocolate chips to the batter.  They are cakey, but awesome!  Plus, without the chocolate chips, they aren't too bad for you!  I will definitely make them again.

These were really good and really easy. Apparently there's a pumpkin shortage in the area so I used sweet potato puree (baby food) and they turned out great. After reading several reviews saying they were ugly and raw in the middle I molded mine to look like cookies, with my finger b/c they were sticky. They look and taste like muffin tops and with cream cheese icing on top…oh gurrrrl

A real flavorful cookie!  I like more of a crunch to my cookie, which is why I gave it a four.  But definately a delish soft, cake like cookie.

AWESOME! Soooo easy it should be a crime!  I put the 1-egg & 1-tsp of pumpkin pie spice.  I also put 2-tsp of vanille (I like vanilla!), iced them with cream cheese icing & sprinkled more spice on top for decoration.

A-MAZ-ING...  They are more muffin-y than like a cookie, which is great in my opinion.  I was looking for something soft and I found it in these.  With frosting they are a cookie, without they are a muffin...

This is a very good cookie. My relatives raved about how good they were. I also frosted them with a cream cheese frosting (recipe from this site), using 1/4c. butter, 1/4 lb. cream cheese, 2c. confectioners sugar and a tsp. of vanilla. Beat the butter and cr. cheese first then add the rest and beat til creamy. So easy and so good!!!!

Easy to make and taste like the supermarkets pumpkin cookies. I added 1 tsp of pumpkin spice and a cup of chocolate chips to the batter before cooking. I also had to cook mine for 14 minutes to set, the first batch was gooey at 10 and had to go right back in the oven.

I am a grade one teacher with a class of 22 picky eaters.  For our Hallowe'en party this year I told the parents I would take care of the treats.  At midnight the day before the party I was cursing my decision - and then I found this recipe.  We made it as a class.  It took about 10 mins with each child taking turns to stir.  We made the entire school drool as the amazing aroma filled the halls.  We iced with cream cheese icing.  The recipe made 2 small cookies for each child.  They were closer to little muffins than cookies.  Every single child ate theirs!  This is the true test of a great recipe!  Kid approved!!  I just had to write and say thank you for the easiest cookies I've ever made.  It's a keeper!  Thanks!

Flavor was good, and they were good the first night (with cream cheese frosting), but after that they were so wet they were almost totally inedible.

VERY GOOD!!!  I made some with chocolate chips, white chocolate chips, and some plain.  All were great.  I think I liked the white chocolate chips best.  I also added cream cheese frosting to the top.  Will be making again, soon.

Really good and easy, great cookie for the kids..I added 1 c. mini choc chips and 1/2 tsp cinnamon and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice and made them with yellow cake mix, they are very orange and will be great for our Halloween party!

I use a baggie, cut the corner off, pipe them on a cookie sheet and make them look "poo-like". They hold their shape in the oven and the kiddos can't stop eating them and laughing. We call them "pumpkin poops". Great for the halloween spirit. For a little more mature crowd, we pull out a tub of cool whip to dip the tops in.

Just finished making these for a last minute party...fantastic. They do have a "muffin top" texture, so don't think they're going to be like a traditional cookie. I frosted w/cream cheese icing and sprinkled chopped pecans. I also added cinnamon chips to the mix. If you want to skip the frosting (why?), definitely sprinkle with cinnamon sugar before baking for an interesting texture on top.

Easy recipe. I did 2 boxes cake mix and 1 29 oz. can of pumpkin and 1 1/2 bags semi-sweet chocolate chips. They took 11-12 minutes to cook. They don't spread so you can pack them tighter than normal on the pan. Yummy and super fast!!

Yummy!  I love pumpkin pie, and this is like a little pumpkin pie to go!  I didn't have spice cake mix, so I used a reduced sugar yellow cake mix.  I added a little bit of brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, and 1 egg to help hold it all together.  Made a simple powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla glaze for on the top, really completed it!  Super moist, fluffy, and very good.  I know I'll be using this recipe a lot around harvest/fall.

Absolutely wonderful.  I added 1/2 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and have made them with and without chocolate chips.  I think they're better without.

These cookies are so very easy!  I made a few alterations to the recipe...I also added a 1/2 stick of butter, mini chocolate chips and frosted them with cream cheese frosting then sprinkled them with cinnamon to make them look fancy.

This is truly an awesome recipe. I'm always looking for lower fat desserts and I'm so tired of seeing "1/2 cup oil", "1 stick butter", etc. I added chocolate chips and pumpkin pie spice, and put it all in a sheet cake pan. It turned out delicious.. very similar to the pumpkin chocolate cake recipe on this site (every bit as moist)and loads lower in fat and a thousand times quicker and easier to bake! I really love cooking, but with two children under 2, some nights it's just better for the family to throw something together like this :)

This recipe was really good!  You've gotta put your back into mixing it all together though, so don't give up!  I followed the directions but had to cook mine for 12-15 mins, I guess I made jumbo sized ones.  Topped mine with store bought cream cheese icing, MmMm.  Woke up the next morning to the dogs front paws on the counter, devouring my left overs!! I'm guessing she gives it 5 stars as well.

I made these last night for a Halloween party and they were so good!  I ate three right out of the oven.  They are more like a cake than a cookie.  I didn't add any additional spices and I think I will next time.  They are a little bland.  However, I did add canned cream cheese frosting and this made them great.  I just spooned them onto a cookie sheet covered with parchment paper.  You do have to REALLY mix the pumpkin and the cake mix.  At first, I didn't think that I would be able to get the cake mix moist enought with one can of pumpkin.  Adding an egg would probably help.  Just keep working with the mixture. These made the house smell great, too!

This recipe is so tasty and easy!  After reading some of the other reviews, I did add 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, 1 cup of chopped walnuts, and 1 cup of chocolate chips.  They're so soft and yummy!!!  This is a must-keep recipe for Fall/Halloween parties.

When I mixed the pumpkin and cake mix together, it was really dry and all the mix wouldn't mix in. So, I added 1 egg, about 1/8-1/4 C orange juice and a teaspoon of vanilla. That consistency was a lot better! I also added some extra cinnamon and a lot of fresh grated ginger. Baked for 10-11 minutes. So easy and really good!

These cookies were good when they were still warm, but the next day the texture became rubbery and the taste was plain.  I ended up throwing them out.  I would not make them again.

I don't think I've ever eaten anything this good that was this simple!!  Excellent recipe.  I took another reviewer's rec and flattened the cookies with a glass dipped in sugar using the two ingredients above and they are delicious.  Even my four year old  and two year old love them!

Really simple to make. I used a yellow cake mix and added 2T of spices. (1T Pumpkin Pie Spice and 1T Cinnamon) 
It took a bit longer to cook (12-14 min) due to their larger size. (Small ice cream scoop)Thanks!

I used this cookie recipe for a cookie exchange that I hosted this past Christmas season. It tasted fantastic and was easy to bake! I am giving it four stars because it didn't hold up that well.  If you are just looking for a cookie fr the family, then this is perfect. I wouldn't recommend it for a cookie exchange.

This is so simple and really so good! I wanted a fall cookie recipe I could make with my 4-year-old but one that was also low in fat (I've recently lost 15 pounds and didn't want to make a high fat treat) and this really fit the bill. The reviewer who said these taste like muffin tops got it just right-they really do! The only thing I did different was shake a little confectioners sugar on top before serving. I will for sure make these again!

This is excellent!  I don't get why people had problems with this.  A little hard to screw up w/ only 2 ingredients. I used a small ice cream scoop.  It made them small and bite size.  I did add dried cranberries (cuz I love them).  I cooked them at 350 till a tooth pick came out clean.  Perfect.  I did also do an orange flavored glaze that I dipped each cookie in.  It is very good but it doesn't have to have it because they taste great w/o.  Thank you so much, I will be making more of these!

Amazingly simple and yummy! Great to have on hand for a last minute treat for the holidays. One thing I would note is that the cookies don't change shape. My first sheet was all spiky so I smoothed the rest with the back of a greased spoon just for appearance's sake. Canned whipped cream cheese frosting was the right touch of sweetness and easy to spread. Another woman at the party made the same thing but in an 8x8 pan (I think she said 30 minutes baking time), served warm with cool whip - yum!

Makes awesome cookies...don't forget to throw in 1 to 1 1/2 cups chocolate chips.  I have also made this into a cake and spreading it into a 9x13 pan and baking until done.  I then frost with cream cheese frosting.
YUMMY

A good starter recipe.  Based on other reviewers' comments, I baked for 15 minutes, they came out nice & fluffy.  Would like more flavor; next time I will add raisins, nuts, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves.  This time I topped with cream cheese icing II based on someone else's post.

These are better than the store bought versions f pumpkin cookies.  It's amazing these turn out with only two ingredients, and they are so great!  I always add chocolate chips, and I agree, cream cheese frosting on top is quite a treat!

TIP:  Baking times always vary--Use a toothpick to determine when these are done!!  When inserted in the middle and pulled out, the toothpick should be clean.  If they aren't done enough, they are really gooey and not very pretty  (still taste OK, but they are so much better done!)

Wowee, we have a winner here!  These were sooo E-Z and the results were awesome.  I used my cookie scoop to portion out the dough, but found that I had to flatten each with the tines of my fork, like we do for peanut butter cookies.  I also frosted them with Cream Cheese Frosting II from AllRecipes, my favorite!  Next time I will add chocolate chips &/or walnuts.  This is a versatile and simple recipe that will get me out of a jam when I need something to serve or take - Real Quick.  My son said it the best, "Mom, these are BETTER than delicious!"

I'm always looking for easy, shortcut recipes.  This definitely fills the bill.  However, cookies aren't great.  Kinda rubbery.  They were good when I added choc chips and frosted w/cream cheese frosting.  A good starter for a quick recipe.

These cookies have become quite popular around here! I personally don't care for the taste much, but they get rave reviews from everybody else and disappear from the counter very fast! Simple and soft. I add a generous amount of chocolate chips when I whip up a batch.

Sooo easy and delicious.  Although, not visually appealing!!  My 6 year old loved them, which is rare!  They are even yummier with some whip cream on top...but isn't really everything better with whip cream on top!?!?  :)

I really loved the idea of these cookies, but I think they were just too moist and gooey. Like other post said, more like a muffin top. It did help to flatten the tops down and improve on the texture. As a huge pumpkin lover, I thought the spice cake mix was too overpowering. Maybe a yellow cake mix would be better.  My kids loved these, I did not.

Not a very pretty cookie, with a strange texture.  Had to bake longer than recommended time.  Won't bake again.

I'm not sure where I went wrong with this recipe but the cookies did not turn out.  By the next morning they were slimey like the texture of a pumpkin pie and did not hold together well.  I was very disappointed

Very easy and delicious, but I changed it a little.  I used yellow cake mix and added cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also just approximated the pumpkin by adding scoops from a large can until the consistency seemed like regular cookie dough.  I formed balls and flattened them with my hands, but be sure to spray your hands well b/c this is STICKY!  I also baked it longer, about 15 minutes.  I then frosted them with cream cheese frosting and topped with walnuts.  Everyone loved them, even my picky eaters.

Rated for ease and how well they went over at a party.  I used a melon baller, and ended up with tall doughy cookies.  I took a large serving fork dipped in flour to squash them.  THEY LOOKED LIKE PUMPKINS!!!

I'm a huge fan of pumpkin, and so I decided to try this recipe since I had most of a 15oz can leftover from another recipe.  To make up for the few oz I was missing, I added in a banana that was getting too soft, and it added a nice flavor.  I also added some mini-chocolate chips.  The dough was very thick and sticky, and the cookies were extremely cake like.  My family liked the flavor, but I wasn't a fan of the soft, spongy consistency.

Made these cookies for Thanksgiving and they were a hit!  They are easy and delicious!  I'm making more this weekend because my friends are begging for more.  I added a sprinkle of chocolate chips, cranberries, raisins, walnuts, and pecans.  I overbaked them too...about 15 mins total...they get a nice crunchy top...reminded a lot of people of muffin tops!

I also received this recipe from friend (I always have to check back for temp and cooking time!) and was amazed at how easy and delicious they were.  They are my "go-to" dessert when I am providing dinner to a friend in need. She always added chocolate chips and they were so good. But my family's favorite are white chocolate chips because they kind of remind us of little carrot cakes.  I don't think there's a bad way to make these! Just know that that dough is very sticky and they have to be fairly small spoonfuls. :) Enjoy!

I followed a PP and added 1/2 tsp. Pumpkin Pie Spice, 1 C. Chocolate Chips and 1 C. Pecans (I didn't have walnuts but figured pecans go well with pumpkin so I didn't see a reason not to).  I really think they need to be paired with some type of frosting or some type of topping.  Because even with my add ins they were fairly bland.

What a great idea!   These look great as cookies or mini muffins.  We sprinkle a little sugar on the top before baking, just for fun.  I had people who claimed to be non-pumpkin eaters telling me that they enjoyed them.  Such a perfect recipe for fall parties!

I didn't expect to like these very much,  but had the ingredients in my pantry, so I tried them and  I LOVED them.  I added an egg to the batter, then mixed cinnamon and sugar and sprinkled it on top of the cream cheese icing.

As suggested by others, I added about an 8th of a teaspoon of cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg, as well as 1 cup of raisins for a double recipe of these.  Additionally, after they were cooled, I drizzled them with a glaze of confectioner's sugar, maple syrup and a dash of cinnamon.  The glaze was a great addition.  They are excellent -- soft and chewy and full of autumn flavors!  One reviewer described them as being like the top of a cupcake and they are just like that.  I live at 7,000 feet, so baked them on convection bake for 25 minutes.

I make these as written, but THEN, cut them in half after they've cooled and fill them with whipped cream cheese frosting (canned is surprisingly awesome). This recipe is a HUGE hit. Pumpkin whoopie pies! They look prettier and are easier to make if you use a little ice cream scoop to make them. :)

I did add an egg. I made them look prettier using a cookie press, then frosting them with the cream cheese frosting & then sprinkled some powder cinnamon on top like some had suggested. They weren’t crisp but then again I don’t think they were supposed to be. Many people liked it.

Nothing special at all.  I added 1/2 tsp pumpkin spice and they just did not have much taste.  If I would make again would add walnuts and chocolate chips and more pumpkin spice for some taste.

I thought these were good, but not great. That said, they were very simple and my son loved them. I just think they could use some tweaking. The only change I made was to add chocolate chips. Might try one reviewers suggestion of gingerbread mix instead next time.

This was super easy, and a hit. I followed the advice that I read on a previous review and put some cream cheese frosting on it. I made it for a small get together and came home with none!! Even people who sad they were not a pumpkin fan ending up eating more than one! What else can you say other than...easy and fabulous!

These were really good!  I saw the other reviews and added the 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I also added milk chocolate chips to half of the batch and my husband liked those the best!  The other half I put cream cheese icing on top which I loved!  GREAT and EASY recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy, and super delicious! 

I was craving something baked, and happened to have a spice cake mix and a can of Libby's. Mixed together using a flat rice paddle (made it MUCH easier to mix because it is so thick). Scooped out  big cookies, and was able to still fit 12 on my cookie sheet because they don't change in size while baking. TIP: RUN YOUR FINGERS UNDER WATER AND LIGHTLY PRESS/SMOOTH THE TOPS FOR A BETTER PRESENTATION AND EVEN COOKING. Sprinkled 1/2t of mini chocolate chips on top of each one, and baked for 16 mins. 

Cookies are VERY light and cake-like (super moist, too!) Tasted more like a whoopie pie cookie than your standard "cookie". Absolutely delicious, and I will definitely make again!

This is AWESOME!!--- and no one has to know just how easy it to make (unless you want a great kids' project)....  They are soft and moist and every batch I make just disappears!  Next time I may add nuts, raisins, or craisins-- the possibilities are many.  A great holiday treat!!

A friend mailed me a tin of these; they didn't arrive intact, so don't mail them out, but they're DELICIOUS nonetheless. (Eating mine with a fork straight out of the bag! Shame on me!) This is, as you'd expect, a moist, cakelike cookie. Thanks for the recipe!

I added 1 tsp. pumpkin pie spice and 1 egg to this recipe. I had to cook them for at least 15 minutes. They are done when you can poke them with your finger and they feel firm, not squishy. I let them cool and sandwiched two cookies together after filling them with cream cheese frosting. Labeled them pumpkin spice whoopie pies and sold them at a bake sale. Went like hotcakes! Wish I could add a picture to my review. Happy baking :-)

I make these occasionally and we love them.  However, this week I only had white cake mix so I added 3 tsp. pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 tsp. ginger and 2 tsp. cinammon and 1 tsp. pure vanilla to give it some punch.  Still wasn't as good as the spice cake mix but we're eating them.  Try this as given for a low fat,low calorie cookie.

I love these!  I added 1/2 tsp of  pumpkin spice, some walnuts and white choc. chuncks (not sure how much, just eye balled it). Like recommended, I baked them for 15 min.  They are, as someone else said, just like muffin tops!  That is how I refer to them instead of cookies.  My new favorite!!!!

As written, these are fair.  I didn't have spice cake, but I added a couple teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to a vanilla cake mix.  After they cooled, I topped them with some melted white chocolate and THAT made them very good!  I buy the bags of melting chocolate from Hobby Lobby.  It's candymaker brand.  Anytime a recipe calls for melted chocolate for dipping I always use that.  Melted chocolate chips can't compare!

Very good.  I too added chocolate chips because I think they are a must, and a little pumpkin spice.  But I love that there was no oil added.  I gave these 4 stars because the cooking time seems way off, I had to cook for several additional minutes.

Wonderful, easy recipe! Added 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and some mini chocolate chips before baking and then served them with homemade cream cheese frosting and got rave reviews! Extremely simple to make and love that it's only a few ingredients. (For the frosting, I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site--to die for!)

These cookies were so flavorful and easy! I added about 1/2 cup of splenda and a bit of cinnamon and pumpkin spice. I wanted to make the cookies healthy and low-cal. They did come out somewhat cakey, but I loved the texture. I added a simple powdered sugar glaze on top, too. These will go fast!!!

Amazing fall treat! I usually buy the large can of pumpkin (28 oz) double the spike cake mix, and freeze half of it. This way I have one batch for Halloween, and one for Thanksgiving!

These really work!  The only thing I added was some extra pumpkin pie spice to give it a deeper flavor.  I love that there is no oil, egg, or shortening required.  Simple, tasty, and makes the whole house smell great.

These were so easy and great! I added 1/2 teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice to add some extra fall flavor, and included chocolate chips. I was amazed at how well these turned out with such few ingredients. Mine were not gooey in the center at all. Much like baking a cake, you need to make sure they are cooked all the way through.

This cookie was EXCELLENT and incredibly easy to make!  The only change I made was to add a bit of pumpkin pie spice to the recipe.  I topped the cookies off with some Betty Crocker cream cheese frosting, and they were the hit of the party!

This was not very good without frosting.  I made a cream cheese frosting and globbed it on to make up for the somewhat bland cookie. Maybe it's just me though because both family and coworkers said they were good.  I might make these again if I'm pressed for time.

Easy and good.  I used a Reduced Sugar Yellow cake mix instead and added 1 egg for fluff factor.  I added pumpkin pie spice to mix.  I sprinkled with sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg on top.

These are very expensive to make. Do the math. For 2 dozen it cost 3.15  I will use this recipe as a foundation to master my own creation.   Thank you for the idea.   They are very good.. My home made cream cheese frosting really perked these up..  Thanks again...

My 4yo loves to help in the kitchen, but wanted to make something "all by myself." This looked like it would fit (with me doing the oven parts). First tray we followed the directions and they were bland. We then threw in some oatmeal, vanilla extract, brown sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon. WOW! We call these "little muffins" and eat them for breakfast. Just be sure to check for doneness with a toothpick to prevent getting stuck with gooey centers!

Great recipe! I had pumpkin pie filling on hand and they still came out nice and cake like. I used the bottom of a glass to round out the cookies to give them more of a cookie shape. I also used a cream cheese icing and sprinkled a bit of nutmeg on top. Will definitely keep these ingredients on hand if I ever need a quick cookie! Thanks!!

Wonderful, easy recipe!  I add raisins and bake at 350 for 15 minutes.  I also make chocolate cookies the same way; chocolate cake mix, pumpkin and I add peanut butter chips or white chocolate chips.  All the kids and grandkids love 'em either way I make them.

I have to be honest, I don't know if I can call these "cookies" since they were very spongy cake bits to me.  And just like another reviewer mentioned, the texture became very "wet" next day and, I'm really sorry to say this, but they looked awful and very unpleasant (let me just say I can't say what they looked like here but many people agreed)...   However, there are some good reasons why this recipe got 3 stars from me.  Yes, this was a super easy recipe, using pumpkin made me feel like I was making some healthy dessert and although I didn't care for them much and was ready to throw them out (and I LOVE pumpkin anything!), some people, especially people are older than 50, told me these were their favorite cookies and I baked several different cookies.  And because it took only 60 seconds or less to whip this up, I will give this recipe another chance.  If I make this again just plain then I will flatten them with a bottom of a bottle or something before baking them for a better "look."  But I think I will definitely add raisins and chopped nuts for a better texture and taste.

This is one of the best quick go-to cookie recipes! I make it with a butter recipe cake mix, I add a 1/2 cup raisins, a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice and make a homemade buttercream/cream cheese frosting for the top. Sprinkle a little nutmeg or cinnamon on top and they are a perfect little holiday cookie that everyone loves!

The taste was OK, although they could have used a lot more spice.  The texture, however, was pretty terrible.  They were OK fresh out of the oven and had a nice crusty muffin-like top, but after just a few hours they were wet and spongy.  And I even cooked them for 15 minutes.  Maybe adding texture with chocolate chips or nuts makes all the difference, but as-is they are just mushy.

We're making these right now and I can't stop eating them! The 1st batch we baked for maybe 9 minutes---not long enough! They were ok, but gooey. I think 12-13 minutes will work best for my oven. They're so simple to make, I'll make sure to keep these TWO ingredients in my pantry.  Next time---chocolate chips!!

not bad, but not great. i didn't think the batter had enough sweetness or flavor to make a good cookie so i added roughly 1/3 c. sugar, a teaspoon or two of cinnamon sugar, and a half-teaspoon of nutmeg. still came out kind of bland, a little rubbery. i made a buttercream icing to put on them to make up for it. maybe the rubberiness will go away in a day.

I made these for our church Pumpkin Festival and used gingerbread instead of yellow cake, as mentioned in another review.  These turned out great.  You don't get many cookies but they taste fantastic.  You can't make an easier cookie!!

Tasty and simple cookie! I used yellow cake mix and a can of organic pumpkin pie mix with a handful of dried cranberries. I followed another reviewers suggestion of pressing sugar on top with a glass bottom. Yummmmm. Next time I'll make sure I have cream cheese on hand to make some frosting.... BTW, they're still baking and it looks like enough dough to make almost 3 dozen 2 bite cookies.

just as expected.  Bit cake like battery, for my likes, but since it is only 1 of the 2 ingredients...I added raisins and chocolate chips.  Made a double batch using (1 spice cake, and 1 yellow cake mix and 1 28oz can of pumpkin)  Thanks!

These were okay for me-great flavor, I did add one egg and used a vanilla cake mix and added cinnamon since I didn't have a spice cake mix on hand.  I added one cup of chocolate chips.  They were very soft and on the second day they were sticky and fell apart easily.  Great flavor but as my hubby put it, they aren't like "real cookies."  Maybe I'll try again spreading the mixture into a pan as other reviewers have suggested.  I probably won't make as cookies again.

So easy and tasty!  I like to add a bit of pumpkin pie spice and vanilla extract. Also have added white chocolate chips and raisins (both are great! either together or separately) - These cookies are so moist and delicious!  Plus they make your house smell great when baking :)

These were yummy. I added about a cup of dry oats to up the fiber content and some golden raisins for sweetness/ texture and baked them for 17 minutes at 350. They were easy to make and my vegan friends can eat them too!

For a two ingredient recipe it's great. Remember to cook the cookies a little longer to get rid of the gooy middle. Think of them as cake cookies.

This recipe is wonderful!  I do NOT like pumpkin pie, and I love these cookies.  My kids do,too.  As far as the texture being cakey.. it is made with a cake mix, so that would be kind of a clue.  I frosted mine with storebought cream cheese frosting.  Yummy!

I love these cookies!! I had left over pumpkin from another recipe and since this only used two ingredients I thought I'd give it a try.  They're incredibly moist and have a great cake-like texture and are SOO easy.  They do get a little gooey as time goes by, but they still taste GREAT! I will definitely make these again. Thanks for sharing.

I gave this cookie 2 stars...It was easy...and I didn't have any gooey problems, so I know I made it right.
Make sure to use SOLID PACK PUMPKIN- that may have been confusing?? In the end I am a huge cookie lover and this just didn't do it for me---yuck---but it was easy, just not edible!

These were too easy, super moist, a huge hit with me and my boyfriend and they're gone. On a few of the cookies, I put some white chocolate pieces, and on others I put walnuts. They were like mini muffin tops!

I thought they were a bit bland, but my fiance gobbled them up!  I added chopped walnuts, but they need something sweeter, so I think I'll do the cream cheese frosting next time.  Recipe couldn't be easier - two ingredients!

These cookies were extremely easy to make and the taste is great but the texture inside the cookie tended to be gooey even though the bottoms of the cookie were very brown (I was afraid to leave them in longer than 9 minutes).  With the cookie not spreading out when baked I think the inside is not cooking thoroughly.  I'm going to try it one more time and see if my lucks any better.

I used Betty Cocker extra spiced cake and pumpkin, added 1/2 cup of walnut pieces. I’m going to frost them with cream cheese frosting.  They are delicious and fluffy  and the flavor is just perfect.
Thank you for the recipe, so easy!!

Awesome!  I took the advice of other posters and added chocolate chips,  chopped walnuts, and an egg.  Baked for 19 minutes and they came out perfect--soft and not gooey.  Thanks for a fabulous, EASY recipe!

Great recipe! Very quick and easy. These turned out VERY sweet so I couldn't see adding icing or more sugar to these. However, I did add crasins, walnuts and a 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice. Next time I think I'll add a few oats to make them more filling and healthier.

Great base cookie but needs a little umph.  I added about a tablespoon of pumpkin pie spice, some vanilla and some mini chocolate chips and butterscotch chips. The butterscotch makes the pumpkin pop! These are a delicious and easy treat to make for all of your neighbors.

I made these according to the recipe. A little bland, next time I will get pumpkin pie spice and add to it. I used a teaspoon to measure batter and baked for 15 minutes,  let the sit on the cookie sheet for the 5 minutes  after baking. They were perfect. Nice and moist and fluffy.

This was a good cookie and very easy to make. However, the directions need some improvement. The cookies DO NOT spread or rise, so they are the same size coming out as going in. I always use a cookie scoop when making cookies and changed to a larger scoop (abt. 1 1/2 Tbsp). I also flattened the cookies with a fork, like a peanut butter cookie. And when cool, I drizzled a rum cream cheese glaze over them.

I kinda changed it I cooked it for 18- 19 min, and put 2 cake mix bags, an egg and only one can of pumpkin puree. it made it less gooey and tastier! overall It looks SOOO appetizing and will Definitely make again, I can't see why you guys said it looked ugly. I put chocolate cake mix in by the way. they are disappearing quickly, leaving us hungry for more!!

I don’t understand the great reviews.  I made these and even added spices and chocolate chips and walnuts.  First of all they are really ugly cookies- I wanted them for a fall party. Secondly they are a strange texture and thirdly they are still very bland.  Worst cookies I ever made.  Sorry.

I added a salted chocolate leaf that I made through melting chocolates in a shallow candy mold to the top as a decoration instead of icing.  Cream cheese icing was great but difficult to travel with and very rich.  Amazing cookie with or without icing!!!

I made them 3 days ago and they're still sitting around.  So that tells you they weren't a big hit in my house.  I love the ease and the idea but the result was disappointing.  The spice cake alone doesn't have enough flavor.   I used parchment paper and they came off easy enough.  I baked for 20 minutes but still didn't like the texture.  The recipe as is needs more - add more spices, chocolate chips, raisins, nuts or a frosting to make it worthwhile.  Next time, I'll just make pumpkin bread.

4 stars as it is written, but I also used eggs, some oil, and sprayed the pans with Pam I recommend adding extra pumpkin pie spices, and a light icing for a 5 Star!

I thought these were too good to be true and sure enough they were.  I made some plain and some with chocolate chips and the chocolate chips are better but still bad.  They have a semi fluffy cake texture with a crust on top and the taste is sharp- not like a cookie at all.  Chocolate chips helped take away from the taste but I won’t make them again.

I know how good these are, because I have made them many times with two additions.  I stir a bag of cinnamon chips - you will find them in the baking aisle with the chocolate chips.  After you bake them and they cool, you can eat them as they are, or make them even more delicious by frosting them with a thick creamy Cream Cheese frosting - then sprinkle the tops lightly with cinnamon.  I make them and take them to work, and they don't last long!  People can't believe how fast and easy they are!  I don't care for canned frosting, so I make my own.  The frosting is an 8  oz brick of cream cheese, softened,  a stick of softened butter, powdered sugar, and enough milk to make it spreading consistency and a teaspoon of vanilla.  Just mix the cream cheese and butter until it's creamy, and then add the other ingredients and mix until thick and creamy, but will spread over the cookies easily.   Sprinkle lightly with cinnamon, then leave sitting out until frosting dries, then you can put in a plastic container with waxed paper in between the layers to transport them to the lucky people who will get them!  You can also make them into muffins, just leave off the frosting.  They are delicious that way too, but I love to make cookies, so that's what I do with it most often!

Make with two cans of pumpkin! The first time I tasted these my SIL brought them to a party. She said she used two cans of pumpkin to one box of cake mix. When I went to make them myself every recipe I found said only one can so I tried that first but they weren't as good. Adding two cans makes them moist and more cookie like rather than cake like. I add a little pumpkin spice as well and of course chocolate chips.

our family has allergies/we use the duncan hines yellow cake mix because it has no dairy and we add  carob chips. they love these. i debated about adding a little pumpkin pie spice/will definitely do that next time. for allergy free icing, we do just powdered sugar made into a glaze with a little bit of water

These were good but not amazing... very easy, but I felt it was lacking something...They are very puffy cookies.. almost a cake:cookie... (expected considering the ingredients..)
I added 1tsp of pumpkin spice and 3/4 bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and baked on parchment paper...
They'd satisfy a pumpkin spice craving but I doubt I will make this recipe again...

Super easy and yummy!! I DON'T bake and it's pretty impossible to mess these up. I use Ghiradelli' dark chocolate chips, but you could use almost anything as the third ingredient - dried cranberries, walnuts, butterscotch chips, etc..... My families love these and they are super filling and not too bad for you at all!

Very easy and overall tasty. Just didn't like the consistency--I found them to be too wet and sticky for cookies. I wonder if it would have made a difference if my cookies had been smaller.Anyhow, I made them as muffins and I was a lot more pleased with the results.

Very disappointing. My mix was too gooey and hard to put on the cookie sheet. They have been baking for way over the max 20min with no signs of being done at all. Was I supposed to mix the cake mix according to package AND THEN add the canned pumpkin?? So confused. Will not make again

I tried this recipe after having read through all the “2 Ingredient Pumpkin Cookies/Cake” recipes and reviews.  I changed it up slightly after reading some comments.  I used German Chocolate Cake mix, 1 can of pumpkin, 1 egg, 1 cup dark chocolate morsels, ½ cup coconut flakes and 1 tsp cinnamon.  (I added the egg because, even with my mixer, I had trouble getting it mixed up). Just a note: I added the egg to the pumpkin and mixed, then added the spice, chocolate and coconut and mixed some more, then sifted the cake mix in and mixed MORE.   Finally, I used an ice cream scoop to plop the “batter” onto a cookie sheet lined with non-stick foil and baked at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. (I started checked earlier, but they didn’t pass the toothpick test until 20.)  Perhaps because of the added egg, they DID spread out and flatten a bit, looking like lovely muffin tops.  I had some of the batter left over, so I used a tablespoon to plop down smaller cookies and baked those at 350 degrees for 15 minutes; perfect little cake-cookies!  (I made this recipe first as a cake, using carrot cake mix, 3 eggs, pumpkin and ½ cup applesauce – 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  It was also delicious!)

First of all, these aren't cookies....they are dollops of cake.  Secondly, they had almost no flavor at all, somehow they even had less flavor than the individual ingredients.  I even tried adding coconut and walnuts to add something to it, but they were still lacking a lot.  Don't think they are even worth trying to make again to improve upon them...

These couldn't be much easier. I made mine small (1 flat tbsp) and took someone else's advice of flattening them with a  glass (I sprayed mine with Pam) and baked them for 10 minutes and they turned out flawlessly. My plan is to put some cream cheese frosting in between and squish two together like little pumpkin "whoopie pies". 

Fantastic and extremely simple recipe and they're going to be great for the Thanksgiving lunch at work tomorrow. 

Thanks!!!

My grandson got this recipe from school; he made it and liked it ( adding the pumpkin spice mix, as well). He liked it. I did not, just because I don't particularly like the ingredients. However, I'm wondering...wouldn't this recipe be much tastier if you used pumpkin PIE MIX instead of just the plain pumpkin?

I made this recipe, but I did not make it the way CARRUTH did, so I am rating it according to my alterations. 
This is what I did, mix together:  15oz. Solid packed pumpkin - 18.25oz. White cake mix - 1 1/2t. Cinnamon - 1/2t. Nutmeg - 1/2t. Cloves -  1/2t. Ginger - 1/8c. Chopped raisins - 1/8c. Minced black walnuts ~ I dropped by cookie spoon spoonfuls on a parchment lined cookie sheet & baked in a preheated 350 oven for 15min (according to my oven temperature) they came out pillowy soft, not slimy. Perhaps the raisins & nuts helped?!?! They were good, would make again, very quick & easy. Enjoy!!!

Really easy, and great with raisins. I got from a friend before I found it here, and in that recipe the large can of pumpkin is used. Bake time is 20-23 minutes and in my oven at least, they came out taller and fluffier on the middle rack using parchment paper. Personally I like the weird spongy feel.

I thought these were not very good or appetizing in appearance. My boyfriend loves them but I don't think they are sweet enough. The texture  seems like it would be better suited for muffins. I won't be making them again.

It was exacly like they said it would be.  These are very easy to make (a little difficult to stir, but easy to make).  I added the cream cheese icing and a candy corn on top and they are perfect.  Thank you for a great holiday treat.

I live at high altitude so i am always cautious about baking.  The mix was dry so i added 1/4c water, 1 T pumpkin pie spice,a handful of craisins. I spooned them out onto parchment paper and then press them down with a fork ala peanut butter cookies.  baked 15 minutes.  They are soft cookies, tasty and flavorful and they don't bear any resemblance to any kind of excrement as one person inferred.  If you don't like soft cookies you won't like these.

Very cake like, but pretty good. I did add 2 1/2 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and think it could use even more. Perhaps I'd try using the gingerbread version next time with the pumpkin like some have suggested. Super easy!
