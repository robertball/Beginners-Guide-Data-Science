THE FIRST TIME I MADE THIS, IT WAS TOO SWEET AND SOGGY. I MADE IT A SECOND TIME AND ADDED GARLIC POWDER AND GROUND CUMMIN TO THE HONEY MIXTURE AND CRUSHED ABOUT HALF THE CORNFLAKES. iT WAS MUCH BETTER THE SECOND TIME AROUND.

I would give it 3 stars, but hubby gave it one, so I averaged it a 2. The chicken was moist and tender, but it was too sweet. The flavors did not seem to blend well and the honey was overwhelming. Even my 6 year old with the sweet tooth thought it was "yucky." And the crust was a tad soggy. I'm not sure that reducing the honey would really improve it either. I will not be fixing it again.

This recipe was really good. My 4 year old ate this and didn't complain once! However, next time I think I will crush the cornflakes instead of leaving them whole. Also, not recommened for left overs, cornflakes get soggy!

This chicken was very good and so easy.  I did crush the cornflakes before coating the chicken.  I flipped the chicken halfway through baking and it did not get soggy at all.  It was excellent with some melted swiss and sauteed mushrooms on top!

This was just okay.  I don't think I would make it again.  It really was too sweet. I think I like the original Kelloggs version with no honey, just milk. I did add extra flavor by adding garlic and onion powder.  It was very crispy. I did crush the corn flakes before dipping the chicken in them.

I liked the taste of the honey sauce, but the corn flakes didn't stick to the chicken at all.  I think crushing the corn flakes up really well might make them stick and make the bottom of the chicken less soggy.

Wonderful!  Loved the honey mixture and I'm not even a honey fan (it's just a hint of flavor)  Only change - I used crushed (as per other reviews) Special K flakes instead of corn flakes.  Will definitely make again!

This recipe was delicious and simple. I wasnt sure about it at first but after I tasted it, I knew it would be something I will make for my family all the time! My boyfriend and my daughter loved it.

This just didn't work for me.  I thought I would love it because we like to dip chicken in honey...but it wasn't a winner for us.

Extremely simplistic recipe... Few ingredients doesn't have to mean mediocre-tasting.  Cornflakes (I used Total flakes) didn't so much get soggy as chewy.  I didn't have a problem with the sweetness, as many other people seem to have, but overall the dish is only okay.  Edible, and some bites were even enjoyable.  Requires very little effort, but it shows in the product.

This was a great recipe for my 3 picky boys. The ingredients are those I generally have on hand. I followed some of the advice of other reviews; crushing the corn flakes, adding orange juice concentrate to the honey, halving the honey, adding salt, pepper, paprika and garlic powder to the honey. It wasn't soggy. It was moist. The boys liked it. Slightly bland and boring for me, but that's what I was looking for. I like the idea someone else had of melting swiss cheese on top.

This recipe had no flavor. It wasn't sweet like I thought it would be. If I make it again, I will have to add spices to the milk and honey dip.

I have made this twice and both times it got wiped out quick. The only difference's that I make is that I cut the chicken in half lengthwise and I used about half the honey the recipe called for.

I used frosted flakes since I didn't have honey, but had frosted flakes. The coating did work well, stayed coated,was crunchy and chicken was moist. I also crushed with by hand to make the flakes smaller. The sweetness didn't pare well with the chicken. It tasted like sweet chicken. It might be better with marinating the chicken first.

I crushed the corn flakes slightly to coat the chicken more evenly. We were out of milk, but had about 1 tbsp of half and half. To supplement, I used orange-flavored aloe vera drink (OKF Brand) - this added a very subtle citrus taste and kept the honey from becoming too runny. To the honey-cream-juice, I added sea salt, onion, garlic, thyme, cayenne pepper, paprika and black pepper. End result was extremely tender and juicy chicken. Went perfectly with steamed brussel sprouts tossed in sea salt, black pepper, and sesame oil.

This is awesome! My children loved this recipe. Instead of Corn Flakes, which I did not have,  used Itailan Bread Crumbs. This gave it a really great flavor. Make sure to stir the honey and milk mixure really well.

Okay, I tweaked it a bit, but it was still awesome! I added some garlic powder to the honey/milk mixture, but I love garlic, as does my husband. I add garlic to almost everything! I will definitely make this again. I flipped it with about 10 minutes to go, and it wasn't soggy at all. Thanks for a great recipe!

This recipe was great but I made some changes....when using flour to coat ANYTHING always season it!! So lightly season chicken then coat in seasoned flour then in honey sauce ( i used mustard instead of milk) and then in your VERY CRUSHED cornflakes. I also had to bake mine and extra 7 minutes! Hope this helps...

This was a good "starter" recipe. I have made this and the Kelloggs recipe and i prefer this. I would have rated it 5 stars but i did a lot of extras. I used 1/4 cup milk and 1/3 cup of honey, salt n peppered the flour as well as the chicken itself. I also used chicken tenderloins instead of breasts and crushed the cornflakes. After 20 minutes of cooking i turned the chicken over and drizzled it with honey. After 5 minutes i turned the oven off and let it sit in the oven for another 5 or so minutes while i finished the side dishes. When i took it out of the oven i flipped the chicken back over and lightly drizzled the other side with honey. My family likes it really sweet and they loved this dish! At the end, the chicken was crunchy and nothing was soggy at all :D

Let's start with the obvious: if you want PF Chang's honey chicken, it has to be fried.  This is a healthy alternative that has a similar flavor.  I crushed the corn flakes and used more honey than the recipe called for.  The key to keeping it crunchy is to cut the chicken into 1 1/2" cubes (like chicken nuggets) and then coating it in flour, honey and corn flakes.  I put it on a bed of white rice, and it was delicious!

all my family loved it! We used total flakes instead of corn flakes, and it was SO good! We also added a little more milk and a little less honey. We did put a little garlic powder in the honey mixture too.

The meal was excellent, a favorite meal for everyone.  I have kids ranging from 3 to 21 and everyone loved it. But not good for left overs! You can't  reheat it in the microwave and expect it to taste the same.

This was pretty good, just not my cup of tea. My Husband and 2 yaer old daughter liked it though. Not very good reheated, eat it fresh.

I just made this, it isn'e even done yet, but so far I am disappointed, the honey mixture just rolled off the flour. I made a huge mess just trying to get the honey mixture onto the chicken. I am going to flip halfway through baking to hopefully prevent soggy cornflakes. Oh, and I crushed my cornflakes too.

This is not a well constructed recipe. The cornflakes crushed or not do not sick to the chicken and the recipe lacks depth. I even added garlic powder as suggested by other reviewers and it was still bland. I flipped the chicken as recommended by other users as well and it was still soggy.

Great recipe, I will make it again. Recommended adjustments: (1)Lightly salt the chicken before flouring it (2)Crush the corn flakes (3)Flip halfway through the cooking.

So-so.  I couldn't get the cornflakes to stick to the chicken very well either.  I probably won't make again.
