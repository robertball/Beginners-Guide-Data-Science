We liked this! I did make a major change, by using romaine in place of the kale b/c we do not care for it. Really enjoyed all of the flavors in this salad. I mixed all the dressing ingredients in a separate bowl and added a bit of garlic...tasty! I think this would also be great using spinach or with some onion added. I would make this again for sure! Thanks for sharing. :)
