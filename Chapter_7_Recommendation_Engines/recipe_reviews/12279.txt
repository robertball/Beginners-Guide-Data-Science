This easy-to-make cobbler has a great flavor that really compliments fresh fruit.  My husband said its "5 out of 5 stars" ... the way he remembers his mom used to make cobbler.  I was looking for a cobbler or crumble recipe for fresh strawberries and blueberries, but I didn't want to cook the fruit or add more sugar to the berries - just put it in the oven.  This was perfect.  I used a 9x13 glass dish and doubled the batter to cover all the berries. The topping has a springy cake-like texture and nice flavor. I always toss fruit with Minute (plain) tapioca to thicken the juices so they are not runny and found that one heaping Tbs was just right.  The strawberries and blueberries (about 3 to 1 in quantity - maybe 5 cups total) had a jam-like flavor.  Great!  Thanks Victor.

Yum!  I've made this a few times and love it!  Besides for being easy and good, even without any modifications, it's a lo-cal dessert.  This time, I used 1/2 splenda and 1/2 sugar and didn't taste a difference.  
I used mostly peaches with a few frozen blueberries thrown in.  It will definitely become a regular.

Has become a favorite dessert around the house. I serve it warm, right out of the oven, with ice cream usually cookies and cream and it is delicious! Very easy to make, and everyone loves it. I use less sugar than what the recipe asks for 'cause I add some brown sugar and cinnamon to the apples to  give them more flavor. I have, so far, only made the cobbler with fresh apples.

I was initially attracted to the simplicity of this recipe along with the high marks it received.  This cobbler--actually more berry cake recipe--is delightfully simple, but  the crust is unfortunately bland if made exactly as stated.    Personally, I find adding a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg perk up the flavor of the cobbler crust, and I've made it more than once with those additions and happily eaten up every last morsel.  But, in it's original form, I feel the recipe is a bit lacking and try to rate my reviews based on the recipe as stated versus the recipe as I've tweaked it.

Quite good. The cruste was nice and golden, and not too sweet. It complimented the fruit nicely. Thought there was just a tad bit too much though, the crust fruit ratio was off. I added some cinamon to my fruit, and it was awesome. Suggest doing that to add a little more flavour.

i'm 18, and am a budding baker! i must say that this recipe is not only easy to make but also incredibly delicious when eaten warm! i find that sprinkling sugar and a bit of cinnamon onto the fruit before adding the dough doesn't hurt. oh, and instead of peaches i used apples and mangoes, which was quite refreshing given their contrasting flavors:)

I really like this recipe.  It is easy to prepare.  I have used combinations of fresh peaches, strawberries, raspberries, and cherries.  Skim milk and Egg Beaters work fine.  I have always had to cook it longer than 30 minutes though.  For me, it has been closer to an hour.  I like to take it out when it is golden brown and then let it sit for 5-10 minutes so the fruit juices solidify just a bit.  No matter what though, this has always been a big hit when I make it.

Very good. Only had Peaches, Pears, Apple and Frozen blueberries on hand. Used higher percentage of peaches. Added a little cinnamon and sugar to fruit and a little cinnamon to topping and turned out awesome. Tastes great warm.

Great base recipe and I love the emphasis on fresh fruit! I used pears, strawberries, and just 2 apples for mine and the only other modifications I made were adding a dash of nutmeg, about 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and a squeeze of lemon juice to fruit.  I also had a longer cooking time of about 45 minutes.  Will keep using this recipe, lovely batter :)

I used fresh peaches and left the skins on, just sliced them thinly.  The skins gave the fruit a beautiful dark pink color that bubbled up from under the topping.  Also threw in a pear.  I tossed the fruit in 1 tbsp. lemon juice and about 1 tbsp. corn starch.  For the topping I used only 1/2 c. sugar.  I blobbed the topping on top of the fruit (like cobblestones), spread it a little to cover most of the fruit surface, and sprinkled cinnamon on top before putting in the oven.  A little sugar with the cinnamon would have been nice, but it turned out delicious anyway, and was devoured at a potluck.  Giving this a 4 because I made changes, but it's a great base recipe.

Very tasty.  I made this with Pears, Apples and Blueberries (becuase that's what I had!) and used Splenda (I reduced it to 1/2 C and it was still plenty sweet).  I had to double the dough as it wasn't nearly enough for 2 pears, 1 large apple and about a cup of blueberries.  Next time I think I will add Oats to see if its more  like a "crumble".

I use this batter topping for all sorts of fruit cobblers. It even tastes good if you use canola oil instead of butter. 

I usually use fresh cranberries and apples in a pie plate, and then top it with the batter. It tastes so good when it is served warm and topped with a bit of vanilla ice cream. 

Another variation I've done (which amazingly has turned out well) is apples, strawberries, and topped of with ripe banana slices. I know it sounds weird, but people really liked it.  

This topping is very nice, feel free to experiment with your own fruit combinations.

This seemed too easy to be any good but was I surprised!  I used a quart of mixed tree fruit (peaches, nectarines, apricots and plums) with 1/4 cup sugar mixed in and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp because I love a stronger flavor.  It turned out golden brown on top and a perfect balance of fruit and cake.  By day 2 the juices had been absorbed by the cake and it lost it's texture but it still tasted fine.  I used black plums and yellow and white peaches and nectarines, so the finished product was also beautiful with a lovely mixture of yellow, pink and red.

It is an easy recipe, and I enjoyed making it. I added cinnamon and sugar directly to the fruit. My whole crumble (made up of a collection of fruit: apples, peaches, yellow plums, blueberries, raspberries) was tart. Not sure how to remedy that exactly. Kids, therefore, didn't really eat it, but the adults loved it.

This was delicious!!...and so quick and easy to make!!  The first one I did the fruit measure of 2/3 fresh plums and 1/3 fresh apples.  The texture came out perfect and golden in color.  This is now one of my favorites for quick-easy-and delicious.  I will definitely be making this more and with some of my other favorite fruit combos!  Try it...you'll love it!! :)>

Easiest to melt butter in glass baking dish in preheating oven, swirl (to grease) then pour into batter.  Used fresh blueberries and strawberries, only 1/2 the sugar and it was just right for me.  Baked for 60 min.  Worked ok in 1.5 qt baking dish by cutting back a little the fruit.

Spectacular recipe! This was so quick to put together. I made it with peaches, apples, blueberries and a few raspberries. When I was sifting the flour mixture together I added in some nutmeg and cinnamon, it was so delicious! My man had never had cobbler before and absolutely loved it!

This is a really delicious, simple cobbler recipe, which uses much less butter/oil than other cobblers. I was serving the hot dessert in 45 minutes. I used only fresh plums, about half the fruit quantity given in the recipe. I sprinkled the plums with a little cinnamon and sugar. Next time I will use only 1/2 cup sugar in the batter, cause it turned out a tad too sweet for my taste. I suggest everyone try making it with whole wheat flour. It makes the dessert even tastier! Thanks for the recipe! This one's a keeper!

I used the fruit i had on hand that was about to turn, so it ended up being a mix of peaches, plums, cherries, and blueberries. I added a bit of cinnamon and sugar to the fruit mixture, and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the top as well. Absolutely delicious served with vanilla ice cream. A great way to use up leftover fruit.

This was great!  I had some pears that I needed to do something with before they got too ripe.  This was delicious! I can't wait to try it with different fruits.

Pretty good, different from other cobblers.  I used 6 fresh peaches, peeled and sliced and about 3/4 can of cherry pie filling I had leftover.  I buttered an 8" x 12" glass baking dish, piled in the peaches and dropped spoonfuls of cherry pie filling on top.  I sprinkled about 1/8 cup brown sugar on top of the fruit, and then sprinkled with cinnamon.  (Next time, I think I'll add some cinnamon to the flour mixture too for added flavor.)  The crust on top was about 1/2" to 3/4" thick when baked and had a crispy top layer to it.  The fresh peaches and cherry filling gave it a tart/sweet taste which I liked.  I had to bake longer, probably 20-25 minutes longer and cover with foil because it was getting too brown - the crust "looked" done, but wasn't in the middle.  Had some with vanilla ice cream.

I've tried several cobbler recipes from different cookbooks & I like this one the best.  I actually used a variety of fruit - peaches, blueberries & nectarines - and just made sure the quanity was the same as the recipe called for.  The results were great.. add a little ice cream and my hubby was VERY happy!

I used fresh peaches, blackberries, blueberries, and apple in this, and put 1/4 cup sugar on the fruit.  It came out wonderful!

Made this tonight and my husband said, "amazing."  :)  I sprinkled some cinnamon, nutmeg, and some sugar on top of the cobbler and it smelled amazing.  Made it with one large peach, one pear, and one apple.  Delish!  I also made homemade whipped cream with it, which went perfectly.  Definitely a keeper and a way to use up extra fruit!

My husband claims this is the best cobbler he has ever had!  ...I slightly modified the recipe by using 1 cup of sugar and 1 tsp of vanilla.  I also used tart organic cherries, which needed a little something-something extra, plus blueberries, apples, and nectarines.  It was a great combo!

This was my first time making peach cobbler, sorry to say it was quite disappointing. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and some allspice in the fruit mixture which was tasty. The topping just tasted like bland bread. Still looking for a good peach cobbler recipe.

Very tasty! The batter did not turn out exactly as I'd hoped, but it's very tasty nonetheless. I did use frozen fruit in this, but it was fruit I had already tested the sweetness of prior to freezing so I knew that I didn't need to add sugar to the fruit filling. (Photo coming soon.)

Outstanding! I've made this twice. Both times with rave reviews. I just used fresh pears and blueberries the first time and added fresh peaches the second time. They were both great. No need to double the batter. Even though it doesn't completely cover the fruit, it is not needed. This is really a light, fresh dessert. Thanks for the post!

loved this recipie! i just threw in fruits i had on hand (pears, apples, plums, peaches, raspberries, strawberries, and blueberries. i tossed the fruit with brown sugar instead of white and a bit of cinnamon...note: i didnt measure the fruit out, i just did enough to fill a 10" springform pan about three-quarters of the way full. i made the topping as directed. i had to bake longer than the time suggested due to the extra fruit. Great recipie to make everyone eat their fruits! Thanks for the recipie!

Really good. I tossed the fruit in real maple syrup and added hazelnut extract to the topping. I used cherries and apples. I'm excited to try different variations.

This recipe is great in its simplicity; the batter is sweet, spongey & cake-like - you should only just cover the fruit with a thin layer of batter or else it'll take a very long time to bake. This is what happened with me - I used a 9" round pan and ended up baking for an hour instead of 30 min because the batter was still runny/raw. It probably would've been fine if I'd used a 13"x9" dish instead, so everything was spread out. I used frozen peaches, plums, and strawberries - it turned out very sweet. Maybe a more contrasting array of fruits would be better for next time, to cut the sweetness. It's a nice recipe for something to do with an abundance of overripe fruit.

Awesome classic recipe! Used only fresh ripe peaches and cooked for 40 minutes in an 8x8 glass casserole dish. Wonderful flavor and texture! Versitle recipe. It was refreshing to have a recipe without all of the unnessecary sugar! Thanks so much!

I love this recipe.  Not too sweet, not to tart.  I used frozen fruit, blueberries, peaches and strawberries, let them thaw and it was great!  Took me all of 10 mins to put together.

There is no thickening included for the fruit juices. I used 6 + cups of peaches and next time will add about 3 T of tapioca to the fruit. These quantities filled a 9x9 cake dish nicely. Also, I cooked it in the toaster oven for 35 min.

Excellent!  Not only is this easy, but it is so adaptable to any combination of fruit.  I used my own frozen fruit: apple slices, peach slices, plums and blueberries. I partially thawed them in the microwave and proceeded with the recipe.  It turned out wonderful, though I did have to bake it an extra 15 minutes at 350, then reduced the temperature to 250 and let it slowly bake until the topping had completely cooked through, about another 15 minutes.  I'm sure the extra cooking time was due to the fruit being partially frozen.  The cobbler is delicious served warm, at room temperature or even right out of the refrigerator.

I used fresh blackberries, raspberries, strawberries and one nectarine (skin on). I was a little "generous" with my measured one quart's worth of fruit.  Folded 1/2 tsp cinnamon into the batter as well. I baked it in a larger sized pan (in error--3-4 quart size) so maybe it was too big because the cobbler was pretty thinly spread out in the pan.  It was very tasty, though!  I think next time I will experiment using the same larger baking dish, 2 quarts fruit but the exact same batter amount.  We'll see...

This was definitely tasty, but the cooking time estimate seems way off.  I left it in for 40 minutes or so, and the edges of the dish were totally golden brown, but the center was still uncooked batter.

Couldn't find a recipe for pear cobbler so I tried this with just pears. Followed recipe as written. It had an excellent flavor but I think the topping absorbed any juice that may have been in the pears so they didn't soften up enough. We all still liked it. Next time, I will par-cook the pears and make a little syrup for them first, then I think it would be just right.

I made this cobbler with only fresh pears. Mine had to bake for 1 hour. The cobbler was sweet, but not too cakey and sunk into the fruit. I would define it to be a little cookie-ish. Very good and will definitely make it again. Thank you for posting.

I'm not too familiar with making pie or cobbler, but this recipe is too simple to mess up, and too delicious to pass up!  I followed the recipe exactly, except for the cherries (I didn't have any on hand), and it turned out wonderfully.  I'll make this again, any time I have a good excuse!

This was so good and easy.  I made it ahead of time and popped it in the oven as we were sitting down to dinner.  I loved it.  I used pears, apples, and blackberries b/c that was what I had on hand.  I tossed the pears and apples with sugar and cinnamon before putting them in the dish and I added 1/4 tsp. of almond abstract to the batter.  I am making it again tomorrow night and can't wait!!

This is an easy, versatile recipe that I will make again. I used 1 cup of blueberries, 2 cups of nectarines and 2 cups of yellow plums, so I had 1 cup over the recommended amount, but I think this was OK. My only complaints are that it was slightly too tart and a bit underdone just underneath the top part of the batter. So, there are several things I would change next time: 1) Use a shallower pan (I think the 8x8 pan I used was too deep to allow it to cook properly all the way through); 2) Stick a toothpick as far down as possible to check doneness (I pulled mine out at 40 minutes but it still wasn't totally done underneath); and 3) If you have ANY fruit that is the slightest bit tart, add more sugar. In my case it was just my 1 cup of blueberries that was tart; I thought the very sweet nectarines and plums I had would have made up for the tart blueberries, but they didn't.

Wonderful! I didn't have any peaches so I omitted them and instead used 2 types of apples, and a 3 berry mix (raspberry, blueberry and marion berries). I made double the batter mix as suggested by other reviews.  This was a big hit at my dinner party!

Mmmmm!  I used all peaches.  This was so easy to make and even easier to eat!!  My husband and I ate almost the entire pan in one morning!  I added about 2 tbs of brown sugar and a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg to the batter.  I had to bake mine a lot longer than 30 minutes, though.  Delicious!

Good cobbler, a little cake-like as others said but still delicious.  Needs cinnamon and nutmeg, though.  I used all apples and a splash of cider.  I really like that it only calls for 2T of butter, making a fairly healthy and tasty dessert ... or breakfast.

A good cakey cobbler recipe. I personnally prefer the creamier kind but it didn't keep me from enjoying this one! Made it with apricots and plums, which gave a very tart result. Will make this again with peaches, apples or mangoes.

Simple and very good.  I used just blueberriesm with the extra vanilla, a smidge more sugar and cinnamin and nutmeg added to the mix and it came out great...I understand why you should never use more than a quart of berries.....VERY VERY BERRY, as there is little cake.  A definite keeper.  Will certainly make again with different fruits.

Not exactly a "cobbler" in the normal sense but still way too good not to get five stars. I've used a Nect. and Cherry combo *YUM* and also an apple and peach combo. Both turned out wonderful. It only took me 30 minutes to bake. The hardest part of the recipe is slicing the fruit. If you try this keep in mind it will come out almost like a very moist cake and not cobbler.

I really enjoyed the cobbler.  I ended up using 6 peaches which made a quart.  The crust was slightly crunchy and had a slight buttery flavor.  It was the right sweetness for me.  We just added whipped cream and YUM!!

I was disappointed in this recipe after the rave reviews.  I expected a nice juicy cobbler, and it was very dry, not bubbly at all.  I used a quart of blackberries so perhaps it just depends on the fruit you use.

I made this recipe with strawberries, blackberries, and blueberries.  It turned out great. Next time, I will add more sugar to the fruit, the blackberries were just a little too tart.  I served it warm with a little dab of vanilla strawberry swirl ice cream.  Oh so good! Thanks for the recipe!

The batter was too thick for me to spread over the fruit so I had to add a little extra milk.  Perhaps because of this it came out a bit tougher than I would have liked.

excellent! Light and not too sweet. The cobbler-bit is not too cakelike, and not overpowering either. The fresh flavors and textures of the fruits come through. I think I would add a little cinnamon & nutmeg to the batter next time. I'd recommend it!

To be honest, I've been making variations of this recipe for over 30 yrs.  I make it even easier by using Buisquik, and adding sugar and vanilla to the batter when its wet.  Super easy my way, takes 10 minutes to prepare.

I substituted gluten free flour and needed to bake it a bit longer.  Turned out very well and disappeared later that evening.  Some preferred it with ice cream while others preferred it with fresh whipped cream.  I like it naked.  Hot, crispy, chewy and gooey.  Mmm-hmmm!

I used 4 cups of fresh fruit... Sliced peaches, blueberries and blackberries. I sprinkled a little bit of lemon juice on the fruit, a little bit of sugar on the fruit, and a little cinnamon since I didn't have any vanilla. In my opinion I could have added additional fruit there was plenty of topping which was excellent crunchy and soft at the same time

I had excess fruit that was ripe, and would go bad before I could eat it all. I had never made a cobbler before,  so I was looking for an easy recipe- more so to get an idea of proportion of ingredients. So happy to have found this recipe! Simple and seemed to have room for adjustments. 

Here is how mine went:
3 apples (random varieties I got from the farmers market), 2 peaches, 2 pears, frozen cherries (eyeballed the amount to look balanced with the rest of the fruit). I was worried the apples would brown while i was making the batter, so i tossed the fruit in lemon juice. And added almond extract, because I love that stuff and put it in everything I bake! :)  I noticed many reviewers added cinnamon, so I did as well.

The volume of fruit seemed too much for a 2qt pan, so I used a 3 qt pan. I doubled the batter, one because I was using a larger pan and two I just like a higher crust/fruit ratio.
I used almond flour and coconut flour instead of all purpose (just what I had on hand, leftover from another endeavor). Increased the baking powder to comp for the different flour.
The consistently of the batter was more dough like, almost like a pie crust would be, I was a bit concerned since to me "batter" means more liquid, like cake/pancake. Well, it smelled good, tasted good, and if I was making an actual pie this would be what I wanted so I thought it would still likely work. I used my hands and  crumbled/spread it over the fruit.

Baked mine for 45 mins.

Excellent! If you add berries, or even if you don't, definitely add 1 TBSP of Minute Tapioca so the juices don't over flow.

I made this cobbler last night with about 5 cups of blackberries from my mom's backyard and it was a hit! I added some sugar to the fruit since it was a little tart, and baked it in an oval 1-1/2 quart casserole dish,  but only had to bake it for maybe 7 extra minutes to make sure the crust was completely done. I also didn't have vanilla extract (didn't realize I had run out!), and it was still great. There's still a whole lot of blackberries, so I can't wait to make this again!

I haven't made very many cobblers but I made this one last night and it was so delish!  I used apples, plums, peaches, and blueberries, as that was all that I had on hand.  I followed the recipe exactly, other than leaving out a few fruits, and it was great! Had a wonderful tart and sweet flavor and was a fantastic way to get rid of some extra fruit that I didn't want to go bad.  Very easy and quick to make as well! UPDATE: In my previous review I forgot to add that I did end up having to bake this longer than the suggested 30 mins.  I made 1 large and 1 small casserol dish and baked them together, so that could have been the issue.  I just watched it and when it was golden on top I took it out.  I would say I baked it for about 20 more mins, so maybe about 50-60mins totally (using an electric oven and in the summer, which could have also been an issue).

LOVED it! Like someone else, before I poured on the batter mixture, I sprinkled some ground cinnamon and pure maple sugar on the apples (could probably use a bit of pure maple syrup if you can't find maple sugar. I found mine in Door County, WI). I used 4 apples and 1 pear. A perfect combination of fruit and bread/cobbler! I look forward to making with other kinds of fruit.

Very nice treat with our fresh pears.  Added some blueberries and it was delish.  Next time I will use less sugar, though.  Just too sweet with the fruit chosen. I should have known better.  I suspected...

I had to cook for almost 40 min to achieve the golden crust...
