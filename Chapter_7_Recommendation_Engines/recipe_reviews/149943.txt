Hi we drink this in england all the time. But what we call lemonade is not the same as american lemonade, it is a lemon and lime soda like sprite or seven up. I can't imagine this would be good with american lemonade so give it a try with the soda, you won't be disapointed.

I have made my own and have had them in England. They are not made with American lemonade, but with 7up, fanta, sprite or another lemon lime soda.

This is a nice summer quencher.  One of our local breweries makes a "Summer Shandy" beer but I find this recipe more to my liking.

Someone I know that had these in England told me to use apple juice or lemon lime soda for a Shandy, not lemonade, and that it should be about half and half. I used 6 oz beer, 3 oz apple juice and 3 oz Sprite. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but it was good.
