It should be noted that when you slice the eggplants, make sure you are slicing them lengthwise (not width-wise like my fiance did) :)   Also, I would recommend instead of frying the slices, bake them on a cookie sheet w/ a layer of olive oil at 350 degrees for about 15 min.  
I also used fresh garlic instead of garlic powder.  Good recipe.

This is so good, but a lot of work, so I modified it. Instead of dredging in flour and then the egg/cheese mixture, I omit the flour altogether and just dredge the eggplant in egg, then in the cheese/spices mixture before frying. Instead of rolling it up, I just layer slices in the pan (with some sauce in the bottom of the dish) and put the cheese/spinach mixture on top, and then cover with the remaining sauce. It's truly awesome!

What a great dish!!!  Make extra because this is one that's even better the next day. 

The batter for frying is too thick.  I thinned it with milk.

Something no one is saying here.  Slice the eggplant lengthwise or you won't be able to roll it.

Also, I have added Sundried Tomatos and Basil from our garden to the filling.  Fresh garlic would probably be good.  i put mushroom slices in the botom of the pan with the sauce.  

Fairly easy dish - Make it your own.

This recipe makes the best low carb vegetarian lasagna ever!!! I used about 1/3 a cup of Atkins low carb bake mix instead of flour and and some cream to the egg wash. 1 small eggplant thinly sliced is enough to make a 9x13 pan. Another great alternative is adding ground beef or italian sausage. This is the first time I have cooked eggplant that was edible and this was freakin great!!!!

This recipe is amazing! I have been looking for a good eggplant dish for a long time, and this hit the spot! I did use a basil/oregano combo instead of buying the prepackaged italian seasoning. However, this is a great dish, thanks for the idea!

This was great! However, I did not use the frying method, I roasted my eggplant in the oven using extra virgin olive oil for 2-3 min on each side instead. Another idea is to dredge the eggplant in flour w/ salt and pepper and saute in skillet w/ extra vir. olive oil until golden brown. Little healthier too. The spinach mixture was awesome!!! Yummy!

I would consider this a sort of eggplant parmigiana or lasagne. Slice your eggplants longways! And use 2. I followed others suggestions that one is enough...not so! I also didn't bread the eggplant as per the recipe. I beat one egg, mixed together breadcrumbs with parmesan & italian seasoning, then bathed each slice in the egg, then coated it with the breadcrumb mix. I then baked them. Then I picked up with the rest of the recipe, layering the eggplant like lasagne instead of making rolls. I liked it...I'll definately try it at least one more time.

Although it says "thinly sliced" in the description, in the ingredients list it doesn't say whether to slice the eggplant lengthwise or not and it doesn't say how thin to slice it. The egg and parmesan cheese makes too thick a coating. I would make it this way: dip in flour, dip in egg, THEN dip in parmesan (or omit completely). Not easy for beginner to follow.

SINFULLY GOOD! The second time making this I found it was easiest to stack the eggplant slices layering the mixture between. Then take slices off the top and fry. Less mess and evenly coated. I recommend using a kitchen gadget slicer for even slices - one eggplant will do, but it helps to find one large and rectangular shaped.

This dish was delicious. I found I had to add an extra egg in the egg dip mixture to have enough to coat the rest of the eggplant slices before frying. My husband and I thought it was a restaurant quality dish. Great flavor, great combination.

Very good!! My 11 yr. old and I are big fans! I made Chunky Marinara Sauce from this site and used that instead of jarred sauce. And the only other thing I did different was to layer the eggplant, ricotta mixture, sauce, cheese, and so on....my eggplant slices were kinda short since the eggplant I had on hand were small and not longer....so the rolling would have been a nightmare. The flavors were still great....loved the spinach in the filling.  We love eggplant here so it was a hit! Thanks!

OK...I am doing  something I swore I wouldn't.  I am reviewing a recipe after making some serious changes to it first.

The first step of coating the eggplant and frying sounded like too much work...so I just peeled the sides of the eggplant, made slices perpindicular to those peels (so that the eggplant would retain skin on the edges only).  Then, I brushed olive oil, salt and peeper on each side and roasted in the oven on two baking sheets @ 350 for 15 minutes, turning the slices halfway through and switching the baking sheets on the racks.

I added marjoram (not a fan of oregano), garlic and nutmeg to the cheese mixture and proceeded with the roll-up and the sauce.  

SPECTACULAR!

I will be making this EASY, EASY dish again and again...perhaps adding some browned Italian sausage or cooked diced chicken to the filling for variety.

WONDERFUL!

Fantastic dish!  I did the lasagna version as some others did and my kids gobbled it up!  I added diced mushrooms and some spices to the cheese mixture for the 'layer' and used Italian breadcrumb mix from Whole Foods in lieu of the homemade coating called for in the recipe.  And I only used one large eggplant sliced thin lengthwise and that was more than enough for a 9x13 pan.

Excellent.  I used bread crumbs instead of flour to coat.  I'm not a huge eggplant fan but this was excellent.

Incredible!  As others said, it does take time to fry the eggplant and the batter is too thick.  I found that adding extra water to the batter is just as effective as adding more egg.  In stuffing the eggplant, I also just put the filling in between two slices like a sandwich.  Much easier than rolling it. This passed the "meat-and-potatoes-lover-guy" test with flying colors.

This recipe was great!  My husband loves eggplant rollatine and he said this rivaled some he's gotten at restaurants.  The mixture you dredged in was a little too thick and didn't adhere to the eggplants very well so it got a little messy.  I also made sure I sweated the eggplant beforehand in order to get some of the bitterness out of the eggplant.  Make sure you use large eggplants (or more small ones), otherwise you'll have extra filling left over (and it's so good you won't want any of it to go to waste!!!)

This is a yummy dish, but don't be fooled into thinking it's healthy.  Fried eggplant and cheese, cheese, and more cheese make it delicious but loaded!

A great recipe!  I made a few changes based on other reviewers' tips.  For the eggplant, just an egg wash followed by a Parmesan, herb, garlic, and flour mixture.  Although I fried the eggplant this time, next time I'd infuse some olive oil with garlic and herbs, lightly coat the eggplant, and roast the slices to make it healthier.  The eggplant flavor was muted.  I used one large eggplant (cut 3/16" thick, lengthwise), 2 eggs in egg wash, the full recipe of filling, and homemade sauce.  It is time and labor intensive, but no more than expected for a recipe like this.  Certainly, I'd recommend trying it and customizing it to your tastes.

Impressive presentation, a little labor intensive, but worth it in the end. I used two eggplants, and sliced very thin. Like other reviewers, I added water to the egg mixture, which is definitely too thick to work with as stated. I like lots of flavor, so I added red pepper flakes, sun-dried tomatoes, some garlic, and diced shallots to the recipe. I also had some fresh sweet basil on hand, so chopped that up and added it as well. Very versatile recipe that you can change up as you wish. Will make again.

When I made it according to the directions, the eggplant turned out hard. I suggest microwaving it first to soften and then cook in pan. Otherwise, very good flavor.

I love this recipe, would give it more than 5 stars if I could. I did layer it as others had suggested I can see where rolling would not have worked for me. This is an excellent egg plant dish, definitely a keeper.

Just loved this recipe. Often cook for a vegetarian and will be doing this again for her. Followed another reader's hint and baked the slices in the oven but I used baking paper and simply sprayed with a light olive oil spray - baked about 15 mins and then just popped the mixture on the rolls and rolled them from there. Easy.

The ingredient measurements for this recipe are dubious, although in theory the recipe works well, one should consider the tablespoons of garlic powder and Italian seasoning (and I like garlic) and adjust them to about a third. Also, the batter will not coat two large sliced eggplants unless you squeegee 90% off off each slice starting with the very first one. In the shopping list the 15oz ricotta comes up as 1/8 teaspoon.....but that will just make you laugh (serves 4?, my husband said, they must be The Sopranos)

I cannot PERSONALLY rate this recipe.  The truth is, I hate both eggplant and spinach.  However, I made this for my vegetarian wife and RAVED.  In fact, she said that this was the best thing I've made in the kitchen for her  (and I am the primary chef in our home).  So, wow...this stuff must be great!

As far as preperation is concerned, this is NOT a cinch to make properly.  At least in my case, I had a heck of a mess in the kitchen by the time the work hit the oven.  So bear this in mind when starting the project.

Also, I was surprised at how QUICKLY this eggplant recipe fried.  If your oil is especially hot  (as mine was) keep a close eye on each slice as you add them to the pan.

It smelled great while it was cooking and it looked great when it was finished.  If I wasn't such a vegetable snob, I would have tasted it for sure!  ha!  Enjoy.

This recipe was outrageous, I had to make it for 150 people so I modified it a little.  Instead of rolling up the eggplant which would have take me a week, I layered it like lasagna, same concept a little different look. Also my husband hates eggplant but loved this recipe and wants me to make it again, but this time it won't be for 150 people again.  Thanks for this great recipe.

Thanks for a great recipe.  My family loved it.  The batter for the dipping (prior to frying) was very thick so I had to add several more eggs to thin it out.  If you are making this for the first time, you may want to cut down on the amount of parmesan cheese in batter and perhaps add another egg as well.

Oh my gosh!  This IS awesome!  We both loved this recipe.  It took awhile, this is not an after-work kind of recipe, but, if you have time, it is worth it!  (There was not enough batter- we had to add egg, as others have said and there was a lot of eggplant left over- we sliced it thinner so we could roll it, maybe that was a mistake.)  Very filling also, which is good because we have leftovers!  Will make again!

I really loved the final outcome, but it took longer to make than I had anticipated. Needed to add more eggs to the batter because it was so thick. Very good recipe! Will make again for sure but on a night when I'm not so rushed!

Unlike other reviewers, I didn't think this recipe was too messy.  With the help of my husband, the work went quickly and cleanly.  This recipe gets three stars because I didn't think it was very tasty.  My husband loved it and wolfed it down.  For me, I couldn't eat the fried eggplant (and I love eggplant!).  The frying just made it too heavy.  I ended up eating the sauce and the cheese and spinach with bread.  That part tasted just fine, but because of the eggplant, I won't make this again.

All I can say is WOW! easy and DELICIOUS!!!
I used the advice of other reviews and baked the eggplant instead of frying. Turned out to have a great crust, will deffinatly bake again.
To make this more hearty, I added a pound of ground turkey. This recipie was fantastic! If you like sauce, as does my husband, you might want to use another jar of speghetti sauce. Another note, The eggplant need to be looong, all the grocery store had were short ones and they didn't make that great of a wrap. Will make this recipe for family and at least once a month! This is the best eggplant recipe I have ever made! THANK YOU!!!

Yummy - very filling!  Definitely cut the eggplant lengthwise - something I wouldn't have thought of had it not been for these helpful reviews.  I also baked the eggplant on 350 for 15 minutes - with a layer of olive oil on both sides.  Much easier than frying.  And be prepared for a messy kitchen!

This dish is a little time consuming but oh so yummy! Instead of rolling it, I just sliced it in circles, put the filling in and added more eggplant on top. I also used fresh uncooked spinach in the mix! Very tasty.

I would rate this dish definately a 10 on taste, but a 3 on preparation.  UGH, what a mess.  Like other reviewers, the egg & parm chz was tooo thick.  I added water.  I didn't understand about putting the flour on first THEN adding to the egg/chz mix.  The batter wouldn't stick to it :(  The first few came out with a lot of breading, then I kind of used my hand to paste it on the eggplant.  I agree that 2 large eggplant is way too much. I ended up throwing some away.  I didn't slice mine thin, I made them about a centimeter thick.  I didn't like the frying part, then the rolling part, they were so hot to roll!  Kinda greasy after it baked.  Too much spinach/cheese mix left over, had to throw away.  1 cup of flour is WAY too much.  I would flour as you go.  I nixed the parsley and cooked the spinach first and let it sit to cool.

But nevertheless, my husband was totally happy with it and ate 5 rolls! And he is not a "cheezy" person!  He loved it and I thought it was really good.

Thank you for an exceptionally tasty but messy recipe.

This was, not only, easy to make - but soooo delicious. The presentation is beautiful and the flavor outstanding.  I used fresh garlic (in the filling) in place of the powder and used homeade tomato sauce, rather than a jarred sauce. Outside of that- i followed the recipe exactly.  The preparation of the eggplant really surprised me.  I wasn't sure how putting them in the oven would work, but they came out perfect and pliable.  The only bad thing was when the left-overs were gone... i craved this for several days after.

The egg concoction was a bit think so I suggest omitting the cheese (you can sprinkle it on the eggplant later) and adding a touch of water.  It's a bit heavy but the taste is fabulous.

This recipe is awesome, worth every bit of time, it truely is a recipe you'll try again.  I noticed as well the batter was thick, but I think that added to the flavor, I just added 2 more eggs & 1/2 c of parm for the 2 eggplants & cut the eggplant lengthwise

I made this dish last night and it was really good! I made a lo carb version using no sugar added tomato sauce and I added mushrooms and left out the spinach. I used a medium eggplant and I folded the corners over the cheese mixture and that worked out fine. I had a similar dish at a restaurant and I think this was just as good. I would make it again. Tip, don't fry the eggplant too long. It will get mushy.

So good!  Made it for vegetarian friends exactly as the recipe instructed.  Next time I might cut the garlic in half or use fresh instead, but other than that I wouldnt change a thing!

Great way to use fresh garden eggplant.  I would suggest slicing the eggplant lengthwise, otherwise it is too difficult to roll.  spread cheese mixture liberally!

Excellent!  I loved this recipe, althought I changed it a little.  I dipped the eggplant in flour, then egg/water mixture, then in parmesan cheese mixture (where I substituted a sundried tomato/basil/oregeno combo for italian seasoning, and then fried them in my deep fat frier.  I also layered the eggplant, like lasagne, using spaghetti sauce with italian sausage in it, and adding mushrooms.  It was delicious!  I did not find it to be overly time consuming (about 30 minutes of prep, and 30 minutes of baking) but the end result made it worth it. This is definitely a keeper.

Great recipe to hide spinach from picky eaters!  My husband can't stand spinach but loves this recipe.  To make it easier, instead of rolling I ooured 1/3 of the pasta sauce in the pan and layered 1/2 of the fried eggplant slices on top of the sauce, topped with all of the cheese/spinach mixture, put on the other 1/2 of the eggpland and poured on the rest of the sauce.  Much easier and still good!

This recipe is truly awesome. We just had this for dinner and there were no leftovers. I do not
think that the batter was too thick, actually I
thought it was so good I will probably use it as
a batter for other foods(fried green tomatoes come to mind). 
I did use soy flour just to reduce the carbs and
it worked just fine.
We have eggplants in our garden so this will for
sure be on our menu again.

This recipe was very delicious!  If you don't like eggplant, the eggplant flavor is less strong the second day, yet still delicious!  To make this low carb I ommitted the flour and used Atkins bake mix instead.  We used semi low carb Emeril sauce also. (Rao sauce is even more low carb!) Next time I will salt and drain the eggplant before frying because it soaked up the oil and felt like a sponge!  I also added 2 more eggs as others suggested and cut back on the parmesan in the eggs. We will be sure to make this again!

I tried my own variation on this, omitting the parmesan from the egg mixture and just using seasoned breadcrumbs and eggs. I mixed diced portabello mushrooms, onion, garlic, spinach and mozzerella and rolled this mixture into the eggplant before baking it. Here's the most helpful tip: Drag your significant other into the kitchen and ask him/her to do either the eggplant frying or the stuffing prep, its fun to cook this way! The dish was great!

I sliced the egg plant lengthwise by hand. I followed the recipe as it is written and my guests raved about how good it was I was very happy with this recipe.

A 5 for how the recipe came together and tasted...probably a 4 star for instructions. Two things I'd change...I would add some milk to the egg mixture to thin it out or you'll get blotchy spots and the mixture will disappear well before you are out of eggplant.  Secondly, I would skin the ends of the eggplant slices or the egg mixture will slide right off of those four pieces.

Loved it! Made this recipe for the first time tonight and it was a big hit with my five year old :). The only thing I did different was I added fresh basil to the spinach mixture! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

The recipe does not specify, but it must mean to slice the eggplant lengthwise to have enough to roll.  Even then, I was not able to roll it well and the stuffing seeped out.

Definitely has nice flavor, and is a good filling meal.  However, I would not give it five stars due to how time intensive it is to make, and it makes a heck of a mess in the kitchen.  I even tried to use the suggestion of just making it lasagna style to make it a little easier, but it still took quite a bit of effort to prepare.

It was good, but not great, especially for the time and mess I made.  I did as several of the reviews mentioned and baked the eggplant.  The pieces browned nicely for the most part, but I was still left with raw flour in some places.  I did add some baby portabella mushrooms to the filling because I wanted to finish them off.  The filling was great and I'll probably make it again for stuffed shells sometime.  If I try this recipe again, I will layer the eggplant with the filling like a lasagna. UPDATE:  The leftovers were much better.  The flavors really had a chance to blend together.  My husband liked it, so I'll probably try it again sometime.

I took the advice to cut the eggplant vertically and I think it made this much easier. The 2 tablespoons of garlic powder seemed shocking, but worked fine. My family enjoyed this and I think it would be a good company dish. There are lots of pots and pans, so it's not a recipe for everyday cooking. I will definately make it again.

This was really good.  I used only 1 eggplant, and decided to use the egg and parmesan cheese seperately rather than mixed together as the recipe said.  I had to double the egg mixture and use more than the required parmesan cheese.  
I also used the deep fryer to fry the eggplant.  This recipe was really good!

Eggplant is very different tasting, this was my first time cooking with it.  I thought this was very good, I love anything with this amount of cheese in it!  I thought this was even better as left overs.

Very good and rich. I used a madolin to make the eggplant slices and it worked well, but after cooking most of their taste was gone due to the thiness. Using a knife for a little thicker slice would easily solve this. We'll definitely make it again. A sweeter sauce, like a tomato basil, works well.

I LOVE Eggplant Parmasean, so ths recipe sounded good. I made some changes, I used lowfat cheese, and soaked the eggplant in salted water, then rinsed it, to take out some of the bitterness. I started to follow the directions on frying, but didn't like the way they were coming out (spongy and greasy!), so I switched to the tried and true method of flour/egg/breadcrumbs. I had bought two large eggplants, and it was WAY too much, I think one large, or two sm/med. would be perfect. Luckily I had enough to double the filling recipe. Even though I added a little nutmeg and extra garlic, this still was on the bland side. You couldn't really taste the spinach. It was good, not great, and certainly not awesome. I layered it like a lasagna, and it was still a LOT of work. I can't even fathom rolling and stuffing! Probably won't make it again.

This was a pain to make. Next time I would definately try baking the eggplant instead of frying. The dipping mixture was too thick and we ran out (I used only egg whites plus I added milk). One eggplant was enough for three of us, plus we had leftovers. Not my favorite, but the leftovers are gone. The eggplant tasted like chicken or fish??

The flavor of this recipe is wonderful. Just make sure your egg/Parmesan dredge is thin and not to thick or it won't stick. also my eggplant slices were to small to roll so I made it into a lasagna. my husband loved it. He said the spinach was a different twist.

Have made this numerous times and love the way the eggplant comes out and rolls so easily.  As others have mentioned, the egg mixture is very thick.  I've added egg whites to the eggs and would start with 1/2 cup of Parmesan versus 1 cup.  When I made it following the recipe, still had to add either water or egg whites to mixture to get through the frying, and would squeeze/wipe off (with my fingers) the heavy mixture to give it a finer coating.  They come out excellent.  Also add pesto to my ricotta mixture, and people have raved about it.  Good jumping off recipe to make it your own.

I traded out the flour for Gluten free flour and stacked the eggplant discs.  This made a tray of eggplant and enough for leftovers and lunches.  Go for it!

It was my very first time eating egg plant. So I tried this recipe, If you have to cut the eggplant with a knife, like I did I found It very difficult to cut it thinly as I was holding it.. So because of this I did like some of the other reviews and layered the eggplant, instead of rolling it.  He reminded me a lot of  Lasagna,  As far as the consistency and the flavor of the egg plant. If I get a craving for lasagna I would make it again. I think next time I will try a different eggplant recipe.

Had a hard time getting the egg mixture to stick to the flour coated eggplant. Had to add some extra egg to make it wet enough and had to press it on more than dredge it. We probably did something wrong.

This was so good and very filling. I will make it again but next time I would rather bake the eggplant instead of fry.

I love this recipe.....however the batter was too thick and not enough for the 2 large eggplants we had.  We ended up adding another half batch and adding a little beer to mixture to thin it out a bit.

Love this recipe!!!  I have made eggplant rollatini before but this recipe is the best with the spinach in the cheese mixture.  I made it for Easter Dinner and got so many compliments with one person saying it was the best she ever had.  I did sweat the eggplant first for 30 minutes.  The only ingredient I left out was the Italian seasoning as I find this spice too overpowering.  I also made my own sauce.  I would make it again and again.

This was wonderful, alot of work but worth it, I tried baking eggplant in oven, never got level of crispness I wanted, ended up using canola oil and crisping them up in a skillet.Loved the spinach in it which I used fresh chopped not frozen, and a little extra cheese. Yummmm

The batter is very thick I added an extra egg and then I used two more eggs and salt to wash my remaining eggplant when the breading mixture ran out.  My eggplant was thin so I just layered the sauce then eggplant then cheese then eggplant cheese and a but of sauce and cheese on top. I also think two tablespoons of garlic powder may have been a little heavy handed maybe I'd just use a 2-3 cloves of fresh next time.

I made a recipe just like this when my kids were small, but the eggplant was cooked under a broiler for a few minutes to make them pliable enough to roll.  I have forgotten how good this is, I will be making this soon.. I wouldn't change a thing except how to prep the eggplant....

This is a great recipe for vegetarians and carnivores alike!  It got quite a lot of attention from the family where I had to save it aside for my vegetarian stepdaughter so she could have the leftovers.  

When I make it again, I'll make sure the eggplant is sliced quite thinly.  And yes, slice it longways.

Delicious.  My kids had no idea they were eating eggplant.  I added a piece of prosciutto to each slice for a little extra flavor.  The prep time for me was much longer than 20 minutes but worth every second.

I was really disappointed with this meal, with the great reviews, i thought it would be really really good, But unfortunately for me, it was not. First off, the egg mixture thingy was wayyyy too thick, i dipped my first 3 slices of eggplant in it and there was not too much batter left, so I had to make more, and i thinned that out quite a bit with milk. I didnt roll the eggplant up I just layered the sauce, eggplant, ricotta mixture, eggplant sauce and cheese in a pyrex dish. Took nearly an hour to fry all that eggplant too.
I even added some fresh garlic in addition to the garlic powder, and it still didn't have too much flavor. the only reason i gave it two stars is because it is edible, but now i have a 1/2 a pan left.

I made half the recipe and my boyfriend and I had enough leftovers for another entire meal.

I will probably not fry the eggplant next time because it makes the leftovers soggy and is not as healthy as baking, but otherwise the recipe is perfect!  So delicious!

I didn't have time to deal with rolling up the eggplant slices, so I layered them in the pan instead with the filling inbetween. I also doubled the sauce. This was a big hit. "Lasagne lite".

Ok - I am sorry I changed everything.  I loved the sound of the ingredients.  I was trying to recreate something I had at an Italian festival.  After reading the reviews I skipped the breading.  I sauted the eggplant in olive oil and sprinkled on the spices used in the breading as they sauted.  My intention was to make a lasagna version.  I assembled it easily however without pasta it's extremely runny.  Oh well, my very picky husband loved it.  Next time I will roll it. For the sauce I used some frozen meat sauce I had and added a can of plain tomato sauce with sauted onions and garlic.  Yumm!

I have just made this and the dipping mixture is way way too thick. Before you start i would add milk so it is of a dipping consistancy. Please do this as it is as I said way too thick. Messy to make, I did it on my day off. Not a quick dinner my any means. I will however make it again with a thinner mixture.

I agree that the egg mixture was too thick, I added an extra egg.  I would probably use the eggs as an egg wash and add all the other ingredients to the flour as the breading, but I won't be making this one again, I don't think this was really all that good.
