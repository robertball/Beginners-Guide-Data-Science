I really like this even though I'm not a Huge cabbage fan. I made it for christmas eve and fiance liked it too. It's almost a comfort food. Made everything exactly as described except I only used 3/4 of a cabbage- not the largest one at the market either.

I'm a huge cabbage fan, so you really can't go wrong with cabbage, for me. To turn this into a one dish meal, I added a can of diced tomatoes, some smoked, ground turkey sausage, 1 c rice, 2 c chicken broth, onion, garlic & caraway seeds. It would have made a great side dish, as is & made a great one dish meal with just a few additions. My changes made it taste a little like a deconstructed cabbage roll casserole. We enjoyed it.
