This is the old Betty Crocker recipe that I made for decades until I had to throw the book away when it was finally falling apart at the seams. I always reduced the vinegar by one half due to the overall acidity. The recipe scales very well and lends itself to reducing or increasing the fresh vegetables, based on your tastes. Crisp croutons are a good final addition at the table. Thank you for bringing back the best gazpacho recipe I've ever made.

I had this at a friends house and loved it, I never had gazpacho before. She showed me the recipe and had to make it, was very easy and fun to make. Since it did not have a photo I took one and added it to this great recipe.

Vickie C.  The name should be changed to give Betty Crocker credit for this wonderful recipe.  I have made it for many years and love how easily you can make it and add to and modify it to your taste.  It is the only thing I love about hot weather!

I added some crushed garlic for a little extra added flavor. Thought it was a good addition.

This is the best recipe I've ever tried.  The beef boullion is exactly what is needed in the soup.  I serve it with crab meat or shirmp and a dollup of sour cream.  Really, really good!
