When I added the onions to the pan, the sugar syrup pretty much seized to a big clump (I suspect from the water in the onions).  I just kept breaking it apart, and it finally melted down.  After that, it took about 40 minutes to reach the jam consistency, but it was worth the wait.  We had this on sliders, and it was so good.  I have some leftover, so I'm going to try it on a cream cheese chunk to have with some crackers.  Good job Wendy Marie.  UPDATE 4.16.12  Made another batch of this, and slathered it onto a ciabatta roll with turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce & tomato.  It was delicious.

Ive made this a handful of times now,with the only change being 2 tsp minced garlic added. First few times I followed directions exactly as is. The other day I did it a bit differently, and I think it came out better. I sauteed the onions first, and once they turned translucent, I added BROWN sugar to them, and a dash of Worcestershire. I find that this gave it a richer taste, and helped it set up better in the end. If your a fan of caramelized onions, this is a jar to keep in the fridge! Don't be afraid to make chopping onions a family affair, because I guarantee you'll want to make more than one jar (works out be about 7-8 smaller onions per 12 oz jar when cooked down)!

This is so good! Used plain old yellow onions (because that's what I had on hand) and it turned out delicious! Gave this four stars because I just changed the way I cooked it - I was nervous to add sugar to hot oil so I added the onions to the oil and let them just start to carmelize. Then I added the vinegar, s+p and brown sugar, and let that cook down to that jam consistency. Yummy! Will definitely be making this again!

Omgosh!  First I tried making this with brown sugar.Bad move,  Burned it! Second time I used white sugar, turned off the flame on stove and it Burned again! 3rd X was a charm. This was Really good! I grilled brauts and ate them with flour tortillas. Liked the sweet n sour relish on dogs. Thank you Wendy Marie

Just awesome!  After reading reviewers saying that the sugar seized up on them, I simply added it later on in the process.  Friends and family beg me for jars of this, and its a huge hit at Charity Bake/Cooking Sales as a condiment. I get asked for it every time now. We use it alongside pork,  meatloaf, steak, scrambled eggs, etc.  It takes awhile to make but well worth the effort.  I prefer using Balsamic vinegar over red wine vinegar also.  This is a must try!

I did like it.  However, it didn't look very pretty. I don't think it ever REALLY jells like jam.  So be carful to not over cook it. I probably over cooked!  If I was to have a BBQ and invite family and friends, I would make it again.  Yet, 4 cups of onion only made a little over 8oz. Also, my sugar seized up also and I just kept on it . . . it all breaks up!

Searched through many recipes and decided on this because it was easy. WOW!! It's a keeper. I also agree with another reviewer,next time will chop onions smaller. I'd suggest a 1/4" dice. Mine were 1/2" so halfway through the cooking process, I used a hand masher and mashed them finer. Only had 1/4 cup of red wine vinegar so used apple cider vinegar to make 1/2 cup. Can't be rushed though, it did take about an hour and half from start to finish and worth the time. Enjoy!

As others mentioned, once the onions were added the sugar became crystalized clumps. But I turned the heat on low and let it melt on its own. I didn't have Red Wine Vinegar but used Balsamic instead - same amount as called for. I also added red pepper flakes, 4 garlic cloves and some celery seed. Once it cooled down I put it in the food processor. Tastes pretty close to the Sweet Onion sauce Subway uses on their sandwiches.

I am making this right now! I had a ton of onions, w/no idea what to do w/them, so I jumped on the internet to look for ideas. Being the internet, there are a million & 1 choices.  I've diced & froze several, making a goulash & of course, making Onion Jam...and (obviously ;) chose this recipe. When I 1st saw the recipes I was nah, that doesn't sound vry good but I kept reading more & more & since hubby & I luv onions so much I figured y not?! I did have the same problem that others mentioned about the sugar seizing on me & that was my fault bc I thought that I had the pan way too hot & removed it frm the fire. But, again, as others said it jus took a lil effort & time to get it melted back dwn.  I took a sm taste (b4 & aftr) adding the vinegar & it is vry tasty indeed. I can't wait to try it on all kinds of things.  If it comes out as well I think its going to :-) I will have to dbl the recipe nxt time (or possibly triple. I jus checked it & it doesn't make nearly as much as I thought it would) TY for sharing ur recipe!

This is so good! My onions took about two hours to reduce to a thickened consistency. Great caramelized onion flavor. I enjoyed it first with some turkey kielbasa. Will keep on hand.

I didn't have red wine vinegar but had balsamic so used that instead.  This was quite good - except using the balsamic causes the mixture to turn almost black.  I'm going to use it at an upcoming July 4th cookout to accompany a cheese board.

After searching extensively online for an onion jam/chutney recipe, I decided to try this one, as it had only a few ingredients, and I wanted my first venture into onion jam to be an easy one.  The end result was delicious, we had it on mashed potatoes for supper, and I will have some tomorrow for lunch on crackers with cream cheese.  Being jam, it is a bit sweet, but the tartness of the vinegar balances it out nicely.  My only critique would be to chop the onions more finely to make it easier to spread if you want to use it as such.

Wow!  Delicious.   I think I would prefer thinly sliced (&perhaps halved) onions next time.  My sugar seized even before I got the onions into the pan but thankfully I read reviews stating that this would melt back out.   Mine is very thick--perhaps I overlooked but flavor is great.  Next time I'm going to try balsamic vinegar.

Super simple and good on everything.  Don't worry if your mixture separates as the sugar cooks- it will melt as it browns, just keep stirring.  Also,  when your onions go in, the sugar might stick to the bottom as it cools- again, just keep stirring.  I ran out of red wine vinegar when I made a huge batch the second time around- ended up using about a quarter red wine vinegar, a quarter apple cider vinegar, and half balsamic vinegar.  Still amazing.  Great, easy recipe that impresses friends!

One of the things I love about baking and cooking in this computer age is that I can read comments on recipes and know ahead of time what some of the obstacles might be.  In the case of this Onion Jam, the comments of others proved invaluable. I made a few changes based on the comments including not to worry when the sugar seizes and that balsamic vinegar could be substituted.  Both tips made all the difference in the world.  This  jam is a delicious - a real keeper.

I've made this Onion Jam once and the only thing I regret is it was a small amount. I'm making ten cups today. And I'll share it with one of my friends. Just Delicious on top of buttered toast with bacon, hamburgers, pork chops w/ mash potatoes,

This is the first time I've had onion jam so I wasn't sure what to expect. I made it exactly as the recipe was written.  It was very tasty!  I feel like it was very oily though.  I wonder if this is the usual consistency.  I will definitely make it again!

This was a bust right from the start....the sugar in the oil turned to a hard lump. Then when I added the onions, all the moisture from them were pulled out and seperated. I persisted..thinking if I simmered the sugar would melt again, which it did, but the water never evaporated...I simmered for nearly an hour..even added more sugar to thicken...I ended up pouring the water off..and now I am left with nothing that looks like the picture. ugh

Absolutely excellent. I have made it every three days because I can't live without it. I use a mandolin to slice the onions.
Does anyone know if this can be water bath canned?

Loved this!  I used brown sugar and a bit of worstershire as another review suggested.  Next time I will cut back a bit on the brown sugar, but this was a big hit on chicken and burgers!

I'm really glad I read the reviews on this one - I made it strictly following the directions. I ended up with a good thing that I'm definitely eating the  out of, but I'm excited to try some of the other suggestions. I'll be making this one regularly.

OMG, where have you been all my life?!  I’m in love.  I only had 2 cups of onions so made 1/2 recipe.  I’ll need to buy more onions.  This is the best thing I’ve ever tasted!  Can’t wait to put in on our pork sandwiches tonight.  Yum!

I added mushrooms to mines, for extra deliciousness. The red wine vinaigrette gives it an extra flavor. Next time I will try to use wine instead of the vinaigrette.

This is delicious. I took a cream cheese block out of the fridge and covered it with onion jam. Served with crackers as an appetizer. Went over very well.

Wow! This is awesome. I used homegrown onions, which were quite intense, and followed the recommendations that the onions be added to the oil, cooked some, then added the sugar. It was served over cream cheese at a family function and it was a big hit. I will absolutely make it again. (Tempted to eat it without the cream cheese!)

I have made onion jam before. As another reviewer wrote I sliced onion thinly. I think it helps with carmelizing the onions. I add half white and half brown sugar. This is simple to make and tastes delicious on its own.

I made this with brown sugar and added a little chopped bacon and minced garlic.  It is wonderful! I used my mandolin and got super thin slices of onion.  We took it to the campground and ate it on burgers and brats.  My sugar also seized up while cooking but with some patience I worked it out.  Great recipe!
