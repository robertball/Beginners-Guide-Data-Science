I made this with watermelon and pink honeydew.  I didn't have lemon-lime soda so I squeezed 1/2 fresh lime in and added 1 tsp. sugar.  I'm sure the carbonation of the soda would add a nice sparkle.  I will definitely make again and add the cantaloupe next time.  Thx. Bishop!

I didn't like the way this smoothie immediately separates - doesn't maintain consistency

It has a weird consistency! I followed the recipe and really did NOT like how it tasted. I added another cup and a half of watermelon, some more Sprite, sugar, and frozen strawberries, a little bit of salt, and a couple drops of lime juice and it tasted a lot better! Not amazing, but my family liked it! (and they're a tough crowd.) Not bad!
