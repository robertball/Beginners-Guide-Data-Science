This was pretty good, a basic tuna salad. I added a little table spice blend to give it some zing. To the reviewer who was disappointed because this recipe was missing the mayo: The whole point of the recipe is that it does not contain mayo, it's even in the title of the recipe.

I had this for lunch today only I modified it a little bit. Instead of bread and butter pickles I used Mt.Olive Dill Salad Cubes and omitted the salt. It was very good on whole wheat bread. I will be making this often.

This was a great, easy, healthy recipe!  I just made one serving for lunch and it was filling and satisfied all of my cravings.  It would have been just as easy to make the entire salad and feed a family.  I loved it!

Ok, this was missing something MAYO.  Seriously this needs some kind of "glue" to hold it together.

Put it on a bed of spinach and eat as a "salad" (hence the name of this thing) if you have a hard time keeping the ingredients together.  If you're goal is eating healthier you could skip the bread anyhow.

I thought this was lacking a bit of flavor, so I added more chopped pickle and mustard.  i did not have any problem with not having a binder bc I accidently processed the egg and pickle a bit too long, which gave me a weird mix that was kinda chunky but not really, and had some liquid to bind.  I might try this again with less eggs--it seemed like too many eggs.  Of course, couldve been my fault since I processed so long.  Thanks for the recipe!

I think this is a great, healthy alternative to the fat-laden mayo versions, especially since I don't care for the low-fat or fat-free varieties.  I sometimes add lemon pepper and green onion, just for added flavor.  For more crunch, I sometimes add chopped celery.

Pretty good for a no mayo tuna salad.  I did use a couple dollops of thick greek style plain yogurt tho as a kind of glue.  I also didnt use sweet pickles, as they had a bit to much carbs (sugar) for my application of this meal, so I added 2 tsp of sugar to sweeten it.

This tuna salad may not be the best tuna salad  ever but since my husband doesn't like mayo, it is great! He really likes it and it's easy to make just a little messy.

Very easy.  I plan on using this recipe and ditch the mayo for good. I did add one can of corn just to add to the crunch. What a great recipe.

I was looking for a healthy tuna salad recipe with no mayo and this one fit the bill!!  :)  I was very pleased with this recipe as is and it is also good if tweaked a bit.  This time I made it I didn't add hard boiled eggs, or the pickles and celery, instead I only added the sweet pickle juice (Famous Dave's sweet and spicy pickle juice), a little sweet and spicy jalapeno juice, a tiny pinch of crushed red pepper flakes, a little onion powder, a little garlic salt, a tiny drizzle of olive oil and a little drizzle of white vinegar as well as about a 1/2 tsp of white sugar and it was delicious.  It was a little sweet, a little tangy and a little spicy.

I added some homemade canned bell pepper relish that we have in addition to the relish. Also adding mustard helps bind it together and adds some zing. I used Mustard Girl Sweet n' Fancy Yellow, but Arizona Heat would have been good too. And seriously, to the person who wrote the negative review because the recipe has no mayo - perhaps don't click on a recipe that states in the title that is has no mayo in it. Good grief. This recipe saved the day when I craved tuna salad, but had no mayo in the house.

I thought this was a great recipe and a good spin on your everyday tuna salad. I made a smaller batch (two eggs and one 5 oz. can tuna). I did omit the celery because I don't care for it. I ate mine over a bed of green leaf lettuce with some sweet onion dressing and a dash of balsamic vinaigrette dressing. 

It actually binded together pretty well but another reviewer had a great idea of using fat free plan greek yogurt as a binder.

I love this recipe for including the proper method for hard-cooked eggs, but I think there are too many of them.  I used 3 5-oz cans of tuna, all other things as written, and it's still a lot more salad than tuna.

If you don't want mayo, you can always use a light vinaigrette mixed together of extra virgin olive oil, Dijon mustard, and a little vinegar.  You get moist without the mayo fat
