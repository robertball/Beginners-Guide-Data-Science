While the recipe I've used for these bars for probably 20-plus years goes by a different name, it varies only in that it calls for milk chocolate chips (which I prefer) rather than the semi-sweet. Since package sizes of brownie mix vary, I also always follow the package directions rather than what's directed in this recipe. This is a real crowd pleaser for those who like their sweet treats rich, gooey and decadent and is easily put together with pantry ingredients likely already at hand. Once the bars are firm, there is no need to keep them refrigerated.

This is the second year I've made these to pass out to friends and neighbors during the holidays and I always get such great compliments on them. They are so gooey and delicious, and the crunch from the rice crispy puts it over the top! I recommend using Betty Crocker's fudge brownie mix and under bake by a few minutes so that when you put the marshmallows on top and continue cooking the brownies won't get too done by the end. Cover the entire brownie mix with the marshmallows because once they're baked you don't want to try and spread or smear them or you'll just get a mess. Really let it cool before pouring the chocolate/peanut butter topping on so the marshmallows won't smear off. Such a good recipe!

WOW!! These were GREAT! They are very rich! For the brownie portion I used Ghiradelli brownie mix from Costco but followed the directions on the box and then put it in a 9x13 inch glass dish for 28 min.  I didn't change anything else.  I think that your favorite brownie mix/recipe is what you should use. We had several people over for dinner and served this for dessert.  Everyone LOVED it!  It is now one of our favorite desserts. Next time I am going to try some of it without the rice krispies because I think that I personally will like it better without them but everyone else liked the crunch.

All I can say is YUM!  I made them as written and loved them, but this is also a good base for modifying.  Add different nuts and/or white chocolate chips to the brownie.  For the person who rated it one star because the marshmallows were too chewy, you baked the marshmallows too long!  I baked the dish just until the marshmallows puffed up with and a hint of brown.  No longer.

Very easy recipe and comes out nice and rich.  The semi-sweet chips keep it from being too sweet.  The "topping" nearly doubles the thickness so cut them small.  For nice clean slices make sure the topping is well set.

I used Duncan Hines Dark Chocolate Fudge mix, following the "low fat" version (replacing the oil with apple sauce) and Jif Natural peanut butter.

Thank you for posting!  I have been hunting all over for this recipe after hubby came home raving about these brownies someone had brought to work.

Used Ghiradelli brownie mix.  I used the oil/eggs/water that the box called for (2 eggs for thicker brownies per the box) and did use a 9X13 pan even though the box was for a 9X9.  I was worried they would turn out too thin but they were perfect.  Very easy to make and everyone loved them!  Used semi sweet choc chips as recipe says.  We stored them in the fridge and the marshmallow stayed soft and gooey.  Will make again!

I too used the D/H Dark Choc Fudge Brownie mix. The mix was not the amount the recipe called for (it was less). Regardless, I followed this recipes measurements and time and the brownie turned out great. The chocolate topping is delish! I do not recommend refrigerating this because the marshmallows got too stiff. My guests loved it and even wanted to bring some home to share with their kids and husbands. I really liked the richness and the flavors of each layer. I will definitely make his again.

3 1/2 stars. I made these yesterday. They were a hit at our get together. They are very, very sweet. I made the recipe as stated with the exception of replacing semi sweet chocolate chips for milk chocolate. If i make them again, I think I'll try swapping lightly crushed pretzel pieces in place of the rice krispies.

Very decadent. I used dark chocolate throughout the entire recipe to make it less sweet, and it helped. The topping was gooey and delicious though. Good to use on another recipe. Better when refrigerated.

A rich way to class up some brownies.  I followed the cooking instructions on the box of brownies I used which varied only slightly from this recipe.  For those who complain about the marshmallow layer being too chewy, as another reviewer noted, your cooking them too long.  "Slightly melted" is when they just start puffing up.  This results in a light, gooey layer. In my oven, it took just short of two minutes.  I used semi-sweet chocolate chips which I thought paired well with the peanut butter.  I would have liked more crunch so next time I make this recipe, I plan to half the peanut butter and chocolate chips but keep the cereal at 1.5 cups.  One of the great things about this recipe is that it can be switched up to ingredients on hand or your taste of the day.

Great combinations of flavors! Could have eaten the whole pan. Just baked the brownies according to the package directions and followed the recipe from there.

Yummy and gooey! These were a huge hit! Recipe comes together easily and isn't too time consuming. I didn't wait for the brownies and mellow to cool all the way, and they still turned out great. The recipe is fairly versatile, as well. Love it!

I made this for a church Bible study group.  It was loved by all.  Be prepared for a heavy dessert if prepared "chewy" as an option for the brownie mix (with 3 eggs).

Tasted great.  Used Ghirardelli Chocolate Supreme mix, followed box instructions to make.  Used semi-sweet chips, everyone agreed it was sweet enough, but everyone but me thought there was too much peanut butter (I thought it was perfect).  Marshmallows were 3 minutes only in the oven.   Makes a lot, will be eating this for a few days.

I use dark chocolate brownie mix and dark chocolate chips. Also, if you don't have rice krispies, crushed rice squares work well.

Very easy to make and a crowd pleaser!  I didn't use all of the marshmallows as called for since I was worried my pan wouldn't fit the next layer.  Glad I left that little bit off.  I added almost double the amount of rice crispy called for and I liked the added crunch.  My co-workers made this disappear quickly!

I’ve rated this twice and haven’t completed my review. I messed up the recipe really bad but I took it to the party anyways. Everyone loved it. This definitely earned 5 stars because if a terrible cook like me could mess it up and still get praised, then it has to be a fool proof recipe. Thank you

Yes, I made these! Yum! I usually put the boxed brownie batter in an 8"x 8" pan, but decided this time to go w/the 9" x 13" one.  I'm glad I did becuz of the toppings.  I did add walnuts to the batter & since I didn't have any Rice Cereal to add to the choc/peanut butter topping, I used crushed lightly salted ridged potato chips.  It made enough to share w/other family members & they all wanted this very easy recipe!  Thumbs up all around!!

Served this yesterday to 5 young 25-30 year olds. They said this was the best brownie recipe they'd eaten. I followed other reviewer comments and only cooked marshmallows for 2 minutes. Will definitely make this recipe again, thanks!

Came out great. Made exactly as written.   Don't over bake the marshmallows. Ours was gooey and sweet.

This is very easy to make....and sooooo good! I made these for homecoming at my church. Even with all the desserts that were there, there were only 2 pieces left to bring home. They didn't last long at home either. I melted the chocolate chips and peanut butter in the microwave. Worked great.

this was a hit at our Church snacks. I liked it but I believe the next time I'd make it with milk chocolate instead of semi sweet chocolate.  I know it sounds sweet enough with the brownie and marshmallows but the semi sweet and the peanut butter just took away all the 'sweet'.

They were good, but we didn't like how the marshmallow got hard and chewy. I would make them again without the marshmallow.

A nice, but very rich dessert.  The taste is delicious with these bars, but I had problems spreading the top layer.  The brownies did cut better at room temp rather than from the refrigerator.  When the topping was cold, it tended to crack when being cut.

I cut down the marshmallows the second time I made them as the first batch made me choke on too much gooey center. The third time I'll try marshmallow cream instead. 
Other than that they were great and super sweet, I haven't found anyone who didn't like them yet!
This recipe lends itself to numerous substitutions and additions, like peanuts on top, corn flakes instead of rice cereal, etc.

The marshmallow layer was tough and chewy, not good at all. Next time I will leave the marshmallows out.  The topping was good.
