Four and a half stars. I used homemade vanilla greek frozen yogurt and cut the milk back for a thicker milkshake. This was a little on the sweet side, I think because my banana was really quite ripe. Next time I make this, I will omit the sugar all together. Kids and I enjoyed this very much.

This was very tasty. I made 1 serving instead of 4. I will try it again sometime with the vanilla ice cream, but I wanted to make it even healthier for myself today. I used vanilla flavored dairy free cashew ice cream I made in my Vitamix the day before, unsweetened almond milk for the dairy milk, and a packet of raw Truvia for the granulated sugar. I kept all ingredient amounts exactly the same for 1 serving of the recipe. Also, I only had frozen blueberries and bananas, so that is what I used. My Vitamix blender blends frozen fruit no problem, so I always have a ton on hand. It probably just made a it a little thicker until it melted some. I wish I could have taken a picture, but I drank it too fast! Nice flavor.

This was definitely delicious. I think I'd add a little more milk and you definitely don't need to add the extra sugar.

Irresistible! This is by far one of the best milkshakes I've ever had. Don't add sugar, though. When I made it for the first time I didn't even bother with the sugar. I'm having a feeling that sugar makes the milkshake either extremely sweet, or just makes no difference at all. But other then that, it was awesome, and I suggest it to everyone!

Delicious and very healthy. I used half almond milk and half regular milk. Came out perfect.
