This was very good and extremely easy. I found the pumpkin pie spice too intense so the second time I made it I used half and added a little more sweetener and it was perfect.After i microwavedit I poured the warm mixture over crushed grahm crackers and let it "set" for a few minutes and added a little fat free cool whip on top-- like hot pie!!

This was really easy to make and it turned out very good; the apples balance the richness of the pumpkin nicely. One thing to watch out for is the pumpkin bubbling over the sides of the dish, so I suggest either using a bigger dish or stirring more frequently after about 2 1/2 minutes. You could probably substitute 4 teaspoons of sugar (brown for extra flavor) for the sweetener if you don't have any on hand. Overall, a great snack recipe. I definitely plan on making it again.

This is so easy and fast to make.  Based on the effort it takes to make, the flavor is very good.  I'll be making it again, but may add the brown sugar that others suggested as well as some low fat cool whip or vanilla ice cream.  Thanks for the recipe Rosanne!

Awesome? No. But still a pretty good way to satisfy your sweet tooth while being healthy and using up that leftover pumpkin from the holidays. I'll probably make it again and might add a tsp of brown sugar.

Great simple and sweet recipe!  Easy to make and best to eat when it's warm.  Great on top of ice cream too!

This made an easy, healthy snack/dessert.  My husband was quite skeptical but wound up enjoying it.  I used real sugar instead of the substitute.

Not bad, especially for so few ingredients and work (oh, and calories). However, I will not be making this again.

Great fall dessert. I made a lot more than one serving for a dinner party. I cooked everything on the stove in a pan and then baked it in the oven at 350 for about 15 mins. Sprinkled graham cracker crumbs on top and served with fresh whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. It was definitely a crowd pleaser!

I made this recipe as written the first time.  Spice was too strong for my taste and the final product a bit watery. Second time, I used 1/4 tsp of pumpkin pie spice, left out the water, left the peel on and used honey instead to sweeten. Awesome!  Healthy and tasty, satisfying my cravings for both apple pie and pumpkin pie! Definitely a keeper! Five star for my taste with the alterations. Thanks for the concept Roseann!!

Far too much spice, and beyond  that very little to recommend it. I was trying to find something to do with the leftovers from a pumpkin soup and my wife and I couldn't eat more than a bite. I tried adding evaporated milk and that helped, but not much. I think Mauracookd has the right idea

I am hypoglycemic so I love the fact that it is sugarfree and healthy!!! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I used cinnamon. Other than that , I followed the recipe. Delicious!!! This will definitely be added to my short list of yummy desserts!! Thanks for the recipe!
