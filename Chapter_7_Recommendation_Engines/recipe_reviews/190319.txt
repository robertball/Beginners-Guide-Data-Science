Great taste!  I used 2 cups of black beans that I had cooked from the dry beans.  My whole family liked this!  Next time, I will cut the salt to 1/4 tsp.

I made this exactly as the recipe said. This tasted really good, but it is a bit runny. Perhaps it would be thicker if we didn't add the yogurt?

Fantastic little snack! I just realized I used the last of the Greek Yogurt this am, so I subbed cottage cheese. I used less tahini (I'm still new to it & getting used to it). Just a few shakes of sea salt. Really fresh tasting with the lemon. I really like it, I'd like a little kick so I'm going to add in a bit of Cayenne. Thanks for the recipe!

This was much better than I expected.  I followed the recipe with no yogurt, and after a quick taste test added more lemon juice and salt.  I also added a dash of cumin and chipotle pepper flavor. I used the amount of olive oil to get the texture I  wanted which was pretty creamy.  I served it with tortilla chips, but pita would work great as well as veggies.  Thanks for the recipe!

this was a big at my gathering. Has more of a "mexican flavor" rather than Greek because of the cumin.

I substituted cottage cheese for the yogourt, since I didn't have plain yogourt at home.  I think this may have been a mistake, since the hummus turned out very thick and pasty - my blender had a very difficult time with it and I ended up mashing a lot by hand.  Overall, not a great hummus, but it was a good way to use up some extra black beans I had cooked.

WAY too salty.  Hard to get a feel for the actual taste because the salt overpowered everything.  I may give it one more try without any salt added.

This is fantastic! My new favorite recipe on allrecipes.com. My husband even liked it and he's not a bean fan. I was surprised by the salt issue that some reviewers had but then I realized that I only used it with veggies - not salty chips. I can see reducing the amount of tahini. I may experiment with herbs or salsa or olives. Yummy!

Yummy! If you are vegan, you can easily convert:
(1) use the same amt of soft tofu
(2) skip it and use another Tbsp of oil
(3) use coconut milk yogurt

I really didn't care for this at all.  I love hummus and black beans, just not together, I guess.

I made this with slightly less tahini and with a few tbs of milk instead of yogurt (I didn't have yogurt).  It was GREAT with carrots, cucumbers, and Greek flat bread.  My kids even loved it.  I would recommend this recipe.  Oh, the milk makes it a little runnier, ore like a dip, but the flavor was excellent.

I thought the tahini overpowered everything else. I think it will work well with veggies. Too salty to have with chips or crackers.

This recipe has some crazy reviews!  It's not too salty or too thin.  It was delicious as is!  The person who thought it was too salty probably didn't rinse the beans.  If you don't have greek yogurt, drain the liquid off of your yogurt when you get it and it won't be thin.   Thanks for the great recipe!

We loved this. I hate chickpeas thus regular hummus is terrible. This was great we didn't have yoghurt so we skipped it. Didn't have lemon so substituted lime. We made our own tahini since we had 5 lbs of sesame seeds from our Korean cook adventures.

This is delicious. I'll definitely make it again. I forgot to add the salt, which I think would have been disastrous if I had no-salt-added beans in the cupboard. Rinse your beans well and adjust your salt depending on your can's content. I was worried about the amount of tahini, but it's good. Quite yummy and looked exactly like the picture for me. Thanks for the recipe!
