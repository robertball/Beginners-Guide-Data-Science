The video was very helpful.  I made these using a nearly black plantain with 2T Coconut Oil in a non-stick frypan.  I was using the dish for a dessert so mid-way through cooking I sprinkled on about 1T Brown Sugar and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon.  Near the end of cooking I lightly sprinkled with salt.  The taste was good.  I might fry them a little hotter next time to create a crispier exterior.  

Note:  I would suggest not placing them on a paper towel lined plate as mine stuck to it!  I am always in favor of trying to remove excess oil but will try a way other than a paper towel next time.

Have made these twice now, they are so easy and good. Don't skip the limes and salt. I don't know why that makes such a big difference, but they really increase the deliciousness.

Yum! I love fried plantains and have ever since my dear Cuban friend introduced them to me. We served this with Cuban chicken fricasse. Thanks Chef John!

Thank You, Thank You, and Thanks again, Chef John for sharing this recipe with us. I grew up ( and still do!) eating these for breakfast along with fried eggs - sunny side-up...delish! Chef Wilo Bennett, owner of Pikayo Restaurant in San Juan, Puerto Rico has a video (still available!!) of "piononos" which is the most popular way to use sweet plantains in P.R. So easy to make! Thanks for sharing with the readers one of the best things we offer in Latin America: Our food!

I picked plantains that were about half brown, noticed a flavor difference between slight color differences. Very unique flavor,I used grape seed oil,  and got a mild sweet potato hint.

I love the ones that are close to black. I fry them in a little bit more oil than Chef John. I've never had it with lime or salt. (I use salt on the green plantains) This is great with canned corned beef and rice. Yummmm. So good that I can eat a whole plantain by myself.

First off -- please watch the video!!! 

I am not the most experienced at frying foods, so I decided to read the directions and follow them (literally) without watching the video. Rookie mistake.

Cooking this on high heat for 4-6 mins on each side will burn your plantains. If you watch the video, Chef John suggests using medium-high heat, I'd opt for medium heat. Also, keep an eye on the plantains and don't be afraid to turn them a few times to make sure they cook evenly and don't burn.

Tip: I followed another reviewers advice and added cinnamon while in the skillet (didn't have brown sugar, but will have that next time). Added the salt at the end. Took out the plantains and placed directly on a glass plate.

My husband who was born in Columbia LOVED these made with Chef John's suggestion of serving this with rice and black beans.  (watch the video)  :)
