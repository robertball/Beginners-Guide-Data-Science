If it wasn't for the chili flakes this would be rather bland although it's a good base for adjusting to your taste. I added some chipotle pepper flakes,  which added some smoky flavored heat and some oregano.  Next time I will cut back on the rice noodles to 4 ounces since they  absorbed most of the broth. For a different touch I spiralized the carrots.

This is a good, base soup. I adjusted the veggies with what I had on hand. This idea of spicy was ok with my kids. I added some sambal oelek and Thai chilies to mine. I used rice vermicelli and just soaked them in hot water until soft and added them to the bowls Ladling the soup over them. Thank you for the recipe.
