I scaled the recipe down to use a 1 lb bag of frozen uncooked shrimp. I just cooked it in a skillet on the stove instead of the Dutch oven/bake method. I made the sauce and heated through then added the shrimp and cooked for about 10 minutes until the shrimp was pink. Meanwhile I microwaved a steamer bag of Asian veggies and when the shrimp were done plated the shrimp dumped the veggies into the remaining sauce stirred to coat then served with the shrimp. A quick and easy meal that was delicious! This is the best way I've prepared shrimp to date - hubby couldn't stop raving about it!

This was a yummy recipe and very easy.  I try to review recipes "as written" so those reading reviews will actually get a review of the posted recipe, but in this case I didn't have fresh shrimp.  Instead, I used thawed frozen shrimp. I prepared the sauce and ladled it over the shrimp and placed it into the oven to bake as directed.  The end result was great. I reduced the size of the recipe to "1" which used 1 -lb of shrimp and it fed two easily with salads.  I'll cut back a pinch on the salt next time.

First I would just like to thank Tom for submitting this recipe.  I had been searching for a recipe for barbecued shrimp for months with no luck.  Well, I actually found one recipe but it was for shrimp grilled on a grill covered in bbq sauce.  

Now lets just get right into it.  This recipe is great.  I had 10 different people try some shrimp and they all loved it.  Nobody could find anything wrong with it except for some weak people complaining about how hot(spice wise) it was.  

Another great thing about the recipe is that its very easy to make and doesn't take long at all.  Just follow the simple instructions that were provided and you shouldn't run into one problem.  

The only negative about this recipe is the price.  I didn't have most of the items on the list so I had to go buy them in addition to the jumbo shrimp.  I probably ended up spending $100 on the dinner but it was well worth it.  So if you are looking for some "real" barbecued shrimp, give this recipe a try because it definitely will not disappoint.

I had high hopes for this dish but it was a bust. There was so much butter and oil sauce left over. The lemons made the sauce taste bitter. Why did I need to use 3 different pots/pans? It should be called a scampi and it wasn't a good one at that. I don't get the high marks at all sorry

Well your biggest challenge is reducing this recipe to what you want. I tried this recipe because we loved the barbecued shrimp we got in N.O.L.A. Great basic recipe! What do you like? Garlic? Lemon? Spicey? I reduced this recipe for 1 lb. shrimp as follows: 1/4 C. butter 1/4 C. EVOO 1T. Worces 1 T. pepper 1 lemon sliced 1/2 t. hot pepper sauce 1/2 t. Italian 2 cloves garlic 1/3 t. paprika 1/2 t. salt. and added 1/2 t. Old Bay 1 T. tomato paste. What would I do different? I left the shell on my raw shrimp and cut down the back to remove the vein. Would do this again but make my sauce with 4 cloves minced garlic 1 t. hot sauce 1 t. Old Bay 2 T. tomato SAUCE cook the sauce the night before marinate the cooled sauce with the raw shrimp overnight. Before you cook dump it all together in a pan cook at 450 for 5 min. Stir cook for another 5 min check for doneness bake until just turned pink. Delisioso and messy! But ask yourself what do I like? And as the cooking shows advise taste taste taste as you are cooking the sauce.

I used frozen shrimp and cut it way down to feed just my family. Everybody who has tried it has really liked it. Definitely goes great with Italian bread!

This dish was so easy and so good. I made 1 serving using medium shrimp. I cooked the sauce poured it over the shrimp and put them directly into the oven for about 9 minutes. They were perfect with white rice a veg and of course bread to sop up the sauce. Yum!

What a forgiving recipe! Didn't measure much or use oven & still came out tasty! I let the shrimp cook on the stovetop in the sauce - why bother w/ oven and another dish? Also served w/ corn and potatoes (baked in microwave but don't forget to make slits) - felt like a seafood boil!

Excellent recipe! I used frozen shrimp that had the shell on but had been deveined. The only changes I plan on making the next time I make it is to add more hot sauce for some kick.

My husband was crazy about this and so was I! This had an enormous amount of flavor. You can really cut down on the butter and oil too and still have a delicious dish. I melted a small amount of butter and oil in a deep skillet added the rest of the spices and seasonings and threw in the shrimp and cooked them through. Served with steamed rice and spinach it was a delicious meal and I didn't have to heat up my oven!

I only had 1 pound of shrimp so I scaled down the recipe to 1 serving (which actually served 2 people). I'm not sure why this is called "barbecued" shrimp since you don't bbq them and there is no bbq sauce in the recipe. We kept the shells on so we could peel and eat and then dipped them in a bowl of the sauce that I poured out of the pan after cooking. It was a fun meal. It wasn't very spicy though so next time I would add much more hot sauce.

Oh yeah this is as awesome as everyone says. I only made four pounds of shrimp (shrimp is so expensive!) and halved the recipe. It was divine. Important: I did not cook the shrimp for nearly as long as it says to cook it. It is very easy to overcook shrimp making it rubbery and unenjoyable. I used "31-40's" which are a little smaller. So I cooked for about half the time both on the stovetop and in the oven. They turned out great!

Quite good. Adjusted quantities roughly for 2 pounds of fresh jumbo shrimp. Used fresh oregano from my garden instead of Italian seasoning. Left out the lemon preferring to pass fresh lemons to each guest for squeezing over individual portions. Don't understand what the two Dutch ovens are all about. I just put all the sauce ingredients into a large cast iron pot with a lid cooked the mixture a bit and then added the raw shrimp. Turned them a bit to coat put the lid back on and lowered the heat. Checked a few minutes later and they were perfectly done. I placed a small dish like you might use for drawn butter when serving lobster onto each plate filled with the rich flavorful sauce and offered slices of fresh baguette for dipping. Thanks Tom. Big bang for very little effort.

This was great. I put it in a crock pot instead of the oven because I took it to a picnic and the shrimp fell right out of the tails. One of the best shrimp recipes I have ever tried.

I was looking for a simple recipe for some shrimp I had picked up on sale at the market. This recipe was WONDERFUL! I did cut it down to 3 servings cause I only had 2.5 lbs of shrimp & used some lemon juice because I didn't have a lemon. My husband & 13yo daughter are VERY picky eaters & both LOVED this recipe. Served it over rice w/a side salad. I will be using this one again EVERY time we get a good price on shrimp at the market!!

I'm giving this four stars because my husband loved it but I thought it was way too peppery and garlicky. I woke up in the middle of the night tasting these spices and yes I did brush my teeth before going to bed. It's similar to a recipe I found in a coveted cajun recipe book but that recipe does not call for so much pepper or garlic and it's much tastier IMO.

No it's not the most health conscious meal ever but most true cajun dishes aren't! Live a little! Eat it! It's good! If you can get some real french bread to soak up the sauce. My only suggestions for a change are to leave the shrimp unpeeled make the sauce in your pot dump it over raw shrimp in your pan mix it all up and bake it. No need to cook the shrimp twice. Overcooked shrimp get rubbery.

7/27/2010: SO GOOD!!! Made it with EZ peel shrimp for dinner one night last week and am making it again tonight. Make sure you have some bread to soak up that yummy sauce! Had to use and vinegar cuz I didn't have lemons. Update 1/3/2011: I have made this at least once a month since I found the recipe using lemons limes or vinegar and it is STILL one of my favorite dishes!! I think I'll make it again this weekend:)

Wonderful! In haste cooked as others had with shells on. The sauce is just too good; must get that straight onto the meat next time! Got interrupted and simmered the sauce too long - lemons got a tad bitter. Note to self - this recipe is too good to mess with - stay on track!!!

I must be missing something here the term barbecue in my mind means cooking over coals. This is an ok recipe seasoning wise but I cut the fats and substituted some white wine and added some cream to the sauce at the end. It realy is more of a scampi type dish the way it is cooked and is good over pasta. Might be more accurate to rename the dish.

We have tried this twice now. The first time was completely by the recipe with the shrimp served on toothpicks and it was phenomenal! Tonight we halved the recipe. I decided to go to a 3:1 ratio of butter to olive oil because otherwise I would have been left with an uncomfortably low amount of olive oil. I figured butter's great with shrimp anyway. Then we had only half the amount of Worcestershire sauce on hand (didn't realize I was low!) so I rounded up some soy sauce packets (thank you Panda Express!) and emptied them into the pot along with some onion powder and extra garlic. We cut out the salt because the butter Tabasco Worcestershire and soy sauce already have salt and my mom cannot eat much salt. I used some medium shrimp that I'd gotten on sale. To minimize dishes I dispensed with the saucepan-to-dutch-oven-to-baking-pan thing. I have a 14" wide frying skillet that is oven safe. So we made the sauce in the skillet then added the shrimp brought it to a bubble then put it in the oven. When I went to stir it after 4 minutes it was already slightly overdone. Ah well. I did use medium shrimp instead of large so I will watch more closely next time. We put the shrimp and sauce over spaghetti and served it with a salad and toasted buttered French bread. Absolutely fabulous! I will keep going back to this recipe!

Traditional Louisiana BBQ Shrimp... YUM!!! To the naysayers out there "Barbecue Shrimp" in NOLA does NOT use "Barbecue" in the same sense as most recipes namely to indicated grilled or smoked meats (FWIW I'm not sure why and my websearch skills haven't shed light on the mystery). This dish is much closer to what is served elsewhere as "Shrimp Scampi". Just remember these are not grilled shrimp and aren't particularly healthy but as a special occasion dish oh yeah!!!

I don't know what I did wrong but my sauce turned out black oily and bitter. I discarded it and made my own sauce with some red wine vinegar hot sauce spices and a touch of bottled barbecue sauce. Turned out fine but this recipe seems ridiculous with using so many different pots and 2 cooking methods.

This was a very good recipe. All the flavors went together very well to compliment the shrimp. I never measure anything I just go by taste and this came out great. I just made the sauce on the stove then I put everything in a baking dish and put it in the oven it took about 20 minutes. I made sure to stir the dish about every 5 minutes to make sure the shrimp cooked evenly in the sauce. I used frozen shrimp with the shell on. My daughter and husband really liked these. I will be making this again! It makes for an easy weeknight meal when paired with a salad we also had stuffed mushrooms.

Very good flavor. I cooked the shrimp much less time than the recipe called for and cut the recipe smaller for less shrimp. We served them with rice and my husband had seconds.

As the recipe is it's delicious but not enough heat for my tastes so I added a good hard shake of ground cayenne pepper...and it made my nose run. LOL. I also cut down this recipe to make 4 servings 1 for him 3 for me.:) I tried another reviewer's suggestion and served over rice and added a green salad.

Restaurant worthy recipe here folks!! And for God's sake DON'T think you put these on the grill or burn the butter brown and blame the recipe. This LA dish IS what it IS. Just make it and have faith! I made this recipe tonight as written but cut it in half for our smaller serving size. My family LOVED it. Very authentic NOLA style BBQ shrimp. I'll def make it again but I will change a few things....And this is totally nitpicking bc we loved it. 1. Use half the amount of lemons called for. The lemon used was a tad much for our taste. 2. Add a little more hot sauce. I'm pretty wimpy when it comes to hot sauce and this dish SHOULD make your lips tingle a little when you're done....Just a smidge more would have accomplished that. 3. Serve the shrimp and sauce on top of/or just next to crusty toasted buttered bread like they do in NOLA. It sops up the sauce!...And believe me you'll want to eat ALL the sauce! This dish is AMAZING!

This has a bit too much Worcestershire sauce for our taste so I'll cut down on that next time and perhaps add some fresh parsley. Also trying to size the recipe was tough given that the baseline is for 8 pounds of shrimp!

This was a good recipe. Much quicker than the one I was using from Emeril. The only thing I will do different is only cook the shrimp in the oven and not on the stove too. Shrimp cooks too fast and came out overcooked for me.

I loved this!!! The sauce is amazing. Used only one pound of shrimp and scaled the rest of the ingredients accordingly was plenty to feed two plus leftovers. Served with wild rice broccoli and texas toast. Sauce is soooo good.

A good sloppy mess. I added 1-2 TBSP of tomato paste for a thicker sauce. GREAT!

Excellent recipe! We also left the shells on the shrimp and I added a bit more hot sauce to suit our taste. A definite keeper. Thanks so much for posting this!

I fourthed this recipe because I only had a couple of pounds of shrimp. I also left the shells on as I had seen done at area restaurants. Delicious! I took it to a party as an appetizer.

This was delicious! I did think though this had a bit too much black pepper in it. I had Allrecipes scale the recipe down to 1 serving since I only had a pound of shrimp on hand and they gave me the conversion of 1T plus 1-1/2tsp pepper. I am thinking maybe 1T would be enough???? The only changes I made when making this was I just used the juice of the fresh lemons rather than using the whole slices. I also took one reviewer advice and added about a teaspoon or so of tomato paste to enhance the flavor. I cooked it slightly less than what it called for since my shrimp was medium size served it over rice and my family gobbled it up! Thanks for a great recipe!

Have cooked this dish for years but without olive oil and Italian seasoning. Either version is absolutely delish! Tastes much like the signature dish of one of NOLA's best restaurants.

Good dish. Tasted more a scampi but then again I never tasted barbecued shrimp before. I served over dirty rice with fresh french bread from my hubsand's bakery.

Cut the recipe down for 1lb frozen bag of shrimp. 1/4 cup Worcestershire 1 lemon 3 garlic cloves and everything else just added to flavor as we like it (not very spicy people!). I definitely cut down on the oil and butter too. Peeled the shrimp and allowed to marinate for 1.5 hours and cooked on the stove. Served with fettucini and salad. I really liked the flavor but it was too lemony for my husband. Quick and easy will do again (next time with less lemon)!

Very disappointing. I reduced it to two servings but there was way too much Worcestershire sauce. I really had to work hard to salvage this into something edible.

OMG!!! WOW this was good! I scaled down the servings to 2 and only cooked it with a pound of shrimp there was a lot of sauce left over. I just don't know if I'd call it BBQ shrimp more like spicy shrimp maybe? But if you like spicy this was excellent. The tangy lemon flavor really was evident amidst the spices... this was sooo yummy.

I tried this recipe with only a few shrimp left in my fridge. It was scaled down to two servings and it tasted great. Very easy and my husband loved it too!

this was really great! I added extra hot sauce and cayenne pepper. I scaled it down for 2 pounds of frozen peel on shrimp. I made cocktail sauce from ina garten's recipe.

Excellent! I wanted mine to be more a New Orleans taste so I used Tony's more spice as my salt. I did not use italian seasoning. Next time I will add quite a bit more hot sauce. REALLY REALLY good...

If you're looking for a shrimp recipe stop searching now. I don't eat shellfish. I don't like the taste or texture. I've never cooked it before this. Due to those reasons my fiance forbid me from making seafood dishes. I didn't measure with this recipe. I only chose it because I already had most of the ingredients. I used 1 lb of frozen shrimp that I partially thawed and edited the recipe for 2 servings. I may have marinated for about 30 min. I let the ingredients cook for about 10 min and come to a slight boil then reduced to a simmer and added the shrimp and cooked for another 10-15 min turning once. My family LOVED it!! They said it was juicy flavorful and delicious. They were mad I didn't make more and can't wait for me to make shrimp again!

YUM! Said the family. Here is my story....my range broke so we had a new one delivered but the electrical parts were different. We had to wait for an electrician btw the holidays. So we had to figure out how to make this with what we had. I microwaved the sauce and shrimp before finishing in the toaster oven. It was still delicious. I did this for 1.67 lbs of shrimp. I highly recommend this!
