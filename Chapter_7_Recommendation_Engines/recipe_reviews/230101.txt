The sauce is very thick and lacked flavor.  I cooked the roux well and made it according to the recipe - tasted, added more salt and pepper, tasted added some nutmeg and that helped but over all this is a really heavy sauce for Angel Hair Pasta. (Could use chicken or veggie broth instead of all milk and a sturdier pasta)  I really liked the sauteed mushrooms but did not care for the cooked red pepper, the flavor of the cooked pepper over shadowed the mushrooms - I think we would have liked the pepper raw, more as a garnish.  This has potential but as written isn't a keeper for us.

The sauce had too much flower! It became a a sticky dough. Next time I will add more milk and less flower. The taste of the sauce was also bland, I had to add more salt and garlic to get it to taste decent. But, overall I really liked the recipe. Its flavor was amazing!

I added extra mushrooms to the recipe. It could have used more salt, but that can be added at the table. It was kind of hard to toss the pasta with the sauce, as the sauce was thick and cheesy, but if I had broke the pasta in half, that would have helped.

Tired out delicious! I used less flour and a little more milk until I got a consistency I wanted. Added smoked paprika, pepper and basil to taste and less cheese.

I hope you're reading this if you're about to make this! Too. Much. Flour! Other reviewers agree, and I wish I'd seen that warning before I made this. It was salvageable though-- you must add more milk. Not sure how much as I was just frantically trying to save it. You also need more seasoning (salt, pepper, nutmeg) and more cheese. In the end it tasted good with the changes. I also sprinkled roasted pumpkin seeds on top and that made a tasty addition!
