I made these for a cinco de mayo party.  The kids really loved them.  Use unsalted butter and be careful not to use to much flour.

Easy and Cute!! They are delicious too! I guess it is the butter and egg yolks. Make sure you don't overcook.

Mencanto esta receta! They were sooooooo yummy!! I didnt have sprinkles so I used my food processor and used candy instead. It was really good! I even made ones that were red for Valentines day to give them more color. They reminded me of the cookies my abuelita used to make and I cant wait to be able to make them for her. Thank you for putting this recipe up.Me hizo recordar los dias que pasaba haciendo galletas con mi abuelita. Thanks again!!!!!!!!Oh I did add a little bit more vanilla though.

A delicious rich cookie, not too sweet.  Be sure to chill the dough for easy handling.

An excellent tasting simple cookie recipe.  I read prior reviews and wonder if those that had "sticky" dough used the entire egg and not just the yolk.  My dough turned out perfectly and was easy to manage.  I also found it was easiest instead of using your thumb, form the dough into a 1-inch ball, flatten down slightly with palm of hand and insert something round such as a rounded end of a plastic spoon, to make the hole in the center.  Sprinkled with multi-colored bead candies, these cookies were so cute and good!

I needed to make for my daughter's spanish class.  No troubles, instead of rolling balls and using a spoon, I rolled it lengthwise and formed a circle, worked great and kept the center open.

These tasted pretty well.  It just didn't have that much flavor.  I would recommend more vanilla and about a fourth of a cup more flour because the dough was too sticky to work with.

Very easy, and yummy too.  It will help to refrigerate the dough for about a hour then work it. I found that the ring shape will keep better, if you do it that way.

These cookies were yummy! They are very tender and buttery. I used the end of a wooden spoon to help give them an even ring shape. I didn't have any jimmies, so I used tiny dolphin-shaped sprinkles. Everyone enjoyed them and I will make them again!

These are pretty good cookies, not too sweet so it's easy to eat more than you should.  My rings didn't turn out to pretty, but got better as I went.  I used the end of a wooden spoon to start my ring so they'd be even then finished it off using my thumb.  I dipped them in Rainbow Jimmies.

These tasted good. Not outa this world, but good. Kids seemed to enjoy them more though. They were really hard to work with and for some reason, my batter was too crumbly to be able to form the rings without them falling apart. I ended up making them into balls instead. Good original looking shortbread cookie. Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is terrific.  They are simple to make and turn out perfectly.  They have a very nice vanilla and butter taste.  I made NO CHANGES to this recipe.  I thought they were very pretty too with the colors of the Mexican flag.  Great addition to our Cinco de Mayo celebration.  Thanks for the recipe Glenda.

These cookies are really good and so cute.  I pressed the rings into rainbow sprinkles so they would be colorful.  The dough was easy to work with and I just pushed my finger through to make the holes.  I'll make these into little wreaths at Christmas.

Wonderfully easy cookie! Dough turned out perfectly; easy to shape into rings with a chopstick. I wonder if the people having trouble with the dough texture are using real butter as the recipe calls for? Margarine (especially diet margarines) can change the texture of cookies dramatically.

Good plain cookie, but I think bake temp might be a little too high, they scorched VERY easily. I'll try again cooking at 325 for 10 full minutes instead of 375 and having to take them out after 9 minutes because the edges were burning.

I was impressed with this recipe...Very similar to a sugar cookie but i could tell that there was a difference. They are definately best eaten fresh. They were much drier the next day.

Wow these cookies rock! My friend and I were bored, so we decided to make these, and we both loved them. My family liked them a lot too! I don't understand how they're Mexican, but they'd be great for Spanish class...yummy & fast. Also, I had all the recipes on hand, which was great!

Decent.  Hard to make them look nice because the rings want to cook into each other in the center.

I gave this recipe a 5 star since my husband and child both said it was good.  A good thick sugar cookie.  We are having a fiesta night at school where my husband and I are on the PTA Executive committee so I am constantly baking or cooking something to persuade more parents to join PTA :)

I loved this recipe!  I doubled it for a party and it made a ton.  I ran out of vanilla and used almond, but only had enough for one teaspoon and it was still great.  I used the end of a fondue stick to poke the holes, that worked really well.  I thought the dough was perfect to work with and it was quick and simple.  They were delicious and a huge hit at the party!  Thanks!

I liked this recipe, mostly because it was easy to make and used basic ingrediants. It tasted kind of plain, though. I had troubles making the dough into balls, because the dough kept sticking and I ended up adding more flour. It was basically impossible for me to put a hole in the center, so i just made them into mini cookies. They basically taste like a plain sugar cookie.

I made these cookies for the first time for Christmas.  They were indeed very quick and easy and so pretty.  Tasty too.  I immediately made two more batches.  The sprinkles can be substituted for icing if you want to make these look like little Christmas wreathes.

I loved the taste of this cookie and so did my children. I just found it hard to shape the rings of the cookie without them cracking, but I will try again!

I used this recipe for my Spanish class and they turned out great! I'm not very good at making cookies, but these were so easy to make I couldnt believe I was able to make them! They look great and I sure hope my class thinks they taste great:)

These are a nice change of pace cookie.  I'd never eaten a cookie like this before and stumbled across this recipe in the bowels of my recipe box and decided to give it a whirl.  I'm glad I did; these have a nice buttery vanilla-y taste w/a nice crunch from the  sprinkles.  The only change I made was to sub sea salt for salt, as I like a little salty w/my sweet.  THANKS, Glenda!

Quick, easy recipe. Refrigerating the dough help immensely with the "stickiness".  Make sure to stretch out the hole, otherwise it closes back up during baking.

These cookies are super delicious. I followed the recipe almost exactly. The reason I give the recipe 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the cookies came out really sticky so I couldn't make them into circles. They were yummy, though, and I used a chocolate frosting which was perfect. They're not too sweet and are light and cakey. In an apartment of four girls, these won't make it to tomorrow.

I made these for Cinco de Mayo for my son to take to school.  Very easy and truly tastes like a bland sugar cookie.  Thats not a bad thing..but make sure to add the "jimmies" for a little more flavor.  I might even add a titch more vanilla.
Also, I punched holes in the cookie and the cookies puffed up and the whole disappeared.  The next batch I made them like a donut..a really big whole..and they STILL closed up.  Don't know why?!

Adjusting the recipe for 96 & followed directions.  Very buttery and tasty.  Chilling in fridge helped.  Do NOT overcook.  Tried with & w/o the hole, and the hole really helps the cookie cook more evenly.  They do not spread much which is nice to load up the pan (although, if you over bake them, then you've screwed up more).  I'm not sure what makes them Mexican, but they were well received.

Excellent tasting and easy-to-make! The only problem I had was trying to figure out the best way to shape the dough so the cookies turned out pretty after baking. Tried several different ways, and none turned out like I expected. If anyone has the solution to ending up with circular cookies that actually have a hole in the center, please let me know. It would be great if someone who has mastered this recipe could take a pic of the cookies on the sheet just before baking, that would be very helpful. Thanks!

I had to add a bit more flour to make it easier to roll. My holes filled in. This time I had chocolate sprinkles. Next time I will add more extract.

These cookies are great!  Tender, buttery, and not too sweet.  I used Mexican vanilla, which I think helped.  Also, I didn't feel like getting out the mixer, so instead of creaming the butter and sugar, I just melted the butter and stirred the sugar into it.  I also added a tiny bit of cinnamon.  They turned out great.  I will make these again.

These were a huge hit at the office.  I have taken up baking as a hobby and to decrease my risk of sugar comas, I take these to the office.  I didn't even have time to put a card with the description and ingredients and they were GONE!

I really enjoy the Mexican cookies with less sugar.  I added "Red Hot" sprinkles to some and they were really spicey!

My toddlers thought these were great. I was expecting a little more buttery flavor but they were a nice soft cookie. With a little sweetness on top they would be excellent. I always have a bunch of egg yolks left over and this will be my go to recipe to get rid of them. I will make larger cookies next time, slightly flatten them and then add a bit of fluffy frosting when they are cool. Thank you for the recipe.

I just took these out of the oven!  I was a little worried because the dough was difficult to work with (very crumbly), but they taste great.  I made balls, and they aren't exceptionally pretty, but the taste definitely makes up for that.

I was looking for a way to use up excess egg yolks and these were nice. I didn't shape them into rings, just into little balls. I also didn't use the sprinkles as we're out. I used almond extract instead of vanilla, and the flavor was excellent! I DID replace the butter with margarine, but, although they probably do taste better with butter, they still tasted great. Thanks, Glenda, my daughter couldn't get enough of these. :)

I needed a recipe to use up some egg yolks (My husband is trying to lose weight and is eating three egg whites every morning!). Since the rest of the family is not on a diet, I decided to give these cookies a try.  I'm glad I did!  They are tender, rich and delicious!  I didn't bother trying to make the rings.  I just shaped balls, then used a fork to flatten them some.  I used sprinkles on some, which my toddlers loved.  We had some leftover praline pecans someone gave us over the holidays, and I put one in the center of some of the cookies before baking.  That was a yummy treat too!  You'll like this recipe, it's easy, versatile and delicious!

Tasty and simple to prepare. I had to make these at the last minute for my daughter's Spanish class fiesta held on Valentine's Day. They went over very well. I don't know if it is really necessary to make them into rings. Just a good sugar cookie recipe. My son enjoyed them as well and kept going back to sneak more. Added more vanilla.

I am sorry but this recipe was not that great at all.Don't get me wrong the dough taste good it was more like a sugar cookie I think nothing really to rave about.The dough was a little sticky but I was able to form a ball with them instead of the ring thing.It was to sticky to even do that,I think you need to cook them a little longer because the middle was a little uncooked but other then that it did have a good taste to it.I am a cookie maker and I know when a recipe does not turn out that great if the dough is not easy to handle.I make them all the time and bread I make all the time.But thank you Glenda it nice of you to share this recipe with all of us but I will be making this again just for a sugar taste cookie for coffee thanks.

My dad absolutely loved these. They are a cross between a butter cookie and a sugar cookie. They are a good, dependable cookie. They are basic enough that pretty much everyone will like them. Made them for Spanish club and everyone took one with a few leftovers that my dad finished off easily enough ;) The only problem I had was forming them into rings- it was easy to make them into balls, but you have to squish them around once they're in balls to get them a bit more elastic before pushing your thumb in and forming the ring around it.

My daughter made these for Cinco de Mayo last year.  Her classmates (and everyone) enjoyed them. They are simple, yet good. She used colored sugar sprinkles for a touch of sweetness and color on the top. Her friends were impressed and it was an easy recipe to make and share with the class.

A good tasting cookie but very much like a sugar cookie.  I was looking for something with a different taste.  Anything with sprinkles on it is OK in my book!

Dough was really dry.  I added 2tbs butter and another egg yolk.  They turned out great with those changes.

This was an amazing recipe. Easy and quick to make and didn't take a lot of ingredients which is great for my family.  Very tasty but not to sweet, completely hits the spot, which can be hard to do with us pregnant women.

This recipe is good but I substituted the multicolored sprinkles by marmalade of strawberry and marmalade of pineapple.  Very delicious!

Okay, I thought this recipe sounded really easy and fun, so I decided to make them. My problem was that they were too sticky to roll up and then make a hole. I had to add a bunch of flour and then it was still kind of difficult. However, I think maybe I didn't beat the mixture long enough, so I think it was my fault. But still they were pretty good and I liked them. I think the first bite is a little bland but after the second bite they taste buttery and good. My sisters didn't really like them that much, but that's because they're addicted to sugar. :)

i have made this recipe previously and it came out great. however i recently moved to the mtns, followed recipe exactly as before. dough came out extremely crumbly. added a bit of the eggs white so it had a cookie consistancy, was still flaky. baked at 375 for 12 minutes checked at 10 somewhere between 10 and 12 they burnt. i know stuff bakes differently at a higher elevation of anyone has a pointers I'd love the feedback. meanwhile I'll keep trying to tweak it.

They were amazing! I had to make them for my Spanish class, and I baked them, cut out holes with a piping tip, and then I drizzled vanilla icing over them. Lastly, I added different Christmas sprinkles. They’re beautiful! And not to mention a new class favorite;)
