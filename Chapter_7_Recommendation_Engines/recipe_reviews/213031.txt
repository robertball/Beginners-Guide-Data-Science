I added more and different kinds of bean, i.e chick peas. Great tasting and it lasted for days.

Great variation on beans on rice.  I had 1/2 a can of coconut milk and cabbage to use up which is how I found this recipe.  I'm only one person who is trying to eat more meatless meals, so I made a half recipe (my 1/2 can of coconut milk remember) except I left out the scotch bonnet  pepper, the chicken and used the whole can of black-eyed peas for a 1/2 recipe.  The coconut milk added that little something extra and the cabbage was  just a hint.  If you also swapped out chicken broth for veggie broth this would make a yummy vegan dinner.

A good starter recipe for cookup rice.  However, following the recipe I made few changes to my version.   I used beef, bacon, blackeye peas and red kidney beans and instead of using cabbage, I used fresh whole Okra  and instead of using chicken broth I used 2 beef boulillon and 4 cups of water and I also added 1 tbsp mushroom soy sauce.

I did not have scotch bonnet peppers so I used some cayenne instead. I also substituted the black eyed peas with red kidney beans. I also used kale in lieu of cabbage. Hey I really wanted to try this recipe.  Turned out great!!

This recipe came out very good. My family raved over it and told me to "save the recipe" so I can make it again. I made it without the chicken or cabbage (served carribean chicken and the cabbage on the side)otherwise followed everything else exactly as stated and the flavor was wonderful. Thanks for posting Tatiana.

It's okay, but the cabbage sort of makes it bland. I don't use the cabbage anymore.

Two words: comfort food. It's rich and hearty and will definitely make you want to curl up on the couch with a bowl of it. Really subtly flavorful and satisfying. I'll definitely be making this one again.
