Very sweet, but very good.  I took the advice and pureed the strawberries and it turned out awesome.  It's a keeper!

This pie has a great flavor, but I experienced the problem that some other reviewers had with getting the pie to set up.  If you leave the pie in the fridge, it keeps the consistency of the cool whip - not condusive to slicing.  If you slice it straight out of the freezer, the consistency is much better, but you have all these frozen strawberry chunks - not condusive to chewing.  I will make this pie again because it is really tasty, but I will either puree the berries or leave them out all together.  The mixer (I used bacardi) has such great flavor that the pie doesn't really need the berries sad to say.

I made this using low-fat sweetened condensed milk and light Cool Whip. I used one 9" springform pan. Served it to my healthy-heart conscious brother-in-law and sister-in-law. We all loved it! Very creamy!

This recipe is perfect in a 9-in springform. Since I don't like desserts that are too sweet, and since several reveiwers thought it was, I decided to substitute the whipped topping for real whipped cream (unsweetened and stabilized with gelatin). The Bacardi mixer I used and the condensed milk provided plenty of sugar! My mom likes her desserts pretty sweet, and she even thought it was great this way. I sliced fresh strawberries thinly, and used more than the recipe said. I took it to an event and everyone was CRAZY about it! Very refreshing and cool for the summer!

I put one of these pies in the fridge, and one in the freezer. The one in the fridge did not set up at all. It was like a smoothie. The one I froze was good, and we ate it right out of the freezer, almost like a strawberry ice cream pie. I would not suggest putting it in the fridge.

A tasty pie for summer.  I forgot the frozen strawberries and substituted whipped cream for the whipped topping as suggested by another reviewer.  I serve it straight from the freezer.

Loved this! This was extremely simple to prepare. I put it in the refrigerator to harden up and should have just gone ahead and placed in the freezer. Topped the pies with canned whipped cream and a decorative strawberry in the center (find a large one and cut into the strawberry from the bottom up but not all the way through, then "fan" the slices. Kids loved this as well.

This was a very tasty pie, and super simple to make.  Great summer dessert.  (I made it on the 4th of July, I'm a little behind on my reviews...LOL!)  The only thing I would do differently next time, is I would slice the strawberries while they were still partially frozen.  I would have preferred smaller pieces of frozen strawberry in the finished pie.  Otherwise, it was a hit, and when the weather warms up a bit, I'm sure I'll make it again.

I took this to a church dinner.  Not a bite was left! They stood over it with forks.  It is requested when I go, and I have printed out the recipe for family and passed it on.
Thanks,  Beth Persinger

Really easy to make.  Make sure you use the frozen daiquri mix i accidently bought the bottled mix and it did not set well. Going to try and make it again with the frozen mix. Hope it turns out better.
Well tried the frozen mix instead and placed it in the freezer but still had problems. It set well but the strawberries were frozen and after setting on the counter for 5 minutes it became funny. the flavor was awesome. I think the daiquir mix is the problem because I noticed the mix itself never would freeze on its own.

Very easy, and yes, very sweet. I sampled the mixture before putting it in the pie crusts and was not very excited about how sweet it was. I was much happier with the taste once I added the juice of nearly an entire medium-sized lime (after cutting a couple thin slices out of the middle to save for garnish). That made it just about perfect! I used fresh strawberries although frozen would have been just fine. I definitely agree with other reviewers that the best option is to puree or very finely chop the berries, then put the pies in the freezer. I would have loved having big chunks of berry to bite into, but not if they're frozen, and the freezer's the only way to keep this pie firm. My dinner guests loved it, even my non-dessert eaters, and my husband was delighted. This is a keeper.

A very easy recipe.  Pie was good but needed more strawberries.  Needed the freezer to firm up.  Made it for Thanksgiving and most people like it.

this recipe was simple to make but the only was to get to to set up so i could slice it, was to freeze it and slice it frozen.  it had a nice flavor but i wasn't into the frozen part. i garnished it with several slices of lime  and some strawberries.
