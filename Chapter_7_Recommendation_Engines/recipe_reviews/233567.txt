Delicious with crushed Heath bars!  I mixed everything together but saved the caramel sauce to drizzle on top.  I also added 1/4 cup of granulated sugar, but I recommend tasting it before doing so in case it's already sweet enough.  A similar recipe called for 1 tsp of vanilla, which I'll have to try next time.  I served this dip with Pink Lady apples and it was a huge hit!  Thanks for sharing this amazing recipe!

This is sooo good.  Easy and delicious.  Only change I made was to use whipped cream cheese.  I like the lighter texture.

This did not go over well with me or my guests.  I cut way back on the sugar (about half what was called for), and, still, it was very sweet to my taste.  I think my impression was further  impacted by the caramel I used, which was store-bought.  I will not use that again, as I have made my own caramel in the past, which was far superior.

I doubled up cream cheese and left everything as is (cream cheese mixture reminded me of panera bread bagel spread).  It was delicious! Will definitely make again.

Second time I made it with less brown sugar and less caramel sauce and it was not as sweet (for adults) but still excellent.

I made it for my family and they all liked it. we didn't have the full amount of caramel sauce and it still tasted ok. Also, we didn't have the toffee bits, but it was still fantastic!! I am sure we will make it again!!! It takes way more apples than the recipe calls for though.

Made it for a family picnic and it was a crowd pleaser. I doubled the recipe and served it with apples and graham crackers. People were eating by the spoonful. Fantastic, easy and quick to make.
