Loved this! I looked at the ingredients of this salad and my mouth started watering. It's great for the holidays because grapefruit is so delicious this time of year. To avoid the bitterness of the pith and membrane, I just cut the grapefruit in half and scoop out the flesh. If you don't like grapefruit, this is also good with craisins. I do like something a little crunchy in my salads, so I added some cashews.  I used the "Poppy Seed Dressing I" recipe from this site.

Would like to see a homemade dressing.  I'm not a fan of bottled dressings.

I used the fresh, peeled grapefruit in plastic packaged container found in produce section where grocers put fresh veggie and fruit trays and packages...worked out great!  I substituted swiss cheese for feta...loved it!  I used half of the green onions recipe called for and it was perfect...

The grapefruit skins give it a bitter taste in each bite. This hasn't worked out for us at all.

Made thsi for Easter and have made it several times since...not just a holiday salad!  Everyone loves it and asks for recipe.  Good tip from other member is to section the grapefruit and sponge with paper towel to avoid too much moisture

The key to the success of this is to remove all of the white membrane from the grapefruit before using it because it does have a bitter taste.

With a fresh shipment of grapefruit sent from Florida, I went on a search for some recipe to use them.  This is a wonderful salad choice.  I made 'Healthier Poppy Seed Salad Dressing for 2' from AR.  My favorite ingredients were the combination of the grapefruit and avocado.  Kind of tangy meets smooth, and it worked.  My dressing choice was good, but the vinegar overpowered just a little.  Definitely a salad worth repeating.

I loved all of the different colors and textures this salad had going on. It was however my first time to try poppy seed salad dressing and I am not a fan but that sure isn't the recipes fault. The presentation of the salad is fit for special company and I will most definitely make this again as written for others and then just find a different dressing that suits my taste.

I was wandering my allrecipes page and just realized (nearly 7 years after posting) that this had so many reviews! Thanks to all of you for reviewing; glad to hear there are so many who love it as much as we do! For those who have struggled with how I worded the prep for the grapefruit, I have tried to edit this recipe to no avail. What I would like to suggest (as other cooks have) is that one needs to scoop out the sections of grapefruit as you would if you were normally eating a grapefruit half. I.e., separate the fruit from the membrane with a grapefruit knife and remove it from the rind. When I ate this for the first time, my friend who prepared it said she used the stuff out of the jar, which obviously does not have any membrane or white pith. I guess this just seemed obvious to me as that membrane is so tough and the white pith of the rind is terribly bitter. (Who eats *that* part??)  I guess I just thought "peeled" covered that, but I can see where that might be confusing if you were thinking of it like peeling an orange. And by all means, use a homemade dressing! That's an easy substitution, but maybe a bit more time--which is always stretched thin during the holidays. ;-)

Simple and exceptional!  Took to a gathering of incredible cooks.  It wowed!  I used butter lettuce and eliminated the onion since one person was allergic to it.  I used a fine grater for the cheese which helped it float throughout the salad rather than sinking to the bottom.  Used the recommended Marieâ€™s poppyseed dressing.  It was the hit of the party.

I made this scaled down for my husband & me - forgot to use the green onions  ( which would have added to the recipe nicely!) I thought it was a good & tasty salad.  I like the other reviewer's suggestion of using Feta  instead of Swiss; and I would also like to try with chopped walnuts.

I made it as per the recipe.It was good, but I received comments that it would have been better with peach slices.  I may try that next time.

Made this salad for a gourmet club dinner. I used refrigerated bottled grapefruit and only 1 bunch of green onions. Will make again, using 1/2 bunch of green onions and and maybe 6 oz of dressing. If there is any left over, don't try to save it.

I was the only person in the household to eat this, everyone else didn't like it at all.
