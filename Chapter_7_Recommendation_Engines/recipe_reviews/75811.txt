Wow, so happy to see all of the positive reviews. My mom says thanks everyone. Just a note. The recipe that I submitted says to use PARSLEY, with a small note at the bottom that cilantro may be substituted. I guess Allrecipes figures Latin food must use cilantro. Parsley has much better flavor, and many people don't like cilantro. Parsley is used much more in Brazil than cilantro.

Great to see that everyone is altering the recipe to suit their own taste. I love how you can use whatever you want in this recipe; as long as you know the technique, you're all set to experiment. 

If you liked this recipe, try the same method with chicken as well. Thanks again!

Oh my, these were wonderful.  I've never tried this cooking technique before and just thought I would give it a try.  To be quite frank, I wasn't expecting much.  But they were just too good.  Ate way more than one portion.  I did use boneless country style pork loin ribs to lower the saturated fat and used 2 Tbsp minced garlic.  Also needed 50 minutes to cook dry even though I was very careful not to overdo the water.  Thanks for sharing this.  Can't wait to do this again.

Yummy!! This was a hit at my house. I used 2 lbs. of bone-in country style pork ribs and just cut the recipie exactly in half. It was perfect. If the water takes too long to boil down turn the heat up.

This recipe was a huge hit, even with my terribly fussy husband and teenaged daughter.  We love barbecuing ribs in the summer, and this recipe is a close second and an easy way to cook ribs during the off-season.  I changed the recipe in that I did not use cilantro.  Also, I didn't bother cooking the water away...just boiled the ribs for 25 mins. in all those great ingredients, tgeb brushed them with our favorite bottled bbq sauce (Diane's) and then baked them for 10-15 minutes in a 325 degree oven, turning them and brushing them with more sauce half-way through.  Fantastic!

Very good.  Made them twice in a week.  Having never boiled ribs I found out what others did, that a big pile of ribs (I at least doubled the qty) in a big pot will take hours to boil the water away.  Seemed like overcooking so I had to pour off and the first time the ribs were not browned.  2nd time I poured off through a strainer to keep the good bits and browned the ribs.  Way good!  Yes they seemed salty the first time.  Just adjust to taste.  The real kicker to this recipe is the cilantro and lime.  Use generously  during and after cooking and the dish's flavor really pops out.  Will be keeping this one around.  Thx

This was great!  I just made it with country style pork ribs.  I was looking for a simple recipe that didn't take all day to cook.  I used lite soy sauce and reduced the amount as suggested and mine are perfectly seasoned, the cilantro makes it I think..  However, it did take almost 2 hours for all the water to evaporate.
Edited:
Use the largest (widest) pan you can find to facilitate the evaporation and cook at just a simmering boil.  You want the longer cooking time to make them tender.  And just as others said, watch it closely when it gets 1/2 because it finishes fast.

This is by far, the best pork rib recipe ever.  It is a MUST-TRY.  I, too, cut down the soy sauce to about 1/4 cup, which was perfect.  The slightly garlicy coating is awesome.  I almost quit cooking it too soon, as just before it browns it makes a great sauce.  I turned it off and tasted some, but turned it back on, and was glad I took it to the final browning stage.  Do try this, you won't be disappointed.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

These are awesome.  Even my veryyy picky boyfriend thought they were a keeper.  I lessened the soy and the water, as other's suggested  but otherwised followed the recipe to a T.  One note though, when it says brown bits it really means brown bottom.  All of a sudden (after 50 minutes or so) there was no water and the bottom of the pan was covered with all the seasonings and I almost burned it.  Very delicious, concentrated brown sauce though.  Just be careful or it could ruin the pan and the ribs.

We had these ribs last nite and were in heaven!  They were very easy to prepare.  I may have put a little too much water because it took an hour for the water to evaporate.  I didn't have cilantro so I substituted parsley, oh.. and used low sodium soy sauce.  An excellent recipe that will definately be served again and again!

I took a tip from the other reviews commenting about the saltiness. I still used regular soy sauce but I only used 1/3 cup. It was still a little stronger than I would have preferred but was still very good. I used country style ribs instead of spare ribs and the water did take longer to boil off but I think the size of the ribs I used also called for more water than in the original recipe. I'll use less water next time. The garlic and cilantro added very good flavor. This recipe is a keeper in our household!

Made this 6 months ago exactly as written, except with low sodium soy sauce.  FANTASTIC!!!  I've made it several times since then as well.  My family LOVES this recipe!  Of note, keep in mind the recipe is for TEN ribs.  If you're making 2 or 3 pounds of ribs, then of course it will take MUCH longer for the water to boil down, as you will need much more water to cover the amount of ribs.  Being a small family, I do the 10 ribs and it has never taken longer than 35-40 minutes for the water to boil down.  You can't go wrong with this recipe.  It's a keeper!!

Omigosh.  SO delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly - it was so wonderfully fragrant and the end result was simply delicious.  My only suggestions would be to decrease the soy measurement by half.  My husband and children who literally NEVER eat meat that is left over FOUGHT the next day over the few ribs that were left!  Darn it, I was looking forward to having them all to myself...  I can really see this technique and this recipe to be easily used for other meats, not just pork ribs.    I know it will become a staple in the regular fare that I whip up at home from now on.

This was definitely different and good.  I used all ingredients listed in addition to fresh cilantro, onion powder (to taste), garlic powder (to taste), white salt (to taste), Lawyrs season salt (to taste), white sugar (to taste), and burnt sugar (appox 2 tbs).  I also only used 1 lime juiced and about 5 sprigs of the fresh parsley.  I filled the Dutch oven with water just above all of the ribs, placed all ingredients in and boiled uncovered for about a total of 1.5 hrs.  After this point I allowed the pot to cool and placed in the refrigerator overnight.  The next day, I skimmed off the solidified fat and removed ribs from the remaining liquid in the pot.  Next I heated up the liquid in and added a butter/flour rue to thicken the sauce.  I then added the ribs back to the pot and warmed for approximately 20 minutes.  Served with white rice and corn.  Delicious.  Will definitely be making this again.

My family floved this recipe!!  I did reduce the soy sauce and I think country style porks ribs do better with this recipe.  I have made it several times and thought I should leave a review on it.

My wife is Brazilian so I thought this would be perfect. I decided to cook exactly as directed. I used a high end 8QT non-stick pot and cut the 12 rib slab into quarters. Use non-stick, as this dish reduces to a sludge that will not make cleanup fun if you use a stainless vessel. I took the ingredient measurements literally and used measuring cups/spoons. The aroma was stunning. As in most of the reviews, it took me exactly one hour to reduce the liquids as directed. BE ALERT! At the 50 minute mark, the liquid reduced very fast so keep a close eye on the pot to avoid scorching.  Also, don't expect ribs prepared in this manner to compare to your slow roasted, grill finished BBQ ribs that are so familiar to us Americans. The meat is a little tougher but still fabulous. So how'd it turn out? Very tasty, but like most of the reviewers say, use less soy sauce than directed (like 1/3 cup)... or use light soy sauce instead. Also, go easy on the oregano. On my effort, it added a bitterness to the ribs that I wasn't expecting.  As written, I rate this recipe a "3". However, this has so much potential it's ridiculous. By adding/reducing ingredients, and altering how the ribs are finished ... oven vs. pan vs. pot ... make this recipe a 4 or 5. I highly recommend you try this as written (except reduce the amount of soy sauce) and customize from there. Previous posters have some great suggestions. Despite my complains, there wasn't a morsel of meat left between my wife and I.

I've simmered ribs for decades, usually leading to grilling with BBQ sauce so I was a bit puzzled when the contributor of this recipe stated that the water would evaporate...in 25 minutes! Not so!
Here's what I did. I simmered the ribs (after first brining to a boil) with the listed ingredients for 45 minutes. Removed and drained the ribs. Transferred them to a hot iron skillet with just enough oil to cover and seared turning frequently. They were delicious!
Not sure if anyone's mentioned this but as the ribs are cooking in the spices, the kitchen smells great!

By far my favorite way to prepare pork now!  Was delicious, tender and just incredible.  BF raved about it.  Did take about 2 1/2 hours to cook the water off but just made them more tender!

This is a terrific recipe - especially for the weeknights since it doesn't take a lot of time to prepare (although it tastes like it might). My two teenage boys love it. We've come up with a couple of variations we'd like to share: skip the soy sauce and add Teriaki sauce, Plum sauce (our favorite) or barbeque sauce and serve the meat and left over sauce over rice. YUM!!!We've also added mixed vegetables to it and it was kinda like a stir fry dinner. Our next sauce to try will be sweet and sour. Oh yeah, we use about a 1/2 bottle of the Kikkoman sauces for our flavor adventures.

This is how I've made my ribs for years - wonderfully juicy and flavorful.  I even go a step further and put those moist ribs on the grill or in the broiler with BBQ sauce and take it to the next level.  Yum.

Country style ribs go on sale often but I've never had a way to make them.  This recipe seemed pretty simple and straight-forward.  Wow, was this good.  As others noted, it may take longer to cook, however, the dish is absolutely delicious.  I probably could have let it boil down more, but I chose to add a bit of flour and make it more gravy-ish.  Fantastic with rice.  I'm pretty sure the leftovers in the fridge are even tastier today.  Thank you for an economical, easy and yet very tasty recipe.  Update: I make these as often as possible, they are addictive!

I'm going to make these tonight! To answer the question (dated 7/29/05), I believe the recipe uses "Country Style Pork Ribs Loin Rib-End" - that's what they're called at my local grocery store (Bethel Food in Connecticut).  They are thicker and meatier, have a small bone and come approx 4-5 per package. Hope this helps!

I tried this method last evening, and it was very good even though my wife thought it a bit salty.  Basically, I scrapped the things I didn't want (Rosemary, Bay Leaves and Cilantro) and added the things I did (1 T Basil, 1 tsp Hot Pepper Flakes and increased the Garlic a bit), and it worked well.  Because I only had 1 1/2 pounds of ribs, I did it in a large frying pan and used a light ale instead of the water.  I will definitely make this again and next time I will try a darker ale and apple juice.

It just so happened we had taken a rack ribs out from the freezer when I received this recipe in my email.  We picked up the few ingredients we didn't have from the store and made these today.  First, I have to say that I didn't expect what this recipe delivered.  It was amazing how the ingredients infused into the ribs.  The rendering of the meats fat turned into liquid gold when the water evaported, and the meat browned in it.  We used a deep chicken frying pan and it worked well.  It was large enough to easily brown all the ribs evenly, yet deep enough to place enough water into it to cook them through.  We cooked ours about an hour before all the water was gone, and it was perfect.  
I agree with many of the other reviewers here, the recipes calling for 1/2 of soy sauce is waaay to much sodium flavoring.  I do recommend only using half that much, other than that, rock this recipe with whatever your choice of herbs and spices, and for heavens sake, don't skip the browning of the meat in the left over gold that the meat has released, it is really the final touch to this recipe being a grand success.  I can't wait to try this recipe with chicken!!!

I thought these were great.  Hubby and kids said they were too salty.  I used low sodium soy sauce (1/2 cup).  Next time I will use only 1/4 cup.  Mine took a good 90 minutes to dry up all of the liquid.  I used bonless pork ribs, and my dutch oven with water covering them like the recipe said.  Next time I will probably use a shallower pan so that it doesn't take so long to evaporate the liquid.  They were very moist and tasty (I thought).  My neighbor stopped over while these were cooking and commented "something smells wonderful in here)!

Wow! I think I like these ribs better than off the grill! I made only one change: I was craving Gates BBQ sauce, so I used that instead of the soy sauce. The flavors of the sauce and other ingredients were wonderfully absorbed into the meat. The best thing about this method of cooking ribs is that they came out so tender and juicy. Just perfect! I did also add a bit more bbq sauce at the very end while browning.

Really excellent and a great change from a barbecue style. Take your time with this as the liquid does take a while to properly evaporate. I deglazed the pan with. Red wine as a little sauce then pored over the cooked meat. A little  cup orange juice in the initial water is good too.

So fantastic - the crust over the ribs at the end makes it like a BBQ any time of year!  I seasoned the raw ribs with Adobo, and instead of chopping garlic I use the organic chopped garlic that comes in a tube from most grocery produce sections - I rubbed a cloves worth into each rib before adding to the pot.  Super easy because you can throw everything in the pot and ignore it for awhile, but be careful when the water gets to a low level, once it disappears you have a very short window before the delicious mass of soy sauce and herbs starts to burn.  Thanks for this one!

This was a hit! The only change I will make next time will be to add less water, I am sure that was my mistake on eyeing the pot to the ribs.  Thank you so much I love the fresh lime and there can never be to much garlic in my house YUM!

Takes much longer to boil off the water than posted.  Account for around 2 hours.

This were delicious. I think it can be safely said thes are the best ribs I've ever had. Really. I followed the recipe exactly, except doubled it. It took around 2.5 hours for the liquid to reduce; however, I reserved the last 1/2 inch to use as a gravy. Served the ribs & gravy w/mashed potatoes. So good. However, the ribs were so tender they probably should have been served with something less mushy and more firm. This recipe deserves 5 stars, for sure!

Outstanding dish. My normally pork-adverse wife greedily cleaned every bone. Perhaps a little salty - maybe 1/3 or 1/4 cup soy next time - but you didn't notice till the end. I used  1.5 lbs baby back ribs and a 12" skillet, and the water evaporated in ~ 45 minutes. This one's a keeper. Did I mention it looks gorgeous on the plate?

These ribs were amazing. I used bone-in pork loin ribs and that's the only change I made. They smelled so so good when they were cooking and tasted even better. The meat just fell of the bone. This will be a go to recipe for me. Thanks so much for such a great recipe.

Absolutely Perfect my husband couldnt stop talking about these and said they melt in your mouth!!  My kids even ate them! I used boneless ribs.  I was a little concerned about the oregano but it was fine.  I did reduce the soy to 1/3 cup.  Didnt have fresh cilantro or parsley so used dried cilantro and didnt have fresh limes just the fake juice one so squeezed a bunch into it.  Also I stared these in the early afternoon boiled then turned off burner and they just sat in marinade for several hours.  I will definately make over and over again!

This recipe was so good.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it took well over an hour and a half to boil down, but once it did, it literally turned into this amazing sauce.  I used 1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce and I still found it somewhat salty.  Next time I'll try it with 1/3, but overall it still tasted fantastic!

I hate to sound stupid, but this recipe calls for 10 pork spare ribs, which normally come in slabs. I haven't tried it because I am not sure what measurement the author is referring to. Is it 10# of ribs (too much for 6 servings),or 10 individual ribs (not enough for 6 servings).  Please claify, as the recipe does sound good, and I'd love to try it.  Thx.

I was nervous cooking this recipe since my son loves BBQ ribs and normally doesn't like anything that seems "different" from that. Boiling ribs is something I've never done. So, I had a big pot, probably put too many ribs in but it started boiling down and all of a sudden my son is there saying "what smells so good?!" When it finally boiled down where we could eat them (it did take a very long time), I was still nervous...rosemary and lime instead of BBQ. Then we tasted them. We loved them! Add our thanks to your mom for this delicious way to cook ribs!

These always come out perfectly. We've been making these for a couple of years now and they're our go-to recipe for ribs. We made duck breast with this recipe and it was really good as well. We used cilantro, or neither parsley or cilantro depending on what we have. We will be growing parsley this year so I will be sure to make it that way as you said it is more traditional. Yum! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent. The ribs usually have so much fat on them but this recipe makes them easy to trim and eat. I used half the amount of soy sauce (ran out) and substituted orange juice for half of the amount of water. Added garlic powder, along with the garlic, while cooking.

I used bonless country style ribs (they were on sale ;), used only 1/3 cup low sodium soy sauce and eliminated the cilantro (not a big fan).  The ribs came out great--very rich and not too salty.  I used the left overs to make enchiladas--very tasty.  Thanks for the great recipe.

We absolutely loved it. I followed everything but the amount of soy sauce to be used.  I used less than 1/2 a cup and low sodium.  Will definitely make it again and will also try it with chicken.

These were really good! I didn't have limes so I used a little lemon juice and an orange. Served with sliced orange too. Can't wait to try this with chicken! I also got worried after an hour that there was still too much liquid and that it was taking too long to boil off so I removed about 1/2-3/4 of a cup of the liquid, brought it back to a boil just before serving and used it as "au jus" for the meat...awesome! Served mine with brown rice and broccoli, yum :)

I only gave this 4 stars because I didn't use the spices recommended.  However I did use the cooking method which was wonderful.  I am notorious for making dry pork and this have solved that problem. Tender and moist, a huge success and will definately be making it this way again and again.

These took forever to boil down; so much so that I finally removed about half of the water, strained it, and returned the ribs, herbs & garlic to the pan to brown. Used the broth to cook the rice.  I think the pan size is important to note - use a pot/pan that the ribs will lie flat in, especially if subbing country style ribs.  Maybe a large, deep skillet. Otherwise, there's too much water and the flavor is bland and the meat is dry.  The reviews from my Herd of Tasters were not good - on a scale of 1 to 10, the ribs scored 6 for taste, 4 for texture.  I'll try them again and change the pan I use, perhaps change the cut of meat.

These ribs are amazing!  The flavor combination is unique and delicious -- a very pleasant surprise.  I followed the recipe exactly, using country-style boneless pork ribs.  The only thing I will change when I make them again is to double or triple the lime juice and maybe decrease the soy sauce to 1/3 cup.  I will definitely be making these again, and will be using the ingredients and cooking method for other meats as well.  Kudos to your mother, Thelmalu!

Every single person I have made these ribs for were pleasantly surprised.  I make these on a day when I have time to really let the water evaporate slowly..it takes mine about 2 hours from the beginning to the end to make.  And yes, I add the soy sauce but use low sodium soy sauce and I add it only in the last 30 minutes of stove time.  I use cilantro that is freeze dried, you can buy it at the grocery store, the brand I use is Litehouse and you use it as the same amount you would use fresh cilantro.  I also add a little more lime into the cooking phase as I go. I serve half of the ribs as they are with the seasoning on the bottom dripped over the ribs.  The other half of my ribs I baste with bbq sauce and warm up in oven for about 10 min., turning once and re-basting...  NO KIDDING....NOT ONE person has disliked these ribs..WINNER

Took nearly two hours to boil/simmer down!  My preliminary nibbles do suggest that they are VERY salty, even though I reduced the (full-strength, because that's what I had on hand) soy to 1/3 cup.  I am hoping that the rice I serve them with will reduce the overall mouth-pickling effect.  I might make these again, depending on how my partner receives them, but I will definitely reduce the soy to...a tablespoon?  The flavors are wonderful (other than the saltiness).

The second time I made these ribs, I used country style ribs, and when they were done, I smothered them with Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce from this site, and heated them through in the oven. They were so good.

Absolutely fantatic!  I used the country style ribs.  I also had trouble with the amount of water-took almost one hour to cook.  They were tender and full of flavor.  I also made fried potatoes with cilantro and garlic.  My kids gobbled this up, will definitely make again.

These are by far the best ribs I've ever had.  The sauce that's created when the water is boiled down is amazing!  I deglazed the pan after browning the ribs (I used red cooking wine, but you could use stock or any other liquid) then put the ribs back in and mixed with the sauce.  It also took much longer than 25 minutes to boil the liquid off, but that could be the size pot I used.  I'll definitely make this again!

If it's difficult to find time to cook, you'll LOVE this recipe. After a long day working in the office, I could come home, through these ingredients together and have supper ready in an hour. No muss, no fuss.

Lately I've substituted the pork with chicken thighs to make this dish a bit healthier. This change makes the dish lighter. I never add the suggested lime since I rarely have the fruit lying around.

My guys enjoyed this and the house smelled great! I did cut the soy sauce in half because of the saltiness potential and taste preference. After reading all the reviews about the cooking time, I decided to use a large, deep skillet and it still took an hour and a half for the liquid/juices to cook away.  I even added some of the liquid to the rice I was cooking to give it added flavor.  Will definitely make again, maybe thickening the liquid toward the end.

Delicioso! These are very tasty & easy to make. I used a sprig of fresh rosemary instead of dried, just add in whole & the leaves will fall off on their own during cooking. Served with garlic naan bread instead of rice & they make great shredded pork sandwiches that way. Otherwise didn't change a thing & my husband loved them too. Thanks for sharing, will for sure be making these again!

This is a great way to cook country style ribs, they come out tender but as is it's way too much soy sauce.  I adjusted seasonings and left out the soy sauce and it was much better.

Awesome flavor!!  Recipe works as promised!  I cooked 12lbs. of pork spare ribs for a cookout.  Cooked them the night before and grilled them the next day on the BBQ. Worked really well!  No leftovers! Thanks for the great recipe Thelmau99!

I usually make bbq'ed pork ribs, but I wanted a change of pace so I decided to make these.  I will never go back to BBQ again, these were awesome!  The meat was so tender and the flavor was different, but great.  I used boneless ribs instead of spareribs and I'm glad I did.  I definitly advise you to make these tonight!

this is amazing!  I didn't measure exactly so I probably had less soy sauce than is called for but they turned out amazing!  I used country style ribs and about half way through, strained out about half of the juice and returned the rest to the pan to finish cooking.  I only did this because I didn't allow enough time to cook...

This was great! My family and I like gravy on our meat though, so I didn't completely simmer all the liquid away. I left about 3/4 cup of liquid in the pot for what started out as half a kilo of pork ribs. Then I sliced the ribs, plated them, and drizzled the liquid over the meat. Also, I used flat leaf parsley, and lemons because I didn't have limes. I'll definitely make this again, and will try limes next time.

Excellent!  I used chicken thighs (5) for this recipe and it tastes wonderful. My 4 year old boy finish his lunch quickly and ask me to make it again for dinner.  I notice that after 25 minutes simmering, I still have a lot of broth left. Probably chicken thighs are thicker than pork ribs so more water to cover them. So I just poured the broth out and continued browning chicken for 10 minutes. Worked out really nicely too. I also use cilantro since I don't have parley in the fridge (and too lazy to go buy it).

This was dinner tonight! And it recieved rave reviews! I followed the recipe exactly....It makes me angry when people say they tried a recipe and changed all of the ingredients, substituting this and that and adding such and such. They didn't TRY the recipe, so HOW can they rate it? I followed the ingredient list and instuctions and it was wonderful!

This recipe had WAY to much soy sauce, oregano and rosemary. My wife and a couple friends we had over couldn't eat it and ordered takeout, Embarrassing!! We checked the recipe and the meal was made correctly to what was listed.

These are very good!  I made them with country style ribs and used low sodium soy sauce.  The ribs were a little fatty so I needed to skim the fat off the the sauce.  I will be making these again.

Very good as written.  My only complaint is that the reduced sauce is too greasy.  And it takes forever to get the water boiled away.  Instead, I boil for maybe 45 minutes- an hour, then bake in the oven topped with honey bbq sauce for about 15 minutes or so.  Yummy!

I agree with others stating this is way too salty...the moisture to the meat was good though.  I thought I could cut down on the saltiness as well by using only a 1/4 cup of soy sauce but it was still too salty...sorry.

Great!!! This takes WAY longer than it says, but is worth the wait. I would use a low sodium soy sauce otherwise the salt kicks you in the butt. You can make this recipe gluten free just by using Tamari soy sauce instead of regular.

I read the reviews so I gave it a try.  This recipe is really excellent.  I added just a 1/4 cup of orange juice and paired the meat with cabbage slaw, brown rice and baked beans.  This is really one of the best dishes yet.

I was looking for something different to do with pork ribs and stumbled upon this recipe. Wonderful flavor! We absolutely love this! I've made it several times and everyone raves over it at the dinner table. The only thing I do different is cut back just a tad on the soy sauce. Fresh parsley is a must. I haven't tried it with chicken yet but I will be soon.

Did as directed and just swapped out pineapple-ginger Terryaki sauce for the soy. What a great taste and easy method ! My son and Hubs liked this very much,as we are not much for BBQ anyway.

I was craving some sort of Cuban or Brazilian food and ran across this recipe.  I thought I'd give it a try - and am SO GLAD I did!!  I started cooking and realized I was out of soy sauce AND I didn't have limes like I thought I did, so I didn't think it would turn out - but it was fantastic!  I had a few packets of soy sauce leftover from Chinese take-out, and I used lemon juice instead of lime for cooking.  I also used cilantro instead of parsley (as the note says you can).  I shredded my pork at the end instead of serving whole, but that's a personal preference.  Served with juices over saffron rice and fried plantains - fantastic dinner that even the kid loved! Can't wait to try this again with the CORRECT ingredients!

well, I must say...this was very tasty!!!
I've always made the "crock pot" smothered in BBQ recipe.  wasn't sure how this recipe would be recieved by DH (fussiest person I ever met in my life!!)HOWEVER..... I was surprised he liked it, I think he was too!!!!!  I used a cast iron skillet thinking it would be tall enough to cover the pork but it was not, so I just boiled it till the water evap. & browned.  it does take some time to evap. so plan more time than allowed.  I will make this again..it really was pretty tasty!!

I followed the recipe exactly - except for cutting amount of soy sauce in half. I loved it. Definitely a keeper

Absolutely amazing. It took much longer than 25 minutes for the water to cook out, so I removed the ribs and put the stove to high heat. Before adding the ribs back, I drained the fat out of the pot. I also used 1 tbsp of crushed bay leaves (because that's what I had in the cupboard), and it was great. I served the ribs along with the parsley/garlic paste, and it was a huge hit. Please send our thanks to your mother!!

We liked this recipe. The meat was full of flavor, good, piquant and delicious. A little salty, though. I used a little less soy sauce that the recipe calls for, so next time will use just 1/3 cup. Freezes well too.

I just made these for the first time tonight and I am now completely stuffed! These ribs are simply AHHHHmazing!  I'm a pork fan but my husband is not particularly.  The flavor combination of the garlic, lime and cilantro was a big hit! My husband has already asked that I make these again, soon! I will be happy to comply.  
Like other reviewers I modified the soy sauce just a bit. I used 1/3 cup of low sodium. Also added a couple extra cloves of garlic as we tend to like a lot of garlic.  I used country style ribs and the meat just fell apart beautifully.

I wasn't 100% thrilled with the taste of the end product, but I like the method and the way it kind of thickened & browned the meat. Will try again perhaps with different seasonings than soy sauce & garlic.

I've tried this twice and can't understand how others say it is so good.  The ribs tasted like boiled meat with a soy sauce reduction - which is what they are.  I decreased soy sauce to 1/3 cup - low sodium even - and it was still too salty.  Otherwise I followed it exactly and they weren't that tender.  Again, they tasted like boiled meat.

Great technique!  I used a favorite bbq sauce that has many of the same ingredients as the recipe.  Delicious, and the meat just fell from the bones.  I will definitely use this one again.

Fantastic - my husband, who is not ordinarily a "rib man" had to force himself to stop eating.  It did take a lot longer to cook the water off but I think that was necessary to tenderize the ribs. Now we plan to try this same method and flavor with a brisket ( you know Texans and their briskets) and will let you know how it works, either with an update or a new recipe - whichever seem appropriate.

OK, YUM! This recipe I pretty much followed (normally I don't) and it is D-lish!! The only addition was a few whole peppercorns and probably more rosemary than called for and a bit less soy sauce. (I don't measure either.) My Honey just walked in the door, took a sniff and headed for the stove. At first he turned his nose up at the "grass-like objects" floating in the liquid but after a taste I got a big 'ol smooch! It did take quite some time to reduce - I think it has been 6-7 hrs.(Could have been done much sooner, I started early and simmered after boiling for a while.) Will fix again. Superb rib recipe. Different from any other I've tried. Very tender too!

YUMMY!!! This recipe is fantastic. I added only half of the soy sauce and it came out so good. I served this with grilled veggies and tortillas (the tortilla recipe on this site is great "HOMEMADE FLOUR TORTILLAS"). Thanks THELMALU99.

The only thing I changed was instead of cooking until all the liquid was gone, I just cooked up until right before and spooned the thickened sauce over the ribs. No leftovers.

I was so looking forward to using this recipe.  I shopped for all the ingredients and followed it to the letter.  It smelled wonderful while cooking and it did make the meat fork-tender, which was nice.  However, for some reason, it was sooo salty that we could hardly eat it!  I don't know why.   The only thing I could figure was it was the soy sauce.  And I use alot of soy sauce in my cooking, so my family is accustomed to that taste.  But this had such a salty flavor that we could not finish it.  I was disappointed, especially because I had such high hopes for this one.

These were awesome. Surprising how good they taste!!  Fabulous!!!  It did however take about 3 hours from start to finish as the water took forever to evaporate.  I would suggest if you are doing this in a pot as the recipe states, you allow triple the time for it to cook.  You could also put this in a 12-14" deep sided skillet and it wouldn't take as long.  It was well worth the wait once we sat down to eat and I wouldn't change a thing in the ingredients!!!  Hats off to your mom for this one!!!

This is a great way to cook ribs in the winter time. Modify seasonings to whatever you like. The recipe as written makes a pretty salty rib - try to tone down the sauce by diluting with broth or adding less.

3 stars because I've just started ~ how bout 3 stars for EASE of prep!!

Well, I've started the recipe.  It's on my stove coming to a boil.  I did use 1/3 cup soy sauce per other reviewers.  My rosemary is dried so I whirred it in the spice grinder to powder it a bit.  Same with the oregano (leaves ~ ground it a bit to powder ~ but not completely powder).  Did use cilantro.  I did not have enough fresh garlic so used what I had (half head ~ about 4 HUGE cloves) and put some garlic powder in it.  Used 3 small bay leaves and one fresh lime (juice).  Also put in some course ground pepper.  OMG it smells heavenly.  I am anxious to see how this turns out.  

It's been my experience that boiling pork makes it dry....  I'm very hopeful.

About 2 hours later...

I boiled those ribs *really low* very slow...  Just got to wondering what to have WITH them.  I pulled the meat out, used 1 1/2 cups of broth (with 2 1/2 cups water) to make rice.  Cooking down the little bit of liquid left to make a sauce.  (a cup o red wine in it would be great!!)

The ribs were bone in country style pork ribs.  9 of them.  they are FALLING APART.  The flavor is delectable!!  I WILL MAKE THIS AGAIN!!

Thank you

this is an identical recipe to a Filipine dish of pork adobo. My husband is filipino, and I cook chicken adobo quite regularly. I could not believe myself, that I did not recognize this recipe until it was almost time to dish it out. I like the idea of using lime juice, instead of vinegar, as in traditional adobo. Good recipe.

these are VERY good. My house smelled so good while they were cooking!  It did take longer than 25 minutes to evaporate the water.  Served the ribs with saffron rice and salad.  Excellent, just as the recipe is. Did not need any changes.

This recipe is very good. It's too salty even though I used low sodium soy sauce, so I will use maybe 1/4 cup next time. It took an hour for all the liquid to cook out, but well worth the wait. They were tender and juicy.  Thanks ThelmaLu

My mother made a bland version of these ribs to please my Scottish father's tastebuds.  The soya sauce was omitted and more vegetables added to the simmering water,e.g., onion, carrot, parsnip.  Ribs were simmered in this liquid till tender but not falling off the bone and then were passed under the broiler briefly.  A bit of worchestershire sauce was sometimes lightly brushed across the ribs before broiling.  Great basic recipe for making all kinds of tasty variations.  Tx.

I love these ribs! We make it all the time and the results are never disappointing. The cooking time is a bit off, however no problem, by the time the water is reduced and the ribs beginning to brown, the meat is always tender and the aroma permeating the house is mouth watering. Thank you for sharing!

AMAZING!! So simple and done in no time. Fall off the bone tender and packed with flavour. I brought some leftovers into work and my colleagues were around me like vultures. I gave a few taste test bites (it was hard parting with any of it!) and of course they loved it just as much as I did! Passed along the recipe. I didn't have any bay leaves nor parsley but they were still AMAZING! saving this one to put on repeat :)

Wow. Let me start by saying that I have never made ribs before, but when I received this recipe in my inbox, I had to make it. Baby back ribs were on sale at my grocery store - so that's what I used. The only adjustments I made to the recipe were to add some Cherry Coke Zero to the water at the beginning to add some extra flavor, used fresh rosemary instead of dried and only used 1/3 cup of soy sauce instead of 1/2 cup based on the reviews. I love salt, but I'll probably only use 1/4 cup next time. Final cooking time was 2 1/2 hours. LET THEM BOIL DOWN. Do not drain the liquid. I used a deep 14 inch round pan and barely covered the top of the ribs with liquid. I was worried I was going to overcook the meat by letting them boil for so long, but they were delicious. I used fresh parsley and some extra lime juice at the end. So, so, so good.

I liked it but next time I'll reduce the garlic and add a sweetener. I like the mix of salt and sweet, but it must be balanced.

After reading other reviews, I used only 1/3 of the soya sauce and it was still extraordinarily salty. The garlic and oregano were overwhelmed by the rosemary which gave a slightly bitter taste.  I'll be deleting this recipe from my recipe box.

When you boil ribs you take a lot of flavor out. Try removing the silver skin off the back of the rack. THAT helps make them more tender.

COOK THIS RECIPE TODAY......OH MY GOD THE AROMAS.....TOOK LONGER TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT BUT WORTH WAIT. THE TASTE WAS OUT OF THIS WORLD. MY RIBS WERE VERY TENDER. I DON'T CARER TOO MUCH FOR CILANTRO SO I USED THE PARSLEY. AFTER THEY WERE DONE I PUT THEM ON THE GRILL FOR A FEW MINUTES THEN TOSSED THEM IN THE COOKED SEASONINGS AND SPICES. MY DAUGHTER AND I JUST LOVED 'EM!!!!!GREAT ONE!!!! WILL DEFINITELY DO THIS ONE AGAIN.

We don't eat added sugar so finding a good bbq recipe that is not full of sugar is hard but this one was DELISH!!!  Definitely a keeper and will make again.  It took longer than 25 minutes for the water to boil off though so don't overfill the pot.

I had never made ribs on the stovetop and saw this and thought I would try it.  I just didn't think it would out taste my personal recipe...but this was fantastic.  I will only use this recipe from now on, tasty, flavorful, tender, and quick to prepare...just terrific.

I've been looking for a rib recipe that was different than the typical BBQ sauce recipe for quite some time and I MUST say...this is THE ONLY recipe I will ever use.  My husband comes home from work and smells this and can't wait to eat!!!  BEST ribs EVER!

Very good flavor. FYI...do not raise temp to speed up as another reviewer suggested. Every stove is different. Mine turned out a bit tough, but the taste was excellent. I am thinking that electric may take longer then a gas stove (?) so just make sure to give yourself a little extra time just in case. Trust me, it is sooooo worth it! YUM!!!!

Scrumptous and will make again.  Giving it four stars because I too thought it was rather salty.  Next time, I will reduce the soy sauce or use low sodium.  As well, it took a good hour and a half to cook down but was worth the wait.

This is a very good recipe. I was looking for a different way to cook ribs (other than on the grill) and this recipe did not disappoint. I made one adjustment: I had apple cider in the frig so I used that with a little bit of water for the liquid. The only thing I'm curious about is that the liquid didn't cook down. I didn't cut the ribs into single pieces and am wondering if that made a difference. I cut them into several large pieces that fit in the large pot. Would love for the person that published this recipe to respond.

I over did it with the water, so I had to drain some out, but it was still a great recipe! We will make these again for sure, but I think I may try and crush the rosemary a bit more as I didn't care for the texture of it, but that is just a personal preference. Thanks for sharing.

I must admit I was sceptical at first but with all the good reviews I had to try it and I am so glad I did.  This is soooo delicious and the entire family said this is a do over!  The meat falls off the bone and the flavor is wonderful.  The only change I would make is to use low sodium soy sauce or a little less of the regular.  Thanks for the recipe!

I have made this 3 times and no leftovers at all!!!  Especially good with fresh herbs I grow myself.  One note is to put water only halfway up ribs and turn ribs as they cook.  Otherwise it takes almost an hour for water to evaporate.  Ribs are juicy, tender and oh so flavorful.

OK, I have to admit these were DELICIOUS! One thing I did wrong was the water and the kind of ribs I used where rack ribs. It still came out delicious. I bought country style ribs and will do this again. I also added sweet soy sauce (Bought @ authentic Asian market, not grocery store) and it gave it a nice little sweetness. I have a recipe for the soy sauce but I didn't use allot. Just about 2 tablespoons while boiling. Did everything else the same. GOOD RECIPE!!!!! Highly recommend! Thank you for posting it!

I'm adding my 5-star rating as well.  These were so delicious, falling off the bone tender.  Next time I will use low-sodium soy sauce though because they were a little salty.  I think I'll also use boneless country style ribs.

So very, very good.  I also use Country Style Ribs and these take at least 2 hours, but they are SO yummy and tender.  I have made these a few times and they are always a hit.  They are salty, but I like that.  I prefer these to making them any other way.

Absolutely the best ribs.  I am always on the look-out for any kind of recipe that will save me lighting the oven & heating up my kitchen as it's so stinking hot down here in the summer.  This recipe is now in my "favorites."  I prepared exactly as the recipe but I think next time I will take a hint from the reviews and use less soy sauce as they did turn out a bit saltier than I like.  Otherwise this is a definite KEEPER!!!  Thanking you so much for the posting...Mary Jane

wonderful way to cook ribs. I have par-boiled but never cooked all the way through. I changed things around quite a bit. to the water I added ketchup, brown sugar molassis, soy, a bit of mustard, and lemon juice. Kind of made it like a marinade, and cooked as stated.Every one looked at me strangely, but  they came out wonderful, tender, and tasty, even the ones who are not crazy about bbque sauce had seconds, and every one was amazed how good they came out. Thank you for posting gave me another way to prepare my ribs, and so much quicker than it usually takes

If you're trying to sell your house and want the house to smell WONDERFUL, just put these on the stove!  These are really, really good!  I used boneless country pork ribs because that's all I could find where I shopped (the spare ribs didn't look as good).  Next time I make these, I will use less soy sauce because they were too salty for me.  And it took a good 2 hours for my water to boil down.  I would LOVE to know what sort of pan to use to make the cook time go faster....a large skillet?  I used a dutch oven because I had 8 ribs.  Anyway, the spices, the garlic...mmmm, so good!  Other than the rib type, I followed the recipe exactly.  Like I said, next time I will cut the soy sauce to probably 1/4 cup.  Will leave the other ingredients as is because it's perfect!  Sort of reminds me of Carnitas when done, except without the under-the-broiler crust.  Serve with rice or noodles and you have a stellar meal!  Thanks so much Thelma and thank your Mom too!   Wonderful!  Give it a try all!!

My family LOVED these ribs. I made the recipe as listed.   I have to agree with some of the other reviews in that it was a bit too salty.  I will for sure make again, but I'm going to try it with low sodium soy sauce.  Putting lime juice on the ribs after cooking did help cut down the salty taste however.  But still over all...easy to make and wonderful to eat!  Thanks THELMALU99 for sharing your mom's recipe!

I  am a fanatic about smoking ribs.  You know that low and slow thing.  When I read this recipe I was amused that it sort of turned what I do around.  Here the ribs a boiled , then browned.  The way I normally cook them I smoke them then wrap them in foil and let them sort of steam.  Being the type of person that is always looking for a new way of doing thing I gave these a try.  Bottom line… does your Mom have any other recipes she wants to share??  If this is an example of what eating in Brazil is like, I want to vacation there and eat my way across the country.

so easy and soooo so yummy!  i didn't have the rosemary and oregano on hand, so i threw in dried parsley and basil, a little fresh cilantro and green onion and it was deee-lish.  great basic cooking method, very easy and quick to throw everything in and just let it boil away while you prepare the rest of dinner.  easily adaptable to lots of flavors.  i did cut the soy sauce to half and it was still to slaty (and i love salt).  next time i'll cut it even more.

I give this recipe two stars for ease, even though it did not go well for me. After an hour of simmering, I realized my meat was not getting tender, so I cut it into smaller pieces and put it back into the liquid. It was still too tough after another 40 mins.  I had boneless country style ribs that I defrosted in the microwave. Maybe it was the microwaving that made the meat tough. Flavor was OK. Will try again though, as I got very different results than most of the reviews.

I enjoyed this cooking method but the soy sauce makes it a very salty dish.  I will try again with either a reduced sodium soy &/or less soy.

Delicious! I read the other reviews and also reduced the amount of soy sauce, especially since I bought a smaller package of spareribs.  I also boiled the ribs solely with water for the first hour to get them more tender, then I added the other ingredients and followed the recipe. I didn't let all the liquid boil away as my husband and I love sauce, so I made sure there was enough sauce to serve over the ribs and rice. Wow, delicious! I ate more than my share.  Will definitely be making these again and again!

These are incredible. I had to boil them for 1 hour and there was some water left, but not much. Tonight I am going to slow roast them at 350 degrees for 2 hours uncovered. They went so fast, 2 of us only had one last time so I'm making tons extra. YUM

Fixed this for an early Easter dinner today.. was very easy to prepare.  It did take my boneless country spare ribs about 2 hours to cook down.  I put bbq sauce on half the meat, which I served.... wonderful!  The other half, I will serve plain.  Very easy, extremely tender and bursting with flavor.  Great recipe!

Great recipe - whole family loved it.  It would have only taken 30 minutes to reduce if I had used a shallower pan, however I needed my stockpot to hold it all, so it ended up taking about 1 hour to get it down to a reasonable amount of liquid.  Then I transferred it to a large family sized frying pan.  From there it only took 10 minutes.  CAn't wait to do this one again!

After one hour, there was still quite a bit of liquid.  I couldn't wait any longer, so I took the ribs out, put them on a baking sheet, brushed them with some barbeque sauce and baked them for 10 minutes.  The flavor of the remaining broth in the pan was predominantly soy sauce, even with all the seasoning. (no offense to Mom.  I'm sure hers come out way better than mine did)

My husband and I enjoyed this very much.  It was full of flavor yet had none of that messy bbq sauce to deal with.  I might not bother with the cilantro next time; it didn't seem to add any extra flavor.

A few of the ribs were a little dry and the water did not boil away, but with practice I should get it right. The meat was very flavorful.

The seasoning in this recipe were not good at all but the method is perfect. Try it with tomato boulion, liquid smoke, pepper, basil, garlic, onion, cayenne,mustard and a tablespoon brown sugar. ??You won’t be dissapointed

It was delicious, and I'll try it again.  I followed the recipe, except I didn't have dried rosemary, so I picked fresh from the bushes outside.  My 8 bone slab of ribs was not boiled down in 45 minutes. Or an hour and 45 minutes.  After 2 hours,  I removed the meat and boiled the liquid over high heat for about 10 minutes, then strained the liquid and returned the solids to the pot along with the ribs.  I stirred them around to brown the meat, and that's what I ate.  Don't know why the liquid didn't boil away like everyone else's; I'll try the country ribs next time and see if that was the difference.  Update--Country ribs are the way to go.  I've made this 3 times, so i must really like it even tho the liquid doesn't boil away for me.  I've upped my rating to 5 stars.

This was DELISH!  I tried to follow the recipe to the letter.  The only thing I changed was I didn't have any rosemary so that was omitted and I cut the soy sauce to 1/4 cup per others suggestion, used minced garlic instead of cloves and changed the parsley to cilantro also as suggested.  We both LOVED it.  We can't wait to try this with chicken.  We think one of the key things is to squeeze lime juice on the ribs before serving.   UPDATE...  Made this again tonight and followed the recipe EXACTLY.  Again... DELISH.  I do think that I prefer the Cilantro as opposed to the Parsley but really NOT that much of a difference.  I think the Cilantro brings out the flavor of the lime at the end when you squeeze the juice (right before serving)!  That is the only thing I would change other than lowering the Soy Sauce if you are watching your salt but I use low sodium.

My husband said I knocked this one out of the ball park!  I followed this recipe but used dried cilantro instead of the parsley.  I also put a "frozen' rack of ribs in the pot and it took approximately 3 1/2 hrs. to boil all the water out.  
This recipe was so easy to put together and yummy to eat; will go in my favorite recipe box!

I am giving this a 5 star, even though it was a little dried out. Not too much though and I really liked the flavor the lime, rosemary and parsley gave the meat. You can't beat the smell that filled the house during cooking. I used Country Style Ribs that are thick and that might be why mine weren't perfect. I will make them smaller next time. I served these ribs with rice and the family agreed that it would benefit from being served with black beans too. That might be more Cuban than Brazilian, but the sauce from the beans might help. We're going to try it with the leftovers. I will make this recipe again.

This is a very easy, flavorful recipe. And the clean-up is simple, too! The ribs had a lovely flavor that was not overpowering. The method of cooking seems to help them stay moist. This is going on my list of favorite recipes that we make regularly.

I didn't have any luck with this method at all.  I had to salvage the recipe by draining the water off after an hour and brush with some rib sauce and put in the oven to brown.

A little disappointing.  Followed the recipe to the tee, except 1/3 cup of soy sauce as others suggested.  Maybe the flavor is lacking some sweetness to it.  The water took an hour to evaporate.

This recipe is fantastic!! I nice twist to your typical 'messy' ribs. The meat falls right off the bone. I cut down a little on the Soy sauce which didn't make a difference to the taste, just made it less salty. I finished them off on the grill to add a little crisp. My family is looking forward to our next Rib night! YUM YUM YUM!

OMG these were so ridiculous! One of the best, if not the best, recipes I've ever made off allrecipes.com. It takes forever to boil out the water, but stay with it. As the water evaporates it condenses and both adds flavor to the ribs and tenderizes them. The meat was FULL of flavor and just melt in your mouth, fall off the bone tender. Amazing. I can't wait to try this with chicken, too. 10 stars!!

First time I made this I didn't have any Lime and I love it but the second time I made this I made sure I had lime.......not a good idea.  Because I had to cook the ribs longer to make them tender the lime became bitter and overwhelming.  Will never use the lime again but will be using the recipe again.

All methods of cooking ribs fall short of smoking.  Until now.  This recipe doesn't compete with smoked ribs (thusly it doesn't fail).  It is simply a different method that is not trying to imitate.  Sometimes I crave smoked ribs and sometimes I crave these.
Today, I'm cooking these.  Im going to try it with some red cabbage cole slaw and probably some rice.  So......off to the kitchen I go.

Wow! These were some really good ribs. I was skeptical of this recipe because of the unorthodox cooking method for ribs, but I'm glad I tried it and I will definitely cook them like this again.

To all the chefs that are just boiling the ribs, then browning on the grill, STOP! Be patient and let cook until the water has evaporated, it creates a glaze/crust/sauce on the ribs (it took mine about 1 1/2 hours).  No need for BBQ sauce.  They are soooo good!

I love this recipe! The first time, they were a little too salty because I also seasoned them but, after a few adjustments, this recipe became a regular on the menu. I like that it doesn't take too much prep time and have some white rice and black beans on the side and it's a winner!

The water boiled out in about 30-35 minutes for me. I think those that didn't get the water out were on low simmer.  She says medium boil with lid off which is fairly vigorous.  I used 1 T dried parsley and 1 T dried cilantro and 4 fat cloves of garlic and all the other seasonings the way they were written.  I had 2 lbs. of boneless country spare ribs.  
  The soy was over powering - VERY SALTY.  The other seasonings were good. I would use 1/4 cup of soy at most next time or maybe even less and add 1/4 cup red wine or marsala.  I love cooking method - fun and easy. It took about 2 minutes or less to brown once the water was gone.  I had seasoned my pan with oil in the beginning on sides as well as bottom and I added a little more olive oil on the browning time.  My pan cleaned up surprisingly easy. 
  In the meantime, I boiled some potatoes with a a little skin left on them with a touch of olive oil and 1 clove garlic (3 reg. size yellow potatoes) and mashed them with a little (2 T) half and half/milk and sprinkled some dill.  That made a nice complimentary dish.

This is one of the best recipes I've tried on Allrecipes!  I followed the ingredients exactly.  It took longer to boil down the water than recipe stated.  It boiled so long that I stopped when there was about 1/4 of the water left and added cornstarch and made it into a gravy.  It was delicious.  Itook meat off the bones and served it over noodle.  Amazing!

Not sure what went wrong. Tried it with just over 3 lbs of baby back ribs.  Filled pot so that ribs were just covered with water. Added soy sauce, garlic, rosemary, oregano parsley per recipe. Brought to a boil, reduced heat. Bubbled away for about 40 minutes.  Still had more than 1/4 inch of water and no sign of browning. Meat was done, but result was bland.  Anybody else have a similar result?

Fantastic! Had to cook them for 2 hrs on simmer, but worth the wait! Good thing I used low sodium soy sauce, as it was a bit salty. However, I don't normally cook with lots of salt, so I'm not a good judge of saltiness. The lime gave it a tiny zip! Yum!!

Thank you so much for your recipe. I used fresh herbs, Bragg's  (less sodium) soy sauce and followed the directions. I also used boneless pork ribs. The best thing about this recipe is the technique. No wonder the flavor is so intense and the pork so tender. It just works.... That sear I got on the pork at the very end? Put this dish right over the top. W.O.W.

These were so delicious! This Texas family gobbled up everything on their plates. We had guests over for dinner and they raved about how wonderful everything came out. Evidence was empty plates even after serving hefty portions. I will definitely make this again. Like other readers, I used country style pork ribs. I put the entire package about 7 pounds into a roaster, cooking atop my gas stove top, every 15 mins I would switch the roaster around the burners to create a more evenly distributed "roast". It did take a lot longer than 25 mins, but I had quite a bit to cook about 2.5 hours. It was well worth it.

It also took me far longer than the 25 minutes to boil off the water. I wish I would have kept track. I was targeting to eat around 6, and we finally sat down at 7. I ended up pouring off a lot of water as well, returning the "good bits" to the pot. They were fantastic, even for my picky 6 year old (he enjoyed gnawing on the bones like a T Rex!). I can only imagine how much better they'll be when I can take the time to do them correctly.

Wonderful!! Made with reduced sodium soy sauce and boneless pork ribs. After 35/40 min the water still hadn't completely evaporated so I just poured it out and then browned the pork. My husband said this was the best pork he has ever had. Very flavorful!

I followed the basic recipe instructions as I didn't have all of the ingredients, but the reviews sounded great, so I tried it.  Boiled ribs?  Oh yeah, baby!  They were AMAZING!  I used beer instad of water. No lime. No rosemary. I followed what other reviewers said about watching the water. I was skeptical until the very end when the beer boiled away and the seasonings remained. Browned the ribs; removed from pan; stirred BBQ sauce into the pan with the drippings.  Spooned/spread over ribs.  I'll never cook ribs any other way!  Thanks for a fabulous new recipe.

Very good but too salty. I've made these a few times and have reduced the soy by a lot. Takes MUCH longer than 25 minutes to simmer out the water.

Just a note to thank you for this recipe!  Delicious!  It took me, like others, at least double the recommended time to cook the liquid out, but the results were tender and well cooked. Again, thanks.

I listened to the other reviews as well and reduced the soy sauce amount. I'm very glad that I did as I could tell if I hadn't it would have been too salty for us! Other than that we LOVED this recipe and it will become a staple in our house.

These came out wonderful! I was looking for an oven or stove top version of pork ribs, and I found this. We weren't disappointed. The ribs were juicy and so full of flavor. I didn't have all the ingredients, but that didn't make a difference. The garlic and soy sauce, plus a touch of lime really brought this out amazingly. We will try it again with chicken next time. Thanks for sharing this awesome recipe!

I would highly recommed this recipe!  It is awsome!  Very simple and gives a great flavor with little effort.  I cooked about twice as much and removed the rib sections as they were done and cooked mine a bit longer till they fell off the bone.  It was a smash hit!

Easy and good flavor without having to slow cook them all day.  I probably put a bit too much water in so it took a couple of hours to cook down but no big deal.

Hubby is eating lowcarb.  This meat is very tasty!  He was so pleased with this dish.  I will be making it for him many times in the future! I followed others suggestions and only used 1/4 C soy - and used Gluten-free to allow my son to enjoy as well :) I kept some of the sauce and they slathered it on the ribs with each bite.

Absolutely amazing, It's been 3 days since I've finished these off and I want more already!! They were even great at midnight and cold! My children loved them! I made this without having all the ingredients but substituted the best I could i.e., lemon juice in place of lime and 1/4 cup soy sauce and 1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce because I ran out of soy. With these little twists they were still amazing. I could go on raving about this recipe, just try it, you'll love them!

The magic happened around 35 mins in when the water/juices began to caramelize and we added a lime herb dressing to thicken.  Great recipe - thanks!

Wow, these were so good!  My husband went on and on about them!  I used country-style pork ribs and don't think I'll ever cook them another way.  Easy to make too!  I made gravy in the pot after browning them and ate it on mashed potatoes. Yum!

This is one of my all time favorite recipes to prepare.  It is so tasty and easy to do.  I tried it when I first saw it because it was in the summer and I didn't want to put the hot oven on.  The meat came out so juicy and delicious.  It was easier to prepare than in the oven and the results were superb.

These ribs are delicious. I made them exactly according to the directions with the exception of saving the juice after cooking down about 2 hours later. I had at least 1/2 of the juice remaining and it was sooo tasty I thickened with cold water and about 3 tbls of cornstarch to make a sauce and served it over brown rice or potatoes. My husband loved it as it had a wonderful flavor which was from the juice. I also used low sodium soy sauce and used 4 large pork ribs.

Absolutely delicious. My local grocery store had some absurdly good prices on boneless pork ribs one day, so I picked up a couple packs and froze them, but had no idea what to do with them. Came across this recipe, and followed it almost exactly (used key limes instead of limes because I had some leftover from margaritas the weekend before). Next time, I'll be using regular lime juice, but this recipe is perfect as is. Try it (especially if you can get your ribs as cheap as I did.)

GREAT recipe, easy to make! Followed it exactly, except using low sodium soy sauce. Also made it with chicken several times...yum! Make sure you boil down the liquid at the end...it makes a yummy brown coating on the meat and is totally worth the time!

I made this tonight for dinner, and loved it! Very tender, very flavorful. I used a quarter cup of low-sodium soy sauce and cilantro. Served it with herb and garlic couscous, and collard greens. Delicious! Think I'll make open face sandwiches with the leftovers, tomorrow...yum!

Have made this several times.  Always excellent!  I place the cooked ribs on a cookie sheet, add bbq sauce and put in a warm oven for 5-10 min to glaze sauce ('Cause that's how we like it.)  Just tried it on a whole chicken (same cooking directions, but about 5 hrs cooking time), family absolutely loved it.  Breast meat seemed dry to me but not to others.  But, then again, I prefer dark meat.

MY FAMILY LOVES THESE RIBS!  They raved about them and compared then to carnitas (they love carnitas).  I made them for a family party a day ahead.  To reheat we fried them up and they became crispy just like carnitas.  Delicioso!

Very good!! My family loved this dish! My husband asked for them again tonight! I will decrease the lower sodium soy sauce to 1/4 c instead of the half cup it calls for since I found them a little more salty than I like, but other than that I loved it! I used fresh parsley the first time but will try the cilantro tonight. Thanks for the great addition to my recipe favorites!

This is a wonderful recipe.  My family and I love ribs but my Husband is allergic to tomatoes and almost every barbecue sauce has tomatoes in it so been trying to find an alternative.  These ribs are so delicious not to mention the little bits on the bottom of the pan.  I damped out the oil and stirred them in with my mash potatoes.  So delicious.

I finished with bbq sauce in the oven...definitely a tender and can't get anymore "fall off the bone."  Usually in the summer I smoke ribs, but I think this was my husband's favorite rib so far, and we can make them all year round.  Thanks...will keep this one in the recipe box.

"Yummy, yummy, yummy, I love these ribs in my tummy!!"  Seriously, while it DOES take longer for the water to evaporate than the recipe states (at least an hour or longer), this is a GREAT way to prepare country style ribs! I love my crock pot, but cooking this cut of ribs that way produces much more grease than I like (I'm too lazy to dirty another pan to broil/sear them first).  And, although I'm a "fly by the seat of my pants" kind of cook (I tweak spices or any alcohol added according to my mood or what's on hand), these ribs STILL come out GREAT!!! I also combine another method (also on this site) to finish the ribs: once the water has boiled off, I reduce the heat, add BBQ sauce to the ribs and let them "stew" in the sauce a few minutes before serving. All I can say is, if you're looking for a sure-fire way to cook good country style ribs, use this recipe. You WON'T be disappointed. Thanks so much for sharing it with us, Thelmalu99!! :-)

This recipe was easy and flavorful.  I did think it was a little on the dry side; maybe cooking it for 5 minutes less would help.  Overall it was delicious my husband, my 3 and 4 year old all loved it!  I served it with a side of roasted potatos and salad.

Very Good Flavor. As others I used boneless country ribs, and using low sodium soy sauce still only used 1/4 cup.  Just enough salt for us. Nice change from BBQ.

I made this just the way it says to but I didn't cover the ribs all the way and it made more work for me, having to turn them frequently.  So, make sure you cover them with water all the way.  I used my largest, widest pan, not a pot and it helped reduce cooking time.  This is my absolute favorite way to cook ribs now.  I tried both bone-in and boneless and they both work great with this recipe.  Gotta have cilantro and lime--makes the recipe great.  Thank you for sharing the recipe!

These were super easy and super good.  Dinner guests and hubbie loved them.  I substituted whatever fresh herbs I had in the garden (generous proportions of rosemary, oregano, lemonbalm) and left out the bay leaves 'cause I didn't have any in the pantry.  Used extra soy sauce and added a splash of dry red wine just for kicks.  I had to cook it a lot longer than 25 minutes (closer to 1 hour), but that wasn't really a problem.   Next time I'll triple the recipe and make enough for several meals at once.

What a great recipe - delicious - would have given it more stars but wasnt allowed.  My entire family loved the ribs and they are a picky bunch.  My only change - it took alot longer for the liquid to boil down and evaporate about an hour not 25 mins.  But still well worth the wait!

My family really enjoyed this.  We finished it all!  I didn't put in the lemon juice only because I didn't have any but it still came out great.

Amazing.  I used chicken instead of pork because that is all I had on hand.  took others suggestions and cut back on the soy.  I will definitely be making this again. My whole family loved this.

We really liked this rib but next time will us low sodium soy sauce as we thought they were a little on the salty side.

My husband and I loved these.  I was skeptical, and even cooked a "plan b" meal in case we didn't like them.  For a healthier option, I'll try the country style ribs next time as others have tried.

I thought I was going to have to slather these ribs in BBQ sauce like I do when I grill them, but they were absolutely scrumptious with the recipe as is.  Next time I will use less water, but other than that--fabulous!

These ribs are good . . . BUT my kids and I had to sauce them.  So this is a great way to prepare the ribs but we just could not eat them without sauce.

Oh so good! A different kind of rib; if you are expecting Baby Back ribs, this is not it...BUT you have to try it.  The flavor is wonderful.  I made a huge batch and had to pour off some of the sauce (I tripled the recipe)...but then I threw in some chicken breasts and simmered in the sauce....amazing.  All 7 of us loved it!

This was fantastic!  I followed the advice of the previous reviews and used country ribs.  It took about 2.5 hours for all of the liquid to evaporate but when it was done the meat was deliciously tender.  To cut back on sodium we used low-sodium soy sauce.  This will definitely be a regular in our house as it was a hit with our entire family.

I have reviewed this recipe before, it is now a part of our regular rotation.  I just wanted to add that my family rarely bothers with ribs BUT we put a whole cow into the freezer every year and that means that we get a lot of stewing beef.  Our latest cow was elderly and VERY poorly butchered!  I have manually tenderized and marinated round steak and had it still too tough to chew. This recipe makes it quite edible. I wasn't certain whether even this cooking method was good enough to tenderize that beef, and it was. That's my tip, we use this for stewing beef (very poor cuts) and it is delicious!        I do cut the soy sauce.  It's too salty for us, but other than that I follow the recipe.

This was AWESOME! My husband and son area always very suspicious when I make new dishes but this one won them over! I substituted 2 tablespoons of Pampered Chef's Rosemary Herb Seasonings for the dried seasonings listed in the recipe and it still was excellent! I'll never make ribs any other way!

Wonderful recipe made just as written.  Adult son (the biggest critic of ribs I know) was wowed saying "don't loose this recipe", and the rest of the family loved them as well.  I used beef short ribs. Definitely a 5+!

My latin honey LOVED these ribs! I did cut down on the soy sauce. Can't figure out why my garlic burned and I never got the brown bits. But they were still very good. Will definitley keep trying till I figure out what I am doing wrong.

Ok, the only things I did different is I used about 4 TBS of jarred chopped garlic and country style ribs and boiled in a stockpot. I used about 3 lbs since that is the amount of meat usually needed to feed our large family. And it took over 1 1/2 hrs to boil down even after pouring some water (and sadly some seasonings) off. I give this  4 1/2 stars but my family said 3-4... They loved the flavor but DH and son like their meat well done and dry.... so I think I will try the spareribs next time. We did not find it salty at all but we use the korean soy sauce (DH is 1/2 korean)  So maybe there is a difference?? But also wanted to mention that over reviews said theirs was dry but if you use meat that was frozen and thawed in microwave the meat is usually a bit tougher. Loved the parsley and I can not live without LIME!! This will be made again and just make a few adjustments. Thanks for this recipe!!!

Absolutely fantastic.  I used bone in country style pork ribs, took a little longer to reduce the water but well worth the wait.  Didn't want to poor off any of those great flavors, and makes a great reduction for coating the ribs at the end.

It took over an hour to cook these ribs and when they were done they were tough and dry.The flavor combination was excellent so I will certainly use it again but I don't think I'll use the cooking method.

These were good, but heed the advise of others and reduce the soy sauce by half or more. I used pork riblets and it took about an hour for the water to completly evaporate. Next time I'll use a more meatier rib and 1/8c. of soy.

I have used this recipe multiple times now for guests and everyone LOVES it!!  I do use less Soy sauce and I add cilantro. It definitely takes much longer than stated in the recipe.  I think it depends on how much water and what type of pot you have.  It usually takes me about 2-2.5 hours for one rack of ribs, but it is so worth it!!  the ribs fall right off the bone.  I am making them right now for some relatives coming over later.  I can't wait to eat them!

Oh, these are delicious. Okay, I followed the recipe exactly, except I used fresh cilantro. We in Texas us cilantro in everything, so why not? It was soooo good. I used baby back ribs, but I think any pork ribs will work.

This is super delicious my family loves it!!  It does take much longer than called for to boil the water down so make sure to only barely cover the ribs with water.  Do use low sodium soy sauce because this can taste salty.  Very easy and delicious!

Cooking time is wrong.  It took 3 hrs for all the liquid to boil out.  The taste is nothing special, just salty meat.

The ONLY thing I changed was that I used half as much soy sauce as was called for, since I'm really sensitive to salty tastes anyway, and I forgot to put in the garlic till halfway through, but I don't think it made a difference. These were some of the BEST ribs I've ever had!

This is an excellent dish.  I don't change anything in it but I am one to just throw things together instead of measuring.  I make this often and actually am online now to send this recipes to several people where I work.  [brought it for lunch and heard lots of oohs and ahhs after sharing].  Thank you so much!  I will try this recipe with chicken soon.

This dish was fantastic!  I made it for my husband and our friend and, both said it was restaurant quality food!  I had to omit the Bay Leaves, simply because I had none,so I subsituted Marjoram and Thyme. I also reduced the Soy Sauce(I had to use half Soy, half Worcester Sauce since I had only a bit of Soy) to 1/4 C but, next time I will reduce that in half.  I found it a bit salty but, the Men loved it!  I also found that the cooking time is more true to 1 1/4- 1 1/2 hours for the water to reduce but, I think the longer it simmers, the better it tastes!  The ribs were still incredibly moist.  Thanks to all of the advice from previous reviewers!  Your tips were definatley considered and used!  Will absolutley be making again

I have made these many times! and did not change the recipe at all! I usually tweak recipes, but not this one! 
 I do however use beef country style type ribs and the pot that I use to cover the ribs takes over an hour to boil. but that's okay because they almost melt in your mouth!
 I'm going to try chicken this week and see if my family prefers the ribs or the chicken :-)

LOVED these ribs!  It took about 1 hour for liquid to evaporate.  I used recipe exactly as listed except I made it with 14 ribs instead of 10.  This is a keeper.

Made this last night for supper. Followed the recipe exactly. It did take about 2 hours for the liquid to reduce, but I think I used too much water and turned the heat down too low. The ribs were perfect! A nice change from the usual ketchup based barbeque sauced pork ribs. The thickened "sauce" in the bottom of the pan was really good over rice. Will definitely make again!

Delicious and so simple.  Like the other reviews, it did take longer for all the water to evaporate.  I cooked my pork side ribs in a large skillet on high and it took approx. 45 minutes.  I didn't have some of the ingredients, so I used lemon juice and dried parsley.  It was still great.  Next time I'll try fresh limes.  This ones a keeper.

Oh my GOODNESS!  These are delicious.  I used about 3 1/2 lbs. of boneless country style ribs.  Other than that, I followed the recipe as it is except, I used Italian parsley and we didn't season them with pepper (no need to).  It took about 2 hrs. for my water to evaporate, but well worth the wait.  I was skeptical about how good these would taste as I am not a big fan of oregano and don't cook with rosemary very often.  I'm glad I took the chance.  My teenage son said they were delicious, he really liked the seasoning on them and had 3 servings.  A must keep.  Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.  I would have never come up with this on my own.

I LOVED this!!! Great flavors and this cooking method really kept my ribs very moist and tender! The only thing I had to change was that I did have to drain some of the liquid myself from time to time, or I would have had to cook it forever. Thanks very much for a great recipe!

This is an awesome recipe. Thankyou for sharing. I did reduce the amount of soy used to a 1/4 cup and added a 1/3 cup of red wine. It took the water about 1hr 30min to cook down to a 1/4 which was fine because the meat just fell off the bone. I then marinated it with hickory barQ sauce and baked it for 20min along with some red potatoes which i soaked in the pot. It turned out delicious and tonight i'm trying it out on pork chops.

A little too salty. I'll use less soy next time or use lower sodium soy. Definitly worth playing with the recipe to get the taste to exactly where you want it! Yum! Thanks for sharing.

I love the smell of this cooking! I tried it with Chicken, it didnt work as well... I used boneless country ribs. The 2nd time I made this, I mixed up about 1/4 cup ketchup and brown sugar and added it to the pot as well (home made BBQ sauce) added a sweetness to it and I cut the soy sauce in half, it was a little bit salty for my family. All the teens that were at the house ate everything! That was a treat to see!!

My wife and I loved this recipe because it was so different from the way we usually enjoy ribs. 1/3 the soy sauce and low sodium was still a salty dish but excellent. After the two hours it took to evaporate the water, ours turned out more like pulled pork but we will definitely use this again!

It did take a lot longer to boil out the water than 25 minutes, even on high on my stove, (about 1 hour) but it was well worth the wait. Tasty, tender, yum!

This is one of the best recipes for meat ever!  I tried it the first time with ribs and even though I almost burned them they still tasted awsome!  The next time in one week I used chicken and it was just as good. You are crazy to not try it at least once!

Thank you very much for sharing this wonderful recipe. I'm making another batch of this for supper tonight. This has become a favorite in our household. The flavors are great and the meat is so tender. Perfect for my 94-year old grandfather and 4 year old son because it's easy for them to eat. Like the other reviewers, I also used less soy sauce. I usually put the soy sauce, lime juice and a splash of my favorite honey-lemon mix into a bowl, do a taste test then add the mixture to the pot. Oh, I also add more garlic just because we can never have enough garlic in our dishes. Supper is going to be a hit again tonight, that's for sure.

Tender & tasty. my husband was requesting to have it again within 2 bites! An easy recipe with awesome results!  i made this using just under 2lbs of bnls sliced pork ribs.  i added half of a small onion (diced), used about 1/2 tsp dried of each spice + basil. we aren't too keen on soy sauce so again I only used about 1/2 a tsp.

I've giving this a five because the taste was terrific and want others to try this. The cooking instructions were for 25 minutes but it took me 1hr. 15 mins. to cook away the liquid. That is a BIG difference when you are trying to plan a meal.  I was prepared for that since so many people had the same comment.  This recipe needs some fixing but thanks anyway - a great and different way to cook ribs.

This recipe is absolutely YUMMY just as written.  Because of other reviews, I used only 1/3 cup soy sauce. I already had parsley so I used that instead of cilantro. Everything else was done
verbatim.  Be sure to use the lime/juice.  Will use this for company!  Thanks.

These ribs were full of flavor and very good.  I didn't have any lime so I used lemon instead.  I also added flour to the pan to make a sauce for the ribs and served with buttered noodles.  I used country ribs (boneless) and it took about 1 1/2 to 2 hours for the ribs to cook down.  I will definitely make this recipe again.  I think I will try grilling and also in the pressure cooker as mentioned in another review.  Thanks for sharing!  :D

I'm boiling these right now, and had to give a "5" for the great smell in my house!  If they end up tasting half as good as they smell, this will be one of the best rib recipes I've ever made.  Such an easy way to fix ribs in the summer without heating the house up with the oven.  Thank you!

This was an outstanding pork recipe that was so easy to cook.  I was afraid to use all 10 cloves of garlic, but am glad that I did.  The taste was excellent (not overpowering) and the ribs turned out fork-tender.  Do not change a thing.  I had extra sauce left over when cooking my ribs, so I reserved it and served it over wild rice with dinner.  Even my finicky eaters went back for seconds.  I should have doubled or even tripled the recipe.

Very tasty.  Used 1/3 cup soy and lemon juice instead of lime.  We browned them on the BBQ instead of in the pot.  I will make these again.

I put all in a crock pot all day.  Then, near serving time, I dumped all into an electric skillet and boiled out the water, and browned.  YUMMY!

We LOVED this recipe.  We've had it once a week for the last 3 weeks.  In fact, I just got done eating it!  It is very tasty and juicy.  I can't wait to have it again.

This was easy to prepare and the whole house smelled so good while it was simmering.  I did let it simmer for two hours and couldn't wait to let all the water boil down; they were sooooo good.
Even our 12 yr. old neighbor ate them!
Would also make this for company!

Thanks!

Great!  I got tired of waiting for it to cook down so I ended up putting it all in the pressure cooker!  Boy, talk about FALL OFF THE BONE!  Aslo, I doubled the soy and herbs/spices because I had about 2-3X too many ribs.  I will make this againi!

LOVE this recipe.  Cooking time varies depending on the size and shape of your pot.  I figure on 40 minutes for my dutch oven.  I like that it's really salty, but you could use sodium-reduced soy sauce if that's an issue for you.

The aroma that this dish created in the kitchen made my family excited to enjoy it. The only problem I stumbled on was my water-to-pork ratio. I followed the directions and covered the pork with water, but I had too much.  My port ended up a little dry, but will definitely try it again. I managed to salvage some of the water and soy sauce mixture from the pot and simply created an au-jus for the dish.  That helped. We enjoyed it with some roasted asparagus and corn. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

I loved trying a new recipe and cooking method, and while my family thought the pork was delicious, I found it a little dry and tough. I think I will give it at least one more try to see if I can get it better with practice because it was such a huge hit with my family.

I used fresh parsley - if I had added cilantro, my husband would have ordered a pizza. :) Also, like other reviewers have warned, you have to watch that water like a hawk once it gets really low. Otherwise, before you know it, it will boil away and start to burn.

I made these because my fiancee bought pork riblets (despite the fact that I have no love for pork). It took longer than 25 minutes for the water to boil off, but once it did, the meat was tender. I substituted dry parsley for the fresh sprigs, and I had no bay leaves on hand. The flavor was still nice, and the pork-lover enjoyed the meal. It did not, however, change my mind about this kind of meat.

Awesome, awesome!!! Like a previous poster, I was skeptical of this recipe, but it had so many great reviews that I had to try. The meat was so tender and flavorful...this is a real keeper. The only thing I'll do differently next time is cut down just a little bit on the soy sauce and lime juice (my lime was EXTRA juicy!)...but just by a smidgeon...not even enough to consider giving this recipe any less that FIVE stars! Thanks so much!

I also altered this because I didn't quite have everything in my kitchen, though I would have loved to try this as it was written. I had 5 pounds of rib tips, so they've been boiling for over 2 hours- this makes them impossible to brown but very very good. I used half soy sauce and half lite teriyaki. I added sea salt (it's mild) to taste and a little season salt. I also put in apple cider vinegar in place of citrus. I didn't have any lime juice or cilantro.

I made these last night and for the life of me I don't know why I waited so long. I have been looking at this recipe for at least 3 months. These were awesome. All the little tidbits scraped up from the bottom of the pan were flavorful and crunchy. I cut a slab of baby back ribs into individual ribs and I cooked them very slowly on the stovetop for about an hour and a half. They melted in your mouth. Only 3 ribs left in the fridge. I can't wait to see how they taste on Day 2. Make these!

These ribs were delicious! I used a little less of the soy sauce. As others have suggested the water on it is a little too much if you completely cover them, so use a little less. They also take longer than it says in the recipe. My whole family loved it though and will probably make it again.

I thought this was an okay recipe - maybe because I actually like salty food. If you don't, then I suggest that you cut down on the amount of soy sauce you use.  I used La Choy lite soy sauce and still it was a bit too salty - even for my tastes. My ribs did come out very tender, but they did not have enough flavor for me to try this again.

Definitely reduce the soy sauce.

I used 1/2 cup of low sodium and it was far far too salty.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS! Loved by the entire family. Husband commented he hoped they tasted as good as they smelled, and we were not disapointed. Used boneless country ribs, 1/4 cup of soy sauce, as some suggested, and cilantro instead of parsley. Also used a large pan so the ribs fit the bottom as one layer. Took about 50 minutes for the water to completely evaporate and another 5 min to brown. Will try using chicken next week. Definately passing this one on the family and friends.

My husband, 5 year old, and I loved it! (3 year old hasn't been in to meat lately and my 5 year old is super picky with meat)  It did take longer than the directions but I believe it's because I was simmering at too low of a temperature.  Once I turned it up the water started going down faster. I used dried parsley, minced garlic, and bottled lime juice instead of what was called for.

I replaced lime juice (due to having none in store) with 3 fresh Kaffir Lime tree leaves and the taste was sensational. 

I kept the Kaffir Lime leaves whole, and removed them at the same time I removed the Bay leaves.

I also cooked this lot in a lidded  Wok. Put the skin side down - as I found I overcooked the meat

I was skeptical about the results this recipe would make but it was DELICIOUS! The only differences were that I only had 8 ribs and no oregano other than that I made it as written.  It did take about an hour longer than what was stated for the evaporation but I anticipated this being a possibility based on other reviews.  I think the issue with this discrepancy may be two food, first the type of simmer, is it a slow simmer or a fast one? Second everyone's stove simmer at different temps. Some have gas and can only go so low others electric who may have an actual simmer setting. Just my thoughts either way this is fabulous. The depth of flavor outstanding.  Be sure to cook it until the liquid evaporates but before it burns it is where the flavor intensifies. Thanks for sharing your mother's recipe it's now our family's favorite too.

I don't make my ribs any other way anymore. Genius recipe and so easy. Just requires a lot of time. I make them in a wider pan so that the water evaporates faster. And if I am cooking for big groups I try and boil it down to almost done and turn off the burner before guests arrive so that at the last minute I can summer up the final bits and reheat. Otherwise sometimes it takes longer than you want. 

Great to make in winter when your house can use extra heat and humidity.

These are AMAZING....Every Time!
Everyone who comes in while they're cooking, goes wild from the smell alone!  Then, when they take the first, juicy, delicious bite, they are in love...raving about the flavor!
I was never a ribs person, and don't even know how I stumbled upon this, but SO happy I did.
And I add mushrooms to the pot, during last 10 minutes and it is to die for!
It's now a family/friends favorite!

This was a pretty dope technique for cooking ribs—got great color and a sort of glazed effect, not to mention the flavor. I confess, I doubled the soy sauce by accident (cooking country ribs in two different pots and got mixed up) and so it was extra salty. I ended up adding honey to cut the salt which turned out to be something rather tasty. The leftovers ended up as some bomb fried rice later in the week. Would recommend to a friend, especially one who follows recipes better than I do. Don’t double the soy sauce.  100% will make again.

I made changes to the recipe because I didn't have parsley nor rosemary. I omitted the rosemary, replace parsley with cilantro. Reduced the soy sauce to 1/4 cup. 
Delicious! Perhaps I will reduce the soy sauce to 3_Tbs because I need to reduce my sodium intake.

It was very good-- the meat was tender and flavorful, BUT--I cooked one slab of St. Louis style ribs cut into 5 sections in a dutch oven (on the stove) and it took nearly 3 hours to reduce. It ate more like a succulent pork roast.

I’ve made this recipe many times now, and it’s absolutely perfect as described originally. I think the big mistake other reviewers made was using a TALL pot rather than a WIDE one. I put all my ribs in a single layer in a 12 inch fry pan and let it cook down. It will sometimes  take longer than 1 hour to cook, but they end up coming out perfect every time!

We followed the directions closely, substituting only dried parsley for the fresh. It was very good. Nice and tender, flavorful. A little salty, would lessen the soy sauce next time.

Great recipe, I used coconut aminos instead of soy sauce, and cilantro because that was what I had.  Served with sweet potato noodles and broccoli. Very tasty!  Since I had boneless country ribs I had more water to cover them and so it took longer to evaporate the water, about twice as long but it was definitely worth it.
  I used some baking soda to clean the pot with water  boiling for easy clean up.

Yum. I’ve never boiled meat before so I didn’t know what to expect. It was superb - moist and so flavourful. A tad salty, next time I’ll use low sodium soy sauce, or just less of it. Also I’ll need a better hood fan before I do this again - everything in the house smelled like ribs for two days!

This recipe was worth trying, the meat was very tender but too 'limey' and salty, even when reduced to 1/3 cup.   Might try again, reducing the lime and soy sauce.

I made these and they were wonderful, I don`t think i will ever spend hours making ribs again. I did take them out of the water after an hour and finish them on a hot grill outside. No one would ever know I had not spent all day smoking them, They had a nice char  with grill marks and very tender.

Will certainly make again!  Tip; use turkey baster to extract excess water and speed up reduction if taking too long.  Well worth the wait!

I made these for my husband and daughter who love ribs. When my hubby saw them simmering on the stove, he didn't think they'd be good ....but kept his mouth shut. After he tried them, he couldn't stop raving about them, and so I had to try one. It was awesome. This is so easy and so yummy, you'd be crazy not to try it. Note that the simmering took longer for me (about an hour) which, in the end, I think made the ribs more tender. And I didn't have fresh parsley on hand so I used about a tablespoon of dried parsley which worked fine. Highly recommend this recipe!

We don't do BBQ ribs at our house because of this recipe. We ONLY make ribs using this recipe at least once a week. My 15 year old son likes these ribs so much that he's learned to make them himself. There's no way to mess this up. GREAT RECIPE! We change it a bit by  adding half an onion finely chopped in my mini 6 cup Quisinart blender. We then add a lot more of everything but go a little more than half of what the recipe calls for on soy sauce. We have added the juice of five limes and we double (almost triple) the ingredients for a rack of ribs (all except the garlic) so that when it cooks down there's this unbelievably good tasting mixture at the bottom that is wonderful tasting.. It's enough for us to put over rice and as an added tasty finish to the ribs. If you want to do this, you must add the finely chopped onion I mention above to give the mixture some thickness. It can take an hour for our ribs to cook down in a short wide pot. A high pot won't do these ribs justice. Watch them closely because they can go from a little liquid to burned very quickly. When the liquid gets low, leave the ribs in and move them constantly while they brown and the ingredients form a nice mix at the bottom of the pan. The patience to let the ingredients carmelize at the bottom of the pan puts this recipe over the top. You've got to let ALL of the liquid cook off or you'll miss the best parts of this dish. We don't have charred ribs, but we cook until there is no liquid. Just keep them mo

I have made this a few times . Initially I stuck to the recipe and process and it turned out well. I then did the initial braze/boil and finished them on the grill for a nice char. This is a solid recipe and it will stay in my recipe box.

Delicious and tender. Used almost 4 lbs country style ribs. Used full amount of soy sauce, but low sodium. A little extra herbs just because, but followed recipe otherwise. Served with cabbage and onion lightly cooked in butter and salt and pepper. This is   a wonderful combination as the flavors of the meat compliment the cabbage.Excellent  recipe in every way.

I finally made good ribs!!! YAY!  I put too much water so just took it out of the juice as soon as the rest of my dinner was almost done, covered them in a bbq sauce I love and baked 325 for 15. Perfect!! Yummo!  Fallin' off the bone, very flavorful spareribs. I'm so grateful

I curled the ribs around the inside of the pot and turned it over half-way through. Because of this I had to used quite a bit of extra water, but didn't fill it all the way to the top of the ribs. I wasn't able to evaporate all the water by the end (and I'm honestly not quite sure how long I cooked it for--a while!) but I used the extra water solution to baste the ribs while searing them on the grill. Turned out fantastic!

These were delicious! You weren't kidding about the juiciness by golly. I didnt have any parsley at home, but even without it this recipe has became a favorite already! Only thing i will be doing differently next time is go a /little/ easier on the water. Hopefully that wont affect the outcome of the actual food, i just want to reduce the cook time as it took nearly an hour to cook off the water instead of 25 minutes. Will be repeating very soon.

Fall off the bone and mild salty taste.  Next time, not 2" of water, but 1" in the dutch oven and reduced sodium soy for sure.  You can't get involved in a movie with these.  You have to be there when the water has boiled away, obviously.  This looked like a shorter cook time than other rib recipes but it isn't really.  Lots of prep, and 2 hours on the stove.

Way too salty--use less Soy sauce, or a low-sodium one. Otherwise perfectly tender and tasty! Smells awesome while it cooks.

New family favorite! Made it as written but cooked it on high heat until all the liquid boiled away- about 40 min. The fat renders from the pork so essentially you are frying in the pork fat after water boils away. Similar method to chiccarones. I would reduce the soy sauce as recommended by others as it was a bit salty for our palates. Otherwise, very tasty! Served with steamed veggies and spinach and feta rice pilaf.

We loved the flavor!! I substituted cilantro for the parsley and skipped the rosemary and bay leaf (had none) and it was wonderful. Will definitely make this again for ribs (and for other meats as well)!

Excellent ribs, really easy recipe to follow, really tasty and tender.  I had the ribs cut in smaller pieces - I really think these ribs would be great as finger food at a party but for overall rib eating, I prefer tomato-ey based ribs.  Thank you to the poster.

Will definitely make it again. Next time however I will use less soy sauce as I found it a bit salty when it was all reduced. I might consider using balsamic vinegar instead of the soy sauce and have that reduce. Otherwise it was super tender and flavorful.

Made this using chicken.  Very good.  Reduced soy sauce to 1/4 cup.  Next time will reduce a little more.  Still, very tasty. All eaters enjoyed this.  Paired with broccoli and yeast rolls.  Yum!  Thanks for sharing.

WOW! This recipe surprised me but I was happy to at least try making pork ribs another way besides with BBQ sauce. And man....was I super happy with results! Very very tasty and tender. I didn't have parsley so I used cilantro and paired ribs with a basic chopped green salad with cherry tomatoes, red onion, cilantro and homemade cilantro dressing. All is can say is YUMMY!! Will definitely make again!

My son and I were studying Brazil and looking for new foods to try. He is 8 and very picky. Studying different countries has proven to be very effective in getting him to eat new things. He loved these ribs! (and so did the rest of the family.) It is a new favorite.

I've made these for years now.  My family and friends love them.  Always a hit!  Be careful on the amount of soy sauce you use, it can be extremely salty.  Once pork is about done (water almost gone), I squeeze more lime over top.  Gives it an extra "pop".  Goes great with Jamaican "rice and peas".  Next time, I think I am going to try with chicken.  The pork is great just want to change it up a little.

my husband gave this a 8/10. I enjoyed this dish. It is the best for satisfying a craving for pork ribs when you do  not have a BBQ grill.

OMG these are great! However it took about and hour, which was fine because the meat fell off the bones.

I made these this recipe using boneless pork ribs. I used reduced sodium soy sauce and left out the bay leaves because I didn't have any. DELICIOUS!  This recipe is definitely a "keeper"!

I used 3lb of St. Louis style ribs and boiled in a Dutch oven.  I didn't have limes so I used bottled lemon juice and freeze dried cilantro instead of parsley.  1/2 cup of low sodium soy sauce worked out well.  It actually took 2.5 hours to boil the water down, but that was fine since it made the ribs tender.  They were delicious and I plan to make them again, such a simple recipe with lots of flavor.

Good premise but found it had way too much soy sauce. Came out strong and salty. Added honey and ketchup to balance the soy sauce. Will cut soy to less than half next time and use low sodium.

First pass was way too salty for me, but tasty so we ate them all anyway. Next time I will use half the soy (a quarter cup only), thanks for the recipe :)

used the recipe on some boneless pork ribs.  Realized it was very similar to a pork chop recipe my mom used to make that also had Dijon mustard so I added 2 tsp of same, and some Tabasco buffalo sauce to give it some zing.  Definitely a keeper!

Thank you! I make this often exactly as you have written it.  I do have to in the last ten minutes crank up the heat to reduce rapidly and create the glazed effect on the ribs I'm after.  While doing this I just keep flipping the ribs and using them to deglaze the pan. When I'm not making BBQ oven ribs or grilled ribs THIS is the only way I now make them because my family actually begs for them...my daughter l literally gets giddy and excitedly claps. There is SO much flavor so thank you so very much.

This recipe inspired me to do it this way: I brought to a boil then simmered til tender, about an hour. Then basted with bbq sauce and broiled it until caramelized.

This was good.  It was juicy and not too salty.  I left it in the pot I cooked it in, then put it in the fridge for leftovers.  It gets better each day & the broth is really great with some hearty bread.  I didn't have lime juice so I used a little juice from a jar of banana pepper rings.

Oh Yummy! I think this will become my new staple rib recipe. I put too much water in, which then didn't all boil off. Finished the ribs under the broiler to brown them up a bit more.

The recipe was great.  My husband said they were the best pork ribs I ever made.  He doesn't even care for pork ribs.  The ribs took a lot longer to boil than 25 min and I also put them in the oven at 325 for 10 minutes with barbecue sauce on them.  I turned them and put more barbecue sauce on them and cooked for 5 more minutes.  They were really good.

very good , I didn't add the soysauce I did put a couple table spoons or red cooking wine and when the water was evaporating I sprinkled the slightest bit of flour on each side to get a nice brown crunch.

This is a great recipe.  You can put your own seasoning twist on it.  The first time I did it, I followed the recipe and it was wonderful, but the real point is the method.

I didn't have, or buy, the bay leaves so they weren't used. 
Aside from this is followed the recipe very closely.
HOLY MOTHER OF GOD THIS WAS AMAZING

I made these last night & followed the recipe as written. After 25 min the ribs were still almost covered in water. I took out one cup of the broth and substituted for one cup of water in my rice. The rice came out delicious. I did cook the ribs for 45 minutes not 25.There was still a little liquid after 45 minutes, and I served them that way. They were very tasty. I also used baby back ribs because that's what I had on hand. I didn't find them salty. I guess it's  because I'm Portuguese and we tend to eat our food a little on the salty side. I did add hot crushed pepper and my husband still added more. We like our food spicy.

These were very good and easy to make on the stove top versus a BBQ. There is something slightly lacking in the taste - not sure what. I've made them twice and family enjoys but I might tinker a bit more with them.  However, as start- very good!

This was a very tasty alternative to the way I've made ribs before. The boiling in the seasoned water did add flavor to the meat, and made the ribs very tender. I just took my best guess at the amount of seasoning to use since "10 pork spareribs" could vary greatly in size, and next time I think I'll go a little heavier on the lime. But the technique is very handy.

I don't think it could be better! My husband is a mean and potato man, and normally does the cooking. He asked if I could this afternoon as it is over a hundred here in East Texas, and this seemed the perfect answer. Boy, was it ever!  Glad our sons were not still living at home, we would not have had enough! Tell your mom, thanks! Might want to add a comment about it being a choice of using low sodium soy sauce to taste. Just a thought. It was great! Go Brazil!

This recipe really offers endless options of flavor combinations as well as choices of proteins.  You can use the technique on everything from ribs to chicken.  My favorite combination so far is boneless pork loin country style ribs with hard cider, whole grain mustard and a mix of spices.  I try to keep the total amount of liquid/sauce to one and a half cups or less.  This helps on keeping the cooking time down as well as using a wide pan.

This is an excellent recipe.  Prep is minimal and overall very easy to execute. My son just requested I make this for his 10th birthday dinner. The whole family loves it. I did find that it takes much longer for the liquid to cook down, but that just allows the meat to be more tender and falls right off the bone.

Made these tonight - super yum! Loved the method, so easy and they turned out perfect. I marinated my ribs in the mixture (minus the water) for about an hour and added liquid smoke to them too and I think I probably had 3x the ribs, recipe calls for 10 I probably had 30... Such a different coating, very herby! I also used 1/4 cup of soy sauce as other users suggested, no issues with salt.  But perhaps too as I had so many more ribs, it became diluted between them.

My husband said this was the recipe to go to for spare ribs in our house. It was very delicious and I prefer this style than BBQ ribs.  I omitted rosemary since I do not care for the flavor.

These weren't as good as I thought they would be with all the great reviews.  They were too salty and I only used 1/3 cup soy sauce and they took an hour to boil down.  I think it's easier to put a dry rub on the ribs and slow roast them in the oven - they don't turn out as greasy as they do with this method with them swimming in grease.

My son, who could eat a whole rack of ribs at the age of 12 said these were the best ribs he's every had.  I didn't have all the ingrediants-no rosemary but everything else & followed the directions exactly.  They are the best.  Never thought stove top ribs could be so good!  I have made these at least 6 times & the only time they weren't the best was when I used boneless ribs.  Need to be bone in for sure.  Excellent recipe!

This has become a family favorite. I am lucky to get a couple for myself before my son devours them. The aroma fills the house and puts you in the mood long before they're ready. The only change I made was to use light soy. Otherwise, I make it as written. Thanks for sharing this.

I find myself using this recipe all of the time. My fam loves it!!! The only thing that I do differently is to add BBQ sauce and put it into the oven on 350 degrees for about 30-45 mins. The meat comes out soooo tender with a lot of flavor.

This recipe is beyond delicious.  It is super easy and budget friendly!!!  My favorite online recipe to date.  I followed the recipe but reduced the amount of soy sauce based on other reviews.  Also, I was not at all sure about the boiling method, especially with such a cheap cut of meat.  However, I gave it a try and love the results.  It takes some patience to get the water to cook off.  It took me about 40 min total using approx 2 cups of water for 10 ribs.  Then the ribs browned in this yummy sauce that is seriously finger licking good!.  I can't wait to make it again!!!!

This was okay.  Too much oregano and the meat seemed dry to me.  I used Country Style Ribs.  I have much better recipes for these, so probably won't make again.

This is a great recipe, very easy with a lot of flavor.  However, it makes MUCH longer than 25 mins for the water to evaporate.  My ribs cooked well over 1.5 hours.  Next time I'm going to add less water.

I'm with everyone else......took forever for the water to boil down - like almost three hours.  I cut the recipe in half for just two people.  Wondering why it took me so much longer.  With that said ...... FABULOUS.  If I had ordered these from a restaurant, I'd be back as often as possible.    What I did was pour off some of the broth after a long time and set it aside.  As the ribs started to brown, I drizzled some of the broth over them to keep them moist.  I didn't have bay leaves at home, so can't imagine how much better they could be with those.  Made some mashed potatoes and used some of the leftover broth as gravy.  Yummy, yummy, yummy.  Thanks to "Mom" for the recipe.

OMG, followed the recipe exactly, sort of. Didn't have limes, will try next time. Used country spare ribs, didn't chop up the parsley, didn't know if I should, used the whole 10 sprigs, forgot to only use 3/4 of them so had none for the end, which didn't seem to matter. My husband who is a big traditional country boy, loves his ribs and barbecue, absolutely thought it was the best thing he's ever eaten. Even though he hates rosemary and with an entire tablespoon I really thought he would hate this. But he loved it. The aroma as it was all boiling was awesome. Now I have to say, it took forever for the liquid to boil down but it was worth waiting for. I kept scaping and turning the meat at the end to help it all dry out. I would also like to add that they were very salty and I used low sodium soy sauce, but other that that they were so good but definitely not low-cal.

Very flavorful. We enjoyed them but they were much more dry than I would have guessed. However, we've had the same country ribs prepared several different ways and they would sometimes come out dry too.

Tried it with cut up pork roast and it was delicious. I was afraid it would be dry so after browning the meat I added some water and corn starch to make a sauce.  With some added salt it was fine but it would have been fine without the sauce, meat was tender and juicy.

After 2 1/2 hours, there was still soooo much liquid left in the pan, and the ribs were just boiled lumps of meat.  My husband took the meat and a bit of the liquid and cooked it in the pressure cooker for 20 minutes, while cooking down the remaining liquid.  It was more like pulled pork at this point, but absolutely delicious.  I did use half the soy sauce called for but also added some amino acids, which added a good flavor.

First, this is a quick and foolproof way to cook ribs, even on a work night.  I tried this recipe last night and got mixed reviews.  My wife and I both liked them, but I was a bit overwhelmed by the salt!  The ribs were tender, moist, and tasted good, but again, the taste was overwhelmed by the soy sauce.  I will try again, and seek some way to instill flavor without the salt.

This was an excellent recipe, thank you. I don't have a natural talent for cooking so I deeply appreciate this website and  wonderful dishes I'm able to make. My only comment is that it takes longer than 25 minutes for the water to totally evaporate but the ribs are so flavorful you know it's well worth it! This is one of my faves!!!

I made this with 6 Country Style ribs.  It took much longer than 25 minutes for the water to boil away (over an hour), although it's possible I was a bit to liberal in my interpretation of "just covered with water".  It was definitely worth the wait however, as the meat was very flavorful and moist - very delicious.

These were delicious!!! Followed almost exact but with fresh Rosemary. Used skillet and it still took about an hour to boil off the water. Flavor was awesome, sauce elegant. Husband likes lots, too. Thanks for the recipe!!!

Fabulous! I changed the serving size to 5.Followed recipe,just added some diced sweet onions.Water did not completely evaporate,so i took the out boiled ribs and drained the water,then browned with the left over garlic,onions and spices.It was way better then i expected!! Super tender and not salty like other people have stated in their comments. Next time at the end im going to try searing them on the grill,and maybe pull them apart and make bbq pull pork sandwiches for the superbowl. Thank you so much for this!!

The ribs are very flavorful!  I made the mistake of starting in a stock pot, which was too much water.  Use a large saute pan (approx 5 qt)instead.  Other than it taking too long to cook, because I used the wrong size pan.... the ribs were wonderful as written.  I made no adjustments to the recipe.

My Wife was DUBIOUS and skeptical about spices - -Especially Soy Sauce - We did reduce to 1/2 the recipe on Soy Sauce - - BUT results were outstanding.  deglazed pan with chicken broth and thickened to make Gravy for rice. served with rice, corn on cob and asparagus. OUTSTANDING, Definite Keeper.  Oh yes, took 90 minutes to cook water off,  well worth the wait.

I have never left a review even though I have enjoyed many good recipes.  However, my 15-year-old son, who does not like ribs, RAVED about this recipe!!  I truly did not think this recipe could possibly be good, but by golly, it is awesome!  Easy to make, and wonderful flavor.  Thanks so much for sharing this!

My mother used to boil (simmer, really) ribs (and chicken) before barbecuing.  It cooked the meat properly and ensured that the barbecuing step was faster and less prone to burning.  Oh, and people from Brasil love salt.  That's just the way they roll.

I have not tried the recipe..I will as soon as I can get my hands on some ribs, as I know from many years of using this method (my mother's) of doing pot roasts. It makes heavenly pot roasts with the best gravy from the brown sludge in the bottom of the pot. Try it !! Works with different kinds of meat.

loved the flavors!!  only reason i am giving it four stars is because there isnt enough meat on the bones that was edible.  using the same exact recipe, i think that next time i will sear the ribs then throw it all into the slow cooker to get the meat super tender.

This was great.  Like some of the others, the water took a long time to boil down.  In the end, I ended up adding corn starch and making a gravy out of the bottom inch or so of liquid.  Delicious!

Great recipe! Spareribs were on sale, but hubby isn't a big fan of bbq sauce, but I remembered seeing this recipe, so I tried it. I am sooo glad that I did! The ribs had such great flavor and they fell right off the bone they were so tender. There was still a lot of liquid after an hour, so I strained out some of it and used it to cook up some rice. The rice was amazing as well! I can't wait to try this with other meats. Thanks for the recipe!

Turned out really well and everybody loved it!  Although I did accidentally add too much Soy sauce (cap fell off while pouring...) but it still turned out great.  I should mention that it took longer then it says to boil off the water.

Don't know that this is my favorite method to cook up ribs. Number 1 is the length of time to boil off the stock. On med it took more like 60-90 min. In the end, had to put it on highest temp and then dump out the remainder of the liquid.   Flavour was good, tenderness was ok - just not as good as oven or slow cooker.

This was pretty good... nice blend of flavours; I'd be tempted to jazz it up next time but, all in all, pretty darn good...especially considering that it's a quick cook.

Really good, took about 1.5 hours for the water to boil off though.

Followed the recipe exactly. Unfortunately, after 1 1/2 hours the ribs were still very raw.  No water an raw ribs...put them in the oven, but they still didn't cook.  However, I must say the flavor was really tasty.  I might try recipe again on chicken or another cut of meat.
