I've been looking for years for a recipe for a cake made with yeast, longing to replicate one we used to get all the time from the bakery in the Polish neighborhood where my father lived. I was so excited when I found this one, but alas, this came out more like a heavy bread than a cake. I think I'll try it again someday, using half the flour and double the milk. Also, the instructions say to "knead in as much air as possible," but as a cooking technique, kneading is about pushing air out, not incorporating it in. So I'm not sure what the author means by that. I think if this were more of a batter it might be a good recipe.

We have corrected the yeast amount to two (0.6-ounce) cakes of fresh yeast.

The cooks notes says the original recipe makes an 11x13 cake.  I believe this is a misprint.  Even at 11x15, there is more cake than others of this style.  I use a 12x18 sheet cake pan.

Good recipe, it came out nice! Two important points though: the amount of dough turns out to be enough for a cake amost double the size. As it is in the recipe it would overflow the tray and shed plums to the sides. Also: is it absolutely vital that an amount of milk/water is more precisely specified for the kneading phase. For a non-expert "as needed" doesn't make any sense, and the level of moisture achieved is critical for a good drozdz√≥wka, because if too dry it's miserable.
Ciao!
