Great idea for a healthy delicious meal. I sautéed a medley of vegetables(including potatos) and an estimation of spices and seasonings with a can of chicken broth before putting it the oven with the chicken. The thick delicate broth that condensed in the oven was perfect. I'll give that one a full 5 stars no problem.

Good flavor and I liked the concept, but the chicken cooked more quickly than the veggies. Veggies were too crunchy and needed to be cooked longer.

This is a great week night recipe. I sautéed the vegetables in a pan before I put everything in the oven. The vegetables had the right amount of tenderness. I will make this again.

This is a WINNER!!!!!
I wanted to get rid of a few tiny bags of left over veggies so I added the following: Zucchini, cappers, broccoli, sun dried tomatoes and sweet potatoes.  I also added one extra spice: Tumeric.  Like I said, this came out to a BIG #1 WINNER for me!  One other thing...I didn't sautéed anything. I threw everying in the baking pan and let the oven do the work.  Why bother with an extra pan to wash!

I followed the recipe as is and it was so good! Hubby's usual reply is "it's not bad" or "it's alright" but this time he said GREAT!! I never would have put those flavors together, but it works. I will definitely make this again.

This recipe was so easy and delicious! I served it with black rice, which has a richer nutty flavor that went well with the vegetable medley. If you like fresh veggies don't worry about sautéing first, I baked mine in the oven with the chicken and they turned out perfect!

Brine the chicken breasts in warm water and 1/8-1/4 cup kosher salt before baking.  The chicken falls apart.  I broiled on top of the veggies 5 min each side after cooked for 25 min.

Loved this recipe for a nice, fresh dish. I only had one pepper, so I substituted with 2 sweet potatoes sliced into 1/4" rounds. I also didn't have lemon pepper seasoning, so I just sprinkled some fresh lemon juice over everything before putting it in the oven. I also skipped the celery and parsley (not a fan of them both) and substituted sweet onions for the green onions. I had to use two baking sheets to fit the chicken and all the veggies. Next time I'll use parchment paper for an easier clean up.The chicken came out so tender and the vegetables were delicious. My family devoured everything!

Great recipe! My family asked that it be added to the regular rotation. Not hard at all and they liked the flavor. I think it will be even better the next time around.

This was delicious! I didn't have green onions on hand so used regular onions and crushed red pepper flakes. I also sautéed the veggies in chicken broth prior to adding the chicken. I will definitely make this again.

We loved it.  Very quick, easy and tasty, and  very low carb.  Veggies were a little tougher than I like.  I would bake them for 5 or 10 minutes before  adding the chicken net time.

Yes. But first of all it took about 15 minutes more, i.e. About 45 minutes total to be 90% well done 

Reason being I started with the chicken underneath the veggies for 20 minutes then switched them on top... 

Juicy, delicious and healthy... Or so I say :)

Bon appétit

This is one of my favorite recipes! I remove the skin and any visible fat from the chicken pieces (to cut down on the saturated fat) and I use the zest from a lemon, instead of the lemon pepper. This is a hearty,fresh tasting dish. For best results use only fresh, not frozen or dried, vegetables and parsley. YUM!

Tried this tonight, easy prep, great week night meal. I was out of Italian dressing, and it still came out delicious. Good combo of flavors, served the vegs over white rice. Hubby said he would very much like to have it again.

The only change I made was to salt the breasts 1/2 tsp Kosher salt per pound before starting to chop the veggies. Basically dry brined them for a half hour. I then of course left the salt out of the spice mix. Yum on this recipe.

We love this recipe!  The chicken comes out super juicy and flavorful... and the best part is how little time it takes.  I vary the vegetables and have also used broccoli and cauliflower.

Not sure what I was expecting, but this turned out fantastic! After reading several reviews, I did sauté the vegetables before adding them to the chicken. Will definitely make again.

I made this last night and it was delicious. I read a lot of other reviews and decided to do the chicken and the veggies separately due to the chicken getting done before the veggies were tender. I put all the veggies, including cut red potatoes, in a baggie with the seasonings and EVOO and then poured them into my 9X13 pan lined with parchment. I cooked them almost an hour before adding the spices to the chicken and put the chicken into my air fryer instead of with the veggies. Everything was soooo good. Will make many more times that same way. Thanks for the post.

I made this recipe i the crock pot and it was AMAZING.  I browned the breasts in olive oil  on the stove top first.  Then I diced and placed fresh celery on the bottom of the crock. I added frozen bell peppers, onions and broccoli Normandy.  I used two fresh cloves of garlic and fresh Italian herbs to top it off. Cooked on high for 4 hrs. and my boyfriend said  it was delicious.  I served it with wild rice , a basic salad and yeast rolls.

A quick and easy healthy dinner. I play around with different veggies, usually put the carrots and celery under the chicken to let them cook in the juices and make them more tender. Any veggies work with this, and you can play around with the seasoning too. I put Sriracha sauce on chicken and veggies sometimes, or  Italian dressing works too.

I really had low expectations as,celery and carrots  aren't my favorite vegetables. I must say that I was plesenty surprised. I made it as written .No changes  and it was delicious. The cooking time was closer to 40-45 because the four chicken beasts that I used were large(costco).I believe the extra cooking time made the vegetables come out perfectly. My adult son who used to feed his vegetables to the dog as a child ate all of them and raved about them..Will definitely make again. Delicious and healthy. Five stars

A really great light veggie and chicken good for you kind of meal.  The first time I made it I used the recommended veggies.  However, the second time I didn't have any peppers so I substituted brussel sprouts.  It tasted just as great!

I made this twice in one week, loved it. Tasted so fresh and healthy. The second time I made it however I added broccoli
and used petite baby carrots instead of fresh cut. The broccoli worked out perfect for the cooking time. The only reason I used the baby petite carrots was for the cooking time. With the fresh cut they did not get quite as soft as we like. Will make this many more times in the future.

Super simple, loved it
I pre heat a large saute pan and seared all sides of the chicken breasts until golden before putting on top of veggies and in to the oven.

Super quick, make the house smell awesome at dinner time when the family gets home for dinner.

Delicious! I cut the chicken breast into bite size. I then sauteed all the vegetables in olive oil and garlic, and added potatoes, and Brussel sprouts into the vegetable medley. In a separate bowl, I combine Olive Oil with my favorite spices and lemon zest. I coated the mixture evenly onto the sauteed vegetables and chicken. I baked in the oven for the suggested time and the vegetables and chicken cooked perfectly. The vegetables were tender and the chicken was juicy.

I used a bag of frozen stir fry vegetables and they were delicious and perfectly done!  I'll add 2 bags next time because I could have eaten just those veggies with the oil and seasonings!  I also did not have lemon pepper so I used some zest from a lemon I had and extra pepper.  Delicious!

I cooked the vegetables and breasts with bone in aluminum foil.  The vegetables were soft and delicious but the chicken was dry.  Three and half stars from me but just barely three from someone else.

Instead of green onions, I used a quarter of a sweet onion. After making it, I felt there were too many peppers in the recipe. Four peppers seems to overpower the taste. I would probably cut it down to one pepper. The chicken tasted good and I would make it again with the above changes.

Followed recipe except for using frozen peppers and starting veggies before adding chicken. Should have added a few more minutes for them. I cut chicken into thirds. The chili
Powder wasn't overwhelming and gave color to everything. Would be very adaptable with other veggies and seasonings. I'm renaming this Clean the Fridge Chicken.

I made this exactly as posted (almost) in the recipe, and this was delicious!  The only thing I changed was switched the green peppers to a variety of red, orange and yellow peppers.  My entire family loved it.  Healthy and flavorful.  This will be on our rotation.  Thank you!

I made mine with three boneless skinless turkey breasts, used red and yellow peppers, one medium sized onion, and cherry tomatoes instead for veggies. It turned out delicious! The turkey was cooked perfectly, very moist, and the cherry tomatoes burst in your mouth with flavour! I will use this recipe again.

I really wanted to like this...but it didn’t come out that great. I used brown rice which needed longer to cook, so the pork chops were very dry. Will try it again but will cook the brown rice first before I put it in the casserole.

Just as easy (or easier) than boxed dinners if you buy already cut veggies from the produce section and WAY healthier. Totally going to do again. Did have to bump up the temp and time a bit, but that might be my oven.

It is still a baked chicken dish, but I really like the veggies at the bottom. I would service with rice next time.

I used the veggies I had on hand. I didn't use the chili powder since the kids don't like anything spicy. This was wonderful and the chicken was so moist and tasty.

That. Was. Fantastic! Totally improvised it on the herbs - chili, oregano, poultry seasoning, garlic powder - and used carrots, yellow pepper, celery and green onions. Served on rice and we all loved it! So easy. Will put this on repeat.

I parboiled some chopped carrots and red potatoes. To the pan with the chicken I added these plus one roughly chopped onion, celery, red pepper. I put the seasonings on both sides of the chicken and it was absolutely delicious . Everyone raved!

I made it once already and am doing it again tonight.  It is so yummy.  I also added cubed sweet potatoes and they fit right in. I did cut back on the chili powder a little.  My husband doesn't care for hot.  I added a little bit more this time but still not the whole tsp.

My  husband raved about this dish. I used vegetables I had on hand and baked it at 365 degrees for an hour. (Something came up and we had to eat later hence the additional time.) I think I would also enjoy using cubed sweet potatoes. Any vegetable will do.
Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. We will definitely enjoy your recipe again.

I varied the recipe based on what I had in the kitchen at the time. The chicken was tender and the flavor the vegetables imparted was YUM!  The better-half walked in the door  picked up the smell in the kitchen and was ready to eat.
Yep, this is a keeper. I will likely vary the veggies and seasonings from time to time....just cuz. :-)
Thanks for posting this recipe!
