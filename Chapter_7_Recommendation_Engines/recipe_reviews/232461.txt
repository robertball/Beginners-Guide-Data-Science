The cake is absolutely delicious!! The frosting was really good too but made the overall recipe too sweet for my personal tastes. Very rich and decadent dessert.

Very nice cake.  I decided to make cupcakes, as I was taking this to work, and ended up with a lot of cupcakes, so bear that in mind if you want cupcakes as well!  I didn't make the frosting as I tend to believe most cake is sweet enough, and I felt this to be true with this cake.  I did top about half the cupcakes with marshmallows, which kind of ended up making for a melted, crusty, gooey type top.  Kind of interesting . . .I must say, though, that there was one cupcake left out of all the ones I took to work by the end of the day.  Not bad at all, especially considering I also had on the tray a coffee cake.  I count these as a success, and they were incredibly easy to make.  Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for Father's Day. It is delicious and deserves 5 stars. The cake itself is very moist and I baked it 40 minutes instead of the 25 minutes as stated in the recipe. Made the frosting as it was baking so had to keep frosting  warm until cake was ready for the marshmallows. Added marshmallows to the top as soon as it came out of the oven. Let it sit for a few minutes until marshmallow softened and then poured frosting on top.

Interesting and SOOOO good. Made as cupcakes, worked well. Made 1/2 recipe-9 cupcakes, next time would make 10 to make them a bit smaller. Next time, would cook about 12 min on 335 convection, then put marshmallows on and pop back in the oven for about 2 min. I used the flat marshmallows this time and were kind of cute. Then while warm, cover with icing . Set up nicely and looked great. Made for a work lunch, big hit.
I have made these now 4 times and they were amazing and a huge hit every time. I think ideal # is 18 per batch, but can make up to 24. Cook12-17 min depending on size. Put the mallows on and then put back in for a few min to brown. Have also made with 1/2 splenda and still taste great.
