I really didn't expect this sauce to taste as great as it did- I will never buy another jar of sauce. It cooked faster than the pasta and was a very sweet sauce! I did add some oregano and extra basil. The beauty of this is that you can add anything to it and it's great- I added green pepper, mushrooms (drained), and some italian sausage- perfect for the chunky sauce lover. It was awesome!! Thanks so much for this recipe!!

I used what I had on hand and it was fantastic. 1 can 14.5oz diced tomatoes(w/juice) instead of 28 oz of crushed  and 1/4 cup of oil was the only changes I made. I cooked the garlic in the oil and when I poured in the tomatoes I mashed them a little. This is really simple and fresh tasting. Might use fresh basil next time. Great in a pinch. My chicken parm came out fantastic!

As written, this is pretty bland and watery, imo. However, it is a nice basic recipe that can be improved upon and tweaked to personal preference. Personally, I sautee some chopped onion in olive oil, then add the herbs (regular Italian seasoning), garlic, pepper, a little chicken broth, and the tomatoes. Husband doesn't like chunks of tomato so I usually put the tom's in a bowl and whizz them up a bit with a hand-held blender. If I'm in the mood for a thicker, more robust sauce, I add some tomato paste and more chickie broth.

Quick and easy to make.  I had all the stuff and it didn't require a trip to the store, so it gets and extra star for just that reason.  I don't know that the taste is anything spectacular.  It was good though and my neice who was staying with me when I made it loved the fact that there was no meat in it.  I added a little sugar to sweeten it up.

This was very quick prep and tasty good!  I added an additional large can of concentrated crushed tomatoes and 2 teaspoons of ground italian seasonings.  Instead of cooking for 20 minutes I cooked for 3 hours on low with a large bay leaf.  Added into the sauce I used the Three Animal Meatball recipe from this site.

This is a very good pasta sauce that can be used during the busy weekdays when you get home from work and don't have alot of time.  We had it over shells and I added some red pepper flakes to give it some heat, I may add onion the next time also.  It's better than any bought sauce and you could add things like mushrooms if you wanted. This will be a keeper for us.

This is quick and easy, yet doesn't taste "store bought". You may consider adding some seasonings, such as basil or oregano or some vegetables to make it more hearty.

after finding this recipe last year, i don't buy sauce anymore.  i read all the reviews and added the most recommended modifications:  1 tsp sugar, a TB of tomato paste, another tsp or two of dried basil and a hefty pinch of crushed red pepper flakes.  wonderful!  so simple, yet so good.  oh, and they don't have crushed tomatoes on the island where i live, so i just squish canned whole, peeled tomatoes.  my three-year-old loves to assist with this part!

Great, easy recipe. I also added diced green pepper, onion and mushrooms, although I'm sure it tastes great w/o the veggies too. Served this over spaghetti with hot turkey italian sausage and garlic breadsticks on the side.... yummmm!

I used what I had on hand and WOW, so good. I used 1 can petite diced tomatoes (w/olive oil & garlic) and one can plain. Also used fresh basil from a tube that I keep in the freezer. We used this sauce over manicotti, with garlic bread, and a salad, a glass of Pinot Grigio...great dish...thanks!

Used a bit extra olive oil and six leaves of fresh basil instead of the dried--this is a gorgeously easy and delicious sauce. My go-to recipe!

It was a very good recipe... with onion! I added about 1/4 cup (maybe less it was leftovers from omlets!)and it tasted a ton better. Good starter recipe!

This is awesome. It is so easy. The key is use good canned tomatoes. I use the Cento brand in a yellow can. I add Italian seasoning along with the basil and a pinch of sugar for a little sweetness that we enjoy in our sauce. 
This is as close to a fresh made sauce as it gets when you don't have 4-8 hours of sauce cook time.
Way better than a jar IMHO. I will make it again when I need a dinner in a hurry.
Thanks for sharing.

Not wanting to use the ready made sauce that came with my pasta, I decided to try this one.  I only had stewed tomatoes but this came out very good!  My family really enjoyed this one so I'll be making it again!

This was awesome.  I love how simple it is especially after spending hours making other pasta sauces I've seen on this site. And you can really make it your own.  I like to add a little bit of diced bacon and some ground beef to give it a meaty taste for my meat-loving boyfriend and we roasted some of our home grown red peppers and threw them in too.  Fantastic and it takes no time to make!  Cheaper than bottled sauce and by far fresher!

This was a really good basic recipe. I added some meat for bolognese and i put in loads more basil than in the recipe and a touch of chilli.
Next time I will add onion, mushroom and cinnamon. Double garlic too probably. Very good though!

good when you don't have much ingredients and time 

I would say this is a very very basic sauce that you can build and tweak to your liking.  

I found it to be so so. I won't make it again. at least I can say I've made my own sauce

This was really quick and easy to make. I used diced tomatoes and added shallots and a bay leaf to the mix. I smashed the tomatoes with a potato smasher as it cooked to even out the consistency. So much better than store bought any day! And no worries about added sugar and other hidden additions!

Made this tonight because I ran out of Prego for my lasagna. The most sensitive child noticed a difference but she said it was a good one. I only modified it to make it smell like what I wanted to taste. I added 2tsp sugar and oregano based on what I wanted to taste. I only had powdered basil so I added 1/4tsp to 1/2tsp. Again, it was based on smell. In the end I added graded parm to the sauce after it mixed it in w/the meat. This was a very good quick sauce base.

What a great basic quick recipe. I was making eggplant parm at the last minute and needed some sauce.  I added about a Tbsp of sundried tomatoe paste with the garlic. Then some Muir Glen Organic Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes (14 oz can) along with some Italian dried seasoning.  Hey this was so good and quick why keep jar on hand.  I'm Italian and my Italian Grandpa had a bakery, then a dinner. This would be good to make ahead and freeze.  enjoy

This was quite good; not awesome, but since this is maybe the first time I've ever not used jarred or canned sauce, I may stick to homemade from now on. I made it almost exactly as written. I cooked the sauce for the full 20 minutes, but turned the heat down from medium because the sauce was bubbling a lot and spattering my cooktop. The spices here are simple, and doubtless can be improved upon, but for a quick-and-dirty homemade pasta sauce, this was quite a treat.

I used diced can tomatoes instead of crushed ones and it was still great! I actually did not think the sauce would be any good so I had some extra store bought sauce just in case but it was actually good. The trick is making sure you put just enough garlic to have flavor but not too much to over power the flavors of the basil and tomatoes.

So easy and so tasty! My husband liked this better than store bought sauce. This is a great base to make whatever kind of sauce you want by adding mushrooms, meat, or bell pepper. I will make this over and over again!

For the limited ingredients in this recipe, the sauce was delicious! I made it yesterday and loved how quick and easy it was to put together. It tasted fresh compared to the overly sweet bottled sauces. Thanks for a good recipe!

A fabulous start to a sauce of your own!
I used a can of diced tomatoes because that's all I had on hand.  I doubled the garlic, added 1 TSP oregano, 1 TBSP sugar, 2 TBSP ketchup, and 1/2 TSP crushed chillies.  It's a delicious and fresh tasting sauce.
Thanks!!  :-)

It was a good basic sauce. Family loved it. I did use chopped tomatoes (I didn't have crushed on hand) put through the blender a bit. I thought it needed a bit more, maybe paste would be good. I will use this recipe as the base for future sauces but will tweak it to our desired preference.

Definitely a good, basic recipe that you can put your own spin on.  I added chopped onions & mushrooms but still felt it needed something more.  I will play around with this as it is a great base, and so easy!

Often times I veer from the original recipe.  I had NO time and NO jar sauce on hand. So, I followed the recipe and found it to be simply perfect.  No more jar sauce, as this will be my last minute standby for a no fuss meal.    Thanks for sharing.

I added 1 T. sugar (just because!) and used my immersion blender to puree after simmering in the pot - LOVED IT!  We like sauce without tomato paste, and this had plenty of flavor and texture without it.

I really liked this recipe; I think it's a really good simple jumping point to making pasta sauce to your own taste :) I made this a few months ago, adding more garlic, basil, oregano, and lots of crushed red pepper flakes (I love my sauces spicy) and it was a really good sauce. I would recommend it to anyone who is just starting to make their own pasta sauces. Best part is I always have almost all of this on hand!

Absolutely the best pasta sauce recipe I have ever made and in my 63 years, I have tried a few!  I started with sauteing a chopped onion with the garlic (only 2 cloves ) and a little sugar to cut the acidity. Also used fresh basil instead. No salt was necessary either. Used on the Eggplant Parmaesan II recipe.  Fabulous!!!!!

I've made this a few times now and it's great!  I had never made pasta sauce before but hated the idea that I had no control over the ingredients.  This is perfect, can be changed to suit tastes and takes hardly no time at all.  I use a lot of garlic, a sprinkle of red pepper flakes, and sometimes add olives too.  I also add a can of diced tomatoes because I like a chunkier sauce.  Very easy and good.

I was skeptical because this recipe has such great reviews but the ingredients list was missing something to balance the tartness of the canned tomatoes. I made it anyway because of the glowing reviews and it was so sour! Most recipes using canned tomatoes use brown sugar or balsamic vinegar to cut the tartness, which is what I had to do to salvage it (along with adding tomato paste and more spices).

Delicious, simple and quick sauce to put together! I found that it needed sweetness, so I added a few tblsp of brown sugar.  That helped to improve the flavor and cut the acidity of the tomatoes, for my tastes anyway. Another time, this would be wonderful over pasta, but I'm using it in a vegetable lasagna. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

Fantastic recipe! My son asked for Spaghetti and  meat balls. I looked in my cupboard and realized I didn't have a jar of sauce.

But I had the ingredients for this recipe!

Very easy and delicous.  I used fresh chopped tomatoes because I didn't have any canned.  I simmered at medium heat for 25m.

I realized too late that I was out of jarred pasta sauce. I searched online for something quick and easy, and this recipe more than met that criteria! I didn't expect it to be as delicious as it is! I added fresh bell peppers & vine ripened tomatoes, then simmered it until the peppers were cooked cooked through. The  entire family, including a child who "despises" tomatoes & any type of peppers, adored it & all requested that I make it again soon! This will be my go-to recipe from now on! I will NEVER use jarred pasta sauce again!

I was skeptical but out of my regular sauce so I gave it a try. This was unexpectedly really tasty. I added a half of a chopped onion and sautéed with garlic before adding the tomatoes.  It's sweeter than long simmering sauce but still really very good.

Wow this is really good... Simple, clean, very tasty with depth. After tasting this, I don't feel the need to have to let sauce simmer forever for it to be awesome lol. Will definitely make again. I didn't change anything, which is unusual for me :-)

We didn't have any pasta sauce in the house so we whipped this up quickly. Tasted great and probably saved us $1.50!

I loved this.  My whole family did.  I was surprised by how good it turned out since it was so quick and easy and didn't have many ingredients.  I added onions to mine when I sauteed the garlic. Yum.

I have never made my own sauce before and looked for a basic one I could make in a pinch. This was soooo easy and tasted great and my favorite part is that it's so much cheaper than jarred sauce. My family loved the flavor of it. Now that I have this basic recipe I'm branching out with adding other herbs and veges. I can now enjoy pasta more than I ever did.

I used this to replace pasta sauce in another recipe.  If you love sauces with basic tomato flavor, this one is good.  I didn't really feel it was awesome on any level.  I wouldn't use it again, unless I ran out, like this time.  Its not the recipe's fault by any means, its just not dimensional enough for what I use pasta sauce for.

It's hot today and I didn't want to spend a lot of time cooking. So I thought spaghetti! Of course I had no pasta sauce. I found this recipe. Of course, I did not have a 28 oz can of crushed tomatoes. I did have a 14.5 oz can diced tomatoes pre-seasoned with basil and garlic. So I substituted that and used a few leaves fresh basil since I grow it. Tossed with the pasta and sprinkled with Parmesan. It was yummy and no one noticed it wasn't the typical sweeter taste of a store bought sauce. And it was ready in less than 15 minutes!

This was not too good. Seemed to simple to be good and sure it enough it was. Needs more of a taste to it.

You won't win best cook of the year with this sauce but it is more than worth it. You get a lot for a little in this case. This is exactly what the title says a quick pasta sauce.

I was quite impressed. I didn't have any of the store bought stuff yesterday, But I did have the ingredients for the recipe on-hand. It was simple straightforward and  a very flexible recipe. I used this recipe with some seasoned ground beef, and the end result was a sauce that fit the bill perfectly. Rague, Prego, and all the others as of this post are all officially FIRED! I'll be making my own from now on.   Peace.

If you want quick, this is your recipe.  It is better used as an ingredient, rather than the star on top of pasta by itself.  I used it with Italian sausages, onions, peppers and fennel--and it was great!  I couldn't help but add to it, though -- I used a T of fresh basil, dried oregano, crushed red pepper flakes and a touch of red wine.  A good, solid recipe for every cook!

I decided to try this when I found out I didn't have any jarred sauce handy. I am glad I did. It truly was "quick." I added some extra seasonings to taste and was quite pleased.

I loved this, it was quick and easy, just what I needed. The only change I made was that I used sliced tomatoes instead of crushed and increased the cooking time for a thicker, chunkier sauce.

Good base recipe. I added my own spices (more garlic, italian seasoning, onion flakes) and some grated cheddar cheese ( didn't have parmesan on hand) and it was excellent. I also added ground beef.

I don't think we would like this sauce with just pasta, but it was perfect with Stuffed Shells III, by Renee. If you like stuffed shells, this sauce with that recipe makes a wonderful combination.
