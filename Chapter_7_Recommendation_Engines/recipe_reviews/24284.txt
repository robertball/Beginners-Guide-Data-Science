This recipe is very close to one that my family has always enjoyed.It really is delicious.For those who find it difficult to use the suet,try substituting applesauce.It tastes the same,without the health hazards.

Very similar to a recipe that has been a holiday tradition for years. The applesauce is a great idea and delivered the same great taste. For a little different sauce, try creating a lemon butter sauce to pour over the top.

Our family has been making a similer recipe since the early 1900's based on an old Scottish traidition. For those who are unsure, Suet is a specific fat which is typically discarded at the butcher. If you request it, they will typically give it to you several pounds for under a dollar. 

Only major difference is after refridgerating the loaf, we slice it and fry it for breakfast with eggs. Overall it tastes a lot like Cinnamon Raisen bread... :-)

I love that this recipe calls for actual molasses. As for the suet, if the suet comes from grass-fed beef fed on pesticide-free grass, you're safe from the toxins that reside in the fats of animals. 
My grandmother used to make this for all our holiday meals. It was delicious!

I added citron peel, currants and candied cherries and substituted apple sauce for the suet.  YUM!  Very good with "Hardly Hard Sauce."

This is the recipe that was on our Christmas plates every year growing up. My sister always made it and we referred to it as "heart attack on a plate" but it was always served warm with the meat entree.The only difference was it had lots of cinnamon and clove in it and was steamed in a muslin cloth in a kettle. Our recipe called for one cup of fine ground suet, which the meatcutter can do for you. We did not make a sauce for this as it makes its own sauce. This is the first time I have ever seen this recipe in print anywhere.

This is Christmas! Every year my Mother use to bake this for my scotish father. I made this last night because I still have the cast iron mold pan my Mother used. It was fantastic !! The only thing differnt was my Mother added a brandy sauce that was lit at the table.

Great recipe  In Australia we can buy dessicated suet in packets from the supermarkets. Makes it easier.

This recipes brings back Christmas in England. My mother and grandmother always made this for Christmas dinner. After wonderful roast beef and Yorkshire pudding dinner there was still room for this old fashioned dessert. Oh my it!s good.

When buying suet at a butcher's shop, make sure you ask for "fresh suet to use in a recipe" so that the butcher won't mistakenly give you older suet. These days, most butchers probably sell more suet for people to put in their bird feeders than for use in recipes. So the suet saved for the birds may have been in the butcher shop for a while, as freshness isn't so critical for that use. But the butcher probably has fresh suet on hand, too, newly arrived with his fresh beef or lamb/mutton. By the way, regarding the sauce, even better than vanilla extract is an equivalent amount of the brand of liqueur called "B&B" (Benedictine & brandy). Wowza! Extraordinary!
