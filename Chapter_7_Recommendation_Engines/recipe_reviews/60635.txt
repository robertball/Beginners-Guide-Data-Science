Yummy salad!  I added 1/2 tsp dill weed and it added lovely flavor.  I only used 1/2 tsp of pepper and that was enough for my family.  I only used 2 tomatoes and thought that was enough too.

This was an excellent dressing.  I didn't think it would cover all those tomatoes, but it did.  I did add parmesan cheese to the dressing.  I put all the ingredients (except tomatoes, cukes and onion) in the food processor and it came out fantastic.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an okay recipe. It is missing something though - it needs more of a kick. However, it is still tasty enough as is, but you may want to try to add some more garlic, pepper, or some other ingredient. It was just missing a little something.

This recipe is a great way to incorporate your garden veggies into a side dish!  I used garlic pepper instead of regular pepper, and I added 2 tbsp. of dill weed, and used sliced cherry tomatoes (about 25).  Very tasty!

Pretty good for a cold summer salad.  Be sure to serve very, very well chilled.  I added parmesean cheese and added a little vinegar to the mix.  Next time I think a little feta cheese might do the trick.

This turned out really well. After mixing it up I thought it was good, but that it was missing something. I added dried dill (as suggested by others); that made it really tasty. It reminded me of a tomato/cucumber dish that my mom used to make. Thanks :)

Like others, I added dill and a splash of vinegar to the salad. Also sprinkled in feta cheese and topped with crumbled bacon. This was absolutely delicious and very refreshing. Thank you so much for sharing!!

I had a Garlic Dill seasoning from Pampered Chef that I used in the dressing.  This was an excellent salad to use fresh tomatoes and cucumbers out of my garden with.

This salad is perfect for those summer garden vegetables. I added some milk to the mayo and some dill weed. I'd make it again.

Just like many other people, I added dill and white wine vinegar to this recipe to make it good.  It is pretty hard to give the recipe as it is a good rating, because really it is very bland without these additions.  I used yellow pear tomatoes because that is what i had on hand, and not even a quarter of a red onion, because unless you serve it immediately and there are no leftovers, the onion permeates the whole dish, making it taste VERY strongly of onion.

Very fresh and light. I used light mayo for health reasons and omitted the garlic just so it wouldn't overpower the veggies. I  added 2 tbsp of dill and 2 tbsp of fresh chives. I also used 2 tbsp of white vinegar for some kick and a splash of lime juice for a fresh zing. It's definitely a go-to summer side dish!

My mom has made this recipe since I was a kid, only difference is no garlic, and adds fresh squeezed lemon juice. I will give the garlic a try! Also, I have always felt the longer the dressing has to marinate, the better the salad, sometimes we make this the night before for a better flavor.

It was good but like Lana said it needed of something. I added extra salt and pepper. Still it needed something to stand out. Next time, I make it, I think I will put sliced eggs and maybe a pinch of masala powder. I need to have some sort of spice in my food. Otherwise, plain blend food is quite boring.

What a delicious easy salad!  I did make a few changes, I omitted the garlic (I just don't like garlic), added a few tablespoons of tarragon vinegar, and a tablespoon of sugar.  I also added a few sprigs of chopped dill, it really complimented the flavors.  I'm sure I added more mayo than the recipe calls for, but honestly, you can't really have too much mayo :)  Great easy summer salad!

This is a nice variation of the typical tomato/cucumber salad in and oil/vinegar dressing.  It is easy and very tasty.  I added cilantro.

Definitely needs some additional flavor.  I added some basil and a splash of balsamic vinegar to give greater depth of flavor.

I love these kinds of salads!  I added a splash (more like 1 TBS) of basalmic vinegar, and 1 tsp basil, and omitted the onion...not crazy for that veggie :)

This is the salad that my grandmother started me on more than 50 years ago and I still love it. This recipe used garlic and that was something my grandmother(a real country girl) didn't know existed. But I love it. I also grated a carrott and added it alsong with a small diced onion and yellow squash. Great way to get kids to eat fresh veggies.

A great, simple recipe to cut through the waves of tomatoes and cucumbers the garden brings in late summer. Especially good with ripe tasty cherry tomatoes.

I made a single portion and finished it.  It was missing a little something, but I will make again when I need to use my cucumbers and tomatos.  Very easy to make too, thank you

Pretty good...I added dill as others suggested, but it was still missing "that something," so I added a little bit of yogurt for some tangy flavor.

This is a great recipe for when you have to much in the garden. A new fresh way to use it up. I would have given this 5 stars but it was very runny, due to the tomatoes. However the taste was great, kids loved it and I will make it again.

I thought this was good.  It was a nice change from salad.  I did add about 1/2 tsp dried dill to give a little extra flavor. Went great with the Oregon Salmon Patties from this website.

Very yummy! I added one serrano pepper to it and used ranch dressing instead of straight mayo. Also, I added garlic pepper to it like another reader suggested. I will make it again!

Tasted just like creamed cucumbers with added tomato.  I used English cucumbers,   mixed the mayo with a little milk to thin and added a lot of dill.  It was very refreshing,  I'll for sure make again.

excellent! quick, esy and delightfully cool for a hot summer meal. I did use salad dressing instead of mayo (didn'[t have mayo in the fridge) and it had a nice "zip" to it! made it's own creamy dressing if allowed to sit for a feww minutes before serving. Thanks for a great and easy recipe!

Inspired by the dozens of 'I ADDED DILL!' comments, I went completely off the map making this one. The base recipe was very bland, and needed the inclusion of more flavors. Inspired by my new favorite chicken topping, tzatziki, I subbed out the mayo for full fat Greek yogurt, and added the juice and zest of an unwaxed lemon and a little EVOO. Chives and fresh mint in place of the red onions, and a finally addition of sweet green peas (I ended up with far more dressing than I had cucumbers and tomatoes for) and it's perfection. I did not add salt, as I did not want the vegetables to give up too much liquid.

I've been making this type of summer salad for years. This one differs from mine mostly in that I dice all the veggies, instead of slicing then halving some. Still, you get the same delicious flavors from everything which adds up to a great taste! This is especially good in the months where you can harvest your own veggies and literally go from garden to table, or get them easily at a farmers market or grocery store. It's very simple, quick, easy to make, and on these hot days, it's a nice cool add on to a meal, or can be a stand alone meal. It's that good, and that good for you. Plus it's very open to adding more of your own favorite spices(I like mine with a bit of smoked Paprika, sometimes a bit of dill or parsley, and even some thin sliced baby portabellos on occasion)but it's great just with the few ingredients listed. For me, this is a "must have" in the summer, and an "I still want this" in the cooler months. My only advice is read the label on the mayo to avoid unneeded cholesterol, fat and added sugars, and TRY to get organic veggies if you can. You can  always grow your own with very little space or effort so you'll KNOW where your food came from. This simple but delicious recipe is 5 stars any day of the week for me!

I just finished mixing this up. The initial taste before putting it in the fridge has my tastebuds dancing. Added a splash of high quality balsamic vinegar to the mayo.  Can't wait to dig in tonight at dinner.

Easy Peasy- This is a summer star, especially if you garden. Best way to make this simple dish your own is to grow your own tomatoes and cukes. I hoping to try it again next year with my own homegrown produce.

I added a splash of Italian dressing.  This gave it a kick and was easy!

This was actually really good. The one ingredient I added that made a big difference in flavor was some lime juice. I didn't measure just add to taste....it gives it that kick it is missing. Very similar to a salad my aunt made in Costa Rica with lime juice!

Great Salad, I made it just as directed and it was good.  Lots of pepper, so may use less than that next time, but I liked it spicy -- the kids didn't.

This is really good. I also added dill weed as others did, and then threw in some poppy seeds. Went very well with the grilled pork steaks(fixed with a BBQ rub from this site). Will keep this as we are always overrun with tomatoes and cukes this time of year!!

I like this salad.  I added Miracle Whip and sour cream in equal amounts.  Left out the pepper though.  Not a pepper person.

My daughter didn't complain about it but she didn't love it and I thought it was okay, but I won't make it again.  Maybe it needed something on top like a little bit of baccos.

Made this for my hubby and he really didn't care for it. In fact the more of it he ate the less he liked it. Too much pepper (and I only used half of the recommended amount), not enough of something else that we really couldn't put a finger on, and the garlic didn't mix well with the other flavors. Was worth trying once I guess, but won't be making again.

This was a very refreshing salad to have in the frig to pick on when I got the munchies.  I thought it called for too much pepper.  I love garlic so I halfed the pepper and added garlic salt instead.

This was a great recipe.  I used red, yellow, and orange tomatoes for a brighter look.  I also added a bit more seasoning to the S&P and would seed the tomatoes next time but loved it as a whole- and everyone else did as well.

Made this tonight for a family dinner.  It went over well.  I will definitely make this again---it was so easy and very tasty.  Thanks for the recipe.
