I took some significant liberties with this recipe, and the result was AWESOME! I used Simply Potatoes brand refrigerated potatoes... needed more than one bag, so buy 2. I also used gruyere cheese, as I'm not a big cheddar fan. Added about 1/4 extra cup of pecorino/romano, a clove of pressed garlic, and salt and pepper and onion powder. Topped with canned fried onions and bacon bits. Cooked in a big 9 x 13 pan, because we like the well done parts best. RAVES ALL AROUND!!!

This is a wonderful recipe.  However, to save some time, use the frozen hash-brown potatoes instead (trust me, you won't be able to tell the difference). Also, for added flavor, use half can Cream of Celery and half cream of chicken. 
I have made it for several occasions and people have actually told me that they were craving them after they left.

I made this dish for my fiance and parents and they LOVED it, there were no leftovers! It's extremely easy to make, and tastes like you fussed. I used frozen, shredded hash brown potatoes instead of doing the shredding myself. I will be making this again soon. Just be sure you put it in a deep enough pan, so it doesn't bubble over. I learned that one the hard way!! :)

I used to make this recipe for years for hunter who came to our place and it was always a hit. Only difference to my recipe is that I use cream of chicken soup, an ordinary onion and add 1 1/2 cups of cheese to the mix. I spread the butter-cornflakes mix on top and bake it uncovered in a 9x13 inch dish at 350° for 60 min, though. Some reviewers said their gratin would not be done or too greasy - by distributing the potatoes in a bigger dish they will be done for sure. Crush the cornflakes in smaller pieces with your hands and use 1 ½ to 2 cups crushed cornflakes, this way the butter gets absorbed and it makes a nice crust. Mexican fans may use tortilla chips (reduce butter, though).
And, of course, hash brown potatoes from the freezing aisle will do too! ;-) Just prolong the cooking time by 10 minutes if you didn’t let them thaw before preparing.
However - I think this is a recipe you can not go wrong with.

This was tasty, but much too greasy.  I would reduce the amount of butter used on the top and change the corn flakes to bread crumbs.  Other than that it was yummy and reheated nicely for the next day.

This recipe is outstanding!  The only thing that I did differently was that I made it into scalloped potatoes!  I sliced the potatoes rather than shredding them!  My husband & I (and our puppies) loved them!

I've made it several times now and the family all love it -- it's so quick and easy!  I've used less butter, used different flavors with soup (cream of broccoli or cream of mushroom), used more onion, experimented with cheeses and cheated and used frozen hashbrowns (much easier for me!).  It's now permanently in the recipe box :)

This wasn't bad. I used cream of mushroom soup, added garlic. Also used fresh breadcrumbs and seasoned them instead of cornflakes. If using fresh potatoes need to increase cooking time to 1 1/2 hours. Good with beef or ham.

This was very delicious.  I took a suggestion posted here and used cream of chicken soup instead of the cream of celery and I added 2 pressed cloves of sautéed garlic.  The whole family loved this one.  I didn’t get a chance to make the cornflake topping, and it was very good without it.

This recipe was awesome. The only change I made was that I used sliced potatoes instead of shredding them. I did have to increase the cooking time, but it was worth it. A+ Keeper!!!

We tweaked this recipe a little.  I don't like cream of celery and all I had on hand was Cheddar Cheese Soup so that is what we used.  We substituted the green onions with dehydrated onions and the potatoes with frozen, thawed hash browns.  Also, we added about a Tbsp of Worchestershire and about 1/2 tsp each of salt and pepper.  Turned out delicious!  This is a keeper for any meal, any day of the week and I'm thinking great for potlucks at work!

For a Thanksgiving potluck, my boyfriend wanted to make a cheesy potato dish. I found this recipe for him and he cooked it all by himself. I didn't have a hand in it, but from observation if a man who usually makes Mac & Cheese or Ramen can make this, ANYONE can make this. It turned out sooo cheesy, delicious, and this is going to be one of those dishes that we will make again for a potluck style gathering, most likely! Thanks for a great recipe.

I was drawn to this recipe thanks to Emily's mouthwatering photo, and I was not disappointed. Hubby raved, and we both had 2 helpings! I followed Emily's suggestion of using white onion, and I added about 1 tsp minced fresh rosemary. I diced my potatoes instead of shredding, so I baked mine longer. I used sourdough bread crumbs on the top and only used 1/4 cup butter--it was plenty. Even though I love the Company Potatoes from this website, I like this recipe because it uses "real" potatoes, and that really enhances the flavor. This will be a repeater at our house!

I made this for a family get together and took home an empty bowl.  I lightened it by using fat free sour cream, fat free cream of celery soup, light cheese, and using half the butter and 1 cup of cornflake crumbs.  I did sprinkle it with some salt and pepper too, just personal preference.  I gave it extra time for baking, as others have indicated.  Yummy, this will be a keeper.

This was okay, it was a lot of work shredding the potatoes and it took a lot longer than the recipe said to bake.  I have another recipe that calls for frozen hashbrowns and Cream of Potato soup that we liked better, we will probably go back to that recipe.  I also didn't care for the topping.  Mine never really got crispy.  Maybe I didn't have enough crumbs.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe!  I was a little worried about the cornflakes, and was tempted to adjust the recipe a little, but my husband recommended I try it as listed first.  Well, I'm glad that I did because it turned out great!  I did use the already shredded potatoes, though, which made it a lot easier.  I also added a little garlic powder & seasoning salt, because I thought it may be bland, but I don't think it actually changed anything.  I told my husband that it was supposed to have green onions (which I don't really like), and he was dissapointed that I didn't add those.
I even brought leftovers to work the next day, and everyone at work just HAD to konw what that yummy side dish was that I was eating!  Thanks for sharing your wonderful recipe...it's now a favorite in our family, too!!!

Pretty darn good!  I used cream of mushroom (didn't have the celery) and added cooked bacon.  It tasted like a loaded baked potato.  A wonderful change from the normal potato side dish.  The texture was a little thick - so next time ill thin it out -  just a tad -  with some milk.  I also didn't use the corn flakes - i just didn't feel it needed them.

This is very good!  I have tried a lot of Augratin Potato recipes over the years and usually they are TOO rich, this isn't!  I had printed it off at Christmas time thinking that I might make it then and then decided to try something else - should have made this one!  I am a stickler for following a recipe to the letter, especially the first time around but I did put some chopped red pepper in this just because I like a little color and I happened to have some.

This dish is FANTASTIC!  I substituted cream of mushroom soup and used frozen hash browns.  I also used half sour cream and half mayo because I was short on sour cream.  I used a 9x13 dish and it was practically licked clean by my family!  This is a definite keeper and a new family favorite!

LOVE this dish!  I got rave reviews from the family.  I have been trying to get a hold of this recipe.  My hubby wasn't so keen on the cornflakes, so next time I think I will smash them up so he doesn't know its cereal!  Thank you!

I loved these--buying already shredded potatoes made them even easier.  They were also really good with french onions for a topping instead of the cereal.

I doubled this recipe. I used 5-6 average size white potatoes.  I peeled, then sliced and halved and quartered the slices so they were not large, I used 1 can cream of celery soup & one can cream of chicken soup. All other ingredients were doubled. For the topping I used a Ruffles potato chips. I crushed them up fine and mixed them with the butter. I then sprinkled them on top and put the potatoes back in the oven under the broiler long enough to make the topping crispy brown. Maybe a minute or so. These potatoes were excellent and I will definitely make them again. Also, because everyone said theynwould take longer to cook, I put them in the microwave for 15-20 min before I put them in the oven to take the edge off of how long they would need to cook. I then cooked them in the oven for 40 min, finishing with the broiler to make the topping crispy. This recipe is very kid, teenager, anybody friendly :-)

Great recipe, I do not know how anyone could of messed this up. I cut up the potatoes instead of shredding them and followed the recipe to a tee however I did leave them in longer to cook as some others had suggested. Instead of the corn flakes I used the dried onions and soaked them in butter with garlic, salt and pepper. Then after 20 minutes back in the oven I put on the parsley and did 4 minutes on broil just to crisp up the top and it was awesome!

My family refused to eat these.  The sour cream made this sour with little other flavor.  I son threw them out - probably to save me the heartbreak of the waste.

First off, it took 90 minutes for the potatoes to cook through.  But even then the taste was awful.  The cream of celery soup was not a good flavor for this dish.  I ended up throwing out almost all of it.  I will not be making this again.

This was a great recipe. I use half the butter and white onions because thats what I had. I also would crush or even omit the cornflakes next time...they were a little chewy.

It was very good, my husband thought I was crazy putting corn flakes on top.  I would add something to give it a little more zing, personal preference, but it was good just as is.  Very easy to make, I sliced my potatoes, thinly, and it took the exact same amount of time.  The cream of celery soup is needed, would be bland with cream of mushroom or similar.

Really excellent. I followed the advice of one of the raters and added a clove of pressed garlic.  I also added some celery salt to complement the cream of celery soup.  Also since I used the (pre-cooked) Simply Potatoes (1 bag + about 1/4 bag), I could taste it to see how much more salt & pepper it needed. Cooked longer per other raters. People had seconds and third and ate 'til we couldn't have any more.

I have made recipes from this site for years and always been happy. This recipe had no flavor, and  I was really surprised that it was rated at 4 1/2 stars.  I read all the reviews cooked it longer that the recipe called for and was glad I did because it was cooked. However, I will never make this recipe again.

I thought this was OK.  My husband loved it though.  I think it should have been a bit cheesier.  The only change that I made was using Ritz crackers instead of cornflakes and added salt and Italian seasoning

This was a big hit with my very picky 7 and 11 yr old children. There were fights for the left overs the next night.
Very tasty and easy to make. Its a nice alternative to all the hashbrown potato casseroles that are out there.

I made this as a side with a pork roast for a dinner presented to a bereaved family. It was a big hit.  I doubled the ingredients, and made one for the family, too.  Seemed generally well liked. Used frozen shredded potatoes, not too time consuming that way.

Lovely side dish that can easily be made with just a few things around the house. I did make a couple changes though to suit my needs, and it came out AMAZING!

1st- I scalloped the potatoes (russet) in my food processor. I prefer them this way.

2nd- I used 1 can cream of mushroom soup, as it's what I had on hand.

3rd- I added 1/4 c. of milk to moisten it up (it wasn't soupy at all in the end. I can't imagine if I hadn't added extra milk)

4th- I grated 1/4 white onion into the soup mix and only used 1 green onion

5th- I didn't have corn flakes, so I used potato chips in their place. I didn't add any butter because the chips were already greasy

6th- I added a little season salt to the mix before baking. Not sure this was necessary, and prob wouldn't do that again. We don't like a lot of salt.

7th- bake it in a 9x13 dish. It still wasn't super crispy or well done, but had nice golden bits around the sides.

I also used Fat free sour cream, and you would never know the difference! Delicious!

This is more of a hashbrown casserole vs. au gratin potatoes. I used frozen shredded potatoes, which I thawed before using. I also used cream of mushroom soup since that's all I had on hand and breadcrumbs instead of cornflakes (we don't ever eat cornflakes, and I didn't want to buy them just for the topping). These were pretty good, but tasted more like a casserole vs. potatoes.

Delicious! I doubled this recipe to feed 5 adults and 3 children at my Christmas dinner. It stole the show! Even the ham and turkey didn't get as many compliments. The only change I made was that I didn't add the onions because my brother does't like them. I only gave 4 stars because my only complaint was that the cornflake/butter ratio was a bit off for my taste. The top never got crunchy because there wasn't enough cornflakes to soak up that amount of butter. Next time I will just add another cup of cornflakes. Everyone should try this, though. It was fabulous.

This recipe was a huge hit with my family.  Impressive flavor for little effort!  I did make a few changes, using what I had on hand.  I used the frozen pre-shredded potatoes because it saves so much time.  I used 1/2 a chopped red onion instead of the 1/2 cup of green onion.  I didn't have sour cream, so I used a 5 oz can of evaporated milk instead.    I will definitely make this again and the only other change I will make is less butter in the topping.  1/2 a cup was way too much.

This recipe is Fantastic! I often substitute one cup of ham for one cup of potatoes. I have also doubled the "sauce" ingredients and added broccoli and cauliflower in place of the extra potatoes. Either way makes for a great dinner!

This recipe was so delicious and so creamy! Best potato casserole that we have ever made, hands down! We did use light cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of celery. Also cut the butter in half for on the cornflakes and would cut it down even more in the future. used frozen hashbrowns to make it easy. Yum yum!!! Leftovers were great too!

PERFECT!  I used frozen hash browns, cut down on the butter, cooked a bit longer and it was fantastic.  I made two one with onions and one w/o.  The one w.o onions needed onion powder for flavor. Had it for leftovers the next day and mixed some ham in it for great meal.  I can't wait to make this one again.

Wow! Talk about comfort food ;) I have made this many times now, and I can change the soup and completely change the flavor every time. I do use frozen hashbrowns- no need to thaw before you cook- and i add extra sour cream since I probably use more than required. I also add whatever cheese I have on hand, and it always is wonderful. Thanks!

wow! this was an amazing recipe! i love au gratin potatoes and the last time i had them this amazing was at my wedding in april 08 and i have been craving them every since. i rate this recipe a 4 because it calls for WAY too much butter on top with the corn flakes. next time i will only use half a stick rather than a whole one and maybe add some more corn flakes for an added crunch. my husband moaned with every bite. he loved em!!! *side note: they are not good heated up....way too greasy.*

I made this tonight as my first "Au Gratin" recipe and it turned out great! I used fat free soup, light sour cream, double the cheese, bread crumbs, and about 1/4 of the butter and it still had lots of flavor.  My husband is a cheese lover and wants even more cheese the next time!

This recipe was surely different than the Au Gratin Potatoes were used to but they were delicious. It was a hit on Christmas.

Wow this is so good. Great comfort food. I added ham to mine to make it a meal. I wasn't too sure about the cream of celery because I had never had it before...I grabbed it on accident at the grocery store. But this was the perfect recipe to try it with. Now I won't be afraid to use it again. This recipe is a definate keeper. Thanks so much!

Awesome!  This is my favorite potato dish.  I used white onions instead of the green onions.  The cornflake topping is really good, too, although I've used crushed up potato chips in the past.  Will definitely make again.

Tasty recipe, husband loved it. 1/2 cup butter is WAY too much for my taste; next time I'll use a few tablespoons with bread crumbs instead.  We sliced the potatoes instead of shredding them and used sliced Vidalia onions instead of green.  Nice variation, but takes much longer to cook.

Very good! Although, the bottom layer was stuck to the pan, which was a bit of a pain. Tasty though. Next time I will try with cream of chicken soup instead of celery just to try a different flavor.

This was my first time making au gratin potatoes.  After cooking the dish for an extra 25 minutes, it turned out great.  I think the next time i cook this dish i will use a larger baking pan and decrease the butter amount.

While I think this recipe sounded like a good idea, not only did it take a long time to prepare, but even with over an hour of cooking time, it still wasn't completely cooked.  Some of the potatoes were still raw.  Also, between the celery soup and the green onions... the flavor wasn't that great.  I like celery and green onions, just not as the main flavor.  My kids hated it but, had it been cooked completely through.. adults probably would have found it tolerable.  So, there ya go!

Made this for husband who wanted au gratin potatoes so badly and I had no idea how to make them.  I used hash brown potatoes that I bought in the store, which only had 3 1/2 cups but they were yummy!  Served them for company and they were a huge hit!  Thanks for making me look like I can cook!!

I can't believe how easy this is! I used frozen hash browns and put it together in no time. My husband thinks it beats any other potato casserole type deal I have ever mae. In fact, this dish is in my oven right now! Thanks!

Very quick and delicious.  I made 1 substitution--frozen shredded potatoes instead of fresh, and left out the green onions.  Even the leftovers were good when reheated.

This casserole was OK but I prefer the potato casserole made with the frozen hashbrowns instead.  They provide more flavour.

I used my heavy steel casserole dish so instead of following quantities I layered the pot with potatoes, salt pepper and spanish onions (4 little ones slices thinly and broken apart into rings) until it was full.  I then made the sauce, using not cheddar but strong hard cheese. The quantity didn't look enough so I melted 1/3 tub Philly cream cheese in the mixture and made a smooth paste of 1 tablespoon cornflower and milk, then added another cup of milk to the cornflower and added it to the pan. I poured it over the potatoes and added parmesan cheese on top.
Delicious, great for a large crowd

We loved this dish.  I made a few changes.  I used cream of chicken instead of cream of celery, I could not find any at the store.  I used frozen shredded hash browns potatoes. For the topping I used Panko Bread crumbs and shredded cheese instead of the corn flakes.

I am making it right now. It's in the oven. I am using half cream of celery and half chicken as i saw someone suggest. I didn't add any onions though. Did make sure to add pepper and a little salt. I even grated my own potatos. Planning on putting panko on top. Will update with edit to let you know how it turns out :) Fingers crossed that it will be yummy.  EDIT....Just finished eating. It was yummy but it was not 'wow' like i was hoping. My 4 yr old liked it which is good :)I feel something is missing. I'm thinking it would be great with bacon. So next time i'll try that.

I doubled the recipe and cooked in a huge pan so it wasn't too deep (didn't want it to take longer to cook).  Served it at easter and came home with only a small serving.  It took about 10 minutes longer to cook than the recipe stated.  I thawed my frozen hash browns in the fridge, used cream of potato instead of cream of celery, no onions, used bread crumbs instead of corn flakes, and no butter.  No one was raving about it, but everyone ate it.  Could probably tinker a bit with what I did but don't have to.

I made this last night for a get-together.  I used Cream of Chicken soup and a little more sour cream.  I was a little disappointed that the potatoes were not cooked through enough.  I used a round and deep casserole dish so that could be the problem.  Next time I will bake longer.  I also added salt and pepper as it was too bland without it.  And I crushed the corn flakes.  I will keep this recipe and next time change it up using the different comments.

Mmmm!  In a 9X13 pan, Used a full bag of Oreida's Potatoes O'Brien (have added onions and peppers) to save time, added in garlic powder and some basil.  Used a four cheese blend (2 cup bag), and some additional Parmesan cheese (didn't measure, just tossed on).  Per suggestions, used about 1/3 cup melted butter and about 2 cups of crushed cornflakes. Cook time was a bit longer, as other reviewers stated.   I LOVED this, but the kids didn't - hence the four stars.

This took ALOT longer to cook than the recipe said.  Maybe the temp is off.  But when it was done cooking, it was wonderful.  I used cream of mushroom soup and a small regular onion and it was great.  Wonder what it would taste like with French fried onions?

This was a good recipe, I made it for Easter dinner w/ leg of lamb. It made much more that 4 servings,though. I would say more like 6-8 as an accompaniment. But I'm not complaining. We stuffed leftovers into corn tortillas, deep fried them, topped w/shredded lettuce, hot sauce etc. (no need for cheese or sour cream, obviously) for some awesome (and naughty) potato tacos!

These potatoes were great and were devoured fast at a recent pot luck!  I shredded the potatoes myself, so it was a bit more time consuming (although  well worth it).  The kids ate them up too.

Won't make this again. Took 1.5 hours longer than the recipe states. Kind of bummed cause it looked so good, and didn't have a side with dinner.

Even after cooking an extra 30 minutes, the potatoes were not done!  The flavor wasn't even very good, either. Maybe the potatoes need to be pre-cooked.

Prepared this for Easter dinner. Followed recipe but doubled it so the entire family would have plenty. It was tasty and the family enjoyed it. Next time I'll use potato chip crumbs from the bottom of the bag so I won't need melted butter. Cornflakes are not a "staple" in my house but potato chips usually are. If you double recipe and use a 9x13 pan, increase your baking time by about 15 minute since  there is more mass in the middle"
