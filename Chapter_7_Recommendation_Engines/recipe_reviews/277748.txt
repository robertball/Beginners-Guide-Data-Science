Very yummy and enjoyed by the family. My daughter said she didn’t like the mustard taste and preferred my regular slider recipe to these, but still ate them. Easy and quick.

Delicious!  Definitely a keeper, everyone loved them.  The only change I made was only using half of the called-for amount of butter topping.  I'm sure the fall amount would have been good too, but it seemed like overkill.

I thought the flavor was delicious and worked great with the sweet Hawaiian rolls.  Next time I would leave the brown sugar out of the butter.  It made it a little too sweet for me
