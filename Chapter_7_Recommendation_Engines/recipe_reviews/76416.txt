I used veggie broth instead of chicken (2 cans and skipped the water), doubled the mushrooms and sauteed them with the leeks, and added defrosted broccoli after the soup had been simmering about 45 min.  I pureed about 1/3 of the soup instead of lightly mashing it and it gave it a nice thick texture.  Will definitely make again.

This soup is awesome!  I like how this recipe includes ingredients that I already have in my fridge.  I made a few changes too - I left out the butter and substituted proscuitto for the mushrooms.  Yum!

Yum! My changes: veggie broth instead of chicken; 2 stalks of green garlic instead a clove; substituted a cup of steamed pureed broccoli for the mushrooms (but I can't wait to try it with mushrooms later!); no celery salt; extra liquids to make up for my extra veggies. I used extra sharp cheddar.

We didn't have mushrooms on hand but had lots of potatoes and leeks. We chose this recipe because it had "cheddar" in the title. Yum. Other than not having mushrooms, we followed the recipe exactly except to add some red bell pepper. It was very good, especially with crutons.

The only thing I did differently was to omit the celery salt, and I used more cheese. Oh, and I sauteed the mushrooms along with the leeks and potatoes. Next time I'll add a little onion. Good stuff. Thanks!

This was a great recipe, I usually make major changes, but left this one virtually as is.  I did add a stalk of celery (no celery salt) and used twice as much mushroom, but other then that GREAT!

Best soup ever.  I have passed this on to my family and they love it.  Every spring we pick wild leeks and store for the winter use, just to have this soup.

I did make a few minor changes that I don't believe altered the taste of the soup itself. One large leek instead of two, a teaspoon of minced garlic (about 2-3 cloves), powdered chicken soup base for the chicken broth, ground celery seed instead of the salt variety, cremini mushrooms instead of portobello mushrooms and left out the croutons. This soup has too much going on, and wasn't very flavourful besides the saltiness and cheese.

Great soup for my first time using leeks. Took the advice and cooked  baby bella mushrooms with the potatoes. Added cooked chopped bacon while simmering, very good. Going to add more leeks and celery next time.

Loved this recipe!  I used Porcini Mushrooms (dried). I soaked them in hot water for about 10-15min while preparing rest of the soup.  I saved the water(about 1 cup) from the mushrooms and added it to the chichen broth for more flavor. I only added the mushrooms after mashing the potatoes.  I served this as a main course for dinner so was not 6 servings.  Turned out to be 3 large bowls and 2 kid size bowls.  Everyone loved it!

This was VERY good! I made only a few small changes. I used celery seed instead of celery salt...just added salt to taste, white pepper instead of regular and a half cup of cream, half cup of 1% milk.  Let everyone put their own cheese on at the table. Oh and made homemade garlic croutons to pile on top! Yummy!

I liked this a lot -- and I've made it a few times as written. But now I've started to play a bit. This time, no leeks, butter instead of olive oil for more flavour, no milk, and added a bottle of Old Milwaukee beer at the same time as the broth. Served with homemade bacon bits and a sprinkle of cheese. Delish!

Awesome recipe! I judge all non meat based recipes on my husbands reaction, being a stolid carnivore. He LOVED it! An easy recipe to play with, adding this that or the other. Makes a great starting point for a basic soup that'll use up your leftovers. I added leftover lentils, and veggie broth that needed used and it turned out delish!

LOVE it!  Of course I always use vegetable broth rather than chicken as I'm a vegetarian.  This was very tasty and I will make it often.

So I made this soup for my Mother who is really picky and she said 'it is FABULOUS!' I used 1/2 bag of mini potatoes instead of regular sized ones, and didnt puree just mashed by hand. Topped with bacon crumbles and a bit more shredded cheese. Mom even asked for a second bowl!!

My new favorite soup recipe!  I did end up adding salt after serving so I made a note to add some while cooking.  Also, there's no way this is 6 servings!  Not if it's the main dish anyway...  I doubled the recipe and it served 4 (although we all went back for seconds) with not much leftover.

After trying several leek and potato soup recipes, this one is my favorite! I use nonfat milk, and it still tastes great!  The only change I sometimes make is to roast an entire head of garlic and puree that into the soup - it's a subtle flavor that really adds to the soup.

I had very high hopes for this soup, but we really didn't enjoy it.  The mustard flavor just didn't seem right.

This soup was delicious!  Had to sub jack and mozzerella cheeses for cheddar because it turned out my cheddar had gone bad, but it was still good.  I think it would be even better with the cheddar though!  Other than that I mostly followed the recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

Absolutely wonderful! This is now going to be a favourite in our house :) I didn't have celery salt or parmesan cheese, but this turned out beautifully.

I hate to be a naysayer, especially on a popular recipe, but despite adding celery, onion, basil and parsley, we still found this soup to be pretty bland and lifeless, and the majority of it ended up in the trash (a first for me). Sorry.

Absolutely delicious. I had an extra celery stalk so I added that aswell. This recipe will definitely become a regular however I will cut down on the amt. of added flour.

Got some leeks at the farmer's market and went searching for a recipe.  Didn't make any changes except for some extra cheddar and it turned out great.

My daughter gave it a 3 but I gave a 4 since I think it was my fault that it didn't do as well as others rated.  I had 4 potatoes but they were on the larger size causing the potato flavor to come out just to much and not enough of the other flavors to come out.  More like a potato soup.  Even though I used 2 large leeks, you really couldn't taste them and I think I would have liked more mushrooms. I may try again with some adjustments.

My husband and I made this last night and really enjoyed it - after we used some much needed tabasco to pump up the flavor...

I did make a few minor changes to the recipe.  I started by cooking about 4 strips of chopped bacon.  Once the bacon was crispy, I removed the cooked bacon (reserved for garnish) and cooked the mushrooms in the bacon grease.  I removed the mushrooms, set them aside and then cooked the leeks and potatoes, adding chicken broth and seasoning. I simmered the potatoes for about 25 minutes, until they were done.  I think an hour is a bit long and may yield mushy over cooked potatoes.   The next time I will add some cayenne (see note above) and likely sub thyme for the celery seed (I didn't have celery salt) since my husband isn't a huge fan of celery.  

Overall good, quick, hearty soup recipe.  I will definitely make it again.

Wonderful!
A lot of black pepper really complements this soup. I did use veggie broth and about double the cheese (promised myself that I wouldn't but I LOVE cheese) and I only simmered for 30 minutes. Followed everything else as written. Will definitely make again.

I made this almost exactly as written and it was awesome. I used red potatoes, colby jack instead of cheddar, and a little extra garlic, but otherwise stayed true to the recipe.  Fried up a little sausage on the side for my husband and he said it really added to the flavor.  Thanks for sharing this wonderful recipe.

This is our favorite potato soup now. We slow cook it and use lots and lots of cheddar cheese along with a cup or so of heavy cream substituted for some of the broth. Remember to add the dairy for the last hour or so only, or you may get undesired results. We also added some dill to top the spices off!

This is a very good potato leek soup recipe.  We used dehydrated mushrooms of mixed types, added to simmer for the last 10-15 minute of cooking, and it came out delicious.  I am not going to give this five stars because the effort doesn't totally justify the reward.  You can make a very good potato leek soup with just a few minutes invested and this takes substantially more work.

This recipe has too much going on. When I ate it, I felt like it was a combination of cream of mushroom and potato leek soup...with some random cheese thrown in. the flavors didn't complement each other well at all. I will definitely stick to the ham and potato soup recipe from this site. It is easier to prepare and so much tastier!

When I first made this soup I didn't fall in love with it - but for leftovers the next day it was very good. So I recommend letting this one sit for a little while to meld the flavors.

Yum! Yum! Yum!  I added all of my veggies on the first step, including some chopped up brocolli and an onion.  I also used a submersion blender at the very end to puree the soup slightly, which gave it a thicker texture.  I cut back on the cheese, and still, this was a winner!!

A delicious blend of flavors.  I had no Cheddar but substitued Swiss with an excellent end result. Make sure to leave the potatoes somewhat chunky for a mix of textures.

This soup was DELICIOUS! I don't care for mushrooms, so I substituted broccoli. I pureed the potatoes, leeks, and broccoli after cooking for an hour. (I steamed the broccoli and added it to the potato/leek mixture when I pureed it.) It was really creamy and tasty! Serve with biscuits!

loved this! i made a few changes based on what i had - baked two potatoes and mashed them with garlic and herb boursin cheese. sauteed leeks and mushrooms together, added broth and seasonings, then added the mashed potato-cheese mixture and milk. yummy! will try this with cheddar, too, sometime...

This soup was very good.  I can never find leeks in my local grocery store, so substituted 3 green onions (white part only).  The soup had a wonderful flavor.  Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious, hearty and very filling! This is a meal in itself.  

I did not add the cheese to the soup, but rather sprinkled it on top at the time of serving. The melted cheese topping added interest and a whole sensorial experience!

I am on a low sodium diet so had to tweek a few things but overall loved its' flavor and creamyness without the cream. I was able to add some flaked red pepper and used a homemade chicken broth. All in all it is a delicious meal that was great for using up extra veggies I had around the house.

Nice subtle flavor of the cheese! Was looking for something to use the leeks and mushrooms left in my fridge and happened to have all the rest too. Also added some roasted red peppers for color and leftover turkey for extra protein. Don't forget to halve, thinly slice,  soak and drain the leeks to get all the grit out!

Excellent.  Used cornstarch for GF.  Sautéed mushrooms and saved for topping.  Next time use more leeks and more mushrooms .  8/2016

This turned out very well...delicious.  The only changes I made was to use a gluten free flour mix, and I added 5 slices of cooked bacon chopped.  I also added another 1/2 cup of cheese.

Loved this soup and used some leftovers. I added a chopped shallot instead of garlic to leeks and red potatoes. All out of chicken broth, I used vegetable broth, was fine; did not have celery salt, used 1/2 tsp. season salt instead. As the vegetables and seasoned broth were simmering 4 stems of fresh thyme were added as well as 2 chunks of baked ham.  This simmered for 20 minutes, the potatoes were gently mashed, and 1/2 C milk was added along with the mushrooms and chopped pieces of the ham. The soup had a medium thickness, just right for us. It made 4 hearty servings, I look forward to the leftover soup tomorrow.

Made this last night and it was great! Used crimini mushrooms instead of portobello. Also decided to top with bacon bits, so I cooked the leak and potato mixture in a little bit of bacon grease instead of olive oil. The croutons definitely added a nice texture. I will make again! Great on it's own but also a great base soup. Next time I will try and dress it up as a corn chowder. I would say this is much closer to 4 servings than 6 though.

Fabulous! Thick, warm comfort food, served  with a buttered slab of my Stilton and Parmesan Cheese bread. I used both white and green parts of leeks, didn't mash the potatoes, just diced them, added a bit of broccoli, only had white mushrooms, and only had 2 cups of chicken broth on hand, so used 1 cup of beef broth as well. Cabot Seriously Sharp Cheddar works well, but be sure to get high-quality Parmesan to hand grate freshly. The cost is higher, but the flavor is so much better, it's worth the extra money - and you can use less. I haven't tried it, but I'll bet a bit of crumbled sausage would be really good in here as well. You're right; I have everything on hand, even the leeks, 'cause they substitute well for onions, and there are 2 different flavors in the white and green parts. This recipe is a definite keeper!     
Also, after dental surgery, I needed "mushier" food for a bit. I used an immersion blender after cooking everything, but before adding the sauteed mushrooms, which were diced rather small. Very creamy! Also, I have added cauliflower, broccoli, carrots or edamame to the blended mix, sometimes frozen white corn just before serving. If you blend it in, you can add almost any vegetable to the mix - adds delicious flavor and added nutrition.

I made this this morning and it is keeping warm in a crockpot while I go out. It is delicious. Just the right amount of everything. I happened to have a cooked chicken breast on hand so I shredded it and added it to the soup. This has all my favorite, potatoes, cheese, mushrooms. Thanks, Shirley.

Absolutely delicious, but I did change it up a bit by substituting 1/2 sweet Vidalia onion, 3/4 cup Half & Half, 1/4 cup water and 2 small stalks diced celery, omitting the celery salt.

This is the third soup recipe I've tried and I have to say it was the most successful.  I had to make a few changes through lack of ingredients....  Didn't have celery salt so I put some celery in with the leeks and potatoes as well as a few slices of red peppers to give it a bit of colour - and because I had it and needed to use it up.  Didn't have mustard powder so I used a squirt of Heinz mustard instead.  Threw in a handful of frozen peas towards the end, again for colour.  It was superb!  I admit I was a bit worried about the garlic because the other two recipes I tried stated garlic as well and I found it totally overrode the taste of the main ingredient (1 was beet root soup and the other fresh pea soup) but I decided to try it with and again without if it did the same.  It didn't.  One of the tastiest soups I've had and will definitely be making it again.

I seem to be constantly trying out soup recipes and this one was a favorite. Pretty easy and so tasty. I served it to my parents and grandparents and they both wanted the recipe. I followed it exactly for my first time. Next time I will add either bacon or ham.

I thought that this recipe was very hearty, and it had an excellent combination of flavors. Something was missing, though... maybe more salt would have helped, but I think it was something else!

Really great solid recipe to either follow exactly or improvise upon. I used shredded mozzarella instead of cheddar and let the soup cook the mushroom instead of pre-sauteing. Also used white mushrooms instead of portobello. Very tasty and even the kids liked it!

We enjoyed this soup, the only change was I didn't have portobellos so used creminis, and added a couple shakes of Dizzy Pig Dizzy Dust (my favourite BBQ seasoning) for a little added flavour, and it was great.

I replaced the potato with cauliflower and it was still delicious and it took less time to cook too.  I added less water and I blended mine into a puree.  I doubled the mushrooms and added them just before serving.  Wow!  I think this was the best soup I've ever made.  My husband devoured it!

Using this and a recipe I had in a book from Culinary school, I didn't use any of the fat, sliced the leeks thinly, diced the potatoes and didn't mash them, didn't use mustard, and added shrimp at the end.  We make it all the time.

Very good soup.  Great flavour, nice and thick.  I didn't mash the potatoes because I didn't think it would need it.  Because of that, I cooked the soup a lot less than it called for, and it was really nice.

i asked my boyfriend what rating to give this one and he said 5 without hesitation!

i added a little bit of onion with the potatos and leeks as i was short on leeks. i also used white pepper instead of black. while cooking the mushrooms, i threw in a little basil and thyme to make sure the soup had some good flavor. all in all, i barely changed the recipe and it was delicious! great consistency. im sure the leftovers in the fridge wont last long.

I made this with items found at our local farmers market (leek, golden potato, and huge portabella mushroom cap). I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth to make it vegetarian. Also, I used a tablespoon of curry powder instead of celery salt, because there's never too much curry, you know?

Would also be great with carrots, parsnips, turnips, or others. But be sure to include the mushrooms. Wow.

Excellent soup! My only complaint is that it was so good I ate too much too fast and got a tummy ache. Ha.

Good recipe! I sauteed leek, mushrooms, and onion & celery (I added these) all together, and then added to the soup. Added extra milk and flour. I made the mistake of not mashing the potatoes enough. It was ok, but it would've been a lot better if they were mashed more.

Very tasty. I skipped the whole flour and liquids in a seperate bowl business, and just added everything to the pot (minus the flour, the potatoes eventually thickened the soup up nicely enough). The mushrooms and the cheeses make this a 5 star soup, a lovely addition to my favoutite leek&potato. The only thing I missed a little is maybe some herbs for extra flavour. I toasted some sunflower seed bread slices, cut them into cubes and threw them on top of the soup with some extra grated cheese. Very satisfying.

I've never been a fan of potato soup, but this recipe came out really well.  I made some minor changes.  

I used half and half instead of milk and dijon mustard instead of ground.  Also, I always use asiago instead of parm. And I left out the mushrooms, just because I didn't have any on hand.

The soup comes out pretty salty with the broth and the cheese and celery salt, so next time I think I will use low salt broth.  Additional salt is not necessary at all, and I like salt. ;)

**I made this again, this time with the mushrooms.  They really add a nice touch.  Also, I chopped up some turkey bacon and sauteed with the leeks and potatoes.**

I loved it (a five for me) and my husband liked it.  My 2 & 1 year olds ate it up and asked for more.  I didn't change anything but might add some chicken next time.

delicious. I added extra leeks which was a good thing I think, you could hardly taste them, and extra potatoes as we like our soups pretty thick. will make again.

Wow! Although I "tweaked" it a bit this was delicious! My family doesn't really like mushrooms so we omitted those & substituted a cup of   chunked bacon instead. I also increased the cheddar cheese to 1 full cup. We like some chunkiness to our soup, I didn't really mash the potatoes much either. Even so... this was amazing & my hubby & kids gobbled up every bite!

I was disappointed in the recipe. The soup turned out too thick, very bland and really without any taste. It ended up being a large amount when I added water to dilute it out and now I don't know what to do with it.

For a lighter twist on this recipe:  I omitted the cheese and added 1/2 a pound of steamed broccoli, run through the food processor.  You could do the same with frozen broccoli thawed and chooped that way.  Also, try sauteeing the potato and leeks in sherry, add the sherry about halfway through.
