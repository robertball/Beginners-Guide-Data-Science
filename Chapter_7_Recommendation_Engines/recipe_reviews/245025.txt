Delicious! Used almond milk and no problem with the outcome. This will definitely be made again.

I intended to make exactly as written; however, at the last minute I discovered I was out of sage, so I used sage flavored sausage instead of using another meat.  I may put a touch less salt next time, though it was fine as is, just personal preference.  I used only 1 cup chicken broth, as I preferred a thicker sauce.  We put it on whole grain pasta with lentils.  Excellent for pre-Circleville Pumpkin Show fare.

I used coconut milk instead of cream. I used vegetable broth instead of chicken broth.  That’s what I had. I added white pepper. I served it over ravioli. It was very good.

I read all the reviews and thought I would give it a try as I love pumpkin.  I used almond milk but other wise followed the recipe.  I too thought it was lacking something.  Was not sure what.... This may sound crazy but I added sugar in the raw and it was divine.

I didn’t care for this recipe as is. I thought it was too pumpkiny tasting and lacked flavor.  Ultimately I found a pumpkin sauce recipe in budget bytes and I added the spices listed in that recipe to this recipe to add flavor.  I ended up adding garlic powder, nutmeg, more salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. chilli powder was suggested but I didn’t have any on hand. The final dish was very liked by most but this recipe as is is lacking flavor in my opinion.

This was a creamy delicious sauce. Served over both cheese ravioli and pasta noodles. Very rich.

Great starting point! As written, however, i felt the flavor was lacking, so I started tinkering until it was where I wanted it. A journey followed of adding and tasting. I added a couple of pinches of freshly grated nutmeg, a dash of herbes de Provence, some minced, fresh rosemary, a spritz of lemon juice, about 1 tsp Dijon mustard, and a generous grating of fresh Parmigiano Reggiano. The next time, the flavor will intensify even more by using reduced chicken stock by half before adding. I'm thinking a splash of Marsala would bring out the best in all the other ingredients. Don't get me wrong. This recipe has good, strong bones, but needs a little "fleshing out" to coax out its maximum flavor Impact. The texture is lovely and velvety. It's rich without being too much so. The pumpkin flavor is subtle, but is the perfect vehicle to underscore and complement the herbs.

this was outstanding! I did have to use coconut milk instead of cream to keep it lactose free but the seasonings were great! I will definitely make this again!

Pretty good. Had to add more salt for flavoring, but very good.

So delicious!
Made mine vegan with coconut creamer and earth balance butter! I also added a pinch of brown sugar to sweeten the sauce.

Tasty and very easy to make. We like a thicker sauce, so I only used 1/2 cup of broth. I didn't have fresh sage or thyme, so I put in a tsp. of dried sage and a bit of dried thyme when I added the rest of the ingredients. The family loved it over gnocchi.

This is a good way to use up some of your pumpkin. I made my own pumpkin purée and upped the cinnamon to 1 tsp. I also sautéed some small pieces of chicken with a  hint of garlic. My husband was skeptical but the first bite changed his mind !!!

This turned out marvelous! I saved it over spinach and cheese ravioli - it was heaven! I substituted the fresh sage and thyme for a teaspoon of poultry seasoning as a shortcut. I added a little too much chicken stock in an attempt to finish off the container which made the sauce a bit thin. I did thicken it a bit but I discovered that the sauce also makes a great creamy soup. This is getting pinned to my favorite recipes board.

Amazing sauce! Crowd favorite! Not too pumpkiny, but has a definite fall feel to it, which is very much welcome during the fall and winter seasons.

I used homemade pumpkin puree, which was more liquid than canned. I only needed about 1/2 cup of broth. This is nice with egg noddles. Thank you for the recipe.

This is fantastic sauce that is simple, yet with a depth of flavor. I had it with pumpkin ravioli. Great way to ring in the Fall!
