Thank You..Thank You...Thank You.  I have found so many "Jambalaya" recipes that add really strange and non traditional ingredients and then forget what makes Jambalaya what it is...the spices.  This is the first recipe in a long time that I have seen that remembers to put Thyme in the list of ingredients.  It turned out wonderful!  Hats off to you Suzanne!

Yummy. The first time I made this recipe I followed it exactly and it was good. I made it again tonight and instead of using white rice I used the small 5 oz. package of Vigo yellow rice and the whole 14 ounces of chicken broth. Very moist and much tastier.

First time making Jambalaya...Ive never even tried it because I dont like seafood.  I made this last night for some friends and everyone scraped their bowls clean.  My boyfriend doesnt care for pork so I just made this with the chicken, cooked the rice before which worked well, also added some cayenne and garlic.  Not too hot but hot enough...I had to ask my friend whom is Creole if it looked/tasted right...he gave me the thumbs up!!  Will definitely make this again, everyone was upset there werent any leftovers even though I doubled the recipe.  So quick and easy to make!!  Love it!

I invited a guest to my home for dinner who was from Alabama.  This was the request for dinner and I had never made it before.  Allrecipes to the rescue.  My guest had 2 servings and said it tasted like Mom's!  I did add about a pound of raw shrimp just before serving as well as a broiled, hot sausage.  It was great!  Thanks.  CS, Kaysville, Utah

This recipe was okay, not a big fan of spicy food so I ommitted the hot sauce, used red pepper flakes instead.  I would recommend more thyme and basil to the recipe.

This is a quick, easy meal to make. I used shrimp & smoked sausage instead of the chicken.  Since I used instant rice, I did reduce the broth (could use just water) to 2/3c also. Next time I'll try bacon grease instead of the butter.  Served with cornbread, this meal was very filling.

Delicious!  For those of us who like a little more kick to food, I recommend using diced tomatoes with jalapeño peppers!

Very good and easy to prepare. I only made one substitution, I used a poblano pepper instead of the green bell (I don't like green bell peppers). The poblano gave it more of a kick too.

I added some grilled smoked sausage at the end; and had to add extra stock (probably due to high altitude; 6400 ft).

So great and super easy. I was cooking for a lot of people and wanted to use a limited amount of meat to cut costs. I used one chicken breast cubed and one link of smoked turkey sausage. I also used canned tomatoes with bell peppers and onions (but I still added the fresh veggies too) I threw the meat in with the veggies to brown and used olive oil instead of butter and fresh garlic instead of garlic salt. I couldnt add the hot sauce because thier were children eating but put some Franks on top in my bowl and it was AMAZING. Everyone had seconds. Even my friends two year old.

Pretty good! I cooked the rice then added it. All cooking/simmering was as the recipe listed. [I've been burnt countless times where you add uncooked rice that is supposed to cook in the casserole and never does.] I did not add hot sauce as I don't like it. Even with it cooking, I was afraid it would take bad/strong and ruin the dish for me. After eating, I felt it did need a 'kick' of flavor though. My spouse said it was excellent when 'raw' hot sauce was added.

this was very good.  I've made it twice, once just as it is written, and another time, I used dried basil instead of thyme.  I liked it with the basil (more of an italian flavor), but my husband preferred it with the thyme ( more cajun style). Either way, it's a great recipe that can be tweeked for something different depending what you are in the mood for.

This was good - but it wasn't jambalaya according to my husband.  I usually make the slow cooker version on this site and I guess I will go back to making that for next year's Fat Tuesday.  I did add shrimp - and I thought it was good.  But it wasn't jambalaya.

This is a great recipe! I doubled the batch for 8 people, and did not have enough for everyone. It was sooo good. This will be the second time I'm making this, as the same dinner guests requested it again! I'm going to have to quadruple the batch this time.

Great recipe for fast jambalaya! I did pump up some of the ingredients to match my taste, omitted the garlic salt in favor of real minced garlic and added in shrimp and chicken.

Made this many times now.  It's easy and tasty, and a regular in our house.  I mostly follow the recipe as stated, more or less.  But I use a hot Chorizo sausage instead of chicken, and put the sausage in at the start of the simmering, to extract lots of flavour.

AWESOME AWESOME.  Try adding some kalbasi, extra hot sauce and cajun seasoning.  What an explosion of flavor......

This is FANTASTIC! I followed the recipe just about exactly... didn't have any "file powder" so I omitted it, used "fire-roasted diced Italian tomatoes" because that's all I had in the right size, and 2 cups brown rice with 1 can of chicken broth... but as far as I can tell, I didn't substitute anything that would dramatically change the flavor so I consider it true taste to the recipe... it's DEFINITELY being made again! Thanks Suzanne!

Fabulous!!! Used a Cajun seasoning blend I had instead (good sized teaspoon) of the pepper sauce. Doubled it thankfully, I am thrilled to have leftovers!

Awesome, and pretty easy!  I changed it a little, but this is good!  I use more veggies than called for, and in place of the salt and pepper I use almost 1 tsp Cajun seasoning, and omit the hot sauce ( though my dh adds ssome to his).  I also use 2 chicken andouille sausage cut up and a pack of TJ's frozen seafood blend in place of the chicken.  I guess that's a lot of changes, but the recipe is good!   Thanks!

I made this tonight and absolutely LOVED it.  I followed the advice from another reviewer who used yellow rice.  I didn't have cayenne on hand I used garlic powder, bay leaves and cajun spice.  I left out the hot sauce so my grandbaby could eat it, but put it on the table incase anyone wanted to add it to their plate.  I doubled the batch for 4 + little one and have just enough for one bowl for lunch tomorrow.  Excellent recipe!  Thanks very much for sharing!

We really liked this a LOT!  I cooked it in the pressure cooker for 5 minutes rocking slowly, and let it drop pressure on it's own.  I used 1 cup rice and just filled the diced tomato can with broth.  It seemed perfect.  I cooked my bone in chicken breasts in some water, celery and onion while I started making this, and it was perfect the way it worked out.

All the ingredients are there to make this a really great dish, but this did not turn out well at all. I had to add sugar to it to bring down the acidity. The seasonings were off as well. My bf and I always like what we have cooked from this site, but this time, we both agreed--this was not good. My suggestion to the person who wants to make this still is cut back on the thyme maybe and use real garlic instead of garlic salt.

This is the first time I've ever made Jambalaya and it turned out pretty good!  For the chicken I diced 3 chicken breasts and seasoned them with "Creole Seasoning Blend" from this site.  I then sauteed them in olive oil and then set them aside to add later.  I like to use brown rice, so I baked it in the oven with chicken broth and added the finished rice to the tomato mixture along with the chicken and let it all simmer together for about 10 minutes.  Easy, healthy and spicy!

Great!  I made this last night and followed the directions almost exactly- except that I used canned tomatoes that come with onions, celery, and green pepper... I used the whole can of chicken broth [which is only slightly more than the 1 1/2 cups the recipe calls for]... I used red pepper flakes instead of hot sauce like another reviewer suggested... and to save time, I used Tyson's premium canned chicken and used 2 cans of that- which I think is slightly more than the 2 cups of chicken the recipe calls for.  When I turned the heat down after I brought it to a boil, I brought it down to medium.  At first, I stirred it fairly frequently, but in the last 10 minutes, I didn't stir it much at all.  A little of it stuck to the bottom, so next time I'll either make sure to stir it more often or possibly turn the heat down more.

Loved how easy this was to make!  I changed only a couple of things.  I made a roux (equal parts butter and flour) to start and I wisked it until brown.  Then I followed the directions with the excption of I added fresh garlic and onion flakes (my husband dose not eat fresh onion)!  I'll make this again!

Very good!

If you do not have hot pepper sauce on hand, here's what to try.  Add 3 tbsp of vinegar, 1-2 tbsp of soy sauce, garlic, and ground cayenne pepper.  If you're brave add some actual hot peppers.  I had a wee Thai chili on hand and threw that in there, which was overkill. My Jambalaya is really good, but pretty much ridiculously spicy.

I too doubted this recipe based on the ingredients but it's excellent and surprisingly easy and fast.  I used fresh garlic and fresh grape tomatoes (they explode as the heat - yummy). I also left out the celery since I didn't have any.  I had some frozen chicken tenders so I just threw them in with the rice (still frozen) and they all finished cooking together.  I didn't add the hot sauce because of the kids.  I served theirs with ketchup and ours with hot sauce.  Everyone loved it - even the two year old.  Thank you!

Oh my, I've just made this and it turned out amazing! I left out the celery and used 1 1/2 tbls of jalapeno pepper relish instead of the hot pepper sauce but otherwise stuck to the recipe and it was so good. Just the right amount of liquid for the rice (had my doubts in the beginning) and just the right mix and amounts of spices. Will definitely be making this again, and again.

Yummy!  Also easy.  You can tell that this isn't the all-stops-out traditional jambalaya, but it doesn't matter because this is GOOD!  And easy enough for regular dinners.  Thanks!

This is a great recipe! I did cheat a little and used a tablespoon of my creole seasonings (http://maindish.allrecipes.com/az/CrlSsningBlnd.asp) instead of the spices listed. My silly husband liked this jambalaya even better then my other recipe that takes 4 hours to prepare. YAY!!

The liquid to rice ratio was just right. I wouldn't change a thing!

Developed a craving for Jambalaya and allrecipes to the rescue!  This dish was incredible ... and the little leftover we had was just as good the next day.  The only changes I made to the recipe was to add some keilbasa chopped in small pieces, small salad shrimp and extra hot sauce.  I also cooked the rice separate and added at the end just because I was afraid if it getting "mushy".  This is a better jambalya than we can get at our local cajun restaurant!  I served with warm cornbread muffins and it was a huge hit.  Great Recipe Suzanne!!

I loved this dish.  Get home from work and you still have time to make this. One thing I added was a tinsy little bit of cajun pepper.  Nice and spicy - just make sure if you do that, you have a glass of water handy when you eat it.  I've made this dish a couple of times now and you can add or delete ingredients as you like.

This recipe was very good and fairly easy to make.  I do not think I can say it is a true jambalaya . . . being that it has tomatoes it is more like a gumbo, but it is very good nonetheless.  I didn't have any diced tomatoes so I substituted stewed tomatoes.  Also didn't have hot sauce so instead I used cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes.  I also found that i needed just a bit more liquid than was specified for the recipe, so I added a bit of white wine to the chicken broth. I also use geen onions or leeks when I have them on hand.  Delicious.

Easy to make, especially good if you like spicy food.  A bit on the hot side if you don't.

We'd recommend adding a few more spices to kick up the flavor of this recipe.  It's kind of bland the way its written out.

This was good! I liked finding a jambalaya recipe without andouille sausage, ham and shrimp. I used stewed tomatoes and added a few drops of liquid smoke. I also cut back a little on the thyme. Tasty and easy.

This is always a hit whenever I make it! I do use a 2:1 ratio of brown and wild rice instead of white rice. The recipe is pretty customizable too if you like more or less spice, and I even made a vegetarian version once that turned out just as great!

This recipe is amazing. It is easy to make, tasty and doesn't take much time at all. I might try change things a little bit the next time I make this though. First, I think I can add some more pepper sauce or pepper flakes. I like spicy food and I think adding some heat to this recipe would be perfect. (I actually add some sriracha sauce when I ate leftover and it was just what I needed) Second, I am going to cube chicken breast and sautee it in the pan instead of using stewed and shredded meat like the first time. I didn't think it would matter but I think cubed and sauteed chicken will add more flavor to the recipe.

Great recipe! I omitted the garlic salt and used real minced garlic and I added in shrimp and chicken.   I also doubled the veggies and used red bell pepper rather than green.  I also added about a tsp of cajun seasoning.  Very good!

YUM YUM YUM!  This is a staple at our house!  We skip the celery, because we never have it on hand, and also the thyme for the same reason.  Although this last time I actually DID have thyme, and we decided we like it better without.  I sometimes add extra veggies (peas or cauliflower) to replace the celery.  It is good with or without!  Otherwise, I follow the recipe exactly and this is one yummy dinner!

If you've got lots of stuff and little time, this recipe is for you! I didn't have bell peppers, so I used baby carrots. I didn't have a 14.5 oz. can of tomatoes, but I did have two gargantuan tomatoes from the garden.  Threw it all together. Cooked one cubed chicken breast in Chef Prudhomme's cajun spices (just a pinch) and, I kid you not, this was ready in under 30 minutes!  Do yourself a favor! Double the servings and enjoy!

I've never had jambalaya before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I read the other reviews and this looked like the one to try.  I loved it!  I always put my own personal touches on recipes and this was no exception.  I used a whole chopped onion and the entire can (14.5 ounces) of chicken broth.  I also added chopped smoked beef sausage and cooked with the tomatoes, rice and other ingredients.  After the rice was tender, I added the chicken which I had boiled and shredded.  It was great.  Even my brother, who is a picky eater, ate two bowls.  Thank you, Suzanne, for a great recipe.  It's going in my collection.

I made a vegetarian version of this with seitan, and it turned out delicious.  I will certainly be using this recipe again.  I was out of celery, so I substituted mixed vegetables and a liberal sprinkling of celery seed, which turned out very well, too.

Only changes I made were to add some sausage and Herbes de Provence, and use fresh tomatoes instead of canned. Very easy and tasty dish. I wish I could have made it spicier, but my son wouldn't have liked it. I stirred some hot sauce into my portion and it tasted great!

This was really good!  It was fast and easy to prepare and it tasted delicious!  I'm not sure about its "authenticity," but I will definitely make it again; I even emailed the recipe to all my friends.  I especially like it because it didn't make a HUGE quantity- which is great for single folks like me.  I like spice, so I doubled the amount of hot sauce - next time I would probably even use more!

I didn't expect much from reading the ingredients, but it turned out really yummy.  I cooked bacon first, removed the bacon and cooked the veggies in the bacon grease. I added the bacon back in at the end. I also used fresh tomatoes rather than canned tomatoes.

Good recipe! My husband REALLY liked it... I on the other hand didn't care too much about the canned tomatoes, but that's just personal preference. Next time i'll try fresh tomatoes... thanks for a good & easy recipe!

Fantastic! And easy! My husband has been asking me to make jambalaya since having it at a restaurant a few weeks ago. I was excited to find this version that did not include andouille.I sauteed the chicken in the skillet and then removed it and sauteed the veggies. I also added the seasoning with the veggies as they softened.It had a kick but was exactly as I would have expected of jambalaya. I will definately make this again!

Delicious ... I added a small can of tomato paste, about 1/4 cup white vinegar, 4 small chopped green chilies and some sliced baby zuchini. One piece of advice: parboil the rice while you chop the veggies, otherwise it can take a REALLY long time to cook, especially at high altitudes.

Super yummy! I was just searching for something with ingredients I had, and I stumbled across this. It was very good. The only things I did differently were substituting red and yellow peppers for green (not a green pepper fan), and I used Trader Joe's frozen Jasmine Rice. I cooked it first and cut the broth by half. I'm glad a had a non-stick pan, otherwise the rice would've stuck, but that's my fault. The kids and husband loved it! I will definitely make this again. Thanks.

I converted the recipe to make 6 servings, so I'd be sure to have leftovers, and I am very glad I did.  Followed the recipe with the exception of omitting the green peppers.  I also added some minced garlic (about a tsp), a couple of dashes of liquid smoke, and some cajun seasoning mix.  It had *just* enough kick to it!  Thanks for the recipe!

Very good recipe. I added Cajun seasoning and red pepper flakes which made it very spicey....but that's what we like. Only ingredient I didn't have was the celery but that didn't take anything away from a good recipe. All in all, this was a keeper!!

This recipe was great as-is!  It was extremely easy and fast to make which is wonderful... not to mention the taste was delicious! I was able to pull all of it right from my fridge & pantry without going to the store which made it even better.

I've made it three different times. I use it to get rid of the small pieces of chicken that seem to accumulate in the freezer. The kids eat it right up - and it's mostly healthy stuff. I even snuck a little bit of sausage TVP in the mix the last time, and they liked it. (my mom tried TVP on us when we were kids, and it didn't work.)

This recipe is PERFECT! I never have time to cook--nor do I ever feel like cooking, however, this evening I felt up to the challange. My best friend introduced me to AllRecipes.com and this is the first recipe I've tried. It is SO good and SO fast!!!

This is also the first time I wished that there were leftovers. 

The only thing that I changed was adding a little extra hotsauce. Other than that, this recipe was an A+.

We made this to celebrate Fat Tuesday.  It was delicious.  I followed the advice of others who previosly rated this recipe and cut the rice to 1 cup.  I also added a small can of tomato sauce.  Make it the day before you use it.  It's even better!

I have to give this a 3. My family ate it but it was a bit bland to us. I doubt I make it again. Not that there is anything wrong with this recipe. Obviously quite a few people like it. We did not though. To me it was just missing something. Can't quite put my finger on it but.....thank you for the recipe though.

I'm an awful cook and my family loved this meal. My 16 year old even took it to school to eat during football practice and shared some with his friends.

I completely recommend this easy meal for anyone.

Very good and so easy to make!  I had leftover brown rice so I omitted the broth and threw the cooked rice in with the tomatoes.  I added kidney beans and kielbasa for fun.

Me and my husband enjoyed this meal.  He doesn't normally like Jambalaya, but he liked this.  I substituted red pepper for green pepper, and added a lot more of the vegetables.  A 1/3 and 1/4 a cup didn't seem like enough.  I also cooked my rice seperatly instead of cooking it in the skillet.  Decreased the amount of chicken broth accordingly.  Overall a good meal, and will probably make again.

I found this recipe very easy to make and to substitute some of the ingredients with others.  It immediately became a family favorite that no one in my family can get over, especially when  Iadded some Hot Cajun Seasoning to the mix.

Simple to prepare but it is lacking some flavor compared to the other jambalayas I make. Instead of garlic salt, I used seasoning salt and fresh minced garlic. Also, I cooked the rice separately and added in the end. I also added additional creole seasoning and may go ahead and put andouille sausage in as well. I think this would be good for kids because it isn't that spicy.

The rice took forever to cook. I may go against all that is in me and use minute rice next time. I used sausage instead of chicken. My husband loves it.
