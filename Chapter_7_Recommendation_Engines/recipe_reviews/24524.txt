This was delicious!! I made this for my family and everybody came back for seconds. I made a couple slight variations. Instead of making a slit in one slice, I just put some cream cheese between two slices of french bread. I figured that, that would be easier and it turned out great. Instead of using orange marmalade, I used frozen strawberries in sugar and a bit of powdered sugar. I have already been asked to make this again!! Definitely a crowd pleaser!

This was delicious.  I recommend spreading the cream cheese out, just for uniformity, and adding a spoonful of strawberry jam (microwaved, to make spreading easier).  Also, the recipe called for vanilla, but I did not see it in the steps?  I added it to the egg mixture, and that worked great.  Thanks!

Absolutely wonderful! Be careful not to stuff too much cream cheese in there, but, this was absolutely excellent. And the marmalade was a nice touch, do try it even if you're skeptical. You'll need a bit more butter to cook them in....this one goes straight into the recipe box permanently!

I adapted this to a moderately low-carb recipe with good results.  I used Nature's Own wheat and fiber bread and just spread the cream cheese on one slice, sandwiching it between another.  It held together just fine.  When it was done, I served it with tons of butter and a little sugar-free syrup.  Probably sounds gross to those of you not doing low-carb, but I really found it delicious!  The french toast tasted like regular french toast, and the warm, melted cream cheese made it wonderful!  Also very easy to make.

I made this Easter Morning, and my family couldn't get enough!  I used Coffee Mate Irish Cream non-diary creamer, and thought it had a wonderful taste.  I would definately recommend this receipe.

This was edible but very disappointing.  I could barely taste the Irish Cream (I used Bailey's) and even after adding more cinnamon and nutmeg it just tasted very bland.  I cut way back on the cream cheese and it still seemed like too much.  My boyfriend tried one bite and refused to eat anymore.  Maybe a more experienced cook can figure out how to salvage this recipe, but I will keep looking for a better one.

I'm giving this only three stars because it wasn't as good as it sounded, and considering how fattening it is it should have been better! First of all, prep was a pain. I had a hard time slicing the bread just right, and an even harder time fitting the cream cheese in the pockets. Second of all, I just wasn't impressed with the flavor. It was kind of bland. Now, I will admit that I didn't use liqueur because the thought of it at 8:00 in the morning made me sick so I used french vanilla creamer instead (like the submitter suggests). I have used creamer when making french toast before and it always makes it excellent. Not this time. I also ran out of egg mixture before coating all of the slices but had extra cream cheese. Also, needed twice as much butter. But, I will say that the orange marmalade was great, it was the only part of this dish I really liked. Also, here's a tip I learned: Use clarified butter to cook the french toast in, that way it won't burn. Melt your butter beforehand and as it cools, skim off the white cloudy part with a spoon and use only the clear yellow butter remaining. Thanks for sharing but I really doubt I will bother to make it again.

I like the idea of using french bread for french toast instead of just the regular square bread.  I used strawberry "simply fruit" along with the cream cheese and it was great.  The next time I make this I will use a little more cream cheese.

I made this for Easter Brunch and was sooo disappointed.  I followed the recipe and substituted non dairy creamer as suggested infact I used Cinnamon Vanilla Creme creamer and the recipe was soooooo bland.  I was so disappointed.

The stuffing (just plain cream cheese) does not do justice to the flavorful egg mixture.  As DH suggested, we mixed maple syrup with the cream cheese for our second batch.  This gave the stuffing a better consistency, and it complemented the Irish Cream eggs much better.  Good idea love!  I need to listen to you more often!

Well I thought it was good but I just spread the cream cheese in between 2 pieces of french bread and I tweeked the cream cheese and made a sweet cream cheese filling with powdered sugar and a little vanilla extract. I used the liqueur and it was awesome! I loved the smell of it especially how it goes well with the nutmeg and cinnamon mmm! and I just cut up some strawberry and mixed a couple blueberries on top. My husband loved it. I'll be making this again. Thanks!

This is the best french toast ever! I did make a few minor changes but it was to die for. I chose to use just regular sandwhich bread, I omited the irish cream liqueur since I was making them for my kids as well and opted for plain half and half and I used a blackberry preserves instead of the orange marmalade since I don't like orange marmalade. Oh, and I also opted to put the preserves on the inside of the french toast as well. I covered one piece of bread with cream cheese and the other piece of bread with preserves, put them together and went on from there. So the french toast was stuffed with the cream cheese and preserves instead of just cream cheese. It was delicious!

My husband and I love this recipe! I made it exactly as stated in the recipe and it was perfect. All of the flavors compliment each other and it is really a joy to eat. The marmalade on top is essential. I don't recommend changing or substituting anything in this recipe. It is perfect as is.

I loved it.  I used Coffee Mate Caramel Apple creamer and the kicker was the cinnamon raisin bagels instead of the french toast.  Made for a family sunday brunch the best thing on the table

We really enjoyed these and my husband is very particular about his breakfast.  I didn't have any cream cheese at the time, but I did have this fabulous goat cheese infused with figs so I substituted for the cream cheese.  We also never eat any white flour breads instead I used a multi-grain French loaf.  It was a real weekend treat.  The flavors melded together for an enlivened change from the typical French Toast breakfast.  To top it all off it is easy to make and quick.

Turned out yummy.  I actually used  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/French-Bread-2/Detail.aspx for my french bread.  I ommitted the marmalade and used carmel liqueur.  I used maple syrup, I will probably add some sweetner to the cream cheese next time.

Really nice twist on a classic. Made this for a family breakfast and everyone loved the Irish cream flavor and the the texture of the cream cheese. Only thing I left out was the orange marmalade. Great, easy recipe! Thanks!

I was looking for something yummy to make for supper and came across this recipe. My absolute favorite is the stuffed french toast you get at IHOP. When I seen this I just had to make a snack. It is delish!! Almost just like IHOP! Enstead of the orange marmalade I used homemade strawberry freezer jam and it was wonderful. I'm so full I don't even want to think about supper now... LOL Thank you.

I made this with challah bread and it was absolutely wonderful!!! Even my husband who doesn't like cream cheese loved it.  I added raspberry preserves in the center with the cream cheese.  Could also use other jams or preserves.

I do the easy way and just spread cream cheese between two slices of Texas Toast. I didn't have orange marmalade jelly, so I put strawberry jam between the bread also. I also didn't have Irish cream liqueur, so I used hazelnut creamer.

This has become a favorite!  We have found we like it best with cinnamon swirl bread.  I don't bother with the "stuffed" idea and just to with cream cheese and/or marmalade. We've made this on the grill outside using a cast iron griddle for larger crowds too.

this recipe was fantastic.  I used to slices of bread and put them together with the cream cheese in the middle.  I also added raisins to the cream cheese.  I omitted the orange marmalade and topped the french toast with backed cubed apples with a little cinnamon and sugar on them.  Then I topped it with a little maple syrup.  They were a huge hit.

Great recipe!  I combined the orange marmalade with the cream cheese before stuffing the french toast.  The Irish Cream did not make the french toast taste like alcohol, rather it added a nice flavor dimension to the dish.

This french toast recipe was delicious!  The cream cheese and marmalade were an interesting twist.  I still prefer a traditional french toast recipe with maple syrup, but it is nice to changes things up a bit.

I made this recipe twice: once with "regular" bread and the second with pepperridge farms cinnamon bread. Both great. I love French toast and this is a wonderful sweet twist! I had the cream cheese at room temp and then spread evenly on the bread slices.  I do agree: I used baileys Irish cream and could not detect that particular flavor addition BUT to the untrained eye (e.g. my husband) it doesn't detract from the overall taste of this dish!  Still delish.  Also, I served with good ol' maple syrup. Would make again this again as is and may try another recipe that includes a jam or jelly addition. Thank you!

Excellent. I've made it twice now, and it is just great. I stuck straight to the recipe and it comes out perfectly. Make sure that you cut the bread this enough - its very easy to cut it too thin which makes fitting the cream cheese inside difficult.

Recipe was easy to follow and tasted good.  However, we will enjoy it more if we can find a recipe to make the cream cheese more blended and sweeter.

I used whipped cream cheese spread between two pieces of cooked French toast; heated a little longer with warm peach compote. It was sooo yummy!

My family loved this. Instead of using the liqueur I used the Irish cream non dairy creamer. I also added a little strawberry jam in with the cream cheese because I didn't have orange marmalade. It was delicious.

Amazing. The Irish cream liqueur was a great addition. I sliced my cream cheese pretty thin, but will try a thicker slice next time.

I would love to try it with orange marmalade. We just topped with real maple syrup and strawberries, since we didn't have any. 

I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing!
