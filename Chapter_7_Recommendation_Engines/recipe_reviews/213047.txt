Delicious ! Very rich though. We used 'herbs de provence' blend instead of what was mentioned in the recipe. Would definitely make again.

This was devoured at our house not even a crumb left, everyone loved it! Recipe does not specify what type of pan to use so I used a pizza stone and it worked perfectly. I used spices in quantities listed butiIf you do not like spices listed I think you could substitute just about anything into this recipe and it would still be delicious. I will absolutely make this again.

Really delicious. I don't care for rosemary but it really went well in this. I had to use prosciutto crudo (didn't have salame). Cooking time was right on, 30 minutes on the dot. Thank you Tiffany for the recipe.

Turned out very well for a Christmas party.  The ladies raved about it and it was gone within minutes.  Success.
