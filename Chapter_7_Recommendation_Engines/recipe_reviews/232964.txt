Easy to make, chewy and good. I didn't have enough cranberries, so I added a cup of raisins. In all I put 2 cups...I think 2 1/2 cups might be a bit much...with the nuts in there too I could see them being a bit crumbly with too much of the dried fruit. So it works well with 2 cups :)

This was a wonderful recipe especially for celebration of Thanksgiving and Christmas. Made these also for gifts. I made a somewhat healthier version by substituting whole wheat flour and organic cane sugar. I made Tablespoon and teaspoon size cookies. The smaller cookie was the best and baked in exactly 10 minutes.

Made the recipe "as is" using dried cranberries. Lots of compliments at the Christmas cookie exchange. Definitely a keeper!

These came out pretty good! Downed the amount of cranberries by a half of cup and it was plenty. Did not have milk so used equal parts condensed milk/water. Definitely an easy cookie to make!

Way to dry.  I made these with cranraisins and that may be why. But everyone was recommending them.  We ended up tossing most of them.

Very good, almost like shortbread. Used freshly frozen cranberries roughly chopped, which brought some tart juiciness. Didn't have OJ, so I used Amaretto, which gave a subtle almond flavor to the cookies. For the next batch, I'll add white chocolate chips for more depth.

I also cut down the cranberries. They were great! And after we had baked up about half the dough we added some swiss chocolate chips that were left from another recipe and baked the rest...yum!
