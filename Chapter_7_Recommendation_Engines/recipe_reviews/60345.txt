It was okay. The recipe needs some tweaking. I always make a recipe following the cooks directions first, so I get a feel for the recipe. Just a few small changes will make this recipe a winner in my book!

I love cannoli, so this was a must try for me. After reading the reviews I decided that I wanted to make it work and not be so runny, so I added 4 egg whites to the mix. I also eliminated the almonds (didn't have any) and topped the pie w/ pine nuts. Placed the mixture in a pie crust and baked it @ 350 degrees for about 40-45 mins. until it tested done. I allowed it to cool to room temp. and cut a slice. It held together perfectly and was very good, very rich, but very good. I would make this again. Thanks for posting :)

My son had a project due in school and needed something from his heritage. We decided on the cannoli pie. IT WAS AWESOME!!! I did use the recommendation of other people and i beat the sugar and the ricotta cheese together with a mixer. It did take the lumps out and made for a creamier filling. I did add a bit more sugar though. Not much. I also loaded it with choc chips. We loved it and my son said all his classmates loved it as.  Now i'm going to make it for us at home.

Absolutely delicious!  A few modifications - used whole milk ricotta; used hand mixer to make it smoother; no maraschino cherries or almonds; added extra choc chips; used a choc graham cracker crust & drizzled melted chips over top with fresh whipped cream as garnish.  Unbelievable!!  Absolutely making this again!!

Traditional cannolis are filled with a pastry cream and this is the wrong texture and flavor.  The addition a high volume of chips and cherries and almonds created a pie with a lot of "stuff" in it and the filling tasted even more bland because of it.  Freezing it made it hard as a rock but mere refrigeration made it runny.  All in all, not something I will make again.

As is this recipe needs some improvement. The taste was good, it didn't really taste like a cannoli but I still really liked the taste. The ricotta needs to be whipped to give the filling a smooth texture, otherwise it tastes grainy. Also the amount of filling this recipe makes doesn't fill a pie crust very well. I would suggest either doubling the filling or piping whipped cream on top. Otherwise you have a pie that looks half filled. I also found that thawing it for 15 minutes was not enough. I had to let it thaw for at least 30.

I absolutely love canolis.  I'm not sure why the recipe calls for freezing.  I preferred it cold but not frozen.  I'm going to stick with canolis.

This is very nice for Easter.  I simplified the recipe by cutting out all the extras and sticking to the semi-sweet chocolate chips.  The most important thing is to DRAIN THE RICOTTA by placing it in a strainer lined with cheesecloth or some kind of filter, for at least one hour. The less moisture, the better.  I would not recommend freezing this at all. It was a very sweet after dinner treat on Easter and the kids loved it.  Next time, I would replace the chocolate chips with a block of semi-sweet chocolate and use a grater.  I'm giving it five stars-- will make this next year at Easter again.

This was so-so.  Like one other reviewer, I didn't care for it frozen at all.  I think it might be better to use cream cheese and condensed milk.  Maybe use the cherries as a topping.

Traditional Sicilian Cannoli Filling  is made with impastata ricotta which is a thick ricotta not cream. If you can not find impastata put the ricotta in a fine strainer for about a couple hours

I made this by the recipe the first time and liked the floavor but not the texture.  The second time, I added 4 oz cream cheese,and replaced the almonds and cherries with amaretta.  I blended it in the food processor and it turned out perfect.  Similiar taste, much better texture.

Very nice. I have made this before and we also sprinkled a dusting of coffee powder (we have a burr grinder and ground coffee on the finest setting) on a few of the pieces. I liked this a lot. Easy to make and we all enjoyed the taste.

This turned out great....!! I did add a 1/4 teaspoon of orange extract to add a little bit more of the true cannoli flavors, but other then that I will make this again for sure.

I took the advice of some other reviews and just used the choc. chips in my pie. I also just used a regular pie crust as thats what I had on hand. I topped with whipped topping and more choc. chips. My family really liked it and may use this recipe again though I prefer the traditional canoli form.

Pie was very easy and quick to make. Just a note - it took over 3 1/2 hours to thaw.

I must have missed something on this recipe.  It didn't taste like any of the cannolis I have had and I had to throw the whole pie out.  I used a lower fat ricotta, could this have been the problem?  Texture was very grainy and not fluffy as I had expected.  Pie was "gray" in color which didn't appear to be right to me.  Help, this sounded great, I would love to know if I did something wrong to have achieved these results.

I made this without almonds or cherries, using only chocolate chips (a generous amount), & after I poured the filling into the pie shell, I topped it with chocolate chips to make it look more finished. It was pretty good, & was better as leftovers.
