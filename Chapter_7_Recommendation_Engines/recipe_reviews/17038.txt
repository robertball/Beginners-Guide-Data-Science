I felt that there was too much butter in this recipe.  I did not care for it, and I will not be making it again.

My mother made this Cheese Ball for all her entertaining from the early 50's to the present and I continue to use it.  I receive rave reviews whenever I make it.  The only difference is in the amount of butter - I use only 1 cup as opposed to the 1 pound in this recipe.  Men especially love this with the heady blue cheesy flavor.
