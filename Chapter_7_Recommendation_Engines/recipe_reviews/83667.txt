This dish was a little plain. I added more seasoning and served with salsa and cheese. I am interested in trying it again and spicing it up; it has potential. I also want to add eggs to the leftovers for some breakfast tacos.

I wasn't impressed at all.  It was much better after I added some salsa and cheese then put it in a wrap.

I liked this, simple and easy just like my abuelita makes, yes potatoes and all people!! It is not uncommon for picadillo to have potatoes in it...any way I think the only thing missing would be some tomatoes. Thanks =)

This is a good base but I made alot of changes. Here is my version of Turkey Picadillo.
1. Brown 1lb of turkey with half of a large onion diced. Cook until meat is done and onions are translucent. 2. Cut and cube about 3 to 4 Large potatoes or 5 to 6 medium add to meat and onion mixture. 3. Add enough water to cover the mixture add a can of diced tomatoes and a small can of tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, garlic and comino (cumin) let come to a boil and reduce to medium cover and cook until potatoes are tender. Let stand 5 min before serving, with slightly thicken. Sprinkle with cheese and serve with beans and tortillas!!!!

A base recipe, but it needs some tomatoes or tomato sauce Don't listen to the turkey hash reviewers--picadillo can have diced potato or even raisins

This is NOT a recipe for Picadillo. This seems to be a Spicy Turkey Hash. Picadillo traditionally includes tomato/tomato sauce in some form. It has an almost sweet and sour taste. Picadillo is delicious. However this is not a recipe for Picadillo. Please look elsewhere for another recipe. Thanks

This is not a Picadillo recipe - it's a turkey hash recipe.

All I can say is YUM!!  I submitted a pic of my husband enjoying the delicious Turkey Picadillo.  I am not sure how to pronounce it but it was wonderful.  We decided to serve it on soft corn tortillas.  I disagree with alot of the people who have reviewed this recipe who said it was bland, I'm not sure what they did but in our house there were absolutely no leftovers.  YUM!!  YUM!!  YUM!!

I liked the flavors. It did need some moisture so salsa fixed that right up.

Picadillo is not a Mexican dish. It's a Cuban dish and your recipe does have the right ingredients. Do your research before you post.

This is a great base for those interested in making Picadillo. 

I add fresh tomatoes and tomato sauce and up the seasonings/jalapeños based on the audience. If you like it spicier, add more. 

I also use more potato, but that's because my grandma always used a lot in hers and I love them. 

I'm making this tomorrow for a dinner party and plan on:

Cooking the potatoes for a few minutes to start them softening. Cut the pieces small and they will cook faster. 

Then I'll add onion, bell pepper, jalapeño, and garlic and cook for a few minutes. 

Add the ground turkey and brown it. 

Add fresh chopped tomatoes and a can of tomato sauce and a little water because I definitely do not like super dry Picadillo. 

Bring all that to a simmer and begin adding spices. Salt, pepper, cumin, Sriracha powder. 

Let that cook, stirring occasionally. 

Once it's looking good and cooked, taste it! 

Once the flavor levels are where I like them, I will throw in some fresh spinach and stir until it's wilted.

Done! 

If it's too soupy, keep cooking until it thickens some. 

I've also done a variation using sweet potatoes. Definitely turned out awesome.
