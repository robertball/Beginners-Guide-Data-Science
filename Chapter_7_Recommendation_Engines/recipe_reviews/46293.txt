I was initially excited because I had all the ingredients for these muffins, but the finished product was not a sucess at all.  I followed it exactly, except omitted the poppy seeds.  First, the instructions didn't mention when to add the brown sugar, even though it was in the ingredients list.  I just put it in after adding the spices.  I didn't think that 1/2 cup brown sugar alone made it sweet enough. I think some white sugar was needed.  The bitter coffee was just too overpowering.  We didn't like this at all.  Even the sweetness of the fruit didn't help.  I am very disappointed.

I thought these muffins were pretty good. They were dense, heavy and tasty.  Much like a "breakfast cookie." My family thought they weren't as good.  Like the other reviewer said, subbing ingredients was very easy.  I subbed straight bran for the graham crumbs and the cereal.  I added the flour last because I wanted to mix the baking powder with it.  I only needed half of the flour listed, or else I was afraid it would be dry.  I did use the full amount of baking powder.  They turned out very good.  I don't know if I'd miss the white chocolate chips if I made them again, especially since they kind of contradict the rest of the fairly healthy ingredients.  I might be inclined to try making them again using orange juice for the liquid, and chopped orange zest prunes in place of the chocolate chips.

These have so many random ingredients that you can substitute pretty much anything for most of them. I actually followed the recipe fairly closely...changed the AP flour to half WW and half AP; used wheat germ and ground flax in place of the graham crumbs and left out the raisins. This doesn't make a very attractive muffin, but they do taste interesting enough.

These were amazing!  The ingredient list is long.  I substituted flour for the graham crumbs, and poppy seeds for the bran flakes.   I needed to add more milk for the dough to smoothen.  I have made these 3 times already, I can't seem to get tired of them.

There is no salt in this recipe and very little fat so to me they are flat tasting. I tried the recipe again, adding 1/2 tsp salt, 1/3 cup butter, cut the b.p. to 1 TBLsp.---  Better but not great.
I think I just don't like chocolate and spice together.

This is an excellent base recipe.  Most of the ingredients are things you have lying around the kitchen, hoping you can find a use for them.  I used this recipe as a guideline in regards to proportions of moisture, grain flour content, and flavor, but I streamlined the flavors to focus mostly on the mocha-spice angle.  I thought there was so much "going on" in terms of flavors (coffee, spices, poppy, apple, raisins, chocolate) that I tried to simplify the ingredients a bit.  I modified it so much that I cannot make a judgement on the final taste of this recipe.  I will say, I used the same proportions of coffee and sweeteners, plus 2 TBSP honey, and there was a mildly bitter aftertaste that resembled cinnamon more than coffee.  I didn't feel that the coffee overpowered the recipe at all, and feel my muffins would be much better if eaten at breakfast with a cup of coffee- and I'm not really a coffee drinker.  The only thing I might try next time is an additional egg in the batter.  They were moist but somewhat crumbly and might hold together better with more egg.

These tasted good. They were moist, sweet, and had a nice chocolate taste. But, there's just too much going on. They were cumbersome to make with so many ingredients. I didn't cook the oatmeal mixture--didn't see the need for that. I added just a bit more water, as the batter seemed too thick for me. I might make these again, leaving out the poppy seeds and replacing the graham crackers and shredded wheat with more bran flakes. I made half a batch and got 8 muffins. Thanks for the interesting recipe. They did taste good.
