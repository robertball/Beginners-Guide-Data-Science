Delicious - everyone loves them!  You don't have to make them in crescent shapes.  I prefer to make them as little round cookies,  or as little ball cookies - it doesn't matter.

A bit too much flour, I'm going to reduce the amount if I make a next batch.

This is not a very sweet cookie unless you roll them in the powdered sugar. Try one after baking, see if you like it or not as is, then play around with how much powdered sugar you want to add. I shook the cookies up in a bag of powdered sugar to get a nice thick layer of sweetness. Rolling the dough in the almonds was a bit of a hassle for me, next time I'll just add the full 1.5c to the dough/batter. I used my food processor to chop the almonds and in the future I'll process until the almonds are completely ground up - I prefer a more homogeneous cookie. 2c flour worked out well and I didn't need to chill the dough.

I like this cookie very much because it's light and flaky; lightly sweet.  It's super simple and I used almond flour instead of chopped almonds.  I dusted with powder sugar only; no chopped almonds at all.

I made theses for Christmas cookies as one of my 4 types this year.  They came out so good they were everyone's favorite! I used almond flour instead of the ground almonds.

I agree with Monica.  Since it's not a sweet cookie, just powder it with sugar.  It adds to its sweetness.    Chilling the dough makes it easier to roll though.  I love it with my morning coffee.  The cookie jar does not ran out of it.  I love it.
