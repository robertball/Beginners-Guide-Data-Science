This is like a cross between an apple crisp and a coffee cake!  Super easy.   :o)

All-purpose baking mix is Bisquick. You can find it in the baking supplies aisle at the grocery store.

baking mix always turns out a bit salty so add more sugar accordingly.  Also toss the apples in sugar and cinnamon before hand and definitely peel them.  I left the peel on due to laziness and it just wasn't the same

I had someone give me a 32 ounce of apple pie filling. So I used that instead of apples, and omitted the spices (since they were already in the pie filling). 

I didn't have any applesauce on hand, so I've used 1/4 cup of milk instead. Didn't find the need to use vanilla, so didn't use that either. I also added 3/4 cup of walnuts to the oats and baking mixture. 

Next time I will cut the butter to maybe a 1/3 cup (it's really rich other wise.) 

Hubby loved it, wants me to make it again.

I'm not sure why this has such a low rating as we thought it was good. I'm not sure if I had 6 cups of apples as I cored and diced 10 apples that I had. Tossed them with 1/4 cup of sugar and 1 tablespoon of homemade pie spice blend. For the topping I used 2 cups of baking mix (Bisquick) and half cup of the rolled oats, only 1/4 cup brown sugar and subbed rum extract for vanilla. Used homemade chai-spiced applesauce. Skipped the spices in the topping and chose to add the melted butter into the mix then crumbling it over the apples. Overall, I'd make a few changes. I would use more apples or reduce the topping (1 cup baking mix & 1 cup of rolled oats) leave out the extract and potentially use more applesauce (maybe 1/2 cup). Great served warm with vanilla ice cream.

I found this too thick and gummy.  It was not the traditional crisp I wass looking for.  It was more like a bread.

I used red delicious apples and 2 Macintosh apples. It turned out moist and I did sprinkle some white sugar over it. My husband liked it.

taste very good just a little dry.  I will try to add a little more apple sauce.  Definitely making again.
