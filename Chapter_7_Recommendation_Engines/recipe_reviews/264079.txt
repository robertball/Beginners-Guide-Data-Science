I rarely try untested recipes but I thought I would give it a shot.  My GF liked it and I thought it was pretty good.  I found it a little bland and with the proper spices it could be kicked up some.  I made it as listed except I didn't have plain Gouda so I used a smoked gouda I had on hand.  My cheese didn't melt and become all gooey like I expected.  Overall, It was OK.  I will make again with a couple of added spices.

I made this following the recipe to the letter. It was delicious. It was easy and fast. A great snack.  Now I have so many ideas to change it up a little.

I read other reviews that claimed this was bland if additional spices weren't added, so I used some mixed up garlic salt, a dash of cayenne pepper, and some chicken seasoning.  It turned out well!  Even the cheese stuck to the pan was browned, bubbly, and delicious.

Like the previous reviewer, I would say it isn't bad, but it is a little blah. You taste the garlic, cilantro, and cheese, but something seems to be missing ... maybe tomato sauce and some Italian sausage!
