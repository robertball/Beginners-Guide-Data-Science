I'm rating this dish again because so many people feel the need to change it.  I agree that it does seem a little bland.  I promise you all....replace 1 Tbs with Emeril's Essence Original.  This is the only change I needed to perk up the flavor without changing the overall taste of the dish.  The sauce is not meant to be a gravy it is more of a sauce.  It also thickens upon standing.  I use brown rice.  I have 2 VERY picky kids.  I mean it PICKY!!!  They will eat this any day of the week, probably even for breakfast!  OOPS FORGOT....ALSO CHOP THE CHICKEN.  IT DOES WONDERS FOR THE FLAVOR!

We pretty much followed the recipe but added some chopped garlic, sliced mushrooms and about 1/4 cup white wine, only used half the chicken stock, increased the flour and butter to 2 tablespoons each.  The consistency was perfect!  Served over noodles -- excellent!

After reading mixed reviews and loads of suggestions to fix the blandness, I have solved the problem.  Add a small amount of chicken boullion when you add the broth!!  I think it added just enough flavor to make this dish absolutely delicious!!

I loved this recipe but did alter a bit, Aren't we all suppose to "DR." our food? I was really looking forward to a savory dish when I added the paprika to the onions, but 2 cups of chicken broth was probably too much. The result is watery. I did DR. mine with other seasonings, experiment to your taste buds! Next time I will cut the broth in half. I also thought maybe a 1/4 cup of white wine would give it more of a zing.

Well, I was a big fan of this dish, but I wish I'd read more than just the first page of reviews.  Maybe I wouldn't have been expecting it to thicken up.  I used lowfat sour cream , and I'm sure that didn't help, but I don't think it would have made any real difference to speak of had I used the regular stuff.  Other than that, it was just what I was expecting and hoping for.  My fiance told me that it was good but it tasted like it was missing something.  Then proceeded to help himself to seconds.  Maybe next time I'll throw in some red pepper flakes for him.  (Because there will definately be a next time!)

This is a delicious chicken dish!  It turns out creamy and full of flavor every time.  I serve it over penne pasta but can't wait to try it over rice!  I like my food on the spicy side so I often add 1/2 - 1 tsp. of cayenne pepper.  Great recipe - thanks for sharing!

This recipe has been in our Bohemian family for generations - very similar with a few small exceptions: First, saute the onion in a bit of oil, then cover the surface of it with Hungarian hot paprika. Add a cut up whole chicken which has been salted. Stir to coat. Add the broth (or just water)and cook til chicken is tender.

The biggest difference is making a small drop dumpling that we call "Hlousky". It's made with flour, egg, milk. Mix til smooth. It should be thick. Scoop up the batter with a tablespoon and using a teaspoon, spoon and drop into the boiling water. (Dip that teaspoon into the boiling hot water between scoops to clean)
    When they float to the top, remove, drain and add to buttered dish until all done. On each plate, pour the sour cream gravy and chicken over the hlousky and enjoy. Little bit of heaven!

really good but for more 'kick', i like to add lemon juice and/or white wine when simmering the chicken in the stock.

I would give this recipe six stars if I could. The paprika and sour cream in the rich, creamy sauce wake up boneless skinless chicken breasts. I was pleasantly surprised at how delicious this easy to prepare dish was.   To tenderize the chicken before cooking, I cut the breasts in half lengthwise and pounded them a bit between two sheets of plastic wrap. And because I wanted smaller pieces, I cut the pounded breast pieces in two. I seasoned the breast pieces with a little seasoned salt before browning them in the skillet.  I followed the other directions to the letter, except I mixed in a tbsp of cornstarch instead of flour in to the sour cream.   This dish exceed my expectations. I served the chicken and sauce with mashed potatoes, but this would also be good over egg noodles.

I changed this recipe to be both dairy free and gluten free.  I substituted soy-based sour cream and 1 tsp of cornstarch in place of the flour and omitted the butter.  It was really delicious.  The second time I made it, I added yellow squash and mushrooms when sauteeing the onions which worked well and made it a more substantial dish.  I serve it over rice with sauteed spinach on the side - a nice combo.

I was really looking forward to a savory dish when I added the paprika to the onions, but two cups of chicken broth was probably too much.  The result is watery (even after adding corn starch the recipe doesn;t call for) and almost bland.  If I make it again, I will cut the broth in half.  I also thought maybe a 1/4 cup of white wine would give it more zing.

Hmmmmmm....we were all kind of on the fence about this one. The recipe sounded terrific, but my family and I agreed that there just seemed to be something missing. I can't put my finger on what that something could be being that I certainly used enough seasonings and even tryed to give it a little zip with some cayenne. Not that it was bad by any means, just a little underwhelming.

The recipe is easy to make, my Hungarian husband liked it, however and since I have already tried other "Chicken Paprika" recipes I added and reduced as I was going. I added green and red peppers, crushed hot peppers, chopped tomates and garlic, I reduced the chicken broth and the sour cream. It tourned out really good.

I always makes this recipe..but I use a package of onion soup mix instead of the whole onion. That is how my mom taught me. I mix the onion soup with one cup of boiling water. Instead of the chicken broth.  But if you use the chicken broth cut it to one cup. This recipe my father told me that it is Hungain pass down from generation to generation.. But my Dad added the onion soup mix..

We would give it 3  1/2 stars.  I think the chicken itself was a bit bland; it didn't absorb a lot of the flavor from the sauce.  The sauce was very good.  Perhaps shredding the chicken would be better.  This time I cubed it.  I also sauteed 5 cloves of garlic before adding onion (2 cups), celery, and carrots.  I put a pinch of black pepper and cayenne pepper in with the paprika.  I used only 1 cup of chicken broth.  I actually thought it may not have been quite enough liquid.

I saw all of the good reviews and was highly disapointed.  Bland Bland Bland.  A little experimentation yields much better results.  First, don't use a non-stick pan.  Make sure you have all that residue in the pan from the browning and use 1/4 of white wine to deglaze.  Second, Use Smoked Hungarian Paprika, not the typical supermarket fare.  This dish will only be as good as the paprika used.  Once you have a good paprika, use twice as much as called for.  Also add 1/2 teaspoon each of Black and Hot Pepper of choice.  Finally, mix 1 cup of flour and 2 cups of chicken stock before adding to the pan.  I mix them is a sports bottle making sure the flower is well dissolved.  This makes for a thick and consistant sauce.  BTW, my favorate source for the paprika is Auntie Arwen.  Google it.

This is a good basic recipe almost identical to ones I found in my Hungarian cookbooks. .  If you want a thick gravy, stir a couple of Tbps. flour into sour cream before adding to the broth.  Chicken paprika (paprikash) is a bland dish meant to be served over boiled spaetzles.

Quick, Easy, minimal ingredients, not too unhealthy, creamy, yummy flavor and the WHOLE family liked!  Will be making this about once a month! I did add chopped carrot and celery, and a sprinkle of garlic-herb seasoning. Home cooking at its best!

This recipe is perfectly fine except it has a bit too much liquid.  The problem is that people must be using the wrong kind of paprika!  If you use the sweet bland kind, then of course it will be a bland, boring dish.  This is a traditional Hungarian dish - use Hungarian hot paprika and it will be wonderful!

This was a wonderfully different Chicken recipe.  My children loved the sauce over the egg noodles and I was very surprised how it warmed up for leftovers.  Noodles were nice and moist.  The sauce did not get soaked into the noodles.  A great recipe.

I followed the recipe pretty much as directed, but from reading other reviews, did add extra paprika.  All in all, it was just an okay recipe. I had a Chicken Paprika recipe years ago, that would nearly set your mouth on fire...it was amazing. Sadly this did not come close to what I was looking for, but it is good for those with a mild taste preference.

This was so good.  I only used one cup broth. I chopped the chicken, before cooking, and served over pasta.  I also served some of the sauce over veggies, it was good.

My boyfriend thinks this is bland but I love it - it is a rich, comforting, subtle flavor.  For his sake I sometimes add red pepper, celery, and/or garlic.

WOW! My family just loved this recipe! I used some of the suggestions in the reviews. I cubed the chicken for easy eating for my little ones. I used half the chicken broth that it called for and added a boullion cube for added flavor. The thickness was just right, more like a sauce. We ate ours with shell pasta. Everyone had seconds and sopped up the sauce with bread to "lick the platter clean". We'll be doing this one again and again. It was simple and delicious! Thanks for the recipe!

This was fantastic!  I loved the consistancy and the creaminess of the sauce.  I added 4 cloves of garlic (LOVE garlic) and I only had half a container of sour cream but it worked out PERFECTLY.  I also only used one cup of chicken stock.  Oh yes and since I love cooking dishes with veggies I also cut up one zuccini and threw it in with the onions.    Delicious as leftovers!

This is pretty good! I love sour cream based sauces and chicken ever since I tried it at a Mexican restaurant a few years back. 

I would cut down the onions used and chop them really fine in a food processor as I think the texture and flavor, as is, are a bit overpowering.

This was good and something different. I had to add a little cornstarch to get the sauce to thicken and served over egg noodles.

This is one of the favorite recipes from my childhood. I couldn't believe some of the reviews saying it was bland so I took a closer look at the ingredients. First I checked the paprika and 2 T. is quite enough! Then I noticed it called for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. No wonder!  Do this: use chicken breasts on the bone and legs (or your favorite pieces) and remove the skin.  Wella! the bones will add flavor! Salt and pepper to taste. AND: don't use that much sour cream (this too might have diluted the flavor), I use 3-4 big dollops, which is all you need. YUM!

My Husband says, "Um! Um! Um!" Chicken was very tender (I removed the chicken to oven and finished at 225 degrees while I made sauce, bowtie pasta and peas.) I am new to Paprika
and expected more from this spice.  Thickened sauce with cornstarch. Will make again!

I love this recipe--and my VERY PICKY BOYS love it, too.  It MUST be made with full-fat (regular) sour cream (not low-fat) or it just won't taste good (I tried it both ways and there is a HUGE difference). If your kids are picky onion eaters, you can chop them long and take out when serving,  Once your kids get used to the taste, you can chop the onions small again.  I usually use 1.5 cubes of organic stock in 2 cups of boiled water...I am also very generous with my 2T of paprika and with the flour in the sour cream.  I think I make this dish every 10 days or so, and we love it over plain white rice :)  Thanks DEME for the great recipe!  It's now a part of our family meals :)

I'm really just a noobie cook so I get really excited when something new sparkles on my tongue. Or more specifically - in that special zone way in the back of my tongue where the flavor buds seem to jump for joy. This was particularly delicious - I think I was lucky and just got it right the first time..  and it gave me the chance to dip back into my (frozen) chicken stock. I added mushrooms and about a third cup of white wine, cutting back on the stock. Also thickened with a little more than 2 tablespoons of flour. Over penne. My lovely wife said this was about her very favorite of many recent recipes, and I have to agree!

Great little recipe. I'm glad I read the reviews before I attempted this for the first time. I did most of it like it said, but only added a homemade version of Emeril's Essence to the butter/onion saute, just 1 cup of homemade chicken stock and a lil (less than 1/4 cup of) cooking sherry. Didn't need much else because the Essence took care of it all. I also sauteed the chicken with Lawry's garlic salt and used penne instead of the egg noodles. I can see how it would be an egg noodle dish because it somewhat resembles a beef stroganoff. Don't worry about overseasoning before adding the sour cream as it tends to bland things down a bit.

Excellent!  We served with rice.  Also, the next time we would pound the breasts to make them flatter so they will cook quicker, be less dry and be more tender.  Without pounding, ours turned out a little dry. Our sauce took longer than we expected to thicken.  The next time we will thicken the sauce a bit FIRST then simmer a little longer with the chicken.

Veeeery good!  I did make some changes though.  I only used half the chicken broth and I added some minced garlic, 1/4 cup white wine, black pepper, and crushed red pepper flakes for a kick.  I will absolutely make this dish again!

my mom used to make this and it was dead on! However, I called her and learned that she used carrots and celery too. So- I added 3/4 cup of carrots sliced thin and 3/4 cup of celery, chopped. I added both at the same time as the onions and it turned out great! Served with white rice was perfect.

This is an awesome dish. Don't believe the negativity in some of these reviews. I made mashed potatoes on the side, which went perfectly with the sauce.

this is actually quite a good base recipe--the directions need a lot of altering though. there is too little flour called for, and too much paprika. after sauteeing the onions in butter (i used 1 Tbsp), add 1 Tbsp. of paprika, cook for a minute, then add 1 Tbsp flour and cook, stirring, for another minute or two. stir in 1 cup of chick broth, let cook down until it starts to thicken then stir in the other cup of broth, add the chicken back into the sauce, and simmer over low heat until sauce is thickened. whisk in sour cream and you're done. delicious over brown rice...

I have a 100 yr old Hungarian friend who told me how to make this dish. Actually you should use a whole chicken cut up, but to save time and fat I use chicken breasts and canned broth. Use 1 can, 14 oz. add 1 lg chopped tomato and 1 chopped green bell pepper. Dont stir in sour cream until just before serving.
Use Hungarian sweet paprika add a little hot paprika for kick if you like.  Really good stuff

This dish was excellent--with my tweaking and variations.  I halved the amount of onions and chicken broth.  I added a few cloves of garlic, minced with the onions.  Instead of plain paprika, I used the "Emeril's Essence" concoction.  (Google "Emeril's Essence copycat recipe"...)  I used the called for amount of sour cream, non-fat.  With only half the chicken broth, I didn't use flour or cornstarch and it thickened wonderfully.  We devoured this over brown rice.  I can't wait to try other variations on the spices with this dish!

super easy and fast.  I had to make some modifications.  I only had 4 oz sour cream so added 4 oz of cream cheese into the flour/cream mixture and whisked it in.  I added 2 tbsp. flour and a can of chicken stock.  I think 1 tbsp would have made the sauce very thin.  It could be a very low fat recipe if using low fat.  The flavor is nice.  I added some tunisian chili powder (similar to cayenne) for some zip and fresh chopped parsley for garnish.  Served over pasta, as I didn't have enough egg noodles but think the egg noodles or periogies would be a great choice.

I liked this recipe. It is very important to remember NOT ALL PAPRIKAS ARE THE SAME! There is sweet paprika, hot paprika, smoked paprika. But for most, McCormick's, which has no flavor and is to be used only to garnish.

very good! kids liked it okay they're not too fond of onions but that's okay, I didn't have any paprika so I used instead seasoned salt (replace the regular salt) and used a 1/4 teaspoon of cyanne pepper...worked really well!

I think the next time I will add more flour. The  taste is amazing but mine just did not thicken enough.  However I will make it again. I may even add a little zucchini to it.

Outstanding! Because others mentioned it could be a bit bland, note the following:
1. Use bite sized pieces of chicken (more browned suraces!)
2. Salt and pepper chicken
3. use 1/2 cup onion  instead of 1 cup,  but add a large chopped shallot and 2 (or more to taste) finely  chopped garlic cloves (don't burn garlic, add to pan just before chicken stock.)
4. ADD CUP OF FROZEN PEAS at the same time you add the chicken back into pan.
5. Toss this sauce with one pound short pasta (gemelli, bowties, penne etc) remember to reserve a cup of pasta water ...add a few spoonfuls to the pasta while tossing, reserve the rest in case it dries out.
6. TOP WITH GRATED PARMESAN OR ROMANO cheese...use the good stuff!
NO LEFTOVERS!

Being of Eastern European descent, I was hoping for a nice Hungarian Paprikash recipe. To do so, the sauce must be thick. I replaced the oil with unsalted butter. I used 2 T good quality Hungarian paprika. I added 1/2 cup dry white wine to the sautéed onions, then reduced down. I added only 1 C of chicken stock (reduced sodium, organic). I increased the flour to 2 tsp. Delicious! My hubs is very picky, and he loved it. Will make again.

I made this the 1st time just as directed here. It was very good indeed.

The 2nd time, (last night) I used B-S chicken thighs (each cut in half) and everybody seemed to like that better. (I say, mix up the dark and light meat) Also because there was about 1/2 cup of flat champagne in the fridge, I marinaded the thighs in that with some garlic and leafy spices (Y'know....parsley, basil, oregano... that kind of stuff. Use your faves. Might add some cumin next time) for about 45 minutes before browning. I used the left over marinade as part of the stock. I also added about 1/4 Teasp red pepper flakes. (Paprika doesn't seem to have the oomph it used to.) As has been suggested, mushrooms sound like a good addition too... will do that next time.

I had a guest who didn't want dairy in his. So I separated a portion of chicken, and before I added the sour cream, I reserved some of the sauce sans sour cream and put it in its own little skillet. I used a little four to thicken it after bringing it to a boil. I did the "take some liquid from the pan, put it in a small jar with some flour (or corn starch), put the lid on and shake it good" thing then stirred it into boiling liquid in the little skillet. Then I just put the reserved chicken in the little skillet with that sauce sans s-c (more of a glaze now) and heated it all through like you would with the sour cream sauce. It was yummy. 

So, if you don't do dairy, you can still do this without it and it's very yummy....tho' different.

Hearty creamy goodness.  We have made this twice and the second time was much, MUCH better than the first.  I added a little bit more flour the second time and it thickened up very nice.  This will become one of our go to dishes.

This is rich, easy to make and tasty. I ate this over brown rice. It makes for a fantastic meal. 

I also added peas because I love peas. It would have been good without them too...but I LOVE peas with my chicken.

This dish grew on me, and I ultimately liked it quite a bit. It gets points because I don't like sour cream very much at all, but this recipe actually made it tasty to me. I generally made it exactly as written, opting to cut the chicken breasts into bite-size chunks. The recipe didn't say whether to empty the pan between steps 1 and 2, so when I cooked the onion in butter, there was also the remaining oil and chicken juices from step 1. It quickly became apparent, though, that the sauce was pretty liquid, and I probably simmered it another 30 minutes or so until it was even slightly thickened. I quickly made a batch of boiled long-grain white rice to serve this on, to soak up the sauce, and that worked well. A little surprisingly, the leftovers kept well in my fridge, and reheated well - the sauce was the desired thickness when I took it out of the fridge the second night. In fact, I enjoyed the leftovers even more than when the dish was hot on the stove. This might be even better served over egg noodles, but I think serving it on a bed of white rice worked wonderfully. I may even make this again sometime!

Not what I expected. I used the right amount of paprika but it came out looking very red.nothing like the picture. Also I had to use extra flour because the sauce wasn't  getting thick. I did use some crushed red pepper and a little tomato paste. It taste ok but not good enough for me to cook this again.

I loved this dish. It was so easy to make and so tasty! I don't get why everyone said it was bland...it was lovely! I used a little bit less chicken stock than the recipe calls for just to make sure it wasn't too watery but I ended up adding it all in anyway. It was great over wholemeal penne pasta!

had this with potatoes and peas instead of pasta. sooo good. I marinated chicken thighs for half hr as it was defrosting. maybe that helped.   1. microwaved large chunks of potatoes for 7 minutes in the microwave on high until tender to fork 2. while potatoes cook, add diced chicken, peas and onions coated with salt, pepper, paprika a in pan with oil, 10 minutes. 3. throw in potatoes, sprinkle additional salt, pepper, paprika and cook on high for 2 minutes. 4. remove everything from pan and heat up 1/2 cup water with flour, butter and sour cream until bubbles. thick sauce 5. pour into dish and serve.

This was great. My boyfriend couldn't get enough and declared it as his new favorite dish. After reading the reviews I did do some adjustments though. I added sliced mushrooms and minced garlic to the onion and spiced up the sauce with some cayenne pepper, black pepper and Italian herbs. It had just the right amount of flavor and went really well with the rice.

Delicious!!!  Our family enjoyed this very much.  Following the other reviews, I only used 1 cup of broth, (well maybe 1 1/4 cup) because we do like it thicker, and  1 1/2 TBSP of paprika.  And I used sweet hungarian paprika as well (because it is a little more powerful).  I will try only 1 TBSP next time and compare.   I did serve it over noodles, but will experiment with spaetzel, and dumplings in the future.  This recipe was so fast then the one I usually make which takes 2 plus hours and has a more concentrated flavor as well.  Thanks!!

Very good, I followed the recipe exactly and thought it might not be salty enough, but it was great. We served it over egg noodles with broccoli on the side. I think this will go into our regular rotation! :-)

Based on reviews complaining of bland flavor and runny sauce, I put my own spin on this one.  I added a little cajun seasoning to the chicken with the paprika.  Then, because I love sauce and lots of it, I added a whole can of cream of mushroom soup; would have used cream of chicken but was out.  I added about 1 cup of chicken broth, mixed an additional 1/4 cup broth with corn starch to help with sauce thickening and it worked great, I ended up with a perfect consistancy.  To get rid of some stuff in the fridge, I added 1/2 of a chopped orange bell pepper and about 5 cloves of ROASTED garlic when sauteing the onion.  At the very end, I stirred in about 1.5Tb chopped fresh parsley.  Served this over egg noodles.  My fiance and his 15-yr old son both had seconds, and the teenager said it was "killer good" and asked when I would make this again!

This was a great recipe. I  cut back on the chicken stock used with the sour cream, but used the extra to simmer the chicken in. I added a touch of cayenne pepper to kick it up a little bit, substituted the onion for shallots, and added some sliced carrots and frozen peas to add some veggies to it. My room mate (who is a picky eater) devoured it, then went back for seconds =)

I hate leaving negative reviews, but this was really terrible.  Thank goodness I decided I wanted to serve the sauce over fried chicken and never added the chicken back into the pan, so I only ruined sour cream instead of 6 chicken breasts too.  The flavor was just plain weird.  The whole pan of sauce went down the drain.

It was straightforward, simple, and quick, which are all things I prize in a mid-week meal. My boyfriend did the majority of the cooking for this one and added some Dill for a bit more tartness, it enhanced the tartness of the sour cream nicely. He also threw in another half a teaspoon of paprika. We only used a cup of broth, which was plenty as it still took a fairly long time for the sauce to reduce. The end result however was pleasing and tasty with rice. I'm pretty sure we'll make this again before long, it's just so simple and flexible, you could really use any spice, it doesn't have to be paprika at all, it could have been cumin or even a curry powder.

This turned out really well! But, I did take a few recommendations from other reviewers and decreased the chicken stock to a little under 1 cup. As for the prep and cooking, I did doctor it a bit to keep the flavor in the chicken as well as the sauce. First, I marinated big chunks of chicken breast with half the paprika, salt, pepper, and a bit of oregano. I let that sit for a few hours. I cooked the onion in butter first, set it aside, cooked the chicken, set it aside. I cooked the sauce by itself and added some garlic salt and the rest of the paprika. Once it thickened a bit, I put the onions and chicken back in and in about 2 mins, it was done. Perfect over pasta.

This is a great crowd pleaser: simple to make, fantastic flavor. I've made it many times -- and insisted that others make it! Over time I have modified it slightly: I slice the onions into half-moons, and I add the flour to the onions (to cook off the raw flour taste) before seasoning with the paprika, etc. You can leave it simmering after the addition of the stock if you need to delay the serving time. I serve it over egg noodles, but rice also works well.

I found that the recipe called for way too much chicken stock. The result came out too watery and the sauce never thickened, even after adding more thickening. I fixed it by adding in fettuccine pasta into the entire mixture. With a little more chicken breast, it was alright but I don't think I will ever make this again. Also, there is too much paprika. If you love paprika, this is your dish

This is a delicious, easy meal and I made it easier by cooking my onions and butter in the microwave while cooking the chicken.  I also only used only 1 cup of broth and mine came out a perfect consistency. Fast easy meal you can feel comfortable serving company.

I removed the onions from the recipe and added corn starch (1 to 2 tsp in 1/4 cup hot water) to thicken the sauce.  It took me longer than 40 minutes to have this recipe ready for the table. The sauce wouldn't thicken.  Other these two adjustments/problems, I would make the recipe again, because it was flavorful.

I thought this was a good recipe, but it needed more flavor to suit our tastes. I added 2 cloves garlic (love that stuff!), crushed red pepper, and some fresh chopped parsley at the end before serving. I didn't have egg noodles on hand, so I cooked spaghetti and mixed it with the chicken/sauce. Next time I think I'll try adding more flavor such as mushrooms, roasted red pepper, or some parmesan cheese. Play with this recipe to suit your own tastes.

I was definitely not impressed with this recipe.  I reduced the broth by a 1/2 cup and used white wine in place of some of the broth.  I also added fresh garlic and used 2 t. of flour.  The sauce still did not thicken until it  had cooled - by that time we were done eating.  I thought it was very bland - all you could taste was the sour cream.  I gave it 2 stars because it was edible, I just won't be making it again.

Sounded good, but as someone wrote... Underwhelming.  I added Cayenne, I added salt, I added corn starch (as it wasn't thickening) and it was finally just ok (thanks to the above), but still would not make again.  Maybe I should have tried adding the Emeril Essence as someone suggested (LOVE that stuff).  Try "Easy & Delicious Chicken" (but made in a crock pot) MUCH tastier.

This is easy to make and very tasty.  I added less paprika and salt to suit my family's taste.  My five-year old didn't like the looks of it (probably the onions), but I thought the sauce was delicious.

Great basic recipe!
Instead of yellow or white onion, I used the white portion of scallions.
I also added another 1/3 cup of sour cream after I removed from the heat.
Very nice.

The secret to this recipe is to increase the paprika. I use 2  TBSP of SMOKED paprika and ay least  1 TBSP of Hungarian sweet paprika. 

If I don't add smoked paprika the recipe is way too bland. Also, since I'm on WW, I cook the chicken in 1 1/2 tsp of olive oil and serve with riced cauliflower.

I used this recipe as a base. Added 1 clove of minced garlic with the onion. Reduced the chicken broth to 1.5 cup and added .5 cup of Napoleon Brandy. Added dash ofGrey Poupon mustard to taste. The sauce was still too thin. However, the taste was fantastic! No complaints from my crew!

Made this recipe to use up some sour cream I had. Love this bc it’s delicious and all the ingredients I had on hand! I did add 3-4 cloves of garlic and I used chicken thighs instead as I think they are more flavorful than breasts. I actually did not have enough paprika so I went with maybe a 1 1/2 tbsp paprika with a half tbsp of some paprika heavy blackening I had on hand. I know some ppl were saying this wasn’t super flavorful, but I think all you really need to do is use a more flavorful cut of meat. This is probably the best dish I have made in a while. Served this with brown rice since everyone said the sauce was thin; it absorbed so nicely and I am in love. I think next time I may add mushrooms and continue to sub some of the blackening haha, it added a tinge of heat that was nice.

I'll be honest, the reviews that say this recipe is a bit bland and watery are right.  Here's how I fixed it:
1) Slice the chicken breasts, pat dry, and then coat with a mixture of flour, paprika, salt, pepper, and garlic powder before pan-frying it.  Briefly brown both sides of the chicken but don't cook through, this will add a lot of flavor without the chicken getting overcooked and tough when you add it back to the sauce.
2) After sauteeing the onions in butter and adding the paprika, sprinkle the flour directly into the pan (instead of mixing it into the sour cream) and cook for about a minute, stirring constantly, to create a roux.  This will give the sauce a much better consistency, as it will now thicken properly.

I love this recipe.  My mom made a similar version when I was growing up.  We pound the chicken to get some thinner cuts and add a pinch of cayenne pepper to taste for a small kick.

I had to add some things to perfect the recipe and break the strong paprika taste. I added half a lemon, 2 teaspoons of chili paste, and half a tomato chopped. It turned out really good after these changes.

Made this and we loved it! I only used 1/2 tbsp of paprika and added some dried basil, black pepper and garlic powder instead. Put it on top of tri color rotini. Yum!

This looked so good, but unfortunately was lacking in flavor. After we added salt, pepper and cilantro, we were able to enjoy it. It's a good start...just needs a little extra herbs and spices to make it more flavorful.

This is delicious. However, we really like the taste of paprika so we added extra plus more sour cream. Used the low fat sour cream & it came out perfect. This is a keeper.

Listen. I have literally NEVER reviewed anything on any recipe site (although I cook often), but I literally, and actually literally, not the popular figuratively literally, created this account to review this to tell you all to follow another user's advice here about adding the packet of onion soup mix, whisked into one cup boiling water, in lieu of the chicken broth. It adds a phenomenal umami flavor that I would imagine is exactly what the other reviewers said was missing from the original. It adds a ton of flavor, so if you wanna go easier on that salty, savory taste, maybe try half or 3/4 of a packet of mix to the one cup of water, but TRUST ME. Just do it.  I gave the recipe four stars just because this addition is, to me, vital. Otherwise, I also added minced garlic right when the onion started to soften and did NOT make up for the additional liquid it calls for (meaning the one cup of soup mix soup was all I added). I served it over orecchiette pasta as that's what I happened to have. Insanely delicious.

Made it for the first time last night using almost exact instructions.  I agree with the tips here (slice the chicken and reduce the stock to 1.5 cups) and I definitely put in more onion than a cup - probably closer to two.  Next time I'll probably use reduced fat sour cream.  I had been gifted with some Hungarian paprika from a friend who visited and I used hot (as opposed to sweet) paprika and it was ANYTHING but bland - so delicious!  Suggest seeking out hot paprika when you try it next.

I made this tonight for the first time.  It was a huge success, and I have a very picky eater that rarely raves about dinner.  I left out the onions (picky eater), but added mushrooms instead.  I also put an extra tablespoon of paprika and flour (gluten-free) to make it more thick and add a little more flavor.  I will definitely make this again and again.

I've made this recipe at least a dozen times over the last few years.  It's so easy and always a pleaser, whether I'm making it for two or for a larger group!  I do salt and pepper and cut the chicken into bite size pieces before browning (I live at high altitude, so smaller pieces are easier to cook).  Additionally, while I saute the onion, I add crushed garlic and fresh sliced mushrooms.  This is totally personal preference and just a suggestion.  The recipe is also excellent as written!

Simple yet tasty!  I hate when people substitute and/or change stuff and then rate it like it's the same recipe... but then I'm doing the same thing now!  I used chicken thighs instead of breasts since I prefer dark meat.  I also added an extra tablespoon of flour & a 1/4 cup milk for fun.  I'll make this again for sure!

Great taste. I set into two servings, followed the recipe except i used 1/2 cup of water (asking 1cup of broth for 2 servings. I used water because i didn't have broth, just added half of chicken buillon. I added minced garlic and sliced mushroom. Turns out great. Pour it into whole grain penne and dash with basil. Sauce turns thick while i was eating. Similar taste for chicken milano. I will definetly cook this again.

I made this last night for my boy friend and I" He loved it! since it was my first attempt I went exactly by the recipe. The reason I only gave it four stars was I thought the paprika was a little bit over powering" so next time I may use half as much. I served it over rice and had corn on the cob as our side. Its a wonderful dish,and I will make it again for sure. But next time I may put some chopped artichokes in the sauce because we love them and I think it will go very nicely with it! Thanks for the recipe , You make me look like the best cook in town! And like they say" The best way to please a man is through his stomach  :- ) So he's not going any where!

I did really like the taste, but even with putting less liquid than called for and aging corn starch to help it thicken, the "sauce" was so thin.  Also, I noticed pictures and other reviews mention putting this with pasta or rice, but the ingredient list and directions don't mention that at all. I think it's probably a good idea to have something like pasta to soak up some of the excess liquid. I would make this again but with much less chicken stock/broth. I used smoked paprika due to personal preference too, which I really enjoyed.

Great recipe, but I agree that it would be bland without a little more love added.  I added the chicken bouillon as recommended, 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes, as well as 2 T of flour and 2 T of corn starch with 1/4 cup of water mixed together and added to thicken.

I made a single-breast version of this, keeping other ingredients proportional.  It was delicious.  I paired it with fresh peas and carrots and lentils as a side dish.  Yum.  Easy, quick, tasty.

This was a great recipe but needed tweeking. I used olive oil and butter and I seasoned the chicken with S&P. I used half the broth and half the sour cream half the paprika.  I also put the chicken back in sauce and reduced for a few minutes. It was not bland! I roasted little potatoes and drenched everything in the sauce. It was really good!

Excellent!  I made minor changes based on previous reviews.  Used 1/2  the broth, about 1/4 cup white wine, and added fresh mushrooms.  Even my husband loved it, and he thinks most food I make is bland.  Will definitely make again.

My Hungarian grandmother made a very similar dish to this when I was a child, served on a bed of cabbage. While this wasn't exactly the same thing, it was close enough to give me flashbacks.  I did add a bullion cube for extra flavor.  I will be making this again.

The sauce wasn't thick at all even after I added another teaspoon of flour.  The taste was good, however it needed more salt.  I think garlic would've been a good addition.

I just added button mushrooms & served over sour cream mashed potatoes.  It was really good.  It's even better the next day after the flavors have some time to marry.  I'll make it early next time & leave in my crock-pot on low/warm during the day.  Good, comforting dish.  My family thinks it's a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

I added a little lemon juice for kick and a little more flour to thicken also used about half of red bell pepper (chopped) And only used about half the chicken broth as we like the sauce creamier. Was absolutely delish. My picky husband and 3 year old loved it.

We love this dish, I got this recipe from a friend. One time when she made it she didn't have smoked paprika, so she used some smoked salt in it. It was amazing! She also uses split chicken breasts, poaches them in the liquid and the meat just falls off the bone. It is a fav at our house!

This will be a favorite in my family. It was easy and extremely tasty. I did follow the recipe and added some portabello mushrooms - yummy.

Followed directions exactly. The sauce was to runny. I think 2 cups of the stock was to much. However, The overall flavor was good.

Fantastic!  I took two other readers' suggestions and added mushrooms, garlic, only 1 cup of broth and 1/2 cup of wine.  I added 2 1/2 tablespoons of paprika instead of two.  Also used cornstarch instead of flour.  I added a little sea salt at the table, other none otherwise.  Loved it, great recipe, and I'll definitely make it again--like next week!

I tried this recipe and recommend several revisions:
1) use red onions (2)
2) use hot Hungarian paprika (3 tablespoons or more)
3) use more flour (1-2 tablespoons)
Add more chicken broth if sauce too thick.

For anyone who thinks this recipe is bland or that something is 'missing', make sure you use Hungarian paprika.  It has a rich and sweeter flavor than Spanish paprika, and in my opinion really makes the difference in this dish. Also, whisk the sour cream in a little at a time, it mixes better and won't curdle that way.

I altered in to include what I had in my kitchen and to give it more kick.  I used cream cheese for half of the sour cream, and added kidney beans, celery, chili pepper, and bell pepper when I added the chicken.  I also added half a can of spicy slasa at the very end.  The result was amazing!  Throw some extra veggies and spice in and you are all set.

After reading through previous reviews, I was prepared for blandness so I made a few modifications.  I used diced chicken seasoned with one teaspoon kosher salt, half a teaspoon black pepper, and three teaspoonfuls Mexican paprika (sweet paprika would work with a dash of cayenne).  I also used one and a half medium onions and one large clove of garlic.  I added a can of petite diced tomatoes (with the juice) with the sour cream instead of using chicken broth and thickened the sauce with a tablespoonful of cornstarch.

My family agreed that it came out quite good; definitely something I'd make again!

I've been making this recipe for years.  Those that are having trouble....here's some helpful advice.....----> You need to let the chicken cook down a bit and let the broth decrease before adding the sour cream/flour mixture. You also have to constantly stir the sour cream/flour mixture to help in the thickening process. If you want more zing....add more paprika. I use three tablespoons. My family loves this. Pour it over rice. I think it's better than over noodles. Hope this helps.

Loved this, although I took the suggestion of others and added garlic and half a pinch of cayenne pepper and because I can't eat anything without cracked pepper a couple of twists. I also added 1/2 red capsicum with the onions and garlic to give it a bit of colour

This is a delicious dish!!! I used 1 1/2 cups of chicken stock instead of 2 cups. Also added a little extra flour to the sour cream to thicken up the sauce a little more.  If you want this dish to have extra flavor I highly recommend using Hungarian Paprika. Hint:  German Spaetzle (dumplings) for a side instead of noodles or rice is an amazing change you might want to consider when making this dish. :-) Thanks for the great recipe!

Even using more flour than the recipe called for, the sauce didn't thicken to my satisfaction.  I did add some whipping cream, black pepper, red pepper flake & organic salt free seasoning for some extra flavor...I will be making this again.  Don't be afraid to adjust, it's a fairly forgiving recipe...just not very thick & creamy.  I will give this more stars when I can get it thicker and as zesty as I'd like...I'll also add my any alterations I make.

This was very "comfort food" good.  For those who are adding "a little zip" via various ingredients, what you're looking for is a flavor enhancer.  Most added ingredients mentioned contained MSG.  I used Johnny's Seasoning.  It works like a charm and brings the flavor to a different level.  I think added salt would do the same thing to some degree if you can't eat MSG.  I also sauted  sliced  fresh mushrooms slowly in butter to a light golden brown to maximize flavor and added to the cooked onions. Followed the recipe from there.  I did increase the flour to 1 TBS instead of 1 tsp.  I'll be making  this again Friday night.

We love this paprikash recipe, including our 3 yr old. We chop the chicken into bite sized chunks and to give it a bit more Hungarian flavour we dice a hot yellow banana pepper and toss it in with the chicken while it cooks.

I made changes that were suggested by other reviewers - added garlic & mushrooms. Added 1/4 cup of white wine, and just 1 1/2 cups broth. Otherwise, made as recipe says. It was way too much paprika. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll cut it in half. Served over egg noodles. Just enough sauce, but just too spicey (spice, not hot) for us.

I have been making this recipe for quite awhile now, and my family always liked it.  The last time I made it, I added a couple of dashes of garlic powder and the result was outstanding.  I also bought new paprika, which probably also contributed to the improved taste.  Paprika tends to be one of those spices that last forever and I'm sure it must lose its flavor after awhile.  I also added more flour because I like the sauce a little thicker.

One of my brother's favorite meals. I served it with Pierogie Casserole and sauteed green beans, yummy! Thank you Deme for sharing your recipe. Next time I may add a bit more paprika to boost the color even more and a couple more chicken thighs (seasoning them first before browning them), but overall great as written.

The ONLY problem with this recipe was to much chicken stock, which watered down the flavor and made it bland.. I will cook this again but will add less chicken stock or more paprika, salt, onions and flour..

This was good.  I hoped it would have a little more flavor than another recipe I had for Chicken Paprika, but it was pretty much the same.  I would make again.  Try to use Hungarian Sweet Paprika as it gives it a better flavor.

This dish was very simple but I thought it was pretty bland. Before I maed it I read through alot of the reviews for some very useful tips! I only used 1/2 the chicken broth, I added some red pepper seeds, a fair amount of cajun seasoning, and a little parmesan cheese. My husband and I loved it! I will be making this dish again, next time I think I will used linguini pasta instead!

I followed Sharon C's suggestions.  I don't usually review recipes, but I love this one and I make it very frequently.  The only other suggestion I have would be to use shallots instead of onions (I've tried both) and shallots give it an even better flavor.

To make this recipe 5 stars start by dredging the chicken (I use a whole cut up chicken) in a flour, paprika, salt, and pepper mixture.  Saute one large chopped onion in 2 sticks of butter until translucent.  Remove onions from pan and set aside. Cook the chicken thoroughly in the butter, then remove from pan.  Throw the onions and sour cream back in the pan and stir together, (add more salt and paprika for flavor if necessary) and thin with either white wine, milk or chicken broth.  Place the chicken back in the sauce, heat, then serve over noodles or mashed potatoes.  Yummy!

I think I messed this one up.  I added too much lemon juice to the chicken.  The sauce was very good though..and tasted even better the next day.  I had added Marsala wine to sauce, gave it a nice flavor.  If you chooses to add lemon juice, use only a little!

A good recipe but somewhat lacking a little something extra.  It is very similar to a chicken goulash.  I topped mine with fresh spring onions and tomatoes and that was a nice touch.

I admit I had to cheat some.  I used what I had in the house.  I used beef broth instead of chicken and dried onion flakes instead of regular onions.  Still turned out great.  Next time we will serve over white rice because the sauce was soooooo good.  Thanks

Delicious! I echo the other reviewer who said to use Hungarian paprika. It's essential to the flavor.

This recipe was terrible. I had such high hopes for it because it sounded similar to a dish I had in Italy this year that I loved and I was excited to try it. There were so many problems: The sauce did not thicken, it was very bland, the taste of paprika was much too dominant, it was bitter, and it wasn't appealing to the eye (it looked like can dog food).

As others have stated it was quite runny.  I would half the chicken broth to fix the problem.  The taste was kind of like a plain stroganof.

I love this dish, but next time I make it I will definately temper the sour cream because it kind of curdled from the heat -- still ate it, and still delicious!

This was surprisingly good!  I grilled the chicken on the Griddler with a little seasoning then added it to the broth mixture.  I also added garlic and pepper to the broth.  Instead of flour I used cornstarch - I had no issues with the sauce thickening!  Definitely a keeper.

Ok this recipe called for far too much paprika.  My sauce kind of sorta thickened (even with the flour as specified).  But even with my addition of 2 cloves of garlic chopped, it was kind of bland, tasted too powdery (too much paprika.  I called a friend of mine cause she makes this sort of dish all the time and she told me her recipe, which I had done before but couldn't find it. This one sounded the most closest, but I was wrong.  Her recipe uses only 1 tsp paprika (not 2 tbsp), 3 tbsp sour cream.  But getting back to this recipe.  It has potential, try using less paprika, and yes use only 1 cup of stock, or less even.  Good luck.  Sorry I won't be using this recipe again.

This was a nice change from the ordinary & easy to make.  I agree with the other reviews that said that the sauce wouldn't thicken. I ended up using 4 teaspoons of corn starch (not flour as the recipe called for) to get it to the correct consistency. I also added about 1 1/2 teaspoons of minced garlic to the onions while they were cooking. Over all good flavor.  I will make this again!

The same as what many others said...pretty good flavor (I "spiced it up" a bit) but more runny than I'd expected. I'd make again for us but wouldn't suggest making for company.

So simple, tasty and comforting. Sort of like an alternative beef stroganoff. A great way to use a lot of sour cream that's about to go bad.

This tasted really good.  Only issue was that it didn't thicken.  Nonetheless I am looking forward to leftovers tonight!  One thing I did do was keep the juices from the chicken in the recipe and reduced the broth to 1.5 cups.  Also added a red bell pepper and hot pepper flakes for spice (didn't have any cayenne on hand).  Thanks for the recipe!

Not what I expected.  I think the recipe calls for too much paprika.  It seemed like I was eating a giant plate of paprika.  If I make this again, I think I will use less paprika and a coupledifferent spices.  Maybe more sour cream, to increase the creaminess.

This was a very easy, one-skillet recipe! My family does not like onions, so I substituted minced ones instead for the flavor. I also just added dollops of sourcream until it seemed the right consistancy. Served it with salad and a crusty bread. All in all, very good and even my picky 7 and 4 yr. olds ate it up!

I thought this was great. Very simple to make. I did add more paprkia and onions (just my prefrence), and it was a huge hit!!!
