I made these pancakes this morning (7/14/19 4:25 AM EST), and they slightly exceeded my expectations; they turned out quite well for a vegan dish. I didn't have one and a half cups of all-purpose flour handy, so I used the remaining half cup that I had left in addition to one cup of rice flour. They aren't very sweet when eaten plain, but does taste better topped with maple syrup.
