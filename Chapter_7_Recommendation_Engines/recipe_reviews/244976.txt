Yum yum! Served this along with some steaks. I added a few carrots i had to use along with an onion quartered and 4 cloves of garlic smashed. The flavors of this dish were delish! I did need to add salt though so sprinkled some sea salt over top after cooking and some fresh Chives.

I liked this recipe. The only addition I did was salt and pepper. Without both, I think these potatoes would be bland. I did a substitution for the chervil as I did not have it. I had parsley. I would say that in the case you need to use parsley, use half the amount called for. Chervil is a bit similar to parsley just a lot milder milder and with narrower leafs.

Delicious! I used red potatoes diced small. Also threw in some sliced baby carrots,and fresh chopped onion and garlic along with the dried ingredients. The dill weed really gives this dish that extra something. I used a little more than called for. Sprinkle with Kosher salt to really enhance the flavor. Will definitely be making these again!

Simple and delicious! The only thing missing for us was a nice sprinkling of sea salt. I love that this recipe uses dried herbs b/c I always have them on hand. I will be making these again, for sure~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)
