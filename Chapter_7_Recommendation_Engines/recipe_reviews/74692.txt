I LOVE this salsa!!  It's one of my go-to meals actually. I always use a can of corn and I also throw in a can of black beans (both drained and rinsed). I only ever use half a red onion cause I presonally think that the onion taste is WAY too strong otherwise. I let the whole mixture (minus the avocado - since it would brown) marinate for a few hours.  When ready to eat, I throw in the avocado (just one) and serve with either Tostitos Lime chips or Black Bean Chips.  SO DELICIOUS!  I think its a perfect dinner for two.  ENJOY!

Very, VERY good! Okay, so I normally think of this kind of stuff as "foo-foo" gourmet and don't even consider making it. BUT, since I was hosting a Fish Taco dinner party, I figured I needed to impress, I went for it. I made about 1-1/2 times the recipe, as I wanted to serve it both with chips as an appetizer and with the Fish Tacos (recipe from this site). I let it sit in the fridge for a few hours to mingle flavors and I think that was a good idea--I wouldn't serve this right off of the chopping board. Anyway, I had to fill up the appetizer bowl about 4 times, and the regular 'ol tomato salsa from the jar barely even got touched. It tasted even better on the tacos. My husand ate about 1/3 cup just as a "taster" before anyone even came over. So, huge success, and I will make this again :-) OH! Do wear gloves when handling the jalapenos, my fingers burned for several hours after making this.

A variation of this is always a favorite when I bring it in to work, and it isn't unusual for me to be stopped and asked WHEN I'll bring in more.  I use 4-3-2-1: 4 ears fresh white corn, 3 avocados (not too ripe), 2 medium tomatos, 1 white onion.  Cilantro and Lime Juice to taste.  cut kernels off ears, cook in a frying pan w/ tablespoon of olive oil until it starts to carmelize.  Meanwhile dice other ingredients into bowl.  Pour corn into bowl and mix. Add a qtr cup water to frying pan, scrape and reduce leavings until consistency of a thin sauce, pour over bowl, mix.  Add lime juice & minced cilantro.  chill.  Adding the reduced sauce from the frying pan is important, it adds a lot of extra flavor.  I am a pepperhead and enjoy extremely spicy food, but I keep this mild and simple so everyone can enjoy it.

Mmmmm.... I used one can of corn and black beans each, drained; the full amount of cumin and then some; a touch of smoked paprika; and one diced jalapeno instead of the crushed red pepper. Oh...and I kept the pits in the container to keep the avocado from turning colour.  A keeper!  Thanks!

This is one of my go-to dishes, especially for parties.  I always receive compliments and never have left-overs!  Like other reviews have suggested, I also add in a can of black beans.  Quick tip: soap and water won't take the residue from the jalapenos off your hands, but olive oil will.  Just rub some on your hands, then wash and dry.  Voila!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  It was great.  I made it the night before then added the avacado right before serving.  We served it on the side with grilled fish at a cook off and won first place.  More people asked us for this recipe than the grilled fish. I am making it again this weekend for another bar-b-que to serve with a grilled jalapeno stuffed chicken recipe from this web site.  Enjoy!

Everyone loved the salsa at my Spanish party, I made it the day before (without the avacado) and let it marinade over night. Put in the avacado right before everyone showed up.

I did not care for this recipe. I found the vinegar to be overpowering, the cumin too strong, and thought the flavors just did not go together.

I made this for a tex-mex dinner party and it was delicious.  Only had 1 avocado so added 2 small diced tomatoes, and also added a can of black beans.  Didn't have fresh oregano so just used a sprinkle of dried oregano.  Also used frozen corn as didn't have fresh.  Really enjoyed this dish, thanks!

I love this receipe.  It is always a big hit at any party.  I add a can of black beans and use a can of corn rather then fresh and it is still awesome.  It is the right combination of ingredients.  My son loves it who doesn't normally eat onions and avocadoes.  It is a great recipe to get your kids to eat their vegtables.

Ok, so this recipe cries out for fresh cilantro instead of oregano. I make this all the time - is great with chips, in tacos or as a side dish. I often just use canned corn for speed and convenience. Good stuff. Thanks!

This is wonderful! I made it for a BBQ and brought it for my boyfriend's family. Everyone loved it and not a bit was left. I added a few small tomatoes for some pretty color and extra yumminess, but I followed everything else the exact same. I will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Excellent!  My husband ate if for 3 days straight.  This has become a go-to recipe for an easy dish during football weekends and parties.  It's so easy to make, particularly when using canned corn, and is so popular that it's hard to pass it over.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a cool, light appetizer.  It carries a bit of a kick so if that's not your thing, cut back on the red pepper a bit.

I made this for an appetizer for a dinner with friends and everyone loved it. I made a few changes, though... I used a can of corn instead of fresh and added 1 can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of black bean, drained and rinsed. I left out the red bell pepper and the red pepper flakes because I didn't have them on hand. I also used a yellow onion instead of red because that's what I had. I used less (about half)cilantro because I didn't want it to be too strong. I could taste it but it wasn't overpowering. I mixed everything but the avocado together and put it in the fridge for an hour or two while I prepared the rest of the dinner. Just before serving, I added the avocado. YUM!!

My avocados were too ripe so the consistency was a little more like guacamole than salsa but it was a huge hit and fun to make!  I tripled the recipe and there were no leftovers!

Absolutely a hit at our house!  Instead of red pepper flakes I either use Chipotle or Adobo chili powder (it creates a great smoky flavor with a kick), and I used a mix of red, orange & yellow peppers....it's even better the next few days (if it lasts that long)!

Great, unexpected dish for a summer barbeque.  Jumped from four stars to five when I omitted cumin, doubled the cilantro, and used one large avocado instead of two.  Make sure to prepare and add the avocado just before serving to prevent browning.

this has become a staple and is always a hit. i make a couple changes: most importantly, a jalapeno or two instead of red pepper flakes. the fresh jalapeno taste is amazing. also, i only put in 1/2 red onion, use 4 ears of corn, 1 tablespoon of red wine vinegar. so yummy!

I've made this 3 or 4 times. I love it! I like to grill about 4 ears instead of boiling 3. And 4 red onions are way to many, 2 are plenty. Enjoy??

This recipe is SO AMAZING! I am a HUGE avocado fan, so this was perfect.

I actually made this for our company's annual salsa contest and won! Definitely a huge favorite at work and everyone asked for the recipe.

The only note I would make is it could use some heat, which can obviously be added to taste. But, without heat it's still amazing!

i used frozen corn, only one avocado, and replaced the crushed red pepper with a diced jalapeno. i also added a can of black beans. it was good but i think could use some more spices. it was still a hit at the football party though. i will make again, but will play around with the seasoning.

This recipe is absolutely delicious !!!!!!  For those who are sensitive to spice, I would put little to no pepper flakes!   As well, I put a little less red wine vinegar to not overpower the natural flavours in the avocado and corn.

Wow, this was spicy!! Even my husband who LOVES spicy things thought that it was a little too much. Next time I make it I will cut down a bit on the crushed red pepper and that should help. We did like it for the most part though, thanks for the recipe, Cari!

Awesome the way it is!  I did try with drained black beans which was excellent and usually cheat on the corn and do canned.  I back off the onion just a tad but that's just personal preference.  Try with some green onion too if you feel so inclined.  Serve with chips or this is really an excellent side with grilled fish.  THX CARI!  :)

This was Awesome!!!  Someone referred to it as Cowboy Caviar, and I thought that it was fitting.  I did make a few adjustments based on what I had on hand.  1. 1/2 of a Red Onion was enough for my taste.  2. I added 1 Red and 1 Yellow bell pepper.  3. I roasted the corn on the grill first.  4. Added 3 Large tomatoes and 3 Avocados and the juice of one lime.  5. Increased the Crushed red pepper, cumin and cilantro by 1 & 1/2 times....  It makes a larger quantity and was delicious.  I went home with an empty bowl!

Love this!  Not only is it good as a salsa, but I also will add a can of black beans (rinsed and drained) and put it in a whole wheat tortilla for lunch!  Awesome, and it's even better the longer it sits.

Very good salsa. I made exactly as the recipe stated - next time I think I will add some black beans with jalepenos. The recipe servings is 4 - but really it makes alot. I doubled it because I was expecting 12 -  a single batch served with tortilla chips would have been just fine..had too much left over. Remember to cube the avocados as the recipe states...I was in mincing mode and mine were not big enough. Hopefully next time mine will look more like the picture.

Excellent! I  tooki it a little easy on the cumin (used about half as much) and the onion (I'm a raw onion hater, but I conceed to a few for MrB), but otherwise made as directed. Loved the lightness of the oil and vinegar with the lime. We had this with tortilla chips, but both of us found ourselfs eating it with a spoon.  MrB is adding black beans to the leftovers tomorrow to roll in tortillas for lunch. Great recipe - thanks!

Make sure to add alot of the other vegetables besides corn to balance out its flavor. Think two avocados two bell peppers and 1/4 cup cilantro.

The corn salsa was really great in that it tasted as good as it was easy to make. I didn't have any red wine vinegar on me or red onions (i used yellow), but that didn't seem to have an adverse effect. It still tasted really good. One thing i'd change for the future would be to cut down on the cumin. I added just a pinch less than a tbspoon but it still tasted very Mexican-ish(which gave it that extra punch). overall--great!

I make this every holiday season, I love it and my friends always ask for it. One tip that will make this so much easier for you: Trader Joe's Roasted Corn, in the frozen section. So much faster! I usually put in only 1/2 an onion, reduce the vinegar to 1 tbsp of red wine and 1 tbsp of balsamic, and add cumin until I can taste it. Love this recipe!

This has quickly become a favorite recipe for us. We use it as a dip, as a taco filling (on its own or with meat or fish), as a side or even as a main (with the addition of some black beans).

For the corn, I've used grilled corn on the cob as well as frozen corn. For the latter, I'll often cook it in a little water in a skillet then let the water boil off and the corn blacken a bit.

I goofed, so review not total reflection: failed to read directions before putting together so had uncooked corn (have another recipe that way) - but still came out good.  Used slightly less than tsp of red pepper flakes and slightly less than full red onion. This onion must've been strong because it was a bit too oniony. Avocados were a bit too soft so turned a bit mushy.  Overall good flavor and will make again. Next time will downplay the onion (unless exceptionally mild one), cook the corn (would be good BBQ'd!) and make sure firm avocados.

Did not measure ingredients but I followed basic recipe.  I did use canned corn because no fresh corn available.  Served as a side to baked cod with some cajun seasoning on it.  Very good.

This was tasty, although I had to make some changes out of necessity: my avocado was unusable, so that was out; instead I used a peeled and seeded chopped tomato, and I used roasted red pepper and then a green bell pepper.  It tasted pretty good, although I would have loved to taste the avocado.  Next time....

This was ok.  I only used 2 ears of corn because that's all I had - should have used 3. I used 1 avocado, because I thought that was more than enough....I also reduced the amount of cumin, cilantro, red pepper flakes, red pepper and onion.  The end result tasted very much like red wine vinegar - I would certainly reduce the amount, maybe even omit it if I were to make this again.

This had WAY too much acid for my taste, otherwise I really liked it. I will just cut back quite a bit on the red wine vinegar next time and  maybe the lime juice. I added black beans and will add a 3rd avocado next time so there is a better ratio of avocado for the amount of other ingredients.

Would not use vinegar next time. I happened to have a mango in the refrigerator so I chopped it up and added it to my recipe. Really yummy!

Fabulous!  I made this as a Thanksgiving appetizer and it was a huge hit.  As other reviewers suggested, I cut the red wine vinegar to 1/4 cup and used 1/2 of a (regular) onion.  I used 1 16 oz bag of frozen corn.  Fresh cilantro is essential.  My family does not like spicy food, so I completely omitted the salt, black pepper, and red pepper flakes, and it was still great!

The only flavor this recipe has is that of vinegar and lime juice, it was so overwhelming I could not taste any of the other ingredients.

Fantastic! A lovely salsa recipe that I could use my summer abundance of corn, tomatoes and cilantro =) I made the recipe with the suggestions made by Paul Hoffman and the flavors were spot on, light & fresh, just perfect =) I will definitely make this salsa recipe my go-to from now on.

All you can taste is the cumin.... And I only added 1/2. After tasting it I added more ingredients, an additional Avavado, more cilantro, more garlic, more lime. Still over-powering amount of cumin. Very disappointing. Won't make it again.

This was very good.  I was a little worried about the vinegar but it really added a nice flavor so don't leave it out.  The only change I made was not to use near as much onion as it called for.  I served this with chicken tacos.

I added feta but left out the red onion and instead sautéed sweet onion (we don't like raw) and shrimp separately in olive oil and garlic and ate it all on a bed of lettuce - wonderful!!

Made this the other day to snack on. I used canned Mexican corn, and followed the rest of the recipe. I thought the vinegar and line juice was a bit much at first, but after a few hours/next day it was perfect. I will be making this again!

I will definitely make this again.  I did add a can of black beans, and used canned corn.  I did not have pepper flakes, so I added a dash or 2 of cayenne pepper.

A great salsa recipe as it is written. If you don't like it, don't make it. We are having this a second time as is and enjoy it. Thanks for it. I do sub frozen corn for the fresh and that is it.

This is an excellent salsa.  Took it to a church picnic and it was eaten up !  Got many requests for the recipe.  I cut the onion amount in half (looked like too much at the time) but it would have been fine with it.  Will make again !

This recipe is a keeper. We initially ate it with tortilla chips but I ended up just adding a bit to my salads and it really added an extra bite to an ordinary salad.

The red wine vinegar overpowers the sweet, natural corn taste and makes it all vinegary. This recipe is fine without the vinegar, although honestly I am not a fan of cumin or oregano in a veggie mix like this either. I'd rather let the natural, strong flavors of sweet corn, red bell pepper, and red onion carry the dish. Another thing to note:  the liquids made the avocado smooshy and that particular taste got completely lost with the vinegar.

I would cut the amount of cumin in half.  Otherwise, this salsa has a nice crispness & bright color with the corn.

I loved it!  Okay...so I made a few changes.  Here's what I did, but it came out great.  I used one can or corn, drained instead of fresh corn. I omitted the red pepper (I had none at the time).  I added one can of beans, drained & rinsed.  I used kidney beans because I had no black beans.  I added one jalapeno pepper, finely minced...because we love picante in my family.  I omitted the crush red pepper flakes...preferring the fresh jalapeno oer the dried red pepper.  I substituted fresh cilantro for the fresh oreano.  Itw as a hit!

I love the idea of this recipe but it was inedible. it might be better if there were different seasoning and definately less vinegar and or lime juice. i love sour food but this was way too tart.

This is great! Everyone loved it. I will make again. I didnt have red wine vinegar so I made it with white vinegar and it was great.
