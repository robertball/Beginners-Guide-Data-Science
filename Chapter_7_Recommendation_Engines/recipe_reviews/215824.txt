Oh wow, this definitely is one of the "Ultimate Chocolate Chip Cookies"! These cookies are chocolatey, chewy on this inside and crispy on the outside - just perfect! The only thing I did differently was to use half white sugar and half brown sugar. I love the combination of chocolate and pecans! I  always line my baking sheet with parchment paper to ensure a good baking experience. Be sure to have a tall glass of ice cold milk handy as you're gonna want to eat a bunch of these warm from the oven!

I LOVE this recipe - have fine-tuned just a little - substitute real butter for butter flavored Crisco, increase the flour to 2 1/4 cups (need more flour when using real butter), and use Girardelli Milk Chocolate Chips - BEST chocolate chip cookie recipe EVER!!!

These are hands down the best way to make a choc chip cookie. I do split the sugar.  3/4 C brown and 3/4 cup White but other than that, PERFECT!!!!!!    Crisco makes a better cookie than butter.

This is a great recipe, but we did substitute the Crisco for Real Butter as we do not use hydrogenated oils.  You can also substitute 1/2 portion lard and 1/2 portion butter in place of the Crisco for amazing results.  You get the light flakiness and the butter flavor along with a bunch of Vitamin A & D.

These are the best chocolate chip cookies. You can also use other types of nuts and different flavored  chips to change it up. I made these but didn't have butter flavored Crisco, so I substituted 1/4c butter and 1/2c regular Crisco and they turned out just fine.

Excellent. ****NOTES: do not over bake! Also a stick of criso is one cup. So 3/4 stick would be 3/4 cup out of a tub of crisco. The sticks are too expensive for me. Also, you must use butter flavored crisco, not regular. For an extra kick, add about 1/8 cup of molasses to the creamed mixture. FAB!

Even though I think there should be an alternate to the 3/4 stick of CRISCOÂ® Butter All-Vegetable Shortening Sticks, the recipe is great and tastes fabulous! I love the how it's gooey on the inside and crunchy on the outside! It tastes sensational with a glass of cold milk! I absolutely love this recipe and I have never added a substitute for it! :)

Good for a quick cookie using on hand pantry ingredients. Because I'm low on brown sugar, I used half white/half brown. I also used almost all organic ingredients. I prefer using a mixture of milk chocolate, semi-sweet and extra dark chocolate chips. 350* for eight minutes was just right for me. NOTE: This makes a for a good ice cream/frozen whipped topping cookie sandwich.

Use butter!  These cookies look beautiful and have great texture but are lacking in the rich chocolate and vanilla flavor that you expect in a great chocolate chip cookie.  They have a shortening aftertaste that lingers.  The Hersheys and Toll House recipes on the chocolate chip packages are much better.

Made these with GF flour mix and subbed 1/2 c honey for brown sugar and they still turned out puffy, beautiful, and delicious. Great recipe!

No question the BEST chocolate chip cookie I've ever tasted. The only change I made is to use two different kinds of chocolate chips -- half milk chocolate and half semisweet. All milk chocolate is too sweet, and all semisweet isn't sweet enough, but combined, the flavors of the two chocolates balance each other out very nicely.

The easiest way to sum this up is this. My husband took one bite and said, "Um, honey, have you tasted these cookies yet?" Then made an icky face. Unlike many, I made these exactly as specified. Unless you like your cookies to taste like wax, don't bother. I read many of the 'five star' reviews and almost all of them made a change, the most common is subbing butter for the Crisco. Of course they taste good then! ;)  I keep butter flavor crisco onhand as I make all my pie crusts with it. It makes awesome pie crust but really leaves something to be desired in a cookie. These get one star for the chocolate chips.

These cookies are light and crunchy, but the after taste screams "fake butter". None of us could take more than one bite--even the teenagers! The temperature is incorrect--mine were way overdone at 375*. 350* for 8 minutes is perfect. Stick to the Original Nestle Toll House recipe.

Sorry, I did not find these to be very "ultimate".  I made them exactly as written, though I doubled the batch and didn't opt for the nuts.  They still came out flat as a pancake (like all my other cookies... maybe it's me?) but since I decided to try it with all Crisco (though I had my doubts) they just tasted and felt greasy.  The more-baked ones were actually the better ones, though I like my cookies chewy.  I might try this again using butter and more flour as another reviewer suggested- I do like the idea of the milk and extra vanilla.

These cookies are SUPER good! Made with Geri-deli chips and took some other reviewers advice and did half brown sugar half white sugar. My suggestion is leave as is and use all brown sugar.

Sadly, we didn't care for these. They baked up flatter than I like & the flavor just didn't impress. They were very greasy:(

Great taste, but a bit thin. These were highly temperamental. I overcooked the first batch even at 8 min. Then I took the temp down to 350. Then watched them like a hawk, checking every minute after 5 and they were done in 9 (so I was able to test the flavor and chewiness with one good batch). The next ones overcooked at 7 min with the oven down to 325. Too much hassle, they aren't THAT good. I have a better chocolate chip recipe.

Like many people, I've tried several chocolate chip cookie recipes over the years.  In my opinion, these are THE BEST!  The butter-flavored Crisco does make the difference and I wouldn't change a thing.

Not the best cookies I have had. They had a strange taste to them that I still can't identify. Still on my quest to find the perfect chocolate chip cookie.

I omitted the nuts and used mini morsel chocolate chips, 2 cups. I made large cookies and it made 1 1/2 dozen cookies, but mine were LARGE. I baked the big ones 15 minutes and they were perfectly chewy. I would make these over and over again. 

Such an easy delicious recipe. :)

Almost a 5 star, other than it is much better with 3/4 cup white and 3/4 cup brown sugar. I also used mini chocolate chips and they were awesome! Family said I was done looking for a great chocolate chip cookie recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly and these were very bitter and salty. I only cooked part of the batch. The rest is in the refrigerator. I'm trying to look for a way that I can salvage the rest of the dough. I may add some white sugar or peanut butter. I'd hate to throw the rest of the dough away since I bought the Crisco sticks especially for this..

I'm sorry to all the people that liked this recipe, but I did not care for this chocolate chip recipe. They have a funny bitter taste that can only come from the crisco I think. There are much better recipes out there.....keep on looking!

I wish I could give this ten stars! This is the best cookie recipe ever! I just made these, and they're so delicious! I was a bit confused with one teaspoon of salt, but it worked perfectly! My new favorite recipe for chocolate cookies!

I was very disappointed with these cookies. They were bland and almost tasteless. I baked them for exactly 10 minutes, and they came out hard and crunchy. Then I baked them for 8 minutes and although they were softer they were still tasteless. I have a chocolate chip cookie recipe that people love, and I will stick to that one.

I did not care for these at all. They have a very bland artificial taste. They remind me of store bought cookies not homemade.

YIKES!  I thought I would give these a whirl, as many swear by baking with Crisco. The texture was decent, but the flavor was not. Not good at all I am afraid. There was this weird lingering  after taste as well. Also, there is no way this makes 36, unless they are the size of a quarter.  I will go back to my tried and true (which is an altered version of the Toll House recipe on the bag! : 1&1/4 c. brown sugar, 1/4 cup gran. sugar creamed with 2 sticks soft unsalted butter. Add in 1 tsp vanilla and one whole egg and one egg yolk. 2&1/4 cups bread flour, 1tsp baking soda, 1 tsp salt, 1 -12 oz. bag of semi sweet choc chips. Always use real butter ladies and gentlemen. Save the crisco for a squeaky hinge.

I'm giving this four stars for the original recipe. (I omit the nuts. Too expensive.) As far as I'm concerned, this is THE chocolate chip cookie recipe, the gold standard, although chocolate chip is only my second-favorite cookie. (My #1 favorite is oatmeal-raisin). To make it, IMHO, a five-star recipe, I made one "major" change. Instead of using all semisweet chocolate chips, I use half milk chocolate chips and half semisweet because to me, all milk chocolate is too sweet, and all semisweet isn't sweet enough, so the two sweetnesses balance each other out nicely.

This is a very good recipe. I did substitute a few things though. I used unsalted butter, all purpose flour and walnuts. The whole family loved these!

Thank You.

I'm sorry, but I did not like these cookies. I made them as written in the recipe, without making any changes. I like recipes I've made in the past that use butter as well as a mix of white/brown sugar. Anna's chocolate chip cookies (on the allrecipes website) are my favorite!

These were ok. Made exactly as written. The all shortening makes them definitely hold their shape and not get flat, but the taste is missing the butter. Also, we all know we are not to eat raw dough, but I love it and I could not eat this dough. It was very gritty and airy tasting. Can't describe it. But I'll be looking for a different recipe.

I followed the recipe EXACTLY.  I had no problems with them being thin, bitter, salty, or with the thickness of the dough.  They were perfect, and looked just like the ones on the Crisco packaging!  I've uploaded a photo.

I made these last weeked for myself, my boyfriend and coworkers. I did them two ways. One batch with peanut butter chips, chocolate chips and chocalte chunks. Next batch walnuts, chocolate chips and chunks. EXCELLENT! I baked them for about 10 mins per cookie sheet and they came out a nice coloring and soft. Next time I will take a pic. Only modification was to do half white and half brown for the sugar. Wasn't too sweet; just right. People at work ate them up and boyfriend got mad I brought some into work. LOL! I make big cookies so I got about 16 out of each batch. :) Thank you Crisco for a wonderful recipe.

I used about 1/4 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of shortening.  I also used half brown sugar and half white sugar.  I loved the addition of nuts, I used walnuts.  Not much different then my regular chocolate chip cookie recipe.  A little more rounded due to the crisco.

I've been baking cookies for 40 years. This is by far the best chocolate chip cookie ever. I used regular Crisco because I couldn't find the flavored one and they were still great. I used a cup of pecan pieces as well. The biggest problem is they were gone the same day!

I made these using butter and a gluten free flour mix (3/4c chickpea flour and 1/2c each of tapioca and brown rice flour) and they came out delicious! I baked them in the 13x9 pan for 18 minutes (would try 16-17 next time) but even though they are a little dark, they are still great.

Using the butter flavored Crisco makes all the difference in these cookies. They have a crunchy edge and a tender, gooey center. SUPERB! Like others have stated, make sure you have plenty of milk. Ours only made 2.5 dozen using a medium cookie scoop.

Son and niece liked the cookies.  My husband said there's an aftertaste.  I could taste it too; like a grease flavor.  I won't make these again.  The oil/grease flavor is just a turn off.  I'm still searching for the best chocolate chip cookie recipe for my family.

Good but I made a few changes for my first try. Such as adding real butter and white sugar like other reviewers suggested. So I'm not sure how they would taste with the original recipe. Also my cookies come out really flat. They taste great though, so I'm ok with that. Maybe I mixed the butter too long and that is why they came out flat. Definitely  will be making these over and over again.

These are very good, however, I still like my recipe from Cooks.com ...Best Chocolate Chip Cookies, that uses instant pudding in the mix.  The cookies are never flat.  They retain the "puffy" look.

Don't know what people's problem is but these are awesome! Those with anything other than 4/5 star rating don't know what a great chocolate chip cookies should be.

Oven was too hot and at 7 minutes in my oven they burnt. Thy was too much brown sugar. Do not use this recipe, the five star ratings for tis cookie are by people who like burnt cookies. Do NOT waste your time with these cookies!

While these were good, I would not call them the 'ultimate'. Possibly due due to using shortening (most cookies I have made use butter)!  Anyway, left out the nuts due to family's preference and also made the bar variation noted below.  Hubby and three boys were pleased!

I don't write reviews often but my husband said I MUST write one for this recipe.  He's a 'sweetaholic' and he said these are the best cookies I've ever made!  The only thing I did different than the recipe is to add some real butter.  I doubled the recipe so instead of using 1 and 1/2 cup butter flavored crisco, I used 1 cup of crisco and 1/2 cup butter.

This cookie is yummy ... made exact recipe, but instead of nuts added dried cranberries.  Drizzled with white chocolate and sprinkled with finely chopped walnuts.

I have been making these cookies for about 13 years, they are always a hit! You don't want to over bake them, but this isn't so hard if you set a timer. I like to crush the pecans into a fine "dust" and then add them. Then the cookies taste nuttier. :) Happy baking!

This was a good cookie - but I like the recipe on the back of the chocolate chip bag better.  Also, I use the milk chocolate chips and use walnuts, not pecans.  And, as much as I love CC cookies, for Christmas i like to do special recipes that I don't make very often, makes it a little more festive and meaningful.

These really are fantastic, but if you use the 3/4 stick of butter and increase the flour like S. Johnson recommends, be prepared for a very thick dough.  I shaped by hand and had to work the chocolate chips in.  I made some with walnuts and others with Reese's peanut butter chips in addition to the chocolate chips.

Seriously, these are the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever baked!  The only change that I made is I omitted the nuts and I used one cup of milk chocolate chips and one cup of semi-sweetened chocolate chips.  Delicious!!!

This reminds me of the old Toll House Recipe cookies! I know they have a recipe on the back of their chocolate chips, but it seems somehow things changed through the years, and they just don't taste like I made them as a kid.  THESE are WONDERFUL!  Only thing I changed was because of the price of brown sugar, I subbed half white.  And used butter flavored Crisco sticks.  Thanks for sharing!

I've been making this recipe for years with the original Crisco stick and everyone loves them.  I add a little extra flour (not quite a whole cup total)to it so the cookies stay higher and about the size of a half dollar like my Grandma's.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I have ever tried!  The edges are slightly crisp and the centers are always chewy.  Best part is, the cookies stay moist over a number of days!  I always add about half a cup to a cup of walnuts and it adds a delicious twist.  I made some adjustments to the recipe: I use only about 3/4 the amount of salt (because it can get too salty) and I add only about one to one and a half teaspoons of vanilla instead of the full tablespoon.  I just don't think that you need that much vanilla.  Hope this helps!

I have been using this recipe for years, I believe it was on a Crisco box back in the 1990's and it's the best. I try others, but not as good as this one. Everyone loves these.

I would give this recipe more than five stars if I could. I have been baking these cookies for years as the recipe was handed down to me by my great grandmother. These cookies are perfect just the way the recipe is written. Nothing needs to be changed. Especially the brown sugar and the Crisco. Almost everyone who tries these cookies asks for the recipe and tells me that I make the best chocolate chip cookies ever and it's all due to this recipe.

Absolutely the best!  They keep their shape much better than cookies made with real butter (the dough doesn't spread out so thin), yet taste buttery.  Wonderful exactly as the recipe is written, but also great with a mix of milk chocolate chips and the semi-sweet chips.  I sometimes add another quarter cup of the chopped pecans.

Is there something else besides Crisco that can be substituted?  Crisco is not a food item. http://www.motherlindas.com/crisco.htm  
Would lard work?

I've been using this recipe since my middle child was a baby, and he turns 20 next year! It's the ONLY chocolate chip recipe I've used as it just turns out the best! We use all kinds of different chips though, and it worked great with some mint chocolate chips and some dark chocolate chips I found last year!  

Using the Crisco gives the cookie a much better flavor and holds it together much better than regular butter does, but since it is butter flavored, you still have that buttery flavor that makes cookies so good!

Oh, and we don't use nuts in ours as none of us like them with nuts, but I did make them years ago with slivers of almonds for a friend and she LOVED them.

These are the classic chocolate chip cookie - crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside.  I rarely use my mixer, since I have a cookie paddle, so I stirred this up by hand.  They mixed up great.  Great recipe!

I think you need more flour. I used butter instead of shortening. They taste really great and every loves them, but I have NEVER EVER been able to get them to look like the ones in the crisco picture =(

I have made these cookies many times over the years and I have to say that they are truly the best chocolate chip cookies I've eaten. Sometimes for variation I'll add a dash of nutmeg or some oatmeal but it doesn't matter, they always disappear very fast.

This is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe I've ever made.  Unless I know someone allergic, I always make it with the pecans.  I started making it about 10 years ago and it gets rave reviews.  I also make a white chocolate chip with macadamia nuts version which is equally fantastic.

This is absolutely my go-to recipe for chocolate chip cookies.  Several people offering ways to get around the butter flavored Crisco, but I wouldn't change it at all.  After all this is a recipe developed by Crisco.  In fact, I've had such good luck with this recipe that I am a fan of Crisco's other "Ultimate" recipes as well.

They turned out ....okay.   Not really the "ultimate" cookie, but I guess any cookie with chocolate chips and nuts are good.  I've been cooking/baking for 25 years and have my own "go to" recipes, but that that I'd try something new.  Out of all the years that I have been baking, this recipe has the weirdest measurements. The amounts look like they have been altered just to make it seem "special".   For example, I have never seen 3/4 tsp of baking soda. lol   Anyway...I followed it and they were fine. Nothing special, but hey...it's a cookie! Can't really screw up too badly ;)

Yes, only used 1/2 cup butter flavored Crisco and 3/4 cup stevia with 1/2 cup brown sugar. 
A little too sweet! Should probably have used 1/2 cup stevia.  My error so still rated them 5 stars.
