This was a little too salty for us - I am sure that was because of the dark soy sauce - next time I would use all low sodium soy sauce.  I also was not too sure about the red wine vinegar but it worked fine - I would have expected rice vinegar or Chinese black vinegar, but as written this was really very good - just a bit too salty for some, for those people I just offered a little chicken broth to dilute the sauce.

We lived in China for 5 years so my kids are picky with asian sauces.  I used all low sodium soy sauce based on what other reviewers said and I don't like things too salty. I didn't have chili oil so I used 1 tsp of Chili Garlic sauce instead. (even sriracha sauce would work) I added 2 TBS of brown sugar instead of white sugar.   And I added about 1 tablespoon of pure sesame oil which is what made the difference to make us all like it.  YUM!!!

I used white vinegar (all I had on hand), brown sugar, soy sauce, garlic, n chili oil. It was great! Did not realize how quick n easy it is. Will whisk it up often now that I know.

This is a great base recipe for dipping sauce. I use it as a starting point and add what I like from the fridge. My kids loved it.

I added a full teaspoon of white sugar and a tablespoon of brown sugar to balance it out. I also toasted some sesame seeds and added them. Turned out great!
