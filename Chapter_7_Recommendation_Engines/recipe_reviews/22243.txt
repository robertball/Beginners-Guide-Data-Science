I found this recipe origanally in a Taste of Home cookbook belonging to my mother. The taste of home version called for only 3 cups of quick cooking oats and called to be baked in a 10x15" baking pan. With this change the cookies come out soft and chewy. Please note that these cookies are REALLY sweet.

This has the potential to be great, but the recipe as it stands produces very dry, crumbly bars that are far too sweet. Most of them went in the garbage.

Half of this recipe fits nicely in a 8" square baking pan.  It's a bit labour intensive for squares, but the result is quite delicious.  Try it with other nuts if you don't like walnuts.  Thanks Janea!

Delicious!!!  Only thing I changed was to leave out the nuts for we don't like them.  At first I worried that the dough was too think, but it was perfect.  Some reviews have said the bars are too rich, thick, and sweet.  Of couse they are--look at the ingredients!!  They ARE rich and thick and DELICIOUS!!!!!  :)  I had to cut into a corner well before they were cool for the smell was just too good). Thanks for the recipe!!!!!!!!!!

We call these Fudge Jumbles in my house and love to make them all the time. We omit the nuts though as we don't like them. Still tastes great!

This cookie tasted good- but was too rich. I ended up disposing of part of cookies because no one could eat much. If I do make this again, I would either double oatmeal part of this recipe and use half chocolate mixture in each recipe or I would just use melted chocolate chips between oatmeal layers.

These are so delicious! I use a larger pan because it's easier to spread them. I love the fudge center. These are always a favorite at any event.

These "bars" are actually fudge sandwiched between sweet oatmeal cookies.  More of a candy.  WAY too sweet for anyone in our household.

I've made these bars probably six times a year for 10 years and they're always a hit.  I don't change the recipe much.  I use parchment paper in the pan, use fat-free sweetened condensed milk, add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the oatmeal mixture, toast the walnuts beforehand and use 2 different vanillas (Mexican vanilla in the chocolate mixture and Madagascar vanilla for the oatmeal mixture).  The chocolate mixture is easy to melt on a 50% setting in the microwave.  The hardest/most time consuming part of making the cookies is spreading the oatmeal mixture in the bottom of the pan.  For the top crust, I take some oatmeal dough and flatten it a bit in my hands, then lay it on top of the chocolate mixture. Thanks for the recipe!

super delicious! very moist and chocolatey! the whole family loved it! i used a wider pan around. 10 1/2 x 15 1/2. this way the chocolate mixture and the oats mixture will spread a bit thinner making the sweetness much acceptable for those who complained about the richness of the recipe. i baked it for 20 minutes, let it cool in the pan. slicing it wasn't difficult at all. just make sure that it is cool enough.that's the trick! :-) happy baking and enjoy eating!

Very good! I brought them into work and they were devoured! One of the comments were "They're like date squares... but with CHOCOLATE!" -said with excitement. I have also been asked for the recipe. The only thing I would do differently I think, is bake them in a bigger pan. They are rich and were thick. Next time I will use my 10" x 14"? 15" glass dish instead. Definitely going to make them for a bake sale this summer.

I just baked this recipe now. Very easy to bake. Very rich and cripy, the top layer adds all the crispiness :)
however, the chocolate layer is too heavy and sweet, I think if it was lighter it would have been just perfect :) i will definetly bake it again :)

This is the best !   Planned to take to work to share, but after a taste test, they're here at home with the baker. Tried to decrease sweetness as advised by other reviewers.  Wanted then thicker too.  Incr oatmeal to 4 C. Decr Eagle Milk to 1/4 C.  Added 3/4 C Bulgarian buttermilk (3.5% fat) so the extra oatmeal and smaller amount of Eagle Milk would not leave dough to dry. Changed the 2 cups of semisweet chips to 6 oz by weight Winco bulk dark chocolate (54% cacao) because it had less sugar on the nutritional info label.  Put about half the oatmeal dough in bottom of pan and other half in a solid layer on top of chocolate layer.  Glass 9" x 13" pan. 325 F.  Still too mushy in center after 25 min.  Laid aluminum foil over the top of pan. Lowered temp to 200 F  for another 15 min. Finally raised and dried in center. Took out of oven when internal temp in center was about 145-150 F.  Sank a little as it cooled.   Cut into 32 squares! Very filling. Perfect sweetness to my taste. Very chewy and moist after 3 days on counter top.   Thanks for great recipe. I'll make this again and share next time.

For the last couple years I've made this every time a friend has a baby.  It is a great late night snack.  Most of them say their hubbies eat more than their fair share and that they're gone too quickly!  It makes a ton and they are oh so good!  My husband loves it when a friend has a baby because it means he gets a few!  I just leave out the nuts because I don't like them.

These are delicious - a big hit here at home. I didn't have semi sweet chocolate chips only milk chocolate so that is what i used and I thought it might turn out to sweet but it did not. Its perfect. Too good cause you are tempted to eat more then one.

Great recipe. I would definitely recommend reducing the oats to 3 cups to keep it moist. I also made mine on a cookie sheet/jelly roll pan to make them thinner. It's a VERY rich recipe, and the thinner bars seemed to be just right. Any thicker and it would have been too much.

This is the best bar cookie I've ever had. I didn't have butter so I used butter flavored Crisco and it still turned out chewy and good!! I didn't put in nuts cause kids don't like them. Next time I'll use real butter and I'm sure it will be even better. Thanks for recipe:)

This is phenomenal.  Not too sweet and not too heavy.  I don't know why some people complained it was too sweet or that the chocolate mixture was too heavy.  It is simply perfect.

These squares draw rave reviews and they are even easy to make too.
