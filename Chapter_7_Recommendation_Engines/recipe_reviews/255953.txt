Awesome recipe. My fiancé and I loved these. I’m a male who loves to cook but doesn’t get much into Asian cuisine but I followed the recipe and it’s definitely, in my house, what we call a “Do Again!”

They are so good, but mine were soggy and falling apart. Not sure what I did wrong or how to change it. I pressed them together hard and they still fell apart.
