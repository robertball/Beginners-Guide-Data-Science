I thought this was pretty yummy. I have lost count how many recipes I have made for mock shakes and ice creams using bananas, so I followed this recipe exactly to see how it would turn out. Only change I made was using one large frozen banana. Honestly, even with the ice cubes I think the word "frozen" might be missing in the recipe. I have never tried one of these types of recipes without it calling for the banana to be frozen. That is what makes it cold, thick, and creamy like a milkshake or soft serve like drink. Was tasty this morning. Thanks

I made this a lighter banana milkshake by using Truvia instead of sugar. I used a frozen banana and omitted the ice. Delicious!

I love recipes like this because I can adapt them so easily. I used almond milk, a frozen banana with no added ice, and Truvia instead of sugar. A quick low-cal pick-me-up snack for the afternoon.

Que deliciosa!! Me encanto..super facil de preparar y los ingredientes son sencillos y baratos. No se necesita anadir el helado, que fue una cosa que nos encanto, porque no queriamos las calorias extras. Fue suficiente para nosotras dos ( mi hija la compartio conmigo,) y sobro un poco mas. Al final decidi anadirle una media cucharadita de mantequilla de mani, y me gusto aun mas. Esta receta la vamos a incluir en nuestro menu de desayunos para este (2013) verano.
Thanks..it was awesome. Will do it again, and again.

I made this delicious milkshake during one of my all-day tv marathons and it defiantly picked my spirit up. I added peanut butter and chocolate but I think I shouldn't have used the cinnamon and sugar because it was a little too sweet for my taste. But I think this is a great, easy, adjustable recipe!!!

This milkshake did not really taste very strongly of banana, but it still tasted fine. I used 3/4 cup of milk, and some extra cinnamon, and a tiny bit of vanilla and I thought it was pretty good. The only thing I didn’t like was how it didn’t really have a milkshake consistency, and how the banana flavor was really mellow. Other than that it was good.

Very simple and tasty.  Satisfied my craving for something sweet.  I followed this recipe exactly and mine was kind of thin in consistency.  I will add two more ice cubes next time.

Tastes a lot of banana. I would've added a 1/2 cup of more milk for a milkshake feeling.

Considering how easy this was to make, it was okay.  I probably will not make this again without some alterations for flavour.

I added a little more than what was called for.  I wanted a shake and based off of some of the reviews I was worried. I used 2 frozen bananas, a hand full of frozen strawberries, a tablespoon of a little more of sugar,  cinnamon, cup of 2% milk and a large clump of ice from a ice bag. It was almost perfect. Next time I won't use cinnamon. My husband loved this too!

Used 1.5 frozen bananas, almond milk, cinnamon, omitted the ice and sugar altogether, and added hemp & flax seed. Threw all the ingredients in my nutri-ninja and voila— something quick and nutritious to satisfy my sweet tooth. Super easy, flexible and yummy! Will be making this all the time

A little thin. Maybe freeze banana first. Overall easy and quick.

Alright, I decide to try making for myself. Easy steps, and cheap ingrendets. The cinnamon adds to the flavor, and all around an tasty drink. Make it if you like Bananas.

3.22.18  The consistency even with 3 ice cubes is like drinking a glass of cold banana milk.  I used almond milk and a really sweet banana so skipped the sugar, but still found the flavor a bit weak.  In the future, I would use 2 frozen bananas which should elevate the banana flavor and make the consistency more like a shake.  Adding additional ice cubes only dilutes the milkshake flavor.

I used a small ripe banana, so I reduced th amount of milk to 1/2 cup, then added a shot of rum ;)
I don't like sickly sweet cocktails, so this one was perfect!
Although next time, I might semi-freeze the banana first to make it a bit colder..

I did alter the ingredients with 2 Bananas, 8 fresh Strawberries, about 3/4 tsp of ground Cinnamon, about 1/4 tsp of Vanilla Extract, 4 packets of Equal, 2% Milk, 5 ice cubes...It was like a Banana Chai shake

I have to admit that I cheated. I used 1/2 & /12 instead of milk. I used 1/2 T of honey instead of  sugar and no ice cubes. I used a frozen banana.  It was excellent!!!

I make a version of this quite often, I freeze my bananas so I don't have to add ice that tend to water it down. I use 2 frozen bananas a dash of cinnamon a half a teaspoon agave syrup in place of the sugar,  Half cup almond milk. It's my favorite go to since becoming lactose intolerant!

Good base. I added 
1/2 avocado
Scoop of powdered peanut butter
Substituted  nut milk *cashew, or almond -unsweetened.
Does not need added sugar as banana is sweet.

Perfect for a quick banana milk fix for my 3y-o. I didn't have any ice cubes, so I used 1 frozen banana and a fresh banana (I made a double batch).  Tasted great!

Scrummy!  Used Lactofree milk, no sugar with a quite ripe banana. Definitely will be making this again and my daughter loves it too :-) 
I wanted something simple to make that didn't  need ice cream. 
Thank you.
