This was easy and outstanding. However, I did make it low in fat. I used 3 egg whites in place of the whole eggs and  I used 1/4 cup of applesauce in place of the oil.I sprayed the pan instead of greasing it. Then followed the recipe. It was great served warm from the oven and wonderful cold,too.
It's a keeper!

This kugel was absolutely delicious!  I changed the scale for 20 people because I had a large crowd this past Passover.  This recipe called for 8 eggs but because we watch our fat, I used 4 whole eggs and 8 whites.  I also used a little more raisins and added the juice and rind of one orange.  I think because of the sweetness of the orange, I might use a little less sugar next time.  My crowd dosen't usually eat sweet kugel but they devoured it.  It was light, moist and extremely tasty.  This will definitely be the kugel I make for all my future Passover dinners.

Excellent!  So easy to make and tasted awesome!  I did substitute 1/4 cup of applesauce for the oil (I try to cook using less fat) and gave the top of the kugel a dusting of cinnamon before putting it in the oven.  Will definitely make again and forward on! Thanks!!!

I also made this recipe according to the directions, and it was not good. Only one person in my house ate it, and they doused it with cream and sugar and ate it like cereal. Very bland. I wouldn't suggest it.

Our family and guests like this so much, I've now made it the last two years. I followed the recipe slavishly but needed to cook it 10 minutes longer. Also, next year I'll decrease the amount of sugar if the apples and raisins are again so sweet.

I followed the recipe as stated.  A simple apple kugel with good flavor and density.  I actually preferred it the next day, both cold and warmed.

This matzo kugel was absolutely delicious! But, I substituted the oil for applesauce, because I saw many comments about this suggestion. It is very moist, and is a nice treat for Passover. The key is to slightly undercook it. When I saw it in the oven, I thought it wasn’t ready, but I took it out and it was perfect. Don’t overcook it or it will be hard and dry.

This was the best matzos kugel I have ever made or tried. This is my new "go to" recipe.

I doubled the recipe and added cranberries.  I also substituted applesauce for the oil.  We finished the first tray on the first night of Passover.  That's saying a lot since there was so much food to choose from and so few of us.??

My husband really loved it. I thought it was pretty good and very easy to make. I would probably add more sugar next time though.  Or use a sweeter variety of apple.

I didn't add the raisins, and I decided this time (my second time making it), that the apples needed to be either chopped finer, or grated.  I decided to grate them.  It was really wonderful.  Very tasty and not too sweet.

I never made or had Kugel before this recipe.  I was curious so I finally made it and really enjoyed it.  Just the right amount of sweetness and a great snack.

I needed an ethnic recipe for my son to take to school in kid size portions.  I used 1/2 cup melted butter in place of the oil. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly, using Fuji apples.  I filled cupcake papers about 3/4 way full and baked for 30 minutes until the apples were soft.  I doubled the recipe and got 5 dozen cupcake portions.  Thank you for the recipe!
