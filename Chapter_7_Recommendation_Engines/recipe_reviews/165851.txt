I glazed my Thanksgiving ham with this.. I didnt have the minced onion, so I left it out.. I had made All Day Apple Butter (recipe from this site).  I also sliced up the ham, layed the slices in a pan and then put the sauce over it..  I baked it at 350 for about 35 minutes.. This turned out so yummy.. Made the ham taste fantastic..

I'm not a ham person at all, and usually skip the ham during Thanksgiving, but I ate more of the ham than the turkey this year.. 

Thank you for such a great recipe..

OMG! This was the best ham I've ever made (DH said so and he's a meat and potatoes kinda guy).  I had a 9.5lb shank that I covered with foil and cooked at 350 for 2.5 hours.  Then, I made the glaze and removed the foil and lowered the temp to 325 and cooked for 1 hour.  Talk about aromatic and juicy and tasty!    DH said I can NOT lose the recipe!!!!    Thank you!!!  V

Loved it! I whisked all of the ingredients right into a large skillet along w/some ham steaks & let it all simmer together. Subtle flavor, not overpowering or sickly sweet like similar recipes. I'll definately be making this again! Thank you!!

Awesome recipe. I had a 1/2 cup Apple butter in the fridge so when I when I found this recipe I decided to give it a try. I added two tablespoons brown sugar and a dash of ground cloves. Yummy!

This was very easy to make. I used the All-Day Apple butter as well. I wouldn't recommend using a smoked ham...I felt like the cmoked flavor over powered the apple flavor. The glaze by itself was wonderful and smelled delicious! I would recommend putting it on more than 30 minutes before your ham is finished (I used a 10 lb ham), and to broil it for 5-10 minutes to help caramelize the glaze.

Best glaze ever! Everyone loved it. I didn't use the dried onion, but I couldn't imagine that it would have been any better. I cooked my ham as directed and sliced it. I placed a layer of ham in the roasting pan and liberally brushed the glaze on, then another and so on. I poured the remaining glaze over the top layer and put it back in the over at 350 for 30 minutes.

My family and I loved this! It made our Thanksgiving Ham so good! My son said it beat the turkey!! :-) Though I used Onion Powder instead of onion flakes, which I thought was better.

Delicious! Before baking the ham, I studded the skin with whole cloves (about 15). When I made this glaze, I had to use cranberry instead of orange juice because that was what we had on hand. The ham smelled divine and tasted even better, and everyone gave rave reviews. I think I found my holiday ham glaze recipe!

Super easy to make.  I've tried this both as is and once I substituted cranberry juice for orange juice.  I personally felt like the cranberry blended a little smoother tastewise than the orange juice.

Made this for Easter dinner at the in-laws. A large family gathering with many picky eaters. I was asked last minute to bring a ham, and so only had a toupie ham in the freezer, nothing special. I made this glaze and followed the recipe exactly, basting the ham during the last half hour of cooking. Rave reviews all around from ham lovers and haters alike. I will actually be making apple butter this year just to make more ingredients for this ham glaze. I doubt I will ever use any other recipe. My toddler twins gobbled it up!

Apples and onions with uncured pork I can see...but I didn't like the idea of onions and ham.  Besides, the family isn't really big on onions, anyway...so I substituted the 1 tbsp onion flakes with 1 tbsp lemon juice (to bring out the apple flavor a bit more), and it came out fantastic :)

I imagine you could keep the onion flakes in and just add the lemon juice, if you were so inclined.  This was a really easy glaze and a great idea :)

I decided to use this on my Christmas ham instead of the usual pineapple/brown sugar glaze.  YUM!! And it smelled delicious while cooking.  I'll be using this recipe again!

This was the easiest and best recipe I've had for glazing a ham.
