It's a shame that the last reviewer only rated the recipe three stars because she didn't know how to keep the corn starch from clumping, because she did like the recipe.  Since there have been no other reviews until mine I'm assuming her three star revies has kept others from trying it.  Well here's a completely positive review! The pudding was fantastic and still is, I'm gulping it down as I write.  It's rich and you can't even tell there's no dairy!  Great for Vegans like me and even for you Dairy Lovers out there!  There's no difference in aste or texture between this recipe and your typical chocolate pudding recipe except this is better.  I'll never even consider store bought again!  To prevent the corn starch from clumping once added to the hot mixture you just need to make sure that the corn startch and water mixture are completely stirred together with no globs of corn startch left, it needs to be completely smooth.  If that part is done correctly, and it's not hard, there will be no clumping.  The only other way that cornstartch will clump is when it's added directly to a hot mixture, so always mix it first with a liquid until smooth or add cornstarch directly to what ever you're making, but make sure the mix you are adding it to is cold or cool.  Thanks for the recipe, I will be making this again and again!

I had doubts....but not anymore.  I used rice milk and it came out delicious.  I added a little extra vanilla, used the recommended 1/3 cup sugar and it was fabulous.  To prevent any clumps I mixed the cornstarch in the water first and then blended everything before heating....Smooth and Yummy.  Thanks.

I found that instead of mixing the water and the cornstarch, you should mix the sugar, cornstarch and cocoa powder together, then whisk that into the milk and water, and you will not get lumps. Also, you should put plastic wrap touching the top of the pudding to prevent that gluey mess on the top.

This is great for what it is!!  I like it better than chocolate pudding from the little cardboard box that's mixed with milk.  I read the reviews first and made a few changes:  First, I used chocolate soy milk instead of normal because that's what I already had in the refrigerator, and I added 1/3 a cup of sugar because some people had said it was bitter.  I also put in some cinnamon because I like cinnamon.  I put it all in the food processor and gave it a whirl to get the cocoa mixed in, I think maybe that step should be added to the directions!  That kept the texture perfectly smooth, and like some others have said, make sure that the cornstarch and cold water are completely mixed up before you add it to the rest of the stuff.  Next time, I'm going to add a little less cornstarch and more sugar, then I think it will be perfect :o)

This was pretty good though I could not keep the cocoa from clumping together.  Next time I'll mix it with a blender or mixer before heating it up.

YUMMY YUM YUM! 5 STARS!

My daughter is very restricted with how much dairy she can have. This recipe works very well for her. I have found that while I can use rice, almond, or soy milk, soy milk makes it set up the best, although vanilla almond milk makes it TASTE the best. Also, I just use an ounce of melted unsweetened chocolate instead of cocoa, it gives a richer flavor. Also, I increased the sugar to 1/3 of a cup. Both of these adjustments made a very good recipe excellent!

This pudding was excellent!  My daughter is allergic to dairy products, and this made a very tasty treat.  Although, I ate most of it myself.  Thanks so much.

This is a fantastic alternative.  I'm not vegan or lactose intolerant, I just like eating healthy.  I wanted to make homemade pudding, but when I looked recipes up it called for eggs and such. I just wanted to keep it simple and healthy.  This recipes provides just that.  Its great tasting and can easily be changed around a little bit to make it more interesting.  The first night I made it, I pretty much stuck to the recipe but I used dark chocolate almond milk instead of soy...it was simple and delicious.  However, the second time, my boyfriend added a little peanut butter and a handfull of chocolate chips...that too was delicious.

Great alternative pudding! My 3 year old is allergic to dairy and soy, this recipe worked with oat milk. I watered down the oat milk a little to and cut some of the sugar. 

To avoid lumping, in a separate bowl I whisked the cornstarch with cool water first. Then in another bowl I whisked the cocoa powder and then combined the cornstarch mixture before putting into the pot. Added the sugar when I was ready to start cooking. Whisked constantly over heat until it started thickening. 

Will use this base for fudgesicle this summer. Thanks!!

Very delicious considering I used Rice beverage instead of milk, like in traditional pudding.  Had no problems whats so ever with the cornstarch or cocoa clumping like others had posted.   Perfect for my son who has so many food allergies, this was a excellent find!  Thank you!!

We thought this was delicious! I did modify it a bit (used ground choc. chips instead of cocoa pwdr, scraped a vanilla bean into the mixture before cooking, and added a pinch of salt), and also doubled it, but it was rich and creamy and the children, husband, and guests never guessed it was dairy-free! THanks Kathleen.

Chocolate pudding is my hubby's favorite dessert but since I found out I had a dairy intolerance several months ago we had to give it up. I was excited to see a veagn alternative with this recipe. I used chocolate soy milk to amp up the chocolate flavor. It was easy to make and the consistency was good once chilled but it just wasn't the same as dairy pudding. It wasn't very sweet and it was missing the creaminess. It was ok but not wonderful. I also think the recipe could have included how long to cook the pudding for once it started boiling.

You need to mix all ingrediants in the pan before you start heating it to prevent lumps. This goes with all cornstarch pudding. No need to mix cornstarch with water first- I didn't even add the water, just wisk everything with the cold soymilk. I used chocolate soymilk, and 2T. cocoa, and agave nectar instead of sugar.

Very good considering I have attempted several dairy-free chocolate pudding recipes. This is one I would make again. Good consistency and very chocolatey tasting.

Ok it doesn't taste exactly like the usual milk chocolate pudding but it's pretty darn good.  I agree with previous reviewers that the texture is not a problem if you dissolve the cornstarch in water first and add it to the mixture before it boils.  Secondly, to make it a bit sweeter, I used 1/3 cup suger instead.  To give it more chocolate flavor, I added some (less than a quarter cup) of vegan chocolate chips.  That last step gives is a rich chocolate flavor that cocoa lacks.  I made it with rice milk instead of soy for my allergy kids and the texture was perfect. Rice milk lacks that strong soy taste that many are not fond of.  Next time I might add a 1/2 tsp of vanilla instead of a quarter.

I tried this recipe as I Had some soy milk due to having irritable syndrome. I only abstain from dairy products while my insides have flared up. I have enver used soy milk before until recently. This recipe was gross. I carefully mixed the water and cornstarch and the pudding was nice and smooth, but it tasted horrible. I am too used to rich yummy tasting puddings with real milk or cream. It seems that anything I try with soy milk tastes awful. It's not the diet for me. Someone who is used to a soy diet might love this recipe so don't be put off by my review.

Unfortunately, I had the same problem with my chocolate clumping. As for taste, I liked it but thought it could have been sweeter. It's a very dense pudding compared to instant kinds-I couldn't finish 1 serving. If I make this pudding again, I think I'll add more sugar and get the clumps out of the chocolate BEFORE I put it in the saucepan.

Loved the recipe! We used Rice dream instead of soy.  I was very excited when it started getting thick and actually looking like real chocolate pudding.  I had to add a little more sugar though.  Yum!

I made this for my 8 yr old daughter who is allergic to milk (and many other things). She loved it so much that she asked me to write to you and tell you thank you! I am enjoying it too. I will never pay $5.00 for 4 little cartons of soy pudding again! Thank you!!!

This is absolutely delicious!  I made a double batch, but used 1/4 cup sugar & it was still great.  Tip: Heat water in the microwave before adding to cornstarch, use a whisk and mixing is so easy.  This is so simple & delicious!!

Like others I increased the sugar to 1/3 cup and I followed the microwave directions someone else had discovered of 1 min stir another min stir, another min stir, 20 sec, 20 sec (at that time it didn't change any so I called it done) and stuck it in the freezer to quick chill. Taste was there...but unlike store bought puddin cups it had kinda a rubbery texture...but the flavor was there...IDK if reducing the amount of corn starch would fix the rubber problem?

This was delicious - thanks! I read over a lot of the postings beforehand, so I mixed together the dry ingredients first, before whisking in the wet ones, to avoid lumps. I also added 1/4 cup vegan chocolate chips for extra sweetness and chocolate flavor. Very good by itself or in a graham cracker pie shell.

Loved this recipe. I am not a vegan and I still used regular milk, but the flavor is good. I did mess up with the cornstartch (I don't usually use it) and the cocoa balled up some, but nothing a little sifting can't handle.

Quite good. It might be worth mentioning that I was able to make this in the microwave without issue (it saved the [minimal] effort of washing a saucepan). I just mixed all of the ingredients in a microwave-safe container and cooked on high for three minutes, stirring at the one and two minute marks, and then every twenty seconds or so until it had thickened fully. I fear I'll be making this with some regularity, from here on out.

I love this stuff! I used the recipe as my base and have made several diffenent flavors by omitting the cocoa powder and mixing Silk coffee creamer with my soy milk for a creamier texture.  You can use the plain or french vanilla depending on what flavor you are making.  The last try was using raspberry flavoring with the plain creamer in 1 cup and plain soy milk as a half cup.  I also reduced the cornstarch to 2 1/2 T.  Then, if you want to make it sugar free... use 1/4 tsp. of liquid stevia in place of the sugar.  It makes a great dish for diabetics or anyone cutting calories!

I have zero probs with this recipe.  It's worked as an easy, last-minute dessert for me many a time, and it has the added bonus of being dairy free! (The Lactose Intolerant rejoice) Don't judge it by its stars.  Try it for yourself!

This recipe tasted very bad.  There certainly needed to be more sugar to flavor the unsweetened cocoa, but there was also a problem with the soymilk.  I know in preparing steamed espresso drinks with soy, you can not allow the soymilk to become too hot or it will begin to seperate and become salty.  I think that was the problem with this recipe.  Perhaps the soymilk should be added later in the cooking process to prevent the milk from becoming too hot and separating?  I don't recommend this recipe.

I made this recipe just to try a dairy free pudding and it was really good.  It was not like my usual very milk-chocolately and sweet pudding, but it was a great darker chocolate pudding.  A GREAT dairy free alternative.  Thanks.

this pudding was so much more creamier then some of the other recipes i've used (non vegan).  in the photo i made the chocolate and mixed with cherries to make my Black Forest Parfaits.  then i made some white chocolate for my Island Road Parfaits and my cousins (who are vegan) loved them.

I've been making this pudding for years...I always use chocolate soy milk instead of plain. I also pour into a graham cracker crust to make pie. It's always a hit!

One night I was craving some good comfort food - chocolate pudding! I've never made it from scratch, but I hoped I could find a recipe with ingredients I had on hand. This recipe is so easy and I was thoroughly impressed with how it turned out! Most cooks know to stir corn starch in cold water first, so as long as you stick to that rule it will turn out smooth and creamy. I'm already thinking of ways to add to it - peanut butter, white choco chips, it's endless... This will become a favorite of mine fast!

I didn't care for this. I didn't have any trouble with clumping, but it came out quite thick. Not a pudding consistency at all. The flavor was also lacking. Not chocolaty or sweet enough.

Great recipe! My kiddos are lactose intolerant and making this with almond milk was a quick easy dessert for them. I also used 1 tsp. vanilla and 1/3 cup of sugar. Make sure and dissolve the cornstarch completely in the cold water, then whisk into the chocolate mixture slowly.

If you follow everyone's directions and mix the cornstarch with water until completely smooth before adding it to the chocolate soy milk mixture, I promise you there will be no lumps. Texture-wise the pudding was great, and it does thicken a great deal when it's cooling.  I used 1/3 cup of raw sugar - if you're making vegan pudding, be aware that white sugar can be bleached with bone char. Unlike other reviewers I found 1/3 cup to be a tad too sweet, and I think the 1/4 cup in the recipe would have been enough, but I've lost my sweet tooth so if you're making this for little kids 1/3 would be a good idea.  I didn't think it tasted like regular dairy pudding at all, but I really didn't expect it to, especially since I use pure soy milk and not those blended "beverages". Considering this is nothing more than soy milk, cornstarch, and cocoa, I'd say this makes a pretty decent pudding to satisfy a chocolate craving. Some other recipes recommend adding soy creamer, so I'm going to give those a try, but this basic recipe is so easy, so simple, and tasty enough that there's no point in complaining about it.

I'm not sure what to rate this because the idea is there and it definitely tasted good while it was cooking but after cooling it was not sweet enough. I used almond milk instead of soy and it was smooth and looked great. I'll try this again and double the sugar and repost a review.

When I first did this I too had trouble with the chocolate clumping; but I found a solution; use Chocolate Silk Soy instead of chocolate powder; it cuts down on the sugar; for extra flavoring I use half the amount of chocolate; it is my favorite pudding recipe.

I made this for my 3 1/2 year old that's allergic to milk.  I didn't have cocoa powder, so I used Hershey's chocolate syrup instead.  I also used vanilla soymilk instead of regular.  Otherwise, I just followed the directions and it came out great.  It was VERY sweet, but did have a slight soy taste.  My son's never had regular milk or pudding, so he certainly didn't care.  There are very few chocolate products he can have and it's nice to have a few as a treat.  It was so quick and easy, I can make it for a nice snack.

This was great, firmed up nicely and everything. Th taste was odd though, not because of the soy milk though. I would recommend using high quality cocoa powder or another form of chocolate to give it the right flavor. Thanks!

my mom made death by chocolate for the rest of my family...i was jealous. so i went to look for an easy chocolately vegan recipe. i'd all but given up on pudding, but i just made this and tried it warm. quite tasty, and the consistency is great. the one thing is that it does need more sugar, and some cinnamon. but still, it's great. ^_^

I loved this recipe.  After 5 1/2 years of no dairy I thought I'd never be able to eat something of this consistancy again.  It was just like Chocoloate Mousse!  I used brown sugar instead of white and it was delicious.  Thank you for the recipe.

About a year and a half ago I had to give up creamy cheesecakes, ice creams, and other dairy delights due to lactose intolerance.  I am always on the lookout for soy-based replacements.  This hit the spot.

I followed a previous suggestion and added some cinnamon - however, did add too much (oops!), so be careful not to do the same!  The texture was excellent, and I didn't have the patience to wait for the pudding to cool before digging in.

I will try almond milk next time, since it is richer than either rice or soy.  However, since I am used to soy milk, I didn't notice the soy flavor - I just think that almond milk might work even better!

I made this yesterday after having an unusual craving for chocolate pudding. I needed it not only dairy free, but Paleo as well, so I used arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch and used a granulated monk fruit sweetener to cut down on calories and carbs. I had some issues with clumping but after switching from a spoon to a whisk to stir the mixture, the clumps broke down easily and the pudding turned out very thick and rich. I will be making this again!!

I am allergic to dairy and soy, so I used coconut milk.  I also used a stevia baking product instead of sugar.  It never boiled, but it thickened very nicely and turned out a perfect texture and it tasted Delicious!  It was exactly what I was hoping to find.

Chocolate is usually my go-to treat when my late night cravings kick in. I wanted something light & easy to put together. I used almond milk instead of soy & coconut sugar instead of white sugar. I personally thought that the amount of sugar called for was perfect. It wasn't sickeningly sweet nor was it overly bitter. Just perfect! Love. I didn't have any issues with clumping either. I mixed the cornstarch/water until smooth & sifted the cocoa powder. The texture of the pudding is just like any other pudding, but the taste is so much better than store-bought. I highly recommend this recipe & will definately be making again!

We don't keep soy milk in the house so we used chocolate rice milk instead.  Because we already had chocolate, we decreased the cocoa to 1tbsp and we added 1 tsp of cinnamon just for fun.  It's a big hit with the eight year old who's birthday it's for :)

Our family thinks it is amazing. Thank you for the great recipe.  We use canned coconut milk instead of soy milk.

Yum.  I substituted rice milk instead of soy.  I was really craving Chocolate today. This recipe made it easy to enjoy on my new diet.  I would note that it tastes like dark chocolate.  If you prefer milk chocolate, add a bit more sugar.

Super good. I split the cocoa powder- 1 part dark cocoa, 2 parts normal. And I ran out of soy milk so for half of it I used coconut milk. I made sure the corn starch and water was super blended and completely smooth before I added it into the remaining ingredients, which I had already mixed thoroughly. Great recipe!

As much as I love soy milk or any dairy-free
milk, the overall taste wasn't that great.  I'll be honest though, it was creamy!  Update:  the next day I ate the rest because I didn't want it to go to waste.  I added butter and a little more sugar .... perfect!

Delicious! Be sure to read other reviews and do the cornstarch right. I doubled the sugar and used Splenda instead, because I like stuff extra sweet. Thickened up perfectly! Also used plain light soy milk. I'm anxious to try the with other "milk" varieties.

Very good...the best non-dairy pudding I've tasted!  We used coconut milk, and the amount of 'milk' the recipe called for was exactly the same amount that was in the can, so it was super easy!  I did up the vanilla a bit, since we like vanilla here.  I used a full teaspoon. Seriously yummy.  The trick to making it not clump is 1) whisk it like crazy when you add the cocoa powder, before adding the cornstarch mixture, and 2) add the cornstarch mixture slowly while whisking, and don't stop whisking after you add it.  It will thicken up very quickly.  Don't heat it for too long after you add the cornstarch, just long enough to thicken a bit.

I love this recipe! I use Truvia instead of sugar and an almond milk that is only 45 calories/cup - it's a real treat when you want a low calorie dessert. Super easy!

PERFECT for our little 3-yo dairy-allergic chocoholic!!  We don't do soy milk, but used a mix of Almond & Vance's DariFree 'milks'!  Was REALLY good!! May try all Vance's DariFree 'milk' next time...  We used the recommended 1/3c sugar & thoroughly whisked the cornstarch & water together!  Gobbled up in a couple days! :)
Thanks!! :)

This was a terrific and easy recipe. It came together very easily. I followed the ingredients/directions exactly, but then thought the flavor could be 'kicked up a notch.' So, I stirred in some cinnamon, cayenne pepper, and some vegan chocolate chips.

We ate the first batch when it was still slightly warm, and it was very good. But, the last container (which we ate the next night) was MUCH better. So, I would recommend waiting until the pudding is completely cold before eating. The added cayenne made the flavor almost like a Mexican hot chocolate. Yummy!

Contrary to what other reviewers are saying, this pudding is YUMMY!! The key that I've found is using a wisk to stir instead of a spoon. That will make sure there are no lumps! And I used lactaid milk instead of soy, but it came out very well. I'm definately going to use this again!

This was delicious.  I only had Hersey's dark cocoa powder in the house but that worked well.  It would have been even better with a premium cocoa.  I did have a good quality bourbon vanilla extract and added 1/2 - 1 tsp Cinnamon to provide for more complex flavors.  Recommended!  Each spoonful was savored slowly.  I also mixed the cornstarch in water, then added all to the blender before cooking to prevent lumps.  My other modifications were to up the sugar to 1/3 cup (as others have suggested) and to add 3 - 4 Tbsp of Acacia soluble fiber.  The fiber was added for digestibility alone as assimilated itself well into the mix.  I will be making this my staple desert instead of half a bar of rich dark chocolate.  Much less fat and much more digestible.  Great recipe!

I used ALMOND MILK - not soy milk - despite all the marketing claiming how much "healthier" soy is, actually it's harder on our digestive systems, plus almond milk TASTES BETTER than any alternative (unless you're allergic of course).  it was awesome, my kids ate this all up!

I love this recipe.  my one year old can't have dairy so we have tried various types of lactose free drinks until we found one he liked, it took almost a month of buying one carton of each brand.(vanilla rice milk). it is soo easy to make and now both my boys can have pudding.

Easy and rewarding recipe! So many comments that say otherwise - I don't understand!  mix cornstarch & water first in the saucepan, then add other ingredients.  The cocoa powder is clumpy at first, but continuous stirring resolves that.  I usually add chocolate chips or m&ms before refrigerating.

The first time I made it I found the original recipe to be too thick and lumpy.  So the 2nd time I reduced the cornstarch to 2 TBS and made sure that the cornstarch was completely dissovled in the water with no lumps before adding it to the milk.  Then I thought it was delicious!

This was soooo yummy, AFTER it was chilled.  before it was chilled it was very bland so I definitely recommend letting it sit in the fridge overnight.  I added a couple tablespoons more sugar than it called for and added some dairy free chocolate chips because I think it lacked the chocolate flavor that I was craving, but that was a personal preference.

I'm not a big fan. It was a bit too bitter for me and very very lumpy. I whisked it for a long while but the lumps just wouldn't go away! I'll keep looking for a different recipie. It's a good start at least.

My dad's first words: "Well, this is goodbye to store-bought pudding mixes!" He couldn't believe it was home-made! I tasted a lot of soy milk in the aftertaste but my vegan sister really felt that the chocolate came in strong, as did the rest of my siblings. I doubled the recipe and got 6 servings of the size we usually have. I wasn't too diligent about stirring constantly, but 
I don't think it mattered too much.

First off, I would like to say that cooking with soy milk varies your results based on what brand you use.  I've found that cooking with the Silk brand always leave me with food that taste of nothing but soy.  So the problem may be your brand, not the recipe.  (I used organic milk because i'm out of soy milk and this is the easiet pudding recipe I found.)

That said, I gave this recipe four stars because I think it's a good start.  I didn't add the extra sugar, but I did follow the advice of one reviewer and added some chocolate chips.  I ended up with a very rich pudding.  My husband said he thought it was bitter, but I didn't think so (we have different preferences on how much sugar we like).

So if you're someone who likes more sugar, bump it up to 1/3 cup.

This recipe was VERY good.  I always follow recipe measurements exactly as listed the first time. It would definitely work better with 1/3 cup sugar.  Lightly pack the baking cocoa for a great chocolately taste, and stir it all using a whisk to help ensure a smooth texture.  My daughter and I are ALLERGIC to MILK PROTEIN, which means that we can't even have some stuff marked as "lactose-free" (I prefer breathing).  

Kathleen, THANK YOU for providing a great recipe!  This is quick, easy, and very satisfying.

So easy and yummy!  I'm a new vegan and was craving chocolate.  This really hit the spot!  I used unsweetened almond milk instead of soy, and cane sugar instead of white.  I used a whisk and the texture turned out perfectly.  Zero lumps.  Will be making this again!

So we just made this but it turns out that pudding was too thick.  I realize that the recipe calls for 3 tablespoons of cornstarch but if you do half of it it should be right.

I liked these but made minor changes. Reduced oil to 1 cup and sugar to 1.25 cups, then added a generous 1/2 cup of applesauce. Added extra spices just because I like them and went light on the chips because it’s what I had.  Texture was perfectly fine with the switches but only got 23 muffins.

First time making dairy-free pudding that doesn't come from a box. I was pleasantly surprised. I modified this a bit and used tapioca starch, because I can't eat cornstarch, and I used unsweetened almond milk (b/c I can't eat soy) and honey. It came out delicious! It's creamy, smooth and quick to make. Next time, I might try the blender trick several others recommended, because while I didn't have a problem with the tapioca starch, I'd forgotten what a pain cocoa powder is to whisk in. A blender would've made that much easier and faster. Thanks so much for this recipe. As someone with a lot of food sensitivities, I'd all but given up on being able to eat pudding. :)

This was FANTASTIC. Another person suggested whisking the dry ingredients together first (in the saucepan, no bowl necessary) to make sure the cornstarch didn't clump (it was perfect, no lumps). I also didn't use Dutch processed cocoa (not Hershey's), but that's my preference. Doubled the batch and poured it into a prebaked pie crust, then right into the fridge. Inhaled 6 hours later! It was missing the depth of a true chocolate custard pie to me, but it was an excellent substitute that didn't taste like a second best choice. And my vegan friend loved it too :)

I tripled the recipe and used arrowroot starch instead of cornstarch. For a while, I thought it wasn't going to thicken but then all of a sudden, it thickened really quickly! Left it in the fridge overnight and enjoyed it the next day. SOO delicious!

I make it exclusively with low sugar or full sugar soymilk.  The kids love it.  I have a little trouble controlling the for want of better words,   the difference between  creamy smoothness and  stiffness.  I think it happens when it's cooked a little too long.  Advice?

Love this pudding! I used half unsweetened almond milk and half unsweetened coconut milk, and a pinch of sea salt, which brought out the sweetness and cocoa flavor even more.  I think the key to this recipe is to use top quality ingredients.
  IT'S A KEEPER!

It's ok.  I doubled the recipe (four servings), which filled 6 standard ramekins nicely, with plenty left for the chef to "clean up" at the end.  I upped the sugar, as many recommended (2/3 cup for my double size), and made a few additional changes from my experience making "regular" full-dairy pudding, but I still found this a little lacking in flavor.  

The amount of vanilla extract didn't seem enough for the volume of liquid, so I added a splash more.  I also added a pinch of salt, and to add a little richness (which from reading other reviews I saw might be lacking), I added just under a tablespoon of butter at the end (I was more worried about the lactose than the vegan aspect, and a Tbs of butter in the whole dish didn't seem like it would be a problem).

Again, all in all, not bad, but if I make this again, I'll probably play with the recipe a little bit more.  Texture seemed fine, but could probably use a little more vanilla extract / chocolate / sugar to up the flavor.

I just made this and it turned out great.  I also added the cornstarch to the sugar and cocoa powder before adding to the milk and stirred constantly until it came to a boil.  I used almond milk because that’s what I had.  I doubled the recipe and put it in a baked pie crust.  Yum!

This was very good and very rich, almost like a mousse.  I used unsweetened vanilla almond milk, added a handful of chocolate chips right after turning off the heat (they melt right in), and upped the sugar to 1/3 cup.   Another reviewer is right:  put all the dry ingredients in the pan and whisk, then add the milk and whisk again, then turn the heat on and stir until starting to bubble.  No need to mix the cornstarch with water ahead of time...it thickens just fine, no lumps, when the almond milk is added.  I added the vanilla extract right before turning off the heat.  The handful of chocolate chips makes it more decadent.  We spooned So Delicious coconut whipped topping onto it before serving. Sweet Jesus, it's ridiculous.

Dee-lish! My 10 y.o made this (with a bit of my help) and he did a fantastic job - NO lumps!!  He didn’t use a blender, just followed instructions, stirred constantly and voila! Smooth delicious chocolate pudding, most of which was consumed during the cooling period.  Used Almond Vanilla Silk instead of soy and 1/3 cup sugar as recommended by another reviewer. Definite keeper, thanks for sharing :)

This is a very easy recipe and will be my go to for the moment.  I found it a bit sweet, so I reduce the sugar next time I make it.  I would be prefer it to be a bit more chocolatey, so I will have to figure out how to do that, but other wise, the texture and creaminess is wonderful.  It is a keeper.

Yum Yum!!!  I just finished whipping up this recipe.  I made it as the recipe is written.   As it was thickening up in the pot I could not resist a little taste.  It was delicious!!   I am partial to dark chocolate which is more to the bitter taste.  For me, this recipe as is is wonderful.  If you like sweeter chocolate I might substitute the cocoa for sweeter chocolate as other suggested.   As for texture it is very creamy.   Would make a great pie!!

Cornstarch thickened perfectly, came out fine with almond milk substitute.
Very rich, though I'd recommend reducing the sugar or using unsweetened milk subs if you're not a super sweet type of person

I really did love this recipe! It didn't taste quite like chocolate pudding with dairy in it, but that might be because I didn't have any soy milk on hand, so i substituted with almond milk and added an extra couple of tablespoons of sugar.  It didn't turn out perfectly, but that was my fault. It came out a tad clumpy because I didn't mix in the cocoa powder more gradually. 
The only things I'd suggest to add to the recipe are two tablespoons of sugar, instructions on how high and for how long to cook it, and provide a tad bit more in depth instructions on how to add the ingredients, as I see a few others in the review had the clumping problem, except with the cornstarch.
Overall, I really did like this recipe and I recommend you try it to see how it works out for you, even if it isn't something you're completely used to :)

For dairy free pudding I was very impressed at how well this turned out. Both my kids loved it and it was very easy/quick. Mine did get a tiny bit lumpy but only by looks. None of us could taste the tiny lumps, and there weren't that many of them.

This recipe works with any plant based milk. So delicious!! Once it starts to thicken, it happens VERY fast so it can be taken off about a minute after it starts to thicken. If you like very sweet pudding (more like the box), increase the sugar. I haven't tried it, but the base recipe would likely work with any flavors like lemon or vanilla (adjusting sugar to taste).

This seems like the most boring pudding recipe. It was so easy to make I thought it couldn't possibly be good. However, it turned out rich and silky and I got a pleasant feeling of self-indulgence with minimal guilt while eating it. Then, to my great surprise, my husband asked me to make it again the very next night.... that's right... pudding. 

I replaced the soy milk with a mix of almond and coconut milk. I'm going to top it with whipped coconut cream and nuts this time around. Oh, and I had better luck mixing 3 Tbsp of water with the corn starch rather than 2 in order to get a nice, pourable slurry with no lumps (I actually use my fingers to mix so that I can tell when the lumps are all gone... gross, perhaps, but effective!)

Very nice, a bit lumpy but just mix and the mixture and it won't clump. Would recommend making it. And quite nice for vegans.

Freakin delicious y'all! Instead of soy milk I used almond milk, instead of sugar I used a Stevia/Sugar blend. This made my little dairy allergy laden heart explode with happiness! Also my mouth explode with tastiness!

I followed the suggestion to combine the sugar, cornstarch and cocoa then add the cold liquids before heating it up and with a little whisking it came out dreamy smooth and super delicious. I substituted cashew milk for the soy and added a dash of cinnamon and I will be making this again soon. Thanks!

So good!  To increase the yield 3x, do I just increase the ingredients 3x  or  does something need to be increased at a different rate?

There is nothing better than a creamy bowl of pudding! I did add a pinch of salt to mine, but the variance was so minor that I still gave this recipe five stars! Comes together easily and quickly.

I really love this recipe.  Both how easy it is and the results are extremely creamy and  delightful.  I've made it with ricemilk and soy and both are great.  If I was making this for kids I might  tone down the cocoa a bit and add a bit more sugar.  But for myself I make this as is. Yum.

Totally made this pudding last night. I  tripled the recipe to use in making a dairy free trifle. The taste was light, not too sweet, pretty good. The only thing is that when it cooled it became very gelatinous. And I had to re-whisk it. Also, saw later on from a trifle recipe,  and would strongly advise to pour hot pudding thru a colander to strain out the small lump bits of corn starch.  I didn't know to do this and today there were small bits in the pudding.  Hoping it all blends in with the rest of the trifle. ;)

So easy and tasted AMAZING!!! Even my non-vegan fam loved which is always a bonus. NOTE: For first time makers i made the mistake of adding the corn starch mixture while the rest of the mixture was already hot in the pan, add the cornstarch mix when the other ingredients are still cold otherwise the pudding will go all clumpy and nastayyyy! Otherwise, its an awesomely easy recipe and im gonna go whip up a batch now. Ciao

This vegan pudding is AWESOME!!!! my daughter was visiting us for the week and other members of my family were all coming to dinner. I made a non vegan dessert and wanted to make something special for my daughter who loves pudding.
I made this recipe and she absolutely loved it, happy I made two batches since my non vegan guest also loved it. I added some strawberries when I served it. This is a definite keeper.
Thanks for the recipe :)

Very easy great recipe.  I used 1 can of organic coconut milk.  I took 2 tablespoons out of it and mixed the cornstarch in that first, then added everything to the pan.  It's creamy and delicious with a nice coconut flavor.  Next time I may substitute a liquere for the vanilla like amaretto or grand marnier.

Delicious recipe! Creamy and chocolaty!  Only hard part is the continual whisking, but other than that, it's a fairly quick and easy recipe. I think it's better than dairy pudding!

I made this over the summer. It was good but it defiantly wasn't my favorite.  There was something missing to the taste. It came out clumpy, but that was just me. That really had no say in the actual taste of the pudding. I would make it again if I had some friends over who didn't really have dairy but, not for my self. I think everyone should at least try this once! Maybe you will like it :)

I made this with some changes. I used vanilla almond milk, increased sugar to 1/3 cup and vanilla to 1/2 tsp. + added 1/4 tsp. almond extract. For those who had a problem with clumping cornstarch, make a slurry by putting the cold water into a jar, add the cornstarch, cover jar and shake like mad. Pour everything else into the pot and continue as for recipe. At the end, I added 1/2 oz. chopped unsweetened chocolate while mixture was still hot. Be sure to cover the still warm mixture with plastic wrap, or a skin will form.

I added a half cup more of soy milk and a third cup of vegan chocolate chips. This is the best, richest, chocolate pudding I've ever had. The next time I make it I'll be sure to add some coconut whipped cream...

I just made this and quadrupled the recipe.  Generally all went very well.  I just found that for my taste I needed to kick up the chocolate flavor and add some extra sugar, so I blended in semi-sweet chocolate bits (which is what I had on hand) along with some extra sugar and it did the trick perfectly.  (I think I may have needed to do this in part because I do not love soy milk - next time I will try rice or almond milk and maybe it will be different flavor-wise.)  Overall, a great option!  I'm making it for my best friend who is dairy free and has a birthday tomorrow and said the only thing she misses desperately is chocolate pudding!  Can't wait to give it to her :)

This recipe is great for those who opt out on dairy. Love it! Really make sure the cornstarch and water is mixed well, otherwise you end up with awkward clumps at the end.

I absolutely love this recipe. I used coconut milk instead of soy because I like it better and it worked really well. I also added a bit of salt. I'm lactose intolerant but really love pudding, so thanks so much for the recipe.

so easy and quick! it worked well with a mix of soy and almond milk. it made VERY LARGE servings, which wasnt a problem since i was using it to fill tarts, but i would probably use the recipe for "2 servings" to feed 3 or 4 people as a dessert. although im not saying i couldnt eat the entire recipe ;)

Great for vegans with a sweet tooth! Simple, fast, and ingredients that most people have on hand. 

If you use a milk substitute that isn't very sweet (I used Organic Unsweetened Silk) I would suggest adding a little more sugar.  I would ignore the part about putting the corn starch and water in a separate bowl. Add all of the wet ingredients, then the dry ingredients, mix, and put it on heat. 

Also, while I was whisking it over heat it suddenly (and I mean SUDDENLY) became thick. I was worried, but it turned out fine. 

Highly recommend.

Very light, despite it'sleep chocolate color.  I doubled the recipe for a party and it got rave reviews.  Like people recommended, I changed the sugar to 1/3 cup (2/3 to double the recipe) and I used rice milk.  At first it was frustrating because it didn't seem like the cocoa was going to mix, it just floated on top for forever.  But eventually it incorporated and I cooked it until it seemed thick enough, cooled it the pan for bit and then finally transferred to a glass bowl to refrigerate.  Everyone liked it! Light texture and great aftertaste.

I made this pudding tonight for my son who can't have dairy or gluten.  I 4 times it and hoped I wasn't making a big mistake.  Absolutely not! It was amazing! My two sons, my husband, my daughter and four of my grandchildren who were visiting inhaled it while it was still warm! The only thing I did different was to mix the sugar and cocoa together to break up the lumps in the cocoa.  I've already promised my grandkids I would make more for this weekend if this batch is gone when they come out. Thank you so much, Kathleen!!

I love chocolate pudding, but am unfortunately lactose intolerant. I am so glad I found this recipe! It's really good. I made a couple of changes. I'm not a fan of soy milk, so I used coconut milk instead and it worked really well. I also added a pinch (maybe 1/8 of a tsp.) of salt. Next time I think I'll try using mint.

This vegan recipe tastes just like dairy-pudding. It is creamy and chocolate-y. I did not alter anything. Serves about 4 if you imagine a serving being like the pudding cups at the store.

Amazing! I like to add some sea salt though, it intensifies the chocolate flavour.

I really like this recipe and it's so easy to make and then so delicious. The flavor reminds me of some chocolate popsicles but in the best of ways. I ended up using almond milk for my second run but that tasted just as good.

The recipe cooked up great but the end result was a little bitter so to save the day for any one who's made it and discovered this downer to fix it up sweeter you should in a small bowl pour in some soy milk and whisk in some powdered sugar and then slowly add little by little into your pudding checking every few teaspoons of sugar/milk mixture :)

Wow! As smooth as cake mix and tastier!  I used Almond Milk (as my son has soy allergies) and it is phenomenal!  He will have a new tasty treat that will be the envy of all his classmates!

vanilla is listed as an ingredient but never mentioned again.  I guessed at putting it in between the boiling and the thickening stage.

More to the point, how do I tweek the taste so it is more "chocolately" than "cocoa-ey".

Then finally would like an estimate for how much to prepare for an 9" pie.
I multiplied the two servings of pudding by four (8 pie slices?) and ended up with way toooo much pudding. 

I liked (and followed) the suggestion to use rice milk rather than soymilk.  And used half original flavor and half chocolate rice milk.  

But otherwise good and relatively easy to follow.

Added 6 packets of sweet and low instead of sugar and used low sugar soy milk. Next time used Almond milk, 1/2 cup Splenda  and 2 oz melted unsweetened choc.

I REALLY enjoyed this pudding recipe and it was so simple!  And vegan!

I did increase the sugar to 1/3 cup and also added an 1/8 tsp of orange extract which gave the pudding a wonderful 'chocolate orange' flavor.

Yum!

This came together so quickly.  I used 1/3 cup sugar and I am glad I did.  It still isn't sweet enough for the kids, but, I think it is great.

To adults it isn't very good, but our one year old daughter loved it.  It is an aquired taste.

Great pudding... but the cornstarch clumped up when added to the soy milk mixture. Does anyone know how to fix this?
