Definitely use the OLD ENGLISH spread that comes in a little jar with a blue top (you can find it where you would find Cheez Whiz ~~ but PLEASE don't use Cheez Whiz for this recipe, it will come out too runny! :)  When I originally submitted the recipe I specifically mentioned Old English spread, but I guess this site doesn't allow brand names so it wasn't included...but that's a critical part of this recipe.  Something I've started doing is making these without the shrimp but adding chopped chives and green onions to the cheese mixture instead and serving alongside homemade tomato basil soup....I don't think life gets any better than that, especially on a cold winter's night!!  ENJOY! :)

Made them as an appetizer for a birthday dinner.  They were loved by all.  I think I might use slightly larger shrimps next time, and the time after that, and the time after that...........

This is a very easy and quick appetizer.  Great to make ahead of time and refrigerate or freeze for later use.

You HAVE TO use the Old English cheese spread for these. I also make these omitting the shrimp and using a can of "picked-through" flaked crab meat. DELISHIOUS!!!!

This recipe feels like home!  My mom used to make these for all of our family parties.  The only difference is that she would put them under the broiler to get them bubbly and toasty.  The crispy / burnt texture makes the english muffin crunch.  For those that think it's too salty, try using butter w/o salt.

Wow were these rich! We made them 2 times, with small shrimp and with canned crab. Both were magnificent! Tips for success: Use half of the butter called for: can be a bit greasy, Use english muffins: bagels dont work as well, and Kraft Old English cheese spread: Velveeta won't cut it. They freeze well and are soooo good!

I'm editing my review because I served this at Thanksgiving today and the new adjustments I made were a huge hit for my relatives who have had this before.  Big improvement for a little work, get a handful of medium frozen shrimp, boil them in lightly salted water, chop them and use them instead of those babies out of the can.  I used 5oz of pub cheese because I didn't have the Old English and it was just as good.  Lastly, bake them on the halved english muffins and cut them into wedges after they've rested for a couple of minutes.  This allows all of that cheese and butter to settle into the nooks and cranies before you cut into them let it all melt out onto the tray all run out.  YUM!

Outstanding! I used the Old English as recommended. I also used about 10 jumbo shrimp in place of the canned, and added about a 1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese. Also, I also got 10 servings.

These came out very soggy and there was way too much butter. I think they would taste okay if you cut out a lot of the butter.

For simple ingredients like these, it is surprisingly good. I used frozen small cooked shrimp, and put a little bit of shredded sharp cheddar on top. Everyone liked them, they were the first thing to go at the party.

i have made a version of this for years - but with canned crab meat.  definately use the 'old english' cheese - the 'wiz' will definately be too runny.  the crab distributes more evenly with the cheese mixture as well..  be sure to rinse well to avoid being too salty.  enjoy!

Everyone loves these.  Great with crab as well.  Freezes beautifully - just pull out of freezer and bake as needed.  I use about 1/2 of the butter called for.  The jars of "Old English" cheese work great.

O.K., I'm odd man out here.  I found Old
English cheese spread.  I think you can
get same results from diced Velveeta, a
splash of condensed milk and several 
handfuls of salt.  The super saltiness 
of the cheese spread is what turned me 
off.  I read the nutrient info and that
little bottle of salt spread contains
88% of daily sodium value. I place strict
limits on my salt intake, so I assume
previous reviewers are more sodium 
tolerant than I.  If you want to dress
up and shrimp, I urge you to try the 
Mexican Shrimp Coctail on this site.
WARNING : May be addictive.

This is a variation of an old recipe of my Mom's and a real crowd pleaser. My Mom's recipe calls for crab instead of shrimp.  As another reviewer mentioned it is imperative you use "Kraft Old English" cheese spread in the jar.  It is getting harder and harder to find these days.

These have been such a big hit everytime I've made them.  I also make them with crab meat in place of the shrimp.  The only complaint I get occasionally is that they are pretty salty, but that's what a lot of people love about them.  Regardless, they are so easy because the freeze so well.  I slice them into quarters with a pizza cutter prior to freezing and they can go straight from the freezer to the oven to the serving platter.

Like others reviews, it was awesome.  I added the shredded cheddar, cut 2tbsp less from the butter, and served it to my husband.  Ate it up quick!  Easy to make, and a NEW TIP...FREEZE IN THE BOX English Muffins come in which makes it nice and uniform and easy to pull out as you want them.

Reduced the number of servings so maybe the proportions were off but these were way too salty; I used regular shrimp instead of canned. The cheese sauce was just that soupy, cheese sauce and the toppings were falling off of the English muffin as I put the pieces on a plate. Will not make again.

Really different recipe.  I kept the muffins whole, but followed everything else exactly.  Though, it does seem like a lot of butter to use.  I will add chives and green onions next time like a reviewer suggested.

Yummy and good for a luncheon entree if you leave the English muffins whole. Be sure and rinse the shrimp as well as drain them for a fresher, less salty flavor.

When I was a teenager I had a friend whose mom would make these for us when we would sleep over.  I came to this sight looking for this recipe specifically. I used a name brand cheese spread when I made them and then tried a store brand.  They were much better with the name brand. Thanks for bringing back a great taste and great memories!

Very yummy!  I lightly toasted my english muffins before adding the shrimp mixture on top.  I also kept mine whole figuring I would make less of a mess that way.  Instead of processed cheese spread, I used Tilamok jalapeno cheddar spread.  Everyone loved the subtle kicked!

Whoa salty! I cut down on the butter by half, but it was so salty.  I would cut down on the salt by half or maybe all.  Otherwise, it was ok.

My mother made these the whole time I was growing up for holidays, so clearly this recipe has been around for generations.  I agree with everyone else, Olde English Cheese Spread is a MUST.  My mother never put season salt in hers either.  Drain and rinse the tiny shrimp, or use chopped cooked shrimp in any other size.  You can blend it in, or you can add them last and fold gently to keep in bigger pieces.  For an added kick, I like to add in a little chili powder and a few drops of lemon juice.  I just made these again tonight and I was wondering about the butter.  I think next time, I'll go with half and see if it still holds up the same.  Also, do not cut these until after you've baked them.  It's so much easier to spread the mix on the whole English Muffin.

Delicious with a few changes.  Didn't have old english so I used 5 oz of pub cheese and just a little less butter than suggested.  I thawed and dried with paper towels about 5 oz of frozen large cooked shrimped that I chopped up and added to all other ingredients.  I toasted the muffin halves first, spread them with the mixture, then cut each piece into quarters.  Really tasty and makes a bunch of yummy snacks.

AH MAZ ING!!!!  I had this several years ago and just made it with this recipe and it was soooo good.  Mine turned out bubbly and crunchy!  And I used Old English cheese spread.  I made some crab ones too, super good, easy, and creates a ton of bite size appetizers!

I added Old Bay Seasoning to mine. Might go half on the butter next time.

An old landlady I had gave me this recipe years ago and everyone loves it! My only difference is I use a small bag of cooked chopped bacon instead of the shrimp. The key to keeping them from getting soggy is to freeze them on a cookie sheet after cutting. They still only take about 4 minutes under the broiler. Yummy!
