Not only is this my new favorite salad dressing, it's good on faux turkey wraps on whole grain tortillas with fresh veggies. Creamy and light at the same time. Very fresh, clean taste.

This recipe wasn't bad.  I didn't have any fresh basil so I added some dry basil.  The basil ended up being too strong.  I think it might be good with another type of seasoning.  The basic dressing wasn't bad though.

I love this dressing! I did not have tamari so I used low sodium soy sauce and it was delicious.  My teen daughter even liked it as a raw veggie dip.  My only change would be to possibly pop it in the blender to to make it even smoother.

Not a huge fan of tofu so I wasn't really sure what to expect from this. It turned out really good. I think it needs more rice vinegar than the recipe calls for. Then again, as written it got too thin for my liking so I added some greek yogurt. This one would be a fun one to play around with using different herbs. The Goddess in the recipe title made me visualize more of a green goddess dressing but it is actually dominantly white. This one is definitely worth trying. I am not Vegan but enjoyed this.

This was just OK for me. Too bland, even with all the fresh basil. I added lime juice and garlic, which helped, but I won't be making it again. Probably would be better as a sandwich spread.
