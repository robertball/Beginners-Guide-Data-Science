I read the reviews for this soup and could hardly wait to make it, but upon making it, I found it medicore.  It was fine, but not wonderful.

Also a hint for the cook that found her beans were hard.  All beans must be cooked to the soft stage before adding any acid (tomato, vinegar, molasses).  Once the acidic food is added, the beans will no longer soften, no matter how long they are cooked.

Love love love it. So easy to make. I cheated and used 2 cans of black beans so I didn't have to go through the soaking process, and I forgot to get the can of tomatos, so I added a bit of ketchup for flavor. And since I used the canned beans, I added about a 1/4-1/2 cup water to get the right consistancy. To spice it up a little more, I added about 1 1/2 t of dry mustard and 1 t of backstrap molasses. Cooked for 3 hrs on HIGH. Turn out WONDERFUL. I will def be making this again, when in the chill mood. YUM YUM.

Seriously very good. I made it differently on the stove top, I really just wanted the recipe for the spices. I used 1 can of black, 1 can northern, 1 can pinto and I pureed an extra can of black beans. I sauteed the veggies first, then added the can of tomatoes, juice and all, and then the lentils. I added the beans and then like 3 cups of broth. I let that simmer and then I added the spices. It's simmering now and I will put the rice in soon. I can't stop sneaking tastes!! Make this one!!!

Finally, a soup worthy of my large crock pot!  I loved this.  Made the following changes: substituted 2 tbsp basil for the chili powder, added 1 tsp molasses, used 3/4 tsp garlic powder instead of fresh for convenience, only one green pepper, and no jalapeno.  Even pureeing half of it left a pretty chunky, very satisfying soup.  Makes a LOT!  Served with a dollop of sour cream.  Important note: RICE REQUIRED 2 HOURS OF COOKING!

This is probably the best black bean soup I have made on here. I definitely reccomend using veggie or chicken broth in place of water. I halved the recipe and it still made around 6 generous servings. However, in halving it, I still did 1 full carrot, 1 full (but not large) sweet onion, and 1 stalk of celery. I also did an extra tbsp. worth of red lentils because 1/8 cup hardly seemed worth it. The rice, I also kept at a 1/2 cup. It took a bit longer than 20 minutes to cook-- more like 35, really. I was out of cumin, so I used cilantro. Overall, this was delicious. I had no trouble with the beans softening up and I followed the directions listed.

I used the ingredients as listed and was pleased by the flavor.  I chose not to puree as I prefer it chunky.  This took me about 10  hours to cook, the rice definitely needs more than 20 minutes.  I think I will cut back on the black beans next time, there was a spoonful in ever scoop.  The soup reminds me a little of chili due to the flavor and texture.  I served this as a meal with homemade jalapeno cheese bread (corn bread with the leftovers).  This makes enough to feed an army!

This soup was quite tasty (I substituted 1 pt. of chicken stock in for 1 pt. of the water), but I thought it was quite fiddly and not good as a crockpot recipe.  The soaking and boiling of the beans ahead of time, adding the veggies partway through the cooking, all took away from the ease of throwing everything in the crockpot and leaving it all day.  I'd rather just cook everything on the stove and have it done quicker.  I will likely make the soup again, but will do it all on the stove.

One of the best black bean & rice soup recipes I've tried so far.  As has been stated before, the rice will need much longer than the 20 minutes stated.  I found it took almost 2 hours for the rice to fully cook.  So adjust accordingly.

This soup was yummy, easy to prepare, and lots for leftovers.  I almost didn't puree it like the directions said; glad I did as it gave a thickness to the soup that was nice.  My crockpot was not large enough to accomodate the volume this makes so I had to finish it off in a Dutch oven on the stove, which didn't hurt at all.  As we like our food pretty highly flavored, we had to add herbs at the table which brought it up to snuff for us.  We have no kids so couldn't rate that part.

I was really torn on how to rate this.  I followed the recipe exactly except for not using rice and I added a small amount of turkey ham.  I should have listened to one of the most helpful reviews that said something about if you add tomatoes/acid to beans before they are cooked,they won't get tender.  I had this on for almost 9 hours and the beans were still not soft enough.  The FLAVORS were good, and I will make this again, but I won't add the vinegar or the tomatoes until the end.  Made that way, I am sure this would be a hit.

very good!  It took an additional hour for my beans to get soft in the crockpot.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and added a can of diced chilis.

Okay folks, listen up.  I arrogantly added the tomatoes at the beginning even thought the actual recipe plus many, many reviewers said to add them at the end.  Well I have cooked the soup on low for 10 hours and on high for 3 hours and the beans ARE STILL HARD!  The flavor of the soup is amazing so I am very sad that after 13 hours I still have soup I can't eat.  I gave it 5 stars because I can tell that it would have been wonderful if I just followed the dang directions.  Next time I will!

I've never met a bowl of black bean soup I didn't love from Cuban style to Laurie Colwin's version.  It can be tasty with a few ingredients or many.  I usually make a simple version.  Beezie's version is ACE!  I plan to make it again for my Neigbourhood Lunch Social .  (It's a group of eight retired women who defy the long Canadian winter by meeting over a bowl of home-made soup at lunch time.)  Add an interesting bread, perhaps a hunk of cheese and fresh fruit and there's a 'souper magnifique'!

Wonderful recipe!  It is easily modified when cleaning out your refrigerator...be creative!  I added some leftover mexi-corn, a red pepper, and forgot the rice, but this recipe is so tasty no matter what!  I made extra and freezed it...it will be wonderful pureed into a sauce over cheese enchiladas.  I plan to make again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

Very good recipe!  I followed advice and used two carrots, two pieces of celery, one cup lentils and half water/half stock.  I also used canned black beans and rinsed them off insted of cooking them.   It took about 3.5 hours on high to cook the lentils/carrots/celery, but turned out yummy yummy!  I also used brown rice.

Excellent. I felt like it was more of a chili than a soup, though. I may try blending JUST the black beans after they're done cooking but prior to adding the other ingredients.  Just looking for a little more black bean flavor. So good, will make again!

overall flavor was great.  The black beans didn't get as soft as they should.  I would cook the beans completely before adding them to the crockpot next time.  It might be easier to cook the beans thoroughly the day before and then toss it all in the crockpot the next day and let it cook while I am at work to blend the flavors. Was wonderful with fresh cilantro,cheese and sourcream on top.

The first time I made this it was for a work potluck.  I got a ton of compliments.  I change a few things though.  I don't use either the jalapeno or the green peppers, I use less than half the salt, and for convenience I use dried, chopped onions.  If you use uncooked regular rice, the rice will take far longer than 20 minutes to cook.  20 minutes might be long enough for quick rice or you could use rice that had already been cooked.  I've heard that cooking the rice separately before adding it to a soup helps keep it from turning into mush.  Oh and I don't always bother to puree the soup.  It's great either way.

I wanted to give this 5 stars for flavor, but it was just such a hassle to make. Next time I'll either do the whole thing on the stove or maybe just toss it all in the crock pot on low all day and see how it goes. Anyway, I doubled the carrots, celery, and lentils, halved the onion, garlic, and cumin, and omitted the rice (it was a time issue). I added a bit of cilantro, and I squeezed a fresh lime into the pot at the end.  I served it with some sliced avocado.  I pureed most of the black beans in the blender towards the end of cooking, which helped their still-firm texture. I found that my beans needed a lot more cooking on the stovetop before they were ready for the crock pot, and even then they never got as soft as they should have.  With a little adapting, this soup was really tasty- but as I said, if I can't find a way to make it easier, I'll be going back to my good old standards. (hint: Black Bean and Salsa Soup from this site is absolutely amazing and far easier.)

This recipe got great reviews from everyone.  I made instant rice separate from the soup and added it to the soup when it was almost done.  Other than that, I stuck pretty close to the recipe.  It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked.    Four stars because it took too much work to make.

Absolutely the BEST black bean soup I have ever made.  I only made a few minor modifications based on what I had available.  Instead of putting the beans in the crockpot after cooking with water, I used vegetable stock.  When I added the vegetables (carrots, onions, 1 yellow pepper, 2 stalks celery, garlic, and a can of chopped green chiles) and lentils, I did NOT add the tomatoes or vinegar based on the advice of prior reviews.  I used chipotle chili powder and red pepper flakes in addition to the other seasonings.  For the last hour, I turned the heat back up to high and added brown rice, tomatoes (2 cans fire roasted tomatoes with garlic), and the red wine vinegar.  The result was a soup, but when I pureed half with a stick blender and added it back into the crockpot - well, WOW!  This made it so much better.  This was so good and had such depth of flavor, I don't think I have ever tasted a better soup anywhere.  This is my new favorite soup!

I'm pretty lazy, so I used 2 cans of black beans. I also made it on the stove and used 2 cups of chicken stock, 1/2 lb. scrambled hot turkey sausage, 1/2 onion and 1/2 pepper, no lentils. Lastly I added a T. plus a t. of molasses-- YUM!

I love this soup! Now I did make some changes- mainly bc I had a nice hambone leftover from Christmas. I cooked it on low with just the ham bone, black beans and chicken broth (3 tblsp of chicken base and water) for 3 hours. Then I added the rest of the ingredients and cooked for another 2 hours. The beans were perfect- no need to puree them at all.

This was really good. My boyfriend, who isn't a fan of soups or stews, liked this one.  My only variance from the recipe was to cook it on the stove, use 1/2 pinto and 1/2 black beans (all I had on hand), chicken and veggie stock instead of water, red pepper instead of green (the green gives me heartburn) and halved the cumin.  Oh, and I used more liquid because I wanted a soup instead of a thicker chili texture.  I'll definitely make this again.

While this soup is tasty, I only give it 3 stars because the rice DOES NOT cook in any 20 minutes. I followed other posters' advice and put the tomatoes and vinegar in after the beans had been in for 5 hours and the rice in for 2. After the rice had been cooking for 4.5 hours, I gave up and we ate it with crunchy rice. I don't know if the vinegar had some effect on the rice, but it did not cook. My recommendation would either be to leave the rice out (you don't really need it) or cook it on the stove and add it at the end. I also threw in a chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, which gave it a nice smoky flavor.

We used brown rice instead of white.  We also added a little bit of spinach for a twist.  If you use brown rice, cook on high for three hours.

This was a HUGE amount of food. We had tons left-over. I have really been into black bean soup lately, but this was not one of the best. It needed more pepper and a dash of hot sauce. I hate when I feel like I have to add quite a bit of hot sauce to make food taste good and that was the case with this recipe.

I made the mistake of starting this recipe only 8 hours before dinner.  End result: eating microwave dinners.  Unless one likes crunchy beans.
IF you choose to follow this recipe, do NOT follow the cooking instructions for the beans. Soak overnight, or use canned black beans. Unless you already know exactly how long your particular brand of dried black beans will take to cook without soaking.

Even my husband, a confirmed meat-and-potatoes guy, loved this.  I didn't include the lentils, only because I forgot to buy them, but it made no difference.  This was a good, hearty, healthy and satisfying meal.

Great recipe.  Easy to make.  I made it in half and it was enough for 4 adults for a meal.  Served with homemade corn tortilla chips.  I threw everything in the crockpot and it turned out great.

This is a WONDERFUL soup.  To save a bit of time I skip step 1 & 2.  I add 3 - 19 oz cans of rinsed black beans into the slow cooker along with 1.5 quarts water and all the other ingredients in the morning.  I add  the rice 30 minutes before serving for supper, puree with a hand blender and serve with a dollop of sour cream.  Just excellent!

Excellent Soup. Per other reviews and my own personal preferences I did make a few changes. I substituted basil for chili powder. Reduced cumin to one teaspoon. I doubled the carrots and celery, but halved the salt, green pepper and jalapeno pepper. I added an extra 14 ounce can of diced tomatoes. Since so many commented that the rice did not cook, I added it with the vegetables. I think minute rice would probably be done in the 20 minutes called for in the recipe. I also cooked the beans on the stovetop for the 3 hours and then transferred it to the crock pot and added everything else. Next time I would add everything on the stovetop and heat until boiling. Then I would transfer to the crockpot. I also think that next time I will eliminate the green pepper all together and add even more carrots and celery in its place. This is really a tasty recipe. I love it!!

This recipe is a keeper!  1) because I can use my crockpot, 2) I can start with dry beans.  The day before, I was cooking a pound of dry black beans in my crockpot, wondering what to do with them.  I found this recipe and low and behold, I had all the ingredients in my house!  This soup recipe has what many other recipes I’ve tried lacked: lentils, rice, tomatoes, jalapeno and lots of chili powder.  I halved the recipe for my 3 quart crockpot, and I started with mostly cooked black beans.  After that, it took about 2 hours on high.  I pureed half and then boiled off a little excess liquid.  I’m eating for lunch as I write this and it’s the best black bean soup I’ve had.  Crush some tortillas chips, add some sour cream or plain yogurt, and cilantro, Voila!  I’m going to dehydrate a couple servings for my upcoming camping trip too.  It seems to be the perfect consistency for dehydrating.

NOTE TO SCDEMERS:  you need to basically cook a pound of black beans BEFORE you begin the recipe.  Don't add dry beans to the pot with all the other ingredients.  Step 2 is describing the cooking of JUST the beans. 

There are 2 cooking phases #1 just the beans, and #2 the cooked beans and all other ingredients.

You should try it again!

Great flavor, but I wholeheartedly agree that the bean cooking instructions were WAY off.  I soaked my beans overnight, THEN boiled them for 30 minutes -- and they were still a tad underdone.  Make sure your beans are done to your liking first then move forward.

I thought this was the best vegetarian soup I've ever had. The only change I made was I had already cooked black beans and I put them in with a container of vegetable broth, but then followed the rest of the steps exactly. I used fresh tomatoes too (sept in oregon, you have to). The texture is great, the flavor was excellent, and I fed this to a group of meat eaters with a side of Irish Soda bread (easy to make in minutes, don't need yeast), and they all loved it.

This was good, but not what i was expecting, so slightly disapointed.  I will now equate this recipe with Vegetarian Chili.  In addition i had trouble with the beans softening, despite soaking overnight, and because i had to cook so long, the rice wasn't even visible anymore.  Good flavor overall, but would probably try a different recipe next time.

We enjoyed this soup but, as others mentioned, it's a lot like a chili. Perhaps next time I will cut back on the amount of chili powder and substitue other flavors... I think that will help it from tasting like chili. Otherwise, very good and healthy! We ate it with a dollup of sour cream and fresh cilantro.

Delicious and hearty soup.  I made a few changes.  I used brown rice instead of white and I pureed the whole soup and topped with parmesan cheese.   I think this is a great soup for a party, it can be made ahead and kept warm in the crock pot.

End result was excellent!

Now as for the beans. I followed the directions exactly. It took *WAY* longer than three hours for the beans to soften. I would double the time it takes for the beans. I also took about an hour for the rice to fully soften as well.

This is a staple in our family!! We freeze the leftovers for quick, easy meals. Just be sure the beans are soft before you add the acid ingredients. Otherwise, you'll have trouble getting them to soften up! (3.5 hours is perfect on my crock pot, but others might be different!)

This soup is amazing! I just had two bowls and I'm looking forward to making it again. 
Here are my suggestions: Buy ready to go black beans. Soaking them and then putting them in the crock pot really isn't worth the time and added effort. Instead of lentils I added a can of kidney beans (just had them in the pantry). I didn't add the .28oz of tomatoes because my crockpot is too small. So instead I added a bit of ketchup, mustard and syrup. I also only put 4 cloves of garlic since garlic likes me a little too much! I served with corn bread and a little sour cream on top. Yummy!

I looked at the tips before making this soup.  I boiled the beans on stove top for an hour and they were then soft.  I sauteed the other ingredients and then put the beans in and mixed everything together.  Did not seed the jalapeno pepper because I like spicy. I them dumped it all in the slow cooker and did not add salt until it was done.  Cooked rice seperately adding toasted sesame oil to the water.  Then added rice to the mixture and cooked last 20 mins.  EXCELLENT!

I didn't want to make veg. chilli and took other reviewers advice and didn't add any chilli powder...instead I replaced it with 2 tbls of basil.  Turned out delicious.  It did not resemble chilli, was very hearty and is a "keeper".

this is delicious, but it is more like a chili. i made it with cornbread and some turnip greens m/with mustard greens and it was good to go!!! i did add a little more salt, cumin, and chili powder, though.

The soup was good, but reminded me of a vegetarian chili more than a black bean soup.  I loved the spices!  Good for cold winter days.

I love my crock pot & black bean soup.. I loved this soup, it's delicious and so easy to make. I also like using fresh ingredients and not already prepared ingredients. It cuts down on sodium & fat. I just made one small change, I used brown rice instead of white and I put in the soup an hour before it was done. Thank you for a great recipe :)

Good recipe. I increased the amount of wine vinegar and did not add in the lentils. I sauted two large links of sliced andouille sausage which added a nice punch to the flavor. I served rice and sour cream on the side. Everyone loved it.

Delicious, hearty soup. Used veggie broth in place of water to up the flavor a bit.

Don't forget to put a slow cooker liner in - makes clean up time a lot shorter!

It was very good and it made a lot. I only used 1 16 ounce can of tomatoes. I do not like a lot of tomatoes and I felt that just 1 can was plenty.

I LOVE this recipe. I have made it at least 10 times, never the same twice! I use canned black beans, substituting the liquid from the cans for part of the water. This causes the soup to be thick and full of flavor. I have found that the end product is delicious served like a chili, on wheat noodles or rice, with cheese on top, and that it is delicious spicy or not spicy, using two green peppers or one hot pepper and one green. Thank you for submitting this delicious, healthy meal!

I had dry lentils,rice and black beans to use for dinner...and this was a perfect recipe! I only added what I had on hand (bell pepper, garlic, onion & tomatoes) and with the seasonings...it was delicious! Not a soup consistency...more chili/rice and beans. Very flavorful and great with cornbread!

I am not usually a tough critic and I hate this soup!  I followed the recipe exactly and the taste is just awful.  I don't like to waste food so I'm slowly getting through it by dumping in a pile of shredded cheese which makes it bearable. Clearly I would not make this ever again.

I really enjoyed this soup and so did my husband. It made a lot, too much for the two of us, so we froze half of it. We added cheddar and sour cream just before serving and loved it.

I adore this recipe!  It is filling, warm, and full of excellent flavors.  It is pretty spicy, so I like to tone it down with a dollop of sour cream and sometimes jack or cheddar cheese.

My husband and I dislike lentils so I double the amount of rice.

This soup also freezes well and keeps in the refridgerator for days.  If you don't plan on using it all the first sitting, however, I suggest cooking the rice separately and adding it when you reheat the soup so it doesn't get soggy.  It's a bit of extra effort but well worth it for the quality leftovers.

this was a hit with my whole family. I used a lot of the other suggestions, which I think really helped. I soaked the beans overnight and then cooked them separetely. They were done before I even put them in the crockpot. Left out the celery and the rice, used white instead of red onion, chipotle powder instead of jalapenos, doubled the lentils and threw in some chopped spinach at the end. Will definately make again - thanks!

I omitted the jalapenos b/c I do not like them and I omitted bell pepper becuase I do not have it.  I also reduced the beans - again what I had.  A lot of flavor - probably less so with the right amount of beans.  I also used brown rice.  Will make again.

This recipe was terrible!  Cooking time is way off, flavour is lacking in originality.  This soup is nothing more than watery vegetarian chilli.  Definitly will not do again.

I have made this soup many times, and since it is one of our favorites I can't believe that I haven't yet rated this recipe the 5 stars that it definitely deserves. Sometimes I add chicken or smoked sausage, or substitute rice for the lentils...no matter what, this recipe turns out great. Thank you, Beezie, my family really enjoys this!!

This recipe is OK... nothing spectacular.  It's pretty spicy and lacks flavor.  Next time I would use one jalapeno.  I even made this with vegetable broth to attempt to give the flavor some more depth, but it didn't seem to help very much.  I added some olive oil to it and also some other spices.  I think sauteing the onions and garlic in olive oil before adding them to the pot would help with the flavor.

This was excellent. I didn't know how much I'd like black beans, mostly because I've never really eaten them much. We always used white beans where I grew up. This was suprisingly good and I'd certainly make it again!

I messed this one up royally. My beans never got soft. I should have soaked them over night like the package said. This was the major problem. The second problem was that when I scalled the recipe to 5 servings, the directions did not scale down the amount of water in step number 2!! This may be a good recipe, if you can figure out how to make it. The author should definitely revise the directions to soak the beans over night. And allrecipes should edit step number 2 so that it scales properly.

Blending the soup as instructed calms the Southwestern flavors.  My favorite black bean soup that won't taste like vegetarian chili if you blend it.

I didn't like this recipe at all - there was too much cumin in it!  And while at first having this huge mix of vegetables, rice and beans sounded good - it was too much!  Many different ingredients and yet still bland.

Excellent recipe with rich flavors. It's become a staple. I don't opt often for the
rice (or lentils) but doesn't really matter, though protein is enhanced with them. 
I've found that tomatoes provide the missing ingredient for bean soup recipes,
 and with the proper spices, meatless bean soup is terrific. This one is a winner.

This is an amazing soup. Very Filling, and tastes wonderful. I skipped the rice and the legumes, but it still tastes great. Infact, I tried it with the chilli and without chilli, I personally felt it tasted better without.

I made this yesterday.  After reading the reviews, I made some adjustments and did it on the stove instead of the crock pot.  I sauted the veggies, increased the spices by about half, used chicken broth for about half the water, threw in some leftover Christmas ham, and used serranos instead of jalapenos because that's what I had.  We really liked it; my husband is usually critical of new recipes, but told me this one was a keeper.  Paired it up with some cheese/serrano cornbread and made a great meal.  It was very spicy (hot) but we like that here.

I thought the recipes needed a bit more spice. By substituting 1 habanero and 1 dried chipotle pepper in place of the fresh jalepenos, I found that I could get the amount of spice I enjoyed. Overall though, this recipe is easy and delicious. I use the leftovers in place of a side of refried beans in other mexican inspired dishes. The recipe is cheap and easy to make. Thanks!

After looking for a veggie-heavy crockpot dish on here, I was really excited to try this one out.  I must say it did not disappoint!  Very good all around healthy recipe.  As recommended by several reviewers, I used chicken broth instead of water (16oz.) and basil instead of cumin; I thought the cumin would be too strong.  I also may have used more rice than recommended because it came out more like a jambalaya than a "soup", per se, but I am happy with the texture.  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I feel like the flavors kind of blend together too much and a lot of the individual character is lost.  Still, I will make this again as long as my fiancee enjoys it!

Easy and good! Next time I will use 1/2 the amount of black beans. I didn't puree 1/2 of the beans but added extra rice (I used wild rice). This made the soup very, very thick which I like. This is a definite keeper.

This soup was great. I didn't have any black beans, so I used small red beans. It was still wonderful, and the kids liked it! I added a few extra spices and more carrots and celery than it called for. Perfect!

Very nice main-dish soup - however, as mentioned above, the cooking time has to be REALLY extended to cook the rice. In fact, if you dislike crunchy rice, I' reccomend cooking the rice a bit first. Also, two T chili powder is WAY too much. I'd just add a dash and supplement with basil. I served mine with a dollop of yogurt, chedder cheese, and tortilla chips. On the whole, though, a very filling and tasy dish.

Thanks for the great idea... this was an awesome starting point for a soup I made today. (I'm doing South Beach, which is the reason I omitted some things.) I made this on the stovetop in about 45 minutes. I used 3 cans black beans and 2 cups veggie stock instead of water. I omitted carrot, lentils, chili powder, and rice. I added basil and 3 chipotles en adobo (with about 1 tbsp sauce from can). The smoky flavor was a perfect addition. I pureed half and left the other half chunky. Will make this again someday! (Makes a lot for just two of us.)

I must have done somthing wrong. I cooked it much longer than was recommended and the beans were not cooked. I brought the soup to a work potluck and had to throw it out because the beans were still hard. Help! I would love to try it again because I loved the flavor. Did anyone else have this problem???

This is a great black bean soup!  I have tried many; black bean are a family favorite. This is certainly one of the best.  I did follow the advice to use less cumin (I used 1/2 tsp rather than the 2 tsp the recipe calls for.)and I added beef boullion with the water. We like the chilli powder and left it in.  I used fresh jalepenos and this soup had quite a bit of "zip".  The night after I made it, I sauteed up some chourico sausage and added it to the soup.  Don't know if it was the sausage, but the soup was even better the following day.  I will certainly make this soup again.

This soup is very hearty and good, but we didn't love it.  I didn't have time to slow cook the soup and made it on the stovetop in about 3 hrs. (I also added a little more water) so perhaps that is why it didn't taste quite as good to us.  I cut back on the chili powder, as others have recommended, and added fresh cilantro at the end.  The soup did taste much better the second day, however, and I would then give it 4 stars.

I have this soup on the back burner now.  Flavour city!  It still has the last 2 - 3 hours to simmer but the broth has a flavour explosion!  I did not have jalapeno peppers on hand so I used 1/8th of a teaspoon of cayenne pepper.  Also, I only had white wine vinegar on hand and used that instead of the red.  This soup so far is fantastic and will compliment our supper tonight wonderfully!  Thank you!

I simplified this a bit using a large can of black beans (28 oz) and a 14 oz can of tomatoes. I first cut all the vegetables using 3 stalks of celery, 3 small carrots, 2 peppers, 1 large onion and 3 serrano, 1 habenero pepper. I dumped them into the crock and then added the canned beans (liquid included) tomatoes and enough veggie broth to bring the water level to about 2 inches below the lip of the crock pot.  I added all the spices listed increasing the quantities to taste. I also added some garlic salt and Season All. Cooked everything on high for 4 hours, touched up the spices and topped w/avocado and yogurt.  This was extremely flavorful and hearty.  I served it with grilled bread and simple onion, tomato, cucumber salad w/lemon olive oil.  My carnivorous bf loved it and requested we serve the leftovers over rice tomorrow.

Gritty and too much flavor profile going on here.  I gave it an extra star because I used canned beans instead of dry, so maybe that makes the difference?

This was quite a nice soup. My family likes it spicier so I doubled the spices. Combining the rice, beans, and lentils makes it a very nutritious soup. I like to saute the vegetables ahead, which makes it more caloric, but I made it the way it was written and it was good.

This turned out yummy. I didn't have a few of the things in the recipe so I skipped them but I had most so I'm rating it now. I will definately use this one again. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

instead of using 1 pound of black beans- i used a mix of black beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly. I would say this is more like thick chili than a soup, but it is amazing anyways.

If using Basmati white rice, you might want to use less than what the recipe calls for. Mine turned out as moist rice and beans rather than a soup. Also, I had to add extra spices and grate some cheddar cheese on top because I didn't find the recipe to be very flavorful on its own.

Flavorful and healthy with almost no bad stuff (see nutritional info).  Made lots and lots of leftovers which we shared and our family loved.  Next time I will be adding more spices, maybe another jalapeno.

This was a lovely, filling soup. I added extra garlic and spices, which is more to our tastes.  I also used red peppers, and extra beans.  Perfect with buttered sourdough bread or cornbread.

We've gotten hooked on this and make it all the time.  Great spicing!
Only quibble: I've found that cooking for about 8 hours (overnight) is required to make the beans tender.

Great, easy to make, good hearty fall meal. I did soak beans overnight like others did. I also used half the amount of beans and it still made a ton, at least 6 good size servings. Also added a little masa harina at the end to thicken it up, which made it more of a chili-like texture.

I thought this soup was delicious, but my husband didn't like it at all, he said it had a gritty texture to it.  It took much longer than suggested to cook, I set mine for 5 hours on low.

Delicious soup, and easy to prepare.  I added some diced ham when I added the vegetables.  I found that the rice needed more than 20 minutes to cook though.  I will probably reduce the jalepeno a little next time as it was a little too much for my son, although we loved it as is!  Very yummy.

This was really yummy.  I added some frozen corn and an extra can of tomatoes and the juice of one lime.  I served it with cornbread and it was de-lish!  I had trouble with the beans popping open when I soaked them so I just blended those and added some canned beans unblended.  Next time i will not soak them and see if that helps.

This is a keeper.  My process:
I made the beans in a pressure cooker (3 cups raw for 35 minutes).  Meanwhile, I prepared all of the veggies, opened the can of tomates and added the dry seasonings to the bowl with the rice and lentils, the red wine vinegar to the canned tomatoes.  When the beans were done added everything at once and cooked for about a 1/2 hour.
Modifications:  2 carrots, 3 stalks of celery, no jalepeno peppers but added some crushed red pepper.  About 1 t. salt.  VERY GOOD, quick and easy!  Thanks!

My first black bean soup to try on this site and it turned out well! I only put in one bell pepper, didn't have any lentils, put in 30oz of tomatoes and used brown rice instead of the white which I mixed in at the beginning per other reviews. Did not puree any of it as I like a chunky chili texture rather than a soup.

Somewhat boring. Hubby disliked it. Also was a hassle to do the soaking/cooking prep, which is not a good recipe for those who just like to stick things in their crockpots and leave it.

Wonderful, hearty soup.  We like spicy soups so I left the chili powder in, but only 1 tsp cumin.  Used 2 cans chicken broth for some of the water.  Only used 1 bell pepper as well.  Will make this again - Thank you Beezie!

This is an excellent recipe!  The only thing that I did differently was to substitute 1 quart of organic vegetable broth for some of the water.  It was devoured immediately and had rave reviews by all when I took the crock pot full of soup to work!

Very good recipe! Two things take this from 4 to 5 stars for myself and my husband: first, use an instant pot if you have one. Throw everything in, 35 min on high pressure and both the beans and the rice come out deliciously soft and ready to eat!  Second, I added some chicken stock in place of some of the water, and last time I made this specific recipe I blended it with an older one that called for salsa. I have to say, I think a few tablespoons of high quality salsa (we love garden fresh gourmet) really takes this and brightens up all the flavors and makes it absolutely top notch. This has definitely set a new high bar for black bean recipes in my household!

Spicy, filling, low fat, veg- friendly.  My tummy is very happy right now.  I had to cook it longer, and used brown rice instead of white. I put the rice in at  the same time as vegetables.  And I tried it with mushrooms, also. Very tasty!  I skipped the last step (puree 1/2), it's unnecessary in my opinion.

I doubled all the spices except the salt and black pepper and cooked on low for 8 hours, and served it with sour cream on the side. 
My guests included gluten free and dairy free, and everyone really like it.  I had almost no leftovers.
Leftovers freeze well and reheat in the microwave.

We used two cans of black beans instead of dry black beans and added an extra jalapeño because we had no other plans for the extra one in the package. 

Even as someone who likes spicy food, this recipe would've been more than spicy enough without the extra pepper. Next time I'll just find another use for the third jalapeño. 

Fantastic soup with lots of texture and flavor, we had enough for the two of us to eat it for a couple of days.

WOW -- yum!!  I made this exactly as described with the exception of the canned tomatoes which I didn't have so substituted a 17 oz. jar of cherry tomatoes that I quartered. As other reviewers mentioned, it took longer to cook after adding the rice, but I was prepared for that. It turned out perfect and I froze a couple of jars full for a rainy day. Definitely a keeper!

Lentils and rice were uncooked. This needs a few more hours on high, not low.

I've read a few of the reviews and well I didn't know much about raw black beans either...but I remember my mom always cooking beans and letting them sit in water overnight. So as I realize this I'm scooping all the veggies back out into a container and will resume the next day. Today came and I made it as directed but added a few other sweet peppers and some more seasoning to fancy our taste buds. So my recommendation to others for the recipe. Make sure you taste it as you go so it fits your taste. However I'm glad it was here because I enjoyed making it for my family :-)

I changed this a bit - omitted vinegar, jalapenos and chili powder. Added basil and two bay leaves. I used canned black beans as well and rinsed them carefully before using. Also rinsed the tomatoes thoroughly. I made it in a regular large pot as well and put a couple of pinches of crushed red pepper in it for a little bit of a kick. Served it with sourdough baguette. DELICIOUS!

I love the flavor of this soup, but it's kind of fussy to get started.  Soak the beans and then cook them in the crock pot--lots of steps.  When I make it, I don't puree any of  the soup, just serve as is.  Last time I brought it to a potluck, it disappeared!

My roommate said the soup was hearty and savory, perfect for a winter night. She was utterly satisfied by it.

Yum :)  I left out the lentils and toned down on the garlic (which is a first...ha), but I think I followed otherwise as written.  A good base recipe!

A great soup, I especially liked the mixture of spices used. I didn't puree any of it, and I added shell macaroni instead of rice.  I would make this for company.
