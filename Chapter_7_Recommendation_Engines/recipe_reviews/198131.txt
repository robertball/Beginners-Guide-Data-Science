Very tasty and quick to make.  I made a batch with the popcorn but the popcorn gets a little stale so I substituted a cup of mixed nuts, 1 cup Cherrios and 2 cups pretzels.

I doubled the recipe since after popping the microwave popcorn, I saw it made about 8 cups.  This recipe was really good and we will be making it again. It went over really well at a get together this past weekend. The chocolate chex are amazing!

This is a nice change from traditional chex mix, or even the other savory ones I've had.  I went to the store and found the Chocolate Chex, but not the Cinnamon, so I just used all Chocolate.  It is very good - not too sweet with a nice cinnamon taste.

WARNING!! Highly addictive food item. =) I made exactly as written. Turned out to be a great snack to munch on - everyone really enjoyed it! The flavors really did remind us all of the scrumptious snickerdoodle cookie! This would be a fun recipe to make to give out to some coworkers as a small homemade holiday gift... especially since I still have LOTS of cereal left =)

The first time I made this it was way too sweet. I used the same amount of sugar but doubled the amount of cereal and popcorn. I also increased the margarine by a couple of tablespoons. Overall this recipe was a big hit. My husband tried to hide it from the children!

This was so easy to throw together. I was able to use it as lunch snacks for a couple weeks. If I compared this to purchasing pre-made snacks I saved a few bucks and the taste was great. I think next time I may add more of the chocolate since it was a bit overpowered.

Quite tasty and easy to make. Satisfies the sweet tooth. Great to have alongside regular Chex mix to get the sweet/salty dichotomy. I added 1 cup M&M candy and 2 cups Teddy Grahams (cinnamon flavor) and used kettle corn. A hit at my holiday party!
