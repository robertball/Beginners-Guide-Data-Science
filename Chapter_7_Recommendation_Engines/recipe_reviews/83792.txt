I made these for dinner once again an they were a hit! I advise you NOT to leave out the 5 spice powder...it's the ingredient that really "makes" this recipe. 5 spice powder has a distinct flavor and usually contains equal parts of cinnamon, anise, ginger, cloves, and fennel. I made a few alterations that you may find helpful:marinade the chops for at least 3 hours or better yet overnight,use a strainer to evenly coat the pork chops with cornstarch, use medium or thin cut chops (as thick chops take longer to cook and may dry out)and , use less oil to fry them. Our family enjoyed these porkchops and I look forward to making them again. Thanks for sharing.

These chops turned out fantastic. I made a few changes to the original. I made it for two pork chops. I increased the 5 spice to about 1 1/2 tsp. and I used about a 1/4 cup of white wine. Cooking, I used a tblsp. of margarine and a little olive oil. Did a high heat sear about 1 min. each side. I then reduced heat to med., covered and cooked 5 min. each side. They were tender and juicy and really flavorful. I served with white rice and spicy Bok Choy which made a spicy kick to the fragrant meat. I will definitely be making this again.

This dish was a huge hit with the hubby. The trick to this dish is 1)Use thin sliced pork chops, 2) make little slits on both sides, and 3) marinate for at least 3-4 hours. I didn't use as much oil for frying as they suggested, but it still turned out fine. Very flavorful!!! Will make again!

A great, authentic recipe that is delicious even with estimated proportions + common sense (the way I like it).  It reminds me of my beloved Taiwanese childhood.  DO NOT OMIT THE 5-SPICE: it "makes" this classic dish.  The sweet potato starch instead of cornstarch is a wonderful addition to make this all-the-way authentic.  If you can, serve with pickled cabbage and an egg hard-boiled in soy sauce and anise.  I'd also recommend using VERY thin-cut bone-in pork chops if you can find them-- it makes a big difference.

When I was a child, my family moved to Taipei for a few years. The school I went to served these pork chops for lunch every Thursday, and to this day I can still remember how delicious they were. It's taken me 20 years to find a recipe, but this is the real deal. Just like  I remember.

Very easy to make and tasty.  I cooked them using a non-stick cooking spray, not oil, so I could save calories.

Excellent recipe for pork chops. I am Taiwanese and this tastes like pork chops that my mom would cook (I can't ever get a recipe from her because she never measures anything). Thanks for the share!

These turned out great..Thanks for the recipe.. By the way... Why would anyone over/under rate something they haven't even tried?? You're not helping anyone..an unknown opinion is worthless.. If you have something good/bad to say, rate it AFTER trying...

This was great! I followed the recipe, adding a little white pepper to the marinade. I served with white rice and stir fried baby bok choy. My boyfriend and I loved it!

Yummy!  It smelled soooo good while it was cooking and the hubby knew it exactly what it was.  We have only had them out at the Chinese diners.  I don't know why my breading was falling off while cooking though...  If it stayed on, I would have given it five stars.  Maybe it was a chef error?  Anyone that can give me insight on this I would really appreciate it!

I'll give this 4 stars. I live in Taiwan and this is ALMOST correct. In Taiwan it is hard to find white wine. Instead, and more commonly used is cooking rice wine (not Sake). I have also added crushed garlic cloves to the marinate (is you like garlic).

I can't believe how great these pork chops tasted given the small amount of ingredients needed.  I agreed with the reviewer that the trick is to use "thin-sliced" pork chops and to use Tapioca (sweet potato) starch.  The only modification I would make is to use 1.5 tablespoon of sugar instead of the 1 tablespoon listed and that's just because I like it to have a sweeter taste and also, marinate it for at least 4 hours or more.  I also seasoned the tapioca starch with some salt, pepper and chili pepper to give it a kick. :)

Excellent recipe! The five spice adds a new dimension to the overall flavour. To give it a slight Japanese feel I added fresh grated ginger (equal to the garlic) to the marinade. Well done on a great recipe.

I used boneless pork chops. I increased the wine to 2 tbs.  These were so good that last night I made it with boneless chicken breast cut into  nuggets and toss in baggie with corn starch..then browned.  Fantastic.  Double the marinade and while meat is resting bring to boil and reduce and use as sauce.

Absolutely fantastic!! Only three minor changes -- I marinated overnight, didn't use cornstarch, and I baked them instead of frying them.  Excellent!! The aroma was of an asian restaurant!

Very delicious! In addition: I pounded the pork chops to tenderize them and flatten them out (by rapid chopping them with the blunt edge of my knife) just like my grandma does :) Also, there's no need to add that much oil for the frying

My husband wanted me to give it a zero (he didn't like the smell or taste of the five-spice powder).  My daughter thought it was OK, but she did use A-1 Sauce.  I just took a bite and also thought it was OK.  We love Oriental food, but I won't make this one again.

These were so easy and tasty. Only thing I did different was used honey instead of sugar.  Had a little trouble with the crust sticking but think I can do better next time.  I cut the chops in strips and served with sticky rice much like I would get in Thailand.  Even though these are called Taiwanese Pork Chops they do a version of these all over SE Asia.

This is a simple marinade and the taste was GREAT.  I did not have the Chinese five-spice on hand so I mixed it with the following:  1/4 t. each anise seed crushed (or powder if you have it), ground cloves, cinnamon, ginger.  This worked very well and used boneless pork chops instead.  Husband LOVED it!

My husband lived in Taiwan for two years and he said these pork chops are really close to how they eat them there.  Next time I make them I am going to use more five spice and make more of a breading for them.  We will be making this recipe agian!!!!

Nice flavor, we enjoyed these.   I made the sauce  and poured it over the chops (no cornstarch) in my slowcooker.  Very tasty with jasmine rice and green beans also sprinkled with Chinese five-spice powder.

My husband and I LOVED these pork chops!  The only change I made was to use white grape juice instead of the wine, as we don't drink (and I wasn't going to buy a whole bottle for 1/2 Tbsp!).  The first time we made the chops, we ended up letting them marinade for about 2 days... (oops!) But WOW, were they good!  I recommend overnight—more time for the meat to suck up the flavor!  I also tried the marinade on a couple large chicken breasts I pounded thin and cut in half.  Delicious!

Very quick, easy & delicious!!  Great recipe for 'thin' cut chops which are more economical than thick chops.  I used Light Soy sauce, increased wine to 1/4 cup & increase Chinese five-spice to 1-1/2 TBL as others suggested.  Everyone loved them and I will be making them again tonight for my hubby & me. I served with Jamine rice & sauteed baby Bok Choy.  If there is leftover sauce in pan, I may pour that over the rice.

Excellent!  This is a very simple recipe and the flavor is great.  I made this as written except I didn't have any white wine so I just used water.  It is such a small amount it didn't matter.  I also used thin, 1/2" sliced pork steak and marinated for 4  hours. I loved the oriental flavor and how moist they were.  It was so easy I know I will use it very often and share the recipe with my friends.

Fantastic! My fiancé suggested adding a little hot sauce to the marinade, as he likes things with a little kick. Great change up for pork chops!

My rating scale (cause number of stars is subjective): 1-Didn't like it, 2-It's okay, 3-Liked it, 4-Loved it, 5-Can't get enough of it.

This was fantastic. Didn't need to modify the ingredients (other than using boneless pork tenderloin). I highly recommend this with rice and sauteed veggies!

I was a bit skeptical about the chinese five spice because I don't care for anise, but these were really tasty!  My husband loved them.  I used boneless chops because that's what I had, and then I used about half the amount of oil to cook them in.  Great, slightly different recipe!

this is a great recipe. i substituted white wine with 1 tablespoon of sherry wine. i dont have the 5-spice powder so i used 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 2 whole star aniseseed, and 1 teaspoon grated root ginger. i broke off the leaves of the aniseed and let it marinate in the sauce for a few minutes to get some anise flavor out.  in addition to the 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, i added 1 tablespoon of  teriyaki sauce for some sweetness. i used only 1/2 teaspoon of sugar and it was more than enough. some reviews said cornstarch makes the pan sticky so i used 1/2 cup cornstarch and 1/2 cup all purpose flour. it didnt turn out as crunchy as i like but even when i order this in restaurants it's not crunchy either. maybe next time ill use just flour.  my boyfriend who is taiwanese loved it!

Delicious! I had to substitute cider vinegar for the white wine because that's what I had. I marinated them for 24 hours and then cooked them on the BBQ. They were amazing! The Chinese 5 Spice really gave them a great flavour.

These are amazing! This is my new fave pork chop recipe. I had picked up a jar of the 5 spice and it had been sitting in the pantry for a year. I finally saw a recipe that called for it. Now I can't believe I tried this spice sooner. This recipe was a hit twice so far with my fiance, made it just as described. The second time I was only able to marinate it for 20 minutes and it still turned out amazing. I also prefer to use flour instead of the cornstarch, it still comes out crispy but to me the flour didn't stick to the bottom like the cornstarch did. You won't regret this one!

This is an outstanding recipe!  My husband and I LOVE this meal, together with bok choy in spicy garlic sauce from this site.  The flavors are outstanding and the pork is tender and delicious.  The only variation I made was to brine the pork first; then I followed the rest of the instructions exactly.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would!  You can get Chinese 5-Spice Powder at an Asian grocery (we're lucky to have 3 close to our house); you can also find recipes for it on the web.

Great flavor. We doubled the marinate completely, except we used 2 tsp of Chinese five spice powder.  It is the five spice powder that really makes this. I'm not big on frying pork, but will sacrifice for this.

This was fantastic. I marinated overnight and used potato starch for the coating, as others have suggested. My wife said this was one of the best recipes I've made, and I've been doing the cooking for 27 years.

Nice marinade. Very flavorful and a good change from the recipe I usually use.   I'm going to try it again using boneless chicken or thin steaks.

This was ok, it smelt great while cooking and looked great but the flavours were too strong and over powering for my taste. I prefer other ingredients to compliment the taste of pork but with this I couldnt really tell that I was eating pork.

Excellent! They came out so juicy and tender. I didn't put them in the marinade til I got home from work, so only marinated them for about 10 minutes and they still came out wonderful!

awesome! it tastes almost as good as the restaurant. there were a few changes that i'll be doing next time though. i only marinaded for an hour but found it to be a little salty to my liking. Next time, ill be upping the sugar to probably 1.5, as well as the five-spice. i didn't have white wine so i left it out but it still tasted great. as for the cornstarch, i definitely will be coating it a little more next time because it wasn't covered as much as i'd like. great recipe!

These are very good. The best advice I can give is to find a good quality five spice blend. They do vary in flavor. Your best bet is to purchase at an Asian Market. I had to try several before I found my winner. Five spice is now a staple in my pantry and goes fantastic with duck as well.

I used this recipe to pre-cook the pork for a stir fry. After frying, I chilled it overnight and then cut it into strips for the stir fry. I also tried it using seitan for a vegetarian version. Also very good.

I accidentally grabbed the terriyaki sauce instead of the soy sauce and used chicken instead of soy, but I kept everything else the same, and it was really good.  I liked it so much I made extra sauce and put it on some brown rice as a side dish.  Everyone really liked it.  Thanks for sharing

For the record, given the one comment, tapioca starch is NOT sweet potato starch. The latter is commonly used in asian cooking but it is not tapioca. For those who want more specifics, see:http://www.foodsubs.com/ThickenStarch.html. The recipe was great as is cooking to the right internal temperature. Moist and succulent!

This was really good.  I love to eat pork chops with rice when I go to Taiwan, and this definitely brings back those same flavors I love to eat.  Thanks so much for sharing.  It's usually really difficult to find a good Taiwanese recipe in English.

This was good.  I did a few things different.  I didn't have any white wine on hand so I just used vinegar.  I also didn't have a large enough bag so I put the marinade in a large glass pan and doubled the recipe because I had 8 thin sliced pork chops.  I added 1TBS of vegetable oil so the marinade wasn't so thick.  The pork chops alone were fairly salty, but not over powering.  I made fried rice as a side and chopped up the porkchops and mixed it into the rice, it was great.

Although I thought these were pretty good I dont think Id make em again. Something was really overpowering. Maybe it was the 5 spice powder. I never used it before. That couldve been it. 4 stars for simplicity and taste.

I marinated 6+ hours with a vacuum sealer marinator which is supposed to marinate much faster.  These were great but nxt time I will definitely marinate longer. My biggest issue was the cornstarch breading fell off as I fried it. Not sure why. The areas which retained the cornstarch were delicious. I also threw in some onions while marinating and threw them in a separate skillet and served on top. They were delicious too. Served with Asian inspired sambal oelek broccoli. Really yummy Just which more of the corn starch stayed on.  . Next time I will probably cut the pork chops in smaller pieces and fry. That way more of the cornstarch breading will stay in place. Delicios and I will definitely make it again.

Delicious recipe!  Really reminds me of mom's cooking.  My hubby was very impressed!

I made a few adjustments:
- marinated over night
- grated the garlic using microplane to get maximum flavor
- used Shiao Shing wine 
- used raw cane sugar instead of white sugar
- wiped off the marinated before dredging in corn starch.  dusted off excess corn starch so only a thin layered stays on.  
- used a quarter of oil (avocado oil + a tablespoon of butter) 
- cooked it 2 minutes per side only.  flipping once!

nom nom nom!

I’ve made these several times and they are always a hit. I used fresh garlic instead of powdered and I buy really thin pork chops so they fry up quick. Serve this with white rice and a veggie on the side and it’s amazing.

Bland. I marinated this for about 2 hours.  Also, the breading just wasn't good - it got too dark in place and mushy in others.  Meh. Good thing is, it's bland enough that I can scrape off the crust and use the meat for something else.

Delicious! Next time I'll opt for using thinner chops and maybe leave out the cornstarch since I find it might not make a difference to the recipe.

Outstanding! The flavors in this recipe are dynamite: thanks to another helpful reviewer, Chinese 5-spice is a must in this recipe and makes it. Those five are equal parts of cinnamon, anise, ground cloves, fennel seeds, ground ginger.

The flavor was great. I had to use boneless chops because that is all I had on hand, but followed the recipe to a T otherwise. Because these were not bone-in, and the chops I had were on the thick side, these were not as juicy as they would have been if I had used the chops called for in the recipe. I will definitely make these again using the right chops!

These just didn't do it for me. I really wanted to like these because I love pork and five spice. The cornstarch was just weird and the color was unappetizing. Aside from that the flavor was overpowering. Would not make again or reccommend.

Interesting and delightful. I made the Five Spice Powder from a recipe found elsewhere. If it's your first time using Five Spice, you may want to cut back a bit. I liked it, but it's a bit different.  I halved this recipe for two chops, but used only enough canola oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Five minutes on each side until nicely browned, then put it into the oven 2-3 minutes longer to finish.

The pork chops came out perfect!  Just like I remembered them when I lived in Taipei a couple of years back.  The taste is authentic!  I will make this over and over again!

This was ok. They were very tender, the sauce was just ok though. I don't like black jelly beans and this sort of reminded me of it. Everyone else except my youngest son liked it. Probably won't make again.

It smelled great but tasted bland. I also think my chops were too thick or possibly my oil was too hot either way they didn't cook evenly. Not the recipies fault I know, but it isn't something I will be making again.

This was just ok for us.  I made two chops with the breading and two without it.  We preferred the chops without the breading - as others suggested I did marinade it for 3 hours.
