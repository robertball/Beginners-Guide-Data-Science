thank you for the recipe, the cake was wonderful, it was moist and light. I admit I made a few small changes like I put in the sugar half white half brown and I mixed the spices myself. But I strongly recommend this to everyone!

These were very tasty cupcakes. I was hoping they would be a little lighter and less dense. My first pan ended up a bit under-done in the center, even though the toothpick came out clean, so I left the second pan in for about 27 minutes (better). The cinnamon cream cheese frosting is delicious!

This review is for the frosting only. Very good as written. Did not change a thing and it was very yummy. Will use again.

Made exactly as written and they are super moist and great spice ratio. They don't need oil to make them moist as some reviewers suggested and they don't need extra spice

I love it! After I took them out they started to fall, but they are still yummy. They are very moist and I could taste the pumpkin very well. Overall they were pretty good.

This recipe is AMAZING! I love it so much! I didn't have pumpkin pie spice so I just put in a little bit more cinnamon than called for.

This did not turn out well at all. I followed the recipe exactly and my cupcakes came out gummy. The flavor was good but the texture was so off that I didn't want to serve them. The icing was good though.

SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. Great pumpkin cake and the most incredible cream cheese frosting. I didn't change the frosting or the cake recipe - recipe is already perfect. Will definitely be making this for Thanksgiving and all other fall holidays for many many many years!!!

The frosting is overkill.  
I think the cake would be better with just a little powdered sugar.  The frosting would be good on chocolate cake.

cake review: cook time.
I am in the middle of miking the cupcakes and so I needed to check to see if anyone else was having the same issues i am having? Total time recommended bake time seems very off. total that have cooked for about 35 mins. I've checked frequently and the center was still very raw. I'm letting them cool for 10 mins as recommended before i transfer to the cooling rack.

They taste amazing!

They came out incredibly dense and underdone in the center. When I left them in longer the centers were still underdone or gooey and the outsides were drying out. The icing was delicious and sweer. The flavor for the cake is there as well, but the density and texture makes it not worth the time and effort.

These are so freakin' awesome!!!  They just melted in my mouth and the icing is to die for!!!!  The husband & kids tore them up!  Made a batch for a dessert bake-off at work, now I'm going to make the next 24 for just us!!!!  My husband and boys do not like the icing to be spread thick, so I used just half the recipe and it was perfect for us.

The icing is amazing. The perfect amount of cheese and sweetness the icing is light and the hint of cinnamon is delicious. The cake however, was not what I was hoping for. The cake was moist but very dense.
