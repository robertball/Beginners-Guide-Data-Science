I approached this recipe with trepidation. I had fresh fennel and was looking for a recipe and we like liver (I fear we may be in the minority here). It seemed like such an unusual mix of ingredients I had to try it. There was pizza in the freezer just in case! I followed the recipe with these exceptions: I only used half the olive oil (but all the butter) called for I used mesclun greens instead of spinach and anchovy paste instead of the anchovy fillets. We loved it. It didn't taste as unusual as the ingredients might have led one to expect. The fennel once cooked is very mild in flavor. It's a lovely savory tasting dish which goes together in minutes. Definitely would make it again.

I liked this dish as did my two boys (I had my doubts about them but made it anyway). I too was looking for something different to do with fennel and thought this looked good...and talk about healthy! Liver and spinach in one dish! I didn't have capers but substituted with green olive tapenade that was on hand. I also didn't use as much oil but otherwise stuck to the recipe as written. It was quick and easy to make and definitely will make it again.

Individually the ingredients are fine; collectively it did not work. The chicken liver flavor dominated. Next time I will make pate from the liver and but the fennel in a cold salad. This was a one and done.
