I make a chunky veggie spaghetti sauce and had some leftovers on the stove when I found this recipe so I thought I'd give it a try. Very, very good and it's a great way to use leftover veggies. I'd still like to try the original recipe with asparagus and carrots.

Nice idea, putting the eggs right in the veggies.  I didn't like the idea of the spaghetti sauce though, so I made a gravy from a packet of the chicken seasoning that you get in ramen noodles.  Spinach works really nice here; also a sprinkling of fresh parmesan right before serving

Delicious and easy to follow. I added some zucchini.
