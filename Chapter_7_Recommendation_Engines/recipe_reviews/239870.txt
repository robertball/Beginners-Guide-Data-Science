When you can find it, celery root is worth the effort to peel it.  It was always a fixture on my grandmother's holiday table, but is hadn't seen it in years.  This fall our Farmers Market had it and I bought several (if you can find them very fresh with some green stalks they keep for weeks.)   I saved some calories by replacing the butter and cream with low fat yogurt - not fat free, you need a little fat to get the right mouth feel. And don't forget the nutmeg!  Thanks, Chef John.

WOW this is GOOD. Thank you Chef John. I made it almost as written. I bought 2 celery roots and one small potato, so I did it that way. It was WONDERFUL. I did cheat a bit and add a couple of tablespoons of Cream Fraiche left over from Chef John's Pork  a la Latte that I served over the celery puree. OMG, this dish was pure heaven. The left over puree was even better after overnight in the fridge.

I probably didn't do the recipe any favors by adding garlic instead of nutmeg. It was good, but not "wow" good. Next time I will follow the recipe, use freshly grated nutmeg, which I love, and submit an update. Sorry Chef John, I should have trusted you more.

We really enjoyed the flavor of the celeriac in the mashed potatoes.  I will definitely make this again!
