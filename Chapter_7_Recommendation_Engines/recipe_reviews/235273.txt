Awesome recipe!  Would change just a few things - I would add fresh minced garlic to the sauteed veggies, and add my seasonings there.  Cooking them in the oil I find generally brings out more of the flavor.  I would also add oregano or Italian seasoning blend - although a great sauce, wasn't super flavorful and that's my preference.  Otherwise, I think it's a definite keeper and just in time for the weather to turn chilly.  Thank you for sharing!

I made this recipe as written.  It was a masterpiece.  I have never made anything like this in my life that tasted this complex.  Thank you for the recipe! I have enjoyed watching you on Youtube. (Next time, I might add a little handful of brown sugar at the end to take a little of the acid bite of the tomatoes away, but seriously perfect as is).  I ate it without noodles just in a bowl =)

I liked learning the technique of using the milk but something about the flavor of this was just...off. It tasted too much like wine and not like anything else. I will definitely try using my own seasonings next time!

First time, followed the recipe and instructions and the results were delicious!  Second time, like any cook, I wanted to add my own touches:  1) Divided meat 1/2-ground chuck, 1/2 ground sweet Italian sausage; 2) Added 1 tsp. of garlic powder to spices; 3) Used Half & Half instead of 2% milk; and used 2 jars of thick & hearty sauce (time-saver).  Flavor, consistency was amazing!  Note: Follow stirring instructions, increasing times to obtain desired consistency. SAVE PASTA WATER - A cup of the pasta water will come in handy to loosen up the rich sauce if you find it too thick. I used it and it not only loosened the sauce, but it enhanced it as well.

I made this last night and my Sicilian husband who doesn't like red sauce declared it the best red sauce he's ever eaten! Although I usually stick to the recipe I did make several changes on this one. I added 4 slices of bacon, diced, with the other fats and added 2 cloves of garlic. He hates carrots so I shredded them to hide them in the sauce.  I used only Italian sausage for the meat and only used 2.5 links. Substituted Stewed Italian tomatoes for the whole tomatoes, and swapped out the milk with heavy cream. I only used 1/2 tsp. salt and substituted 1 can of low sodium chicken broth for the water.  I did skim off the fat before serving which eliminated some of the fat...hey! don't judge me :)

Fabulous- just like our favorite Italian restaurant version!  I did add 2 cloves of crushed garlic (because what is Italian without garlic??) and I don’t do alcohol at all so subbed 2 cups beef stock for the white wine.  Perfect!

I thought this was an excellent recipe. The taste was fantastic. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers to freeze.  I couldn't use the wine in the recipe so I added half chicken broth and half beef broth. The only issues that I found was that it did take longer to simmer each step than stated which wasn't really an issue for such a yummy recipe. It was worth the time.  I also felt that it was a little thin when it was done cooking so I had to add some tomato paste at the end to thicken it up. That didn't alter the recipe at all. It was fantastic and I'm glad that I doubled the recipe to freeze some leftovers for future use. Nice job Chef John.

I followed the recipe without making any changes and the flavour was so very different to the "meat sauce" I've made in the past. Certainly more time consuming but worth it!

I followed the recipe exactly, as I usually do with a new recipe. This was so amazingly perfect, I will probably never make any changes. Well, maybe I'll double it. The sauce only improves with long cooking time. And I really don't like chopping carrots.

I added some spinach at the end of cooking before serving and that just knocked the recipe out of the park!!!  It added a great earthy flavor.  We're a family of 6, kids are young and everyone loved it!!   Most had 2nd helpings :)  A fabulous base recipe!  Agree with other comments about adding garlic,seasonings and cooking time.  The secret is the longer it simmers, the better, IMO.   Also, is different from the Bolognese that I know.   Definitely a keeper recipe to experiment with (y)  Thanks Chef!

Loved this recipe, added 4 cloves of garlic minced, which was sautéed with the other vegetables, used meatloaf mix (veal, pork, beef mix) for the meat and my usual Italian seasonings. I did not use cayenne but some red pepper flakes instead.  I followed the rest to a T and it was outrageously delicious.  My 1st attempt at Bolognese thank you chef for a wonderful addition to our most loved pasta sauces

Great recipe!!   Easy to make and tastes great.  I would only add that the timing is a little off.  The recipe suggests 5 minutes for most of the steps where I found I had to let it cook 10-15 minutes to get the sauce to the perfect consistency. That's my only criticism.  Otherwise, great sauce to try especially on a cold Sunday afternoon!!!

Well done Chef John.  I made this recipe but used 1lb of beef and 1 cup of carrots, celery and onion.  I also grated almost 1 whole nutmeg .  Then at the end, I put fresh basil and Parmesan Reggiano to dress.  It was fantastic!    The most important thing I found with this recipe, is that cooking each layer of recipe on medium heat will make it soo much more savory.  

All these years and I have been trying to sear the meat on high to brown it... hard to believe such a simple change results in such a drastic difference in the end product!

I made this for Sunday dinner. It was a HUGE hit. We had about 8 people for dinner so I made a double batch. The only thing I changed was; I used 1.25 pounds of 'meatball mix' (pork, beef and veal) and about a pound of 85% ground beef.

This sauce is DELICIOUS! Wow! I don't think I've ever tasted a bolognese this good. I did substitute half a cup of the white wine for red wine, to add a bit of depth. I also added watered-down beef broth whilst simmering the sauce, to keep it moist.  Overall, this one's a keeper!

Great recipe! Made it as called for but without the cayenne pepper.  As mentioned by many already, the timing on the steps took longer than the approx. 5 minutes given. This was easy, delicious and worth the extra time.  Thanks again Chef John!

I had to substitute almond milk for a dairy allergy but otherwise, made exactly as written.

This is the first time I've tried bolognese sauce, although I make an extremely good puttanesca, so I'm no stranger to sauce making. I can't quite put my finger on it but I didn't love the flavor profile of this recipe. Too much wine maybe? Not rich enough? One thing I did notice is that I felt the sauce was too salty. This is surprising because I followed the seasonings to a T (I usually just eyeball seasonings), and I generally like salty things. In fact, I was worried, while cooking it, that the called for amount (1 1/2 teaspoons) wouldn't be enough... But after tasting the finished product, I wish I'd held back. I suggest adding half the salt while cooking and add more at the end if needed.

Changed recipe. I didn’t have celery, used chopped brussel sprouts instead. I also added the following spices/ingredients to the veggies: kalamata olives, 1/2 tsp oregano, 1/2 tsp basil, tsp of chopped garlic, beef bouillon, Red wine. I omitted the milk and white wine. I used red wine and a dash of chicken broth. Delicious. I also substituted all Spice for the nutmeg and doubled it.

Let me just say, this is the 'real deal'.  I visited Bologna in the fall (what a unsung gem!) and had to have the sauce that made it famous before leaving. It was love at first bite and so different from the Americanized versions I was used to:  the emphasis was on the beef rather than the tomatoes and spices.  This is the purists' version, folks, and I first came upon it when the NY Times published it (the differences: Ms.  Hazan used whole milk but no cayenne). The only thing I changed was to add canned beef broth at the end instead of water. This sauce freezes well and is now in my regular rotation.  Thank you Marcella and Chef John!

The most delicious sauce I ever made! The only changes I made were- didn’t add wine, added garlic, used crushed tomatoes, cooked for only 3 hours because I couldn’t wait any longer! So so good! Try it! You will not be disappointed!

Delicious!  I added some Italian seasonings. Originally I dumped in 2 cans of diced tomatoes but a little while later I fished them out to crush them because they were too chunky.  Be sure to smoosh your tomatoes before adding them!
I made it again- it was fantastic!

Followed recipe and turned out delicious.   Definitely  a  keeper!  One thing I will say is it takes longer than 5 minutes for milk and/or wine to evaporate more like 10-15 minutes for each liquid to evaporate.   My grandson gave it 2 thumbs up - he's the spaghetti sauce connoisseur!

I had a neighbor give us a bunch of fresh tomatoes. Sort of cobbled the recipe together with them. Need to see if recipe and instructions can be adjusted for fresh from personal farm veggies and meats?

In my opinion, this recipe needs more tomato. Use plum tomatoes, tasty ones, not the big watery ones you get in the cheap produce bin at the supermarket.
More garlic is also good.
I haven't managed to give the meat as fine a texture as I would like; it always comes out more coarse than I would like. I'm still working on this part.

I doubled the recipe, used whole milk, we had ground turkey and Italian sausage on hand instead of beef. It was hard to keep from sampling while cooking, but it was worth the wait at the end. I have some picky eaters to contend with, so the process of cooking the sauce down reduced the small bids that they would otherwise whine about. This will be a regular at our table!

So easy to make.  I have made it exactly as the recipe calls for and I have made it with changes.  My family loves it both ways.  Changes:  50/50 Beef and italian sweet sausage.  Pinot Noir works very well with the recipe.  Do not leave out the milk or nutmeg; that is what gives it the signature bolognese consistency and flavor!

This sauce was pretty good but took longer than stated in the recipe or video.Even with the minimum 3 hours of simmering, I needed about 4  1/2 hour from start to finish and you can't be away form the stove for long, as you need to stir the sauce every few minutes .. I am not sure the end result is worth all that time !

I have little experience with sauces; however, this sauce was a joy to make. Slow simmering and rich, it was absolutely enjoyable. I am glad to say that this will be part of my go-to recipes.

The recipe is fine and it tastes pretty good. My issue is that it is a very labor intensive recipe with adding things in and cooking them down. Repeat. After all that effort I can honestly say cooking a pound of meat in good jarred spaghetti sauce tastes just as good and only takes a half hour. To me this was not worth the time.

I love, and have tried many of Chef John's recipes. I needed to tweak this a bit because we don't eat beef, but it still  came out delicious. I added 1.3 lbs ground turkey, 2 Tablespoons Italian seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seed, 1 Tablespoon basil, and 1 Tablespoon parsley. I also added 1 can of tomato paste for a bit more color and flavor.  Could not have done this without the basic info from Chef John!

1st timer to a Bolognese. I followed recipe to the T and as all 1st timers, I was off. I made a few adjustments, thanks to reviews, and it was outrageously good. I'm going to make it again the way I did with the review help (wrote down the alterations I had to make), then I'll go my own way. Fiancee said it'll be a great sauce for his favorite Lasagna and my many other Italian recipes I make. Baked Ziti and Manicotti. He even thru the P word around!! Pizza? Opinions? Hmmm..
Should I even go there? Pizza sauce runs thru my blood, it's my DNA!! He said he would try it. Rather than a beef topping? Just the sauce and cheese. He's making it tonight, I'll let you know when I can. ??

We loved this sauce.  I followed the directions to a T except I used 1 lb ground beef and 1/2 lb mild Italian sausage, added a small pinch of white sugar to the tomatoes to cut down on the acidity and used only 1  3/4 cup of wine.  It was wonderful and I will most definitely be adding this to my regular rotation.

Love this recipe. The flavors are amazing, and it’s easily one of the best recipes I’ve ever made. The only reason I don’t give it five stars is because the times given in the recipe are far too short from what I’ve experienced. I’ve made this recipe probably six times now, and as an example, when it says that the milk will pretty much finish evaporating and cooking down in five minutes – well, that’s just not accurate. This recipe takes MUCH  longer to make than is stated. Other than that, I wouldn’t change a thing.?. Yourself a favor and eat it over rigatoni. It’s the best shaped Pasta for Bolognese - all of the meat gets trapped in the tube and it is a miraculous bite!

What a fantastic sauce! I really wanted to try this recipe without any alterations for as authentic a sauce as I could make, so I followed the directions and ingredients exactly. The milk took quite a bit longer to cook down than expected - an hour or so, but everything else went as planned. The flavor is so rich and the meat is so tender. This may not turn into a regular dinner for us simply because of the time and planning involved, but I'll keep it in mind when I want something authentic and different from all the other sauces.

Lovely recipe. However I made a few small changes in attempts to add more flavor to the recipe - I used half veal and half beef mince and added some Italian herbs before simmering.

Had pasta bolognese at Scotch Plains Cafe in Essex, CT and loved it.  Problem with dining out - gotta make this at home!
Tried this recipe - good, but not great.  Plus, a LOT of time reducing down 1 1/2 cups milk and 2 cups white wine.  The basic ingredients are fine (I used crushed tomatos - my 'go to tomatos') but the liquids are not there.  I want a creamy sauce, so next time will try half + half plus roux to thicken.

I've made this several times now. It's a regular request from my partner. All of the liquid reductions give it a rich and complex flavor. Love the addition of nutmeg. My house smells lovely while this sauce simmers on the stove.

I've made this  five times since I first found this recipe.  (6 weeks ago)  My family loves it.    My only change is using 1 cup of white wine only because the first time I made it I only had 1 cup.  Because everyone loved the sauce the first time, I've stuck with that change.  I have a batch simmering  right now for tonight.

Great recipe!  Thanks Chef John!  I've learned quite a bit  over the years from your videos.

Excellent recipe, according to my customer (wife). I didn't have time to simmer it for the full three hours, but it turned out very good anyway. I added some garlic, because who ever heard of an Italian sauce without garlic? And I added some Italian herbs just because. Other than that I followed the recipe fairly closely.

Incredible!  I usually make meat sauce, but this tops it all.  My company complemented so much on this recipe.  I will make it again.  It was very rewarding to watch it change throughout the cooking stages.  Try it, you will not be disappointed!

I had this sauce in Italy on vacation last year and fell in love with it.  Chef John's video's are Awesome and recipes are easy to follow ..... love allrecipes.com because they have "normal" recipes to help me be a great cook!  Because there's quite a bit of chopping involved, I double (or triple) the recipe and freeze leftover sauce for a future date.  It freezes well!  Enjoy!

I used lean ground pork to sub for some of the beef (also lean).  I didn't have two cups of white wine, so I used a mix of chicken broth and cooking marsala.  Smelled great!  I took the advice of another reader and put it in the crockpot on low, but it tasted burnt after that.  I would recommend just doing the whole thing on the stove.  I'll give it a second chance though.

Amazing! I cut out all the extra work and made this in the slow cooker. Why not? I cooked it on high for seven hours, but my cooker is a little on the fritz, so for another cooker, maybe low would be fine. I didn't need to add extra water, and I only used one cup of wine. It came out delicious! Everyone loved it.

Excellent recipe with lots of flavor.  Too time consuming unless you have lots of time to make.  Followed recipe as written but not sure if I will make again.

I really wanted to like this and took the time to do it right.  I added  Italian seasoning and garlic with the veggies, but the end result  was too oily, a bit bland, just off a bit. I did skim as much of the fat off the top as possible.  I've made better. Needed to dr. it up a bit

I've made this several times. The first time I followed the recipe exactly, but didn't have time to let it cook so the veggies didn't break down. Definitely let it cook for several hours. It's so much better. Chef John knows what he is talking about. If yours didn't turn out you did something wrong. I have since added garlic because I am a garlic lover, but everything else is exactly as CJ recommends.

Just an outstanding tasting Bolognese. Thank you Chef! Only comment is it takes double the time to burn off the milk and wine, so 10 minutes, not five. Even then I had more in the mixture then suggested but after adding tomatoes and cooking for five hours, it boiled off and tasted amazing.

We loved it.  I didn't change a thing.  I followed other reviews and sautéed the veggies, then the hamburg.  I made the recipe and plans changed!  I covered it and put it in the fridge overnight.  The next day, I had very little fat.  All in all, we thought it was a very delicious recipe and I will make it again.

This is a very good recipe.  Next time I would add garlic with the vegies and seasonings as another reviewer suggested. I also prefer adding some hot italian  sausage. I'd prefer the hint of spice to come from the pork sausage.

I was very surprised that this was as excellent as it was. It is not at all similar to the Bolognese I have made before in that he uses white wine and milk instead of red wine and cream. He also uses tomatoes instead of tomato paste. I loved it Chef John and it is cooking on the stove right now and the pasta water is boiling. Drinking a glass of merlot and watching CNN waiting for a heavenly meal. Thanks!

I have made this twice. Both times it took longer than described. The flavor builds and expands into the best sauce I have ever tasted. I will continue to invest the time to make this and consider it time well spent.

I liked this! Didn't have ground beef, so I used my ground turkey and added green pepper to the sauteed veggies, and a long green hot pepper instead of cayenne pepper. Plan to cook this again with beef. Delicious!

Just finished dinner with the family.  After cooking the sauce for about 5 hours and serving with rigatoni, it was very good.
I felt a bit of tomato paste would have thickened the sauce more.  It seemed to be lacking the thick sauce I'm used to.
But the sauce was very tasty and the family loved it, so it was a hit.
I make a very good meat sauce, handed down from my Mother, that is great and takes a lot less time to make so I'll probably stay with that, but if I have an afternoon with nothing to do, I'll make this again.
BTW: The 5 min. cooking times are a little short.  It took much longer to cook down the portions of the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly, cutting it in 1/2.  After 4 hours it was nice and thick and had a horrible flavor, or should I say, no flavor.

Good,  but i did add garlic, and only had one cup of white wine,  so i substituted one cup of red. After letting it simmer down into a thick sauce it was awesome!

This is absolutely the best quick bolognese I've never tried. It doesn't look like much (I find the photo to give it a much richer red look than the sauce actually has), but it is delicious.  And fast!  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  It's great just like it is.

YUM - made this as written and it was so delicious. It takes forever to make (each reducing step takes probably 30 minutes), and I ended up transferring the tomato mixture to my slow cooker so I could simmer it for 8 hours. The end result was fabulous, so much depth of  flavor.

Absolutely delicious. I did it exactly as he advised with one exception. I had cut up steak I had to use so I didn't use ground beef. Seriously, this is like one of the best sauces I've made!

This recipe is INCREDIBLE.  The sauce turned out perfect and had amazing flavor.  I will definitely be making this again as my new secret weapon recipe!  

I did make a few small tweaks though.  I left out the cayenne pepper (I don't like spicy things), and the times listed in the recipe weren't that accurate for me.  Definitely ignore the "5 minutes" suggestions throughout... you need more time to soften the vegetables and let the various liquids thicken and evaporate.  I likened it to making risotto... a lot of babysitting and waiting.  I hate when the veggies are crunchy, so I cook the heck out of mine before adding in the meat.  It made a big difference.  

I also didn't need to cook for the 3-6 hours as suggested.  Mine looked to be the right consistency after about 2.5 hours (including the initial mixing/browning steps) so I pulled it off the heat and served it at that point.  I may consider cooking it longer (and just adding water throughout) next time when I have more time to let the flavor develop, but even with the shorter time, this turned out fantastically.

I made this recipe tonight for my husband and I followed the recipe to a T but it turned out very watery and not very flavorful. I won't be making this recipe again.

It was excellent, and easy to make. Watched the video and that was very helpful.
