The end result of this recipe is a very suprisingly good dish. I say 'suprisingly' because getting to the end result (for me, at least) was a challenge. I have a 1000-watt microwave, so on the first go-round (with the butter and oil) I reduced it as said to 70% power, however the mixture of butter and oil sounded like explosives in my microwave after only a few seconds. It made a great deal of mess, even after I added a saran-wrap cover to the top of the dish. After adding the rice, I reduced the power to 50%, and cooked as directed which seemed to do the trick. I continued at 50% power for the rest of the cooktime and it did end up turning out a prety quick and really tasty dish, something my whole family (of non-rice eaters) enjoyed.

QUICK AND EASY!!This recipe was great!! I added chopped mushrooms to give it more flavor.  I also used brown rice, and although it was not as fluffy as white, it was still VERY tasty!!!! I will be making this again!!!!!

First time having it, and later when at a 'taste of south bend' fair, I took one bite of a risotto and turned it down because it didn't taste nearly as great as this recipe.

Problem 1: Too salty
Problem 2: onion gets overdone
Problem 3: not enough like regular risotto

Having said that, it's too not bad for a microwave dish but needs adjustments.

This was pretty good! I started off cooking at 60% power based on previous review, then switched to 50% after I added the broth, since my onions had browned a lot! (My microwave is 1200 watts) Not too creamy, though might add the extra water next time. And just a little too salty for me.

Delicious! My husband said that it was like eating at a good restaurant. I omitted the salt, used reduced salt chicken broth (used about 1/2 cup more than the recipe calls for), and cut down the cooking time on the rice by a couple of minutes. Delicious, and so much easier than traditional risotto recipes I've found. This is a keeper!

This was so yummy!  I had to tweak the timing a bit, but the result was very creamy.  Less work than the stovetop method, and allows you to do other things while it's cooking.

Had to change the times a little and had the rice burn a little, but after scooping out the burnt part, it tasted delicious!  Added some chopped up portobello mushrooms and will try broccoli.  Five stars for the amount of work put in in relationship to the flavor.  Mmm mmm.

This was a good rice dish.  It was my first attempt at risotto and somehow, I was expecting something more unique.  I'll try reducing the power.  I cooked at 100% power the whole time, but reduced the time I cooked it by about 5 minutes (for the second 9 minutes).  I used 1 can of low sodium chicken broth, and one boullion cube and it wasn't too salty. I covered it with waxed paper and it didn't make much of a mess.  I'd try cooking at a lower power next time as my onions also burned a little, but not so much to ruin the dish.

This came out delicious. I didn't follow the timing directions for the butter and oil, but the rest of the cooking time at 100% power came out nicely.

This recipe turned out quite dry and it didn't taste that good either  because the microve made the onions soggy, and if you leave it for 2 hours the onions become hard again.

I usually like to add something new each time in place of onions - broccoli, carrots, basil paste, and my favorite... Mushrooms

Others suggested lowering power & they were right, as we found out after totally burning the first batch.  I believe that next time I make this, I'll add chopped mushrooms & peas & increase the Parmesan cheese.

I enjoyed this risotto, but it didn't excite me.  I thought the microwave idea would be easier than traditional, but I actually found it a bit of a pain. My daughter enjoyed it and had two helpings :-)
