I'm confused as to how this is getting a five star rating from anyone.  Great idea, but it's waaaay to soggy.  If your going to make this, take the advice from the person that used a 16 oz loaf of bread AND use much less Kaluha.  It was way too strong using a cup.  Soggy is an understatement -- if you follow the directions the way they are stated, your bread pudding will be more like an alcoholic bread soup!

This was the best recipe for bread pudding! I've made it a few times and added extra goodies. I used 16 oz of french bread instead of 8. I found 8 to be a bit too soggy. I used twice as many pecans and added some rasins. I think I may cut back a bit on the Kaluah next time. I also reheated the leftovers in a toaster oven instead of the microwave. It kept the toping crisp.

This recipe is great!! I double the bread though. Also when I was out of coffee liquor I substituted rum (dark rum works best) but only about 1/2-3/4 of a cup b/c otherwise it is too strong. Make up the rest of the liquid with more milk.
Everytime I go to a pot luck I am asked to bring my bread pudding!!

I loved it! I hate coffee flavor of any sort, but we used Mocha Caramel liqueur and it was great. Definitely use 16 oz. of bread, otherwise it would be way too soggy. But be sure to use a bigger pan... it expands as it cooks. I'd also leave out the cinnamon sugar layer; it's more than sweet enough with the caramel.

A very good Bread Pudding indeed. It's not like mother used to make but I am afraid she took that recipe to the grave with her many years ago. I did make a couple changes to the recipe. I eliminated the Coffee Liqueur and substituded fresh honey for the Corn Syrup.

One cup of Kahlua is way too much--the dessert exudes alcohol fumes when served....I don't know if that's in error, or if others expect that in their food.

This bread pudding is incredible. As far as I'm concerned, bread pudding ALWAYS needs some sort of alcohol in it. Usually though, the bread pudding I get is pretty plain and needs a rum or whiskey sauce to kick it up, but this bread pudding had the flavor of the coffee liqueur all throughout the pudding. I did put about 12 ounces of bread, though, and I think it would've been soupy without the extra bread (hence the 4 stars instead of 5). Overall, it was incredible and I will definitely make it again.

PS - Used an off-brand coffee liqueur and it was still great.

I adapted this recipe to make in a slow cooker - much less time consuming for me on Christmas day.  I reduced the amount of Kahlua as suggested by others (and doubled the amount of bread).  However, maybe because I made it in the slow cooker, it really wasn't very strong at all, and I would have preferred the extra Kahlua.

I used about 12 ounces of bread, but wish I would have done 16.  It was definitely custardy.  The caramel sauce was fabulous.  I added pecans and cherries in the middles and then some more pecans on top of the cinnamon/sugar layer and beneath the caramel layer.

Just for an FYI... Starbucks now makes at Coffee Liqueur that is new to the market in 2005. It's called Starbucks Coffee Liqueur and is 40 proof and made with 100% real Starbucks houseblend coffee. It is really awesome and much, much better than Kahlua. Kahlua is poor in comparison. I bet if you made it with the SCL this recipe would be a knockout hit!

This recipe is great with a few alterations.  I've made it 3 times now and I think I finally figured out the proportions that I like.  I use about half a loaf of white bread, 2 eggs, 1/2 cup sugar, 2 t. vanilla, 1 c. milk, and 1/2 c. coffee liqueur (prepared as suggested).  I mix the 1 t. cinnamon in with the rest of it.  Then - cut the topping in half - it is WAY too sweet as is.  I would use 1/2 c. brown sugar, 1/4 c. butter and 1 T. corn syrup.  And save topping for after the bread pudding comes out of the oven and serve with icecream and the topping on top.

This Bread pudding is the best I have had in a long time, I used 1/2 cup Coffee liqueur, and the honey instead of corn syrup as suggested by others .. it was fantastic, also more bread, I used left over egg dinner rolls that I let get stale and then cut them up. It was a great way to use up the rolls leftover from Christmas.

This was awesome!  If following the recipe as written, I would NOT serve it to folks who don't drink (or to kids).  I used dried cranberries - you can find those and dried cherries with the trail mixes / dried fruits at the grocery store.  The 2nd time I made this, I made lots of adjustments, based on other reviews, and was glad I changed things.  I made it in a 3-qt dish, and used 12 oz. of bread (no need to toss with butter - my other bread pudding recipes don't have that step), added pecans AND dried cranberries (wow!!), and 1/2 cup coffee liqueur (perfect amount, even if serving to non-drinkers).  I used only enough of the sugar-cinnamon combination to cover the dish (didn't want to add too much sweetness).  Also note that skim milk works fine.  Outstanding results!!  Thanks so much for the recipe!

I followed this recipe pretty closely, except I used 3/4 C coffee liqueur instead of 1 C, but it was still too much. Next time, I'll use 1/2 C as suggested by others. I also put the cinnamon and sugar mixture into the egg mixture instead of sprinkling it on top. Cut the coffee liqueur in half, and this recipe is great with a scoop of vanilla icecream and a cup of coffee!

Too soggy and I increased the bread and decreased the liquids.  I also decreased the amount of coffee liqueur.  The flavor is good but the bread to batter ratio needs some tweaking.

I made this recipe with 1 1/2 packages of hot dog buns (12 buns) and it came out well!  I reduced the Kahlua to approx 2/3 a cup, but could hardly taste it in the finished product, so next time I'll use the full cup.  My only complaint is that the pudding puffed a LOT while cooking and then fell quite a bit.  Not sure if that's because I didn't use a water bath (I baked it at 350 for 80 minutes) or if others had this problem as well.  Didn't affect the taste though - this was yummy!!

We had this for dessert last evening and it was sooooo good.  It is a lovely dessert that tastes delicious and looks lovely on the plate.  It cuts better the second day.  Trust me, try this one you'll love it!! I didn't rate the kids friendly section as it has alcohol in it and I don't have kids anyways.

Okay, I have decided that the 8 ounces is weight measure instead of liquid measure. either way, needs a lot more bread than one cup. I used 4 cups and it could still use a little more. aside from that this recipe is the most awesome bread pudding I have ever eaten!

Disaronno baby!! 1/4 cup. Try it! Do it!

I made a couple of adjustments, based on other reviews and what I had on hand.  I cut the milk back to 2 cups and the liqueur back to 2/3 cup (I didn't have coffee liqueur, so I used Hazelnut liqueur and 1-1/2 tsp of espresso powder). I also served the caramel sauce on the side, adding it to the top just before serving. It was very tasty!

I changed the recipe so much... it isn't quite the same, but similar. Made this recipe for 2 people so I cut back on sugar, eggs, etc. accordingly. I skipped the "sauce" completely,
Soaked dry fruits [raisins, guava] in 1/4c brandy to soften, about 20 minutes.  Used day old [homemade in bread maker ] banana walnut bread & older plain bagels. Tossed cubed breads in melted butter & baked in the 425 degree oven to toast about 10 minutes [turning every few minutes] until lightly browned.
 In separate bowl, mixed the egg with a few splashs of Half & Half, cinnamon, 2T brown sugar, 1tsp vanilla and a 4oz carton of "coffee flavored" pudding pack. Tossed in the brandy w/ dry fruit.  Whisked well.  
Put the toasted bread cubes in oiled ramekins, added sliced almonds. Then poured the liquid egg mixture over the top. 
Put a few pats of butter on top for good measure and baked at 350 degrees in a water bath for 45 minutes.  

Excellent!! 

Anyone can follow a recipe, but true good cooks are adept at making due with what you have on hand.

Soggy was an understatement! Omg! It looked disgusting! I reduced the sugar for the topping and it still came out so  sweet I almost went into a diabetic coma! I used baileys rum cream as I couldn't find the coffee liquer here in jamaica. Nice flavour. Too sweet and I think the bread should be trippled.
