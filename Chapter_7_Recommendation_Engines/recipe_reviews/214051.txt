Save an extra clean-up step by putting all the ingredients to be mixed into the zip type bag, "massage" it all together and then snip a corner off & squeeze it into the egg halves.

This is a great recipe! I really enjoyed these eggs. Since my family isn't into spicy, I used regular yellow and dijon mustard instead of the spicy and hot mustards. I also skipped the pimento stuffed olives...I didn't have any, and my family doesn't care for them. I found that the best way to make a nice, smooth filling that's easy to pipe is to use my hand mixer to mash the yolks, and then beat in the other ingredients. I made one recipe the first time, and they were so good that Geranium and I just made a double batch. Thanks for sharing the recipe...these are great!!!!!

I've only had deviled eggs a couple of times in my entire life (and have only made them myself once) so I don't have much of a reference to compare these to. I do know what I like though - and I liked these. Unfortunately I couldn't use hot mustard as the recipe called for- Hubs wouldn't be able to eat it.  So I used a couple of different spicy brown mustards.  I loved the bite and tang of the mustard but I think it was the combination of the mustard AND the green olives that made these so good.  In other words, these just wouldn't be the same without the green olives!  And they make these look so nice and dressed up too! The only thing I didn't like, however, was that the mustards I used turned the yolk mixture an unbecoming brownish-greenish color.  No fault of the recipe - I just must have chosen some weird mustards!  Since I can't use the hot mustard, I think maybe next time I make these I might use half yellow mustard, just to make sure the yolks stay a pretty yellow so they look as good as they taste!

Oh My. . . .Yum!  If you are a deviled egg fan than I would double this recipe.  I had to make a second batch because the first batch never made it out of my kitchen.  First time using sugar in a deviled egg and I added horseradish along with the mustards because that was mom's secret ingredient.  Thank you!

I love deviled eggs and I hate making them, but I am in training to be the sweetest and most devilish mother-in-law ever, so I thought I had better give these a whirl. I had to use HOT mustard instead of "Sweet Hot Mr. Mustard," because thats what I had - and I simply can't pipe anything, so I just filled my eggs with my cookie scoop - but I followed the recipe otherwise. Fantastic! I wish I had more. Thanks for the recipe! â™¥

I took 72 of these eggs to a party ~ yes 6 dozen deviled eggs... They lasted 1 hour. I've been asked for the recipe so many times that I now go to parties with copies of the recipe.

We LOVED THESE! I didn't even realized that your recipe got published (CONGRATULATIONS!!!!) until I saw SunnyPie's mouth-watering picture this morning. I had everything on hand and knew I HAD to make these for lunch today! I always make mine w/ the traditional relish and yellow mustard, but we thought these were way better than those, lol! We really loved the addition of the spicy and hot mustards and the green olive on top made these perfect! This will be my new go to recipe for deviled eggs. Thanks, SHORECOOK for a wonderfully simple and delicious recipe that has become a new favorite at my house! :)

Awesome, shorecook! I made this recipe exact, only leaving off the olives only because we don't like them. I made these early this morning to use up the remaining eggs before shopping day. It's got this whole sweet-hot thing going on. I can't have sugar and eggs are low-carb so next batch, I might leave out the sugar next time but that's a personal choice, not reflective of the recipe. I'm beginning to rethink deviled eggs....the last two recipes I made were AWESOME! NOTE: I couldn't find my cool tips to make pretty filled eggs, so I just scooped the filling into a thick freezer bag and snipped off the edge. Wa-la, instant piping bag.

These were fantastic! I took them with us to a cookout yesterday. I made them exactly as written using hot mustard from a chinese restaurant and to keep with the spicy theme I use hot hungarian paprika for garnish. I will be making these again! Thanks Shorecook!

I made this recipe exactly as written.  I was a little worried about the volume of mustard, but bought the brands suggested.  These are absolutely awesome!!!  They have so much flavor.

We think these are the best deviled eggs ever!  I only had Dijon mustard, so that's what I used.  I think the sugar added sweetness really made these special.

For me, it was like squirting brown mustard into my mouth directly from the bottle!  Just not my style I guess.

This was great! I scaled down the recipe because I only had 3 boiled eggs on hand and just wanted to make deviled eggs instead of only having plain boiled eggs for breakfast. I left out the olives, because I didn't have any. I also omitted the teaspoon of hot mustard because with the spicy brown mustard and the hot mustard, I wasn't sure how spicy it was going to end up and I have a fairly picky 4-year-old. After explaining that the paprika was pretty but not "pepper", she ate several and love them! It's not often I make something new that she will eat, let alone enjoy. This is definitely going in my recipe box and I will probably pull it out for my next family gathering. Or maybe just another late morning breakfast!

These eggs are really good! I made them with my sister (larkspur) and we have already made three batches! In place of the spicy brown mustard we used dijon and in place of the hot mustard we used regular yellow mustard. (We are not spicy lovers here ;) These are perfect, Our new go-to deviled eggs recipe! Thanks! :)

These are to die for. Made them at Easter. Set them down on the coffee table, went back to the kitchen to get another appetizer and when I got back they were all gone lol. So I would say they were a big hit.

I have a TON of spicy brown mustard to use in the next few months before it expires - got it for nearly free with double coupons.  I was skeptical about mustard in deviled eggs, as I have never made them that way - especially with 2 mustards - hot and spicy!  But OMG -HOW DELICIOUS!!!  Thank you for the recipe.  BTW - used 1 pkt Splenda for low carb version.

This recipe is closest to our family recipe. I have tried many other deviled egg recipes on this site but my family likes the traditional plain eggs. I use 1/4 c. mayonnaise instead of 2 tbsp. as we like it creamier.  I do not use hot mustard in this as family does not like it. I used a pastry blender to break up the yolk which made it very smooth. When you pipe the filling in, it looks so pretty and the addition of the sliced olive on top always brings an "Oh, these are so gorgeous".  If you don't have an egg plate, I lay these on a bed of shredded lettuce which makes it pretty.  Make lots as they go fast.

These are our favorite deviled eggs now but with a few changes.  My kids are not too keen about spicy mustard so I cut the spicy brown mustard in half.  And I don't ever have hot mustard on hand so I use regular mustard with a few shots of Tabasco.  Then I also add about a teaspoon of pickle relish, the tanginess works well with the other flavors.

I like deviled eggs, but honestly, I can't tell much difference between any recipe I try, so I must not have a very discerning egg palate! Nevertheless, these are great and went over very well at our July 4th lunch.

This is the best and easiest recipe I have found for making deviled eggs.  I didn't have any hot mustard so I substituted Grey Poupon Dijon.  Splenda was used for the white sugar to lower carbohydrates.

Love this recipe. This the way deviled eggs are supposed to taste. Couldn't find the Sweet Hot Mister Mustard, so I used French's Honey Mustard instead. Still was perfect.

Yummy! A crowd pleaser.  Didn't have the exact types of mustard so used brown spicy mustard and yellow mustard, but they turned out wonderful!

I'm sorry I guess I am just not a mustard person so I really did not like these at all. I think it is just my personal taste, didn't care for the sweet taste in the egg.

It's true. These are the best you can get. The olive on top is a MUST. Best deviled eggs we have had yet. Wow.

Totally yummy! Last minute addition to my dinner party. We soo loved these. And my kids gobbled them up. As well as the dinner guests. I made this and another deviled egg, and both were great for the dinner party we had. I wouldn't change anything at all with this recipe. And funny thing about this, the spider...sending hubby to the store for green olives..the typical green olives stuffed with pimentos...he came home with a can without and they tasted like black olives...but that's okay...they worked. Thanks Shorecook...this was my favorite!

Very delicious.....I added a very small amount of diced onion and I placed a cooked shrimp on top of each finished egg. I served the eggs along with fresh green beans mixed with scallions, rice vinegar, olive oil and garlic salt so it was sufficient for a meal....fresh diced pineapple for dessert. Yum! A good meal for a hot summer night.

These are really wonderful eggs. I have made a lot of deviled egg recipes and these are the best. I take these to all sorts of events and they are always very well received. I follow the recipe exactly except that I don't top them with olives (I don't care for them much.)

When i make these eggs literally EVERYONE at the the party love loves them. Even the people who have always disliked deviled eggs were impressed! I must say thank you thank you thank you to you for inventing them! Also its a good idea to have a bowl of extra green olives on the side for those who would like more olives :)

Too sweet but still pretty good.  Next time I'll try half the sugar.  I always use fat free plain yogurt in place of mayo- turned out well in this one!

Wonderful Deviled Egg recipe.  We love deviled eggs and I love trying different types.  I liked the sweet-spicy combo in this one.  I didn't have the type of hot mustard called for in the recipe, but I did have takeout packets from the Chinese restaurant.  The mustard packets worked great.  I chose not to add the olive as we don't care for them.  I served these delicious eggs along side Scott Hibb's Amazing Whisky Grilled Baby Bake Ribs and Scalloped Potatoes and Onions, both from AR.  Thanks SHORECOOK for sharing your recipe, these will be made again!

I am the submitter of this recipe and I would like to add a little more information.  Often times "Mr. Mustard" is found in the refrigerated section of your grocery store.  My submitted recipe was written using "Original Mr. Mustard" so either "Original" or "Sweet Hot" will work.  (or your favorite hot mustard)  The hot mustard gives this recipe it's kick while the olive adds just enough saltiness to it.  I hope this information helps you to enjoy my recipe.  Thank you to everyone who tries it!

I boiled the eggs the day before, then mixed everything in the food processor. Turned out creamy and delish! Topped with chives instead of olives. I actually doubled the recipe because I have some serious deviled egg eaters in this family! This was the first thing to go they all loved them! This is a keeper in our house! Thanks for the recipe Shorecook!

Loved the flavor of the mustard and sugar, and the creamy texture.  Didn't have any hot mustard, so just added a squirt of hot sauce; no olives either.  Did have to use more may than called for to get a good texture on the eggs.

I made these yesterday.  I only used 2 pinches of sugar in a double batch because we prefer only subtle sweet.  These eggs are tangy and delicious the way deviled eggs should be.  Thanks SHORECOOK for the staple recipe.

Very Good! I've always been making deviled eggs the same way (with mayo and vinegar) and thought these were a nice change, really liked them. I used regular mustard for the hot mustard because I didn't have any and left out the olives. I will try with the hot mustard next time. Thanks for the recipe!

Delish! I made these for our 4th of July gathering. I doubled the recipe because of the large crowd we had.   I used Sweet and Tart Cranberry Mustard and  didn't add the olives. They were gone in no time!  Next time I will make 4X's as many!  Thanks SHORECOOK!

We love things spicy and loved these eggs.  I used regular mustard and some VERY HOT mustard that we purchase from a local specialty story.  My mom always put an olive on her eggs.  I wouldn't make them any other way!

I've been making deviled eggs the way my mom once did - toss in some mayo, a squirt of mustard and a little salt and pepper.  They were good, just a normal deviled egg.  I wanted to break form the same ole same ole and gave these a try.  We really enjoyed the different mustard and the sugar really brought the bite mustard has into balance.  I put olives on half and pickled jalapenos on the other half for the non olive lovers.  Everyone enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipe!

So I didn't want deviled eggs, just eggs to eat with some toast.  This was perfect!  I followed the recipe exactly except for going a tad short on the mustard and for using the whole egg in the mix.  Yum!  Thanks, SHORECOOK!

Fantastic recipe for deviled eggs! This is the recipe my mom taught me to make except she uses yellow mustard and no sugar. I thought the spicy and hot mustard gave this a nice twist, and the green olive on top was a great addition.

I've always loved deviled eggs but had never made them before. This recipe was easy and delicious. We've made it many times. We usually add some veggies (varying depending on what we have at the time). This makes some extra filling which we usually scoop up with bread/toast. Delicious.

Hubby loves deviled eggs but I could never seem to get them quite right. I've finally found a recipe that he loves.  I didn't change the recipe at all...unless you count having to double it so I didn't run out.

We really liked these deviled eggs.  I didn't have brown mustard so I used yellow mustard.  I also used Bens Sweet Hot Mustard and it turned out great.

Even though I couldnâ€™t find the Sweet Hot Mister Mustard these were still delicious.  The flavor combination of the mustard with the green olives is really nice.   I served them with a summer salad and it was the perfect addition.

Great basic deviled egg recipe for the deviled egg novice. I didn't have spicy mustard on hand, so substituted dijon mustard, and used apple cider vinegar in place of white. Delicious!

I used Hot & Sweet Mustard from another site (none on AR yet) for the one teaspoon called for here. I use extra large eggs, so the mixture was too dry to pipe until I added a second teaspoon of the hot sweet mustard. With extra large yolks, next time I'll add an extra teaspoon of mayo to make it a bit creamier. It is a nice change from the standard deviled eggs. I'm sure the original amounts are fine with regular large eggs.

I was in agreement with a few other reviewers, didn't care for the pimento olives and prefer regular and Dijon mustard so by the time those changes are made, it isn't the same recipe. The recipe as it stands is no for me. I am keeping the best of the best for my family tastes and this didn't cut it.

I like deviled eggs and I love olives, so I knew this was going to be really good, and I it was.
I only made 1 substitution, Dijon mustard for hot mustaed because that's what I had.

No need to make changes to the ingredients...but advise to everyone.....do not follow the recipe for making boiled eggs....

The shells will stick and cause a very unsightly presentation.  There are plenty of wives tales on how to prevent this.  Use your own favorite if you have one.  I did not and followed this recipe using straight from the refrigerator eggs and regretted it (for presentation) .

My sister makes deviled eggs every year, never has trouble with her eggs...She loved this flavor better than hers.

Her advice for boiling eggs was to let them get to room temperature first!!!

My family loves them! I use a plastic cAke decorating bag with the tip cut off to fill the eggs. Gives you that neat finished look!

unbelievably delicious!  instead of hot mustard I added a little pickle relish. in the end I added another 1/2 tablespoon of mayo too.  I also mixed the egg yolk filling with a hand mixer. It made it very fluffy.  Love it!
