I made this recipe for my Filipino wife last night.  It was so easy and so delicious.  The left overs were even better tonight!  My wife loved it and said that it tasted just like her mom's.  I didn't have the ingredients on hand to make latik, so I spread sweetened shredded coconut on top and browned it under the broiler for a few minutes.  I only had to cook the pudding about 15 minutes before it got thick.  Thank you for posting this simple and delicious recipe!

I made this dish for my mother and she tells me to make it for her all the time since it reminds her of her childhood. Great recipe!

Very tasty.  Felt it took under 30 minutes (thickened quickly for me).  Yum.  Thanks!

My husband really enjoyed this desert. It thickened up in about 10 to 15 minutes for me. I sprinkled it with a little cinnamon and enjoyed this unique little treat. Very creativeâ€¦

I made this recipe tonight for dessert. I tweaked it by adding 2 cups frozen corn, 1TB of coconut oil, and 12 ounces of water or more. I also ground one cup of Basmati rice for the Rice Flour. I only used 1/2 cup of Truvia instead of sugar. I blended everything in my VitaMix till smooth. I brought it to a boil, then cooked it approximately 20 minutes on low, stirring frequently with a whisk. I poured it into a greased 9x11 glass dish. When it was set, it was like a soft pudding. Delicious.

I decided to try this recipe because it had good reviews and few ingredients. I was looking for a recipe that used coconut milk and came upon this. We usually really like corn casserole type dishes in my family and the kids love corn any way I cook it. However, we did not care for this. My husband said it tasted like nutrisweet. (I swear I followed the recipe exactly). My oldest daughter ate some and liked it OK, but my other two children wouldn't eat it. I could not eat it either. It was way too sweet. I added a second can of corn after it was done to try to salvage it, but that did not help much. It was inedible. I'll stick with my go to corn casserole recipe if I want a sweet corn dish.
