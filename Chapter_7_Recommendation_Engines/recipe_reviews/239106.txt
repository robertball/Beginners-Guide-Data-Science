This is a super easy weeknight dinner. I recommend adding onions and garlic to the pan when you cook the sausage, still simple!

This is a great dish for crazy weekday nights. It tastes great, easy and fast. For a fifteen minute dinner, it's not going to be perfect but I will definitely make this again.
