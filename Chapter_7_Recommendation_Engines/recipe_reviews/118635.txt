Great recipe. Suggestion --  in addition to using the ranch mix in the breading, it's even better when you dip the eggplant fries in Hidden Valley ranch. My kids love it this way but then again, they love all vegetables with ranch.

These were a huge hit!  I think next time I may add a little more of the ranch seasoning, it was so good!!! Got grown men who have never liked eggplant eating it. Highly recommended. Also, I did serve it with some ranch dressing and it was great.

My family gobbled this dish down. I think next time I'll try baking them to cut down the fat. I also mixed sour cream and the Ranch seasoning together to make a dip. Yum!

Oh my goodness gracious, these were easy as so delicious.  The only complaint I have is that I ate half of the batch all by myself!

I actually used the batter for this recipe on eggplant, squash and broccoli and it was delicious!! I highly recommend using it on the squash especially. Thanks for an awesome recipe. I never would have thought to use a dry ranch package for seasoning!

Nice twist for fries. Eat them all though because they get soggy after a while. Make sure to salt them and get the water out of them b4 you cook them.

I used cornmeal because I didn't have cornmeal flour, but the cornmeal started burning and smoking in the frying pan. So, I put the remainder of the eggplant fries on a baking pan and baked them at 350 and they still turned out well. Very tasty, especially dipped in ranch dressing. Make sure to eat them warm or hot, when they cool down they start to taste gooey.

Instead of frying I tried baking them to save on calories. They were good but I would imagine they would be so much better fried. Thank you for the recipe. I will try again and I will actually fry them the next time.

Needed more ranch, but was good. I'm not much on frying, so I doubt I'll make this again.

This was the best! I served them with hambergers and my kids ate them all up, I wish I would have made more. Next time I think I will use an entire pack of the hidden valley ranch seasoning. Not because it was bland but because I love the ranch taste and it is less fat then to dip in the ranch sauce.
