I've made this a couple of times now. I had never heard of such a salad, and since I love the combination of ham and pineapple, I just had to try this. I did use half Italian dressing and half light mayo because that's how I like my pasta salads that have Italian dressing in them. I also used whole wheat shell pasta because that is what I had. I do love how the whole wheat pasta tastes in this salad and I suggest using the shell-shaped pasta because it grabs onto the ingredients. I really love this salad and have a hard time controlling myself around it!!!!

I made this for a Fourth of July BBQ. I  love pineapple and ham and thought this would be great to try.   I did use half creamy Italian dressing and half mayo cause I like mayo in my pasta salad. but the dressing definitely adds a good flavor. I also added small cubes of mild cheddar cheese.  I  used shell pasta cause I think it grabs the dressing better. EVERYONE loved it and went for seconds.  a different take on macaroni pasta. DELICIOUS!

I had to make a quick pasta dish for my daughter's soccer team, and with only 1 review, I thought I was taking a big risk, and I am so glad I did! This was wonderful! So unique, but not weird. I also used Italian dressing and mayo, I left out the onion, only used 1 egg, 1 tomato, and 1 celery stalk, and it turned out fantastic. Definitely going to put this on the tailgating menu! Thanks for sharing.

This is my first review although I use this site ALL the time.  I no longer trust recipes that have not been critiqued by those that have actually tried the recipe.

I followed the recipe with a little tweak, used a 20 oz can of pineapple without draining.  Used raspberry balsamic dressing and enough Miracle Whip to satisfy my taste, also added cubes of cheese 'cos I love cheese.

Next time I will add frozen peas. Yes, there will be lots of next times.

I felt that the salad wasn't as flavorful as hoped. A little flat.

As others have stated, needs a bit more flavor.  Very easy to make.  I'm going to try sauteing the ham and pineapple next time to intensify their flavor a bit and see if that measure get this salad to where it should be.  Horseradish sounds interesting.

I really liked this but it was a bit bland for our tastes. To fix that, Ii added a bit of horseradish and some chopped Bread & Butter Pickles. Yum!

We were not crazy about the flavor, or lack of, and the combination of ingredients. The next day I added more Italian dressing, and another hard boiled egg., but it didnâ€™t make a big difference. Perhaps there were too many acidic items - vinegar in the dressing, tomatoes and pineapple.
It could do without the tomatoes and perhaps adding some mayo might help.

I added more Italian dressing so it was moister. I will make it again.

I forgot to buy Italian dressing so I made my own and to make it creamy, I added mayonnaise - but it was a hit.  I had requests to take leftovers home.

I actually used the 2-8oz cans of pineapple and I did not taste it! Maybe I drained it too much. If I make it again I will either add twice as much veggies or half the amount of pasta. I did use the full cup of dressing but added half when putting it together then the other half after it chilled a few hours just because that is how I make any pasta salad.  I used the store bought Olive Garden dressing.

I wasn't sure what I was expecting, but it is really good and slightly different. I like to make recipes as printed the first time to see how they are supposed to be, then make changes if need be. But I love this just the way it is! Sweet & light pasta salad... love it!
