These were so good..  be careful when grilling them though some of ours got crispy.. but for me it was perfect. I love a little crisp to my food..  You can experiment with this recipe too, we will try different seasonings but this is spot on in flavor for sure!

Although it had good flavor, it was still  watery which always seems to be the problem with zucchini.  I guess I was expecting even a little more firm or crispy has others have stated.  We even varied the time each of the 3 packets stayed on the grill.

Mine didn't come out as pretty as the picture but they were delicious.  I will definitely be using this recipe again in the future.
