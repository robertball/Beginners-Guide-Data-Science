Don't give up on this recipe!  I made a test batch and produced rock-hard nuggets that were just awful, but promising. I read the reviwers' comments, made some adjustments and now have a pretty darn nice cookie: bake at 350F, add 2 to 4 tablespoons more flour and use 2 eggs.   The resulting cookies are chewy and quite dreamsicle-y. They were a hit with all those who tasted them.

I was very hesitant to try this recipe because of the mixed reviews, but it sounded so delicious that I gave it a try. With a few changes to the original recipe--2 cups of flour, 2 eggs, and only 1/3 cup of Tang--it's a real winner! I can only imagine, however, how terrible they would be without these changes. I made 6 dozen of these for a company cookie exchange, and everyone loved them, so they appeal to a lot of people. They are a welcomed changed from the typical cookie.

It's been a while since I've had GOOD cookies, but these definitely qualified as such. I changed the recipe a little bit...used 2 eggs, 2 cups of flour, 1/4 t salt and white chocolate chips, and these came out SO GOOD. The flavor is great, and if you're a cookie dough fiend, the dough is fantastic. I used my small Pampered Chef cookie scoop and got 75 two bite cookies out of this recipe. They look great and they taste awesome.

This recipe was very good. I used the tip to add an extra egg and 3 more table spoons of flour. The first batch I made was without the extra egg and flour and it was awful but they tasted good so I used the tip. I think these would be such a cute idea for HALLOWEEN if you took like black frosting and put it in a pastry bag and like made a jack-o-lantern face on them. Would definatly make again.

General consensus was that the recipe was too sweet, but we cut back to 1/3 cup on the Tang and it got rave reviews.  Tried it both with white chocolate and chocolate chips and they're good either way.  It's a keeper!

These will turn out all right if you make the changes everyone has suggested. Just a note to everyone who cannot find Tang...do NOT use orange kool-aid in its place.  Kool-aid and Tang are not the same thing and will produce very different results.

My husband and I received a jar of this cookie mix as a gift for Easter. I LOVE baking and make cookies all the time so was excited to try these out... You need to add water or milk or some liquid to the "dough" to be able to use it, and when it was done baking I had a yucky cookie sheet of orange flat blobs.   They tasted awful, and I enjoy a traditional creamsicle, so something was definetly off.  Please don't make these for people! The only good thing about this recipe was the smell of it baking if the oven.

My family loved these cookies!  What a great change from the usual chocolate chip, etc.  I wasn't able to find vanilla chips in my area, so I used chopped up white chocolate discs that you use for making candies.  I found the cookies took only 8 minutes to bake - possibly because I substituted the white chocolate candy for vanilla chips.

I actually got 29 cookies from the recipe. I also made the changes that were suggested. I used 2 eggs, 2 cups of flour. The cookie dough took some elbow work to get it all mixed together. However, the cookies turned out nice. My 4 year old, isn't to fond of them. Everyone else seems to enjoy them. I also had to cut down the baking time to about 7 minutes.

I live in New Zealand and we can't get vanilla chips or Tang.  So I replaced with Choc chips and made a Jaffa cookie!!   Having lived in US I knew what Tang was and replaced with similar item here. All the kids loved it!! General adult comment was it was too rich. Next time will cut down the amount of orange drink flavour. But an overall winner with the Kiwi's!!

i made some modifications to this recipes.
i followed the other users' advice on the egg and flour problems. 
instead of tang, i used country time lemonade dry mix. YUMMY! 
not too sweet and just tart enough. 
will probably make again!

No one in my family liked this recipe. My husband loves Tang and he hated them. My son (who loves cookies to death)took one bite and spit it out. That never happens. Anyway, I found the dough way too dry and had to add 1/3 cup of water just to be able to mix it. The taste is way too sweet. When a 2-year-old won't eat these cookies there has to be something wrong. Sorry. You might want to mention that you have to add water, that helps.

I'm making them right now and the last batch is in cooking. Seems that the sugar or tang makes a crispy burnt edge and therefore makes the whole cookie taste burnt. I adjusted the time and still doesn't work. Don't waste your time.

The recipe is wrong.  You need to add 2 eggs instead of one.  Also it would be better with orange extract, not vanilla.

I was a little reluctant to try this after reading the reviews..but decided to give it a chance.  Everyone thought they were pretty good.  I made a few changes though after reading some of the reviews.  I added just 13 cup of tang, added 2 eggs and 3 more tbs. of flour.  They came out just perfect so if anyone would like to try this recipe you will have good luck with these changes.

Good ONLY with the changes reviewers suggested. Reduce Tang to 1/3 cup, add 1/4 tsp salt, use 2 eggs and include another 3 Tblsp. flour.  Baked at 350 for 10 minutes and they came out soft and chewy. Think they would awful tangy-sweet if recipe was kept as originally shown. Just being honest! Thank you for fixing it with the past suggestions, so I wasn't disappointed!

I did not care for this recipe. That's quite possibly the sweetest thing I've ever tasted, and not in a good way. I'm sorry, but I just did not like it.

My family loved these cookies.  You should NOT taste the dough, or your face will pucker up.  The finished product is a very sweet, nice change from chocolate, and they taste even better the next day.  Store tightly covered.

GREAT COOKIE!  I did not cook them until the tops were lightly brown, I pulled them out a bit early and am glad I did.  Next time I will lighten up on the tang due to the richness/sweetness of it.  But still YUMMY!

I received this as a gift and was afraid to try them after I read all these reviews!  However, I actually thought they were pretty good.  I did add an extra egg and a few tablespoons of water -- I had the same experience as others that the recipe as written results in a crumbly and dry dough.  End result was good -- nice change from a typical cookie.

Hadn't read the other reviews, but figured out "the fix" on my own- added one more egg, and a healthy pinch of lemonade mix, along with the Tang already in it- also added extra vanilla chips. My kids WILL NOT STOP SNAGGIN' 'EM!!! They're easy, bake up perfectly at 375, 12 min. They're kinda sweet, but what do you expect from a cookie made from Tang? Texture is perfect, and I would readily recommend them for a nice change of pace! :o)

I was really excited about this recipe, but it just didn't pan out quite right. Way too Tangy(c) for my tastes. After making half the batch, we changed the second half, to try to fix the flavors. It turned out better. Next time, I'll be greatly reducing the Tang(c) to 1/4 cup and reducing the sugar to 1/2  cup. I'll be keeping with the 2 eggs and 2 cups of flour that have been suggested. Also, since I used White chocolate chips instead of Vanilla, I needed to add more Vanilla extract. The cookies from the original recipe tasted fine mixed in with Vanilla Ice Cream.

Mix is very easy to make, however; it doesn't really stand out in the jar.  None of my kids (13 and 6) cared for them either.  When you're trying to bribe the kids to finish their cookies, you know it's not good.  Tasted way too orangey in a sickening sort of way.  Gave 3 of these out for Christmas and I feel so bad!

I tried a sample batch before I made this for a gift. I thought the dough was
too dry, so I added a pkg of vanilla pudding and 1/4 cup milk. This made a 
good cookie, but not as orange tasting. I would probably change the vanilla 
flavoring to orange flavoring. Husband, teenage son and young daughter all 
liked the cookies!

Definitely a keeper!! I also used 2 eggs, 2 cups of flour and 1/3 c. orange drink as suggested by others. Also DO NOT bake for 10-12 minutes! I used this recipe to break in my brand new oven and they were perfect when baked for only 8 minutes :)

Mine turned out really bitter. I did what most reviewers did and added another egg and cut back on the orange. I could not find Tang at my grocery store. Maybe If I use that it wouldn't taste so bad. Will try again if I can ever find tang.

My family loved these cookies. I made them with the suggested changes, 2 cups flour, 2 eggs, 1/3 cup Tang, and white Nestle chips. I will definitely make them again.

I did not care for these. They're expensive to make and when you consider that they are too sweet and tart to eat, the cost is prohibitive. I followed the direction to a tee but the batter was totally dry and crumbly, the temperature listed was too hot and the first pan burned to a crisp. I reduced the heat to 350 and the time to 10 minutes which gave a better texture cookie, but still way to sweet to put in a jar and give for Xmas. Never again.

My mother was visiting while I was baking these cookies and she wasn't sure that she wanted a taste.  Orange flavored cookies with vanilla chips didn't catch her interest at all.  When the cookies were done she did taste them and immediately took another.  She liked them so much that she asked for a copy of the recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the Tang to 1/3 cup and used 2 eggs instead of 1. They turned out perfect.

My husband made these to taste-test first before he took them to work for an auction. They were cloyingly sweet, & the fake taste of Tang was overpowering, along with the sharpness of the citric acid. If you are accustomed to the fine tastes of a from scratch cookie with quality ingredients this won't be one of them.

Recipe sounded easy, bought the ingredients.  Should have read ALL the reviews first.  Looks like there will be a lot of Tang left over in many cupboards. Cookies were definitly a one time only experience.  Sorry.

I was so excited about trying these when I read the recipe. I made these and thought they were gross.  We couldn't find Tang (which may have been part of the problem), so we used Orange Kool-Aide.  The cookies were super sour and had an artificial taste.  EEK!!!

These cookies are fast and easy and make wonderful gifts when prepared ahead of time in a jar...   the taste is sweet yet a bit tart!!!  I love the fact that they are "different" from the everyday chocolate chip or oatmeal.   I received the jar of dry ingredients for Xmas with the recipe for adding the rest..   I loved it!

This is a really GREAT cookie! It truly has the taste of a creamsicle and the citrus flavor is awesome.  For a differnt variation, add dark chocolate chips and they taste like a chocolate-orange.

OMG! Best cookie ever! Tastes just like a dreamsickle:)  Some of the tips are almost right, but not quite. First let me say I live not much above sea level, and elevation may be part of peoples issues.  Leave the tang at 1/2 cup. Just make it 1 tsp of baking soda...absolutely no need for baking powder.  Double the vanilla.  At least 3 cups of flour not two.  The dough for this cookie should be the same consistancy as for chocolate chip cookies.  If it's raining or the humidity is really high...you may need a bit more. The only extra ingredient I added was a cup of dark brown sugar.  I did use two eggs.  Wonderful cookie.  One other tip...at my grocery store, tang is NOT found with the other dry drink mixes like countrytime lemonade.  Take a look on your bottled juice aisle. It will probably be on a top shelf.  This isn't a product people buy everyday, but has a wonderful taste for the cookies.  I baked at 350 for 12 minutes, and let them rest on the pan for about a minute before I moved them to let them cool.

I did as the other reviewers suggested and changed things up a bit.  I used 2 eggs, 2 C flour, and 1/3 C Tang.  I baked them on 350 for 12 mins.  I ended up with 3 dozen smallish cookies.  They were absolutely fabulous with the changes I made.  I am going to give these as Christmas gifts with the Christmas Orange book.  YUMMY!

I added 2 cups of flour and 1/3 cup of Tang.  I think I could have added less Tang.  I'm not sure about this recipe.  I also added 2 eggs like everyone else.  The cookies did not turn out the way I would have hoped.  I will try again maybe with less Tang.

Delicious cookie.  Thanks everyone for the great tips, i.e. 350 oven, less tang, more flour, 2 eggs.  Also, I added 3 drops of pure orange citrus oil (purchased from King Arthur Flour) and it really boosted the orange flavor.  Perfect for a cookie swap to get away from same-o, samo-o!

These turned out great - crispy and chewy!  I followed the other reviewers suggestions and added the extra egg, and I reduced the Tang to 1/3 cup - though I thought they could've been more orangey so next time I'll bring that back to a 1/2 cup.  I also think they'd be fantastic with semi-sweet chocolate chips - I'm going to try this as well!

Great recipe if you modify according to the other reviews.  You can certainly use less sugar if you want a tangier cookie.

cookie turned out moist and chewvy, but I would flatten the balls if I ever made then again, they were a bit too puffy and took alwhile to cook through the centre...I wasn't fussy on the flavour of the white chocolate chips in there though, I would probably go for chocolate next time (it might look nicer through the jar as well)

These were a hit in my household, not too mention kids at my son's school enjoyed them. To give it more of a citrusy taste, I used Tang orange-pineapple flavor instead of regular Tang.

I received this recipe as a gift...WOW it was a wonderful change!!!  I also read some of the comments...if you can't find vanilla chips use white chocolate ones instead.  Also,  I found that baking them on a stone instead of a metal baking sheet works MUCH better. Mine turned out chewy and a little crispy...just be careful not to overcook them.

These are the best! I mixed the dry ingredients together and put in food gift bags to send to my brother and sister's families. They were less expensive to ship than "jars". I made them for my family too - they were great!

I made 2 batches. I chopped-up the vanilla chips on the second batch & they were perfect. I will make these regularly.

I enjoyed this recipe very much, but I am an "orange" fan.  My husband and children said "interesting", which usually means "fine, no need to make them again unless you like them."

Dry mix would not all fit in the jar, so I cut back on the baking chips to 1 cup.
Dough is very dry so it needs to be pressed to shape cookies. I all so cut back on the temp. to 350degrees F and baking time to 9 minutes for a softer cookies. If you like Tang you will like these cookies. A great change of pace.

Pleasantly impressed with these cookies. A few tweaks, as mentioned by others, are definitely recommended though. Make sure you use Tang as the Orange drink mix, use 2 eggs, and use 2 cups of flour (I ended up using a bit more to get the dough to a better consistency). I also used white chocolate chips instead of vanilla chips, but the recipe still works perfectly well with them

I used other review's suggestions, so it's only partially the original recipe.  2 eggs, 2 cups flour, a little extra vanilla, 2/3 cup sugar and 1/3 cup Tang.  The dough did really look dry and I literally hand mixed them...kneading it, to make sure everything was well distributed.  With enough white chocolate chips to balance the really sweet batter a bit, I get the Dreamsicle flavor. The first bite is really sweet and there's a bit of an aftertaste...that artificiaI chemically taste.  But Dreamsicles never tasted like natural oranges.  I read several reviews saying to underbake them, but at 10 minutes on airbake pans, they were still mostly batter in the middle.  But then I left them a little too long and got crispy instead of chewy.  The texture looked funny, too.  Kinda bubbly or maybe pitted. That could have been something I did wrong! They were nice and orange colored, though.  Not sure I like them enough to make another attempt, but they were fun to try!

I needed a different recipe for cookie in a jar gift.  Decided to make a 1/2 batch after reading mixed reviews.  I didn't have Tang so I used 1 pkg. of unsweetened Kool-Aid., 1/2c. sugar, 4T. butter, 1/2c. vanilla chips, 1 egg, 3/4c. flour, 1/4t. baking powder, 1/4t.baking soda and a pinch of salt.   Delicious!! One reviewer said not to use Kool-Aid but tried it anyway and they tasted great!  I will definitely make these again. I did not roll them into balls.  Just used a cookie scoop.  I may try a sprinkle of sugar on top next time.  Yum :)

I'm sorry to say this cookie does not taste like a dreamcicle. About all you can taste is the tang mix. The cookie  tasted good but not as the name refers to. The white chocolate gets lost in the orange flavor.

Didn't care for this recipe.  It was very dry - I had to add about 1/3 cup of water.  They didn't taste as good as expected.

I took the advice in MSBARNES' 12/21/00 review:  Used 2 eggs and added 3 tablespoons more flour.  Baked at 350F for 12 minutes. They were delicious--chewy and very tasty.  Next time I'm going to add some chopped macademia nuts.

Far too sweet  - they are easy to make but very dry when you finish mixing - they bake well - but my kids didnt like them and my dh said he wouldnt mind if I never made them again - so I guess I wont be giving these this year.

WAY too much butter... turned out like goop on a sheet. I tried adjusting the baking time to compensate. It was a lost cause. Don't try - they're a waste of precious Tang!

I baked a batch of these before giving them as gifts and even my garbage gut husband didn't care for them.  Only if you're a real Tang fan would I recommend them.

These cookies do taste like dreamsicles, although they don't translate well into cookies.  My children didn't like them.  If you want a dreamsicle eat an icecream bar.

What a delightful change from chocolate chip cookies!  I'll be making several batches for gifts.
