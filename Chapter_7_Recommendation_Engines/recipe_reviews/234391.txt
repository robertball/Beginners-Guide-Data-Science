Delicious! I came across this recipe because I had bought some dried black mission figs for holiday baking, but never used them.  I just added a bit more apple juice, three cloves of garlic (left whole, just kind of smashed) and I used country style pirk ribs.  Very tasty!

We like pork with spiced apples so thought we'd try this. Used a pork roast instead of pork chops. Drizzled sauce over slices. it was really pretty and tasted soooo good! cooked on low for 6 hrs. Thank you Krista.

The pork chops were very dry! Overall, good flavor. I think next time we will do a pork roast or find more fatty chops. It has the potential to be phenomenal!

Had to use dried figs and cranberries.  Liquid was a bit thick and I didnâ€™t have any more juice so i added a splash of Coke.  My husband is extremely picky.  He enjoyed it!   Served over white rice but would be just as good with buttered egg noodles.
