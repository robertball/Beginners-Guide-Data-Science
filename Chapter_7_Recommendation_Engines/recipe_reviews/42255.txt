The taste was good. I was afraid it would be too salty from the salmon and caviar, but it was not. I had to add some salt. I made it for a special occasion - was not disappointed - just expected something more.

Fresh, flavorful and easy; that's what makes this dish so successful. We smoked our own salmon and freshly grated nutmeg was a nice touch. I will make again.

I made this for Valentine's Day Dinner and it was incredible! I just used smoked salmon bought from the store, the type you put on bagels with cream cheese, and it turned out wonderful!!! The nutmeg added such an interesting dimension to the taste, you really shouldn't skip it! Plus the contrast of the blue pasta (thanks to the caviar) and the pink salmon was so much fun! And did I mention this was a snap to make? Wonderful, wonderful recipe.

The saltiness will obviously also vary depending on if you go with roe or actual caviar. I went with salmon roe because I'm twisted like that (I also get thrills from egg-washing chicken), but I went with an exceptionally top-notch Scottish smoked salmon. So, if you have to skimp on the caviar / roe, do yourself a favor and get a quality smoked salmon. I added all the 'optionals' - nutmeg being a surprising flavor!

I would recommend cooking the pasta longer than the 3-4 minutes that the recipe suggests, it was just too al dente for me. The smokiness of the salmon, saltiness of the caviar, and creaminess of the pasta all went perfectly together and made for a delicious dish.
