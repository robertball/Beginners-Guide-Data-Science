Christmas wouldn't be the same without these cookies!  We've always baked ours slightly different; 250 deg. for one hour.  I like my pecans finely ground and an extra tsp. of vanilla.

these are wonderful, I do not use water in my recipe. Also I roll them in Confectioners' sugar first while warm and then again when completely cooled.  Makes a much prettier presentation.  I usually bake about 1000 of them for gifts for Christmas.  Last year I made something different and caught all kinds of flack from family and friends for not making everyone's favorite cookie.  so bake to baking this year.

I made these for my mom and I to enjoy...we love anything with a nut in them. I felt like the dough was a little flat, like something was missing, so the next time I make them I will try adding some almond extract in addition to the vanilla.

This Christmas my Mom requested that I make a "wedding cookie" like my Aunt used to make. After I looked over several different recipes, I choose to go with this one. It was a big hit! I have put it in my recipe book and will make them again. I added a dash more vanilla and rolled in them powdered sugar while warm and then again when cooled!

For some reason these cookies were very crumbly! I had to be very careful rolling in powdered sugar, but they tasted just okay to me!

This is the same recipe my mother used to make at Christmas time, my favorite cookies.  It's older than 1996, I was enjoying these cookies  from as long as I can remember. I was 5 in 1970, and remember "helping" my mom roll them in powdered sugar. Mom called them pecan logs.  I don't know where she got the recipe, but these cookies are melt in the mouth, and I would sneak and steal them from the cookie jar every Christmas while growing up!
