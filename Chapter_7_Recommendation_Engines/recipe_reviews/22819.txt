wanted to whip up a quick batch of cookies for neighbor girl.  This fit the bill.  I didn't have a yellow mix so used French Vanilla.  Added a bit of this and that; mini chips, raisins, butterscotch chips, and some chopped up Hershey kisses w/Almonds I had left...enough to equal 2 cups total.  They baked up beautifully, didn't spread much so can put quite a few on the sheet without fear of overcrowding.  They actually didn't taste like cakemix at all.  Great recipe that did what it promised.  Numerous variation possibilities make this a lovely, versatile recipe.

These cookies are no culinary masterpiece, but they're easy and a huge crowdpleaser. I doubled the recipe (nearly 70 cookies!) and took them to work; they received many compliments. My roommate, who tried one, asked me to help her make a batch to take with her on a camping trip. I followed exactly except for using 1/2 cup ss chocolate chunks and 1/2 cup ss chocolate chips, as well as adding 1 cup of M&M's. Pecans are also good instead of walnuts.

I love these! It is fun to try different cake mixes and to throw in whatever I have on hand!  They are always a big hit. :)

I substituted butterscotch chips for the walnuts -- tastes great!! They were simple & fast to make. I will try them with other variations & cake mix flavors.

For a cake mix recipe, these worked pretty well - super easy to put together while the oven preheats, and very tweakable. I increased the oats to 3/4 cup and added 3/4 tsp of salt, using chocolate cake mix and PB chips.

These were good, but nothing special.  I used a white cake mix and since I didn't have any nuts I added some craisins.  Also a splash of vanilla.  They took 15 minutes to cook in my oven.  I'll try them again, maybe with lemon or chocolate cake mix.

Five stars for how much easier these are than making them the old fashioned way!  They are soft and very tasty.  I think for the oats to add any real texture though, they need to be doubled.  You could skip the oats, too, because 1/2 a cup doesn't seem to do anything for them.  I will make these again for sure. :-)

The Instructions say to let them cool on a wire rack after you let them cool on the pan. But my Hubby didnt even let them make it the 5 mins on the pan. And he is an extremely picky person. he made me wake up early and make him some for his work buddies the next day. Theyre that good.

This was a good cookie - and a great way to get rid of the partial bags of chips that are left over from other recipes. I used chocolate cake mix and just added together chips, nuts and coconut to make 2 cups. They were easy and my kids loved them!

Delicious! So easy to make and so good to eat! Didn't change a thing with the recipe. I love a nice, soft chocolate chip cookie and these were definitely it! Great recipe! Will absolutely make again.

somehow they were burned on the bottoms and undercooked at the same time. they stayed in little lumps and did not flatten out when i baked them. i put them in the refrigerator so they would harden a bit. overall though, they taste awesome, they just look sort of funny.  i brought them on a tennis trip and people were hesitant to try them and said they definately dont taste like normal cookies and don't look quite right, but they were gone in about an hour.  i think i ate 10 while baking them.

I made this with some alterations.. The cake mix we had was a white cake. I used 1cup oats, 1cup smarties, and 1/2cup flax seed as itâ€™s what we had in our kitchen! I cooked them longer (12-15mins) as my kids prefer crunchy. Everyone agrees that they are super yummy!!

Very good cookies for such an easy cake mix recipe.  I might add a bit more rolled oats next time, just because I'd like more oatmeal flavor. Overall though, they were great. My kids loved them!

Awesome! Easy to do and I think the PTA will love them! I used lemon cake mix with strawberry yogurt. Added a little flour because I ended up using a bit too much yogurt. I used white chocolate chips as well.  Light, fluffy cookies that are super delish! Oops! Forgot to tell you, I didn't have butter or marge, so subbed yogurt 1 to 1. Worked great!

Just finished these and DH found them to be o.k. They were a bit too "cakey" & not very sweet. I think that had to do with the addition of baking powder to the cake mix. I misread the recipe & added 2/3 cups of oats & 1/2 cup butter. I found it to be enough butter because the mixture was quite oily. I used a Pillsbury Classic Yellow cake mix which has pudding in it; omitted the chocolate chips but added raisins instead. Will try again but omit the baking powder & increase the oats as well. I think we were expecting more of a soft chewy oatmeal type cookie. They are a very easy & fast cookie to make.

Tastes great & so easy!  Perfect for me & my 4 year old to make.  We used Devil's food cake mix & added Smarties.  Love them!

I used the yellow cake mix and found them too "cakey" tasting... next time I'll try chocolate.  They were extremely easy and quick, however, if you don't have the time to do it any other way.
