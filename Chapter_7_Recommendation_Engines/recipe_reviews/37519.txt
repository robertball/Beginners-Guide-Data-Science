Very easy and quick. I used shredded instead of grated parmesan.  I thought it tasted better cooled down than when hot. Fiance and I agreed that it seems to be lacking something. However, if you are pressed for time or already have the ingredients on hand, this is a good recipe.

I served this recipe with bacon crackers and people who said they hated artichokes were asking for the recipe.  My 4 year old even loved it.

This easy recipe is so tasty, especially on Wheat Thins. Sometimes, I'll go a little easy on the artichoke and use a hefty amount of SHREDDED (recipe calls for grated) parmesan/italian mix cheese in the dip and sprinkled on top to make it all the more scrumptious. If I'm a little lazy, I skip the tomato and onion topping - the best stuff is in the dip! Make a double batch for a party. It will disappear in a hurry. (You can even handle this super easy recipe AFTER you've been enjoying party libations) Whenever I have friends or family coming over this is the ONLY thing they request. "Just have that artichoke dip, and I'm all good, Dez!" Pure heaven.

Simply delicious! I didn't chop the artichoke hearts, I just left them as is and later divided them with a spoon. I used a half a cup of parmesean, and a half a cup of mozzerella, because thats all I had. It turned out to be delicious! I used chopped red onions instead of the green, and used canned chopped tomatoes instead of the fresh. This was delicious on warm italian bread slices. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy and yummy, I omitted the tomatoes and put this in the microwave for 5 - 8 minutes. Great!
