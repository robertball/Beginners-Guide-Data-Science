I am an avowed lamb lover, but my family is not.  I convinced my wife to try a lamb dish one more time, and went hunting for a recipe that *hopefully* would be palatable to both of us.  Not only was I extremely happy with the flavor, but my wife said that it was wonderful!  This dish truly has a gourmet flavor, and will likely please those who don't ordinarily like the taste of lamb.

This is truly a great recipe.  I wasn't so sure it was going to taste so good when I was combining the ingredients, but the results were absolutely wonderful.  I wouldn't change a thing.  We've already made it three times.

Great recipe!  Tried it with a whole leg of lamb as well as cut up and skewered as kabobs. This one is a keeper!

This is one of the BEST lamb recipes I have ever at the pleasure of eating.  Our picky 5 year old, said it tastes like heaven! I feel like I am having a gormet dinner in my own home and being a beginning cook the results make me feel like a professional cook and that I can now say "Yes I am a great cook!"
Goes great with rosemary, garlic, olive oil potatos and the syrian bread we made yesterday from a recipe on this board.

Absolutely delicious!  I used the marinade on a whole shoulder of lamb and then baked it.  I drained the marinade off the meat before doing so.  I used the marinade as suggested - pouring it over the meat once sliced.  A hit with the family and a real keeper.  Thanks!

I fell in love with Lamb when I was in Iraq, and have been looking for a high quality, very flavorful recipe for the past 3 years. This one fits that bill. I was seriously unsyre about the combination of ingredients, but after tasting the final product, even my somewhat picky wife said that she loved it. This recipe has found it's way into our permanent family recipe book. I made this exactly as written. Had a lot of left over meat so I cut it up and made pita sandwiches with it and goast cheese. Talk about a great, verstile recipe. Gonna try this marinade with buffalo next to see how it tastes.

Excellent, very tender and very tasty.  Lots of left overs for Lamb Chili afterwards.  This is the only recipe I will use on the barbeque from now on!

YUM.  Wow was this ever great.  The marinade is key.  My husband's family always has lamb for the holidays, but it was never all that... memorable.  THIS year was different!  Thanks so much!

Husband loved it.  Marinaded overnight and then tossed it under the broiler.  I also added rosemary.  I am not a fan of lamb but I had to admit this was a good marinade.  I will make this again.

Great way to use leftover leg of lamb. I chopped it in a food processor and didn't saute it. It was wonderful. Thanks Dale

I made this recipe for a Christmas supper and it was AMAZING. The sauce is absolutely perfect. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of the cooking, as the grill was burried in the snow. I seared the lamb on a griddle and then finished it off in a roasting pan in a 400 degree oven. I will make this again and again.

This is one of our favorite recipes.  I do cut the lemon juice in the marinade to 1/2 cup and I add Rosemary and mint. Excellent recipe.

I have made Roast Leg of Lamb several times using THIS marinade.  It works beautifully!  The meat is tender and flavourful. Last time I injected the strained marinade into the meat using a meat injector.(Forgot to marinade the night before...) Worked like a dream! I can't wait to try this recipe as described; butterflied and BBQ'd.  Terrific recipe, Thanks!

I followed the recipe exactly (except for the cooking time...it took about 1 1/2hrs of indirect grilling for my 4 bound leg to reach Med),  This recipedwas OK but not lamb worthy.  We love lamb and this recipe was definately not our favorite.  The time is way off on this recipe.  Allow for more grilling time if you make it.  And the flavors, well they were ok but nothing exceptional.  I will not make this one again.

This method is amazing!!! I had lamb leg thawed and had to use it. I didn't have soy so I used worchestire, didn't have lemon so I used lime, didn't have brown sugar so I used honey, didn't have fresh so I used some powdered ginger. Only marined for 30 and then made the sauce. It was AMAZING!!! Next time I'll be stocked and make it by the book. Hats off to Dale!!!

Although I was in the hospital and unable to make this for Easter dinner as planned, DD's pitched in and did it.  They followed the recipe exactly and brought me a plate of the best lamb I've had.  I hope to make it again myself next Easter.

This was a really nice dish. Of course come comments. I used Lamb Back strap fillets for this which I also asked my butcher to tenderise for me, thus allowing a reduced marinate time with the same results. I served this with fluffy roasted spuds and buttered green bean's.

I absolutely love lamb, but have a hard time finding it here locally in grocery stores. I do however find it from time to time and I tried this recipe and it was tasty. Much better than that I have even had at restaurants. Thanks.

I followed the directions for ingredients except I used curry powder because I couldn't get fresh ginger root. I did leave in fridge overnight and didn't cook it 'til 5:30PM that next day.  I put lamb on grill for about 1/2 hour and it looked great on the outside at that point. Then placed in 400 degree oven for about 1 hour. (My lamb was 1.75lb and was boneless and butterflied). The sauce was GREAT ! Thank you for an awesome recipe.

We really loved this.  Didn't use a whole leg, just a cheaper cut, and little powdered ginger instead of root, and cooked it in the oven but it was really good!

This was a snap to make and my family, including the kids (9 & 11) loved it.  I did not have a grill so I took an electric skillet and place a small rack in it.  In about 50 min. it was perfectly done.  The only thing I would recommend is to double the marinade.  It is so good you will want to have more.  Peace !!

I made this with a 3 pound deboned, rolled shoulder roast and it came out great.  I eye-balled the measurements and cut the sauce down by about 1/3.   Nice to have the added sauce.  Served it with a bag of German spaetzle that I picked up to try with it.  It was perfect for the sauce.  Served this also with a big bowl of lighty steamed fresh green beans.  A wonderful dinner.  On our bbq it did take at least an hour more than stated to get to the 145 degrees.

I made this with lamb chops, didn't have dijon so used yellow mustard, cooked in the oven at 225 for 90 minutes (cooked at same time as a pork dish that needed that time & temp), didn't serve with extra marinade--and it was heavenly. I'm not sure I could stand it if it's even better prepared exactly to the recipe.

We loved this! I have a go to marinade for lamb but wanted to try something new for Easter and I'm glad I did! I was a little leary about the brown sugar because I don't like "sweet" meat but this was perfect. The flavor of the meat was great and it was very tender. Thanks for a yummy new lamb recipe!

We love lamb at our house and on the surface this seemed like it would be a yummy recipe. Not so. Personally I thought the marinade/sauce was too thick and sweet and obscured the taste of the lamb. Try the Garlic and Herb Lamb for an easy but impressive dinner on lamb chops or leg of lamb.

Tough for me to rate this because I don't like lamb and this recipe didn't change my mind. I made two different types of lamb for Easter, and this one tasted like liver to me. I'm giving it four stars because some guests really liked it.

I must say that I married a man who LOVES lamb, and simply stated, I do not. His family makes it for holidays as and I do my best to avoid eating it. For the love of my husband (and the raving reviews), I decided to learn to cook lamb for him. I followed this recipe as described, except for having to cook in the oven.  My first time cooking lamb, new recipe, and I loved it!!! PERFECT! I even made rice pilaf and peas in tomatoes sauce with Italian seasoning to go with the meal. ANY LAMB DISLIKING PEOPLE OUT THERE - YOU MUST TRY THIS!

We felt the marinade/sauce was wonderful but would be better put to use on a beef roast. As expensive as lamb is, it didn't taste much different than if it had been beef, so we will use it on beef from now on. Great addition to our kitchen.

I made this recipe yesterday. I have never had lamb. But my future son in law gave us some. I searched for weeks for a good recipe. I found this one, and it seemed like it would be good. Only thing I changed was I had no olive oil or ginger root. I also marinated for 6 hours, I forgot to do it the night before. lol Also since I did not have 2 things you had on the recipe, I out about 1/4 red sangria wine. Everyone loved it. It was a wonderful recipe. I am so glad I found this. Very very tasty. Thanks for sharing your great recipe.

I've never made lamb before and really liked this marinade. I only used 1/2 tsp salt and it was a bit too salty for my taste...not sure if it was the lamb or the marinade but will definitely use it again and further reduce the salt. Thanks!

I used chunks of lamb leg in this marinade for lamb kebabs and it was WONDERFUL. My boyfriend's biggest complaint was not having enough lamb. Will definitely be making again!

I love this marinade :) I used the stone ground mustard with the seeds in it as I did not have Dijon. I also omitted salt (which I do for all recipes.) Otherwise I followed it perfectly. I used half for some lamb kabobs and the other half as a steak marinade for a sirloin. I loved it! It covered up the kind of harsh taste you can get in lamb. I cooked both on the grill over medium high heat and had minimum charring even though there is high sugar content. Thank you!

This was my first time making lamb.  I separated the skin from the meat leaving it attached in a few places and stuffed it with my herbs and garlic cloves.  I marinated overnight and grilled on Easter Sunday.  It was absolutely perfect!  Didn't even need mint jelly.  I am absolutely amazed!!!

Not particularly good or bad.  The flavours do not lend well to lamb.  The sauce however is great on wings.  Lamb has such a wonderful flavour that is was kind of ruined by the sauce.  Salt pepper, garlic, and mint is still my favorite flavour for lamb.  I cut up the lamb into thin strips afterwards and made a stir fry...was pretty good.  Thank you for the recipe!

This was most excellent! I made several adjustments due to necessity only. I was out of fresh ginger so I used powdered ginger. I was out of lemons so I used 7 drops of Young Living therapeutic grade lemon essential oil. Everyone raved about it at our Christmas dinner. The sauce was amazing!!!

The lamb was very tender, but it didn't taste like lamb.  The texture and taste was more like liver.  I didn't hate it, but I won't make it again.

This was delicious, but it took much longer than 40 minutes to get to 145F (45 on the grill, 35 in the oven at 350) for a 4lb leg.  I used charcoal, which perhaps makes a difference.

Awesome.  The marinating sauce adds a great flavour.  Used a 1/2 tsp of ground dried ginger instead of fresh ginger. Used chops instead of butterflying leg.

There are not enough stars to rate this. Because of unexpected  advents, I had to leave the lamb in the marinade another day. I was afraid the meat would be mush from to long of a marinade. I was so pleasantly surprised how great it turned out. We could not stop eating it. It was tasty and tender. Matter of fact I have made the marinade again and have country style pork ribs soaking for supper tomorrow evening (24 hrs).

I made Dale's lamb leg twice. My son, mother-in-law, and father-in-law said it was the best lamb leg they had ever eaten. Better than at a restaraunt. My son is a meat cutter. He brought left overs to work. Even the two day old lamb leg had all his coworkers asking for the recipe.

This is my go-to recipe for lamb. I marinade the meat for at least 24 hours, always follow the recipe exactly as is and reduce the marinade for a delicious sauce. I'm making lamb for Christmas this year and may try throwing in some fresh rosemary and experimenting to make the reduction into more of a gravy.  But then again, I may decide not to mess with perfection! Thank you for sharing this great recipe.

This lamb is amazing right off the grill, but the sauce from the reduced marinade takes it over the top! And the bonus is that it's not difficult to make at all. I usually make one and a half recipes of the marinade so there will be extra sauce. This is a huge hit with the whole family!

I made this recipe last year and then forgot where I got it from.  It was super easy to find again though.  Where else would it be but in Allrecipes.com?  I just opened up an account here only because of this recipe.  Easy the best lamb I have ever had and hard to believe I made it at home.  It tastes like something you would find at a fine Greek restaurant.  Super easy to prepare and fun to think of what to serve it with.  I don't know who Dale is but he sure knows what he's doing with lamb.  Thanks Dale!!!
