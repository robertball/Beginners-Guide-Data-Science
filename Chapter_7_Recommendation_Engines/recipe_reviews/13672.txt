One of the best crab bisques I have ever had, definitely restaurant quality. However the exact recipe presented here looked a little bland so I added: 1 clove garlic, 2 jalapenos minced, 1/4 c. chives, 1 c. frozen corn, and substituted heavy cream for the milk.

This simple recipe needed some help. While I was able to reduce the fat by using skim milk, Campbell's "Healthy Choice" mushroom & tomato soups, it was too sweet for my taste. Juice from a lemon, along with diced garlic, red pepper, celery, mushroom and a spike of red pepper, added more depth to the flavor. It was great over brown rice!

This is a very simple and quick recipe but it needs some additional things to give it some taste. I used buttermilk instead of regular milk.  (It gave the soup a  nice consistency.)  Then I added two cloves of garlic, one small onion, some fresh red peppers - just a few small pieces, a can of corn, a drop of Worecestershire sauce, a dash of basil, two tbs of Old Bay Seasoning, fresh ground pepper, and just a dash of celery salt.  Season to taste.  I cooked on medium heat until it started to bubble, then I let is simmer for about 20 minutes.  It turned out delicious!  It's a keeper if you add the extras.  Enjoy!

Very easy recipe.  We added some cream cheese to make it creamier.  It was a bit bland for me, but the kids loved it.  My husband and I added a few shakes of tabasco sauce and some season salt, then it was great.

I have made this recipe for social function s at church and it is always met by rave reviews. It is also highly requested. What I have done to personalize this recipe is to also add minced clams and baby shrimp along with the crab. To add an extra flare you can also add lobster. It makes it a total seafood bisque. Tastes Great!

This soup did not agree with me. I thought the canned soups ruined it.

Delicious and so easy! A bonus that it's all ingredients I typically have in the house. Good as is or can dress it up. I sauted some celery and garlic, added some cooking sherry and tabasco. A little on the sweet side but soooo good.

I really didn't like this soup. The tomato soup was very overpowering. I tried adding cayenne pepper to balance the sweetness, and some other herbs but there was no saving it. I couldn't even finish my bowl. It's in the fridge now, I'll give it another try because I hate wasting food, but I am not looking forward to finishing it :(

Would be a five but I had to adjust it. It's not crab bisque if you use imitation crab as this recipe calls for. Made per the recipe this is Pollock bisque. Use real lumped crab for a true crab bisque.

This recipe was delicious, but I didn't follow the original recipe exactly...I used clam chowder soup, put about 1/2 milk and then 1/2 buttermilk in the mixture, I then added a dash of salt, some celery salt, and a bit of basil. I then added the rest of the ingredients as mentioned in the original recipe. It turned out great!
