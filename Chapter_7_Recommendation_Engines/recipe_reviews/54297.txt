YOU WONDERFUL GAL YOU!!!!
I have been HUNTING for a recipe like this, perfect amount of ranch with the cheese. Years ago, hubby tasted a ranch cheese ball and I havent been able to find one since, now I can make it! I used Sliced almonds, I actually stuck them in in progressive levels to look like a pinecone, it was pretty cute!
THANK YOU!
**Also, I Used Smoked Almonds--mmmmmmm delish!

This is a terrfic cheeseball!! I don't like ranch flavouring and I loved this. The only change I made is instead of almonds, I rolled the ball in bread crumbs that had a little melted butter in them. VERY good. Will use this for fancy and no-fancy occasions alike.

I love the cheddar cheese in this instead of just cream cheese.  I covered it in pecans because I love pecans.  I served with wheat thins or triscuits or wheat crackers and it was perfect.

This was way to salty for me...and I like salt! I think adding half of the ranch dressing would help. I wanted something w/ a more subtle flavor. This wasn't it. Sorry.

**Some ranch packages are 2 oz.** I made this recipe with Hidden Valley ranch and it was very salty, so I checked the package to find that it was 2 oz instead of one (like the recipe calls for).  I'm guessing the others who found this too salty had larger packages too.  I fixed the problem and I also added a cup of chopped up spinach.  Delicious.

Did NOT care for this! I just wasted time, ingredients and money in making this. It did not set-up and I followed the directions exactly and it tasted like salty ranch cheese...no real flavor except a salty taste. Not sure what all the fuss and almost five stars was all about in this recipe. Back to my good and trusty dried beef cheese ball recipe!

I made it for Thanksgiving this year.  It was very salty, but not inedible.  My turkey shaped cheeseball was not as nice as the one pictured, but, hey, it's interpretive art, lol.  I used smoked almonds on the outside.  Note:  be sure to use full fat cream cheese and mayo to get the cheese ball to set.

Great recipe. The only thing i added was green onion to give it a bit more of a crunch but my family loved it.

I made this recipe for a Thanksgiving recipe 2 years ago, and have made it for every special occasion since! Everyone raves and requests the recipe! And this one recipe makes a lot!! I usually make 3 or 4 good size cheese balls with this and give them to the people I REALLY like!

I love this cheese ball. It is perfectly soft and will not break your crackers even right out of the refrigerator. Also, love all of the cheddar cheese. I grated my own sharp cheese and used chopped pecans instead of almonds.

It's a great guide for starters... I did not use as written (I don't care too much for ranch) but the measurements worked wonderfully as I subbed onion mix for ranch, walnuts for almonds, mexican for cheddar.  Mix and match what you have in the cupboard!  I was worried it would be too sticky (too much liquid) but it was great!

Oh my goodness -- this cheese ball is nearly addictive!  I made it as directed, using full-fat ingredients as recommended by other reviewers in order to get the ball to form.  I don't have a mixer, so wasn't able to get the cream cheese mixture perfectly smooth, but it was fine nonetheless.  To "chop" the nuts, I put them into a freezer bag and pounded with a meat mallet until I got the size pieces that I wanted.  Some reviewers commented that this recipe was too salty, but I thought that it was just right - I'm sure it depends on what brand of ranch mix you use.  There might be some lower sodium varieties out there.  I also served the cheese with lower sodium crackers.  Although we liked this recipe as is, I think I'll try adding some bacon next time.  Thanks for an easy and tasty recipe!

Super yummy!  I am a vegetarian so I am always looking for cheeseball recipes that don't involve meat.  I used neufchatel cheese instead of the cream cheese.  This is a keeper!

We liked this--might use a little less ranch mix next time.  It is quite salty so may use unsalted almonds next time too, but it was very good.

I don't know if I did something wrong, but mine never firmed up to anything that could be shaped into a ball (although I still tried).  The taste was great though, as a dip and I will definitely make it again.  Next time if I have my heart set on making it a ball, I'll add more cheese and less mayo, I suppose.  I rolled one "ball" in toasted pecans which was a nice compliment!

I made this for Thanksgiving and served it with toasted pumpernickel squares and it was a huge hit.  It packs a lot of flavor.  I made it with low fat dairy and it didn't hold it's ball shape but it made an awesome dip.

This is wonderful!  And very easy, I did not use the almonds but added chives to the top.  This was a hit at the office party.  Everyone wanted the recipe. Kids love this also!

I made this.  It's pretty good, but i had to make a change.  I was careful to use 1 oz. package of ranch dressing and it was still TOO salty.  Measured the ingredients but i could tell it was too soft to set up, so i wound up adding twice the amount of shredded cheese to get it to stick together.  My hubby doesn't like cheddar, so i used colby jack cheese.  BE CAREFUL about serving it with salty chips or crackers.  Definitely go with plain type stuff so the salt isn't too overwhelming.

Best cheeseball! So easy, didn't change a thing. Everyone wanted the recipe. After tasting it I was sorry I hadn't kept some at home for later.

Everyone loved it. I did not have salted almonds, so just rolled it in sliced almonds.

Delicious, I made this for a football game and everyone raved about it. I didn't tell them how easy it was to make.

I took this to a family gathering and it was a huge hit! The kids couldn't keep there hands off it either. I did not have the almonds so I rolled it in the bread crumbs. Alot of people told me that they liked the fact that there cracker did not break off in the ball.

I was looking for a crowd pleasing recipe and this was it.  It was gone in no time at the family gathering I took it to.  I didn't change a thing.  I really liked the almonds on it.

This cheese ball is very good but nothing out of the ordinary.   It was an easy recipe to follow.  Turned out well but it is not any better than any other ordinary cheese ball i have made.

This is SOOOO yummy! It was a big hit at a ladies' luncheon. Several asked for the recipe. I think the added ranch dressing mix is the "secret" ingredient! Thanks Tammy!
