We used to make this all of the time, but got out of the 'mode'.  Having seen this recipe, we dusted it off and have made it several times.  The only difference is I pre-bake my hash browns until done, I also saute my peppers and onions a few minutes to blend the flavors

Good concept, but the hash browns did not cook all the way.  For the next one, I precooked them with some onions and it worked out a lot better.  You could also use a pre-made pizza crust from the store for this to make it a little faster.

We just had this for dinner.  We loved the idea, but the crust was tough to bite through.  I pulled out the yeast packet and discovered it calls for 1.5 t of sugar for the crust - otherwise the directions are the same.  I think my yeast starved and I ended up with flat, unappealing crust.  I gave 4 stars because the kids all enjoyed the flavors of the toppings.

We absolutely loved this. We made our own hash browns. Also we made it the night before and just popped it into the oven. It turned out great. We will make this again.

I used bread machine yeast and let rise 10 minutes! I added a tablespoon of sugar to warm water! Added butter to crust after first 8 minutes of cooking. pre-cooked hashbrowns, bacon, and onions! Kids used salsa and ketcup...loved it!!! Very soft and flavorful!!! Think I might cut frozen butter in next round  for flaker crust!!!

This was just so-so in my book. I had bacon that needed to be used up. I also added another egg. The family thought it was really dry. The crust was somewhat on the hard side... We did end up putting salsa on top and that made it much better. Will keep looking for a better crust recipe.

So good, didn't have hash browns so I thawed french fries,  chopped them and turned out great.
