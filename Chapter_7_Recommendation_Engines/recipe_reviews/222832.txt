Zucchini is great this way. I do it all the time. I usually do olive oil and salt. I am not sure what grill seasoning is. I will have to look for it. If you have never tried grilled zucchini, you must.

What a great idea for grilling!  Slicing the zucchini this way keeps them from slipping between the grill racks.  Very fast, very easy!  I used Cavender's Greek Seasoning.  Thanks for the idea!

I don't generally care for zucchini because I find it relatively soft and tasteless.  But this I liked.  It still had some crunch and the seasoning (I used Montreal Steak Seasoning) gave it great flavor.  I scored it in a cross-hatch diagonal which gave it a particularly nice presentation.

If you marinade your zucchini or other vegetables in italian dressing for at least 2 hours before grilling you wouldnt believe the flavor youll have. Its addictive.

This is a GREAT recipe, I've been doing this for years too except I scoop out the seeds and fill the "boat" with chopped up jalapeno, tomato, onion, green pepper...whatEVER veggies you desire!! Top with the olive oil and seasonings and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese if you like...then wrap in foil and grill. AWESOME and a meal in itself!! (also good with crumbles of sausage tossed into the mix.)

Any seasoning will do but we like steak seasoning.  Excellent and easy side for a plethora of grilled meats.

I have been doing zucchini like this for years.  I use seasoned salt, garlic powder and a little paprika and then when I flip to the 2nd side I sprinkle parmesan cheese on and let it crust up a bit and then serve.  Fantastic!

I tried this on the grill today with some chops and it turned out great! I just used salt and pepper instead of grilling seasoning but it was still quite tasty. Also, I recommend leaving them on the grill a little longer than what the recipe says, but I suppose it depends on the temperature of the grill.

Why slave over a recipe when this one is so simple and delicious? I used the Cavender's Greek Seasoning and gave it enough time to heat and flavor but not so much that they softened. When grilling won't work, I'll just put this in the oven to roast.

Great zucchini recipe. The zucchini was not as soft as most recipes and the flavor was great. Plus it looked amazing! I seasoned with salt, garlic and dill. A definite keeper!

Awesome! I made it on my little Foreman grill, which isn't ideal because it's slanted and the zucchini wanted to slide off -- but I persevered and it was delish!

Easy and tasty.  Didn't have grill seasoning, so I used a combination of seasoning salt, paprika, garlic salt and Mrs Dash instead and it turned out great.  I also used a grill pan on the stove top, not an actual grill.

I tried this one on my husband who normally won't try anything new.  I thought they were very good and tasty - he thought they were out of this world and can't wait for me to serve them again.  Thanks so much for a great recipe!

This Zucchini was fantastic! I brushed the sauce on them as I grilled them. Kids(nieces an nephews) ate these without a fight. Are going to be a staple in this house. With and without my nieces an nephews visiting. I used grill mates garlic and herb seasoning.

Delicious and simple (although slicing zucchini lengthwise is tough without a mandoline). The best part is that this recipe's simplicity lets the zucchini flavor shine.

It never occurred to me to slice the zucchini long-way. This made them really easy to grill while I was already grilling chicken.  I cut them on the mandolin on the 1/4 inch thickness then grilled them 3 minutes each side. After putting some olive oil on them, I sprinkled with a jalapeño seasoning. This is a great way to do them. UPDATE: I’ve made these several times now since the weather has been perfect for outdoor grilling.  I played with different seasonings and found that Montreal Steak Seasoning gave the zucchini the best flavor.

Simple, quick and tasty ! Mine needed little bit of salt but that is due to the kind of grill seasoning used.

We really liked this one. I used Steak Dry Rub, also from this site, as the seasoning and cooked them a little longer as we don't like crunchy zucchini.  Thanks for sharing.

This is a great, fun, easy recipe!  I slightly modified it being that I did not have "grill seasoning" I used garlic powder, onion powder, mediterranean seasoning,sprinkle with salt/pepper.  The concept and overall method of cooking was perfect.  It turned out really good and my husband says "WOW, the zucchini is amazing!"
