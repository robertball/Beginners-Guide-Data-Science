This was delicious! I made it exactly like the recipe called for but added fresh tomatoes and mushrooms with the snap peas. I did think that I should have doubled the sauce with adding extra veggies. At the end, there wasn't much sauce and it was a bit to dry for my taste but I will definitely add this to my favorites.  My husband l loved it!!

I don’t know if we just eat more pasta than the average person, but I don’t believe this is 6 servings. It’s more like 4. But it’s really good, and super easy! I added mushrooms and used prepared pesto (about 4 tablespoons) but otherwise followed the recipe.

Add a salad and it’s perfect! I will make this again since we have fresh caught shrimp in the freezer!

I was pleasantly surprised at this dish. I honestly expected traditional “pesto”, but using lemon juice threw a nice spin on the dish and made it very light and fresh. I would definitely make this again!

It's a keeper. Husband loved it. I used refrigerated store-bought basil pesto and it was a quick prep. The pasta took longer to cook that the rest of it.

Fantastic recipe!  I didn't have fresh basil (who does?) so I improvised on some of the ingredients and also added some parm as suggested earlier. Turned out great. Make sure to include some bread and wine and you're doing fine.

Tried just the pasta and sauce portion of this recipe, but unfortunately we found it too overpowering in all areas (basil, lemon and oil).

This is amazing!!! Would give it 10 stars if I could. Even my 11 year old who hates mixed dishes ate it without complaint. An awesome weeknight dish. If you have the pesto premade, it just takes as long as the pasta takes to cook. A new family staple for sure! BTW my hubby took the left overs to work and ate them cold and reported back that it was just as good as it was the night b4, when it was hot.
