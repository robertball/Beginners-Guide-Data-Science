One of my favorite recipes!  It's excellent!  It's also simple to make! I've made about 16 loaves of it this summer (2005).  I prefer to make recipes with brown sugar rather than white, I like the flavor better.  I also preferred this recipe over zucchini bread recipes that call for molasses, which isn't an ingredient I normally keep in my house.  Many family members and also friends commented that they didn't care for zucchini, and were most certain they wouldn't like the bread, but once they tried it, they all wanted a loaf of their own, that's why I've ended up making so many (lots of zucchini from the garden is another reason why!).  This recipe makes 2 loaves.  I tried tweeking the recipe a bit by adding more raisins/walnuts/cooking it for a longer period, but my final opinion is that the recipe tastes great just as it is.  I also learned from a friend that I can shred the zucchini and freeze it in freezer bags, and make the bread fresh when I want, rather than freeze the bread itself, so I'll be making this bread fresh at Thanksgiving.  One more note, I do peel the zucchini just like a cucumber before I grate it...not sure what it'd taste like if I left the skin on.

This is a very good recipe.  I chose it based on the brown sugar and lower oil content, and was more than satisfied with the results.  One note though - the recipe make 2 loaves rather than the one that is indicated.  I made it 2x, and both times substituted dried apples (chopped) for the nuts as my 2 year old likes apples and not nuts.  The first batch was otherwise made as directed and was extremely good (I got lots of compliments from others who tasted it).  I also made another batch using egg replacer (Ener-G) for my mother-in-law who has a egg allergy.  She was absolutely crazy about it, and I had 4 other people sample it vs. the real egg and they all agreed that it was very good also - you can tell there is a texture difference though.  Overall this recipe is very versatile, with a lower oil content than others without sacrificing any of the moistness.  The raisins may help here - and btw I had several people who hate raisins compliment the bread.

Yummy!  I decided on this recipe because of the brown sugar... and I'm sure glad I did. I added 1/4 c ground flax seed to give the kid's some good Omega 3's, added a shake of nutmeg and used pecans. I also made a glaze to drizzle over the top. The texture was soft and moist, but not heavy.  The color was nice and rich.  Give it a try!

This was ok, but more of a cake texture than a good hearty muffin texture.  I have another recipe that uses twice the amount of zucchini (+carrots) for this amount of flour and is far superior.  I don't think I'll bother with this recipe again.

This was my first attempt at making zucchini bread. I was overall very pleased with the results. I only had one 9x5 pan, so I made one large loaf. I had to bake it longer than an hour (~80min), but I think that is just because my oven cooks slower than most. Next time I think I would prefer to try two smaller loaves. I chose this recipe for the low oil content and it turned out very moist and tasty.

Loved the recipe (especially the lower amt of oil and the brown sugar).  We're not real hot on raisins, so we added one finely chopped, peeled apple instead.  Turned out great. Definitely not dry in the least (probably due to the apple).

This was delicious... I added twice as much zucchini, but squeezed out the juice first. Very good!

The recipe is easy and doesn't use any out-of the ordinary ingredients, but it's way too sweet for my taste.  I'll make it again, but I'll cut the sugar.

Ive tried other recipes before and this one is the best.  I make it into muffins instead of loafs and they get eaten as soon as there cool enough.  I also use this recipe for banana walnut bread adding 5 ripe bananas & 1c chopped walnuts instead of the Zucchini.  Great recipe!

I was a little skeptical at first when this came out of the oven because it was quite dense. (I know the author noted it would be in the description). I subbed apple sauce for the oil to make it healthier, so that might have had something to do with it as well. While baking it smelled heavenly and I ended up giving one of the loafs as a gift. Well, I got a call the next day and received rave reviews. They couldn't believe I made it! Thank you Dawn, this will definitely go into my regular baking rotation!

This was great! Moist and dense. I had a lonely apple hanging out in the frig., so I chopped it up and tossed it in. Had a large zucchini which yielded more zucchini, used it all. Added some freshly grated nutmeg and a pinch of allspice, but not necessary to change a thing.

It was really good and went over well at a party I brought it to.  I used four mini loaf pans and it fit perfectly.  I added about a tsp. of fresh grated nutmeg due to a few reviews saying the flavor was just okay.  I also used pecans because thats what I had on hand. I only baked it for about 30 minutes at 350 instead of 325.  I'll make this again for sure.

This Zucchini bread is awesome. I added a little (maybe a handful) extra zucchini and substituted 1 tsp of the cinnamon for nutmeg.  It is very moist and tasty.

I finally found a great recipe for my zucchini. I substituted dried cranberries for the raisins and tested the bread after 50 minutes to check if it was done. This is now our family favorite.

Good base, and I changed it a bit. No oil - substituted 3/4 cup applesauce and 1/2 cup milk. Only 1 cup sugar. 3 cups zucchini. 1/4 cup ground flaxseed. I did not add the raisins and walnuts - I put chocolate chips in instead. Baked into muffins for 20 minutes.

This bread is fabulous! An excellent use for garden zucchini! I used about half oil, half applesauce to cut some fat, and omited the nuts and raisins. Thanks for the wonderful recipe:)

I made this recipe as muffins instead of bread.  They were moist and delicious.  I lined 12 muffin tins, filled them to the top with batter and baked them at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.  I also grated some yellow squash and carrots with the zucchini to make it more colorful.  I didn't use raisins or nuts because my kids don't like them.

I tried this recipe because it called for brown sugar, and I was out of granulated sugar. I also needed to use up my zucchini I had thawed out. I made these into muffins, and added in about 1/4 C. chocolate chips and 1/4 C. chopped toasted pecans, omitting the raising and walnuts I also only added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and found that to be more of the flavor I tasted once baked, maybe even less would've been better?. The outside crisped up really nice, but found the inside to be just a  little dry, even at baking for 20 minutes at 325'.

My bread didn't raise much, but the flavor was great. I loved the crunchy crust the brown sugar gave it. I did make some substitutions. I used coconut oil, spelt flour and fresh blue berries instead of the raisins. I will make this again!

I've been using this recipe for several years and love it.  One reason is because the ingredients are ones I always have on hand, nothing too out of the ordinary like molasses or honey.  I love the cinnamon and today I added 1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves, also substituted pecans for the walnuts.  Delish!  Have also used 3 cups shredded (and peeled) zucchini just to use up garden excess.  May try the brown sugar crumbled topping that someone else suggested. My son & husband didn't want to try this because they said they didn't like zucchini.  Then they realized this was Not like sinking your teeth into a big slice of zucchini!  They eats lots of it now & ask others to try it even when they say they don't like zucchini.  I love the recipe.

Everyone that tried this (and that's a lot because I've made is so many times - about 10 loaves this summer- because of a bumper crop of zucchini's in the garden this year :) ) has said it tastes just like their mom's.   Because I've made it so many times, I've made a few mistakes..one of which is cooking it too long (and another not long enough, ick).  This bread is pretty sensitive to drying out - so keep an eye on it and take it out as soon as a toothpick comes out clean.  I don't make it with raisins or nuts, don't like either in bread, and it's plenty tasty without it.

This recipe pleased everyone in my house.  The only thing I did differently was I substituted finely chopped apples instead of raisens.  Raisens aren't a favorite at our house.  This is the recipe I will use from now on.  Thanks!

very good, and 5 stars for 2 reasons.  1. it tastes great! 2. most people make zucchini bread to get rid of the huge amount of zucchini they have, and this one takes a lot.  I've used this to make the bread, muffins, and today, I added cocoa powder and chocolate chips, threw the whole thing in a bundt pan, delicious!

this is my go-to recipe for getting rid of all my zucchini!  i don't add the raisins or nuts, and use whole-wheat and graham flour (half and half) for yummy muffins.  the recipe makes about 2 1/2 dozen med. sized muffins.

This was the best bread ever!  I did not add the walnuts and raisins though.

I made this recipe exactly minus the raisins.  It turned out beautiful and looked great.  It tasted like a slightly tasteless cake.  We ate it warm with butter at dinner instead of rolls with homemade quiche and a caesar salad.  And we did enjoy it with our meal.  It was just not the moist sweet zucchini bread that I expected.  I will keep looking for the right recipe.

YUM!!!! The best zucchini bread I ever had. I took it to family dinner and there were no leftovers. To spice it up a bit I added a pinch of shredded coconut, some currants, some cashews and some almond extract. Everybody loved it, I think I'm going to make it again tonight and keep it at home for me and my little family!

This was my first time making zucchini bread. I figured I should peel them first. It turned out really flavorful and moist. It took about 2 sm/med zucchinis to get the amount needed. This is also good with cream cheese spread on top after you slice it (after it's cooled).

I love this recipe!  Instead of making loaves I made 12 large muffins and baked them for about 15 minuts at 325F and they turned out great.  The crumb is good, they were moist and flavourful.

Fabulous!  ONLY thing I did differently than the recipe was use Whole Wheat Flour and leave out the raisins.  I made 4 gift loaf's which took 30 minutes to cook. YUMMY! Thanks!

This zucchini bread is a bit lacking in flavor.  It is a good and dense bread, but pretty plain. 
Still looking...

First time make zucchini bread and was very intimidated....Not anymore. This recipe was super easy and came out amazing. I followed it exactly but omitted the raisins. It was a huge hit with my family. Will be making a lot more in the near future.

This is the best zucchini bread recipe I have tried.  I make muffins and freeze them.  They are great to grab for a lunch box or quick snack.  My twist is to use dried cranberries instead of the raisins.  So sweet and moist the kids will love them!

Oh, this is good! No need for another zucchini bread recipe (aside from a chocolate one!). I did use chocolate chips in place of the raisins/walnuts, and I added a generous pinch of several spices (cardamom, allspice, etc.) as I like things spicy. Thanks!

My family loved this zucchini bread.  2 loaves didn't last more than 2 days.  I liked it because of the brown sugar.  I didn't have raisins or walnuts and it was still awesome.

I am not a big baker but had farm fresh zucchini and wanted to make some bread. I came across this recipe and it sounded easy and delicious! I used the diced apple in place of raisins as one reviewer did and it turned out so moist and delicious. I love the brown sugar also and the nutmeg just gave it a great hint of goodness! Will be making this alot, Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

First time making zucchini bread! Tastes and looks lovely! I substituted about 1/2 cup of the 3/4 cup oil for apple sauce as recommended by another review. I also added a little nutmeg because I love the way it smells and tastes! I had to bake the first loaf for about 1 hour and 20 minutes because I added a bit too much mixture! The second loaf, a bit smaller, took 50 minutes! I didn't peel my zucchinis and it turned out great! Will make again and again!! Thank you!!

I tried this recipe twice because it had such good reviews, I thought I had made an error. But, I made it according to directions both times and it was DRY DRY DRY. I like a nice, moist, robust zucchini bread with a strong after taste. This recipe did not have it.

This was very good.  I had shredded and frozen zucchini from my garden and when it was unthawed it was very wet. I hadn't used any frozen/shredded zucchini so I wasn't sure if I should keep all the liquid.  I ended up dumping 1/2 the juice and found I should have left it in.  The bread was still just fine and not that dry, but I'll know next time to keep all the liquid to make it moist (as I think zucc bread should be :)   I chose this recipe for the brown sugar and lower oil content and it was very good.  I will use it again.

This recipe is delicious! My husband asked me if I could make oh, another 50 loaves! :) I substituted applesauce for the oil and it tastes wonderful! I also used 3 cups zucchini instead of just 2 and omitted the raisins and walnuts. I have a feeling I will be making a lot more of this very soon...

Look no further, this is the perfect zucchini bread, simple, cinnamony but not overwhelming with too many spices.  Very moist, the raisins add a great dimension to the bread. I didn't have nuts, but it was a 5-star even without them.

Suggestion- mix the raisins and chopped walnuts in with the flour; they won't sink to the bottom when cooked. Made this recipe for the second time. Great family project; children love to help, and we let them. Good recipe to encourage them to cook on their own. To Karen: One should be able to tell by volume that it takes two pans.

I didn't use raisons or walnuts, instead I added chocolate chips and pecans. I also replaced 1 Teaspoon of Vanilla Extract with Orange Extract. The ABSOLUTE BEST Zucchini Bread any of us have ever had! The brown sugar makes ALL the difference! Thank you so much for sharing this recipe, it is a holiday tradition in our family!!!

The recipe says bake for one hour, however at 50 minutes it was burning.
This bread was very dry and not very sweet.

After much reviewing of other's ratings~I decided to give this recipe a try. I was terribly disappointed (wished I would've stuck to previous one-Sophie's) with the taste (very bland), texture & overall experience.

I'm sorry, but this one just didn't do it for me.  It was not cake like as I expected, nor was it very sweet (and I used applesauce in place of the oil!).  Very heavy, dense and a little blah for my taste.  I won't use this again.  Thanks for the submission, but I will keep looking.

Just made this today. It is absolutely delicous! It won't last long around here. I love the flavor that the brown sugar gives it. I will be using this recipe for Zucchini Bread and sharing it with others from now on.

This was delicious. I thought it had just the right amount of sweetness to it and was very moist. I didn't do anything different, other than use melted margarine in replace of the oil and added some ground flax seed, just for the nutritional value of it (can't even taste it). Very good recipe and I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe and loved it. I used crasins instead of raisins. I also added a topping made of two teaspoons of cinninamon and two teaspoons of brown sugar. When I put the mix in the baking pan I added this to the top. My family loved it..I did not add nuts to mine. Will use this again!

I opted to make the recipe healthier for my cholesterol battling mother and so made the following changes: (1) egg beaters; (2) 1/2c applesauce, 1/4c oil; (3) 1c raisins (at least, love raisins in bread!!); (4) added nutmeg and allspice; (5) pecans instead of walnuts (fiance allergy)...the result? A very tasty health(ier) treat!!

I only made one loaf and made cupcakes of the rest of the batter. The cupcakes only needed 35 minutes to bake. Next time I'm going to grate the zucchini a little finer and add nuts, which I didn't have on hand this time. Still, quite delicious!

AMAZING. I made this recipe twice, once with rice four for a gluten-free friend of mine, and later with regular wheat flour. The gluten-free one was a bit thicker but my friend has informed me it was the best gluten-free bread she's eaten, and the regular loaf was lovely as well.

this recipe was so delicious. I did change some ingredients to fit my lifestyle, i.e. whole wheat flour instead of white flour, shredded carrots along w/ the zucchini, canola oil, nutmeg, brown sugar instead of white, and a drizzle of organic milk. YUMMY!

This is great.  The only change I made was to use half whole wheat pastry flour.  This baked in 55 min. in my oven.  My kids ate half a loaf straight out of the oven w/butter and rhubarb jam.

This is an excellent recipe; just what I was loooking for. I like that it calls for less oil, and uses brown sugar. It is very moist, and flavorful. Shared some w/ coworkers, and they loved it!

Loved this! I didn't have any raisins on hand plus I cut the brown sugar in half and replaced it with chocolate chips. It came out to-die-for! My husband whispered to me that he liked it better than his mother's. ;)

Love good zucchini bread and liked the fact this one unlike others had less oil to flour ratio. Used 1 cup white sugar and 1/3 brown sugar, but I like everything less sweet. Did add 1/4 cup unsweetened dried coconut too. Stirred in 1 1/2 cups blueberries instead of the raisins, at the end. BTW, I use only the outer 1" inch or so of the zucchini...the bread comes out more colorful...and healthy! In August I don't use the cinnamon, but when weather is cooler, will use it and the raisins.
Made 4 mini loaves so they could be shared.

I give this 5 stars!  This is very simple, and so good.  I especially like the use of brown sugar which sweetens just the right amount.  I made the recipe into muffins and just shortened the baking time a little bit.  Even my picky kids loved it.  I will definitely make this one again.

Used whole wheat flour - usually I adjust the quantity of ww flour when the recipe calls for AP flour.  In this case however the zucchini helped keep the ww flour really moist.  I added the zucchini without squeezing the juice out.  I let the whole dough stand for about 10 minutes so that the ww flour would absorb some of the moisture.  Worked pretty well. Was perfectly ready in an hour.  Thank You.

I ran out of flour and used oat bran (blended to powder form first) and this came out fantastic! My 2yr. old assisted and dumped a ton of raisins in it, and it still came out delicious. I look forward to experimenting by adding cranberries and blueberries. Great base for a quick zuchchini fixin'.

Very easy and delicious.  I pureed a can of fruit cocktail because I did not have raisins.  It was very moist and made a nice bread, almost desert.

Makes plenty, instead of using loaf pans, i used the round cake pans, and it makes 3 round cake pans.  Excellent!

This is the best zucchini bread I have ever had. I kept it just the same, but added a touch of nutmeg to make it taste and smell like home. Yummm! :)

I used 1/2 C applesauce and 1/4 C canola oil and made muffins for my baby instead of bread.  It turned out very, very well.  Not heavy at all!

Fine, but not great.  I added nutmeg even, and it's still pretty bland.  Unfortunately, I baked a triple batch of mini loaves, to give as Christmas gifts.

I made this for Thanksgiving, and it turned out wonderful.  I had to eat the first loaf the night before :)  added 1/2 cup chopped apple instead of the nuts.  thinking about putting a brown sugar crumb topping on this next time.

This is a great recipe and I never thought to add raisins, a tasty addition for sure. Everyone I shared it with raved. I love that it makes 2 loaves. When I bake I want lots. : )

I've never wrote a review before, but felt I loves this recipe! I put pecans and brown sugar on top and omitted the raisins. The second time I made it I added about five tablespoons of cocoa, half a cup of milk and half a cup of chocolate chips, as my daughter won't eat zucchini loaf unless it's chocolate. Both times it turned out awesome! Thanks for the great recipe!

Yummy, moist bread!  I wanted a healthier version so I used 2 cups of whole flour and 1 cup of white flour.  I added an extra cup of zucchini to balance out the dryness that whole wheat flour sometimes has.  I substituted applesauce for all of the oil too.  It came out wonderfully!  Moist and sweet.  I got many compliments and the bread was gone within a day!  I am making it again tomorrow!

It might have been wonderful BUT it says one loaf in the directions.  I was busy and cooked it like it said.  It ran all over my oven and made a terrible mess.  There are a lot of ingredients in this recipe and I wasted a lot of food.  Won't attempt again--even if it is great!  I did read a few remarks but apparently not the one that said "makes more than one loaf".  Disappointed.....

This is very good.  The only thing I changed was to use whole wheat flour and pecans as I didn't have walnuts.  Easy to put together.  It does make more than one loaf though so keep that in mind.

Excellent Recipe!  Very moist & easy to make.   I halved everything with healthier ingredients:  splenda, wheat flour, applesauce, egg whites, etc... Still came out delicious.  Highly recommend.

I typically don't like Z bread because it's usually so soggy and cinnaminny, but this was delightful!!!  I'm glad i read that it makes more than one loaf, but i only have one loaf pan, so put the remainder in a small square casserole. Like all fruit quick breads, i chilled it overnight before slicing.  It was heavenly!!

My boyfriend BEGS me to make this year round, and in the summer when we plant he is all the more excited.

I do use whole wheat flour, brown sugar splenda, splenda, and egg beaters where appropriate.  It does not rise as much as it could due to the chemical properties of the splenda but it is still SO delicious.

These changes he has NOT noticed and this bread is still DYNAMITE!

This was my first time making Zucchini Bread, and I was very happy with the results.  I made several substitutions and additions.  I used whole wheat flour instead of white flour.  Ran out of eggs, so I used 1 whole egg, and 1/2 cup of egg substitute. Used Splenda Brown Sugar Baking Blend instead of reg. brown sugar(followed Splenda baking direction and used half the amount of Splenda for the brown sugar ~ 3/4 cup), used Dried Cranberries instead of raisins, and added 1.5 banana's, mashed well (whole wheat flour seemed to make it dry).  Baked at 375 in two loaf pans for 40 minutes. We made it tonight and already almost through half a loaf!

great bread the walnuts can also be replaced with unsalted almonds. It was a great dish. Feeds many people can be frozen works very well in situations with unexpected guests. Best zucchini bread I have ever tried.

This is a very good zucchini bread. It is moist and has a good taste to it. I added a tsp of nutmeg and instead of nuts I used 1/2 cup of marashino cherries along with 1 tbsp of the cherry juice. Everyone loved it and couldn't believe that it was zucchini (even my kids ate it). Highly recommended.

Great recipe. I have looked for one for quite some time. This one is just like my Granny used to make. I will make this again. The kids loved it. Once I convinced them that it was sweet and not some sort of trick to get them to eat there vegetables.

I made this for my mother in-law; she loved it. I gave it 4 stars, because I didn't try it. Maybe next time.

Loved this recipe. I lost my go to recipe so I found this one. I added pecans and cranberry raisins. I made a double batch which gave me four loaves. Everyone who received one loved it! I also ran out of brown sugar so I used all white sugar. Not too sweet, just perfect. I had some massive zukes from my garden that were perfect for this.

This is a delicious way to use up all the zucchini from my garden.  I have made this twice in one week and it never lasts very long, my family loves it. The only thing I changed about the recipe is I used only 1/4 cup oil and 1/2 cup applesauce.  I have grated up leftover zucchini using a food processor and frozen for later use.  I already used one of the frozen bags and it worked great.  I will be making this throughout the year, thanks for posting.

This recipe was fantastic! The bread was so tasty and nobody could even tell that I put an entire zucchini in the loaf. Using grated zucchini was a nice way of making delicious bread healthy. The only thing I did differently was I used pecans instead of walnuts and it still worked great.

I'm not a fan of raisins or walnuts, but love pecans instead.  In the past I've made some zucchini bread with a canned pineappple zucchini recipe and macadamia nuts, which is my favorite.  I've also made a chocolate zucchini bread.  There are so many variations.

My first attempt at zucchini bread (zucchini from my frist garden).  Turned out excellent, and simple to make.  I am going to try it with cranberrys instead of rasins.

Yum....So good!  I traded out all but 1/4 c of the oil for applesauce like one of the others suggested.  I did not find the bread heavy at all.  I made one loaf and the rest muffins.

This was wonderful! I didn't have a cheese grater so I used my titan peeler to get the slices thin and then sliced them. Worked like a dream, and I ate almost half of the first loaf before it even got cool. My two and five year old both loved it. I will definantly make this again

i LOVE this recipe! my 4 year old is constantly requesting it, and i bake it at least once a month for the group home i work at. :) i usually make it without the walnuts and raisins (makes it a more generic crowd-pleaser), and usually have to bake it for longer than an hour. Great recipe Dawn!

I downloaded this recipe in 2006-I made it today, December 5, 2009-I looked up the recipe again.  I am glad the recipe has changed-The dough should go into TWO pans, I put it into one and knew it wasn't going to turn out-it was a dough ball inside. I will make tis recipe again because the outside was tasty-Lynn Adams

just tried a recipe just like this from an aunt, minus the raisins, and it was excellent. Just wanted to spice it up a bit next time, so thanks to another reviewer for suggesting the allspice or nutmeg, and substituting applesauce for oil, which i usually do, but this was a new recipe. Also wanted to add that i did not peel my zuccini, just chopped the ends off and ran it through the food processor and froze until ready for use. The peeling wasnt noticeable in taste, or texture believe it or not (was shredded very fine), but it DID show up and gave an interesting visual effect. Tasted alot like banana nut bread, and we'll be making this year after gardening year. THNX!

Everybody loved this zucchini bread, my husband doesn't even care for zucchini and loved it.  I followed the recipe but did not add nuts, I think I will try using applesauce instead of oil next time to see how it comes out.  But definately an excellent recipe.

Both my husband and I loved it.  I did not have canola oil on hand so I used olive oil - I will try again w/canola to see if there is a difference.  I cut the cinnamon as Cookiemom suggested.  Nice and moist.

I substituted real butter for half of the oil for better flavor, and next time I would CUT the cinnamon!!  It was so strong, almost bitter with cinnamon.  I guess it would also depend on which brand and how fresh your cinnamon is?  I will keep this recipe with these changes, and will try apple chunks next!

Loved this recipe but we are a chocolate house so I improvised.  I added 1/4 c. cocoa and 1 cup chocolate chips instead of the raisins and nuts.  The kids were surprised that it had zuchinni in it!  The brown sugar is a great add as it makes a crispy crust that is so yummy!  A definite keeper!

Yummm!!! Exactly what I was looking for, a thick, moist, and tasty zucchini bread. It was a little sweet but it was perfect. I left it in the oven for an hour and 20 min, and I used wheat flour instead of white. I also added a little nutmeg for added flavor. I will make this again very soon!!

Very tasty. Several people said it was the best they'd ever had. I made mine with whole wheat flour. It says it makes one loaf, so I made one loaf and it worked. The loaf was huge, and took longer baking, but I think I preferred it that way.

Absolutely scrumptious and easy to make.  Both my husband and my 2 year old son loved it.  The only change I made was to trade out some of the oil with unsweetened applesauce.  We did not find it too heavy and it was just the right amount of sweetness for us as we do not like super sweet desserts.  Dh and I ate a little piece for breakfast this morning.  This recipe is definitely a keeper.

This turned out great! I didn't have any raisins on hand but saw someone's  recommendation to substitue finely chopped apples. That was a wonderful suggestion. This bread came out moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again. . .

I had never tried zucchini bread before.  For this recipe, I omitted the nuts and raisins as I did not have them.  I susbstituted Bisquick for the baking powder, flour and salt and followed the recipe as directed.  The bread came out and is very tasty.  My toddler ate some and did not complain about eating vegetables as he usually does.  I enjoyed this very much and will make this again.

I'm always looking for ways to make recipes healthier, so I used 1/4c. oil and 1/2c. unsweetened applesauce. I substitued 1 c. of whole wheat flour for one of the white, and 2/3c. Splenda brown sugar, along with 1c. brown sugar. I baked it in a muffin top pan so that they could be individually wrapped and frozen for snacks or put in a lunch box. It yielded 18 muffins, which baked at 325 for 17 minutes.  They're delicious!

This recipe made moist sweet bread.  It was good bread, but I may try some other zucchini bread recipes to have something to compare it to since this was my first try.

This recipe was great as is.  I altered just a little, used 1/2 applesauce and 1/2 oil, also, 1/2 wheat flour and 1/2 ap flour. Makes a little more moist.  Freezes great, have to make 2 batches every time.  Thanks.

Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I added a little nutmeg to my batter and I cooked it in 4 small loaf pans for 45 min.  Turned out excellent.  I will definately use this recipe again!

LOVE IT! This was my first time having a garden and needed a recipe to help use up some of my zucchini. I took it to work they all loved it-- even the one person who side gross zucchini bread-- He is the one asking me to make more. The last time I made it i was short on brown sugar so I did a cup of brown suger and 2/3 cup of white suger it still came out great. THANKS

I tried this bread/muffin with butter and cream cheese frosting. I think it makes a better bread than muffin. Very good.

Thanks,

The best! I love the brown sugar, it gives the bread such a beautiful color. Also, I don’t know if I’ve just failed for years but my zucchini bread always sinks in the middle. It’s the norm. But this didn’t! Is as pretty as my banana bread!! Yay!!!

Perfect!
It was surprising that it turned out as well as it did.
Next time I will add a bit more orange zest but only because of personal preference.

This bread is so YUMMY.  I used whole wheat  flour and reduced the sugar a smidge.  I poured into cupcake tins because I only have one loaf pan.  They were delicious and they froze well.

I have tried so many recipes that I can’t even count. Because of our garden I am forever trying to use up zucchini. I always add more zucchini than the recipe asks for. This is my favorite recipe because it is very moist, I have added chocolate chips and have left out the nuts and raisins - it just all depends on who I am feeding. I have also used olive oil because I was out of vegetable oil and it turned out great!

Love it. I make this all the time as muffins because I like the single serve aspect. The only changes I make is I use craisins and pecans, add another tsp of vanilla and about a Tbs of China seeds. All my kids love them. My oldest would take them to school to share with her friends and teachers. Sometimes I add an extra cup of zucchini. It doesn't really change the muffin much, but I feel good about cramming extra veggies in there. Hands down my kids' favorite way to eat zucchini.

Sooooooo yummy!  I made some substitutions and added a crumb topping. 
Used 1/2 Applesauce instead of the full amount of oil, and added pecans--no raisins. Drained the zucchini.
Crumb topping: 1/2 c oats, 1/2 c brown sugar, 1/4 c flour, 1/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 c butter. 
Add the topping after 15 mins in the oven or else it will sink in the middle.

I just tried this recipe and it came out wonderful and everyone likes it. I am sure it would have been better but I thought it was too much vegetable oil and I used less but next time I make it I am going to use the exact amount and I am sure it would be moister. It was delicious anyway. My grandson kept asking for more. Silvia.

Not the best, not the worst Zucchini bread recipe. It was on the dry side, it lacked flavor. I chose this one for the brown sugar but I ended up being disappointed.


Edited to add:

This is a lot better on the second day, it was moister.  I added an extra star.

Excellent zucchini bread recipe! I didn't actually grate my zucchini...I chopped it very fine. I prefer the slightly bigger pieces of zucchini in my bread. Otherwise, I made no changes.

The Brown Sugar drew me to this recipe.  I've been making a similar one for years but thought it was time to change it up, see how others were making it.  I really like this one tho made some changes based on preferences (and habit).  I used applesauce in place of oil, only 1 cup of brown sugar (to cut back on sweetness), increased Vanilla to 1 T (not that it made much diff), & added a teaspoon of Nutmeg.  I used 1 cup of chopped pecans instead of walnuts/raisins since that's what I had on hand.  I made 3 smaller loaves and froze 2 to enjoy later.  It was different from my usual and very good, not too sweet either : )

Excellent and moist.  Replaced oil w/applesauce, used whole wheat/soy flour/wheat germ mix insted of flour for nutritional value, used 3c. zucchini, and omitted raisins.  Absolutely delicious.  Will be trying apple chunks next go round.

I chose this recipe due to the fact there was less oil than other recipes. I didn't have any apples, but will try that next time while reducing the oil amount. I used 1/2 c brown sugar and 2/3 c. Splenda.  This is delicious and moist.  I also used white whole wheat flour.

I've made about 6 loaves of this since I first tried the recipe a few weeks ago--I can't keep it in the house! My kids LOVE it!  It is very moist and flavorful without being too heavy.  I didn't have raisins or nuts, but it is still heavenly without them.
