My boyfriend and I made this the other night and loved it--the combination of mandarin orange and avocado was to die for.  I had to figure out how to toast pecans (ended up spraying a cookie sheet with cooking spray and baking them in the oven at about 350 for maybe five minutes).  We omitted the green onions because we forgot to buy some.  Made with baby spinach and used Newman's Own brand dressing.  Thanks for a great salad!

This recipe was delicious.  I made it for a girls night dinner.  All the ladies loved it.  The sweet taste from the oranges mixed with the avocado and onions was wonderful.  I added cilantro and lime juice to give it a more latin taste.  I would definetly make this recipe again.

This is good. I tried this after reading the reviews and was skeptical, because I usually don't like pecans or italian dressing. Given all the positive comments and my desire to find a new way to prepare salad for dinner, I decided to try this recipe. I will say it was good. The mix of flavors (the sweetness of the mandarin and zest of the italian dressing were quite good)...and the pecans gave it a nice nutty smoky flavor. Thanks for this unique recipe.

We absolutely loved this.  I used Zesty Italian dresing and followed the recipe to the letter, and it was wonderful.  It's the perfect salad to serve with Hawaiian Chicken.  The only slight change I made was I used refrigerated mandarin orange fruit cups instead of canned.  Since they were already chilled, I was able to serve the salad immediately rather than refrigerate it.

It was good, but this definitely didn't make enough for 8. Maybe 4.

This was very yummy. I made my own dressing and it was so good. I will make this again.

Homemade dressing would be better. Store bought Italian dressing ruins this salad
