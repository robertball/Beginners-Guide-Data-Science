Incredibly yummy. Really good without the lemon mint sauce, but the sauce takes this to another level.

Yum, turned out really tasty, although I was too lazy to do the mint in a mortar/pestle. Really felt it needed a big drizzle of olive oil on top! I had the heat on a little low and the carrots were a bit firmer and not mushy... preferred it that way. Flavors were better the next day, but carrots got softer.

Good Soup, next time I would cook the carrots and celery with the onions at the beginning.  The yogurt was not worth the effort, a good dollop of EVOO and some Parmesan was a better topper. Overall worth making again.

This is the first time for me to make red lentil anything, but I can tell you this soup has made a lentil fan out of me.  My hubby and I enjoyed this tasty soup.  Though have to say, not a fan of the sauce.  Maybe it was the yogurt I used, but something wasn't right about it.  We just topped ours with a dollop of sour cream and Aged Italian Cheese Blend...so, so good!  Another Chef John winner recipe.  Thanks!!!!

Absolutely Loved it. Recipe very similar but BETTER than one Iâ€™ve used in the past from The NY Times. Chef John is the best.

Made it exactly as the recipe called for. My tomato paste didn't look like the one in the movie when it was cooking, maybe I didn't put as much as Chef John did or perhaps my onion amount as larger. In any case, I struggled to watch it turn to that red brick color as it was cooking. Nonetheless, the final product came out fabulous. I ground my own cumin in a mortar and pestle because I find the flavor is way bolder than with the store bought stuff. Will definitely make it again, a nice change from the brown/green lentil recipes I have made in the past

Easy, healthy. One thing, though --  30 minutes is a long time for this simmer uncovered -- it will reduce all your liquid.  I simmered for 15 minutes partially covered, -- shut off heat and just covered it to finish softening lentils.  Or, you can add more stock. Grateful I had all ingredients. I get a lot of mint during summer -- I clip, rinse and freeze in vac paks to have on hand. Red lentils are great because they have none or less skin hence they do cook quicker.

Fantastic!  Couldn't find mint anywhere so used parsley instead.  Still had the citrusy colourful aspect of the sauce and worked fine.

Nice soup but I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to remove some of the soup and blend separately then add back..  blending it in the same pot like the video, resulted in an ugly mush all over with hardly any whole lentils left.. otherwise the taste is nice and recommended

I added extra vegetables, like carrots and squash and mushrooms.  I also did not have chicken stock but I had some veg stock from a disaster refried beans experiment on the Instant pot.  Turned out great.

DELICIOUS. made it without the broth for a vegetarian friend of mine. By the end everyone was begging for more and we finished a large pot in one sitting between just four of us!

I love this healthy soup.  The only change I made was instead of adding lemon yogurt and mint, I used a dab of sour cream.  Delish!

This is an amazing meal, and I will be making it quite often from now on. Here were my mods: Added a little spicy curry powder with the cumin and cayenne. Also, added some diced mushrooms with the carrot and celery. But the mushrooms did not add anything really, so not sure I would do that again. But the curry powder was a great addition imo. Love this (Picture wont upload for some reason but still amazing)
