This is a family favorite for a quick light summer dessert. I use whatever fruit I have on hand and it is always a hit.

I had purchased some blueberries and strawberries and realized, I wouldn't have time to eat them all.  I tried this recipe for two smaller tartlets instead and LOVED it!  I'm a beginner baker so anything easy is great.  I used strawberry cream cheese instead of regular and used strawberries and blueberries, and because I used the smaller dishes (and made approx half the recipe) the baking time was cut down to about 16-19 minutes.    Overall:  Really easy and tasty!!

Great quick dessert. Very versatile. I used half regular cream cheese and half strawberry, and topped it with blueberries and strawberries rather then plums. Will definitely continue to use this recipe and try with other fruits.

I follwed the recipe exactly and it came out just perfect! It is the best plum recipe I've tried so far. It's especially good warm. YUM!
