I'm the recipe author and I love this recipe so much, and hope that you will, too. Shichimi togarashi is a Japanese seven-spice blend which includes ground red pepper...you can sub with any ground red pepper, like cayenne. Using the Japanese version gives it a different type of spicy flavor, but it will essentially be very similar. There's another spice called Ichimi togarashi, which is just ground red chile pepper. Please comment with any questions or let me know what you think!

Made this tonight for the family. WOW. We were considering Chinese takeout and decided to cook in. This goes into the rotation, and fyi, no leftovers because everyone basically inhaled it, so you may want to double the recipe.

I put my twist on it. I made a Sriracha Aioli and Thai Chili Sauce. I mix equal parts.
