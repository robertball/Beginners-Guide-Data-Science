As a native Korean, I knew that it's not an authentic Korean recipe, but enjoyed the taste! To make it more Korean, you could put the chicken with bones and add Dangmyun (noodles made of sweet potato starch) and fresh green chilies cut into small pieces.

This was good.  I added extra garlic, used boneless skinless breasts, omitted MSG, and at the end I added crushed red pepper for more kick.  Also grew tired trying to crush the sesame seeds so left them mostly whole.  I liked this a lot, served over rice, would make again.

I loved this. My variations: didn't have MSG, and used 2 lbs of boneless skinless chicken instead of a 3 lb. bird. Fantastic and delicious!

It was pretty good. I feel like the sesame was a bit overpowering for some reason, but I enjoyed it anyway.

I also skipped the MSG and used boneless chicken breasts.  We all enjoyed this and my son gave it 5 stars.

this was great!!  I used the same amount of "stuff" but with just three boneless chicken breasts.  Also left out the MSG and didn't really crush the sesame seeds.  My husband is Korean (I'm not) and he said "this really tastes Korean... but I don't know why!"  REALLY yummy.  I might make even more sauce next time to pour over the rice.
