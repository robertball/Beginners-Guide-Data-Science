These are a quick & easy snack or desert after a tex-mex dinner. To make it even easier use spray margarine. Will make these often thanks!

Super easy and very tasty. I ended up using extra sugar after the first batch to give them a sweeter flavor. Had lots of compliments from the shower guests where I served these. Served with Raspberry Jam for dipping. EXCELLENT snack for kids to help with. My 12 year old did the majority of these!

These are easy and very tasty! I tried another variation - brush with melted butter and shake on a mixture of grated parmesan cheese minced garlic (from the jar) and a bit of cayenne pepper. This was savory and would be good in place of crackers.

You can also make these by cutting tortillas into triangles or squares and then spraying them with cooking spray before sprinkling with the sugar and they are delicious!

I have made these for years with tortillas on cutting board..spray tortilla with cooking spray and then brush on butter..sprinkle with a lot of cinn & sugar flip over and repeat..cut with pizza cutter if desired..I lay cooling racks across my cookie sheet..then place tortillas on top..and put in oven. They will crisp up very nice but watch close so they do not burn. When I take them out I spread on a thin coat of butter and drizzle with a little honey. This is my little cinnamon crisp recipe...thought it might help..

We loved these! I used brown sugar and cinnamon on top and they were perfect. It's such an easy dessert. We ate them with vanilla ice cream and now my boyfriend always asks for them.

These were delicious. You can't make an easier dessert and it's perfect if you have leftover wonton wrappers. Just be sure to watch them carefully. There's a fine line between done and burnt.

We didn't really care for these. They weren't very kid friendly either --they broke in very sharp edges when the kids would bite into them. Also they don't keep well at all. This was a simple creative way to use wonton wrappers but I'll save mine to use for other recipes. Thanks.

WOW. These were incredibly delicious. I was looking for a recipe to use up all my leftover wonton wrappers and this looked like it basically couldn't go wrong. and i was right! it was awesome a really quick snack and also sweet but relatively healthy. my dad loved these so much i'm going to get more wonton wrappers just to make more of these and maybe we'll play around with it a bit (my dad said something about apple pie filling?). thanks so much for putting this up it's so delicious!

So easy and YUMMY!!! So I did my first batch using splenda and they are eh ok but nothing to really satisfy. The second batch I did half sugar and half splenda and they were soooooo much better! I would suggest not using splenda at all! Real sugar just adds amazing texture and depth of flavor that splenda just can't. The splenda kind is ok but the sugar kind is WOW!

This is such an easy and tasty snack to make! I usually add a little more cinnamon sugar when I make it though. It's a great way to use up leftover wonton wrappers!

These were very good but I wanted them a little crunchier. I tried a batch for a little longer but they were on the burnt side. They still tasted good. Next time I may stick to tortillas but using wontons made that step so much faster!

These were actually pretty good. I was suprised. My kids and hubby liked them too. It was a great snack to eat while watching the hockey game...I ate mine upside down so they would taste a little sweeter. I think next time I am going to dip in butter (both sides) and then roll around in cinnamon sugar so both sides are coated. then I would flip them half way thru cooking...I will make these again.

Really easy but mine got a little burnt so it completely ruined the taste. I'm going to retry them because they definitely have potential.

These are very good. I used "I can't Believe It's Not Butter" spray on the wontons to take out the fat & calories and it worked just fine. You can even use spray Crisco or butter flavored Pam! It's basically only there for 'glue' to get the cinnamon/sugar to stick. Also they taste a little like giant corn flakes to me. Maybe it was the brand of won ton wrappers. Here's another recipe for these won ton wrappers once they're baked... Lay a wonton 'cookie' on a plate. Then a big dollop of fat free cool whip and a big spoonful of mixed berries. Then another cookie cool whip & berries again. Top the whole stack with a 3rd cookie and dust with powdered sugar. Use the top cookie to kind of "dip" into the yummy goodness on the layer underneath. And so on. Before you know it you'll be at the bottom of your plate and calculating your calorie intake for the day to see if you can "afford" another one. Ha! It is a low cal treat and it's SO good!

Couldn't be easier or faster or better! Just be sure to watch them for the last minute or so they might need to come out earlier than 5 minutes. My 2 year old loved these.

I followed the recipe and the reviewers tips and these just came out gross. I tried 3x with different times and all the batches came out either burnt or doughy and once cooled were hard to bite and chew. Sorry.. not a good one for me or my family.

These were a nice little snack. I used spray butter and I'm sure more cinnamon sugar mixture than was called for. I found these to be much better when coating both sides of the wrapper. If you coat both sides make sure you remove from your baking sheet immediately so they don't stick. My 5 y/o granddaughter loved these. Thanks for sharing KELLYNDOUG!

These are so simple and so yummy! I had lots of wontons so I simply melted butter in a small bowl and used a baster to brush each one. Also put cinnamon and sugar in a plastic container with a lid and shook it to mix the two...then just sprinkled over the buttered wontons (no measuring). They were great! Quick and easy treat!

Easy and tasty! I used pre mixed cinnamon and sugar and just sprayed them w/ cooking spray instead of melted margaring. This was a nice snack and would be wonderful on top of a bowl of ice cream! A great way to use up a few leftover wrappers. Thanks for sharing.:)

I prefer these with pre-made pie crust. Spread the wrap dough out leave in the circular shape. Spread enough butter or margarine evenly on the dough but do not over-do with the butter/margarine. Spread cinnamon sugar on. Roll the dough back up then slice in one inch pieces. Or you can cut them in triangle shapes and bake open not rolled up. Place on plain casserole dish evenly apart or in pie plates. If left open in triangle shapes place on cookie sheets. Bake 350 degrees until medium brown. Watch bottoms so they don't burn. Cool and enjoy.

This is very easy to make. Personally I found it them a bit on the hard side but my friends really enjoyed them and asked how to make them. I think I prefer to make these using pie crust dough versus the wonton wrappers
