These wings were beautiful looking and perfect for guests.  Really easy to make.  Mine did not stick to the pan, but I also used a lot of vegetable spray.  I also used dried garlic pieces and some ginger powder in the glaze since that's what I had.  I put some extra garlic powder in the flour as well. To make them look great, let the glaze boil and throw the wings in the pan while it boils, a few at a time, so that the glaze coats the wings.  This does not take long - 3 minutes or so. I  also put the wings back in the oven for five minutes to kind of seal the sauce in, but this is really not necessary.  If you do this, you will have Showpiece wings.  I have made these three times now and people raved over them.

Made these wings today and I did add a bit more flour.   Made sure my pan was coated well with the spray and had no sticking problems.  I also added more garlic as we are garlic lovers. We liked the sweet and heat taste.   I will definitely make these wings again.

The wings are very tasty, but visual appeal is not there. I spayed foil but when turning they stuck and fell  apart.  I also eliminated the Asian Chili pepper for a milder taste. I will try again but will  use a rack for cooking wings and hopefully avoid the turning. PS: may need a bit more flour!

I just made Garlic-Ginger Chicken Wings for the first time.  Based on the reviews which said that the recipe is a bit bland I used the following ingredients for the glaze:

5 crushed garlic cloves rather than 3
4 tablespoons of ginger (there was no fresh ginger in the grocery store so I used ginger from the seasonings aisle
3 tablespoons of Asian chili pepper sauce
1/2 cup rice vinegar
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
2 tablespoons soy sauce 

The recipe says to boil the glaze but I did not.  Instead I dipped the cooked wings into the glaze and put them back in the oven for 10 minutes.

The glaze came out perfectly.  When tasted on it's own the glaze has a strong Asian flavor with just  a hint of spice.  After the glaze is placed on the wings the glaze is flavorful but not very strong.

This is how I fitted the recipe to our liking. I used 15 unseparated wings, doused them with cayenne pepper along with the salt, black pepper, oil and hot sauce. Then I added a ton of garlic powder to the flour when shaking the wings. I generously sprayed the aluminum foil-lined baking sheet with nonstick spray and cooked them for 22 minutes. Then I turned them over and cooked another 22 minutes. I then dipped each wing in the sauce and returned it to the baking sheet and the oven for another 5 minutes. Otherwise these would be overcooked and dry if cooked for an hour. For the sauce, I added another clove of garlic and used dried ginger. I decreased the vinegar to 1/3 cup and used regular white vinegar. These changes made the wings spectacular for me and my husband.

I made this dish last night, doubled the amount of ginger, and won FIRST PLACE at our Iron Chef: Ginger Battle party...  The sauce for these wings is tangy and delicious, and we couldn't put them down until they were all gone! I used 7.5 lbs of wings for the party, and doubled the sauce to ensure I had plenty.

I haven't made these yet, but suggest not using a garbage bag for the shaking portion--they're treated with insecticide...

Simple and delicious, I've made these wings several times and they are always a crowd favorite. I add extra garlic, but the recipe as it stands is perfect!

Some of the BEST wings we have ever had!  I baked them using stoneware and it was fine.   No tweaking needed on this recipe in our opinion.  Serving these at a Superbowl party.  Will work great on drumsticks too.  Deliciously done Chef John!

I may have reviewed this the first time I tried it, but now I have to say these are our favorite wings ever! Daughter came home to visit and she gave big thumbs up also. Chef John, you're the bomb! And the sauce for this would be great on anything-- thinking of trying it on shrimp soon. I don't even want to dispose of extra sauce, I save it for other uses. I follow the recipe exactly except a bit more garlic and more Siracha for heat, just a personal tweek. I make double the sauce to make it easier to coat chicken and I have found the step to coat with sauce and place on tray a few minutes helps sauce to penetrate but keep the crunchy crust. Super yum! This will be my Super Bowl contribution this year. Thanks, Chef John! We love all your dishes.

This recipe is THE best wing recipe I have ever had!  I'm making them again, now, as I am writing this review.  My only recommendation would be to douse your wings heavily in cooking spray, otherwise the WILL stick to the tin foil.  The only other very subtle changes that I made to this recipe was using peanut oil in lieu of vegetable oil when coating the wings the first time (i.e. before tossing them in flour) and about 1 tbsp of lemon juice.  Then, for the glaze, I added about 1 tbsp of Worcestershire, and I nearly doubled the ginger and garlic.  The recipe is amazing as is, though - I always have to fiddle with recipes a bit.

These are phenomenal wings. Perfect to every detail. If I had a deep-fryer available, that would be the only thing that I would alter from the original recipe. But the oven done wings are still awesome!
The only thing I changed, was to add a little extra brown sugar to make them even stickier. My boyfriend stood over the oven when they came out, and couldn't be dragged away. Perfect combination of flavor profiles .Kudos to Chef John!

I used this recipe to make chicken breast for salads. I like to fillet the breast in half, it cooks faster and a better portion size.  If you make breast like I did, you don't have to make as much of the first part (oil and hot sauce).  I brushed it on, then floured the breast halves in a container flipping it over and over to coat.  I sprayed the top with cooking spray and baked it on a wire rack to prevent it from sitting in it's juice while cooking. Mean while I made the sauce, I added a splash of sesame oil.  Double this sauce, you won't waste it.  I brushed it heavily on one side then broiled it until lightly golden and repeat on the other side.  I think this would also make a good glaze for shrimp too.

Amazing recipe...WILL make again forever.  I did marinate the wings in the oil hot sauce etc. for 4hrs first.  Followed recipe to a "T" otherwise.  These are the best wings especially when it's healthier not to fry.  They fell off the bone in a bite and are my family's absolute favorite now.

Excellent recipe, but i did change things around as i was preparing the sauce:  more fresh garlic and ginger than in original recipe, a bit of orange juice (still reduced it) and sesame oil.

Delicious - whole family loved them! Only thing is that we omitted the hot sauce as we tend not to eat spicy foods. This was due to personal preference but loved it just the same.

These were so yummy - I am dieting and the calorie and fat content weren't bad either - I am not a real big fan of hot stuff, so I did omit the hot and chile pepper sauce.  I added a tad more brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of honey - Dredging the wings like the video suggest really made a difference - thank you I will definitely make these again . . . Like tommorow!!:))

Super sticky, amazing wings. They did stick a little despite a lot of cooking spray, so I think the trick is to coat them with a lot more flour than you think you need, and to use quite a bit of cooking spray to keep them from sticking. The flavor is out of this world though and we'll definitely make these again!

These were very yummy and crunchy I added extra spice to make them a little bit hotter,and I seasoned my flour with garlic powder, ginger powder, cayanne pepper, salt and pepper(because I believe you should never coat anything in plain flour) but overall very good and quick to get together I'll be making them again. Next time I might try a boneless version.

To die for!!! I make this once a week.... ADDICTING!!! Instead of wings, I use chicken thighs (with the skin) so I double the sauce. I also like to let the sauce cool so that it has time to thicken before tossing it onto the chicken at the end! AMAZING! Ohhh and make sure to use fresh ginger. You can use powdered if you must but using fresh sends it over the top! THANKS Chef John!!!

As others have said, 60 minutes is too long for baking and ours were definitely overcooked.  Aside from that, these were pretty good - we still prefer regular old hotwings, but they were a nice change.

Very good starter recipe but i found the chicken a bit bland. Next time I will double the garlic and ginger.

I didn't have any rice wine vinegar so I substituted apple cider vinegar. I also added 2 tablespoons of teriyaki sauce. Baked for 30 minutes on the first side, turned them, applied more cooking spray and baked them for another 20 minutes (cutting the total cooking time by 10 minutes). The chicken was fully cooked and still juicy, while the breading was crispy. My husband is a huge chicken wing fan. He said these are the best wings he's ever had!

Really good! As some others have mentioned, you really need to put a lot of cooking spray on the foil. I did just that, and may do more after I turn them over, as they were sticking slightly at the end when I tried to remove. I happened to have fresh ginger on hand (which I rarely do), and it was excellent here with the garlic. I'd do these again. GO PATS!! JUST ONE MORE!!!  UPDATE: As much as I liked these, they did not have that nice, crispy skin. They were moist, though. Maybe this could be fixed by using a higher temp or just cooking a little longer. CONGRATS PATS!!!!

Delicious and easy to make. I used all fresh ingredients where possible. 
Only reason I did not give 5 stars, is the flour doesn't completely get "fried"...so some wings were a little powdery in texture....maybe I'll spray a little more oil  on them next time?

I wish I could give this 10 stars. I've made this chicken about five times and every time I can't believe how good it is. I've used wings, legs and thighs and I'd say the wings are definitely the best. It takes a A bit longer than season the chicken and put it in the oven but it sure is worth it. This is one of my favorite recipes.

Chef John has reignited my love affair with chichen wings. I decided to do wing night for my kiddos and made BBQ, lemon pepper, and these wings..but everyone wanted more of these and as for the other flavors , they may as well have been chopped liver. It was sticky, sweet, a little tangy and perfectly spicy. I omitted the hot sauce for seasoning, and used a tbsp of Sriracha in the glaze. I also thickened it with cornstarch, and deep fried my wings. This one is going straight in the vault.

This is the first time I reviewed a recipe because I just had to!  It was simple, delicious and looked great.  I just may become my goto recipe for my favorite piece of chicken!  I may add toasted sesame seeds to the glaze next time.

I am a big fan of buffalo wings but I have to say I liked the sweet-spicy combo of these better.  I don't usually dredge wings in flour before baking but I think that step made a big difference.  

My mom thought they were the best wings she has ever had.

These wings are incredible, but do yourself a favor and purchase precut party wings. I have never been able to cut them myself, even using Chef John's video tutorial.

These were delicious!  I followed the recipe pretty much to the T except I didn't have ginger root so substituted a heaping 1/2 tsp. of ground ginger.  I also didn't have Asian chile pepper sauce so I subbed Thai Chili Roasted Garlic sauce.  Like some other reviewers suggested, once I had tossed the wings in the glaze, I popped them back in the oven for 5-10 mins.

Very good. Not spicy so if you want spicy try adding more hot sauce. The flavor reminds somewhat of Chinese flavorings.

Made this for the first time tonight. Came out excellent. I used Franks Sriracha style hot sauce instead of the original cuz that's all I had on hand. Magnifico!!!! I will most definitely make this again for either a full meal or as appetizers. This is a winner.

Finally a Chicken Wing that is not flabby.
     I made this recipe EXACTLY as instructed. The wings came out of the oven looking ( and tasting) like tiny fried chicken pieces.  Tossing the wings in the sauce just made them better.  
  Be sure to use AMPLE spray when coating your baking sheets so the wings don't stick.
       These wings will taste great tossed in any sauce. The crisp breading holds up to even a thick sauce.

I significantly changed this recipe,and am rating it so I have a record of the changes, because my husband can't stop raving about it.I used 3# of the whole wing, uncut, I put 2T olive oil, 1/4 c hoisin sauce ,2 clove minced garlic,1t poultry magic seasoning blend 1/2 t cayenne pepper, 1/2 t minced ginger,pinch of black pepper, and 1T ground chili paste in a zip lock bag. My wings were still a little bit frozen, so I microwaved them in the bag at 2% power for 3 minutes.I 
 skipped the step of spraying the baking sheet, because I didn't use flour, just used parchment paper. Baked them for 30 min on each side.
 I made the glaze as per the recipe,awesome,awesome wings

Great recipe. I added some extra ginger and it was perfect. I took this to a wings cook off competition party and won after just my first time cooking, and I'm not much of a cook. Very easy and delicious.

I loved these wings! The only change I made was the chili pepper sauce (didn't have any lol). So I substituted Hoisin sauce and red chili flakes. They were so good and messy.

I used to make wings the same way (deepfrying) for the last 20 years now... after following this recipe the first time, I now just use the oven technique and my own teriyaki glaze or buffalo sauce; I thought the recipe glaze was not flavorful/salty-gingery enough, and only made about HALF as much as needed for a 4-pound wing pack (weight before removing wingtips for stock), which is still a tight fit on one halfsheet pan. At first I expected an hour in the oven would be too much, but the meat is juicy and the skin somewhere between crispy and chewy. I actually go with convection for the last half hour to crisp them up more. The flour coating gives just enough crust to grab sauce without getting get soft or soggy. Be sure to use cooking spay on foil for easy cleanup. And no oil-splattered stovetop to clean up!

I liked these wings.  I was pretty impressed with how well they came out in the oven.  I did put them on parchment paper, rather than foil and had absolutely no problems with sticking.  I needed about 1.5-2X as much sauce as the recipe calls for, and I only used 4 lbs of wings.  I also upped the garlic (5 cloves/batch of sauce) and used 1 TBSP ground ginger.  Otherwise I followed the recipe as written. I will probably make these again.

Made these with no changes to the recipe except using a different kind of hot sauce.  They were fabulous. A definite keeper. Thanks. The video really made me want to try this, glad I did.

I didn't use the flour. Also I let the chicken marinate overnight in the sauce. I cooked on the grill so it also go that nice smokey flavor!

Just another fantastic recipe from Chef John. It was easy to make. For those who had problems with their chicken sticking to the pan here is some advice. First off make sure your chicken is well coated with the flour. I put 1.5 cups of flour because I would rather have too much flour then not enough. Second spray your pans very well it will help when you turn your chicken over. This recipe was delicious. Thanks Chef John.

These were FANTASTIC. Took a little bit of effort, but we devoured them. So crispy and the sauce puts it over the top. We didn't change a thing. Perfection.

These are delicious, but I'm not big on sticky wings.  Instead of adding the glaze after they cooked, I added it before cooking.  

It takes more time, but after I dredged the wings - I placed them (on the baking sheet) in the refrigerator for about an hour to let the flour set.  I then made the glaze and dips the uncooked wings in it before placing in the oven.

The wings were cooked to perfection.  They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside almost as if they had been fried.  The garlic-ginger sauce was tasty. However my wife and I prefer a little more heat. Next time I'll probably add some more of the chile pepper sauce. I will also make more sauce in general as my wife likes her wings extra juicy.

These wings are scrumptdillyishes! My husband said "restaurant quality".  I agree.  The changes I made were more of the hot ingredients(because we like it hot), less sugar and no flour. We plan to use the same ingredients but use chicken thighs next weekend! Thanks so much for your recipe and am adding this to my favorite now.

Absolutely delicious, easy and tastes better than fried. I sometimes use the sauce and at other times I do not. Yes, the first half hour and you think you made a mistake, but after the turn over and the last half hour, lucious. This is a non fail recipe, honestly, I am not a great cook, as close to foolproof as you can get. I was so impressed, I put a picture on FB. Have used this recipe for years and just now saying thanks John, you are entertaining.

I was really tasty.  I used a lot more ginger (fresh) than required and tons of garlic.  I put both in a food processor with rice vinegar and chili pepper sauce.  I also tossed the chicken in the sauce and put it back in the oven for 5 minutes.

This is our favorite wing recipe! Don’t need to change a thing! I’ve varied the amount of hot sauce from none to the full amount and either way it’s delicious!  The sauce allows the crunchiness of the skill to remain foryummy unique  tasting wings!

Wow! Very easy recipe....crispy without the hassle of deepfrying. I did have to modify as I didn't have any Asian chile paste for the sauce....I subbed in the same amount of Hoisin, spiked with chile flakes. They did stick in a few spots but not annoyingly so. Thank you for this recipe!!

my boyfriend loved this so much he woke me up after working a night shift with chicken the next day and asked if I could make it for him. this was excellent and the sauce was what won him over. I did a sushi rice salad my mom used to make and green beans with a sesame dressing to go with this. definitely a winner in my book!!!!

My husband loved it! However it will cook the chicken for 25- 30 mins. I made some changes since I didn't have all ingredients. The chicken was seasoned as indicated in the recipe. However I used chicken strips rather than wings. I also made 1lb so  adjusted the recipe a bit. 

The sauce I changed since I didn’t have garlic but  I did have a very garlicky and spicy sriracha sauce. Used a garlic press to create a diced effect on  the ginger, about 1 tablespoon. Added 1/2 cup of rice vinegar, sriracha sauce, 1/4c Of brown sugar, teaspoon of sesame oil and a dash of amino acids. Put that in a sauce pan to bring to a boil. I sautéed a side of a broccoli  with white onions  and sesame seeds.

These wings turned out really well.  I’m wondering if I could switch up the glaze, I’m thinking maybe lemon, garlic and butter.

The sauce is very tasty and I will make again. The proposed way to cook the wings (in flour) results in mushy, yacky taste for the wings. Skip the flour and don't bake them. Grill your wings then cover them with the sauce.  Also the sauce is way too spicy. Use spicy sauce according to taste.

I used chicken legs. Will make again. Can’t recall if I removed the skin or not before coating. They did stick pretty good so take tips to avoid that.

DELISH!!! I've made this about 5 times so far nd it never fades. I add about 1/4 cup more brown sugar and lots of extra garlic. Instead of pouring the sauce over the chicken I leave the sauce on simmer, dip the chicken into the sauce and put it back in the oven for about  5 min. DELISH!!!

This is fantastically good and turned out perfectly. I’ve tried a few wings recipes recently and this was by far the best. Best method of coating the wings, best cooking directions for perfectly cooked wings and best sauce. If you want dry wings just omit the sauce, but I ended up adding it to all of my wings it was so delicious and inspired.

I made these wings tonight for the first time. This recipe is definitely a keeper. I added an extra teaspoon of ginger and put in 2 large tablespoons of brown sugar. Next time I will try grilling the wings on the barbecue instead of in the oven.

I had no problem whipping these delicious wings up! They were beautiful, crispy, and tasted amazing.  I will kick up the heat just a bit next round.  My family's only complaint, I didn't make enough!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used white wine vinegar instead of rice vinegar.  I simmered the sauce for probably 20 minutes to thicken it.  Tastes alot like a very spicy, very sweet General Tso sauce.  Next time I'll cut the sugar in half, maybe add sesame seeds.

We enjoyed these on Super Bowl Sunday.  My husband and I don't usually like wings, especially Buffalo flavored wings, so I decided to try a different flavor.  We thought these were very good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions and placed them back into the oven for 5 minutes after dipping them in the glaze.  I would make these again.

Made these just as the recipe stated.  I didn't care for the vinegar taste, and the wings seemed too "flour-y".  Meh.   The family didn't love them, either.  Just ok.  Prob won't be a recipe I'm saving.   Too much vinegar for our tastes.

You can always rely on Chef John. I’d never made wings at home before so I was hesitant but pleasantly surprised! I doubled the garlic and ginger per other reviewers and the sauce was perfect. These smoked a TON while cooking, I had to open all the doors and windows to prevent the fire alarm from going off. Otherwise, these were good and pretty easy to make! Husband ranked them 8.5/10 and I’d agree but definitely more of a 5 star than a 4 star- I’d give it 4.5 if I could.

THIS IS AMAZING!  These by far are the best wings I have ever made.  I used a pressurized oil sprayer as opposed to cooking spray, and only used 1 T of fresh ginger.  Didn't have the asian chili paste, so used Sriracha instead.  Otherwise followed as written--these wings are incredible!!   Chef John knocks it out of the park again!

This turned out wonderful! For the sticking issue I used non-stick aluminum foil and coated it generously with cooking spray and I had minimal sticking. I also went along with recommendations by putting the sauce on the chicken for the last 10 minutes of baking and used extra chili sauce for that kick. Great with carrots and celery!

I have to admit I was skeptical that these were  going to turn out.  I'd never made wings before and the video just made it look too easy.  Turns out, I was wrong!  The wings turned out crispy and very tasty and they were indeed very easy to make.   I had no problems with them sticking to the foil but I used A LOT of cooking spray. I followed the recipe to a T except I followed other reviewers suggestions about dipping the wings into the sauce and putting them back into the oven.  The sauce was good but I think next time I will decrease the ginger just a tad and maybe coat the wings more heavily with the sauce to give it a thicker glaze.  I will definitely make these again following the cooking style and maybe experiment with other sauce recipes as well.  Thanks for the winner of a recipe!

It tasted a bit burnt,  and once you add the glaze the wings go a bit soft. But overall a great flavored wing!

These wings are EXCELLENT! I prepared half the recipe as we are not too many. I must say that the sauce is worthy of all the stars. I would say that you can prepare it as dipping sauce for other items such as spring rolls. Anyway, I followed the recipe as is except that I cooked the garlic and ginger in a dab of vegetable oil as I can't eat them raw. I must say that it was so aromatic and delicious. OH! More important I had no red sauce or chili sauce (can't eat them). I used buffalo wings sauce. I thought it would ruin the sauce but hat to take the plunge as I can't eat red pepper based spicy sauces. LO and BEHOLD THIS WAS BEYOND DELICIOUS AND THE PERFECT MILDNESS for my sensitive stomach!!!! These are show stopper wings! I would recommend using non-stick aluminum foil and spray the oil over the wings and pan as well.

My niece and her friends devoured the first set of wings I made and they loved them so much and kept raving of the crispiness  of the wings and the sauce.  I am making this recipe for the 4th time in 6 weeks

cut the brown sugar in half. Still delicious. I did not have the Asian chili sauce on hand so opted for more franks. Still delicious.

I tried to go Palio as possible using half each of almond and coconut flour to bread, amino instead of soy sauce and honey instead of sugar. I also added  more franks hot sauce to the glaze. NO GUILT and wonderful! not as crispy but still browned good and dipped in glaze.

Holy moly this sauce is amazing!! I must admit, I just did skinless breasts instead of wings, and was gonna grill them. But then the heavens opened up with a down pour, so now I'm gonna bake the chicken. But this sauce is fantastic!! I just added the hot sauce to the glaze recipe, and added a bit of cornstarch to thicken it up. But good gosh I can't get over how good it is!! I'm not sure if Asian chile pepper sauce is the same as sweet chili sauce, but that's all I saw at the store so that's what I used. I have no doubt this baked chicken is gonna be sooooooo good!!

Although I didn't make this as specified, I'm giving it 5 stars because I followed Chef John's directions for coating, roasting, and basting the wings and they produced the best wings I have ever made! (And the least mess!) I made a honey garlic sauce because I didn't have ingredients for his sauce but his method led to crispy, tasty wings.

Another great recipe!  I did not have Asian chile sauce, fresh ginger or Franks Red Hot.  Instead,  I used jarred ginger and Siracha.  Despite that,  it was really different then what we are used to and delicious.  My husband suggested we use the glaze as a dipping sauce  for potstickers.  Thank You, Chef John, for broadening our horizons.  Also I forgot to say I used my oven on convection roast at 350 for 30 min each side.  Next time, maybe 20 or 25 minutes.

I made the wings with the ingredients as written and they were delicious. The only change I made was to baste the sauce on the chicken about 5-10 minutes before they finished baking. Then brushed the glaze on again. The baked on glaze got very sticky, just  the way I like them. These are my go to wing recipe. Perfection.

Loved this. Big hit with the kids. My only two changes were using plain white vinegar, since I did not have rice vinegar, and I left out the Asian hot sauce. My kids don't do spicy. Turned out perfect!

This is a great alternative to traditional buffalo chicken wings. The only change I made was to use baking powder instead of flour for a crispier skin.  I loved the sauce you toss on at the end so much that I drizzled some over my roasted potatoes too!

these were amazing wings! If I had one criticism it would be that the recipe doesn't call for enough sauce. You will also need more flour.

Great base recipe. Wings come out delicious/crispy.  i added orange juice, crushed red pepper flakes, more ginger and garlic, and sesame oil to the sauce.  finished it off with a sprinkle of toasted sesame seeds.

Good grief this was super spicy!  I made the sauce as directed and used on baked wings (using baking powder). The sauce was super thin and nowhere near glaze consistency.  If I make again I will half the spicy chili sauce as well as thickening with corn starch before using.

Unbelievably good! I used a little less hot sauce, but left the rest the same. It sounded like 30 + another 30 minutes of baking would be too long, but it made the wings nice and crispy. We loved them!

Very good glaze,  easy to make, and thanks for the technique lesson in breading.  I forgot about Shake and Bake.   Used a big trash bag to  get the job done fast.   Drumsticks should work on this recipe too.

These were delicious! I loved the tangy sauce! I made a couple changes though. I omitted the flour. Just salt and peppered the chicken, oiled the pan and baked. 30 minutes, then turned them, then 20 minutes more. Came out perfect! Then I added a tablespoon of Sesame Oil to the sauce. It made them taste even more Asian! Which made them perfect to me. I'm half Asian! Thank you for sharing this recipe! It will be a regular at our house!!!

the method of preparation, the presentation, and the crispiness of the wing, the way the sauce adhered to the wings gets 5+ stars.  they appeared restaurant quality truly.  I loved how easy these were to make, and I had no issues with sticking, thanks to reading the reviews of generously spraying the foil.  As for the taste, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  I followed the recipe exactly not altering anything.  the vinegar and ginger were the predominant players here; overwhelmingly so.  I did reduce the sauce a bit by boiling for a slightly thicker consistency hoping that would somehow cut down on the vinegar taste but it didn't.  I couldn't really even taste the flavor of the chicken itself because of these two predominant players.  maybe upping the garlic, or adding some garlic powder to the flour may have helped?  these do taste better after they sit a bit but even so, overwhelming presence of vinegar and ginger.  I do love this method of preparation though, and again the presentation was restaurant quality.

Loved this recipe and everyone at the party did as well! I did tweak the recipe a little by adding extra garlic, extra ginger and dried whole red peppers (small ones). I boiled the sauce on low to medium heat for an extra 10 minutes, constantly stirring to prevent it from burning, to thickened the sauce. Rather than pouring the sauce on the wings, I threw them in the sauce pan, added green onion (abt 2" in length)--adds flavor and color. Once the wings are coated, I stirred the wings on low heat for abt 2-3 minutes. It thickens, coats and lightly candies the wings. The green onions are delicious too! It was just perfect! Absolutely delicious!! I'm making it 2 more times this week for two different Christmas parties to come.  Thanks for the recipe!

My 11yo is obsessed w/this app and had is eyes set on this recipe for a year. Honestly, I kept putting him off, b/c I thought it was a difficult and expensive meal. The last meal he made cost me $100! The directions were pretty easy. We used a little more of the ingredients b/c we used more than 5lbs of wings. Party wings are perfect for this recipe. Suggestions for next time: use more hot sauce to coat and more chili pepper sauce (we like spicy), season flour with garlic powder, spray a little more cooking spray (the wings stuck a bit after flipping). Can't wait to have him make it again with adjustments!

Preparation suggestion: The video shows the salt, pepper and hot sauce being sprinkled on the pile of wings, followed by the tossing of the wings to coat them. I suggest instead putting the sauce into the bowl first, followed by whisking in the salt and pepper, and only then adding the wings to coat them. That way, the salt and pepper will be more evenly distributed across all of the wings. (In fact, some of the salt will dissolve into the hot sauce.) In contrast, as demonstrated, too much of the salt and pepper may just cling to the wings on the top of the pile that first get sprinkled.

I basted them when I turned at 30 minutes, and basted again after flipping a 2nd time at 60 minutes.  I lined the baking sheet with foil (for cleanup) then parchment on top of that, and they didn't stick.  Yum!

This recipe of Chef John's is the best!  So easy when using nonstick aluminum foil and nonstick spray.  I used Sriracha sauce  and Tabasco sauce for heat.  These were so good that they would be great for a party.  Try them!

Made it as is for dinner with guests, and all raved about it. After baking for the 60 minutes,  I set aside ~10-12 pieces from the 6 lbs wings I had to mix with Frank's Red Hot Wings Buffalo Sauce from a bottle. The sauce from this recipe was perfect in amount for most, and the other plateful made a fun complement so people had a choice. Served with reheated stirfried rice from leftovers, crunchy cold fresh salad, celery sticks, and bluecheese dressing. My husband said these Asian wings were the best he's had in his life- he loves ginger and I made sure the ginger was heaping tablespoons. Also I doubles the garlic.

These were very good and smelled even better while they were cooking!  I needed extra flour while breading the wings and should have used more hot pepper sauce.  They were still pretty mild with 3T.  I'll definitely use more next time .  I sprayed the foil very liberally with the cooking spray and had no problem with sticking.  I worried that one hour of total cooking time would be too much, but they came out perfect --  crispy on the outside and tender inside.  Thank you for a great recipe!

Chef John has made me a better cook. This recipe works best if one allows wings to rest in the sun awhile. This allows the tendons to relax a bit and facilitates ease in creating the brim letters

These are hands down some of the best wings I've ever had! Seriously, Buffalo Wild Wings can't even hold a candle to these! They are a crowd favorite and everyone always asks for the recipe. Thank you, Chef John!
Also, you can easily use your favorite favorite hot sauce and they turn out amazing.

I had a problem getting the wings to soak up the sauce. I'm wondering if doubling the sauce and completely submerging the wings in it would fix the problem. The flavour was mouthwatering.

We have made this recipe many times since we discovered it on Chef John's blog site FoodWishes.Com. Absolutely the very best wings we have made in our kitchen. We made them exactly as directed doubling the sauce. Make sure you reduce the sauce by about a third, from our experience, and the color deepens. We, also, found that preparing the wings the day before, seasoning them as directed with salt and pepper, and placing them uncovered on paper towel lined baking sheets and placing them in the refrigerator results in a much crisper wing. The refrigeration takes some of the moisture out of the wings and they are incredibly crisp and tender after baking. Make sure you use fresh garlic and ginger; we love garlic and ginger so we add a little extra. Lastly, use the chili and hot sauce Chef John recommends in his recipe video; it is worth the effort to find them in your store (or online as we did); the recipe is simply the best by doing so. Thank you Chef John for a wing recipe that our family and friends have requested many times over the years!

I've made this a couple of times.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, and found it good, but thought it could be more flavorful.  The second time I used 6 cloves garlic for 4 lbs of wings, doubled the fresh ginger and added a splash or so of worcestershire sauce.  Much better!

Two stars for the sauce. Chicken tasted like raw flour, wings should have been browned in oil, not spray. Will delete this recipe. Followed recipe.

I make these wings all the time. They are a huge hit at all my football parties. The only changes I ever make is to use either coconut flour or almond flour for my gluten free guests.  Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly. Most of the time I use regular wheat flour. This is a can't miss recipe.

I really liked these, but I wished I had put them back in the oven for a few minutes to let the sauce caramelize a bit - even just 5 minutes or so.  I omitted the hot sauce, and just dredged the wings in seasoned flour (garlic and onion powder, salt and pepper and a dash of cayenne), then continued on with the recipe.  I have a well-seasoned baking sheet that I use for baked wings, and I oil it REALLY well each  time to avoid sticking.  Probably defeats the purpose of baking if you're trying to create a "healthier oven-baked" wing, but it's worth it!

I baked the wings without breaking them.  I tossed the wings in the sauce and broiled them until they were nicely browned.

This was delicious. Made a few minor adjustments. After boiling the sauce and putting the chicken in it, I put them back in the oven for a few minutes and the glaze came out perfect. Then I added an Asian mayonnaise and drizzled it on top with some green onions. They were great.

They were delicious! My whole family enjoyed them. I did end up substituting the Asian Chile pepper sauce with Chipotle sauce instead but they all turned out fantastic even with the change!

This is an awesome recipe, a family favorite!  We have made it with wings, which turn out really delicious and crispy.  For a budget meal, we have also used this recipe for chicken legs, and it works great for less than half of the cost!  I like to cook the chicken legs for about an hour and a half, but otherwise I use the recipe just as it is.  Yum!

This was the best. My guy gave it a "five" yum rating.   Used a little more oil to keep the wings from sticking to the foil.  Used a Thai basil garlic paste as the Asian paste.  A little lime juice doesn't hurt either.  I think the sauce would really be good on grilled shrimp too.

I had some frozen wings, but I didn't want the same old buffalo wings I usually make. I made the recipe as written- easy and delicious!  Served with Classic fried rice from this site. A big hit with hubby- definitely a keeper.

Oh, yes!!!!  A keeper.  The only change I will make next time is baking them 25 min. per side instead of 30.  I didn't have quite enough rice vinegar so I used apple cider vinegar to make the 1/2 cup and it was not compromised at all.  These are great.

They looked beautiful and tasted even better. I did not have any problems with sticking to the pan. 
My husband is a BIG fan of these as well.

I rarely write reviews but this was too amazing not to rave about. I've never made wings because I don't like frying things, but these were just as tasty as fried without the risk of burning the house down. And they were easy! They were the hit of our sushi party, tons of people asked for the recipe. We didn't cook the sauce to save time... Just mixed, tossed, and threw back in the oven for 5 minutes.

I make these about once a month. Kids love them! I omit the flour and dust them with baking powder instead. A tip I picked up from another baked wing recipe to get that crispy skin without the thick floury coating.

I don't feel that the wings were overcooked at all with the hour cooking time.  I love the process of how the wings were cooked, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.   I felt there was too much vinegar in the sauce but my husband said he couldn't taste vinegar at all.  Shrug.

Great wings! I did not have fresh ginger root, so I used the powder type. Also, did not boil the glaze.  Just dipped the wings in it and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes.  These were some of the best wings ever.

Delicious! I doubled the ingredients as most have suggested for the sauce.  cooking 30 minutes on each side did not make my chicken dry as some people have stated. I will definitely make again.

These are wonderful. They came out crispy and the sauce was sweet and sour, just perfect.  I didn't have enough rice wine vinegar so I used a combination of white wine, water, maple syrup, and balsamic vinegar.  I used just a splash of each. Then wings did stick to the pan but I noticed as they cooled a bit, they came off easier.  The best wings I ever made!!!

I made these the other night and they are delicious.  We're not normally "wing people" and this was my first time making wings.  We live overseas and our oven doesn't keep constant temps so I opted to fry the wings.  Other than that I kept the recipe as is.  I'm making them again tonight (per my husband's request) and decided to make the following changes.  Instead of hot sauce on the wings I will keep the "asian" theme and use the Sriracha sauce.  I have been marinating the wings since this morning.  I'm also going to double the Sriracha in the sauce to bring up the heat to counter the sweetness of the sauce.  After I fry them I toss them in the sauce, remove and let sit for 5 minutes on a cooling rack over a cookie sheet.  This allows the wings to absorb the sauce and any grease to drip off.

Great recipe...we love extra spicy so added lots of cayenne and red pepper flakes. Used parchment paper instead of foil and had zero problem with sticking.

Tastes amazing I didn't have fresh ginger so I used ginger powder, even with that substitution the recipe was amazing so I could only imagine how amazing they will be next time we make them with fresh ginger, highly recommended!

This wing sauce is a great way to add variety to a get together. I hosted a get together where I featured several different chicken wing recipes and beside the standard buffalo style this was the next sauce that was raved about. It has a sweet and savory flavor that is completely different than the tang of the buffalo style. I really recommend trying this one.

Made twice now. This time I put them under the broiler for a minute or so to "glaze" the sauce. Wonderful, juicy and crispy. Just added more garlic to our taste. My only recipe for chicken wings now. My son prefers to use just Frank's and butter so we coat his share with Frank's and butter instead of the garlic/ginger mixture. Both are wonderful. Thanks, Chef John!

I thought the sauce tasted excellent (I am vegetarian so only tasted glaze - made for my meat-eating family). My family gave it 4 stars but I think that was a matter of preference. I love ginger, they like ginger. I give it a 5 for ginger lovers. If you don't like ginger and garlic. This is not for you. If you love them both as I do, definitely try this recipe.

My guests seemed to like these a good bit more than I did. They were good but not great...I put a little more soy sauce in than the recipe called for and that might have been the problem.

So for Super Bowl I thought that I would try something new and I stumbled on this surprise. I can not wait to share this with everyone that I know that can and will appreciate it. The only thing that I changed was to add a Sweet chili sauce for chicken instead of the chile pepper sauce (not supposed to have spicy food). Then the one thing that I did differently was after the chicken was done cooking I turned the oven to broil on 500 degrees f for maybe 5-10 minutes. It fished it off nice and crispy. A welcomed addition to the recipe box.

These are the best wings ever! I cooked them 25 minutes on one side and 20 on the other. The color was beautiful and the sauce was delicious! Family loved them and want to have them again!

I thought this recipe was good - my husband said they were the best wings he's ever had! I even omitted the salt and used low sodium soy sauce for health reasons and they were still delicious. Probably wouldn't do anything different next time. Thanks

Simply awesome.  I was worried they would be a bit too spicy, with both the Franks Red Hot sauce and Sambal Oelek... however, the heat blended perfectly with the brown sugar in the sauce.  (In fact, when next making them for spicy food lovers, I may *double* the hot ingredients.)  Oh: I was out of rice vinegar, so used a 1:1 mixture of cider vinegar and white cooking wine -- seemed to work fine.

Just made these for the first time. Didn't have any hot sauce, so omitted. Didn't have rice vinegar so used apple cider vinegar. Cooked at 350 instead of 400.  Did find they sticked a bit, despite the fact I sprayed the pan a fair amount as suggested in other reviews.  Will use parchment next time.  This tends to be much messier, as the grease will go under where the tinfoil would better protect the pan.  Solution: Cover pan in tinfoil, then place sheet of parchment on top. They turned out great! Crispy from the oven. Love it.

Just awesome! I only added a little extra Sriracha since we like it a little spicey.  They are like fried (but even better).  This is a great method to get a 'fried' chicken wing texture. Delicious sauce.  This is a keeper.

These are so very easy to make and over the top yummy!  What a brilliant way to prepare chicken wings without frying them.  The texture (crispy outside and tender and juicy inside) is exactly what I have been trying to achieve with oven baked wings. This has changed the way I do wings from this point forward!  

Thanks Chef John

So delicious!  It feels so healthy to eat since it's not fried.  I use less flour since I don't like all of the coating.  I have tried multiple ways to make buffalo wings and this is the best receipe with a yummy sauce that can be used for other meals.
