I'm re-learning how to cook. This was very easy and tasty.

I've made it twice and will keep making it.

I just love chili and I'm always trying new chili recipes. I was skeptical because this one doesn't have cumin. I mean what good chili recipe doesn't call for cumin? But this one is really good! I'll probably make this one again. Its simple and delicious.

Made a meatless, veggie chili by adapting this recipe by substituting protein crumbles instead of beef and sausage. Turned out very nice tasty. Kept all the other ingredients the same.
