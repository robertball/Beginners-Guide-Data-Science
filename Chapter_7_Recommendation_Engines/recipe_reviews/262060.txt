I made the exact recipe and it was very good. However I decided to beef it up by adding 2 TB of homemade beef broth(condensed) and 1 extra Tb of sour cream. Yummy Yummy....Ohh and this so easy I will be making this regularly...Thank you for the recipe.

It was a bit greasy  but I will make it again with leaner ground beef. I doubled the recipe but only used one bag of noodles and it still came out good. I wonder if it would be a bit dry if I followed the recipe as it calls for. I will make it again  ????
