Instead of the turnip, try a little finely chopped bok Choy...And add a little crushed garlic.

The only changes I made to this recipe were to add a bit of minced garlic and to substitute bok choy for the Chinese salted turnip. The stuffing itself tasted okay, but it pulled away oddly from the mushrooms, which managed to have no flavor at all. The textures of the two elements were completely incompatible. I wonder if adding something like an egg to the stuffing would improve the texture? In any case, I'd rather eat more traditional stuffed mushrooms.

What a neat stuffed mushroom. Next time I will add ginger and garlic and maybe a pinch of five spice powder. I will delete the turnip too. Make sure you serve these with an Asian dipping sauce These are a real winner! Thanks for sharing!
