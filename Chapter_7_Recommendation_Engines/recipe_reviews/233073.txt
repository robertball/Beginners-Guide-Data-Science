I didn't see the need for shortening, butter and oil so I settled on butter only, but followed the rest of the recipe as written and was happy with the moist, flavorful chicken.  Not quite the same as fried, but a good substitute.

I freaking loved this recipe!  I too omitted the butter and shortening, only because I didn't read the recipe while I made the chx. Got the concept, and was on my way. The chicken taste Exactly like the regular pan fried, and all the stuff stays on!

After coating, let meat rest for 30 minutes before putting in the oven. Spray chicken with Pam, instead of cooking in oil. I baked on baking rack.

Used flour since I had no cornmeal and baked the chicken for a full hour. It was moist, crispy and delicious!

Loved it!  However, we will have to tweak it just a bit for ourselves cooking time wise.  Like the skin a little crispier.  Pickiest critic in the house raved about it.  Husband cooked it.  Super easy to follow.

I didn't cook it hot enough in oven. I would turn it up a bit under the broiler next time. 
It disappeared quickly!

I didn't like it at all.  The breading was half baked.  Not moist like fried chicken.

I used just oil and butter instead of using shortening too. I also used soda crackers instead of corn meal, and I only used garlic powder, salt and pepper for seasoning. It turned out great! My family loved it!

I loved this but I did tweek it a little. I used Texas Crutons that have the garlic and butter. I crushed what I had left over with a mallet and added 1/2 cup of flour, seasoning salt, pepper, thyme ....deeeelish.
