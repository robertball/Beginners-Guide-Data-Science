Really enjoyed the complex flavors. A fun dish to make. We added a little garlic with the onions.

I really wondered about the combination of so many spices, but was ready for something different.  I also had chicken thighs in the freezer, though I had deboned them since hubs dislikes eating off the bone.  My rock pot is a Cuisenart that sautees as well as slow cooks.  I used it to brown the thighs, then let it cook on low for a few hours.  Before serving I turned back to sauté & removed the lid to thicken the sauce. I served over rice and with a large salad.  I did not use the juice of a whole lemon, as that seems way to much.  I drizzled about 1 1/2 T and it was just right for us.  Wonderful recipe.  Very tender.  Will make again.   Hubs doesn’t like dark meat & Im not sure he realized this was not a chicken breast.

This recipe was delicious. The only thing I did differently was to use skinless thighs.

I also added garlic. it just seemed like it would be needed. i'm wondering if next time I might make it with the skin off the chicken. it just seems to come off anyway and that I where all the flavor is.

I too added garlic to the onion cooking portion. Makes a difference!

This is sooooo simple to make. Took me less than an hour to put together. Its a really good weeknight quick dinner option. And not too expensive either. (I already had all the spices tho) 

It's PACKED with so much flavor. And the spice combination is exotic tasting to me. I served over rice. It was a huuuuuge hit and I will be making it over and over again!

This was very good. Garlic is definitely a nice addition and kalamata olives go well too. I will make again!

I made this exactly as written. The chicken is juicy and flavorful. Next time I make (and I will make it again) I'll leave out or reduce the amount of olives.

Made this for my family. Instead of using the oven I cooked it on the stovetop. I cooked the chicken in one pan and the other ingredients in another. Then put them together. Also made couscous with it. This was a hit!
