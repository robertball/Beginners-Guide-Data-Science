I did not add the jalapeno's ( HOT hot is not for me).   This is a great recipe if you like a not-too-spicy chili.  If you are looking for a three alarm chili or one that drains your sinuses, this is not it.
Without jalapenos, it's got just enough spice and "kick" without having to drink 10 glasses of water to cool off.
Good flavor, good consistency.  I've now made it three times and everyone has loved it.

I have tried many different chili recipes and this one is our family's favorite!  We did NOT omit the jalapenos and it is not that spicy!  My 3-year-old eats it. I adjust nothing and make it as the recipe indicates every time and its fantastic. Leftovers freeze well.

Nice easy chili, this is almost the same chili that I grew up on (with the exemption of the jalapenos).  I used 1 tbsp of cumin, 1/2 tsp of oregano and 2 cloves of garlic, although it coulda used 3.  I seeded the jalapeno and didn't find it that hot, so next time I will just chop up the whole thing and add maybe 3 tbsp. of chili powder (the way mom used to).  As with all sauces & chili make sure that you adjust the seasonings before serving.  (I am full from all the taste testing, so I had to skip dinner tonight, tomorrows lunch for me).  Thanks for the easy recipe Danielle!

I love this chili!  I like it thicker and add two cans of tomatoes instead of one, two cans of chili beans and two cans of kidney beans.  I do not adjust anything else and it turns out great!

Great chili! Try browning the meat in Guiness, it really brings out the flavor in the meat.

Ahh, finally!  I never could get the ingredients correct when doing chili on my own w/out a package.  I left out the jalapenos for the kids sakes.  I added 3 TBS chili powder, 3 cloves of garlic, 1/2 TBS of cumin, 1/2 TBS of oregano, and a can of tomatoes instead of the sauce (only because I didn't have sauce on hand).  I also cooked up my own pinto beans because I didn't have any red or pinto canned. Even if I didn't use the recipe to a T it gave me a base from which to build from.  I'll make sure and try it the recipe way next time.

I've never made chili before, and searched tons of recipes. Found this one, and SO GLAD I DID. I did end up adding more chili powder, but that was the only change. I loved that is was spicy, but not unbearable. Delicious, can't wait to make it again!

This chili was very tasty and easy, but not as spicy as I expected it to be.  After browning the meat, onion, & peppers, I transferred to a slow cooker, added the rest of the ingredients, and cooked for approximately 4 hours on high.  Very Good!

I have made this Chili once and it was very good! It freezes well! This week I was ill and my children defrosted a freezer bag of this chili for dinner and a neighbor came over to see how I was doing and had a bowl of it with the kids and asked me for the recipe! I did leave out the Bay leaf and the Jalapenos and replaced the diced tomatoes with stewed tomatoes (because I already had a can in the cupboard). I think the next time I make it I will try mixing in some ready made chili spice that i have seen at the store...But that is just the experimenter in me. The recipe is  great as is! Thanks!

Though this recipe is indeed "easy," it is not as flavorful as many other chili recipes I have had, some of which are available at the allrecipes website. It was fine, just not as memorable as others.

This chili is wonderful. It was spicy without having to add hot sauce, which is a first for me. Wouldn't change a thing.

Just tried the recipe with it snowing outside and it was outstanding! I tend to eat more chili the day after it's made and it is far and away superior. I have printed off 4 copies for friends that have requested them after trying some it. Great recipe!

This is a very good recipe,similar to mine.
When I make my chili I use 3lbs. Ground Chuck.
3 packs of McCormick chili seasoning.
2 cans (29 oz.) diced tomatoes.
2 cans (29oz.) Whole peeled Tomatoes.
3 Stalks Diced Celery.
2 cans Campbells Beef Consume.
1/2 cup Brown Sugar.
2 cans Dark red kidney beans.
2 cans Bushes hot chili beans w/sauce.
This makes for a real robust chili that everyone will love.

I've made this several times in the past 3 years.  It gets better each time...I often modify spices/seasonings to taste and add more peppers and beans.  Great recipe.

The best easy recipe ever for chili. Nice flavor and texture, perfect. I did the recipe to the T. This would also be a great mexican chili recipe, just add some corn and a can of green chilies. Thanks a bunch!

Fantastic! I made this for an office potluck; didn't have any bay leaf, chili peppers or bell peppers on hand, but I used 2 tablespoons of crushed red peppers and some paprika. On top of nacho chips, it was delicious!

This chili is such a hit and super easy to make. I did make a couple of changes. I used venison instead of beef and subsituted halfthe jalapenos for green chilis (too hot for the kids).

Delicious!! I have already made this chili recipe twice and my family has loved it each time.  The second time I used the chili to make chili dogs.  I made the recipe as listed but I doubled it to make sure there was plenty for my families hardy appetite and possibly a few left overs.

Excellent and easy!!  We didn't have jalapenos so I added some cayenne pepper (1tsp) to add a bit of extra spice.  I also added in about 3/4 tsp celery salt, and maybe a tsp of basil and oregeno.  Just to flavor it a little more.  I usually don't like to alter a recipe before trying it once the way it calls for, but I have made chili so many times I thought it would be ok!!  I'm sure it would have tasted good before my additions!  I only added spices from another chili recipe I usually make from allrecipes.  I think this one tasted just as good and was much easier!  Thanks for sharing!

I agree with other reviewers that it was very tomato-y, but I liked it like that.  This was one of the easiest chili recipes I have ever made.  I made it just as written except that I left the bay leaf out.

I get compliments on this every time I make it. I add more cumin and chili powder. I also add a lot of garlic freshly minced by hand. We also like it spicy so i usually use 3-4 jalapenos and 1-1 1/2 habanero peppers. I haven't found anyone yet who doesn't love this chili.

I doubled everything and substituted 4 fresh chopped cayenne peppers and 2 habanero peppers that I had sauteed in olive oil.  After an hour or so I added two more cayennes and two hanbaneros (chopped fine) and transferred all to a crock pot.  Starts with a faint heat and ends with a medium glow.  No leftovers, everybody loved it!

Awesome chili recipe.  I have been trying out different chili recipes on my family and was told  stop and they gave this  recipe 5 stars and two thumbs up.  My only changes were to leave out the chili peppers and bay leaf but did take the advice of Darren W. by adding the beer.  Definitely a winning recipe!

Very easy and good, but not as spicy as I was expecting (hoping).  I added corn, an extra garlic clove, kidney beans, black beans (no chili beans), and I substituted the beef for ground turkey.  I feel like there was something missing but it could have just been "corn bread" :)

This recipe is so quick and easy, perfect for a weekday meal. I used ground turkey instead of beef and upped the chili powder to 3 tablespoons. Everything else was the same.  I'll be making this all winter long!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is an easy and excellent recipe.  I have cooked this often.  The only thing I do differently now is  add an extra can of chili beans and about tsp of sugar.

If your home has more than one person living it it, make your life easy--DOUBLE THIS RECIPE WHEN YOU MAKE IT!  I had to make it twice in one week because my attempt to freeze some for a rainy day was thwarted when my husband defrosted and ate it after we had finished up what was allocated for "immediate consumption"! This is a great recipe--if you like a little more heat, add extra chili powder & more jalapenos.  :)

This recipes is great, I changed a couple things around, I used Mccormick Chili powder (mild), 2 jalapenos chopped up with seeds, 2 cans of diced tomatoes (one with green chiles) 2 cans of beans (1 pinto/ 1 kidney drained) I didnt use bay leaf or cumin. I like my chili thick and it turned out great with the right amount of spice. I will deffinately make this recipe again.

This was my 1st time making chili and it turned out great.  I added more garlic and, for the jalapenos, used 1 with and 1 without the seeds.  I also added a stick of butter and brown sugar.  The first taste is sweet, then you get the spicy "kick".  It was a great balance.  I also added potatoes.  Everyone loved it :)

This was the best chili I have ever made!!! It had several levels of flavor and the jalapeno did not make it spicy as I removed the seeds and membrane. I tripled the recipe for lots of leftovers and am so glad I did!! The only thing I did different was I threw it all in a crockpot and let it cook on low all day.

I could only give it 4 stars since I changed it up a bit.  I added extra bell pepper, an extra clove of garlic and an extra tablespoon of chili powder.  I also added an extra 1/2 tsp. of cumin.  In place of the jalapeno I added a can of rotel, which gave it just enough heat for us since we like spicy food.  With my modifications, this is a 5 star recipe.

I made something very similar to this tonight.  Since it was for the wife and kids, I couldn't make it too hot so I did not add any peppers, but I did make the following changes (it probably is about just as hot as it would be following the recipe).

1) As I already stated, no jalepeno peppers, or other hot peppers were used.  I added sme mad dog 357 Ghost Pepper hot sauce to add additional heat to my bowl.  If I was making this for myself or made a second pot, I would be adding in habaneros and ghost peppers however.

2) I used 2.5 tablespoons of chili powder, but 1.5 was regular chili powder, and another tablespoon was chipotle chili powder.  This adds that burnt chipotle taste and it's really good!  It also adds a lot of heat, because chipotle chili powder is 5-8 times hotter than regular chili powder.  For even more heat, use no regular chili powder and 2.5 tablespoons of chipotle chili powder.

3) I added 1/2 teaspon of ground cayenne pepper.  Cayenne is fairly hot, but extremely flavorful so even a small amount can add a lot of flavor.  For hotter chili, add another teaspoon of cayenne pepper.

4) I used 2 bay leaves.

5) Serve over brown basmati rice.  Even if you don't particularly care for brown rice.

This recipe can be improved upon following my changes, but I will still give this 5 stars if following the original instructions.  I like things hot and spicy, so my changes suit my personal taste better.

Such a great recipe!!!!  I made this last night and it was delicious. The only thing i did different was use dried beans which i made sure to cook beforehand  and also, i used flour to thicken it at the end because I like my chili thick. Delicious!

Fixed recipe as shown...very good. Several family members said 'a keeper'. I gave it a 4-star only because had to remove seeds and veins from jalapenos to please others...I would like more heat, but still good.

This was my first chili soup ever, and it came out great. Except for I might have used too much Guiness (a whole beer bottle), and I could taste a little bitterness in the soup, but it still didn't affect the flavor much. Highly recommend!

It was the first time I didn't use the ready made packets of chili seasoning, and it came out good!!  I didn't put chili peppers in because I didn't have any, and the chili was good, but not hot at all.  We enjoyed it!!

This was a standard base chili. I only had a small can of diced tomatoes and it had diced green chiles in it as well, and I used mexican tomato sauce (Del Fuerte brand) and added another box to make up for the missing diced tomatoes. I used pinto beans but I would have liked Ranch style or kidney beans better, but I think that a matter of preference. I think I used double the garlic though as it was minced in the jar and I used a small spoon of it. This did seem to be lacking something, some depth and some tang. I added some Cholula brand hot sauce to it at the table. Maybe a little cocoa powder and some vinegar or hot sauce is all it needs? This didn't make our favorites though, so we won't fix it again, but I did have fun trying out a new recipe.

This does have a kick, but not overwhelming. It's a very standard recipe, but great comfort food. Plus you can tell your friends you made it from scratch instead of buying one of those seasoning packets. Photo available on my profile page.

This tasted more like spaghettie sauce than chili. Way to tomato-ey. I had to add abour 4 more tablespoons of chili powder just to make it taste better.

I have never made chili before in my life and I am not a big chili eater.  We had a chili cook off at work and I won 3rd place out of 40 entries.  I was excited and my husband loved the chili.  IT IS WONDERFUL!!!

Very good Chili!! I especially liked the thickness of it and very easy to make...However, since everyone thought that it was too spicy (and I am not big on spices either), I reduced the chili powder but found it not spicy enough!! Very good with home made cornbread!

I have made this recipe for about 4 years now and it is always amazing! My boyfriend begs me to make it all the time! The only change I make is that I double the amount of chili powder to 5 tablespoons.

For a ground meat chill, this is quite good.  Can easily be modified with your own flavorings to personal preference.

I didn't add the jalapeno's, made my own chili powder and used kidney and black beans.  This was awesome.  My husband said it's better than his mom's.  Will definitely make this dish again.

This is a great chili recipe. I just added a little oregano and another jalapeno (since we like it TEXAS HOT), and doubled the beans and tomatoes to make it thicker and it made a great batch of chili!!

My husband made this for our church chili cook-off, turned out great. Heavy on the chili powder, i would say 2 tsp, max. We alsoused a tsp of serrono pepper and only 3 of jalo.

Awesome for being quick but the flavor wasn't there. It tasted like a can of tomato sauce with meat in it. So, I added quite a bit more seasoning to it. Hot sauce and even just a bit of hot sauce, beer and a little coffee! Delish! Thanks for the easiness of a quick dinner though!

I really love this recipe. Every time I make it, I get rave reviews and people are constantly asking for the recipe. Only changes I make: I like my chili to be meaty so along with lean ground chuck, I also add 1 pound Italian sausage which tastes wonderful. I'm not a big fan of chili beans, so I use one can of dark red kidney beans and one can of black beans, both rinsed thoroughly to remove excess salt. These beans give it a nice color and taste great. I leave out the bay leaf and jalapeno peppers since not everyone likes it spicy. I like to serve it with cheesy cornbread. Definitely one of my most requested meals!

Bears Vs Green Bay Game: This chili is so good, it has taken my "Bear's" mind off the fact the Chicago Bears are getting beat at the moment. I added some suggestions of other members.  I browned the beef in beer, adding the onion & pepper while browning meat. I also increased the chili powder, I realized after getting back from the store I was out of cumin so I substituted the spice with curry. I had some great whole tomatoes so I also added a chopped up tomato, and a can of corn, and  1 TBS of oregano. Yum Yum Yum...  You gotta try this if your looking for something easy for a cold Sunday afternoon! Of course I served it with corn bread! Happy Holidays!

This was so very good.  I used chili grind for the meat, and I used extra jalapenos since I was trying to use mine up from the garden.  I always up the garlic content, so I used a few cloves.  I followed one users advice and browned the meat and onions in a flavorful beer.  I added a can of tomato paste.  I couldn't find my bay leaves, so I left that out.  I used the white chili beans because that's what I prefer...but other than that I followed the rest of the recipe and it turned out very well.  I will make this again.

Fantastic! I added a 1/2 cup espresso to the chili and it just added a bolder and more smokey taste. Very good and easy to make.

An excellent base recipe.  I left out the jalapenos and found it still had enough kick.  Next time I will add a 1/2 cup red pepper as well.

This is very easy and quick to make.  It's a good basic chili, but I think it needs your own personal touch to make it great.  I found that it was a little bland for my taste.  Next time, I'll add a lot more cumin and a little more chili powder.  It is a good recipe for building on.

Great chili!!  I did add a can of tomato sauce and omitted the jalepenos.  Perfect for cold nights!  I recommend simmering the entire time to allow the flavors to come together.

Oh my gosh this chili burned my mouth up.  I think it was my fault though... I put a small can of diced jalapeno's in it, and it was more than 2 Tablespoons.  Oops, I read the recipe wrong and I thought it said 1/2 cup jalapenos.  It also was a bit too thick for my taste.  Next time, I will omit the jalapenos completely and add another can of tomato sauce.

This recipe is WAY too soupy. I had to reduce it twice, and it was still runny.

This is probably the easiest chili I've ever made, and hands down the tastiest! Anyone from newbie cook to long time cook can make this and feel great about it. Over time I've modified only one thing (jalepeno peppers). If I want this extremely spicy then I use a small can of diced jalepenos, and if I want it mild I use a small can of diced green chiles (mild). I've also used more like 2-3lbs of meat because I like it meatier. My husband and anyone else I've ever cooked this for says it's amazing!

This is a wonderful chili recipe, thanks for sharing it!  Like many reviewers I have come to customize it a bit more over time, but always come back to start with this "base" recipe.  Instead of messing around  with the peppers, I substitue these and the plain diced tomatos for Rotel's diced tomatos WITH peppers (or green chilis).  It takes multiple cans, but worth it.  I also use kidney beans instead of chili beans.  And substitute the ground beef with ground turkey, or cubed & browned Top Round.  We're not into the HOT HOT foods, so I don't change the spices at all.  These are perfect as-is and won't have your sinus draining while you're eating!

This is the best chili recipe!  I used 2 tablespoons of mild chili and half tablespoon of spicy.  I omitted the jalapenos and it was just the right amount of spice for us.  I saved this for my go-to chili recipe from now on.  Thanks for sharing!

Outstanding basic chili recipie that's easy to prepare. It is not the most flavorful chili but provides an outstanding base to tweak and improvise and make it your own.
On mine, I added a little bit of cinnamon, habanero peppers and seeds, a few extra peppers, and it added a little extra flavor and kick. 

Great starting recipie and excellent for those like myself that are just getting into cooking.

I like a kick and replaced chili powder with cayenne pepper. Worked for me.

Loved this recipe. I changed a few things like not adding jalapeños and adding brown sugar to add the sweetness I thought it needed. Also used chopped beef which I think made all the difference and added a more elegant touch. This recipe was very helpful and I will definetly be using it again fairly soon because it was a such hit. :D

This recipe does not lie - it is easy. I used this recipe for a starting point for my own chili. To take care of my family's likes and dislikes I made some substitutions. For my husband's dislike of cooked green peppers I omit those. I also omit the jalapenos. I then substitute the canned diced tomatoes for a can of Rotel. I also add a can of kidney beans. Chili comes out hot, delicious, and still a little spicy. Love it!

This chili was awesome.   Not only in my opinion but also everyone who tried it found it to be very flavorful with just the right amount of heat.  I would for sure make this another time for myself and company!

We are vegan so we used TVP instead and added more beans. I also love ground chipotle powder in here as well.

We doubled this recipe but only kept the original amount of jalepenos (and it was plenty hot enough for us!!), and while it seemed good, it was not as richly-flavored as other chilis I have had.  We added a little bit of Worcestershire sauce and some brown sugar, and when serving, added lots of shredded cheese and a dollop of sour cream, and it turned pretty amazing.  But the recipe as-is needs a little boost in flavor.

This is absolutely the best chili I have ever made and my family just gobbled it up.  They want me to make it again already and it hasnt even been a week.  I did have a couple of ideas that I am going to try with this chili.  We are going to eat it over rice the next time I make it.  I will let you know how that works out.  This is not too spicy and the jalaopinos add just the right amount of flavor with a little bit of a kick but is not too spicy!  Great recipe!  Thank you.,

I'm not into spicy food, nor do I like chili all that much, but I made this for a youth group function and it was not only a hit with the kids, but with me, too!  This is the only recipe that I use for chili now. It has a little kick but not overpowering at all. I follow the recipe exactly, except I leave out the green pepper because I don't like it, and it turns out great every time.

I made this last night and can I say this was delicious! I doubled the meat and used 2lbs of ground beef, 1 large onion, 1 large green and red bell pepper, and 3 jalapenos with the seeds taken out. I kept the 1 can of beans, because Hubby doesn't like a lot of beans and used 2 cans on tomato sauce. I let it simmer for 2 1/2 hours and it was delicious!! My 7 year old who doesn't like anything that isn't spaghetti ate a bowl, peppers and all!

Good recipe! I didn't have fresh jalapenos so put in 1 1/2 chipotle chilis in adobo. Nice kick. Also added some celery, carrots, extra garlic, and elbow macaroni. I'll make it again.

So good! I like to add more garlic and get canned jalapenos. Spicy, but not too much so.

Very easy & very yummy! I added a little extra garlic and omitted the beans (on accident actually...just forgot to put them in!) but this recipe was great.  Definitely a keeper!

I've not been very happy with the chili seasoning mixes from the grocery store and decided to give it a try from scratch. I don't like bell peppers and by son doesn't like beans, so we left these out - and our chili still turned out great!  2-3 jalapenos give you a mild chili, so add more if you want a spicier version.  Freezes well and is great in Frito Pie and chili dogs.  Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!

I made this recipe for 25 people and it was a major hit!  I did omit the jalapeno peppers and mixed in some regular pinto beans along with the chili beans.

This was delicious and easy - I did make it with Turkey Sausage - my kids loved it, but it was a little salty - maybe next time, low sodium canned goods (tomato sauce) and less chili powder

Thanks for the great recipe. I made this last month on my solar cooker and my kids loved it so much we have made it again. We are batch cooking it (about 3 times your basic recipe) and followed the recipe except for half of the jalapenos the first time.

The second time I used dry beans (about twice the recipe to stretch it) and double the chili powder to make up for flavor lost in the canned beans.

This coming weekend we will make another large batch for family on the solar cooker again at our family picnic.

Thanks again, I love chili, but this has had us eating it at least once a week without growing tired.

The recipe was great. I had to tweak it a little because I only had some of the ingredients (the cumin, chili powder, onions, tomato sauce, diced tomatoes and garlic) and I have kids, so jalepenos were out of the question. I used about a pound and a half of ground venision (All I had on hand). I didn't have chili beans, so I used black beans (tasted great with this). For the salt and pepper I used 2 tsp. of both. I had to play with it to get just the right flavor. Plus I only let it simmer for about 40 min and it still came out good. Thanks for the recipe!!

My entire family loves this.  I make it often for company and they always leave with the recipe.  It's so easy to make!  I do use 2 cans of drained kidney beans instead of the chili beans.  But other than that, it's my favorite chili recipe.  Sometimes when I don't have much time to prepare dinner, I'll cook the meat (in step 1) and then throw everything in the crock pot in the morning and keep it on low until dinnertime.

The only thing I did differently, was omit the jalapeno peppers.  After the chili was made, I garnished each bowl of chili with a slice of cheddar cheese and chopped cilantro.  MMMMMM!  SO simple, yet so delicious.  This was definitely a keeper!  ***** 5 stars!

Simple and delicious!  I made it for dinner one evening, thinking there would be more than enough left over for another meal for my family.  Wrong!  Hubby and my kids loved it so much they ate it all . . . and my kids are very fussy eaters!  Will definitely be making this again.

This was the first time I ever made chili, and I thought it tasted great.  I looked at a lot of different recipes before deciding on this one, and I'm glad I waited til I found the right one.  For my tastes, I would use a little more meat than the recipe calls for, more garlic (like 5 cloves), more jalepeno, and more cumin.  Also, I used spicy chili beans and instead of tomato sauce I used the tomato paste I already had plus a little bit of water.  But, as I said, it turned out great, and I'm happy with my new chili recipe!

This chili is very simple to make, my husband and I love it!!!  I always forget to buy cumin, so i just use chili powder instead, and everything turns out great!!! I usually double the recipe for leftovers, which with chili, is one of the best reasons to make it!!!

Made a big pot of this recipe for my adult sons and friends. They all loved it! Served it with corn bread muffins. Added some red peppers (the tiny little ones) instead of jalepeno peppers. Will definitely make again.

I  prepared this dish 100% according to the recipe, it was very good - not too spicy. I generally like my chili a bit more spicy, and will adjust accordingly the next time. I will definately use this recipe again.

This was so good. First time making chili and it was delicious. I replaced the jalapeno with red pepper flakes and it had just the right amount of heat for my family.  I 
used red kidney and pinto beans. Sorry I didn't take a picture.

Wow! I reduced the seasoning heat I only used 2 tablespoons of chili power not the 2 & half, and maybe 3 teaspoon of jalapenos. 
This is best chili I have ever tasted, I mean it was really good!

I was expecting it to be a little bit more spicy than it was.  I added Mexican cheese to it after it was done and used Frito scoops as a side.  Pretty  easy to make, my family enjoyed it as well

Not a bad chili.  I made a few mods to it like, 1 can chili beans, 1 can black beans and 1 can kidneys.   Good for a cold winters day, for sure.

This is a very simple recipe to make a really good Chili.  I followed the recipe exactly except I did not use jalepenos I'm not one for real hot, spicy food.  But the chili still had just enough "kick" for a good hearty flavor.  Great for a cold winter evening in front of the tv eating a nice bowl of this chili! P.S. add a little shredded cheddar cheese on top or a dollop of sour cream and your good to go!

Thank you!!  ; )

Just finished making and eating this. Made an account just to leave a review. This was delicious! I pretty much doubled the recipe, only used 2 big jalapenos, and adjusted the  seasoning amounts to my liking. I also used minced garlic from a jar.  Came out very flavorful and went great with a side of cornbread. Will definitely be making again throughout the holiday season.

Grab the tums!
The acid from all the tomatoes is still burning through my system. There was way too many tomatoes - it was like sloppy tomato soups with a bit of beef and chili in it - Completely overwhelmed every other ingredient. 
Also - I now have enough of it to feed a family of 5 for a week. I’m really disappointed that I wasted all those ingredients. No one wants to eat it.

Didn't mean to upstage my husband's tried and true chili recipe with "Easy Chili" but boy did I!  Made a few changes based on ingredients I had and didn't have: used 1 lb. carne picada instead of ground beef, 1 Tblsp. diced canned chipotle chiles and two cans of chili beans.  Browned the meat and then threw everything in the crockpot and cooked on low for 8 hours.  HEAVEN!  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

I'm a decent cook, but I've always sucked at making chili. My wife was in the mood for chili, so she challenged me to give it another shot. I'm glad that I did, because I hit it out of the ballpark with this easy chili recipe. 

My ingredients mods: 50% more chopped onion, green pepper, jalapeno pepper, and garlic, and two tablespoons of sugar to cut the bitterness of the tomatoes and tomato sauce.

My cooking mods: Wait until the last 7-10 minutes of the 90-minute simmer to add the (undrained) beans.

I shared this with a neighbor who used to be a chef in NYC -- she told me that it was better than hers, and she begged for more.

This is really good. I halved the recipe since it's only my husband and myself eating it.  I'm not sure I needed 1 and 1/4 Tbl of Chili Powder it was a bit too spicy. Really good flavor though and it was great for lunch the next day.

Hi 
I have made this chili countless times. I just wanted to say it is the best i have found. 
I make a couple of changes,
1.) I use Ground Sirloin.
2.) I use 2 Med Jalapeno Peppers and 2 habanero Peppers.

I also use this for chili spaghetti- cincy style.

I will Continue to make this. i have never met so eone who doesn't love it. Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I was mainly looking for how much chilli powder to use for 1 lb of hamburger, and this was the perfect amount. I made it even simpler and used the 2.5 tablespoons of chilli powder, a teaspoon of Cayenne pepper and 2 tablespoons of garlic salt.

Delicious, although I used dried jalapenos and only 1/2 teaspoon.  It was spicy enough, but not too spicy. I am on the hunt for the best chili and this is my favorite so far.

In reading the other reviews, i skipped the jalapenos (which I don't like), but the resulting flavour was overall bland. I added in 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper and a heaping tsp of dry red chilli peppers. I also used seasoned diced tomatos with italian seasoning. With some tweaks, it was really yummy! 
Also - it can take a while to get the meat browned with the green pepper and onion - definitely longer than 5 minutes. It might be worth doing the meat and veggies separate.

My whole family loved it! I skipped the jalapeños to accommodate my wife’s taste, and added just a bit of cinnamon and cocoa powder. I made it a day ahead to bring out the flavor.  Wow! 

I’ll be making some again this week for the Super Bowl.

Great simple recipe. I made a few changes. I used 1lb of ground wild boar (bought at Raleys) instead of the beef. I added some chopped oregano leaves (over a Tbs) and a 1/2 tsp of paprika. I chopped up and used an entire Jalapeno but cut out most of the seeds and core, leaving some in, and chopped it in a food processor. I also increased the garlic to about 3 cloves.  Then I substituted some Mexican spices I got on a trip to Santa Fe for 1 TBS of the chili powder.  The final dish is spicy (nice bite on the tongue) but very tolerable!  Added some salt and pepper. Awesome flavor!  Cant stop eating it!!

This is a great easy recipe but I did alter a little to spice it up and make it chunkier.  Here are the changes I made:  used cayenne pepper instead of chili, used fire roasted diced tomatoes (more flavorful), mixed red and green bell peppers and added kidney beans.  I also left out tomato sauce, I prefer my chili less soupy.   Sprinkle a little shredded cheese on top and it's delicious!

I browned the ground beef, onions, green pepper and seasonings in a frying pan, then transferred the mixer to a crockpot along with the sauce, tomatoes and beans.  I also added an extra can of black beans and half a tablespoon of paprika, and cooked it on low. Delicious!

Very easy to make and has great taste and texture.  Mine was slightly different.
- Instead of fresh hamburger  I used left over steak and a few day old hamburgers from the fridge (chopped up). 
- 1/2 an onion instead of a whole onion.
- Red and yellow peppers in place of green peppers.  
- Pomi crushed tomatoes instead of diced.

Once completed, I wanted more heat so I added 1-2 teaspoons of Tabasco sauce.  

Never made Chili before and I think it came out great, this recipe was a great starting place for me, not complicated at all.

I stumbled across this recipe while searching for a chili recipe  with ancho or New Mexico peppers. I gave this one 5 stars because it is nearly an exact replica of the chili I made early on when first learning to cook. Only difference, my recipe had Hunts tomato sauce w/tomato bits which is no longer available. It is a great base chili that is fine on its own but can be taken to a whole new level with some additions.

This was good! My mom makes an awesome "simple"  chili using only beef, onion, tomato sauce, and chili powder so the few ingredients in this one appealed to me. I didn't add a bay leaf or the jalapeños because I forgot to add them to my grocery list. Still very flavorful and very good but I prefer it much spicier. I think if you're preparing for those who don't like the heat it's just fine to omit. I also love to add toppings like onion and cheese but this was good enough to stand on its own. It was easy and chunky like I like it. Only giving 4 stars because I think it needs additional seasonings to taste. Overall, a great base recipe and I can't wait to make it again!

I changed somethings. I added a little onion and garlic powder. Used one can of red kidney Ben's and one can of pinto bean, both rinsed. I used 2 cloves of garlic instead of one. And added 1/2 teaspoon of cayenne pepper. I must say it's one of the best chili's I've ever made. YUUUM.

DELICIOUS!! Followed most of the recipe but went with half a red onion, 1 brown onion, used ground pork, added celery, cilantro, and pinto beans. Could use more jalapenos if u want more spice.  Will be making this again!!

This is perfect American family style chili we grew up on. Use a quality tomato brand- it makes a difference. I added a can of drained white beans as well. Delicious!

Enjoyed this just last night. We used ground turkey and added zucchini and more peppers. I omitted the jalapenos since most of my family doesn't like it too spicy, but added them later to mine. I actually think you could double this recipe, add more veggies and meat. In addition, I used chipotle chili powder and hot chili powder to kick up a notch. I like that this recipe is simple yet flavorful and allows you to really adjust the heat and flavoring. It was perfect dish for a family on the go. Got it ready and just let simmer for an hour and half while running kids and errands - came home to a great meal. Served with a cinnamon roll and kids were in heaven.

I followed the recipe but I added hot chili powder, 6 fresh jalapeños and a tablespoon of chocolate. I had made a crockpot full of pinto beans a few days ago and I added them to my chili. My husband says it is the best chili I have made!

When I needed something snappy so the kids could get to bed at a decent time after I got off work, I googled "easy chili" & this was the first.

Made this Easy Chili since I was house sitting and didn't have access to my kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised! It was awesome. I did cook it longer and I did cook it on the stove instead of the crockpot like I usually do. Awesome!!!

Simple and delicious. Making it was easy enough. I did add dried chili flakes on top of everything else to make it spicier. Instead of using tomato paste and diced tomatoes, I just used a large can of Italian spice diced tomato. Turned out great. :) Definitely will be making

I made this exactly to recipe and was perfect. Also added some cayenne oregano cinnamon and sriracha toward the end. Best chili i've ever made to be honest.  Topped with scallions and cheese.

This was awesome!!  The flavor was amazing.  I have become quite the cook so I know how to make slight variations to my families taste buds.  I put beef broth instead of water, rotel instead of plain diced tomatoes and lastly I had no clue what pepper sauce was so I used cayenne pepper.  This is great for a quick weeknight dinner.

I don't like spicy food so I cut the chili to 1 tbsp and left out the jalapenos.  That was perfect.

Also, I didn't have 2 hours for prep and cooking so instead of simmering for 1.5 hrs, I covered and cooked in the microwave at 60% power for 12 minutes.  It was much faster and a huge hit with the family.

This is the great recipe! I made it for dinner and my husband loved it. I changed a few things. I omitted jalapeno chili peppers (since I did not want it too spicy), instead I added a little bit of ground cayenne pepper  for slight kick (1/8 tsp). I increased the chili powder to 3 tbsp and cumin to 1 tbsp. I also added 1/2 tsp of dried oregano. I also doubled on tomatoes and beans (2 cans instead of 1). I did not put any bell peppers, because my husband does not like them. but I think it's a great addition to the recipe. It was still very good! Two thumbs up!

I make this in the slow cooker. After browning the meat and onions, I put everything into the slow cooker and cook on high for about 3 hours, allowing the flavors to mix.

This recipe was so easy to follow and is a great base recipe for chili. I exchanged the can of chili beans for a 6 bean mix and added a can of chick peas for more protein. I used ground pork instead of beef. And I added two tablespoons of red pepper flakes for spice, because I didn't have jalapeño peppers. Addition of red pepper flakes is just right for me but would be very spicy for someone who hates spice.

This was very easy to whip up. I used ground turkey instead of beef. This makes 6 servings and not a pinch more. Serve with Golden Sweet Cornbread for the perfect salty/sweet combo.

Last night was my first time making chili because my fiancé has been asking for it for months! I finally found a recipe that is simple and inexpensive. My family loved it. The only thing I changed was I added more jalapeños, tons of cayenne pepper (we love spicy dishes) and garlic powder because I forgot to add the garlic cloves. 

Without the cayenne this recipe is very mild. But I love spicy foods so I added it :-) 

I plan on making this again and again!

Just made this tonight. My husband grew up loving chili but I haven't made it because i don't have the patience to make chili for 4-6 hours. Finding this recipe was awesome, it's so simple and easy to make and the flavors came out perfectly. I made mine with 3 tablespoons of chili powder and with jalapeno finely chopped.  Hubby absolutely loved it, he's already asking me to make it again.

43 OZ OF TOMATO WAS TOO MUCH FOR ME. TURNED OUT TO BE JUST A SPICY (ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT) PASTA SAUCE.

Loved it!  I added a can of kidney beans.  It is surprisingly not that spicy given the jalepenos.  My two kids ate it without a problem.

This recipe is wonderful!  I made a vegan version by substituting TVP for the beef:
Tomato juice 6 oz plus spinach or collard green pot liquor one cup. Boil then take off heat and add 2 c dried TVP from your local bulk supplier. Allow it to reconstitute then save half of it in the freezer for the next batch. 
Use two tbsp olive oil to sautée the onions and bell peppers. Add the reconstituted TVP at the end with a dash of liquid smoke and a slosh of toasted sesame oil just to finish the meaty flavor.   
My vegan friends love it and I'm no vegan!

I just made this recipe today and it was very good and very easy.  I added Zesty Jalapeño Diced Tomatoes instead of fresh and omitted the cumin because I didn't have any and it was still fantastic.  I will absolutely make this recipe again.

After having my own recipe for years, I tried this, and my family loved it! I did *not* add the jalapenos (my husband and I don't like spicy things), but everyone still thought it was fantastic. And don't be afraid of all the tomatoes (I made this for 20 people, and there were a *lot* in the recipe); teenagers at the part who confessed to not liking tomatoes were thrilled with the taste. A keeper -- thanks for posting it.

This recipe was so easy and really turned out well.  I didn't have a jalapeno, so I used the pickled ones I usually use on nachos.  I also substituted 1 large can of tomatoes for 2 small cans of the ones with spicy red peppers.  Just enough heat to keep us warm on a cold winters night!

Has been the family favorite for a while now. I DO add the jalapeno, and I have no clue why people think its too spicy. However if you want a little of the spice but not much, just throw one jalapeno in whole!!

easy and great tasting chilli. this was my first time making chilli and so i was a bit skeptical of all the tomato ingredients used. i expected it to be basically a comparison to chunky tomato soup! boy was i wrong. mixed in with the beef, beans, etc, it was the perfect combo. the only thing i would change is adding less onion than the recipe calls for and adding more vegetables such as: canned corn and chopped carrots and using different spices such as: curry powder and taco mix. i will be using this again! :)

I used 15 oz of the diced tomato, and added 15 oz of water to the recipe... came out great.  It seemed like the juices would have cooked it completely out had I not added the water.

A good start to a Chili, but of course it was a little too bland for me.  I just read some of the reviews to this recipe and got alot of great ideas how to improve the taste and it worked!  I will make the recipe again using this basic start to making Chili.

This was DELICIOUS!!!!  Perfect for kids too. I left the jalapeños out for the children. The only change I made was to add more beans and northern beans as well, but that's just because I like a lot of beans in my chili. I also threw it in the crockpot on high for 4 hours after browning the beef. If I were making this for adults, I'd make it spicier. Yum!!! I found a "keeper"!

I really like this recipe cause it's so simple, and has given me a basic idea of what should be used to cook chili.  Of course I changed a few things to suit my tastes.  I put two cans of black beans in it instead of one can of chili beans; a whole jalapeno without the seeds instead of 4 teaspoons; two bellpeppers instead of half a cup; a whole onion instead of a cup; and a half pound of beef instead of one.  Yeah, my version is a bit more healthy.  Also, I've found that it turns out too watery.  So I looked up ways to remedy this: 
1. let it simmer without a lid so that the water can be released through steam 
2. add a small can of tomato paste
3. mix 1/4 tsp of starch with a bit of water and incorporate into chili, continue adding until it's the right thickness

With a few minor adjustments this has become a favorite in our family!  I used rinsed pinto beans instead of the chili beans, organic fire roasted diced tomatoes instead of regular, and instead of plain tomato sauce(because the first time I made it I forgot to buy tomato sauce!) I used an organic chunky primavera spaghetti sauce.  Delicious!!  I also omit the jalapeno if my toddler will be eating it.

This chili is delicious.  I made this for a holiday party at work and everyone said it was great.  I left out the jalapenos, since a few people at work don't like really spicy food.  Will definitely make again.

Simple, easy to make! I added 1 tablespoon of Ground Red pepper, instead of the Jalapeno peppers. The heat was just right as it went down your throat! 

btw - use sweet cornbread, a great compliment of sweet and hot!!

Edited to increase stars

I did something wrong to make the chili  sweet when I reviewed this earlier. So sorry.  I made the chili again and it's very good and NOT sweet.

Original review:

Good basic chili recipe.  It does have a sweet "tomatoey" taste, especially the next day.  Will decrease tomato sauce next time.

Not a lot of fire, but very tasty.  I spice up with more jalapeno and use hot chili beans.  Helps give the extra kick. Makes a great meal for fall and winter.

This is a great recipe for chili.  I modified it slightly though by adding a can of red kidney beans and a can of baked beans to the recipe.  I also added a tsp. of oregano to it. I found it way too hot the first time I made it so I cut out the jalapeno peppers altogether.  This recipe makes a lot so I froze half of it for a fast dinner some other night!

Though I did not add all the chili powder as I thought it my be too spicy for my guests, this was loved by them at my superbowl party.  and it's so easy.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was so simple and very delicious! I only added half the onions and it was still very flavorful.
