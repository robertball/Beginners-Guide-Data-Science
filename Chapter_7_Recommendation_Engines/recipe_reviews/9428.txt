I have loved this recipe since the 1950's when it was presented on the back of the Carnation Evaporated milk can as 1-2-3 Fudge Sauce using powdered cocoa not bakers chocolate. Most of the time it comes out very professional and creamy. Tonight I made it without the butter and w/chocolate squares and it did come out grainy. Two weeks ago I made it using cocoa powder (no butter,again) and it came out perfectly. I didn't like the way chocolate squares melted and curdled,and for the first time my sauce came out grainy. I think using 1/2 butter is sufficient and 1 cup of butter is over-kill. I don't use butter at all.Weather also affects the way candies and sauces turn out, this week has been rainy..I'm in the Seattle area.

I didn't care too much for this sauce.  When it cooled it got grainy and wasn't thick enough for my liking.

I went looking to see if this recipe was included here.  I grew up on this fudge sauce and, as a renowned chocoholic, I'm here to tell you this is the best there is!  Patience is required, as in all good cooking, in order to get it smooth but it is worth it!  My grandmother would have to hide it from me when I was little so I wouldn't just eat it all right from the pan.  I just wish I knew how to hide it from myself!

My daughter is getting married this June and wanted an ice-cream bar instead of cake. I made enough sauce for 200 guests and also made 200 small jars of this decadent sauce for host gifts.  I changed the evaporated milk by adding caramel flavored creamer, vanilla, 1/2 & 1/2, and some water.  The consistency is smooth and velvety.  Such chocolate bliss!

I made this a bit differently.  Used 3 squares of chocolate, 3 Tbsp butter, 2 c. sugar and 1 can evap. milk.  It would always turn out grainy like the chocolate would not mix with the milk correctly, until tonight when I figured out the secret!  I poured it into my blender and processed it until smooth, and it was perfect!  Yum, homemade hot fudge sauce is the best!

Okay when prepared as stated.  I made some changes to make it great, reduce sugar to 2c, add 3/4 c cocoa, substituted 1/2c milk and 1/2c cream for evaporated milk.

Oh so yummy!  I made this one because I only had evaporated milk on hand, and I am SOOOOO glad I did.  Mine did not come out grainy at all.  Very smooth.  Granted when it is warm it is not as thick as most hot fudge sauces, but I think it tastes better than any I've had!  My husband loved it on his ice-cream so much that I will make this instead of buying the store bought stuff.  For kicks I also mixed it with some hot milk and made a wonderful hot chocolate! Thanks for sharing Cathy!

Too sweet and too thin. I only added TWO cups of sugar and we couldn't handle it. What a waste.

Do not rush this!  That is the secret.  My mother and grandmother shared the same recipe, and my grandmother's always turned out smooth and creamy, not grainy.  The difference is that my mother cooked her sauce until it was thickened, but my grandmother kept hers on the heat about 20 minutes after it thickened, stirring every 5 minutes or so.  Cooking longer not only improves the texture, it takes some of the sweetness out.  I agree that two cups of sugar is plenty, but then I don't care for the sickening sweetness of store toppings made with corn syrup.  If you like your ice cream to taste sweeter than the sauce, use 2 cups.

This recipe is great because it's easy and doesn't involve a lot of ingredients! Due to what I had on hand, I made these changes: I used semi-sweet chocolate squares, reduced the sugar to 1 1/4 cup, and only added half the can of evaporated milk to keep it from being too runny.  I also added a teaspoon of vanilla at the end. YUM!

AMAZING, but with the following changes - 
decreased sugar to 2 cups and it was still WAY too sweet, so I added about 3/4 cup of good quality cocoa powder. I let it call come to a boil to get the consistency I wanted, and then removed for the heat and added a couple tblsp good mexican vanilla. AMAZING!

This is a really good hot fudge sauce...if you do it right.  I made it like the recipe called for, yet I also found it soupy and grainy.  I put it aside in the fridge until the next day, hoping it would get thicker over night.  Nope. 
Then I remembered making fudge as a child with my grandmother.  She used to stir and stir and stir until her fudge thickened.  So, I tried the same technique with this sauce and stirred it constantly with a wooden spoon for a good 8-10 minutes.  It integrated all the different components and worked like a dream.  It also made it seem less sweeter when thicker, though I still think you could get away with less sugar.

I added about 2 rounded tablespoons of cocoa powder and boiled mine for around 6 minutes, stirring contantly.  I didn't bother with the double boiler, I think that the reason some people had trouble with it being too thin and gritty was because it needed to boil for a few minutes.   Mine was perfectly smooth thick sauce.    I poured into a quart jar, and it was almost full.  Thanks for sharing your recipe  : )

This sauce was grainy and was starting to get very thick with the double broiler method. I took it off and put it in a pot with 1/2-3/4 C of Coconut Milk. The grainyness disappeared on almost Med. heat in a little over a minute. I cooked it more to thicken it again.
IF I WERE TO DO THIS RECIPE AGAIN, AND I WILL,
I would start out w/ the chocolate pieces and butter on Low or extra low heat until they had melted and then start adding the sugar & swt. condensed milk. There is no need for a double broiler in my opinion and mine wasn't getting hot enough to de-granulate the sugar.  It thickens fast. I think I only used 2-2 1/2 C of sugar as well. I used Raw organic sugar from my Co-op. I would turn it up to medium to dissolve the sugar and get the desired thickness. If too thick before turning up ad milk, I guess water would work, or Coconut milk. I get a brand called So Delicious at the Co-op. Hope this helps. It was a great recipe. No more mass marketed hot fudge with HFCS.

This is a great recipe, it just takes patience and it doesn't tell you to take it slow!  For best results, All sugar has to be completely melted.  I left out the last 1/2 cup of sugar and it was still more than sweet enough for us.  It was plenty thick.  I think those complaints about "thin" or "grainy" were simply because of rushing the cooking process.  Wonderful reheated as well.  Smooth and thick.

This was great. I will be making and putting in jars for christmas gifts. I melted the chocolate in the microwave and then added the butter and continued the rest over a low heat on the stove and it came out perfect.

Great as a topping for "Chantal's New York Cheesecake" on this website.  This recipe was extremely easy, uses common ingredients and tasted great!  I don't have a double boiler, so I used a Pyrex tempered glass bowl over a regular pot on my stove to make my own double boiler.  I put about 1 1/2 inches of water in the pot and made sure it wasn't touching the bottom of my bowl - worked great.  Will make again!

Although the flavor was good, once cooled the solids separated from the milk giving a layered effect in the jar.  Although it looked like 1/2 caramel, 1/2 fudge sauce, it wasn't and was not suitable for the gifts I was planning.  Had to start over with different recipe.  Very disappointing.

Just made this to put over an ice cream pie....won't be doing that tonight!   Too soupy...maybe it will thicken up overnight in the refrigerator.  I followed recipe exactly...next time I will reduce the sugar.  Too sweet for my taste.  Mine did not come out grainy at all.  The last recipe I made (different recipe) was very grainy.  This onoe I did over double boiler and gradualy added sugar and I believe that made the difference.  Very smooth and rich.  Looks  like it will be good over an angel cake.  Not sure about the ice cream pie!

I made this tonight and it turned out great!  I did make a couple of changes.  Ionly used 1 & 1/2 cups of sugar, 1/2 cup of corn syrup and 8 oz of evaporated milk.  I didn't have any on hand so I made a substitution of 2/3 cup of skim milk pdr and 3/4 cup of water, to make 1 cup of liquid.  It worked great, the sauce is not too sweet and it's smooth and shiny.  Thanks!

This is wonderful......I only added 2 1/2 cups of sugar just because we like a little less sweet.  And I did not have chocolate squares....just cocoa powder.  3 Tablespoons of powder in place of each square and a little extra butter.  It was absolutely wonderful.  It wasn't grainy at all....previous reviewer must not have cooked long enough.  thank you

I was in the middle of making a peanut butter pie and realized I did not have any Smuckers Hot Fudge Topping. I will NEVER buy Smuckers again. This is THE hot fudge you want, especially when using in a turtle cheesecake or peanut butter pie. I melted 1/4 c butter in a heavy saucepan (not double broiler), added 1/2 t salt, and then added 3-1/2 oz sqs of unsweetened chocolate because that's what I had on hand and the end result is chocolatey enough. I melted the chocolate on low heat and stirred constantly. I added 1/2 c sugar and stirred constantly to melt the sugar thoroughly before adding the next 1/2 c. I added another 1/2 cup sugar, but clearly needed liquid, so I added about 1 T of evaporated milk. I let the mixture just start to bubble, still stirring constantly. I added another 1/2 c sugar, some more of the milk, stirred constantly until the edges started to bubble again. At this point, I've added 2 c sugar and that is all I used. I added more milk, a little at a time until half the can was used. That's all I used of the evaporated milk. I continued to heat the mixture, stirring almost constantly for nearly 10 minutes. Do not rush this process! I removed from heat, let it sit for 2 min, then vigorously stirred with my wooden spoon. I repeated that process 4 times and let cool. I poured some of the fudge on the crust, then layered the pie filling, and used more chocolate to drizzle on the top. I have about 1-1/2 c left over. It's smooth and shiny and tastes fantastic!

Made this last night and I have to admit I'm craving some right now. It's a super rich, super thick, chocolatey piece of heaven. This is the one time I simply could not give my son the spoon. I was addicted from the word go lol. I did make two adjustments however, I added a nice big handful of semi-sweet chocolate chips and I used margarine instead of butter. No particular reason for the butter switch except for that's what I had on hand. I used the chocolate chips to tone down some of the sweetness that was going on. This recipe is excellent!!! There's a turtle brownie hot fudge sundae with my name on it just waiting to be made. Good eats everyone!

I too remember this as a kid. After looking this up I checked my mom’s old recipe box for Daddy's recipe. It is exactly the same, with one expectation, it calls for powdered sugar. No graininess, good texture. Stir for 25 minutes or so to achieve proper viscosity.

I did do everything as was said but found at one point while adding the sugar.   It got to be a very sandy texture so we then added a little of the evaporated milk.  Then finished adding the sugar.  We then went back to adding and mixing in the milk a little at a time.  Will defiantly make it again!!

This is okay, and fine if you are in a pinch for ingredients, BUT, if you don't plan on finishing the sauce after you've made it, move on to something else.  First of all, you cant reheat it to "hot" or it breaks and is no longer a sauce.  You can heat it to warm, but it doesn't flow like sauce.  All you can do is dollup it.  Taste was good, but it didn't do what I wanted it to do, and couldn't use it the way I wanted.  (topping for ice cream)

I substituted the butter for margarine and mine came out REEEEEALLY thin and soupy.  I don't know if that's why or what.  I think since others had the same problem with soupy sauce, maybe the recipe needs to be adjusted some how? The taste is good and i still put it on my ice cream but it disappeared into the melted ice cream didn't solidify like true hot fudge.  I will keep looking for recipes!
