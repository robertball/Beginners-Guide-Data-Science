An easy bread to make. I kneaded the bread by hand and was surprised how easy it was to do. The bread was crusty on the outside and tender on the inside. My husband loved the bread with butter.

First off, the bake time is actually only 25 mins. Like another reviewer, I made this in my bread machine on dough cycle. Shaped the loaf and let it rise one more time and it baked to perfection at 425 degrees!

Well, That temp first.   At 425 degrees, you better start checking it at 25 minutes.  I checked it at 26 minutes, turned it over and thumped the bottom, and because the color was a dark brown, I determined that it had baked long enough.   The crust is great (crunchy)and the inside is nice and tender.  It hasn't cooled yet and the loaf is half gone.  It will never make it until tomorrow.   Every once in awhile that Chef John does comes up with a good one.   Another thing.  The proofing times.  I think they are for all purpose flour.  I used bread flour like the recipe calls for and the first raising time was more than doubled in 1 hour.  I let the loaf raise for  30 minutes and popped it in the  oven.   It turned out great.

This is spectacular.  I used my bread maker on the dough setting then formed the loaf, let it rise again, and baked it. I am only giving 4 stars because I think the baking time/temperature is wrong.  My loaf was done in 25 minutes even though I turned the heat down to 400.

I made this for Thanksgiving the night before. They were soft, moist and delicious. Perfectly dense, but light at the same time. I'll definitely be using this recipe for all of my italian bread needs!

I tried making this in my bread maker and it was an epic failure. I'm not going to blame the recipe. Apparently, what makes it work isn't compatible with my bread maker.

Super easy to prepare. By far the lightest loaf I have ever made. The flavor is homey and the cornmeal adds a nice texture. Gonna do this one for guest!

I would use less salt.  This bread is tasty but didn't live up to my expectation as I thought the cornmeal flavor was lost.

Not have corn meal I used some corn flour instead. Still turned out very good. Bake time was a little too long but that may have been due to my variation.

These made GREAT rolls for "Original Homemade Italian Beef" recipe on this site. The only thing I did different is to add 2 tbs gluten, as corn meal does not contain any, to ensure proper rise. 

I love the grainy corn meal on the outside.

This was a good and fairly simple receipe.  Not a whole lot of corn taste, but it had a nice texture.  I made exactly as written.

Excellent bread and it was well appreciated at Sunday dinner with my Italian family.  If you simply follow the instructions you will end up with a fine loaf of bread.
