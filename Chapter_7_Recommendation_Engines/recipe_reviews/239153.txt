This was a good recipe, and probably very authentic.  It is very simple, but tasty.  I used 3 jalapenos and that was too much;  would cut down to 1-1 1/2 jalapenos next time.  Served with rice and a steamed vegetable, this is a fast and healthy meal.

We liked this, and would probably add some mushrooms and green onions next time.

Very easy to make. A great way to clear out the left over chops and pork stew meat. Served with rice and collard greens.
