HOW TO INCREASE A 15.25 OZ CAKE MIX TO 18.25 OZ. Either buy an extra box of cake mix or make your own. Super-Coupon Queen Jill Cataldo said, the formula for Three-Ounce Cake Mix “Upsizer” goes as follows: Whisk together 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 cup sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda. “Store in a clean mason jar. When you wish to increase a 15.25 ounce cake mix to 18.25 ounces, add three ounces of this mix (6 tablespoons) to your existing cake mix.”  
Hi! I am the submitter of this (technique) recipe. I know using a box cake really isn't a recipe, but Allrecipes contacted me asking me to submit this because of the requests they received. So with that said, I submitted this so everyone can use my technique and have fun. You can use a box cake or a cake from scratch. I used Wilton (No Taste) RED concentrated paste icing color, and added a few drops of raspberry candy oil to the pink batter for flavor. You can add any flavor candy oil or extract.  Someone asked how to get the swirled look on the frosting. Here is how it's done: Paint a vertical stripe maybe 5" or so on  the inside of a pastry bag, using a gel or paste tint. Starting at the tip end, you can paint one stripe, two stripes (side by side or one stripe on each side of the bag), or use different colors and paint a bunch of stripes. Just depends on the look you want. Then add your frosting, and swirl it on the cupcake. I hope that made sense.

These are so adorable. Just a note-- make sure you push the tip of the bag (with colored mix) down into the white batter so you get the effect of the picture. My first batch had more of a tri layered look instead of the centered colored look. Oops. :)

Awesome! I just finished making these as a trial run for Valentine's Day and they are *so* cute. I did use Wilton gel coloring in pink and red, as that's what I had on hand (just mixed in until I got the shades I was looking for). I can't wait to use this technique for other holidays. For those of you who want to achieve the colored stripes in your icing, simply paint a stripe about 5" long down each side of your piping bag with gel coloring. You can use one color or multiple colors, depending on the look you're going for. Carefully fill the bag with icing and start playing! Thanks so much for sharing, Celeste! ♥

these worked out great.  i wanted to make 24 cupcakes but ran out of batter by about cupcake #12 so if you want a full batch make sure to use 2 packages of cake mix which will give you about 27 cupcakes in total.

I made green for St. Patrick's Day and instead of using the 3rd tinted cake batter, I made mint chocolate ganache for the center of the cupcakes.  FABULOUS!!  Ganache: 13 ounces heavy cream, 6 ounces bittersweet chocolate and 6 ounces Andes Mint Chips.  In a sauce pan bring your cream to a light boil. Then pour in the chocolate and start stirring immediately. Keep going until you have a smooth mixture.  Turn off your burner and set aside to cool.  Once room temp, use in place of the 3rd tinted cake mix.    I used this and store bought white icing piped together for the icing.  The overall presentation wasn't near as well  done as it could have been, but they really were great tasting.

I had a similar idea for my baby annoncement but wasn't sure how to tackle it exactly. . . now I know!  When I find out the gender of the "bun in my oven," I will use pink or blue batter in the cupcakes I plan to bring to my office that afternoon and will even drop some by my 4 yr old's daycare.  This is a PERFECT way to announce it during an afternoon cupcake toast with my friends at work and for my daughter to share with her friends.

Hi!  I've been making a variation of this technique for many years.   You may want to try this technique for a different look:  Instead of piping the colored cake batter into the center of the cupcake as described, use a Tablespoon full of one color batter and place it in the cup.  Then take another Tablespoon of batter and place it next or on top of the first one.  Then take another color and do the same thing.  Repeat until you reach the desired amount of batter in the cupcake holders.  Finally, take a long wooden skewer (or similar), place it inside the batter and swirl the batter around a bit - just like you would if you were making a marble cake.  This technique results in a "tie-dyed" look which is very retro and fun!  Enjoy!

I made these for my daughters class for her birthday. They were a HUGE hit. So fun when the kids discovered there was something different inside. I added cocoa to the extra batter instead of food coloring. So good!

These turned out delicious and adorable! I used store-bought frosting, however, because they were just a pre-Valentine's Day run through.   Tips: *I would fill the cup 1/2-full with the plain white batter before heading onto the colored batter. *Don't cut too big of a hole in the plastic bags when adding colored batter. I'd say about 1/4-1/2 inch is fine. *Use opaque cupcake liners.

It was awesome!  The family loved it!  It was an easy way to add some spark to your usual cupcakes.  I will definitely use it for other occasions.  I added strawberry extract to the pink batter and it tasted great!  Will be a staple in our household.

Awesome idea and SO easy! Used this for my daughters birthday party this week and am going to use it again for Valentines treats.   For those asking about how to streak the frosting like she did you just streak the inside of the piping bag with gel food coloring.

Best cupcakes ever! Made a light blue version for my cousin's Baby Shower. Everyone got a pleasant surprise when they took a first bite. I just filled the tinted batter into snack sized ziplocs and made a small hole to fill the inside of the cupcakes. Only fill 1/2 way with the light batter and then fill the rest with the tinted colors. These will grow, so do not overfill!! I couldn't find the candy oil so I just added a bit of vanilla extract. Keep a close eye on them, in my oven they took a little less than recommended. Do not let them brown or crack, since that means they are overdone. They are delicious and very light!

I've had my eye on this recipe for a bit now...and although Valentine's day would have been the ideal day to make these, being pressed for time, I made these a few days later! So yum and SO CUTE!! I made a few basic changes (out of choice) although no real changes to the recipe. The first, was to make a white cake batter from scratch for which I used Simple White Cake (by Scottosman - recipe on this site). So I ofcourse skipped the veg oil, egg whites, and water. The second was to only make red batter and skip the pick 'coz I was a bit short of batter!! The third was to use 1 1/4 teaspoon of strawberry essence to the red batter. So delish, everybody CRAVED for more!! Oh n I skipped frosting them just coz I was trying out the recipe and a tad bit lazy! They're perfect with frosting ... expect the frosting would complete the presentation! I can't wait to make this again ... and then try this with different centers!! Thanks Celeste ... this recipe has made a definite place in my heart forever!! :)

This made sort of layers for me rather than the pretty pattern others got -- I probably didn't press the tip down far enough. I have an actual piping tip that would work great for this, and I'll use that next time. Thank you for sharing! (P.S. I used this method with AR's "White Almond Wedding Cake" and liked the flavor of the cake. I do NOT like the flavor of Wilton's "leaf green" food coloring, blech, FYI. It didn't ruin my cakes but it's pretty noticeable -- just a tip for others who might want to use that color.)

I just made these cupcakes and they are so super cute.  My son has a Valentine's Day Party and I thought these cupcakes were perfect.  The only thing I would add is when you put the colored batter in the cupcake make sure you put the tip deep into the white batter or the cupcake will have just a small dot in the middle.  Very Cool!

We made these for St. Patrick's Day and they were perfect!  They were super easy to put together and turned out so cute (and fun) with the green icing.  We topped with cream cheese frosting and couldn't be happier!  Thanks for sharing the technique - I'm sure we will make these again and again :o)

These cupcakes turned out great.  I filled them almost to the top of the liner and they rose into a beautiful dome.  I left out the flavoring/extract.

This was a really fun cupcake to make. I need some more practice because I didn't get the two color effect. I will keep trying though until I get it right. I was actually proud of myself for getting at least one color in place. I thought for sure I'd mix it and come out with a one color (light pink) cupcake. A fun project.

Fun! This is a recipe that definitely needs some practice to master. I didn't do too bad for my first attempt. I did run out of the pink and red batters, and ended up with some plain cupcakes. So be sure to not add too much of the white batter to the cups. I used my 1.5 Tbsp. cookie scoop to measure out the white batter, and ended up adding some extra to each cup - I shouldn't have added the extra! Live and learn. I didn't have raspberry candy oil, so I added 1 tsp. raspberry flavoring. I frosted them with Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting from this site and added 1 tsp. raspberry flavoring to that too. What a beautiful, yummy treat for my hubby this Valentine's Day!

Great recipe, kids loved it!!! Was a little messy getting the different colors all together from plastic bag, I ended up using a decorating bag and outline tip to fill each color, worked great.  Add about 1/3 flour to cake mix, as we are above 7,000 ft.  Will make again!!!

These are adorable and so much easier than I anticipated.  Can't wait to make them for other holidays and my daughter's upcoming birthday party.  Thank you.

I made these for my son's Sunday school class and they loved them, even the teachers raved. What's great about these is I use them year round by alternating the colors. Really creative idea.

So cute, just one thing, my cupcakes shrivled up a bit and the tops were very cracked. This wouldn't stop me from making them again though:)

So simple!  Looks very impressive - I can't believe how easy it was.  I used McCormick food coloring and McCormick Strawberry extract.  The kids love it.

TY for this great technique!  I made these for my daughters birthday today!  She took them to school and all the kids got a huge kick out of them when they took a bite!  I posted a pic of them on another website and had several people ask how it was done!  I've given them all this link!!  TY again!

These look wonderful.  Unfortunately, they taste like you made plain white cake which is just what they are except food coloring has been added.  won't make again.

These cupcakes are so cute, fun and very easy to make.  I couldn't find the flavored oil at any of my local grocery or craft stores, so following other reviewers' advice, I just added cherry flavored extract.  What a waste: you couldn't even tell it was there.  And I added a lot!  I used a pastry bag and tip to make sure I got the colored batter all the way to the bottom.  I iced them with "Wedding Cake Frosting" from this site using the colored swirl technique that Celeste described.  They came out looking like they came straight from the bakery.  Beautiful!

Awesome tip for making VERY impressive cupcakes! I only used two flavors (chocolate and vanilla) and took them to work. Everyone kept coming up to my desk with a "How'd you DO it?!" Def a keeper!

Loved this idea, and it was super easy to do.  Followed others tips on making sure you push the tip of the bag to the bottom.  These turned out super cute!

Great idea, works perfect... instead of bags for the coloured batter I used my plastic icing containers to squirt it in. Kept my four year old busy for quite a while helping me create rainbow cupcakes... we used blue and pink batter.

These cupcakes were a success! I did not have rasberry candy oil and used strawberry extract flavoring instead. I used a medicine dropper to inject the red and pink batter. This worked out perfectly! Thanks for the excellent recipe!

turned out good i didnt have a pastry bag so i tried it in a regular ziploc bag so i couldnt really puch it down in there so they ended up looking like layer. i used vamilla ician with a couple of drops of red coloring and used a knife and made only a couple swirls and then put it on so it kind of had a marbling effect. Awsome cupcakes will def make again!!!

I just made these for Valentine's Day on Saturday and they were very cute and tasty!  I've only rated the recipes 4 stars, however, because there was not enough batter for 24 cupcakes!  Because I had already filled 24 liners 1/3 full with batter, I ended up with 5 or 6 seriously small cupcakes.  I think if I make it again I will aim for a count of 18, which is more realistic after having made the recipel

These were so much fun to make, we put a Mardi Gras spin on them.  We used purple and green on the inside and yellow and purple on the icing with green sugar sprinkled on them.  They were so pretty.  I put some pictures to show you.

Well, I didn't do a very good job on the first couple. They ended up being only one shade of green (for St. Patrick's Day) but I don't think I made the food coloring colors dark enough apart. Someone suggested put the tip all the way to the bottom before you squeeze the batter in, which I would definitely advise. It took me awhile to figure that out. Next time I will use icing tips to make them pretty! Despite them only being one color, they still turned out pretty neat.

I think this is a great idea!  Why would anyone EXPECT this to taste like anything else BESIDES a box cake mix?  That is all it is!  And to me, that is the beauty of it.  So simple, so quick and you can do it with any recipe you like. Thank you for this simple and fun trick!

Fantastic! I used a cherry chip cake mix and did a chocolate filling by adding a little cocoa powder to the remaining batter. That taste combo is great!

These are the sweetest cupcakes yet!  I probably should have practiced with my piping bag a little bit before making them, but they turned out great!  Next time, darker pink batter, and i'm going to really brighten up my red. Or go green!  St. Patty's day here I come!

Excellent recipe, easy to adapt to any occasion. I used red and blue food color gel to make red, white and blue cupcakes. Put red and blue gel lines on side of pastry bag before fling with white whipped frosting with a star tip. The entire presentation was perfect! Thank you for the cute idea!

I made these for Valentines day this year and everyone loved them... I thought that they were cuter than they tasted though. I didnt use the raspberry flavoring so that might have helped with the flavor. I think next time i will add some strawberry flavoring to them.

Very cute. Fun to make. Make sure to insert the tip of the bag all the way to the bottom of the cupcake to get the V look.

this is such a cute idea. i did not have any flavored oil so i left it out. used canned cream cheese frosting becuse i was being lazy and they still turned out great. mine looked more like bleeding hearts instead of sweetheart cupcakes but they were still really fun to make and eat. thanks for the inspiration celeste.

I only used white and one color of pink and it was really cute having the pink center.   I used the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting from this site with it.   They were like a bakery cupcake.  Impressive.

Fun, Fun, FUN! I didn't see one person who didn't smile when they ate these special treats at my Valentine's Day Dinner! I used a little Coconut Extract in the pink batter and "Cool Whip Frosting" off of this site (with 1/2 teaspoon Coconut Extract and a sprinkle of sweetened coconut over the top of all after frosting). A fantastic and festive combo. Thank you for this post, and a cheerful way to serve cupcakes. I mentioned to my husband that next time I make these - I will try my "from scratch" recipe for cake batter and frosting. He said - why mess with something that is so well recieved! I agree!:) Fast, fun, and oh so GOOD!

I made this recipe last night for my mom's office. Her coworkers have been asking if I was a professional baker. I did not use a box mix, however, I did use the method of layering the colors as described. They turned out beautifully. As a suggestion for future users, I recommend using a sandwich sized bag and using about a cup of the batter at a time. It's a little more time consuming but it wastes less and is easier to control. I piped white chocolate buttercream frosting on these cupcakes and by 1 in the afternoon the 2 and a half dozen she brought in were all gone.

I made these with the classic white cake mix and added a dram bottle of Raspberry to the pink and red. I started out making cupcakes but after cutting one open and tasting it, I wound up using them for raspberry shortcakes. I cut them in two and put berries and homemade whipped cram on them. I tinted the cream red hot red. I heard several times how they were to pretty to eat, yet no one seemed to have a problem eating them. One cake mix made 12. After you get your cupcakes ready to go into the oven, if you will give your pan a few taps on the counter top, it will eliminate any air pockets you might have from inserting the colored batter into the center. This is an awesome recipe, I will be making it again and again. Thanks for sharing this with us.

Fun twist. I made red and green for Christmas. Hard to make because the batter was pretty runny. I had to make a very small hole in the bag to keep it all from running out all over.

I made these into Christmas colored cupcakes with white, red and green.  It is really hard to judge 1 and 2 tablespoons of battter being inserted into batter already in the tin, so this recipe will take some trial and error.  This was my first attempt and the first color turned out a little thinner than I would have liked, so I'll have to remember to put more of that one in next time.  As far as the overall idea goes, this is great for all of the holidays.  I made this for a kids party, and they thought they were amazing.  I piped them with green and red frosting and they turned out very cute.  Will definitely use this again for future holiday kids parties!

This is a great idea. I did have problems getting the middle to look right. Next time I will use my Wilton bags and tips to put the colors in the middle instead of baggies. As they say "practice makes perfect." Doubled the recipe which made 27 big cupcakes, will put less in each next time. I used Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting which was very good. Will try again for St. Patrick's Day. Thank you Celeste, great recipe.

Such a cute idea. Will change the colors for different holidays. Can't wait to make cupcakes for my son's birthday parties. Thanks for the idea.

These were very good and fun to serve.  I ran out of batter for the light pink, so most of mine were only two colors.  Still a success though.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was so fun and easy. I made two batches for Valentine's Day using pink for the middle. I didn't bother with the raspberry flavoring, but I can't wait to try different color/flavor combinations for other holidays and events! So cute, thanks!

Pretty easy once you get the hang of it! Good texture and taste. Impressed at party, and disappeared very quickly.  The frosting recipe suggested was very tasty, but I didn't find it to be anywhere near as "stiff" as it was supposed to be. Had to cut the amount of cream down by 1/2 cup just to keep it from being too liquidy.

these were excellent to do, a bit messy, but I didn't care, I think I over filled a few of them because I didn't have enough batter to do the white, pink and dark pink, but luckily I was making chocolate cup cakes and sub'ed some to make up for not having enough, it worked out perfectly. I also went all over town for raspberry or strawberry candy oil, but it was in high demand, so I lucked out with cherry, and however it was still wonderful flavoring, kids said the cupcakes tasted like the ice sandwiches....and I have to agree with them, I'll do this again. They said it was their favorite cupcake by far...Thanks Celeste.

These little cup cakes turned out delightful!  To make the red layer really red and add some flavor I added 1/2 package of strawberry Kool-aide drink mix.  urned out super red and super tart!

I've made these quite a few times. This last time I didn't have a white cake mix so I used the recipe Simple White Cake on AR as an alternative. The method is easy but I sure made a huge pile of dishes making them :)

These are easy, fun and impressive!  Made these for the first time this weekend and brought them to a party at work, to rave reviews.  I recommend topping with "Rick's Special Buttercream Frosting" recipe from this site.  Half the frosting recipe was the perfect amount.  I tinted the frosting pink and also used the raspberry candy oil to flavor.  Fun and delicious, can't wait to come up with another flavor for our next party.  Thank you for sharing!

These were delicious and my roommates all loved them.  I liked that the recipe called for egg whites instead of whole eggs, it made it seem a bit healthier... 
I couldn't find raspberry candy oil so I ended up using almond extract instead.  It gave them a nice amaretto taste (but now I have to worry that friends are secretly allergic to nuts...)  
I'd give it five stars but I ran out of batter before I could finish the layers, like some other reviewers said.  I also had to cook them for a bit longer.  The combination of these two problems makes me wonder if I just made larger cupcakes than the original person did.  I'll definitely make them again, I'm thinking chocolate cake and white cake with green food dye and peppermint oil for grasshopper cupcakes.

Love this creative idea for a store bought mix and love that, yes, it can be done using your favorite cake from scratch recipe as well! Don't forget chocolate lovers- white chocolate and regular chocolate and reserving some batter before cocoa is added if you still want the chocolate flavor...

I am giving a 5 star review to the technique rather than to the actual recipe. I used a different cupcake recipe from this site based on what I had available. I followed the directions as written, and wound up with beautiful cupcakes. I like that you don't need any special cake-making equipment, just food coloring, two plastic bags, and a pair of scissors. I didn't even use a special tip for the bag, I just cut a hole in it and stuck it down into the batter.

These were simple to make and cute.  I will probably make them again, but try some of the other suggestions.  I think chocolate would be a nice addition.

Seriously - these couldn't have been cuter!  I made mine white, with green in the middle (food coloring) and then a dallop of brown (used cocoa).  I used the striped technique for the buttercream with green, white and dark green, and then cut out little pics of Deery Lou (from Sanrio) and put those on a toothpick to stick out like a little flag.  They couldn't have been more presh - AND deelish :)

My 3-yr. old and I made these this weekend for V-Day.  They turned out so cute I had to put them in my blog here on the site - and they were so good I had to get the remaining few out of the house (I devoured 8 this weekend).  I didn't accurately divide the batter, so some cupcakes only had the darker pink inside.  Next time I'll know better.  Oh, and make sure when you put the batter into the plastic bags to cut the tiniest hole possible - I cut mine too big and then had little control over it oozing out of the bag.  Also, I didn't have the flavoring, just the coloring, and they still tasted fantastic.  Can't wait to make these again for different holidays.  Thanks CELESTE!

Nice idea for dressing up ordinary cupcakes. Note  that you need to squeeze the colored batter down deep into the cupcakes; otherwise, all the color will float at the top.

I found it a little messy to make.  Perhaps I just made the hole too big in the bag.  I couldn't find any rasberry candy oil at the store.  I used just a few drops of mint.  Tasted okay.  Dont know if I would go to the trouble again to make these.

I love Love this idea. So cute. I made these for my son's valentines party. I didn't do so very good on getting the colors layered right but I just need practice. I ended up with what looked like kisses in the middle of the cupcakes. And hey that was perfect since it was for Valentines Day! Thanks Celeste :)

My kiddo's made these in their home-ec class this week. Being it was Valentine's, they chose this recipe. They had a lot of fun making and decorating the cupcakes...then couldn't wait to cut one open to see how they turned out! For the icing, we put white icing in one side of the pastry bag, and pink on the other, for a blended look. The cupcakes look and taste great:) Excellent idea for any holiday/occassion. Thanks for sharing!

These are really fun to eat and not that difficult to make. Will definitely do this again and the fun part is that I plan on changing the food coloring colors to match whatever holiday I might be celebrating at the time.  Green for St. Patrick's Day, Red for Valentines...very versatile and creative

I used the Simple White Cake recipe of this web site for the cake batter. It made about 12 cupcakes. Very delicious! Paired with Butter Cream Frosting from this web site.

I used the Almond Wedding Cake recipe for the cupcakes and Rick's Special Buttercream to frost. Was a big hit! Great idea Celeste!

These look so special!  I can't wait to hear what my husband's coworkers say tomorrow.  my kids and I loved the pink inside.  I used a star tip to make pink stars all over the tops.  It was messy to insert the colored batter inside.  I had no idea how much to squeeze in each one since you can't really tell but i guess it worked because they look great.

I followed the recipe and these are delicious.  Really light and not real sweet.  I used the Sturdy Whipped Cream Frosting recipe and everyone loved these.  The frosting is also light and not real sweet.

I ran out of batter before I could get all my layers done.  Ended up mixing up some chocolate cake mix to fill in the middle.  Not for sure I will try this again.  I decorated the tops with valentines and got rave comments.

This rating is based off of the total presentation of the recipe, not the taste.  It tastes like a box cake, but I understood it would when I made these.  They could always be made from scratch if you are willing to put in the extra work!  I brought these to a superbowl party and everyone was impressed with how cute they were.  With a great frosting and the beautiful presentation, a 5 star recipe.

Fairly easy to make. The only thing I found a little tricky was getting the inside to be evenly pink in every cupcake. However, that also made it fun, as I'd bite into a cupcake and get different results each time. I love the idea of adding color to the inside--so beautiful without having to be a pro!  I additionally went ahead and added red icing paste to the buttercream frosting I made. It looked so pretty that way. Next time I'm going to add the raspberry oil, as I didn't have any.

This recipe was easy!!  I used the two shades of pink and red in a heart shaped cake for Valentine's Day.  The cake was topped with white icing and cherries.  The cake looked awesome when it was cut!! Thank you!!  Colleen

Super cute. I used carrot cake batter for the "white" and tinted red + pink white cake batter for the middles. Next time I will top the cupcakes with a bit of "white" after filling. As Kea said make sure you stick the point into the cupcake or it will not turn out well! Smaller hole = easier, less messy! Thanks Celeste!

What a neat idea.  I did the pink and red initially but for some reason they were a little bitter even though I used the no taste red.  The next time I just did pink and they turned out great. I cant wait to try green for St Patrick's Day.

I made it, and it was INCREDIBLE. Instead of vegetable oil, I used olive oil. This wasn't for any reason other than the fact that I didn't have any vegetable oil haha. I really enjoyed making it, and I would def make it again.

Great suggestions, too bad we have to wait until next year (2020) to get those little heart candies, since the company that used to make them has closed down.

I haven't made these yet, but for those of you who were saying they had no flavor, why not just use strawberry flavored cake mix which is already pink and just follow through with the rest of the instructions.

It works great! They looked super cool when I bite them in half! I made homemade cake instead and that worked just as well!

Super easy recipe, one cake mix and a few drops of color. The recipe it's self is not the highlight, but what you can do to decorate. I decided to practice for easter, so I a bigger batch will be in order at a later time.

made this recipe for St Paddy's and they were a huge hit. Today we made several different flavors, all mini's, we made 12 dozen and decorated all of them for spring. Great recipe, easy to make and adjust for other flavors! Is now one of my daughter's and my favorite!

Not a big fan of the batter flavor.  I made them in mini cupcake pans and they stuck like crazy.  I enjoy the idea, but I think I'll do it with a different recipe next time.

I loved this recipe, so cute! I made these for my boyfriend for Valentine's Day :) I chose to alternate between chocolate, white, and raspberry batter in half of my cupcakes and white, chocolate, and strawberry in the other half. I made the strawberry batter with a delicious strawberry reduction. The result was a yummy moist center of already scrumptious cupcakes! I would recommend this recipe to anyone looking to mix things up. [pun intended ;)]
