*Note from the author*: I submitted this recipe a while ago. I've re-made it now that it was published here. It really is quite delicious! But- I need to suggest a few changes. First, it will take longer than 30 mins to get cold enough to whip. Mine took about an hour and a half (though this will depend on how cold your fridge is). Second, after frosting your cake, chill until serving. Like buttercream, it will tend to melt a little bit.

wow!  this frosting is incredibly good!  This essentially ends tasting much like chocolate mousse.  It's very rich, creamy and chocolaty but also light and smooth.  Very nice alternative to the dense, heavier buttercream frostings. It's easy to prepare, but I found it helped to chill it a while longer to let it firm up more.    You'll be happy to put any leftover into a serving dish to eat as a dessert by itself!

Excellent!. Unlike some greasy frostings, this is light and fluffy - and not too sweet!  It has a very nice rich flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could!

Just as the other reviewers stated, this is crazy delicious. I didn't have white chocolate chips so i just doubled up on regular chocolate. i made the frosting first then let it chill in the fridge while i baked the cake so by the time it was cooled and ready for frosting it was at the perfect consistency. I, too, thoroughly enjoy eating this on its own, sans cake.

This is seriously the most delicious frosting I've ever tasted. You can eat it out of the bowl with a spoon and forget the cake all together. It takes much longer than 30 minutes to firm up enough to whip though. I waited 2 hours and I still had to be really quick piping it on to the cupcakes.

This frosting is so incredible. It comes out so creamy and smooth in the end. My cousin and I made this for a black magic cake that is also on this site. We put a bit more semi chocolate than white chocolate and put 4 tablespoons of Tim Hortons cappuccino mix with the hot cream. My cousin loved it so much, he was tempted to eat the whole batch without the cake! My only complaint was that it melts very fast when frosting, but solidifies pretty quick after it's whipped the second time and put in the fridge overnight. Still, it went well with everyone, so I highly recommend it.

Excellent frosting!  I have a new favorite.  I did follow your note and leave in the fridge for about an hour and half.   Perfect!

This is seriously one of the best frostings I've ever tasted. I ate it on top of a cupcake but honestly the cupcake is totally unnecessary. I love that it's got a rich semi-sweet chocolate taste yet doesn't seem heavy or overpowering. This frosting is definitely one that I can't wait to have again!

I am new to making homemade frosting but thought I would give it a try for Valentine's  Day. I made red velvet cupcakes and used white chocolate chips and oh my it was yummy!! I didn't have alot of time before dinner so I put the frosting in the freezer for a little over 30 minutes (watching it carefully) and it was ready to whip in no time! It was very good and no comparison to any other frosting. I cannot wait to make it with chocolate chips!

Excellent,  I tweaked it a wee bit, I used special dark chips, and the white chocolate chips,  no sugar added, it was sweet enough.

dude- it's the best chocolate frosting ever! it's basically a fluffy ganache, and I can't believe this recipe doesn't have a thousand likes. I followed the recipe exactly, like I always do the first time I make one.  I did what everyone else suggested and left it in the fridge for about two hours before whipping it. It fluffed up perfectly. I don't think it would have whipped earlier than that, I checked once or twice and it was still pretty runny until two hours in when it was fully cool. It's chocolatey and I love the white/dark mix. Very rich flavor, but if you wanted it a deeper chocolate, just use semi-sweet chips only.  Make it! You won't regret it!

Terrific taste!   Don't know if it's gonna make it to the cake, Ha-ha!   No, actually I took one of the other reviewers tip and made the frosting before the cake, giving it plenty of time
to chill in the fridge.  If after the cake is done, and the frosting still is not thick or I have the melting situation some reviewers have mentioned, then I'll put it back in the freezer for a short while!  Done!

Wow! So glad I chose this over a buttercream frosting for my daughters chocolate birthday cake. I could've licked the bowl clean!! My 8 yr old told me she doesn't normally like frosting but this stuff is awesome and chocolatey! #happymom

I made this frosting exactly per the recipe and i was delicious.  We frosted cupcakes with it.  I refrigerated for about an hour - it took a while, but it did thicken up well.  It also tastes great straight from the bowl and reminds me of chocolate mousse. I am not a fan of overly sweet buttercream frosting.  This one is light and rich in flavor.  Yum!!

Great flavor. I refrigerated overnight before whipping. I then put the frosting in the freezer for a few hours before frosting my cake. I tried frosting my round cake with it directly from the fridge but it was too melty. Freezing the frosting helped combat this.

Wow. This is quite possibly the perfect chocolate frosting. My Father asked if he could have just a bowl of this stuff for his birthday! :)

I guess I'm not in the majority.  I found this to be a lot of work to get it to be thick enough.  I think it wouldn't need so much work if you were putting this on a flat top cake that was still in the pan.  But for a cake you wanted to frost the side of or for cupcakes, I found the consistency too liquid.   And the original writer wrote to leave it in the fridge longer than the original recipe states to help that, but even acknowledges that, after time passes, this effect will not last for something that is going to be in room temp for a while.  Although some may not mind that happening, I just need a frosting that can last a while in room temp.  When trying to use the tips in the reviews for thickening (other than keeping it cold), it changed the taste quite a bit.  Definitely not on the 4.5 bandwagon that this is supporting.
