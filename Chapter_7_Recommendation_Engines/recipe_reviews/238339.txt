Used vanilla Greek yogurt (what I had on hand)t, added a few more ice cubes and ended up with a really creamy breakfast smoothie.  I had a perfectly ripe cantaloupe and just eyeballed the amount, adding a more than 1/2 cup I'd say, but the OJ still slightly overpowered the cantaloupe flavor.  Didn't really matter that much, as it was perfectly sweet, and I enjoyed it.

I had about 2 cups of chopped, ripe cantaloupe to which I added about 4 oz plain Greek yogurt, 1 tsp vanilla, 1/2 cup orange juice, 1/2 cup milk, 1 scoop of vanilla protein powder (which I always add) and ice. It came out excellent with a good cantaloupe flavor. I may try straining the next time because it had a little grainy texture.

I used plain Fage, fresh squeezed oj, cantaloupe and agave nectar to make "creamsicles" for a frozen treat later. Yummy!

One of my favorite smoothies. I use greek vanilla yogurt and usually add more cantaloupe along with some ground flax seed for extra protein.  I freeze cantaloupe so can have it all year.

Have made it several times, love it.  The last time I had 2spears of pineapple & added it. Nice refreshing taste.  Froze some leftovers & my 10mos old granddaughters & grandson ate it with a spoon.  They loved it too.

Wonderful taste. I didn't have any ice so it had even more flavor. No ice needed.

Tasted too much like OJ, so I added more cantaloupe and a little bit of sugar. Nice twist on a regular cantaloupe shake.

Simple, healthy, and flavor to boot.  What's not to like?
