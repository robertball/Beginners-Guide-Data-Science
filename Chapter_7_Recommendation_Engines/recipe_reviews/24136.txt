If you are reading these reviews, trying to decide if you want to try this recipe, then read on! I found this recipe by doing an ingredient search for pancakes made without milk. Wow, am I glad we ran out of milk! Don't be turned off by the bad reviews. They just needed to play around with the recipe a little. These are the changes that I made: Used apple juice,(since I didn't have apple cider), added 1/8 teaspoon salt to enhance flavor,and added 1/2 cup extra juice, after cooking oats in microwave, to thin out batter,(and it also cooled the mixture quicker). I added oats, apple juice, vinegar, butter and raisins altogether before cooking. This melted the butter and also softened the raisins. Then I added the extra 1/2 cup apple juice after the oat mixture was microwaved. This cooled the oats enough to add the 2 eggs without scrambling them. After stirring in the eggs, I added the flour and baking powder, and mixed thoroughly. I used a gravy ladle to pour into a cast iron skillet on medium to medium low flame with a little oil and butter for frying. You can not cook these too quickly. After pancake turned golden brown around edges, I flipped them and cooked another 45 or so seconds. I put pancakes on plate and buttered tops and drizzled maple syrup over top. Delicious! Made a batch with raisins and without...I prefer without, but thats a matter of taste. Thanks Bob for the recipe!

I printed this out a long time ago and finally got around to trying them out today. These were just awful. I followed the recipe exactly and don't know how anyone could like the reults I got - and I'm not that hard to please. There was a distinct vinegar flavor and they were soggy. I tried one bite of the first batch and didn't even finish cooking them.

Not a hit at our table.  We did not taste the oatmeal and they were not fluffy.

Everybody loved these. I did not add the raisins and I used spelt flour. These are very good.

So good!  I thought the raisins might burn or get hard, but I was wrong.  I used whole wheat flour, and found that I had to add an extra 1/2 cup.  Wonderful taste, wonderful smell!  I'll be making these again!

These are pretty good. Nice flavor, texture was a bit dense. The batter was very thick. WAY too thick to pour, almost like a soft dough. I spread it out with the back of a spoon, and they came out fine, but I think that next time I will skip cooking the oatmeal in the microwave. I like a little more texture from an oatmeal pancake. Note: These smell WONDERFUL while you are cooking them!

I used separate bowls and mixed the egg mixture into the liquid a bit at at time. I omitted the raisens the second time, too sweet my our taste. They have become a regular in my house.  I think they are great! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

These were delicious.  I made them for my family for Easter breakfast and they loved them. They said they taste like apple spice cakes.

Delicious variation to normal pancakes! I will probably add a tablespoon or so of sugar to the batter next time, just for a little sweetness.
