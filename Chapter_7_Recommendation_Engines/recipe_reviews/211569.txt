I would give it a million stars if I could! AMAZING!! Worked just fine without the liquer, too.

This was a great recipe to start with and then I go and find a way to mess with it! I used 1/4c avocado, 1/4c dates and 1/2c margarine instead of the butter. I used only 1 cup of brown sugar, 1/4c of Nutella and 1/3c cocoa. I used only 1 cup of chocolate chips and everything else was the same. I thought they were very cake-like when baked at 350 for about 14 min so I bumped it up to 400 for 10 min and flattened them with a sugared fork. This turned out better, but I think they actually had TOO many chocolate chips! I would rather have added more hazelnuts and used white chocolate chips instead. It could do a really nice muffin recipe with some zucchini to lighten it up a bit!

Looking for an option to classic chocolate chip cookies?. I made this recipe to take to a friends' party.  They are soo tasty!  The toasted hazelnuts are a great idea. I might add a few more of them next time. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  BD

These are great, and although I used exactly what it called for, you could substitute peanut butter, mint or any other chip in there for a different taste.

turned out very well. added mini-m&ms for 1 cup chips since that is what I had with the white and milk chips. added 2TB water in place of liquer; dough was very thick, but turned out rich and chocolatey. Will definitely keep this as my chocolate cookie recipe!

I made these for an office potluck and they received rave reviews!  They were a nice chewy cookie and didn't spread too much in the oven.  I did replace the coffee-flavored liqueur with 2 TBSP of strong brewed coffee.

These are delicious cookies. I added an extra tablespoon of the liqueur (cause I love it!) and used only two cups of chips (and that was plenty). I used a mixture of the kind of chips in the recipe as well as some peanut butter ones which went great. Butterscotch would work well too I bet, just go with whatever you have. Get a glass of milk ready for when you eat these, they are very rich!

One of my favorites this holiday season! The perfect amount of chocolate for me and I loved the texture. I added mini M&M's in place of the milk chocolate chips for some color.

I have made these several times. Sometimes I don't use the white choc chips simply because of my personal preference.  Everytime I make these though everyone loves them. Definitely a winner!

Made these cookies as an experiment, they turned out great. Very good and certainly chocolatey, I think next time that I will leave out the cocoa though. Other than that very good. These cook very quickly so watch those ovens. Thank you so much for the recipe its a keeper.

If a fudgy soft brownie and a cookie had a baby, this would be it!  I didn't have hazelnuts so just used walnuts.  used a variety of chips I had on hand, and some raisins.  I did add a bit of espresso powder to the dry ingredients. (2 tsp).  These are so fudgy, very rich but oh so good.  super easy recipe and they made a very good sized batch using the large pampered chef cookie scoop.  the base recipe itself is the best and could serve as a springboard to add what you want. (peanut butter chips, butterscotch chips, etc.)  lots of possibilities.

These were delicious - followed the recipe exactly except for using roasted almonds instead of hazelnuts because that's what I had on hand. Definitely chop them small. I refrigerated them for an hour so I don't know if that affected the shape during cooking but they stayed pretty high and thick instead of spreading out. This was very much like a brownie cookie. It is very hard to tell when they're done since they are dark but I think 10 min is a good point for me.

These were very good. Awesome texture, nice and chocolatey. My only complaint is that you can't taste the Kaluha.

I don't bake very often, don't even have a mixer. But these were a big hit. Did'nt use any coffee liqueur and used raw sunflower seeds instead of the hazelnuts. Had a hard time telling when they were done,"Bake...until the edges are slightly browned" on a dark brown cookie did'nt work for me. A favorite!

Very good, I used two cups of peppermint chips and one cup of semi-sweet mini chips. I think next time I'll use peppermint schnapps instead of the coffee liqueur.

Great recipe with options. I made a double batch put in container in fridge for one hour. Divided in four portions, 1st ones, added choc chips. 2nd ones added white chocolate chips.  3rd ones added Andes creme de menthe baking chips. 4th ones added Caramel bits (these were actually for melting  but they were small balls so I gave them a try, worked good) We likes all the variety & met everyone's taste buds. This is definitely a keeper, thank you for sharing

Great recipe!  They come out perfect.  Was so anxious to make, I used what I had on hand, 2 T coffee, mini dark chocolate chips, cherry filled chocolate chips and pecans.  Yummy, everyone loves them.  Will definitely make again!  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

These are soooooo good. I followed the base of the recipe to the letter, even using the liqueur. However, since I didn't have enough chocolate chips and no hazelnuts, I just used about 1 1/2 cups choc chips, 1 cup raisins, and 1 cup sliced almonds. Not a huge change, but the result was so delicious - I especially love the raisins so would do that again. Any nut - almonds, walnuts, etc. - would work just fine, I think. Great cookie recipe that actually results in a true cookie, not a cake-like texture! Thank you and highly recommended!

Easy, delicious, excellent cookie.  The roasted hazelnuts are what give it a distinctive flavor.

These are great!  Skipped the nuts, used brandy in place of the Kahlua, and used a pkg of white chocolate chips (Guittard, as quality counts). Those substitutions were due to what I had on hand. Although, if I were making this with the hazelnuts, I'd use Frangelico (hazelnut flavored liqueur). Baked just 8 minutes, and they came out soft and chewy. My fellow church members are in for a treat.

It was an amazing cookie recipe. Though I had to substitute instant coffee (+water & cocoa powder) for coffee liqueur and roasted macadamia nuts for hazel nuts, it still turned out amazing. So chocolatey without being too sweet. Loved it. ??
