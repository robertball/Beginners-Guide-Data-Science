This is actually one of our family favorite recipes.    Through the years I have made these modifications to suit our tastes. Garlic - yes, more!  I always double it, and will even triple it if the cloves are small.  Pressing it instead of mincing it will bring out more flavor.  Then, I start just the garlic and chicken broth simmering for 5-10 min. to bring out more garlic flavor as well as cook the broth down some and concentrate the flavors.   Onions - I double the onions.  Also the lemon pepper.  After the broth and garlic simmer for their time, then I add the onions and lemon pepper and let it cook 3-5 min. Shrimp - very key to the best flavor is to use fresh, uncooked shrimp, not the stuff that has been frozen in a bag.  If you must use the frozen kind, try to use uncooked, as it seems to absorb the flavors better. We don't use the parsley, but do put in 3-4 more chopped green onions at the end, right before serving, and also sprinkle fresh parmesan on it once dished up.   Also, be sure to use angel hair pasta, not vermicelli or regular spagetti.  It's too delicate a dish for any thicker pasta. Serve with garlic bread and a salad.  Yummy.

Overall it was good, but I would change a few things:

There was too much chicken broth
Fresh lemon juice needs to be added
More garlic...you can never have too much.

Gosh, I don't want to be harsh, but this simply reminded me of ramen. Granted, ramen doesn't have shrimp in it, but not hard to throw in some frozen shrimp and end up with the same results for less time. This was easy to prepare, but just not that tasty. Ramen, truly, tastes better.

I sure liked this recipe.  Especially I am watching my diet really close right now to lose weight...but I love pasta.  I did not use Angel Hair Pasta.  I used whole grain pasta that has 6 grams of fiber.  Angel Hair pasta would have been too light for me..but I put a lot of green onions, garlic and parsley.  Low sodium soup based sauce so it was not heavy like the cream sauce and better for you.  I can eat this every day.  Next day I still lost my weight.... So if you are on diet and still want to enjoy pasta this recipe is it.  Thanks for the recipe.

I followed this recipe exactly and found it lacking in flavor.  As someone else mentioned, lemon juice would have been a good addition... extra chicken broth... it just wasn't the flavorful dish I consider a "shrimp scampi".  I'd pass on this one.

As a Shrimp Scampi recipe, this isn't a good one.  Not enough garlic, no white wine, lacking flavor. As a shrimp recipe, it's ok.

I loved the idea cause its low carb when you use wheat pasta--made some slight changes, added 1 small can of tomato sauce, 1/4 cup lemon juice cause I didnt have lemon-pepper, diced onion and let simmer for about 15 min before adding the shrimp.  I also substitued cilantro for the parsley.  It was excellent and I will definitely make again.

I made this recipe for New Year's Eve dinner and it was great.  Too much pasta, though.  I also doubled the amount of shrimp and added more garlic.  Very very yummy !

Great recipe. I did tweak it a little. I added a TBS butter to the broth. I didn't use parsley and used yellow onions instead of green.  Also I poured mixture over rice instead of pasta. Yummy! Even my 7 year old who doesn't generally eat fish enjoyed it. I can't wait to make it again.

I agree with some of the others - flavorless. The consistency is like ramen, but tastes worse. If I did make it again I'd halve the chicken broth and at least double the lemon pepper and garlic.

This is a very easy and quick recipe but most of the reviews are right there is something missing. Its very bland and simple... I added the lemon juice, butter, extra garlic, etc but it was still plain the sause ends up as a traditional oil and butter flavor... Probably wont make again but didn't hurt to try...

This was so tasteless. There was nothing I could add to it that helped it out, my husband came home and tried making it better with no luck we ended up ordering take out.

It's a simple dish, and if you are cooking for people with a simple palate, it's great.  I added a lot less water than called for in the recipe--I just eyeballed it and we spooned the sauce over the pasta and shrimp when we ate it.  It was very easy to prepare.

Good recipe overall. I left out the pasta because I didn't want the extra carbs. I would agree that it could use more garlic-almost anything could always use more garlic! Thanks

Very disappointed.  Not very flavorful and the sauce was WAY too thin.  I definitely see why some of the other reviewers had to double or triple the garlic, lemon pepper, and onions before they could give it a good review.  Even if you did that, it seems to me that the sauce wouldn't be thick enough to stick to the pasta or the shrimp anyway.  By the time you doctored this up enough to be good, it would be a completely different recipe.

This came out tasting like chicken broth, and chicken broth only. I even took other reviewers advice and added more garlic and lemon juice, but it was just strange. very easy though.

This was flavorless. It had way too much broth. I was fortunate to be able to save dinner by throwing it all back into a pot together... added a ton more garlic and garlic powder, 2 tbls of butter, and salt. i recommend you look elsewhere for a shrimp scampi recipe.

This was not a good recipe. I was very disappointed. No flavor or anything. Just ended up adding a bunch of other spices and pesto to make this work.

I added a splash (less than 1/4 cup) of white wine, and used lemon juice and ground black pepper instead of buying a special seasoning.  I also reduced the broth amount so that the shrimp sauteed rather than boiled.  Anyway, this was great!  My husband is picky and he loved it!  We are low-carb eaters, so we made it with low-carb pasta (Dreamfields) and it was perfect.

This was so delicious!  I added fresh squeezed lemon juice  instead of the lemon pepper. Most importantly I added 1/2 Cup of white wine, sQeezed the juice of 1 lemon and the remaining chicken broth to make 1 cup total of liquid. I also added fresh basil and fresh tomatoes at the end prior to serving. For those of you that hate reviews with modifications, sorry. I happen to love them!!!!

Made this because I had the ingredients, with a few changes. I was pleasantly surprised! While pasta cooked, (I only had penne) I lightly sauted shallots (didnt have green onions) with the garlic (I used more than 2 cloves) in a small amount of butter, then added the chicken broth, a handful of spinach, and rest of the stated ingredients. Then sprinkled feta cheese over  the finished dish. Although my shrimp was precooked this still turned out good and more flavorful than expected! It makes up so fast I will definitely make it again.

I am giving this a 5 star because it's easy, & I did some alterations to give it more flavor & sauce that was not too thin.. First I made my own shrimp stock w/ the shells from the shrimp I pilled boiled it on high for 10 minutes, added lemon juice and Old Bay Lemon Herb seasoning. I strained the stock poured in a big cup. I cut up green onions, fresh italian parsley, & I put a 1 teaspoon & half mince garlic. I put olive oil in the pan & a little butter to cut the cholesterol. I use more olive oil than butter. I poured in 1 cup 1/2 of stock brought it to a boil added some Kocher Salt , little black pepper to wake up the flavors, sprinkled in lemon pepper to taste, & more lemon juice.... I then added some more stock becauce I wanted a lot of sauce. I notice the sauce was to thin.. So I pour 2/3 cup of the hot stock & a tablespoon of corn starch I stired it in till dissolved then added to the simmering sauce & it thicken up to a good sauce. I then poured the shrimp in the sauce it cooked in 10minutes. I used medium & jumbo shrimp in the sauce. While the shrimp was cooking I then added the 1/3 cup of Moscato white wine... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm this was so delicious served over whole grain thin spaghetti pasta.  I ate a plate of it & did not feel heavy or weigh down.. I will make this again .

Need to add butter,just like chicken wings butter makes the sauce stick! this recipe was watery and bland. Use seafood stock or SHRIMP stock instead of chicken stock.

Our family loves this and so do I. It is a simple, quick cook for a super dish. I do sautee onions and garlic in butter first to improve the taste more like original Scampi.

The reviewer who compared this to ramen was being generous. It was soupy, weakly flavored, and all around disappointing. I would recommend avoiding this recipe.

The sauce reminded me of the cup of noodles sauce.  Took alot for me to change the flavor and in the end it was much different than traditional scampi. Easy enough to cook, Im a college student and was very easy to follow. Its a decent recipe!

great, low calorie version of shrimp scampi!  I used a little less chicken broth and added fresh parmeson cheese.  fantastic.

Very good. I left out the green onions and used dried italian seasoning and parsley. Then the shrimp got marinated in olive oil and zesty lemon seasoning  before hitting the pan. I would say it was restaurant quality at the end. Great dine-in recipe.

VERY good for how lean this is. No butter like a traditional scampi, but definitely no sacrifice on the flavor! I added 6 (medium-small) cloves of garlic instead of the 2 the recipe calls for. However, my sister and I love garlic, so we thought it was great with the extra flavor! I infused olive oil with the garlic, then added the shrimp and other seasonings before adding it to the pasta. Delicious!

Halved the pasta, seemed like a lot of liquid.  Used fresh lemon juice and I already had cooked shrimp. Served with roasted Brussels   sprouts.

A whole box of pasta is WAY to much - there isn't enough sauce. I ended up only used about 1/4 of the cooked pasta.

We used fettuccine as the pasta and a little more garlic.  We also add broccoli florettes at the end of the cooking time just to add some vegetables and color. We cut back on the white wine because my kids just don't like that flavor. But they really enjoyed this recipe and it was super easy to make on a weeknight. We would definitely make this again!
