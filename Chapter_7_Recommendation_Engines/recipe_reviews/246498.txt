Yay sorghum! I am so happy to see recipes using this "grain". I used homemade vinaigrette and used less than a cup. This is refreshing and great on those hot days. We enjoyed this with red, sweet onions and added some cucumbers for extra crunch. Thank you for the recipe.

I love whole grains, and one with sorghum intrigued me. However,  I could not find that grain at the grocery,  so used barley, which I had on hand. All other ingredients remained as written.  It was tasty. I sprinkled the top crumbled Feta.
