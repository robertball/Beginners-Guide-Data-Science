I have to agree with sunnnij, this recipe really highlights the flavor of the corn.  There seem to be three categories of this type of recipe:  cakey, custardy, or  souffl√©-like, and varying degress of sweetness.  This results in more of a custard, with the perfect balance of sweetness to my taste.  Of course, I realize that that is a strictly personal preference, and preferences vary.  I used to use a recipe that my Mom gave me which is quite similar, but had less corn, more milk, and twice the sugar, flour and eggs.  Since I prefer canned corn, to preserve the exact proportion of corn as specified in the recipe, I used kitchen scales to weigh out 16 oz of canned Niblets corn from two 11 oz cans, which left 3.5 oz of corn leftover from the second can... I expect just using the two 11 oz cans would work fine.  The texture was more custard like, which I really liked.  To prevent excessive clumps that other reviewers mentioned, I put the flour and sugar into the mixing bowl, then added the 3/4 cup of cold milk and whisked vigorously, then added the egg and whisked again.  (Never try to add flour to any liquid that is not really cold, as the flour will immediately create lumps that will be impossible to eliminate without a sieve).  Then I nuked it for 20 seconds or so to warm it to about room temperature before adding the melted butter and corn.  Baked as specified and it came out perfect.  This is *definitely* replacing the recipe my Mom gave me (sorry, Mom!).

For a last minute dish, I used the crock pot method for a company pot luck.  Now I'm asked to bring it every time.  Since I double the receipe, I cook on the high setting.  Delicious!

I quadrupled the recipe for my church picnic, and people just ate it up! It is so easy to make, and you can do it all in one bowl and one casserole dish! The color is wonderful when baked, as it turns a nice orange on top and is very attractive. It is important to defrost and drain the corn of any extra water before using it, as the final product is a wonderful consistency when done. Thank you for the recipe!

I probably didn't make it right the first time.  My first time using a crock pot and it wasn't specified whether
the crock pot should be on high or low.  I tried it low for an hour.  It wasn't doing much so I switched it to high for the
last three hours.  It tasted pretty good.  I also tried cutting a corner.  I threw the corn in frozen instead of thawing and drying it.
The corn was sweet in a mushy mixture.  Maybe if I would have thawed and dried the corn it would have come out better.

Just super. I love corn any old way, but this gave the corn an extra flair for my big dinner party. Thanks so much, Karen! I sprinkled a bit of Parmesan on top just for a garnish and when it melted in to the dish...wow!

It was a bit sweet for a side dish.  I would probably omit the sugar next time.

I cooked this in the crock pot.  It was pretty good.  The recipe itself is great, but I forgot to add the milk until about an hour after it was cooking, so I added it late.  It was still good though!!

I followed the recipe exactly and took it to a pot luck dinner at our church; everyone loved it! I was pleased with the taste and texture, and I didn't have any leftover to bring home. I made it again a few days later for my family and again everyone enjoyed it. This recipe is a keeper!

How refreshing to find a casserole that has the true taste of the vegetable.  So many baked vegetable dishes have so many cheeses/crackers/breads/you can hardly discern what you're consuming. This is an excellent recipe for those who appreciate the clear, buttery taste of the vegetable. Great to serve at barbeques. I use frozen shoepeg corn and stir the corn from the bottom two or three times the first 30 minutes of baking.

Very tasty.  Easy side dish that can add that something extra to make a week night dinner a home run.  I might try a dash of hot sauce next time I make it, but it needs no changes at all.  Loved it.

This was a great change from plain old corn!  It's very easy, extremely handy, and it tastes comforting and delicious!  Why, you ask, did I only give it four stars...because I like to give five stars to truly amazing dishes, but don't get me wrong...you won't be sorry to give this a try!

I made this for a dinner party as a last minute side dish and everyone loved it. One suggestion for a different flavour would be to add some diced red pepper and a small amount of diced jalepeno.

Flavorless and bland.  My husband, who absolutely loves corn and would eat it everyday if he could, didn't even finish what was on his plate. I'll try to add more sugar and salt to see if that helps.

This was okay, but we like good old plain corn or canned cream corn so much better! My husband did not particularly like this.

I was disappointed with this dish, after reading so many good reviews.  It came out bland and lumpy.    Served it at our Easter dinner and no one particularly like it.  I added a little more sugar, salt and pepper to try to salvage it, which helped a little.

I was very pleased to have a new recipe to try for Thanksgiving this year.It was a big hit with my guests, however it was not what I expected. I was hoping for more of the eggy part,I think.  I will make some adjustments before trying this again.

I omitted the sugar and added one small can of diced green chiles.  This was a wonderful way to come up with a tasty side dish using ingredients I had on hand.  This is one recipe I could see myself making again and again, in a number of different versions.

yummy!!! Tried this tonight and the whole family loved it, even my 2 yr old. I added a little cooked onion and added cracker topping before I baked it and it turned out great.  I will make this again and again.

I will give this a 5 b/c it was sooo easy to prepare.  The only problem I had was the little chunks of flour that were scattered throughout the finished product.  Next time, I may sift the flour to make sure there are no clumps.  I also think that an hour may be to long to cook.  I will shorten the amount of time on my next batch.  Overall, it was good!

I've used this recipe every Thanksgiving for the last THREE years!  It's always a hit, and this year I plan to triple it for everyone.  It's a can't-miss hit.

My family thought this was bland. They said for the hour we waited for this to cook, we could have just heated the corn out of the can and it would have tasted just as good.

My friend Gail made this and it was excellent. If you're a southerner, you'll love it. I've always used cream, but after trying this recipe, I don't think it's necessary to add the extra calories.

I made this for Thanksgiving - I was looking for a corn side dish that wasn't completely loaded with sugar or cheese and this was perfect - and easy!  I used evaporated milk because I drink 2% and was afraid that would create the problem with setting that others had.  It worked great!

This corn recipe is very good! I have young children and they all wanted it.... now that was odd...ha. I don't know how healthy it is with everything you put into it but it was nice treat. I have made it 2x's this week already... I am taking it to a BBQ to get a real review of it.

my boyfriend's mother made this dish (or one like it) for Christmas and i wasn't able to take my mind off of it since it was so good. One quick search on allrecipes.com and I found it! it was so good and easy to make. Maybe I am a corn hog, but next time I will double the recipe as it was just enough for the two of us as a side dish.

I buttered a pie plate and made this recipe exactly as written. I cooked it about 1 1/2 hours, but it still tasted killer-diller. Crispy on the bottom & sides. Oddly, this recipe tastes like creme br√ªl√©e.

Agreed, Gin - Very Bland.  Husband, nearly quoting the Simpsons said to me, "What have I done to deserve this flat, flavorless corn?"  Kids who usually can't get enough corn, didn't even touch it.

Tripling the recipe...I added 1/3 cup minced jalapenos, 1/3 cup minced onion, 1/2 cup of sour cream, and 1 cup of shredded, sharp cheddar cheese into the mix and then sprinkled more on top. 
It gave it such a beautiful dark golden brown crust on top.  It was so good!  Took to potluck.  No leftovers!

This came out great and was easy.

My only change to the original recipe is that I used a half and half mixture of milk and heavy cream.

I made this as a side dish to smoked, pulled pork & it was excellent!   I ran out of milk & used 1/2 cp. heavy cream mixed with 1/4 cp. water then whisked in the flour to prevent clumping.  Afterward, I added all other ingredients.  As for sweetness, if the corn is really sweet, you could probably forego the sugar or at least reduce it.  That said, the dish was a hit & it was "easy peasy" to make.  Definitely a keeper!

I made this in the crock pot. I thought to save time and room I would throw some chicken in on top of it. It all turned out very good, but the moisture from the chicken made the corn bake kind of soupy. So that's just what I did. Made a thin white sauce, and turned it into a corn chicken chowder!!  5-stars!!!

Made this for Thanksmas and it was good.  A simple dish for people who like honest, straight forward flavors.

I was expecting this recipe to be bland but it was delicately sweet and delicious. Even my husband, who likes his food spicy, thought this was excellent -- said it was probably the best corn he has had. I followed the directions exactly.

I made this in  my small slow cooker, and it was very tasty, but, the milk/egg mixture did not set and there were little white lumps theoughout. I do not recommend slow-cooking this one at all.
  oven is best.

Good, but I would cut the butter in half; it was way to buttery for my taste.

I've made this recipe a few times and it always goes over well. It also still tastes good as leftovers too.

This was interesting, but not our favorite recipe for corn.
