This was a big hit at my house.  Leftovers made a good addition to bean soup.

I thought this would be a good recipe for a cold winters night. My husband and I enjoyed it but next time I will omit the cloves.  Even 1/4 t was overpowering.  I also doubled the white wine.

I forgot to read the reviews before I made this and have to agree on a few things.  Too much cloves for my taste but tolerable.  Woulds maybe cut down to pinch to 1/8t. Like the meat but would probably add more beans (again my liking). And maybe more wine(double?).  but I still did enjoy this dish and will make it again...it is easy.

This one was not a winner in my house...at all! When there is a recipe that is rated by so few...I usually do not even view it but thought that I would give this one a shot. Sorry now that I did  :(

Nice dish, rather heavy on the meat, but Cassoulets generally are, at least from what I've read.  I used Marsala wine (what I had open--I don't like having more than one bottle of wine in the fridge at any given time) and it worked well.  I also used black eyed peas instead of navy beans because the black eyed peas were handy at the time.  I lvoed this, and served with bread (for myself) and rice (for hubs) plus green beans.  I really liked it with the green beans that accidently mixed in this on my plate, so I think I'd add green beans or carrots or both next time--I liked the veggies with all those meat and beans.  Hubs thought it was "all right" but I definitely enjoyed this and think you could take down the meat a notch if you aren't in the mood for that much.  thanks for the recipe!

I wouldn't call this a cassoulet to a French person with a straight face, but it was tasty.  I didn't have cloves so I went a different direction and used thyme.  I also dramatically increased the beans (limas as well as navy).  The meat to bean ratio here is way in favor of meat; when I make it again I'll further increase the beans.  Good for your heart and all.

I absolutely loved this, even though I didn't put in all the sausage.  My husband didn't care for it, but I will make again just for me because it was just SO GOOD.

Good but next time I would only put a hint of cloves in.  1/4 tsp was over powering.

So, I didn't have some of the items and ended up substituting and it was delicious!  I had no white wine, but I had Cherry Moscato so I used that...double actually, so 2/3cup. I read the pork sausage as what we call "breakfast sausage" but I used kielbasa ("polish sausage" which has the benefit of being already cooked.  I read the remarks about cloves after I added them so I added thyme too.  I actually left out the onions too because I'm not a big fan.  Maybe it's a whole new recipe at this point, but it was quite tasty

This is good, I read other reviews and reduced the cloves, added more wine and beans. It is a keeper.

This recipe is okay as written but my family has always preferred it a more saucy and complex. We use two cans of great northern beans, we don't drain them. I like to use a mix of sausage, ham and bacon. Fresh onion and garlic is a must. Fresh parsley as well. I also like to add some chopped carrot and celery for a flavor boost.  I also use more wine, keep the cloves the same and I add a bay leaf. Makes a very flavorful sauce.

This was fabulous. I made a few small changes. I used 1 onion, added ½ a green pepper, and some frozen peas. I also added ½ cup of instant rice to bulk it up a bit, which of course meant I had to increase the liquid. I would add ½ cup of wine and ½ cup of water or broth to this recipe as well, if you add rice.

Just too darn meaty for me.  I think it'd make maybe a nice side dish, perhaps cutting back on the meat quanities.  Unfortunately, I'll be removing this from my recipe box.
