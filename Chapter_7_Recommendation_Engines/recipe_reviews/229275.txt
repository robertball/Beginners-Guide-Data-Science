I made this last night and my wife loved it. Everyone went back for 2nd's. It used up a lot of left over vegetables that were hanging around in the fridge. Don't forget the beer! I used a stout but any dark beer should work fine.

After browning beef, I spooned it into a crock pot.  Followed directions as printed except the use of crock pot.  Needed a little red pepper (1T)..Also added 12 oz V8 Juice.

I made this for dinner last night and it got mixed reviews from my family.
My husband says it absolutely needed potatoes in it. My kids didn't like the cabbage. All of this isn't not the recipe's fault, rather personal tastes - So it gets 4 stars. It had decent flavor and was easy to make. I will probably tweak it in the future.

A delicious, hearty stew. Made the following changes based on our family's preferences: Used red wine instead of beer; left out cabbage, celery and mushrooms; threw in carrots and fingerling potatoes. Also didn't use the brown sugar.  Served with freshly baked French bread. Will definitely make again.

This was wonderful.  The beer really gave it a deep, rich flavor and was better than using tomato paste since I am allergic to tomatoes.  I also substituted leeks for the onions (another allergy) and parsnips and daikon for the carrot (another allergy) and I put in a little less garlic because of my reflux disease.  I ended up using a small amount of mushroom broth because I was out of my beef broth - we use Better Than Bullion brand.  
The flavor was outstanding and the family requested this to be served more often.

It was very good and easy to adapt for familyâ€™s taste ( I left out the mushrooms). Will definitely make it again!

This recipe was quite nice and the whole family loved it. I forgot the celery at the store and reduced the onion per family preference but otherwise followed as given. I don't know if it's because I don't normally drink/use beer in cooking, but the only drawback for me was a slight aftertaste of the beer I used. I'll definitely try this again but with a different type of beer in hopes that it will lessen the aftertaste.

Everyone really loved this dish.  I made it with a few changes.  I didn't have any beer so I used red wine.  I changed the # of servings at the last minute and had to use some Italian sausage because I didn't have enough stew beef.  Out of eight people I'm the only one that likes cabbage so I used small red potatoes instead.  I would make this again.
