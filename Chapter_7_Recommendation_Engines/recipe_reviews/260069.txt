The only way I could see making these is if you were baking for someone with specific dietary constraints necessitating these ingredients. They taste incredibly fake sweet and just, in general, fake (and I have no issues with “fake”; my friends like to joke I carry an MSG shaker in my purse). The texture was fine, hence the “extra” star. I appreciate the attempt, but these are a hard pass for us (as in, one bite and the other 11 cookies are probably trash bound. OK, faculty room at work bound, as not to waste.).

Very fragile cookies. The dough was hard to keep together. They kept falling apart when I tried rolling them into balls. Baked for 14 minutes and even after cooling on wire racks for 30 minutes they still crumble easily. For a sugar free cookie, they are pretty good.

I think these are ok. If you are in need of something sweet and have dietary restrictions from real sugar, I could see these doing the trick, but they're entirely way too sweet for me. I didn't have a problem with them being crumbly like some others have and I was able to whip these up very quickly. I would definitely cut back on some of the sweetener if I ever made them again.

Awesome peanut butter flavor and easy to make. I found that an after taste was there but I do not consume sugar substitutes much so I referred to friends and family that do. They loved them!

These have a distinct cooling and unusual aftertaste. They were hard to form because they were so crumbly, but oddly enough, they held together after they cooked and cooled. My grandchildren didn’t care for them.

Made these as directed and at first bite I though these were good however in the end the bitter aftertaste of substitute sugar comes through. I will keep working with Pyure Stevia to see if I can come up with a happy medium.

I was hoping to really like these. They were just too sweet to me. I couldn't really taste the peanut butter taste. They taste strongly of the sweetner. They are also a bit crumbly and oily. I read someone's review about the dough not coming together. So, I just used 1 egg for half the recipe which I made to test the recipe. That amount made 9 cookies for half the recipe. I could try adjusting the recipe for more peanut butter taste, and cookie texture, by adding more peanut butter, peanut powder, or butter for richness. I think, that could work. It was interesting trying an alternative sugar product for baking.

If it were just based on my opinion, I'd rate these cookies 3 stars, but my kids enjoyed them so I gave them 4. 
Other reviewers stated they were crumbly and fragile, so I only baked them for 8 minutes and then let them sit on the pan for additional 10 minutes. This definitely helped them stay softer and they weren't crumbly. However, I just did not care for the very strong, artificial taste of the liquid vanilla flavor stevia. It was overpowering to me. I think using real vanilla extract would give them a better flavor and they will still be sweet enough.

I'm impressed! As a mom of a diabetic child I have tried every alternative to sugar and never loved anyone of them. These cookies were DELICIOUS! I am sold! My son is going to be so surprised when he finds out they are sugar free and taste great!

Was afraid they would have that 'artificial sweetener aftertaste'. Taste wise I was quite pleased - with 3 grams of carbs and almost 5 grams of protein per cookie, these were a good substitute for 'the real thing'. Downside is that they are extremely fragile and crumbly. I will definitely make again but wish I could figure out a way to keep them together better.
