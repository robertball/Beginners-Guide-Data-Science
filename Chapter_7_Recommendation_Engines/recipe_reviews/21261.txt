Superb!!  OK..I changed some things...added some things..made it MUCH BETTER!!!  I am from Louisiana...so I grew up eating sweet potatoes year round.  But holiday time always mean Sweet potato Casserole..this one is the closest to how my granny and mom made it.  I used 3 BAKED sweet potatoes (I often double the recipe).  For a single recipe I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and I double the vanilla up to 1 tsp.  I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I add 1 tsp of cinnmon, 1/4 tsp of both ground clove and ground nutmeg.  For the topping..I double the recipe even on the single recipe.  Does that make sense?? LOL  ENJOY!!!!

I am 50 years old and my family has made basically this same casserole all my life - it's very common in the South.  A TIP:  it's much more flavorful if you use baked sweet potatoes - baked for at least 1.5 to 2 hours to bring out their full flavor - than if you boil them.  It's also a lot easier - just cut the cooked potatoes in half and scoop out their goodness - no peeling!  And do not substitute other nuts for pecans.  It's just not the same without the true southern nut meant for sweet potatoes!

Yummy is right!! I made this today as a trial run for Thanksgiving (and this will be the dish I am taking!).  I baked my potatoes (3-medium sized) for 1 hour.  I cut them and placed into my food processor with the other ingredients (and I doubled the vanilla to 1 tsp).  This came out so so so smooth - it's a wonderful texture.

I doubled the topping and it was plenty (maybe could use a bit more even) as soon as I took it from the oven I had to try it and it's delicious!  I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.
**If you boil your potatoes, you leave the skin on and peel when they're done. 
*UPDATE* I made this again with canned sweet potatoes and while it was good it isn't AS good as fresh baked potatoes.  I suggest if you want to impress your guests stick to the baked potatoes, it's more work BUT so worth it. Plus with canned potatoes it was runny and not whipped - we didn't care for that.

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving based on all the positive reviews here, and my family loved it!  The recipe claims it serves 12, but we finished it off with only 8 people, so I'd recommend making extra if you are serving a hungry crowd.  

I found that baking the sweet potatoes helped them retain a better flavor than boiling them.  I put 5 large sweet potatoes on a cookie sheet in a 375F oven for about 1 1/4 hours.  Then I sliced them in half and used a potholder to squeeze the potatoes.  The insides popped right out of the skin; I didn't even need a spoon.

Oh, and if you think the recipe would  be improved by doubling the amount of pecan/butter/sugar topping, I'd recommend against it.  It will taste delicious, but you'll end up with unappetizing pools of butter on the top.

I did the following....just microwaved my potatoes until fully cooked and then sliced them and placed cut side down into an 8X11 pan.  I  combinded the topping ingredients (flour, sugar, butter and nuts) and crumbled it on top of the potatoes and baked for 20 minutes....TO DIE FOR...and much lower in fat and calories than making the "casserole".  You might want to note that the topping does NOT spread (the flour prevents it) so how ever you top it...that's how it will look when it comes out of the oven.  Just wanted to let you know being I thought it would melt and spread a bit...but it does not!  Very good recipe, will make again!

This is a wonderful recipe with a few minor tweeks...  Start with baking 6 sweet potatos (ensure that they are the same size so the consistentcy is the same as they cook), instead of boiling.  Add 1/2-1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves to the sweet potatoes as you mash them.  Use 3/4 to 1 cup of evaporated milk instead of regular.  Use 1 tsp of vanilla.  Double ALL of the ingredients for the pecan topping and give the pecans a rough chop so there aren't any big pieces.  Add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping mixture.~~~ If you try it this way, you will never make another sweet potato casserole dish.  This makes the BEST sweet potato casserole ever!  Happy eating and enjoy!

This was great. Roasting the yams whole in foil for an hour or so depending on the size of your yams gives awesome flavor instead of boiling...
The family gobbled this up!!!

This is a good start, but as the previuos reviewer suggested, you MUST roast the sweet potatos..it brings out all the natural sugars and sweetness.  Now here is my addition...the last 15 minutes you are roasting the potatos, put whole bananas, skin on, and roast them for 15 minutes until they turn black.  The bananas roast in their own skin and oils and become like banana pudding.  Add that to the puree, with a touch of maple syrup for sweetness.  Guaranteed to please!

Made this recipe twice with great results! Used brown sugar instead of white and added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  We like it cold, too!

I took a chance and added this untried recipe to my Thanksgiving menu and it was the star dish of the feast! Everyone raved and insisted on taking the recipe home. I only used 1/2 the amount of sugar as I worried it would be too 'desserty' -- and it was absolutely wonderful! I will be making it every year. Thank you Tina for sharing this gem!

Hey folks, I make this with CANNED sweet potatoes and get rave reviews!!  One large can (40 oz I think) is just over 4 cups (I use the whole can), but the trick is to boil them in the syrup for awhile to get them kinda mushy, then drain and mash them in a bowl... I use evaporated milk and add some pumpkin pie spice!  Absolutley outstanding, and I hope this makes it a little easier for someone! ;)

Oh, these sweet potatoes were soooooo good! I made some changes to the original recipe in an attempt to lighten up the dish and save some fat and calories. The results were excellent. I reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup, used one egg and one egg white instead of a second whole egg, reduced the butter in the sweet potato mixture to 2 Tbsp, and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp. I super-simplified the topping by just drizzling 1/4 cup pure maple syrup over the top and sprinkling 1/3 cup of finely chopped pecans over top. Very decadent tasting and my entire family cleaned this dish up. I am filing this recipe in my favorites album and it will be the go to recipe for sweet potatoes in my family from now on!!

This recipe has been in my family for over 30 years and I have made it countless times to rave reviews.  I have passed this recipe on more than any other over the years, but mine is different in just a couple of subtle ways.  I have NEVER added milk to the sweet potato mixture, and my recipe calls for 1 1/2 teaspoons of vanilla.  I always use a mixer to beat the eggs well, then add the sugar, salt and vanilla and beat until blended.  I add the potatoes, beat until smooth, and mix in the butter last.  I use 1 cup of chopped pecans for the topping, instead of 1/2 cup.  I bake it at 350 for 35 minutes.  It puffs up beautifully, and the topping gets nice and brown.  I would also recommend a different sized casserole dish.  I use a 2 quart Corning Ware casserole, which is more square.  You get nice deep layers of both sweet potatoes and topping.  I have doubled and tripled this recipe, but have never used more than double the topping.

I have made this recipe by baking the potatoes, and I have made it by boiling them.  My sister swears the boiling is easier and I might agree.  It's a little "neater"; just make sure they are drained well.  As for a difference in taste, I'm not sure it's noticeable.  My family seems to give a slight edge to boiled - they have raved about my sister's the last few times she has made them, and didn't know that she had opted to boil versus bake the potatoes.  One last note, my personal preference is to use jewel yams.  I find them a bit more flavorful!

This was a hit. Not too sweet at all.  I doubled the topping recipe but only used about two thirds of it (just eyeballed to cover the top of the casserole). I bought sweet potatoes that were locally grown, not sure if that made any difference and I baked them instead of boiling (4 large potatoes took 1 and 1/2 hours on 375 degrees). I made the casserole the day before and stored it in the fridge overnight. Made the topping the next day and threw it in the oven for 30 minutes. Very easy to make.

I'm a Southern Man who loves to cook.  Great dish, but I make mine with a slight twist:  I use condensed and evaported milk in the mixture. I also, add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg to the potatoes, with a full teaspoon of vanilla.  You talk about Yummy! For the topping I also add sweetend coconut flakes (even my friends and family who don't like coconut LOVE it)!  I also bake my potatoes first for 30 minutes prior to adding the topping and baking  for an additional 15 minutes.  Thanks to my great grandmother, grandmother,  mother and aunts for letting me watch, help and TASTE in their kitchens!

Just a suggestion - I have the same recipe and you can use a 40 Oz. can of sweet potatoes (well-drained) and the results are YUMMY and it's alot easier then cooking the sweet potatoes

I made the recipe to test it out prior to making it for a party, and I just didn't find the recipe very enjoyable. Also, it felt more like I was baking then cooking. Something about the entire casserole was far too sweet. I normally love sweet potatoes but I don't know if I did something wrong, or if it's just the recipe.  I did as someone said and baked the sweet potatoes, I may have baked them a little too long though..  Thanks for the experience, but this recipe just didn't cut it for me..

THANK YOU Tina B!! For sharing your wonderful recipe :) & everyone else for their extra tips. Served this yesterday at our friends pre-Thanksgiving potluck & people went back for just this. My husband who does not like yams tried this out of respect for me & loved it. Yes..he requested the lil' bit of leftovers we had left next to his scrambled eggs for breakfast this morning.. lol. I made a 25-serving recipe, baked 4-jumbo yams 1hr & 45min=( made 8-cups) Skin came right off. Added less milk (only 1/2cup) then the 1cup the recipe advises because many comments said it was a lil more runny then they wanted. Glad I did use less, it was very moist still & turned out great. I also added 1/2 tsp nutmeg & cinnamon. (TIP:) I made the yam mixture & put it in 18x10 inch pan the night before & it kept great in the fridge. Just made the topping the next day, & added just before baking. Also used brown sugar only in this recipe & 100% whole grain wheat flour for the topping cuz thats all I had. Couldn't tell the difference. Baked about 45min.

Very good!  I accidentally made way too many potatoes, but it turned out very good anyway.  I ended up doubling the topping, which was fantastic.  One note, I read several times in reviews that the topping would not "crumble" as the recipe states.  The recipe also states to make the crumble topping with softened butter...This is not the best approach.  If you want your topping to crumble - use cold butter, right out of the fridge.  Crumbles everytime.  Also helps to mix the crumble topping with your hands instead of a utensil.

Excellent recipe.I really don't gove 5 stars unless it warrants.  I'll bet those who say,"I don't like Sweet Potatoes" Will change their tune after just a bite of this. I did BAKE the potatoes in the OVEN. This brings out the syrup,therefore much more flavor! Please no canned yams.I know using canned may seem to cut time,but you're also cutting your flavor in half by using them.

Whoa - this is dessert, not a traditional side dish. For a toned-down version, leave out the white sugar entirely and just use the brown sugar called for in the topping. Part of the problem with this recipe is calling for 4 "cups" of cubed sweet potatoes - very hard to measure. I used two large SPs (measured in at 4 cups) and came up with barely enough to line the bottom of my casserole dish.

Easy and delicious! I made it for Thanksgiving trial run with friends and it was a HUGE hit. I took the advise of others and baked the potatoes (4 large sweet potatoes baked for an hour). Then I squeezed them out of the skins and mixed the other stuff in. I added 1/2 tsp cinnamon and nutmeg and 1/4 tsp ginger and omitted the salt. I did not double the topping as others have suggested. I can see how people would like that because the topping delicious. However, by not doubling it, it was a pleasant surprise when you got a bite of the topping without being overly sweet. I will make again for sure!

This recipe beats all other sweet potato casserole recipes!! I am definitely making this for Thanksgiving. Here are some changes I thought helped: 1) Instead of boiling the potatoes, put them peeled and cubed in the oven on a well-greased baking sheet until they are tender. 2) use brown sugar instead of regular sugar. 3) double the vanilla 4) add 1/2 - 1 teas. of the following spices: nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves. 6) if you want, toast the pecans before you add them to the topping. This is not absolutely necessary because they will be in the oven later, but if you would like more flavor from the pecans, toast them. 7) When you make this, be aware that the topping will not spread out when baked - the flour prevents it. So however you spread the topping, that's how it's going to look when it's done. I hope you like this recipe as much as I did! :)

Although I haven't actually tried this specific recipe, it's very similar to the sweet potato dish my family has always made for the holidays, especially with the pecan topping.  Just a couple tips to make it easier-if you boil the sweet potatoes whole until soft, the skin just falls off and then they are very easy to mash.  Also, for the topping, our recipe is very similar, except we use 1 cup brown sugar, 1/3 cup flour, 1 cup chopped pecans and 1 stick butter.  Melt the butter, and just mix everything together, then spoon over the sweet potatoes.  I hope you enjoy this Southern dish (hence all the pecans!) as much as we always have!  I much prefer the crunchy pecan topping (a nice contrast to the sweet potatoes) to anything with marshmallows! :)

Absolutely delicious!  I baked 5 very large (6" long) sweet potatoes (which were each wrapped in foil) until soft, this fit perfectly in a 9X13 pan.  The smell of them baking was amazing, I advise lining the baking sheet with foil so the candied juices don't bake to the cookie sheet.  I took the advice of another reviewer and cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup, doubled the vanilla up to 1 tsp.,  evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I used hand held beaters to make it fluffy.  I made the same amount of topping and found it was more than enough.  Everyone loved this dish at Thanksgiving, it was the right amount of sweetness without tasting too 'desserty'.

I've been making this every thanksgiving for the past 5 years, everywhere I go everyone loves it and asks for the recipe. I've made it with both sweet potoes and yams. It's better when you use yams- but I always forget which is which! Yams are orange- sweet potatoes are yellow. It tastes great either way- but it's much creamier made with yams.

I wish people would not give lower ratings because of the way they feel recipes should taste like.  This recipe turned out perfectly.  Yes, it might be too sweet for some people but that is the way the recipe is designed.  I like sweet food so this is a GREAT recipe.  My kids even devoured it.  I would not change a thing.  Thank you for a great recipe.

A hit at Thanksgiving, with a few adjustments based on other reviews. Baked the sweet potatoes, cut out the white sugar completely, used evaporated milk instead of reguar milk, added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg. Yummy, indeed!!

I am 58 years old, from Georgia, and have been eating a version of this recipe all my life.  I gave it only 3 stars because it is bland without cinnamon and nutmeg added.  Add  tsp of each, and you will have a 5 star recipe!

This dish is the most requested of all the holiday dishes in my family. It is the first dish to be wiped clean out too. The only difference is that I add miniture marshmellows on top with extra pecans. It makes a lovely presentation with the toasted tips. An attention getter for the young ones as well as the adults.

Love this recipe.  I've been making it for several years now and it is the only way my family eats sweet potatoes.  I always used canned, drained, sweet potatoes, it's much quicker.

We love sweet potatoes and we really loved this recipe.  After reading some of the reviews that said this was too sweet, I added 2 more cups of potatoes and kept the sugar at 1/2 cup.  I also did not put as much of the topping on as indicated in the recipe.

Also, I never boil my sweet potatoes or yams.  I preheat the oven to 400 degrees, take the whole potatoes, rinse, dry well, coat the skin with vegetable oil and bake in a pan until tender (usually about an hour depending on the size of the potatoes).  The skin pulls away from the meat of the potato so you can pull it right off this works great for baked sweet potatoes too.  Then I mixed the ingredients in the food processor using the pastry blade.  If you do this, be sure to pulse, not run steady or the potatoes will "liquefy" too much and not give you a good consistency when baked.

This is a great recipe that I have made for years.  You can make ahead and freeze to make life easier. Make recipe put into a casserole dish, put plastic wrap and then foil over top. Place in freezer UNBAKED.  Take out of the freezer a day ahead and thaw in the frig. Bake as usual. Turns out great!!!

This a truly wonderful side dish. Per reviews I made few changes, but nothing that would affect the overall rating. I did cut the sugar in half and added 1 tsp. cinnamon to the potato mixture. I doubled the vanilla. One time I baked my potatoes in the microwave, let them cool a bit, peeled them and then diced them. another time I baked them in the oven at 375 degrees for 1 1/2 hours. I put the potatoes and the other ingredients into my Kitchen Aid mixer bowl, and whipped it all up with the whipping attachment. I am not sure how they come out if you don't do that. But my recipe came out light and fluffy...really wonderful!!! Although I liked the topping I would cut the flour amount. I am not sure why it is even needed, but I noticed that similar recipes called for it, so I did do use it. People who generally do not like sweet potatoes, but were willing to try this recipe, did enjoy it. Thanks Tina, this is an amazing recipe!!!

I used the topping as described by Jennifer - 1C Brown Sugar, 1/3C Flour, 1C Chopped Pecans, and 1C Melted Butter, but added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg.  I subbed 1 large can of Yams and drained then mashed extremely well.  Also added 1tsp cinnamon and 1tsp nutmeg to potatoe mixture and subbed heavy cream for milk.  Before transferring to 9x13 we cooked in pan over low/medium for 30-1hour to incorporate all flavors well.  Also made the potatoes much creamier.  Everyone that tried this, including those who hate sweet spuds couldn't get over it.  We then ate it warm with ice cream for dessert that night.  Lasted one day, no leftovers!!

Made "this" for my husband's family for my first Thanksgiving with them... they LOVED it. But I made a few changes... I used 6 large sweet potatoes, wrapped in aluminum foil with butter, and baked for an hour at 400 degrees instead of boiling. This was WAY easier because I didn't have to peel or cut, they just fell right out of the skin. It ended up being around 6.5 cups of sweet potatoes so a little over 150% of the recipe, and then I doubled the rest of the ingredients. I also followed one of the suggestions from a comment and added a 2 teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of each nutmeg and cloves (remember, I doubled EVERYTHING) and used Evaporated Milk instead of regular. For the topping I also sprinkled extra pecans on top. 

This made a little more than just a 9x13 pan so I had a 9x13 to take to my husband's large family get together and an 8x8 for ourselves which worked perfectly because today we are having a small family thing with just his parents.

My southern family adds a touch of bourbon to this sweet potato casserole - really enhances the flavor! Use 1/8 to 1/4 cup or to your own taste.

I make this delicious dish all year long. You can use canned sweet potatoes and get the same tasting results. I've also used evaporated milk, and half & half before, when I was out of milk.

This is absolutely delicious!!!!!!!  I never used to like sweet potatos, but this is awesome!  I brought this to my mother-in-laws as a dish to pass for our early Thanksgiving and the compliments didn't stop.  I know that this will be asked of me to bring every year!  Thanks for the great recipe, Tina!!!

This recipe may taste good for some but it is not good for you, it adulterates the fine nutrients in the potato.  The best way to eat this is to wrap it up in foil and bake it for an hour or so at 350, it will make its own natural sugar and your body will benefit the most from it.  It really tastes good this way.  Try it!

My family has requested that this recipe become my signature Thanksgiving Dish. It was fabulous. But only after I made a change to it. Once the potatoes were mashed with all the other ingredients I found the consistency to be like a thick soup, ie. liquidy (icky, maybe that's the way it's supposed to be -I'm Canadian and not familiar with most southern food - , but I was expecting the consistency of normal mashed potatoes, just sweeter). I therefore ended up doubling the potatoes while leaving everything else the same. That was absolutely perfect.

2 of us loved it, 2 of us liked it.  I reduced the sugar by half and it was plenty sweet.  Would have been better with more sweet potatoes to the ratio against the topping, so next time I will make at least 6 cups of potatoes.

I use my food processor and mix up a big batch of the topping. I keep it in a zip lock bag in the freezer. In a pinch I used the sweet potatoes in the dairy case. This is my husbands favorite food.

I made this and brought it to Christmas dinner with in-laws as well as made it for my own family Christmas dinner.This dish was fantastic, it travels easiely,smells great and taste amazing. I made a few small changes I baked the potatoes in oven for 1 1/2 hrs at 375 this does bring out the natural sweetness and potatoes just sqeeze out of their skins I also added nutmeg and clove, used condensed milk instead of milk,reduced the sugar to 1/4 cup and used pure vanilla. For the topping I used 1 cup chopped pecans and added 2tsp cinnamon. This smells so good baking in the oven.This is a sweet dish like other reviews have stated try your mashed sweet potatoes first before adding your sugar start at 1/8cup and add from there as needed will sweeten up as it bakes as well. This could easiley be made vegetarian/vegan/diabetic by altering the dairy/sugar ingredients

I have a question.  I love Sweet Potato Casserole and usually I make it for Thanksgiving.  I take the sweet potatoes and microwave them then scoop out the potato and go from there.  My question is this?  When I boil the sweet potato do I peel it first and place the cubed potato in the water?  Or do I place the whole potato with the peeling on and boil then peel?  Help?????

LOVE IT!!!  To cut down on prep time  I used canned (drained) Sweet Potato.  My husband was dead set against even trying this recipe but all it took was one bite.  If I don't take a serving out before it hits the table I am out of luck!!! 
You got'a try this!!!!

I've made this several times now and even for a diabetic father - I use 1/8 cup Splenda and 1/8 cup sugar and it is still sweet, I also use 1/3 cup brown sugar in the topping.

Listen, this casserole is an indulgent sweet.  It's not a savory dish and if you don't like sweet potatoes or yams, don't go into it thinking you'll come out liking them on the other side.  

My grandmother had been making this recipe for years.  I'm guessing from a Betty Crocker cook book.  I really like it.  But I upped the sweet potatoes casserole game and have never looked back.

I stopped pretending this was a casserole and got real with myself.  I threw the whole thing in a pie shell and baked it with double the topping.  Best sweet potato pie ever.  EVER.  I up the ante with pumpkin pie spice and adding a bit more vanilla.  We still serve it warm and it was an instant hit with the family.  Every year this is part of our Thanksgiving tradition.

I have made this recipe a few times for family gatherings.  It really is good--but sweet.  Myself & others who I know that don't care for sweet potato casseroles usually don't eat them but find ourselves eating this one.  The topping is basically like a candy flavor that masks the bitter flavor of what most sweet potato casseroles cannot hide.

I discovered this recipe when asked to make a sweet potato casserole for a family function.  Having never made one before, I didn't realize most casseroles people make are with canned chunk potatoes.  This gives a much fresher, better flavor.  My first time I made the mistake of adding marshmallows to the top of this because I was told sweet potato casseroles always have them.  Our family decided this recipe is too sweet with them, and therefore, that is why the recipe does not call for them.  So... if you are a first timer making this like I was, don't add marshmallows even if people tell you this casserole needs them (before trying this casserole).  It is very good without modifications.  But if you want to cut the sweetness, you may want to follow some reviewers suggestions.

I think the trick for this dish is to gradually add the sugar a bit at a time and taste-taste-taste! I'd imagine that how sweet the dish is will vary depending of how you prepare the sweet potatoes. I roasted mine and only needed half the sugar. I think if you boiled them, you might need to add more :)

I was pretty blown away by this recipie I must admit! I did not have high expectations considering how mashed the recipie called for the sweet potatoes to be...almost like mashed potatoes; nonetheless the "casserole," as some may call it- I'd call it more of a dessert- was beyond amazing to the taste buds, and believe it or not there was no baking involved! I served it to people who completely disliked sweet potatoes but even they fell in love with the casserole! I would have liked a thicker consistency but I'll settle. All in all:  Taste: 5 stars Simplicity: 5 stars Presentation: 2 stars Satisfaction: 4 stars

I made this recipe tonight to go with glazed ham and green beans.  I am normally not a fan of sweet potato casserole but I had two helpings of this!  I baked my sweet potatoes instead of boiling and used an electric mixer to get a smooth, sort of fluffy texture to the sweet potatoes.  I also drizzled a tablespoon of real maple syrup over the topping before putting it in the oven.  Delicious!

Loved it! I made a few minor changes based on other reviewers recommendations. I baked the yams for 1.5 hours.  I also cut the sugar in 1/2 worried that it would be too sweet with the full amount recommended. Chopped the pecans in a food processer so they were a little more finely chopped. I had 10 guests for dinner and this recipe was the hit of the party! I will definitely make this again.  Highly recommended!

I have made this recipe now a dozen times or so...it is just the perfect sweep potato casserole recipe.  4 large sweet potatoes = 4 cups, and bake them at 350 for 2 hours instead of cooking on stovetop.  You can make this several days ahead of time.

Made this for a football tailgate party. Everyone loved it! Will definitely make it again. Here's what I changed based on the suggestions of other All-Recipers:  (1) Instead of boiling the potatoes (or using canned yams), I roasted the whole, fresh sweet potatoes for about 90 minutes at 350 then, when cooled, halved the potatoes and scooped out the flesh. (2) used evaporated milk. (3) doubled the vanilla (4) used my hand mixer to blend all ingredients till smooth. (5) Baked the dish longer than 30 mins - about 40 mins or so. Made the topping better.  I made the dish the night before and took it out of the fridge about an hour before baking to bring the dish closer to room temp prior to baking. This recipe truly lives up to its name - YUMMY!

instead of peeling and boiling the potatoes bake them and scoop put the insides. Not only will save the pain of peeling the difficult potato it will help with the caramelization of the casserole

Very easy and yummy. I couldn't find sweet potatoes in my supermarket, so I substituted with Japanese pumpkin instead. I microwaved them in the steam mode and mashed them to measure 2 cups. I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 5 tablespoons maple syrup and added a pinch of cinnamon to the pumpkin batter as well. And instead of baking in a 9 x 13 pan, I use 8 small clay pots which gave a cute, rustic look to the dish. One tip for storage--put a piece of paper towel on top of the baking pan/ pots before wrapping again with the plastic wrap. The paper towel will help to absorb the moisture and keep the streusel crunchy in the fridge.

Really good!  I put mine in a round dish so it took longer to cook (deeper pan).  I would stick with the 9x13 pan, as my topping was a little dark.  I did double the topping as a few suggested.  Better than the traditional marshmellow topped sweet potatos, for sure! :)

This is very, very sweet - practically a candy bar.  The sugar content overwhelms the taste of potato, making it a better dessert dish than dinner side.  Will not make again.

like others I added spices... 1 teaspoon cinnamon and dash each cloves, nutmeg and ginger. used half and half. this casserole is superb and the topping is to die for. also, bake your potatoes then cool some before peeling. much better texture.

I make this several times a year, not just at holiday time. It gets tweaked a bit for more comfort and flavor factors. I use brown sugar for both the sweet potatoes and topping, substitute heavy cream for the milk and add 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground ginger and 1/8 tsp ground cloves to the sweet potatoes. In the topping I use 1 cup of chopped pecans instead of 1/2. This goes well when I feel like baking a ham or pork roast any time of the year.

I generally make a recipe like it says the first time and "tweak" it after if necessary.  So, I made this just like it said and we LOVED it.  I usually do candied sweet potatoes but decided on a casserole for timing purposes.  My family went NUTS over this one.  The phrase "pass the sweet potatoes" was used over and over at our dinner table.  Reading comments about baking the potatoes makes it better makes me wonder... could it REALLY be BETTER???  I might have to try that to see.

Tried this as a trial for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I cut the sugar in the potatoes by half and will do the same again next time (used splenda).  Made double the topping but didn't need it all.  I put it in a smaller than 9X13 casserole.  If making for more than 6 people I would definitely double the recipe for a 9X13 dish.  A single recipe worth would be very thin in a 9X13.  For Thanksgiving I plan to double the potatoes and topping (maybe a bit more than double the topping) and use a 9X13.

Very tasty and pretty easy, the one thing the recipe doesn't say is how long to boil the potatoes for, I boiled them for about 12 min., until they were fork tender.

I get frequent requests for this dish.  I use 3-4 baked sweet potatoes (350 degrees, 1 - 1.5 hours). brown sugar 1/4 cup; vanilla up to 1 tsp; 1 tsp of cinnmon, 1/4 tsp of both ground clove and ground nutmeg (each).  Made topping as directed.

Yummy!  As suggested by others, I baked the sweet potatoes (400 degrees for 1 hour...probably could've used another 15 minutes).  I also decreased the sugar by half.

Great casserole.  Definitely BAKE the potatoes.  I peeled them first, cut them in thirds, wrapped them all together in foil and baked for 2 hours.  Also, I split 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/4 cup of brown sugar in the mix.  

Try 1/3 cup of corn flakes in the topping.  Grind them up in processor and add them before the butter.  I think it helped to keep the butter in check, and it added some crunch to the topping!

Delicious!  Baked 6 medium-sized unpeeled sweet potatoes in 325degree oven for 2 to 2 1/2 hours instead of boiling.  cooled them for about 15 min. and then cut them in half and they practically peeled themselves.  I also used 1 tea. vanilla & 1 tea. cinnamon because I really like the aroma and taste of these two ingredients.  I didn't use any flour, and I topped with marshmallows instead of using pecans (family quirk).  They were creamy, sweet, delicious, GONE!!!

This recipe is awesome... even my picky kids will eat it. My oldest daughter (11yo) loves to help prepare this for family dinners. It's like a sweet potato pie without the pie crust.

I always replace sugars with sugar substitute. I also add cinnamon about a tsp. I make a day or two ahead and then it's ready to pop in the oven to save time. Stores great in the frig just before baking step.

I made this for the first time last Thanksgiving once for my family and once for a holiday gathering.  My kids now ask for this over any other side dish we make at the holidays, and everyone at our party absolutely loved this spin on a sweet potato casserole.  This is one of the best ways I have ever tasted sweet potatotes.

Wow! I made this last night to go with turkey and the trimmings and I couldn't be more pleased! I did use evaporated milk and splenda but those were the only changes. It was rich and just so...delicious! This is definitely a keeper! Thanks for the recipe!

FYI - Consider using a ricer to squeeze the hot potatoes through to decrease the 'strings'.  I've been using a similar recipe for years and an inexpensive ricer definitely makes a difference.  I've used canned and fresh potatoes - go with fresh!

I wrapped the sweet potatoes in foil and baked them for about 1 hour to keep them from absorbing too much water and to enhance their flavor. Once cooled, I just squeezed out the flesh - no peeling necessary. I used brown sugar instead of white sugar. I totally left out the butter and milk- it did not need it, and boy did that save a lot of fat and calories! next time I will probably leave out the eggs as I thought they would hold the sweet potatoes more firmly together - but it did not make a difference - the texture was mushy so the eggs didn't add much. I added about 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture. This got rave reviews from all of my guests! I will make it again.

So easy to make, you can do it the night before or even days before. I use way less on the sugar front. The pecan topping with brown sugar is really enough sugar you can really leave out the white sugar. I now have multiple family members asking for this!

This was delicious! I was thinking of taking this to my in laws for Thanksgiving, and thought I'd give it a trial run today. I know some people changed a couple of things, but I pretty much followed the recipe. The only thing I did different was bake 4 large sweet potatoes at 375 for about 1 hour 20 min. I cut them it half, and squeezed the insides out. It was so much easier to not have to use a spoon! It came out perfect, I'm definitely looking forward to making it again for Thanksgiving :)

Waaaaaaay too sweet! The topping is as thick as the potato...if I made it again I'd double the potatoes and use the same amount for the topping, but definitely decrease the amount of sugar all together. No one ate more than a taste...Way to sweet-won't make again.

We eat a lot of sweet potatoes and normally just bake then in chunks with a little cinnamon but this was a super yummy switch. I baked, instead of boiled, the potatoes and mashed them in the same pan. I just used a spoon to mix the egg mixture in. The less dirty dishes the better:) Since we don’t use a lot of sugar I will cut that back next time but the rest was great.

I had Thanksgiving dinner early this year and made this dish yesterday.  It was excellent!  It was very easy and the topping made the dish. I also baked the sweet potatoes in the oven at 350 degrees for about 2 hours, came out perfect!

High Fives to Tina! Even people who didn't care for sweet potato's absolutly LOVED this! My topping covered the whole thing and was very crunchy and yummy. I microwaved the potato's instead and used a fork to scoop out, no mashing required. My family's newest tradition is born. Thank you.

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved. People that never eat Sweet-Potato-Anything started trying it because of all of the ranting and raving and they all loved it! I made several dishes and they all came out really good, but no one could hold themselves back from this and the Cranberry Sauce Extraordinaire.

Had lots of compliments on this dish.  I increased the ingredients by 1/2 and it still turned out great.  Next time, though, will use less sugar; was a bit sweet for my taste.

I made this with canned sweet potatoes, used slightly less sugar per other reviewers advice.  Did not add the pecans, however did add some marshmallows.  Very yummy.  I know have to make this every Thanksgiving per my families orders.

this is almost identical to a recipe I have been making for years at Thanksgiving.there are only two differences that I can see;this recipe uses milk, and in the topping it uses flour. The recipe I have calls for evaporated milk (same amount), and instead of flour, you crush up some Frosted Flakes and mix them with the sugar and butter. This recipe really is amazing! It's gotten rave reviews from everyone who's ever tried it, and I've brought it to a lot of Holiday pot lucks! So much better than marshmallows!

This recipe is amazing.  I always use a 40oz can of Bruce's Yams, I don't even bother baking the sweet potatoes.  I drain the syrup from the can and then otherwise follow the recipe.  This is a QUICK and EASY dish if you use the canned.  The recipe is also foolproof, so if you are not so great in the kitchen, the dish will taste like you can (assuming you don't burn it!)

I'm used to candied yams during the holidays... you know the ones I'm talking about.. canned yams and marshmallows.  It's always been one of my favorite holiday dishes, but this year, I decided to make something a little different for our "Friendsgiving."  Wow.  This dish was amazing!!  I used white sweet potatoes and baked them according to other reviews.  I used three large potatoes.  I also double the topping and added cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice to it.  Again, wow.  This was raved about, even the kids loved it!  I had more than one person claim me as their new best friend, so I'd say this was a definite winner!  Will be making it again for my family Thanksgiving!  :D

This was very good.  I decreased the sugar by half and still plenty sweet.  I will try with no sugar in potatoes next time... just in the topping.  Also made day ahead and refrigerated... baked at 350 for 45 min  right out of fridge.

Nothing to say except -- DELICIOUS.  I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup because I didn't want it quite so sweet.  The dish was licked clean at Thanksgiving.   Even those that thought they didn't like sweet potatoes loved it.

This recipie is awesome! I made it for a school event and a bunch of people  asked for the recipe, then made it for their families for Thanksgiving. A big hit. Now the only problem is everyone will probably want to make it for the same occasion. The only variation I made is to double the topping recipie.

This is the recipe I've been looking for now for years!  I reduced the amount of sugar, as sweet potatoes are sweet enough, but I LOVE the crust on top!

This recipe was super, super good!  I just made it for Christmas dinner, and everyone praised it.  I used four smallish sweet potatoes, baked them whole at 325 a couple of hours till soft, let cool slightly, then turned them out of their peels, chunked them, then mashed with a fork and added other ingredients.  For the topping, I used non-gluten pancake mix instead of flour, since I'm gluten intolerant.  I'm going to experiment with using slightly less sugar - used dark brown sugar.  Truly yummy!

This recipe was a major hit! I ended up increasing the recipe for 18 servings but needed to add a lot more that the additional 2 cups of sweet potato. I probably ended up adding an additional 2-3 extra yams, on top of the 6 cups already included. The consistency worked out.

Add me to the list of people who make something similar.  This is considered my "signature dish" by family and friends who have renamed it Sweet Potato "Crack" Bake!

I agree that baking the potatoes makes the prep much easier - you can even do it the day before.

I recently discovered an add in that makes it even more decadent.  Add 1/4 cup Sailor Jerry rum.  Yummy!

This is delicious - my family was looking for the whipped topping as they said it was good enough to be a dessert!!  I used brown sugar instead of white and evaporated milk instead of regular.  Will definitely be making this again & again!!  Thanks for sharing!!

Got rave reviews from guests at Christmas dinner.  Omitted white sugar completely.  Everyone agreed that they would not have wanted it sweeter.  Used XL eggs....a little too much. Would be fine with large eggs.  Added old fashioned oats to the topping and had walnuts instead of pecans.  Will make again.

Wow, this dish is super sweet and I mean the sugary kind.  It tasted like a dessert; think sweet potato pie; definitely not suitable for a side dish in my household.  Would try it again but cut the sugar back to a couple of tablespoons both in the body and topping.  But I think I will be more likely to prepare it in a crust as a dessert pie.

This is the perfect sweet potato casserole. I only made one change. Instead of cooking the potatoes on the stove, I cooked them in the microwave just like you would a bake potato.  It only took about 10 min and the skin peeled off real easy. Great recipe, thanks!

I'm not a huge fan of sweet potatos/yams but other member of my family are. I made the recipe according to the instructions except I did roast the sweet potatos, opposed to boiling them. I also baked and mashed them in advance and refridgerated them. The next day I brought them to room tempature and carried out the recipe.  My guests raved about them and wanted to know "my secret".

This is a fabulous recipe.  One tip, bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.  Baking them really brings out the sweetness that the boiling tends to wash away.  You won't regret this extra step.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was wonderful. It had cooled off before we got to eat it and it still tasted great-when it is cold and still tastes great you know you have a winner. I have saved this to replace my other casserole recipe. IT IS WONDERFUL!! I did bake my potatoes first rather than boiling and mashing. I think I baked at 425 for 1 hour or until they were soft...then you don't have to really peel or chop the potatoes. I used 4 medium sized potatoes.  I think baking them makes them taste better.

I have been making this exact casserole for the past few years, and there is no way my family will let me get away from making this for Thanksgiving and even Christmas. I always double or triple the recipe to take one for dinner, another for the guests to take some home, and the third one to keep it at my house.  All the ingredients are the same as Tina's, with only one addition I made from the beginning.  I use a 29oz can of cut yams or sweet potatoes, slice them and cover the entire surface of the sweet potato casserole, and then I add the brown sugar/pecan topping.   It comes out amazing, since it gives more texture to the mashed potatoes.  I can eat this hot, warm, or cold and it tastes wonderful.  I see no need of roasting the sweet potatoes, as long as you don't overcook them; they have plenty of flavor as the recipe calls for.  I hope you give it a try.

SCRUMPTIOUS!!  My co-workers LOVED this and people reminded me the next day to send them the recipe.  The topping is what sets this apart.  

I made the potatoe mixture the day before and then put the topping on it and baked it the next day.  Definitely bake the potatoes...I baked 3 large potatoes in foil for about on hour at 400 degrees until they get a little "mushy".  I used just under 1/2 cup condensed milk since I didn't want it to be soupy as others noted.  I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and will likely cut the sugar just a little bit in the potato mixture next time.  I doubled the topping as others noted but then didn't put it all on as I thought it might be too much.  However, I will add a a tiny bit more pecans next time since I think the texture and flavor of the pecans are the magic in this recipe.

Thanks Tina B for a wonderful holiday recipe!

I just made this for dinner tonight, and it was simply delicious....i guess 1,500+ people can't be wrong. I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes, which yielded 3 cups (half of this recipe)....i did make the full serving of topping though, and i am so glad i did. The topping is what makes this dish, i think...the pecans were nice and crunchy. i usually make candied yams for Thanksgiving, but my husband says this dish should definitely replace that. Try it...you won't regret it!!

This recipe is fantastic! I made it last night (day before Thanksgiving) and used a few tips from the reviews. I added evaporated milk, a tsp of cinnamon, used brown sugar instead of white and baked the sweet potatoes since I had the oven on baking pies anyway. I put the mixed potatoes in the casserole dish, mixed up the topping and put it in a baggie to top and bake today. I had to taste this dish so I baked a small casserole, wow is it good! The pecan topping really puts the dish over the edge, the creamy sweet potatoes paired with the crunchy topping is fantastic YUM!

Mashing the sweet potatoes
-Add the butter when mashing the sweet potatoes and make sure you do it while they're hot (I use an electric egg beater)
-cut them before you boil them so they're tender in a uniform way
-Don't use canned sweet potatoes. Let the sweet potatoes cool before you add the egg, otherwise you'll get bits of scrambled egg
 If you want to add marshmallows, put them over the pecan topping

Unbelievable this was amazing. I just made this today and had a few friends over the only thing that I changed due to the fact that I did not have sweet potato  was the sweet potato.   I sub'd  with yams.  And it was amazing.  

Thank you so much.

I used to fix this dish every year! Now there isn't anyone that lives near  to fix it for.I don't like sugary sweet so I only use i/4 cut sugar(less or none if the potatoes are real sweet).I also use can yams or sweet potatoes to save time sometimes.I buy chopped nuts. A neice of mine loves it and that is the only way she would ever eat sweet potatoes.I think I will make myself a mini version this year!

This was very sweet, but delicious, more like a dessert.  We all enjoyed it very much, but I think I will use much less sugar and butter next time.

Unbelievable!  I made this as a last minute side dish for Easter.  I boiled the sweet potatoes, but I agree that baking usually results in tastier potatoes.  I made it the night before, and baked the next day.  I could have eaten the entire pan myself!

My sisters and I ate it as a dessert and as a side dish. I used half the amount of sugar and added 1/4 cup honey instead. Can't wait to make it again during Thanksgiving :)

I thought this recipe did a slight injustice to sweet potatoes; they're so naturally sweet and wholesome, and the recipe detracted from their natural deliciousness rather than added to it.  The recipe went over very well with the majority of my Easter guests, but from several different people I was told that it got sickish sweet after too many bites.  I will definitely use this recipe as a base for any sweet potato casserole in the future.  I will cut the white sugar and the butter in half.  For the topping, I'll use less brown sugar, more nuts, and a more flour based struesel topping.

These were a big hit at Thanksgiving.  Super yummy, sweet without being candy.

I did leave off the topping and just topped with candied walnuts.

Excellent.  Possibly a bit too sweet but not enough to reduce the rating.  I did use brown sugar instead of white. Next time I will try it with a bit of concentrated oranged juice.  Or maybe some cinnamon?  Thanks for submitting this recipe.  It was enjoyed by all.

This was the first time I had ever made sweet potato casserole, and I was very pleased. I followed the recipe exactly as stated. The next day I had another sweet potato casserole with coconut on top, and I really liked it; I think next time I make this I'll add some coconut on top and experiment with some healthier ingredients.

I rated this 5 stars even though I altered it because I'm sure it would rate this fixed as is.  I had 10 small to medium size sweet potatoes and wanted to fix some casseroles to freeze, so here's what I did: baked the sweet potatoes, scooped out insides, added 2 eggs, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 stick melted butter, 1/2 cup evaporated milk, 2 t. vanilla and sprinkling of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.  I doubled the topping that I also added a sprinkling of cinnamon.  The result: YUM!!!!  Thanks Tina for a wonderful basic recipe that I could build on.

Ive been making this for years and my extended family requests it often.  Only thing I do different is to microwave the potatoes, put in plastic bag for 5 min to steam and skins slide right off.  This wont disappoint!

I've made this twice with excellent results both times! It's such a nice change from the candied yams with marshmallows (that we've done my entire life!). I did bake the sweet potatoes at 350 for about 1.5 hours and I used evaporated milk as other reviews suggested. I also doubled the topping both times and it was so good! I didn't have any issues with the top being too buttery or anything.

I cooked this dish as a side on Thanksgiving. The only change I made to it was I put marshmellows on the top 5 minutes before taking it out of the oven and it was excellent. Out of everything I made, this was by far the first to run out.

Only my mom liked it a lot.  The kids didn't at all.  The adults did, but said it was too sweet to have more then a small serving.  I liked it, but wouldn't have more than a few spoonfuls at a time to accompany something else.  I found it very buttery.

Love sweet potatoes!  I follow the directions except I used 1/4 cup of white sugar.  I don't like to measure so I taste as I go along and I used a little less than 1/2 cup of brown sugar as I did not want it too sweet. I did not boil the potatoes instead I baked them like suggested from one of the reviewers. The result delicious!  I suggest you bake the sweet potatoes it gives them a great flavor. I love this recipe and it's a keeper for my next Thanksgiving. Thanks!

I roasted my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them, as others had suggested. I used 3 medium sized sweet potatoes and I baked them for 1 hour 15 minutes. I let them cool for a bit and the skin came off easily. Then I continued as directed. It came out great. Went well with baked ham. :D

I made this with 3 giant sweet potatoes, baked in the oven, and I added about a T of cinnamon to the potato mixture.  Delicious, but WAY too sweet for my liking - it was more of a dessert than a casserole/side dish.  Next time I'll down the white sugar to 1/4 cup, or add another giant sweet potato.

My family loves this recipe and has been on the top of our list for many years.  I bake the sweet potatoes omitting the need to peel the potatoes.  They can bake while I am preparing other dishes and the potatoes can be easily scooped from the skin to prepare the casserole.  

Leave a layer of potatoes in the skin and sprinkle with brown sugar, cinnamon, and  miniature marshmallows. Brown in the oven at 350 and you have a quick recipe of sweet potato skins.  They are eaten before I can get them to the table!!

I've made this dish for years.  It's super fantastic!  The only thing I would recommend is to bake the potatoes (w/ the skin on) instead of boiling them.  That way the water from boiling doesn't dilute the flavor of the potato.

I micro-waved the sweet potatoes and then just split them open and scooped out the insides....super easy. I also doubled the topping and added 1 tsp cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture and increased the vanilla extract to 1 tsp. I used a hand blender to mix everything up. Will never make sweet potato casserole with canned yams again!

This recipe is fantastic. Not only is it easy to make, but it tastes absolutely wonderful. Instead of adding milk, I used cream but other than that, I followed the recipe to the letter.

For Christmas, I brought this recipe, as well as Candied Sweet Potatoes from this site.  With a crowd of 50+, this was gone first & everyone was asking who brought it.  I baked sweet potatoes instead of using canned for the first time & was amazed at how easy it was, I will never use canned again!  Huge difference!  Baked the sw. potatoes @375 for 1 hour, BE SURE TO PUT A PAN UNDER THEM!  They "weeped" sweet juice all over my clean oven, lol  The skin separates & practically falls off, so you don't even have to actually peel them.  I used evaporated milk, added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/2 tsp. nutmeg., mixed with my food processor, & then doubled the topping. AMAZING!!  will make this many more times...thank you!  :o)

This is a must have on our Thanksgiving table. I do bake my potatoes as others have said, it does make a difference. If you really want to impress your company add a tablespoon of frozen orange juice concentrate to your mixture before adding the topping. Don't use regular OJ it makes the mixture too runny. Yummy!!!

This was delicious and then some.  I did modify things a bit - I added some Cassia Cinnamon and a pinch or two of pumpkin pie spice.  Not much as I didn't want the flavor of the spices to take over.  The topping was heavenly.  My potatoes turned out a bit dry and I think next time I'll use yams and increase the creaminess with a bit of milk or cream.  I would definitely make this one again!

I used fresh yams and after cubing them, thought I should double the batch (still easily fits in a 9x13)since I had quite a few people over for Thanksgiving.  I also had to make it ahead of time and chill it but left the topping off until I was ready to bake it. I'm assuming because of this it did not heat up properly at 350 so I craked it up to 425 for 15 minutes..WOW, it turned out great!  The pecan topping (hand plenty plenty since I doubled it) had a nice crunch and the yams were awesome, a huge hit at dinner, they couldn't stop raving about them...nice change from canned yams topped with marshmallows!!

I haven't actually made this recipe, because my Mother made it every Christmas, and every Thanksgiving, since the beginning of time.  And now my wife has picked up the tradition.  If we don't have it we just cancel the Holiday (LOL).  There's one major difference, though, which addresses on reviewers desire for "More Sweet" - that is that we have always topped it with baby marshmallows, which get all toast in baking.  Oh, and my wife likes a touch of cinnamon.

I make a very similar recipe using maple syrup (the good stuff) in place of the white sugar and lemon juice instead of vanilla. Leave out the milk. Leave the flour out of the topping too. This is the very best sweet potato dish I have ever had. All the family loves it at the holidays.

Great casserole and everyone just ranted and raved over it!  Used drained sweetened canned potatoes instead of fresh (made it so much easier!) and then followed everything else to the "T".  The leftovers were even better and the flavors really blended so well together so that is how I will do it the next time - a full 24 hours prior to cooking and serving.  A DEFINITE KEEPER HERE & WILL DEFINITELY MAKE AGAIN!!!!  Thank you for sharing!!!!!

I looked at several sweet potato casserole recipes before settling on this one.  I have made a similar one before but it didn't turn out very good.  So, when I told my husband that I was making a sweet potato casserole, he was less than thrilled.  But when he tasted it, he couldn't stop talking about how good it was or stop eating it.  He added a little cool whip on top for a truly wonderful dessert.  My seven year old daughter liked it, too.  I added an extra 1/4 cup of sugar as I like my casserole sweet.  I followed the advice of another reviewer and added 1 tsp. cinnamon and 1 tsp. nutmeg.  I can't imagine a sweet potato casserole without cinnamon and nutmeg.  I'm going to make this dish for my church's women's fellowship next month.  Overall, this recipe was great and I will be making it again and again.

I make this with canned sweet potatoes and It turns out great. I took the advice of another reviewer: "One large can (40 oz I think) is just over 4 cups (I use the whole can), but the trick is to boil them in the syrup for awhile to get them kinda mushy, then drain and mash them in a bowl…" This is good advice and I get rave reviews on this recipe. I use heavy cream instead of milk and I half the sugar as they can be pretty sweet if using canned. I don't always make the topping and they are still fantastic. This recipe is easy and so, so good :)

I have always used a slightly different recipe when making this casserole. I add a couple of carrots and a turnip, while cutting back sweet potato to one med. I cook them all together and mash them together when cooked. Try it you might like.

I was looking for a recipe for sweet potato casserole that I could pre-make and freeze for Thanksgiving since I was having surgery on my hand the week before Turkey day and then still planning on hosting dinner the day of. This recipe was easy to prepare, froze well and once thawed and reheated was delicious. Note I had prebaked it prior to freezing.

Great! But this is super sweet, it is close to pie.  I took out about half the sugar the first time and next time I make it I am not putting any sugar in the filling.  I am working with homegrown roasted sweet potatoes, so maybe that makes a difference in the inherent sweetness.

Fantastic!  I cut the white sugar by about a third, and found it was plenty sweet.  It tasted more like sweet potatoes than dessert this way.  Really delicious and will be a staple in the house and a regular at potlucks!

YUM YUM YUM!  We loved this recipe.  I've always made candied yams but never sweet potato casserole so this is a nice alternative.  As suggested by other reviewers, I baked the sweet potatoes and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and added vanilla (1 1/2 teaspoons), cinnamon and nutmeg.  Also, I used 5 jumbo sweet potatoes but still only used about a 1/2 cup of sugar for the mixture (actually 1/8 white sugar and 3/8 brown sugar) and cut back by a 1/4 cup on the brown sugar for the topping.  It was the perfect amount of sweet and the vanilla was able to come through in the taste.

Great recipe! I wanted it to taste more like sweet potatoes than pie so cut out all the white sugar, halved the milk, doubled the vanilla extract, added nutmeg and cinnamon and wha-lah! Perfect.

I LOVE this recipe:) Will be making again for 2012 Thanksgiving. The only thing different I do is I changed the vanilla to 1 tsp. and used cream instead of milk. I finely chopped the pecans on top only because of the guests who are older and might wear dentures. (hey, gotta look out for granny:) I've found that instead of measuring each cup of potatoes- I just use 5 large sweet potatoes. it works:)

Best sweet potatoes ever!  I make it a few times a year for family functions & there are never left-overs, I do throw some marshmallows in just because it was tradition when I was a kid.

This is the exact same recipe that they serve at Ruth Chris Steak House.  The only difference is they bake it in those little oval

We did not care for this recipe. It tasted like dessert and no one enjoyed it with our turkey dinner.  It was way too sweet and cake tasting.

Wow this was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. I didn't use the sugar because it would have been way too sweet. I also had to use walnuts because the pecans were sold out. I can't wait to make it again! I also remember using bourbon vanilla extract from Trader Joes. Yummy!

I just learned to like sweet potatoes in the last few years.  My mom asked me to make sweet potatoes for Easter.  I had never made a dish with them and I made this dish.  It was delicious!  I had two people tell me they were the best sweet potatoes they ever ate.  Delicious and easy to make!

Delicious!   I used 5 pounds of yams, and followed the directions  as written for 4 cups of potatoes and  I did bake them instead of boiling.  I also did add 1 tsp cinnamon  and used half and half and cold butter for the topping!  Very creamy and delish! I will make again for Easter!

My God this thing was yummy!! It was the biggest hit of all at our holiday dinners. The only thing I did differently was double the topping because it just wasn't enough to cover the entire casserole dish if you are using a 9x13. plus, everyone always loves the topping!!

So good! Follow the advise on Melissa's review and it will turn out fantastic! Be careful on the sugar though. . . I halved it and (due to some VERY sweet baked sweet potatoes) it still tasted as sugary as a dessert.

This was excellent; a Christmas hit!  It is definitely more of a dessert.  My husband recommended more sweet potato, so I'll add more next time.  I did follow other reviews and doubled the topping and I'm glad I did.  Very good dish!

This was absolutely delicious and everyone loved it.
Even mfy husband who doesn't like sweet potatoes.
I did substitute the canned sweet potatoes for the baked.  (One large can...and followed the remainder
of the recipe as written.)  This dish will become a Christmas tradition.  Thank you.

This was very easy to make and was a big hit for Christmas dinner. As other reviewers suggested, I baked 4 very large yams in the oven the night before and then skinned and mashed them Christmas day. I used a hand mixer to mix in the eggs, milk, butter, etc. and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves. The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that it was a bit sweet for my taste. The sweet potato itself wasn't too sweet, it was the topping that was a bit too much. I would definitely recommend against doubling the topping as I felt it was more than enough to sufficiently cover the entire top of the casserole. Maybe next time I'll cut some of the brown sugar from the topping. I also increased the pecans to 1 cup because I love pecans. Overall very good and I was asked for the recipe, which is always a great sign.

I roast the potatoes in the oven on 350 for an hour. Be sure to poke a few holes in the potatoes prior to baking. Once cooled, I sliced them up. I don't like it creamy. I also aded a shot of brandy to the mixture. I fry about 4 strips of bacon and crumble that up and add to the topping. About 1/2 cup mini marshmellows top the dish. I baked it until the marshmellows were browned.

Great recipe!  The only difference is that I added a few dashes of cinnamon to the topping and put marshmallows on top for the last three minutes in the oven.  Perfect!  I'm used to overly sweet casseroles that leave me wishing I could taste the potatoes.  This was a perfect!  Still obviously sweet, but I can taste the potatoes.  My husband, who loves his family overly sweet version (yuck!), was still very happy with this one!  Will definitely save for our next holiday meal!

I'd agree that this is pretty yummy. The only problem I could see was that it was way too sweet. I think if you cut the sugar in the sweet potato mixture it might come out better. I also think this would be good at times other than holidays, as we hould be eating more sweet potatoes anyway. I used chopped walnuts in my version because that's what I had in the house and it was just fine.

This dish went over big at my house!  As my family has some diabetics, I substituted the white sugar with Splenda--it made for a light, less sweet, very yummy dish.  Will definitely make again!

Hmm I changed it a bit. Example used a little bicarb of soda to keep color nice and yellow when cooking the sweet potato in water and didn't mash it and also sliced the sweet potato as we like it more chunky. I layered the slices when almost tender then used caramel essence instead of vanilla. The rest except for pecans is pretty much how we make it in my family

Fantastic!  I followed the suggestions to bake the sweet potatoes.  Also, I inadvertently used the golden sweet potatoes, not the orange ones.  Tasted delicious regardless!  Will definitely be making this one again.

Loved this recipe.  It was easy and delicious!!  I debut this dish at Thanksgiving.  Cooking is not one of my passion so if the dish is simple to make and impresses everyone it's for me.  By popular demand, this dish will be made again for our Christmas feast!  After reading all the reviews the only change I made was I baked the sweet potato.  I also wasn't sure how many potatoes would make 4 cups.  I used 5 potatoes.  I served 9 people and only had a tiny bit left.

Great recipe, although I did change a bit. I used half brown sugar & half white. I also doubled the vanilla, and halved the eggs and milk and the consistency was still a tad bit thinner than I would have preferred. Maybe my potatoes just took on too much water while cooking?? Not sure, I'll just have to play around with the recipe some more next time. Either way will make many more times to come!

Until now, I haven't found a thanksgiving recipe for sweet potatoes that I actually like.  This recipe was my last shot before giving up hope on sweet potato casseroles forever, and I'm really pleased with the way it turned out!  Like other reviewers suggested, I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them and I added 1 tsp. of cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. of nutmeg.  I used 3 large sweet potatoes.  It was really good and I'm going to add this recipe to my thanksgiving menu for years to come.

My goodness this was delicious. I made it with 3 large sweet potatoes, baked. I reduced the amount of sugar by a third to half, depending on how sweet the potatoes are. Baked sweet potatoes tend to be sweeter than boiled because of the less water content. I also reduced the amount of butter by 1-2 table spoons. For the topping I used only 1/4 cup of sugar, slightly less flour and added some oat meal to the mixture. I melted butter instead of cutting it in by mistake and it still came out GREAT! I absolutely love sweet potatoes and this dish is just wonderful.

I used 1/2 the sugar & butter in the casserole part. Still really sugary. Next time, use 1/2 the sugar in the topping part too. David suggested a jalapeno to help balance out the sweetness. Interesting idea. Really more of a dessert dish than a starch.

Absolutely the best sweet potato dish. Made as is it is fantastic. Try the recipe first before you mess with it. you won't be disappointed. I do agree with the baking the yams first.I am growing my own sweet potatoes this year just for this dish. Personally adding all the extra flavors isn't always better. Simple and delicious just as it is.

delicious! wanted to "healthy" it up, so...added some dry uncooked oatmeal to the topping, which I also cut the sugar in 1/2,  and used agave sweetener in the potatoes,  almond milk subbed for cow's milk, (I have lactose issues), and upped the amount of pecans, other than that, I loved it just the way it is!!!!! lol

This was good, but if you follow the recipe exactly you might want to change the name to "Crustless Sweet Potato Pie" or "Sweet Potato Pecan Pie" - this is really sweet and too sugary. Next time I make it I'm going to leave the sugar out of the sweet potatoes and make the topping 1/2 cup flour, 1/2 cup brown sugar, and 1 cup chopped pecans... I'm really excited to try it that way, I think it'll turn out just right!

I was actually looking for an acorn squash casserole recipe but couldn't find anything that appealed to me. In  a recent recipe request for Thanksgiving side dishes, Tizzyliz recommended this sweet potato casserole so I decided to switch out the the potato for the squash and I'm happy to say that it was a hit at our holiday gathering. Because I wanted this to be a bit more savory than sweet, I left out the white sugar and it was still delicious. Thank you so much Tina!

I loved this recipe! The only thing I would change is to bake the potatoes instead of boiling them, I baked five large potatoes for about an hour and a half and I also added some nutmeg and cinnamon, it turned out delicious, thank you for sharing!

This dish is always a holiday favorite!  I substitute splenda to lower the calories and use less butter in the casserole (not the topping).  It is better to bake the sweet potatoes (usually an hour) wrapped in aluminum foil and then they fall right out of their skins.

So delicious!  I halved the recipe and added a bit less sugar and finally added OJ instead of milk (didn't have any) and it was delicious.  For quick roasting (I used only one huge potato, admittedly if you doubled the recipe it would be just quicker to bake) peel and chop your sweet potatoes and roast for 20 minutes or until tender in your oven.  I could eat this all year round.  So good.

I'm a Southern, sweet tater, lovin' gal from way back.  I've had sweet potatoes just about any and every way you can imagine.  This is hands down my favorite sweet potato recipe ever.  The ONLY change I made was to do 1.5 times on the topping.  Honestly, you just can't beat this one!  Bonus ... it's easy!!  Bon Appetit'

UGH! That's pretty much what it tasted like. I'm sure somewhere along the lines I goofed on something, because it was seriously soupy and very sweet. Not a hit at my place that's for sure. I believe the other reviews, about it being delicious but it just didn't work out for me. I don't think I'll l be trying this again. Better luck to you though.

Made this on a trial run for the side I was labeled to bring this Thanksgiving. I followed the suggestions and baked the Sweet Potatoes and used evaporated milk instead of the regular milk added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. It was awesome!! I will omit the nutmeg and cloves and mix the cinnamon in the topping before the pecans. !!EXCELLENT!! Thank you for sharing this recipe!

This is EXACTLY the recipe my BF's Mom uses EVERY T'giving & Xmas and it's everyone's favorite dish at holidays.  I've made it a few times and it's sooo good, but somehow always tastes better when she does it... How do Moms do that?  Follow the recipe EXACTLY, don't change a thing-  It's PERFECT just like this!

Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe.  My search for delicious sweet potatoes is over.  No more marshmallows for us. I  whipped the potatoes in my stand mixer for about 1 minutes on medium speed.  The end result was light and fluffy potatoes that melted in your mouth.  I  prefer to bake the potatoes in the oven and squeeze them out of the skins.  Also, due to a guest's nut allergy, I left the pecans out and we didn't even miss them.

My mom is the only fan in my family of sweet potatoes, so I decided to make this dish especially for her for thanksgiving.  She LOVED it!!!  And so did everyone else...even me! It is a new favorite and I am now deligated to bring this dish.  What a YUMMY dish! 
I did not add all the sugar called for..(my mom wanted to make sure she tasted  the sweet potatoes not just sugar)AND I baked my sweet potatoes.  PERFECT!

Thank you for this recipe.
I was worried about having to make the sweet potatoes this year for Thanksgiving since my brother, the chef, usually makes a sweet potato dish.
Our large family loved them.  I used 6 cups of fresh baked sweet potatoes instead of 4 and kept the rest of the recipe the same. I also topped with glazed pecans for show.
I have been asked to make them again for Christmas! I just have to double the recipe because there were no leftovers!

delicious!  was even better with the following changes - i added 1 tsp of cinnamon to the sweet potatoes and to the topping.  also, i increased the amount of sweet potatoes from 4 cups to 8 cups.  also, i used canned sweet potatoes instead.  the recipe yields a LOT of topping but i used every bit of it; it was the best part!  others might want to cut it in half.

made this for thanksgiving.  As others had suggested, I cubed and then roasted the sweet potatoes first (at 325 - 350 for about 45 mins to 1 hour).  Then I mashed them with the other ingredients.  I also left the skin on, and added 1 tsp each of cinnamon and nutmeg.  As per the suggestion of others, I halved the white sugar.  Lastly, I used about 4 1/2 to 5 cups of sweet potatoes instead of 4 cups.
Would definitely make again, particularly for holidays!  My mother raved!

I make this and it is incredible.  BUT instead of boiling sweet potatoes, bake or microwave them.  This really helps the natural sugars develop within the potato.

I MADE THIS RECIPE FOR A CHRISTMAS DINNER AT MY GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. IT WAS ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND SHE IS STILL TALKING ABOUT THIS SWEET POTATOE CASSEROLE. I BAKED MY SWEET POTATOES INSTEAD OF BOILING THEM. I THINK THAT IT ADDS A LITTLE SOMETHING EXTRA. I WILL DEFINATELY BE MAKING THIS AGAIN.

Awesome Recipe! A little too sweet for my tastes. I followed others suggestions and cut the regular sugar in half. I also added 2 tsp of Cinnamon. 1/4 tsp of Nutmeg & 1/4 tsp of Ground Clove.

We had our thanksgiving meal catered last year 2013 and the caterer made these sweet potatoes. Of course, I couldn't ask for the recipe. But we couldn't stop eating them. This year 2014 it was back to scratch and we all brought a dish. I found this recipe and it sounded close to what she served. I substituted coconut milk for the milk and added a handful of coconut to the topping. OMG!!! I have to really limit myself; I could eat the whole pan. I also bake it at 350 deg in a slightly smaller baking dish 7" x 11"? Next time though I'm going to increase the amt of topping and use more vanilla--sounded good.

This was a huge hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!  Even the picky little ones loved it!  Other than baking my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them, I made as is and did not change a thing.  Did use dark brown sugar since the recipe didn't specify light or dark. This will most definitely become a holiday staple in our house! Thanks Tina B!

1/4 cup white sugar works well.  I think it need a little more butter in the topping maybe 1 T more?

Found this to be way too sweet even with cutting the sugar in half as suggest in other reviews.. We all thought it tasted like pumpkin pie filling. I'll try it again with 1/4  cup sugar in the topping only and adjust my review if necessary.

Super yummy! I bake my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them, I use only brown sugar, no white, and I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg and a dash of ginger. Oh my goodness!! I cannot wait to make this again!!

I love sweet potato casserole and this is by far my favorite.  I found this similar recipe using a cast iron skillet. I highly recommend using the cast iron.

1 full cup of sugar and 7 tablespoons of butter? Surely there is a healthier approach to this. It looks about as healthy as a piece of pie or birthday cake. Sweet potatoes are naturally wonderful...

I love this recipe! I made some changes, per a number of reviews I read. I used fresh yams and baked them in my potato pocket in the microwave, then cut them in half and scooped out the good stuff,there was no need to mash them any further. I didn't have pecans so left them off; used 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup white sugar in the mix, added 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. allspice and used evaporated milk. I baked it lightly the night before then brought it to Thanksgiving dinner and re-heated it. Amongst all of us, there were 5 people who will not eat yams or sweet potatoes - 4 of them tried it and loved it. We ate most of it and I was happy to take home the little bit leftover...for me. YUM! I will definitely make this again.

Loved this! However I added cinnamon to the sweet potatoes and to the flour/brown sugar/butter/pecan mixture that goes on top. Delicious. My daughter requests this dish all the time now.

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving. Definitely a keeper and easy to do. I made it as the recipe appears. I find it very frustrating when people rate a recipe highly and then list all the things they did to change it. I'll make this one again next Thanksgiving!

I made this last year on Christmas. My husband's sister said it was just as good as their grandmother's sweet potatoe casserole (who's cooking they always rave about). I plan on making it again for Thanksgiving and Christmas! This recipe is awesome!

I made this last year for the first time and it was to DIE for!!!  I was NOT a sweet potato fan and now I won't have a holiday without it!!!   I added a bit of cinnamon and cloves.  I made it the night before and put the topping on right before I put it in the oven.  Thank you so much for a fantastic recipe!!

I used this recipe but made a few changes. I washed,oiled,baked and mashed 3 large sweet potatoes. I exchanged brown sugar for the white sugar. I added 1 teaspoon cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture. Then I completed recipe as normal. Everyone loved it!

Everyone really loved this. After taking the "most helpful Positive Review's" suggestions of doubling the vanilla, adding cinnamon and nutmeg, this dish had a depth of flavor that was delicious. I didn't have clove, so didn't use that. Not sure if it would have made it better or not. I didn't double the topping, the recipe is more than enough. One thing that might help less experienced cooks...I used 4 sweet potatoes and baked them, but it didn't add up to a full 4 cups. I didn't adjust the other quantities to compensate, still turned out great, just wish I would have bought that extra potato.

Absolutlely delicious.  I agree it's a tad sweet so next time I'll use 1/4 cup brown sugar instead of the 1/2 cup white sugar.  This a little longer than normal to prepare but it is definitely worth it.

Our family has used this recipe for years.  We have it every Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner.  It's so sweet and delicious, it's more like a dessert than a side dish.  Very popular recipe here in the south.

I make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas. I like the idea of baking the potatoes rather than peeling and boiling them, so I'll try that. My kids are grown and out of the house but still request this dish every holiday. My daughter makes it now for her family. Since the kids were little, they demanded this dish saying it was like eating dessert! If you haven't tried it, you are going to LOVE it!

Too sweet for me and my family.  I bake some sweet potatoes,peel and mash them when cooled, add a few TBSP of brown sugar, and a drained small can of mandarin oranges and some cinnamon.  Use mixer to combine, bake in medium oven to desired temperature.  Yummy!

Made as directed the first time and it was delicious, just a little sweeter and runnier than I'd like.  Second time cut back the sugar by 1/4 cup and took 1 egg out and it was perfect!

I love sweet potatoes and I had this with crushed vanilla wafers in it. It was the best I have ever eaten. Can be eaten hot or cold and this recipe can also be made with butternut squash in place of sweet potatoes. Very good

YUMMY is right! Holy , this recipe is great! I get requests to bring this casserole for every holiday meal. The only difference is, I only add a small splash of milk.

I have been making this dish for a few years now and everytime there are no leftovers!  If I take to a potluck - I always bring copies of the recipe because it is the first thing to go and everyone wants the recipe.  Enjoy!

my husband doesn't like his sweet potatos tasting like a dessert. So I was on a mission to find something that didn't involve marshmellows and too much sugar. I made this for thanksgiving and it got rave reviews from everyone. I cut the brown sugar down by 1/2 and used splenda instead of regular sugar and it tasted faboulous. None of our guests could tell a difference. I have been told we need it for xmas as well.

I wanted to try something different this year because I was tired of the same ole candied sweet potatoes with MARSHMALLOWS (yuck!), so I saw this recipe and decided to try it out. I made this AS IS (I didn't have time to do anything more adventurous being I had minimal time) and it came out wonderfully delicious! The reason I had to boil my potatoes rather then roast is because the Turkey was consuming my oven at the time. So... even though it has been recommended to roast (which I agree), it still comes out great even if you boil them! Great recipe, thanks for sharing! :D

TO MAKE IT GLUTEN-FREE:  Just add 1/2 cup of any GF flour mixture (I use either just brown rice flour or Pamela's baking mix).  And I would definitely double the topping, but I LOVE crunchy sweet.

I made this for thanksgiving & it was excellent. Everyone loved it including my 1,4 & 8 year olds. Nothing left. Even My husband who normally doesn't eat sweet potatoes because he feels they are only for dessert liked it. The topping really sets this recipe apart. Going 2 try some coconut in the topping next time just 2 c.

I made this for a christmas party potluck. I roasted the yams instead of sweet potato and added cinnamon and nutmeg and used canned milk and a few more pecans but it was delicious and a hit. i will definitely make it again

I wanted something different other than the usual candied yams for Thanksgiving this year & found this recipe.  My husband who NEVER eats the candied yams devoured these and refused to share!  LOL!! =)
I used 2 large cans of yams which I mashed with a potato masher in a large bowl then added everything else.  I used brown sugar instead of white (personal preference) and the amount of crumb topping was perfect for a 9x13 pan, baked as directed then added a layer of miniature marshmallows & returned to the oven to brown.  This will definitely be made every holiday for my family.  Delicioso!!!

I have been making a casserole like this for several years now. One thing...use WHITE SWEET POTATO....these are NOT Yams....Yams are yellow! White Sweet Potato has a subtle, sweet taste. To be honest I detest yams!  However this recipe is a total keeper your family will love it...but remember ask at the store...white sweet potatoes!

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about this!  It turned out much better than I ever thought sweet potato casserole could.  My husband has already asked for this again!  It was super easy to make and tasted delicious.  I did bake the sweet potatoes as others suggested rather than boiling them.  This is so much better than any other sweet potato casserole!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was enjoyed by many. I received compliments from my Mother-in-law who is an accomplished cook, as well as my sister-in-law who said she could , "eat this every day!" 
The topping was delicious but I felt it wasn't enough. So the next time I make this, I will double the quantity for the topping. Thank you for sharing this recipe with all of us.

We enjoyed this! I live in Africa so our sweet potatoes are not the same. They are dryer and white. So I needed a little more milk. Very good!

I made this for Thanksgiving and yes it is good but much too  sweet.  When I try it again I am going to cut the topping in half.  Then I think it might be a 5 star.

This is much like what I make.  The only things I do differently are: add a small can of drained crushed pineapple, use brown sugar only, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1 teaspoon of vanilla.

Every Thanksgiving I try to find a good sweet potato recipe and now I have finally found it.  The only thing I would do different is cut down on the white sugar because it is a little sweet. I also baked the potatoes instead of boiling. thanks for a great recipe!

I have made this casserole for many years.  My son wants it for every Thanksgiving and Christmas.  I use evaporated milk in the sweet potato mixture.  I also omit the flour in the topping and add about 1/3 cup of shredded coconut to the topping.  A winner every time.

I make this recipe every holiday and everyone loves it, omitting traditional spices and using vanilla and white sugar makes it more mild and pudding like. I use chopped cashews instead of the pecans.  We eat leftovers cold for dessert and breakfast- this is absolutely one of my all time favorites- double the batch!

My family loves this also.  We really like the topping so I made it in a longer, narrow dish to allow more topping.  Very good.

I make this every Thanksgiving! I have had this recipe for 16 years and have baked a double batch of every year! My husband does not like sweet potatoes but insists this has to be made every year. I like this recipe because the sugar is reduced a bit and truthfully my recipe is too sweet and i have reduced it to what this recipe says , I also use evaporated milk instead of milk but i might try the milk version next time!i sometimes put this recipe in a pie shell and call it sweet potato pie! thanks for sharing!

Oh wow! I've been looking for the past 3 years for a great recipe and I'm sticking with this! I'm not a pumkin fan at all but this sweet potato dish...yum yum! I made it without the nuts since a friend that was coming to thanksgiving was alergic to them and it was okay. The next day I added the nuts on top....oh wow, I ate it at every meal, the nuts really make it if you are big on texture. I like to have a little bit of crunch so it was perfect. Thank you for sharing!

I made this for this past Thanksgiving and everyone in attendance said it was the best SP Casserole they'd ever had.  I've never liked SP Casserole in the past, but I thought that this recipe was amazing.  I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the yams for an hour and 15 instead of boiling them - they were right, the yam just falls out of its shell and is super easy to work with.  I'll never use anything but this recipe to make SP casserole, and I'm so happy to have found a dish that can be a holiday staple.

My family has been having this for years with one difference...we use brown sugar in the potatoes rather than white and we call it sweet potato souffle.  Even those that don't care for sweet potatoes love this.

I should have followed the recipe the way it was instead of listening to reviewers as I did not like baking the sweet potatoes in the oven. I will try to make this again but will boil sweet potatoes next time. I also added cinnamon and nutmeg. I put on marshmallows instead of pecans since my family likes it that way

I doubled the topping as some had suggested.  This is wonderful!  This was my first time making anything with sweet potatoes.  Next time I may try baking them and mashing as some had suggested.

Made this for a get-together with friends and it was delicious! Super easy to make. I did add (by accident) a cup of brown sugar in addition to the white sugar when I was mixing it together, but the extra sweetness was soooo good. This is the best sweet potato casserole I've ever made.

The only 2 things I see missing in this recipe is baking the sweet potatoes (which are actually yams) and adding 1/8 to 1/4 tspoon of nutmeg to the mixture - according to your taste.  Test and adjust before baking.  My grandmother made it with Nutmeg and so did my mom and it's how I make it, too.   See how you like it.

don't forget the marshmallows! overall I really loved this recipe. It is a great base, but I have problems following recipes! :-) also if your potato mixture is a little thin due to whatever reason, adding up to 1/3 cp of flour will help without any major changes in texture or taste. I add 1/2 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp allspice and 1tsp of vanilla. I add marshmallows the last 10 minutes of baking then if they haven't browned I broil for just a minute.

we really enjoyed this. found it too sweet as written, so the second time I subbed brown sugar for white, and lessened the amount to 1/4 cup. Strictly personal preference. Easy to make and a nice change from the usual sweet potato side dishes. Thanks for sharing!

absolutely delicious. I made for thanksgiving and it was so so good!!! everyone loved it, it was gone in minutes. I have made it many times since then and don't over cook because the potatoes get too dry. Also bake the potato if you boil it then your potatoes are all watery and have half the flavor of baking.

This was a winner for my family this Christmas! I omitted the white sugar and it was a delicious, not too sweet dish. I added a 1/2 C. mini marshmallows atop the pecan topping. This is a keeper. Thank you for sharing this wonderful casserole, Tina!

My sister-in-law made this recipe for Thanksgiving, and I asked her where she got it.  Since I introduced her to allrecipes I was happy she found it here - and surprised, since she is an amazing cook and I always think she comes up with her delicious food on her own.  We loved this so much that I made it for Christmas last week.

I've never in my life eaten sweet potato casserole.  It always looks and smells weird to me.  This recipe, though, was great.  It was easy, and it looked fantastic.  So much so that I actually ATE some and really enjoyed it.

I have made this recipe since Thanksgiving 1976 when a co-worker gave it to me.  The only addition on my 1976 recipe was coconut in the topping and a bit more butter, also my recipe calls for melted butter which I microwave.  Have made this every year since 1976, family keeps asking for it both Thanksgiving and Christmas annually.

This is a great, easy to follow recipe! To reduce time, I used a 40 oz can of sweet potatoes, drained the juice, and mashed them. I followed the rest of the steps per recipe. The sweet potatoes came out absolutely delicious!

For the past few years I normally make another sweet potato recipe from this site called (sweet potato casserole II), but thought I would try something new this holiday. However, I did not care for this. I thought for the amount of butter, sugar, and eggs, the casserole seemed to have NO FLAVOR! I also thought the toppping would have a more crumbly sweet flavor, but it mostly just tasted of over baked pecans. The recipe I normally use happens to be healthier and also has a great sweet potato flavor. It looked dry coming out of the oven. And, very little of the casserole got eaten.

I've used this recipe for my Thanksgiving dinner for the past three  years now. I use evaporated milk, cut the sugar to just over 1/4 cup, add a dash of cinnamon, and double the topping. I also used about 6 cups of sweet potatoes, which I baked instead of boiled (no peeling necessary...the skin comes right off after baking in a 375 degree oven for about an hour and 15 minutes). I prepared this the day before Thanksgiving and then just popped it in the oven and baked. So yummy!

I tried to make this and it was a little too sweet for my taste, so when I made it the second time I cut the sugar in half and it was simply superb. Nice and creamy with a crispy, wonderful streusel on top. At one point my friend stopped bothering scooping the yams on her plate and just started eating straight out of the dish.

There isn't anything new I can add. This is the only sweet potato casserole my family likes. I baked the potatoes to prepare, added a bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and cut the sugar a bit because the mixture tasted sweet enough. Doubled the topping, maybe cutting the butter a little bit. Yummy is the perfect word to describe this dish!

Tastes like sweet potato pie. It will make anyone like a sweet potato dish at holidays. I baked my potatoes first rather than boil, otherwise followed the recipe.

Good southern dish - we eat sweet potatoes a couple of times a week. Baked is best but a fast way to get that "baked" consistency is to cook washed/pierced sweet potato (large one(s)) in a shallow dish with a bit of water for 7-8 minutes - transfer to toaster over and bake for 15+ minutes on 400 - toughens the skin and makes it easier to remove the meat and you get the baked flavor for 1/3 of the time.

Made this for Thanksgiving - just now reviewing it. AMAZING! I used raw turbinado sugar instead of white, margarine instead of butter, canned yams and ener-g egg replacer instead of eggs. Made extra topping for it. This was my first time making the sweet potato casserole and everybody loved it.

I haven't even baked it yet and I know its gonna be awesome!  I made enough to serve 18 people for Easter dinner tomorrow, and although it called for three eggs, I only had two. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and some all spice.  I used yams instead of sweet potatoes as well!

Followed one suggestion and lined the bottom of a baking dish with cooked sliced sweet potatoes adding nothing to them and then put the topping on top. I also added marshmellows and baked for 20 minutes.

This is my favorite recipe on here! I make a few changes though when I make this: I have diabetics in my family, so instead of 1/2 c. white sugar I use 1/4 c. Splenda sugar substitute. Instead of milk, I use evaporated milk (less sugars!) and instead of vanilla extract, I use Pure Mexican Vanilla. Sometimes, if I'm out of sweet potatoes, I'll use canned sweet potatoes (drained and blotted with a paper towel) or butternut squash (if you cut it in half, seed it, and bake it on a cookie sheet for about 1 1/2 hours, you can then blend/food process/beat it to the right consistency, VERY good!!) I always double the topping, but substitute Splenda brown sugar substitute for the brown sugar, and cut the amount of brown sugar in half. I've made this with wheat flour before too, very good!! Such a versatile recipe!!!

I followed the recipe completely and absolutely LOVED this dish! It tasted wonderful. I see no need to edit or improve it because it tasted fine by itself. Of course I think putting it in a smaller dish than a 9X13 (like a round 9 inch) would have been a better choice.

Made is for Thanksgiving & even my "non sweet potato liking" husband had several helpings! I baked 3 large sweet potatoes in the oven and just scooped out the "meat" when finished. I only added 1/4C of sugar (between the potatoes, the sugar and the topping, it was plenty sweet for my family) I doubled the vanilla and added 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of cloves. This was a wonderful side dish and not too sweet and dessert like - which was what I was looking for!

I'll save you the time. 1) Make this recipe 2) Bake the sweet potatoes, don't boil and don't use canned 3) Make this recipe.  It's unbelievably good. Seriously.  It's almost like dessert.  I halved the sugar because after I baked the potatoes and tasted them, they were already sweet.  Phenomenal recipe!

Just did a dry run for Thanksgiving as we are having alot of guests and I didn't want to make it for the first time and have it turn out terrible.  No worries.  It was awesome.  I made it according to the recipe.  The only change I made was that I baked the sweet potatoes at 350 for 50 minutes instead of boiling.  It almost tasted like a dessert instead of a side dish.

This dish was fine. It got the idea of sweet potato casserole across without resorting to tacky marshmellows. However, it certainly wasn't a complex or gourmet dish by any means. To elevate it, add different flavors, a contrast with crumbled bacon and paprika maybe. The crust on top was phenomenal, though, and I would suggest doubling the topping just to add more of it. I baked mine in a souffle dish and it looked nice on the table, but this is not going to be my go-to sweet potato casserole.

This is an amazing recipe.  I too like to bake my sweet potatoes to soften instead of boiling.  You get more flavor.  I added a little extra brown sugar and butter on top..... Yummy is right!!!  My sister's family can't wait for me to bring it... it definitely beats out the homemade string bean casserole and corn bread stuffing sides!  Thanks for the recipe.

I have long made a similar casserole.  I always made lots extra to turn into sweet potato muffins the next day (similar to pumpkin muffins).  This was always the part of Thanksgiving eating that my kids looked forward to most!

I love this and have been making for a while now, I top half with pecans and half without as my kids aren't too fond of nuts.  This is name Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole for a reason!!  ENJOY!!  I put mini marshmallows on half for easter this year and that side got eaten first!!

The best sweet potato casserole EVER! I just recently made this for Thanksgiving and my boyfriend absolutely loved it I made it exactly as the recipe says except I microwaved the sweet potatoes and added marshmellows on top. He comes home from Saudi Arabia in February and he is already talking about me making this for him when he gets home.

I made this for Thanksgiving 07--even baked it longer than suggested and the inside was still a little runny.  Does anyone know what I did wrong?  It was very yummy and I'm going to try it again this year.  But I will bake the potatoes this time instead of boiling.  Maybe that will make the difference?

Very good.  I omitted the white sugar in the sweet potato base.  I also added 1/2 cups of rolled oats to the topping w/ an additional 1T of butter.  Turned out yummy.

I not only make this for thanksgiving but we love it so much I've made it on other occasions. I didn't change a think, except cut the recipe in half at times.

I haven't found anyone who didn't love this recipe. It is very sweet, but very good.

This recipe was wonderful... my husband requested sweet potatoes for dinner one night and I came to this website to make something different and I stumble across this recipe. My husband was like wow this is excellent.. i stuck to the recipe but added some nutmeg and cinnamon. I will be making this recipe again and again.

This is the best sweet potatoe casserole I've ever had. I get tired of the same old dish. My husband who isn't crazy about sweet potatoes ate this until he burst. This will be on my Thanksgiving table for years to come. Thanks for this great recipe.

Oh wow.  And I hate sweet potatoes!  I have been making this for almost 5 years now.  A great casserole, little close to dessert-ish but still okay for dinner.  I really liked how it turns out like custard.  The pecan topping sells me on this every time, it is best when doubled.  I prefer to make it with the canned sweet potatoes (because I am lazy like that!) then I cut it down to 1/4 c sugar.  You can cook this in a microwave and slip it in the oven to crisp the top and no one is the wiser.  I originally wrote in my first review, "My 6 y.o. would likely run away if she found someplace that served this nightly (as would my husband too, LOL)!"  This is still true!

I made this for Christmas Eve and it was very good.  My recommendation is to cut down on the sugar if you don't want it too "desserty".  Sweet potatoes are so sweet on their own they really don't need to much added sugar.  I only used 1/4 cup in the potato mixture and it was plenty.  I took the advice of another reviewer to baked the potatoes instead of boiling them. Once baked, you can just pull the skin right off.  I added 1 tsp. vanilla, 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. nutmeg and cloves.  Evap milk works great.  Easy and really good.  Thanks!

I baked the potatoes and used brown sugar Splenda for the diabetics in the family. I prepared it the night before then baked it one half hour before serving. It worked for me and my family. For once,I was sorry there weren't any leftovers.

Delicious.  I've made this the last 2 thanksgivings and it was a hit each time. I used pumpkin pie spice in the recipe and for a short cut I used canned yams, drained and rinsed.

Made this Thanksgiving '07 and it was a hit. Definitely bake the sweet potatoes, it makes the flavor perfect!
Also, next time I make I will double the sweet potatoes and keep the topping the same.

Everybody loved this dish! I did also change a few things... I baked the sweet potatos for 1 1/2 hours and instead of 1 cup white sugar I used 1/4 cup white sugar 1/4 cup brown sugar. It was great!

We brought this to our parent's house for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a blast.  Everyone loved it.  We didn't modify it except to substitute some cream for milk (because we had it already).

We also loved Cranberry Sweet Potato Bake.

Yummy it is! I added a bit of cinnamon because I couldn't imagine eating sweet potatoes w/o it. I topped it w/half marshmellows and 1/2 of the topping from the recipe...the topping from the recipe was first to go, next time no marshmellows!

After reading the reviews I was prepared for a very sweet dish.  I followed the recipe exactly, and found these sweet potatoes to be delicious!  I'm not a big yam/sweet potato fan, so I was pleasantly surprised to find myself (and my kids) getting seconds on these.

I have been making very similar dish for many years and it is always favorite! I recommend to add thought 1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon to the topping mixture!

This one is a total winner--memorable, delicious, and fail-proof! It's quite sweet, almost like a dessert. Also, I use yams, since they're a little sweeter. It does serve 12 (a small portion for each), but don't expect leftovers!

I decided to have Thanksgiving in July and made Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole (along with Marinated Turkey Breast and Amber’s Super Stuffing both from this site).  This was good but it was a little sweet for me.  The next time I make this I am going to cut the sugar in half that I add with the sweet potatoes and also cut the sugar/pecan topping in half.  Thanks for a good recipe!

You were right, this will be a new tradition for our family.
It was superb dispite my attempt at trying to lazily BLEND the potatoes. It ended up looking pureed but the crusty topping saved it and it was so great, it was gone in record time. Presentation was A+, it looked like something out of Bon Appetit magazine. Wonderful dish to say the least. Thanks for submitting it.

This was great! I used a 29oz can and a 15oz can (which came out to about 5 cups) of the sweet potato instead of the real stuff and kept everything else the same. It was great. Next time I might add less pecans or just take them out. I will be making this again. It added the sweetness to what every meal needs.

This is a standard recipe for sweet potato casserole, but there's a reason so many people use it--it works!  The game changer, in my opinion, is switching out the milk for half-and-half.  I also add marshmallows to the top with about 10 minutes of cooking left.

Yes, I changed it to a vegan, gluten free casserole by substituting the sugar with Organic Coconut Palm sugar.
I used earth balance for the butter and almond milk in place of the milk and used silken tofu in place for eggs.
For the topping I replaced the flour with oatmeal I pulsed in a food processor and almond flour.

I brought the casserole to a church dinner and there wasn't  a drop left. Everyone loved it and many people asked for the recipe.

This has everything you need for a great holiday dish:  it's delicious, it's easy to make, and it can be assembled the day before and baked just before serving. (I removed it from the fridge one hour before baking to bring it to room temperature.) After years of trying different sweet potato recipes for our large Thanksgiving gathering, I came across this last year and my guests ate every bite. This year I doubled the recipe and there were multiple people returning for seconds and requests to take leftovers home.  I followed the recipe exactly, with the exception of baking the whole sweet potatoes and scooping out the center instead of boiling. I also baked it 10-12 min. longer than the recipes calls for as it was a double batch and was sharing the oven with oyster dressing.  Perfection!

Wonderful! My nephew suggested that this should be sold at dessert shops -- he would be a regular buyer! I made it exactly as recipe except cut down a wee bit on the sugar added direct to the sweet potatoes. thanks to Tina B for submitting this!

I had pretty big sweet potatoes, so I ended up cooking them for over an hour and a half in the oven, but I am not sorry! I don't even like sweet potatoes and I couldn't wait for this to be done! The topping cannot be beat!

I can't believe I haven't rated this recipe yet as I've made it several times and absolutely love it.  It is perfect! Everyone who has tried it has loved it.  And my family knows what good food because they all love to cook and Eat. Im making my bf his own mini casserole as we speak. He adores the stuff too. Wish I could help him eat it but I'm on a diet. :(

Absolutely wonderful, my family now wants this once in awhile through out the year instead of just on Thanksgiving & Christmas. This was almost to good to be a side dish, it was like eating dessert. I stayed true to the original recipe but see where a person could add fun things & ingredients to ones personal liking ... thanks a must try dish for everyone ... Vinnie

I have been using this recipe for over 2 years now. I absolutely love it! My hubby & I are not into nuts, so we leave them out. I reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup- you won't miss it. I do this because I double the topping with brown sugar & flour- because you just have to!  I sometimes use heavy cream if I'm out of milk- super delicious, but a little bit more fattening. I use a pastry cutter to get my topping perfect.  I've never tried baking the sweet potatoes before hand, but I will next time around.

Let me start by saying I think I am a terrible cook.  I attempted this recipe for Thanksgiving because I felt bad making the same things every year.  I put it out and could not believe the raves and compliments that I was finally getting on my cooking, namely this dish.  

I intend to make it every holiday now.

I melted butter and mixed into the flour, pecans and brown sugar before covering the top of the potatoes.  It made the top of the casserole look more appealing.  I took this to my church' Thanksgiving dinner and the pan was scrapped clean!

This was great, also easy but did what others stated and baked the sweet potatoes for an hour at 375 and left in oven for another 30 minutes after we shut it off. They scooped out easy and filled a 4 cup measuring glass with the mashed sweet potatoes. Cut sugar to 1/4 cup and used raw sugar instead of white. Also added the 1/4 TSP of ground nutmeg, ground cloves and the teaspoon of ground cinnamon as others suggested.

This last Thanksgiving was my first with my in laws.  My mother in law asked for me to bring a sweet potato casserole.  I was super nervous as if never made a casserole of any sort.  

Though needless to say this recipe was very easy.  its also a budget friendly recipe as most of the ingredients I already had! Which is a win for me!  Anyhow the mother in law loved it and so did the kids.  It's Christmas and she asked me to bring it again! Which is a huge compliment :). I'm making it right now! Yay.

This was really good! I was skeptical because I dont typically like sweet potato casserole, but I had to make one for a party. This was perfect! Note - I only used 1/3 c of sugar in the potato mix instead of the 1/2 c -- just my preference, I dont like super sweet things. I also added crumbled cooked bacon to the topping. It was a hit!

My in-laws won't let me come unless I bring this to family dinners. 
I found that a 9x9 worked better for me and I make a little thicker topping. 
Thanks for the recipe!

Really good! I've made this a few times for Thanksgiving and everybody loves it. It works well with both fresh sweet potatoes and canned sweet potatoes if you don't have as much time! It is rather sweet though, which is something to keep in mind if you plan on making a lot of desserts with it too (like at Thanksgiving or Christmas or something).

It's delicious. Only thing is I would probably never make it as a side dish again. It tastes like dessert! I even halved the sugar in the potatoes! If I make it a side dish again, I would completely eliminate the sugar in the potato mixture, and then reduce the sugar in the crumb topping. I followed other reviewers and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. And like I said it was delicious, just really sweet and desserty. I should admit I've never had sweet potato casserole before and didn't know what to expect.

Excellent. I took reviewers advice and baked potatoes.  They released lots of natural sugars this way and was easier than peeling and boiling.

This is delicious and easy to make. I ended up baking peeled yams in foil and dumping that in the mixer bowl. Couldn't be simpler and everyone loved it. UPDATE: I learned a new trick: place unpeeled sweet potatoes in the crock pot on low for 7 hours, no mess, no heating up the oven and they are perfectly cooked to dump in the mixer!

I love this recipe and it is now a staple for our family's Thanksgiving spread. I make one alteration to this recipe. I pull out the casserole after about 10 minutes and add about 3/4 a bag of Mini-marshmallows over the top of the sugar and pecan mixture then bake the whole thing for another 30 minutes. I'm still playing with the cooking timing because the toasted marshmallows are really good if they do not over-cook. I feel the extra time is needed because the casserole doesn't quite seem done to me after only 30 minutes.  So by cooking for 10 minutes first, then adding in the minis, just about the time they start to brown the casserole is just about done. My family also moves this to the dessert menu as opposed to a yam side dish - and we're okay with that! I've also made with regular marshmallows. I think it's just easier to manage the cooking time with the minis.

My family RAVED about this recipe!  Normally, there are sweet potatoes left over, but not this time!  It was such a crowd pleaser that two relatives asked to take home what little was left!  I'll definitely make it again!

This was the best sweet potato casserole I've ever had. Such a great recipe alternative if you don't like the marshmallow topping. The only change I might make is to double the pecan topping. I felt like I didnt have enough for the top.

I made this for the first time for Thanksgiving. It was the only dish that was completely devoured. So no leftovers =/ it was super easy to make and a favorite at our dinner table. I will definitely be using this again. I did add more sweet potatoes and more pecans.

This is a keeper!  I made it the same way as another cook mentioned with evaporated milk, DELISH! My mother in law wants the recipe!  So easy to make.  I did bake the potatoes first and followed the recipe except adding the evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I will save this to my Recipe Box for next year. 5 stars!

Awesome!  Most of our family are not big sweet potato eaters, but I decided to give this a try last year for the holidays.  My nephew requested I bring it again this year.  I made the recipe exactly as listed.  The only thing I will do differently is make one and half or double the recipe to fill the dish better.  Enjoy!

Delicious,  searched sweet potato casseroles  this was the first one on the list and didn't go to any others. It was easy to prepare,  and didn't 
take long at all to put together. Tasted good enough to be a desert. !!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit! I cut the sweet potatoes in 1/2 and roasted them on 375 for 1-1.5 hours (instead of boiling).  I cut white sugar in half and added cinnamon and allspice.  I also doubled the topping.   It turned out great!

This is a winner! I have been making sweet potato casserole every holiday for the last 15 years. I have tried many different recipes for it and I must say that this one has to be my favorite. I prefer the fresh sweet potatoes to the canned, which I baked and then mashed. It's not crazy sweet like some of the other recipes are and the consistency was perfect, not too wet. Think I am gonna stick with this one. I doubled the recipe for thanksgiving and was the favorite of the night!

This is soooo good.  Almost a dessert.  I've made many times.  I usually double the recipe using 8 large sweet potatoes.  When I double the recipe,I triple the topping because it is so good. I also use half milk and half condensed milk to get it extra creamy. Love it.  Also ... this can be made the day before and stored in the frig.  Take it out of the fridge about 1/2 hour before ready to pop in the oven and it will come out perfect.  If your topping is spreading... you are letting the butter get too soft.  It should be a little cold still when you are combined with other topping ingredients.

Living in the South creates a desire to have Pulled Pork every few weeks. This recipe is now a family favorite. Sunday lunch was a great success thanks to this recipe. I followed the directions and it came out perfect. Did slow cooking Saturday, refrigerated over-night then used the slow cooker to heat it up for Sunday lunch.

This turned out beautifully! All ingredients were portioned perfectly however, instead of pecans I used marshmallows....but this was a hit and my entire family has been asking me for months if i will be making this sweet potato recipe again! I most certainly will.  Everything was great...great sweetness, perfectly paired with turkey and stuffing - we loved it! New family tradition - would not change a thing!

I have and it is delicious. But to make it even better, I bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. It carmelizes the natural sugar in them.

This recipe is a favorite in our house. I roast cubed sweet potatoes the day before to cut down on the prep time. I toss them into the blender the following day with the rest of the ingredients and whip it all up. Yesterday, I realized I was out of butter--so I used melted coconut oil instead, and added a handful of shredded coconut to the topping and it took this dish to a whole new level of amazing.

Everyone loved it!!! Decreased sugar to 1/4 cup, used Splenda brown sugar instead of white sugar, increased vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves.. On the topping used Splenda brown sugar.  Also, used a casserole dish instead of a 9x13 pan. PERFECT!!!

I followed the recipe exactly (the only thing is I added a dash of cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture) and every single of my 12 guests raved about it. This dish is not known/common here where I live (Spain) but it already has been requested for me to bring it to Xmas dinner next week and I feel it's going to become a staple for Holidays to come. Thanks for the recipe

We have used this for the last 2 years, it's a fave now!  I bake my sweet potatoes, I think it's a richer flavor and keeps more vitamins.  I also felt that they came out too thin in the 9x13 pan, so I used one of my Corning casserole dishes.  Addicting!

This recipe is great.  Only thing I changed was based on previous comments.  I baked the sweet potatoes the night before.  This saved a lot of time on Thanksgiving morning.  No need to peel or boil.  Loved this recipe all around.  THe family couldn't get enough.  The topping is incredible.

I adjusted this recipe for double servings for my Thanksgiving party and everyone LOVED it!  Got raving reviews and I would highly recommend it.  I used all brown sugar inplace of the white it calls for and that made it not too sweet.  The double servings called for extra 30 minutes of total prep/cook time but it was well worth it.  FYI 1 large sweet potato in the store is about 2 cups.

Absolutely delicious!!!! I read a lot of reviewers suggestions, and I decided not to add the white sugar to the sweet potatoes since they are so sweet naturally. I didn't want it to be too much like a dessert. I baked 3 large sweet potatoes in the oven for 2 hours, as other reviewers suggested, and they were very flavorful. I followed the recipe to the tee, and I thought it was great. I could have handled doubling the topping, but it didn't need it. The topping had a great caramelization, it was delicious!! I made mine the day before, and just added the topping before I baked it to save time in the kitchen on thanksgiving. This recipe is a keeper!! Next time I will probably sprinkle a little cinnamon and nutmeg on the top too.

I love this recipe but this year had to adjust it for a relative that had surgery and is limited on sugar and fats. 
Did a trial run for Thanksgiving last week and I substituted 1/3 fat cream cheese for the butter  (which made them even more fluffy and wonderful) and Truvia for the sugar. (see the package Of Truvia for the sugar substitute measurements) It tasted exactly the same but with far less calories and a bit more fluffy from the cream  cheese. I got more compliments this year and I only told the concerned party so they could eat their favorite dish!
Yum!!

Being from Texas we grew up on this! Using real butter and brown sugar give it a very rich yummy taste. Fattening but absolutely worth every bite! Especially if you only make it on Holidays. No fail recipe

My daughter accidently added maple extract to this recipe and it was delicious. I use 1 tablespoon of real maple syrup when I make it. If you like maple flavoring, you'll love this addition.

This is a staple for holidays.  And there are never left-overs.  I usually make more of the topping and add oatmeal to mine.  Amazing!

Fantastic recipe.  I added a couple chipotles in adobo sauce, chopped up and blended in.  It helps balance the rich, sweet flavors in the casserole.  The heat is pretty tolerable, but make sure the people you're serving it to like a little spice.

I made the mistake of halving this recipe to feed my family of four (two of us are only three-years old).  There aren't any leftovers, so sad.  We roasted the sweet potatoes instead of steaming them in the oven.  I also added 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice and 2 tsp vanilla to the mixture.  So delicious!

This was wonderful, thank you for sharing, Tina. We made this today for Easter, and it was a big hit. I followed recommendations and baked the potatoes in the oven yesterday and scooped out the middles after they cooled. I used only a 1/4c brown sugar in the potatoes, and whole wheat flour in the topping, which was very tasty with the pecans. Everyone loved these potatoes, they are much tastier than the marshmallow-style casseroles that used to be on every holiday table. We'll be using this recipe from now on.

Oh my goodness, I will never buy sweet potatoes in a can ever again! I did add cherries and a marshmallow topping because the family demanded it, but honestly I think it was better as it was. I think next time though I would leave more chunks of sweet potatoes. I wasn't a fan of the super smooth texture.

In general I like sweet potato casserole, but this was not my favorite recipe. Mostly because in a 9x13 it turned out really shallow. Maybe I will add more sweet potatoes next time or do it in a square pan. The topping also didn't seem to melt properly so next time I'll try melting the butter first instead of cutting it in.

I don't really like giving anything 5 stars since there is always room for improvement, but this sweet potato casserole was amazing! It isn't too sweet, though I did serve it for dessert on Thanksgiving. It is wonderfully light and fluffy in texture, and the crumble on top really gave an nice contrast to the sweet potatoes. The next time I make it I will try using graham crackers in place of flour in the crumble, and also replace the white sugar with maple sugar and brown sugar, maybe half and half. I don't know if that will be an improvement since this is already close to perfection!

This recipe is very similar to a Southern Cooking cookbook recipe my mother has used for years.  The differences: use 4 cups of steamed, mashed sweet potatoes (although most people probably use yams), 1 cup sugar, 1 tsp vanilla, 1 cup brown sugar and 1 cup pecans.  I typically don't use a full cup of white sugar and skip adding butter to the sweet potatoes.  NEVER add marshmallows to this recipe ... unless you want to go into a diabetic coma!  And stay away from the canned sweet potatoes; it makes the dish runny.  This is always a hit at our house!  Easy to say it's my favorite dish of the holidays!

This casserole was delicious. I baked 4 large sweet potatoes at 375 degrees for 1 1/2hrs. Slipped right out of the skins. Mixed this by hand bc I like the little lumps and didn't want it totally smooth. Thought the amount of sugar was perfect, not too sweet. My husband and I both agreed it did not taste like a dessert compared to others we've had in the past. Used canned evap milk. Doubled the vanilla. Baked at 350 degrees with another small casserole and that was fine, but did have to leave in a few extra minutes to get the topping done. Thank you OP! Loved it!

I used part of the recipe & made a lot of changes to it - I baked 5 sweet potatos, then peeled & mashed them, blended in 1/2 c. dark brown sugar not packed, increased vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp fresh-grated nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp sea salt, 1/2 c evaporated milk, 2 eggs, 4T soft butter; topping was 1c packed dark brown sugar, 1 1/2 c pecan pieces, 3T butter. Baked at 350 for 30 min.  The family loved this version.

I'd call this recipe good, but not great. To be fair, I was looking for something similar to what my father used to make because I was never smart enough to copy down his recipe when I had the chance. This looked right, but it was a little too mushy for my taste. That could be my fault as well, but I felt that I followed the directions fairly closely. I'm also used to the sweet potato part of the mixture being a little thicker in the pan. It spreads out pretty thinly in the 9x13 pan. I enjoyed the outcome, it just wasn't quite what I was looking for.

Loved by all at Thanksgiving dinner! Following other reviews I baked the potatoes, halved the white sugar, and doubled the topping.  It was perfect but next time I'm going to try skipping the white sugar entirely.

Absolutely delicious!! Everyone in my family loves sweet potato casserole, and they especially enjoyed this one. I doubled the recipe and there was hardly any leftovers. Family and company gave me many compliments. My dad said that it was the best sweet potato casserole he had ever had!! This will be the only recipe I use from now on!! Thanks for sharing:)

I have been making this recipe for Thanksgiving for the past 7 years or so and it is always a huge hit.  It's simple to make, yet delicious.  I usually make it with fresh sweet potatoes and a little extra crumble topping.  Each year everyone takes heaping spoonfuls and raves about it.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I tested 4 recipes (there is another similiar 1 of this), the mixture of cream and eggs won by far with me. I used for a twice baked potato vs casserole. They lighted up the mix and didn't change the flavor like the other ones did. Yes, very rich but I will save this recipe for special occasions. Cudos!

I followed another viewer's suggestion about the added brown sugar. Let me say that I made it following the directions to the letter and it was delicious, but I wanted it to taste more like a dessert so I then added the additional brown sugar. It was delicious. I cannot eat pure sugar I have to use Splenda, this was a way for me to satisfy my sweet tooth and not have the sugar. A recipe definitely worth your time to make.

I have made this for several years now.  And there is always  someone who says I don't care for  sweet potatoes, until they try it.  Then  they say wow  this is  good can't believe i like it.  I make it just as listed  think i use walnuts most of the time for the nut.  But this is a easy good recipe.

I used less sugar since my sweet potatoes were sweet.  I also baked the whole sweet potatoes in the oven instead of boiling them in water.

This casserole was delicious, the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that is was a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I will reduce the amount of white sugar and I think it will be perfect.

I have eaten sweet potato casserole my whole life and this recipe by far beats the standard raisin and marshmallow version! I baked the potatoes as recommended, reduced the white sugar and added more pecan topping, and reveled in the rave reviews. This one's a keeper!

My family loved this, even my mom who hates sweet potatoes!  I added candied pecans because I ran out of regular...it gave it a little extra crunch and sweetness on top.  Also, add a touch of cinnamon...I did and we loved it!

I don't like sweet potatoes, and even I was won over by this one. I made this with Thanksgiving dinner for the family this year and people were asking for the recipe left and right. The pecans are SO GOOD on top, it's almost more of a dessert than a side dish. I left mine in the oven probably a good hour while I was cooking other things and it didn't hurt it at all - just made the top even crunchier and delicious.

To die for!  I took advantage of some of the suggested changes and have rewritten it to suit my tastes and dietary needs, using 1/2 cup brown sugar Splenda instead of brown/white sugar and 1/2 c. of condensed milk.  I also blended the ingredients to make a fluffy purée.

I put it all together about 6 hours before Thanksgiving dinner was served and refrigerated it.  It was still perfect (no separation of ingredients) and I've passed the recipe out to several friends.

Thanks to the original poster and to the others who made modifications that suited my dish.  This is an EXCELLENT recipe.

Delicious! Yes, it's sweet and that's really not unusual for SWEET potato casseroles.  ;-)  I wish I would've doubled the topping - next time!  Very good!!

Per other reviews I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them, used 1/2 the listed amount of butter in the potatoes and 2x the topping. It was really delicious and surprisingly not too sweet.

This is a keeper in our house.  I made this for Thanksgiving & there are people with nut & egg allergies so I had to adapt a bit but it turned out great.  I left out the nuts (they probably add a nice crunch) and I substituted the eggs with 1T ground flaxseed + 3T water (let it sit 10 minutes to reconstitute) and they turned out wonderful.  Very delicious & easy to make!

I have been making this for awhile now and it's perfect!!!!!!!!!!!!! EVERYONE asks for it :]  I put about a teaspoon of cinnamon in the potato part and the topping. After I prepare it I sprinkle a bit of cinnamon on top before baking. And this time I used half/half instead of milk because it's what I had on hand... And it was creamier than ever! Def give this recipe a try!!!!! :]

Great Recipe! It's so easy and every one loves it! I've made this several times and it's always a hit! 

I add 2 tbs Cinnamon and 1 tbs Nutmeg to the sweet potatoes and a little more in the topping when I make it. I have friends who do not like sweet potato dishes they had seconds! 

Thanks Giving is coming up and my mother in law called to make sure I was making it agian this year! They love it!

OMG i have never made anything with sweet potatos before, but this was awesome! I added a pinch of cayenne pepper, and accidentally (but glad I did) tripled the amount of topping - but it was a HIT and got devoured!!

Made a lower fat version of this today for Easter Dinner and it was fabulous.  Made the following changes:

1. baked sweet potatoes as someone else suggested and then mashed in a food processor.  Refrigerated overnight.

2. Substituted 3 Tbsp of Low Fat Sour Cream for butter in casserole mixture.

3. Used 6 packets (1/4 cup equiv) of Splenda and 1/4 cup of brown sugar for the 1/2 cup of sugar called for in both casserole and topping

4. Used egg beaters instead of regular eggs in casserole.

5 added 1 tsp of cinnamon as others have suggested.

6. Didn't have any pecans so ground up some cashews and almonds instead.

7.l Used skim milk instead of regular milk.

Casserole came out light and fluffy (almost souffle` like) and tasted more like a dessert than a side dish.  Could probably cut back the sugar/Splenda by half again.

Will definitely make this low fat version again!!!

We absolutely loved this recipe.  I made it exactly as posted except I left out the pecans because my children are allergic.  I can only imagine how good it is with the nuts since I love pecans, but even without this did not dissapoint.  liked it much more than the one I typically make with marshmallows much easier!  Thanks for the recipe!

LOVE IT!! My family and I are huge sweet potatoe fans and this recipe is great (the topping makes it even better). Sweet Potato Casserole isn't just for Christmas anymore.

Everyone in my family loved this! They have already said this has to be the new recipe for special occasions. The only change I made was to cut the sugar in half, and next time I may not add any. With the amount that is in the topping it seems to be a perfect combination. Great recipe and easy to make!

Delicious!!  However, I wouldn't say this recipe serves 12 so you might want to double if you're cooking for a crowd.  Also, I left out the milk because the consistency was already perfect without it.

Soooo good. We had this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about the sweet potatoes.  I made them again the other night.  Why only have them once a year.  They were just as good.  I was out of pecans so I substituted almonds.  The were good, but pecans are better.

I love sweets, but this was way too sweet! I even halved the sugar. It was more like a desert. It was good, but I could only eat a spoonful and was left with lots of left overs because my son and husband didn't like it.

Really wonderful!  I am in Korea and the sweet potatoes here are a light yellow so I used half sweet potatoes and half pumpkin so it would have a richer color.  It was really delicious and all my friends here felt like they were getting side dishes from home.

This is incredible! The only change I made was to take the suggestions to roast the potatoes, which makes it even easier to make. Everything else was done according to recipe. I thought the proportion of topping was correct. Any more and it would have gone on the dessert table, but it's a matter of taste. I made this for a pot luck and it was a huge hit. Thank you for a keeper!

Let me preface this by saying, I do not like sweet potatoes so I actually didn't eat this.  However, my entire family did and they all loved it.  My mom made me promise to make this for every holiday from now on.  This recipe was a total hit and it was pretty easy, too.

Wow! I've been making this exact recipe for years and it is a holiday favorite! My only suggestion is to add 2-3 tsp of grated orange peel to the sweet potato mix. Lightens it up against all the sweetness!

This was my Grandmother's old recipe that she made for our family.  Now I'm the one who makes it for all the holiday family gatherings.  If you want it really more rich and creamy use half and half instead of milk.  And, drizzling melted butter on the top makes the topping cook better not to mention that extra buttery taste it gives.  :)  I Usually melt around 1/2 stick of butter to pour on the top.

Yep, I make this recipe every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas, too, and it's the only way my family even likes sweet potatoes (or yams -- you can make the recipe with yams, as well).  I originally found the recipe in a healthfood cookbook, so you can substitute raw sugar and soymilk to make it more "wholesome" if you want.

A twist on classic holiday sweets. More mature than with the usual marshmallows. Yum yum. If you have leftovers no problem they make an awesome breakfast.

This is absolutely delicious!  First of all I made this for Christmas dinner exactly as written, received many compiments, and requested as a must have for next year.  I must say I certainly did have some doubts at first, since the sweet potato mixture was the consistancy of baby food.  However, after baking the mixture did firm up. Thanks Tina B for the terrific recipe!!

This is basically the consistency of babyfood so I was wary of serving it at thanksgiving. I don't like sweet potatoes so I, myself, did not try it. However, it was the biggest hit side dish and everyone wanted the recipe so 5 stars!

Made it for Thanksgiving for the first time.  The whole family loved this....even the non-sweet potato lovers.  The only change I made was to add a few marshmallows on top towards the end.  Everyone wanted the recipe to make for Christmas.

I made this for the 2nd time this Thanksgiving and everyone LOVES it!  My dad volunteered me to make this for his office holiday party so I'm making it again today.  This will be the third time including Thanksgiving and a week after!  I also made it to go along with steaks and salad one night.  It's definitely sweet and can be more dessert like for some.  I love the topping but want to be able to make it crunchier.  Maybe a little browning will help at the end of the cooking time!  Enjoy..it's great!

AMAZING!!! I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a HUGE HIT!! I would recommend it to anybody. It is super easy too! I did bake 6 potatoes on a cookie sheet, which amounted to about 5 cups mashed. I added a tsp of cinnamon and increased vanilla to 1 tsp. I would recommend baking the yams because I just think of baked potatoes as more intuitive to boiling and it made them super easy to peal. Some say this method makes it tastier too. I would think this would be the case. Great dish!!

I tried this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and everyone really enjoyed it, although I thought it ended up being more like a desert than a side dish.  Based on reviews I decided to bake the sweet potatoes/yams - I just stuck them in the oven along with the turkey at 350 for 1.5 hours.  As reported it was easy to cut them in half and scoop out the flesh.  I actually made too many sweet potatoes and ended up with twice as much as needed for the recipe, but I didn't double anything else and it was still very sweet & flavorful so it's good to know that the amount is flexible.  I did however add an extra handful or so of coarsely chopped pecans to the top for more crunch - it looked nicer too.

Very easy and delicious.  I added 1/4 of brown sugar, and spices: 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg.

Yum! I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was sooo good! The only thing I changed was baking 3 sweet potatoes for an hour so that they were sticky and naturally sweet. Using about 2 more TBSP of white sugar and 1 cup of pecans!

I loved it however my family hated it. 

Update - I added an additional cup of sugar, 1/2 tsp of nutmeg & 1/2 tsp cinnamon. This time around they loved it. I think they were having a special moment the last time.

Excellent! My husband who hates to even try my sweet potatoes gobbled this one up. I made it in a deep dish pie plate and not only did it look like a pie, it tasted like one too.

This recipe was a success for Thanksgiving!  I did add marshmallows to half of the casserole.  My friend, who doesn't like sweet potato, actually ate some & really liked it.  She even took some home.  Thanks for a simple & delicious recipe.  Will make again for Christmas...

Took this to Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  Baked the potatoes as it eliminates the need to peel and dice, and also the mashing.  Cut sugar in the potato mixture in half.  Used a 10 inch round casserole dish that is 2 1/2 inches deep and that worked well.  It's a keeper and I plan to include it with favorite recipes I am putting together in a book for Christmas gifts.

This recipe was fantastic!  I did bake the potatoes because the oven was already on and I had read the reviews of others that did so.  Other than that, I made it exactly as written.  Everyone loved it!  Only change I might make in the future is to halve the recipe so we can enjoy any night.

Everyone loved it.  I thought it was a tad too sweet, but I've been told that it's supposed to taste more like a dessert than a sweet potato.  After I sprinkled on the topping, I added a layer of mini marshmallows (which made it even sweeter!) and it turned a beautiful golden brown in the oven.  As a dessert I give this 5 stars.

I made this recipe for the first time 2 weeks ago.  I used canned sweet potatos instead of fresh and got rave reviews.  The only thing I will do different next time is double the topping.  LOVE this recipe!

In the very early 1970s, my sister and I found a very early version of this recipe.  It was named after Senator Russell Long of Louisiana: Senator Russell's Sweet Potato Cassarole.  Of course, everyone in our family fell in love with it; even those that don't care for sweet potatoes eat it with reckless abandon.  We have made it for Thanksgiving and Christmas ever since.  I cannot say specifically anything about the recipe here because I haven't used it, but the essence of Senator Long's recipe is contained here; therefore, I will give it 4 stars.  One can Google his recipe to compare.

I found this recipe a few years ago and make it every year since. My family (including family members who HATE sweet potatoes) and I love it.  I usally make two casseroles, one with pecans and one without for my family memebers with nut allergies.  It is still good without the nuts, b/c I add marshmellows on top in place of the pecans...it is really more of a dessert this way... but it's Thanksgiving so enjoy!!!!!!

Oh this tasted soooo yummy....after I mixed the topping into the casserole.  I don't know if I did something wrong - maybe not enough butter when making the crumbly topping, but it didn't turn out quite right for me.  However, I simply stirred it into the casserole and that fixed the problem completely.  Still had the wonderful crunchy nuts without the dry topping.  Will try it again and try to get the topping right this time lol....but won't worry at all if I get it wrong again as it still turns out great if I stir it all together :)

Made this after I was given some sweet potatoes.  My family loved it so much they are begging me to make it again and it has only been two days since I made it.  I will be using this recipe again in the near future.

Really is good.  Better than the traditional Marshmallow topping recipe.  I only used one egg, and one portion of the topping.  Lots of reviewers said double it, but that would be overkill.  Thanks.

This is my go to sweet potatoe casserole recipe.  I have fixed it several times and my kids just love it. For a quick fix I use 29 oz can of cut sweet potatoes drained and halve all the ingredients.   I also will add marshmallows to the topping for a quick change.  Great!

It's SUPER sweet!  My husband said...lay this stuff in a pie crust and you've got sweet potato pie here!  It's dessert practically.  So...of course yummy!  4 Stars because it's a little too sweet for me to be a casserole and my topping was just wet and I was thinking it should've been crunchy.

Was very good!  Make a few changes.  Used egg beaters instead of eggs; applesauce instead of butter;  skim milk to replace the milk; and used 1/4 if nmaple sugar instead of 1/2 cup of sugar.  I didn't change the topping!

I would give this 5 stars! What a great recipe! My family loved this during the Holiday season and kept asking for more. We really wanted a good recipe that did not include marshmallows and this was perfect. I did the recipe as is but I did have 6 sweet potatoes instead of 4. Also, make sure you bake your potatoes instead of putting them on the stove to boil. So much better that way!!

I made this for my Christmas dinner because there were some American friends joining us.  At first they weren't sure because it isn't the typical sweet potatoes that most people make but after they tried it they said it was delicious and much better than the usual sweet potatoes with marshmallows~!^^  Will keep this one in my recipe box fore sure!

I baked the potatoes as others suggested, but boy, did I end up with a mess!  I didn't realize sweet potatoes got so juicy when baking.  Even though they were wrapped in foil, they leaked in my oven and smoke was billowing out!  What a mess!  They were nice and soft though!  :)    I cut the milk down a bit because it didn't need that much and increased the vanilla to one teaspoon.  Also omitted the salt.  They were a big hit!  I really liked the pecan topping; much better than marshmallow.  This is definitely more like a dessert.  I'm sure that's why so many people liked them!  Thanks!

I'm not a sweet potato fan but this got rave reviews at Christmas dinner.  It was very similar to another recipe I usually make but has alot less sugar, which I preferred.  This is now my 'go-to' sweet potato recipe.  My only changes were that I baked the potatoes and doubled the vanilla as others stated.

11/21/18 - 3 medium/large potatoes, pierce and bake at 375 for 1 hour 15 minutes.  Reduce sugar in filling to 1/4 cup.  Add 8 oz drained crushed pineapple.  Sub evaporated milk for milk.  Use 1 tsp vanilla.

I use this crumble topping recipe all the time.  Love the addition of pecans, butter and brown sugar.  I prefer to keep my sweet potatoes cubed instead of creamed smooth.  Add some green apple slices to the cubed sweet potatoes and dust the whole thing with a cinnamon sugar coating before loading the crumble topping in this recipe on top.  Simply spectacular.  :)~

Made this for Thanksgiving, and my husbands family loved it. I added more pecans than the recipe called for, but it worked out perfectly. I will most definitely be making this again!!

I made this for the first time at Thanksgiving.  My family loved, loved, loved it!  I even loved it and I don't really like sweet potatoes all that much.  The crunchy topping was fabulous!  I didn't use canned sweet potatoes.  I used 5 med baked yams.  I even baked them the day before to save time.  When I took the casserole out of the oven, I put it on a chafing dish so it would stay hot and they ate every last bite!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a huge hit! I added a little more than 4 cups of potatoes, but it was perfect. Thanks for sharing.

Made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I was a little hesitant when I was looking at the picture and saw how orange the casserole looked. I thought they may have used yams instead but the sweet potatoes were perfect.  I made a little extra toping for the 9x13 pan and I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them per others reviews suggestions and it made it delicious. Will definitely be making for christmas.

Loved it!  My husband also liked it and is NOT a sweet potato fan.  I used 1/2 brown 1/2 white sugar in the casserole and used Cream of Coconut since I was out of milk and reduced the amount a bit.  Also reduced the butter a bit.  Awesome!

This was great.  I had made Sweet Potato Crisp from this site last year for turkey day and it was too sweet.  I doubled the recipe and added some cinnamon and nutmeg.  Everyone agreed it was the best ever.

I used this for an expat Thanksgiving dinner in Budapest and it was a hit!  I couldn't find pecans but used walnuts on top of half.  Made the potato mixture ahead of time and refrigerated - added the crumble mixture just before baking.  One friend said I made her grandma's casserole look bad!  Thanks for a great, easy recipe that everyone loves!

This was phenomenal.  I was unsure I used the correct amount of potatoes but it turned out great. I used 3 large sweet potatoes (which equaled almost 3 pounds) and I was very happy with the result. I also increased the topping by 50% so there was a little more yumminess on top.

Made it for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I did what some had suggested: Baked the sweet potatoes at 375 until soft, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, doubled the amount of vanilla, added cinnamon, used light brown sugar instead of white sugar.  I also added honey to the mix.  After sprinkling the top with the flour/chopped pecans/butter I put whole pecans on to top for decoration. I baked it at 325 for 30 minutes and it didn't look like it was done so I put it at 375 until it was brown and crispy at the top. It came out great!

A sweet dish scrumptiously highlighted with hints of vanilla, this was a new addition to this year's Thanksgiving spread. We used yams instead of sweet potatoes; it had a great creamy texture and wonderful flavor.

Loved the flavour; dish nearly sold out.  Next time, I'll have to make the following adjustments: - use 1/3 c sugar (1/2 c too sweet)  - use 1/3 c milk (1/2 c too watery) - double pecans to 1 c - use casserole (not 9x13 pan which was too large)

Really, really yummy. Lots of compliments at Thanksgiving dinner. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon to the potatoes. Also, I made the potato mixture the night before, as well as the topping, and just put the 2 together the next day before baking.

Made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit.  I did bake the potatoes as suggested by some, and I also added some nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin spice to the potatoes.  I also used mostly brown sugar very little granulated sugar.  I was asked to make it for future dinners with the family.  This is a definite keeper for sure.

Outstanding!  My family usually won't eat sweet potatoes, but I made these for Thanksgiving and they all went!  As suggested I used 5 baked sweet potatoes, 1/4 tsp of nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, substituted evaporated milk, upped the vanilla to 1 tsp, and 1 tsp cin. I also doubled the topping. I'll have to make anothe batch this weekend to go w/ the Thanksgiving left overs!

Made it and doubled the topping and it looks great! I used cold butter so it would clump (googled "cutting in butter" and it said to use cold, not soft so it'd be clumpy).

This is a delicious recipe everyone will enjoy.  My husband is not crazy about sweet potatoes, and even this dish is a tasty treat, he enjoys.  I make this dish every year during the holidays - upon request!  This has just the right about of sweetness you will love.  I did make two changes.....I use about 4-5 med-sized sweet potatoes, and I used 1 tbsp less of butter for both the filling and the topping.  I kept everything else the same.

Try adding 1/4 to 1/3 cup of orange juice (pulpless) to the potato mixture before adding the topping.  It adds delightful brightness to an already scrumptious dish.

My husband loved it, but I'm the one rating the recipe, and I didn't care for it myself. Too sweet and too rich. It would have been better if I just baked the sweet potato and ate it just on its own...healthier too. I'm giving it three stars however, because I'm sure my husband would want me to make it again.

5 stars! This is the one and only way I will ever eat sweet potatoes. An absolute must-have for those holiday dinners. Fantastic texture and flavor in this dish. It's stick-to-your ribs comfort food that just screams Happy Thanksgiving. Thank you Tina B.

really liked this... i used 2 colors of sweet potatoes (yellow and orange) for extra color. when combining the ingredients, i didn't add the potatoes until the end...i folded them in, i didn't mash them. I liked them a little chunky. i also added 1/4 lb of bacon. great flavor !! loved the topping! made the topping JUST like the directions said, worked perfectly.

I made this for Thanksgiving 2008, but am just getting around to reviewing it.  Months after eating it, I still remember how deliciously awesome and easy it was.  It was my first time hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  My mom always made the marshmellow version, but I decided to try this one instead.  Boy was it fantastic!  Everybody loved it!!  The best part was that it was easy to make when you are cooking 10 other things in the kitchen too.  I will definitely make again...too bad Thanksgiving is only once a year!

I didn't have time to bake the sweet potatoes, but I'm sure it would have tasted even better that way. I peeled them, boiled them, mashed them, and added the other items. I also boiled them in nutmeg and cinnamon. I figured it couldn't hurt anything. I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and added the suggested 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4th of nutmeg and ground cloves. I also added a bit more sugar too. I came out fabulous! We had company over for Christmas dinner, and one lady said that my casserole tasted incredible and much better than her aunt's. Her aunt is an incredible cook, so that's saying something. They said that it wasn't too sweet at all. Next time, I might try it with baked sweet potatoes, but I boiled, them and it turned out fine.

My husband can't eat nuts, so I had to skip the toppping, bummer too, as I am a nut lover. Followed the rest of the recipe only using marshmallows for the topping and it was delicious. Thank you!

This is excellent - a major hit at Thanksgiving.  Made changes recommended by others.  Baked the yams until they were sweet and gooey, added 1 tea.cinnamon,1/2 tea. nutmeg. To cut down on fat and calories, I did not add butter or sugar to the yam mixture. Yummy is right!

This is always a big hit at my house.  I don't really love sweet potatoes that much, but I really like this dish.  My husband has requested for every Thanksgiving since I first it 3 years ago.  It's *really* sweet, but I guess that's how it's supposed to be.

This was devine!!!!!!!!!!!

I used canned sweet potates so when I mashed them I left out the white sugar.

Everyone really loved it!  I will make this again.

I am a beginner and was a little nervous when I made this dish for a work luncheon. I skipped the flour topping and just mixed pecan pieces directly in the casserole mixture before baking. It was a HUGE hit! I'm glad I doubled the recipe!! 

I made it a second time this evening as a practice run for my family Thanksgiving gathering. This time, I substituted softened cream cheese for the butter, used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, added some "pumpkin pie spice" and 1.5 cups brown sugar and .5 cup white (instead of an even split). I also sprinkled a few extra pecan pieces on top before baking, in addition to the ones I added to the mixture. IT IS OUTSTANDING!!! I can't wait to bring it to my parents' house and show them I've finally learned to make something other than spaghetti. :)

Very good!  I followed the recipe exactly and then doubled the topping.  Very popular at dinner.  However, I may play around and either use brown sugar in the potatoes or mix some oats or granola in there, becuase I like the "crunch factor" of boston market's sweet potatoes!

It has a good flavor!  I used about 4 sweet potatos for this casserole and then about a min before it was done I put a little butter and brown sugar on it again then turned up the heat to crisp it.  It was a little runny but maybe if I put 5 sweet potatos it would have been good.

omg...i love this sweet potatoe casserole, my family has been making it this way forever! My grandma calls it sweet potatoe souffle! I add a 1/4 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I think that it is much more flavorful than the marshmallow topped counterpart. The crust on top is the key, it is so good. Do not replace! It is very sweet so it can serve a duel purpose as a side and dessert. I even like this cold! so yummy...

I tried this out when I hosted Thanksgiving for my future In-laws. Word spread so fast as to how good it was that I was asked to bring it at Christmas as a dish to pass. Everyone loved it, I doubled the topping and set some aside to bake seperatly so if someone wanted a little extra they could sprinkle it on. It was a huge hit and is deffinately in my personal cookbook for life now!

This was delicious, but just a little too sweet for my taste.  I will DEFINITELY make it again, just eliminate the 1/2 cup white sugar. My family loved it! Also, it's easier to melt the 4 tbsp of butter in the microwave & add it to the mixture instead of just softened butter. No difference.

I halved the recipe since there's just the three of us.  Tasty.  Almost like dessert.  My son especially loved this dish. Next time I'll double the potatoes and keep the crumb topping the same -the proportions just didn't seem right.  I think this will be the recipe we use when we make sweet potatoes next.

for some reason, the topping didn't turn out for me..even though i was really looking forward to it...maybe i didn't do it right, too much flour or something..i dunno, but it turned out verry good for my first time...and not even testing it before hand...my boyfriend loves it and he didn't like sweet potatoes before...after thanksgiving dinner he was like "you're making this again for christmas right?" while he was still eating it...lol..thanks! will definately make again...one change is i think i cut down on the sugar...

I took a previous reviewers advice and baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them which made life much easier in the way of peeling them as well as improving the flavor.  Added spices: Cinnamon, Ground Cloves, and Nutmeg.

This was a request by my son.  I've made for the past, well I don't know how many holiday dinners, and it's always been a hit.  There is never been any leftovers, which makes my husband a little sad.  I do cut the white sugar to 1/4 cup, because there is plenty of sugar with the brown sugar topping....it's just a little too sweet as written - in my opinion.  Thanks so much for an excellent recipe.  I will use it again and again!

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving this year.  I saw several people going back for seconds & even thirds!  I didn't actually have any because I never cared for Sweet Potatoes ....but, I'm glad I finally found a recipe that everyone seemed to like.  It was really easy too, I made mine the night before--and baked it right before dinner.

I just want to say I have been looking for a Sweet Potato Casserole for the past 8 years every year I would try a new one, but after making this one this will be it for the rest of my life! I'm a sweet lover anyways so if your not to hot on sweet foods I wouldn't suggest this recipe, but if you do, this is the PERFECT recipe to try, I did use the canned yams instead because of time wise, which came out great, so I can only imagine what it will taste like when I use regular boiled yams! YUM YUM Thanks!

As requested by my son I made this dish for thanksgiving. Instead of boiling the potatoes I roasted them for about 30 min. in melted butter and a little lemon juice. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly as posted and I must say this was a hit! I have never has so many compliments on any dish that I have ever made. I will definately be making this again.

This was really good.  Even those that don't normally eat sweet potatoes ate this.  I made earlier in the day, stored in the fridge and then popped in the oven when I was ready.  Had to cook about 10 minutes longer since it was starting from cold but came out great!

I opted to not add the topping, since everyone in my family loves marshmallows (YUCK!)  But, the sweets underneath were SOOOOOOO good.  My MIL took the majority of the leftovers home for herself.  VERY GOOD RECIPE!!!!

This recipe is really good... I am not real crazy about sweet potatoes, but I did enjoy a bit of it. The sweet potato lovers really enjoyed it! I am adding this to my thanksgiving menu. I did as  one reviewer suggested and baked the potatoes for 2 hours. I baked them, then put them in the fridge overnight. I then mashed them in the morning. I could also have prepared the casserole the night before, minus the topping and been fine. 
Thanks for this keeper!

Made this for Thanksgiving, it was a huge hit! Everyone loved it. I did bake the potatoes to allow them to naturally sweeten, and next time I think I would only use 1/2 the white sugar as it was a little sweet for me, but others did not think so. A matter of preference!

I took the advice of reviewers and baked the potatos.  They turned out great.  Next time I won't whip them quite so much.  I prefer some chunks in them.

This was very popular at Thanksgiving dinner! I microwaved my sweet potatoes instead of boiling them,then peeled when they were cool enough to handle and mashed them. The only changes I made were to add a little cinnamon and pumpkin pie spice, and I doubled the vanilla, plus used whole wheat flour in the topping, because I ran out of white. It makes a LOT though, next time I'll halve the recipe. Thanks for a great addition to our holiday!

OMG! This is SO yummy! It is rather sweet, and I baked them in the skins first, as some reviews mentioned. I'd never baked yams, and forgot to prick skins first but they popped in the oven and they had formed almost a molasses on the inside of skin. SO good! I didn't put the pecans on, but did for the 2nd batch for my mother in-law. Everyone raved about it, I'll never make the marshmallow yams again!

I thought this dish was terrific but it didn't go over so well with the guests at Thanksgiving dinner.  I think it was the consistency (kind of like lumpy baby food) when they were used to cut up sweet potatoes (but without marshmallows - horrors!) so this dish may be good for people willing to TRY new things, but wouldn't serve to a traditional group of people.

Great recipe!  I used baked sweet potatoes and added cinnamon to them (maybe even 1/4 tsp nutmeg or ginger).  I also sprinkled extra cinnamon on top for added flavor.

This recipe is absolutly delicious.  My sweet potatoes will never seem marshmallows again!

This recipe is so sweet, it is essentially a dessert.  It is not cloyingly sweet, though, like when you throw marshmallows and brown sugar in with the sweet potatoes.  I followed the recip exactly and we all loved it.  I will be serving it on a regular basis as a diet-friendly alternative to other desserts.

I felt like I was "cheating" and eating dessert first.  Delicious and sweet.  Even if you think you don't like sweet potatoes, give this recipe a try, as it tastes nothing like a veggie, but rather, like a sweet treat.

Outstanding recipe!  My dish didn't look like the picture shown.  I used a little more sweet potato and the topping I mixed really well with my hands and sprinkled really pretty all on top of the dish.  It sat on the sweet potatos instead of sinking as shown in the picture...  I baked for 30 minutes and served.  I thought the presentation was much neater and enticing.  My husband loved it for our first Thanksgiving.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I love this recipe! I made it this past weekend before the Thanksgiving holiday and had to give my leftovers to my mom to take home. It turns out she gave her co-workers a taste and they're already calling me for the recipe. I LOVE IT!

This was sooo good.  I do not like sweet potatoes and I really liked this.  My son is allergic to nuts so I didn't use the pecans on the topping and it was still delicious.

Oh my goodness I should of never tried this recipe.  Sweet potatos is one of my favorite dishes. (no matter how it's prepared) I tried this recipe for the first time for my fiance and I and we absolutely love it!  I made for my job and they all loved it and wanted the recipe for it so Tina, all I have to say is "good looking" on the recipe!  I did change it up a little bit though.  I used regular sugar but I also added brown sugar to the potatos to make it a little sweeter.  And the topping?  I can't even find words to describe how good that goes with it!  AWESOME JOB!

To me this is a waste of extra calories.  I gave it a try with about 3/4 of the sugar.  Everyone liked them but like me thought they were too sweet and that was unnecessary.  So I will stick to mashed with a little salt, pepper and butter or roast them in olive oil with a touch of balsamic vinegar and chili powder and salt.

This was great. The only thing I may do is add a little bit more white sugar next time, I could go a little sweeter. Thanks I will be making it for Thanksgiving this year.

I looked all over this website at every sweet potato recipe I could find and decided on this one. I was FANTASTIC and just what I wanted out of a sweet potato casserole. It turned out really good and I especially liked the crunchy topping.  Lots of compliments and requests for the recipe.

We thought this was delicious and serve it with whipped topping as a dessert. We thought it needed twice the pecans as called for.  My prep time was more like 50 minutes and the cooking time was more like 45 minutes.  I substituted soymilk and margarine. You shouldn't reduce the salt even if you use less than most people.  I'd like to try a graham cracker crust under it. I made a half recipe and it was too thin, for my next half recipe I used 2 eggs, 1/8 cup soymilk, and 2 big sweet potatoes and it held together better.

I agree, this IS yummy. I increased the recipe by about 50%, and it turned out great. Next time I won't increase the topping amount, I should have just used the original amount. Still, everyone at Christmas loved it.

My family loved this recipe for Thanksgiving.  I added cinnamon and a pinch nutmeg to the potatoes before baking.  I also added a bit more sugar because we like it sweet!  We have always used marshmallow topping in the past but the pecan topping has become our new tradition.

Great dish.  The pecan, brown sugar, and butter topping really makes the dish.  I would recommend adding more than 4 cups of sweet potatoes though.

OMG, this is incredible.  Did a tester to see if it would be good enough to serve for get-together, and it passed!  Used canned sweet potatoes to make it easier...

I don't like sweet potatoes....until I came across this recipe.  I made it for the 1st time for a family gathering and received raves.  Of course I had to try it to see what they were talking about and it was AWESOME!

I have been making this recipe for years!  My husband LOVES it and demands it every year. I will say, I eliminate the extra WHITE sugar and use a brown sugar /sugar replacement instead to lessen the calories and sugar impact.  It being slightly LESS sweet is awesome and the delicious flavor of the sweet potatoes and pecans gets to come thru. Consider using less sugar and you still wont be disappointed.

I will be making this dish again for our Thanksgiving meal. I use 1/2 the sugar (and prefer brown sugar). I also bake my sweet potatoes and I add a bit of marshmallows on part of the top on request of my children. This is a wonderful recipe, I really love the pecan topping.

All I can say is "Oh my goodness!" This is by far one of the best sweet potato casseroles I've had/made.  Based on other reviews, and ingredients I did/did not have, I made the following adjustments: * Baked the sweet potatoes whole until soft. * Cut the sugar added to the cooked potatoes in half and used brown sugar instead of white sugar. Was plenty sweet. * Used heavy cream instead of milk. * Added 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp cloves, 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the mashed potato mixture. * Used almond flour in the topping instead of all-purpose. * And added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the topping ingredients. The recipe this way had just the right amount of spice and sweetness for me, not too much of either, allowing the flavor of the sweet potatoes to still shine through. It's also easy enough to make to be a regular in my recipe rotation, but will definitely be included on future holiday menus.

To give this recipe much-needed "zing," I just added a few drops of orange oil (essential oil), which transformed the dish--and our relatives really noticed the difference! Try it out and taste as you go to get the amount that's best for you. Also, assuming you double the recipe (which is needed to really fill a pan), I add 1 teaspoon cinnamon, a dash of nutmeg, and a little more vanilla and salt than called for. You can also cut back a bit on the sugar in the potato batter and double the topping. I find that 4-5 giant sweet potatoes are the perfect way to double the recipe. Iit's a perfect dish to make the day before a holiday. While the original recipe had substantial shortcomings, the enhanced version is really flavorful! So I am still grateful for finding this recipe in any case! Cheers.

We try to eat mostly organic.  Here are the changes I made and according to my family it is the best they have had yet.  Even my extended family who are not GF or organic loved it.

I substituted heavy wipping creme for the milk.  Almond flour for the regular flour and coconut sugar for white sugar.  I also used half the salt and added cinnamon to my liking.

This is a great starting point for a sweet potato casserole. I just made it and it did seem to be lacking some extra spice. I added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (I was out of nutmeg).  I also use a combo of light brown sugar and white sugar. Bake your sweet potatoes if you have time. It is so easy that way. 375 for 1:15 to 1:30. Squeeze each one to test if they are done. Let them cool so you can handle them without burning your hands. Use a mixer to get them soft and smooth. The little threads will stick to the mixer so you can pull them out of the batter easier. You don't want to eat those. 
You can make the night before and leave in refrigerator. Add topping and bake.

Everyone loved this casserole. However four cups (about one pound) of sweet potatoes is not nearly enough. I had 2.5 lbs but I would have preferred about 4 pounds . I did not change quantities of the other ingredients. I used a 
1-1/2 quart dish and the topping barely covered the sweet potatoes in the smaller dish. I would double the topping if using a larger dish. I assembled the casserole and refrigerated overnight and then baked for about an hour the following morning for  a family reunion. This is a great make ahead dish!

Great recipe....delicious....after you put the remainder in the fridge after serving and it get cold it is just like eating sweet potato pie.  I love this recipe.  It's a must try.  And make exactly as is, no need to change anything.

This recipe is delicious.  I added evaporated milk instead of regular milk and made two batches - one with pecan topping and the other with marshmallows for my nephew who is allergic to nuts.  Everyone loved it. This recipe is going to be in my Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays menu from now on.

I made this with four baked sweet potatoes, with all the other ingredients as written (possibly 3/4 cup of chopped pecans, only because I chopped too many). It was really delicious and a big hit at our Thanksgiving meal!

Love this recipe...make it every year since i came across it. I customized it and it tastes excellent. I'm not sure if I'm using yams or sweet potatoes though. The ones I buy have always been labelled as yams. Instead of cubing and boiling, I wrap the whole yam in foil and place in the oven at 400 degrees for about 1 hour and a half. I like doing it this way because it bring a out the yams natural sweetness and syrup thus allowing me to cut the sugar to 1/4 cup. once the yams are done I scope it out and place in a baking dish and mix all the ingredients in the baking dish.

I followed the advice of others in the comment section and baked my sweet potatoes. They were fat  so I cooked them for an 1 hour on 325. I also recommend doubling the amount of pecans to 1 cup and maybe added a little more brown sugar. This recipe is not  be enough to cover the top. Other than that it is a great recipe.

This is a Thanksgiving must in my family!   You really need to adjust the sugar to suit your own tastes.  I like it with almost no white sugar mixed in the potatoes.  For me, the topping adds plenty of sweetness, and since my father is diabetic I try to lay off the sugar so he can save it for pie!  Gage it based on how you like your baked sweet potatoes - just with butter or topped with lots of cinnamon sugar? - and go from there.
Like others I use based sweet potatoes and evap milk.  Delicious!

Sooooo good! Adaptation I made: i followed the directions suggested by the editorial staff and halved the recipe for my smaller family. I used  coconut milk (from a can) instead of milk and reduced it by a third. I used an 8 x 8 dish instead of 9 x 13, which might be why I also found that it needed more time in the oven. I cooked it at 350 for thirty minutes, discovered it was still liquid so I turned up the heat to 425 and left it another 35 minutes. All in all a huge hit!

I have made this now for the past 4 or 5 years and it's become a must have when my family is home for the holidays. Looking forward to making it again this year. But I do at least double the topping to ensure it covers the whole pan. I taste as i go to ensure my "hand adding" keeps the recipe intact.

I use real sweet potatoes, (not yams), and heavy whipping cream instead of milk. This Thanksgiving will be my 3rd Thanksgiving making these. People who do not like sweet potatoes have seconds of this dish. My mother eats it as a dessert after the meal instead of pie!

I really enjoy this recipe, but what amazes me are the constant rave reviews that it gets, with persistent demands for the recipe from those that I serve it to.

Made it for a reception. I used ground cinnamon, ground cloves and nutmeg as suggested by a earlier reviewer. This added a delightful flavor. Also I used evaporated milk as it has less water content than whole milk. Forgot the flour, no biggie and Added extra brown sugar. For the topping I added crunched corn flakes along with the pecans then I topped it off with marshmallows. Definitely bake the sweet potatoes. Tasted great!

Amazing dish and will be a staple on my menu. Definitely bake the potatoes potatoes? rather than boil, used brown sugar instead of White sugar and reduced the sugar amount. The potatoes have such a natural sweetness and with the vanilla this dish has full flavor and does not need the full amount of required sugar. My guests gobbled this up and it is so easy to make!

I made this for the first time and brought it to my sons house for Thanksgiving.  After I read the reviews, as many suggested, I made the following changes:  I baked the potatoes at 350 for 1 1/2 hours instead of boiling them.  I left out the white sugar, doubled the vanilla to 1 tsp, added 1 tsp of cinnamon, and used evaporated milk.  It was a big hit so this recipe is a keeper!

I've been making this for at least 5-6 years now and it's my daughters' favorite for Thanksgiving. The first year I made it I followed the recipe exactly except I put marshmallows on top instead of making the topping as the recipe calls for. My kids prefer marshmallows and it turns out the rest of my family loves it, too! It's become a family staple now and my daughters even request it for their birthday dinner! Thank you for sharing this recipe. Yummy indeed!

I made it this past Sunday and it was awesome, I did baked it in foil for one hour, added some cinnamon and nutmeg, carnation milk and whole wheat flour. My bf volunteered for me to make it for the family Thanksgiving dinner (that's how much he loved it).

I cannot believe I've never reviewed this. Oversight. I have made this for the past 5 years and I am always asked to bring 2 pans to get togethers because it goes so fast. As soon as I arrive to Thanksgiving I am asked "you brought the sweet potato casserole right?". I make as is but slightly lower the sugar because I don't want it to taste like dessert. I double the topping but do not completely double the brown sugar...so it ends up being way more pecans then the recipe calls for but that's how I like it. It's delicious as is, I just don't like it that sweet. I believe I've added a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg in the past...which was good, but reminded me again of dessert (sweet potato pie) so I didn't do it again. I will never make sweet potato casserole any other way than this recipe. The BEST. UPDATE: I often get this recipe and the Gourmet Sweet Potato Classic recipe on this site confused. I slightly prefer the other one, but this is nearly identical. Either one is a winner, but the Classic recipe is what I have used the most. They are both the first to go at the table. I only use 1/4 c. sugar in with potatoes, and 1 cup brown sugar with doubled pecans in with the topping.

We (reluctantly) showed up a little late to a Friendsgiving dinner and everyone had already gotten their food choices.  I thought this recipe wouldn't get eaten but before we left for the evening it was all gone and I have friends asking me for the recipe!  It was THAT good!  I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them, as many people had mentioned to do (1 hour at 325) and just scooped them into the milk/butter/etc. mixture.  I also doubled the amount of vanilla to 1 teaspoon.  I bought a package of candied pecans and smashed those for the topping and I think that really put this recipe over the top!  I will DEFINITELY be sticking with this one!

Took it to a church Thanksgiving dinner and they inhaled it.  There were other sweet potato dishes and that still had some left but not this one!  It was gone first.

It is a very savory dish. My husband loves it! However, I had to change the 4 tablespoons of butter into 4 tablespoons of olive oil so that the dish is not so high in calories. It probably is not as buttery as the original version but I love the complex taste of olive oil. I keep the butter ingredient for making the crust.

This dish is delectable!

First time making sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving. It's great if you like sweets. It was a bit TOO sweet for us. Seems like it was more of a dessert than a side dish. Think I'll stick with old fashioned "savory" mashed potatoes. Husband said it tasted like Lucky Charms!! So if you like Lucky Charms, you'll like this casserole! LOL

For anyone second guessing this recipe because so many people are insisting on changing it, don't! I made this following the directions exactly and it was amazing and a huge hit. I had never even cooked a sweet potato in my life so I was a little worried about my cooking method. I took a knife and cut (just enough to cut the skin) one time around each of the middle of the potatoes. I boiled them until they were soft and I was able to pull the skin and it slid right off. I cubed them, measured out four cups, then mashed them just like the directions suggest. They had great flavor!       With all of that said... Follow the directions! You won't be disappointed. Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

I made this last thanksgiving and Christmas.  I'll be making it again tomorrow.  Definitely bake the sweet potatoes (I bake them for two hours the night before), double the vanilla, and double the topping. I also add mini marshmallows to the topping.  My family loves it!!

Great recipe. It was exactly what I needed I've used this recipe for the past 5 years during Thanksgiving/Christmas and it's always a hit and always requested! I do make a few adjustments...I bake fresh potatoes first, then add cinnamon and nutmeg to the wet mixture. Instead of vanilla I use coconut extract which adds and very wonderful underlying flavor. When everything is finished and cooled, I drizzle a little 'zig-zag' pattern of condensed milk across the top - but  not too much or you'll lose the crisp of the pecan topping quickly. Serve immediately! The condensed  milk makes an already great dish into something out of this world! Its always the first to go from the dessert tables.

Probably the best SP Casserole I've had the pleasure of consuming. I didn't quite have time so I nuked them with some water in the microwave to save time on the prep and they still turned out wonderful. My whole family were very happy with the results, and I have plenty of leftovers for dinner tomorrow!

I usually cook for a large number of people, so I more than doubled this recipe. I did go over several reviews and added their suggestions. This dish was a hit!! I got my seven to twelve year olds making this dish because they now love sweet potatoes.... This way only.

Love! I used skim milk and splenda, and a little less brown sugar, but it turned out delicious and I had requests to take home leftovers from my dinner guests. It was delicious!

I made this for my husband's holiday party and it was a HIT. His boss asked for the recipe months later. I followed the recipe and didn't add any additional changes. It was perfect. I would make this again!!

Always a hit! I have found it's the best when I bake the 4 large sweet potatoes for 1.5 hours at 375°F, let them cool down and the skin comes right off, I double the vanilla, and I always double the topping. I also reduce the butter by a tablespoon. I have made this recipe many times and it is always a hit!

I made this for the first time this Thanksgiving. Followed the editor's note and tripled the amounts for the potato portion and kept the topping the same. But, I was in a hurry. I forgot to add the milk. The consistency and taste was so perfect that everyone insisted that I never add the milk - ever. Made it the second time this Christmas and it was voted 'best in show' at dinner. Left out the milk again. I'll never have to search for another sweet potato casserole recipe ever.

Was a little runny in the middle.  Possibly not exact measurement or cooking in small oven.  Try again.

This is my second time making this.  The first time I used already peeled and cubed sweet potato from Trader Joe's and boiled it.  This time I went with the reviews that suggested baking the potatoes, and I agree that it enhances the flavor.  I baked five sweet potatoes at 375 degrees wrapped in foil and rubbed lightly with Canola oil.  The skins pulled right off of the potatoes, and I put them in a mixing bowl.  I allowed them to mix with everything but the eggs until it cooled a bit.  I also increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  Everything else I kept the same, and it was a hit once again.  This recipe is a keeper and will be made frequently.

WOW... This dish is amazing. My husband doesn't even like sweet potatoes and he loved it. I think this will be a new staple of Christmas/Thanksgiving/Easter meals. It's pretty sweet, the white sugar could probably be cut a little like some other reviewers said, and I didn't add any extra spices but some cinnamon and cloves (as mentioned by others) would also be great I'm sure!

This dish was a huge hit with both adults and kids at my family's Christmas dinner.  I used 3 whole sweet potatoes, wrapped in foil, and roasted for 1.5 hours in the oven.  I substituted the white sugar with 2 tbsp maple syrup, but otherwise followed the original recipe.  It was so warm and fluffy...just all around everyone's favorite dish.  The sweet potatoes are sweet enough as is so next time I will eliminate the white sugar or maple syrup all together. Definitely making this for all of our Christmas dinners from now on.

I loved this recipe. I baked the potatoes, used 1/4 cup of sugar, cinnamon, 1 tsp vanilla like many others did. The biggest change I made was I didn't use pecans, I used oats instead like a cobbler, it was delicious! So if you have a nut allergy use this. So delicious!

I always make these recipes as they come, but I bought yams instead of sweet potatoes and I didn't have time to rush out to buy them so I used the yams.  This will now be a holiday dish from now on-my family LOVED it. It is so yummy, just thinking about it makes me crave more.  Serve it warm, it tastes even better warm!

Casserole is in the oven as I type. We used 6 sweet potatoes, baked in the oven. I use to buy the canned but wanted to do it up right for family coming.
***Here's a tip if you really have the time to pull it off. Anyone that eats sp's knows they can be stringy. To eliminate this & have smooth & creamy mixture we pressed all the cooled sp's thru a small mesh strainer. This step holds back the stringy stuff and makes for creamy, dreamy sp's every time! Yes, labor intensive, but hubs did this for me yesterday so all we have to do is assemble today! Merry Christmas!

I have made this recipe as stated for Thanksgiving the past 2 years and it is a big hit with my family.  I will try it doubling the topping next time per my daughter's request, but I don't think it needs a thing.  Excellent as is!

This is a very yummy recipe. It was a little too sweet for me. I reduced the white sugar to 1/3 C but I think I will reduce to 1/4 cup next time. I will also increase the pecans and decrease the brown sugar for the topping next time. I just prefer it a little less sweet. My daughter told me not to reduce the sugar for the kids, it's great just the way it is!

Everyone loved it!  I baked my sweet potatoes whole in the oven which developed the sugars and made them so sweet that I barely added any sugar to them.  I doubled the topping.  It was delicious!

Made this for Thanksgiving, following the Editor's notes (except we doubled- instead of tripled- the potato mixture ingredients) and added marshmallows on top.  Flavor was amazing without being too sweet.  NEW family tradition/favorite!!

YUM! I made this for Thanksgiving this year and even those in my family that don't like sweet potatoes loved it!  I did add marshmallows in with the sweet potatoes and used Splenda brown sugar substitute.  Amazing.  Next time I make it I think I will try adding some crushed pineapple. Thanks for sharing!

Loved this recipe.  I added 3/4 tsp of ground ginger to the potato mixture and made 1 3/4 as much topping (almost doubled it).  I usually cheat and use canned yams but this time I used the real sweet potato.  Delish!

This was alright, not sensational, I felt there was something missing in it, as it was a bit bland.  Next time I think I will double the topping on it and add brown sugar instead of white and maybe cinnamon and nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture. It was probably the most disappointing dish on the table at Thanksgiving, but that said it was disappointing when compared to a spread of dishes that everyone raved about, this had to be my most successful Thanksgiving yet as there wasn't a single dish that anyone thought wasn't good.

Yummy!!!  I wanted to do something different with sweet potatoes this year for Thanksgiving, so I tried this recipe.  Everyone loved it!  Easy to make too.  The only change I made was to double the recipe but I used 1/4 cup white sugar and 1/4 cup brown sugar in the sweet potato mixture.  Next time I will try with evaporated milk.  Delicious!

We enjoyed this dish...made it the day before Thanksgiving, took it out of the fridge to bring to room temp before putting into the oven. What I won't do next time is double the topping for a single batch as some comments had suggested...way too overpowering.

This was my first time making Sweet Potato casserole and  even eating sweet potato.  This dish was AMAZING! The whole family loved it! This recipe had easy ingredients and was very easy to understand.  The only thing I did different was baked the sweet potatoes at 325 degrees, let them cool and peeled. However the end results was delicious!

This recipe was the BEST I ever tried. However I did not use as much milk as it called for but did use almost double the butter. Some of the people wanted to know if this recipe could be made into a pie. mmmm   might just give it a go

This recipe was fantastic and I got this because I was going for candied sweet potatoes and over cooked them so I needed a fall back and I found this, my good fortune.  The only change I made was using cream rather than milk.
I will be making this again, I think people liked this better than what I set out to do.

Followed the recipe as is except added 1 1/2 tsp of cinnamon into the topping. I loved it (and I am not a huge sweet potato fan) and my husband had far more than he needed.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving yesterday for the first time and it was wonderful!!!!!! I absolutely loved it! I did double the vanilla extract and added some cinnamon as well. I used evaporated milk. For the topping I had to add in about a 1/4 of a cup extra because it seemed to need a tad more. Maybe because I was making a large quantity of servings but other than that It came out excellent, my family loved it! I will certainly make it again!

Best sweet potato casserole!  Based on others reviews, I baked 4 large sweet potatoes, used brown sugar instead of white sugar and added 1 T. Vanilla and 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice.  I also topped half with marshmallows because not everyone likes pecans.  Both were great!

made this for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  I added nutmeg and cinnamon to the topping and cinnamon to the sweet potatoes.  I made the sweet potato casserole earlier in the day amd kept it in the fridge until  thirty minutes prior to dinner. I did not add the topping until just before baking.  This was a real time saver!

This recipe was fabulous! The only thing I did different was a teaspoon of cinnamon in the topping. Everyone loved it. I did one regular and one with Splenda (no topping).  I will continue with this as our family's sweet potato casserole. Thanks for a great recipe.

I have to make this casserole for my husband's family's Thanksgiving dinner every year now because it was such a hit at the first one I brought it to. Love it! The only thing I do different is that I don't soften my butter before I cut it in for the topping.

Definitely had some changes:
Subbed evaporated milk for regular
Added a full tsp of (our own homemade) vanilla extract
Tsp Ceylon cinnamon
1/2 tsp ground cloves
1/2 tsp ground nutmeg
Threw out topping, used mini marshmallows (always my fave since being a kid - I know it isn't for everyone)

Delicious! I even used only 4 tablespoons of organic sugar instead of 1/2 cup! But I did bake my sweet potatoes in oven first not boiling them brings out the natural potato sweetness!

OAn additions of the spices I will rate this recipe a 5. With reduced sugar and butter from mostly grandma's recipe , it was a much better.I also did not have any pecans on hand so I did use walnuts and it still was great.

This was amazing! I made it for Easter Dinner and had rave reviews.  Instead of boiling I baked the sweet potatoes and to the streusel topping I added cinnamon, everything else was made as per the directions.

I make this EVERY Thanksgiving. It is Wonderful!!! The topping packs so much flavor that I could eat a bowl full of it alone. I add marshmallows & brown for added sweetness. The creamy texture beats all others!!!

Made this for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a huge hit with the family!  The only issue that I had with the recipe is that the pecan mixture does not exactly "Sprinkle" on the top of the sweet potato mixture.

We made this recipe in lieu of sweet potatoes with marshmallows which didn't seem to go over too well the past few years.  The family was actually chanting "PECANNED YAMS, PECANNED YAMS,"  It was gone in 10 minutes! Bowl was scraped clean!!  Delicious!!!

This is a very good recipe.  I did revise it a little bit.  I used maple syrup instead of sugar in the potato mash and omitted the vanilla.  Other than that, I followed the recipe and it was so good I will share it with my cooking associates.  The egg adds poofy lightness, and the topping adds wonderful crisp texture.

This recipe is similar to one my family uses. We use canned sweet potatoes, drained and mashed, leave out the milk and follow the remainder of the recipe. Even my son eats these and he hates sweet potatoes. This year, I baked them in a 8"x 8" baking dish which made the layers a bit thicker and had only a few left after Thanksgiving.

This was great.  I followed recipe as written, but I used walnuts because that's what I had on hand, and I added some cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves.  I can see how doubling the topping would be even more delicious, but it was great without doubling, too.

Made it, as is, took it to a Christmas party, got rave reviews... but personally I think it needs twice the potato base. Spread out in a 13 x 9 pan it's very thin. But maybe that's just me, nobody else noticed. Go for it.

I made this for a work Christmas party and it was a hit! I followed some of the recommendations from other reviewers and baked the potatoes in the oven at 375 for 75 minutes before mashing them. I also used evaporated milk in place of regular milk and cooked it for about 10 minutes longer than called for. I had doubled the recipe and still backed it in a 9 x 13 baking dish so the amount of topping was perfect. I will be making this again for parties and holidays!

I have to make this every holiday now or my family will throw a fit.  I took reviewer Melissa's tips:  Always bake the potatoes instead of boil & double the topping.  No one is ever going to complain that there's too much pecan topping!! You can bake those potatoes in advance, but do take the skins off before they go in the fridge - it's just harder to separate when they're cold.

I used 5 large sweet potatoes but did not increase the amount of streusel. As advised by others, I used evap. milk instead of reg. milk, halved the white sugar, doubled the vanilla, and added 1/4 tsp ground cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg to the sweet potatoes.  I then added 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the streusel mixture. I prepared this hours before serving and then baked just before eating. Yum!

This was the hit of my Thanksgiving dinner!!!  I took others' advice and roasted the yams for about an hour at 400.  I think I should have roasted them a little longer, but they were still fabulous.  I also added a little nutmeg and cloves and doubled the topping (with no gross pools of butter, as one reviewer predicted).

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving and served it side-by-side with my standard whipped sweet potatoes with marshmallows. Even the marshmallow lovers preferred this one! The nutty streusel on top is irresistible -- even the non-sweet-potato eaters were converted into believers! :)

This was the best sweet potato casserole I've ever made or eaten!  It's light instead of heavy like many of the recipes I've tried.  My husband said all it needed was a crust!  I increased the vanilla, added cinnamon and ground cloves.  I also used brown sugar in place of the white sugar.  There was none left!

This is our new favorite.  I took one suggestion from another reviewer and increased the vanilla to 1 tsp.  I think when I make it again I will leave it at 1/2.  Other than that this was by far the best, and every year I have tried different recipes.  This is a keeper!

I followed the recipe fairly carefully, except I baked the potatoes instead of boiling, used brown sugar (and only about half) for the main part, and not so much milk. I used a deeper dish so cooked for about 40 minutes total. It was a super hit with all ages at the Thanksgiving table, but everyone commented that it would be much better if it wasn't so sweet (even though I cut back on the sugar). It really tasted more like a decadent desert! I'll definitely make again, but next time won't use so much butter or sugar.

We tried this for Thanksgiving, and it received raves.  I baked the potatoes and scooped them out, which made for no cleanup. Whipped it all up in the food processor- no stringiness or glue-like texture at all, and SO easy.  Only other change is I added golden raisins in the potatoes; like my grandmother-in-law's sweet potato souffle.  Silky and delicious!

Delicious.  Followed recommendations to reduce sugar and add seasonings.  It still turned out very sweet and like pie filling but it was delicious.  Will still reduce sugar more next time we make it to make it as a side.

Yum! Used 3 c. roasted sweet potatoes, 1/3 c. brown sugar instead of white and 1/3 c. milk. For the topping I used, 1/3 c. of flour, pecans, and brown sugar with the 3 Tbsp. of butter. Baked in a 8x8 inch dish for 45 min. Best sweet potato casserole recipe on allrecipes!

My mother and family beg me to make this every year for Thanksgiving. My fiancé even hates sweet potatoes, but loves this casserole. It's a hit. I follow the recipe as it's intended EXCEPT that I do bake my sweet potatoes rather than boil them. They come out so much better. Also, you do not want canned sweet potatoes, it won't be the same, so plan for the extra time and step and bake them. You won't regret it. The crust is a little skimpy for the amount of potato to cover, but it works. I've never had complaints. Let go of the marshmallow tradition and start a new one this year! Your family will LOVE IT!

Just like what I grew up with. Don't get the whole marshmallow thing! This way is much better. Our secret family added ingredient is some brandy extract puts them over the top good.

Made this today for dinner. It was delicious. Tastes more like a dessert. Only change was I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. Definite keeper!

Made it a few times and it's always a hit. I use brown sugar instead of white and use a little less than half a cup so its not too sweet. I also added half a tsp of allspice and half a tsp of cinnamon. The flavor was great!

I really liked this recipe. I lost my favorite recipe a few years ago and searched in desperation for a similar one. I adapted this recipe a little. I used brown sugar instead of white. Like some other people said baking the potatoes instead of boiling them yields a better taste. I toasted the pecans before I added them to the topping.

So delicious! Doesn't need any changes. I like to prepare the dish the night before and refrigerate overnight until ready to bake. Much easier the day of. I have made this twice, for Thanksgiving and for Easter. A hit on both occasions with different families (mine and my boyfriend's). Thanks for the great recipe!

We grew our own sweet potatoes for the first time in our Michigan garden...nice harvest.  Made this recipe for Thanksgiving and did not have 1 bite left over!  Absolutely fabulous.  Creamy, great potatoe flavor, not too sweet, crunchy topping.  Didn't change a thing except used slightly less  sugar (1/3 cup) It will be our recipe of preference for this vegetable (besides just a great plain baked sweet potatoe).  Thank you!

I have made this twice.  The first time our family (even my sweets-loving daughter) thought it was good but too sweet and there wasn't enough of the pecan crumble.  The second time, I omitted the white sugar,  made 1-1/2  X's the topping and used an 11x 7 pan.  We added a bit cinnamon, too.  So without much change at all, it has become a favorite.

Great! Not too sweet and really easy to make. I made it for an easy Christmas lunch and everyone liked it. I did add cinnamon and pinch of 
nutmeg but not enough to overpower the sweet potato taste.

I made this recipe for the first time this thanksgiving! It was like having dessert with dinner! Normally my family never ate the sweet potatoes but they devoured these. The nice crunchy nut topping was the perfect touch! It will definitely be served every thanksgiving holiday in my home if not other times during the year.

I have made sweet potatoes the old fashioned marshmallow way for years and at Thanksgiving this year decided to try something new, and I tried this.  I can not tell you how wonderful it is.. And even my picky family members loved it.  This is our new way of doing sweet potatoes.. They are to die for.. Thanks so much for such a great recipe.

This recipe has become a holiday favorite. It tastes delightful. It is wonderful with turkey and with pork. We think its the perfect replacement for the terribly syrupy candied sweet potatoes of the past and it can replace mashed white potatoes at the holiday table becasue it has a bit of the whipped potato texture. I cook my potatoes in their jackets, let cool, then peel off and use the mashed. I prefer this to cubing hard potatoes.

This recipe was okay. My family and I weren't very fond of the brown sugar topping. The sweet potatoes themselves, were great but the brown sugar gave made the casserole, VERY, VERY, sweet. I would suggest finding a substitute or using very minimal brown sugar.

Wonderfully delicious and very easy to make!  I made a half recipe, using four large sweet potatoes.  Rather than boil, I baked them in foil at 340 F for 90 minutes.  Then they slip right out of their skins and taste flavorful!  Next time, I will reduce the amount of sugar and butter in the sweet potato mixture slightly.  It was the perfect amount of topping.

This was absolutely amazing!!!  I baked 5 large sweet potatos, used evaporated milk and cut down the sugar.  Many people praised this dish and my husband who hates sweet potatos said this did not taste like sweet potatos.  Yum, yum, yum!!  I will be making this all year long.  Highly recommend.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner. It was a hit! I just had to omit the pecans because my baby cousin was allergic to nuts. It still turned out good!

This is the first time I have made a creamy casserole versus just baking sliced up and sugared sweet potatoes.  Everyone at thanksgiving LOVED this casserole and was asked for the recipe by several people.  I will be adding it to my holiday menus from now on!  I did add a bit cinnamon & nutmeg to the mix, which I felt it needed.  I loved this topping...searched to find a recipe without the usual overly sweet marshmallows...and so happy I found this recipe~thanks Tina B!

As one person put it, This is like eating dessert!  Yummy.  I did not double my topping, but did put it in a smaller dish than a 9X13 and it worked well.

I like that this recipe calls for 1/2 the sugar as most sweet potato casseroles.  It was good, but the sweet potato portion seemed to be missing some flavor (and I baked my sweet potatoes instead of boiling).

Absolutely the best! It was the star of our Thanksgiving. I did use evaporated milk and brown sugar. (don't like using white sugar unless I have to.) This is a YOU MUST MAKE recipe!

This recipe is way too sweet. Tastes more like dessert than a side dish. My husband enjoyed the leftovers warmed up with some heavy whipping cream. I would make it again but double the sweet potatoes, cut out most of the sugar, and just top it with nuts instead of the brown sugar mixture. The delicious taste of sweet potatoes is totally lost in this dish.

I am not a fan of sweet potatoes but I am now!! This was amazing and my Thanksgiving guests gobbled it up leaving me with very little for leftovers. I made only minor changes....instead of fresh sweet potatoes I used 2 cans of yams that I microwaved for 10 minutes and then mashed, used regular milk, doubled the topping (added a little more brown sugar to topping) and still added marshmallows on top of it all. This will be my new family tradition added to every holiday meal.

I followed some of the reviewers comments to use Yam and bake them, but took almost 3 hours under 375 degrees. I like quick and easy dish, next time I will definitely follow the recipe exactly and boil the yam. I love Yam. It's definitely much sweeter than Sweet potatoes. I doubled the topping, which was a great move, but only use 2/3 of the topping overall. I also reduce the sugar in the mashed potatoes and use brown sugar instead, but at the end I found that It needed more sugar, I think it will give much more kick when it is a little sweeter to balance with the whole savory Thanksgiving meal.

This recipe was delicious! I don't care for sweet potatoes, but it was Thanksgiving so I just had to try this recipe. I omitted the white sugar and upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. I also added a sprinkle of cinnamon sugar to the potato mixture. Fantastic!

Update: Thanksgiving 2019. I made this mostly according to directions this time: I used canned yams, extra vanilla, and Morena Pure Cane sugar (coarser than traditional granulated white sugar) from Walmart - doubled everything except the topping. I threw all the ingredients in the Ninja because I wanted a light, fluffy casserole. It was better than I ever remember it being before. There aren't enough words to express how much we loved this!                                                           
OLD REVIEW:                                                     
DEFINITELY YUMMY!!! I read through the reviews and followed many suggestions: a can of sweet potatoes to save time, lt. brown instead of white sugar, evaporated milk, and 1 tsp of vanilla rather than 1/2. I did not double the topping mix like some suggested because I don't like too much topping. Luckily I didn't because I used a 9x13 pan as directed and the sweet potato layer was thin. Also, it was super easy to make; I just threw everything in the bowl and used a hand-held immersion blender. This was THE BEST sweet potato casserole I've ever had.  I wish I had doubled the recipe.  So yummy!

This turned out great, but just a little bland.  I guess I'm used to "candied" sweet potatoes.  I read dozens of reviews and added many things that people suggested like nutmeg, ground cloves, cinnamon, orange peel spice, pumpkin spice, dribble of mapel syrup and doubled the vanilla.  I used evaporated milk.  Maybe it would be tastier if I had baked the potatoes in their skin instead of boiled them (I started boiling them before I read all the reviews with that recommendation!) Everyone really enjoyed this dish, so it was successful, but next time I might add brown sugar or more syrup.

This is hands down the best sweet potato recipe I have ever found.  It completely lives up to it's name.  Starting from scratch (peeling/boiling/mashing) was definitely the way I go- the texture was spot on and the topping was heavenly.   I'm not allowed to attend anymore holiday dinners without this in tow.

Delicious! I heeded the recommendations by others and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, and 1 tsp of vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. I also left out the streusel topping and opted for marshmallows instead. Will definitely make this again! So good!

Made this for a potluck, and everyone loved it.  On the advice of others, I baked the potatoes instead of boiling.  They didn't even need mashing, but mixed everything together wiht the electric mixer.  I added 4 tablespoons of maple syrup on the advice of a friend, and also added a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I am making this for Thanksgiving as well.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I don't even like sweet potatoes, but I wanted to make them last thanksgiving for my guests. I tried this recipe, and loved it! I am now asked to bring these every year. The candied pecans are an awesome topping. I didn't modify anything, however I also didn't measure. I just threw in the ingredients in amounts that seemed appropriate. Thanks!

perfect! I agree with other reviewers that adding other spices like clove and nutmeg is good, I also used a heavier cream instead of milk. But the topping is great!

I 'took a chance' with this recipe 3 years ago, and it truly has became a new 'tradition'! Everyone absolutely LOVES this and checks with me every year to make sure that I am going to make it (-even my husband who does not like sweet potatoes!)! In fact, everyone wants more sweet potato casserole instead of dessert! I left the recipe 'as-is' and did not change a thing! Absolutely amazing! Thank you for sharing!!! :)

Amazing!  Too many of these dishes are so saturated with butter, brown sugar and marshmallow that you cant taste the sweet potato.  But loved the freshness of this recipe.  I baked the sweet potatoes for 45 mins and then peeled them  mashed them and followed the recipe exactly.  Turned out so good!  
Thanks you for posting this!

Perfect casserole, delicate, sweet with just the right amount of nutty flavor.  My entire family begged me to make it over and over- since they're pretty hard to please, this recipe is a real winner!

This is the same recipe that I have been making for many years.  Mine came from a Southern Living cookbook.  If I could give it more than 5 stars, I would.  It's like a dessert it's sooo good!  It will definitely become a tradition at your house once you introduce your family to it.

An excellent recipe ~ like dessert! I added raisins to the sweet potatoes and some coconut to the topping which was a hit. I also microwaved the potatoes to cook them and the peel comes off very easily (less mess). This will become a tradition in our home!

I have made this recipe for years, except that I grate the sweet potato instead of mashing it. It is everyone's favorite and I usually eat a second helping for dessert rather than pie!

I followed the top two helpful reviewers (Melissa & Auntnett) and baked the sweet potatoes, halved the sugar and substituted brown sugar for the remainder; Then I made double the amount of topping.  The results?  Tons of compliments on Thanksgiving!  I didn't even know my husband would eat sweet potatoes!  My hint?  When you see a recipe with a thousand reviews retaining its five star review record - use it!  This one is a winner.

Even though I accidentally mixed the ingredients in steps 2 and 3 together the recipe was still AMAZING. I usually dislike sweet potato, especially the canned kind but this was just mind-blowing. The taste blew me away. Best sweet potato recipe by far.

Yummy is an understatement!!! This recipe was awesome!  The first thing to get completely devoured during Thanksgiving Dinner!  In fact, it was so good that I made it the next night to accompany my leftovers!  Followed the recipe exactly... My only suggestion would be to use a smaller baking dish to make it a thicker and more proportioned serving!

Best sweet potato casserole ever!  Third year in a row on our Thanksgiving menu.  My daughter who always said she doesn't like sweet potatoes loves these.  I use 3 pounds of fresh sweet potatoes which I bake in the oven and then scoop the potato out of the skins.  I think it tastes better than boiling them and very easy to mash.  That is the only thing different that I do to this recipe.  Wonderful!

Had great reviews and the dish came back empty. I was worried that there was too much sugar in the dish but it turned out fine. The crunch and flavor from the pecans gave it a nice balance from the sweetness. I toasted the nuts. Not sure if it makes much of a difference. Some reviewers said they suggest doubling the topping recipe, but for me I didn't double the topping and it was plenty enough. I also used 2 types of sweet potatoes: Japanese yams and sweet potato. The Japanese yams were favored over the other. Have been requested to make it again for Christmas. Plan on using Japanese yams instead.

I'll never do it again! I will never make sweet potatoes from a can again. I'm a little ashamed to admit at my age (21 and holdin') that I've never made 'from scratch' sweet potato anything..Well all that changed today..My family LOVES these silly lookin' things. I did follow the advice of some other reviewers (thanks y'all!)..I baked them at 350 degrees F for about an hour to 1.5 hours. I let them cool a bit, skinned, and cubed them into the bowl of my Kitchenaid mixer. Instead of 1/2C white sugar..I added 1/4C white, 1/4C brown, 1 full tsp of vanilla, and 2 TBSP of orange juice. I had to leave the pecans out of the topping (terrible, I know) because hubby has a tree nut allergy. I added a few mini-marshmallows to round out the topping (although I didn't think we needed it but my kids did)

love it!  mine didn't turn out as pretty as some others, but that crunchy on top of fluffy potatoes was nice.  I like that the filling isn't too sweet and i used butter toffee peanuts instead of pecans.  tastes like peanut brittle on top, yum!

Just great as is or with the addition of minced, crystallized ginger for a change - yummy!

It seemed more like a dessert than a casserole. I will definitely make it again but maybe next time I will use a smaller deeper pan so that it's has more of a casserole less of a dessert flavor.

Rave reviews for this meal!!  I'm sure the butter and brown sugar are the keys to make this melt in your mouth.  I took it to a Thanksgiving potluck for my partner's work and it was gone within 2 minutes of coming out of the oven!

I found this to be absolutely delicious! The only change I made was to substitute oats for the nuts as I have family members with nut allergies. I will definitely be making this again! Thanks for sharing!

Heavenly. Since I have Celiac disease, I substitute corn starch for the flour to make it gluten-free.

I sometimes top it with marshmallows instead of pecans, and when I use nuts I prefer walnuts, although I'm sure the pecans are great too.

I made this for the 1st time for Thanksgiving at my moms house. Made it the day before and we reheated it right before dinner. THERE WAS NOTHING LEFT AFTER THE DINNER. Everyone wanted to take some home, and it wasn't possible. Same thing happened at Christmas. Now I have been requested to make this every holiday, and everyone has been asking me for the recipe. My family Calls it "Caitie's Sweet Potato Casserole" even though I told them I used this recipe from this website. Thank you Tina for sharing this WONDERFUL recipe!!

This recipe is a lot like another one I have tried and I'd like to suggest the following changes for people who want to try another version:

   * walnuts are also delicious in this
   *  use brown sugar instead of white
   *  maple flavoring is great in place of vanilla

Delicious. I made too much, but after people got over the fact that it wasn't a sweet potato pie they really enjoyed it. I got to munch on it for days. Lovely!

This was so quick and easy to make up, and was a hit.  I cubed and boiled the potatos, but next time may try roasting them or quick cook in the microwave. Had lots left over so will make a light topping again and heat.

Great recipe.  A tad sweet perhaps, but lovely.  I used 3 large sweet potatoes, but next time may up that a bit, and I nuked the potatoes rather than boiling...then just scraped the soft flesh out of the skins and into a bowl.

WOW, thats all I can saw!!! However, Definately BAKE and not boil, adds a lot of flavor, also if you bake, use 2-3 large sweet potatos, I don't feel like I had enough with just 2 med size potatos.

Very close to my mother-in-law's recipie she made for 50 years.  Try adding coconut to the topping(1/2 cup) for an extra special treat.  Always served at holidays.

I used extra sweet potatoes because there were more people to feed.  Still only used 1/2 c sugar but found the whole dish was a little too sweet.  Wld decrease sugar in topping next time.

High quality southern style sweet potato casserole.  I boiled my potatoes (instead of baking) and thought it turned out fine.  Usually I add more nuts than recipes call for but this one didn't need much more.  Good stuff!

Its like floating on a creamy dream of love. Thats all there is to say about it. Definitly use the suggestions of the person that says they made it better, roast the sweet potatoes, and finally i added a bit of cream cheese to make just a touch more delicate.

Made this casserole over the Thanksgiving. It turned out great! Not much was left of the dish. My future mother in law is asking me to make it again for the Xmas dinner at her house on Saturday! YUMMY :)

Everyone raved about this recipe. I baked the potatoes instead of boiling, it gave a little more flavor. Thank you this was much better than any of the ones with marshmallows and whatnot.

Similar to the recipe that I use. Very good. I also bake the sweet potatoes and add 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1/4 tsp of nutmeg to the filling. Yummy :)

This is the absolute best recipe!  I made it last year and had requests to make again this year.  Already made it twice for Thanksgiving and will be making for Christmas as well.  Even people that don't like sweet potatos have like this!

This was my first time making a sweet Potato casserole, and I must say that it turned out Excellent, I did substitute the white sugar for brown sugar  since I did not have white sugar, but this dish turned out great!

I made this for thanksgiving based on the reviews and used some of the suggestions ex. baking the potatoes- this made it very easy. and adding the spices. I used fat free evaporated milk cut the sugar down 1/4 cup and added 1 tsp. vanilla 1 tsp. of cinn. 1/4 tsp of groung clove & ground nutmeg.   We are not  big sweet potato fans but it sounded good. I made everyone at least try it. It was a big hit everyone loved it. I will make this every year and even for Christmas.

Super yummy! I did what others said and baked the yams instead of boiling them. Just popped them in the oven w/ the thanksgiving turkey for about an hour and a half. The skin slid right off. Mashed them w/ a fork and voila. I did double the pecan, and added marshmallows the last 10mins. Great great recipe. I'll make this again.

Outstanding recipe. For my first Thanksgiving cooking myself I made this and my family was so suprised that this recipe and the other recipes I made came out sooo good. This was one of the hits of the deal and it only lasted that day. The two alterations I made was i used sweet organic yams and  based on another reviewer i doubled the topping! Yum! Again another recipe for years to come!

Substituted brown sugar for the white sugar and heavy cream for the milk. Even my sister who isn't a big fan of sweet potatoes loved this recipe.  Definitely a new Thanksgiving staple.  Made 2 batches, 1 I put marshmellows on top and toasted.

I followed this recipe,but I used the can of Yams since that's what the hubby bought!It turned out great! I think it's the perfect amount of sugar and spices. I took this to family's house and made a second one the next day for guests. It was a big hit both times! Great recipe :)

This was absolutely delicious!!  I read all of the reviews, and instead of baking the potatoes due to a lack of time, I did boil them.  I put the 4 cups of cubed sweet potatoes in the pan and covered with water.  Instead of leaving it at that I added about 1/3 of a cup of brown sugar to the water and potatoes making the water more of a syrup, and then boiled.  I doubled the topping and everything came out superb!  I took it to Thanksgiving dinner with the in-laws and it was a huge hit.  Thanks!

I made changes to this recipe. I decreased the sugar by using 1/4c instead of 1/2. I used evaporated milk instead of milk. I added cinnamon, clove and nutmeg for the topping.

Tastes just as I'd hoped.  I lost my mom's recipe but thought this one looked close.  I used slightly more sweet potatoes...probably close to 6 cups and double the crunchy layer as it's our favorite part :-).  It was PERFECT!  Thank you!

We make this GF by subbing half tapioca/half brown rice flour and it's a huge hit with everyone! I use about half as much sugar as the potatoes call for and we often substitute coconut milk and Earth Balance spread instead of butter. Just as delicious! A holiday fave!

It turned out pretty good.  Followed suggestions and baked them for an hour at 325 and also doubled the topping.  Was worried at first that it was too sweet but it was actually pretty good!  Will make def make again.

Thanksgiving 2010.  I baked the sweet potatoes at 375deg for about 75minutes.  Need to remember next time to get similar sized potatoes so they take the same amount of time to cook.  Substituted white sugar with brown sugar and instead of topping, used marshmallows.  Delicious!

This recipe worked out great for me! I added in 1/8 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, and 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon for some extra spice. I also added around 6 cups sweet potato and a little less milk than called for (around 1/4 cup). I made this for my roommate, myself, and a friend for thanksgiving and everybody LOVED it. I'll definitely use this recipe again!

I don't normally eat sweet potatoes, and I made this mostly for the rest of my family, but I tried a spoonful and thought it was better than most other sweet potato dishes I've had.  Using fresh sweet potatoes instead of canned makes a big difference, I think.  I took many other reviewers' advice and baked my 4 huge potatoes on a cookie sheet at 375 for about an hour and a half.  My cousin and I then peeled them, mashed them, and blended everything with a hand mixer.  We added cinnamon, too.  I didn't do an awesome job with the topping; it turned into more of a liquidy glaze with pecans on top instead of a crumbly topping, but it kind of just blended into the potatoes and tasted good anyway. I'd use this recipe again if ever asked to bring sweet potatoes to a holiday meal.  Thanks!

Great recipe! I used fresh potatoes once, and canned once and got a similar result! I also added a little cinnamon to the sweet potato mixture to give it a little more kick.

I make a gluten/dairy free version of this since my sister is intolerant of both. I use honey instead of the white sugar, corn starch instead of the flour, vegan/lactose free butter and almond milk instead of the regular milk. Turns out delicious and everyone can eat at our table

Very yummy. Better than my mother's sweet potato casserole. Yeah, I said it :) I made this a day in advance minus the topping, and then added the topping and popped in the oven for about 20 minutes right before dinner. I took the advice of other reviewers and baked the yams instead of boiling them. I also let the casserole sit at room temp for a couple of hours before adding the topping. Thank you, I will be making this for years to come.

This is the 2nd year in a row I have made this - I am the offical 'Sweet Potato' maker for the family now! Everyone LOVES this recipe! I follow it exactly and it is amazing! One mistake I made this year - I was trying to pre-prep everything the night before and I mashed the sweet potatoes and put them in the fridge. When I went to mix in the 'softened butter', it immediately hardened into clumps (obviously). The dish still tasted the same however.  A-MAZING!!!

My loved one loves this - though admittedly it's almost too dessert-like.  Next time I'll double the amount of sweet potato to topping so that it's savory enough.  Great recipe.

This is almost just like my recipe. The only difference is I use heavy cream instead of milk and I add a couple Tbsps of Amaretto Liqueor. I have been making this recipe for 20 years now and there is no way I would get away with not making it at the holidays.

This is an incredible recipe!!! The only changes I made was I used only 1/4 cup white sugar, and only 3 tablespoons of butter in the sweet potato mixture. Husband LOVED it! This will become a staple in our household.

My husband is from Trinidad and Tobago and apparently there sweet potatoes are not the same as our sweet potatoes, I didnt find that out until after I made this dish for him. It is not what hes used to but he loved it. He said I needed to make it more often.

This recipe was great! I love how it turned out. I did a little twist on the suggested topping and it came out great. I added the nuts on top and then added a layer of mini marshmallows! It was a hit on Christmas!

This is a wonderful recipe as listed here.  Fixing it the third time for an office luncheon, I tried adding the cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon and most people thought it tasted too much like a dessert (pumpkin pie).

This recipe is outstanding. I baked the sweet potato and cooked once with the pecans and once without (nut allergy) and both times it was a hit.

This is so good, even people who say they don't like sweet potatoes like it.  I use yams for the color; and used Splenda in the topping the 2nd time I made it.

amazing! I made a few alterations though: I added 1 teaspoon each of cinnamon and allspice, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves, and a 1/4 teaspoon of nutmeg to the potatoes and about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon to the topping. Also, instead of 1/2 cup sugar, I used 1/4 cup sugar and 2 tablespoons each of molasses and maple syrup. As previous reviewers have said, it is absolutely essential that you bake the potatoes instead of boiling them! I baked 2 large potatoes at 375 degrees for about an hour and 15 minutes, or until a fork goes in easily.

Made this for Thanksgiving and everybody loved it!  I had to make half of it with marshmallows on top to appease my kids, and put this topping on the other half.  They tried both, and found they enjoyed this topping too!  I did bake my sweet potatoes (stuck them in with the turkey and pulled them out when they were nice and soft, then let them sit for awhile to cool off until they were a good temperature to handle--and I was ready to deal with them!)  I've never boiled sweet potatoes so I don't have an opinion about that method of preparing this dish.....so even though I didn't follow all of the steps exactly it is 5 stars in our holiday book!!  I also used Splenda for Baking in the sweet potato custard part of the recipe--several diabetics at the table-- and nobody could tell any different.

THIS IS AMAZING STUFF! In our family, we make this probably once a month and always look forward to the leftovers. We have converted anti-sweet potato people for the yumminess- probably because of all the brown sugar! I personally would like it better without all of the brown sugar, but it is just fine with all of it. It does taste like candy! Overall, though, it is a totally delicious and awesome meal that will last a while.

This was pretty good!  The only things I did differently were baking the sweet potatoes and NOT adding the white sugar to the sweet potato mixture as we like ours tasting more like vegetables and less like candy.  Thanks Tina!

Made it for the first time on Thanksgiving and it was very good.  I used less sugar b/c I didn't want a desert like dish.  Will try it in full sugar mode at another time.

Great recipe and very easy to follow!  I didn't have all the ingredients (no vanilla and pecans) and I didn't use as many eggs.  The dish still came out great!  You really can't go wrong with butter and sugar...

This was a little too sweet for my tastes, but still very good.  Next time I'll alter the recipe for my liking.  Everyone else loved it, it's like dessert!

Yummy Sweet Potato recipe is correct and easy to do when you bake or microwave the sweet potatoes. Micro waving took little time and makes the job of testing the potatoes a breeze. I'll be making this again next Thanksgiving!

I loved this recipe!!!!!!  And so did *everyone* that partook of it!  Even people who were adamant that they didn't like sweet potatoes!  I didn't take the recommendation of baking the potatoes in the oven - because I didn't have the oven time to spare (Thanksgiving is a busy day for my little old oven!) - so I just boiled the potatoes - but they were still amazing!  I made 1.5 of the recipe for the sweet potato part (I used 3 large sweet potatoes to get 6 cups cubed potatoes), and 3 recipes of the pecan topping.  WHOA.  That's just some good stuff.

I made this for Thanksgiving with the addition of some cinnamon and nutmeg.  I also added some extra sugar.  I would start with the 1/2 cup suggested and adjust to your taste as the sweetness of the potatoes will vary.  Everyone enjoyed it, even the people that don't care for sweet potatoes said it was good.

Made this the day before Thanksgiving. Substituted 1/4 cup orange juice for milk, used brown sugar instead of white in the yam mixture.  YUMMY!!  Husband loved it and so did I. Will definitely make every Thanksgiving from now on.

Amazing!!!! I used condensed milk and extra vanilla - not sure either were necessary. This recipe will be my staple sweet potato dish. Not that I dislike the marshmallow topped sweet potato dish, but this one adds that extra flair. I would proudly take this dish to a holiday pot luck!

I'm usually not a fan of sweet potatoes but it's a Thanksgiving staple so I made this and really like it!  I made a heart design out of marshmallows on top to please those who like that topping and finished with the pecan toppings along the edges of the dish.

Made this Thanksgiving.  Baked the potatoes like someone else suggested and then followed the recipe from there.  It was very tasty and those people who tried it loved it.  Will make again.  Thanks for sharing!!

My friend and I both made this recipe and I used heavy cream instead of milk and striped the top with marshmellows and pecan streusel. Mine came out incredible, and my friend said hers burned. I added the marshmellows 15 mins into cooking time. GREAT delicious recipes.

This was fabulous!!  I made it for Thanksgiving dinner and the family couldn't stop raving about it.   I followed the recipe exactly except that I baked it in a smaller, deeper oval dish.  I made prep easier by mashing the sweep potatoes the day before and just heating them up in the micro.

A friend of mine usually makes the sweet potato casserole with marshmallows-but for our taste it is always way too sweet--covering the delicious taste of the sweet potatoes.  I found this recipe and simply altered the sugar in the sweet potatoes, cutting it back to only a 1/4 cup.  I also suggest doubling the topping to make it nice and crunchy!  I didn't have pecans on hand, but did have carmelized walnuts--DH loved it.

Made this for the first time today to bring to the in-laws for Thanksgiving. Got sooo many compliments - it was awesome!  I like others baked the sweet potatoes in the oven - decreased the white sugar by half -  but next time I think I'll use even less sugar.  I Doubled the vanilla extract and doubled the topping. Thank you for sharing this recipe its a keeper

Great! I don't like my swt potato casserole's too sweet, so I used a little less than 1/2 the amount of white sugar the recipe called for (less than 1/4 c) and doubled the Vanilla Extract (1 tsp). Also, used less of the brown sugar crumble topping but made sure I included all the pecans.

What a GREAT casserole!  Tried it out on our church congregation at our annual Thanksgiving dinner and came home with an empty pan!  The only variations I made were to use 1/4 cup brown sugar & 1/4 cup white sugar with the sweet potato mixture, I doubled the recipe, and baked it in a deep 9"  x  13" pan for 60 minutes.  I have NEVER made sweet potato anything for Thanksgiving dinner as I don't care for sweet potatoes, but this has changed my thinking!  Will be making it for our family Thanksgiving Day dinner this year....Thanks for a wonderful recipe, Tina!

Good base recipe. Substituted splenda for white sugar, baked the sweet potatoes, and used an 8x8 pan. Next time will cut back on the sugar and butter. Will also omit one of the eggs to reduce the "eggy" taste and keep more of the sweet potato flavor.

This casserole is excellent!  I have such a big family, at Thanksgiving I usually have to quadruple the recipe and make it in a lasagna pan......!     The only thing I do different is using walnuts and granulated sugar in the topping instead of pecans and brown sugar and it was still phenomenal.. although I may try the pecans. Also, like other reviews have said, baking the sweet potatoes makes it ten times tastier than boiling..and it is so much easier.

This was very good.  I think it tastes better left over.  I didn't add the butter to the potatoes to cut out some of the fat and didn't even miss it!

Really good. I don't regret cutting the sugar in half. I peeled and sliced two sweet potatos and boiled until tender. Then entire family enjoyed. The kids thought it was dessert.

I made this at Thanksgiving and forgot to review it until I ran across it again just now.  My MIL always makes the marshmallow-covered version, but I was cooking for my parents and wanted to try something else.  Well, it was a big hit.  The only change I made was to ease up a bit on the sugar and add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture.  It was so good, we even ate up all the leftovers!

Very good compliment to any holiday meal. A wonderful and rich way to fix sweet potatoes. I did make the following change: added only 1/4 cups of milk and then added 1/4 cup of coconut milk. You could also substitute milk for cream de coconut. This recipe is very similar to the Sweet Potato Souffle I recipe found on this site. Thanks.

amazing. my third time making this...

I attempted to double this and used 6 good sized sweet potatoes, which I baked at 350 for about an hour and half. I did NOT double the sugar (used 1/2 cup of light brown sugar) and i used evaporated milk instead of regular. I think it was still too sweet for a side dish. I put the topping on and baked at 325 for 45 minutes because i doubled it. It could be in for longer though. Another note, the butter in the casserole mixture can be cut down... very yummy though! everyone at my party always says it's so delicious... and i come from a family that didn't grow up with sweet potatoes and they aren't used to it... so that's saying something!

Made a double batch of this for Thanksgiving this year and everyone loved it! They wouldn't let me leave without giving up the recipe!! Even people that didn't like sweet potatoes commented on how good it was!! There was nothing left at the end of dinner! MAKE THIS!! (I made it just as the recipe stated with no substitutions)

This is AWESOME and I think we'll use it every year from here on out!  We followed the original directions for the most part, but did take some advice from other reviewers.  We used 6 fairly large yams, and baked them at 350 for about 3 hours, then removed the skins and mashed them up.  We used only 2 T butter, and I honestly think you could get away without using any at all.  We did increase the vanilla to 1 t and also added 1 t cinnamon, 1/4 t cloves, and 1/4 t nutmeg.  We had to use marshmallows on top because we have nut allergies in our family :( but I was able to have the potato part all baked up and ready to go the day before - just added marshmallows and heated it through right before serving.  Great recipe!!

This was sooooo YUMMY!!!  My family loves sweet potatoes and this was by far the best yet.  This one will replace the one I've been making for years (which was also very good).  Don't substitute with yams, it's not the same.  I tried that one year and the flavor wasn't as good.  I added 2 T. of vanilla and that does make it better!

I rarely eat sweet potatoes, but I loved this.  It was very sweet.  Next time I may use yams so not so sweet.  My dinner guests raved about it.  The topping is so good! I was asked for the recipe.

I made this recipe exactly as written, and it was great!  Even my husband (who doesn't like sweet potatoes) said it was excellent.  The only change I made was to make it in a 9X9 pan.  With the amount of sweet potatoes in the recipe, it seemed to me like it would have been spread too thin if I'd put it in a 13X9 pan.  I baked it for an extra 15 minutes, just to make sure the center was done.  Thank you for a great recipe that I'll be making every Thanksgiving (and probably throughout the year, lol) from now on!

I prepared this for the first time for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!  Even my granddaughter who said she doesn't eat sweet potatoes loved it.  I made a few minor changes.  I baked 5 large sweet potatoes -- it may have been more than the sweet potato measure required but it worked -- the baked sweet has a rich flavor.  I used 1/4 cup skim milk and 1/4 cup fat free half and half.  I increased the vanilla to 1 tsp and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg.  When mixing the sweet potato mixture I used my hand mixer as it pulls out some of the "strings".  I think you get away with only 1/4 cup of sugar and I think it would still taste great -- I plan to try this next time (and there will be a next time).  I used the topping exactly as specified in the recipe.  I'm glad I did not double this as suggested by others as I thought it was perfect as recommended -- more would have made this too sweet for me.  Thank you for this wonderful recipe.

This recipe was amazingly easy and so very tasty!!! I made it to take to thanksgiving dinner, sampled it, and was completely amazed!!! only thing i would change about this recipe is I baked my sweet potatoes at 400 degrees for 1 hour... saves time of peeling and cubing because once you bake them the skins peel away very easily.. otherwise left the recipe as written...
THANKS.. this is definately my new favorite side dish that will remain a keeper

I was looking for a sweet potato side dish to make for Thanksgiving, and I'm happy I made this!! I followed other reviewers' suggestions and baked 3 sweet potatoes for an hour and a half, and used brown sugar instead of white. I also doubled the topping mixture since it looked kind of sparse (except for the chopped pecans, which I kept at 1/2 cup). I couldn't stop eating it out of the baking dish, it was just that good!! :)

I made this for the 1st time this past Thanksgiving and my son begged me to make it again and again many times before Christmas.  He ate the leftovers in a bowl by themselves.  It was sweet and creamy.  I made it exactly how the recipe says and it turned out great. It is a keeper in our house.  Thanks for the recipe!!

I make this every year for the holidays and my family loves it. I always go home with an empty pan. I was afraid they would not like a change from the traditional yams but they latched on to this one. I also took it to the most recent dog show I was at for our potluck dinner and it was a huge hit there as well. Although it ended up on the dessert table and it was sweet enough no one thought twice.

I have never been able to recreate my mother's famous (in our family) candied sweet potatoes so I decided to try a sweet potato casserole this Christmas.  This was a tasty dish, not too sweet but the suggested size of the casserole dish was too large so it turned out not to be deep enough. Especially for the amount of pecans called for. Will definitely use this recipe again but will make a couple of adjustments. I enjoy cooking and trying new recipes. allrecipes has become my favorite recipe site because I've found that it has the best tried and true recipes from real home cooks like me. Thanks.

My family usually goes for Sweet Potatoes with marshmellos on top, but this was a welcomed change in tradition.  I prefer a crunchy topping.  I used half and half and it was quite creamy texture.

This is so good it's a sin!  It's like candy!  My husband and I could not stop eating it!  Also, my husband was in NY on business and paid $16 for a small side of "sweet potatoe casserole" and he said it didn't even rival this!  This is a keeper!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving. It was pretty good, I did cut down the sugar though and still thought it could be cut down a little more. I used real baked sweet potoatoes and that was very good. I actually made 2 batches of it, the first turned out a little dry. So I added a little more liquid to the second batch and it was much creamier and much better.

I, too, took a chance on this recipe after reading the rave reviews, and I felt compelled to write a review because it's as great as it sounds!!  I was worried it would be too sweet for my family, but EVERYONE loved it at Thanksgiving and I'm making it again for Christmas!  Thank you for the great recipe!

I just served this dish to a bunch of Australians who had never had sweet potatoes in a casserole before and they loved it! I baked the potatoes for 1 1/2 hours and they were the perfect consistency. For those looking for a less sugary version, I just mixed a little milk in with the potatoes. Sweet potatoes are already so sweet, you really don't need to add much to them. I doubled the topping and covered the entire thing with it. Delicious!

This was SO good, unfortunately, my family hasn't really learned to appreciate sweet potatoes (except for Mom and me!)  I loved it and Mom did too, she couldn't get over how good the topping was!  Even better the next day!

Everyone loved this Yummy casserole!  I followed the suggestions of several reviewers and used half the sugar for the sweet potato part. (I used all the brown sugar called for in the topping though.) This is a great recipe--thank you!

I wait all year long for November, then I make this dish every chance I get through the first of the year.  I only change one ingredient, I use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and typically cover the top with whole or halved pecans. If you are going to do it, do it right!

I did not make this myself but one of my friends brought it to the American Women's Club Thanksgiving Lunch. It was delicious and quite a blast of "home"! I am delighted to have the recipe.

This is the 3rd year in a row I have made this and it is AWESOME. It takes just about the same as the Honey Baked Ham store version.

This one got such rave reviews from everyone at Thanksgiving that now I have to make it for Christmas!!  It was easy to make and SOOOOO good! I usually don't like sweet potatoes. I only make them for everyone else, but this was WONDERFUL!!  I can't wait to make it again!!

This is my new tradition!  Delicious!  I would highly recommend baking the sweet potatoes.  This adds a nice rich roasted flavor, plus saves time peeling them because you bake them with the skins on.  My medium sized potatoes cooked at 375 degrees for 50 minutes and were soft. You can easily scrape the potato away from the skin.  I doubled the topping, but it got soggy.  I will NOT do that again!  The topping amount called for in the original recipe would be better.

I don't even like sweet potatoes, but these are wonderful! With our leftovers we made sweet potatoe burrito's, I know sound crazy but they were great. Costco has uncooked tortillas, just heat on the skillet, fill and roll!

This casserole is absolutely delicious! It is sweet so adjust the sugar according your personal preference. My husband suggested that next time I reduce the topping in half  and add marshmallows.

This is really tasty! The topping DEFINITELY makes this dish. This is sweet without being cloying, like the dishes made with canned sweet potatoes and marshmallows. I'm constantly looking for new sweet potato recipes (the turkey and stuffing are set in stone, so it's one of the few dishes I can play with), and I will be keeping this recipe!

Absolutely the best and easiest sweet potato casserole ever! It was a super hit at our Thanksgiving dinner. I like that it isn't quite as sweet as when you use canned yams or with the marshmallows. A new traditional favorite for us!

For Thanksgiving, I didn't have any marshmallows for my sweet potatoes, so I decided to try this recipe instead. Wow, was it a hit!! My brother-in-law almost sent me home when he didn't see any marshmallows. Ha! But once he tried it, he was hooked and wanted the recipe himself. Excellent dish!

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a hit.  I doubled the pecans and felt it was just barely enough topping to cover ad 9 x 13. I added cinnamon, but think I will also add nutmeg next time.  We normally eat our potatoes sweeter than this, but the topping makes it so yummy!

I made this last year and I'm trying to decide whether or not to make it again this year.  It is delicious - the only problem is it is oh so sweet - too sweet.  Maybe I'll try halfing the sugar or something as mentioned.

I've made this recipe a few times, and my family loves it, especially my brother. I think he would eat the whole thing himself. I made it again for Easter and everyone loved it. Even my Uncle who doesn't like sweet potatoes but loves pecans. He thought it was delicious. Thanks for the great recipe.

I didn't really care for sweet potatoes before I made this. Now my opinion of them has changed. Lovely dish!

This came out great!! I used canned yams and made the recipe as if they were fresh sweet potatoes and it still came out great. I was a little more generous though with the brown sugar and pecans, but that's just to taste. Altogether a great recipe!!

This was great!  I made with yams instead.  Less sweet than traditional "candied version".  I would use smaller pieces of pecans next time.

GREAT!  I used half the sugar with the sweet potatoes and it was perfect.  I also used a few more pecans on top.  I'll never see a marshmallow w/my sweet potatoes ever again.

I also had never tried this recipe before & made it for Thanksgiving.  Everyone loved it!  I will be making this one for all major holidays (and maybe in between them as well)!

Not only did I bake the potatoes in foil (be sure to put a pan on the rack below the one with the potatoes because the juices will ooze & make a mess of your oven), but I also toasted the pecans with cinnamon & sugar before I chopped them.

My finished product looked NOTHING like this picture though.  I made sure the butter was at room temperature when I mixed it with the flour, sugar & coarsely grounded pecans.  Using soft butter made it much easier to evenly distribute the topping mixture across the ENTIRE top of the sweet potatoes.

Definitely a "five-starer".  This recipe was delicious.  The fresh sweet potatoes gave it a brillant color and the pecan topping was to die for. I also melted some marshmellows on top.

I made this for the 1st time on Thanksgiving...What a huge hit...my mom even liked this better than the candy yams she usually makes...my boyfriend loved this and I will definitely be making this again.  Easy to make also...I excluded the pecans and just made a brown sugar topping - WONDERFUL!

This was wonderful! My kids have lost all my measuring spoons/cups in their toy box so I had to eye ball all the measurments and i don't think it could have come out any better!! At first I was worried about the amount of topping but once we started eating it was just the right amount for a little bit in each bite. I don't peel my potatoes before i boil them,, i boil them whole in a large pot and when they are done, I just pull the skin off with my fingers,, very easy!

This was a HUGE hit at Thanksgiving. So much so, I am thinking of making it year-round. Don't like pecans? Me either. I made the recipe without them, and it was still the hit of the holiday! The key to this recipe is that it's just sweet enough. It still tastes really natural. It doesn't have that fake marshmallow taste - delicious and worth cooking.

Yowza! That's good stuff! I didn't have a single issue with this recipe and am so glad I took it to Thanksgiving! I was asked for the recipe over and over again! I pan roasted my sweet potatoes and mashed them until smooth...no boiling. Other than that followed the recipe to a T!

This got rave reviews at Thanksgiving BUT silly me....I actually used SWEET POTATOES and not yams....so the color was all wrong and it was very sweet.  It was kind of yellow not orange.  But still tasted awesome.

This recipe was wonderful, however I did take a few suggestions and added some of my own.  I ommitted the white sugar (It's plenty sweet without it) and baked the potatoes as others suggested.  I used brown sugar and pecans on top, and added some granola for crunch.  Everyone raved about the recipe.  With the leftover's I filled a pie crust and topped with additional granola..........it was awesome.

This was everyone's favorite dish this Thanksgiving. Truly delicious! Following some advice from other reviewers I cut the sugar to 1/3 cup (both white and brown) and baked the sweet potatoes for full flavor. I also added a half teaspoon of cinnamon, a pinch of allspice and a big pinch of chipotle pepper powder - which sounds strange but added a smoky zing and enhanced the earthy flavor. I'll definitely be making this for all holiday parties! The topping reminds me of coffee cake.

I have used this as our "go to" sweet potato recipe for several years now.  I make it according to the directions except for 3 changes:  I bake the potatos instead of boiling, I add a small amount of fresh orange zest and I bake it in an 8 x 11 dish. I have refrigerated the sweet potato mixture overnight and added the topping the next day before baking, came out just the same.

This is very good.  I can't get pecans where I live, so I substituted hazelnuts, and it was  great.  I also halved the recipe and used a small baking dish just because I wanted to try the Sweet Potato Puffs, also on this site, and it worked just fine that way.

This got rave reviews from the family!  My topping did not melt into the potatoes as shown in the diagram.  I left the potatoes a little "lumpy" to add texture. No complaints.  My husband has called dibbs on the leftovers.

This was a hit for Thanksgiving.  People loved it.  I didn't use sweet potatoes because they are so dry and I didn't want to risk it not turning out.  I used 4 large yams instead.  Then to compensate for the sweetness of the yams I only added a little under 1/4 of sugar.  This was just right, we could still taste the potatoes and the topping more than made sweet spots.  I also used a small casserole bowl to bake in because I wanted to save space, so cooked extra to be sure the middle got hot.

I loved this dish.  I normally am not a fan of sweet potatoes.  I didn't have pecans, so I substituted macadamia nuts.  I also used an 8x8 dish, seemed to turn out fine.

I used canned sweet potatoes, and maybe that's why this recipe turned out a little bit runny.  However, the taste was great and the topping was superb!  The topping turned out beautifully, kind of like a hard candy shell.  It went over pretty well, and some people put whipped topping on it and ate it as a desert.

I used three medium sized sweet potatoes, used only 1/4 cup of milk and 1 egg, a little more vanilla than called for, substituted cashews for the pecans, and baked this in an 8 X 8 square pan.  It came out perfect!

This tasted nice, but was mushy.  I think I over-cooked the potatoes.  Also, for some reason it never got brown on top.  I love sweet potatoes in any shape or form, however, so I didn't mind too much.

I LOVE THESE SWEET POTATOES!!I made this recipe this Thanksgiving. It is quite easy and I used fresh Yams, I would suggest using canned if you want an easier recipe. My family loved them, my kids loved them and my husband, who hates sweet potatoes, loved them. Will reccomend to anyone.

I have been making this for years with a few changes. I don't add the white sugar - they're sweet enough! I cook the potatoes in the microwave, cool a bit then scoop out the insides. Then, I add the butter before the eggs to avoid scrambled eggs. The rest is pretty much the same and it's delicious! I forgot to say I don't add any milk, but I do add about 1/2 tsp ea of cinnamon and nutmeg.

I made this for Christmas and followed the recipe exactly and it was perfect! Everyone absolutely loved it. There is no reason to change anything about it. I plan on making it for every holiday and maybe even in between as a special treat.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Made this Thanksgiving and Christmas - a hit for both! Really great flavor and spices, and not too sweet. I just baked the potatoes and pulled skin off after. The crumble topping is the best!  Will be our staple sweet potato dish from now on!

Easy peasy and delicious! A holiday staple around this house! If you're unsure how to "cut" the butter into the topping, just melt it in the microwave, mix the brown sugar and flour thoroughly in a bowl, and slowly drizzle the butter in as you toss the sugar mixture around it with a fork.

Very good recipe -- a tad sweet for my taste, but popular with holiday guests. But the editor's note confuses me. Triple the casserole ingredients while leaving the topping ingredients the same? So it then serves 36?  I ignored the note, but I wonder what was really meant.

YUM! This is my go-to dish for the holidays. Simply perfect. I love the crunch of the pecans on the top mixed the crumbly brown sugar and butter. I make a 24 serving size and it fits just fine in the 9 x 13 dish. People at gatherings always comment on how well it goes with the rest of the holiday dinner. You really should try this.

I really love sweet potatoes, so I'm sure I'm going to enjoy this dish. I altered the recipe just slightly though. I added a small can of pumpkin and I also mixed the pecans in melted butter to coat them before putting them in the brown sugar and flour mixture.

I guess I am confused as to how this recipe supposed to taste as well  as the consistency. I used this recipe for Thanksgiving this year and this was my first  time making this recipe and making a even making a sweet potato casserole. I followed the recipe as follows, but I added maple extract to it. My casserole felt more  like a massed sweet potato. I  did make this casserole at someone else's house and I am more comfortable in my own kitchen.  I am going to try  this recipe again and see what I can improve on. I  got good comments, but I do not take people words at heart, I  go by what I feel.

Followed it just as laid out, however added a bit more milk because I used more potatoes. This is an amazing and not difficult recipe. It was the rage of today's brunch with many guests sampling. Thanks :)

This was really good. I reduced the sugar for my preference and added a little more pecans for the looks but don’t feel these changed the recipe enough to not give it 5 stars.

First time making it. I mainly followed the recipe except for using extra sweet potatoes and extra vanilla. It was delicious. I've used a different recipe every year for sweet potato casserole and I think this one was the favorite so far. I might try adding some cinnamon/nutmeg/pie spice next time but ti was great without any of that.

I've made this several times, for holidays & will no doubt make it many more times.  It's more like a dessert then a veggie.  My daughter was cooking for her in-laws and I asked her if she wanted this recipe and she said that they already had the desserts covered, ha ha ha.

So good! I used 5 sweet potatoes and baked them for about an hour. Mixed the sweet potatoes and other ingredients with a mixer. Increased the topping ingredients by about 50%.

What a hit!!  Made this for Friendsgiving this year. Not a spoonful left darn it..... I was hoping for leftovers!  Super creamy. Recommend baking vice boiling your sweet potatoes (I think they retain more natural sugar); decreased the white sugar by half; doubled the vanilla; added a teaspoon of pumpkin pie spice. Have added this recipe to my favs.

THE BEST!!! I made a couple of alterations based on other reviews. I used baked sweet potatoes, cut the sugar to 1/4 c., used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, doubled the vanilla, and added cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture. I also made double the topping (but I only used about 3/4 of it). My whole family raved about it! 90-year-old grandma complimented, which is a BIG DEAL, and my mother, who has never liked sweet potatoes at all, just called me to tell me how amazing they are (she’s eating my leftovers). This will be my go-to recipe from now on!

although my sister calls it a sweet potato pie instead of a casserole.

This was the best I've ever had and it doubled as a dessert the next day!! I already had canned yams so I used that instead of fresh, otherwise no changes. Will make again. Thank you!

I topped the casserole with mini marshmallows instead of the pecan topping due to tree-but allergies, and it turned out great!  Whereas some sweet potato casseroles tend to be overly sweet, this one had the perfect balance between sweet and savory.

Since I'm basicly lazy, I swapped out the fresh potatoes for two large cans of well drained Bruce's yams and it still turned out delicious. This will be my go to for holiday sweet potatoes.

I do not like sweet potatoes but this casserole has changed my mind!! This was delicious! I used evaporated milk in place of regular milk and cut the sugar amount in half and used brown sugar instead of white. I also doubled the topping as suggested by others. I have been asked by many family members to please make this every Thanksgiving.

This is an amazing and easy recipe! I had lost a favorite recipe similar to this and was grateful to find this. I doubled the topping simply because my family loves the topping and I always feel it doesn't cover the. top as completely as I like. I think I will do this. again in the future as it gave a taste of the delicious topping in every bite.

I made this for Thanksgiving and my husband, who is not a fan of sweet potatoes and reluctant to try it, has not stopped raving about it.  He even took some to work the following day. I highly recommend this recipe and will continue to use it on the Christmas and Thanksgiving table for sure- if not more often throughout the winter months!

Finally found a recipe that tastes like my mom’s!  I got in a hurry and forgot the cook the potatoes first, so I softened the butter before mixing and it still turned out great! I will be saving this one for sure.

I sometimes use canned sweet potatoes (drain them first) and add old-fashioned oats to the topping mixture for more texture and this dish still turns out great.  Excellent dish for people who like (but don't love) sweet potatoes.  I'm a convert and so is my family!

Excellent recipe!  I have made it for two Thanksgiving holidays and received compliments .  Followed the recipe with some of the modifications suggested by others including baking the sweet potatoes, using a little less white sugar and adding cinnamon, nutmeg and ground cloves.  Used a casserole dish instead of a 9 X 13 pan.  Highly recommend giving this recipe a try!

I made my first casserole! And followed the recipe as well. It wasn’t too sweet or bland tasting. The flavor was right where I wanted it to be. I didn’t want it to taste like pure sugar. Only thing I did different was, instead of chopping the peanuts, I used a food processor to chop up the peanuts, and make them a little finer. That way it served as more of a crust, layered on top.

My family enjoyed this so much it was all they talked about for two days. I ended up making 1/2 more than the recipe and followed mostly but not entirely. I didn’t add any additional egg and the topping had a little less butter than it initially called for. I added marshmallows because my husband said it was blasphemous not to and it added a fun crunch once it was baked. I really enjoyed this recipe and didn’t think boiling the sweet potatoes took away from the flavor. I’ll be making this again soon.

YUM! I am so picky about sweet potato pie and this one is almost exactly what I was looking for.  I used heavy cream instead of milk, double the vanilla and double salt.  Perfect!  Every year I’ve looked for this flavor and have came close and finally perfected the recipe thanks to this one.  I’ve been wanting to incorporate maple somehow but haven’t found what I looking for.  Maybe a maple whipped cream topping? Open to suggestions please!

I made this recipe once before and it was good . But my second attempt was off da chain!!! Here are the changes I made to the recipe: 1. I baked the sweet potatoes. 2. I accidentally added the vanilla extract to the TOPPING mixture. So I then had to add the required amount to the filling mixture as well. This gave it a fantastic taste - having vanilla in both mixtures. 3. I made slightly bit more of the topping mixture. 4. I beat the filling mixture in the mixer and made it very smooth, as opposed to mixing by hand. 5. I used VERY good organic eggs. 6. I made it 2 days ahead of time. To die for!!!

My nephew is crazy about sweet potatoes. Usually, I use canned potatoes and they turn out ok, but this year I decided to treat him good and made them from real sweet potatoes. I bought about 8 potatoes and I used an instant pot to cook them it took me about 30 minutes for a full pot. I let it sit to self release and they were fork tender when I checked them. If not put them in longer. The skin literally fell off and I left them in a strainer to drain a bit before mashing them with a stick of butter.  

Here’s what I do to ensure it will be good. I do not add the eggs until I’m happy with my potato mixture! Even when I mean to double this recipe I ONLY add ONE set of measurements first and taste as I go. I usually  add the brown sugar, salt, vanilla extract, evaporated milk, I taste it after. 

 I usually  only end up actually doubling the vanilla and evaporated milk. I add a pinch of salt and about 1/4 cup packed brown sugar and taste. I will add a small amount of white sugar ONLY if it needs to be sweetened. I add allspice, cinnamon, and a little hint of fresh grated nutmeg. I do this to my taste. Then I mix in my eggs last. I usually do 3 for a doubled recipe, but 4 would be fine too. At this point I take a small spoonful and zap it in the microwave to taste. Usually it’s good, but sometimes I add more spices or a hint of extract.  

I do not like overly sweet potatoes, but I need to trick my nephew so for the topping I mix 1/4 cup brown sugar with graham cracker crumbs and

One of our kids doesnt like to eat any nuts so we still made the brown sugar topping but without the nuts. Then baked it for 15 minutes, put on some marshmallows, then popped it back in for the remaining 15. I think it turned out pretty good

Delicious! I used one 15 oz can of yams, making it for just two at Thanksgiving. I halved the ingredients, and because I had to save on time. I added unsweetened finely shredded coconut and cut up gluten free marshmallows,and replaced the flour with finely ground almond flour to make it gluten free. Ran out of brown sugar,and replaced it with organic coconut sugar which is similar to brown sugar. I raised the heat up to 450 degrees during the last 8 minutes of baking to get the marshmallows brown and toasted.The dish I made was devoured by myself and husband. Next time,I will not halve the recipe,but double the ingredients to enjoy as leftovers. So yummy! Never will I make plain old candied yams for Thanksgiving or Christmas again.

I folded in 3/4 cup mini marshmallows to the potato mixture before adding to the 9x13" dish, and decorated the top edge with more marshmallows. 

I had to add a bit more flour to the topping  mixture because it was not as crumbly as I expected. Maybe I mixed it too well. 

Thanks for the quick recipe! This is going to be delicious!

Delish!! As others have suggested I baked the potatoes with the skin before really getting into the recipe. I otherwise followed directions.... actually I used 6 large potatoes instead of 4. I think the amount of sugar suggested is a bit much but with my additional potatoes it balanced out nicely.

I've been making this same dish for 4 or 5 years now with a couple of minor adjustments. I start by baking my sweet potatoes the night before, mash the potatoes with a fork after peeling them (which is much easier after they have been baked), and then double the topping as that's the best part of this dish. My son told me that I can't ever go back to my old way of making sweet potatoes for holidays because this dish is the best!

This is so delicious! But I personalized it my preference by amping up the  seasonings with 1 1/2 tsp good vanilla, 1 tsp ground cinnamon & 1/4 tsp ground cloves to the sweet potato purée. I also add 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp fresh ground nutmeg & 1/2 c coconut to the topping. We love it so much!

I do have one suggestion instead of peeling sweet potatoes I just buy four cans of sweet potatoes and drain off the liquid..I saves time and it's so convenient.

This is truly the best sweet potato dish! It’s creamy and has the perfect amount of sweetness. Although, I do reduce the  white sugar by 1/8 of a cup. I put extra pecans in the praline too.

Please don't make the mistake of using canned sweet potatoes - it is not nearly as good.  No need to peel and cube the sweet potatoes.  Leave them in the skin, cut the ends off, cut them in half and boil until fork tender.  The skin will slip right off.  This is the very best sweet potato recipe EVER!

I have made a similar recipe growing up with my family. We scrub the potatoes and oil them before poking holes in the potatoes with a fork and baking the potatoes at 450 for 50 minutes. They have a more butter like flavor to them this way. Let the cooked potatoes cool completely before peeling or you will regret it. They will be much more firm and easier to peel. I allow myself about two days to make this recipe, with baking the potatoes and prepping the potatoes so on the day of it is easy to assemble and put in the oven. 

Best to either bake your potatoes or use the canned. NEVER BOIL! Milk or evaporated milk, it depends on your sweet tooth. This recipe is very sweet and will rival your pecan pies on the dessert table. Enjoy!!! :D

I made this for a church Thanksgiving dinner for the first time.  I made it how the recipe says. and I also made a 2nd one but with marshmallow instead of pecans. just incase someone  couldn't have nuts. and I had a million comments. they all said it was delicious.  I always made it different. I used to cut potatoes in cubes and bake them like that. I never mashed them. but this is my new way to make it  I love it. thank you for this recipe

This is my go to Thanksgiving sweet potato recipe. Everyone loves it. Only changed I make is doubling the topping and halving the white sugar in the potatoes. Thanks for this recipe.

This is the "classic" sweet potatoes dish. This dish is too dessert-like for my personal holiday sides - so I don't do it. However I knew this would hit the spot  for the annual Thanksgiving pot luck. This recipe is exactly what you expect:  super-sweet, light, creamy whipped potatoes with a decadent crunchy pecan topping. You can't go wrong with this dish in the Deep South.

This was just ok.  I followed the recipe but also added cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg as others suggested.  It was a little dry in my opinion. It would have been really bland without the extra spices.

Made this for an early Thanksgiving Dinner today.  It was a hit with everyone!  I added just a touch of cinnamon when I was mashing up the potatoes. Will be making these again and again.

Delicious and super easy to make. I loved that there was a brown sugar topping. Normally sweet potatoes like this are over powering with sugar, this one was not.  I wasn't sure which butter to put into which step so I guessed. I figured it all ended up in there sooo..

Everyone who attempted to try it liked this. I made mine with candied pecans on top which made it almost seem like a dessert. Very nice comfort food.

I tried it without pecans and with marshmallow topping instead, honestly just because I was out of any nut toppings. It’s definitely not the same without the nut topping. And accidentally went over the amount of all purpose flour so top layer wasn’t so crisp either. So will make it again, with either almond slices or half pecans and being more careful with the measuring cup on that flour.

One user: used 3 BAKED sweet potatoes (I often double the recipe). For a single recipe I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup and I double the vanilla up to 1 tsp. I use evaporated milk instead of regular milk. I add 1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of both ground clove and ground nutmeg. For the topping, I double the recipe even on the single recipe.

I plan on making this for Thanksgiving but I was considering using both mashed sweet potatoes (after roasting) and folding in roasted cubes also. Do you think that would be okay? I love love love roasted cubed sweet potatoes and thought it might lend some yummy texture. Thanks in advance!

Made it x2 so far, LOVE IT!  100% for those with a SWEET tooth.  I don’t add pecans to the crumble.  At 28 min cooking, I take it out, cover the entire surface in mini marshmallows and then set it to BROIL for like 2 min.  DELICIOUS !!

I made this yesterday for Sunday family dinner and it was delicious!  The only change I made was by accident - I added the 1/2 cup brown sugar into the sweet potato mix, but it did not come out too sweet - just perfect! :)

I have been asked to bring this dish to holiday gatherings since I first made it. However, I think it is bland as is. I have since added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg and increased the pecan topping. I also bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. I think this adds more flavor.

Family loved it.  I am the only one who likes pecans so I left them out and only sprinkled them over a couple of servings.  Like dessert.

We can't have nuts in our house! So we left them off and at the very end (maybe last five minutes), we tossed on mini marshmallows. Very yummy! Also, because of someone else's review, I used evaporated milk rather than regular milk. I'm sure that made a difference, too. Oh, I also took advantage of the advice to roast the potatoes. Very easy to scoop out the potatoes from the skins. Skip the peeling and chopping and boiling!

Loved this recipe and everyone in my family did too! I didn’t change a thing except added a bit more brown sugar and nuts where the top wasn’t covered. This recipe made a lot and it was all gone!

Yummy is right!  I have been making this for the last three years or so for almost every holiday.  I do use canned yams as there are only two of us and it is easier.  I am sure it would be even better with baked sweet potatoes, however.

I make this every year for Thanksgiving. I always bake my sweet potatoes first, it gives a more complex flavor and then I can get away with adding less sugar. I also add extra cinnamon and nutmeg.  There are never any leftovers!

Absolutely amazing! Bake sweet potatoes for 1.5 -2 hours. It adds more flavor and will make  seperating the peel from inside of potato much easier :)

I made this with the recommended changes.  It was way too much for my family.  I froze a lot of it and will say it froze and thawed/ tasted well reheated. I will not be making this again.

This has become a family favourite and is requested every gathering we attend. It’s supper easy and we love it. I’d say the only change I make is I half the sugar cause I love sweet potatoes “as is” but my hubby prefers sweeter, so we compromise at half the sugar

Turned out great. I put less sugar than the original recipe after reading some reviews. Next time I will add more nuts, flour and brown sugar. I used 6 medium to large size sweet potatoes so I could have used more topping. Overall I received many compliments.

This dish was great. I baked the sweet potatoes in aluminum foil, instead of boiling them. Before taking the completed dish out of the oven,  I turned the heat up and broiled a few minutes so the pecan mixture was toasty and brown. Perfect! Next time, I will double the recipe!                                            Thanks for sharing!

Amazing and delicious! Very easy!  I added marshmallows on half for those that enjoy it... so good!  (They were special pumpkin spice marshmallows- never saw those before so had to try...). Winner!  I also used the canned canned yams already cooked and cut- two large to make the recipe for 6 people.  It was quick

I made this for Christmas Dinner as others had recommended I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.  That was the only change I made other than that the recipe was easy to follow and my family loved it. I will definitely make it again and highly recommend this recipe.

Delish!!!!!!  Made for Thanksgiving and it was a hit!   I followed some helpful tips like using light brown sugar instead of white and baking the sweet potatoes rather than boiling.  I also added a large can of Bruce's Yams to increase the portion and it was sooooo good!  My mom just requested I make it and bring to tonight's Christmas dinner at her house!  Highly recommend this recipe, it replaced our family's traditional baked candy yams with marshmallows dish.

I gave it 4 stars because I decided to make a few changes according to other reviews and my own additions. 
I baked the sweet potatoes. I used a 1/4 cup of the White sugar. I added 1/4 tsp of cinnamon in the sweet potato mixture. I used evaporated milk instead. Instead of regular pecans, I used Candied pecans from Trader Joe’s. (I’m sure any brand would work but I think there’s are the best.) The candied pecans I think made this dish incredibly good! They are whole instead of chopped. I had a party and served this. Everyone raved about it. This is going in my favorite recipes box! Thank you for this recipe and everyone who offered little tips  to tweak it.

Very good .made exactly as recipe. very good taste  mine was a little dry but i think it was because of the kind of potato used and their condition, not the recipe.

Absolutely delicious! Even my daughter, who does not ordinarily like sweet potato dishes, just loved it - as did my son-in-law. It is a new family favorite!

I've made this before and it's always a hit:) I made it for the first time a few years ago and now I'm the designated "sweet potato casserole" person every Thanksgiving and Christmas. This year, I reduced the amount of white sugar by about a 1/4 cup (from 1 cup to 3/4 cup) and nobody was the wiser;)

I'd never made anything like this before, mostly because I didn't like it when I was growing up.  I think I may have confused it with candied yams.  This was really good and my family also enjoyed it.

My cousin told me it was the best sweet potato casserole he has eaten in his life! We all loved it. I did add mini marshmallows on top because we grew up with them. Everyone had seconds and maybe thirds on Thanksgiving and finished to a scraped empty dish the day after!!! Definitely a new traditional dish!! Love love love it!

I didn't see the editor's note so made it as is and it was still delicious.  I have decided that since I love pecans so much next time I will shake whole pecans in the flour topping, remove them, sprinkle the topping, and then press whole pecans all over the top to make a sort of crustiness similar to a creme brûlée.

It was tasty.  I made the changes someone suggested of cutting back on sugar to 1/4 cup and increasing the vanilla to 1tsp, using evaporated milk instead of reg milk, adding 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp each of nutmeg, and ground clover.   I've made it both ways, and both were a huge hit.  Think I prefer the original recipe myself, but my family ate it all up!

Family favorite especially at Thanksgiving. As other reviewers recommended, I doubled the crumb top but rather than use softened butter, I prefer to use melted!

Yummy is right! Made this exactly as written except did take the advice to bake not boil the sweet potatoes-good call. I also cut the sugar in half because we tend to like things less sweet. Maybe next time a little cinnamon and nutmeg but its really not necessary for an outstanding dish. Thanks for sharing Tina!

This was my first time making this, I did add 1 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg then a dash of clove and doubled the vanilla. I also added a bit more sugar. I left the topping as listed above. I premade everything the night before Thanksgiving and refrigerated it then I cooked it the next day after the turkey was ready.

I took this to a friends house as a dish to pass for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it!  I did bake the sweet potatoes in foil a couple of days ahead of time and then, on Thanksgiving Day I peeled them and mixed them together as the recipe called for. My only change was using evaporated milk for the regular milk. Soooooo yummy!! Thank you for a fabulous recipe. This is one I’ll be making again for sure.

5 big cans Bruce’s yams, 1 1/2 stick butter 2/3 cup milnot, 1 1/2 cup brown sugar. 
Boil drain yams add all other and whip well. 
Double topping mix using a little more than double butter.  You will use 90% of topping. Bake as directed. 
This is a winner.

Used brown  sugar.  Yummy. Family could not get enough.

Key is don't add too much of the praline topping. The sweet potatoes are already really sweet, and too much of the topping makes it sugar overload. But less sugar, more pecans, PERFECT!!

Way too sweet for my liking. I think I’d omit the sugar in the potatoes and just stick to the brown sugar topping!

Was a hit for Thanksgiving. I made it night before so flavors could fully set in and reheated in oven on thanksgiving day right before serving. I used evaporated milk in substitution for milk and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.

Excellent recipe.  Love this recipe.  It has a hit in my Thanksgiving dinner.   I reduced the sugar by 1/4, next time I would cut down 1/2, but it’s amazing.  This is a keeper!!

This was EXCELLENT!! A real crowd pleaser...even for those who typically don't like sweet potatoes of any kind. Everyone had rave reviews for it and will most likely be requested at future holidays. Didn't tweak the recipe much except added cinnamon in the topping and upped the vanilla to 1 tsp. Also, keep your butter cold when making the topping - that gives you the signature crumble of a streusel. Otherwise, fabulous recipe!

This  was sweet first time I made it so as others suggested I left out all the white sugar and next time I will cut the brown sugar down.  Still was way to  sweet but kids liked it.

Decided to make sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving this year, and I'm glad I chose this recipe! Per previous reviews, I roasted rather than boiled the sweet potato. I also opted to use all brown sugar instead of white sugar, and I added some nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture. Kept all measurements the same, including the topping. It was a little too sweet, will cut the sugar next time. But still pretty tasty!

Roasted the sweet potatoes instead of boiling and used heavy whipping cream instead of milk. Add some marshmallows for added yum.

I like the recipe very much. I gave it 4 stars because I feel like it could use much less sugar. Personally I’d cut the sugar in half next time. I’ll be making this again for our next holiday gathering in a couple days. I may  add raisins for some extra texture and natural sweetness. The firmness is perfect, not to mushy, fluffy and a nice table presentation. I’m sure for a family that loves the extra sugar and calories it’s a 5 star, as it is!

I added more two more sweet potatoes but left everything else the same.  I didn't want the dish to be as sweet as the original.   It was still good.

I made this a few years ago for Thanksgiving and ever since it has been the dish that I bring. Everyone always looks forward to this dish! 

I follow this recipe exactly as shown except I bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.

My first crack at it for a Friendsgiving and it was a hit. I doubled the recipe and still only had a pie-sized dishful, but was enough. I'm making it again for family Thanksgiving tomorrow.  I cut a few things out/down as suggested by others 1) cut the butter in half, 2) eliminated milk altogether and it was fine without it or any substitute, 3) used brown sugar for both instead of white, 4) doubled the Vanilla amount, and i used Tapioca flour instead of white for gluten free option. For the tapioca, i used the same as the white flour amount but it was too much - next time i will cut that in 1/3 or so.  It was fantastic!  super sweet, and Yummy as the recipe says!

I make this every year with one change.  I don’t add the white sugar to the potatoes. I find the brown sugar in the topping adds plenty of sweetness and cuts back on calories but not the flavor!!  I get requests for this all the time. Delicious!!!

I have been making this for years and it’s always a huge hit. As other reviewer’s have recommended, I significantly cut down the sugar. There’s such a natural sweetness to the sweet potato that all that sugar is unnecessary. I usually opt for about a quarter cup white or golden brown sugar. Also, I bake the potatoes as opposed to boiling and use about 5 medium sized. Excellent

Discovered this dish a few years back and it’s my go to dish for my Thanksgiving potluck at work. I swear I had random employees come up to me introducing themselves and telling how delicious my dish was. If you want to impress a crowd, this is where it’s at!

I have made this for a few years now and will be making it this year for Thanksgiving. It is so good and my family really enjoys it. No changes to the recipe except for maybe a little less sugar. Think I will bake the sweet potatoes first this year as many reviewers have suggested!

Wife & I watching THE PIONEER WOMAN with Ree Drumond. Ree used this recipe to a T. She said it was one that her family made. Guess she has to get her recipes from somewhere. What a fake.

I have made this many times. Bring it to a party and always one of the favorites by the guest. I only use 1/3 of sugar as stated in the recipe and that is more than enough.

I have made this for years, and is requested, by the family, every Thansgiving. The only difference , with my recipe, is I mix half the pecan mixture into the sweet potatoes , then sprinkle the rest on top. Totally agree in roasting the sweet potatoes , rather than boiling.

Amazing!!  You also can add marshmallows instead of streusel topping if you are in a rush. I use golden brown sugar  or dark brown sugar instead of white, I don't love it with white sugar.  I always add a little extra butter for richness to balance the sweetness.  Also I only use 1 egg, I like the texture better with one.  This recipe is a keeper and you will be asked for a copy of it every time you make it!!!

Amazing recipe! I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven first for 45 mins. at 400 degrees. Scooped out the insides of the sweet potatoes after baking and discarded the skins. Then added the sweet potatoes into the mixture and used a hand mixer to combine ingredients. Turned out very good-great comfort food recipe and makes for wonderful leftovers.

This is my favorite sweet potato casserole! I gave it 4 stars because some kiddos don't like it as much as I do. Putting marshmallows or white chocolate on this casserole is too sweet. You really do need the nuttiness on top so that it's not like a dessert.

Been making this for years now, family always ask me to bring it for TG dinner.  Only thing I do different is bake my sweet potatoes.  You lose so much flavor when  you boil them.  I prepare this couple nights before and do topping day of heat it for 30 mins and than take it with me . it retains the heat pretty well.

This is super sweet even though I cut the sugar in half. I might not add sugar to the potato mixture but just put in the topping next time. The addition of nutmeg and cloves gave it some flavor and next time I am going to try baking not boiling the potatoes .

I loved this recipe.  I made it for Easter dinner and it was yummy.  Everyone at dinner loved it.  Only one person said it was too sweet.  So depending on your taste you may want to adjust sugar in sweet potatoes since topping is already sweet.

Minor changes per the other reviewers: used evaporated milk, baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling, threw in a bit of cinnamon, upped the vanilla. I also turned on the broiler for the last 5 minutes and created a wonderful glazed topping. OMG, it was so good!!! Definitely a keeper!

By far the best Sweet Potato Casserole I have made.  Yummy is definitely the right adjective.  The only thing I did slightly different was I had approx 5 cups of mashed sweet potato and used 1 egg.  The casserole bowl was emptied!

Made it as written except I baked the sweet potatoes the day before when cooking something else. Otherwise, no changes, and it was delicious. All family member agreed. A keeper.

Very yummy addition to the holiday table. I bake the sweet potatoes first and half the amount of sugar.

Made it 3 times over the holidays and it was very good.  After the 1st time I did add marshmallows in the potatoes.  I roasted the potatoes instead of boiling.  It was easier that way.

Superb! Do not tweak. Caramelly pecans add a special touch to the beautiful sweet potato pie.  Easy to halve if you need to bake just for two or double up

We doubled the recipe and will se evaporated milk next time. I have read that baking the SP first will enhance the flavor of the SP's. This is a very sweet dish and plan on cutting down the sugar to .25 cups of brown and the same on the white.

I shouldn’t have followed the (most highly rated) review that suggested all those spices be added to the sweet potato mixture. The spices completely overwhelmed the dish, and basically turned it into a sweet potato pie minus the pie crust. Next time I’ll just make the recipe as written!

I LOVED this. However as a beginning cook it would have been helpful to know where to put the 3 tablespoon of butter where to put the 4. My sprinkle did not come out in a consistency that allowed me to "sprinkle" it  so I am curious if maybe I did something wrong when mixing it. But it was still EXTREMELY DELICIOUS.

I normally make candied sweet potatoes for Thanksgiving, but this year we were with different family than usual, who happen to not like it. My uncle gave me their recipe for Sp casserole, and it Almost matches this recipe. Between his recipe, this recipe, and the tips and tricks in the reviews this is what I did...

Really delicious!  I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them as other reviewers suggested.  Used 4 large but will use 5 next time because I needed to use  8"by11" instead of  9" by 13".

I bake the sweet potatoes and make twice as much topping, but otherwise stick to the recipe and everyone loves it every year at Thanksgiving! I've never gotten so many comments and compliments on anything I've ever cooked. People have it with the main course and go back for more for dessert! Really, everyone loves it and I insist on making it every year because I love  sweet potato casserole so much and I want the best!

As a newlywed, one of the most stressful things for me is trying to figure out what to cook for dinner. Quickly running out of ideas, I downloaded AllRecipes and started saving favorites. the Yummy Sweet Potato Casserole was the first recipe I tried, and it was incredible! I appreciate the fact that I can modify the recipe for the number of meals we want to serve it for. The recipe was easy, and I only made one adjustment, that being to double the vanilla extract. Served with oven-baked chicken legs and wings, and a southwestern salad, last night's dinner was a wife-win!

I have made this the last two years on Thanksgiving and it is now a must on the table! Everyone loves it! I omit the pecans; just personal preference. I bake whole sweet potatoes then scoop out the flesh. I feel baking them in the oven gives the potatoes more flavor. As one reviewer suggested, I use evaporated milk. I have to double the recipe for our crowd. Will definitely make every year from now on!

Very pleased with the taste, texture and presentation!  I made one change only (I prefer following a recipe completely the first time). I used dark brown sugar instead of white sugar for the potatoes, but I think it would’ve worked great either way. I LOVED that this was sweet, but not overly sweet. Thank you for posting this recipe!!

Being in a hurry, I didn't read through the directions before making. That 1/2 cup of brown sugar went into the potato mixture along with the 1/2 c. white sugar. Of course, I added another 1/2 c. brown sugar to the topping with at least another 1/2 c. extra chopped pecans. My mom, the one with the sweet-tooth, said that the casserole was the best she had ever eaten. Maybe that extra sugar and pecans did the trick!

Super easy. I roasted the potatoes and used gluten free all purpose flour and half the amount of sugar (using raw sugar). This was a most delicious dish!  It's on my list of Thanksgiving favorites.

No changes made and it was the best sweet potato recipe I have ever ate and will make it many times again.  My husband loved it too. I only made half a recipe but used the full amount of topping and it was delicious.

Easy to make. I cooked sweet potatoes in microwave (or oven) instead of taking out some of the flavor boiling them.

So delicious! I made it with 6 cups of sweet potatoes instead and it was still so creamy and delicious. I got cursed out by a friend because she couldn't stop eating it.

I’ve been making my grandmothers recipe for sweet potatoes with crushed pineapple and marshmallows for my family for 20 years and they tried this recipe along side the usual one this year for Thanksgiving in they preferred the new one hands-down! I will be making this version of my sweet potato casserole every year from now on.

Loved it! My husband loved it too and he has never cared for sweet potato casserole. I was in a rush and used canned yams and cut white sugar down to 1/4 cup so it wouldn’t be too sweet.

This is fantastic!!! My whole family loves this. Good for a holiday or a weeknight! I mixed it in advance and then cooked it on Thanksgiving. Took out a 1/2 hour in advance, put on the brown sugar topping and baked as instructed.

Excellent taste, you can skip the pecans and or add marshmallows (the last 10-15 of baking) for the topping.

I tried it with eggnog in place of the milk which makes it even more yummy. I also use agave nectar instead of  sugar--it's equally sweet while also better for you.

I never got "best dish on the table" compliments until I made this dish yesterday, Thanksgiving Day 2017.  Thank you!!!!  I prepared the softened potatoes, the potato mix and the topping all the day before turkey day.  Then all I had to do was bake them together. Easy peasey.

I made this for Thanksgiving and man oh man was it a hit! I will be making it this way every year now! After reading all the reviews I decided to give the recipe a whirl. I made one error though, after it was sitting there waiting for their reservation with the oven, I realized something was not right, I missed an ingredient. The flour for the topping! It was just the butter, brown sugar and pecans.  I was worried it would fail but overall it turned out really great anyways!!

I found myself with two cans of yams and looking for a way to make them yummy as I would have preferred fresh..  After reading several reviews, I made these adjustments to accommodate the canned yams... omitted the milk and doubled the vanilla.  It was a HUGE hit with my family and guests... will be making again.

Hands down, this is the yummiest sweet potato casserole I’ve ever eaten. It has a faint buttery flavor, just the right amount. It’s a little on the sweet side (what sweet potato casseroles aren’t on the sweet side, right?). This recipe replaces a family recipe I’ve used for years. Next time I make it, I plan to cut back a little on both sugars so it won’t be so sweet.  Other than that, this is super delicious. Highly recommend this recipe.

Absolutely perfect IF you add cinnamon and ground cloves to give it some kick. I’ve also added a little orange juice to it before. I use two tall cans of sweet potatoes. Thanks for sharing!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving dinner. This was the first dish people went to for 2nds, and by the end of dinner it was all gone. I was told that I had to make this from now on when we have big dinners. 

The potatoes were silky and fluffy, and the topping was nice and crunchy, just the right amount of sweetness, not too much, not too little. 

Easy enough to make for smaller dinners as well. Didn't make any substitutions on this recipe,

I have made this twice. The first time, I made it as written. It was okay, but nothing special and far too much butter as it bubbled out all around the edges and pooled in the dish after a couple of servings were taken from it. The second time, I modified it and it was much better. Do not boil the potatoes. Bake them with their skins on until they are completely cooked. (You can do this step a day or 2 in advance.) peel the cooked potatoes and measure out what you need for the recipe. Add a teaspoon of cinnamon and a pinch of ginger and cloves. Use brown sugar instead of white. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon to the topping. Yes, it will taste like dessert, but it already has a bunch of sugar, why not amp up all the flavor instead serving a boring, bland, sweet potato dish?

Really excellent! Took a lot more than 4 cups of potatoes - maybe more like 8 cups. I just used the baking pan to gauge the amount. Turned out great without adjusting any other ingredients.

We have never made a sweet potato casserole before, but we decided to give it a try for this Thanksgiving and it was amazing! It was a big success, everyone loved it and we will be adding it to our list of favorites! The only change we made was adding a bit of cinnamon to both the sweetpotato mixture and the topping which gave it such a good flavor! This recipe is a new favorite around the table! Thank you for it!

I make this every year but I change a few things - I bake the potatoes, add pumpkin pie spice along with nutmeg, all spice and cinnamon to the mix.

I love this recipe. Instead of boiling them I cook them for 30 minutes in the pressure cooker and then they’re ready to mash with all the flavor of baked sweet potatoes in less time.

It's my older son's favorite dish every Thanksgiving!  What's even greater about this recipe is that it doesn't have marshmallows (which I personally think are gross with sweet potatoes), and my son at 10 years old could pretty much make it himself leaving me with more time to make other dishes!  Win win!

Absolutely delicious. Used evaporated milk instead of regular milk just because I had extra and wanted to use it. The inside is fluffy and mildly sweet. Wow the topping is sweet, buttery, and crunchy.

Great recipe, I just tweaked a few things, I added orange juice  and a bit of orange zest, subbed  1/2 cup of maple syrup for sugar ( to doubled recipe), used cream instead of milk , I may drizzle a little more maple syrup over pecan mixture when I serve it as well.

This is a must have for our Thanksgiving and Christmas meals.  The only thing I do differently is roast the sweet potatoes in the oven to bring out the sugars.  Delicious!

Followed the recipe as written but used baked potatoes. It brings out the flavor, no soggy taters, peeling or cubing. Just scoop the potatoes out of the skins. Alway a favorite.

I read the reviews and did what many suggested, and baked the sweet potatoes. I missed the word "mash" and left the sweet potatoes cubed. I also cut the sugar in half and cut the topping in half. It was delicious. I think for Thanksgiving, I will put it into a square casserole dish and not a 9 x 13. I will make the topping as suggested.

I made this for the first time  at Thanksgiving last year. It was a smash hit! Everyone loved it so much that it was the first dish to be emptied and I made a second batch to go with the leftovers the next day. It is perfectly sweet and almost creamy.

A hit every time I make it!  Someone always ask for this recipe.  I substituted pecans for walnuts.  I also add a few more walnuts to more fully cover the dish.  You may increase the other ingredients for the topping based on the increase in nuts.

Made this dish for thanksgiving and it was a hit - thank you!!! My mother in law said that she will never eat sweet potatoes any other way - as suggested in reviews I did cut the white sugar back and added  1 tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of both ground clove and ground nutmeg cuz I like spice.  I tripled the nuts...and messed up and got walnuts by accident  instead of pecans (no one noticed).  This will now be a go to recipe for me...

I made this, but found it was a little runny as I used drained sweet potatoes out of a can. I would cut back on the butter within the dish. I also added a layer of marshmellows on top. This dish was well received!

Delightful!!! Definitely bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. Love that I can prep this ahead of time for the holidays.

I made this casserole and it was a huge hit. Even people who weren't fans of sweet potatoe loved it. I had none left over people went back for seconds. I made the casserole without any additions or deletions to the recipe. I would make it again.

I cut the sweet potato Ingredients in half and replace the white sugar, with 2 heaping tablespoons brown sugar with egg mixture If you are not using nuts, I used a combo. of Monterey Jack, Pepper jack, bread crumbs,  I also added 1/2lb. ground beef, 1 sausage, 1/2 onion cut into thin slices, 2 large mushroom diced, 1 celery stalk, brown meat & veg. mixed into the mashed potatoes then top with nuts or cheese Your Choice .

Delish!  I've made this several times.  So good.  I use baked sweet potatoes.  The amount of white sugar I use varies, usually slightly less than the recipe states.  Great all year long!  Thanks

Made according to recipe. Husband & son loved it, but I found it way too sweet. I think, next time, I'll omit the white sugar, add some spices, and then for the topping, decrease the brown sugar and add more pecans.

I believe it's a bit unfair to rate a recipe unless making it exactly as provided, that said, I did modify this based upon AR and reader recommendations.  First, as suggested by the AR  test kitchen, I tripled the quantities for the potato ingredients but omitted the milk as suggested by a reviewer and decreased the sugar to 1 cup instead of the tripled 1 1/2   because  many reviewers felt it was too sweet.  One reviewer mentioned adding 1/2 - 1 t cinnamon, 1/2 t nutmeg, and 1/4 t ground cloves to the potatoes as they're mashed, so I did add these.  Some reviews mentioned baking rather than boiling the spuds first, and that's what another very similar recipe on the site (Gourmet Sweet Potato Casserole)  instructed, so I baked them for 30 minutes on 350 ,until they could be pierced with a cake tester,  but they were still too hard to mash after I cubed them, so I ended up boiling the cubes. Next time, I'll simply boil them.  Even with the tripled ingredients the 9 x 13 pan was fine and the original quantity of topping worked well.  The verdict at New Year's dinner was generally favorable, but most thought it was too sweet and several described it more like dessert.  I will make this again with less sugar.  The only other variable was that all that was at the produce market were yams and white sweet potatoes.  There were no orange sweet potatoes, so I opted for the white.  Don't know if they're sweeter than the others, so next time I'll use the orange.

This was just "ok" I guess. It was too sweet really, and the flavors just didn't seem to pop. Not sure what the deal was. Consistency was ok I guess. A little on the soft side but wasn't 'runny' necessarily. I baked the potatoes for 1.5 hours at 375 degrees. Added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp ground cloves, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg.

The sugar called for is way too much. I halved the sugar in the topping and in the sweet potato mixture and it was still very sweet. Otherwise, very good.

Fabulous!! Except for using canned yams, followed recipe exactly. So good! Tip: use the oven broiler to brown the topping after finished baking, but keep an eye on it- can go from brown to burnt quickly!

I substituted regular milk for evaporated.  Used 1/4 ground cloves and 1/4 nutmeg as well. I also added 1 TBS of Maple Balsamic vinegar into potato mixture.  I love pecans so used twice the amount in original recipe. I do recommend baking the potatoes first, then mashing, so much easier.  Anna M.

TBH I wasn't that impressed. It was rather eggy to me, and bland. It definitely lacked flavor, but it's a decent basic go by for beginners.

Fine the way it was, for me. Took to a potluck without my trying it first (daring, if I do say so myself) and it went over just fine! Other guests in my house wanted seconds.  Great as leftover the next day with some eggs and coffee as well.

I made this for my Thanksgiving meal this year & EVERYONE loved it! The only change I made was using gluten-free flour so my daughter & I could indulge in this. And indulge we did!! It was FANTASTIC! My sister wants me to bring it for Christmas! Thanks for sharing your amazing recipe!

Very popular at a Thanksgiving family dinner. I used less white sugar and less flour. I chopped 3 long carrots and i apple, including  the peal and slightly softened them in the sweet potato water, then mixed it into the casserole before putting it in the oven. Really added depth to the flavor.

My mother was always in charge of making the sweet potato casserole for our family's Thanksgiving dinner. One year she ask me to make it to help out. I used this recipe and the family was crazy for it. Several ask for the recipe. I am now responsible  for making this dish every Thanksgiving.

I made a few changes to this to make it a teensy bit healthier.  For those who are gluten intolerant, I used almonds flour instead of all purpose, almond milk instead of regular milk and stevia instead of sugar to reduce the sugar content. Plus I used canned sweet potatoes to reduce time. It was fantastic!

I made this for our church Christmas potluck. Following another recommendation, I halved the white sugar. I also used almond milk and gluten free flour in the topping. This is a definite keeper!

This was fantastic!  I used to have someone's family recipe but couldn't find it so I made this recipe for Thanksgiving.  OMG this made dinner.  My daughter asked me to make it more often and suggested that I take this for our pot luck dinner next week at school.  I did follow the suggestions of baking versus boiling and I think that was easier and a very good call.  Thank you for posting this recipe!

Updated:  I had to make a dish for our teacher Christmas potluck.  Unfortunately, I had bronchitis and was pretty sick.  As I didn't want to let anyone down, I used canned sweet potatoes but still used this recipe.  There were no leftovers and everyone commented on how delicious it was.

I love this dish!! I used sweet potatoes from a can and added a little cinnamon. It took a few tries to realize not to melt the butter when mixing the topping. Butter needs to soften without using the microwave. If the butter is too liquified, the topping doesn't have the yummy crunchy texture.

This is the dish that my family insists I make every holiday. It's always a hit. The only change I make is to double (almost) the topping ingredients. If I don't, it doesn't seem to cover the surface of the dish ( I use a large casserole dish). Everyone loves the topping so more is better for us.

This has become my go-to recipe for Thanksgiving side dishes to bring to someone's house.  I love sweet potatoes and this dish is like heaven to me.  Even my husband, who is not a fan of sweet potatoes, enjoyed this.  It's like having dessert on the side.  Definitely a great recipe.

Great recipe! My family loved this at Thanksgiving and it was so good I made another batch for me and my husband! I followed previous reviewers' advice of baking the sweet potatoes instead of boiling, and using twice the amount of topping. By doubling the topping, it was just enough to cover the sweet potatoes in a 9x13 pan. I also used cold butter for the topping instead of softened, and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, just because I had it on hand. I also used about 5 cups of sweet potatoes - cooked and mashed, but felt I could have used even more bc the sweet potato mixture spread out in the 9x13 pan was pretty shallow.

This is a good, basic sweet potato casserole. I love sweet potatoes plain and could eat them everyday, so this was perfect as it is not overly sweet. Pecans add a nice flavor.

This is a delicious recipe!! I did make some changes however. I left out the milk, & added some nutmeg &a cinnamon!
As for the topping, it seems to be a 50/50 split on whether or not you should double it.... I tried doubling it, & unless you have a large pan to make it a thin layer of topping, there is no need to double it (although I did add more pecans to the topping...)
All in all, delicious casserole!

Fantastic!  I'm diabetic and gluten sensitive so used Pyure sweetener with a small amount of molasses and almond flour instead of wheat flour.  Turned out wonderful.  I think I will try it with butternut squash next time, for lower carbs.  Definitely will make again for a Holliday treat.

I make sweet potato  casserole  every year around the  holidays but lost my old recipe. So I  decided to  try this one. I loved it because  it  is  not overly  sweet like my previous recipe.  It is not too rich so you can indulge in a larger serving. I would cut back on the  amount of flour  called for because  it didn't  cook all the way  and wasn't  neccesary. I doubled the  amount of  vanilla flavoring and also added  cinnamon.  This recipe is a keeper.

My family really enjoyed this. I doubled the topping like other reviewers suggested and I loved it, my kids and husband loved it. I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling and it made a difference as well. I will use this as my go-to Thanksgiving recipe from now on instead of the marshmallow one.

I loved this recipe! only change was that I added a tsp of vanilla. Baked it with lid on for 25 minutes then without lid for 10 minutes. Don't skimp on the marshmallows...it puffs up in the oven then seems to shrink when taken out.

Baked four large sweet potatoes, wrapped in foil, at 375 degrees for 1 hour and 15 minutes.  Mashed up the potatoes with 1 tsp of cinnamon and nutmeg, and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk, brown sugar instead of white sugar.

It was a total hit in a family that doesn't care for sweet potatoes.  I did roast the potatoes first as other reviewers recommended, and I used two different types of sweet potato varieties that I found at the grocery store. I didn't add any sugar to the casserole part, and only half the amount of brown sugar to the specified amounts of pecan topping.  It was sweet without being a dessert, and was great on my plate next to another cook's corn casserole! Will definitely make again.

Such an awesome recipe! I had my 10 year old put this together. We only had heavy whipping cream so we had to substitute that for the milk, other then that, we strictly stuck to the recipe. We served it for our thanksgiving meal and everyone went for seconds and even thirds!!! My husband, who doesn't like sweet potato, even asked for more and was very impressed!! Definitely a keeper!!

Super good!  Just saw the changes recommended by AR. Yes it's pretty sweet, so more potato would be good.  Perfect for holiday meals.  UPDATE:  Made it again, this time with ham. So much better, the sweet with the salty. Yummy.

This is my go to  sweet potato casserole recipe!  It gets raves every time I make it.  I have modified the recipe a bit to make it gluten free friendly by changing the flour to coconut flour.  Other than that, I keep it as is and love it.

As the recipe stands, I can't give it more than 4 stars, because it is far too sweet - more of a dessert! I have made this recipe at the request of the Thanksgiving Day host family for the last 5 years. The first time I followed the recipe word for word, and everybody thought it was delicious... as a dessert. So since then, I've only used a Tbs. or so of white sugar instead of half cup (yams are so sweet on their on) and the outcome is amazing! I usually decorate the top with some whole pecan halves as well as the recipe topping. Five stars with the major change!

Easy - cut out 1/2 the white sugar, replaced w/ brown sugar. Used cream instead of milk. Also, used fresh yams - baked for about 65 minutes @ 425 instead of canned. Also, didn't do the pecans, did a few toasted marshmallows.

We dont love pecans so instead I sprinkled brown sugar and marshmallows on top. The sweet potatoes themselves were amazing!

Made it vegan by using Earth Balance and a tablespoon of arrowroot powder instead of the egg. I was bringing this to a family thanksgiving and I wanted it to be sweet and rich even if it was vegan to impress everyone. Also, after I mashed them, I threw in a few of the frozen sweet potato chunks to give it some texture. I added vegan marshmallows on top, put them in for a few minutes, and everybody loved it! Completely gone except for a last bit that Nana told me not to dare throw it away!

I doubled the Bruce's yams for a thicker layer, added 1 tsp nutmeg, 1 tsp cinnamon and everyone raved about how good it was. It's a keeper.

Like others, I found that this does not make enough casserole to fill a 9x13" pan, so I doubled it, using about 8 medium sweet potatoes.
Before I mention my alterations, just a note to say this was an immediate hit because of the taste and the texture and they already want to add it as a Thanksgiving tradition.
My changes/additions:  Sweet potato casserole needs pineapple, so I processed half a can of pineapple bits and mixed that in.  I didn't have time to wait for the butter to soften so I gently melted it and let it cool a bit before stirring it in.  I used beaters for a short about of time to combine everything and I think this helped make it fluffy.  Other than that I was true to the (doubled) recipe, and it filled the 9x13" pan perfectly.  GREAT recipe and I'll share it and come back to it often.

I made it exactly according to the directions. It was delicious. The only comment I would make is that it was very thin when baked in a 9x13 pan, so it was dry. Maybe a smaller casserole dish would work better.

Wonderful even the next day! I followed the changes from Melissa's 2007 most helpful positive review and it was indeed, SUPERB. This beats the marshmello topped version hands down. I'll make this every holiday from now on.

Oh boy did I make rookie mistakes with this recipe!!   Fortunately, it came out great.   I looked at the ingredients...started mixing all the dry ingredients together....white sugar, brown sugar...when I got to the flour, I thought it odd to add flower directly to the potatoes.  Well duh, the flour and brown sugar was for the topping.   I used the brown and white sugar mix for both the potatoes and the topping.  Phew....that it worked out.   I also halved the white sugar like others suggested.  I cut the brown sugar by a smidgeon.  I baked the potatoes and I will never boil or steam them again.  So easy to throw them in the oven and then scoop the cooked potatoes into a bowl.    This recipe is on my list for every thanksgiving from now on.

The kids were complaining about having to eat this dish and they all had seconds and leftovers!  I baked the sweet potatoes, used 1/4 c. total brown/white sugar, 1/2 c. evaporated milk, 1 tsp. vanilla,  1/4 tsp. of cloves and nutmeg, and 1 tsp. cinnamon.  I am so glad I didnt double the topping!  Perfect!

This was incredible. Probably the best thing I've ever eaten on Thanksgiving in my whole life. I halved the sugar (only used brown), and baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling. I also added mini marshmallows on top and threw them under the broiler in the last few minutes of cooking. This will be a Thanksgiving staple from now on.

I made this yesterday for Thanksgiving and it turned out so good!  I brought it to my parents and my mom, who never eats sweet potatoes loved it and had 2 helpings, same with my dad. I'd say that was a success! :) I'll be making this one again! PS. I boiled them, so I can't imagine what it would taste like baking the sweet potatoes as others suggested. I'll try that next time.

Delish! Everyone loved this dish at Thanksgiving. I would absolutely make this recipe again. I would reduce the amount of sugar, both brown and white. I used walnuts instead of pecans since this dish is sweet already without adding more sweetness.

We have made this recipe for a long time now, it always turn out great and tastes delicious! We made a mistake with it once by forgetting to add butter to the toppings but it still came out just as great. We're considering cooking it like that from now on to reduce some of that fat :) 

This is however rated and made exactly as it calls for. It's terrific.

I make this every year. I add 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of vanilla,  1 teaspoon of cloves, 1/2 teaspoon of nutmeg. I bake it in a 9x9 and add extra time to the baking. That way it's deep dish and the topping is thicker.

Made this for the first time as part of out Thanksgiving menu.  Used Evaporated Milk as others have suggested and used way less butter and sugar in the potato mixture.  Everyone raved!  So excited for tomorrow's leftovers!  Oh, yes... and I baked the potatoes in the crock pot ahead of time.  This method required minimal prep!

This was wonderful!   I've made this recipe a few times and it's always a hit.  I'm not a big fan of super sweet, so I never ate much of it.  This time I doubled the sweet potato, 3 eggs, a little extra of the crumb mixture.  Added cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves.  I only added about 1/4 cup of sugar to the potato mixture.  It was just the right sweetness this time. Oh, I also roasted the potatoes in the oven instead of boiling.  Much tastier and more nutritious that way.    My 3 and 4 year olds thought it was pie.  :)

Wonderful! Llight and flavorful. Tried this for Thanksgiving with a couple of changes-baked the sweet potatoes,  used evaporated milk,  and a food processor. Browned a sprinkling of miniature marshmallow on top at the end. Also used an 8x8 pan instead of a 9x13, after seeing previous reviews of not enough pecan topping, and that was perfect. Can't wait to make this again!

I made it exactly to the letter, except I added a layer of mini marshmallows between the potatoes and topping.  My husband and family members said that it was freaking delicious and requested it at every family function from here on out.  A+ for a great recipe.  Oh and I added a teaspoon of cinnamon.

Never made a sweet potato casserole before and decided to go with this one for Thanksgiving.  I added a pinch of pumpkin pie spice and I put NO SUGAR in the potatoes themselves just the brown sugar for the topping.  Added an extra layer of whole pecans on the top and it was the best dish in the house.

This recipe was delicious and easy to make.  I made a couple changes to make it a little healthier.  For the sweet potato mixture, instead of 1/2 cup white sugar, I used 1/4 cup; and instead of 4 tbsp. butter, I used 3 tbsp.  For the topping, I used 1/3 cup brown sugar rather than 1/2 cup; and 1/4 cup flour rather than 1/3 cup.  The result was excellent.  Thanks to Tina B for a wonderful recipe!

This was an excellent and very easy recipe. I didn't even measure carefully, but just threw everything together and it turned out great. The texture was different than I expected -- probably because of the addition of eggs -- but in a good way. I will definitely make this again.

I followed Theresa R.'s tip and only made the topping.  It had a lower calorie but delicious result.   It went over well this Thanksgiving day with our crowd.   I microwaved the sweet potatoes and removed the skins.   It was easy and good!

WOW--very sweet but excellent.  As I wanted to cut down on the time spent making this Thanksgiving day I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven the night before, and then made up the dish that morning and left it in the fridge until it was time to bake it.  I do wish I'd whipped the pumpkin and the butter together first, then added in the eggs, etc.  It refused to incorporate in the mixer (though it came together in the oven just fine).

I followed the instructions from others for a few changes: sub evaporated milk for regular milk, double the vanilla to 1 tsp; add in 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp each cloves and nutmeg, and double the topping (I'd cut the cinnamon down next time).  I also baked it in a round ceramic dish (~12").  Turned out perfectly.

This is a very good recipe! I used evaporated milk instead of regular milk and added marshmallows right before it was done. I kept everything else the same, and it was a hit!

In general, the recipe is good. I bake the potatoes rather than boil them.  Once they cool, it is easy to slide the potato out of the skin, and the flavor isn't boiled away. I also cut the white sugar in half (no one misses it) and double the pecans (there is still plenty of butter/sugar mixture to cover them).  If someone in your family is lactose intolerant, you can also leave out the milk without much effect on the flavor.

I made this recipe with one sweet potato because I am the only one who eats them.  I pretty much followed the directions, cutting the ingredients in half.  I used less than 1/4 cup sugar and it was plenty sweet.  I didn't have pecans for the topping so used walnuts and I crumbled them over the top and added cut up small squares of butter and sprinkled brown sugar. This came out great.  It is so tasty and good, I dont know why anyone wouldn't like sweet potatoes.

I read all of the reviews, and then decided I would wing it. I roasted 6 sweep potatoes, and then scooped out the flesh. I then added 2 large cans of yams (taking to a pot luck in our large family). I beat 6 eggs, dumped in some cinnamon, and 2% evaporated milk. I beat it all together and it was marvelous BEFORE cooking. I did not add any additional sugar, since I used the canned yams, nor did I add any additional salt. I am sure this will be to die for once the pecan topping is added.....

Made exactly according to recipe, except went heavy on the topping (my family loves it)! I also did not time, but baked I believe about 40 minutes for a nice, crunchy topping. Deff a keeper!

This casserole is AMAZING! Every year around the holidays I always get asked to bring this above any other dish.  ??Just have others have stated in their reviews, I too double the vanilla per batch. I also add just a little bit of nutmeg and cloves ( depending on what you like between 1/4 tsp - 1 tsp of each) ?? DEFINITELY double the pecan toppings!!! It just tastes so much better and don't substitute the pecans with another nut. ??SIDE NOTE while this is a lot of work with the fresh sweet potatoes, it just tastes soooo much better than canned. I've made it both ways and the canned version doesn't taste as creamy and needs a little flour to set up other wise it's too runny.

My family loved this dish! My husband is allergic to pecans so I switched the pecans to rolled oats and it was pretty good. I know it would have been amazing with the nuts instead though! Next time I will probably add more topping, I like a lot!

Really good!  I left out the white sugar and was glad I did, the sweet potatoes are plenty sweet without it.

I've made this a few times now and it's wonderful!! It's always a hit... I do double the recipe for the topping though because that stuff is what makes the recipe and the more the better!!

My husband loves this every time I make it! He now always asks for it at every family gathering. It is a must have for the holidays and there is never any left overs, even after doubling the recipe. I made it the exact way the recipe described and it was perfect. The next time I added a dew dashes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Just as great! This is a now an all time family recipe!

So delicious! I boiled my sweet potatoes and they tasted great! The only changes I made were - 1/2 the amount of white sugar, added cloves and cinnamon, mixed everything in the blender and baked it in a smaller casserole dish. The texture is perfect, light and pillowy - a great side dish for any special meal.

Great recipe. I did not have pecans on hand and so substituted almonds I put through food processor.  Also, since I love cinnamon and nutmeg, I added a dash of each to the recipe. Definitely will fix again. Update: have made this recipe several times and is a big hit around my home. Succeding times of fixing it I used pecans. Still yummy as name implies.

Excellent casserole.  I baked the sweet potatoes in the oven first, 375 for an 1 hour and 15 mins.  Otherwise made as written and it was excellent.

I love this recipe and have been making it for years. I make it as is and we all love it but I also make a second version that we also love. I substitute 1/4 cup of Bourbon for the milk and add cayenne pepper to the topping. It adds a sweet and spicy twist. Anyway you make it, it always comes out great!

Very similar to my recipe. I add half the amount of sugar and switch out the brown sugar for white. 
Also I add pumpkin spice to the topping and it is the BEST. My family raves about this dish and requests it every time we get together .

I followed the advice to make some changes.  I roasted the sweet potatoes for 1 hr 15 min at 375,  used half the white sugar, added 1 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, doubled the vanilla, and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk.  I also doubled the topping but had so much I couldn't use all of it.  (I probably used about 1.5 times the original amount)  Also, I completely flaked and forgot to add the butter to the sweet potato mixture but honestly, no one missed it at all.  Finally I had to omit the nuts because my kids are allergic.  This recipe was absolutely one of the yummiest things I've ever eaten!!  Everyone LOVED it!  Definitely a crowd pleaser and one I'll make every year for the holidays.

very good and easy to make. My 11 year old made this - we uploaded a photo :)  I did use brown sugar 1/4 cup and Sugar in the Raw 1/4 cup instead of the white sugar.  Also added chopped up pecans and cinnamon.  Delicious! Just had it tonight!

The pecans make it really great. 
I followed what others suggested by adding 1tsp cinnamon, 1/4tsp cloves and 1/4 tsp nutmeg - next time I won't do this. I don't think I like those spices very much. I can imagine others liking this if they like those spices as it gives the dish a rich flavor. 

I baked (more flavorful) 3 sweet potatoes as other things were cooking. About 1 hour. (can start them off in microwave, poke holes in them with fork)
1/4c sugar (not 1/2c) - for main part and for the topping
1tsp vanilla (instead if 1/2tsp)
Evaporated milk instead of reg. milk

I liked this, but made about 2x the topping because that was the best part. It's sort of an intermediate between savoury and dessert, which I find odd, but on the whole pretty good.

Love this recipe!  Only thing that I would change is a little less sugar or a little more sweet potato.

Hi y'all! I have made this recipe many times as my family requests  it every Easter, thanksgiving, etc.  It's a huge hit!! I make it with marshmallows (due to young ones) and have substituted half my white sugar for brown to add  a more 'caramel" taste.

Followed Melissa's small additions/changes.  Five ++ stars.  I have never eaten nor liked sweet potatoes in the past.  Made this for the rest of family and I ended up loving this recipe and will be making it often.

YUMMMMMMMMY!  Made few changes:  brown sugar vs white, roasted sweet potato (vs. boil-- it DOES make a difference), then put in food processor with ingredients (+ 1/2 tsp of cinnamon).   Also had to top with marshmallows, bc of nut allergies for some guest.  WAS the BEST I've ever had--and trust me, being from South Alabama, I've eaten many sweet potato soufflés.  I was bummed after dinner that there weren't ANY left over.  :)  Thanks for the recipe!  Will use every T-day and C-mas from now on.

This one looked easy enuf & I had about 8 sweet potatoes beginning to look a little peaked. I baked them b/c the flavor is  better, in general, rather than boiled, & they are so much easier to peal. I put in all of the additional ingredients, plus 1 tsp cinnamon & 1/2 tsp nutmeg. I had a tad of trouble with making the topping; how I was working mine compared to the video fell far short. It just didn't come out as crumbly as the example & there was quite a bit of 'left over' sugar that didn't get mixed at all, even though I didn't use too much:/ 

350 degrees for 30 minutes & it looked a lovely golden in its oval baking dish. My husband & son enjoyed it at least at level 4 stars. Me? I can't wait to try to make it again & master the topping. I'll be ready by holiday season 2016!

Easy to make,followed recipe exactly. The video was helpful! Took about 35 minutes baking time, and I broiled the top for 3 minutes at the end. Tasted very well!

Sweet potatoes are SWEET.   I made this for Christmas and some said it was good but too sweet and others couldn't eat it at all - because again -,too sweet.    Even though I cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup if I ever tried making this again I would leave the sugar out.   I tried adding more sweet potato after but still TOO SWEET.

I made this recipe this last Christmas and this was the BEST sweet potato casserole Ive ever had in my entire life!!!!!!! 

It came out super, super creamy. The texture was amazing and the brown sugar topping with pecans was second to none. I also added mashmellows to it too.

I love this recipe.  I have made it a few times and its a keeper.  I also think it would be a good filler recipe for a sweet potato pie.  Has anyone tried this?  I wish the reviews were searchable (like amazon reviews), hint-hint* :).

I made this for Christmas and everyone loved it.  Very creamy and good sweet flavor.  I don't know if I made it wrong but it was very runny after I followed the recipe so I added 2 more cups of mashed potatoes and it was perfect!  Next time I might cut the sugar a little because it tasted more like a dessert than a side but very good.

I never thought I needed "another" sweet potato casserole recipe, but I saw the reviews on this one and tried it. It really WAS good; the family loved it and it's going to become a "go to" recipe.  I DID add a dash of cinnamon, but otherwise did everything as per the instructions. I made it on Christmas Eve, and then baked it on Christmas Day, things are a little less frantic that way. If you're looking for a good recipe for sweet potato casserole, give this one a try.

We liked this a lot but found it was  little too sweet.  Next time I will reduce the sugar to 1/4 cup.
I did bake the potatoes & it was very easy to peel & mash.  I also doubled the topping as other reviewers suggested.  Will make again.

Great recipe! Made it for Christmas and family loved it. I did roast the potatoes since the oven was already on.  The consistency was chunkier potatoes when they were mashed but it gave it a good texture. I used a smaller dish because the 9x13 was too big. Will definitely make again, maybe even before Christmas this time.

Excellent!  Made it for our Christmas dinner.  Everyone loved it.  This will now be our new holiday sweet potato recipe!  I did bake the potatoes rather than boil them just because it was easier for me to just toss them in the oven whole & unpeeled rather than boiling as per the recipe.

I am always looking for shortcuts, but the only alteration I made here was to use 2 40 Oz cans of cooked sweet potatoes and use brown sugar instead of white. I've made this a few times now as both a whole and half recipe, and it's come out perfectly every time. The whole family requests me to bring it for gatherings.

I'm about to make this for the third time this season. Whatever you do, do NOT double the topping. I think they must have altered the recipe after all of those reviews, because even after doubling the potatoes, and leaving the topping alone, I still had too much topping. Also, I am cutting the white sugar that goes into the potatoes in half this time after slowly trying a little less and less. I guess if you normally like the overly sugared marshmallow-laden dishes, then you may want the full amount of sugar. These potatoes sweeten up a bunch when roasted in the oven, and with the sugary topping if you double this recipe and put it into a 9x13 (which is what I did last time) having so much sugar in the potatoes, and then so much sugar on top is just WAY too much. I like sweets, but I also like to have the actual flavors shine through all the sugar.

I cut the white sugar about in half since the potatoes are already sweet and has a sweet crumble on top. Excellent. The topping is delicious and everyone fights over them.

So good...I put marshmallows on half and walnuts or pecans on the other half as toppings.  Several friends are hooked and make it every year now!
Oh!  Roasting the sweet potatoes in the oven is the way to go for best flavor.

I'm DEFINITELY making this again!!! EVERYONE loved it and wanted to know who made it. I made no changes at all, except maybe a little more vanilla. One tip, though...make sure your eggs aren't directly from the fridge and have warmed up a little. I sent this to a friend who used eggs straight from her fridge and they scrambled when she added them to the potatoes.

Very good. I did bake the potatoes as other reviewers suggested but not really sure whether it would have tasted any different had I boiled them. Next time I'm going to bake in a deeper casserole dish instead of a 9X13.  I felt it was spread out to thin in a 9X13

My family and I loved this recipe!  My children do not like nuts.  So, I made the topping without nuts.  When the casserole was about 10 minutes from being ready, I added marshmallows, a family favorite!

I followed the recipe as is for a Friendsgiving, and they all raved about how good they were! So I decided to bake these again for a company potluck, but made a couple changes based on what I thought was necessary and on some of the reviews.  I doubled the potatoes (3 lbs, which was 6 medium sized potatoes) and BAKED them at 400°F for two hours instead of boiling them.  I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup per serving (2/3 cup total) and increased the vanilla extract to 1/2 tbsp (1 tbsp total).  I also added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp nutmeg.  I then doubled the streusel topping.  These turned out incredible and I still have coworkers asking me for “my family recipe”.  I will definitely be making these again for Christmas!

Made this for Thanksgiving.  I added more pecans, less white sugar and an 8oz. pkg. of cream cheese.  Used 3 baked sweet potatoes and mixed it with a hand mixer.  Had too much crumble for an 8x8 dish.  This was great!  The texture was very light almost like a souffle!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving and I loved it.  I doubled the topping recipe as suggested.  I also added 1/2 teaspoon each of nutmeg, cinnamon, and coconut flavoring.  I switched brown sugar for white but added 1/4 of white sugar.  It was just the right amount of sweetness.  I will definitely make this dish a Thanksgiving tradition.

This was good. I think the flavor is great, but will make more of the topping next time and possibly add some cinnamon to the potato mixture.  I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them - the skin peels right off.

Prepared this dish for Thanksgiving and everyone raved about it.  Following the advice of other reviews I made one alteration to this recipe and used baked sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.  This dish was truly heaven in a casserole dish.  I have never made a sweet potato dish before, but this recipe is fool proof and will impress your guests!

I made this exactly as written but instead of boiling the Sweet potatoes I followed the advice of others and baked them in the oven. It was worth the extra effort! I made the night before and put in fridge sprinkled the pecans on top before baking! Hands down the best Sweet potato casserole I've ever eaten! Ridiculously delish and very easy to make! Thanks for such a great recipe!!

This was really good. I also baked the potatoes for a little over an hour. I didn't even add 1/4 cup of sugar because when you bake the potatoes they taste so much better and sweeter. I did add some cinnamon and nutmeg also. The brown sugar is on the top so that will also sweeten it up, if needed. I stay away from the white stuff as much as possible! I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I'm making it again today for my family,definitely a keeper!!!

This was a huge hit for Thanksgiving dinner! Everyone loved it! I doubled the recipe (including the topping) and used evaporated milk instead of regular milk. It's already being requested for Christmas and will be an addition to my holiday menus from here on out.

Even the pickiest of eaters loved this dish.  The only change I made was to take 1/2 and add marshmallows for the beauty.  If I had to do it all again, I'd add a few more pecans.  So tasty!

I made as directed but switched the milk for half and half, added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the topping, and after it was all baked, my husband insisted that I put mini marsh mellows on before I reheated them. It is the day after thanksgiving and I had to fight my husband for the left over sweet potatoes.. Lol THEY WERE FANTASTIC! It tasted like I was eating a cinnamon roll!

I made this exactly as is. It had a very strong brown sugar taste but it got great reviews from the men at the table.

It was really good, but it was too sweet, and I changed a lot of things. Per other reviewers suggestions, I baked the sweet potatoes, used evaporated milk, increased the vanilla to 3/4 tsp (but might do 1 tsp next time), added a tsp of cinnamon, and 1/2 tsp of nutmeg (I wanted to do 1/4 tsp nutmeg and 1/4 tsp cloves, but I didn't have cloves). I also doubled the topping, but it was too much and didn't use it all. It was really good but just a little too sweet for my taste. I could taste the sugar grinding in my teeth. Next time I will cut the white sugar in half and maybe not pack the brown sugar for the topping. Otherwise, I will make it again!

This tasted really good, but it didn't look so great so people didn't try it.  Probably would not make again because of that.  Or, I might not put it in a 9X13 dish.  Smaller so the pecans cover the entire top.  It was a little naked, and I used double what the recipe called for.  So, maybe a deeper dish with a better looking crust on top would be more appetizing.  Oh, and I baked the sweet potatoes too.  the flavor  was good.

My father-in-law "doesn't really care for sweet potatoes" but he went back for seconds on this one!?? I substituted half-and-half cream for the milk and I added miniature marshmallows on the top!  Also I baked the potatoes and I used 3 large ones.  Really brought out the flavor of the potatoes. This is a permanent addition to Thanksgiving!

Total hit with everyone tonight. I spread it into a 9x13, topped with the pecan mixture in the middle, and surrounded it with marshmallows. Omitted white sugar, subbed brown sugar. Added cinnamon to both the sweet potato mixture and the topping. Also added nutmeg, clove, and allspice to just the sweet potato mixture.  I tasted it without the spices first, and it needed them for our palate. Really small changes that made a big difference in taste.

Great recipe. Made this for the fist time, never made sweet potato casserole before, it was a huge hit on thanksgiving dinner. Made a few tweak as recommended, baked the potato instead of boiling, sprinkle a little bit of nugmeg and cinnamon. I also added marshmallow on top at the last min of cooking. it was the bomb!

Doubled the topping recipe, and 1.5 the other stuff, and added some spices according to another reviewer (cinnamon and nutmeg).

---2016 forgot to read my own review and made it with 5 cups of potatoes and the mash was very wet. Next time I want to use 7-8 cups of potatoes and normal amounts of other ingredients for the potato mash. Then double the topping. I used gluten free flour and it turned it great

THIS STUFF IS DELICIOUS!! As per suggestions I baked the potatoes (two days ago, actually), added fresh grated nutmeg, used evaporated milk, only used brown sugar (in both parts) and doubled (by eyeball) the vanilla. I didn't use cinnamon... I liked it without.   I had some extra browned butter so I used that in both the casserole and the topping.   I had a 6oz package of pecans, used a larger helping of flour and rubbed that all together with brown sugar, and a fat pinch of salt (I like a pinch of salt in my sweet baked items).   It all turned out awesome.  

Thank you to everyone who has made this recipe previously and added so many helpful suggestions.  Trust me you really can't mess this up. Take a flying leap at it, it will turn out splendidly, I promise.

Incredible! I am not a huge sweet potato fan but this recipe made me change my mind. I cheated and cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave. That made it super easy to peel and mash them. My family loves vanilla, so I did add a little more than the recipe called for and also added more nuts. This recipe is a keeper and will be a part of my regular holiday menu from now on. I highly recommend this recipe!

I made the altered recipe from the notes at the bottom, tripling the potato mix ingredients. I also used four whole sweet potatoes, so it was thick. I was worried about the reviews saying it was too sweet, but it was perfect! The family raved about it. This will be a staple in future Thanksgivings.

This is a big HIT during Thanksgiving and Easter.  Even my husband, that doesn't like sweet potatoes, likes this.  The sweet potatoes are mashed and nice and smooth, while the topping is a nice crunchy contrast.

EVERY year!!! It's so good. Everyone loves it and it's become the "thing" I do for Thanksgiving. I always add extra brown sugar, and do 2x the toppings, for a sweeter crunch.

Good flavor, but the ratio of potatoes to toppings is almost equal. Would definitely either double or triple the amount of potatoes used. The topping overpowers the potatoes and all you can really taste is the sugar. I think increasing the sweet potato amount and reducing the sugar in the topping will make this a five star recipe.

The recipe is very good.  The first time I did this, I did roast the potatoes, and it was really good.  This time, I had my pressure cooker out so I used it to cook the potatoes.  it didn't produce the same results, the flavor was much deeper with the roasted potatoes.  I also didn't put eggs in the first time, but this time I did and it made the casserole much better!  I will follow this recipe to the tee next time.

The only change I make is I add marshmallows about 5-10 mins before its finished let them get nicely browned. This recipe is a thanksgiving tradition in my house now!! Thank you for the recipe!!

This is my third year making this for Thanksgiving and my guest always love this dish! This is the one dish I really look forward to eating. I know I could make this any time of the year, but if I did that I would probably eat the entire casserole by myself and we can't have that! This recipe is not only easy to make, but it's so darn good I always go for 2nds and 3rds....

Poke holes in yams with a fork and place on cookie sheet in the oven and let bake for 45 min- hour & 1/2 . the peel will come right off and great flavor. I doubled the vanilla added come cinnamon and it is a 5 star dish!

I doubled the recipe and made it (mostly) as written. The only change I made was adding about a teaspoon of cinnamon to the potatoes. The dish got rave reviews! I'll be making it again soon!

Not only was this exceptional it was easy as well. The only modification I made was I increased the brown sugar to one cup because you can never have too much brown sugar in a recipe and I did sprinkle a few small marshmallows on the top. This is definitely a keeper and will now be a staple at family gatherings.

I added 1/2 tsp. each of cinnamon and nutmeg and a pinch of cloves to the potato mixture, and 1/2 tsp. cinnamon to the topping.  The topping really makes this dish so don't omit or skimp on it. 
The casserole came out golden brown on top and almost too moist inside. I added half the milk called for and was happy I did or it would certainly have turned out soggy.
Even after all the additions/omissions, the dish is blander than I desired. I likely won't make it again.

Love this recipe!  This will be our 3rd Thanksgiving that I will be making it since it has been a big hit in our family.  The only thing I would change for this recipe is to bake the sweet Potatoe instead of boiling them which seems to take out the flavor while baking the sweet potatoes are more flavorful.

I've been making this for Thanksgiving and Christmas for 30 years, however I do bake the sweet potatoes. I introduced it to some friends from Ecuador who literally beg for it whenever we get together for a meal. The pecans are so much better than orange juice or marshmallows  and it can be either a side dish or substitute as a dessert.

Per adjustments this recipe turned out fantastic! I have never made a casserole before and made this for my husband's work pot luck.  He works overseas in Italy and the Italians have never tasted anything like this and couldn't stop raving about it. I did make the changes others suggested. I baked the sweet potatoes, used brown sugar instead of white and 1/2ed it. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves to mixture and used evaporated milk and doubled the topping. My husband said it is the best thing I have ever made. Looking forward to making this for the holidays one year.

EXCELLENT!  Wouldn't change  a thing!  I do bake my sweet potatoes as opposed to boiling them.  Wrap in foil and bake for 1 hour at 375*.  It's just easier cleanup and I think they taste better!

I made this exactly like the recipe calls for it for Thanksgiving pot luck at work and the co-workers loved it. They requested it for this year again. Very simple and I think that's why they enjoyed it so much. Thank you.

I made this for a Thanksgiving gathering and it was raved about!  I used 5 giant sweet potatoes baked for 1:40 the night before and stored in the fridge overnight (mashed).  I used brown sugar mixed with the potatoes instead of white and reduced to 1/3 cup.  I upped the vanilla to 1 tsp, and used 1 egg white in place of one of the eggs.  I think reducing the butter a bit and swapping out the sugar with Splenda would allow this dish to be just as flavorful while making it even a bit more healthy.  This is a keeper for a sweet potato dish!

I made this three time now and each came out great!  I did make one change and mashed the sweet potatoes instead of cubing them.  I doubled the recipe and put them in two - 9 inch glass pie pans.  I did have to double the topping recipe but was well worth it!

My "must cook" at every Thanksgiving dinner. When my invitations go out all I hear is are you making that sweet potatoe casserole again?! I must admit though that I had to use almonds instead of pecan nuts (but only bc I couldn't find any pecan nuts)

This is an excellent recipe.  The only changes I made was baking the sweet potatoes, reducing the white sugar by 1/2 and adding about double the chopped pecans.  Really enjoyed the compliments from our dinner guests.  My family wants me to add this to our regular dinner rotation and not just special occasions.  I made this in the morning and then just popped it into the oven when it was time.  Great recipe!  Thanks!

Great recipe! My husband, who dislikes sweet potatoes, really liked it. He said I could make it again, which means it's a winner in my books!

Excellent - we made the dish for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it.  A new favourite and a future holiday tradition.  We made one small change - we used Pecans rather than walnuts which were fantastic.

Made it using the tips from Melissa (most helpful positive review) and it was crazy good.  Everyone loved it.  The spice suggestions she gave were spot on.  Really flavourful but not at all overwhelming.

This is my husband's favorite dish!  Every time we have a family get together, he wants me to make this dish.  I made this recipe exactly the way the "most helpful review" stated (add 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of both nutmeg and ground cloves to the potato mixture, and doubled the topping portion - even if you're making a single serving), and I will never change a thing!  Such a hit and so yummy!  Thanks for the recipe!

I cut down the sugar to quarter of a cup. It tasted great but I still found it too sweet. Maybe it's just me but you could almost classify it as a desert. Albeit a very good one!

This recipe was good but I did take some of the suggestions, used more of everything and I STILL had a sparse looking pan, not what I wanted to bring to the party I was going to. I would suggest at least doubling if not tripling everything if you want a full pan to take to a party.

This is a staple at our holiday table. I do think it needs to be made with sweet potatoes and not canned yams. Worth the effort and so yummy. Even the seething potatoe haters eat these!

I always like to make recipes the first time following it exact, that way I can truly tell how it is supposed to turn out. My boyfriend loved this recipe. I also thought it was extremely good, just hated that I knew it took a cup of sugar. So I think next time I am going to modify it as some have done and cut down the sugar and see how it turns out. As is, its wonderful and if you are going to eat it just now and then, who cares about the calories right.

Delicious! The best potato casserole I have ever made! (and trust me , I've made a lot) my family ate it all but I read the reviews and changed it up a bit.

Some I read and some I thought of so don't worry I know that I'm copying) Add less sugar by you sweet tooth taste (this thing really did seem a bit too sweet) , add more vanilla extract, ALSO by your taste, my family hates cinammon for whatever reason but I tried to add about 1\4 cup of GROUND cinnamon for the topping, I tried to change the pecans to some other nuts but no...just no, use only pecans .  And add a bit more salt  (gives it more flavors) . And here you go! This recipe us perfect, it is now a tradition in my family)))

This had a really good slightly spicy taste and was very tender.  I used apple cider vinegar. It did have a lot of liquid at the end if cooking time even though I did as others suggested and turned up the heat to cook down. Still a repeat quality easy recipe.

This turned out great. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger along with the other dry ingredients for an extra sweetness. I also substituted walnuts instead of pecans and they were also great. I'll continue using this recipe for a while.

Fantastic! I had some trouble with the crumb topping; my butter melted and did not add pecans, so I dropped spoonfuls of the brown sugar mixture on top of the casserole, baked it for 20 minutes at 325 degrees, and then swirled the brown sugar into the casserole and continued to bake for an additional 10 minutes.  It is really a delicious recipe. Thank you for sharing :-)

Excellent!  I followed the advice of other reviewers and baked the sweet potatoes beforehand.  The potatoes slid right out of the skins.  I also followed the suggestion of leaving out the eggs and milk, etc. and simplifying it with just the flour, sugar, butter and nuts.  Just stirred together with potatoes.  It was fabulous!

Awesome! Made exactly as written but halved the recipe, and added cinnamon and nutmeg to potato and topping. I think it deserves less stars because those were omitted, but it turned out beautifully with a great texture, this is my new sweet potato recipe!

Made this for thanksgiving with the suggested adjustments of more vanilla (it's hard to have too much vanilla) and cinnamon; evap milk in place of milk; and additional clove and nutmeg. I thought the clove would be too much after I added it, but the finished result was really good. My husband who swears by my fresh pumpkin pie said he liked the casserole better than the pie this year! I will definitely make this again.

I fixed this today for Thanksgiving. It is a real keeper. Everyone raved about it. I made it the same as the recipe but added 1 teaspoon of cinnamon and a little nutmeg and real maple syrup. I was told that from now on when ever we get together this is what I have to bring. LOL

I used this recipe but replaced the ingredients with healthier options to make it dairy free and low sugar and it was still AMAZING.  I replaced milk with equal parts almond milk, butter with equal parts coconut oil, sugar with equal parts xylitol, and the half cup brown sugar with a fourth cup of agave nectar. (I mixed the agave nectar in and topped with pecans only.)  It turned out DELICIOUS and perfectly sweet!  my dinner guests were shocked it was low sugar!

I liked this, I changed it a little I used about a third cup of sweetened condensed milk in the potato part and half the butter.  I probably should have added a small bit of regular milk too because my version was a tiny bit dry.

Fabulous! Made 36 hours ahead of time, and put the topping on right before I baked it. When you are doing Thanksgiving cooking by yourself, some make ahead dishes are a must. This fit the bill. I microwaved the potatoes, cooled them, and they were very easy to peel. A winner.

I changed it up a little and it was a hit for Thanksgiving dinner. I used Pet evaporated can milk for the 1/2 cup milk, used 1/4 cup white sugar & 1/4 cup light brown sugar instead of just 1/2 cup white sugar. I also added 1 teaspoon vanilla flavoring instead of 1/2 teaspoon and also added. Also added some cinnamon. Will definitely be making this again!!

Great recipe.  Even easier and tastier if you bake the sweet potatoes at 400 degrees until they are soft.  Let them cool, and the skins come right off.  Substituted maple syrup for sugar in the potatoes, and substituted 2 tsps. bourbon for the vanilla.  Much better.

I've used this recipe for the past several years but have modified it to my taste. It is a hit at all family gatherings and I'm always asked to bring it. I sometimes make an extra batch for my brother who LOVES it. I omit the sugar and vanilla as it is sweet enough on it's own. I use evaporated milk instead of milk and increase the salt just a bit. This provides a nice contrast between the potato and topping. I too double the recipe and increase baking time to 1 hour. I highly recommend this recipe to all. It goes well with poultry, ham, and pork roast.

Have never made sweet potato casserole before, and my first attempt at this recipe was an enormous hit! I took it to a Thanksgiving lunch at work and it was entirely consumed, greedily. One of my coworkers runs a food truck and said that was the perfect sweetness. Straddles the line between dinner and desert wonderfully.

I followed the recipe to a T and was very happy with the results. It's absolutely delicious! Next time I may cut the sugar in half since sweet potatoes are already sweet enough to me. Only "short cut" I took was cooking the sweet potatoes in my crockpot rather than on a stove top. I peeled and cut them and put them in my crockpot for 6 hours on low with 1 cup of water. When I got home, all I had to do was drain and mash the potatoes and add the ingredients. Super easy and super yummy!

Hey Melissa made great changes ( most helpful, positive review) use those changes but roast the sweet potatoes before baking. BEWARE it's amazing but very sweet and really more of a dessert. But is you're splurging for the holidays it's really a great recipe :)

Wasn't sure how to rate this - I thought it was WAY too sweet, but my guests literally gobbled it up, so apparently I was the minority. I made it as directed except baking the sweet potatoes first. The topping was awesome, but next time I would add less sugar to the potatoes.

This recipe was a great hit!  There were no leftovers with my family of six.  I actually didn't have pecans so I used some finely crushed walnuts and it made almost a crust over the top that tasted great.  Next time, I will definitely get pecans so I can try that too!

A winner in my family. I do microwave the potatos so I can cut them quicker. The last couple of times I've made it, I've replaced the sugar with stevia and it was just as amazing! The whole family loved it.

This was a hit, I served it at Thanksgiving to rave reviews.  The only thing I did different was to bake the sweet potatoes in the oven, otherwise I followed the recipe.  Just what I was looking for, thank you!

Perfect holiday dish! I used only brown sugar and increased the amount mixed with the sweet potatoes. Everyone LOVES this dish!

I've made this 2 Thanksgivings in a row and I love it. It was really sweet at first so I cut the sugar in half, sweet potatoes are sweet enough. I'll be making this every year.

Served this recipe at our Christmas dinner.  I'm not fond of sweet potatoes, but this was so good I came back for seconds.  I talked a couple of other people into "tasting" and guess what??? they ended up taking a full serving.  This is not your ordinary sweet potato casserole - very different and delicious!

Delicious! This dish is super tasty. I love that it doesn't use marshmallows. I followed the recipe exactly and then added additional pecans on top. It went over very well this past Thanksgiving.

I used this recipe for Christmas dinner, just as written, except I steamed the yams instead of cooking directly in water. Everyone loved it! I do think it is too much like dessert, however, and next time will use an extra yam, baking or microwaving as suggested by others, and cut the amount of sugar by half or more. The pecan topping was awesome as is. I think a slightly smaller baking dish would work fine also.

I've made this several times and it's ALWAYS a hit. it's like eating dessert!! Creamy, moist, sweet, and the nuts and sugar on top are to die for. I followed the recipe exactly, although I admit it's hard to measure uncooked potatoes!

I make sweet potato casseroles at least once a year for the past 25, and this is my favorite recipe.  Not TOO sweet, easy to make and not too loaded with fat (speaking relatively).  I did bake the sweet potatoes beforehand.

So good. It's very rich and sweet so a little goes a long way.  I used sweet potatoes I had frozen and mashed earlier this year but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.

I made this recipe dairy and gluten free!!  I also changed it up by baking my sweet potatoes and then skinning them.  I then cut them into chunks and pour the liquid mixture over the chunks of sweet potatoe. I choose to use brown sugar in the first half of the recipe and then for the crumb topping I used oat flour. I also used a butter alternative and it was AWESOME.  Due to the consistency of the oat flour I had to change it in order for the crumbs to be crumbs... not goop.  I looked for a way to alter this recipe for my gluten free, dairy free needs and came up empty handed so I have had to experiment.  For starters I doubled the recipe because it gets inhaled!  I used 1 1/2 cups of oat flour and 1 1/2 cups brown sugar with six tablespoons of butter alternative.  I melt the butter and drizzle it into the dry mixture  and fold the dry mixture onto the melted butter.  The result is huge chunky crumbs like on cake boss!!!  I also glazed my pecans so they are like candy from recipe I found.  Egg white, 2 teaspoons of water, 2 tsp. of vanilla and a tsp. of salt, whipped until frothy and then add 1 cup of sugar. I chopped my pecans really small and then put them into the glaze mixture.  Bake at 325 for 30 minutes, turning them over after 15 minutes. I then sprinkle them on top of the crumb topping before the marshmallows!  This, my friends is heaven.  I cannot eat pie anymore really so this is my dessert. I hope all of those gluten free, dairy free people enjoy!!!

This is a great recipe to adapt for diabetics! Have made it substituting Ideal brand sweetener and it tastes great. Could not find that brand this year, so I substituted a stevia blend and it also tastes great. Other than the sweetener substitution, I baked the sweet potatoes, and followed the rest of recipe as stated. Everyone enjoys these, even the non-diabetics in the house!

Fabulous sweet potatoes!  But consider that this comes from someone who doesn't like sweet potatoes and these come out almost like a dessert, doing a nice job of overpowering the potatoes...

I added cinnamon/nutmeg, and I used less milk but added a 1/4 cup of orange juice, pineapple juice works too.The citrus adds so much flavor. The topping is what makes this casserole.

I really enjoyed this recipe. I am actually making it again next week. the only issue I had with it was that the pecan topping didn't "melt" per say. it stayed very brown sugary. I think this time I will add more butter possibly? any suggestions? I also used one sweet potato and one yam. it was a mild sweetness I was afraid of it being too sweet.

My brother-in-law said these were to sweet but NOONE else agreed with him!  They were the first thing to disappear from Thanksgiving Leftovers.  I combined the ingredients the night before to make it easier in the rush of getting the meal on the table.  My only complaint is I don't think it really served 12 - I would make a lot more next time.

Made this at my Thanksgiving table this year.  Very good and added per others' suggestion an eyeball amount of nutmeg, cinnamon and ground cloves.  Some people at my table did find the topping of the casserole too sweet.  Will eliminate next time the topping and maybe just add some small marshmallows.

This was amazing.  Everyone wanted the recipe.  I'm not big on sweet stuff in general, but this dish was certainly the exception to the rule.  I used a deep dish and lined the interior rim with mini marshmellows.  Wonderful addition and a very pretty presentation.

This was delicious! I omitted the white sugar as others suggested and I baked yams because I like them better. This will definitely be on my holiday menu every year!

So easy using leftover sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving!  I halved the recipe since it's just my Dad & I.  Used an 8x8 pan.  Turned out perfectly!  The only change I made other than that was to place pecan HALVES on top instead of the chopped.  Just a personal preference.

I've made sweet potato casserole for Thanksgiving in the past and was never impressed. This recipe was AMAZING! Everyone loved it! We had a large group for Thanksgiving this year and everyone raved about it. They even went back for 2 and 3 helpings. I followed the recipe exact and it was perfect. This will definitely be a tradition in our family. Enjoy!

I made the recipe and forgot the milk! It was fanstastic, very crunchy and delicious. I didn't put it the 9x13 pan, but an 8x8 casserole dish. Will do this recipe again, for sure!!! Total hit with adults and children.

I just made this for my first Thanksgiving, and it was a huge hit. It was one of the sides that disappeared first, and that was considering I just used canned yams rather than baking them. Next time, I want to bake my own and see how even more flavorful it comes out. I only made slight changes to mine, using brown sugar instead of white, and added cinnamon and nutmeg for a more holiday-spice flavor. The chopped pecans really top off the flavor, couldn't have gone without it. I also love gooey marshmallows on top, so I added some last (found some pumpkin spice flavored ones that were so good for this). I will definitely make this again.

I made this for thanksgiving. I baked the sweet potatoes like suggested in other reviews.  They turned out AMAZING! The best sweet potatoes I've ever had.  Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe. I will definitely make these again.

I made this for Thanksgiving and it was a big hit. It was requested for next Thanksgiving.  I baked the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.  The pecans were not used because of some family members who won't eat nuts.

nice and fresh taste. The crumble was very sweet - could only eat a little at a time. I made mine with fresh yams that I had roasted the day before. Topped half of mine with mini marshmellows because that's how we do it in the south.

The hubs begged me to make this after he tried it at his company's Thanksgiving dinner. I followed the recipe exactly except I used brown sugar all the way instead of white sugar, and I added marshmallows on top before adding the brown sugar & pecan mixture. Hubs said it was even better than the one he had at the office. I will make this for him every year!

With the exception of baking my potatoes rather than boiling them and whipping them in my mixer I followed the recipe to the letter. This is one outstanding casserole! 
I also made another casserole from a different recipe because one of my guests didn't like pecans. That recipe I did not care for except the topping. So for now on I'll use this recipe, but the other topping with pecans or a pecan walnut mixture. Here is the topping recipe:
Pour ½ cup flour into a small mixing bowl. Cut in ¼ cup soften butter until the mixture is coarse and add 1 cup crushed walnuts (or pecans).
Pour 4 TBSP maple syrup in a small saucepan on low heat, once heated add 1 cup brown sugar and melt into the syrup. Next add 1 TBSP butter to the maple syrup/brown sugar mixture
Pour the syrup mixture into the bowl with flour. Combine together just enough with your fingers, don't over mix! Spread the mixture over your sweet potato dish. Lastly take ½ cup of crushed walnuts (or pecans) and sprinkle evenly on top. Bake for 30- 35 minutes. Enjoy!

When I saw this recipe it made me nostalgic so I prepared this for Thanksgiving instead of the usual candied sweet potatoes. Very nice, balanced dish that I didn't feel was too sweet. I did holiday-spice it up with cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I baked it a bit longer - about 45 minutes - and then turned the broiler on low for just a couple of minutes, gently caramelizing the pecans. Wow, it was a hit!

Very yummy! I doubled the topping so it would cover the entire 9x13 pan and sprinkled the potatoes with cinnamon right before putting the topping on. Delish!

I used this recipe for Thanksgiving and followed other suggestions I read in reviews.  I baked the sweet potatoes, omitted white sugar, doubled vanilla and used evaporated milk.  I think this recipe would've been great as is as well!  It was creamy, rich and just sweet enough without the added white sugar -- everyone loved it!!

I used this recipe on Thanksgiving day.  I had to boil the potatoes because my turkey was taking up all the space in my oven! The crust was not enough to sufficiently cover the contents of a 9x13 pan, so I doubled them.  The result was an instant family favorite!  I will definitely be making this again!

I made this recipe for the first time at Thansgiving dinner;   therefore, I had to use canned potatoes rather than fresh (too many things to do within a few hours).  I combined 2 40 oz cans of Sweet Potatoes with the other ingredients and blended until smooth.  I considered increasing the sugar and butter because I did have approx 1 additional cup of potatoes than what the recipe called for - but I did not because we had many other "sweet" casseroles/deserts.   My family loved it.  I personally think sweetness turned out perfect but you could increase the sugar slightly if you like sweeter foods.   I may try a dash of cinnamon next time simply because all our traditional family yam recipes include cinnamon and sugar (and are fantastic)!!

I made this for the first time ever, and the family LOVED it! Did as other reviewers recommended, and roasted/baked the sweet taters till the natural sugars released. Also kept the topping as is, and for our family of seven, it was enough with left overs to divvy up. Delicious and thank you for sharing!

This was terrific.  Even my husband, who does not care for sweet potatoes, ate every bite.  This will become a standard for our family's thanksgiving dinner.

Made it for the first time this year for two separate Thanksgiving meals, and people at both LOVED it!  I cooked the sweet potatoes in the microwave in the skins and let them cool before mashing them.  I even tripled the recipe and served it in two 9x13 pans to make thicker layers of sweet potato and topping.  I think it took 45 minutes to cook, and it turned out great!  We will definitely be eating this again next year!

Been making this recipe for a few years now.  Had used a Candied Yams recipe until I found this.  I use a large 29oz can of sweet potatoes per batch.  Everyone loves these.  It is sweet, but they are great.

Very good!!  I made this for Thanksgiving and received lots of compliments.  I loved the flavor!  I changed the recipe slightly though by omitting the eggs (eggs just seemed too weird to me), I added 1.5 tsp cinnamon and used maple syrup instead of white sugar.  VERY good and will now make this a Thanksgiving staple!!

Yummy!  Fluffy and soufflé-like.  Next time will use baked sweet potatoes to save the peeling/chopping/boiling work.  also will use cold butter since the softened butter made the topping a little too soupy.

These were PERFECT! We baked them first and then followed the recipe. We loved the buttery sweet potato taste on the inside with the sweet crunchy topping to sweeten it to perfection!

Don't waste your time cubing the potatoes for boiling. These things are hard and difficult to cut sometimes. Boil them whole. It takes longer, but once they are cooled a little the jackets (skins) just slide right off. And - this is a great recipe. My family has loved it for years.

This is so good!  I substituted a brown sugar substitute to make it a little healthier and it turned out awesome!  The topping is so good, like eating candy. I baked the sweet potatoes in the over with skins on, found this easier than peeling and boiling the goodness out of them.  The mixture seemed a little runny when I first put it in the pan but it was great when finished.  Going to make it again, know it will be a hit at dinners!

This is a really great side dish or dessert.  My fam loved it.  I only added more sugar, a teaspoon of flour to make it a little more firm and marshmellows.

Love this recipe. My family was skeptical so I only made a small dish. It was a hit. They liked it as a dessert rather than a side dish. Will make again. I cut the sugar and it was still sweet enough for us. It's a keeper.

I wanted to leave out the white sugar, but then I was like, “What the heck, it’s a holiday.” So delicious.

This recipe is great!!! I made it for Thanksgiving a few years ago and everyone loved it, so now I make it for every family holiday. I tried using extra sugar at first, but I defintiely prefer using only a half cup like the recipe says. I also don't add pecans, but it seems fine without them. :)

Well it shouldn't surprise anyone that this recipe is very sweet. Very sweet. Almost too sweet. But the kids absolutely adored eating the casserole and revealing in the fact that a sweet potato is a vegetable. I wouldn't make this except on special occasions because it feels very indulgent.

This is SO good!  Now I make it every holiday instead of candied sweet potatoes.  The first time I made it exactly by the recipe, and everyone LOVED it.  However, we have lots of diabetics in our family--so now I make it with 1/4 cup Splenda in the sweet potatoes and 1/4 brown sugar in the topping.  It is still plenty sweet, so you won't notice the reduction.  It still gets rave reviews--and it is much more carb-friendly.

This is one of my favorite recipes of all time. It's so light and perfectly sweet. I always make a huge batch (at least double the recipe) for holiday get-togethers and there are never any leftovers. I use yams instead of sweet potatoes though, I did a mix of the two once and using only yams just tastes so much better.

OMG this is the BEST sweet potato casserole I have ever had. I never cared for sweet potatos and always turned my nose at sweet potato casseroles, but I had some in the veggie drawer and decided to try to find something to do with them -- this recipe is amazing! It   is so addictive, too :) And something you can feel great about eating!

I made this for a large family dinner and it was a hit as is.  I didn't change a thing. I more than doubled the recipe and there wasn't any leftovers.  5 stars all the way.  Thanks for the recipe.

While this is pretty sweet, it is very delicious. You can always cut back on sugar if desired.  My family devoured this at Christmas.  A repeater for sure.

LOVED this recipe, even though I goofed and made it with yams. Can you believe it? The only thing I would do differently next time is change out the white sugar for brown. This is DEFINITELY easier for christmas dinner than trying to make enough candied yams for all your guests! Give it a try :)

I have made this same recipe for over 30 years and my family has loved it every time I make it. They lick the bowl. Found it in a North Carolina church cookbook and decided to try it and was so glad I did. The only difference is I add a little flour to the topping so it is now so soft and melts in. A little flour helps to make it a little sticker and stand up. I usually add a little cinnamon and nutmeg to it too.

I don't mind a bit of 'sweet' with savory main course but this was more like serving dessert rather than a side vegetable.  Too much sugar even though I used less than recipe.  Seemed like more of a pie filling.

My family says this is a keeper.  Great flavor. I used recommendations made by other reviewers so I added cinnamon and nutmeg and I baked the yams for 1.5 hrs. Perfect!

This was a huge hit at Thanksgiving!  Everyone loved it and kept going up for seconds.  I followed some of the previous reviewers suggestions (baked potatoes in foil first instead of boiling them) and it turned out incredible.  I may dial down the sugar in the crumble next time just to try it out as it was really sweet with the sugar in the potatoes and the topping.  But no one complained, so I may keep it as is :)

I've tried several sweet potato recipes and this one is excellent. Followed recipe to the letter. Having had friends over for dinner tonight I wasn't sure who was a fan of such a dish or not but since I had other options I figured they had a few choices. But to my surprise, everyone absolutely loved it. Even a friend who "doesn't like stuff like this" had 3 servings. So I will definitely make it again.

My favorite. My dad never used to eat the sweet potatoes. This year for some reason he tried them and even asked to take the leftovers home.Then a few days later he brought me some sweet potatoes and asked me to make him some more. I do double the topping.

This has got to be the best tasting sweet potato casserole ever! I did bake the sweet potatoes as opposed to boiling, but otherwise followed the recipe. My family loved it and I will be making this as a thanksgiving/Xmas staple every year!

Love this recipe!! I have used this one a couple times now, and it's always a hit! I made a few changes after reading other reviews. I use evaporated milk 3/4 cup, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 tsp vanilla extract. Used about 6 sweet potatoes as well, and I also double the topping. My family gobbles it up. It tastes like a desert!

I made changes as recommended by Melissa, Nov 19, 2007 and I'm glad I did. Baking the potato is an excellent way to go, adds much more flavor. I had a few sweet potato pie lovers at my table and they declared this BETTER than sweet potato pie!  It will make a return appearance at my house!

I used 2  sweet potatos that I  had in the fridge which I didn't know what to do with. I also added a half cup leftover cooked carrots and butternut squash that I had from the other night. 
I  mixed the sweet potato/carrot/ butternut mixer in the food processor for extra flufines and instead of using butter I used 'Promiss'  which allows us to eat this dish without it being dairy. I through away the yokes of the two eggs and only used the whites....much healthier. No need to add all of the sugar that the recipe calles for. I used a quater cup of brown sugar instead of a three quarters and a quarter cup of the flour instead of a half ....it is more than enough. 
I would highly reccomend this recipe...it's very memorable. Go For It.....Maya:-D

I did what other reviewers did and substituted evaporated milk for the regular, baked the sweet potatoes instead, and added a pinch of nutmeg and cinnamon to mixture.  I also think it's better when you cut down on the sugar a bit.  I've brought this to Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner for the past 2 years now, and everyone loves it!!

Excellent recipe!  I made it for Christmas dinner and received rave reviews!  I made two changes: I used yams, not sweet potatoes, and quite a bit more than the recipe called for (5 large yams, which came to probably 7 or 8 cups, rather than 4).  I also kept the pecans whole, rather than chopped, which made it look really elegant.  Everyone loved it -- I've already been asked to bring it next year. Thanks!

This was a huge hit.  I try to cut back on sugar.  For my taste I skipped the 1/2 cup of white sugar.  There is lots of sweetness in the topping so was fine without it.  This was a huge hit when served with our turkey dinner this Christmas.  Definitely a keeper.

I've never been a fan of the yam/marshmallow concoction, but THIS recipe is right up my alley!!! It was PERFECT and is now a staple for our holiday parties!  I paired it with spiral ham sandwiches with baby swiss on kaiser rolls for Christmas Eve.  AWESOME!

Really good.  Even better if you tone down the brown sugar topping (it's a bit too sweet).  I ate this and loved it and I'm not a sweet potato fan.  Made it for Thanksgiving and will make it again for Christmas!

Delicious!  It tasted more like a dessert than potatoes.  I put in the required whie sugar.  Next time I will put in less or put in brown sugar.  I thought the white sugar seemed a bit to sweet.

I have tried several different sweet potato casserole recipes over the years, always to be disappointed. This one didn't disappoint! I used three sweet potatoes that were quite large, so i had more than 4 cups of cubed potatoes. I added a full teaspoon of vanilla. When the sweet potatoes were cooked, I didn't completely mash them smooth. I left them a little lumpy for texture. Other than that, I followed the recipe quantities exactly. No changes were made and the finished product turned out perfect. This was far and away the very best sweet potato casserole I have ever had. The family and friends who were here for Thanksgiving requested it again for Christmas. That is a first for any recipe! Thank you, Tina B! This recipe is a true keeper!

I made this for Thanksgiving because the reviews were so great.  I remember candied sweet potatoes as a kid and always loved them.  I don't often add them on to my holiday meal because I've never found one to rave about.  This was no exception.....my guests were effusive about the meal but not because of this casserole.  It was nice but it is worth it to try another.  One day I'll find myself a kid again !

Those who ate this loved it!  They were upset there wasn't more to eat as leftovers.  I used 5 sweet potatoes and I also baked them and then mixed them with the rest of the ingredients.  I used a slightly smaller (old pyrex rectangular dish from refrigerator set) because it seemed like 9x13 would be too big.  I also only used half the milk called for and I used Japanese Sweet potatoes, they are yellow not orange, but they said they taste the same. I don't like sweet potatoes so I didn't even try it-though they said I should.

DELICIOUS!! I tried this recipe for a potluck Christmas dinner. I followed this recipe along with tips from other users. I used 4 medium sized sweet potatoes, which even after 50 minutes in the oven at 375 were not quite finished. I finished them off in the microwave for 5 minutes each. Despite what people said, I found it extremely difficult to get the peels off after baking (I have never cooked them before so I may have been doing it wrong). I substituted milk for evaporated milk, I doubled the vanilla and the recipe for the pecan topping. I only used 1/4 cup of sugar for the potatoes, and they were still very sweet. I used the Magic Bullet to blend the sweet potatoes to a smooth texture before adding to the dish. Aside from struggling with the peels at the very last minute, this recipe was pretty easy to make and easy to do on a student budget. It went over so well that I didn't even get to bring any leftovers home!

Made this the night before Thanksgiving and kept the topping separate until I baked it after the turkey came out of the oven.  It was amazing.  I loved it and so did all my guests.

This is THE BEST recipe, even people who don't usually like sweet potatoes will love it! Only suggestion is to add additional butter and pecans to the topping.

I loved this recipe! I made it exact for Thanksgiving-the only thing i did not end up doing was putting all the brown sugar mixture over the top....i thought it was a bit too much-i also put it in a 9 x 9 casserole and didn't think that it was too much-just enough actually-i will make this again, my kids loved it and my husband actually liked it too and he doesn't care for sweet potato.....nice recipe.

Easy and delicious. I've always baked the sweet potatoes (400 degrees for about an hour or so) so that is the only thing I did differently. Everyone loved it.

These were great!  I will be making this again in the future!  Everyone that tried it at Thanksgiving liked it.  The only ones that didn't try it were my wife's side of the family.  They were deprived growing up and weren't introduced to the goodness of sweet potatoes.

This recipe was good.  I don't care for nuts so I left out the pecans.  It was very sugary.  I may cut down on the brown sugar next time.  I think most people would like this dish.

I cooked this for Thanksdiving dinner and it was a hit! It disappeared in about 15 minutes and everyone wanted the recipe.  The only thing I changed was I baked the potatoes instead of boiling them.  It was very easy to separate the potato from the skin after baking for 1 1/2 hours at 400.  (Make sure you place the foil-wrapped potatoes in a cookie sheet so it won't drip into your oven).  The other thing I did was when I mixed up the topping, I did it with a few whirs in my food processer.  The butter mixed into the flour and sugar perfectly this way.  Then I stirred in the pecans at the end.  Fabulous recipe---will definitely be making again.

This was amazing!  Very rich and yummy.  I can't have diary, so I substituted almond milk and it still turned out fantastic.  I was skeptical when I took it out of the oven, as it looked a little flat, but it was so delicious.  My favorite dish this Thanksgiving!

This was made by friends who hosted Thanksgiving and it is VERY yummy!   To accommodate special dietary restriction (Gluten Intolerance) they substituted gluten free flour instead of all purpose and don't think it made taste or texture any different. I tend to be fairly picky when it comes to sweet potato casseroles, but this recipe has been saved so that it can be made in our house soon!

The basics are here -- but the recipe as it stands was way too sweet for our family. The yams themselves were pretty good as it stands -- but since they have sugar in them, the sweet topping is just overwhelming. Next time,I'll make the topping with more nuts, less brown sugar, and use less topping over all. It just needs a little topping to add some crunch -- not to add sweetness.

I made this for thanksgiving this year.  It was amazing!  Even my sister-in-law who usually likes her own sweet potatos best loved it and said I needed to make it again next year.  I baked my potatos instead of boiling, other that I followed the recipie.

This is a keeper!  Made it for Thanksgiving and it was gone fast.  I took the advise of other reviewers and baked the sweet potatoes first, but I think if your in a hurry microwaving them would work just as good.  This will be good for an anytime side.

LOVE THIS RECIPE! My Grandma has made this almost exact versions since I was little, so I was shocked to see it on here. I have a couple changes that make it perfect. I mix in 1 tsp of cinnamon with the sweet potatoes and only one egg because two seems to make it too soupy. I also just use a wooden spoon to break it down and not a blender because we like it to not be too pureed. I add a little more sweet potatoes and use a 8x11 glass baking dish. Even my Boyfriend likes these and he never likes any sweet potatoes.

I was never a fan of sweet potatoes, however after I made this for Thanksgiving this year, it was the best dish that I've had in a while. The only change that I made was that I didn't mash the potatoes, I chopped them. I WOULD DEFINITELY recommend this dish.

I've never made sweet potatoes before and to be honest, I'm not a very good chef. This was my first time attempting this recipe and my boyfriend and I absolutely loved it! followed suggestions and baked the potatoes rather than boiling them. the pecans are such a nice alternative to gooey marshmallows and the entire dish is simply delicious, even the second and third day after. fantastic!

This recipe was easy and tasted delicious! I baked my potatoes and added a little bit of pumpkin pie spice to the topping, although it would have been great without it too. I will use this again!

I've made this dish 3 times so far, and each time it is absolutely delicious.  Two of the times that I made it, I baked the potatoes.  I didn't have enough time to do last time, so I microwaved them.  I don't remember how long, but my microwave has a potato setting.  It tasted just as good as the other two times. Sooooo good!

I tried this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving.  I followed the directions as written.  It turned out better than any other sweet potatoes I've ever had.  All our guests agreed.  This is an easy to make, and very delicious recipe.

Good recipe.  I baked 4 large sweet potatoes instead of boiled (to preserve the nutrients).  It was a bit sweet but will cut back on the sugar next time.

Ok, let me start off by saying that I do not like sweet potatoes. BUT, I felt obligated to make something for the sweet potato fans at Thanksgiving. Oh My Goodness! It is awesome. Everyone had seconds - including me and the other "I am not a sweet potato fan" members. I had to make copies of the recipe for everyone. I made everything except the topping the day before. I followed the recipe exactly. However, I did not bake it, but put it in the fridge. On thanksgiving, I added the topping and then baked it. This is definitely a keeper. And I like being able to make it a day ahead. I guess I am now a sweet potato fan!

We loved this casserole! The only thing I added was 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. nutmeg to the casserole. I cooked it in a 9x9 dish and added 20 minutes to the cooking time. Until a toothpick came out clean. 
i will make it again.

I got rave reviews for this recipe on Thanksgiving. I used red yams instead of the sweet potato and microwaved the potatoes for mashing. Came out of skins perfectly.

Good recipe. Yummy topping! I also recommend baking the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them. Boiling tends to cause the dish to be a bit on the bland side. Baked sweet potatoes yield more flavor. also ....
I think a smaller baking dish should be used. The potatoes barely covered the bottom of a 9x13" .

This recipe was AMAZING! I have never liked any type of sweet potato bake especially ones with marshmellows on top yuck! But i was having a large family gathering and I know they love sweet potato bakes so I found this recipe. It was so so so easy to make! I made it about 3 hours ahead of time, covered it in aluminum foil and  put it in the fridge until I was ready to bake it. I would suggest doubling or even tripling the pecan topping however, I didn't seem to have enough. Turned out great! I loved it, it tastes amazing. I was begged for this recipe :) will make every year from now on! Thanks for a great recipe

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving this year. It was super easy, used ingredients that I had on hand so I didn't need to go to the store, and it turned out fantastic. They were the best sweet potatoes I've ever had. Usually when I take sweet potatoes I come home with a pan still half full. These were gobbled up. Thanks!

Both my husband and I who don't like sweet potatoes LOVED this.  Many compliments at Thanksgiving dinner and requests to make this again.  I took the recommendation of several others to bake the sweet potatoes before hand rather than boil them.  I think that made a huge difference.  I blended everything together in the Ninja and it came out nice and smooth.  I'm looking for excuses to make this again!

I was tasked with bringing sweet potatoes to Thanksgiving this year. I don't like sweet potatoes and didn't have any idea how to make them. Found this recipe and OMG, it was wonderful.  I followed the recipe as is and LOVED it, I didn't think it was too sweet at all.  I doubled the recipe but then tripled the topping (it's the best part). Still don't think I would like regular sweet potatoes, but loved this even leftover the next day!

My family really enjoys this recipe.  I add cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, honey, brown sugar & pecans into the potato mixture it just adds more flavor.  I also add a pinch of cinnamon to the topping.

I made this recipe this Thanksgiving. As always, when I make something for the first time I do not change any ingredients. I did however,bake the sweet potatoes and made a little more topping.  My family loved it !!!! I made a double batch so I have some leftover...I'm tempted to have them for breakfast !!!!!!

I made this for the first time for today's Thanksgiving dinner. IT WAS A HIT! I definitely took other's advice about it being overly sweet, so I made it without sugar entirely!! I also read that others doubled the vanilla extract to 1 tsp, which I also did.  So instead of putting sugar, I used pumpkin pie spiced marshmallows and chopped pecans on top.  This way, the sweet potato was highlighted without it tasting like a dessert during dinner.  (It's also guilt free because it isn't loaded with sugar, and didn't have to use the extra butter for the topping- double whammy!) :)

Wonderful, anytime Grandchildren will eat Sweet Potatoes and then ask for a second helping tells me that it must be very good.  They do not like chopped nuts in or on anything, so I just omitted putting the topping on part that could be served to them.  They really enjoyed the Sweet Potatoes this year so now it will be come a family tradition for every Thanksgiving.  My Daughter even ask for a copy of the recipe!

Oh wow.... this recipe was very yummy!  Not too sweet, but sweet enough.... the topping is what really set the dish out.  My man never cared for 'sweet potatoes', I was able to talk him into to tasting it and he said that it was quite tasty; much better than he expected, let along tasted!

Doubled the recipe. It is a new family favorite! delicious. It did not brown by 30 minutes. Its a new oven, i think the temperature is accurate. Keep it in for another 15 minutes. I will make this recipe again.

This wasn't bad really I just like my normal way of preparing sweet potatoes better. I was looking for a change so tried this. Mixed reviews from our guest, but most felt it had a desert taste over our savory version. I did eliminate the sugar in the potato mixture and did eliminate the eggs because it was looking like pumpkin pie rather than sweet potato's and I was already serving pie. The topping was very tasty but did add a little more sweetness than I was looking for.

BEST sweet potato dish EVER!! I did use all brown sugar, walnuts instead of pecans, and added 1 tsp cinnamon and 1/2 tsp allspice to the crumb topping. I baked at 350 alongside the turkey. I also did alternate horizontal stripes of crumb topping and marshmallows. This will be my go to sweet potato casserole for years to come.

Today.....on Thanksgiving, I had enjoyed some store-made Sweet Potato Casserole that I purchased at my local Stop & Shop. I was in absolute heaven while I was eating it!!! I read the ingredients on the back of the box, hoping to find a recipe online that came close to it so I can make it at home. When I saw 1307+ five star review ratings for this recipe (as of this posting date) I figured it must be a great dish. I read through the ingredients and it sure enough, it pretty much matches most of those on the Stop & Shop box. I cannot wait to make this homemade yummy dish!!! Thank you for posting this....and Happy Thanksgiving to All!!

This recipe is absolutely amazing!!  I had had another recipe as the one I was going to use for our Thanksgiving dinner, but found this one this morning when I logged on AR.  I had SO many rave reviews and there was not a drop left (and usually, it seems there's always a bunch left!)!  I did make one small change, seeing I was prepared with the other recipe to use canned sweet potatoes.  I merely took 4 cans of them, and whipped them like the recipe indicated.  Sped-up the whole process and still had a great flavor!  THANK YOU for such a great recipe, that not only tasted excellent, but was easy to make!

OH MY GOODNESS!! I cannot tell you how good this was and how easy to make!! For the past few years I have tried a different sweet potato casserole recipe at Thanksgiving. This year I tried this one and was blown away! It is definitely our favorite. Thanks for sharing this wonderful dish.

Absolutely delish! Even my hubbie who does not like sweet potatoes liked it enough to go back for seconds! I unintentionally bought yellow sweet potatoes at the farmers market, which seem to be a bit milder flavor. The only change I made was using all brown sugar. This is a keeper! Thank you!

Fantastic!! My whole family (who normally likes marshmallows on their casserole) raved about this! All I did differently was roast the sweet potatoes for about 1.5 hours and squeeze them into a measuring cup. I measured 4 cups of cooked potatoes and then made the rest as is! WONDERFUL!! Thank you for sharing this!

I started making this three years ago and my family asks me to make it every thanksgiving! It is my favorite dish, though i think some may find it a little too sweet so i generally cut down on the sugar. By far the best sweet potato casserole i have ever had. I especially like the pecans on top with the sugar and flour instead of the traditional marshmallow topping. Great for any big family event!

I loved this recipe! It is more like a crustless sweet potato pie desert than the casseroles I've made in the past, but fantastic just the same. I love baked sweet potatoes like some reviewers mentioned, but I prepared this exactly as the recipe stated with boiled sweet potatoes and I couldn't have asked for a more tasty dish! I will definitely use this recipe again!

I thought it was a great and simple recipe. I added some cinnamon to the sweet potatoes to give them more flavor. But the recipe was great and easy to follow!!! My co-workers loved it, so I'm making it for Thanksgiving!!!!

I have made a variation on this recipe for many years.  I use heavy cream instead of milk, and walnuts instead of pecans.  We call it Sweet Potato Souffle.  It is absolutely delicious.  It is so sweet, many have said it should be a dessert, like a sweet potato pie, instead of a vegetable served with dinner.

I've thrown my marshmellows away after finding this recipe several years ago.  Being from Texas, we like a little more "spice" so I add a tsp of cinnamon, 1/4 tsp of cloves and nutmeg.  Half-n-half instead of milk makes this creamier too.  It's a shame Thanksgiving and Christmas only come once a year.

I have been making this for the past 3 years and it is the most requested dish for all holiday meals.  It is AWESOME!  However, for those who don't like "sweet" with their sweet potatoes, it may not be their favorite.  I also use brown sugar instead of white and add a bit of cinnamon to the topping.

I was very surprised how yummy this was!! I was so hesitant when making it for our thanksgiving dinner that I made regular potatoes as a back up :P This will likely now be a yearly staple for this festive meal.

Made it exact to recipe... all I changed was adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg to the potato mixture and baking (not boiling) the potatoes. Best sweet potato dish ever - brought it to a dinner party last night and everyone raved about it!

This is ABSOLUTELY yummy!!  I usually add 1 tsp. cinnamon, 1/4 tsp. cloves, and 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to the sweet potato mixture.  It gives it a bit of pumpkin pie flair.  Every time I serve this everyone raves about it.

Wow! This is really good! I tried it since I had 2 sweet potatoes. I also baked the potatoes for 45 min at 400*. Since i only had 2 potatoes and the mix was pretty soupy, I only added 1/4 evaporated milk.

YUM!  This turned out great.  I didn't have real butter or flour on hand and made it with the fake stuff and no flour in the topping and it was devoured!  I also used half white sugar and half brown sugar in the mix.  My friends loved it and ate every last bit of it!

I have made this sweet potato casserole for years.  It always get rave reviews.  I did change it some.  I didn't add the milk, and I added 1 full tsp of vanilla. Didn't use the brown sugar, just white sugar.  For the topping, I use 1 C brown sugar, 1/3 C margarine, 1/3 C flour, and 1 C chopped pecans.  Mix all ingredients together and spoon on top of potatoes.  The potatoes are so sweet, I usually don't make the topping.

My boyfriend usually doesn't like sweet potatoes, but he liked this! It could almost be a dessert.  I boiled the potatoes as the recipe stated (because I didn't have the oven space for roasting like other reviewers suggested) and felt the flavor came out great!

I followed as directed and added a little cinnamon and pumpkin spice per other reviews and this turned out absolutely amazing!  This was the best sweet potato casserole I've ever had, everyone loved it.  Next time, I will reduce the sugar for family health reasons but I'm sure it will still be delicious.

Superb! This was a huge hit with my Thanksgiving crowd. I 3/4'ed the recipe, as I was only havng 12 guests and at least three of them didn't like sweet potatoes. I used two sweet potatoes, which I baked for an hour. Next time, I would bake them longer, as I couldn't get a smooth consistency. I added a little cinnamon and topped with marshmallows. I will definitely be making this again!

Oh my gosh, this puts you in a butter coma!  It's amazing and so delicious!  The crumble is made with butter and the mashed sweet potatoes are made with butter all coming out to a real southern classic side dish.  I see lots of people saying that you should bake your potatoes instead of boil them but I boiled mine and it still came out absolutely perfect.  I got lots of compliments.  Only advice is to peel your sweet potatoes BEFORE you chop, boil and mash them. It will make your life easier.  Good luck!

I made it this Thanksgiving and the family loved it. I used glazed pecans instead of the regular chopped pecans and my youngest son raved about the topping...and he doesn't even like nuts! This is a nice alternative to traditional yams. Thanks Tina B!

This is a fantastic recipe!  I made this dish yesterday as part of my first full Thanksgiving dinner I made on my own, and it was a hit.  Even my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about good this dish was and he's not a fan of sweet potatoes.  The few changes I made was that I used a little more than 4 cups of potato, baked it in a smaller casserole dish and omitted the pecans since I didn't have any on hand.  It still came out perfect and I'll definitely be making this every Thanksgiving from now on.

DELICIOUS!!!! I baked rather than boiled the potatoes and cut down on sugar and butter, and this was the hit of the Thanksgiving table.

Very tasty, but next time I will cut back on the sugar. It is more along the lines of dessert than a side dish with that much sugar. Granted very tasty and the pecans make it extra festive.

Every year we make the same sweet potato dish with marshmallows.  This year I decided to try something different. I tried this recipe as is and it was wonderful! So good in fast 3 different relatives fought about who was going to take home the leftovers. This will now be  my annual sweet potato casserole dish.

This was a great recipe.  I added one 10.5 bag of small marshmallows to the top to add an extra sweet touch to the dish, but it was amazing as is and probably didn't need it!  The whole family ranted and raved about it, including 91-year-old grandpa.

the reviews were absolutely correct - this was a big hit at the thanksgiving table today!  my 78-year old father said it was the best sweet potato dish he has ever had.  five of us sat down to dinner and we hardly have any of this casserole leftover for tomorrow.  
i baked 3 large potatoes, used 1/3 cup sugar and a little less butter than the recipe called for and it was perfectly sweet and flavorful.  thank you!

My only complaint about this recipe is that now I have to make this every Thanksgiving!  We were all looking for something different this year and I volunteered this - we had never had sweet potatos for large family gatherings.  This was the hit of Thanksgiving dinner this year.  Yum!

Left out the eggs, & salt.  Used non-fat milk & reduced the butter to 1 1/2 T in topping & 1 1/2 in potatoes.  Topping was not at all oily & crisped up nicely even though it didn't look like it did.  So impressed with this recipe!  Thanks

This recipe is a WINNER and a classic.  I've been making this for 20+ years (except I mash the sweet potatoes rather than cube them), and it is ALWAYS a request whenever I am contributing to a pot luck meal.  It's the BEST sweet potato recipe I've ever tasted.

I made this for Thanksgiving and am just rating it now!  It was amazing!  I only used 1/4 cup of sugar, I used evaporated milk and added cinnamon.  I was worried it would be too sweet but it was perfect.  The topping was to die for!  My husband said I should double it next time.

Delicious!  Definitely a new Thanksgiving tradition for my family.  I double the filling, but not the topping and bake in a 9x13 pan.

I love this recipe! Super easy to make and so delicious!  The only change I made was to microwave the sweet potatoes until they were soft instead of chopping and boiling them (I hate chopping sweet potatoes!)

Very easy and very tasty! Just don't add the beaten egg to hot butter like I did, which cooked the egg slightly. Recipe recommended.

This was super good and sweet.  Kids ate it up.  It is very sweet.  I doubled the recipe for xmas dinner.  Could have cut back a bit on the white sugar and I only used 3 eggs when i doubled the recipe.  Thanks for recipe.  I am expected to make it next year too!

My first time ever making a sweet potato dish and this was fantastic!  Everybody loved it.  I didn't have any milk, so I used French Vanilla coffee creamer instead; also added some cinnamon.  This will become a Christmas staple!

The first time I made this dish (Thanksgiving) it received so many rave reviews that I had to make it again immediately to accommodate all the leftovers!  I agree with those who say to double the amount for the topping.  I also added a bit of cinnamon to the topping.  You WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IN THIS DISH!  It is amazing!

This was my first time making a sweet potato casserole.  It turned out quite well. I used three large sweet potatoes, baked them at 375 for 1hr 15min. I also added nutmeg and cinnamon to the mash.  The one thing I will change next time is add a little more sugar and vanilla (though my parents thought the sweetness was perfect). The pecan topping is absolutely delicious! Good recipe!

POTATOES: Microwaved potatoes and that worked, though was hard to measure 4 cups--i'd suggest, if you cut in smallish cubes before microwaving/cooking potatoes, that you go for about 8 cups (w/the understanding that there'll be some spaces in b/w all the potato cubes in the measuring cup).   DOUBLING AMOUNTS: As Melissa suggested in the comments, i did half the sugar, double vanilla and double the topping ingredients (ie, the 2nd half of the recipe ingredients that are listed w/a space before them).   AMOUNT: This barely covered bottom of a 11x13, and though it cooked ok, i think i could've doubled all the ingredients and filled the casserole dish a lot better.   TOPPING: As someone mentions int he comments, i couldn't spread the topping, so i've got to look back at the comments for suggestions on that...

good taste but could have used a little more topping in my opinion. I did half the recipe and the pan size was a little off so that could have contributed to the thickness of the topping.

We tried this on Thanksgiving 2010.  My family loved it, even those that didn't like sweet potatos. Adjustments:   I topped it miniature marshmellows... put them on about the last five minutes of the baking time until they are golden brown and gooey, delish!

This was a big hit at my office potluck.  I even used Splenda sugar (whatever recipe asked for).  I used the Green Giant Steam Sweet Potatos and they worked great saved on hours of baking sweet potatos.

My first time making this and it was a BIG hit for Thanksgiving. I took the advice of several reviews. Instead of boiling the sweet potatoes I peeled, cubed, rinsed with water then baked them covered at 350 for about 45mins. Instead of using milk, I used heavy cream making it taste richer. And for the topping, I made double to cover up the whole pan and sprinkled pumpkin pie spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and cloves). It came out a little too sweet for me (maybe the sweet potatoes were already sweet) but everyone loved it and went back for seconds. Definitely be making this next year but maybe with 1/3 cup of white sugar. Thanks for the great recipe!

I followed this recipe to a "T".  I'm sorry, I did not care for this recipe at all.  I didn't like the sweet potato mixture, it lacked flavor to me and I also didn't like the topping.  I will stick with my traditional candied sweet potatoes or the traditional sweet potato casserole with orange juice and marshmallows on top.

AAAAAAAAAAA-Mazing! Absolutely loved this! I was asked to bring it to two different Thanksgiving dinners this year because it's such a hit. I goofed up at first and put a 1/2 cup brown sugar in the actually yam mixture, and then also in the 'topping.' Worked great either way! This is definitely a keeper.

Followed the recipe except as other people have suggested, I baked the yams at 375 for 90 minutes and scooped out the insides.  Also, the first time I made this I had no idea what "cutting butter" meant... it means to use a pastry cutter to cut the butter.   I also doubled the amount of pecans it calls for.

This was a good recipe..I think next time I will use half as much sugar...it was a little sweet for me. I did bake the potatoes instead on boiling them. It was a breeze to scoop them out of the skin.

SOOOO delicious!  I used part milk and part orange juice, which allowed me to cut down on the amount of sugar used.  I also used a whole tsp of vanilla rather than 1/2 tsp.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed this recipe at Thanksgiving dinner!  I will definitely make this again.

This recipe is fantastic!! I cooked it Thanksgiving and everyone loved it! The only thing I did differently was sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg in with the potatoes and a little with the topping...SO  GOOD! And next time I think I will add even more pecans to the topping, just because I love 'em :) Thanks so much!

I made this recipe for the first time this Thanksgiving. I followed the adviced on all the reviews, i BAKED four sweet baked potatoes (about 1.5-2hrs), I also used brown sugar instead of white, and evaporated instead of regular milk. It was super yummy! it wasn't overly sweet, it was perfect. I also used more pecans for the top.

This is a very good recipe, but it really does not serve 12. For a hungry gathering, you could really DOUBLE the potato mixture part -- you'd need about 5 good-size sweet potatoes altogether. (The topping, of course, does not need to be increased.)

Being a Yankee married to a southern boy, I thought I'd try to wow him in the kitchen for Thanksgiving.  Well it worked.  I used 1/2 the sugar and it was just perfect for his sweet tooth.  I also added a pinch of cinnamon and nutmeg to the mixture and then sprinkled cinnamon on top before I spread the brown sugar mixture on.  It smelled wonderful baking in the oven and was a hit at dinner.

Super yummy! My husband hates sweet potatoes and he liked this! I made them for Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house and everyone loved them! My 3 year old kept saying 'mommy, I wuv these.' I baked 5 large sweet potatoes and doubled the topping amount. Will def make again.

I brought this recipe to Thanksgiving and my sister actually asked me for the recipe. No one EVER asks me for recipes. The dish was delicious and I don't even like pecans. Next time I make this, I will double the recipe because it goes fast. The only change I made was I added 1/2 c of marshmallows in the last 10 mins of baking. It came out awesome!

This was a good recipe, just nothing special for me.  I doubled the recipe, used apple sauce in place of the white sugar, omitted the butter from the "souffle", and didn't double the amount of mix. It was very light and not overly sweet. I liked it alot.  The topping was good. I don't know what I was expecting, but I wasn't "wowed." I guess it's because I'm not crazy about overly sweet, and the topping was definately sweet. NOTE: I about passed out at the price of pecans, but there are instances when nothing else will do, and this is one of those instances!

I've never been a fan of sweet potato casserole, but this was amazing.  I couldn't stop eating it, and everyone else had double servings as well.  The crunchy topping really makes the dish, and it was really fast and easy to make.

These were delicious! I baked my sweet potatoes in the oven instead of boiling them and they mashed beautifully and had a better flavor than if boiled. I didn't have any pecans on hand so I used walnuts. Great recipe, will be making this again.

I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it ! I followed the recipe given with the exception of microwave baking the fresh sweet potatoes to cut down on time and "gutting" them afterwards for the mash. It didn't hurt a bit. Even the ones who were not big fans of sweet potato casseroles commented on how good it was. It WAS yummy ! This is a keeper !

I made this in my crock pot - about 3 hours and it turned out fantastic! The topping really compliments this dish. I did add a bit more white sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. I like it sweet:) Thanks for the recipe.

Very, very good recipe. Just made it for Thanksgiving. The whole family raved about it. Even the ones that don't dig yams.  Next time I will try mixing in a 1/4 evap milk to make the yam mix more creamy. Thanks for a great recipe!

This dish was awesome. It was a last minute addition for me that turned out great. I did make a few changes. Along with the vanilla extract I added a touch of almond extract that gave the dish a wonderful flavor. I also substituted walnuts for the pecans. This recipe has now been added to my holiday line-up.

now im no southerner, so this may very well be a perfect recipe for what this dish should taste like, but i def thought it was too sweet.  I baked the potato like others suggested and other than that followed the recipe exactly.  If i make again, ill prob cut down on that.  i made this for a thanksgiving potluck but it wasnt a toootal hit.  i think it depends on the crowd tho, must have misread them!  Overall, though, it did taste good, even if a bit too sweet!

I made this for Christmas last year and it was a MAJOR hit. I was so impressed, so was my family! Definitely something to share and make EVERY year :)  I also used caramelized pecans and it made a gooey crunchy topping tasted like a pecan pie on top.

Yummy and easy recipe. I changed it a little and will again change it next time I cook it as it was much too sweet for my liking and will try half the amount of sugar within the recipe casserole. I used egg replacement and soy milk instead of the usual and also used Kumera (sweet potato) instead of regular ones and it turned out yummy. I was wondering if anyone has some ideas for a vegetarian protein to eat with this dish?

I was looking for an alternative, reduced fat version to Praline Sweet potatoes (also from this site) that I've been making for the past five years. This one fit the bill and tasted fantastic!

Absolutely amazing.  The only thing I did differently was to use only 2 tbs. of sugar in the sweet potato mixture.

I have never liked sweet potatoes and really didn't want something that was very sweet or dessert-like.  This recipe has made me a sweet potato fan.  I oven roasted the potatoes and doubled the vanilla as others suggested.

This recipe was a bit of a nightmare for me.  It came out looking like soup and I had to add so much flour to make it the 'right' consistency that I lost track of how much I put in.  HOWEVER, after I thickened it up, it was amazing.  I agree with the other commentors who said it is much more like a Sweet Potato Pie Filling.

This recipe is what sweet potatoes were meant for.  Wow!!!!  This was rich, creamy and the perfect combination of textures.  I followed the recipe exactly and did not change a thing.  This is somewhat unusual for me but it is perfect as is.  You will not be disappointed.  Give it a try and see for yourself!!!

Great dish! Only used 1/4 cup white sugar in the base and only did 1/2 the topping (except for the pecans--used the 1/2 cup as stated). Also added 1/4 tsp cinnamon to the topping then sprinkled more on top before it went in the oven. Think I will try cutting down on the butter in the base next time--I don't think it needs it.

I have made this twice now, and it is always a huge hit! I'm not a fan of Sweet Potato Casserole, but my friends and family always rave about it. I baked the potatoes instead of boiling, based on other reviews. I used skim milk, and for the topping I used the splenda/brownsugar blend. I used a 6 oz bag of pecans and pulsed them in the food processor to chop them up. Everything else I did according to the recipe. Thanks for a successful recipe!!!!!!!!

Very good!  Only next time I will use a third of the amount of sugar the recipe suggested, a half a cup was a bit too sweet.  Sweet potatoes are naturally sweet so I don't think that much sugar is needed.  My husband loved it all the same....

I loved this casserole and all of the family loved it as well. I did modify the recipe by skipping on the extra 1/2 cup of white sugar (it was plenty sweet enough without the extra sugar). I also added a layer of glazed half-pecans to the top of the dish which which really added to the flavor.

My entire family of 20 on Thanksgiving absolutely LOVED this... said it's the best sweet potatoes they've ever had! I baked the potatoes, added a little vanilla and a pinch of cinnamon. The pecans and brown sugar really make this dish wonderful.

Good, but the topping did not crumble over the casserole, it was in big clumps.  May need to try another topping.

This casserole was delicious!  I prepared it for Thanksgiving dinner and everyone loved it!  The only change that I made was to double the crust recipe.  A great variation from the traditional Thanksgiving dish.

My family has been asking me to bring this for holiday meals ever since I first made it in 2009. Over the years I have tweaked it and this is what I do now: use 1 egg, omit the white sugar and use only half recipe for the topping. And I always use more than 4 cups of potatoes so that the dish goes further. We love it!

Everyone liked this.  It was a great balance of savory and sweet...not overwhelming in sweetness like so many recipes I've tried.  I knocked the sweetness down further by increasing the amount of sweet potato to 6-7 cups of cubed.  I couldn't figure out how 4 cups would feed 12 people...not in my family anyway!

I made this for Thanksgiving and an early Christmas celebration.  Everyone on both sides of the family loved it.  I doubled the recipe.  I used 5 sweet potatoes and roasted them in the oven.  I definitely think that brings out their full flavor.  I used evaporated milk like another reviewer suggested.  This was super easy to make and so delicious.

Definitely had to double the vanilla and the topping mix, but other than that... WONDERFUL!  The brown sugar topping was a huge hit, it reheated beautifully, and I soooo prefer it to it's marshmallow topped counterpart!

Very tasty, especially the topping.  Per others suggestions I baked the potatoes (which compliments their sweetness) in foil in the oven for 1.5 hrs at 325 degrees along side my turkey.  Then I mashed, mixed with the other ingredients, and blended with my hand mixer to make them ultra smooth.  The only change I made was to use only 1 egg instead of 2. Awesome - will make again.

This was excellent. I halved the recipe and made two batches, one with the pecan topping (my favorite) and one with marshmallows for my husband, who insisted that it wasn't thanksgiving without the marshmallows. I will definitely make this again next year.

Oh my gosh was this good.  This is the first time that I have made sweet potato casserole for a Holiday and it was a hit.  My niece took the rest home.  I didn't change a thing.  I will definitely be making for my Dad at Christmas.

I made this tonight to rave reviews. A few variations, I baked the sweet potatoes and added a banana during baking as suggested by another reviewer. I omitted the sugar in the potato mash as I had added the sweetness of the banana. I also used about an 1/8 c up heavy cream instead of milk. 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 of nutmeg. I made the topping as written. I'm not a big fan of sweet potato casserole but this turned out terrific!

This was very scrumptious!  I doubled the recipe with no problems.  I was in a rush making this, so I raised the temperature to 375 degrees and baked it for about 20-25 minutes.  Turned out excellent.  Was a hit at Thanksgiving with the entire family!

My husband thought this casserole was delicious but liked it even better with marshmallows on top.  He put the oven on broil for a few minutes to toast the marshmallows on top.  I preferred it without the marshmallows.  It was just sweet enough.  Thank you!

This recipe turned out fantastic. I took the advice of some of the other commenters and baked the sweet potatos. Everything turned out awesome. The tipping really made it! Will make again.

This recipe is quite easily the star of my Thanksgiving repertoire. I have to double the recipe and it still disappears. It actually bakes up into a light and fluffy sweet potato mixture, which is beautifully offset by the crunchy streusel. It killed my mom that we had to axe the old marshmellow/yam dish, but once we tasted this we have never missed candied yams. Thank you!!

This is the first recipe I've ever tried that was worth a comment. This recipe is absolutely DELICIOUS with a great texture to add to a giant holiday feast (or a ham, for that matter). I can't wait to have a reason to make it again. Thanks for sharing it!

This was fantastic. I used the recalculation tool and doubled the recipe. It was great to have left overs and I was asked for the recipe. I did add just a sprinkle of nutmeg and cinnamon which was an idea from another reviewer. Since the reviews were so great for the recipe as is...I did not want to change but the idea of cinnamon and nutmeg with sweet potato sounded good...so I just sprinkled in a small amount and one friend said she liked the hint of nutmeg. The pecan topping was excellent. Like other reviewers I baked the potatoes first. This is definitely a keeper.

Love the recipe, but you need to add a lot more spices and seasons because it is bland if not added. I added cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon flavor, a little more sugar, and vanilla and nut flavoring. The topping is great!!! I would melt the butter in the microwave though before adding it to the mix.

DELICIOUS! I made this for my Thanksgiving dinner today, and it was excellent, everyone loved it. I did only use 1/4 cup sugar, and a teaspoon of cinnamon and nutmeg. Other then that keep everything the same.

These were a big hit at my thanksgiving.  I've never made sweet potatoes before and was looking for something my guest would have never tried.  I did well in choosing this recipe!  I will probably cut down on the sugar next time.  These potatoes will be a permanent addition to my thanksgiving menu!

I followed the recipe exactly except that I used a large can of sweet potatoes rather than fresh potatoes.  It was delicious and my family loved it!! I'm sure I'll be making it again soon.

I followed recipe exactly and I did not care for this. It was too runny and too mushy and to icky. It was okay coming right out of the oven, but I just got done eating the leftovers for lunch and ugh I had a hard time finishing them. I will keep looking for a sweet potato recipe thanks for the try.

I made this for Thanksgiving for my in-laws.  Everyone really enjoyed but myself.  I thought it turned out way too runny (I followed the directions exactly).  It was very sweet, but everyone liked that.  If it would have been firmer, I probably would have enjoyed it more.

This was very yummy! I used splenda in place of the sugar and also the splenda brown sugar mix.  I used 1 t. vanilla and added a dash of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. I found the topping to be the right amount for it and am glad I didn't double it like some have mentioned.

I am a little late in writing this review.  I made this dish for Thanksgiving instead of my traditional canned, smashed, sweet potatoes with marshmellows on top and it was delicious.  This is now my sweet potato recipe for holidays.  I did follow suggestions to bake the sweet potatoes instead of boiling them.  Thanks for the recipe and suggestions in the review section of this web site.

Everyone loved this variation of sweet potatoes.  I baked the sweet potatoes first and then the skins came right off and it gave them better flavor.  It was quite yummy!  Thank you!

This casserole was the hit of Thanksgiving! I followed it to the "t" and it came out so beautifully! I had to leave the leftovers with my in-laws because I was afraid I would wolf down the remaining! Truly a keeper for all Thanksgivings!!!

Mmmm!  Sweet potatoes are one of those things that are either ignored or gobbled up at our holiday table ... this one was definitely a favorite!  I did use fresh sweet potatoes (baked) and do think they're much better than canned.  Made the recipe just as it was.

I made this with sweet potatos for Thanksgiving and yams for Christmas...both were great.  I used Splenda brown sugar rather than regular (if you do this use 1/2 the sugar required).  It was such a huge sucess both times with 2 different groups.  GREAT recipe.

I cut the sugar in half and was really pleased with the result. Funny side note, I was a little tired when mixing this and added the flour into the mixture instead of the topping. It actually turned out a little souffle like and was lovely :) Big hit at Thanksgiving!

Just what I wanted for Thanksgiving. Not that sticky marshmallowy thing. Thank you I will use year round.  I pre baked the potatoed then peeled and diced them.

I made this for our church get together at Thanksgiving.  I baked four large sweet potatoes, doubled the topping, and used a 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan..  Everyone loved it!  I chose this recipe because it reminded me of my Aunt Gloria's. This is a great recipe, Thank you!!!

This was my first time making it, and it turned out really good! I got complements from people who don't even like sweet potatoes! 

*I used evaporated milk instead of regular. 

*And used "Egg Smarts" (from Costco) instead of regular eggs -its the same thing only they are fresher and last longer, and I don't have to deal with egg shells, plus its supposedly healthier too!

*I baked the sweet potatoes like everyone suggested and it was easier to peel the skin off. 

*I actually doubled the topping, although it WASN'T in my plans to do so from the beginning. I did it because there wasn't enough topping to cover the sweet potato mixture!!! Maybe my casserole dish is too long/big or something? 

Anyways Great dish, everyone loved it and I can't wait to make it again!

Absolutely wonderful! I think it complements other dishes very well because it is so sweet. Will add to my Thanksgiving/Christmas menu every year. I roasted the potatoes and ended up cooking the dish much longer than 30 minutes.

This recipe won rave reviews when I made it for two different Thanksgiving dinners this past week.  The first was a "vegan thanksgiving" and this recipe needed only a few changes for that: egg replacer, soy milk and vegan butter.  It was still so good that one guest said if there weren't other people in the kitchen, she would have licked the pan clean!  The regular way to make this recipe, which I did a few days later, was exactly as described: yummy!

This is an amazing recipe!  I've finally found a dish that my husband likes better than his mother's!  I used the original recipe and then made all the changes suggested by Melissa in the previous comment.  It was easier and much more delicious than I expected!  Thanks so much!!!

Great recipe. it is really quite easy and very versatile. i had to monkey with it quite a bit to fit a smaller pan and toaster oven and it was still fantastic. 

others have recommended cinnamon and i second that. also, i added some slightly rehydrated craisens and it came out great. and they are good w/o topping, w/ pecan crumble and w/ marshmallows

Wow! Excellent! I was a little worried the recipe would be too sweet. (I don't have much of a sweet tooth) However, it was DELICIOUS.  I think the best dish I served this thanksgiving.  So easy to make as well.

I made this for Thanksgiving & it was fantastic! Everyone loved it, even the people who usually don't touch anything orange! I think it was a tad sweet, so next time I'll cut the sugar down as suggested by other reviews.

Flavor was ok and texture was too mushy. Topping was just ok. I will not make this again as my family and in-laws did not like it either.

My family LOVED this dish!!! This year (2008) was my first time ever to make Thanksgiving dinner and this was a hit! Was gone before dinner was over! haha. I ran out of time so ended up boiling them instead of baking them as other reviewers recommended... and I didn't blend the sweet potato mixture in a blender or processor... I just mashed it all up together and then baked it. It was delicious!! My mother begged me for this recipe and it is now part of her recipe collection haha. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING!!

Very good dish! This is definitely a sweet and not a savory dish. I followed others' suggestions and cut the sugar in half, and I doubled the topping. I also added a little ground ginger for kicks and giggles. This dish went over very well with family and friends.

This dish had the perfect consistency and my guests loved it - though we all agreed that I didn't need to add sugar to the sweet potato mixture (maybe because I took previous reviewers' advice and roasted the potatoes instead of boiling them).  Next time I will make the recipe exactly as called for sans sugar.  The brown sugar/pecan crumble on top was delicious!

This was a big hit at our Thanksgiving this year!  I've had great sweet potato casseroles before, but this is the best!

Absolutely awesome.  I have never, ever liked sweet potatoes.  I made this recipe this year and it was amazing!  The topping ended up doubled because we split the sweet potato mixture between two 8x8 pans so that one could have the traditional marshmallow topping.  I will admit, we used canned yams (rinsed) for the recipe as my mother had already purchased them before I could go shopping for ingredients.

I have made this probably a dozen times. I usually follow the recipe with the exception of doubling the topping, as I have a huge sweet tooth. I have always used 4 large sweet potatoes and boiled them.

I recently read several reviews though, that suggested using yams and to bake them instead of boiling them. I decided to try it this past Thanksgiving.  The verdict: Myself and my guests much preferred the original way using sweet potatoes and boiling them. For someone like me, with my sweet tooth, the original recipe results in a much more custard-like texture and flavor than when I baked the yams, and tasted sweeter. It's almost like a dessert! I'll stick to the original recipe from now on, with the exception of doubling the topping.

This was so good.  We made it for thanksgiving, and as I tried some, I looked around the room, wondering if everyones' tastebuds were having a party in their mouth.  It was so quiet at our thanksgiving, because everyone was eating.  
Will make again and again.  
We didn't have a glass pan, so we used a skillet and stuck it in the oven.  Amazing taste, and it turned out great.

This is the best!  Baking the sweet potatoes does retain so much flavor, and they slip right out of their skin afterward also - much easier than peeling them raw.  My mother used to make this every Thanksgiving and Christmas, and after she passed away the recipe was lost.  Thank you, thank you!  It is just as delicious as she made, and now we have her tradition back.

This is very good! I especially liked the topping. I used canned sweet potatoes to save time, but I think next time I'll definitely use fresh sweet potatoes, as the canned ones came out a bit watery.

I took a gamble and made this casserole instead of our family's traditional baked sweet potatoes with marshmallows and this was the hightlight of our Thanksgiving.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was a great recipe and very tasty!  We didn't add the white sugar and it was still very sweet.  Instead of using brown sugar for the topping we replaced it with maple syrup instead.

Very good!  I thought it could have been a little bit sweeter, but all of my Thanksgiving guests gave it 2 HUGE thumbs up!  

I just boiled the potatoes (after peeling) and let my daughter mash away!  I was fun for both of us!

This was an awesome side dish for Thanksgiving!  My aunt made a special request for a casserole like this, which I'd never made.  I was going to roast the sweet potatoes in Catalina dressing, which is my new thing, but these were way better!  My aunt was pleased!

Yummy!  I got lazy and didn't want to take the time to mix up the topping but threw on marshmellows instead and I think it was just as good.  As recommended decrease sugar to 1/4 cup, I added the 4 T. butter, and only 1 large egg.  You can make this recipe easily to meet your taste.

Excellent! Even family that normally doesn't eat sweet potatoes loved this dish!!  Tip:  Double the Topping for double delicious taste!! : )
Also, I tried boiling half the potatoes and microwaving the other half (for speed) but they both took about the same amount of time and same taste. Great Dish! Thank you!! :)
