Everything that went into this dish is something I really like, so you can imagine my disappointment when it was done, and to me, it tasted very bland.  Nothing popped out and made it excellent.  Just my opinion.  It could be my old and worn out tastebuds.  More and more it seems I need strong flavors to really enjoy something these days.  Too many taste buds have died off I suppose.

This is such a delicious, versatile meal.  I didn't have the exact ingredients so made my own substitutions and it was a hit. So easy.

Considering the name of this recipe, I felt compelled to make this.  It was just OK for us, however, and maybe it was because I made my own soup (Mushroom Soup I) from this site.  The cheese I used was Colby jack .  My potatoes never did brown, even though they were mostly thawed when I put this dish in the oven.  The problem for us was that it was lacking in taste, so something I did wasn't quite up to par---maybe a mistake on my part along the way.  I will repurpose this recipe into an egg dish, and I think that will be a good way to handle the leftovers.  I love all the ingredients of this recipe and did so want it to work!  Thanks, Gentlewoman!  Maybe someone else can point out where I went wrong!
