I made this per the recipe, and it was delicious!It was SO easy to make too! I put it in a casserole dish and baked it a little. I waited for my kids and husband tell me how good it was before I told them the secret ingredient! I made it as a side dish to grilled chicken marinated in Italian dressing.

Wow this is a first.  I am the first to review.  Well, this was way better than expected.  It is a very light, creamy, and smooth alfredo-like sauce.  I great alternative to the fat laden original alfredo sauce.  I followed the sauce instructions to the tee except I used half & half instead of cream b/c that was all I had on hand. Though I expect that it would have been creamier if I had used heavy cream instead of half & half.   Still it was very good.  I skipped the bread crumb topping and served with cheese tortellini.  Yummy!!

I followed the sauce recipe except that I substituted light cream cheese for the heavy cream. I pureed in food processor until silky smooth. Instead of serving over spaghetti, I served over lobster ravioli (from Costco) and then topped with the crumb topping.  Delicious!

Chef John said that this was a bridge recipe for those who want to eat healthier, and that I agree with.   I believe it's the cauliflower taste, which persists in the sauce no matter how you try to modify it.

I made mine according to instructions.  I will try John's favorite ww pasta recommendation to see if this improves on the taste next time.  Also, I should've cooked my pasta under al dente.  I didn't time the cooking of my pasta and completion of my sauce well, and so I had to reheat the pasta in the saucepan in order for it to absorb the lemon and meld with the flavors of the sauce and cheese...by the time I was done, my pasta was a bit overdone.  I added some roasted veggies and sauteed sausage to fill out the dish more.

I honestly would rather have the full fat version and portion control, seeing how this recipe does not quite hit the spot for me.  I still really enjoy watching Chef John's videos.

Who would have thought? I wasn't sure if I could pass this off on my family since they are alfredo lovers....it was one of thier favorite dishes on the website so far! I didn't have the type of blender described so i blended small batches in my regular blender and returned it to the heat-a bit more time consuming but well worth it! Another great recipe Chef John--keep up the good work!

I just made this for dinner and it was delicious! It has all the flavors of an Alfredo sauce without the heaviness. The only thing I changed was to take out some of the cooking water to make the sauce a little thicker. Definitely a repeat!

This meal was absolutely amazing!  There was no lack of flavor and the cauliflower was completely disguised, yet made the sauce (velvety!).  I took out some of the liquid and put it aside so the sauce wouldn't be too thin.  I used regular half and half an only 1/4 of a cup.  I added garlic salt instead of regular salt to the sauce.  No need for olive oil in browning the crumbs and cheese; save the fat and calories!  The lemon juice was the perfect touch with the noodles.  I had no idea! !  I put the noodles on a serving platter, ladled on the sauce, topped it all with the crumbs, layered baked, skinless-bonelesss chicken slices across the top and a little Italian seasoning for flavor and garnish (fresh is preferred).  This dish was an ultimate winner for us and our neighbors.  I've already called my mom and told her to get to making this recipe.  It is beyond delicious and deserves HIGH praise!!  Way to go!!

This was delicious! Alfredo definitely one of my weaknesses. I was skeptical, but thought this was  totally worth a shot; and I am sooooo glad I tried it. 
Definitely going into my favorites!!!!

I am baffled. I had about 2 cups of liquid left.  So when I added the 1/4 cup cream, it was quite watery. I still ate it with tons and tons of lemon juice on it. Very good.

The best thing about this dish is the bread crumb topping. I didn't have very much to put on the pasta because I munched on it while I was cooking! So please make that towards the end. :)

My husband, who hates cauliflower, absolutely loved this recipe.  I served it over fettuccine, used 2% milk (didn't have heavy cream)plus added Asiago and Peccorino-Romano cheese. All you need is a tossed  salad, garlic bread and a good Cab.

This recipe makes much more than 4 servings, so for a fabulous variation, I added small broccoli florets to the leftover cauliflower "sauce", heated and served over thin pasta - becomes a different recipe for another day.

Heavy cream in a 'light' sauce seemed oxymoronic to me,  so I used 2% milk and whole milk, evenly portioned. The sauce was rich,  creamy and so much better than the jarred stuff.  Now I'll be stalking the shelves for when milk and florets go in mark down again.

So, so good! I halved the recipe, but didn't want to be stuck with a leftover half-cauliflower, so I boiled the other half and served it on top. It came out a bit saucy for the amount of pasta I used, so I think I'll reduce the water further next time. Thanks, Chef John!

followed the recipe exactly except took out 1/2 cup of water prior to adding cream and blending and still ended up with  2 cups of extra sauce.  The taste was pretty bland with hints of cauliflower and garlic.  the parm/bread crumb topping was good and definitely added to the dish.  i would make again because of the health factor, but would add more garlic,  and increase flavor and heat by adding a couple of  tsps or so of sumac.

Overall interesting flavor. Came out a big grainy/ watery. The favor presence fluctuates from bite to bite.

I'm wondering if cooking the cauliflower with a different method, such as roasting, would bring out more flavor. 

Still, the recipe is good, and is worth a try

Although I thought this was delicious, it disappointed me.  It really didn't seem like an alfredo sauce.  The texture and taste were clearly different, so nobody was fooled.  On the other hand, I like cauliflower, so this tasted good to me.  I would happily eat it again, but I doubt I'll make it again because my husband and daughter don't like it.  I'll stick with my usual strategy of adding pureed cauliflower to a reduced-fat alfredo sauce instead of this method of adding a little cream and cheese to a cauliflower puree.  Actually, I wonder if substituting milk for half the water would make a big difference in this recipe, but I probably won't test that.

Try to keep sauce hot before serving.  Should be able to keep it on the stove after blending.

I really am struggling with the review for this.  I understand that is a lighter version of a heavy dish.  I am a huge pasta fan but don't necessarily eat alfredo that often.  I had a half head of cauliflower to use up and made half of this recipe.  The only thing I changed was to use half and half and dried basil.  I added three chopped mushrooms to the sauce with the cheese.  I wasn't overwhelmed with the end result.  It had a decent amount of heat.  The texture was weird to me.  I was happy to make this to give the recipe a "face" but I doubt that I'll make it again.

This was really good, even without the topping.  I used half and half because that's what I had, and we loved it.  Such a great substitute for real Alfredo.  It makes a large quantity, too. At least 6-8 reasonable servings.
