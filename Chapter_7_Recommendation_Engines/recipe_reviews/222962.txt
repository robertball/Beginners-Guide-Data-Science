Shrimpy spicy sauce which hits the spot. I served mine over pasta but rice would work equally as well. Garnished with pickled jalapenos and packaged fried onion rings. Definitely for those who like hot on their palate.

Very easy to make and my son absolutely loved it. I substituted Rotel sauce for the tomato soup and chopped jalapenos and it worked great. Thanks!

I made a couple of changes to this. I didn't put in the Jalapenos and I made my own tomato sauce rather than using canned soup with 7 roma tomatoes. It turned out beautifully.

Made just as written and it's incredibly bland. I was expecting spicy and was sorely disappointed. I might try this again but it won't be this recipe.
