I was a little hesitant upon finishing the batter because it was very thin compared to most the muffins I make. They turned out fine though. Next time I would probably double or even triple the sugar because they needed a little boost of sugar to fit our taste. I did not have any oat bran so I topped the muffins with finely chopped candied ginger and that seemed to work well. Thanks for sharing.

I think the flavors and texture are great! A win for us with some alterations. I reduced the cook time to 14 min since I live at a high altitude of 7400 ft. I reduced baking powder to 1 tsp, added 1/2 tsp cinnamon, and added the entire 3/4 tsp ginger to the batter. I also increased the sugar to 6 Tbsp (double recipe). For the topping I melted 2 Tbsp butter adding 3Tbsp wheat germ, and 1/4 cup finely chopped crystalized ginger. Yum!!

I will definitely make this again!  I used coconut oil instead of regular oil.  Next time, I will make sure all ingredients are room temperature because the coconut oil hardened up on me after the addition of milk and egg, haha.  But it turned out good anyway.  I will also probably use more ginger.

4 5 17 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/234163/ginger-pear-muffins/ ... Wellll, yes, changes.  Rating is on the base - & it's good.  'Came here looking to make an apple ginger muffin.  'Soaked about 3/4c dried apples & 1c oats in 1/4c apple juice concentrate & 1/3c applesauce; adding 1/2c water when I thought it wasn't going to do "the trick."  I'll go with 1/3c next time.  Whisked together 1/3c oil & 1/3c brown sugar (coulda reduced since adding the sugar in the juice concentrate).  Beat in the egg & 1t vanilla.  Then added the oat mixture.  Recipe states 1/4t ginger in & 1/2 on.  1/2 in still had nonexistent ginger flavor) 1t, if again). 1c flour, 1 1/2t baking powder & 1/2t salt (needs more).  Oh, & 1/4c wheat germ.  :)  Well, even with apples, apple juice & applesauce, these didn't taste all that much like apples.  'Think apple is a difficult flavor to achieve without plenty of apples.  Anyway, good, moist muffs.  I topped with plain bread crumbs (Sneaky!)  These will be the type to get fuzzy quickly so eat up!

I really liked these.  I used whole wheat flour, 1 tbsp extra brown sugar, added a sprinkling of cinnamon to the batter, and doubled the oat bran topping.  I used bosc pears.  Perfect sweetness and a very nice combination of flavours and textures.

I liked these muffins because they weren't too sweet. I couldn't taste the pear as much as I would have liked, but maybe mine were too ripe. I didn't add walnuts, but I did have some candied ginger that wasn't doing anything so I chopped it up and threw it in, about 1/8 cup. The topping was different. I was thinking I might try a traditional streusel topping next time with some ground ginger and oat bran mixed in. All in all, I enjoyed them!
