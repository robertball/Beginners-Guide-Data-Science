I can't honestly rate this recipe because I didn't follow it exactly.  I didn't have all the ingredients.  But what I did have was still delicious.  I combined 1/2 cup light mayo, 2 T whole grain dijon, 1 T regular dijon in bowl.  Added 2 cans drained tuna, 1/2 cup sweet white onion, 1/4 red and yellow bell peppers and about 1/3 cup chopped cilantro. Mixed it all in bowl...didn't use processor.  Can be served as a wrap, on lettuce, in a sandwich, as a melt...however you like.  It was a delicious, healthy lunch!

Not bad, far too much mayo, mustard, and relish.  I cut my amount in half and wished that I cut it more.  The salad was good on a pita.

I liked the recipe, as I love anything with tuna and this seemed diffent, left out capers, don't like them, I then used on crackers and also made wraps out of this mixture, makes for a lite lunch or snack, thanks for sharing, its worth making!.

LOVE this recipe. I wrap it up with lettuce in a large sandwhich wrap (burrito style) and have it for lunch every day. It actually tastes better as the beans and tuna marinate in the dressing ...

Although this tasted good, it doesn't have good eye appeal.  I subbed jarred roasted red pepper and dried cilantro.  I didn't add capers (didn't have).  Added salt and pepper to taste. Served wrapped in a tortilla with baby lettuce.

I love the taste of this, and I'm just now realizing I missed the onion (would've used powder if I've noticed) and garlic powder.  I'm a little leary of the amounts of mustard and mayo, though.  That seems like an extreme amount, so I just eyeballed what I thought would work--probably about a heaping tablespoon of both.  I didn't have relish so just used bread and butter pickles.  This doesn't really turn out that visually appealing as Godiva Girl noted.  I processed everything, including the beans, in the hopes that would help.  I don't think I succeeded, though, perhaps because I couldn't get it completely smooth.  All things considered, though, it's worth trying even if it looks a bit scary. :o)  Thanks for the recipe!

this was a pretty good salad.  i did not blend this in the food processor.  i left it with the normal tuna salad texture and used it as a superbowl party dip with crackers, french bread and (for the gluten-free guy), romaine lettuce leaves for wraps.  

since i didn't have Dijon, I used a spicy brown mustard instead.  this salad calls for too much mayo/mustard for my liking.  i cut both down to 1/3 cup and added the whole can of beans and extra diced vegetables (a whole orange pepper instead of 1/2, 2 stalks of celery, jalapeno stuffed green olives.)  even with the extra stuff , it was more 'goopy' than it needed to be.  next time i will try 1/4 cup each of mayo and mustard.  although i would have loved to add the fresh cilantro and parsley, i didn't have them on hand.  i imagine the fresh herbs would add a nice flavor.  

thanks for sharing!

We didn't have the relish or the capers,  but this was already way too strong with the dijon.  My husband said he had to gag down his lunch.  Would be much better with a few adjustments.

Added 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper to bring out the flavors and used dried blackeye beans to lower the sodium.   Fresh and tasty treat!  :)

Loved this!!! I used dried herbs and minced a jarred roasted red pepper. I found that I only had a can of garbanzo beans so I used those. Also, added a minced pickled jalape√±os as someone else recommended.  It didn't add much for me. I also took the lazy way out and mashed with a potato masher. I think that makes it more of a spread or even a dip. Leaving the beans whole would make it more like a salad (and require less dressing). A big scoop with some cottage cheese was a FANTASTIC lunch!

This was really delicious.  I did make a few changes: substituted parsley for cilantro (personal preference), and minced jalapeno for the pickle relish (based on what I had on hand).  Used less mayo and mustard and will cut back further next time.  Did not blend.  Mixed well and served with crackers as an appetizer.  Wonderful.  Company cleaned it up quickly!

I made this for lunch but did not have capers nor cilantro on hand.  I did not blend any thing either.  I put about a cup of the mixture on a bed of greens and it was really tasty (no need for dressing).  My husband loves to take this for lunch at work.    Thank you.
