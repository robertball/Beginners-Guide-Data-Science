This was quite delicious and definitely a meal that we'll keep in our dinner rotation.  Even my three-year-old son devoured it.  As written, the sauce recipe is rather scant on quantity, so when I make it again, I would double the ingredients.

This is a very good scallop recipe that even the kids loved. Definitely need to double the sauce. I added extra sun-dried tomatoes also. Did not use the olive oil - the bacon grease left from frying bacon was perfect for cooking the scallops. Will definitely make this again.

My family loved it.  My daughter wanted her scallops on the side but she is eight.  My husband and I loved it and he does not really eat tomatoes but he did not waste a drop.  Based on another reviews comments I doubled the wine, cream, butter, and garlic to make more sauce and I am glad that I did.  I also used Fettuccine noodles but suggest you sick with the smaller pasta because my sauce was thin.  I also used think cut smoked bacon.  Please thank your father-in-law; this will now be in my familyâ€™s recipe box.

This was yummy!  I used chicken instead of scallops and also added sauted mushrooms.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

Lovely.  A great way to start me thinking of multiple ways to do similar dishes.  Maybe 1/2 shrimps & /2 scallops.  Capers instead of sun dried tomatos, a little bit of lemon?  The possibilities are endless.  As it is, I prepared this as written and it was lovely!

I gave this four stars so I wouldn't hurt the overall rating because of my changes.  However, I would like to leave a review for the pescatarians that may be considering making this dish.  I left out the bacon and sprinkled just a little bit of vegetarian bacon bits on the dish at the end.  I used diced sundried tomatoes which gave the flavor but hurt the texture a bit.   Overall, I would give this 3 stars for  a pescatarian meal because it lacked flavor.  My boyfriend did enjoy this dish but I doubt I will make it again.  If I do, I will have to make some major modifications and will probably not use the bacon bits.

Pretty much stuck to the recipe. Only made 8 scallops with the original amount of sauce (which came out perfectly) to feed 2 of us. Will make it again! Thank you!

I made this recipe as written, but it just wasn't good. Quite bland and just blah. The sauce was barely enough for one serving, so I would definitely recommend doubling or tripling the sauce portion of the recipe.

This was awesome.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly.  Just delicious.  I did increase the sauce ingredients a bit and it was perfect.  Tossed the cooked pasta in the pan with the sauce and scallops.  Will make this again.  I also think you could do this delicious sauce with seared shrimp, or even chicken.  Thank you for a fabulous dinner!

Sooooo delicious! We made this for Valentine's Day, which was also our 6 month anniversary. I think it will be an annual tradition! We did double the sauce.

Really yummy, but be sure to use super high quality ingredients.  If you don't, it isn't worth it.  I made this without serving it over pasta, since I eat low carb and it was great!

Hubby made this for dinner tonight. Was really good, but he didn't read the reviews so there was not enough sauce. We added some baby bella mushrooms. I will use the precooked bacon bits that we get in a big bag from Costco next time, and double the sauce. This recipe is a keeper, just needs a few tweaks

This was fantastic!  My husband rates my meals, not only was this in his first tier, but his FAVORITE of all time.  I doubled the sauce and added two tablespoons of capers.  I also added a tablespoon of the Sun-dried tomato oil to the sauce.

This recipe is awesome!! Something I did was cook the bacon in a little of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes. Also instead of using sea scallops I used bay scallops which are much sweeter than the sea scallops. This was a perfect pairing with the bacon and bit of the sun dried tomatoes. My sauce wasn't quite thick enough but adding just a bit of corn starch solved that problem! Excellent recipe a must for dinner tonight!!

Delicious option for scallops. I used almond milk instead of cream which kept it very light, but otherwise followed the directions exactly. My husband and I both thought it was great and will definitely make again.

I doubled the sauce ingredients for 4 ounces of whole wheat pasta, it was needed. sauce didn't thicken so I added corn starch. added mushrooms and onions for some flavor,  not sure it's worth all the work

I googled bacon, scallops and pasta.  This is the first recipe that I read.  It is the best thing I have made lately.  It was wonderful.  Flavorful but not too heavy.  There weren't any leftovers.  I will definitely make this again.  Delicious and easy.

This was delish & very easy, scallops came out perfect. The only change I made was to double the sauce ingredients.  You could even leave out the bacon and it would still be a great dish!
