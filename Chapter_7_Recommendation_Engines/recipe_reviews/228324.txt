Fantastic and easy to make. I made mine with homemade vanilla ice cream and piped fresh whip on top. Perfect amount of Oreo!

This milkshake was soooo good! Everyone loved it. I added 2 more small scoops of vanilla ice cream so that it wouldn't be too chocolate-y (I'm more of a vanilla person). ALl in all, it was DELICIOUS! Definitely am making it again.

Simple but effective. The guests loved it.

It's extremely sweet, which is to be expected, of course. What worked for me is giving everyone a small glass as desert, rather than trying to make this a meal beverage.

To make it less runny , I substituted the milk for heavy whipping cream , much thicker and rich plus it helped keep the oreo bits in suspension. Added some oreo crumbs on top along with a few cherries ....yummy :)

It was good, just not thick enough. If I make it again I'll just use more ice cream and less milk.

This shake was great! It would get 5 stars if it wasn't very thin and sweet. It might have been this way because I made half the recipe. Overall I would make this milkshake again!

Super easy and super quick to satisfy my craving for a milkshake! I used chocolate and vanilla ice cream because that's what I had and my daughter and I loved it!! I can believe how easy it was, I'll be making my own milkshakes from now on!

We used 4 scoops of ice cream and 1/4 cup of milk. We also only used 4 cookies. Yum!
