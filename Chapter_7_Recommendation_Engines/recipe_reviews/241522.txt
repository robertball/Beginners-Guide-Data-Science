I've tried similar Flax seed bread recipes before and found they needed something.  What they needed was pumpkin!    Next time I will add some more spices, but it was good just following the recipe (especially with cream cheese spread on the top!)

used fresh (roasted) pumpkin. It was great with and without chocolate chips. Kids even liked it.

This was my first time making this recipe and it turned out perfect! I think you could add banana and walnuts and have a flaxseed banana walnut recipe as well!

This was not very good (in my opinion). It had an overwhelming flaxseed taste. Perhaps it would be better with less flaxseed and some other ingredients.

Followed the recipe exactly. It has a decent flavor and was very moist. However, it didn't taste like pumpkin at all, and it wasn't as sweet as I'd expected. Additionally, the spice flavor didn't really come through as I'd expected. This is a solid base recipe, but I will be making some modifications (upping cinnamon, adding other chai spices, and a bit more sweetness) on my next bake.

Did not like this. Probably just because its made with all flaxseed as the flour base.
