My family recently had a salsa contest.  I thought since I had fresh blueberries & fresh jalapeno from the local farmer's market I would try this. It was great, followed the recipe exactly except adding a 1/2 t sugar.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up.  Served w/chips and also w/crackers on cream cheese.

Served this over cream cheese for a "red white and blue" wine club event.  It was definitely a hit!  Next time I make it I may add some extra spice as it was a little bland for my taste.

I followed the recipe exactly.  This was unique but my husband and I just couldn't convince ouselves to really like it.  It was better when eaten with cream cheese.

The salsa was nice, but I would have made simple syrup with the blueberries and jalapenos ten put that over some softened cream cheese.

Delicious. I just chopped cherry tomatoes for this, as I didn't have any of the larger ones. Also I added salt and a little extra vinegar.

7.18.14 ... https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/110321/blueberry-salsa/ ,,, Liked.  As is, it's super mild.  I added another T jalapenos & it still wasn't up to "medium" heat, but improved flavor - for adults.  I added the half t sugar recommended.  'Think that'll help with flavor, & preserving it.  Next time, I'll add some garlic & other traditional salsa spices, or maybe sriracha.  'Nice to have a blueberry recipe that isn't a dessert! Note: sugg: add 1/2t sugar. Serve over cream cheese.  Make simple syrup & add to japs & berries then serve over cream cheese.

It was very different but went well with my fish dinner.   Any other ideas to use this with would be helpful  Used dried chili peppers instead of jalapeno.    Maybe making in a smaller portion would be better.

Followed the recipe exactly for a small get-together  -- it was OK but not a big hit.
