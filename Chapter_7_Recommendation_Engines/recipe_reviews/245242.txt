Would add corn next time. Used frozen pie shells and worked fine.

LOVED it!  The taste alone and then ease of prep made this a huge hit. So I followed most of the instructions minus the bacon because I didn't have any.  I used regular pie crust for the bottom and the fluffy, pastry dough for the top.  

Butter, onion & veggies fried first using a big bag of frozen mixed veggies and a store bought, pre cooked chicken I just took all the meat off of.  Okay, so clearly this was a total pre-fab meal on my part but I'll tell you, we had the regular 6 people from 6 yrs to 87 at the  table and we all loved it!  

I added the flour to the veggie mix, added the chicken, chicken stock and spices, using thyme, marjoram and some seasoning salt.  I also added a bag of Monterey Jack cheese after the mix was thick. Popped the cheesy mix in the pie shell once it was ready to go.   

I think I had it in there for about 45 min on 350-375 or till the top looked good.  Thank you for sharing this recipe, I know it's going to be a wonderful one people will ask for in my kitchen from now on.

This sounds tasty. I like the addition of bacon. I will update after I make it. One thing to me if it has a bottom crust it's a pie. A pot pie just has a top crust generally.

I added some peas and corn and a little bit of extra thyme and garlic powder.
