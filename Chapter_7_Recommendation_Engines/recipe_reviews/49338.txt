The chicken was great. But I felt the tumeric killed the taste. If I cook this again, I think I'll try it with only 1 tablespoon.

I decided to make this because I had all the ingredients on hand. I couldn't figure out where it would get it's flavour from and was right....It was bland (tumeric doesn't have much of a taste on it's own) and just not something I'd make again.

My husband and I both loved this recipe. I used "frozen" peppers in 3 colors that made it very pretty too! Mildly spicy from the tumeric, children may not like it. Add some brocoli, a great low carb meal!!

Good standard recipe.  I slathered both sides of the breasts in the spices before placing them in the dish and added garlic with the onion and pepper. (Also used yellow curry powder with turmeric instead of straight turmeric). Came out very flavorful.  A good meal, but nothing special.

Simple and easy to make. The turmeric added a nice flavor to the chicken along with the onions and bell pepper. Next time I'll add some different colored bells along with the green.
