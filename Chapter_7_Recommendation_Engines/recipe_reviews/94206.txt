I have made these a few times over the past year and they are a pretty successful party food.  Usually, I omit the onion (and sometimes tomato) and once I roll up the tortillas throw them in the oven at 350 for about 10 minutes to warm them through and melt the cheese; then slice them into rolls when they come out.  My guests prefer to eat them this way.
