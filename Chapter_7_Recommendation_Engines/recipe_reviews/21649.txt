These are really good.  I have a few pointers.  Too make ingred. mix better together-- mix sausage with Biscuit THEN add cheese.  The ball don't have the powdery white appearance and they mix easier.  Also I like to cook these on parchment paper and they slide right off the paper.  Enjoy.

I learned how to make sausage cheese balls in high school and have used the same recipe for over 10 years. My family has requested these at every  baby and bridal shower until I have gotten sick of making them and even eating them. The only difference in the way I make them and this is that I cook them longer. They really need to cook for up to 25 minutes. Otherwise you end up with raw sausage in the middle. I have tried different brands of sausage and it makes a difference. Some are greasier than others and some are drier. And I have found that Aberdeen sausage (spelling?) (it may be Aberdeen Farms) works the best. You can find it at walmart and it usually is the cheapest. If the ones on the edge of your pan end up dry just put all the sausage balls in a covered container and let them sit covered until they cool. The steam will help the dry ones become moist. I always cover mine to cool to hold in the flavor even if they don't dry out because it seems to make them taste even better if the flavors mingle.

These sausage balls were so good.  With 6 children, I don't cook spicy for them, but I did add a bit of black pepper and some dried chives to add some flavor.  However, I had to change the baking a bit.  The first batch I made came out SOO greasy (of course using uncooked sausage), even after laying them on a paper towel to drain and cool.  I took my cooling rack and placed it on a cookie sheet, then put the unbaked sausage balls on that.  When they cooked, the grease dripped down through the cooling rack into the pan below.  Because of the drippings, you will need to get a spatula to get them off the rack, but cooking them this way they have yet to burn!!  I cooked them for 25 minutes or so instead of 10 minutes like the recipe says.  After cooking them like this, my husband tasted them and said they were the best tasting sausage balls he had ever had.  My children ate them as fast as I was making them!!  I will be cooking them this way from now on.  We had these for Thanksgiving appetizers this morning!!  :)

I see so many reviews that say "this was dry.. not enough liquid", but if anyone actually read the instructions, they would see that nowhere it says to pre-cook the sausage. Its supposed to be raw. I guess the person who added it should have clarified that.

outstanding!  i've made sausage balls before but these were especially delicious & got many rave reviews.  i used hot sausage, extra-extra sharp cracker barrel cheese and grated it myself (i think this was the key), and the 2c bisquick.  i made about 60 good size balls.  i took the idea of some others and baked them on a wire rack over a cookie sheet to drain grease but also it kept them soooo moist!  i baked at 375 for about 18 minutes.  perfect!  thanks!!

The great reviews of this recipe saved me a lot of aggravation with this one... thanks everyone! I left the sausage out for about 20 min. before starting the recipe and finely grated the cheddar cheese by hand... those were the two best ideas from the reviews. Then you really have to get in there with your hands (those disposable thin kitchen gloves work great for this part) and knead the dough. It was kind of fun actually :)  Also, as many reviewers have suggested, line your baking sheets with parchment. I had no sticking whatsoever. Finally, my own suggestion is to bake them longer than 10 min... I baked mine about 20 min., flipping them over after 10 min. This could partly be my oven's fault, but I'd say you'd at least want to bake for 15 min. There's nothing worse than an undercooked sausage ball... yuck! Anyway, the final results were very yummy and I've got a lot left over in the freezer ready and waiting for Superbowl Sunday!!!

I FOUND A GREAT EASY WAY TO MIX IS TO PUT EVERYTHING INTO A GALLON SIZE (OR LARGER) ZIP LOCK A KNEAD AWAY:) NO MESS AND NO DISHES TO WASH:)

This is the recipe I've used for 20+ years, adding another good handful more of cheddar. I can't believe some recommend to cook the sausage before mixing. No, you do NOT cook the sausage first! Your sausage balls will be dry and lacking the flavor the grease gives them during baking. Just toss them in a paper-towel lined bowl to absorb any excess grease afterward. If you use nice sausage (it really is worth a buck or two more), you won't have the super greasy problem to begin with. If you live in the southeast, look for Neese's Hot Sausage (the BEST!). Failing that, Jimmy Dean is fine (don't go lower in quality than that, tho). Set the ingredients out an hour ahead of time. You have to use some muscle to get it totally blended. You'll know it's ready when you can smoosh it into one big old smooth mass that isn't crumbly or dry.  DON'T add liquid if it seems dry - that isn't the problem! The warmth of your hands and the kneading will do the trick. Just keep at it; it'll end up just right. I make mine large-marble size (ends up walnut size after baking) and cook about 15 mins. This is THE recipe to try. Don't use tons of baking mix or add liquids like some recipes call for. Use parchment/silpat; the bottoms won't over-brown or stick. For heaven's sake - whatever you do - DO NOT precook the sausage! :)

I keep these in my freezer, thaw a few minutes and reheat at 350 for around 6-8 minutes. THEY ARE WONDERFUL. Tips: I use extra sharp cheddar hand grated, mix WELL with the bisquick in my Kitchenaid mixer, then add the cheese and mix it in. cook on a Pam-sprayed cake rack on a cookie sheet at 350 for 18 minutes. George Jones Hot Sausage is my favorite!

62 y/o Male in the kitchen and my wife considers me a work in progress. I made this recipe with no changes.  I did use my Kitchenaid and a dough-hook which completely solved the mixing issue.  I dropped in the pound of Jimmie Dean hot, used my scale to measure out 8oz by weight (4oz per cup) and just dumped it on top of the sausage, set the speed to 2, and walked off while I found a large jellyroll pan, parchment, pre-heated the oven, etc.  I walked back to the mixer and dropped the one pound bag of shredded sharp cheddar cheese into the mixing bowl which now contained the fully incorporated bisquick and sausage.  I let the mixer run for another 5 minutes fully incorporating the cheese into the mix and grabbed a cookie scoop.  Onto the parchment, into the oven, and out to the cooling racks.  No Drama, Great Outcome, and a new favorite.  I just finished 6 sausage balls microwaved for breakfast, and you just gotta LOVE this recipe.

My only advice is to grate your own cheese.  Companies add starch to pre-grated cheese so it stays separated and looks pretty.  That added starch will hinder juicy & moist sausage balls.

I followed this recipe EXCEPT I did NOT cook the sausage in advance.  If you do that, the sausage balls do not have a grease to help the bisquit mix cook while baking.  I just mixed everything together in a bowl and then baked.  Turned out wonderful.  Also - use a flavorful sausage for better tasting rolls.

I have been making a variation of this recipe for about 15 years. I have found two things that might be quite helpful while making this appetizer.   First, I like to use a basic sausage (the cheapest sausage from Wal-Mart (Jamestown Brand) is quite good, but you still can't go wrong with Jimmy Dean, etc (I have used various kinds but both are still good).   Next, I mix the sausage and baking mix (Bisquick). I wet my hands with a little water, and it helps mix every thing together. Another trick I use sometimes is using a splash of worcestershire sause). I then add in the cheese (I use the generic finely grated sharp cheese in a bag) and mix every thing together.   I like to cook the sausage at a higher temperature 425 degrees for about 10-15 minutes, because I like everything to be crispy. However, if you want your sausage balls cooked at a lower temperature, I would have to agree with some of the other reviewers that I would cook the balls longer than 350 for 10 minutes.   The top and bottom of the sausage ball should be browned. Also, if you cut into the ball the inside should look fully cooked.

I am a vegetarian, but wanted to make some sausage balls for an office party. This is good for veggies or anybody who wants to avoid the greasy-ness you might get from the sausage. I substituted Morningstar Farms non-meat sausage patties for the sausage. I just microwaved the patties for about 20 seconds to thaw them out a bit and then tore them into little pieces and put them in the mix. I used 8 patties torn up - using 6 from just one box wasn’t quite enough. I added about a teaspoon or so of rubbed sage and paprika to make it taste a little more sausage-y. I also used two kinds of cheese. Half sharp cheddar and half some fancy spicy cheese I found at the market. The folks at the office had no idea that it was vegetarian! Delicious!

I was pretty impressed with these - so simple but yummy! Whomever suggested using the dough attachment on their KitchenAid was really onto something as well - I would strongly suggest letting your sausage sit out for 10-15 mins then use the KitchenAid to mix the sausage and biscuit mix together before throwing in the cheese. I also used a wire rack over a cookie sheet so the grease could drip down - only thing I will do different next time is spray the rack with a little non-stick spray.

A wonderful, easy, classic recipe!  There are a few variations.  Try adding finely chopped onions and bell pepper if you want a bit of a change occasionally.  I keep zip lock bags full of these, uncooked, in the freezer all the time.  Great for unexpected company!  Freeze balls (not touching each other) on cookie sheets, and then transfer to bags. I write the cook time and temp on the outside of the bag so I don't have to hunt down the recipe when I'm in a hurry.

This is not your typical sausage ball.  In fact, I was concerned I had the recipe wrong because 't look like enough Bisquik.  I double-checked to be sure.  My grocery store was sold out of the regular Bisquik, so I used the Heart Healthy.  I always use Jimmy Dean sausage because there is very little fat.  And, I grated my own cheddar cheese to save a little money.  Tips for success, besides using a quality sausage, would be to THOROUGHLY hand-mix the Bisquik into the raw sausage, getting it as crumbly as possible.  I never looked well-blended, no matter how long I worked it... but, in the end, it really didn't make any difference.  I added the cheese to the meat mixture and did my best to mix well.  I did nothing to alter the original recipe, but found that my sausage balls (just slightly bigger than bite-sized) required 12 minutes cooking time to get them golden brown.  I cooked on parchment paper, and cooled on racks.  Expecting some grease to drip off, I placed a paper towel under the cooling racks, but this was never a problem.  What little bit of greased existed came from the cheese and stayed on the parchment paper.  My hubby rates these as the best sausage balls he's ever tasted, and he's eaten these his entire life.  Cold or hot, these are tasty, meaty, and not doughy like the other versions.  A definite keeper!!!

Use Jimmy Dean HOT sausage and fresh grated sharp cheddar. Make sure all ingredients are at room temp as it makes it easier to mix. Use your hands - it's the only way to get the ingredients fully incorporated. Mix until biscuit mix is fully incorporated. No white left! Freeze unbaked balls on a parchment lined baking sheet until firm and then store in freezer bags.  Remove, thaw and bake.

My family asks me to make these EVERY year for the holidays..Remember NOT to cook the sausage first!  I generally use 3 cups of Bisquick so they'll be less greasy, and finely chopped onions make it a bit more flavorful...Like someone else suggested, I also use 1/2 regular and 1/2 hot saugage...YUM!

As a long standing holiday tradition in our family, these delightful morsels appear every year on Christmas Eve.  The KEY to keeping them moist is to MELT the cheese before mixing it with the bisquick and ground sausage.  Believe me, the dough will stick together.  No other ingredients are necessary, that is what makes these Sausage Balls so fantastic...EASY!

Thanks to all the reviewers for their suggestions to make this come out delicious. I made a few additional changes. I used Habernero Sausage for heat, added sauted minced garlic, and minced celery. I also added 1 egg to help bind the dough. It came out moist and "cake" like. I served it with a sour cream, chive and cilantro dip, and they were gone in less than 30 minuites.

Me and my family have been making these for a very several years. One tip on making them is that when mixing the sausage and biscuit mix together, leave sausage out for about 15 minutes. It mixes alot easier closer to room temperature.

There are so many recipes for Sausage Balls out there and I think this one was the best! I used 1 pound mild sausage, 2 cups homemade bisquick mix, and I didn't have any sharp cheese so I used a frozen bag of shredded "Mexican style" cheese (a Kroger mixture of mild cheddar, monterey jack and asadero cheese). Baked mine for 24 minutes on 350 in a toaster oven. Perfect! But I must have been doing the balls small because the recipe yielded 70 sausage balls! So great for the football game tonight!

I have made the sausage balls for years.  I use Owens Hot sausage.  I let my sausage sit out of refrigerator for about an hour before mixing with the biscuit baking mix.  I grate my cheese fine before adding to sausage mix.  Add 3 to 4 Tabl. of warm water to mix. Make balls about the size of a walnut or smaller.  Spray cookie sheet with Pam & bake 15-20 minutes @ 350 degrees.  I take these to Sunday School in a crock pot to keep them warm.  There is never one left.

These are very good. I cooked (a mild version)for my daycare children and...brace yourself... I added 1/2 cup pureed spaghetti squash. DELICIOUS! You can't taste the squash at all, and they turned out very moist. This is great for serving children who do not like their veggies! They will never know.

Spicy sausage, sharp cheddar, garlic pepper and onion salt!  So simple!  I made 30 one inch Sausage Balls, and baked them for 36 minutes.  U checked for doneness at 18, 25, 30 and then 36 minutes  Nno pink in the middle at 36, nice browned appearance.  YUMMY!

Add one egg. This binds everything beautifully and makes them fluffy and moist. We've done this for years, and I will never make them without it. The taste doesn't change, but it guarantees they won't be dry.

As suggested I mixed the sausage and bisquick first and there was no powder issues with the finished balls.  I bought mild instead of sharp on accident but it turned out fine but next time I'll double check on the type of cheese.  I baked at 350 for 20-25 minutes.  Everyone raved about these and talked about how they were an 'old school' party food and how much they'd always liked them but no one made them anymore.  These were also a huge hit with all the kiddos.

Made this recipe 5 times over the holidays for various gatherings and there was never a morsel left at any of them!  SIMPLE, easy recipe.  I did let the sausage sit out for about 20 minutes as suggested by others and the trick to a perfect sausage ball every time is taking the time to knead until all ingredients are WELL combined.

Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup of water after mixing the three ingredients and it will come together with perfection!  Moist and yummy every time.  Simple is better with this recipe.

For those people that were expecting more out of just 3 ingredients, I am not really sure what they are looking for.  This is a simple southern recipe, usually served as hors de ouevres.  It's not meant to be a meal, and it's not like a meatball at all.  It's just something to snack on at a party, that's easy to make with things that a lot of people (at least us southerners) have laying around the house.  I hadn't made these in a while, and needed to refresh my memory on the proportions of the ingredients, but this recipe came out perfect.  It does take some work to get all the cheese worked in.  I usually have to knead it for quite a while to get it mixed right, but it's worth it.  Making them "walnut sized" balls though, I usually end up with about 45 or so balls, not 30.  Maybe the recipe contributor is used to bigger walnuts than I am lol.

Wow. I just tried these this morning for breakfast, and they are out of this world. They taste just like McDonald's sausage biscuits! I used shredded colby/monterey jack cheese, and had to add a little milk (probably 1/4-1/2 cup) like other reviewers suggested to hold the mixture together, and formed the balls using my large cookie scoop. I also baked for 12 minutes. This will become a keeper for sure!!

This has been a family favorite for years.  Mix ingredients in a food processor.  Really makes this an easy recipe.  Also, do not cook sausage before mixing.  Sausauge will cook when baking.  I did not know this the first time I made them.

These are great. You just can't beat the 3 ingredient combination. It makes so many too, which is good because they go fast. I got about 94 sausage balls just following the directions exactly. I did get quite a workout mixing the ingredients together. I also make sure to grate my own cheese because it's moister. I think the texture and taste of these sausage balls is just perfect. This recipe has been permanently added to my recipe box at home. It's a keeper.

This is the same recipe I've  used for years with great success. I let my cheese (extra sharp cheddar) sit out in the bowl with the sausage a few minutes before mixing together, then I add the Biscuit mix.  I've also found adding a couple tablespoons of milk, some garlic powder & a little parmesan (fresh grated) if I have it on hand - all add a little something extra.  I also like to make the balls a little smaller & don't compress hard to keep them light when I make the rolls.

I mixed these (using Hot Bob Evans) in my KitchenAid Pro 600 with the dough hook so it would mix with ease.  I did as suggested by other bakers:  Baked for 20 minutes and on cooling racks.  The rest of the hors d'oeuvres weren't ready and the guest of honor still wasn't there so I turned off the oven and kept the sausage balls in the oven for about another 15 minutes while keeping the oven door open a tiny bit.   When I pulled them out, there was only a drop of grease, about the size of a dime, on the baking sheet, beneath the cooling rack.  They were thoroughly baked, brown on top, and sticking to the cooling rack.  Next time, I'll use a nonstick cooking spray on the rack.  These are absolutely mouthwatering served with Hickory Farms Sweet Hot Mustard or Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard.    I stored the few I hid in a Ziploc bag and they reheat well in a paper towel in the microwave for 30 seconds.    Tomorrow, I'm making more for us to enjoy during the Fiesta Bowl party.    I like these so much better than the ones that take Cheese Whiz.    Keep this recipe handy, it's a winner!

I've made these for 30+ years and have made some minor changes. 1. Hot sausage 2. Bring sausage to room temp. 3. I break the sausage into smallish pieces and put them on a baking sheet which I place in the middle of a cold oven. 4. Turn the oven on to 225 degrees. 5. Let it heat until the fat in the sausage begins to render; remove the tray and drain the grease.
The sausage won't be cooked but will be very warm and kinda' gooey-ish. You can press a paper towel on it to soak up more grease. 
I replace some of the "lost" grease with a spoon or 2 of low fat cream cheese.
Otherwise I follow the directions.
For us this makes them a bit less greasy or heavy. In our 4 generation household they're a hit!

One additional note. Sub in hot or mild Italian sausage. Sub in mozz, provolone and shredded Parmesan cheese. Add a little extra biscuit mix and a Tbl of milk, plus a bit of garlic powder and Italian seasoning. Prepare as above. Serve with marinara or pizza sauce.  My grand kids love this at snack time.

4 and half stars These were great!  Everyone loved them. 

Hint: When making the balls if you will have a cup warm water and wet your fingers when forming the balls they will come out moister and less dry!

I have been making these for many years.  I always let the sausage sit out for awhile.  It seems to mix easier.  These can be frozen uncooked.  I put them on a cookie sheet, stick them in the freezer and then put them in freezer bags when frozen.  Add a few minutes to the cooking time.

Nothing but raves!!!  I agree with other reviews that Jimmy Dean spicy sausage works best and isn't too spicy.  Also, the tip to work the sausage and Bisquick together first and then the cheese was an excellent tip. Will be making these for many years to come!

Love these!   I use hot sausage.  It makes them just a bit spicy, but my kids still like them.  When mixing, I use my food processor and put in baking mix, then sausage which I have divided into 5 or 6 large chunks.  Process until mixed, then add cheese.  To make the balls quickly, I just a melon baller, dip in water, then scoop out sausage ball, place on pan, dip in water before proceeding.   From start to finish, it takes less than 35 minutes, including washing processor and pans.

If you put a rack on your baking sheet and bake these on it solves the grease problem.  These are yummy and a super easy appy!

I really like this recipe, but I did tweak it some to suit my taste buds.  I agree with previous reviews that say to lower the baking temp to 325 degrees.  Baking it at that temp for exactly 25 minutes in my oven was perfect.  Also, I put the sausage in the microwave on 30% power for one minute to soften it up.  Adding the Bisquick (I sift it) BEFORE the cheese definitely helps.  I also added 4 oz of cream cheese.  It just gives it a little zip and needed creaminess.  Enjoy!  :-)

I have made these for years, but, looking at the reviews this morning, I decided to add black pepper and Italian seasoning.  They are delicious.  Just that little seasoning made them better...for me!

I was not all that impressed. I thought they were SO dry. I felt I needed to cook them longer becasue the sausage inside really was raw. I thought with the reviews that this would be awesome and I was so dissapointed!  Giving 1 star is even just 1 too many

I have been making sausage balls for many years and I have always added an envelope of dry onion soup mix with the bisquick. This is a good basic recipe. Thanks for sharing!

My mom made these every christmas morning and I do as well.  The only thing different I do is add 2 tblspoons grated onion and 1 tsp poultry seasoning mix.  I also use sharp cheddar and hot sausage.

What a timeless classic.  I remember my mother making these appetizers several decades ago. (I don't want to scare anyone with the exact year -- 19XX!  Ha!)   They freeze well too, so when you have company, just take out of the freezer and reheat on a baking sheet.  Recipes don't come much easier than this one.

Our daughter made these for our Sunday School class on Mother's Day.  Everyone enjoyed them and requested the recipe!  Staci is a novice cook and she did an outstanding job. I had her crush a box of stove top dressing instead of adding the biscuit mix and added finely grated cheese. The dressing gave it more flavor and the finely grated cheese incorporated into the mixture easier.  We had a few left over and they heated up well in the micro-wave.

Just made sausage balls for the first time ever, after reading many reviews and tips. I followed the recipe, using mild sausage and sharp cheddar, and tripled the recipe. The first batch, after baking for 25 minutes at 350* did not keep the ball shape, were more like biscuits and raw inside. The taste was also bland. Here is how I modified the recipe:

• Rolled the balls no larger than a walnut, and put in a metal bowl.
• Put the bowl in the fridge for 30 minutes and between batches.
• Used parchment paper. ( Great stuff!)
• Baked at 400* for 18 minutes
• Cooled on a metal rack.
• Allowed the baking pans to cool completely in-between batches

Also, the next time I will use a spicier sausage or add some Texas Pete and ground red pepper

Delicious, but could really use a name change since I find Sausage Balls to sound quite unappealing.  I've started calling them sausage delights, and they somehow sound a little healthier too;)  I followed the suggestions of other reviews and baked the "delights" for about 20 minutes and they came out perfect.  Less greasy than I imagined.

Mine took about 15-20 minutes to cook.  I used Jimmy Dean "HOT" sausage for more flavor.  They weren't really "HOT", but gave the sausage balls a lot more flavor.

We make these every year for the Christmas season, double it, and freeze them all. Then when we want them for breakfast or a party, we just take a few out and microwave them. They freeze really well! We use spicy sausage and make our own biscuit mix so they are soft and fluffy. Also we cover them as soon as they come out of the oven so they soak up the moisture.

THE BEST!  Easy and great tasting.  Thanks to the other reviewers with the suggestion to mix the Bisquik and sausage together first....it really makes a difference.

I have been making sausage balls for years now. I do a few things different, though. First, I add a whole package of sausage (raw and torn in pieces), 2 and a half cups Bisquick, 2 or 3 cups shredded cheese (depending on how much we want) and 3/4 cups milk. I've found that it blends much better if you use your hands (even though it's gross!). After everything is mixed together, I bake at 375 for 18-20 minutes (depending on how large they are.) My family eats ours with jelly (I know it might not sound very good but I promise it's great!). Whatever we don't eat, I put in a ziploc and put in the fridge. They will stay good for at least 3-4 days after and still taste just as good when you warm them up!! Hope this helps!

These turned out great. My only suggestion is to add just a little water to help in binding the ingredients together. I think I used around 1/4 cup water...maybe less.

I used 1 lb. pork sausage, 3/4 cups baking mix, 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese, 1/2 tsp. garlic powder & 1 tbs. milk. Very good, & moist. Make sure you use parchment paper over the baking sheet so it doesn't stick.

YEAH! I have made sausage balls before but these are the best I have tried.  I added a little sage and dried onion to the mix, it takes a lot of muscle to get the mixture well blended - but then they are perfect!

These were a hit at our game night.  There were none left.  I did serve red pepper jelly on the side and it went really well with the sausage balls.  Added great flavor.

I should preface this by saying, I really love sausage, but I really like these.  They made about 40 balls of about 1 heaping tablespoon each.  I used regular sausage and a medium cheddar.  I can see how spicy or italian sausage and sharp cheese would be even better.  I added just a tiny bit of cayanne pepper and garlic powder and I baked at 325 for 25 minutes.  They were actually kind of crispy on the outside and yummy all the way through.

I LOVE sausage balls, but had never made them until I made these.  I've now made them twice and both times people declared they were the best sausage balls they had ever had!

I did follow the hints to buy the extra sharp cheddar and to put a little bit extra cheese in them.  I also mixed the sausage & biscuit mix together before adding the cheese and used block cheese that I grated myself.

AMAZING!

Excellent! I haven't made these in years. Took the advice of one of the reviewers to mix the sausage and flour first. I used an 8oz. package of shredded colby/cheddar and grated the other 8 oz. These are the best I have eaten. Very soft, not dry and flaky. I also used Jimmy Dean sage sausage. Use a good quality sausage- that makes a huge difference in taste! Also, use a large bowl or pot. I started in my large bowl and had to put in a pot, so I could mix everything thoroughly and evenly.  These are perfect to make for breakfast on the weekends and keep some to heat up on school mornings!

Even though I make these every year, I can never remember the proportions.  Used this recipe today.  Only change was I used 3/4 lb cheese.  Jimmy Dean hot sausage...2% sharp cheddar...Heart Smart Bisquick.  Walnut size balls.  Cooked for 13-14 mins.  They were perfect!

I added about 1/2 c. milk to make them not so dry. This recipe also appears in a Bisquick "cookbook" I had from my not so good of a cook days. I checked it and saw that's where I had the idea they needed milk. I think they would be entirely too dry without that. I also add a little parmesan cheese, about 1/4 cup. I have also made these with several other types of shredded cheeses. They all turn out pretty good.   Another suggestion, I saw a reviewer who noted they sausage needed to be browned prior to mixing! DO NOT BROWN MEAT! The internal temperature after cooking is about 210 degrees F. Which is well over the recommended cooking temp for sausage. Hope this helps!

I made these for our Christmas Party and they were a huge hit!!  Half of them were gone before I had a chance to take them off the cooling rack!  I used a mild sausage and added about a teaspoon of garlic salt...they were wonderful.  I cooked them on parchment paper and then removed them from their grease by placing on wire rack with aluminum foil below to catch any grease that may drip.  A huge success!!

I am cooking these sausage balls at the moment and these are WONDERFUL!
Here is what I did - 
- I doubled the recipe
- Took other reviewer's advice and used Jimmy Dean HOT sausage.  It gave it extra zip and was not overpowering!- 
- You have to mix it real good with your hands.
- You may have some unmixed cheese, sausage and biscuit dough at the bottom, but don't get discouraged, just keep mixing!
- I also, mixed it real good in clumps about the size of a small fist, then took the walnut sized pieces off of the clump.  It worked well!
- Cooked for 20 to 22 minutes.  
- Used a broiler pan (improvised) - sprayed with Pam for easier removal.
- Turned them once or they will get too brown on the bottom. 
- Put them on a paper towel on plate to cool and soak up excess grease.  (There was hardly any.)
- Plan to serve at tailgating and these will be perfect!!
- The taste is absolutely awesome because they are SO moist.  I have tasted dried up sausage balls that were aweful, but I couldn't believe how moist these were.
- I used finely shredded cheddar cheese and they turned out great.
- Plan to take other reviewer's advice and serve some with Maple Syrup!  Yum Yum!

My family and I have been making sausage balls my entire life.  They are always a hit and we make them every year for Christmas morning.  One thing I do differently is I cook and crumble the sausage before adding to the dough.  It really helps cut down on the grease but still leaves the flavor.  Then just add about 1/4th cup water to the dough to help with moisture.  I think they turn out much better pre-cooking the sausage.

I have been making this recipe for 30 years!  I use Jimmy Dean sausage.  I often roll out the balls & put them on cookie sheet, then put in the freezer.  I leave them there till just frozen, then put in a gallon size bag and freeze. That way they don't stick together and you can cook as many as you like.

I really like sausage balls, but with this recipe, found that it was hard to get the mixture to stay together and form balls.  I just slightly beat one egg, and added a tiny bit of milk, and they were great.

My mother-in-law used to make these every year.  She passed away last year and now everyone asks me to make these.  Her recipe called for three cups of baking mix and only 8 oz of cheese.  They were always dry to me.  I was glad to find this recipe.  I use hot sausage, as well.  I also add a sprinkle or two of chili powder.  I don't like them real hot, but this spices them up nicely.

I used my kitchen aid mixer with the dough hook to mix the ingredients... and this was SUPER EASY.  I used the sage jimmie dean sausage, sharp cheddar, and bisquick.  Rave reviews and SOOO good.  A keeper for sure

Great!  Didn't have bisquick so used pancake mix instead.  Also, used hot sausage.  Turned out great!  Also, make good leftover snacks.

I thought these were good the first couple times I made them but didn't realize how good until I started serving them for brunch.  (my favorite meal for entertaining)  These are always the first thing to go and everyone asks for the recipe.  Very very easy!

These are sooo good, my aunt absolutely loves these sausage balls.  I agree that using sharp cheddar gives them the best flavor.  These were a little oily after baking...but certainly won't deter us from making them again.  Thanks for sharing.

Super yummy!  The cheese did not all mix in.  Maybe you have to grate your own cheese and not use the pre-grated stuff because freshly grated cheese is stickier.

I love these so much.  We eat them at Christmas time at my fiance's mother's house, and there are never enough to go around.  In fact, they never even make it to the table, since everyone hovers around the oven and picks them out just before they're done.  We like to make them at home with no one else around just so we can eat as many as we'd like.  If you like onion, you can chop up a bit, and add a bit of sage, too.  It's easy to play with this recipe.

This is always a crowd pleaser.  My family loves a little spice, so I use hot sausage,or use half regular and half hot for the 'not so bold' guests.  It is easy to make these ahead and pop in the microwave to serve warm.

I found that half a cup of the biscuit mix works just as well, if you don't like having that doughy taste.

This recipe is perfect...as written...no need to change a thing!
Any changes/additions would strictly be reviewers personal taste and presentation preferences and should not change your review!
I chose to add the cheese after the baking mix and sausage were combined, (be careful not to mix too much or balls get dry) and I added 2tsp dried chives. Sage breakfast sausage, a better quality cheddar (freshly shredded) and some minced onions (didn't have any this time) are my choice here. There were 30, inch and a half diameter, balls that I baked for 21 minutes at 350 degrees on a cooling rack over top a foil lined jelly roll pan. They will stick if you don't wipe the wire slats with oil first! Learned that the hard way :(  I turned the tray at 10 mins.
The balls were crisp outside and incredibly flavorful! 
Thank you Stephanie for sharing!  :)

I agree with previous reviwers when they advised mixing in the cheese after the biscuit mix has been incorporated into the sausage. Also I now only use chorizo mexican sausage as it is AMAZING It is like something that came down from heaven. Also they are great cold for a take along breakfast. Don't hesitate don't change anything and you will be blown away!

These were really good but the mix was so dry I had a hard time getting it to come together so I ended up adding 1 egg and it was much easier to work with. These were simple and easy and I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and they had a nice heat without being really hot. I dipped mine in syrup but my husband suggested syrup as they seem to just need a sauce for dipping like gravy? Very good, I will make these again.

Classic sausage balls! @Sunshine424 - The recipe does NOT suggest that you cook the sausage first. It clearly says, at the bottom, that the cooked sausage balls may be REHEATED in the oven, obviously after refrigerating any uneaten portion. Also, @Diana S. The recipe does not say to cook the balls for 10 minutes. It plainly says 20 to 25 minutes. It's amazing to me how many people fail to read recipes before cooking.

Don't laugh, but I always made the frozen sausage balls.  I just made these following the most helpful reviewer's tips. I mixed baking mix and sausage first, then cheese, then baked on parchment paper. My husband declared them "stupid good"... after he had eaten a half dozen steaming hot ones.  Guess I can skip the frozen ones from now on.

I learned how to make sausage balls from my mother,Betty P., many years ago. She told me that the recipe didn't call for any liquid. The recipe we use calls for Texas Pete Hot Sauce--I'm not sure about the measurement--maybe 1/8-1/4tsp. If you don't like this sauce,substitute another liquid even water. I've never really been able to taste the hot sauce in it myself. Be flexible when preparing this recipe.  When you make it,you might find that it's drier than you expected. If so,just add a little more liquid at a time until you feel it's right. Don't be concerned if it's sticky cause you don't want it too dry. The liquid measurement can be anywhere from 1/8tsp up to even 1/2tsp. Humidity outside can make a difference. This recipe is easy to tweak until you feel it's ready. Any cook,regardless of experience,can feel like a pro who doesn't always need to measure every ingredient.  Have Fun!!

Super easy and really good.  I used country sausage and my KitchenAid.  Made mine a bit smaller than walnuts I guess as they were cooked through in 15 minutes.  Thinking some finely minced onion would be a good addition for more flavor.  Might make a batch of spicy next time in addition to the regular ones.   I thought they needed a dipping sauce so made Yummy Honey Mustard from here.  http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Yummy-Honey-Mustard-Dipping-Sauce/ and my own Asian dipping sauce.  Got nothing but raves and they all disappeared really fast.  I will make them again for sure and have already shared the recipe with friends and family.

These are not elegant, but they are irresistible. (It's hard to go wrong with pork sausage.) Although none of the sausage ball recipes explicitly state it, the sausage meat should be removed from the casings, and should not be precooked. 

I followed the advice of many and brought the sausage to room temperature and grated my own cheddar. I also mixed the sausage and Bisquik in the food  processor and added the cheese by hand afterward.

I baked them on a parchment lined pan for 20 minutes. They emitted a lot of grease, which I counteracted with paper towels when done. But next time, I would use a broiler pan or Alton Brown's technique of perching them in the cups of a mini muffin pan. The grease drips out into the cups.

I'm being nice, I didn't watch the video but should have.  I followed the recipe but not the video, should have followed the video, anyway my sausage balls came out flat, the cheese melted all over the pan, they all ran together,what a mess.  Only thing I saw different in the video is, I didn't bring the sausage up to room temp. before i mixed the bisquick with the sausage.  Oh well, back to the drawing board.  Please if your going to post a recipe make sure you tell the little detail too, they are so important.

Excellent and easy. I got more than 30 balls from the recipe though.  Just to clarify some of the other reviews, DO NOT COOK the sausage before you mix it in.

This is pretty much my favorite thing to snack on and make for a group of friends. Most of the time I like to use Maple Pork Sausage. If you haven't tried it with this recipe, I highly recommend it! I don't see anywhere on the recipe that it calls for pre-cooking the sausage first? I read the footnote as sausage balls that you have already cooked and want to freeze them for later to eat. Well overall, this is fairly quick to make, very yummy, and a crowd pleaser!

So easy - and it was the first thing gone on the buffet table (granted - there were a ton of guys there - this is a "guy" type food).
The parchment paper idea worked great.  
I also froze them before cooking - then had them defrost about 45 minutes before cooking.

Love these.  Been making them for years.  A couple things I do a little different.  I usually make a double batch and freeze a bunch.  I make them into the small balls, place on cookie sheet and smash down with a fork.  They seem to cook a little quicker this way.

I also freeze them on the cookie sheets uncooked.  When frozen, I take them off the pan and put them in ziplocks for the freezer.  To cook, just pull out what you need and put them in the oven frozen and cook normally.  I don't have problems with them being frozen because they have been flattened.  Now time to go make a snack.

These were okay.  I thought they had too much of the Bisquik flavor and were a little bland even though I added red pepper flakes to regular Jimmy Dean sausage.  I would reduce the baking mix by 2-3 tbsp next time and use the hot sausage variety.  I might be tempted to add some additional minced onion or garlic to it as well.

I loved these, but I did change the recipe a bit based upon other reviews. I pulsed some green onion and yellow bell pepper in my mini food processor and added that to the mix. I also used 1/2 cup of buttermilk, and some rosemary. Next time I will try adding jalapeno. We had them with buttermilk ranch as a dipping sauce, and I bet that a roasted red pepper sauce would also be good for dipping. What a treat!

My family also makes these every christmas morning! They are wonderful. I was wanting to make some today and my mom has the recipe and I couldnt get ahold of her. I have it memorized but I still like to be sure! Yours is the same exact recipe as ours so this was a good find for me! EVERYONE should try these sometime! They are easy and quick to make and so delicious! -- They only thing I do differently is i make them slightly smaller, and cook for only about 15 minutes.

I thought these were perfect.  I used the dough hook on my Kitchen Aid to mix the sausage and biscuit mix first then I added the finely grated cheddar cheese and mixed.  I baked on parchment and had no grease whatsoever.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage.

My mother always made these with 3cups baking mix. They "puffed" a bit more that way. Feel free to change up the types of sausage and cheese. Serve with a bbq or mustard dipping sauce at parties. Freezes very easily!!

I didn't have good luck with these and am disappointed, I was so excited to make these.  It was like the dry to wet mix ratio was off - by the time I got it all properly mixed, it was like plaster and it came out so tough and bready (probably because I needed to work it to get it all mixed).  I checked the ingredient amounts several times, because I thought I was losing it.  Bummer.

Favorite Sausage Balls recipe of all times!  I mix the shredded cheese with the baking mix then add the sausage in small pinches to be able to blend easier.  I made these several times during the Christmas holidays and am still making them to share during these cold, snowy days.  I increased the baking time to 13 mins to be able to have them a little browner.

What a great recipe.  I was a bit unsure of the ratio of cheese to sausage but I followed the recipe to the letter and it's a huge hit!  I'll make these again.

It's amazing how these few ingredients combine to make something so delicious!  I use spicy sausage in mine.  They free well after being cooked.  Highly recommend!  And no, you don't need to add any liquid.

After I got arthritis I had a hard time mixing these so I combined the ingredients then put it in the microwave for 15 seconds at a time until the mixture was soft enough to make into balls. Sooo easy! They are so delicious.

I ALWAYS partially cook the sausage first. Don't over cook your sausage, but cook just til done (no more pink spots) but not browned, and allow to cool for a few minutes before mixing with biscuit mix/cheddar cheese. They will not be dry when you bake them. I make huge batches of these at the holidays and freeze them (unbaked). Then I just bake as I need them and they come out great every time. Also, I bake them for longer than 10 minutes, about 15, but watch your baking time carefully, as they will "overbake" quickly.

I find that cooking the sausage first then draining it makes it better. They are not greasy and cook faster without changing the taste. I mix my cheese with the mix, stir in the crumbled cooked sausage, then add a small amount of water apx 1/4c just enough to make it stick together.

These are delicious! They are the only thing that I have ever brought into work that people have asked me to bring again (I'm not very skilled in the kitchen). I made the recipe exactly as stated except I cook them longer (usually 20-25 min).  I also agree with the person who said you should mix the sausage with the biscuit mix before adding the cheese.  Everyone I have made these for has loved them.

These are very good. They do definately need to cook 20-25 minutes and not 10. I aso used Bisquick Garlic/Cheddar biscuit mix...Gives the sausage balls SO much more flavor, and I used Jimmy Dean low fat sausage. Excellent! Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Delicious comfort food!  They taste just like the ones my MawMaw makes.  Instead of the boxed biscuit mix, I used the biscuit mix from the Never Fail Biscuits recipe from this site (minus the butter and milk, of course :).  I also had to add two eggs to get the balls to hold together (and yes, I used raw sausage that had set out for a bit and I mixed it with the other ingredients very well).  There was NO way that I could form them otherwise!!  I baked the sausage balls on a cooling rack that was set up on a baking sheet; I can’t imagine doing it another way as there was quite a bit of grease that had dripped down from the sausage onto the baking sheet.  Definitely grease the cooling rack well or the sausage balls will stick.  I will definitely make this again!!

This is such an easy recipe. The first time I made them was for a potluck, I made them the night before and popped them into the oven in the morning to warm them up. They were a big hit. The secod time I made them I added half chorizo, it gave them a nice flavor. Awesome recipe!

I have used this recipe for years, but this time I tried cooking on the rack over the cookie sheet and I got no grease on the cookie sheet. I used 1/2 lb. hot sausage and 1/2 lb. mild sausage and it is wonderful! (I used Tennessee Pride Sausage)I, too, when i saw the recipe the first time wondered if the sausage shouldn't be cooked first. No, it should not. I cooked the balls at 350 for 20 minutes or so and they are great. The recipe made 57 balls for me. The number depends on the size of the balls. Mine were more or less walnut size.

I had ground turkey instead of ground sausage and My dad is allergic to wheat so I had to do things completely different. I used pamelas gluten free baking mix instead of bisquick and pinched in 1/2 cup cold butter (needed to add butter because pamela mix is more dry than bisquick and also sausage is more dry than turkey). I then added lightly cooked ground turkey (seasoned w/ garlic, onion, salt, and thyme) instead of using sausage. Then I added the cheese (and really you can use any of several kinds). Still seemed a little dry since i was using cooked turkey insead of raw sausage, so i added some milk (i think like 1/2 cup).  Then i added a little more salt to the overall mixture. Baked at 350' 10 ish minutes and turned out super perfect. Served it with ketchup and blue cheese (a house hold favorite). My gluten intollerant dad loved it and so did the rest of my family.

These were pretty good, but I felt that 1 pound of cheese was way too much.  The cheese overpowered the sausage--everybody at my party kept calling them "cheese balls."  They were also really greasy.  If I make these again, which I probably will, I'll use 8-10 oz of reduced fat cheese instead of 16 oz of full-fat cheese.

We've been making sausage balls in my family for years and everybody always loves them.  Just a trick for mixing everything easier (which seems to be a problem for some people in the reviews) is to just throw everything together in the food processor.  It's way easier than trying to mix it in the mixer or by hand.

Wonderful sausage balls!  Don't add a thing...just mix the ingredients thoroughly and it will stick together as it is.  You just have to keep mixing with your hands until it does.  It's well worth the effort, because these are the best sausage balls I have ever had......just as they are!  Thank you for the recipe!  :)

Fantastic.  I used turkey sausage and they turned out great.  I made two days in advance and just re-heated in 350 degree oven for about five minutes.

These turned out really moist and good. I think they would be a challenge without a stand mixer. First I mixed the sausage (I used spicy Jimmy Dean) with the Bisquick until it was fully incorporated. Next I added the cheese and mixed with the dough hook - unless you have a professional mixer, only do one batch at a time. I formed small balls and baked them for 25 minutes on parchment paper. I put a layer of paper towels on my cooling racks to absorb any excess grease. Store them covered in the fridge - they are great reheated in the toaster oven. Next time I might try adding some cayenne pepper since I would like them more spicy, even after using spicy sausage.

We're vegetarian, but were craving sausage balls, so I made these with Gimme Lean! brand soy breakfast-style sausage. I made half a batch, and got about 30 balls the diameter of a nickel. I started to mix them by hand, but they were a crumbly mess, so I took another reviewer's suggestion and dumped everything into my stand mixer...90 seconds or son on medium and they were perfect! I really recommend this method. Thanks for the recipe!

Very good.  I had tried another recipe which called for more biscuit mix and they were much too dry.  This recipe has perfect proportions and comes out great.  Using a stand alone mixer is definately helpful for mixing these!

These are great. I love the flavor, even picky eaters tend to like these. They freeze well so I make them in large batches so I always have some on hand. Sometimes I serve them in BBQ sauce in my crockpot, it adds extra flavor.

These were really good.  The rest of my family thought they were strange but I really liked them.  I think they need less cheese and a little more biscuit mix myself.  I love cheese so I liked them but most people would like them with less cheese

These were great, I made them for a holiday breakfast at work, and they were gone FAST!!  I used my Kitchen Aid mixer with a dough hook to do the mixing, I would think it would be really hard to mix this up without one.  But using the mixer, it was so easy.  Loved the recipe - thanks!

Sausage balls are so delicious!  We make them every Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's as appetizers and they are the biggest hit with my family.  I've always used 2 C. Bisquick (usually the low-fat one) 8 oz. Cheese Whiz (lite) and 1 lb. Bob Evans Hot Sausage (I think the hot bit is essential as it gives them a bit of a kick).  We've also made it with regular turkey sausage (for non red-meat and non spicey food eaters) and they turn out just ok.  I've never made it with shredded cheese before, but maybe I'll give it a try someday.

My mom made these when I was a little girl--my kids love them as much as I did and adults love them too.  Can make in no time and freeze for later use. I love serving these to my kids for breakfast with scrambled eggs on dreary winter mornings.

These are the quintessential holiday appetizer!  I am surprised by the reviews that noted the balls were too dry.  You just have to make sure you work the ingredients together really well.  This is an excellent job to assign the kids, they love squishing it all up.  I always use hot sausage and bake on a rack so some of the fat can drip off.  At least that way I can pretend I have made them a little more healthy.  ;-)

Awesome recipe!! So easy to make and so delicious! Definitely follow all the other reviewers' tips to grate your own cheese, mix sausage and biscuit mix first, and cook on a sprayed wire rack above a baking sheet. Turned out great!

I have been using this recipe from Stephanie for years! I do however use hot sausage and I also put a little hot sauce in them for me. If I am making them for the grandkids I just follow Stephanie's recipe.

Made it exactly as written, fantastic! I was skeptical about the amount of cheese (too much) but it proved to be spot on! I used a double insulated baking sheet and didn't flip the sausages as others have done. The bottom was a yummy crunchy cheesey treat, just like a cheddar or Parmesan crisp. Where have these been all my life?

These are delicious! I used extra sharp cheddar cheese and Jimmy Dean Country sausage. I mixed the sausage and bisquick together first and then added the cheese last and it was easier. I have made these lots and lots and everyone loves them!

I gave it a full five stars because I think it has five-star potential but my first attempt wasn't as successful as I'd hoped. I followed the recipe amounts exactly. A few reviews suggested using a mixer or processor and, even though my baking brain was telling me too much handling would turn them into hockey pucks, I was sucked in by the ease of using my KitchenAid. I should have listened to my baking brain. They were definitely hockey pucks. Still edible but very dense. I used a small Pampered Chef scooper and got 70 from the recipe. I also let the sausage sit for an hour and shredded the cheese in the processor and let it sit for about 20 minutes to soften up a bit.

Excellent sausage ball recipe. I thought they might be too cheesy for me but I was wrong. I can't wait to make more to freeze. Delicious and easy, once you get them all mixed up (which took a few minutes).

I made it just as the recipe stated but it turned out dry and the cheese was leaking out everywhere. Then I halved the biscuit baking mix and used 12oz of cheese and it was perfect.

This is a very standard sausage ball recipe, and it's great!!  I generally add a little bit of water to incorporate everything a bit easier, and I also use a flavored sausage (like maple or sage) for a little extra pizzazz.  

I find that making my own is a somewhat healthier alternative, to buying the frozen ones in a bag from Tennessee Pride.  They are hard to find here in Florida, and are soooo greasy.  This recipe makes them just as good, without all the grease.

I wish that other reviewers would read the directions a bit more carefully, as the recipe does not call for the sausage to already be browned, and the baking time is indeed 20-25 minutes.  10 minutes if sausage balls are pre-cooked and frozen.

Pork sausage was on sale for $1/lb so I stocked up on it and found this recipe, it looked like something the kids would like. I took the advice of some of the reviewers and this is what I came up with: I left a pound of sausage out for a half hour or so, to get it to room temperature. I added 2 cups of biscuit baking mix to it and mixed with my hands. Then I added 2 eggs, some dried chopped onion, garlic pepper and salt, and finally about 2/3 of a block of cheese (shredded). I rolled them into balls and cooked them on a rack over a pan (I had to put foil on it and poke holes in it because mine were pretty small and almost fit through the cracks.) I baked them in my convection toaster over at 400 degrees for 18 minutes and they were PERFECT! Not greasy, cooked all the way through and golden on the outside. Will definitely make again!

Any recipe that gets my picky two-year-old to eat meat is a winner in my book!  Didn't change a thing!  Edited to add:  Remember that the recipe says 1 pound of cheese, not 1 cup.  1 pound is actually about 4 cups of shredded cheese.

Was looking for a quick finger-superbowl party dish. I really wanted to like these...but they were so blah blah bland and unexciting, greasy and really just tasted like doughy sausage....so disappointed! They looked good, and everyone seemed to rave about these in the reviews, but I don't feel they measured up at all!
If I do decide to build up the courage to try them again, I would use spicy saugage and a whole lot of spices - garlic, onion, and other spices, and maybe some cheddar jack....

I like these but thought they needed more spice, so I added 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper and whisk into the bisquick. To make the combining of the ingredients easier, I use the dough hook on my mixer. That cuts the mixing time down by at least ten minutes. You absolutely have to combine the ingredients till the mixture looks like the photo I added. Also to make them less greasy, I bake them on a rack over a baking sheet.

Great recipe, if your looking for more flavor, I cut back the biscuit to 1 1/2 cups instead of 2 cups. Also if your looking for a punch for more flavor. When you get done rolling the balls then roll them in your favorite Rub then cook. 10 out of 10 people said they like it better with the rub. Just try it with your favorite meat rub.

This is the perfect ratio of these ingredients. Not so much baking mix that they are dry and lots of cheese! I mixed the sausage & baking mix using my stand mixer with the dough hook, then added the cheese last. Much easier than by hand. My husband loves these - Thanks Stephanie for the perfect sausage ball recipe. The suggestion of parchment paper on the pan makes them so easy to move after they cool!

The kids love to help make these. They are great and the perfect breakfast when we have tons of kids in the house. Everyone snacks on them till they are gone and the little bites go a long way to fill a bunch of bellies.

I learned how to make these from my sister but we cook the sausage first. They are not dry at all but I add a bit more cheese than what recipes usually call for. I also make them into smaller bite size ones, easier when the kids or the husband wants to just 'pop' one in their mouth and take off.

These are amazingly easy and delicious. I made them for brunch with friends last weekend, and it reminded me of Christmas. Like the recipe-submitter, these were also a Christmas morning tradition in my house growing up. Maybe they will be again!

This is a little irrevelant because I had no idea I didn't have bisquick. I ended up using egg, bread crumbs, a little milk, salt, pepper and garlic. I rinsed my hands w/cold water while I was making meat balls and cooked them on aluminum foil lined cookie sheet that had been sprayed w/pam. I flipped them midway thru. Turned out really good even though I didn't have bisquick :)

I made this  with venison sausage. Since the venison is a little more dry, and it was impossible to mix it to where it actually formed a ball, I added a half cup of milk. It worked beautifully. And they are delicious!

Not sure why the great reviews.  Not much flavor to them at all.  And it was a little difficult to get all the ingredients to mix in.  I won't be making these again.

Seems a little dry for my taste.  I added some milk and had my hands moist while rolling them up.  Maybe I used too much baking mix?  Might try again with less.

Added note: So the next day I decided to make a country gravy, heated up the sausage balls in the micro and poured the gravy over the balls.  Much better!!

Made these for a friend's wedding - rave reviews! I mde three batches: 1 Jimmy Dean Maple Sausage, 2 Jimmy Dean hot sausage, all with sharp cheddar. I found that 16 oz sausage + 12 oz shredded cheese + 2 C Bisquick was perfect; mixed meat & baking mix first, then cheese. Using walnut/ping pong ball sized balls, I got 44/44/45 balls per batch. Twenty minutes was perfect. Will definitely make these again.

Just took these sausage balls to a party and they were the first thing gone! I read many reviews for this version and others so I listened and 1) added the cheese last 2) used a little less flour, about 1 3/4 cup and 3) also added 1/2 cup milk. The milk made it easier to make them into balls. I also used maple sausage and it gave them something a little different than the usual sausage ball. Anyway, they were great!

Perhaps it was the type of sausage that I used (I mixed chicken sausage and pork sausage, for less fat) but these turned out pretty bland. Even with the sharp cheddar there was not the kick you expect with sausage. I definitely recommend using hot sausage, or a mix of hot and mild. I used wax paper under them while baking and still had a problem with them sticking fast. Perhaps parchment paper would work better.

I made these for a middle school end of year party. Both kids and adults loved them and asked for the recipe! I changed the recipe a bit though by adding 1 and 1/2 cup of applesauce to it. They were very tasty and moist even after they got cold! Thanks!

sooo yummy and easy! if you have trouble mixing the ingredients, add a few tablespoons of water. it will hold them together better too. i used really spicy sausage--gives them a really nice kick! and baked at 400 for about 18 minutes; they came out with a slight crisp on the outside that was delicious.

I would like to this 5 stars, but I have made improvements that made it better.  I double the recipe so that I can use one mild sausage and one spicy sausage.  That gives it the right kick.  I only use the sharp cheddar too.  I use my Kitchen Aid Mixer with the dough hook to mix them up.  I bake them on a broiler pan so they are not greasy.  This makes them perfect.

I used the exact ingredients and they came out just right! The only change to the written recipe is that I cooked them for an additional 10 minutes. Remember to spoon the biscuit mix into your measuring cup and add in 1/2 cup increments. I also added the cheese about 1/2 cup at a time. I used a stand mixer to mix the ingredients thoroughly. These are best enjoyed hours after they are made NOT right out of the oven.

This is the recipe my family uses except we add 1 egg for every pound of sausage and then salsa to make everything stick together.

I followed directions of other reviewers and mixed the Bisquick in the sausage (plain jimmy dean) in the Cuisinart and then blended cheeze the same way with some pepper.  I sprayed the baking sheets with Crisco butter non stick spray and baked it for 20 min flipping its side half way and these came off fabulously.

I've been making these for years but decided to try some of the suggestions.  I mixed the sausage and chesse together first and then added the bisquick a half a cup at a time, finally I added about 1/4 cup of water and it came together better then it every has.  These are always delicious and I will make these like this from now on.  Thank you for the suggestions!

I learned how to make sausage balls many years ago living in the southeast. These are awesome! I use slightly less Bisquick (about a cup and a half) and followed another reviewer's suggestion of mixing the sausage and the Bisquick first. I use extra sharp white cheddar and shred it myself. I use "hot" sausage to give a little extra kick. Finally, I bake for 25 minutes at 350 degrees. Delicious!

I love making these. I suggest a small to medium onion finely chopped. A teaspoon of hot sauce, and garlic powder to taste. I almost always use sage sausage it gives them that extra kick my family loves.

These are good.  First off I am glad I read the reviews first as I was debating over cooking the sausage first or not, but the raw greasy sausage makes since for the moisture.  I used pepperjack cheese instead for an extra kick.  Very good.

These are great just as the recipe reads, but also as a great base for any additions or personal fave cheese or sausage, even adding vegetables. I use Reynolds Wrap non-stick foil and works better than parchment paper. If you want a little less greasy, one of those metal racks with holes in it put on top of a cooling rack, sprayed with non-stick spray makes it real easy to remove them. Enjoy!

These are weird. I thought this recipe looked tasty and I followed it to a T. It turned out that the sausage balls taste like already been chewed up sausage biscuits. I a sharp cheese in them too and it's not even noticeable. Oh well. I won't be making these again.

Sausage balls (this particular recipe) have been made in my Southern family for decades.  Room-temperature sausage definitely makes these easier to mix, and freshly shredded cheese is also better, IMHO.  I usually use the hot Jimmy Dean Sausage.  We love these!  Mix them well, bake, and enjoy!

These are delicious. I used to make these and they seemed so hard, but after reading the tips from other reviewers, they are easy to make and less greasy. Can't make enough of these for my kids on the weekends!

Can you say "zip-locked" baggie?  After reading others having a hard time working the biscuit mix in, I decided to use one of those "zig-zag" tater mashers.  That worked okay then the light bulb went off.  So I turned a gallon "zip-lock" bag inside out, stuck my hand inside and scooped up the mixture into the bag.  Now the mixture is on the inside and I just kinda flipped it so I could zip it up.  I kneaded the biscuit mix into the sausage, stuck in the fridge for a bit to harden back up, added the cheese to the bag and kneaded that into the mixture.  The warmth of my hands helped to get the cheese mixed in. I must say, it was pretty easy doing it this way.  Then I stuck the bag into fridge to harden a bit while the oven preheated.  Using a paper towel, I "greased" the baking pan(s) with olive oil and baked.  They didn't stick because they cooled while I was panning up the next batch.  I gave them a little twist and off they came.  No greasy mess, either.  They taste pretty good too.  Will be making these often!

Best I ever made thanks to these tips from other reviewers. All ingredients room temp, mix sausage and biscuit mix thoroughly and then mix in finely shredded cheese. Bake for 20 minutes and cool in a tightly covered container lined with paper towels. I used hot sausage and extra sharp cheddar.

To anyone who has never had sausage balls, you MUST make these. This is the exact recipe that my family has used for decades. Use a greasy sausage because healthier versions make the Bisquick puffier than it is suppose to be. Try this traditional recipe before you start to tweek it for yours. Enjoy!

Fantastic! This is a great little appetizer for those impromptu get-togethers you don't have much time to prepare for.  My husband (aka the pickiest person in the world) will eat these as fast as I can make them.  Thanks for a great recipe! (I also cook them on a baking rack to allow the grease to drain and I have never had a less-than-perfect batch.)

Great recipe! I followed the instructions exactly, however it was missing one piece of information. THe first time I made these, I prepared the bisquit mix, like made it wet. The recipe came out terrible. But it was my fault, because you're suposed to add the mix dry :) heh. They came out great the second time! I serve them with ranch dressing that has a little horseradish and a little paprika mixed in. Yum!

Disappointed with this recipe.  I tried different sauces to dip them in and the only thing I liked about these sausage balls was the sauce they were dipped in. Will not make again.

I suggest allowing all the ingredients to come to room temperature before mixing, otherwise you may have difficulty getting them to stick together.  I did not cook the sausage prior to mixing and baked them for about 17 minutes.  I think I'll keep these on hand often for 'breakfast on the run'!

mmmmm these were delicious!  i might add a little crushed red pepper next time to give it a little more spice.  i used hot sausage & freshly grated 2% sharp cheddar cheese.  after mixing those, i added the bisquick and it mixed really well together.  i refridgerated it overnight and cooked them the next day!  it definitely takes about 15-20 minutes to cook, especially if you like them a little brown on top like i do!

Cooked for 18 minutes.  Suggest a cookie sheet with a lip all around to avoid grease dripping on the bottom on the oven.  Also, cooking on parchment paper is suggested

These were great.  I made them for breakfast this morning.  The sausage I used Jimmy Dean was not greasy at all.  They did need to cook longer to be golden brown.  I baked mine for 16 min.  I would definitely make these again.

These are the best sausage balls I have ever made. The amount of bisquick is perfect, wouldn't change the recipe at all. I carried these to a tailgating party and they were a big hit.

Bottom line... needs more biscuit mix.  I made exactly by the recipe using Jimmy Dean hot sausage and sharp cheddar that I grated myself.  They were good, but a cup more of biscuit mix would be better.  They were too greasy.  I have made sausage balls many times and I find that if the mix is dry, just add a little water.  This mix was too moist, with all the fat from cheese & sausage.  It was really easy to roll the balls, but there wasn't enough dough to them.  I made them again with 3 cups biscuit mix and they were perfect.

Sorry guys, I love sausage balls but I was not crazy about this recipe. The mix was too dry, had to add water. The final product tasted like biscuits. The only suggestion I would make is to add less baking mix. I won't try this particular recipe again.

Excellent!  Everyone loves these! I followed a similar recipe in the past, which uses 2 1/2 cups cheese (10 oz.), and it was fine (yields 60 balls).  I prefer using Jimmy Dean's 'hot' sausage - it's really not spicy at all, but has more flavor.  Be sure and note that you mix RAW sausage in this recipe.  I baked mine for 15 minutes, turning once (or bottoms get too brown).  Perfect!  Thanks for posting the recipe!  Now I have it online!  Note that you can make this with hot turkey (ground) sausage and reduced fat cheese - awesome!  Just be sure and add 1 tsp. sage + 1/8 tsp. marjarom to give it a little more flavor.

My mom's recipe only has 1 c. cheese & 3 c biscuit mix and I always thought they could be better...  I can't swear I used the whole pound of cheese (used 2 handfuls per batch), but wow!  These are AWESOME!  I always make them with hot sausage but the decreased biscuit mix really makes the flavor stand out - they are PERFECT!  I doubled the recipe, cooked them on a wire rack (as others had suggested) & cooked both batches at once at 400 for 15 minutes.  They are to die for - not too dry, not too greasy, just right.  Will most definitely make these again (probably this holiday weekend since this batch unfortunately is for a work luncheon).  

Hint: mixing is much easier if the sausage and cheese are at room temp.

MAKE THESE - YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!!!!!!

This is the same recipe I've used for years.  There is no chance for dry sausage balls with this recipe because the mixture is just right.  You will definitely need to increase the cooking time to about 20 minutes though.

These are fantastic.  I served them at a bridal shower several months ago.  It takes awhile to get the mixture to combine but I think it's helpful to a Kitchenaid with the dough hook attachment.  I like these best with Jimmy Dean HOT sausage.  They freeze well (uncooked) also.

These are always a hit at work potlucks!  My grandmother gave me this exact recipe one christmas and I have been making them this way ever since!  Make sure you use good quality sausage (I use Jimmy Dean)- the cheaper the sausage quality the greasier the end result!  I also prefer "hot" sausage- it really doesn't make the sausage balls spicy, just gives them a nice flavor!

The first time I made these I followed the recipe as written and I thought they were too dry.  The next time, I used hot sausage, only 1 cup of biscuit mix and I used two cups of pre-packaged shredded chedder and liked them much better.

I had these once at a potluck and was glad to find this recipe, these are so good, my little ones like them also.
One thing I'd like to add, a little embarrasing but when I first saw a similar recipe on a jimmy dean package I cooked the sausage first.
It didn't specify and I couldn't imagine using raw sausage.
Needless to say, they didn't turn out. ;P
Anyway thanks for sharing.

I made these yesterday for my husbands bowling league Christmas party/dinner and instead of the Bisquick, I used cornbread stuffing.  They were AWESOME!  My grandson is a picky eater and he loved these.  He asked me to make some extra for him.  

I didn't go "exactly" by the recipe but found if I used equal parts of everything, like a lb. of sausage, 1 box of stuffing and 1 bag of shredded cheese, they were perfect.

I would say these are a definate make again appetizer.

My friends mom used to make these. She always laid them out on some parchment paper on a cookie sheet and stuck them in the freezer. She freezer bagged them once they froze and could pull out as many or few as she needed.

I don't like sausage balls-but if that is what you are after-these fit the bill. My husband did say they were a little dry, but was surprised when I said I would not make them again. They do not make good appetizers, bacuase they do not taste good cold. Make sure you can serve them warm, or try another recipe!

Yuck!  I thought this was going to be like taking a bite of a sausage cheese buscuit.  It is nothing like that.  It is a hunk of greasy sausage made even greasier by adding cheese.

I mixed everything up in my kitchenaid mixer and it was a snap!  I did have to cook mine a little longer than 10 minutes, more like 30-15, maybe mine were just bigger.  I didn't have any trouble with it sticking together though.  I think I used a little less cheese.

I couldn't find my recipe for sausage balls, so I used this one.  They turned out great!  I used sharp cheddar cheese, and hot sausage.  It had just the right amount of burn.  I took them to a christmas party, and they were a hit!  My husband was so disappointed that there weren't any left.

These are great cold, hot or room temp. I made everything in the food processor. Mixed low-fat bisquick and sausage (Jimmy Dean Hot), then mixed 2% Sharp Cheese with a little Crushed Red Pepper Flakes. Break batch up in half if using Food Processor. Cooked it 15 minutes instead of 10. EXCELLENT!!

They were a little hard to mix together so I added an egg and a touch of milk to make them roll easier, it really helps. They are flavorful and easy. Mine took longer to cook, about 15-20 minutes, although I might have rolled them larger. Will make again!

Perfect amount of each ingredient. A stand mixers is a must. I first mix the sausage and cheese, then add the bisquick. I use a stone to bake mine and bake for about 20 min. (until golden brown). Remove from baking sheet immediatly to avoid soaking up grease.

Remember not to cook the sausage before you mix it with the other ingrediants.  
My favorite twist is to use Hot sausage and pepper jack cheese! 
And of course some more red pepper flakes to make them very spicy!

I made these for my holiday open house and they were gone by the end of the evening. I didn't add all the cheese called for. As is, they were cheesy enough. I think they would've been way too greasy with that much cheese. I liked how they weren't so dry like others with so much baking mix in them. I added some cayenne pepper to mine and they were good. Thanks!

Very tasty even though I over-cooked them.  I made them with turkey sausage & was a little concerned about cooking them for such a short time period.  I will definately be making these again.

These mix best if the ingredients are close to  room temperature. Also, I only used about 10 ounces of cheddar.

I didn't like these at first - I think I was expecting the balls to be very dense and sausage-y. When I realized the balls are supposed to be bready and more like biscuits, I really liked them for what they were. I think they would be particularly good with syrup or sausage gravy as a breakfast treat! :)

This recipe is always a big hit!  I took this to a church gathering and they really gobbled them up! Experiment with various sausages for variety.  I agree with othere - use a SHARP cheese as American or Velveta would be almost flavorless.

I mixed these with Cheesy Bisquik Biscuit mix and it was way too greasy!! I think between the sausage AND the cheese AND the cheese in the Cheesy Bisquik mix, it was too much! I love sausage balls and i think these would have been great if I used PLAIN biscuit mix. Thanks-

I remember these when I was a kid--going over to my friend's house on Christmas day and eating these by the dozens!!  This was a very easy recipe to follow. I made a half batch, which is good because I got about 32 sausage balls out of it!!  I used mild cheddar cheese and hickory smoked sausage (Jimmy Dean) and it worked out great.

Just OK - I had a hard time getting the mix to form a ball ... I had to add water.  They were a bit dry.  I might use them again, but probably not.

These are a family favorite. I make them every year. I whisk in 3/4 teaspoon of cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon of hot pepper flakes to the Bisquick mix to spice it up a bit. I also mix all ingredients with the kneading attachment on my mixer until all ingredients are combined, about six minutes. Then I place them on a rack to let the grease drip onto a baking sheet and bake as directed.

This is a pretty basic recipe and my kids all love them.  The instructions could be written a little better.  Definitely use an electric mixer to mix the ingredients or else its so hard to get it all combined.  Also, do not precook the sausage.

I love these sausage balls and this recipe.  I took the advice of other reviewers and mixed the sausage and flour first, then added the grated cheese at room temperature.  My first batch was cooked on my cooling rack to allow the grease to drain.  Unfortunately the balls separated and dripped through the rack.  Fortunately my husband was happy to eat the rejects.  Second batch was cooked on my broiler pan and turned out perfectly for the “company” version.  Win Win!

I like these but they were a little dry.  Might throw a little pancake syrup on them to serve.  I also added some dried parsley to them for color and taste.  These are way better than the frozen ones at the market.

It’s too dry, and no, I didn’t cook the sausage first. There should be 2 lbs sausage to balance out the 2 cups of baking mix and 2 cups (1 lb) cheese. I make this recipe once a year, sometimes 2ce, always forget this. I guess I should write that down, because the internet has failed, and this recipe, has failed me.

These turned out perfectly! I lined a large baking sheet with foil then placed a cooling rack in the pan so sausage balls did not sit in the grease. Easy clean up too is a bonus!

I make these every year and they are always a hit. Here are a few of my tips. 

I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage.  I add a teaspoon of cayenne pepper and 1/2 of hot pepper flakes and whisk those ingredients in with the bisquick to evenly spread the pepper throughout. I grate my cheese in a food processor for the quickness. Next I use the kneading hook of my mixer to throughly mix the ingredients. Mix until all dry ingredients are incorporated. I place the balls on a rack inside a baking sheet to drain grease as they cook. 

I hope these tips help.

This is such an easy recipe, and so full of flavor! I took another reviewer's suggestion and mixed it all up in a gallon zip-lock baggie for simple clean up. You just have to knead thoroughly. I used Delia's all natural chicken sausage from Kroger, which is our favorite, and is not as greasy as pork sausage. It made for the perfect amount of moistness in the rolls without all the excess grease drippings. I did add a 1/2 cup of milk to the mix to make it easier to knead, and for added moisture, and put in about a teaspoon each of smoked paprika and onion granules to ramp up the flavor a bit. I kneaded the mix well in the bag, then flattened it out to about 3/4 inch or more. When I got ready to bake them, I just cut the baggie open and used a jigger to cut it into circles. You can make them bigger if you want, but I found that made perfect, approximately 1 1/4 inch balls. I just laid them out like miniature biscuits on silicone lined cookie sheets and baked for 25 min. Scrumptious!

Love these. When I got to the last few balls, they weren't holding together quite as well, so I added an egg and they turned out beautifully - golden and fluffy. I think I'll add a couple of eggs at the beginning next time.

I made this with both standard and gluten-free bisquick. They both turned out well. I made two alterations that were a big hit. First, I added about a teaspoon of Garam Masala when kneading. The spices gave it a nice lift, especially the cinnamon overtones, which were great for the holidays. Second, after the balls were on the baking pan I added two drops of maple syrup onto each--just a tiny bit. The sweetness really rounded them out, conjuring a pancakes and sausage moment, except with a kick from that spicy cheese.

I added about 1/4 c. milk to make it easier to work with as I was mixing.  I also used pork sausage with sage. Cover with foil to maintain moisture!  Remove after 10 minutes, turned each ball over, and cook an additional 10 minutes.  They were great!  I made a dipping sauce with 1/2 c. Hellmanns mayo, 1/2 c. sour cream, 1/2 c. Apricot/pineapple jelly, and 1 T. Mustard (regular not dry).  Adjust to your own taste. I had so many compliments that I'm making it again tonight for another party!

This is SO good!  Reminds me of the sausage balls that my grandmother made.  I followed the recipe exactly and did follow the suggestions of others to make the process a little easier.  I used fresh (from the farm!) ground pork sausage and sharp cheddar.  I used my mixer with the dough hook to blend the sausage and Bisquick.  A tip for easily "shredding" the cheese...cut the 1 pound block into 8 cubes.  Working with 2 cubes at a time, grind the cheese up in your food processor.  You can control how small the cheese is shredded by how long you run it in the food processor.  I ground mine fairly small.  Back to the mixer with the cheese and let the mixer do the work.  With damp hands, roll into balls.  I got about 60 quarter size balls.  I baked some on a rack over a baking sheet and the other batch on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.  I had better luck with the parchment paper.  Not much grease cooked off and they came right off the paper.  The batch on the rack stuck but were still delicious.  I would not suggest adding ANY liquid (other than the tiny bit of water that will come off of your damp hands).  These are GOOD!

This is a GREAT recipe!  This is my second time making it and the first time was a bit of a struggle, with all of the reviews I didn't know what to do. But this time things went soooooooo much better. I used my KitchenAid stand mixer to mix everything (I did NOT precooked the meat) and I used wax paper instead of foil and everything turned out great. I WILL be making this recipe again :)

A little added twist to these tried and true gems! Cut the cheddar cheese back to 12 oz. (3/4 lb.) and add in 4 oz. cream cheese.

Adds a little "zip" in the taste, but mostly it keeps the sausage balls a little more moist when cooking to make sure the sausage balls are cooked enough in the middle.

No complaints just as they are and would certainly not let the lack of having cream cheese stop me from making them!!

I got this recipe when I was a child from an older southern lady at my church.  She made these up in huge batches and kept them in the freezer for when guests came by.  You never left that house without a sausage ball!  I like to make them with hot sausage (I like Jimmy Dean) and just a little less cheese, maybe 12 oz.  DO NOT cook the sausage!  It takes a while to get it all incorporated, but start with room temp. sausage and just get in there with your hands.  The heat from your hands helps everything to combine.

These have been a favorite of mine since childhood. What makes these over the top for me is getting block cheese and shredding it. The difference between this extra step and buying pre-shredded cheese is significant. Also, I layer half the sausage/bisquick/cheese in my Kitchenaid mixer and mix it all up on medium low speed. Then I layer in the other half of the ingredients. It makes things so fast and easy, plus gets the consistency right.

I have been making this same recipe for nearly 40 years and I have always used Johnsonville Italian Sausage. I do not get grease dripping from them and they are always moist. Not sure why people are commenting on pre-cooking sausage and not pre-cooking. No where in the recipe does it say to pre-cook. The foot note to recipe says that PRE-COOKED SAUSAGE BALLS may be frozen. I make two batches of these at the same time and freeze leftovers for later use.

I have made this recipe before, so I didn't read the directions or reviews carefully, and I cooked the sausage first.  As I wondered why the mix wasn't binding, I read again.  Oops!  I'm sure I won't be the last one to make this mistake!  For those who do, add a beaten egg and 1/2 cup of milk.  Then you can either make balls or a giant square.  bake as the original recipe states. (Assuming you'll actually read it!)

My Aunt used to make these for the Holidays for as long as I can remember. Now living in Albuquerque, NM I was inclined to add green chili to this recipe. Let me tell you that green chili has taken this dish to the next level.

I love this recipe.  I modified a few things and everyone loves the changes.   I use a roll of hot sausage instead of regular sausage.  I add in diced jalapeno, a little onion and then bisquik and cheese.  It sounds like it would be incredibly spicy but it's just right.   I even roll these mini sausage forms and wrap puff pastry around them and cook until the puff pastry is golden (pre-cook the sausage roll for about 10 mins before adding pastry).

We used to of the 10oz packs of Jimmy Dean instead of 16oz of pork sausage.  It turned out great.  We had them for breakfast.  As others have said, do not pre-cook the sausage.

I prefer to cook the sausage first so that my sausage balls are not greasy, and then add 1/4 cup buttermilk so they are not dry. It makes a wonderfully moist sausage ball.

I made these for our office breakfast party today. Co-workers raved, and several asked for the recipe. I used locally made chicken-green onion sausage and 2 c. of shredded Italian cheese mix. I'd suggest to back off a bit on the cheese, maybe 1-1/2c instead of 2 cups; as much as I kneaded it, some of it didn't get incorporated into the mix. Otherwise, it made a very picky group very happy - thanks!!!

I use the 2, 2, 2 method.  2 lb. sausage (1 hot & 1 mild), 2 c. Bisquik mix, and 2 (8 oz.) packages Extra Sharp Cheddar fresh-grated.  That adds moisture and makes yummy sausage balls.

I used the sausage and medium cheddar. Even using this the sausage balls were on the bland side and the Bisquick was too much. I suggest cutting back on the Bisquick mix by at least a 1/2 C. Next time I think I will also use some red pepper flakes and a true sharp cheese. IMO, if you make these you will definitely want to add some zest to them.

Just pre-made these for Thanksgiving, so they went straight to the freezer! I used colby-jack instead of cheddar. Had to hide them from my son cause he would have eaten all thirty! Yummy!!!Definitely use parchment paper, then you can peel up the delicious pieces of cheese that melt off beneath them!

I made this twice.  Once with the sausage right out of the fridge.....then I let the sausage sit for 30 mins and it made a huge difference.  We preferred the batch that had the larger 2" size balls.  Mine were done at exactly 20 mins using a thermometer to check.  Using parchment paper is key to this recipe.

Delicious, easy, and a crowd pleaser. Agree with a previous suggestion to mix the Bisquick and cheese before adding the meat. Also, it will take a few minutes to really combine the ingredients, but if you don't mind getting your hands dirty, it does work better and faster, if you knead the mixture by hand. 

We had plenty of leftovers at breakfast, but I can't attest to the freezing and reheating process because my family ate them all by the end of the day! This will be a new staple to complement my brunch menus.

they were dry but everyone loved them.  I served them with apple butter, which I think really made the dish.  I also made these with vegan sausage and they were pretty good too.  I would not eat them with out the apple butter.

Sorry, but me and my family were not a fan. They were really salty and just not for our taste buds and I usually like anything. Good consistency, but just lacking in flavor (even though I seasoned the meat). To cut down in A LOT of grease I placed them on a baking rack and put that on a baking sheet and cooked them.

Great recipe. Tastes awesome.  If you let the sausage and cheese sit out for a little while before mixing then you only need to cook for 20 minutes otherwise it takes longer.  The only problem I've come into is that they flatten out a little bit and don't hold their shape.

  I use a fresh ground sausage from a meat market that doesn't have tons of fat.  I also added a little bit of grated onion and jalapeno.

Simple and tastes amazing!  I did cut the cheese down to 8 ounces and I like it much better. It's a thought to consider when making.

I have made these exactly as the recipe is written for years.  They have never been dry.  I think it has probably already been said, but the secret is to set the sausage and cheese out to come to room temp before mixing.  I mix sauasge and biscuit mix very well and then add the cheese last and mix well.  If I take them to a party I never have leftovers.  If I make them just for my family the leftovers freeze well.

I add about 1/4 of a package of cream cheese to this receipe.  It keeps them moist even cold.  Really good if you are making a lot of them and have leftovers. They also cook faster if you make the sausage balls a bit smaller. I make the dough the night before. With the added cream cheeze it stays moist. Just cover dough with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

This is the recipe I have used for years and they are always a hit!  I love to use hot sausage to spice them up a bit.  And I always bake on the pizza stone, so it absorbs the grease and they are never too greasy.  Of course they don't last long enough to notice any!

My wife has been making these for as long as I've known her.  I love them.  However, as much as I love sausage with cheese, you really don't need a pound of cheese to one pound of sausage.  We use one 12 oz pack to one pound sausage AT MOST.  Also, a dash of crushed red pepper is nice.  Otherwise, 2 thumbs up!

Sausage + Cheese = Love

I have had these many times in the past, as a guest I always asked for the recipe, now I found one.

These are a great snack and treat for anytime, good snack sized comfort food.

Excellent recipe.  My only complaint is that the Cook Time listed under the photo says 20 minutes (correct time), but the directions say 10 minutes.  I know the overage is covered by the, "until golden brown," but almost had a throw down with the wife who thought I found the wrong recipe on my ipad app.  I search 40 or so reviews and did not see this mentioned...

These weren't bad but they weren't great either. I think the bottom line is they need more cheese a spicier sausage and some seasonings as the recipes made the way it calls is bland. May make again with some tweaks.

The recipe is good, but you definitely need to cook longer!  I baked for 45 minutes, and added french fried onions like the custom version called for.  Delicious.

Just as my darling husband's mother always made...he was thrilled I could recreate them for him! I wouldn't change a thing (just make sure the sausage you choose is a nice fatty kind to keep the balls moist)

I couldn't make it home for Christmas this year, and was disappointed that I was going to miss the sausage balls. I tried this recipe out and was surprised. It was my first attempt but they turned out great. I've made them twice in three days.

Amazing!  The suggestion from another to mix the sausage and bisquick first is spot on.  Then add the cheese.

I made this for an office potluck at Christmas. I used 1 lb regular sausage, one pack garlic-butter Bisquick (1.5 cups), about 1/2 to 3/4 lb extra sharp cheddar and added seasoning (sage, garlic pepper, onion salt). Shaped into 35 one-bite size and 35 two-bite size balls. Cooked on parchment @ 350 for 30 minutes, drained on paper towels twice and put in fridge overnight. I tried a couple hot and the next morning cold. I thought they were better cold!  During cooking they lost the round shape and morphed into clusters, but still stuck together. The smaller ones were crispy on the bottom which was a bonus! They turned out YUMMY. I served them room temp at work and the people who had never had sausage balls thought they were very good, and my southern coworker, a sausage ball veteran, also gave it a thumbs up.

Made some of these.  Family APPROVED!  Even the picky little one loved them.  Followed recipe exactly.  Perfect.  Doesn't need anything else.  Used the gloves and got my hands in there.  Mixing is a work out.  So worth it!

These are great on there on.  However, if you want to add a little variety, wrap dough around a green olive and then bake.  Yum, Yum!

I have made this recipe for years and is a family favorite.  i noticed that some reviewers found this bland or dry.  try these hints:  buy the pre-grated cheddar and use the sharp kind. use HOT sausage. have both at room temp.  i always add the bisquick last and add it a little at a time to make sure there is a good balance of ingredients.  also you have to mix this with your hands

These were ok, but a bit dry. I followed directions as they were. Next time I think I will use a 1/2 cup less of the bisquick.

This was my first attempt at sausage balls, and they are DIVINE. I've made this recipe at least 8 or 9 times now and it does not disappoint. A few suggestions: I do not use 2 full cups of baking mix, it is too dry...I put in 1.5 and then a tiny bit extra. Also, I use 3/4 of a pound of sharp cheddar (not the whole block), and I grate it by hand. I made these recently for a wedding shower and had rave reviews. They also refrigerate well! Thanks for the recipe, Stephanie!

GREASY, DRY & RAW. I am not even sure how you get those 3 things in one recipe! I followed these to the detail, after the 10 minute cooking they were raw in the center. After cooking another 10 minutes ( 20 total) they lacked flavor. When picked up grease dripped from them. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is I feel this is a great "starter/basic" recipe to add my own flavor too

I have to make these for Christmas morning "appetizers" while the rest of the breakfast is cooking and we are waiting on the rest of the family to arrive. I make them ahead of time and freeze and then travel to my parents house (12 hours) with them. Not sure they would let me come without them ;)

Our family loves these.  Sons went away to college and came back with this recipe.  I have a hard time with so much fat, so I use low fat sausage and low fat biscuit mix and of course real cheddar cheese.  They taste just as good, but are at least a little healthier.

I recently made these for a cocktail party. I rolled them in my hands into a shape about the size of my little finger and curved them, after baking them and cooling--I stored in a tin. These were deliciously crunchy, and a hit with my guests.

Okay I don't know what if anything I did wrong here but these just didn't turn out. They tasted like really greasy sausage flavored balls of bread. I was expecting something more like a meatball but this was way more like bread than anything else. We all tried to eat them but couldn't.  Maybe it was just us or maybe I messed them up since so many people here gave them such good reviews? Thanks for the idea though.

These are easy and tasty! I add garlic and onion powder (can't live with out em) for some added flavor. I usually use the garlic herb biscuit mixes that can be found in the baking aisle; they really add to the flavor. These are great appetizers to bring to a potluck. They disappear quickly from the buffet line. I will make these again and again. Thanks!

Good recipe. You can freeze any leftovers and re-heat as needed which is a big help.  I used one 2-cup bag of shredded cheese and found it to be more than adequate. I also made the mistake of making them too big which will take longer to cook. Made the second batch much smaller and they turned out better. Pork sausage is not something you want to under cook.

I wish I could give this recipe 10 stars!  This is a simple recipe with few ingredients and is sooooo versatile.  By changing the type of sausage or the cheese used, you can make this recipe your own.  I have found that using chicken sausage instead of pork sausage works better for me.  So many people I know don't eat pork, and the lower calorie count doesn't hurt either.  The chicken sausage gives the recipe a milder sausage taste, which I like.  If you want a little "kick" in the flavor, use pepperjack cheese. I also lightly grease the pan prior to baking.  The chicken is not as greasy as the pork and may stick.  I have also used Scone mix instead of muffin mix (supermarket was out of muffin mix), and the recipe turned out just fine.  If you keep the size of the balls small, you won't have to precook the meat as others have suggested.  Just be sure to have a copy of this recipe on hand when you serve it!

This Yankee made some Sausage Balls... and they were ok.  I used Jimmy Dean and maybe because I didn't use a full pound of shredded cheddar they were shockingly NOT greasy. They were also mini-hockey pucks.  We liked the taste, dipped into Peppercorn Ranch.  Guido did the hand-mixing, I hate when stuff gets up under my nails.  Mix cheese in LAST.  Use parchment.  Don't eat too many.

We make these every Christmas as appetizers and they always go so fast! I usually do a few different flavors of sausage... hot, sage, and maple. For the maple ones I add about 1/4 cup of maple syrup and they taste like McGriddles. :)

These were delicious! I made them a bit smaller than walnut size, and I cooked them longer than recommended. The tip of mixing the meat with the mix first before adding the cheese definitely helped! These were so, so good and would definitely make them again!

I got all this stuff mixed, rolled and baked and out the door in about an hour. I found out at the last minute I was supposed to bring something to a holiday party- and these were a life saver. They were the hit of the party. I cooked them on parchment paper, so they slid right off. I used Jimmy Dean sausage Hot and Mild mixed together (it was all I had), and sharp cheddar.  I formed the balls with the raw sausage- about 1 inch in diameter  They were a little greasy-but what do we expect? These are sausage balls! That is like complaining that ice cream is cold!! I just slid them off onto a plate lined with paper towels while the others were cooking.  I ended up making more that weekend for us to snack on around the house!!

So easy to make...this is my new Bunco appetizer.  The only thing I did differently was to add an egg, because I thought the mixture was too dry.  The sausages came out moist on the inside and crisp on the outside.

I am snowed in, and can't make it to Christmas dinner, or the grocery store. I happened to have the ingredients for this, with a couple minor changes. Turkey sausage instead of pork, and 8 oz. sharp cheddar and 8 oz. Monterrey Jack. Lacks the "sharp" flavor, which I miss, but still delish.

You can't go wrong with Sausage balls.  Well, I did.  Kinda.  I followed a review of another recipe.  It said to cut-down on the fat, precook the sausage.  Fail.  Don't do it!  The balls don't really hold together right, and they kind of melt down when baking.  If you're busting hump to make the balls, do it the right way and forget about the fat.  The 1st batch just came out of the oven, but I'm hoping they'll firm up a bit when they cool and the cheese hardens back up.  Other than that, these are phenomenal.  The taste is there - they just look odd.   :)  Hey, you don't if you'll fail if you don't try at least once!

I made these for myself and 3 men. There are none left so I must say, they must be good. I thought they were going to be too biscuity, and they did border on it, but they were still very addictive. I served with a sauce my friend told me about, (1 cup mayo, 1 tbsp mustard) and that help with the dryness of the baking mix. I will make again. Very easy.

Five stars for wonderful flavor! I used Jimmy Dean Original sausage, and I may like to try hot sausage next time for a bit more bite. These were a bit more labor intensive than I had expected. I brought the sausage to almost room temp before mixing and mixed it with the biscuit mix first as other reviewers suggested. I mixed with a knife, and that helped a lot to break up the sausage and help the biscuit mix stick to it. I suggest cooking these on parchment paper - they slide right off that way. Use a new sheet for each batch, though because otherwise they will get greasy. This made a lot more than 30 for me. It was at least 50. I may try grated instead of shredded cheese next time; since there is no real binding agent you really have to work to get the cheese to stick to the sausage/biscuit mix. A good bit of work, but very tasty end product!

I have been making a similar version to this for years and they are fantastic! So simple and delicious. If I make them in the morning I serve with warm maple syrup. If it's the evening, with a miracle whip and mustard dip. Just be sure to use hot sausage and to mix completely before forming into balls. The extra arm work is totally worth it in the end!

I love these!! I've been making them since I was a teen. I love sweet/savory combinations, so I use Jimmy Dean lean maple flavor sausage and sharp cheddar cheese (yes, grate your own). After I bake them (25 min.), we dip them in maple syrup (or pancake syrup). So good for breakfast!!!

These were incredibly easy to make and bake up beautifully.  I used a baking sheet lined w/parchment paper and a medium size mellon baller to make the balls.  The process was quick and I got 38 same size balls. I didn't experience any greasiness that some reviewers have either.   I baked for about 16 minutes since they were a little bigger than walnut size.  With that said, I never had sausage balls before, so I'm not sure if they just were not my thing or maybe I just wasn't hungry enough b/c I thought these were just okay.  The reason for the 5 stars is b/c my son and his friend almost wiped them out.  They said they were great!!  I still have a couple left from last night and I think I'll do another taste test to see if I've changed my mind.  The ease and simplicity of making these is begging me to fall in love w/them.  Hopefully I'll have changed my mind, lol!

I made these for a brunch baby shower - I made four batches of this recipe and ended up with ~190 sausage balls.  I used "hot" sausage (not cooked) and I shredded my own extra sharp cheese in a food processor.  I followed the recommendation of another reviewer who suggested mixing the sausage & the bisquick together in a kitchen-aid stand mixer with the dough hook and then add in the cheese.  It worked out great!

My friend used to make these for her annual Christmas party and shared the recipe with me. I love them and thought I would try them out for a shower I am throwing in a few weeks.  They are delicious, but I would suggest using a bit less flour.  I used two cups, 1 bag of cheese (next time I will shred my own) and 1 roll of Jimmy Dean sausage. I got about 18 balls out this batch. I'm not sure how someone else got 60 - you'd have to make them pretty small. I am thinking if I were to make it for a party of 25 or so people I would have to triple the recipe just to allow them to have 2 to 4 a piece.

These were super yummy and easy to make. I took suggestions from another reviewer and cooked them on a slotted pan with a cookie sheet underneath to catch the grease. I also cooked them for 25 minutes at 350 to get them cooked all the way through. It made 28 balls.

Pretty good but not exceptional for me. The first batch I made on a cookie sheet with a lip. They were WAY too greasy; spread out and burnt on the bottom. Those were thrown in the freezer for easy breakfast food. Second batch, I read reviews and baked on a wire rack over the same lipped cookie sheet. They were much better, but so messy.

These really are good, but are usually saved for special occasions in this family. When I make them, I'll usually add a little more sage, a tbsp. of brown sugar and sometimes, a touch of maple flavoring. To be a little "upscale", I serve them as is with an onion-chive dip at parties. My husband and kids fight over the leftovers.

We used Bob Evans hot sausage but just didn't think they had enough "sausage taste" ... I will make this again but will probably tweak the seasoning.  Thanks for previous reviewers' tips about sausage and bisquick mixed first, then add cheese.  That helped.  Use fresh grated cheese (I shredded it in the food processor to save time) to avoid dry bagged shredded cheese, which is harder to mix in.  My husband is from the south and remembered having these as a child ... I had never had them before but liked them!

These were great & simple.  There was a tip given in a review that I used and it made a big difference.  Mix the bisquick & sausage thoroughly and THEN add the cheese.  I made these for Christmas eve and I am making these tonight for bookclub.  Great snack!

If you didn't follow directions (like me) and mix it all with raw sausage - you CAN salvage your ingredients!  I mixed everything together with cooked sausage and realized it wasn't wet enough... obviously.  So, I just added about 2/3 cup milk and 1 egg.  That helped bind it all together and I didn't waste my ingredients.  It was more of a small biscuit with sausage and cheese - but still ended up tasting pretty good!  ...They really need to work on clarifying the raw meat thing for those of us who dive right in and make it before reading reviews. :)

For those with a gluten intolerance, substitute the biscuit mix with Pamela's "gluten free" baking and pancake mix.  There is no difference in the taste!  I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage and only 8 oz block of sharp cheddar instead of a whole pound.  Shredding the cheese yourself does make a difference. Cooked them until they browned on top on jelly roll pan lined with Reynold's Wrap Release almuninum foil so they did not stick.  These have always been great for Christmas morning breakfast!

These are exellent and easy to make. If your mixture is a little too stiff or you don't have 20 mins to let the sausage to get to room temp - simply add a tablespoon of cooking oil to the mixture which helps the ingredients mix a little easier.

These were excellent! I mixed the sausage with biscuit mix first, then after those were well combined I added the cheese. I cooked on parchment paper resting on a wire rack slightly tilted for about 20-23 minutes. This got the bottoms crispy and allowed grease to drain off into a pan. I used spicy sausage and these were devoured at a Thanksgiving party. One word of advice, my Artisan Kitchenaid was not quite strong enough to mix this up. You have to get your hands dirty :)

I think these were a little too cheesy.  While baking, the cheese melted and spread out, making the bottoms of the sausage balls flat and connected together with a cheesy crust.  The flavor was good though.  I actually thought they tasted better the next day COLD, right out the refrigerator.  If I make them again, I will definitely cut back on the cheese.

I followed advice of the other reviewers who thought it was dry, so I decreased the baking mix to 1 1/2 cups and used 1 1/2 cups cheese!..  I also used spicy sausage but it still was a little bland... Next time I'll add a little garlic salt and maybe some red pepper flakes.  I served it with a mustard dipping sauce but my youngest ate them with ketchup!  Also for the size of my balls 2" I had to increase cooking time to about 17 min.. Pretty good!

I made these for an office function, and every one was raving about them.  i followed a few of the reviews advice.  i mixed the biscuit and sausage first, and then added the cheese (only 8 oz of cheese).  i first baked them on a cookie sheet, but they burned on the bottom, so i followed another tip to put a cooling rack on top of the sheet and then put the sausage balls on the cooling rack. I also cooked for 20 min.  They turned out great!

I did this with regular sausage and it was far to bland.  I agree with all the other reviews that the cooking time was way off (unless you cooked the sausage first you could bake for 10 minutes)so I set the timer for 20 minutes.  Would recommend using hot sausage or add various seasoning to add flavor or an extrememly flavorful dip.

This is a really good basic recipe. There really is not much you can do to make sausage balls wrong. I made them with Jimmy Dean hot sausage and sharp hand grated cheddar cheese. Cooked them on the slotted pan to stop grease dripping. Hubby wanted something different for breakfast and he can eat them on his commute. He thought they were delicious. I think I may make some additions to the next batch and keep them "in stock".

These were great. I took the advice of others and added the cheese last. It was easy to mix that way. I also baked on a cookie rack with a cookie sheet lined with foil underneath and it was a mistake. I lost half of my sausage balls as they sagged through the rack and then stuck to the side/underside of the cookie rack. I think I would prefer to let them sit in their grease then place on paper towels.

These sausage balls are really good!  I'm surprised at some of the other negative reviews.  Last year I made a batch that called for 2 c. bisquick and 2 c. cheddar cheese.  They just didn't have enough flavor.  I think the trick is to use "hot" sausage (it really does not turn out to be too spicy) and allow your ingredients to come to room temp.  I had no problem binding the ingredients together.  The mix is dry, but you have to incorporate a little of the sausage in with the cheese and bisquick mix.  If you use all of your sausage in the beginning, then you will end up with dry sausage balls towards the end.  I hope this helps!  Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I gave it a "4 star" rating because the recipe as listed has too much cheese. I always used 2 cups bisquick and 2 cups cheese to 1 lb mild sausage. I believe there are about 4 cups of shredded cheese in a pound...so i used half of what this recipe calls for. Also...mix all ingredients together raw then bake. I don't think this recipe specifies that.

This is a recipe that I've been enjoying for some years and really enjoy.  Having 'forgotten' about it, I found my mouth watering thinking about it.  Many of the other reviewers' notes are right on with what I do: a tad more flour, mix in a large ziplock and finely-grated cheddar.  Also, I really like this recipe with the maple sausage (hot and regular are awesome too).  They're a great finger food as well as breakfast side- awesome dipped in maple syrup too.

This is the same standard recipe we have always used in our family.  You can't go wrong with a classic.  It is fun to play with the cheese and sausage combo's.  Sage/Sharp, Spicy/Pepper Jack, Maple/Mild...Make it your own with what you like.

Served these at a party.  Most people enjoyed these, but mostly my husband, I think he ate a dozen of them himself.  I only changed one thing in the recipe.  I used 1 cup buttermilk baking mix and 1 cup crushed herb stuffing.  I baked on a broiler as another reviewer suggested.

Mmmm.  Yummy. Albeit, this is the first time I have ever had sausage balls.  That's why the 4*, nothing to compare it to.  But, I don't think I need to go looking elsewhere.  Yummy and easy.  My kind of dish!!  =)

These are addictive, I can easily sit and eat this all day... I have made them many times, but usually I only use half the cheese and depending on the scale, sometimes I will use low-fat sausage. Have faith that the ingredients will come together without milk!!!! It takes time, but it will combine. It's a breeze with a kitchen aid mixer. Beware, if you add milk, you will end up with more of a biscuit texture and it has a definitely different mouth feel and taste, so depending on what you like, adjust accordingly. I personally would stick with the three ingredients listed and you can lose!

We used spicy Jimmy Dean sausage and Monteray Jack with jalapenos. We added one quarter cup of milk, rolled into one inch balls and placed on a cookie sheet to freeze. When we were ready to use them we took them out of the freezer, placed on parchment paper to cook. Baked about 25 minutes. Cooled for five minutes. Served with pizza sauce.

This recipe seems to have the correct proportion of everything.  I use just a tiny bit of water to hold the balls together if they won't bond.  Spicy sausage or a few red pepper flakes in the mix always adds to the flavor.  I also cook longer than the recommended time.  My mother's recipe always said "until golden brown and delicious."

I really like this recipe, these are the first sausage balls I ever fixed.  I did take suggestions from some of the previous reviews - I bake them for 25 minutes; I use parchment paper on my baking sheet.  The last bunch I made I substituted Pepper Jack cheese to spice them up a bit.

Very good, basic sausage balls.  I did add 2T of milk to help blend ingredients together and that worked well.  I used Jimmy Dean sausage and did not have any problems with too much grease in the pan.  This was my husband's family's first time having sausage balls and everyone liked them.

Wow!  I just pulled these out of the oven and they are the best sausage balls I have ever had.  I used sage pork sausage, 1/2 the amount of cheese the recipe called for and added 1/2 cup of milk and a 1/2 tablespoon of Tabasco sauce for a little bit of kick.  I had to cook them for 20 minutes to get them cooked all the way through, but they weren't a bit dry or greasy.  These couldn't have turned out better!

Very good - especially good once I mixed the ingredients with milk to make them stick together.  I added dry mustard which gave it a little kick which I thought it needed.  Everyone at work loved them.

This recipe was a smash hit.  I got real creative because I didn't have bisquik or anything so I used this sour cream biscuit recipe (http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Sour-Cream-Biscuits/Detail.aspx)
I mixed the ingredients of that just until it was crumbly in the bottom of the bowl and then I added the sausage, cheese, and I also spiced it up with some cayenne pepper and seasoning salt.  The balls formed very easily without having to use milk like a lot of others did.  Baked for about 30 minutes on a wire rack and they came out wonderful!! Next time I will double the recipe!

My sister-in-law gave the same recipe to me last year.  The only difference is that she cooks the sausage first and then mixes it with the rest of the ingredients.  I find that it only takes about 15 minutes to cook.  To roll the mixture into balls, you will need a little bit of water on your hands.  It's really easy and fun.  I usually make about 24 or so and then separate them into smaller servings to freeze.  My husband loves these for a quick easy breakfast!

An excellent addition to any Christmas Breakfast. This is a  prefect recipe but does, as has been mentioned previously,  need to bake a bit longer to get cooked all the way through.

This is an excellent recipie!  I make these every holiday seasons and always make numerous batches!  Ive found through trial and error, the best way is to experiment with the baking mix.  I never use the amount the recipie calls for.  I start with maybe half that and then work with it until Im happy.  Also we love cheese, so I generally add more cheese.  Also, if you like spicy, a few dashes(or more) of tabasco really seasons this up.  This is always a favorite around my house!

My kids really liked these.  It took some work to get the mix to incorporate...I kneaded the ingredients together by hand for what seemed like an hour :) but was really only about 10 minutes.  It was worth the effort, they weren't dry and crumbly. I served them with a honey mustard dipping sauce:  1/2 c dijon, 1/2 c honey, 1 1/2 tsp. oil and 1/2 tsp. lemon juice.

I gave these 4 stars because they were delicious!!  I made these for a party and they were the first things to dissappear.  I was asked several times for the recipe.

They did not get all 5 stars because they took 25-30 minutes to cook and not 10.   At 10 minutes they were not fully cooked in the middle, and I had to put them back in.

Wonderful! Just like my grandma used to make when I was a kid, and I love them as much now as I did then. I didn't think they were dry at all, they're meant to be more biscuit than sausage.

These were not the best sausage balls that I have ever made.  They were a bit dry, and not very flavorful.

only gave this a 4 b/c they were a little dry. will add a LITTLE milk next time. i took the suggestion of putting a cooling rack on a baking sheet to cut back on grease, but i didn't need to....there was none...and i used wal-mart sausage. different taste than i expected, but reminded me of sausage breakfast biscuits....very tasty dipped in syrup!!!

I thought it was a little too salty and cheesy.  I used sharp cheddar -- a milder blend might have been better.  Also, I baked the balls for 25-30 minutes.  Took them to a party, not a big hit but enjoyable.

I used turkey sausage and it turned out fine. I mixed them up the night before and then stored them in the fridge. This made the morning much easier. My sister loved them. However, I felt that they were a little bland. Next time I will either use a stuffing recipe or add spices to add more flavor.

These were a hit at my cocktail party.  I thought they were a bit bland and needed some sort of dipping sauce, but they were the first appetizer gone.  That means they were a crowd pleaser!  I will cut down on the cheese next time as it was a bit hard to mix.

These were ok. I cut back on the bisquick like others had suggested, and I only used a half a pound of cheese. The problem I ran into was the cheese melted and formed hard on the bottom. I am not sure why. At any rate, I think that all in all it is a fairly easy recipe, I just did not have as much success as I had hoped.

These went fast at a Christmas gathering we had.  I did jazz them up a bit by adding red pepper flakes.  It gave them just a bit of heat.  The tip about using the food processor to mix it all up worked great.  Otherwise it would be difficult to mix it by hand.

I didn't think these were very good but everyone else seemed to like them so maybe it was just me.  My dad used to make sausage balls all the time but his weren't quite so doughy.  Thanks anyway...I guess I will just have to keep looking for a recipe I like.

This is a great start to a traditional recipe, however I spice it up a little with hot sausage, finely chopped celery and finely chopped onion. I also add a little bit of garlic powder. You can substitute different chesses too!

We have made these for years at my house-- they do overcook easily and become kind of dry, so be sure to take them out just when when they brown.  If you want to freeze them, undercook them a bit, cool, and place in a ziplock bag.  Rewarm in the oven at serving time.  Frozen or refrigerated Sausage Balls warm well in the microwave too (just a few seconds or tehy will become overcooked).

This recipe simply cannot be easier or more versatile.  Try them with sage sausage, italian season and some mozz mixed with the cheddar, then serve them with spagetti.  GREAT as a breakfast food, I didn't find them dry at all.  Just work the ingredients in well.

We made these for something different for Christmas morning. They were a huge hit! Yes, they were a bit dry, but no one was complaining. Will probably become Christmas morning tradition at our house. It was nice to have them premade and just popped into the oven.

This recipie is awesome.  My mother-in-law makes these for us every Christmas morning when we visit her home.  They were Yummy.  So this year at my home, I made them for Christmas morning. Even my kids love them.  I think it was a little different from hers.  I think she adds more bisquick.  For those who think they are crumbly little balls, I think they are doing some thing wrong.  All the ingredients mix well and hold together, just have to get your hands into it. Will always be our Christmas morning tradition.

I have made this for years, butnever put onions in them.  The onions really add a nice flavor.  I thought the mixture was a good combination of ingredients and had no problem putting them together

What can you say about something as quick and easy as sausage balls?  That they're yummy and fun to make as well!  Being a novice in the kitchen, I frequently turn to quick menu items such as this. This is the second time I've made sausage balls from this recipe and love it's simplicity and you can reduce recipe or increase the portions right on the site so no math involved in the kitchen!  The only drawback to this meal is all the kneading and squishing you have to do to mix it. Kids would love it!  My prep time for the full recipe was 15 minutes and now they're in the oven - soon we will be enjoying a wonderful brunch of sausage balls and coffee!

I have used this recipe for years.  I just needed the temp.  But it is wonderful.  For those who had problems, the instructions say sausage.   You have to use raw so the 'drippings' bind it all together. I've never had problems with that.  My family changes up sausage and cheese combinations to make different varieties.  We make these for every holiday occasion and holiday parties.

My family has made this recipe for decades. Delicious! Keeping the same ingredient ratio, try using different combinations of mild, medium, and hot breakfast sausages and mild, medium, and sharp cheddar. Find the combination that fits your tastes.

I partially pre-fried the sausage with a little minced garlic & oil, butter.  I added some vegetable garden cream while the sausage was still warm.   I halved the Bisquick with bread crumbs.

I didn't precook the sausage too long so that it didn't turn out dry.

My family has made these for generations. You must use HOT pork sausage. I also use at least 2.5 cups of bisquick to get a really fluffy sausage ball. I add the cheese last after the bisquick and sausage are mixed.

May have overcooked them as they were very dry.  Brought to a family gathering and ended up bringing almost all of them back home.  That said, I used my stand mixer and bread hook to mix everything (pork sausage patties, my own grated cheddar cheese, and baking mix) and baked on parchment paper which made clean up a breeze.

did these for New Years Eve.   Happy 2020
I added fresh mushrooms and green onions.
I also used a package of regular sausage and
a package of hot sausage.
Everyone really enjoyed them.

These are fantastic and very easy to make.  The key is to set the sausage out and let it warm up a little bit.  Definitely grate your own cheese! Next time I think I'll add a little red pepper flakes for some spice.  I also added parsley just to make them look pretty.  I froze mine on a stone after shaping them then popped them into a freezer bag so all I have to do is throw them in the oven.  They make a great appetizer and not a bad breakfast either (if there's any left that is! )

A bit dry. Needs something to keep moisture. Otherwise they are ok. I did NOT precook the sausage. I do not understand why some people did . No where does it call for sausage to be precooked. Maybe I should try less biscuit mix next time.

These were just ok.  Probably a matter of personal taste but I wouldn't bother with them again.  If I did make again; I'd use parchment paper on the cookie sheet as they stuck quite badly, and add some additional spices as they were quite bland.  Not bad; just not worth the trouble.

I had to add a little soy sauce to get everything to mix together (it was a little dry).  I baked at 350 for 23 minutes and they were well done.  I used TN pride sausage and there was no grease.  Everyone like them.

I made this and they were great! Only 4 star because I would not use biscuit mix next time I make them. it doesn't need added fat or butter. cheese and sausage adds enough oils. I will make my own biscuit mix without any lard or butter. It isn't needed. Other than that it is a delicious recipe. Even my Mom liked them and she is extremely picky. It's a keeper for me! Thanks for posting.

5 stars! I made the recipe exactly as posted with no changes for Christmas breakfast and my family DEVOURED them. As many times as I've had sausage balls at work potlucks, this was surprisingly the first time I've made them myself. It won't be the last. We've got the start of a new Christmas tradition!

I accidentally bought 8 ounces instead of 16 ounces of cheese and I think I like it  better w/ less cheese.  It was a lot of work getting the Biscuit Mix mixed into the sausage, harder than I thought but worth it,  YUM!

These sausage cheese balls were excellent.  I have made several different recipes for sausage cheese balls and I believe that these were the best.  The proportions of sausage:cheese:biscuit mix is best with this recipe.  Other recipes call for too much biscuit mix and the balls have more of a bread taste.  The quality of cheese and sausage will also make a big difference.  In my experience either Jimmy Dean’s or Burgers Smokehouse Sausage make the best balls.

My reason for giving 4 stars is because I followed the recipe and read a lot of reviews and so I add the milk like one review said (Thank God I did). I didn’t add the poultry seasoning nor any other seasoning. I used Jimmy Dean’s original sausage. I also used my kitchen Aid mixer with the dough hook like another review mention (awesome tip). Baked them for 30 minutes walnut size like it said and they came out good. Only negative remark, they were flavorless, I should have added the seasoning if not the poultry then at least sal and pepper. I will make again only I will use the Jimmy Dean Sausage with Sage in it and salt and pepper..

I suppose you could add different things to this recipe but why mess with perfection? Three ingredients, super simple and tastes delicious! Since stumbling upon this recipe, I have made it more times than I can remember. The only thing I would take note of is that while they’re cooking they should be turned over once so the bottoms don’t burn or get too crispy. ?

Delicious! I’ve been making these for years. I saw somebody mention putting the balls on cookie cooling racks so I decided to try that this time. Oh my...I have the grid type of racks and you wouldn’t believe how much cheese is all over the rack. I had the thought...hmmm, maybe I’ll just throw these racks out and buy new ones. Lol! So..love them, but if you’re using grid racks...skip that recommendation!

These are a favorite & everyone likes mine, since not dry. Need 1/2 cup milk to mix & not be dry. I use parchment paper for quick cleanup. Also bake at 350° for 11-12 minutes. We're at 4500' elevation, so have to watch closely

i really like this recipe and my husband especially likes it. make sure you make a good ball. I found it hard to mix everything in a bowl so now I use my food processor with the plastic blade on pulse and it works great. I also shred my own cheese which i think makes it better.

Tastes great and easy to make!  I followed the tips from other reviewers - I mixed the sausage and Bisquick in my kitchen aid mixer with the diliugh book. After they were mixed pretty well I added hand grated sharp cheddar cheese. Next time I would let the sausage sit out for 15 minutes to mix easier. I put them on a cookie sheet line with aluminum foil and they stuck pretty badly. Next time I’ll use parchment paper like so many suggested.  I have plenty left over so I’m going to let them cool, put them in a cookie sheet and let them freeze for an hour before putting them in a freezer bag.  I will be making these again!

These turned out great! Now, cheese lovers, don’t shoot me but I used 1/2 lb. of cheese, just because I wanted more sausage flavor, no biggie! I did have to use just a tiny bit of water to get all the bisquick to mix-in but they turned out perfect! (It made 60 walnut size balls)

So easy! I didn’t have bisquick on hand, so I used 1 3/4 cup Kodiack high protein pancake waffle mix  with 1lb turkey breakfast sausage. Turned out great and were  just a teeny bit healthier.

They were tasty but a bit dry. I'd definitely add a splash of milk or an egg to it next time just to moisten it. However, my family requested these again for special occasion dinners like Thanksgiving and Christmas.

I've made these with precooked turkey kielbasa for holiday appetizers. I know that changes the flavor, quite a bit, but my family loved them. It was rather tedious cutting the kielbasa up so small. I usually served them with a ramekin of mustard.

I have made from scratch buttermilk biscuits for years, but had never tried to make sausage balls. I wasn’t sure what was meant by biscuit mix, dry mix or biscuit dough. So, I made my usual buttermilk biscuit dough (a la Deborah Madison). To my dough I added hot sausage, cheddar and feta. I find the flavor of feta comes through in biscuits better than most other cheeses. At any rate, the resulting sausage biscuits were close to addictive.

They came out perfect- I was full with 6 balls- very full

to make this fun I'd make some white gravy to go along with it, but I know sausage balls are a singular thing. Quick, easy to fix; especially for unexpected guests

I added my own touch some cajun seasoning, and basil(I know-weird) lol  Thanks for this recipe. I've tried others' before that were too bready

These were very tasty!  I used gluten-free baking mix because of a gluten sensitivity in the family, and they came out great.  I followed what some other reviewers said and mixed the baking mix and sausage together very thoroughly before adding the cheese, kneading it with my hands.  I have found that the balls don't stick together very easily, so I press the mixture into a 1/4 measuring cup and then turn it out onto the baking sheet.  They don't look as pretty, but it's way faster.  I have to make double-batches; these balls always disappear right away!

I doubled the recipe and did one hot and one regular sausage. I used turkey sausage and my sister was mad until she tasted them! My dad said it was the best sausage balls he’d ever had (and my sister makes them every year )!

Just made these! I’m 15 weeks prego and have been craving them. Made exactly as recipe says. I used buttermilk pancake mix, jimmy deans sausage, and Walmart brand shredded cheddar cheese. Baked for 25 mins. Not greasy, not gooey, just PERFECT!!! Dipping them in Canadian maple syrup. #foodie

So, this is a good basic recipe. I normally use the one on the box but this worked too. I use got breakfast Sausage. I think the Bisquick version has people adding cayenne...so the hot balances out I don't add cayenne. any flavor of sausage will work. True some are less greasy but there are some genious flavors in many sausages. The recipe was quick and easy to follow. Other than flavored sausage this is a great starter even for new cooks. I will add I put all of this in my workhorse Kitchen Aide mixer. I loath to make it by hand. it gets all under my finger nails for one
 heavy duty mixer solved this problem. This isn't something to eat often but  these are good. Honey mustard as a dip makes them Divine. 
Not sure what Italian Sausage will be good with but I have got marinara as well. I agree with others increase the cook time raw sausage is never our friend.

I substituted Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Flour for the biscuit mix. It was tasty but a little dry.

Very good.  Used several of the tips found in the reviews, and found them to be quite tasty.  Will use a milder cheese next time - it covered up the taste of the sausage.

A southern classic.  Easy to make .  I add a little  extra black pepper.  The better quality sausage and cheese, the better quality results.  Neeses’s extra hot sausage is the very best.

These are the way we like sausage balls... just the right ratio! I have made these many times with regular Bisquick and with gluten-free Bisquick which came out great too.

I made these for Christmas and they were a Big hit. No one could stop eating them. I added a 1/4 cup of milk to avoid the dryness and added a table spoon of Italian seasoning. They were great!

Really really dry.  Too much baking mix, I didn't try the recipe before I made it for Christmas breakfast.  I was so embarrassed to serve these dry dry  thick sausage balls.  Maybe use 1 cup baking mix...I'm not sure, but it doesn't work as presented.  Something is missing from the ingredients.  I even added a little water, because it's was so difficult to mix.

I added a couple tablespoons of milk because I was having difficulty getting the mix to come together.  After that it was much easier to form the balls.  I used hot sausage.  Also the "walnut" size seemed a bit large so I made mine  a little  smaller as I was taking  them to a Christmas  party as 'finger food '. Delicious and a great hit

It makes me so happy to find another person who makes these for Christmas morning! It's been a tradition in my family at least since I was a kid.

Does anyone else find that the pork is getting significantly leaner over the years, though? Has anyone added oil or fat back in to counter?

Hey gang...great ratios for cooking. I suggest you use a pound of uncooked sausage---a Jimmy Dean or some equivalent. Once you get a consistent blend and bake it, you're golden. Enjoy! It's an old southern staple

Mixture was a little dry the first time I made it. The second time, I added 1 egg, and it made it much easier to make balls.

These are delicious, and so simple!! I used jimmy dean sausage and Cabot “seriously sharp” cheddar. They seem dry when you’re mixing it together, but turn out wonderful. I didn’t have the grease problem some other reviewers have mentioned- I think it’s determined by the sausage you use.

So, this recipe is AWESOME as is so there is no need to try and modify it.  Great point noted at the end is to use "Block Cheese". It keep them moist and the taste is amazing! I used the 'Great Value" brand EXTRA SHARP cheddar from Wal-Mart. I am not a cook but I did learn a few things while preparing these.
1. Block cheese is the way to go but buy a good cheese grater because the act of shredding that much cheese can be laborious.
2. The mixture will be thick so you must have a fairly powerful mixer to mix the ingredients.
3. I doubled my batch but I would recommend making multiples of the single batch. (easier to mix)
4. Bisquick mix will be labeled "Pancake and Baking Mix". This is what you need. I thought there would be a 'Biscuit" mix.
5. When making the balls, make them small and do not place them too close to each other on the pan because they will grow in the oven.

Made it twice. First time as the directions said. They were tasty but had way too much cheese.  Second batch I used seasoned Italian ground turkey.  Cut the cheese in half.  Much better.
I found that both batches needed some kind of binder to keep the meatballs from falling apart.  They were good.  But not sure I'd make them again.

I just made these for a work party tomorrow. Made them exactly as called for. When mixing the ingredients and making the balls I was getting a little worried because there seemed to be a lot of cheese and not enough dough. However they are delicious right out of the oven! Not sure how they’ll be tomorrow cold but freshly cooked they are amazing. And I agree with another reviewer that anyone who is claiming these are dry is either way over cooking them or cooked the sausage in advance.

I've had this recipe for 40 years, and it's always good.  I double the recipe and use 1 lb. regular Tennessee Pride sausage and 1 lb. of hot which gives them a nice "kick" but not too hot.  I agree that using the KitchenAide mixer with the dough hook mixes everything to perfection.  They freeze well.

These are really yummy! I doubled the recipe & made the balls a bit bigger-about golf ball size & cooked them about 30 minutes at 350 (turning once). I followed the recipe exactly. I let them cool & then froze in a ziplock bag. Ready for the oven or microwave to warm up. Easy peasy! I will definitely be making more of these! The family loved them!

My first few batches were toasty brown on the bottom, so I started using parchment paper to line the sheet trays, turned down the oven to 315, raised the oven rack and turned all the sausage balls at 10 minutes.  They came out a uniform golden brown all over.

The sausage balls were delicious!  I did use mild cheddar and not sharp cheese.  still wonderful.  It is good to turn them over when cooking or you don't actually have balls when your done.

I changed half of the cheese to pepper jack, added a nice spicy flavor.  We love these for breakfast and family get togethers.

I mix these in my Kitchenaid n it’s so much easier than using your hands. I dump in the ingredients, set it to stir, and it only takes about 30 seconds. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly (no where does it say to pre-cook the sausage). They’re so yummy!! 

Oh one more tip: parchment paper!!

I did as others by mixing the baking mix with room temperature Jimmie Dean Hot sausage. Then added the cheese. I didn't have quite enough cheddar so I used some mozzarella. Great recipe. I've used the same one for 20 years and it always comes out wonderful.

We used to make these when I was growing up, loved them then & now! The only difference is we would place flour with cheese first so as to not have cheese balled up to itself.

This recipe turned out so good. I almost decided to cook the sausage first but so glad I did not. I used fresh sage sausage from our meat market and mixed everything in my kitchen aide mixer with the dough hook on low until everything was incorporated. Beautiful dough. I used a very small cookie ball to make them

These have been a staple in my house for a while, because my husband loves them!  I typically use regular biscuits cut up to get larger chunks of biscuits, which imo balances the sausage well. I also recommend using tin foil or a rimmed baking sheet to avoid sausage grease seeping into the stove.

I have made these for many years; however, I always cook the sausage and drain it on paper towels. I cannot tell you how much better these are eliminating all the grease.   Grate the large clumps so that it has the same consistency.  Mix the sausage with Biscuick first, then add cheese and one egg.  Add a tablespoon or so of milk.  The milk helps give them a crusty texture when cooked.  I bake at 375 degrees for approx. 18 minutes or until lightly browned.  I always serve with white gravy made from a package of Pioneer Peppered Gravy Mix.

These are great.  I have used this same recipe for over 20 years now.  Yes, please use uncooked sausage that has come close to room temp.  Also, remember that cheese puts off some grease as well, so either put them on a rack or pour any grease off before removing from pan.  I don't have sticking to rack, I use parchment paper there too and poke small holes through the paper that allows the grease to drain just like directly on the rack.  I use hot sausage and extra extra sharp cheddar.  Mine cook for usually at least 15 minutes.

Delicious! The tip about mixing the sausage and the mix first before adding cheese works very well. I add a dash of pepper and rosemary for seasoning. My girls love these!

Used kitchenaid mixer to blend. I think using hot sausage and extra sharp cheddar or there is not enough flavor. The cooking time depends on the size of your balls. If they come out doughy, they are not cooked enough. Next time I will bake at 350 for approximately  18 minutes. Serve with barbecue sauce.

These were good -something different. But the recipe calls for way too much bisquick. So  much so we couldn't get it all to combine so we left some out and they were still a bit doughy and dry. If I make these again I'll reduce the bisquick to half.

I made these as part of a Christmas brunch menu, and really wasn't impressed.  Despite mixing the ingredients for quite some time, I was never able to get all the ingredients to incorporate and hold together.  After they baked, the cheese burned a bit on the bottoms.  The taste was just okay, but I wouldn't make them again.

I halved the recipe as I had 8 ounces of sausage meat, I used 4 ounces each of Pepper Jack and Mozzarella shredded to use up cheeses I had, and I used the Homemade Baking Mix recipe from AR (scaled to 2 servings) as I did not have Bisquik. My #50 scoop made 24 balls that baked in 20 minutes at 425 degrees. My sons enjoyed them as a snack.

Like many, I've been making these for decades.  A couple of years ago I made a couple of minor changes that had a HUGE impact.  I add 2tsp onion powder & 1.5 tsp garlic powder - the difference in the taste is amazing.  So many people ask me why mine taste so much better than theirs & it's just these 2 little spices.  Also, if you live in an area of the southeast (I'm in East TN) and can buy Wampler's Sausage the grease it is minimal.  I use the Hot flavor.  I do shred my own extra sharp cheddar and that makes a difference, too.  And, like someone else on here recommended - if you have a stand mixer it makes the whole process WAY faster and easier.

I made half of the recipe without cheddar cheese since I’m dairy free. The sausage balls were delicious with and without cheese!

Taste definitely comes from the sausage, so use a strong flavor. We also used sharp cheddar and diced up apples for a tangy sweet flavor. Love these for holiday goodies though!!

I didn’t make any changes at all and they were perfect! I did take the advice of a more seasoned sausage. I read a lot of reviews that said they by passed cooking the sausage first. I did the exact recipe and did not cook the sausage first.  I’m not sure where they got the idea they needed to.

I have made these several times especially during holidays and always a big hit, however I have a friend who only uses 1/2 cup of biscuit baking mix so I decided to try being a little more conservative using 1 cup of biscuit baking mix and everyone loved it!  I use Neese’s Hot sausage or a freshly made sausage and if you’re trying to cut carbs and and bring out the flavor of the sausage and cheese with less dough I think you’ll like!

Have made a different sausage ball recipe to kick off the holiday season for years which uses more bisquick and less cheese....this one was even better! The key is to let the sausage sit out for about 20 minutes before mixing with the bisquick, using the dough hook attachment of the kitchen aid mixer. Then add a good quality sharp cheese which you shred yourself. Cooked for 17 minutes on parchment paper...easy clean up and perfectly cooked! My new go to recipe.

Love these!  So easy. Used the kitchen aide mixer with the dough attachment. Mixed sausage with bisquick first. Made sure it was all blended together well. Then added the cheese.  Baked on wire rack over a cookie sheet for 18 min at 375. Perfect!  Next time use hot sausage and sharp cheddar cheese.

Will definitely make again - I followed the recipe as written, and it turned out great. There are a lot of helpful suggestions in the reviews. I used the dough hook Kitchenaid mixer attachment to mix sausage (not cooked ahead of time and left out for 20 minutes) with the Bisquick, then added the cheese (also left out). I doubled the recipe (for a party), and baked 1/2 on a raised oven rack with a foil covered cookie sheet underneath to catch grease, and baked the other 1/2 on a parchment covered cookie sheet. I actually liked the way the ones that baked directly on the cookie sheet turned out better. They were a little more moist because of the grease. Both were good though. I plan to serve them warmed in a crock pot at the party - thanks to the person who suggested that! All in all this recipe is a keeper!

I had been looking in vain for this exact recipe that my friend gave me years ago. I knew I would find it on all recipes. Made this morning but halved the recipe as I didn't have enough cheese on hand.  They are just as I remembered.  Delish. Now I have to go to the store and get more cheese so I can make more or there won't be enough for the hubby . I can't stop eating them.

I didn't make any changes, but next time I'll use hot sausage.  There is so much cheese and biscuit mix, I don't think the hot sausage will seem hot at all.  The hardest part of this recipe is incorporating the cheese and biscuit mix into the sausage.  Be patient.

These were good, but I actually thought they had too much cheese.  Maybe I misunderstood the amount.  I used 2 8 oz. blocks of cheese and shredded it myself.  It oozed out and stuck to the parchment paper.  Next time, I will try using 1 8 oz. block.  Other than that, they had good flavor and were easy to make.

Love these! They are a staple in any Southern home. We always make them with spicy sausage and sometimes even add a little hot sauce (like Louisiana or Crystal) for an extra punch of flavor.

Taking some advice from other reviewers, this is what did. I added 1lb mild sausage to a one gallon storage bag with 1cup Pioneer biscuit mix and a dash of red pepper flakes. Kneaded until biscuit mix was not visible. I then added 8 oz of freshly grated extra sharp cheddar cheese about one cup at a time, kneading after each cup. I made 2" balls and baked on a wire rack on a foil covered cookie sheet at 350 degrees for 40'. Absolutely perfect and delicious! My husband loved them. Best sausage balls I've ever tasted! Thank you for the recipe and the reviews!

I am giving them four stars because everyone that I made them to loved them. I personally didn't like them but I feel that had nothing to do with the recipe.

This was extremely good. I did self shred the cheese and I used my kitchen aide mixer to mix it. It was the first time I've made sausage balls and they weren't dry. I will definitely make them again.

I absolutely love these. I like to make a large batch and freeze them to reheat on busy mornings.

These sausage balls are amazing. Most other recipes call for 3 cups of biscuit mix and come out very dry tasting. This one only calls for 2 cups and makes all the difference in the world. This recipe is absolutely the one to use!

This is just an "ok" meatball recipe (I made it as I had to use up the sausage), homemade meatballs from scratch in my opinion are much better......these taste a bit starchy/fake, won't make again.

Love this recipe. This was my first time making sausage balls, and they were a huge hit with my entire family. I listened to other's advice about mixing the sausage and the baking mix together first, then adding the cheese. That worked beautifully for me. I also baked them on a wire rack with a baking sheet underneath. I used a high quality sausage with very little fat. If I used a high quality sausage, I wouldn't fool with the wire rack again. It just made the sausage balls hard to get off as half the chesse in the ball melted around the rack. I had less then a Tbs of grease that ended up in the pan. If I used a more fatty sausage, I would definitely use the baking rack.

This was my first time making sausage balls. I found this to be a great simple recipe. I used Jimmy Dean mild sausage. The next time I make it I'm going to use a spicy sausage. Over all simple and easy.

made it as listed - i did use some of the tips I saw in reviews.  I let the sausage sit out a bit before mixing.  Added in the bisquick first, then added freshly shredded cheddar cheese.  I did find that 1 pound might have been a little overkill (I had lots of melted cheese that oozed out).  But would make again, and possibly reduce the amount of cheese a little

Great recipe.  Time saving tip:  Combine Biquick and sausage in stand mixer, using the dough hook, mix on low speed.  Once mixed, add cheese slowly and continue to mix until incorporated.  You can speed up mixer when adding cheese.  This method is great if you have arthritis in your hands like myself.

Loved it!!! Jimmy Dean hot sausage, Bisquick Mix & I used 8 oz Sharp Cheddar and 8 oz Colby Jack. They were juicy & flavorful. I made them the night before for a work event my husband and I ate a few that night and the next day the few of us on my team polished them all off. Big Hit!!! I only had to do 20 minutes in the oven 1st batch I made I did 25 and they were a little burnt but still good!!!!!

I followed some suggestions of others and cooked on a cookie rack over a cookie sheet (with sides).  Used mild sausage, so I added a some tabasco sauce for a little kick.  I saw in the reviews that some used 3 cups biscuit mix and some used 2.  I usually use 3, but cut back to 2 ½.  Using the dough hook was a great suggestion I read and I used a small cookie scoop to make them all similar sized.  We like ours crispy, so I cooked at 425 for 15 minutes.  Perfect.

These come out great. Blending is difficult. So haven't mastered that without a mess. I had someone make them once with spicy sausage and now  I do half and half (spicy and regular).  Also on parchment paper. I brought to potluck and heat in a crockpot next day. Never dry.  Love these

My mom has made these for 30 years but  with 2 cups of cheddar ( 8oz block then shred) and adding 1/4 cup milk or water is a must otherwise they are a little dry.

I added mustard powder and pepper - meat and cheese is salty enough! Very yummy! Perfect for a winter snack, party finger food, or breakfast at work.

Made exactly as it said. Even Though I slightly overlooked mine, it still tasted great! I lined one pan with parchment paper and the other with wax paper. Well that was a mistake. The wax paper melted into it so don't use wax! The parchment paper on the other hand worked perfectly. They came off so easily and easy cleanup!

This the same recipe my family has used for years. My boyfriend is from Texas and loves hot food. I use spicy sausage and wrap a jalapeno in the middle of each ball. Pat the pepper dry first or it will be to much moisture and they fall apart.

Following the recipes, the balls ended up a little dry. But the taste and texture was good, not too chewy. I tried both spicy and regular sausage but you couldn't tell the difference after they were cooked :P

I made no changes. The mix was dry and couldn't incorporate all the cheese for anything. There was definitely too much cheese. I had to throw at least 1/2 pound of it away. But they're good, and crunchy.

This very basic recipe is pretty straight forward. I do not add all of the biscuit mix up front as in making this recipe 3 x now with the same amount of ingredients I have found that the fat content of the meat can make you need more or less mix.  If your balls start to crumble a bit while making them, they will likely come out a little dry, which will also make them tougher.

I made some on parchment and some on aluminum foil. They both stuck, but tasted good. We took the advise of a reviewer and mixed the cheese in last. No powder appearance on ours :) One batch ended up making 40 meatballs for us.

Class Fav!  Made these for my daughter's "junk food day" at school and the kids loved it! I took some advice from the other reviews and added 1 tsp of black pepper and a splash of Worcestershire sauce. Cooked on parchment and they turned out beautifully.  Hint: I don't know who posted about using the dough hook on the kitchen aid but this was brilliant!  Mixing was super easy and no mess!  A win win!

I always add a little water if the biscuit mix still looks a little dry. Using a kitchenaid mixer makes it super easy to combine ingredients. These are so addictive.

I'm not a fan of spicey food, so I used mild sausage.  I think using something with a little kick would have been better... it would still fairly mild because of all the cheese and Bisquick added in.  I liked the consistency and they weren't bad.  But it was a lot of fat and calories for something that was just okay.

I made these for my best friend's birthday party and they were such a hit! It doubles easily. Everyone was raving over them and couldn't believe it was the first time I had ever made sausage balls. The hint on here about mixing the Bisquick into the sausage before adding cheese was great! I did that and had no white flour spots at all.

I remember my mother making these when I was a kid (40 years ago...:-)).  I have tried several times in my adulthood to make them and they never tasted as good as I remember my mother's did.  I stumbled across this recipe because I have a freezer full of fresh pork and was needing some recipes.  I followed the recipe exactly but used fresh pork (which I normally do not like). This recipe was great.  I do believe these are better than what I remember having as a child.

Guys, this is the easiest and most delicious recipe! I made a total of about 65 sausage balls and my husband devoured all of them. I changed nothing- ended up baking them for 24 minutes. Perfecto!

So easy and so good! I didn't use enough cheese in my first batch but luckily caught the error and added more before I rolled the second tray. 1 lb of cheese equal 2 8oz bags and it's definitely the right amount! I used hot turkey sausage instead of pork and added a bit of garlic salt and rosemary for extra flavor. Delicious and gone in a flash!

I made this at 2 in the morning for the local quidditch team. A little too much cheese, but they turned out absolutely amazing nonetheless. Would rate 6 stars if possible.

Cutting back on the Bisquik from 3 cups (original recipe) to 2 makes all the difference here, as you get a much moister, more flavorful finished product.

And I agree with Sunshine424 - I've never pre-cook the sausage.    You need that fat to hydrate the biscuit mix.

This was very easy to make. Next time I will use the zesty sausage to give it more flavor. I will also use less Bisquick.  A very easy way to make sausage for breakfast.

Grease pan because cheese oozes during baking and makes sausage balls stick.  This was very popular at our party.  I tripled the recipe and good thing!

These are good but I think they need a bit more baking mix so that they keep their shape and are not so greasy. Tried them again with an additional 2/3 C. baking mix and they turned out much better.

I followed the suggestions of some of the previous reviewers, and mixed the sausage with the biscuit mix before adding the cheese (which I hand grated).  The sausage balls mixed well with no powdery white appearance.  I liked the using the hand grated cheese as well.  I also used parchment paper to assist with clean up; this was another bonus.  I wasn't thrilled with the brand of sausage I used, and will try the recipe again with a different brand.    I was impressed, however, with how quick and easy it was to make.

Perfect as is!  

I made these to have the morning after Thanksgiving.  I made them ahead and refrigerated them until Friday.  I used freshly made breakfast sausage which was really lean, so I added an egg to help hold it all together.

We make these every Christmas too. I do add about 1 to 2 tablespoons milk to help the dough stick. Also, you have to mix and knead with your hands, a spoon just won't mix it well enough. You may need to increase baking time about 5 minutes if adding milk. Next time I'll try the suggestions of mixing the baking mix with the sausage before adding cheese. I'll also try finely shredded cheese. Those should help to mix better. I made 31 balls and I made them pretty big. They will stay good for the duration of a party, but you will want to refrigerate leftovers.

If you have a Whole Foods location near you and they make fresh sausage, I recommend using their Italian sausage.  I also recommend going a bit smaller than the size of a walnut for the rolled balls so that they brown a little better.

I use mild cheddar cheese. Sometimes after it's all mixed together, it can seem a little dry. I add just a couple of drops of water.

Just like I remembered them! I did make a minor change by adding some garlic salt, chili powder, and cayenne because we like a little more bite - and I had to add a little milk because my dough was too dry. It made about 36 good sized balls & they all disappeared quickly. So easy -thank you!

Im amazed at how good these were...they were not what I was expecting! Greasy, heavy dense etc.  I made my own Biscuit mix using the Homemade Biscuit Mix recipe from this website. My balls were the size of golf balls so I cooked them for 25 min. 10 min would have been enough for balls half the size of gold balls.

These were super delicious -- a big hit as a pre-Thanksgiving dinner nibbly.  I read the comments about this being hard to mix, so I tried this method which worked great.  I crumbled the raw sausage in a bowl and then added ONE cup of Bisquick and mixed well by hand; then I gradually added the other cup (about 1/4 cup at a time) mixing very well between additions; then I gradually added the shredded cheese.  They were easy to mix this way and went together perfectly.  I used Jimmy Dean Sage Sausage, 2 cups packaged shredded sharp cheddar, and 1-1/2 - 2 cups hand shredded cheddar with peppadews.  Great combination, but I will try using different varieties of sausage & cheese too!  Yummy!!

I have made this recipe a half dozen times and it is great as it is. However, my son and office like 'spicy' food, so I have altered it. I use hot sausage and double the recipe. I add 3 raw eggs to the mix. Messier product but adds moisture and flavor to finished product. I also add 1-2 heaping spoonfuls of diced jalapenos. For cheese, i like sharp cheddar and a spicy pepperjack package. My co-workers demanded this for our Thanksgiving party this year.

Great recipe and SO easy.  I'm wondering what a serving size consists of as I only saw 15 serving but not sure if it's one, two or three for the calorie count?

These are terrible!!! No flavor, greasy, and very dissatisfying. Don't waste good sausage, time or calories on this recipe.   Use your sausage to make biscuits and gravy or stuffed mushrooms instead! YUCK!

I was thoroughly disappointed in how difficult it is to keep them together. they tasted good, the only problem I had was them being too crumbly and very hard to put together. I have never had a problem like this before so I was baffled... maybe next time I'll add a little water or something to help hold these together

I made these more than once using turkey sausage. They come out great. I first mix the turkey sausage with the baking mix, then I add the cheese. I use my hands to get the ingredients mixed. The flavor of the recipe will depend on what brand of sausage is used.

For years my sausage balls cooked too brown before they were throughly baked. Since I started baking them on top of an inverted cookie sheet they brown perfectly every time.

These little bites of porky goodness are excellent.  Quick and easy to make and they hold well in a warmer so you can enjoy the party too.

I just tried this version of Sausage Balls today and LOVE it!  I have always thought sausage balls were a bit dry and now I know why.  Not pre-cooking the sausage is the secret.  I made the recipe as written except I used turkey sausage and I can't tell the difference.  I baked them for 20 minutes to make sure the sausage was cooked and they were great.  My husband loves them.  In fact, he said he could sit down and eat almost every one of them!!

Love these!  My recipe called for 3 cups bisquick, and 2 cups works much better. I'm putting this one in my recipe box!  Thank you for the tip to use my dough hook on my Kitchen Aide Mixer - fabulous.  Biggest problem is trying to get them in the container without eating too many :)!

For a simple quick dinner these are great with sausage gravy for a dipping sauce.  My DH did saw this made on a cooking show.  When I read the reviews there, many said the recipe was dry.  If you mix this in a stand mixer long enough it comes together like creaming butter & sugar.  A spicier sausage ups the flavor too!

I made these for a brunch meeting at work. I made them exactly as recipe stated. They had a good flavor but were really dry. Next time I will cut the baking mix in half and increase the amount of cheese. I probably will also add green onions for a little extra crunch and flavor.

I did not care for this recipe. I made them for a Superbowl party yesterday and was too embarrassed to bring them.  They were dry and I did bake the sausage raw, not precooked. What makes them dry is the Bisquick.

Very good! I doubled the recipe. I had about 2 1/2 lbs of homemade sausage. I used 2 bags of Bizquik Biscuit mix. About 2 1/2 cups. But that was too much.I wound up taking some out because I just couldn't see it needing that much. Maybe cutting back on it stopped them from being so dry?  My second batch I mixed in some cooked diced bacon! WOW is that ever good!
  The biscuit mix I took out I made sausage biscuits with that, Little bits of sausage in it. Pretty good also.

Love these!  Have been making these for years and always have requests from friends to make these.  I normally use Jimmy Dean ground sausage (comes in the 1lb tubes).  I always use half sage and half regular sausage ( just cut the 1 lb tubes in half and then freeze the other halves for next time).  The sage gives it a nice flavoring.  I find using only the plain sausage leaves them a little bland.  I never have issues with them being to greasy.  If you promptly remove from pan once done cooking and place them in a bowl lined in paper towels they are fine.  I do increase the cooking time to 15-20 minutes.

These are so addictive! I add about 1/4 cup more bisquick and kick the heat up to 400 degrees. We like a drier sausage ball and the increased crunch is great! Has been a favorite of mine for 30+ years!

These just didn't do it for me.  I mixed everything my mixer - so they were easy to form into balls.  But they just kind of tasted like dough balls when baked.  Maybe I overmixed or maybe the sausage wasn't the right kind, but I don't think I will make them again.

These were okay, but I think the sausage v Bisquick ratio is off. I followed the recipe to a T,  but the balls came out very "bready" and I didn't get the sausage flavor as much as I would have liked. And yes, I used quality sausage, not the cheap stuff. Next time, I'm using less Bisquick, maybe 1 and 1/4 cups.

This is a great recipe!  I've made it several times, but this time I took another's suggestion and used Pork Stove Top Stuffing instead of baking mix.  It was very good.  I think it did add more flavor.  Just used 2 cups dry, mixed with the sausage and then added the cheese.  Super!

I was so excited to try this recipe....I followed this recipe EXACTLY & cooked these wonderful little nugents for 25 minutes as many reviewers recommended to avoid any uncooked sausage in the middle. They came out somewhat overcooked (no I didn't pre-cook the sausage) & a little on the dry side. Also, each ball had a little briwn Frustration that was attached beneath - maybe from the sausage grease while cooking? They needed some sort of sauce so we ended up dunking in ranch. I was pleasantly surprised with the amount it yields....about 50 or so. In the future I think I will cook for a shorter time or @ a lower temperature....hey everyone's oven could vary. Thanks for sharing!""

These were really good.  Kinda too dense or something for my taste.  I'm only giving this recipe 4 stars because my husband pointed out that they smell like feet.  He also ate them and thought they were good, but I can't get past the feet thing now.

Fabulous! They were a little hard to mix together, so I think I'll use either the stand mixer or food processor next time! And there WILL be a next time! These freeze really well, and just need a quick reheating.

I just made these for the superbowl munch fest.  I did add a few teaspoons of water to the mix and worked with my stand alone mixer to make sure the ingredients were all incorporated.  I added dehydrated onions and a teaspoon of Tony Chakres to plain mild sausage.  DEELICIOUS!

I used hot sausage and sharp cheddar. We enjoyed the flavor but they are a little unappetizing to look at. Perhaps chilling first would help but they bake a little flat layer on the bottom that adds to the odd look and they are also pretty greasy(not surprising, I guess). They mix much better if the sausage is brought to room temp first. The leftovers seem very dry when cooled but reheating them seems to also "regrease" them. We ended up with about 90 of these even though I didn't feel I was too far off of walnut size. I would definitely halve it next time since I ended up with about two qt tupperware dishes full.

I made half the recipe used homemade biscuit mix and baked on parchment paper as some reviews recommended.  Very easy and tasty addition to breakfast this morning.  I am going to freeze the leftovers for future use.  Thanks for sharing, Stephanie

Excellent Recipe! I used some homemade Chicken Jalepeno Sausage I had on hand instead of Pork Sausage to raise the heat level somewhere just shy of a Nuclear Reaction. I use my own Bisquit making mix from scratch, other than that I followed the recipe ingredients to a T. I did put them on Parchment Paper and flipped them over 1/2 way through the cooking time. Good food for Entertaining. Highly recomended, thanks for sharing!

So yummy and so easy! I agree with several of the readers: premix the sausage and bisquick, and cook on parchment paper for at least 20 minutes, turning them after 10 minutes. Someone asked for dipping sauce ideas. I love s sweet/spicy barbecue sauce with it, but a tangy mango sauce is good too. I think I bought the mango sauce at either Trader Joes or Fresh n Easy. This is now requested by friends when we have potlucks!

A perfect staple for holiday parties...everyone loves them! I add a little dried mustard and some red pepper flakes to the Bisquick. I break in the raw sausage (after letting the sausage sit out for about 20-25 minutes). The last thing I do is hand-shred the cheddar and mix it in thoroughly. I cover the mixture and refrigerate about an hour to let the flavors blend and the fat from the sausage and cheese moisten up the mix. I bake about 20 minutes at 350 on parchment paper and SOOOO yummy!

These are soooo delicious! Perfect for breakfast on the go. Just freeze them after you make them and then you can just pop them in the microwave and have delicious, yummy sausage balls! I've also found that adding scallions to them adds a wonderful flavor

I used Italian turkey sausage because a couple guests have issues with pork.  Did add a little milk to help bind them. There were delicious!  Ended up printing out the recipe for the guests to take home.  Will continue making these.

I used 1/2 pound regular and 1/2 pound hot sausage.  I also added a little water to make it easier to mix.

These are great!  Don't over cook! hahaha You will have meat rocks!  A little salty too, so I would use ground sausage with nothing added.

This wonderful recipe is my go-to for Southern pot lucks and events.  I use the recipe exactly as written but I always hand grate my cheese using a microplane grater.  This results in a very soft mound of cheese which is pretty easy to mix by hand with the sausage and Bisquick and may be the secret to keeping the sausage balls moist. I bake on a parchment sheet for 15 to 20 minutes or until just golden brown.  I then drain them for a few seconds on a paper towel before serving.  They are always gobbled up to the last bite.

Fabulous - Made them gluten free the first time using Bob's Red Mill Pancake Mix. We were all very impressed. We made them again tonight with Bisquick and are even happier. We had a bunch of the gluten free ones left over, froze them and just reheated them for our one gluten free boy. We actually had these tonight with our spaghetti in place of meatballs! Yum!

These met with rave reviews at the neighborhood Christmas party and will make a return appearance in a local kitchen soon!!!  I followed the advice about using the disposable kitchen gloves to knead the mixture well.  I baked them on parchment paper as indicated and allowed them to cool for a good 5-10 minutes before moving to a serving tray.  While they may not be the most nutritious of snacks, they certainly are delicious!  Thank you for sharing this yummy deliciousness.

These are good and I followed all of the instructions but they still had a bit of a powder look to them.  Still, they tasted good and people liked them at the party.  I made a double back and I had 2 left at the end of the night.

I made these for a Christmas party, and they were a huge hit! My mother in law doesn't even like sausage and she loved these. Bonus, we reheated the leftovers in the morning and enjoyed them with our breakfast!

These disappeared at our work breakfast function.  They were simple to make even though I had to make a from-scratch substitution for bisquick since I didn't have any.  Can't wait to make them again!

Served as an appetizer at Christmas with mixed results.  The younger guests like them the most.  My hubby said they were so-so. Might be better for breakfast.

Love these!  We add Frank's Red Hot sauce to spice them up a bit.  It also helps them bind together well.  They work out best when you flip them halfway!

These are really good, my only issue was that 4 cups was too much cheese. I didn't think it was a taste issue but an incorporation issue. I combine these as if I'm making a meatball mixture and the 4 cups of cheese just didn't incorporate well. I would probably use 3 1/2 cups the next time.

These turned out perfect!  Definitely need to mix the sausage and Bisquick BEFORE adding the cheese.  Cooked on wire rack in oven per the suggestions for 20-25 minutes and they turned out perfect. Great appetizer to take to Christmas Eve with the in-laws.

I add another 1 cup of baking mix and then some red pepper flakes and garlic powder for a little more kick.  For a healthier version, try ground turkey breakfast sausage.

Bland as written.  Added a few spices and STILL wasn't enough.  Wasn't going to make them again UNTIL I read reviewer's suggestion of using Stove Top Stuffing Mix instead of baking mix!  Has GOT to be much better.  I'll give that a try, for sure!

I was very disappointed because I followed what it said at the top of the recipe about 20 mins for cook time and only saw the 10 mins at the end.  They came out kind of dry, good but dry.  I will definitely make these again but use the time shown in the instructions.

Not crazy about this recipe... I tried 2 variations... I used the Bob Evans saus, sharp cheddar and bisquick, they were pretty bland. The only reason I even gave 3 stars was because I tried another batch with hot sausage and longhorn cheese and it was a little better. Probably wont make this again. Took to a brunch there were quite a few left.

I've been trying to figure out if this should be 3 or 4 stars. This did not really go over well in my house. Ours seemed to taste too much like biscuit mix. We were all expecting these to taste more like meatballs. I think this could have used more flavoring. Perhaps using a flavored sausage like maple or sage would have made this significantly better. My teenager ate most of these. My little ones only ate one each and my husband ate one and then asked me "What's for Dinner?" (His nice way of saying he wanted me to cook something else...)

I planned to make these exactly as called for, but was down about 1/4 cup baking mix. I've never had sausage balls before, but these were tasty! I baked them on the rack for about 23 minutes, and they are perfect - a little more browned on the bottom than some might like. Crunchy!

This is a good recipe..it's the same as the one my Aunt has used for years. I used 8 oz sharp cheddar cheese and as another review recommended I lined the cookie sheet with parchment paper(it worked great and has little mess to clean up). I rolled them into medium sized balls and cooked them for 25 minutes, turned them and cooked for another 10 minutes..and didn't pay attention so I think I cooked them a little longer than that. They came out a little more brown and crunchy on the outside than I liked, but the middle was moist. I put them in a plastic bowl and loosely covered it with the lid while they cooled and it helped the flavors mingle. I will use this recipe more but next time pay more attention to the time.

I had to make these for my son's Christmas party. It was the last thing to sign up for on the list. But, they turned out great! The kids and parents really loved them! I modified it a bit . I used 1 lb of Jimmy Dean mild sausage (I used regular at home when I was not serving kids or strangers. I was worried about the spice factor) 2 cups of Bisquick, and 10 oz of shredded cheddar cheese. With that ratio it is easy to double or triple with easy. I made them at Christmas and bought a pretty plate and gave them to my neighbors for Christmas breakfast.  It was a hit and a great gift for not a lot of money. (I bought cute but cheap plates at TJ Maxx- or Dollar Tree.) And divided the recipe between several people.

I made this for our New Year's Eve party and my husband almost ate them all before the guests arrived! The only difference is that I added just a smidgeon of water to get everything to "stick", then cooked them for 23 minutes and they were wonderful!  I will definitely make these again.

My husband loved these,  I didn't try them because I don't eat meat.  He said these were the best.  I did mix the cheese with the sausage after leaving the sausage out of the refridg, for about 40 min. Then added the biscuit mix.

cooked at 350 for 30 minutes.  mixed the sausage and biscuit mix first, then folded in the sharp grated cheddar cheese.  baked on parchment paper and didn't experience any grease.  would be good with a couple of chopped fresh jalapenos added to the mix.

Great classic sausage ball recipe!  And just a FYI, ground pork and sausage are 2 different things, so the reviewer that gave a low star review and used the wrong ingredient shouldn't have rated this recipe 'cause this is NOT what she made.

Tastes better if you cut the cheese down to 8 oz instead of 16 oz..  Will take a bit longer to cook, but better sausage flavor and consistency.  I also prefer to use Bob Evans Maple 
Sausage.

Not a favourite. Maybe because I used ground pork instead of sausage? I did season it though with Italian seasoning, salt, pepper and extra parsley. Didn't have cheddar so I used mozzarella. It was kind of bland, but I could imagine this may be better with sausage. Just needed something to make in a pinch, and this is what came up in my ingredient search. Won't make again.

They turned out alright for my first try.  It was important to me to make sausage balls this year because my favorite grandmother used to make them every year around the holidays.  She passed away in May, and I really wanted to get this right.  Seems like it should be a simple enough recipe, but you definitely need to cook them a lot longer than ten minutes.  I'd aim for 25 minutes to 35, depending on your oven.  All in all, very tasty, though.

Per other reviews, I let the sausage come to room temp, then mixed with bisquick and added the cheese last.  You can't go wrong with sausage balls!

I have made these for several years same recipe. I use 1 hot sausage and 1 mild ( i double my batch) it mixes really well if you let your sausage & cheese set out for several minutes to knock the chill off. My family and Bunko group love these!!

These were great! They were a perfect crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. I added a 1/4 cup of finely chopped onions, otherwise I changed nothing. This recipe will be added to my recipe drawer, thank you so much!

This is a fairly similar recipe to the one my mother always made for parties and get togethers but she always added onions and green peppers to hers. She would cut one medium onion and at least one large bell pepper (use red, yellow, or orange for sweeter flavor than the green) and sauteed them together in a skillet with a Tblsp of butter. She added this to the recipe above. ITS DELICIOUS!

I have never made these before and was confused because some people say do this and some do that so I wasn't sure if I should follow directions or not. I did and they did not turn out good at all. I trid again following other reviews and they turned out better but I will keep trying to get it right.

They were very good. I used a white cheese, since I didn't have any cheddar, and used raw bratwurst. I just took the casings off about five brats and mixed them with the cheese and bisquick. I too baked them on a cooling rack on top of a cookie sheet. That way all the extra fat could drip off, and you didn't get a hard flat bottom. I baked mine at 350 for 25 min. I would make them again.

Tender and delicious. My family's favorite. I like to bake these at 15 minutes to ensure complete cooking throughout. Enjoy!

Everyone loves sausage balls... and they are so easy! I agree with other reviews that you should mix the sausage and baking mix together and then add the cheese. Be sure to use your favorite sausage! Fabulously easy!

Very good.  I will probably decrease the amount of Bisquick next time though.  It was a bit floury for my taste.  But still very good.

Best I have ever eaten!  The sausage balls I have had before were always dry dry dry, and these are delicious.  I doubled the amount and mixed Jimmie Dean Extreme hot sausage and regular sausage so it gave them a nice light 'heat'.... also decreased the biscuit mix by 1/2 cup and it's perfect. Be sure to cook them for 20 minutes (the directions inside the  recipe say 10, but are a misprint.) Serve with dijon mustard.  I will be proud to put these out for my mom's 90th birthday open house!

I've made these for years and years. This recipe calls for more cheese than the one I've traditionally made, and of course it's better (more cheese = better). I also added a few generous dashes of worcestershire sauce - delicious!

These are so good. We are *spicy* people so I used spicy sausage. They were delicious. I wonder how it would be if I used "Lightening Jack" cheese? YUM. Next time.

These were pretty good, but you have to select a lower fat susage and use the full amount of biscuit mix or else you will get some grease on the bottom of the pan (Jimmy Dean works well).  I also suggest using spicy sausage for more flavor.

These are even really good frozen and reheated.

Thanks!

I have to admit that i was a little disappointed with these after reading all the great reviews. The flavor was good but the texture was kind of mushy from the baking mix and the presentation wasn't good as all the cheese made a mess as it melted. I agree with the reviewer who said they are better cold the next day.

I love to put these out at family get togethers.  They go fast.  I add 1/2c minced onion and 1/4 tsp garlic powder.  It adds moisture and extra flavor.

These were really good. Next time I'll make them a little smaller. In my oven I did have to turn to cook more evenly on both sides. Made a simple honey mustard dip which really enhanced this snack. Very easy too--will make for Christmas too.

I had NEVER made sausage balls. This had a great review, so I wanted to try it. I thought they were amazing. I made them for work and everyone had a fit. I did look at other reviews and took the advice of mixing the sausage and biscuit mix first. The recipe wasn't clear at all about wether the sausage should be cooked or not, but i figured it out by reading reviews (it is meant to be raw by the way). I think next time I will try a little less cheese. I also had to turn the temp down and raise my rack so the bottom would not get too hard. Ummm

Easy! Easy! Easy!  Baked these at 350 for 15 minutes and they're perfect.  Using hot sausage in this recipe makes the balls just under "medium" (on a wings scale) hot.  Add a tbs of cayenne for "hot."  Guys absolutely love these.  I baked them on parchment in a cookie pan an then drained on paper towels.  Definitely knead the bisquik with sausage first, then add shredded cheese.  Not a high-brow app, but sinfully good.

After reading a lot of the reviews, I was excited to make this recipe. I have to admit that I was disappointed. Maybe my hopes were to high...I don't know. My sausage balls were cake like if you can imagine and rather dry. Wont be making these again.

i so wanted to like these...but i thought they were too doughy and dry.  i added milk and that helped, perhaps my sausage could have been spicer, and i could've use less bisquick...just too many what-ifs for me to try again...sorry!

I was very disappointed in this recipe.

It was bland and blah.  I even added the spicy sausage and a bit of garlic powder to the baking mix.  But these tasted like balls of sausage-flavored bread, nothing exciting.

I will not be making these again.

I would have given this a 5 star, but recipe as it is bland.  I added some chopped onions & celery.  Also used garlic powder and spicy sausage.  They turned out great!  Will make again

I've been making sausage balls for years - since I was a little girl!  The only difference between my recipe and this one is that I use 3 cups of bisquick.  I believe the extra cup makes the sausage balls seem a little less greasy, although while they are baking lots of greasy bubbles out of them, there's no avoiding that.  They are so good!  A definite Christmas tradition in my family!

Dry and Bland

Add spice, add cheese, leave out some of the mix! I give it a three because nothing with cheese can be all bad, right?

These came out good, even with no-fat baking mix.  I used Owens hot sausage and baked for 25 min. on a roasting rack.  I stored in an airtight container to redistribute moisture as one reviewer suggested and that worked well.  These are not too greasy at all and I would certainly serve these for guests at a party.

The only thing I do different is cook the sausage on the stove first then add it to the mixture of cheese and baking mix.

Dry!  I used a ham sausage that didn't have a lot of fat, so maybe that was my mistake. This is not the recipe I expected.  A co-worker makes a similar one that looks more like a biscuit with sausage & cheese added.  This recipe is not look very pretty at all.  I'm glad I made it a few days in advance so I have time to find another recipe.

I made these this past weekend, and Love sausage balls! I took the advice of others and put them on a baking rack on top of baking sheet. worked great! I also found that if you are using your food processor to mix these you can use less cheese as it gets chopped into small pieces even further! Also cooked on 25 minutes, but made them a little dry so I will cut back the cooking time when I make these tomorrow for a work party! Happy Holidays

These were great!! I cooked them on a rack until lightly browned. They weren't greasy at all. We did feel that it would be nice to have a sauce with them, though they are tasty on their own. Any ideas??? I made the recipe for "piquant meatballs" (from this site) at the same time and borrowed some sauce from those, which turned out to be a pretty good match!! Thanks!

Wonderful recipe, and thanks to other reviewers also for the helpful suggestions of adding a bit of milk and cooking these on a wire rack over a cookie sheet. I hope I can stop eating them and save them for the party.

I tried this again today, as this has always been the basic recipe I have used for my sausage balls. They are delicious and like another reviewer suggested, it is good to play around with the baking mix a bit using just the amount you want. A little cayenne kicks it up just a notch. Thanks!

Every time I make these (about 3 times a year), I have to add a bit of water to the mix so it sticks together.

Yummy stuff, though!

THESE WERE THE BEST SAUSAGE BALLS IVE EVER HAD!  I FOLLOWED OTHERS MEMBERS BY ADDING MILK 1 CUP AND BAKED THEM ON A WIRE RACK SITTING ON A COOKIE SHEET.  IN THE PAST THEY HAVE ALWAYS BURNT, NOT THIS TIME, THEY WERE PERFECT- MOIST INSIDE/JUST RIGHT ON THE OUTSIDE.  I MADE A DOUBLE BATCH FOR A HALLOWEEN PARTY AND THEY WERE COMPLETELY GONE AND HAD LOTS OF REQUESTS FOR THE RECIPE.

The best and most simple recipe for sausage balls ever!  Use the hottest sausage you can find and blend well (it takes a while).  I didn't change a single thing.  Everyone loved them!

these were pretty good, but not my favorite.  of course, it may have had something to do with the fact that my husband bought italian flavored sausage instead of the regular.  i'll probably try them again and see how they turn out.

This was an easy recipe to make.  I added around 2-3 Tablespoons of milk to help it all to hold together, and I drained them on paper towels after to allow some of the grease to be absorbed.  They were delicious!

Fantastic!  I wanted to make sausage balls but had no idea how to even start.  I changed up the recipe some: 1 1/2 cups of Bisquick instead of 2.  I used mild cheddar instead of sharp, and I only used 1/2 pound.  Any more than that and they would have been way too greasy.  They turned out great.  I am sure I will make some more modifications to get it perfect, and perhaps try some spicy sausage next time.  Overall, great recipe!

I think I just didn't get anything out of this recipe beyond the taste of Bisquick, Sausage and Cheese, three things I love but after trying this recipe, I've decided they don't belong together. Not my thing at all and I really do love the ingredients separately. Sorry.

ok but a little dry, will use about 1/2 the bisquick mix and about 1/2 the cheese. try adding a little chopped garlic or onion for flavor.

Yum! I made with mild deer sausage and the cheese biscuit mix, cut down on the cheese to half a pack of Kraft shredded, and they turned out great!! I drained the grease and sat them on a paper towel to soak the excess and found that they were light and airy as a result. Great, simple recipe!!

I followed the recipe but my sausage balls were not very good.  The sausage was not fully cooked and the Bisquick didn't add any texture to them.  Perhaps I made them too large and they were not able to cook.  I ended up baking them about 20 minutes and they didn't get any better.  I thought there would be more of a breading with the sausage and cheese but it was more like a cluster or raw sausage.  I will try them  again (but making them smaller) since so many people enjoy them.

Good recipe. I used half the amount of cheese as that's all I had. Cooked perfectly. Patience is required in the mixing process but it works out well. Thank you. Cook only twenty minutes total.
