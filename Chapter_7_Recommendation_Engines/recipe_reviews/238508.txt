The taste of there are just fine but 300 for 4 + hours left them a bit to dry for us.  They were falling off the bone but the meaty edges were like jerky.  I have used this method before but cooked at 250 - 275 with better results.

I'm not sure I have the right to rate this, because I cheated madly.  Don't usually do that with Chef John's recipes, because they are so good made exactly as stated.  However - didn't have time, had ribs, so I took the ingredients and threw the lot in the slow cooker on low for 7 hours.  I cut the pineapple juice a bit, used sriracha instead of chili paste, but left everything else pretty much as is.  I did flip the ribs a few times.  It was delicious regardless!  Next time I will try doing it according to the recipe.

Very nicely done! I doubled the basting sauce because I like them extra flavourful, but if I was making 5his again as a main dish meat, I would cut it back to the regular amount of sauce. As an appetizer I would double the sauce and probably cute the ribs into singles after the first 1 1/2 or so, but that does not take anything away from the recipe. Have always liked Chef John’s recipes and this is no exception.

the ribs came out pretty well but what I would do next time is use a little less hoisin sauce and would probably leave it in the oven for no more than 2 hours at the 300 degrees that was recommended but would definitely try it again

After 1.5 hours in ven I reduced temp to 275  Checking them 15 min later, to baste again,  i decided they were getting overcooked.  I turned oven off, nd removed ribs 5 min later.  Alas, even the thicker chunks were dried and over cooked.  I cant imagine using the times prescribed and not having overdone meat.  Something is wrng here.  And, afyer all the fussing with this recipe, Im v disappointed.  We couldnt really eat much of it, simply too dries/over cooked.

Very much liked them.  I used a slightly different rub variation with more 5 spice,    but this a fun and different way to serve Ribs.   I have  a few other rib styles I prefer,  but I did like these,  I will do them again.      Never thought to marinate ribs by cutting into half racks and using a zip lock.   good tip!

Waay too much salt.
Next time I'll start with  1 teaspoon salt and more brown sugar.

Needs a little sweet, I added some dark corn syrup to the basting.  I'll try honey next time.

This stuff is addictive.  Made as written one time, then two more times adding whatever I have around.  If I can't fail at this, no one can.

I used baby back ribs by mistake, so I cut the temp down to 260°F, but everything else was on point on the recipe. I will use less salt in the rub next time, the fish sauce, hoison and soy sauce has enough salt as is.
