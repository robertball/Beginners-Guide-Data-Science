Love this recipe! The marinade made the chicken very moist and tender. I didn't have the egg substitute so I did not add any, however the finished results was still wonderful.

Al, this recipe is awesome! I used a real egg, but that was the only change. To other users, don't leave out the egg - it acts as an emulsifier, so your marinade doesn't separate overnight.

We loved this chicken with its tangy flavour.  Easy and tasty.  The one problem, as others noted, was that it was way too salty.  Next time I will make it with 1 teaspoon instead of 1 tablespoon of salt.  I wish I read the reviews first.  I might also try to cut back on the oil as well just to cut the fat and the near fire in the bbq. Otherwise really good.

EXCELLENT recipe... the combination of simple spices is very complimentary to chicken, and it keeps the meat moist. Seems like my chicken tends to get dry on the grill, but not this time! I marinated for almost 24 hours & it was great.

Great recipe!  I must admit I didn't follow it to the letter though.  We were too hungry to wait so I didn't bother to marinate the chicken, instead I cooked it in a 475 degree oven for around 30-40 minutes.  I used Sherry Wine vinegar instead of apple cider and didn't use the egg substitute either (I'm not sure why you would anyway). I used boneless skinless thighs and they were so tender and tasty.  I wish I would have made a bigger batch for leftovers!!

I love this recipe. It's my husband's favorite chicken recipe. I do make some changes, however. 1) I always use 1 egg instead of the egg substitute. I believe the egg is absolutely necessary to make the marinade "stick" to the chicken. 2) I use chicken thighs WITH the skin on. When I pan fry these, the skin creates a flavorful crust that is keeps the meat even more most than normal and 3) I agree with the others that 1 TBS of salt is a bit much so I cut it down to 1/2 TBS. This also freezes beautifully. If you can, marinate this overnight. I have made this at varying "marination" times. The flavor is 100% more pleasing when it's marinated overnight. Oh, and these freeze beautifully!  Thank you Al!

This recipies had a nice flavor and I will make it again, but it was WAAAAY too salty.  I actually thought I added too much salt by mistake, but then I looked again and it calls for a tablespoon of salt, I will at least cut that in half if not skip it altogether next time.  But my husband and I both agreed that I should try it again, with less salt.

This was the best chicken marinade I have ever eaten! My husband and I loved it. The chicken was juicy and had a nice color to it. 
We will definately be making this again.

This was very good. I didn't use the egg substitute because I didn't have any. We used boneless breasts cut into strips for kebabs on the grill but I think the thighs would be good too. Maybe next time.

I have been using this recipe since I first found it about 1 yr ago.I marinade chicken drumsticks(10 to 15)bone in, over night then I pop the whole thing in the oven (about 1 1/2hrs)to cook and just before it's done,I sprinkle seasoning salt on and Bbq to finish.It is so tender and tastes fantastic.

We really enjoyed this.  Found this while looking for a easy recipe using what I had on hand for a last minute BBQ with my young nieces.  They loved it!  Used strips of chicken breast, didn't use egg substitute, only used 1 teaspoon salt - I think the 1 Tablespoon salt might be a typo.  Only marinated a few hours cuz that's all I had time for.

A-MAZ-ZING!!!  This tastes JUST LIKE the Bertucci's Tuscan Wings.  I even asked a waiter at Bertucci's for their marinade recipe years ago, tried it at home and nope, that was not it.  But Big Al's Chicken is EXACTLY it and it's completely different from what the Bertucci's waiter gave me.  Obviously theirs was a closely guarded secret, but no more!  Big Al got it right.  This is a new favorite grilled chicken recipe, and I'm going to try it on wings next.  Did not change a thing and only marinated it for 2 hours.  Can't imagine how fantastic this must be after marinating for 8 hours.  Thanks Al!

This chicken recipe was just perfect. I'm glad I read the reviews about 1tsp of salt instead of 1tbsp because it was delicious with 1tsp. I marinaded for about 18 hours then grilled the thighs for about twenty minutes, minding the fire all the time, because it really was flaring up with the oil. I make mustard potato salad, corn on the cob ranch style beans and venison sausage along with the chicken on Easter Sunday and everything was deeeelish!

Very good! I used 1 tsp of salt, based on other reviews.  Doubled the recipe for 10 chicken thighs, but I don't really think I needed to. Nice and juicy, even with 15 minutes extra grilling time (20 minutes didn't seem like enough time, so hubby used a meat thermometer and it took him 15 extra minuted to get chicken to well done stage). Guests enjoyed it!

This was a VERY mild tasting marinade. I did decrease the salt, couldn't find my garlic powder so I used fresh, and used smoked paprika. It was good on the thighs but just not "bursting" (it could possibly be our taste buds are burnt out, IDK) with flavor. I would use it again when I want something thats not heavily seasoned for when we have company and such. Oh and FYI, this stuff is EXPLOSIVE on the grill. I used an entire spray bottle of water keeping down the flare ups so watch it closely because burnt chicken is NOT good eats.

Delicious recipe! Two changes though: I used a teaspoon of salt instead of a tablespoon. Also, the recipe suggests using reserved marinade to flavor the cooked chicken - this is something I wouldn't suggest due to it containing raw eggs.

This is an awesome marinade. I didn't have any egg substitute so I skipped that part. Otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. I used chicken breasts instead of thighs and marinated overnight. I couldn't believe how moist the chicken was. I've tried other marinades from this site and while they have good flavor the chicken tends to get dried out.  This recipe gives both great flavor and keeps the meat moist while cooking. Thanks for the great recipe Al. It's a winner!!!!!!!

This is an excellent marinade for grilled chicken!  I use olive oil, an actual beaten egg, and boneless chicken breasts, along with the other ingredients,thrown them in a plastic bag, and marinate overnight,  The chicken is so moist and flavorful!  The cider vinegar gives it a real tang.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!

Good taste but way too salty for us.  If I make again, I would definetly have to cut the salt intake down.

I followed the recipe exactly and marinated the chicken for eight hours.  Only difference was I added salt per my family's preference (maybe 1/2 Tbsp.) and broiled the chicken in the oven.  The chicken was very tender, but I prefer highly flavorful food and found this chicken very bland.  One son liked it a lot, and the rest of the family thought it was average.

I am really, really surprised by the high ratings for this marinade. I used the ingredients list faithfully (which I don't always do - I did use an egg instead of the egg substitute however) and found the resulting dish extraordinarily greasy. Yikes! I am not someone who normally minds grease, but this was outrageously greasy because of all of that oil. Otherwise, the flavor was fine - a little bland, but fine. I am going to try this again, but this time only using a 1/4 cup of oil. Hopefully it'll be better.
I found this recipe, btw, because I am on the low-carb diet, and I do have to say that at least it is low-carb, which is a bonus. Many marinades are stuffed with sugar and honey, and this marinade does not have that, which I appreciated. Hence me being willing to try this again. :)

I used a real egg, followed exactly otherwise.  Made in the oven broiler as the BBQ is snowed under.  To be honest the recipe smelled very unappetizing while cooking and even after it was done, but it tasted very good!  I'll make it again when I can use the BBQ.

This was pretty good. I eliminated the egg and next time I will half the poultry seasoning. Very good taste, not vinegary at all. I believe I overcooked the chicken, next time I will be more careful so it will be more moist.

I only had time to marinade for about 3 or 4 hours and it was still tender and delicious.  No leftovers!

Great marinade!!  I used this recipe at increased measurements for ingredients to feed more than 100 people. Everyone commented on how delicious and juicy the chicken was.  I used all the ingredients listed plus I added Lea & Perrins worstershire sauce and  Johnny Crackers creole seasoning mix as well.

Very good, I would moisten the chicken a little bit more the day ahead by soaking it in buttermilk.

I would have given this five stars but my husband wasn't too into it so I'm putting a family consensus. I followed the recipe using a real egg instead of substitute. I thought it was so delicious and I absolutely loved it - very nice flavor and good, juicy chicken. We are going to make it again on the 4th with chicken breasts - maybe my husband will like it better with white meat. Thanks for a great recipe.

wow is this good!  i made it with thighs one night then with chicken tenders a few nights later - equally as tender and flavorful.  make sure you note though:  when you baste at the end with the dressing, you're using a raw egg - hence, i skipped this last step!

My one and only piece of advice for this recipe is to make PLENTY for leftovers. We pulled the skin off some legs and made those, too. We also cooked our on a charcoal grill which gave it that nice "smoked" taste. It was  DELICIOUS! It's the BEST grilled chicken ever! Thank you, AL, for the only grilled chicken recipe I will ever use!

THANK YOU BIG AL!  This is a fabulous, tangy marinade.  I made the recipe exactly as specified, except I doubled it to accomodate 6 large skinless, boneless breast halves in addition to the thighs, since I was feeding a crowd.  I marinated the chicken for a little over 24 hours and it got RAVES after I served it.  The marinade does flame on the grill, but anything with oil will do that.  It was not a problem.  The chicken was super moist, very flavorful and tender.  We really liked this chicken, including my 2 and 5 year old sons.  Wonderful!

these were good.. halved the oil and only used 2/3 of the salt bc i was worried about reviewers saying it was too salty.. i wish i would have used the full amount.. but this was still tasty.. didn't have egg substitute so left it out completely.. ty for the recipe ~~UPDATE: took this for a spin again and used this on  4 chicken quarters that i scored.. i added the full amount of salt and the egg.. i think the egg is supposed to emulsify the marinade but i didn't see the big deal about it.. i'll leave out the egg from now on.. i also only used a splash of olive oil for the full cup of veggie oil.. we absolutely loved the results.. ty again

I’ve been looking for a marinade that is savory, rather than sweet, so I decided to give this recipe a try.  I made 1/4 of the recipe for two boneless skinless chicken breast halves.  I used 1 T. of regular beaten egg and 1/4 t. of salt (I think the tablespoon of salt is a typo and perhaps should be 1 t.), but otherwise followed the recipe.  All I can say is, we thought this was just ok.  We thought the vinegar gave this a bit of an odd flavor.   So my search will continue.

This is the best chicken marinade we've found.  It has become a tradition to make it for our children's birthday party picnics.  Our friends and family always look forward to the bbq.  We use real eggs in place of the substitute.  One whole egg is equivalent to 1/4 cup egg substitute.

This is a good marinade for chicken.  The taste is not too heavy but does come through.  We had problems with the grill wanting to flame with this recipe.  Might have been because thighs have a little more fat on them.  All in all - good dinner.

Very tangy, maybe too much vinegar in the recipe.  Other flavors got lost. It was juicy, just not tasty.  0 out of 4 in the family liked this.

I love this recipe.  I have made it several times and my partner and I loved it every time.  Only tried it on chicken thighs and will definitely try breasts the next.  I also reduced the salt content, but not by much, and it turned out WONDERFUL!  Thanks BIG AL!

Good recipe.  I used the marinade on chicken breasts for a party.  I doubled the recipe and marinated for about 36 hours.  The chicken was tender and juicy with a good flavor.  I think this marinade would make a nice salad dressing as well.  For those who are wondering about the flavor, it really is like a mild Italian dressing.  I cut down on the salt per other reviewers.  I think I added 2 teaspoons (I doubled the recipe, remember), but I added slowly and kept tasting to see when I had enough for my taste.

We loved this so much that I made it two days in a row. The first time with boneless-skinless thighs, the next day with boneless-skinless breasts. It tastes better with the thighs, but either is fantastic. I halved the marinade as I was only using 4 pieces of boneless meat each time, therefore I cut the salt to a 1/2 teaspoon.  I did not reserve any for basting as I cut out that step. I sprinkled the meat with a dash of cajun seasoning just before cooking on the George Foreman grill. I cooked them one at a time (I have the tiny foreman grill) for 5 minutes each and kept them warm in a 250 degree oven. The other change I made was I had to substitute for poultry seasoning because I didn't have any. I used a dash of nutmeg, a dash of cayenne, and 1/4 tsp each of oregano, rosemary, onion powder and marjoram.  In the future, I will leave off my sprinkling of cajun seasoning, because it did make it a little too salty for me. I will probably make this at least once a week from now on.

REALLY liked this marinade!  Good tangy delicious flavor.  I did 2 things different from original recipe: 1.)I did follow others in reducing the salt to 1 tsp.  2.)I whisked all but the egg (had not egg substitue product), reserved the said amount, then whisked in 1 egg before pouring over meat.  I do feel the egg is necessary to keep from seperating while marinateing. Next time I make this recipe, I reduce vinegar just a bit.  I loved the tanginess, but felt the vinegar came out a bit too strong in the meat...just personal preferance. Thanks for the recipe.  (Husband prefers this over any soy sauce marinade that I usually use.)

I don't know if I did something wrong but this wasn't very good. I ended up doubling all the ingredients for the marinade ((since it seemed like it wouldn't be enough)) and I was only able to marinate the drumsticks I had for about 8 hours. But the flavor was so tangy. Maybe I am just not a fan of vinegar....or I just wasn't sure what to expect ((I don't ever use it...)) No one really complained about it but they didn't ask me to make it again either.

Very good and easy recipe. You'll find you have most/all of these ingredients on hand! I did feel it made too much sauce so next time I'll cut down on the sauce ingredients. Very good though and I'll make it again... Gotta love slow cooking!!!

When Big Al says, "Grill", take it literally. After marinating, I discovered that the charcoal wasn't good and I couldn't get a fire going. I was forced to broil the chicken, and it just didn't have much flavor.

From the reviews, I expected more from this recipe. Followed the suggestion from other reviewers to reduce the salt, and marinated it overnight.  It was very moist, but rather bland.  Won't make again.

This was a good marinade.  I don't think I let the chicken marinade long enough, though.  Will do that next time.  It wasn't an overly strong flavor, but everyone commented on how moist the chicken was, which is great, since doing it on the grill can tend to dry it out.

The flavour was awesome, but the oil just burnt and flamed. Unfortunately, being that we live in an apartment and have our bbq on the balcony, this was not a good idea for us. It also meant we couldn't use any as a basting sauce. We will try this again tomorrow when the bbq is outside on the grass. I used only 1 tsp salt and it was so so good. Thanks Al!

I am just learning how to grill food, and this was my third attempt.  Liked the flavor of the chicken, boyfriend really loved it.  I marinated over 24 hours.

SO good!  I used chicken breasts, because it's all I had.  But I would like to try it with legs also.  It has a little of an asian taste, maybe?  It was so moist!  Thanks Big Al.

A-MAZING.   Is a great all-purpose chicken recipe for grilled tenderloins.   With this blend of seasonings I can use it in the salad, in any dish,  and it has plenty of flavor on its own.    A family favorite.

Fantastic!! My husband said this is possibly the best chicken he's ever had! I wasn't sure about the vinegary smell, but once it's grilled it creates a great flavor. Yum! I didn't have egg substitute so I just blended in an egg. Thank you for an amazing recipe!

This is now a staple in my meal planning.  This marinade is quick and easy to make and never fails.  The only ingredient I don't keep on hand is egg substitute, so I have used one egg and it's turned out the same.  I've served this for company and always end up sharing the recipe.  This is our favorite chicken marinade.  I like it best on thighs, but breasts work well too.

My whole family loves this recipe! I don't make any changes when I make it, it's just right IMO. Delicous with bone in thighs but I also did skewers of boneless breasts for a party and everyone was asking for the recipe. It reminds me of the grilled chicken our local firemen sold by the roadside for fundraisers in the summer when I was a kid. Really delicous!

The chicken breasts were divine; the thighs were even better. 

Don't leave out the egg, it's much better with the egg emulsifier.  

If you have problems with the oil flaming on your grill, just pat the breasts/thighs with a paper towel before you toss them on the grill.

I love this recipe! So easy to make & delicious! I doubled the marinade, and let it set in the refrigerator for about 24 hours, didn't bother saving extra to bast it with. Took it to a BBQ & everyone loved it! Next time I think I will add a dash of cayenne pepper for a little heat in the background. Thanks Big Al!

Excellent marinade.  I added one freshly minced garlic clove in place of the garlic powder and used it on chicken legs instead.  Tasted awesome though the sauce is a little storng.  Gonna make it tonight again.
