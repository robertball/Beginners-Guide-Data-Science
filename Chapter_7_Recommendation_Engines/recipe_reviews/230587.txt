3.16.16 I had some hot Italian sausage links in the freezer which needed to be used so I just removed the casings and browned the sausage for this recipe. I don't use frozen spinach but I did have fresh spinach on hand so that was a minor change and I did add salt and pepper. Otherwise followed the recipe to the letter and it was delicious. This is easy to make has a good balance of ingredients and t's loaded with good flavor. Don't think you can ask for much more from a recipe.

Delicious and easy! Using what was in my kitchen I substituted Ro-Tel (1 fire-toasted 1 Chipotle) elbow macaroni and also used more beef than chicken broth. Thanks for the recipe!

I made a double batch of this. Very good! I used hot turkey Italian sausage. I didn't have any beef stock so I added just chicken stock and a couple of large tablespoons of better than bouillon roasted beef flavor base and it was delicious. Since this base is a concentrated paste and salty I didn't add any extra salt and it was perfect. Soup to me isn't soup without a few bay leaves so added those. I used mezze penne and cooked it for only 6 minutes separately and then added it in when I took it off of the stove. Nice recipe and is a keeper. I'm surprised that this recipe didn't have more reviews. It really is quite good.

I used 1 1/2 lbs. sausage because we like meat in our soups. I did notice on leftovers for the next day that the spinach and pasta tended to soak up a lot of the stock so had to add more.
