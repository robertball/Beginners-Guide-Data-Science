This was absolutely delicious, easy to make & better than any fish I have had in restaurants. First of all I couldn't get snapper so I used Kingclip fillets which I had never had before, very fishy smelling but not fishy in taste. Fillets were pretty thick so had to add a little more cooking time. I did as some others suggested and added a few seasonings. I added a little sliced onion, garlic salt, salt &cracked pepper, 
bay seasoning & 4 Tbls. sherry. I used a half pound of med. cooked shrimp & removed the shell on the tails before I put on fish. Really thought they would be tough as they were already cooked with the cooking in the oven besides but they were just find, not at all tough or dry. This dish is definately a keeper, also can easily be prepared a little ahead of time if having company, get your other sides in order & ready to cook, sit back & enjoy your company with a little drink & just pop it in the oven when ready to cook. I am not a big fish lover but this was excellent & certainly deserves a 5 Star in my opinion.

Let me tell you what I did...I added crab meat to the shrimp for the topping on the fish. It was GREAT! I also added Old Bay seasoning and Lawry's Season Salt to the sauce. I loved it and so did my boyfriend...he got up for the leftovers later that night.

This was a perfect meal for a summer night.  I made this using red snapper and served it with Basmati Rice and Crispy Cucumber and Tomato salad.

My family loved this dish!  I tweaked it a little after reading some of the other reviews.  I added about a teaspoon and a half of minced garlic, about a half teaspoon of onion salt and about a half teaspoon of black pepper to the sauce.  I also used imitation crabmeat because that's what we had in our fridge.  I prefer fresh shredded parmesan cheese as opposed to grated so that's what I used.  It was great!  I will definitely be preparing this for hubby and the kiddos again.  Pretty good as a leftover, too!

I left off the shrimp because all I wanted was a fish recipe to use up some red snapper I had in the freezer.  I followed the suggestions of some other reviewers and added some pressed garlic and rehydrated dried onion flakes to the butter before adding the flour.  I also added a splash of sherry to the finished white sauce.  I only had one pound of fish (there are only 2 of us) and since it is over 100 here in Las Vegas, I baked the fish in the toaster oven so as not to heat up the kitchen too much.  I sprinkled some paprika on the sauce-covered fish before adding the cheese, and placed a couple of thin lemon slices on each fillet along with a sprig of thyme before baking.  This come out delicious and my husband really liked it!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Thanks!

Delicious!  I made this with cod, and my family loved it.  After reading the other reviews, I added lemon juice, minced garlic, thyme and parsley.  Excellent!

I think this was fabulous. So simple, yet delicious! Yes, add seasonings to the fish and yes, add sherry (I added 2 Tablespoons) to the sauce. Unlike another reviewer, I WOULD serve this to company and I did with great reviews.

If you mess this dish up you CAN'T COOK!!  Fantastic and easy.  As a Seafood lover i'll add don't be shy on the butter....I would change the tempeture to 375 and add more garnish of parmasan cheese, salt, and parsley 10 minutes before removing from oven.  LET COOL!!!  I served it will baked potatoe and salad.  The family LOVED it...

So good!!! Very easy to make. I did season my fish and tweaked the sauce (as mentioned by several reviewers).  This has been added as a family favorite.  Love the idea of adding crab to the shrimp.  Also I used shaved Parmesan cheese instead.....way better!  Thanks for sharing.

We tried this last night and it was super yummy. I wouldnt make any changes except to mention that I used frozen salad shrimp ( thats what I had on hand) and fresh Tilapia. Well,my sauce got a little watery due to the shrimp =0(   Wont make that mistake again! So, if you use frozen shrimp. Thaw it completely and dry it off !

After reading the reviews I decided to add sherry to the recipe as well as onion & garlic powder on the fish.  I happened to use flounder.  It came out delicious!  It had a lot of flavor.  I get bored with plain old baked fish.  Will definitely make this again.  Hubby loved it too.

I have made this multiple times using different types of fish. Everyone has loved it. It is a very flavorful dish and very simple to make. Do season the fish before you put the shrimp and white sauce on. Sometimes I have used Old Bay and sometimes Dill Weed, it all depends on what I have on hand (always salt and pepper).

This recipe is awsome if you add crabmeat, onions, garlic, salt, pepper and tony cachere to taste to the sauce....nothing bland about it.  First try I used red snapper, but didnt like it....Next time I will put it over Tilapia....a winner!

So here is my take on this recipe, this recipe as is I find it to be a little bland.  I also use a more milder fish because I don't care for snapper.  I add to the sauce.  Usually fresh garlic, basil, and pepper.  Gives it more flavor along with the parmesan.  After adding the ingredients the rating goes much higher.  Hope you find this helpful.

This was good.  We enjoyed it.  I followed others' advice and sprinkled a little garlic salt and onion powder onto the fish.  I didn't have parmesean so I  added swiss cheese and a bit of Lawry's and some Old Bay into the white sauce.  Be carefult with the salt...a little goes a long way. I almost overdid it.

I also grated a bit of cheese on top before placing in the oven.  Using a thinner fish like catfish instead of snapper, you can reduce the cooking time a couple of minutes.  I cooked for 20 minutes but probably could've cut down the cooking time by a few minutes. As said by others, I kind of expected the shrimp to be overcooked as it was pre-cooked, but it was just right.

I think next time, I will double the sauce and serve it over linguine or angel hair pasta.

This was really good for a special meal.  Very easy to make too.  I made the white sauce in the microwave, just zap for a minute, stir, zap for 30 sec., stir... until thickened.  It's really faster and less likely to burn if you're careful!

I took the advice of some of the other people who reviewed this recipe and added Old Bay Seasoning as well as a heaping tablespoon of minced garlic to add flavor to the sauce. I couldn't find the fish called for in the recipe so used Pollock and Tilapia. Both tasted fine but make sure to get rid of the excess liquid or your dish will be quite watery. This was really good, even my bf liked it. I served this over egg noodles. Yum.

Not bad, but a little bland.  The parmesan just doesn't seem to go with the rest of the dish.  It might be better if the cheese were replaced with some herbs and spices.

My husband will not eat any type of cooked cheese.  It took 10 minutes to make the white sauce, slightly cook the shrimp, add cod fillets to the thickening sauce, then add the shrimp and I was done!  The dish was delicious, not cooked in the oven (where the shrump would have toughened) , so much so that I forgot to sprinkle cheese on my portion!  Maureen Sisk

I added the 4 Tbls of sherry to sauce & sprinkled fish with garlic salt & fresh pepper before covering with the white sauce and it was outstanding!  I also used haddock instead of the suggested fish.  Great recipe!

Wonderful! My husband and our dinner guests raved about it. For the fish I used Tilapia and since I had large shrimp on hand, I cut them in thirds.

This was pretty good.  I wouldn't serve it for company, but it was good to try once.  It definitely needed the 4 tablespoons of sherry suggested before; without that it would've been horribly bland even with the seasonings on the fish.  It was quite pretty out of the oven.  Still, I probably won't make it again.

Oh my goodness! Fabulous. I used red snapper, cooked shrimp and added sea scallops. I also added lemon juice, old bay, minced garlic and sherry to the sauce. I rubbed the snapper with salt, pepper and a bit of old bay. I will make this again and again and again. I forgot to add that I sprinkle parm grated cheese over scallops, shrimp before pouring sauce over casserole dish then after sauce sprinkled fresh parm shredded cheese over the top of the dish.  Thank you MLT for sharing such a marvelous recipe!!

Just made this for dinner.  Was wondering how such a simple recipe could be good.  But it's simple and flavorfu.  Tweaked the sauce a bit wth salt, pepper and garlic.  Make sure you thaw your fish and shrimp out.

I made this in an efficiency kitchen on vacation at Virginia Beach after visiting a local fish market. Didn't bring flour with me, so I used a hollandaise sauce packet. Delicious!

I used tilapia because that is what was available and it turned out really well.  I think I will add some spices to the roux next time I make it.

I downsized to two serveings and tweaked it a little by cutting down on the milk and adding 1/4 cup of Sherry wine to the sauce. Came out perfectly delishous.

For a unique and different variation to this dish, when frying the butter, add in one teaspoon of curry powder, a teaspoon of minced garlic and shallots, and toss in some chopped parsley after you pour the sauce on the fish. Gives it an Asian feel and taste. I tried it and it received rave reviews.

I really liked this.  I did take the advice of several reviewers and seasoned the fish before adding the white sauce.  I also added some white wine and garlic powder to the milk sauce.  It turned out very good.  I used catfish.  Can't wait to make this one again.  Looks great and tastes great.  Thanks for the post.

This recipe was very tasty, however I do have some improvements.  We used salmon which turned out excellent, and heavy cream instead of milk.  The sauce was very rich and the sheer volume of it overwhelmed the shrimp and fish.  Also, the 4T of sherry recommended made it way too strong.  Next time I'll reduce the sauce ingredients by 1/3 and add only one or two tablespoons of sherry.  You could also substitute Old Bay seasoning for the sherry for a different, spicier flavor!

Just baked this for dinner.  And all five of my children ate it.  Ages 7-13.  Before making it I read the other peoples reviews as I always do.  Most everyone said it was a little bland.  I didn't have any sherry on hand.  So I altered the recipes my added a little flavor to the fish.  First I dipped it in milk then into flour. After I laid the fillet in the baking dish I sprinkled them with lemon pepper and then made the sauce as written. Then sprinkled paprika on top, and baked it. It turned out great.

My husband and I are on a low-carb diet, so I altered this recipe a little bit. First, I used Mahi-Mahi because that's just what I had on hand. Then, I used soy flour instead of white flour and whipping cream instead of milk. It was suggested to add cooking sherry to the sauce, so I did do that. The taste was very flavorful but next time (and there will definitely be a next time) I will cut the sherry to 2 or 3 Tablespoons.

I used Tilapia instead but it was fantastic!  I also added a couple of diced garlic cloves and a diced onion while making the sauce. I even used raw shrimp instead of cooked to make sure it didn't toughen them up. I did sprinkle the fish and shrimp with black pepper and red pepper before putting the sauce on. I've added it to my regular dish as it was super, super easy to make. I served it with "forbidden rice"...or black rice. Mmmmm...Thank you!!

Very good! I seasoned the fish (tilapia is what I had on hand) with salt and pepper.   I had more shrimp than fish (5 fillets and 2bls of shrimp).  Also added a little bit of cheddar cheese to my white sauce.  Served with rice.  Hubby and I loved it!

Tried it for the first time today. I used catfish. It came out great! I followed others' suggestions to add minced garlic, garlic salt, and minced/dried onions to the butter mixture as well as 2 tbs. of sherry cooking wine after it has thickened. I also used shredded parmesan instead of grated. My family loved it!

I threw in all the seafood we had- shrimp, scallops, crabmeat, and tilapia. It was fantastic. The kids even loved it. We are big garlic fans, so I did preseason with some garlic salt.

Made for my mother-in-law's birthday and it was a hit.  I doubled the sauce and sprinkled some freeze dried chives on top for a little color.  Served with oven roasted red potatoes and asparagus.

This recipe really impressed everybody at dinner, including the three people who really don't like fish. We did a little modification, though. We added quite a bit of lemon juice and basil to the white sauce, and we added bay scallops to the recipe as well.

I have now done this recipe twice with crab.  I find I need twice as much sauce. 4 tblsp of butter, 3 -4 tblsp of flour and 2 cups of milk.  I've added seasonings to the sauce and it works better than seasonings to the fish.  You can't put too much parmesan on top.  The whole thing is like an old fashioned sole mornay - truly yummy.  Thanks so much to Mary Lynn Tumlin for the share.

DELICIOUS.  Took other users advice and seasoned with old bay.   I also used fat free half and half instead of milk.  
Fish couldve used a squeeze of fresh lemon.  Either way this was Goot!

This was OK ... I added about a tablespoon of Old Bay seasoning and I used tilapia. I still found it to be a little bit "blah" -- not terrible, but just not something I think I would find myself craving. My husband, who almost always raves over my cooking, even said it was "OK" when I asked him if he liked it (and I don't usually have to ask him). I don't know if I'll be making this again or not. Maybe the addition of white wine would help?

As usual, the reviews were good, so I gave it a try.  I was a bit skeptical - fish and shrimp?  But it works.  We liked it a lot.  I used tilapia and also added a couple of chopped cloves of garlic to the sauce.  A good romantic dish!

Excellent!  I added a lots of garlic and some ricotta cheese to the sauce for a little extra flavor.  I would definitely make this again.

Even my kids loved this dish! :0) Very good! I used catfish and made with a pound of shrimp ~ just because my family really likes seafood! :) We also added a liitle extra seasoning to white sauce for a little kick! This was a delicious meal! Thank you Mary!

I fixed this recipe tonight using grouper fille. I changed recipe a little by adding a tsp of chopped garlic and a small can of sliced mushrooms to the sauce.  Instead of parmesan, I used shredded low fat mozarella cheese.  I fixed baked potatoes and a salad.  The sauce was wonderful on the baked potatoes.  My husband, who does nor normally care for baked fish, loved this recipe.  The shrimp really enhance the sauce.

I was looking for a simple recipe to cook some snook I just caught, and being a very white meat, I didn't want to do anything with it to much, with alot of seasoning, spices, etc, to cover the flavor of the fish.
Reading the instructions for this, didn't sound like to much, and couldn't believe the reviews with the ingredients just being butter, milk and flower, but WOW, this was excellent!
Really enjoyed it.
Thank you Mary for sharing.

This was wonderful, easy and the kids ate it!! I made it as is but could easily change it by adding different seasons (may great ideas are mentioned in the reviews). I cooked my daughters seperate and didn't put the cheese on top. I did make 1 1/2 times the recipe for the sauce for 1 pound of flounder. So the flounder was swimming again! This was delicous and will be made again and again in our home.

I loved this recipe.  I used Halibut steaks and added shredded crab meat on top with the shrimp.  Otherwise I followed the recipe to the letter.  I don't normally care for fish, but this had so many other flavors, it was enjoyable to eat.  My husband said he liked it somewhat, but in reality didn't care much for the "white sauce" and would have preferred it without. Two different opinions at the same dinner table.

This was awesome!  My friends and I have a dinner party every week to try out new recipes and this was a real hit.  I used grouper and added crab meat to the shrimp topping and sherry to the sauce like the other reviewers recommended. I topped it with chopped yellow and red peppers for color and served with wild rice and mixed green salad.  Next time I would probably use only 3 tbs of sherry, four was a bit much.  A definite staple in my house! Thanks

GREAT Recipe! We really enjoyed it.  However next time I will add some sherry like others suggested to add some flavor.  But it was still good.  And it was actually a pretty dish..lol.  
I was worried about pre-cooking the shrimp and then putting them in oven, however they were GREAT! Thanks for a recipe that I will use again!!

I found this recipe very bland, even though I added Old Bay, Worcestershire sauce, white wine, lemon pepper, and cheddar cheese to the sauce.  I just couldn't get enough flavor going to really enjoy it.

I prepared this dish for my romantic valentine evening and it was a hit!! I seasoned the fish and the shrimp with a seafood seasoning.  I also added the 4 tablespoons of sherry to the sauce mixture as other reviewers suggested. I think without the added seasoning and sherry it would have been pretty bland.  I will be making this dish againg and again.

This was excellent! I will definitely make again. I used orange roughy and the taste was buttery and delicious. I also added 3 tablespoons dry sherry to the white sauce for added flavor. Probably could have added 4 tablespoons for perfect flavor. Beautiful presentation.

Very good!  I used cod fillets. I added some Mrs. Dash minced onion medley and some garlic powder to the white sauce and put chopped green onion and parsely on top.  My husband thought I'd gone all out and cooked a gourmet meal.  He loved it!  So did I!

I've made this 7 times using different fish and will keep this recipe forever.  Definitely add extra seasoning to the fish and sauce (old bay, garlic powder, onion powder).  The sauce is good with roasted asparagus too.

Made this with tilapia fillets and shrimp. Using this recipe as a base and some reviewers tips, the finished product was beyond yummy. I only had 3/4c of milk on hand and used heavy cream to make a full cup - having just a bit of heavy cream left in the container I added it and it totaled 1 1/4cup. I added 8 sliced cloves of garlic 4 tbsp of butter as it was melting. To the 2tbsp of flour I added 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp black pepper, 1/2 tsp emerald essence (substitution for old bay seasoning) 1/2 tsp mural of flavor (which is basically a  blend of a dozen different herbs without salt - purchased from Penzeys spices). I added 20 shrimp to boiling water and cooked for 2 minutes and drained. I put all the fish in the pan as instructed and grated 1/4c of fresh parmiggiano-regiano cheese over everyting. Cooked it for 30 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven. Fantastic!

So simple and delicious! I followed other reviews as well. I seasoned the fish (mahi mahi) prior to adding the shrimp and sauce. I did have to bake another 10 minutes than suggested since the fish was kind of thick. I also mixed in a splash of Sherry to the sauce before pouring it over the fish and shrimp. I served it with roasted potatoes and broccoli. The sauce was so good my family mixed the sides in it. Great recipe and I'll definitely make it again soon.

Just made this, excellent!! Added 2T white wine, seasoning salt, garlic and dried onion to the sauce.  Lightly cooked my shrimp in garlic butter first. (Had raw frozen jumbo shrimp, also cut them in half)Used fresh snapper.  Placed on a bed of quinoa with some steamed green beans on the side. Will definately make this again and again!!

This recipe was easy and delicious!  I used tilapia seasoned with Slap Ya Mama creole seasoning. I added sweet basil, garlic powder and oregano to my sauce. I also seasoned my shrimp Slap Ya Mama creole seasoning. Then I added the shrimp on top of the uncooked filets and poured the sauce over it. Finally, I topped it with Italian blend shredded cheese. Enjoy!

This dish NEVER fails me. It is always a hit! I use imitation crab instead of shrimp because it gives it a softer more delicate texture. And I double the cream sauce so it doesn't come out dry. Brown rice on the side with a green vegetable. Pair this with a dry Alsace Gewurztraminer.

Omg I made this for my family and they LOVED it!  It literally took less than 5 minutes to put together and pop in the oven, threw this together at 9:35pm after kids' band concert and by 10:00pm dinner was on the table!  We will be making this again!!!  Oh and I used scallops instead of shrimp and added some Mexican cheese on top and it was AWESOME!

Wonderful meal! Changes I made were adding Old Bay, salt and pepper to the roux.  Added Mexican 4 cheese blend to the white sauce.  Used cod fillets. About halfway through the cook time I poured off the excess water from the pan.  My dinner guests had nothing but compliments.

This was an excellent change from just doing the fish alone.  I usually bake my cod or other whitefish with only a lemon-pepper marinade.  This was a superb "change of pace" for my week-end.  Thanks for the idea and the recipe!

Family loved it with adding old bay, mushrooms, spinach. I also mixed the parmesan into the sauce on the stove to make cheese sauce instead of sprinkling it on top.

This was Great! I added some sauteed onions and garlic to the sauce. I also seasoned the Fish and Shrimp with Tony's, lemon pepper, and little more garlic. Very quick and easy to make. I can't wait to tell my Grandma about the receipe!

The fish I used was grouper.  I tweaked the recipe using some of the suggestions on reviews.  Still bland.

I've made this a couple times and it's very good. This last time, I added Crab Delights and topped it with slices of white American cheese. Tasted like the filling for seafood enchiladas from a Mexican restaurant I loved as a child.

this recipe was sooooo easy!!! Came out delicious, I altered it a little: what I did was season the fish with salt, pepper, garlic powder & some lemon juice, and herbal seasonings..also poured some sherry over the fish..the cream sauce I added salt & pepper to as well. I also added sliced mushrooms over the fish & shrimp, then topped with sliced tomatoes...delicious

This was actually my first ever cooking from scratch recipe and it came out great. Everything was perfectly moist. I did use catfish though and it took a bit longer to cook. If I can cook this anyone can!

hummm... I tried this recipe without the shrimp (as I saw that another user did too) but I didn't add anything additional and it turned out really salty. I even used less salt than the recipe called for. I gave it a 4 star rating because since I didn't follow the directions I didn't want to be too harsh but without the shrimp this reciped did not turn out good for me.

This is a wonderful and very easy dish!  I have a bad habit of trying new things on large groups of people.  It's risky but I get a lot of instant feedback and this got a big thumbs up! I actually used tilopia (my husband's favorite) instead of some of the meater fish and it was still delicious. I adjusted the cook time so that it wouldn't over cook.  I also recommend cooking your own shrimp for a great flavor.  Although you can buy it frozen for a quick alternative, the flavor of freshly cooked shimp is worth the extra step.  The most time consuming part is peeling them.  I've already sent out the recipe to everyone at the dinner party per their requests!  We'll be doing this one again and I can't wait to try it with other fish!  Great find! Thanks!

Awesome.  Made this with catfish nuggets and shrimp.  The taste was great, my hubby loved it that he said I didn't make enough.  Served with egg noddle pasta marinated in garlic and butter. And don't forget the garlic bread.

My family loved this.  I used Perch, I couldn't find Snapper and I added a little salt and pepper to the fish before adding the shrimp and sauce.  After baking, I put under the broiler for just a few minutes to brown the top.

This was great.  I used tilapia and added garlic and onion powder, also some salt and pepper.  I also used shredded parmesan cheese and more of it.

This was just okay for us. I used catfish, with steamed shrimp (seasoned in Old Bay, I'm a MD girl, LOL). It just was kind of blah. I may try it again, using some white wine, and more spices in the white sauce. I wouldn't recommend making it, without tweaking the recipe to suit your tastes.

This recipe umm...YUCK!  It tasted good, but the consistancy of the sauce was nasty...kind of like cottage cheese.  Me and my hubby didn't finish half of it, thankfully I made a pot of sweet chili in the crock pot today so we had an extra something to eat!  I do think this recipe would be better without the milk, sour cream would be better.  IF I decide to make it again, I'll try that instead.

We love this recipe----with some changes. Red snapper in my area is not obtainable; and, even if I could get it, I couldn't afford it!  So I use haddock fillets.  I add Old Bay, some Worcestershire sauce and a little fresh lemon juice to the sauce to give it some zing.  This would be a great dish to serve to guests.  Thanks for sharing.

This was fairly good and easy, but it needed something else.  Maybe I will follow other reviewers' suggestions and add garlic or sherry next time.  It just seemed to be missing that extra kick, and it came out tasting a little too fishy.  I used tilapia fillets, maybe I'll try a different type of fish next try.

Made this for my family!! Loved it.  I did put in some sherry, which was a hit.  Has been asked for again.  And I will make it again.  I used halibut the first time great!!!  I tried it with salmon cause it was the only kind I had, My hubby loved it but it was not really a hit for the rest of us.  Next time I'll stick to the white.........

Good. Definetly requires more sauce. The white sauce is good by itself, but go with extra seasoning if you want to be creative.

I made this with cod and ocean perch.  Both were purchased frozen, and they were fabulous!  This is a restaurant quality recipe and is sure to impress anyone you make it for.  I followed some other reviewer's suggestions and added about 1/3 cup white cooking wine and some garlic powder to the sauce.  I think this was essential to the flavor.  Be sure to use real parmesan cheese.

I liked this, but next time I have to use another type of fish.  I didn't prefer what I used.  However, I did enjoy the combo of shrimpwhite sauce on top, with a few alterations.   I sauted some onions and added sherry to the sauce.  I also crushed some Ritz crackers on top before baking.  Doing that gave it an interesting texture.  With another fish I probably would have rated this higher.

This was delicious!  I followed the advice of others and added 4 TBSP of sherry to the sauce.  I also seasoned the fish fillets with onion, salt, and garlic before baking.  I will definitely be making this one again.

This is so easy and really tastes great. I used small catfish filets and added some pepper to the sauce.

This was good. I used cod because it was on sale (besides, it's my favorite). Tasty, yet sort of bland. I added 4 Tbsp. of sherry to the sauce and sprinkled the fish with garlic powder, onion powder and course ground pepper. Next time, I will use a stronger flavored fish such as, grouper, which was suggested in the original recipe.

After reading the reviews, I decided to season the fish and add Sherry to the white sauce.  This is absolutely delicious!  My son and husband love it!

This turned out great!  I used orange roughy instead and was very pleased!  We'll sure make this one again before too long.

What a delicious and easy way to prepare fish.  I added parsley, garlic powder and pepper to the sauce to spice it up a bit.  I also went heavier on the cheese.  I will definitely try it again with various fish.

This was absolutely delicious! I'm on a diet so I used light margarine and skim milk and it was still rich and yummy. By the way, I used cod since it was on sale and it was great.

This was delicious! I used catfish which I happened to have in the freezer.
I didn't notice the time, I took it out when the cheese was slightly brown.
I would guess that the timing depends on the thickness of the fillets.  Mine was done.

This recipe was so simple I thought I messed up.  This was my first time introducing this baked fish and shrimp, the sauce was delicious and fish was just right.  I would do it all over again with no problems.  I enjoyed cooking it as well as eating it.

The reason we all love baked fish is because it is so easy to prepare.  The wonderful thing about this recipe is that the dish is not only simple, but is delicious as well!  My husband and kids loved the dish.  I used red snapper, which turned out to be perfect!  The dish looks pretty on a plate with pasta and a green veggie.  This is my new fave way to bake fish.

This recipe is so good. I did season  the fish with salt and pepper after reading other reviews. And I had heavy whipping cream that I had to use up.  But those were the only changes I made. It makes me crazy to read reviews and someone has changed to whole thing the first time they make it. I always follow the recipe the first time and adjust the 2nd time.

I seasoned the shrimp with garlic powder Himalayan salt and black pepper. I used croaker seasoned with himalayan salt and black pepper also I used wheat flour with corn starch for thickening. I used almond milk. I also used both grated and shredded parmesan cheese. It was so delicious. I will make this again but next time i will sprinkle alittle  red pepper flakes on the shrimp for seasoning and I'm going to try it with tilapia. My family loved it. Also i baked at 350 degrees for 25 minutes

Okay, so this was too bland for anyone to enjoy, so I added kosher salt, pepper, lemon, minced garlic  and basil.  And I swapped the milk for whipping cream. I guess that makes it a whole different recipe. LOL Sorry. I tried. Next time I would also put some cherry tomatoes halved too. Just sayin.

I made this for myself since I don't eat chicken, pork, or beef and my husband wanted BBQ chicken. It was delicious!! I cant wait to dig into the leftovers for lunch tomorrow. The only thing I did differently is added light seasonings such as pink himalayan salt, pepper, garlic powder, and a little slap yo mamma cajun seasoning to the fish. I also added garlic powder to the sauce. I loved it!!  Definitely making this again!! Cant wait to take it to my family potluck either!!

As I said in my notes, this is an excellent recipe. I used Cod, as that’s what was in the house. I added a tiny bit of Italian seasonings. Fantastic dish that looks too simple, but the taste will make You a fan!

This is definitely a winner in our house. But to spruce it up, I added semi cooked onions and sliced  red bell pepper on top of the fish before adding the sauce. I also mixed bread crumbs and parmesan cheese to the top the last 15 minutes to make a slight crust on top. I would have given it five stars if I hadn’t messed with the recipe.

Personal preference omitted the cheese.
Substituted 1/4 tsp lower sodium chicken 'Better than Bouillion' for the salt.
For 2 people and 2 large fillets, I used a generous 1/4 lb of small cooked Oregon Shrimp.
Sauteed 1 large minced garlic clove  while melting the butter, and added 3 thin sliced green onions to the completed sauce.
I will make it again and again, easy, elegant, tasty.

I used cod and uncooked shrimp with the seasonings that we like with our seafood, garlic, sherry and fresh parsley. I covered the cast iron skillet for 15 mins and removed the cover the last 5 mins.  It was good but, without using cooking common sense and adding preferred spices, it would've been too bland for our taste buds, thus 4 stars instead of 5. Oh and for the milk, I always mix evaporated  in for the extra creamy texture. I think I will add lump crab the next time I make it, and I will be making it again and again.

Simple and quick to make. Turned out just fine. 
Remember never let seafood sit and always get the fresh stuff otherwise it will make the taist different. If your fish smells bad it's probably not fresh. Just a lesson learned from fishing for years.

This dish was very very good.  I used Almond Milk which was still delicious and I added a pinch of Old Bay seasonings to the fish, prior to covering it with the sauce. My husband who doesn't like to try new dishes, loved it. This is a keeper.

Loved it! Very delicious and easy to make.  Served over garlic mashed potatoes with a side of steamed vegetables.  Modified the recipe with the following as suggested by others:  Used frozen tilapia and frozen precooked shrimp.  Thawed both under fresh water, patted dry, and placed in large casserole dish. Seasoned both with Tony Chacere's Creole seasoning salt, McCormicks Gourmet Roasted Coriander, McCormicks Gourmet Moroccan Seasoning.  Added minced garlic to the butter before adding the flour, and added about a 1/2 cup of Sherry Cooking Wine,  and just a pinch of salt.  Used fresh grated Parmesan cheese thick layer, and sprinkled the top with a small amount of cayenne, and more of the Moroccan seasoning for color.  Because I used a large casserole dish I had to increase the time cooked to 35-40 minutes.  Best if served immediately from the oven.  Awesome!

I made this using Tilapia and topping with cooked shrimp.  I also took some of the reviewers tips and seasoned the Tilapia & Shrimp first, by sprinkling on garlic powder, pepper, adobe powder, and cajun seasoning.  Once I sprinkled on the parmesan cheese, I topped with paprika for a little color, and cooked for 20 minutes.  I did not add any wine.  This was delicious, and the shrimp did not dry out at all.

I made this dish for an office pot-luck holiday lunch. Boy, did my fellow workers dive into it. I can't recommend it enough. Easy to make and very tasty, in the best comfort-food kind of way. I should add that it works with any type of white fish filets - I used a combination of basa and haddock.

I really liked this recipe just like others I did add a little bit of extra ingredients. First I made it exactly the way the recipes calls for but I added 1 extra tablespoon of butter to the sauce. Once I did that I tasted and I felt like it could use a little more of something. So I added some minced garlic probably about 1 tsp of minced garlic, dash of pepper and it made the sauce soooo much better. Instead of red snapper, I used seasoned catfish and tilapia the catfish is much better but the tilapia is good as well. I will definitely be making this again for so many people.

Absolutely Delicious! I have been looking for something different than the "same old" fish recipes, this was PERFECT!!! I used tilapia, otherwise the only thing I did differently was added some green onions and garlic on top as well. I was very impressed we will so use this recipe regularly.

This has become a regular in our house.  Its very easy to make and everybody, including my 4 year old and 1 year old, loves it.  I don't usually add the shrimp on top but its just as delicious without them.

One of the easiest and best tasting fish dishes I've found a recipe for! My family and I liked it so much, they suggested we have it two or three times a week (it won't happen!) The only thing I changed was I put some Old Bay in the white sauce, it added a bit more flavor.

I made this with sole instead of snapper. And used 1/2lb  raw prawns and left over Trader Joe canned dungenous crabmeat. Added some old bay seasoning to the sauce when salt was added. I baked it for 28 minutes since the prawns were raw and the sole 1/2 thawed. Served over bed of Dreamfields angel hair pasta. It was so good and my family loved it!  Per my son, "Creamy deliciousness!" Next time I would add more old bay seasoning and perhaps garlic powder and other herbs to season up the sauce more. This is a keeper.

Flavor was very good. My fish and shrimp produced a lot of water and diluted my white sauce.

This dish was super easy & pretty fantastic. Next time I make it (and I definitely will) I may make a bit less of the white sauce mainly because I like the favors of the fish and shrimp and want to taste them a bit more. I added garlic and a dill seasoning mix to the butter, as well as lemon pepper & a small amount of lemon juice to the sauce.  I used swai filets. Really good
recipe for dinner guests.

Easy recipe. I'd add a little bit of lemon or lime juice. Not sure if it's 100% appropriate for red snapper but we both enjoyed it.

Delicious and elegant.  Would serve this to guests.  I used Orange Roughy and Flounder because that's what I had.  Cannot wait to try it with other fish.

This recipe is phenomenal. I followed the directions n simply added a few spices such as old bay seasoning on the fish and garlic to the sauce per the other reviews. Good dish! I would serve this at a family function.

I think it was a great recipe I did add lemon pepper , old bay, creole seasoning and garlic powder. I also seasoned and  cooked the shimp for about 3 min and reserved the juices to poach the fish( I seasoned that too) , for just a few till the outside was white the inside was still clearly raw. I added mushrooms to the sauce, creole season , garlic powder, swiss cheese and lemon pepper . The past reviews were very helpful it was a hit in my home my husband is the only one that wasn't in love with it. I would make it again but maybe try it with salmon.

This recipe was GREAT! I used talapia & lemon pepper seasoning. I added black pepper, minced onions, minced garlic & parsely to my sauce. Sauted my shrimp in extra virgin olive oil & a splash of minced garlic (cooked til pink). Then add shrimp & sauce to uncooked filets.  Topped with fresh crabmeat a dash of old bas seasoning and lemon juice.  This was AWESOME AND IM QUITE SURE GUEST WOULD LOVE IT AS WELL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This recipe was good even though I made a few substitutions.  I used 50/50 white/whole wheat flour (I was out of white), it made the sauce a bit grainy and brown..but it was good!  I used unflavored rice milk instead of regular (couldn't tell the difference).   I added crushed garlic and dehydrated lemon crystals to the white sauce, and added fresh parsley.

Delicious.  Took the advice of other reviewers & made some adjustments.  Added two sprigs of thyme to each red snapper fillet. Also added garlic salt, cracked black pepper & old bay to the fillets.  As well as shrimp used two tins of jumbo lump crab meat.  Also added a layer of very thinly sliced onion.  After baking broiled for 5-10 minutes to add a layer of golden crunchiness.  Added bow-tie pasta to the left overs the next day.  Found that the pasta really tied it all together.  Delicious.

This was alright.  I gave it 3 stars because I think it needed a fair amount of tweaking.  I don't have sherry on hand but I added suggested seasonings by others (old bay, season salt, pepper, garlic powder, parsley).  It came out okay.  I think the temp should be increased to 375 as someone else suggested and be sure to season your fish first.  Also, I'm not sure how thick the coating was supposed to turn out in the end.  the consistency was fine when i made the sauce in the pan (coated the spoon) but once in the casserole dish, the moisture in the shrimp and fish diluted the sauce and caused it to be kind of clumpy and a little unappealing.  I might increase the flour slightly or make it a little thicker to avoid this in the future.

Made this last night. Used catfish and raw shrimp. Per other reviews added a small amount of onion and some fresh minced garlic to to the butter before adding the flour. It was amazing! DH is still raving about it!

I made this recipe.It came out very good.I used Old Bay Seasoning along  with salt and pepper to season the fish. When my mom made the sauce she just used flour and milk,and added baby shrimp.Baby shrimp go best with Red Snapper fish.There was a little Sherry Wine added to the sauce.We also added a touch of lemon juice to the sauce also.Before pouring the sauce over the fish it is best to drain the juice from baking,other wise the Monzarella cheese will not brown.We used Monzarella cheese instead of Parmasan.It was a very good dish will make again.

I tried this recipe as a Christmas treat for my friends and family. It was wonderful. I added minced garlic in the butter and I lightly seasoned the fish and shrimp. I also used mozzarella cheese instead of the parmesan. It gave the white sauce a nice golden brown crust. Thanx for the recipe!

This was really good! Actually looking at this recipe I see now that I forgot to add salt and it turned out pretty good without it! My b/f was skeptical of the ingredients as I was putting them together but he went back for seconds after it was done! His only complaint was that it was too thick, maybe I'll fix next time by adding some milk or water to thin out? I liked tho :-)

I used suggestions to make this sauce better but it was very difficult to make it flavorful and delicious. I do not recommend this recipe for new or intermediate cooks who are not able to change the sauce on their own. As is, the sauce is not good. I do however think the basic idea behind this recipe is good!

I really enjoy differnt types of fish recipes, unfortunately this wasn't one of them. The sauce is very bland. When everything is baked together the overall impression is a very fishy tastless dish.

This was excellent and so easy.  I took the advice of other reviewers and added in pepper, Old Bay and tarragon.  I squeeze lemon over the fish prior to putting on the shrimp.  I also added about a 1/2 c of Asti Spumanti (I had it laying about after Christmas) and it made it amazing!  I paired it with the Spinach and Rice and poured the sauce over it.  Easy and excellent!  Loved it.

This was a pretty good meal. I've made a similar recipe with only cod and a different cheese, and I thought the shrimp was a little wasted in this dish. I would have preferred it to be all fish, and no shrimp. Certainly good to eat though - thanks for submitting the recipe :)

This is a delicious recipe - I used half and half instead of milk. At first I thought the sauce was to salty, but when served on a bed of plain white rice, it wasn't. Great - can't wait to make it again.

I didn't like this recipe at all.  The sauce was bland and the dish was way too fishy for me.  I think it is because the shrimp cooks on top of the fish, so all the "fishy" flavor was soaked up in the basa fillets we used.  My husband liked it, though, so it wasn't a total loss for us.  I probably won't make again, but if I do, I'll keep the shrimp off my piece of fish!

This was a good recipe, however, it was a little bland. I added Old Bay seasoning to give it a little zing and that made all the difference!

This dish is fabulous. I made the sauce with half/half. Added sweated onion, garlic, Tony Chachere to taste to my sauce. Salt and pepper to the fish. Remember the parmesean is salty when seasoning this dish. Thank to the others for the helpful hints.

We tried this recipe last night.  We were very dissappointed it is VERY VERY bland..we used catfish and it tasted like fish cooked in milk with a little cheese? I ate 1/2 of mine and my boyfriend ate part of his and we ended up ordering pizza.

I thought that this was a good start for a creamy sauce but you definately have to add to it. I add capers and crushed garlic and lots of ground pepper.

I thought this was an excellent recipe.  I added 1/4 tsp each of garlic powder and onion salt with some ground black pepper to the sauce.  I also thinly sliced some onion, separated the rings and placed them between the shrimp and the fish.  I can't say that I cared for the Parmesan cheese though, I'll be leaving that off next time.

WOW!!! As with most recipes we all 'doctor' them to accommmodate our own 'tastes'.  To the Basic White Sauce I added -> about 1-tsp Minced Onions (I re-hydrate them with equal parts water and let them sit for a few minues), 1/2-tsp or so of Fresh Ground Black Pepper, Dash of Cayenne and Pinch of Nutmeg. Also buttered some dry-breadcrumbs and sprinkled them on top ...
Even my husband RAVED ... Served with BakedPotate and Veggie Blend (Carrot, Brocolli and WaterChestnuts)  Becuase I was making this for (2), there was plenty of Sauce to spoon over Veggies .. a DEFINITE Keeper

My family LOVED this.  (I'm a vegetarian, so didn't taste it.)  I did taste the sauce, though, and it was very good.  I used catfish and frozen baby shrimp (popcorn shrimp).  I will make this dish again and again, and I will also use the sauce for other recipes.  I followed someone's advice here from an earlier post and added 4 tablespoons dry sherry to the sauce.  It was perfect.

Sauce was bland and I even added a little more salt and pepper as well as fresh parsley.  Probably won't make it again.

I added my own touch to this recipe. I used catfish instead of what's called for. I buttered my pan, no spraying and seasoned the fish with a lemon-pepper spice. I also added lemon-pepper to the sauce because it was quite bland and nice touch of hot sauce. It was pure perfect.
