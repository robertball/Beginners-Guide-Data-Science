4.5.19  I didn’t have baby carrots, so I just cut my whole carrots into sticks.  Although I’m not convinced that you save any time using the Instant Pot®, the sauce was quite flavorful.  My carrots were overcooked at 6 minutes even with releasing the pressure  instantly (not waiting 5 minutes), but that could have something to do with not using baby carrots.  If I were to use the Instant Pot® again, I’d probably try 3-4 minutes.  Very tasty, but honestly, I’ll probably just steam the carrots in the microwave in the future which only takes about 2-3 minutes, but most definitely will use the orange-ginger sauce in this recipe.

I made this according to the recipe except I had a 16 oz bag of baby carrots that I used.  It was tasty and everyone liked them! I might drop the time to 5 minutes next time as I like my carrots on the firm side.
