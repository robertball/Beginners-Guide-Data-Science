I took a chance and made a triple batch (in a cookie sheet and made bars)of this for a Fourth of July party where there were a gathering of "Foodies". Everyone RAVED about its taste. They had no idea you could make cantaloupe into a pie. I followed the recipe exactly with these exceptions; I also used salted butter. In the instructions it forgets to say when to add the margarine so I added it along with the eggs. I would have used real whipped cream but the party was outside and was afraid it wouldn't hold up under the heat. I did decrease the amount of cool whip so I could taste the cream cheese a little stronger. I tasted the pie after 2 hours of chilling and then again in the morning. Even better in the morning! Very important that you use ripe tasty cantaloupe! Taste is mild and very refreshing! I'm serving this for a catered luncheon next week! Will make this again and again.

served this for July 4th and everyone raved!  This pie has such a unique flavor, just incredible.  Bought melon 5 days prior and kept at room temp. was very ripe, sweet, and juicy. sqeezed some of the juice out and reserved. Pureed then measured, added back what was needed for 3cups. Used a wisk to cook and no lumps. Cannot imagine making this with margarine. used real butter(is there any other way w/baking such a special dessert pie?)  Recipe didn't state when to add the butter in the filling; added it once I got the flour, starch, sugar wisked into the puree. didn't bother to temper the yolks, just whisked constantly and poured a small steady stream; worked fine. Added 1/2 tsp. orange blossom water to filling.this enhanced the cantaloupe flavor without overpowering and added a nice aspect. Cooked filling is the color of butterscotch and set up perfectly.  The crust is fool-proof.looks dry when mixing, but even with overworking and patting into the pan, it was tender, made for a slighly sweet crust similar to a shortbread if made with butter!  What everyone loved about this was that it was not sickening sweet.  Each component of the pie was perfectly sweetened without being over the top sweet.  I cannot wait to make this pie again. The whipped topping makes enough that you can pile it high.  Beautiful presentation.Thx for this wonderful recipe that I will be making for years to come. Had multi-cultural guests and they all agreed that this was just incredible.

No one in my family liked this pie...and we all love cantaloupe (and dessert too!). I thought the crust was very bland, the filling too sweet and the topping just too heavy for this pie. I made the recipe as directed, no changes on my part.

I give this one a 5* for taste, but a 4* for direction. The filling was a bit too sweet to me, but no one else seemed to mind. My melon was also rather bland to begin with so I would cut the sugar back next time, especially if using a sweet, well-ripened melon.  The cantaloupe taste came through well and the cream cheese topping complemented it quite nicely. I will admit to sneaking in a few drops of food coloring to compensate for my mediocre melon. It may have been my inexperience with cream pies, but the instructions didn't seem clear in a few places. They don't specify the type of sugar to use, and for the topping confectioners was the only kind that made sense to me so that is what I used.  You will want to make sure the pie has set almost all the way before you try spreading on the topping or you will make a mess.  Also, I mixed the topping about 15-20min too early and in the time it sat it managed to go from perfectly spreadable to a thick mass.  I would definitely mix it up right when you intend to spread it on the pie instead of getting it done early. Other than minor construction mistakes, I thought this was a really nice pie.  It was very light and refreshing, not to mention unique!  I will be making this again, tweaking only lightly, and I will wait until I have a good, sweet melon. Oh, and my melon made about 4 1/2 cups of puree.

A few people liked the pie, but for the most part people thought it was too sweet.  The consistency wasn't that great, but it was edible.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you know people *love* cantaloupe.  The only one person whom raved about this pie, was a pregnant woman.

Very nice pie. My husband and I aren't real fans of a cream pie, but we had to use up several small bland melons from our garden, on the verge of going bad.. We both enjoyed a small slice, and I brought it to a church function where people finished it none the wiser as to the unusual ingredient. It was commented by one that the topping is a bit heavy, and since there is a generous amount anyway perhaps one could halve the cream cheese? No offensive or overtly "cantaloupe" flavor. To me it's the kind of thing that's quite delicious in a small dose, but not great the second time around. Especially good for gatherings, and it served my purpose well.

This is a very light pie- it is a great summertime treat.  I made no modifications with the exception of using fat free whipped topping.

Wow, what a hit this was!  I replaced the Cantaloupe with Golden Sweet melons I had grown in my garden.  When I first said what it was, no one was very enthused, but everyone was surprised by how good it was. This recipe is a real winner. To avoid trans fats I used real butter instead of margarine. I will certainly make this again. I want to try it with other types of melon.

This would not be the first pie I would choose to eat but it was quite good.  It was easy to make and was very attractive. My melon was very sweet  so I used just 3/4 cup sugar.  A very good way to use extra cantaloupe.

I'm only giving this 3 stars. While everybody liked it, they thought it was too sweet. It was definitely worth trying.  Especially when wanting to use up some cantaloupe that is getting too soft.

I've never thought cantaloupe would taste so good in a pie! I followed the filling portion of the recipe, however for the topping I made a sort of light vanilla-y egg custard which I spread on top once the filling had set. This has just the right amount of sweetness and if you use margarine the saltiness of it makes a nice contrast. The crust was quite nice too. Will definitely make this again!

This is fantastic!  And I've never made a cream pie of any sort.  I did not add the margarine to the filling.  This years' cantaloupe harvest required a little creativity in the kitchen.  Delicious!  My husband says its very refreshing ... definate keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is the type of recipe that you either like or you don't. I found it to be very rich and was only able to eat a small piece but my fiancee' ended up finishing it off. He loved it!

This came out very good.  I was out of milk and didn't realize it in time to go buy some more, so I didn't use it in the topping and it came out just fine, it was just a little tough to spread.  Great cantaloupe flavor, very interesting dish, will make again.

I gave this one five stars.  What a pleasant surprise.  It has a light, not too sweet flavor.  Very summery.  Everyone that tried it just loved it.  Will definitely make again.  What a great new way to use cantaloupe.  Thanks.

Overall good taste, I thought the topping was way too much so I cut in half.  Very fun novelty pie. I felt the recipe used a lot of sugar, but I tried it again with less sugar and it wasn't as good

This is a wonderful recipe - I'd never heard of cantaloupe pie before.  I made it exactly as posted. It also sets up and cuts well, very pretty pie.  And the topping is very flavorful.  We ranked this up with our top "favorite" pies!

Made this yesterday morning for a party in the afternoon and it was a huge hit. I was a little skeptical after tasting the melon pudding, because it took on a slightly over-ripe squash-like flavor once it was cooked, but I just added a few teaspoons of lemon juice and it seemed to balance out in the end. Only changes I made were that I increased the recipe by half, and put it in a 10.5" Springform pan so that it would be easy to cut and serve. I was worried that it would all squish out once I removed the pan but it held together just fine. just make sure you let it chill well before serving. Also, took the advice of other reviewers and reduced the sugar. It all depends on the sweetness of your canteloupe, and personal taste. Other addition was slightly tart chile apricot sauce drizzled over the top since we are in Tucson and love our chiles. Also, used home-made whipped cream instead of Cool-Whip since some folks might freak out about that. The crust is amaaaazing. Had to add a little water to make it stick together in this dry climate. This is a unique and special dish and I will definitely be doing this again.

This was good, but it was time consuming to make, and the end result was not necessarily more tasty than a good melon by itself.  Maybe if I cut down on time by using a prepared crust...
