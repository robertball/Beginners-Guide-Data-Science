Technically your version is Chana Palak. Palak meaning Spinach. Chana, meaning chickpea, or Garbanzos. A good dish overall!

Good taste but next time I'll add an extra can of chickpeas and drain it. I'm not a huge fan of onion, so I put in half a cup of frozen chopped onions and next time I'll cut it down to 1/4 cup. The sauce and onions were too overpowering for me.

I did not care for this recipe, but my husband said he'd eat it. We eat a lot of indian type food. This is the first 'flop' I've made.

I thought this recipe was terrible.  There was no sauce to it and the spices were not flavorful- had too much of a tart flavor.  This is the second Chana Masala recipe I have tried and I will keep looking.

Easy, full of vegan protein and tasty! My teenage son said, "See, Mom, you should cook more often!" I didn't have coriander so simply omitted it. This will definitely be a regular side dish from now on.

I bought more chickpeas 3 days later so that I could make this again. The only problem is I wanted more of it. So good and a balanced recipe. I used Ghee instead of oil & only 1 tablespoon of lemon juice.

I didn't think it tasted much like the Chana Masala I am used to, but it was pretty darn tasty.  And so easy!  I'll probably play around with the spices a bit in the future, but a great base recipe.
