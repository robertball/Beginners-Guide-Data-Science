Enjoyed this recipe. The only adjustment I had to make was the cooking time of the chicken hearts because they go tough quickly. Instead of salt I would highly recommend using fish sauce. YUM!!

Thank you ever soo much. When I  follow a recipe, I FOLLOW that recipe. If I add or subtract , then it's a whole different recipe, soo I did as this recipe said, & it was SPOT ON! Never better. I make chicken hearts a lot, in butter,  or oil, like it says,  but the  mushrooms really added that extra great flavor. Onion is always great of course, , But this is a wonderful recipe. Thank you again. Cheers . From N.V.

I used lobster and shaggy mane mushrooms that had been cooked in butter and wine. Also used lots of salt and pepper to taste. Tastes pretty good to me. Would probably be good served over rice or noodles.
