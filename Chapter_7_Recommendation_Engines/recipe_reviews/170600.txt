Hubby's remark at the dinner table was that this "needed something" and I agree.  It needed the gorgonzola the recipe called for but I couldn't add because he doesn't like it. I didn't measure ingredients, just added to taste, and used chicken broth rather than vegetable. Three stars, average and kind of boring, the way I had to make it - and four stars had it been prepared the way the submitter intended with the gorgonzola.

This recipe was very good.  I'm giving it 5 stars because of ease and taste and the versatility I can foresee with this recipe.  Exactly as written makes for a lovely vegetarian meal.  I have been wanting to make this for a while, but Trader Joes has been out of Orzo and I kept forgetting to look for it at the regular market.  Ok, back to the recipe.  I didn't have any veggie broth, but I had chicken so I used that.  It doesn't matter what liquid you use and the possibilities would be endless.  The only other deviation was I didn't have Gorgonzola.  I thought I did- we LOVE it, but I only had Feta.  So in went the Feta.  All else I kept the same except I used tomatoes out of my garden chopped and not cherry, but a tomato is a tomato, right?  It was delish with the Feta and I could see adding in Kalamata olives to it for more of a Mediterranean flavor.  I think you could also use mozzarella cheese for more of an Italian vibe.  I will be making this again with the gorgonzola for sure plus playing around with some additional flavors.  Thanks for sharing.

Made it as the recipe called for, except I couldn't find gorgonzolla cheese so used feta and used fat free chicken broth.  It was WONDERFUL!  My husband loved it!  We'll make this again.  One tip, keep a close eye on the orzo.  I turned my back on it for a couple of minutes and almost burned it!

My husband absolutely loved this recipe!  I thought it was pretty good myself.  My only suggestion is to add the tomatoes to the orzo in the last 2 minutes so it will take the edge off the raw tomato.

Very tasty.  I made a few modifications.  I used mozzerella instead or gorgonzola and sage, dill, and chives instead of basil.  I also only used a quarter of an onion, which is good because the onion was STRONG.  My housemates eyes are watering from the onion.

I used Roma tomatoes and chicken broth due to availability. Other than that I made this as written.   I found that I like Gorgonzola cheese but it was too over-whelming in this dish. 1/3 of that amount would have been plenty. I didn't appreciate the flavor of th orzo as much once it was browned. It did brown very quickly too so be careful. I used 1 average sized red onion and felt like I could have either chopped it smaller or used less of it. I wish the author specified what size or a quantity of this ingredient to use.   Because the flavor of the cheese was so overpowering I added some leftover chicken breast. This didn't help much.  The next time I make this I will reduce the amount of cheese by 2/3's and possibly the onion as well. I will also not brown the orzo.

this is a winner. I always use Maytag blue cheese. The best part--this is a room temp dish, so can be made ahead.

I tried it as written, and I would give it a three. Made again, we used feta instead and added just a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomato mixture. Much better that time. The gorgonzola was a little strong for me too.

I have to say I followed the recipe to the T and LOVED it. It was a great crowd pleaser (only 4 of us) and my guests even wanted to take what we had left over home for the next day, will absolutely make this again! Thanks!

My husband and I thought there was too much gorgonzola, I'll try it again but I will cut the cheese in half.  For us it just took over the whole flavor of the dish.

I think I've decided that I am not an orzo fan.  This is my second attempt at making an orzo recipe and neither one I would repeat.  I love basil and gorgonzola so I was hoping for the best with this one but not so.  I didn't change the recipe at all except to halve it.  It was really disappointing when about half the orzo stuck to the bottom of my pan at the end of the cooking time and I used the minimum cooking time.

Absolutely amazing.  It wasn't even what I was originally aiming for, as I wanted a completely chilled orzo meal, but it still floored me.

Overall it was quite good. However, I felt as is the gorgonzola somewhat overpowered the dish. Next time I will try using Fontina cheese so it allows the flavor of the tomato/basil mixture shine through.

If I could give this more stars I would....it was absolutely OUTSTANDING!!!!! I did use chicken broth, but that was my only change. Everything about this was perfect! I did layer one portion on the plate real nice so I could get a picture, but when it was time to eat, I just ended up mixing it all in a bowl and calling it a day, which ended up awesome because the gorgonzola cheese just started to melt and get creamy and everthing was just so....YUMMY! I will be making this OFTEN, really OFTEN!!!! Thanks for sharing. :)

Great recipe! Easy to make. Browning the orzo was a great idea, it gave depth to this meal. This recipes is great for picnics, camping and other outdoor events.

I really enjoyed this recipe!  Made this ahead for work lunches and it really satisfied.  I used chicken broth instead of veggie b/c that was what I had, diced plum tomatoes instead of cherry, and used cubed mozzarella instead of gorgonzola due to availability.  The orzo does brown quickly so be careful.  I added toasted pine nuts, which really accented the nutty flavor of the pasta and added a nice little crunch.  Mmm!

This was fantastic. Very easy to make, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable because it's what I had. I also added a little parmeson with the gorgonzola. I doubled the recipe and 4 of us ate it all!

I made this tonight for dinner and it is SO good.  I wanted something light and fresh to go with our grilled chicken and this was perfect.  I followed the recipe except added feta instead of gorgonzola for personal tastes.  It would be outstanding with any of the two cheeses or blue cheese depending on what you like.  I added a pinch of fresh pepper and sea salt when I toasted the orzo.

What a nice surprise!  I made it as directed and it was wonderful!  My husband was a little less enthused, felt the cheese overpowered the other flavors.  Next time I will put the cheese on the side, and try some pine nuts on top.  thanks!

Enjoyed this recipe as it was my first experience with Orzo.  Nice and fresh tasting with the basil and tomatoes, will make again with a different cheese as the gorgonzola was a bit strong for my liking.  Thank you for sharing!

What a wonderful way to use both gorgonzola and basil (lots comes from one of those plants, doesn't it?)!  Very "gourmet" with little gourmet work!  :-)

Delicious! Love the bite of the cheese with the creaminess of the orzo.  I used chopped tomato and stirred it all together at the end.  The texture reminded me of a risotto and I didn't even try for that!  Hubby prefers feta (more mellow) so maybe next time I'll use half and half.

This was good.  I doubled the orzo part but forgot to double the rest, so it was a little bland.  My fault, not the recipe's.  :-)

Great thing to do with summer garden "stuff" . The cheese was important- it was the flavor it needed.

This was delish! I didn't have fresh basil so I used dried and I used chicken broth instead of veggie. We thought it was the perfect amount of gorgonzola cheese. This was even better the next day.

I salivate by just thinking of this dish! I am an avid gorgonzola fan, but I would say that if you or your family isn't then parmesan or mozzerella cheese are delicious too. I really loved the texure and flavor of the toasted orzo, and then putting fresh tomatoes, garlic and basil on it took it to a sensual level! ;)

Used feta since that was what I had. I browned the orzo for about 2 min. then added onion for another 2. Hubby LOVED it. We ate the whole batch. Great way to use a pile of fresh garden tomatoes.

This was delicious! I made it with parmesan instead of gorgonzola because we can't get gorgonzola in our small town grocery store. But it was yummy!

This was excellent, I really loved it! I made this today without planning ahead, so all I had was feta, which many commented on using, and that's all I had, but I loved it with feta!! All else the same - we all really liked it and we'll have it again!

This is a great recipe, but it needs some spicing up.  I used beef broth, doubled the garlic, and upped the amount of fresh basil.  Also, I used parmesan cheese.  I served it with chicken (grilled with spinach and mozzarella), and it was a huge hit.

I had some grape tomatoes to use up and so I did a search for "pasta and tomatoes", and this wonderful recipe was  amoungst my choices.  I must I chose well. This was delicious!!!!  Other than using chicken broth instead of veggie and using grape tomatoes instead of cherry tomatoes, made it as called for.  My husband and I ate all of it!!!!

Excellent recipe. Made this for Retreat, and had to make it a second time for "leftover Saturday". I like to let the tomatoes marinate while making the orzo.  Yummy! You won't be disappointed.

Very good.   I did add a bit more garlic along with the tomatoes and cheese.   Browning the orzo first  I found it was better to sauté the onions almost soft then added garlic and sauté a  short time then added my orzo.  This way the orzo did brown so much.

My husband and I enjoyed this dish. I did modify it by adding saute chicken with garlic salt. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth.  The gorgonzola worked well. I could definitely taste the basal.  I will definitely recommend this recipe and will make this again!

I liked it - followed nixter's review and added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the tomatoes/onion.  I soaked the chopped red onion in a small bowl of water while the orzo was cooking so it would take out some of the "bite".  Subbed feta for the gargonzola.

I thought it was fantastic and so did my dinner guests!  I can see that this is an incredibly versatile recipe-- next time I'll change it up a bit but I liked it just as is... and it used up a few ingredients I've had in my pantry for awhile.

I made this with Garlic Chicken from this site and a simple arugula and balsamic salad.  It tasted like it took me hours, but it was the fastest, easiest dinner!

I make this all the time - it is fantastic.  I use grape tomatoes instead of cherry, and feta instead of gorgonzola.  Sometimes I use fat free feta to lower the fat/calories, it still tastes great.

I made this recipe with the following changes: no onion, chicken broth instead of veg, feta instead of Gorgonzola and added cooked sliced chicken breast to orzo as it cooked. It got mixed reviews from the family. I mixed mine together and loved it, but I knew what to expect because I cooked it. The cheese started to melt and was gooey delicious. My oldest (17) ate it mixed together but I didnt get a comment, My 13yo son ate only the orzo chicken mixture as he doesn't like tomatoes and liked it (which is a relief or I would've been making a whole nother dinner) My 11yo daughter tried it but didn't care for the mixture so dumped it and ate the plain orzo/ckn like my son and ate the whole bowl. So, it worked out for the multiple different palettes in my household and I will probably make it again.

Made this tonight. Reduced oil to 1.5 tbsp, reduced onion to 1/2 onion. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable. I used 4 Roma tomatoes instead of the cherry tomatoes. I added 1 lb grilled chicken breasts, diced and 1 oz grated Parmesan cheese. Once the orzo was cooked, I added the diced chicken and the tomato mixture and topped with the Parmesan. I eliminated the gorgonzola. It was a big hit with my family!

This was SO good.  I made it as a side dish with grilled salmon and it made a perfect, quick summertime on the patio.  The only change I made is I warmed the tomato/olive oil/basil/garlic mixture over low heat - just because I love slightly cooked tomatoes!  I used a bit less gorgonzola just to make it healthier.  The cheese melted slightly and it had a great consistency and awesome flavor.  The leftovers tasted great cold too.  I will definitely be making again soon - THANK YOU!!
