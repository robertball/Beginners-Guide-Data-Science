This is a good recipe I changed just 3 things about it, first I put in two 29 oz cans of sweet potatoes, the first one I put in didnt look like it was going to be 2 1/2 cups.  and I used my electric mixer to make them lump free, then I used Dark brown suger instead of light, and for the topping I used walnuts in place of the almonds, I even added more cinnamon.  My family loved it, I will make this again.

I loved this recipe.  I used 1T allspice instead of the cinn and nutmeg + the ginger.  This is my new pot luck dish of choice!!

I've notice more sweet potato pie recipes where cinnamon is being used. I just want a SWEET POTATO PIE.

Made this for Thanksgiving and even my everyone loved including one person who said they wouldn't until after they took a bite! Excellent recipe for those who don't like it super sweet.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving.  It was delicious. There was a bit of a slip with it when my son dropped it upside down, luckily it fell mostly on the table :) So ended up looking really bad but everyone liked it :) I told everyone it was Upside down right side up sweet potato pie. :)
