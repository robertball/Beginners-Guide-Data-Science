We couldn't believe how much we love this stew! To save time and dishes,  instead of serving with mashed potatoes, rice or pasta I cubed 3 small potatoes and added them along with the other ingredients. I also omitted the butter and used spray olive oil to cut down on the fat grams. We will certainly enjoy this one pot meal time and again!

This was very tasty, although I wouldn't quite call it "stew".  It was more like soap loaded up with great ingredients.  This would go well over pasta, served up with some crusty Italian bread.  The taste was wonderful.   I *did* make a some changes; I used four cloves of garlic instead of two; sliced up a stalk of celery and used two carrots (not too thinly sliced, more like 1/2" or so) instead of one.  Another reason this didn't get a full five stars was prep/cook time.  It is one of my biggest peeves when checking out recipes.  IT took me longer, from start to finish, than the author's total time ~ about 45 minutes.  Not a big deal, but when you want to have dinner on the table at a certain time, it's kind of frustrating.  I will make this again and serve it over pasta next time!

It wasn't a bad recipe but i wouldnt call it a stew. The tomato base of this dish was way too much for my liking, and it took away the essence of the dish, which should be the chicken!

Everyone in my family loved this and went back for seconds, quite a rarity due the picky tendencies.  I put the zucchini in last and cooked just long enough to maintain the shape.  My family, does not like overcooked zucchini!

This was a fast and easy recipe with not a lot of clean up. My family enjoyed it very much! I changed it a little. I put frozen carrots and corn. 1 can of diced tomatoes with onions and garlic already in it. 1 can of regular diced tomatoes although I only used half the tomatoes from the second jar but all of the juice. I used garlic powder and cayenne pepper for seasoning. I let it simmer for about 15 min. and served over rice. Turned out very good. Thanks this will be used again!

We thought this was just O.K.  The diced tomato base was a bit much for my kids.  I had to add a cup of broth to thin it to a "stew" consistency.  It was quick and I might make it again in a pinch.

I wish I would have added some mushrooms and used fewer carrots, but you really can add whatever veggies you want.  We ate it over rice, which was perfect in my opinion.  QUICK AND EASY!

To thicken for "stew-like"quality,  mix 2 TBSP cornstarch into some reserved tomato juice and add to pan and continue cooking till gravy-like consistency.

Excellant recipe! I had bought an already roasted chicken and used that, adding cooked chicken after vegetables had cooked. I found that there was not enough liquid so I added 1 cup chicken broth and 1 Tbsp. concentrated tomato paste. My husband went back for seconds with no help at all!!! KEEPER!

This was quick and easy for sure.  I ended up using some small red potatos, carrots and onion instead of everything else and it turned out great.  I cooked it longer on order to allow the carrots and potatos to cook through.  I served with biscuits for a simple, week night dinner.

Definitely not a stew, but very good! I only gave it 4 stars because the recipe as written would have been a little bland for my taste. I doubled the basil and added an extra bayleaf. I also added oregano, thyme, black pepper, and garlic salt to taste. I topped it with Parmesan cheese (lots of it!) and served it over pasta. Even my husband liked it, and he normally doesn't like a lot of tomatoes or vegetables.

This was very good and a real guilt free meal too. So easy and a very tasty and comforting way to make chickem. My husband loves chicken so I am always searching. This was even better the next day too. The butter added ,though not much, really gave the stew a nice consistancy and did add to the flavor. Will be a keeper for sure. I am sure using any type of vegetables would be fine too.

All this recipe needs for those that have a problem with the "tomato" or "bland" taste is 1-2 teaspoons of "Kitchen Bouquet or Maggi" bottled sauce for that flavor you're looking for.  Try it, you'll like it.

Followed the recipe as posted. This is an excellent one dish meal. Next time I plan to try to find a substitute for the butter. My goal is to lower the fat content.

This stew is SO delicious (and quick... they weren't lying!)  It was flavorful and filling.   I followed the recipe, except I used 1.5 lbs of chicken and like 1/4 cup of chicken broth to make it more soupy.   Note: It was a little spicier than I had expected and, although I really enjoyed it, you may want to use the crushed pepper with caution because it has a nice kick to it!

Loved this but had to leave out the red pepper flakes because I served it to my kids.  I did use preseasoned diced tomatoes though.

This was pretty good. I used more garlic, less red pepper flakes and added a rib of celery. I was lucky and had time to chop all my veggies in the morning before work...I will make this again.

After making this for the very first time, it immediately became a top favorite.  The first time I made it though, I didn't pay attention that it calls for two cans of diced tomatoes, I only bought one can, but had chicken broth and a package of grape tomatoes, added 1/2 cup of broth and a handful of the grape tomatoes, it turned out fine.  With two cans of the tomatoes it is great too, I now make it both ways.  Serve it with cheesy garlic sourdough toast and spinach salad on the side.  I eat ALL of what I make of this, feeds me for at least 3 nights...thanks for a great recipe!!

Overall this dish was really good w/ some modifications. I wouldn't call it a stew though b/c it isn't broth based; its more like a one-dish meal served over rice. I like a lot of flavor so I added another clove of garlic, another bay leaf, and a bit more basil. I also added celery (as another user suggested) and it hit the spot. It was very filling (even for my hubby) and was fast and easy to prepare. Thanks for sharing :)

Yummy! I made some modifications based on others suggestions.  To reduce the cals I simmered the chicken with spray oil.  Also, I didn't have canned tomatoes so I used 1 fresh roma tomato and added 2 tbsp of tomato paste.  I also added celery as an added veggie to the zuchini, carrots, red bell peppers and onions and added some fat free chicken broth.  I omitted the red pepper flakes so that my 4 yr old could eat it (she loved it-btw!). To give it a spicy kick for me I added some hot Pace picante sauce to my bowl and it was great! 

It was quick and easy and I will definitely make again!

Awesome!  A little too "tomatoe-y" so I had to add some chicken stock to keep the chicken flavour, then thickened it with a slurry of flour and some cream. Also didn't have any zucchini but used up some mushrooms in the fridge.  Served with garlic bread - so good!

This is easy, really tasty and very healthy! I added yellow, summer squash for added color and served over rice.

this was delicious, I did make a few changes.  I cut down the tomatoes and added a can of chicken stock as some other reviews suggested. Also, after browning the chicken I removed from the pan and made a rue with the onions and garlic, this made the stew nice and thick.  I also added an assortment of bell peppers, mushrooms, cabbage and cilantro and some cumin.  The kids and hubby loved it.  Will definetly make again!

I made several changes, due to personal preference and what I had on hand.  It turned out different then the recipe intended, but it was SO good. Instead of cooking the chicken first, I cored and cut up 3 good sized tomatoes and half of a large onion, and let that simmer with a few dashes of olive oil, garlic powder, salt and pepper.  As that was cooking I started to get the chicken ready, but when I opened the package, it had a horrible smell, so I threw it out.  Luckily I had just bought sweet italian chicken sausage on a whim.  It was packaged hot dog style...meaning there was 9 big "weiners" rather then one large one.  I minced three of them, covered them and reserved them for later.  I diced a medium sized green pepper and threw that in.  Then I added just about half a teaspoon of evaporated cane juice, to lessen the acidity of the tomatoes.  I let the vegetables simmer with the top on for about an hour.  Then I diced about 8 very small yellow potatoes (I forget what they are called but they turn very soft and almost buttery when cooked, and they are very very small) and threw those in.  I then put in the reserved sausage.  At this point I added some water, as I had taken the top off for a little bit, and I wanted there to be a good amount of broth for the sausage to flavor and the potatoes to absorb.  Throughout the cooking time, I added salt, pepper and garlic powder as needed.  I ate it over brown rice, and it was amazing!  The leftovers were wonderful.

This was pretty good but not great.  I did use less tomatoes than they said and it was plenty.  I put it over couscous which was nice.  I might make it again as it was pretty easy and quick.

We made this tonight and we thoroughly enjoyed it. Made changes based on what we had at hand, but this is a very flexible and forgiving recipe.  The flavor was excellent today and will be better tomorrow.   Thanks for submitting, RAF1K123

I followed the recipe as it was but accidentally used 2 28oz cans of diced tomatoes.  It still came out terrific.  I served it in bowls over rice.  This is a keeper recipe!

I made mine with small potato cubes,onion, carrots, and celery. If you don't like things on the warmer side I suggest reducing the amount of crushed red pepper flakes. Also mine cooked pretty quickly and all of tomato juice may have been absorbed into the potatoes so I had to add a little bit of V8 juice put it still turned out really good:)I cooked my chicken in just enough olive oil so that it wouldn't stick to the pan.

I loved the aroma of this dish.  It was very good, and the seasonings were great.  I wouldn't call it a stew.  We served it over pasta, and I called it "chicken vegetable pasta."  It took me about 20 minutes to make - partly because I already had most of my vegetables chopped up.  When I know that I'm going to use a vegetable in another recipe later in the week, I just chop it up all at once at the beginning of the week.  The only thing that I would change is to add the zuchini a minute or two after adding the red peppers and carrots so that it doesn't turn out so much softer than the other vegetables.

This is good for healthy eating.

I used 2 medium tomatos instead of 2 can's and half a red bell pepper.  The final product didn't have as much juice as I thought.  

I added half a table spoon of sea salt.  The taste was pretty good, but a bit "blend", good for the occasion dish where you don't want the deep saltiness of eating out.  The veggie taste definitely makes up for the blendness.

Other stuff added were 4 bay leaves.  

I'm sure if having another 1/4 teaspoon salt would have made it better without being unhealthy.

I'm a slow preparer(40 min), it took me a whole hour from start to finish including pasta.

I could have probably left this recipe alone as it was (except for needing some extra liquid because the tomatoes I used didn't have very much juice) and it would have been fine, but I can't seem to bring myself to do that! ;-)  Here's what I did:  I added chicken broth until I liked the juiciness.  I added 1 tsp. of sugar, put in 1 tsp. of salt and 1 extra Tbsp. of butter.  I would have added Parmesiano Reggiano instead (and will next time) but I didn't have any, so I added some asiago cheese.  Also, I'm a pretty proficient cook, but I don't see how this gets on the table in half an hour unless you're a speed demon or you pre-cut the vegetables and don't cook them very much.  This took closer to an hour to get to the table.  My boyfriend and I both really enjoyed this with a crusty baguette and I had leftovers with some spiral noodles.

This dish was awesome!  Served it in bowls over rice. It took longer than 30 minutes to prepare.  If the word "Quick" was left out of the title I would have give it 5 stars!    Wife asked "...this must be a low calorie meal."  I replied "...it was until I added the butter!"  Don't dare leave it out.

This was a lot better than I thought it would be!! We served it over rice which I think is a must. I added half a green pepper and used diced tomatoes with jalapenos, but kept everything else as recipe states. Great, will make again!!!

This has quickly become a favourite in my family. The only changes I made were that I used 1 can of tomatoes instead of 2 and I substitued mushrooms for the zucchini. This was just a personal thing. My mother in law has made the recipe as it is written and raves about it also.

It was pretty good! It smelled great while cooking. It was pretty tomato-y, but that's how it's supposed to be, so it was good. We had it over rice. Will make again. I didn't have red pepper flakes this time, so I'll have to try it again with those.

Juicy, Tender and light tasting, not heavy, and so simple to prepare!  I used chicken thighs, and 1/2 can of 28 oz tomatoes, which I mashed a tiny bit, cause I didn't have diced tomatoes on hand.  I used 3 carrots, 1/2 zuccini and 1/2 large red pepper.  I browned the chicken first then added the onion and garlic, cooked for a few minutes before adding the tomatoes, veggies and spices, simmered for about 1/2 hour and served over rice...great chicken recipe!! thanks!

I made this tonight and both my husband and I loved it!  I had intended to put sauteed mushrooms in, but forgot.  I will put them in next time.  I also used seasoned diced tomatoes.  We put it over rice and it was delicious.  We are looking forward to the leftovers later this weekend.

This recipe is good.  All the other are right when they say its not a stew.  I too served it over pasta with some garlic bread.  If your taste buds are use to very flavorful food then this recipe might be a little to bland for you.  I used more basil and two bay leaves and also threw in some parmesean cheese.  It was good but it felt like it was missing something still (still a little bland).  My husband who is very pick thought it was ok but also thought it was bland.  I will most likely make this again but try added things until I find that missing ingredient.

So easy and yummy.  Great for a chilly evening when you want something warm and hearty. Both my husband and three year old twins love this recipe...and that ain't easy.  I serve over a mix of white and brown rice.  Can't go wrong with this one!

I can't really say anything bad about this recipe. It was really tasty and super healthy. It was also extremely easy!!! I didn't have diced tomatoes so I just used plum tomatoes that I chopped up myself. Yummm!

I thought this recipe was a bit boring and lacking flavor.  It could be canned tomatoes I used (my choice is a bit limited where I am living), but I would make some serious revisions if I was going to make this again.

Very good soup/stew. For a more soup-like texture, add chicken stock. I didn't use zucchini, used celery instead. Didn't have basil, so I used Italian Seasoning and I "marinated" the chicken with some chicken seasoning and a little bit of lemon juice to soften the meat before I cooked it. The chicken "marinated" overnight. I also used thigh meat instead of breasts, but it still tasted really great. Just the right amount of heat. It warms you on the way down, but not too spicy. Served over rice with some toasted bread to sop up the extra sauce :)

Wow! Quick and delicious!!!  The only change I made was that at high altitude, the ingredients need to stew about 20 minutes covered about 10 minutes.

This stew was wonderful. I made it a couple of weeks ago. Friends & family all loved it! It did take a little longer to cook than recipe states, but that's ok with me. Worth the wait...I did add a little pesto into the mix. That was the only thing I did differently.

I just made this stew and my picky boyfriend said it was delicious! Of course, I had to tweek it a little(and slightly overcooked the chicken, which I always seem to do. Chicken scares me.) I added about a cup of freshly grated Asiago cheese and it turned out great. I can't stay away from my cheese. Now, Can I get some crispy Italian bread?

Surprisingly yummy!  Way too much tomatoes though.  Skipped the zucchini and added a crooked neck squash instead.  Seems like a thick chunky sauce for noodles or rice.  Will definitely make again.  Thanks!

I made this last night and it was wonderful. It did take longer but it was well worth it.  I grated some Parmesan to a fine powder and added it to the stew and it helped cut down on the acid I also added some wine because there wasn't enough liquid.  Everyone loved it and I have fussy eaters.  I will definitely make again.

Great recipe but needed a lot more spice to make it interesting. Added potatoes and corn to thicken it up a bit so you don't need rice or pasta to make a meal. Will make again!

This was fantastic 'stew'. I had to add 2 cups of water to make it a stew though. Also, I used a can of Rotel (mild) instead of plain diced tomatoes which gave it more punch. I didn't measure out any of the seasonings, I never do. I always guesstimate. It took longer than 30 minutes! It took about an hour total. I cooked the chicken boobs first in a bit of olive oil & smothered them with chicken seasoning, then I threw in the entire chopped onion & the garlic. From there, I dumped it all into a stew pot & added the rest of the stuff. I used fresh ground pepper & I let it all simmer together for 35 minutes. I served it over brown rice. Yummy. I'll be making this again! We all loved it.

Very tasty.  I used 50% thigh meat and 50% breast meat because I like dark meat.  I left out the butter since I think the olive oil gives the stew/soup a nice rich flavor on its own.  Finally, I only used one can of tomatoes and thinned it out with chicken broth.  This is a very mild dish, but if you love chicken and fresh vegetables, it is great!

The cook time for this is totally understated.  I had to pull the chicken and zucchini out waiting for the carrots to fully cook.  The flavor was really flat and I followed the recipe exactly.  What a disappointment.

Tasty chicken stew. I just made it slightly different. First thing in pan was caramelized onion. For me, it's better like that

Tasty & easy. Instead of carrots, I had a sweet potato I cubed and threw into the pot. Also, as another reviewer suggested, I added the zucchini near the end. It is not a "stew" as I (and many others) think of a stew, but it was a tasty and easy meal to put together.

I LOVE this recipe. I did make a few changes. I used 1 can of diced tomatoes and substitute the other can with 1 can of chicken broth. I used squash instead of zucchini and sprinkled some parmasan cheese at the end and served over rice. My whole family loves it. This is in my montly rotation.

Unfortunately, for me, this recipe was lacking one important thing: taste.
