I did the same thing another reviewer suggested because I was short on time. I toasted the bread ahead of time, then spread the mixture on the toast before my company came.  Delicious and what a nice change for an appetizer.

Excellent! Just watch them so they don't get too brown...the broil and bake times in the recipe were a little too long for my oven!

Very popular at my Christmas Eve buffet! Yummy flavor and nice, creamy consistency. I think I used Italian bread because that's what I had. But it tastes good on any bread, as I've been eating the leftover topping the next day!

Fattening but fabulous!  I suppose you could use lite mayo, but I hate the taste of it.  I served these to my Bible study group, and it created a feeding frenzy. The men climbed over each other to get to the second batch as they came out of the broiler!

I am the poster of this recipe.  Over the past Holiday season I made many of these, and had fun garnishing them to make a little more festive.... I topped them with Roasted red pepper strips; Kalamata olives, sun dried tomatoes, Small dollops of sun dreid tomato pesto, and dollops of fig jam with a smoked almond.  These went over really well.  One of my mainstay recipes, and very easy to adapt it or dress it up.  Glad others like it!

My friend Jennifer and I made this for ourselves! It was DELICIOUS!!! We will definitly be preparing this at our next get-together! YUM YUM TASTY!

We did make a couple alterations to the recipe. We added ROMA TOMATOES to it, ((Jennifer's idea)) as well as EXTRA cheese! ((MY IDEA))

Try this next time with the tomatoes, you will be pleasently surprised!

Using homemade crostini already on hand made these incredibly easy and fast. I omitted the garlic since it was already in the pesto and added seeded and finely chopped Roma tomatoes and a sprinkling of shredded mozzarella.  Excellent.

I made these as appetizers for Christmas Day, it has become something of a tradition for me to make something for the first time and try it out on everyone on each major holiday. Needless to say these were a hit, and I am making them for New Year's Eve as well.

Absolutely delicious.  Made this recipe for a birthday party last night and I got rave reviews from everyone.  I followed the recipe to a "T" with the exception of baking it in a 425 degree oven for 8 mins.  I did not have to broil them, as they were golden brown - YUM....

Oooooh this is so good.  For you first time cooks, you can buy a small jar of basil pesto in most grocery stores usually next to the olives, etc.

This recipe is wonderful! If you like pesto and garlic you'll love this.  Every time I make it the recipe is requested. I do not toast both sides. I spread on the bread and broil it from there.  It's less time consuming.  I also use shredded Asiago cheese in lieu of Parmesan.

This recipe was so easy and wonderful!! I took the appetizer to a party and everyone was asking for the recipe.  It was really nice to be able to make a quick appetizer without a lot of ingredients and the best part was when someone asked for the recipe I was able to give it to them right then.  Wonderful recipe.  Try it!!

Delicious!  This recipe was exactly what I was hoping it would be!  I followed the recipe for the topping - didn't change a thing and it was so yummy.  For the bread I took a loaf of French bread and cut it in half lengthwise.  I broiled that for 5 minutes so it was just a little toasted.  Then I spread the topping on top and broiled it again until it was nice and bubbly.  I let it cool for a few minutes and then cut it into slices.  Perfect!  Will definitely be making this again.

Fabulous!  I took them to a barbecue/picnic at the park and prepared them in a stovetop oven.  I couldn't make them fast enough for our group, very well received!  Thanks for a great recipe, I will make these tasty nibbles often!

This recipe gets full points for its ease of preparation and the short time it takes to whip up using ingredients I always have on hand. I served it as an appetizer to Easter dinner and they were gobbled up quickly by my guests - everyone commented on how good they were. I followed the recipe exactly and toasted the bread rounds before hand to reduce the amount of prep time.

This is always a favorite.  For an twist on the original, try adding thinly sliced tomato on top - trust me!   I agree about watching carefully.

Wow! This is amazing and was GONE in no time flat! I cooked it for 5 minutes @ 350 and then put shredded mozzarella on top and baked for 3 more minutes.  It's delicious!

WOW!  These were the easiest, most delicious appetizers that I have ever made.  I followed the recipe exactly and they came out PERFECT!  The only suggestion that I have to anyone that wants to try this recipe is to make sure that you have enough ingredients on hand to make another batch as they will be gone in minutes!  :-)

Made this for a Christmas party.  I prepared the dip the day before - then right before the party I put it on the bread and baked.  IT WAS FANTASTIC!  I did add a bit more garlic than the recipe called for and omitted the salt.

Taste was fine, good flavor profile, but it did not work well set out at a party as suggested.  Once they were cold, they were ignored.  Would be good at a meal on soft french bread though.

FABULOUS flavor & super easy to make! I made this for a party with around 40 guests so  I doubled the recipe but only "baked off" as needed. I didn't have to worry about checking if the pan was empty.  It was brought to me by a guest "Deb, I have something for you".  I looked & it as the empty serving tray - awaiting a refill.  The only thing I had at the end of the night was several requests for the recipe.  Like others, I toasted the bread and mixed the topping earlier in the day so that all I had to do to serve was spread the pesto mixture on the rounds, heat and serve. This will definately be on my appetizer menu from now on!

I made this using the recipe on this site: Easy Pesto by Rebecca James Thompson, which uses almonds instead of pine nuts.  This is very yummy, but very rich.  Which can be good as it keeps people from eating too many at a party.  I think I prefer bruschetta, but I may make this again.  I burned the first bread, so watch out!  The second bread I purchased a par baked loaf and that worked great!  I also ended up not making it when I planned and it stored in the fridge mixed up (not on bread) great, so you can make it a couple of days before a party and just do the bread part day of.  I also had leftovers which worked well in pasta.

Absolutely delicious and so simple!  I used my own pesto, and omitted the garlic - still more than flavorful enough for my guests, who all asked for the recipe.  Thanks so much for this one!

Good flavor.  Mine turned out very green, not the mellow, golden cheesy color of the picture.

One of my favorite go to recipes.  I don't add salt but do follow the direction other than the salf.  I found this on the site years ago and was just pondering what to make for an appetizer tonight - these popped into my head!  Delicious - thank you!

This appetizer was a huge hit!  It was the first appetizer to go.  Everyone was raving about how delicious they were.  The only thing I didn't do was toast the one side first.  I followed the rest of the directions and put them in the oven for ~10 minutes and the bottoms ended up getting lightly toasted.  Will definitely make again!

I love pesto!!  This recipe was super easy to make and tastes amazing.  I followed the recipe exactly, didn't change a thing and am completely satisfied.  If you are having people over I suggest you make this.  It'll be a hit for any pesto lover.

I have made these a few different times and each time they are enjoyed by all. Last week I served these at a cocktail party. People were eating them as soon as I put them on a platter. No leftovers (and I had lots to choose from)!

This was delicious and there weren't any leftovers - but BE CAREFUL!!  I had the bread in for 3 minutes and smoke started pouring out of the oven.  Don't use the broiler setting to toast the bread, just set it to about 375.

Made the rounds for a party last night—big hit! One guy went back for some more over and over, saying he just couldn't get enough of them. I didn't have time to toast the bread beforehand and this might have made the rounds a bit chewier than they were supposed to be. So don't skip the toasting!

Awesome!  Everyone loved these.  A new staple for when I entertain.  I only toast them after i put the pesto mixture so that they are not super crispy.

I needed a quick and easy recipe for a family dinner and I was a little skeptic thinking this is way too easy it can't taste THAT good.  I was wrong.  My family loved it and we ended up eating every last one even though I made enough to feed an army.  I brushed the baguette with EVOO before first broiling the rounds.  After cooking for the 6 minutes I also added mozzarella to the tops and broiled one last time.  This made it so tasty.  I also added sun dried tomato strips and sliced grape tomatoes in a bowl on the side to top as we ate.

I would have given 5 stars, but the broiler time needs to be closer to 2-3 minutes, not 5-8. I happened to check the bread at 3 minutes, and it was already starting to burn. Otherwise, great recipe. I put a sliced roma tomato on part of them, and it was delicious. I will add it to the mix next time.

OMG!!!! SOOO good! I didn't have any basil pesto on hand, just sun dried tomatoe pesto, so I used that instead. It was one of the simplest things to make, and right up there with the tastiest. The only thing is, I would probably add a little more garlic next time, just cuz were garlic freaks in our family! Next time I have an appie night, I'll deffinetly be making this!

Sher, this was so darn good. I didn't measure the mayo and I probably used more pesto than mayo. In any case, this was an experiment that paid off nicely because I'm definitely going to serve this as an appetizer on Easter. Thanks so much!!

We liked this one. I didn't have any baguette on hand, so I used ready to heat garlic bread (New York Texas Toast) and skipped the garlic cloves. I toasted the bread on both sides, then spread the pesto on top and put it back in the oven for a few minutes until the pesto was warm. I cut the pieces in half and they were just right for one serving. It was great. Next time I will 
use the suggested sun-dried tomato pesto. Great tasty and easy appetizer.

This appetizer was a smash at a recent St. Patrick's Day party-- the whole lot were gone by the time they cooled down. Keep this one in mind as a great side to spaghetti or your favorite pasta dish. Lots of flavor and easy to make!

Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this. I made it for a potluck, and most people pushed it aside after the first few bites. The mayonaise taste is just too overpowering. I tried it with bruchetta, however, and it was pretty good. In my opinion, this recipe is just too rich to stand alone.

Very good! Some of my friends liked them better without the second time in the oven (that is: the bread toasted but not with the basil mixture), other friends liked it just as the recipe said. Also used the basil mixture as a dip. Than you!

What a great appetizer or bread idea.  I fixed these for guests along with a ziti dish from this site and a simple salad.  Compliments all around.

Words are not adequate to describe how incredibly delicious these rounds are.  Mercy!! Five stars are not nearly enough and the recipe is quick and simple. I think I'll go eat another...

I loved this easy recipe and LOVED the taste!  I took it to two holiday parties and it was a huge hit all around!  I did not toast the bread ahead of time because I forgot that step. One jar of pesto went far, so it's also very affordable.

I put this on leftover pita bread instead, and then cut it into wedges to go with pasta. A nice change of pace from garlic bread!

Don't bother toasting first if you skip to spreading your bread rounds and broiling them for 3 minutes, check carefully. Turn off the broiler.  If they are bubbling, then, turn off the broiler and adjust the cookie sheet to the lower rack. Leave in oven for no longer than 3-5 minutes.  You will have the same results as pre-toasting the rounds.

Addictive!  Like many other reviewers, I used the "Easy Pesto" recipe from this website which includes quite a bit of garlic so I omitted the garlic.  I also used lite mayo. Such a simple recipe with so much taste!  It's so easy to prepare ahead--toast the slices the day before and mix the topping together and store overnight.  Makes a quick appetizer while you prepare dinner.

These were really good. I did not add salt (the parmesan is salty enough) and I did not add garlic since my pesto already had plenty of garlic.  Quick and easy recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe is a staple at any party I cater.  Simple and easy.  I make my own pesto, but I'm sure that store bought would also work just fine.  Great side dish to almost anything on the menu.

Well, even though I read the reviews, I wasn't sure about this recipe, until I popped the finished product in my mouth.  Can we say, "DIED AND WENT TO HEAVEN!!" My husband wanted me to make more so he could take some to work for his co-workers!  We'll definitely be doing this one again.
*****
4/10 - Came back to this recipes again for a Bunco party and on a whim set out some sun-dried tomatoes to put on top.  They are even better this way!!!  I put the leftover tomatoes on a pizza I made and it was fabuous!

I made this with both the sundried tomato and artichoke pesto as well!  Very delicious, the only I had to switch out is the baguette.  I used a regular loaf of French bread as the baguetter was already hard and for fear of someone's tooth breaking, I scrapped it.  The french bread was perfect for the job!

I made these for a weeknight dinner alongside of a cod fillet I was broiling. They were tasty and super easy. I think as an appetizer they're not going to wow anybody, but as an alternative to garlic French bread with dinner they were awesome.

This was spectacular.  Had left over French bread and all these ingredients on hand. It was a little something special at Easter dinner. The bread Browns way quicker under my broiler, about 3 minutes. Enjoy.

I didn't use baguettes for this, as I had an assortment of leftover breads, so I just used that.  Still it worked very well--I just didn't toast them, as it was mostly sandwich breads.  I don't have basil pesto so I used sun dried tomato pesto as the recipe submitter suggested.  very good and very easy.  Went well with the soup we had for lunch.  thanks for the recipe.

I made this with store bought pesto that already had garlic in it.  It was excellent.  I followed the directions exactly except I didn't add the garlic.  It turned out great and disappeared very quickly.  I will definitely make again.
