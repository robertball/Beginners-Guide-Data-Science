Unless the recipes is seriously altered, it is not worth the expensive ingredients.  There is not enough liquid in the batter to be a cake; I scooped rather than poured it into the cups.  I ended up with dry biscuits with little lemon taste.  The meager cream cream cheese was good but could also have use more flavor.

I just made these and thought they came out fantastic!  of course, anytime I use lemon juice and zest, I get a little bit over-zealous, because I love the fresh lemon flavor.  The cupcakes taste great as they came out of the oven, but I am going to add an American buttercream and a candied lemon slice garnish before I serve them.

Too many eggs.  You shouldn't be able to taste the eggs.  I'm guessing 4 eggs should have been the max.

I'm not sure what the others were saying about being too dry of a recipe. I will say, my 1/4 cup of lemon juice was almost a 1/3 cup cause the two lemons I had were JUICY! So, I just put it all in the batter. I had to "scoop" the batter also but that allowed me get good portions to surround the filling. Only thing I would add is make some candied lemon peel for a garnish & I balanced the lemon with a basic vanilla buttercream. Kind of reminded me of a lemonhead candy ...maybe I'll garnish with that candy next time.

I used store bought frosting, which was great, but I found that the lemon taste of the actual cupcake was too light. Next time, I will add more lemon juice and more lemon zest. Everyone else enjoyed them, though.
