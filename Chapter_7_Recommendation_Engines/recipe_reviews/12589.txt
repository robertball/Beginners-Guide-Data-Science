I made this pie last night, it was absolutely delicious. This pie was easy to make, I followed the recipe very closely, except I added a little bit of melted butter to the mixture and cooked each pie for about 55-60 mins each at 350. I also added a foil ring to the crust so it didn't get too brown. I highly recommend this recipe to other egg pie lovers, it's so very tasty and doesn't have that "too much egg" taste like others.

I put this in a small rectangular casserole dish because I didn't have a water bath pan that would fit a 9" pie plate.  Otherwise, the only change I made was to add a little cinnamon and nutmeg.  I don't know what I did wrong; but it did not set up and was almost entirely liquid under the hardened top.

a fool proof Egg Custard Pie! I am a novice in the kitchen but this pie was a hit in my family. For some who thinks it's too sweet .... just lessen the sugar! I used only 1 1/4 c and it turned out great. TWO TWISTS i made with the recipe..1) used halfevap milk and half reg milk ( i had some left over that's why) 2) added fresh corn kernels ( yup! FRESH) ...and it still turned out WODERFUL!!

Giving this 3 stars, there is some difficulty setting the 9" pie pan in another baking dish with water.  I did not have one that was wider than 9" so there were some issues in technicality with this recipe for me.  Some water did seep into the pie pan trying to balance it in.  And the lowest layer came out harder than the rest.  However the top layer did taste fairly good. I would definitely have to go buy a new baking dish for the water bath to even begin to think about trying this again.

This is now my go to recipe for a quick, easy desert! I added a cup of coconut to the recipe and it was great that way too. One of the best thing about this recipe is that it makes its' own crust and it actually is a pretty good one. Last but not least the men in the house loved it LOL!!!  PS I made it again today but instead of 2 tsp of vanilla I added 2 tsp of rum extract, verrrry nice!

Only change I made was to add nutmeg to the top. Made it exactly as per the recipe and it was great. Grandkids love it as well. Made it for the crew in the oil patch and they either loved it or wouldn't try it. That's ok, more for me. It is requested about once a week by those that tried it . That's a pretty good indication that they liked it. It's easy to fix.

I'm the only person in my family that likes egg custard pie. I'm also allergic to wheat and gluten. I swapped the flour for gluten free flour and used gluten free vanilla and it was Great! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

This pie is excellent. The only change I made is that I added some cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, as I like a more spicy custard. I used a 10" pie plate and cooked the pie in a water bath for exactly 45 minutes. The pie rose nicely, filling the pan, and it cooked perfectly, not runny at all but nice and firm. Best of all, it is absolutely delicious, light and tasty. Will definitely use the recipe again!

Soo good and I am from Mississippi!  I made it just like the recipe but I had to cook it a good hour. Maybe my hot water bath was not hot enough.  I will be making this again!

Pros: easy to make, doesn't use any ingredients that aren't normally in my house, nice flavor.  Cons: As others have mentioned, it is *very* sweet,  and the crust came out thin, soggy, and badly in need of a little salt & a leavening agent. 
 That being said, I was only going to give this three stars but figured any dessert that has me go back for seconds deserves an extra one.

I used 1/2 cup less sugar and added nutmeg on top based on reviews, and baked in a square pan because it was easier to put in a water bath. I think it would have been better in a pie dish, in terms of appearance. But overall this is a decent recipe. A smooth, tasty custard with a hint of spice on top. Thanks :)
