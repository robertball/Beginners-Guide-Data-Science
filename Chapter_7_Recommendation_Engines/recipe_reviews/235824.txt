This candy tastes like caramel corn without the popped corn! Next time, I will put almond pieces over the top for decoration.  I love the taste of this!

Made with my son for a school project.  The candy taste was excellent.  However, we had to make an adjustment to how we cooled the candy.  Had to leave the pot on stove, low heat, to keep candy warm while spooning otherwise it cools too quickly and you can't get it out.  While I spooned it out, my son kept mixing so it would not burn.  We also used mini muffin pans to cool candy.  Our first try was to use paper mini muffin cups but the candy stuck to the cups and we could not get candy separated from the cup when it cooled.   Next time we make this, we will try a pot that allows you to pour out the candy.  Maybe that will make it easier to get it out of the pot.  Spooning it out was a project because it kept sticking to the spoon and knife.  Clean up was easy though.  I soaked everything in hot water and the sticky candy mostly melted off.

This came in a newsletter under the subtitle of "low calorie" - really? Something with molasses, cream and white sugar? Who reviews these?
