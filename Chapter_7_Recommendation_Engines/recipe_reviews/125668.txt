I'm with ya kimberlyann! I love dipping crm cheese poppers in this (got hooked due to Arbys, lol). I make large batch of poppers (jalapeno poppers II recipe) to freeze. So, I make larger batch of this, portion out in small containers and freeze also. When I need my popper fix, I have this ready to use too! I don't bother with fresh jalapeno, just add chipotle chilis and some of the adobo to my liking. I also use seedless, low sugar raspberry jam. I do add a bit of crushed garlic, a splash of white balsamic vinegar and sea salt. I'll have to try it out with chicken wings. This would be a great glaze on roast pork, over a brick of crm cheese w/crackers or well...lots of applications. Easy to make, I love it.

This is great! Really good with jalapeno poppers! Think of the stuff Arby's gives you with jalapeno poppers except better! Thanks so much!

This is a good sauce and taste just like the expensive bottled sauce. I do recommend getting the best quality raspberry preserve. I have done it with the cheap stuff and the flavor just isn't the same.

This is a very good recipe.  I did end up having to double the chipotle chile and the adobo sauce in order to get any heat at all.  I also strained out the seeds from the preserves.  It is so easy to throw together.  I've saved it my recipe box so I can make it again.

This is great with Southwestern Egg rolls from this site. There is a local restaurant that paired the 2 together & we loved it! I suggest if you can't find seedless raspberry preserves, take the time & run it through a mesh strainer.

To make this even easier,  simply buy a small can of chipotles in adobo sauce in the grocery store and use the whole thing.   I added an identical amount of raspberry jam to it and one jalapeno.  It all went in the food processor and in a grand total of one minute, this recipe is ready and great for dipping not just wings, but meatballs, nuggets, etc!

my household has fallen in love with Raspberry chipotle dip from Sam's club and have been looking for a base recipe to make a homemade version.  This dip was the base we needed!  On its own it is very tasty, however we like extra spice so ended up adding the whole can of chipotle peppers and sauce.  it was delicious on chicken wings as recommended.   we then added half of the sauce to a block of cream cheese to use as a chip dip and it was just what we were looking for.  thanks for the wonderful multi use recipe!

Great balance of flavors. Perfect on cream cheese and multi-grain crackers. I'm so glad I made a double batch. This is so easy to make; no more having to search the stores for raspberry chipotle sauce.

I served this with hot wings at a birthday party. My son loved it, but it was not a crowd pleaser in general.   It was a bit too hot for me.  I might try it again with less jalape√±o, and perhaps cut the jam in half, but add fresh pureed raspberries in the place of the reduced jam to produce a sauce that is a bit less sweet.  Very interesting though.  I recommend others give it a try.
