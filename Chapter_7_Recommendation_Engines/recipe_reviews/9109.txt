I am not a big fan of celery in "fruity" things so I replaced it with a chopped Granny Smith apple. I also did not grind the entire orange, I grated off the orange-only of the peel for the salad, then removed the bitter white rind before chopping up the fruit in the blender. The flavor definitely improves the next day, so make it the day before you need it.

This is a great recipe!!!  I only made a few slight changes....I used sugar free jello, cooked the cranberries and used pecans rather than walnuts, hubby can't eat walnuts!  Thanks for posting such a great recipe!!

I toasted the walnuts and reduced the sugar. This was a delicious addition to holiday dinner.

This was very good, and my family enjoyed it with Christmas dinner.  I used Sugar Free Cranberry Jello, and didn't add additional sugar--I'd make it again with these same modifications.

It was a very good recipe, but I cooked a bit longer and then added diced kumquats (skin and all) for an interesting twist.  

Make certain to drain the pineapple THOROUGHLY or the dish will look like soup.

I make this every Thanksgiving because my family asks for it.  It's really delicious (with or without the celery).  I DO use much less sugar (about half the recipe) because the jello adds enough for our taste.
