I believe that this recipe is incorrect as written, with the water and rice quantities reversed -- it should be 1 cup wild rice and 2-1/2 cups water. There isn't anywhere close to enough liquid in this recipe to properly cook 2-1/2 cups of wild rice and also moisten all of that bread.

With that change, this is a 5 star recipe, and I don't normally even like stuffing.

Some other minor modications that I make:

I cook the rice in the chicken broth plus 1 cup of water (don't drain any excess after cooking the rice), then add the rest of the water at the end. That seasons the rice more effectively.

I also reduce the salt and pepper slightly, 1-1/2 tsp salt and 1 tsp pepper, and use low sodium chicken broth. I love salt (my wife thinks I use too much), but this recipe is just a bit too heavy on salt without those changes.

I also simplify some of the quantities to 2 medium onions, 4 large stalks celery, 8 oz mushrooms, and 12 slices of bread. The result is about the same as the quantities (in cups) shown, but I think this makes shopping and prep easier.

When combining the final mixture, add additional water (up to about 2 more cups) until the mixture is well moistened but there is no standing liquid.

Great dressing, however, there was one made by S&W Foods on the Brown Rice they used to sell.  On this one, get rid of the whole wheat bread and use 3 cups brown rice (uncooked), no mushroomes, no raisins, Saute the celery & onions in a large stock pot, using enought water/chickent broth to cook this much rice, add sausage, seasonings, apples (finely chopped) to rice mixture and mix well.  You can serve on the side without the mess of stuffing the birds, and just keep warm in a casserole dish to serve buffet style.  Expect it to go fast.

This is really great for stuffing squash or small pumpkins. A nice range of flavors and very easy to add or take away some items if you would like. A very nice and versatile recipe. Easy to make ahead.

L-O-V-E this recipe! I generally dont like stuffing and since this was my first Thanksgiving as the cook I decided to try a new stuffing recipe and this was a winner!! Everyone raved about it.  I skipped the celery because I cant stand celery and instead of raisins I used craisins which made it all the better! Also, I didn't peal the apples which added a beautiful color to the dish.

LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this recipe.  I made it on Christmas Day and it was a huge hit with my family.  After reading other reviews, the only change I made was with the water/rice which did seem to be switched as originally written.  Other than that, no changes.  It was fabulous!!  Will definitely make again.

I'm glad that I read the reviews on this first, although I knew something was amiss with the water/rice proportions.  I did use chicken broth to cook my rice in, and I did reverse the rice and liquid measurements.  I used Johnsonville's All Natural Ground Mild Sausage which was perfect with this.  Otherwise, I followed the directions as given.  This makes a really good side dish year round when you are having roast chicken or the half breast turkey that we have so often.  Thanks for a wonderful dish.  I wish they would fix the recipe so that others would know about the error!  Thanks, Christy!

Wait-how can you have one cup of water to 2 1/2 cups rice? Are the proportions mixed up? It is usually one cup of wild rice to 3 cups of water. This will burn up in 5 minutes.

This recipe is great! When you make your rice, just follow the recipe on your rice package. Set the rice aside and continue making the recipe. The recipe make plenty. You donâ€™t need to double it.

I did make some changes. Rather than wild rice (which I really love), I reverted to my mother's use of Mrs. Cubbison's Seasoned Traditional stuffing.  Being on a tight budget, I also had some chicken breasts in Swanson's chicken broth.  I cut 1-1/2  half chicken breasts into bite-size portions and added them to the dressing when it was done (using all of this recipes seasoning suggestions.  Mashed some potatoes and made gravy.  It was my "Thanksgiving Casserole for One" and delicious!  Thanks.

I did not drain the liquid after cooking sausages and reduced the amount of liquid added at end. I also replaced raisins with dried cranberries that I had soaked to not be too dry.

Very good! Husband vetoed the apples and raisins, but the rest was awesome. I did use sage sausage. My 12 month old and 4 year old gobbled it down, and the other guests raved.

This was a great Thanksgiving recipe. I just couldn't do the apples/raisins, and followed the specs of Uncle Ben's wild rice, but spicy sausage gave the stuffing a nice, surprising kick. Anyhow, thanks for the inspiration!

I made it except for doing 1 cup of rice to 2.5 cups of water. Neither I nor my family cared for it. It was very bland and the flavors didn't seem to mesh for me.

I am not really a stuffing fan, but this was delicious. I'm pretty sure the rice to water ratio is incorrect, you need more water. This recipe will definitely make more appearances.

I have  made a variation of this recipe for several years.  This is a great combination of flavours.  I do prefer cranberries to raisins as they add  a nice contrast of flavour.  Don't be shy with the apples either,  the fruit adds is really nice taste to the palette.

this is awesome. got lots of compliments from the family. also, the quantities are pretty flexible so if you go short or heavy on any of the ingredients it still turns out well. I went heavy on the fruit.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe!!!  Being from Michigan I used dried cherries instead of raisins and I have also used cranberries. I have used both turkey or veggie (no water) broth depending, on who is dining at my house, or what I am serving it with...I only have ever had one complaint and their favorite stuffing comes in a box...enough said!!!

I usually don't like stuffing, but this had me coming back for seconds. Even hubs said it was right up there with his mom's!
