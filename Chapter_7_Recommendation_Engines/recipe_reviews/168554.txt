This was awesome!!  Perfect mix of salty and sweetness.  Yum!  Didnt do the pine nuts and used white wine vinegar because I couldn't find the kind they called for.  Was great the way I made it though!!

This salad is amazing!  By accident I used equal parts champagne vinegar and olive oil and it still tasted fantastic.  The flavors explode in your mouth - delish!

This salad was very delicious!  I added some balls of cantaloupe which were great.  Very refreshing salad.
