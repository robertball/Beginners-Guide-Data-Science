I couldn't get my pancake to stay together. It seemed like too much in the pan at once. The flavor was lacking. I think it is a good start to a reicpe but needs some work.

This recipe had a good flavor and I liked that it didn't have a ton of ingredients. I am not a patient person so cooking this as individual pancakes drove me nuts. The second time I made it I used a oven proof skillet (mine is enamel coated cast iron) and cooked everything up like a fritata.  I precooked the vegetables in the pan, then added the meat. Put enough eggs over this to cover the meat and vegetables and allowed it to cook on the stove until eggs were half way set. I then finished it up in a 350 degree oven until top was golden brown.  To eat just cut a slice (like  you would a pie) cover with the gravy and you have something that tastes the same and I think it's easier to make.
