I tried this recipe because I was out of OJ for traditional blueberry sauce. I did add a teaspoon of orange extract with the water. The sauce ended up very thin so I added in two teaspoons of corn starch. This thickened it up nicely. Sprinkled some nutmeg on and it was ready to go. So good that I will use this as my go to blueberry sauce recipe.

This is a good base recipe to help you figure out what you like. I find that this recipe is too sweet with not enough blueberries; I also find that it is a bit thin. Below is how I I have changed it to make it less sweet and thicker. With the addition of mixing the water and corn starch first, the directions are still the same. 

1/2c water
1/2 T corn starch 
1/4 c packed brown sugar
1c frozen blueberries
1t vanilla extract
1t almod extract

I cut the water back by a teaspoon and added in a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. My sauce was a little runny, next time I would cut the water back a little for a thicker sauce. I made this to go over a copycat recipe of Denny's french toast--the kids are still talking about it.

Soo yummy. I poured it over waffles for my family, and every last plate was licked clean. It was very sweet, which was NOT a problem for me. Others might want to add a pinch of salt to counteract the sweetness.

I read the reviews about it being too thin, so I made some changes as I wanted a syrup-y consistency for on top of our breakfast pancakes. I kept the1/2 c. water, 1/2 c. sugar for a simple syrup. I added 2.5 c. fresh blueberries and 1 T. cornstarch and let it simmer for at least 15 minutes while making the pancakes to boil it down and get it to the consistency I was looking for. Doing it this way, I would rate it 5 stars, but I averaged between the original recipe, which would be 3 stars and this version.

Quite good and super simple. I was looking for a recipe that didn't have OJ or zest because I didn't have any around, but this was delicious. I thought I was going to have to strain it, but it it didn't need it - the skins were totally unnoticeable.  Only used 1 tablespoon of sugar and it was already really sweet. I'll probably use half a tablespoon next time and add to taste. I can see a little bit of vanilla and cinnamon being nice but this is simple, true and delicious.

This is wonderful on cottage cheese pancakes.  I did add some orange zest as suggested by others.

I made it today. It tasted good but was runnier than syrup should be. Anyone have any tips?

A good idea, but too thin and too sweet, so I cut back on the water and sugar (and used raw sugar instead of white). Then I added 3/4 t of corn starch, some cinnamon, 1/4 t vanilla and a little bit of crushed lavender. Next time I may add some other types of berries and replace some of the sugar with a delicate honey.

The sauce was a little too runny for me. I read some other reviews and put in some cornstarch like they suggested but it just clumped up. Overall this recipe wasn't as good as I had hoped.

Great base recipe!! I had no white sugar so I substituted brown sugar, used frozen blueberries and followed the advice of other reviewers and added 3/4 tsp cornstarch to help thicken it up. It turned out SOOO good and was super quick and easy!! We used it to top standard bisquick biscuits, a sweet version of biscuits and gravy. Yum!

It is hard to get a recipe exactly the way you like it but you can tweak it and not change it drastically! I think you can use 1/4 to 1/2 cup of sugar depending on the sweetness you like. I used fresh berries and years ago I knew a woman who sold a local jelly/jam/preserve product that was blueberry cinnamon Preserves. I added lemon extract to taste and cinnamon to taste because that is the way we like it at our house. The basic recipe is so simple, I have found many and they require 6-8 ingredients. I like quick and simple and this is! Thank you for sharing it. It was wonderful with homemade Belgian waffles.

This was super quick and easy. I followed others advice and added a little cornstarch but cut the sugar in half. If not for that it would be five stars! We made it as a topping for pancakes but it would be amazing over ice cream as well!

Based on other reviews I added about a teaspoon of cornstarch.  Delicious!  This is going in the recipe box.
