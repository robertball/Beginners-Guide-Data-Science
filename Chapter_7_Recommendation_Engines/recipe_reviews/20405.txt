yum! I stole another reviewer's idea and used Izze brand grapefruit soda instead of grapefruit juice. I like it because it's strong but sweet enough that you taste more than just the alcohol. it has a really good layered sort of taste -- the bitterness of the gin is sandwiched between the tartness of the pineapple/grapefruit and the thick sweetness of the honey. one addition to the process: chill for a few hours and serve over ice.

Made this last night. Tasted great, but after a few glasses it seemed a little acidic. (maybe use a juice drink instead of juice?) Also, I added an additional cup of gin. Still tasted wonderful and had more of the kick i expect.

Yummy!  Added more gin as the other reviewer did.  Next time I'll add something fizzy, perhaps grapefruit flavored soda.  Thanks for a fun new recipe - anything to get my honey quotient in!!

After reading the other reviews, we tweaked ours with 50/50 soda instead of the grapefruit juice. And of course we added the extra booze. but an excellent summer cocktail

I changed it up a little by using canned pineapple (you could use fresh) & using the food processor (or blender), I pureed the pineapple then put it into a large freezer baggie & allowed it to freeze but not all the way, only until it was an extremely  thick slush. Then it went into the blender w/honey, a little fresh nutmeg and the gin...a nice fruit smoothie!

Very good! I splashed it at the end with ginger ale for bubbles. It tied in well with the honey flavor.

Great cocktail.  Will definitely make again.  I did use orange soda (the product more like orangina than fanta's orange soda) instead of pineapple since I couldn't find pineapple.
