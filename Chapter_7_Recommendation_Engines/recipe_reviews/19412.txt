A very familiar dish to me that's especially delicious this time of year when tomatoes are at their vine-ripened best. I'll often use butter as well as the olive oil, and some fresh basil, parsley and/or chives. Freshly grated Parmesan or Romano is a fine substitute for Asiago. A few crushed red pepper flakes is good too, although I prefer this without. The tomatoes are meant to be fresh and uncooked, briefly tossed with the pasta just before serving.  The fresh thyme was new to me, however, and I wasn't so sure I'd like it.  I did.

Oh my! This is fabulous and while the title implies "basic" or simple, I have to say it's simply delicious and a great side dish for grilled chicken. The flavors pair together nicely and I can see replacing the fresh thyme with fresh basil. I did add a bit of fresh basil as I had some on hand. I also added a little Parmesan with the Asiago.  No matter what Italian cheese you have on hand you're sure to enjoy this dish!

Good simple side dish.  For an even easier preparation, use the canned italian diced tomatoes.

I actually doubled this recipe. Dont forget that Asiago is a bit of a stronger cheese. So, I suggest adding to taste as not to overwhelm the serving.

Very easy to make and very, very tasty! Tastes nice and light too. We have made this many times since I first tried this recipe, especially when we're looking for something quick and healthy.

Simple yet delicious!  Used tomatoes and thyme from the garden and served over whole wheat spaghetti with fresh Parmesan.  Fresh flavours, a great side dish to the Tuscan Chicken I made!

This was pretty bland we thought. I had to doctor it up a bit. I threw in sauteed mushrooms, garlic salt, and heavy cream because it was a little dry.

This was excellent. I made a little extra sauce and used it for garlic bread, just a few slices baked in aluminum foil.

This was a simple side dish and so delicious!  I used canned chopped tomatoes with Italian seasonings.  Everyone in my house enjoyed this, I have made it about 3 times since finding the recipe 2 months ago.
Thank you for sharing this recipe!

We liked this a lot. Great for a quick and easy meal. Followed another reviewer's suggestion to sub roasted red peppers for tomato and it was great.

We like to use whole wheat rotelli noodles and small cherry tomatos that we slice. We also slice up spinach and sautee onions and sweet peppers to put in it. I love to garnish with crumbles of goat cheese.

I was looking for a side for some lemon pepper chicken, and came across this recipe. I didn't measure anything since I was only making a small amount of pasta. I used grape tomatoes in lieu of regular tomatoes, sliced them in half and tossed them in just before we were about to eat. I also used a 3-cheese Italian blend from H.E.B., which included Asiago, Parmesan and Romano cheeses. It was fast, easy and truly DELICIOUS. My husband was still commenting on it the day after. Next time I may try it with bell peppers or scallions.  Thank you for sharing your recipe.    :o)

I scaled this down to two servings, but I love garlic and added three cloves. I sauteed that in a little olive oil and butter for a minute or two, and then added a few tblsp of the pasta water. I've made it with the thyme in the past, but because I have so much fresh basil on hand, I used that. As a reviewer mentioned, the tomatoes are not meant to be cooked. I used a few chopped Campari tomatoes and topped with parmesan cheese. This is a nice, light pasta dish (not with a heavy sauce) on a warm summer night and so easy to make!

I liked it but my boys were a little underwhelmed. They like marinara sauce and meatballs! But I enjoyed this as a summer spaghetti. I think I'd add another tbl of oil because the spaghetti didn't get as "coated" as I would have liked. I used grape tomatoes cut in half and they were delicious in the olive oil mixture.

My husband and I thought this was pretty tasty. Along with the asiago cheese - we also added a bit of goat cheese crumbles. I also throw in some cooked chicken breast.I'll add basil and oregano next time as well. A good - basic recipe to add to.

This was waaay to garlicky for me. Maybe I just like sauce.
