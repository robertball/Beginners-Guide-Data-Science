I like that this has such simple ingredients and not a lot of sugar. It held together well and tasted good.  Raisins added a nice chewy texture/taste. Good balance of oats to peanut butter. My boys are teens and only attracted to things with chocolate chips in them, but they still liked these.

Uh, may as well just get a spoon and eat the peanut butter from the jar.  I kept adding raisins, honey, and oats until I could taste them.  Won't make this again, but I'm not throwing them out either.

Simple no bake recipe!  This would be easy to change by adding chia seeds, carob powder or any other "energy" ingredients!

There are a million variations on this recipe, but this is the one to start from. It would be difficult to screw up this recipe. Add whatever you have in the cupboard (sunflower seeds, flax seeds,dried fruits, etc.) and adjust the rest of the ingredients so it's still moist enough to make a ball.  I don't worry to much about spoiling, since they rarely last more than a day or two.

great for my 5 1/2 year old who doesn't like to sit still for breakfast.  She's a 'grazer' and this gives her a good sustained level of energy throughout the day

Just made this with my 7 yr old grandson and he loved it!  Super easy and he enjoyed getting his hands in it.  Tastes great following the basic recipe but will try nuts, seeds and maybe choc chips in the future. Thanks for the recipe!

I used crasins and dried blueberries instead of raisins, it’s better. Also it’s very peanut-buttery.

A quick batch of 16 takes 2C of oats and 1C of peanut butter, plus 3 ish Tblsp on honey and whatever other toppings you want - I've used chocolate chips, cranberries and sunflower seeds. Such a great thing to eat before a busy day or to give to friends who need a boost!

My son has a severe peanut allergy, so I substituted Wowbutter (a soy based peanut butter substitued) and it was still very good!  So it can even be tweaked a little for people with allergies!

This was the recipe I chose for a Granna and granddaughter treat. Easy enough for her to measure out, put on gloves, and mix up.  I used the cookie scoop, and she rolled the dough into balls. Tasty too! We did add mini chocolate chips instead of the raisins since neither she nor her brother cares for raisins.

Meh. OK, but not great in my opinion. I might make them again just because they are so easy. Probably better for hiking or around the house than taking to friends. They're a little lackluster. Good basic concept though

I made these with dried cranberries instead of raisins and they were delicious!  Also made them with mini chocolate chips which were really good.  Just made my second batch last night.  Hoping to use these for nutrition on my longer runs.  Very peanut buttery so perfect for me!

I used some chopped dates and raisins.  Also a tsp of flax seeds and 2 tbs of sesame seeds.  Rolled them in ground pecans that I toasted first.  They are in the fridge but the one I tasted was really good.  Thanks

Only used oats, dried cranberries, and with the pb, I cooked with an equal amount of vanilla rice milk (on low), until nice and creamy....the best! Nice protein snack!

Everyone in my family loved these! I didn't know something so simple could taste so good! We put them on a cookie sheet and put it in the freezer.  Great little tasty bites - feels like a forbidden treat, but they're not! Will definitely make these again :) Thanks, DirtyDave!

Very easy and so yummy. I love this recipe because you don't need any special ingredient so you can throw it together with whatever you have in your cupboards. I added dried cranberries and chocolate chips.

This recipe was very tasty, but I felt it lacked a little something. I dipped the balls in powdered sugar, and they were delicious! My children enjoyed making them with me; the recipe is very simple.
