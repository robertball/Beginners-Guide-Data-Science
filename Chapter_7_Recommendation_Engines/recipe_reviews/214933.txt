I enjoyed the flavors. I had mexican shredded cheese so I used that. It was a little dry with only 1 tsp of dijon so next time I'll add more mustard. I also only had dried dill so I used that

I love this fresh-tasting salad. The dill really works. I added a handful of sliced-up spinach for color, and did not add the mustard - this salad tastes wonderful naked; without any dressing at all. I thought mustard might take away the salad's freshness somewhat. I could have added it after I tasted it... but I loved it plain.

This was pretty yummy stuff I added a bit more mustard taking another review into consideration. It had good flavor with just a few ingredients which was super super nice.
