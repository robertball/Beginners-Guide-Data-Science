I leave out the sugar which is how I have made them for years. They are wonderful as a sandwich bread for burgers, PB and J, etc. but you must use 2, one as a bottom and one as a top. I add garlic powder and other spices so they are savory and not sweet.

I often find myself using allrecipes and reading about 100 or so reviews before I make something. I actually found this recipe on a different site before I found it here. Well the results were amazing!!!!! The recipe I followed was 3Tb cream cheese, 3 eggs, 1/4 tp distilled white vinegar (instead of cream of tartar) and Splenda. I mixed, I whipped, I folded, I scooped and I baked!!!! 300 for 30 mins. Came out PERFECT!!!! Reviews had suggested that I store it in a bag overnight but I was so excited to make and try it we are about half of them!!!! Now is the fun part to make again and find variations. I want to try garlic bread, make breadsticks or something. It should be fun!!!

I've made this a couple different times when I was on a high protien, low carb, no sugar diet. Replace the sugar with truvia and bake it for about half as long as called for (15 min).  Don't worry if the cream cheese doesn't completely incorporate,  it will be fine once baked. Don't make this if you think it is going to taste like conventional bread, it just replaces if you need something to "hold" sloppy Joe or make a pp&j and can't have bread. Works great. Will mold if not used with a  few days or so.  Keep in the refrigerator.  You can place in toaster if you want it to crisp up.

This is no substitute for bread of any kind.  Recipe is impossible to duplicate.  Left cream cheese out of fridge all day and it still wouldn't incorporate completely with eggs.  That's after beating it with the mixer for 15 minutes.  Hardly worth the work.  Had to cut bake time by 10 minutes because tops were becoming DARK.  (All other times and temperatures in recipes work just fine).  If not eaten right after baking, they become a soggy mess.  As far as taste, slight eggy taste but nothing great.  I don't know why I keep trying these recipes - I have never found one worth repeating.

This was delicious! If you plan to try this, know that it is not 'regular' bread, so you're not gonna be able to split it and make sandwiches or anything. I've been seeing this floating around the internet a lot, so I was glad to finally try it. It is definitely easy to make and the flavor is great, as well as being super light and fluffy. Do keep check on this, as it didn't quite take as long to brown as the directions say, but that could be a difference in my oven. All in all, I really liked this and I would def make this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

For those that have problems with the cream cheese; I beat my room temperature cream cheese with a mixer until it is creamy & soft. Then, I add the rest of the ingredients, following the recipe.  This is great with dinner when made as a savory. It makes a great snack between meals, as well. I make mine with Splenda instead of sugar, as my daughter & husband are diabetics. Roll up some fruit slices in it & you have a nice desert or snack, any time. Very versatile & easy to make. Definitely will continue making this recipe, quite often. I haven't begun to explore all the different ways to serve it!

I did not use the sugar just because I am making this to cut my carbs.  I added some sea salt, garlic and onion powder.  I got 8 nice sized buns from this recipe.  I was out of parchment paper and oiled foil and that worked okay, but I had to b very careful removing it from the foil.  I can see smashing 2 of them flat and using it for a bun....I loved the texture and enjoyed eating one as a snack.  I will make these again !

Absolutely amazing!  I did use mine in place of a hamburger bun and it was delicious.  Yes you can cut it open... carefully.  Or use 2 pieces.  One for top and one for bottom. Will definitely make it again and again!

Just made the bread. Omitted the sugar for low carbs. It is amazing. It's not exactly bread, but with ham and cheese on top, delicious. With syrup (not low carb) the lightest, fluffiest pancake I have ever had.  
        
Everything was straight from the fridge so not room temp. I didn't have trouble mixing it (there were tiny speckles of cream cheese) but I can see how having everything at room temp would make it easier. 

I read a bunch of the one star reviews. When separating the egg white and egg yolk, do NOT let any egg yolk break and drop into the whites. It will NOT fluff up properly.    

A note for folding the egg white into the yolk. The goal is to gently mix together and as little as possible. The more you mix it, the less fluffier it will turn out. Also, I did it in 3 parts, so the first portion of egg whites deflate the most from the weight of the yolk mixture.
          
Lastly, I only baked it for 15 minutes resisting the urge to open the oven every minute to see it. 
         
Definitely recommend, I see a lot of potential recipes coming from this.

I hope my tips help :)

I made this recipe several times and knew I could master it with a few changes. My son has celiacs  disease and I'm not a huge fan of GF buns (their to dense) and he loves cheeseburgers. So my alternative to this recipe is I did beat the cream cheese 1st and than I added 1 Tbsp of GF flour. Perfect now for his burgers and the family loves them too.

Cloud bread was better than I expected and I love that they are low carb!  For the people having trouble incorporating the cream cheese, I would suggest making sure your eggs are at room temperature.  I always find it easier to cream things together that way.

When you're low carbing, anything remotely resembling bread is welcome. Being able to enjoy a grilled cheeseburger without needing a fork, that's pretty darned sweet! That said, it's obviously nothing like a yeast bread/roll. Those who go into it thinking it will be the same are setting themselves up for disappointment. For what it is, it gets the job done. I first made these when the recipe appeared in "Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution," the better part of 40 years ago. Cottage cheese may be substituted for the cream cheese. Be sure to spray your surface well, as these do have a tendency to stick. I have found that not bagging them soon after they are cooled, and allowing them to rest overnight, unwrapped, helps with the tendency to stick together, yet doesn't make them stale sooner. Two of them are excellent for making egg mcmuffins in the morning. Also great for mopping up broth or tomato sauce.

I loved this easy cloud bread. I AM always looking for a bread substitute. I made them exactly as the recipe stated and they were soooo good. Delicious with almond butter. I will be making these again.  NOTE: My bread only took 20 minutes to brown.

This was mighty good, I  made half a batch as is and it was really nice. The other half I added some garlic powder, salt and mixed herbs and it was great as well. I will absolutely make again. I will also lightly grease my cookie sheet because they got a little stuck this time. My fault for lining with aluminum foil. Oh, and they were done in about 10 minutes. I got 6 nice sized breads, very airy.

This is great for low/no carb diets.  I use as bread and add mayo and turkey breast for a satisfying lunch.  I use Truvia instead of the sugar and equal number of Tablespoons of cream cheese to eggs (3 eggs, 3 TBSP).  Completely cool, then put in Ziplock.  They will soften up.

I'm glad I tried this recipe!  I didn't have Cream of Tartar so I substituted Baking Powder and it worked just as well.  I also did add a little seasoning salt to the egg yolk mixture before folding it into the egg whites since I read several reviews that said it was pretty bland or tasted somewhat "eggy".  I baked mine for about 22 minutes total at 320 degrees.  I thought I would have to let them cool and then refrigerate to get the bread texture I wanted, but after I let them cool to room temperature, about 15 minutes, they were sandwich ready, so I made myself a sandwich!  I did find them to be a little "eggy" but more in the smell of them than in the taste.  I am happy and will make these again!

I used 1 packet of splenda instead of sugar with no difference in taste.    Love it!   Have made it quite a few times on Sundays for the week.   You do need to put it in a plastic Ziploc overnight for the best texture results.

It was easy . Beat cream cheese on high 5 minutes before I added the yokes had no difficulty incorporating the two together.  I did add a 1/2 tsp.  of salt and left out sugar. 
I only left out the sugar because I'm  on a low carb diet (60 carbs)  lost 12 lbs ??

I made this just as the recipe says and it was so good!  I was surprised that eggs and cream cheese can turn into a fluffy breadlike consistency. Next time I think I will omit the sugar because it tasted a little too sweet. But it's really a wonderful substitute for bread, especially if you have not eaten bread for a while.

I tried these because my best friend is diabetic and she loved them, so did her adult daughter.  We all thought they made a great dessert, too.  I followed  the recipe exactly. Thanks for making the recipe available.

So easy to make and so tasty! I agree with another reviewer that it only took 20 minutes in my oven for them to be golden. Will be making these again.

I can't eat cream cheese so subbed 1/4 c cottage cheese and also 1 packet of truvia for the sugar.  After 20 minutes they were really brown and puffy so I took them out.  Made a bacon, cheese, tomato and mayo sandwich with 2 breads and it was really good.  Illusion is certainly important to me.  It looked like a sandwich.  The bread is quite wimpy and squishes when eating, but that's ok.  I was eating a sandwich!   The taste was good, too, not real sweet. and when I ate some of it by itself it seemed like a delicate bread and did not taste too eggy.   **UPDATE**  I made another sandwich the next day (chicken) and was not nearly as happy with the leftover cloud bread.  After being in the fridge it was floppy--it still looked like the picture, but the texture was different.  I tried heating it in the toaster oven but it tasted like I was eating my chicken sandwiched between two small omelets.   The texture was spongey.  Not a fan of that at all.  I doubt I will make this again as it seems I would have to cut the recipe to one serving and make fresh every time.  I would rather just eat a lettuce wrap sandwich.  I'm not sure what would happen if the leftover breads were not refrigerated but I'm not sure that would be safe.

I did not make any changes and since I am  on low carb this cloud bread is wonderful. The only thing is it said no carbs but figuring it up there is carbs in it so this is a little misleading

It's not that I didn't like it, it just didn't come out like the picture. They came really flat and not puffyish and they had the consistency of thin styrofoam.

I have made this several times. The possibilities are endless. While it doesn't taste like bread it is a good substitute. I have made a "pizza" with it. Made the cloud bread added garlic to the mixture and put it in a pizza pan and baked it. Put my home made pizza sauce. Added my toppings and cheese and had my pizza. Also made "chocolate chip cookies". Added Splenda and chocolate chips to it and baked them. Like I said the possibilities are endless depending on the seasonings you use.

Will definitely be making this again. They are melt in your mouth heavenly. I followed the recipe exactly. A  hint to the reader who couldn't get her cream cheese blended you can zap cream cheese in the  microwave for a few seconds to make it creamy but I didn't have to room temp was fine.  I might experiment with different flavors next time. I did try one with peanut butter sprinkled with cinnamon sugar.  it was really good. Low carb and easy what could be better?

I leave out the sugar, made these for years. They can be spruced up with herbs and/or cheese if you like, I use 'vegan' cream cheese the last few years to make them casien free. Sometimes we make a double batch and spread it on pan-sprayed parchment on a baking sheet, add a couple minutes to the bake time. Cut it in bread sized flats. You can cut it to fit a brat , too, perhaps 8 by 5.  Works for keto or low carb.

Absolutely fantastic recipe!  You can't make this and expect it to be like bread otherwise you will most probably be disappointed.
I left out the sugar as I don't like sweet bread and am sugar free too, but these are exceptional.  I ate one with mayonnaise and parma ham and it blew me away!  Bread, what's bread?!!  I won't be reverting back to normal bread ever after this!  I look forward to experimenting with garlic and herbs to change it up.

My husband is gluten and grain free. I've made this several times with sugar, with Splenda, with half the amount of sweetening agent and with garlic powder added. Yay! He can eat a sandwich, a burger or toast and jam. He's happy and so am I. We love it!

I make this all the time. I used 1/2 tsp baking soda & 1/2 tsp. baking powder instead of Cream of Tartar. I add one Tblsp. honey if I want it sweet (makes great Crepes). Or I add Garlic Powder and Dill for savory. They last fine in a Tupperware and this recipe makes 6. So I get 3 sandwiches. Sometimes I bake the batter in a small baking (Casserole dish) and have a loaf to serve with soups... No guilt as I crave bread on the Paleo diet...

I was looking for a low carb baked good for my mom who is on a renal and diabetic diet, and this fit the bill. Made exactly as directed and they came out perfectly. They're kind of like mini Dutch baby pancakes or flat popovers. I wonder if the folks who had trouble we're trying to make these in the winter when the ambient temperature was too cold?

If you are looking for a bread alternative, this is pretty easy. My first attempt failed. I started with room temperature ingredients (AZ in the summer) and the egg whites deflated immediately when folded with the yolk mixture resulting in flat pancakes which tasted fine but were difficult to hold onto. I mixed everything straight from the fridge on my second attempt and they worked perfectly. My 7 yo won't eat scrambled eggs, but she liked these.

Awesome recipe.  I only had 2 challenges, but have overcome them:  1) I live at over 6,000 feet, so baking at that elevation can be a little challenging to get it right without flour in it. 2) The recipe should have a reminder to "beat the egg whites to REALLY STIFF PEAKS" and do so in a cold bowl.  My friend and I had the first batch with some fresh strawberry jam foam drizzled on top and they were delicious.

These were very flavorful and the family loved them. I followed the recipe as stated and the cloud breads were fluffy and a really nice change from the usual heavy breads. They are Weight Watcher friendly if you don't each too many! Only 1 point by my calculations.

This was extremely runny, I wasn't sure it was going to turn out. Took about half the recommended time to bake. We just made it for fun and ate it by pieces with our hands, and I highly doubt I would like to put anything on it. Won't be making this again.

If you're low carbing it these are perfect. No they're not the delicious dough-iness of wheat flour bread, but they're a good enough substitute. I didn't use sugar hence the carbs. You could use splenda or any other sweetner or any other savory seasoning.  Usually i just salt them before baking. 
   I don't understand why some folks are having trouble getting the yolks and cream cheese to combine. I can do it with a hand mixer but try a ninja or magic bullet if youre having problems. Also the egg white has to be perfectly stiff like meringue (I use baking powder since I don't like cream of tarter). Be very careful folding in the yolks as the egg whites have to stay as airy as possible. And then get them on the pan into the oven immediately for the same reason. Don't forget to use parchment paper or they'll stick like cement to your pan.  I also start checking them at about 17 minutes and as soon as I see the tops beginning to brown i turn on the broiler to finish the browning.

What a great option to have around and so easy to make. I have Celiac and get sick of the same thing all the time and my husband is on a low carb diet so this is wonderful! I added just a little more cream cheese than listed and mine did not take 30 minutes, luckily I was watching periodically or they would've burnt. Thanks for the recipe we will definitely be making this frequently!

Did not add sugar but some Italian seasoning. Amazing! If you have bread cravings this would cure it.

I've made this recipe twice now. Family loves them. I've had to make the following changes like others to keep them from burning. Drop temperature to 330 and cook 15 minutes.  We don't like them on their own but they taste great once you put toppings on them or make sandwiches with them. We found they were easier to use the next day after they have firmed up a bit. Will definitely continue to make.

It was a little bland. Big tip...never try to get "stiff peaks", or even soft peaks in hot, humid air. I may try again and tinker with the ingredients.

I made it today and it was awesome It was light but very filling. I used it for my burger and i didn't notice that i wasn't using an actual bread. I am pleased and will be doing this again. Just a tip, use the eggs and cream cheese at room temperature to incorporate it easier.

It smelled wonderful as it was baking, but it was a big disappointment once we took it out of the oven and tasted it.  It was bland and odd.

It's fine for what it is, though of course I leave out the sugar because the whole idea is to avoid sugar and refined carbs. I wanted to add, since some of the pictures reveal that not everyone follows the directions,  when beating egg whites it's absolutely necessary to keep any trace of fat, including egg yolk, out of the whites until they are beaten, or they will not fluff up at all. Use a glass or stainless steel bowl (plastic won't work). Break the eggs one at a time in a separate cup, and if a yolk breaks, put that one aside for another purpose and get a clean cup for the rest. I used a food processor for the cream cheese and yolks because it's much faster than a spoon and the cheese can be cold.

Made it exactly as written.. absolutely wonderful. While it doesn't taste like ciabatta or sliced processed bread, it does fill that void and makes great sandwiches. Next, I'm making long "rolls" for hot dogs!       This is fun and easy to make.. just make sure your cream cheese is at room temp or whip it up before adding the yolks.  This lets the yolks incorporate a bit easier.

Also, I whipped the whites w/ the c of t first, in one bowl, then whipped the yolks and cream cheese... then, I folded in a bit of the whites first to lighten the yolks up...then folded in the rest of the whites. Super easy and fun to make!  Thank you for a great recipe!

I made this twice in one sitting, the first time I followed the recipe to a tee except I decreased the time because they were looking browned enough. The second time I replaced the cream cheese with Fage Greek yogurt (2%) and I added some dill (because I think dill is good with yogurt and eggs). The sugar I added to the whites because it will keep you from over whipping the egg whites so that's a plus and I added sea salt to the yolk mixture.  The second batch had a much better flavor to me, the cream cheese version is good but little on taste. I love this and I can see how it is a palette for all kinds of flavors to come, at least in my kitchen.

Loved it! I read a lot of the reviews before making the bread and wasn't sure how it would turn out. It was very easy and quick to prepare, and a nice alternative to bread. My husband found it too eggy and as another reviewer commented, I would probably leave out the sugar as egg is quite sweet on its own. Looking forward to adding different flavors to the recipe; and as others posted, will bake it on a bit lower temperature for my altitude to ensure the inside is cooked through and the outside isn't too brown.

I'm OBSESSED with this bread now! It makes THE best PB&J sammiches ?? It's a little laborious for what one recipe yields, but I typically do my baking on a Sunday afternoon, so it doesn't bother me. Can't wait to try out some of the "add ins" suggested in other reviews!

At 350-degrees, they were well-done in only 20 minutes.  (If I had left the 30 minutes as directed, they would have been ruined)

I used whipped chive cream cheese (it was all i had) and it was PERFECT.  

THank you for this one!  My precious  daughter is on a special diet for epilepsy that reduces carbs and we need all the help we can get!  She just had two sandwiches....she loved the cloud bread for her sandwich.

When making the recipe, I replaced sugar with Truvia sweetener blend and then I ended up baking it for 20 minutes instead of 30. I could have even taken it out five minutes earlier because the breads had already browned.

Taste-wise, I'm not sure exactly how I feel. They are very fluffy and they definitely taste quite eggy. If you are looking for an exact sandwich/bun bread replica you've come to the wrong place. But if you are looking for a low carb bread-like textured snack, then this is it. I prefer to butter them and make cinnamon sugar toast. (once again I replace the sugar with  a sweetner, Stevia). Pbj is alright but not my favorite with these. 

I will try another batch again possibly, this time making it more of salty and garlic-y treat rather than a sweet one because I feel that may have more potential.

I love this as an alternative to high carb bread!  I used one packet of stevia instead of the sugar.  I also added some minced garlic and onion to the yolk mixture before I folded in the egg whites.  I can see this being a staple for me!

I made this with Pyure sweetener as I am trying to follow THM lifestyle to lose some baby weight.  I felt like the taste was ok, the texture was better after it sat in the fridge for a night but I would never call this bread.  I feltl ike it was too much work for the results I got.

I made this just as the recipe said, although I had to use greased aluminum foil. My bread stuck really bad because of that. My biggest problems is the egg-y taste and how flat they are! I will try again and hopefully it will fluff better

Mine were flat and stuck to the parchment paper when done.  The only think I can think of is that a tiny bit of yolk had mixed in with the egg white. The never formed the stiff peaks.

I followed the recipe almost exactly, but used one packet of Truvia instead of sugar and sprinkled in a bit of salt. I didn't know what to expect from these, and I thought they were fabulous! As others said, they are certainly not bread, but could be used in place of bread in many ways, which is great for those with dietary restrictions. I spread a bit of lingonberry jam on mine (Hello, Ikea!). My teenage daughter is kind of "grossed out" by eggs, but she loved these. When she asked what was in them, I said, "Umm..." and then she said, "Never mind! Don't tell me! Don't ruin them for me!" Haha!

The recipe was fantastic!  I did change the cooking time/temp... after about 15 mins the bread was nearing a golden brown so I dropped the temp to 325 for another 10 minutes or so.  It came out perfect and in my opinion, it was great to eat as a sandwhich.  I melted butter to easily spread on it and added Turkey and a slice of cheese between two pieces of bread... was delicious!

I made this with 3 tablespoons of full fat cream cheese, make sure it’s super soft to mix better. I added a pinch of Swerve sweetener to it. I didn’t add anything extra because I wanted to see how it turned out first. I plan on making another batch with a bit of vanilla extract and some cinnamon along with the Swerve sweetener to have as some toast with a bit of melted butter in the mornings. I also plan on making a batch with fresh garlic, salt and pepper for using as hamburger buns and garlic bread toast. I recommend putting parchment/wax paper between the layers of bread when storing, then tend to stick together after sitting overnight, I stored mine in a large ziplock bag. I also cooked these on parchment paper instead of using spray.

Since I'm not a fan of gluten free breads made with GF baking mixes, I'm always on the lookout for an alternative. This is good, but as some have noted, not really a bread that you could use in place of hamburger buns or any type of basis for a hefty sandwich. It was particularly good the next day reheated, spread with soft butter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar mix. it tasted like an egg-y pancake.  I stored the leftover "bread" rounds in the refrigerator in a plastic bag between layers of waxed paper to keep them from sticking together. I will be making again.

Will definitely make this again.  It was amazingly simple to make. I used stevia in place of sugar, and then only half as much. Also added some salt.

Maybe these are well liked if you are on a low carb diet or can't have gluten but I found them to be ok.  Make sure you beat the egg whites long enough for stiff peaks.  I should have gone longer because the batter seemed very runny.  Like other reviews it took about half the time to brown.  Had to try but would not make again.

Readers should know that you CAN substitute cottage cheese (4% fat) for cream cheese.  I doubled the recipe and it looked like this: 6 eggs, 1/2 tsp. cream of tarter, 1/3 cup cottage cheese.  (I omit the sugar, as other readers do.)  It makes enough to last me a few days!  Thanks for the recipe!

This recipe was easy to follow, but I have two qualms. First, there is no need to add sugar. The point is to make a virtually carb-free bread and you cannot do that with sugar. Second, the recipe says to bake until golden brown (about 30 minutes). Had I baked these for 30 minutes, I probably would have burned my house down! LOL - it took about 8-10 minutes! Otherwise LOVED IT!! 

P. S. I didn't have cream of tartar so I used lemon juice to help stabilize the egg whites. Came out great. :)

The direction was easy to follow. The bread tasted fine but with wired texture.  Not at all like bread or pancake.  Very eggy. Will not make again.

Love this bread. It is so light and fluffy, easy to make. Just wondering if it would freeze well enough to make a bunch ahead of time.

Messed up a bit I use an all in one electric oven, messed around and put it on confection oven instead of just bake. Next time I will not use sugar made it to sweet. Make a good dessert with the sugar in it, but not good for sandwiches.

Wow I was not expecting the flavor. So few ingredients but taste great. I was also surprised that for it to be so light but be able to hold together as a sandwich. Way better than gluten free bread. Very quick n easy to make up. Thank you for the recipe.

I don't know why I was afraid to make this.  Really simple process.  Followed directions as written but did not add sugar since I am doing Keto.  Turned out PERFECT!  Topped with sesame and/or poppy seeds prior to baking.  Looks, smells and has texture of bakery croissant.

These cloud bread buns were so easy to make and very delicious. I did not use sugar. After I placed the ‘bread’ on the pan, I sprinkled with oregano and Romano cheese to make it more savory. Wonderful flavor.

Perfect for those of us who have to avoid gluten. The bread is so light you feel almost guilt free eating it. It’s also a good way to get kids to eat more protein-yay!

Quick and easy to make.  Be sure to have ingredients at room temperature, for best results.  Mine cooked in less than 20 minutes...after 15 minutes I cut oven back to 325 degrees.  Next time I will start baking at 325!

I'm ecstatic! I hadn't heard of this 'cloud bread' until just a few weeks ago! My search led me to this recipe and I love it! It was so easy and tasty! I used Splenda in place of the sugar. Sure, it is NOT bread, but boy oh boy, it's a great substitute! Will be making again, and experimenting with savoury flavours, herbs, etc.

The recipe turned out fine and only baked them for 20 minutes. I was really excited but once they were ready, I did not care for the flavor or texture. My husband did not care for the flavor or texture either. Oh well.

I love this recipe and I make it a lot but, I always have the same problem. It all turns to liquid and I don't know how to prevent this from happening. Any feed back to let me know what I may be doing wrong would be amazing.  I beat the egg whites into stiff peaks but, once I add in the egg yolk mixture it just turns runny. I love this but, it drives me nuts! Please help!

Made exactly per recipe. While I appreciate that this is a good substitute for bread/buns for those who follow a gf diet, I just couldn't get past the eggy taste enough to enjoy. Sorry, it won't be a repeat, however, it was fun to try a new recipe, especially after seeing this cloud bread trending online for the past few months!

I wasn't sure what to think about this recipe, but, I had high hopes based on the reviews.  Unfortunately, this recipe did not work for me.  Both my husband and I thought it similar to a sweet fluffy egg.

I like the taste and it's an easy to have a protein snack on hand.  I don't think I did it right as mine came out very very flat.  I used cottage cheese as a cream cheese sub but it was low fat and I think that matters.  I will try it again with cream cheese in a few days. I think I didn't beat the egg whites long enough but I will definitely do it until I get it right

tasty! it was too runny to make separate "buns" so I just poured on the lined pan. only had to bake for 10 min. if 30 per directions, it may have been a cracker! tasted kind of sweet..reminded me of Hawaiian bread flavorwise.. made 2 "buns" from the recipe. would make again.

I definitely will make these again, but i don't see the purpose of the sugar, so I will leave it out next time. Also, bake time was more like 15 Mins. Looking forward to adding flavors like garlic or cinnamon, too. They are a great substitute for bread when you can't have it and really miss it.

This cloud bread is a very light bread. Has an eggy taste, I tried the first bun plain, the other with butter and the last with grape jelly, and they all tasted great. I  followed the recipe as directed, except that I use low fat cream cheese. I didn't have regular cream cheese. And next time I'll bake it for only 20 minutes because they got kind of dark.other than that Everything came out great.

Made the Cloud Bread, looked beautiful, anxiously awaited to see how it would be the next day, the bread is sticky and very moist. Did I do something wrong? I thought it would be drier like bread. Any help? I want to get it right. This would be a great replacement for high carb breads!

Wasn't expecting "bread" just something low carb to serve with soup and these certainly fit the bill!  The cream cheese didn't fully incorporate with the egg mix, so some 'buns' were more cheesy than others, otherwise no complaints  Will experiment further using differing spices, herbs etc.
Came across the recipe elsewhere and used eggs whites only (equivalent of 3 whole eggs) with about 2 tsps honey (didn't measure) in place of the sugar and Neufchatel cheese.

I am a fussy eater and made these about 40 years ago and found them to taste really good!  At that time I had made them for someone that was on the Atkin's diet (but tasted them myself).

I love this! I omitted the sugar to keep carbs lower and it turned out perfect! I used it as hamburger buns and it held up great! This will be a staple in my home since I don't usually eat traditional bread.

Turned out exactly like the picture after 20 minutes baking.  I replaced the sugar with sugar substitute to make it carb-free, but it doesn't really need sugar.  It's a good platform for a hamburger or chicken sandwich!
