I'm a fan of peanut butter banana smoothies and had to try this one out! This has the potential to be a great tasting smoothie but I found that it calls for too much ice. I made the recipe exactly as written and it tastes icy and unfortunately mellows out the peanut butter banana flavors. Skip the ice or only add a cube or two!

This is a nice smoothie, but I did make some changes. I've made smoothies with oats before, and I like to use quick oats and put them in the blender first so they get powdery. Then I used a frozen banana and skipped the ice. I used a 6 oz container of caramel yogurt, just sprinkled in a little cinnamon and put a big squirt of honey. It's very filling for a smoothie.

Quick, easy and tasty! Give it a try with some all-spice instead of cinnamon.

I made this slightly different...
instead of milk product (yogurt, milk) i used raw egg whites and organic agave light nectar for a sweetener with less ice. DELICIOUS

Okay so this is LiTeRaLlY the best smoothie I have ever had in my whole entire life. For some reason, this hit just the right spot for me. I make this smoothie for breakfast multiple days a week and wouldn't change a thing.  I didn't use cinnamon but everything else. I'm sure cinnamon would be great too!

This is really good. I didn't know what to expect but it's kind of like peanut butter ice cream. I especially liked the very subtle hint of cinnamon.

This was an easy smoothie to make and it tasted great. I did not add the extra sweetener (honey). It was sweet enough

Loved the peanut butter / banana combo! Even my son, who hates bananas, liked it.

Made another; added frozen blueberries, no honey or peanut butter, but kept the cinnamon. We liked the banana peanut butter better, but the banana blueberry was nice, too.

I didn't like it.  Then I added about 3 times as much peanut butter and it tasted OK.  I'm not a fan of the consistency, either: too thick.

I just started making smoothies. I really enjoyed this one I used cashew milk. and agave syrup. I will use more peanut butter just because I love it.
