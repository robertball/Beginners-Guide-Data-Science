I have to say this recipe was absolutely wonderful! I have only made stuffed shells maybe 3 or 4 times, and always just used spaghetti sauce. Because I have never like can tomatoes in anything I made, they always seem to overpower a dish, and all I taste is tomato. But this blew me away, oh so good! The only thing is I had half the sauce left over, could of easily used another box of shells. This was absolutely delish!

I loved this recipe.  I did add some parmesan cheese to the meat mixture.  I also added extra basil and garlic.

First I added an egg- which bound the ingredients together better.  I also added a little parmesan and mozzerella which also helped hold everything together. I was feeling too lazy to sautee an onion so I just put a small can of mushrooms in instead.

Remember to drain the diced tomatoes.  I forgot and it was so watery.  Also, mix the cottage cheese with the meat and onion NOT with the sauce!  It was pretty flavorful the next day.

This was ok.  I prefer some other recipes over this one.  If I made this again, I would use my own sauce.

This recipe was delicious!  I liked that it was easy to make and used ingredients I already had in my kitchen.  I'm sure I'll make this one again - maybe I'll add spinach next time.

It tastes OK but the meat was too crumbly, didn't stay together and came out of the pasta.I tried to put some of the sauce in the meat but it didn't help much. I gave it only 3 stars because my family ate it without any critics.I don't believe I'll make it again.

I made this tonight, I had to change it just a little. I had tomato paste, so I made my own sauce with that and some chopped onion and mushroom and pepper and tomatoes.  I added the hamburger meat to that sauce. I also used an egg and mixed the cottage cheese with the egg, some mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. As others suggested I used a zip lock bag with the tip cut off for putting the cheese mixture into the shells. That worked very well. I spooned in the sauce on top of that, inside the shells, after they were all filled I put more mozzarella and Parmesan and garlic powder on the top of all of it and then baked for 30 minutes.  I usually won't give a lower than 5 rating to a recipe that I modified. In this case it seemed the shells would not actually be very stuffed, but more cooked in sauce...if you stuffed them with just the beef. I layered everything inside the shells, no sauce poured on the top or under, which did take some time, but they came out Wonderful. Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Very good recipe!  The flavor was very good.  The sauce turned out a bit watery - next time I will drain all the juice out of the tomatoes.  I also needed only 1/2 the box of shells.

I really enjoyed this recipe for its simplicity and good flavor. It would have been rather bland as-is so I upped the garlic to a whole teaspoon of minced garlic and then used garlic salt instead of table salt. It was very flavorful at that point and my toddler daughter wolfed it down. Can't wait for the leftovers (and that's rare, for me!)

This was sooo delicious! I followed the directions almost exactly. I just added a little more garlic, because I am a garlic freak and next time I may add even more! Also, next time I will remember to grab tomato sauce and not tomato paste, and I will drain the cans of tomatoes. It still turned out delicious though, and I have three servings in my freezer for whenever I want some pasta :)

This wasn't a terrible dish. It was a bit disapointing however. I sounded like it would be so delicious but it was actually a bit runny and bland. I would like to try and make this again sometime. Next time however, I will double the meet and cheese and keep everything else the same. One thing that wasn't said to do was after bringing it out of the oven, leave the tin foil covered while the food it sitting. Also, you really only need one small can of diced tomatoes. 14.5 oz maybe at the most.

The box of pasta shells recipe was better than this. This was not really flavorfull and too watery! Use spaghetti sauce and ricotta. I am sad:(

This was OK, but I don't think I'll make it again. The sauce just didn't do it for me, and the proportions of cheese/meat/sauce just seemed off to me.

Course I changed it a bit.  Added black olives and artichoke hearts to the sauce.  Put cottage cheese, egg and sour creme with chives (I was feeling really creative) in the shells.  Cooked for alloted time and the filling was way to runny so I stuck it all back in the oven at 350 for a hour.  Perfect.

I made a double batch of these [one batch is one box of shells]. I used one 16oz. container of cottage cheese, and a lg. container of riccotta cheese. Everything else just doubled or so to our tastes.[ Some of this went in the freezer for a later use.] Also I just used a mix of regular hamburger and Italian sausage, probably almost three pds. of meat altogether.

Very nice flavor in this dish. I used 2T minced dried onion and a clove on minced garlic plus added 1/2 tsp season-all to the meat. I was out of sauce so I used puree. I forgot the oregano, oops! Next time I should add some cheese or something to bind the meat together as it was a mess and the shells didn't stay stuffed when eating. This came out really soupy though so maybe the sauce needs to simmer a while first and thicken before making the dish? This only used half the shells in the package. We all enjoyed this and I'll make it again with some small changes. I think we would have liked the cottage cheese better inside the shells instead of being part of the sauce. Thanks, this was great even though I made errors preparing it.

This recipe was just ok, it needs more cheeses and it doesn't say small or large onion, I guess I put in too much.  All we could taste was onion.

Love the recipe.  I used ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese and added mushrooms to the meat and onion.  I also cooked it for an extra 15 minutes without the cover to brown it up a little.  Will make again....the kids loved it!

The recipe was good but I think it would be better if you add cheese in the shells along with the meat.

Stuffed pasta is always a little work, but so worth it - this was great with the ground beef mixed with the cheese mixture.  I added some grated parmesan and some motzarella too so it would be even cheesier.  Also spiced it up with more garlic, some red pepper flakes and more basil.  Delicious!

This was the blandest recipe of stuffed shells I have ever had.  Also, I don't know what kind of 2-qt baking dish these were supposed to fit in, but I had to use a 9x13 pan and my 2-qt dish that is an 11x7 dish and both were filled.  I was so disappointed after all the prep.  While there was nothing that tasted bad about them, they were so boring, uninspiring, and now I have about 3 more meals leftover of these tasteless shells.  Don't waste your time on this version of stuffed shells.

My family loved this recipe! Instead ofground beef I added italian sausage and kept everything else the same. This was my first time ever making stuffed shells and I am so glad I chose this recipe. I will be making this again and again!

Simple and fairly tasty. I added an egg to the mixture, as well as some parm and extra herbs.

These were okay. Didn't love the cottage cheese/tomato sauce combo as I typically enjoy an unfettered tomato sauce. But, the recipe was easy and fast and lasted us a while.

The sauce was nothing to brag about for the work that was put into it it was not worth it. If you like pasta meals you would probably love it but if you are like me and only like pasta if it tastes wonderful look elsewere.

This was by far one of the best recipes off this site ive tried yet!! It was huge hit with the family and I will definately make this again. I did some things different though...I added more garlic than called for, added some mushrooms and red bell pepper to the meat mixture, and only used 1 1/2 tsp of orgengo. I was in a hurry so I only let is bake for a half hour and it still turned out great. A great recipe to add to any kitchen. I would give this 10 stars if I could.

My fiance' and myself LOVE this recipe. Instead of using beef we used ground venison and it was wonderful!  Thanks for the recipe! :)

i made this recipe with ground turkey instead of beef, and it came out great! i did have leftover shells, though, so be prepared to squish them on the dish...or make something else with them!

I loved this, it has been one I have loved for many years and always used the one on the back of the box, but it was not there! So I came here to allrecipes and found one that I enjoyed. My very picky 4 year old said "I liked it a little bit but not too much!" LOL Anyway I did make a few changes so see the one called Stuffed Shells too

This was delicious! Loved the simple savory blend of the stuffing vs. heavy tomato/meat sauce.

This dish is fantastic!  I loved the fact that all the ingredients are everyday in-your-cupboard items.  I will be making this again...but will add cheese and maybe some chopped mushrooms to the meat mixture.
