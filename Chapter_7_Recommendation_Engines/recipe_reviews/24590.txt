My first attempt ended in disaster as I knocked the large glass bowl I was using to mold the torte into fell from my kitchen island onto the ceramic tile...there was no rescuing it from the broken glass. I did have enough of the ingredients reserved for a mini-version and was pleased it came out so nicely. I have since just made it again and used paper towels placed on plastic cling wrap in lieu of cheesecloth and it worked fine. I also put it in the freezer for one hour rather than 3 hours in the fridge with an excellent outcome. This is one of those dishes that everyone keeps coming back for more!

This is dynamite!  I made a half-batch with only 3 slices of provolone - I thought I had more when I started. I used 4 cloves of roasted garlic for 8 oz. of cream cheese. (That cheese could stand alone as a spread.)  I didn't have any cheesecloth, but I used a small springform pan that was the exact size of the slice of provolone. I brushed pita bread with oil, sprinkled w/ salt and pepper and Italian seaoning, lightly toasted and cut into triangles.

I have made this but add chopped black olives and chopped pistachios....it is one of those things you bring to a party that people always ask you for the recipe!  Be sure the provolone cheese is not sliced thick...makes it difficult to serve.

This is a fantastic recipe that I have used several times, all with great success.  Everyone loves it and asks for the recipe.  That is the only reason that I was not going to leave a review.  I hate the thought that others will catch on, make and serve it and then it won't be quite as special when I make it.

I am giving this a 5 because everyone at the party I brought it to raved about it.  I did like it but I eat these ingredients a lot so it wasn't so "new" to me.  I used marinated sundried tomatoes because I had them in my cupboard and since I didn't have cheesecloth, I dampened coffee filters and lined the pan with them.  They worked quite well.  I wasn't sure how the provolone top and bottom would work or look and it worked and looked just fine.  I did cut the torte in half when I put it on the serving platter so people could see the ingredients and the colors.  I thought a cheese spreader would do the trick but decided to put a sharp knife out so people could make nice, clean slices.
Thanks for the recipe and adding to my stash of "yummy" treats.

This is delicious, beautiful, and easy.  I suggest using half the pesto though, because the full 8 oz. would be overpowering, I think.  Follow the rest of the directions exactly and the end results are phenomenal and just a beautiful presentation. I used a 1 qt. faberware bowl and got a lovely dome with a small diameter, which sat very nicely within a ring of crackers.  I did use a food processor to chop the sun dried tomatoes.  A pie spatula with a serrated edge makes a great serving tool for this.  One of my guests was so overwhelmed by this appetizer, she didn't want to eat any dinner! and everyone else loved it too.  I wouldn' t halve it like others have suggested because you're going to want the leftovers.

Terrific appetizer!  Served at a Italian wine tasting and was asked for recipe by all!  I would suggest scaling the recipe in half for a group of up to 10.

This is an excellent appetizer with a flavor that belies the amount of time that goes into making it.  I used mini spring form pans and made three small tortes.  Served with crisp crostini, it was absolutely delicious.  This would be a great appetizer to serve at an appetizer only party, as it is quite filling.  I noticed that some people used sun dried tomatoes in oil and I am very glad that I did not.  The clean taste of the tomatoes was a great contrast to the oily pesto.  I will definitely serve this again.

I made this for the first time for a holiday party - it was a hit - made it again recently for a work party.

I substituted goat cheese for the provolone, the first time because I had it in the refrigerator and it sounded good, the second time because it really was good!  I also ground up pine nuts and sprinkled it over the top - YUM!

The presentation was beautiful -- it was so tasty.  I have had the recipe as cited at a brunch, and I made it substituting roasted red peppers for the sundried tomatoes.  Both were totally delish.  I followed a previous suggestion, added some fat free half and half and served it over penne pasta the next night.

We had an Italian dinner theme for a family reunion and this spread was a big hit. Several asked for the recipe. It was delicious and easy to prepare, too.

Update - The first time I made the torte I followed the directions exactly and it was a very nice presentation.  Then I got lazy . . . I processed the rehydrated sun-dried tomatoes in the food processor until finely chopped, added the cream cheese and minced garlic and blended the ingredients.  I spread the cream cheese mixture on a large plate, topped it with the pesto and a shredded Italian cheese blend.  EASY and still delicious!

This is a great recipe!  I'm glad someone said to cut the Pesto in 1/2.  Otherwise, it would just be too much. I even cut it back a little more the second time I made it. Otherwise make it just as it says and it will come out great!  I added a design on top with roasted red peppers and a piece of olive.  I uploaded a picture.  You can see that the finished piece was nice and round (molded it in a bowl) and added the design.  Put your design in the bowl FIRST (on your cheesecloth)then build on top of it so that when you flip it over, it's on top!

this was amazing, the hit of the party!  The flavors blended so well together, I am sure I added more than 3 oz of the tomatoes, but just eyeballed that part so it would be enough for both layers.   After plating it I wish I had bought an extra slice of the provolone to make some sort of design for the top before I started the layering, seemed kinda naked on the top.

This is a beautiful presentation. I always get asked for the recipe. If you have left overs warm it up in a sauce pan add a little milk or cream to help soften and turn it into a sauce to be ejoyed over pasta! It is Delicious:) You will be very happy you tried this recipe!
Thank you Elaine!

I made this for a party over the weekend and it was really spectacular.  The flavor was amazing and it made such an impressive presentation.  I made mine in a loaf pan lined with plastic wrap and cofffee filters (I didn't have cheesecloth) and it came out beautifully.  I would imagine that homemade pesto would really bring it over the top but I didn't have time to make my own.  I used store-bought pesto and store-bought sundried tomato bruschetta (both found in the pasta sauce aisle in the Acme supermarket) instead of straight sundried tomatoes.  The flavor was awesome.  It is a fantastic recipe and I will definitely be making this again.  Thanks for posting, Elaine!

This was great!  I was asked for the recipe by 3 different people.  Looked very pretty and tasted delicious.  A caution, don't go overboard on the garlic, I started to add more but am so glad I didn't.  Because it's raw a little goes a really long way.  I did cut down the amount of pesto just a bit and make sure to chop the sun dried tomatoes really well.  I will definitely make this again-easy, impressive and fantastic for a party since you can make it ahead of time!

This was a HUGE hit! I had an italian themed dinner party and I made this as an appetizer. I wanted to make crostini to go with it, but with everything else going on, I didn't have time so we settled with wheat thins crackers. Delicious! I did not have cheesecloth and I tried the coffee filter thing as another reviewer had tried. I found the filter helped get this out of the pan but once I inverted it onto a plate I just covered it with a paper towel and changed the towel every so often as needed. It did a great job soaking up the oils. I halved the recipe and put this in a mini loaf pan for the mold. I'm sure this will be requested again!

I made this for an anniversary party for my parents, and everyone loved it. I sprinkled some pine nuts between the tomato and provolone layers, just because I love pine nuts with basil and sun dried tomato. This was so easy that my husband even made it a few weeks later for a work potluck. It must have been a hit, because he came home with an empty plate.

LOVED IT! I scaled the recipe way down, because it was just two of us eating it. I used a ramekin and used a round cutter to cut the cheese to fit perfectly inside. All of the flavors in this went perfectly together and I will definately be making this one again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Guests raved about this.  They were surprised that I had made it myself.  It is impressive.  Only one problem:  the provolone slices are slippery and the layers fall apart. It was hard for guests to manage to get it on the crackers.  It's kind of a struggle, and rather messy.  But very tasty and impressive.

This is a delicious and unique presentation to this combination of ingredients. I used jarred garlic pesto so was glad I used only half of what was called for in this recipe... and also glad I put only the one clove of garlic in the 16 oz of cream cheese that was called for. I served it with big stone wheat crackers and used a serrated pie cutter.  It was a messy process and that is my reason for knocking it down to a 4 star.  I'm not real sure how to improve on that mess-factor.  Maybe using these same ingredients but small cheese-bottom layered with the pesto/cream cheese/tomato combo that can be placed on a cracker or not.  And, though I'm a garlic-lover, I think I'll make my own pesto next time and cut back on the amount of garlic over-all.

I loved this, but then I love pesto anything.  I used a roasted red pepper/olive tapenade instead of the sun-dried tomatoes, since that's what I had.  Served with crostini and crackers.  I made a red pepper and parsley leaf "flower" in the bottom of the bowl before I started layering.  Pretty impressive to guests.

It was okay... people enjoyed it, but it wasn't as phenomenal as I'd hoped for.   Great to take to parties for sharing and you'll get compliments, I just wasn't personally crazy for it.  I would recommend using good quality pesto....

I made this for a party and it certainly tasted very good... unfortunately, I find that anything with pesto always looks like I already ate it, so there weren't a lot of people brave enough to try it.

this was a BIG hit!!  everyone loved it! Great presentation, great taste! I always read the reviews before I make a recipe, they always help!  I used the recipe for pesto from this site that uses walnuts instead of pine nuts, it was very good!! Definitely a keeper!

Love this recipe! This may be the only time I ever say add just one clove of garlic.  I am a garlic-aholic and put in several ... I have to say it may have been a tad too much!  other than that I used my medium square pampered chef bowl and it looked great!  I sprinkled fresh parsley around (I hate cilantro)and a little paprika for color!  I have also used several blades of chives tied in a bunch also looked great!! BTW I have also substituted roasted red peppers for tomatoes and it was yummy!

I just put the torte in the fridge, but I layered the left-over ingredients on crackers and they tasted absolutely AMAZING.  Using my little brother's exact words, it tastes like "a party in my mouth". Update: I just served this at a party with bagutte slices and it was gone by the end.  I would make this again.  Fast but impressive.

This is a 5+ recipe.  After serving it to friends as an appetizer, my husband declared, "it's more than a do over; it needs to be a refridgerator staple".  That says it all.

This is ALWAYS a hit at any gathering!  I have sent this recipe out a dozen times this holiday season!  No one will be disappointed.  The only thing I do different is to put the sundried tomatoes in the food process for easier chopping.  Enjoy!

I've made this numerous times & it's always a hit . it is very delicious & impressive looking!
after reading some of the comments here's what I do:  I strain the jar of sun dried tomatoes to be sure alot of oil is gone, I always made it in a loaf pan  - easier to slice, I do add pistachios (a really nice addition), be sure the provolone is thin,  I use store bought pesto but be sure to use a good brand (enough oil in that alone), always use cheesecloth but the coffee filters is a great idea, once in the loaf pan I press down a few times (my original recipe says to place heavy cans on top) & let it refrigerate overnight.
I decorate the top once I turn it over to serve so you can wipe 
away any excess oil.   hope this helps!!

Really good! Used tomato bruschetta and neufchatel cheese? Also I squeezed most of the oil out of the pesto and bruschetta. Even had to drain off the plate a bit after I had wrapped it in saran wrap. 1/2 recipe is plenty for 8 people. It was a delicious and colorful addition to our family Christmas Dinner!

Best ever!  Had this at a baby shower -- made it twice so far and it is a HIT. Super easy. I was able to find minced sun dried tomatoes in a grocery store which made making this all the more easier.  I also warmed it in the microwave to melt the provolone cheese.

Made this for our card party and every one loved it.  I used paper towels instead of the cheese cloth and it turned out great.  Im not into measuring to much so I used what I thought was good, and it still turned out great.  I did a design on the top before I layered the contents in.

This was awesome and SO pretty! I used fresh provolone from the deli and bought a couple extra pieces to add some pretty holiday cut outs on top.  The only thing I wish I would've done differently was to buy the refridgerated pesto instead of the jar/aisle pesto.  It was too oily to work with while I was making it but it still turned out delicious and so so so pretty!

thanks for this recipe, the only thing I didn't like was the sun-dried tomatoes.  I had never used sun-dried tomatoes before. I don't like the texture of them.  The left over tort I placed the layers on flour tortilla shell rolled then sliced.

I made this for the 1st time for a party Friday night. The recipe was super easy. I didn't have cheesecloth so I went with another reviewers comments & used saran wrap with paper towels. You have to have the paper towels; I didn't realize how oily pesto is. I only used about 4oz of pesto & thought it was plenty.   I knew I didn't have time to refrigerate the torte, so I left the cream cheese out about 10-15 minutes to soften & made the torte just before the party. I rolled up into a ball & served immediately. The recipe made plenty. I cut the ball in half. I put half out with (store bought) pita chips and the other half in the refigerator. We only ate the half I put out so I ended up with left overs! The torte was also good with tortilla chips & wheat thins. Next time I am going to make pita chips in the oven.

I changed this up a little.  I took 1 block of cream cheese and mixed it with sun dried tomato pesto (store bought).  I put the cream cheese/pesto mixture into a small loaf pan and layered with goat cheese.  I baked it for about 20 minutes and then put it in the refrigerator.  We ate it cold from the refrigerator on wheat things.  very good and used stuff I had on hand!

Very easy and it looks like I fussed.  Red and green layering are perfect for a Christmas get together.  It went very fast at the party I took it to and I got several requests for the recipe.

Thanks for your recipe.  I had nearly the same recipe from Southern Living and when I went to make it (after buying all the stuff) the recipe made no sense - no layering (even though the picture showed it was clearly layered!)  Their directions said to process everything all together and put it in a loaf pan!  I thought - there is no way that is right!!!  You saved the day Elaine!  Grazie!
