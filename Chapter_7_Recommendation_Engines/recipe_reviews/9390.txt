GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS, GORGEOUS!!! These are a big hit! The balls themselves are nice, but dipping them in chocolate takes them to a whole new level of DELISH. I did some of them with the powdered sugar, some with white chocolate, some with milk chocolate and some are double-dipped... heh-heh-heh. :) I used coconut rum which is excellent and doubled it (1/2c.), because they were otherwise looking too dry. Lastly, I used a mixture of nuts - almonds, pecans & walnuts. I think this recipe just made the cut for an annual holiday fave!

Even after 24 hrs this "dough" was still wet, sticky, and inedible. After crushing and adding an ADDITIONAL box of wafers, they were fine. Seriously: how did these work out for so many other cooks? Other coconut rum ball recipes include an entire box of confectioners sugar. That would have fixed the consistency, but really: they were YUMMY and less sweet w/double the wafers instead. My suggestion: make them with extra wafers and sugar on hand, and far enough ahead of schedule to tinker with this recipe. With all good ingredients and no baking, these will end up fine if you can achieve the proper consistency. But this recipe, as written, did not work for me.

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I agree that they only improve with age.  I could not make enough of them to satisfy the crowd at work. Definitely a hit!

Absolutely delicious-taste like a Mounds Bar!  One thing to note, I would be sure that they are ate before a few days, as the longer they sit, the stronger the alcohol becomes.

Recipe came out good but needed a bit more rum.  I put in 1/2 cup coconut rum and they were still a little dry.

These made excellent gifts for friends, everyone loved them. I upped the rum amount to 1/2cup as others suggested. I also let them sit overnight before rolling them and they weren't too wet. I think one box of wafers was adequate even though some people didn't but I didn't eat any, I think one full box is just enough so don't eat even a few. They are worth the wait and only get better with age. Thanks for a new holiday favorite.

This is a gorgeous recipe, but after much debate with my husband, I used white chocolate crushed into bits and sultanas instead of walnuts and coconut. Also, I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa to give them a bitter sweet chocolate taste along with the rum. So rich and yum. Will definately make this again.
14 ounces of condensed milk was too much for my wafer biscuits, so I used two thirds but added it carefully and mixed as I went to check consistancy.

I followed the recipe exact and everone loved them.  Many in my family said they were pretty strong, just how they like them. I did leave them set for a while for the flavors to mingle.  Great, easy recipe.

My friends who like rum balls LOVE these! I make them two to three months before Christmas, refrigerate them in an air-tight container, and "baste" them with a little run every couple of weeks. Finally, I dust them in confectioner's sugar or dip them in melted caramel or chocolate. Then I pack 'em up and give them as gifts. If that's labor intensive I can assure you the end result is worth it.

I make these every year at Christmas, and they are a hit wherever we go!  I top them with drizzled melted dark and white chocolate instead of powdered sugar, which goes great with the coconut!

These were awesome! I love making rum balls, they are just as yummy as cookies but a lot easier. First I made the chocolate rum balls from allrecipes and they were so good I made more along with these. I think the coconut rum balls were a little better than the chocolate ones. But, I love white chocolate and these had more of a white chocolate flavor to them. After I made them I rolled some in toasted coconut, some in powdered sugar and some in melted white chocolate chips. I would not recommend dipping them in the chocolate, it made them overly sweet. I will definitely make these again come Christmas time as gifts.

This recipe makes at least 20 - 25 rum balls with the footprint of a quarter. These are rich & decadent. I dipped mine in melted Ghiardelli chocolate. I will try Creme de Menthe or Peppermint Schnappes next; a flavored rum would have been better, I think. The Nilla wafers were rich and vanilla-y, but I suppose I just don't like rum all that much! The rum was a decent brand, but using coconut rum or Kahlua or creme de menthe might have been better.  Easy to make and the kids enjoyed helping. Kids didn't like the flavor. My 9 yo son said the rum ruined them.

A winner!!  This is a quick, easy holiday cookie.  I took some to work and gave some to friends.  They were a smash hit! 
  I used pineapple rum and doubled the amount (1/2 c.)  I used almonds instead of walnuts and chopped them very fine in an electric chopper. I also let these cookies set for a week in an airtight container before serving.
   For those who had trouble with a sticky consistency, I would suggest measuring your coconut packed.  I did so and even though I added an additional 1/4 c. rum, the consistancy was still perfect.

These rum balls are amazing!!  I am a coconut freak so these rum balls were right up my ally.  I followed this recipe to a T, except that I used CruzAn coconut rum.  I had to make a double batch the same day because I family ate all of the rum balls in a matter of minutes.  If you love coconut and rum, please make these you will not be disappointed.

I am not a fan of rum balls but I made these as a gift for my landlady this christmas.  She begged for the recipe as everyone that came to visit her ate them up.  I did half the batch rolled in sugar and the other half dipped in chocolate.  They were a hit in her house and my boyfriend loved them too!

I just made these and I thought they were good.  I was wishing for more of a rum flavor in them even though I used real rum.  Easy to make though.  Very sticky so not very easy to roll into balls.

This is an excellent recipe for the holidays.  They got rave reviews from everyone who tasted them, and they are very easy to make.  I used pecans and cheap rum.  The rum taste is not noticeable.  Next year I may try adding just a few Tablespoons more.

I agree with another reviewer who needed to add an additional package of wafers. The recipe as is left the balls very tasty but soggy. Make sure you have extra wafers on hand and they should turn out great!

I made these for a party and they were a hit - at least with the people who had a huge sweet tooth.

My first batch was for my daughter's bake sale and they sold out instantly.  I'm on my way to make another batch for ANOTHER bake sale!
