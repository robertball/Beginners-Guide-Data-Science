This is a great way to make use of leftover ham. I didn't have cheese soup on hand, so I used cream of mushroom and added a handful of shredded cheddar.  fantastic! Definitely a keeper!

This was not a favorite...it was lacking something.  I tried to jazz it up a bit but no luck.  The guys thought it was ok, but I was disappointed.  The broccoli was so overwhelming...and it was bland.  Will not make again.

This was OK. It was a little bland for my taste. I love lots of flavor. I substituted corn for the broccoli sisnce I didn't have any. It was truly a nice, easy dish to prepare. I may play with it a little to get a little more flavor in it.

Great recipe!  I had a box of rice-a-roni cheddar & broccoli rice so I add that for flavor, cream of mushroom soup instead of the cheese soup, some chopped yellow onion and a splash of milk.  I crushed up some cornflakes instead of bread crumbs for the topping.  Served with a side salad.  Fantastic!

I was looking for a recipe to used leftover frozen ham from the holidays and other things I had in the pantry, and found this.  It was really good.  The only change I made was instead of bread crumbs I topped it with some shredded sharp chedder and french fried onions during the last 10 minutes.  I will definitely make this again.

Mmmm...I made this tonight with chicken instead of ham and it was fantastic...warm, cheesy and creamy.  I added a bit more rice than called for.  The breadcrumb topping looked and tasted great too.

This was wonderful!  There is nothing like the delicious flavor of mayo and sour cream in a casserole!  I might try it with leftover turkey or chicken sometime.  Very cool!  Thanks for the recipe Brenda!

This was quick & easy. Great to make ahead and nice looking. I used fresh broccoli and added more pork.

Overall a good casserole but I don't like condensed cheese soup so I made a cheese sauce with flour, butter, sauted onions and garlic, milk and cheddar cheese and used it instead.  Also added kosher salt and freshly gound pepper to taste.  Will make again.

De-lish!!!!  Super-fast, super-easy.  The whole family loved it!  I followed the recipe, but I used fresh broccoli because that's all I had.  I love it with hot sauce!

This recipe was ok. It reminded me more of a side dish than an actual meal. It could use a bit more of a cheesy taste too Maybe  some shredded cheddar while baking. I made recipe as written!

I used crumbled crackers instead of the bread crumbs and added more ham. This recipe is an excellent way to use leftover ham.  Picky husband went back for seconds.  As for using corn instead of broccoli, as someone else did, I don't think that would mesh well, maybe some Italian blend vegetables if you were out of broccoli.

I didn't have cream of cheddar so I also used cream of mushroom and added cheddar cheese with it. I used a broccoli mix as well, didn't have just plain broccoli on hand. Kids and husband all liked it, and that's hard to do! Didn't find it bland at all.

I like this recipe because it is so adaptable to what you have in your panty/refrigerator.  I used cream of chicken instead of the cheddar.  I used all sour cream instead of the mayo.  I added in a couple tbsp of a garlic,oil,chipotle spread I had.  Finally, I used french fried onion rings for the topping.  I like to refer to this recipe as a method :)

I used this as a base, I didn't happen to have the cheese soup so I made a cheese sauce from scratch.  I didn't have any sour cream either.  I did add two stalks of chopped celery, an onion, and 4 cloves of garlic.  This was very yummy, and I will try it again-hopefully with all the ingredients called for!

Personally I thought this was fabulous!  Now I didn't make it exactly like yours but I'll tell you why.... the grocery store was against me.  I didn't find cheese soup so I used cream of onion.  I didn't use regular mayo because what was in my fridge was the olive oil mayo with cracked black pepper.  I added cheese since I couldn't get cheese soup.  The only that I'd say I truly modified was I skipped the crumbs on the top.  Just personal preference.  Anyway, it was THE BOMB!  Oh my goodness, was this ever easy and sooo super yummy.  I did find it a bit thick, but I think it was rice I used.  So I added a splash of milk to thin it out just a tad.  My boys loved it, even my youngest son actually ate his broccoli and he told me this recipe was a keeper.  Thanks for such a great recipe!!

A wonderful, FAST, delicious way to use up leftover ham. I will make again, keeping everything the same except the rice - I think as written there isn't enough, I will add three or maybe even four cups next time of the cooked rice. Thanks so much for sharing!
