Easy Roasted Broccoli Haiku: "No need to use bowl. Just toss with oil on pan. Mmmm ... add parmesan!" This couldn't have been easier or more yummy! I bought one of those 12 oz. bags of broccoli florets from the produce department so I didn't have to cut anything - just dumped on the sheet, tossed w/ the oil (1 TB was plenty) and s&p, and 18 min. at 400 deg. was just about perfect! Adding a sprinkle of parmesan at the table was magic, but on its own, just as wonderful and simple of a side dish. I normally steam my broccoli in the microwave w/ butter, lemon juice, s&p, but this was absolutely delicious and something that I'm sure I'll do again and again!

Added a little garlic salt and finished with Parmesan cheese. Fabulous.
Not sure why others would double the cooking time then give a one star review because it was burned....

Very tasty basic recipe. Much better than steaming or boiling your broccoli! Easily customizable to your family's preferences by using different seasonings. The only thing I suggest is using more oil since 1 tbsp wasn't nearly enough. The pan dried out quickly. This would be excellent using flavored olive oils.

I always forget about roasting veggies so I'm happy that I saw this recipe. I used garlic flavoured olive oil and tossed on the baking sheet. Needed a little longer than 18 minutes. Thanks karenatlincoln!

Next best vegetable ever.  Simple.  Flavorful.  Roast it til it is visibly browning about the edges, changes the flavor like magic.  The best vegetable ever is Brussels sprouts done the same way.  You can add sliced or crushed garlic, you can use infused oils, add peppers, bacon or ham,  Parmesan after taking out of oven, or just keep it simple.  Healthy comfort food.

So much more healthy than other ways of eating broccoli.  I use Montreal seasoning that has a bit of garlic in it.  Always received well.

Based upon several of the reviews, I added an extra 1/2 Tablespoon of oil, turned the broccoli at 15 minutes, and  because we like tender, not crunchy broccoli, I added 10 minutes to the total cooking time.  The broccoli was smelling burned by the 15 minute mark.  By the 30 minute mark it was inedible.  Were I to try this again, I would do a foil packate, lower the temperature and increase the time so that the broccoli has a chance to become tender.

Our favorite way to cook broccoli. To the broccoli florets and olive oil, we add about a tablespoon of minced garlic and use Montreal Steak Seasoning rather than salt and pepper. I toss all in a plastic bag, give it a good shake, then spread it over the baking sheet prior to baking. I'm going to try the parmesan cheese addition next time I cook this. I just shake olive oil into the plastic bag, but feel I use at least double the amount listed so that it gets over all the florets.

Love this recipe. I add garlic powder and I personally prefer my broccoli a little more done, so I typically roast it for closer to 30 minutes. It's also great with sesame oil.

Simple and tasty.  I used half a bag of Costco Broccoli and cut each floret in half.  Tossed in olive oil on the baking sheet and then arranged them cut side down (flat side down).  Add Salt and Pepper.  Baked for 20 minutes at 425.  The flat side will brown on the pan and the top side gets a crispy crunch.  Super yummy.

Delicious and simple.   Infused olive oils and adding a touch of red pepper flakes would work wonderfully too.

Mylove adamantly refuses to eat broccoli unless it is served raw, dips it in ranch dressing or as an add in for his salad. I made this for dinner tonight. I could not believe it! He ate more of this than I did and loved it. Why? He said it was because it was not soft and overcooked which is how he describes "steamed" broccoli. I made this exactly as written, used 3 stalks for two of us, made sure that the stalk pieces (including the stalks with the crowns) were as close to a quarter of an inch thick as possible. Used 1 T. olive oil, coarse sea salt and black pepper. Delicious!! Ate the last little bit while cleaning up the kitchen and was just as good cold.

Roasted it right in the cast iron pan which I put in the oven, I think it added extra roastiness to it. Used garlic salt as well, great recipe. Will try roasting other veggies soon!

Great way to make broccoli and many other vegetables.  No need for a bowl, just toss everything on the pan.  Also, I flip the veggies half way through the cooking time and use garlic salt instead of regular salt.

We love roasted broccoli and this recipe came out very good! It might seem too simple, but basic seasoning is usually the best to not take away from the flavor of veggies! Super easy side dish to make to accompany other main dishes. This will be a go to recipe for us! Thanks for sharing!

Was OK. Instead of regular olive oil I used garlic infused olive oil. Overall it was a little bland but nice and easy.

I must have done something wrong because it was dry, almost crispy.  Even so we actually liked it.  I will try again maybe with more olive oil and/or raising my oven rack.

This is a good recipe for your basic roasted broccoli if one wants to build on it and make it their own. There's nothing super special about this recipe. We added garlic, but I may try some more fun things later.

Quick, easy and very yummy! Did this for meal prep alongside roast beef and roasted sweet potatoes. Seasoned generously with salt and pepper before baking. Easy easy easy!

Not bad. A little bland maybe. I often will sprinkle some Parmesan on it after roasting.

Very easy and yummy. I like adding a bit more flavor with garlic powder and cayanne powder though, and a bit more charred so I cook for 20 at 450.

I never review any recipes From allrecipes since I always change them up a bit.  Yet, in this case I had never even thought to roast broccoli.  It turned out fantastic, I did my usual thing, I made changes.  I tossed the tops in melted butter (lightly) instead of olive oil, and cut all tops about the same small size.  I sprinkled w/garlic powder then baked on an oil-sprayed foil lining on a cookie sheet in a preheated oven.  Temperature at 425 degrees for 13 minutes.  Once out of the oven I pulled up the foil to unstick any pieces, both sides were slightly browned.  I tossed the broccoli with about 1 to 2 table spoons of parmesan cheese, not too much.  A couple of whirls of fresh ground pepper and the result was delish!  Slightly crunchy tops and al dente stems.  I’m not a big broccoli fan, but my husband is, and this dish will go in my rotation. Thanks for the idea!  

Last thing, wash them ahead of time and layout the pieces on a towel to let dry.  You don’t want to use wet broccoli, the dryness makes the tops crunchy.

I will make this again, but I modified it a little bit. I added a bit less oil (maybe 1/3 less), and tented it with foil after about 8 minutes, because it was starting to burn a bit. I massaged the broccoli with the oil, salt and pepper for a minute or so before putting it in the oven, which I believe helps the broccoli stay a bit more tender. I also ended up lowering the heat a bit after covering with foil. It was great, but just a bit too browned on the top. I think next time I will start at 350 F, maybe put the foil on top sooner (5-6 minutes), and then finish roasting for 15 minutes.

The easiest way to cook and eat broccoli. We love broccoli but like others I steam it or use in a casserole. I don’t think I can eat it any other way, you can do so many things to change it up. I used garlic salt and pepper. Thank you for the recipe.

This is a great base recipe. Delicious as is,  but even better with some extra seasonings. I added garlic while roasting, then sprinkled with Parmesan and lemon juice after it was all cooked.

Why have I never roasted broccoli before?  Roasting is waaaaaay better than steaming or any other method for that matter!  I generally don't do a whole lot of measuring when making things like this but I did use the ingredients listed.  Oh sooooo good!  We had this dish twice this week and both times there were no leftovers.  From now on the vegetables get roasted...broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, carrots, etc.!

In a quick fix, this is the simplest way to enjoy broccoli. In a really quick fix, you can use frozen as well. I followed recipe exactly and the broccoli was sweet and cooked thru. I also sometimes put garlic powder and or Parmesan cheese on top during the cooking process. On any busy day, this is a great way to cook a veggie with dinner . Hardly a mess and no fuss.  So much better than the average boil or steam.

Wonderful recipe; however I made the following alterations: substituted with smoked salt, added dried pizza garlic (slightly larger granules than garlic powder) and teaspoon of anise seeds.  Topped with grated Pecorino Romano cheese after removed from oven.

I used frozen broccoli florets I bought from the supermarket. First I put the broccoli in the microwave to defreeze them for 3 minutes. Then I put them on a tray, sprayed some olive oil and sprinkled some sea salt. I put them in the oven for 30 minutes. It was very tasty, however, I think it would be better if the broccoli is not frozen to start :)

I combined a couple other elements from the other recipes with this one.  The only differences were that I used garlic salt in mine, and I also did 425° for 20 minutes.  It came out nearly perfect.  I added a tad bit of lemon juice then had some leftover grated parmesan cheese that I sprinkled over the top after it was finished cooking.  The oven was still hot but off, but I threw it back in to keep it warm while I worked on the main dish and other sides.  Worked great!  It's a very easy yet elegant side dish.

I will be making this again!  Very tasty, and I normally only tolerate broccoli. I had frozen broccoli that comes in the steamer bags from Costco, so I heated it for 2.5 minutes in the microwave to thaw it. I then added the olive oil and some Montreal Steak spice, per other reviews, directly to the bag to toss it together. 400 degrees for 18 minutes seemed perfect. It was tender, but not mushy.

We love broccoli. This was easy to prepare and I liked the tasted of roasted broccoli.  I did add an extra 1/2 Tablespoon of oil as suggested by some of the reviews. I will make this recipe again.

My family loved it! I added a tablespoon minced garlic to the black pepper and olive oil mixture to add a smokey flavor but I was extremely surprised at the hits of sweetness I tasted. Delish!

Just made this for our evening meal.  Baked mine for 20 minutes and used garlic salt instead of regular salt.  But used the olive oil and pepper and like some else reviewed ...  just add the oil right in the pan instead of having a bowl to wash.  Love this way of eating broccoli.  Yum!

I love broccoli and until recently I was only boiling/steaming it.  This recipe was quick,  and simple.  I made a few changes in the seasoning (I used some Chicago Steak season,  lemon pepper,  and new Orleans cajun) and the amount of oil (Two and a half tbsps). I also opted for using frozen broccoli (took about 30 minutes instead of 18). It turned out tasty and great.  I have a new way of cooking broccoli!

These were great. I used garlic salt instead or regular salt to add a bit more flavour. I also roasted at 425F so it could share the oven with another dish, so cut the time down to 15 min. Delicious and easy.

this was the perfect simple dish i was looking for.. i think this recipe showcases the amount of time and temp more than what ingredients to use.. given that, i used 1.5 T garlic flavored oil.. specifically Tsang's as me and bf have an affection towards the Rootboy on youtube and he uses this on everything.. added 1 tsp of montreal steak seasoning like others suggested in place of the S&P.. baked exactly for 18 min's and didn't have any issues with it burning.. this is best enjoyed straight out of the oven.. ty for the recipe

My kids love this dish, and getting them to eat veggies is a struggle.  The only thing I changed is that I use sesame oil instead of olive oil.

Easy, delicious, I'll make it again.  I combined the ingredients and threw them in a foil pocket and roasted them on the top shelf of my barbecue.  Really good.
