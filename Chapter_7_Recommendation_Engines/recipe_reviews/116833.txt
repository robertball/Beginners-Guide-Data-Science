This had a great flavor and made my house smell wonderful.  The only drawback of this recipe is that it was a little too sweet for my taste (and I love sweet things).  Next time I'll try leaving out the sugar and I'm sure it will be perfect.

A great, "dressed up" apple cider for special occasions (like New Year's Eve parties!). I too used less sugar. Just taste it before adding it and add by the tablespoon until you reach your preferred sweetness.

I served this at my daughter-in-law's baby shower....we'd just had an ice storm, and this warmed our spirits!  
Everyone loved it!

We have a new baby in the house and when a cold snap hit right after he came home, this was easy and simple to serve guests who dropped by. I completely forgot the sugar in the first batch and never added it to the others. It's a keeper!!

Perfect! I made it over and over this Christmas!  This will be come a tradition for our holidays!  I did not make any changes!

Updated: 5 years later and we still love this wassail. As you near the bottom of the cup there are a lot of ground spices in your cup, so I decided to use whole cinnamon sticks and whole cloves and put it in the crock pot for sever all hours.  Then the wassail is flavored with out the ground up spices in the punch.
