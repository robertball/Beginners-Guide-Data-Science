First, I gave this recipe only four stars simply because, while it turned out wonderfully and everyone loved it (Did a dry run cake by recipe exactly and it was gone in 50 minutes at work), but it did not have the exact flavor I was looking for.  With that said, this is a great recipe.  It was literally my first attempt at baking from scratch and with a few adjustments, I have truly found my carrot cake for life!!  Adjustments I made include:  no coconut (hate'em), 8oz can of pineapple with juice, whole wheat flour instead of white, replace one cup of white sugar with light brown and additional 1/4 teaspoon of vanilla (be sure to use pure vanilla extract, not imitation), add 1 teaspoon of allspice, 1/3 cup of oil and 1/2 cup of sour cream, 2/3-3/4 cup of raisins, and finally, I lightly sauteed my shredded carrots in a bit of unsalted butter, 1/4 cup sugar and sprinkle of cinnamon and set it aside.  I use this with the Cream Cheese II icing on this board (less the unsalted butter used to sautee the carrots).  Several people stated it was the best carrot cake they have ever tasted.  But, more importantly, it had the full combination of flavors I was looking for, nothing overpowered and it had a full, warm taste.  It was a cake I would eat or serve without the icing, but the icing is a perfectly compliment.  Because it suited my particular tastes, I'd give my recipe five stars, but I wouldn't have found mine without yours.  My sincere thanks to you.  Who knew I could bake!!!

Oh, how I wish there was an option of 10 stars! This recipe is awesome! It is extremely easy as well. I made one late the other night and the next day while I was at work my mom had the first piece. She called me up and said, "Angela, don't ever make this again!...I can't stop eating it. This is the best carrot cake I've ever had.". And believe me, if anybody knows carrot cake, its my mom, its her favorite. Then, I made another for work, and one guy just raved about it. I can't tell you how many compliments this cake gets. And its sooo easy. The batter is ready in 10 minutes (15 if you grate the carrots by hand). Cooking time was right on. It even came out well in one of those cheap alluminun pans you get for like $1.50 at the grocery store. The only thing I changed was I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple in its own juice(although I didn't realize until after the fact, it came out so well, I will continue to use this size). Also, the frosting was delicious, but I used one batch of frosting for both cakes, so if you only make one, start with half the recipe for frosting.

I have made this recipe more than a few times and it has turned out consistenty and reliably well each time.  Not too sweet, too dense, oily or spicy as some carrot cakes can be.  The frosting is a tried and true basic cream cheese frosting.  Easy to mix and fool proof, this could easily be your go-to carrot cake recipe.  I baked this as cupcakes - 1/2 recipe yields 12 cupcakes, 350 degrees, 25 minutes.

This carrot cake is the best in the whole world. The cake is especially moist, and the frosting is very creamy and sweet. I think if you're looking for a delicous carrot cake, i think you've found it! :)

Amazingly simple and so delicious.  I've made it twice for two different groups and it's a crowd pleaser.  Nothing left but crumbs.  I'm not a coconut fan, so I skipped the coconut and used 3 cups of carrots instead of 2, but all else I followed to the letter.  This one's a keeper!

My fiance LOVES carrot cake, and yesterday was his birthday so I decided to look for a carrot cake recipe.  He was very specific that he wanted pineapple, coconut and lots of nuts in his carrot cake.  I made this cake with a few modifications and he LOVES it!  Says that it rivals his favorite carrot cake recipe.  And he took some to work today and got rave reviews as well!  Here are the modifications I made:  I used 1 cup white sugar and 1 cup brown sugar, I only used 1/2 cup of canola oil, I used 1 cup regular flour and 1 cup whole wheat flour, I used 3/4 cup chopped walnuts AND 3/4 cup chopped pecans, and I added several teaspoons (six or so?) of pineapple juice (from the crushed pineapple) to the frosting.  I'm sure this will get made again soon!

This cake came out especially moist and delicious. It was a hit, however the cake is very busy and it has nuts and chews in every bite! If you want a mellow carrot cake, please do not try this recipe..

I wish I could give this more stars! This was the BEST carrot cake I've ever made! Came out so moist and with perfect flavor. I did leave out the coconut because my kids won't eat it, and I used a 20 ounce can of pineapple because I wasn't paying attention. I liked it so much, I'll keep those changes. Also, I made it as a layer cake with 2 8inch pans, and I've never had a cake come out so perfectly even. Try it with this icing instead: 2 blocks cream cheese (8 oz each, has to be regular because low fat itsn't stiff enough), 1/2 cup butter softened (beat with cream cheese until smooth), 2 cups powdered sugar (add gradually), 1 teaspoon vanilla, amaretto to taste. PERFECTION!!

While this was a very good cake, I rate it 4 stars. It was very moist and/but heavy. This was just not the best carrot cake I have ever had. I made it exactly to the recipe except for substituting in pecans. The frosting was excellent and I will make that again. My guests did ask for a piece to take home with them though! :-)

I was going to make this for my anniversary because it sounded very nice. The batter seemed perfect but when it came to baking it, it never set. It was carrot pudding and i had to throw it away. I wouldnt recommened this recipe to anyone.

Loved this cake!  My husband said it was the best he's tried. Other than adding raisins, I followed the recipe and baked it in 2 9 in cake pans for 45 mins.  It was moist, not overly sweet, and had a nice texture.  I've shared it with friends and family and will make it again.

This is EXACTLY what I was looking for in a carrot cake! I usually go to the natural food store and get their vegan carrot cake, but they quit making it all year around. I tried this recipe, and it tastes even better than what I got at the store. (No, I'm not vegan, but replace the eggs and dairy milk and my vegan friend said it's still fantastic) I also added a 1/2 teaspoon ground red pepper to the frosting, because I like sweet and spicy.

Tasty cake! I'm all about the pineapple instead of raisins. The pineapple came in a 20 oz can, and I used all it. Omitted the coconut (not a fan of flaked coconut) and added another cup of grated carrots instead and put a couple tablespoons of pineapple juice in the butter cream frosting.  I'll make it again and recommend it to my friends.

I was looking for a no-raisin, spiced carrot cake recipe.  As I mixed this recipe, I expected it to be heavy as a brick, but I had faith in the rave reviews I saw and they are here for good reason.  This is the best carrot cake ever.  I first made it with the frosting recipe included, but that was way too sweet.  When I substituted Cream Cheese Frosting II, it became not just great, but perfect!  We were at a party last night and now I know everyone's birthday because they want this cake.

Oh my! Best carrot cake ever!! I added golden raisins and used pecans instead of walnuts, but those were the only changes I made. I also baked in two 9" rounds, for about 40 minutes. I took the advice of others and used Cream Cheese Frosting II, which made this just about the most perfect thing I've ever made.

There were so many people that rated this as 5 star that I tried it. Not once but twice in the same day. BOTH times the cake came out doughy, yak! I thought the first time I did something wrong. The second time I was much more careful and even tested my oven temp. with an oven therm. I'm reluctant to blame the recipe BUT, it was expensive and awful.  I threw both cakes out.

This is not your traditional carrot cake but hands down absolutely delicious.  I doubled the recipe and made 4 round cakes, 2 - 8" and 2 - 10" as well as three full jumbo muffins. I didn't have 2 cups of walnuts and added just one, and added just about 2 full 20 oz. cans of crushed pineapple with the liquid, (which didn't effect the outcome at all). 

I sprayed Pam and dusted the pans before baking for about twenty minutes to a beautiful deep golden brown.  I would suggest definitely checking them with a toothpick as looks can be deceiving and no one wants a dry cake. 

The frosting recipe filled the two layer cakes and just about covered the 8" two tiered cake, covered the 10" layer cake and I had a little left over to pipe a border (I posted a pic of the ten inch layer cake completed).  Next time I would make a half recipe more to have more left over for piping. 

This tastes DELICIOUS chilled, much better than close to room temperature. I made these for birthdays so I had a slice last night and a taste this morning and it definitely is better served cold. 

I would mess with this much, maybe next time add a little allspice, that's it. Enjoy!

As usual I did not have all the ingredients so I substituted a couple of things.  I used sour cream instead of buttermilk and I used raisens instead of the nuts.  Cake was very moist and tasty.  The frosting was perfect with it.  Next time I will not use the raisens.

Made this for a wedding reception.  It was a hit!  Use the Whipped Cream Cream Cheese frosting recipe if you are making a sheet cake.  That way, the frosting flavor won't overpower the wonderful flavors contained in this cake.  Beautiful recipe!!

I loved this recipe.  I accidentally did not drain the pineapple and after the 2 cups of flour it was a little watery for batter, and thought it was ruined.  BUT, after about a half cup of flour more and a pinch more salt and baking soda, it turned out fine.  Not just fine, but amazing.  Also, I like raisins in my carrot cake and added a half cup to this recipe.  Cooked in two 9" round pans instead of a 9x13.  It was done at 52 minutes, and it was PERFECT!!  Dense, moist, and absolutely delicious.  It was the hit of my dinner party.  Personally, I have to wonder if the pineapple juice made the cake.

This was by far the BEST carrot cake I've ever had. It was super moist and delicious!  I made it for a co-workers birthday.  I was a little nervous about baking a cake for the gang without testing on friends and family first (especially after reading the review where it was the most god-awful thing she's ever tasted), but it was a hit!  Everyone is still raving about it and I made it 2 weeks ago!!

I followed another reviewers suggestion and added a 20oz can of pineapple and a splash of pineapple juice.

The cake turned out fabulous. I made a few changes, though. My cake came out very moist and delicious, by accident too! I didn't read it correctly, and I didn't drain the pineapple, and I added a little too much milk, maybe less than a 1/4 cup. 

Also, it's a very big cake, so it will last for a good week+; I would suggest it for a party; your guests will be delighted. =)

We love this recipe.  I added 1/4 cup sugar, 2 cups coconut, 3tsp cinnamon.  I also add nutmeg, cloves and ginger.  Lastly, I increased the cream cheese to 2 packages.  Delish!

This was a great cake, but I do think I will cut back on the oil to 1/2 cup.  Our personal preference was the texture was just a little too greasy.  I also soaked raisins in boiling water while I did everything for the cake and added them in at the end. Thanks for sharing!

OMG!!!! I can't say anything that hasn't already been said. I made just as stated, except that I only had 1/2 C of walnuts, and 1/2 C of pecans so that's what I used (I couldn't really tell, but the cake was so good I will probably do this again next time)! This was one of the best carrot cakes I have ever had. I dream about this cake. Be sure to drain the pineapple very well. I put mine in a mesh stainer and push it down with a spoon to get all the juice out.

I had to do changes on this recipe like I do on most because of High Altitude. I decreased the sugar by 1/4 cup and the baking soda to 1 3/4 teaspoon. I increased the flour to 2 1/2 cups and I increased the oil to 3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons and 3/4 + 3 tablespoons cup buttermilk instead of just 3/4 cup also double the vanilla that is called for.

really good!  next time i will use less sugar, add one more carrot, and slightly saute them first.  The coconut and pineapple are a staple in a deliciously moist carrot cake! jus sayin.

Simply outstanding...better than the best cake I've had!  So moist and rich it almost doesn't need frosting!  I took some previous comments and made changes also...changed oil to 1/2 cup, addded 1/4 cup sour cream for more moisture, added 1/2 cup raisins due to preference, so to compensate I just took a little out of the pineapple and coconut portions.  The first batch I had to make without coconut and it was still fantastic.  No complaints!

This cake was excellent.  I will not try any other recipes because this is what I was looking for in a carrot cake.  It was moist and baked up perfectly.  I did not use coconut, and was afraid of the pineapple because I didn't know if people would like it or not.  I'm so glad I used the pineapple because I think it may have been what made it so moist.  You really couldn't even taste it.  I also used 1/2 cup oil rather than 3/4.  It didn't  seem to need all of it (maybe could have even used less).  I also used the joy of cooking recipe for the frosting.  YUM YUM YUM

This was an amazing carrot cake! I have never heard of adding pineapple or coconut, but it came out deliciously. I made it for Christmas, as thought carrot cake seemed a good Christmas type of cake, sweet flavors but not to heavy.  I poured my batter into two 9 inch cake pans and they baked up perfectly! the cake was heavy and moist. But the fact it was a dense/heavy cake made it easy to feed many people, as you don't need a big slice.  The cream cheese frosting with this recipe went perfectly. I did piping on the edges and a nice spiral pattern, got rave reviews for looks and taste! My family and friends loved it!

This is very good! I didn't change a thing. Very moist, and yummy. I didn't have the proper sized pan and I ended up with a lot of frosting leftover -- but that gives me a good excuse to make some cookies to finish that off!

I made this recipe as cupcakes for a fellow teacher at the preschool where I work.  I made them this way so our class could easily celebrate her birthday.  She raved about them and wanted the recipe. Even the 3-year olds LOVED these cupcakes!  One even said...you are the best cooker ever! This is probably the best carrot cake I have ever had.  I would not make them as cupcakes again, only because they do not rise enough even when filling the cups all the way, so they look a little scimpy for cupcakes (although they were still quite adequate as a serving). But they tasted so good, I will definitely add this to my permanant collection and make again and again (in a regular cake pan).  Frosting was fantastic!

I did not have coconut or walnuts available, so I put in extra carrots to make up the difference. I am sure it would have been incredible without the poor cook's substitution, but even without this was a killer recipe. The cake is amazingly sweet and moist, and I think that a lot of the credit is due to the pineapple. This is not just the best carrot cake I have ever eaten, but it is the best cake period.

Great recipe...baking time was accurate and the flavor was great.  I added a handful of golden raisins and some allspice and freshly ground nutmeg.  Also a little lemon juice is a great secret ingredient in the cream cheese frosting.  Very moist and perfect balance of spices.  This what carrot cake is meant to be!

I made this cake for my husband for Valentine's Day, since carrot cake is his favorite.  I was skeptical about things like pineapple and coconut, but the resulting cake was moist and delicious, and my husband thought it was amazing - one of the best carrot cakes he has ever had!  Clearly, I will be making this one again!

This is an amazing cake ! My carrot cakes are never moist and the carrots and other fruits always end up in the bottom. This time it was different, this recipe is great. My boyfriend was happy with it too.
I made a few changes like doing one and a half cup of sugar and the other half of brown sugar. Since i dont like walnuts nor coconut i ignored them, and then i crushed the pineapples in the mixer.
LOVED IT

excellent carrot cake!!! I made mini cup cakes and won 1st place in my office bake-off. If you plan on making cupcakes make sure to chop up the pineapple a bit more and use finely chopped pecans. I used toasted coconut on top ... YUM!

HEAVY/DENSE: I didn't read the reviews so I didn't know that it was so dense. It's like a fruit cake. Not what anyone was expecting, but other communities have carrot cakes like this, I see.

This recipe did not work for me. The only thing I did differently was use fresh pineapple which I chopped in a blender (but didn't       drain). The batter seemed wet, so I even added a bit more flour, but the end result was still a carrot pudding rather than a cake. I'm an experienced baker so I'm not sure what happened. The taste was decent, though.

I think everyone has their favorite type of carrot cake, and this one is mine.  This cake comes out moist, chunky and not overly-spiced.  The icing is rich and creamy, and there is plenty of it.

I had to substitute milk/lemon juice for buttermilk (not a staple here in Japan), but it turned out fabulous, just the same.

All in all, pert near perfect!

This was one of the BEST carrot cakes I have ever had! It seemed like a lot of "extra" stuff added, so if you are looking for a very basic carrot cake, this is not the recipe to use. But I found the addition of pineapple, the pineapple juice & coconut to really compliment the taste & the pineapple is what makes it so moist & soft. The batter seemed sort of runny, but it baked & rose perfectly. Everyone who has tried this has asked for the recipe & requested more! The only thing I would suggest- do NOT use all of the frosting! The frosting tasted great, but there was just toooo much of it for the cake. I left the rest in a side dish for others to add more if they wanted. But this is a keeper- thank you for the great recipe!

This is my absolute go-to recipe for carrot cake and cream cheese frosting. With that said, I must say that 15 oz of pineapple is too much for making a traditional round cake with more than one layer, as it is too moist and will cause the top layer to collapse. 

A word of advice for more flavor - split white sugar into half and use brown sugar as the other for more depth. Drain and pat the pineapple well to ensure that the cake doesn't topple. Sift the flour to create more air in the cake since a whisk can only do so much. Refrigerate for 4 hours or overnight if making cake layers and don't bother trying to make the frosting absolutely smooth - cutting the cake to make smooth sides WILL NOT WORK. There are too many thick, chunky components to do so. 

As cupcakes, the amount of pineapple in this recipe will do well. Everyone that knows my cakes agrees that this recipe is hands down the best carrot cake ever. Thank you, Marc, for adding it to the website!

Not the best ever but good. I would give it 3.5 stars for flavor but I love the moistness of it so leaned to 4 stars. My husband, on the other hand, said it's the best carrot cake he has ever had so there's another reason for 4 stars. I made it exactly as written. I don't care for the texture created by the coconut so I will leave it out next time. Still it seems like something is missing...just can't quite put my finger on it. The frosting is absolutely perfect.

Great recipe! Came out perfectly! The cream cheese frosting really compliments the cake. I added a couple of drops of lemon juice to the frosting as suggested by another person and I agree, it added just a bit of a zing! This recipe is a keeper!

I made this for my Dad's 50th birthday party, and it was a HUGE hit.  I did make a couple changes to the recipe.  1) I added raisins.  2) I only used coconut in the cake I made (as not everyone in my family likes it).  I did mini cupcakes without coconut, and baked for about 20 minutes.  I made a round cake in a corningware dish, baked for 1hr 20 minutes, split through middle, and added a layer of cream cheese icing.  These cupcakes/cake were moist and delicious both ways prepared!

Turning out quite nice. I subbed in chuncky apple sauce for the pineapple. I think the topper is the frosting, without it the cake is very mild, not very sweet and doesn't taste much like carrot to me at all, but still good.

I made this for my grandson's birthday, as Carrot Cake is his favorite.  This was a big hit with the whole family!  It is a heavy, very moist cake.  The family said that the frosting was too sweet, but that was remedied easily by scraping some of the frosting off.  I will make this again, but I will add more spice (cardamom) this time to give it a little more spice taste, and less sugar in the frosting.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe.

I made my first carrot cake with this recipe for my husband's birthday cake. It is VERY rich so if you're looking for a light and fluffy cake, this is not it: one small piece was plenty for each birthday guest. As other raters mentioned, the texture of this cake is different than most carrot cakes that I've had---it's really moist but it is dense. It calls for grated carrots, but I put them in my chopper instead of grating them. That worked just fine. I would definately make this one again.

Recipe was very good.  Made the frosting w/ 3 cups of sugar instead of four and it was plenty sweet.  Didn't have any trouble w/ the cake being dense like some other reveiws.

Thank you Marc for an easy and tasty recipe for carrot cake.  Right now, I have only given it 3 stars, but after experimenting with the recipe over the next few days, I may come back and edit my review.  The only thing I did differently, as far as ingredients, with the cake was use a 20 ounce can of crushed pineapple and I substituted pecans for the walnuts.  The cake was the perfect amount of sweetness and spice and flavor.  I was however disappointed in the texture of the cake.  It was tough and didn't rise much at all.  It is probably mostly due to my fault (used a 15X10 pan instead of a 13X9).  Next time, I will either bake a little less time or use the smaller pan.  I might try adding a tsp of baking powder as well to see if it will help.  I did not make the frosting that was published with this recipe, but used the Cream Cheese Frosting II on this website (highly recommend that one!).

To make this a bit lighter,I beat the egg yolks and whites separately.Carefully fold in the whites.It came out excellent.

Game changer! Truly amazing!! I have a reputation because of this cake! Great with walnuts or pecans. I use applesauce instead of oil...something I do on just about all baking recipes. With my oven it takes over an hour to bake. You can't go wrong here. 
OHH final note- I won 2nd place in the state fair with this recipe :)

I have made this cake a dozen times.  It is fantabulous.  Unbelievably moist.  I have had people tell me they hate carrot cake but absolutely love this cake.  I don't drain the pineapple and this makes it extra moist. It is the best cake I have ever had.

This was the best carrot cake ever!  The only things I did different was that I added a tsp of all spice and I did half white sugar and half brown sugar.  I made this for my dad for his 69th birthday and everyone devoured it!  I did have to bake it about 15 min longer that it called for.

This recipe is AWESOME!!! Im a big fan of carrot cake and a baking perfectionist and I tip my hat to this recipe. The only suggestion I have is making the sugar only 1.5 cups. Its still sweet but not overly. I made this recipe into cupcakes so that I could do some without nuts for my niece who is allergic and they all came out beautiful! Next time I"ll try making it into a tiered cake. Look NO FURTHER for a Carrot Cake recipe, THIS IS IT!

I followed this recipe as written and the five stars is for the cake....wonderfully light, moist and flavorful. Could also be made in to a very pretty layer cake rather than baked as directed. I did not care for the cream cheese frosting, preferring more cream cheese and less sugar. The frosting would rate 3 stars from me.

Easy to make but it turned out to be too wet of a consistency.  It was rubbery/chewy.  My family said it was good but also a bit weird to them.  I will not bake this recipe again.

THIS WAS DELICIOUS!!!! My first time making a cake from scratch and this was absolutely delicious I will be making again. I sauteed my shredded carrots from the store in butter first to make sure they wouldn't be crunchy. I also added a 1/4 t of nutmeg and I used hazlenuts instead of walnuts because thats what I accidently got instead. It was still so yummy I used pillsbury cream cheese frosting. And it was even better the second day!

Wonderful Carrot Cake.  I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out PERFECT!  I baked it in 2 x 9 inch rounds at 350 for 45 minutes.  Thanks for the great addition to my collection.

This tasted good. Not oily. This baked at 45 minutes for me in a springform pan. I thought that was a little too long. The icing is good, but a bit sweet. I made this for Easter!

I have baked many carrot cakes in all my years and this is the best by far. It was a huge hit with my family for Easter dessert and not a morsel left. Thank you for a great recipe. I made it with the exact ingredients but used 2 - 9" round pans and baked for 40 minutes.

Was exactly what I was looking for in a Carrot Cake recipe! My other half said it was as good as his grandma's which is a huge compliment. Everyone raved about how moist it was.

This recipe was wonderful!! I didn't put coconut and substituted pecans for walnuts. I also added a bit of the pineapple juice, that I drained from cake, to my frosting. Wonderful will make again and again.

I love this recipe. Is truly a favorite for the family and guests. It is very moist and delicious. I added some orange zest to the dough and to the frosting. I also don't use as much sugar as it is required for the dough and for the frosting.

Made this for a teen sleepover. Very very moist. I would have followed it exactly but my niece doesn't like coconut so we omitted it. Everyone LOVED it!! We frosted only half of it cause the other half was gone by the time it cooled down. All the girls took this address with them so they can save this recipe and make again with their families.

I got so many compliments with this one!  The only change I made was to leave out the coconut (my sister-in-law doesn't like it) and replaced it with an extra cup of carrots.

This was a great cake, and very easy except for grating the carrots. I definately need a food processor, I grated carrots for 1/2 an hour. The work was worth it though I took this cake to a graduation party and everyone raved it was so moist and flavorful

Great cake recipe.  I'm asked to make this often by family and friends. Makes 30 cupcakes, enough to go around the circle.

Absolutely the BEST Carrot Cake that I have ever had!!!  I couldn't find 15oz cans of pineapple, so I used 20oz.  I also baked it in a jelly roll pan.  After it cooled, I cut it in half to make a layer cake.  It also made 12 cupcakes.  Because I was making a layer cake, I made 1 1/2 recipes of frosting.  Perfect!!!

This carrot cake was SO delicious!  One of the best I've ever had and it was easy to make.  My husband is very fussy about his food so I didn't think he would like it because it has a lot of texture, lots of chunks and bits in it, but he loved it!  His only complaint was that the icing was too sweet.  I don't even think it needed frosting though, it was was that good!

This cake was THE best cake I've ever had, let alone made. It has a tropical fruity flavour thanks to the coconut and pineapple. I added coconut essence and pineapple juice to the cream cheese icing too- YUMMY!

This recipe is of "bakery quality".  I added raisins and pecans to the recipe and made it in cake pans to serve as a layer cake.  I highly recommend this cake for anyone who is a "carrot-cake" lover.

I only used a quarter of a stick of butter for the frosting, I don't think it needed any more than that.  I made them into cupcakes, and they only needed to go in the oven for about 30 minutes.  Came out perfect!

This was awesome carrot cake!  Made exactly as written except left out the coconut (hubby is not a fan) and left some of the juice in the pineapple (just let the juice drain out of the can, didn't squish it down).  VERY moist and loved the chunkiness of it!  Very rich though with the frosting--a small piece is more than enough!  But SO good!

This is the best recipe.  I am not a fan of Carrot cake, but my husband loves it.  I made it for his birthday and he LOVED it.  I LOVED it too and am now a fan of Carrot cake as long as it is made from this recipe.  100 STARS!!!!

This is the very best Carrot Cake our family has ever had. I made just a few changes. I added 1/2 cup more carrots, 1/2 cup more walnuts, a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple drained. I used three 9" round cake pans, spraying them with olive oil and then putting a round parchment paper in the bottom fo the pan. Since I have used the Cream Cheese icing on other cakes and was familiar with it, I used 1 lb of butter, 1 lb of cream cheese and 4 cups of confectioner's sugar. You will have icing left over. I topped with chopped walnuts.

I love this Carrot Cake! Finally, here is an actual Carrot Cake and not a Spice Cake with a little bit of carrot shavings in it! I added 1/2 Cup of softened/drained Raisins and some powdered Nutmeg and Cloves to taste (just to give the Cinnamon a little kick). I baked it as a Sheet Cake and it came out perfectedly; it was wonderfully and moist and heavy. And of course the Cream Cheese Frosting is my family's favorite and needs no further adjusting...unless you want to double it!

This was the BEST carrot cake I have ever had. I have made it twice already and it is so moist. I also like to sprinkle the top of the icing with the leftover coconut. It makes a great touch! Thank you for the recipe!

The first time I tried this cake, the frosting slid off the cake when I cut into it.  Also, the consistency wasn't right.  But I had a feeling that I should give it another try before rating it and deciding to move on.  I'm so glad I did.  It came out perfectly the second time.  This is truly some awesome cake!

Great recipe!  Everyone loved it!  I read many recipes where someone had to change this or that.  I didn't change anything about this one except to bake it in a couple of spring-form pans and put a thin layer of the cream cheese frosting between the 2 cake layers.

This carrot cake is wonderful!!!   I am constantly getting requests for this cake.  Everyone says that it reminds them of their grandmother's cake.  I omit the coconut and add about a cup of raisins.  I always make it as a layer cake and therefore prepare 1.5x the frosting.

This was awesome, everyone loved it and wanted to take some home.
I made a few changes, only because I did not want the nuts, and coconut in it. I also used sour cream instead of buttermilk as suggested by another reviewer. Also I thought 2 cups of sugar was a bit much, I used 1 cup sugar and 1 cup of splenda, I might even try all splenda next time.
As I said awesome, very moist and delish. You will not have any leftovers!!

The best carrot cake I've had in a long time - definitely worth making.  This is a lot of frosting, and on the sweet side - next time I'll reduce the sugar in frosting for more of a cream cheese taste.

I want to give this cake 4 1/2 stars because I don't give out 5 star ratings very often. It was really nice, especially with the cream cheese icing in the Joy of Cooking. Moist and flavorful. This was my first attempt at carrot cake, so I was fairly impressed with it. I think maybe my taste has been too conditioned on boxed carrot cake...the slight chunkiness wasn't the best for me.

Both my husband and I were terribly disappointed with this cake. However, I still give it a 4 star as it is most likely a personal preference as opposed to a flaw with the recipe. Neither of us liked the texture of the pineapple in the cake and felt it was too overpowering. I will keep looking for a cake that suits our tastes.

Very tasty! I chose to make this in two 9" pans and stacked them.  I displayed it on a cake stand. It makes just the right amount of frosting if you do it this way.  Like one reader said, there is a lot of "chunkiness" to this cake.  I made it with raisins instead of coconut because that's what I had on hand. It was very good.  I like a slightly lighter cake but this wasn't terribly dense. I would certainly make again.

Not only was this recipe excellent it give me a great base to make a "morning glory cake". All I had to do was change the 2 tsp of cinnamon to 1 tsp of cinnamon and 1 tsp of nutmeg (yes I really love nutmeg)and add 1 cup of raisins. No other changes were made, the cooking time remained the same

Very dependable recipe.  The only changes I made, was to add a quarter tsp. cloves, a bit of nutmeg and some freshly ground ginger along with the cinnamon.  It's my daughter's favorite spice combination and adapts very well with this cake.  It's her birthday and I make her a carrot cake every year.  She LOVES this cake.

WOW!   This was the best carrot cake we have ever tasted!   We did make one change by accident.  I grated up an entire bag of carrots (1 LB?) and had them in a bowl for my wife to measure out the 2 cups.  She thought I had already measured out the 2 cups and threw in the entire bowl.  I would have guessed it was closer to 3, maybe even 3.5 cups.   The cake was so moist and delicious!    Will make this again for sure.

I really love this carrot cake and it's was very moist and delicious. I did make some changes. Instead of using regular flour and used wheat flour. I added 2 cups of brown sugar instead of white sugar. I didn't add them coconuts because I didn't have any.  This cake smells so good and had to cut me a slice. OMGoodness. I didn't make the cream cheese icing because I like the cake without it. Will be making this again.

I so appreciate your sweet, sublime carrot cake recipe submission. I took a few liberties with ingredients, including the addition of a few ounces of raisins. First I mixed the raisins with the pineapple juice over a low heat in a small sauce pan for a minute or two.  After, I drained the raisins and added them to the wet mixture. I also used smaller quantities of the coconut, pineapple, and carrots. I substituted pecans for walnuts. I added a dash of pumpkin spice. Finally, for my frosting, I replaced the plain cream cheese with a brown sugar cinnamon flavor. My cake baked in about half the time. Thank you !

I've substituted pecan with Walnut. Used brown sugar instead of white sugar and reduced it by half. Other than that, I've followed the recipe to T.

I love the ultra moist carrot cake and my 3yo can't stop eating it. Its a lovely recipe for the cake, despite it being all greasy.

My only complain is the ridiculous amount of confectioner sugar required for the cream cheese frosting. My heart literally stopped when I realised that I needed to empty 1 bag of sugar for it. And the frosting turns out to be crazily sweet.

Did a quick search after that and realised that there is a healthier version and I'm definitely gonna try that next time.

I had a great recipe for carrot cake many years ago and somewhere along the line lost it.  It's ok though, this one will be my number one recipe from now on.  I did make a few adjustments, however.  Being a diabetic I cut back the sugar to half of what the recipe calls for.  I couldn't taste any difference.  Next time I will also cut back on the amount of frosting...I have enough for two cakes!

Will absolutely make this again!  My family adored it. I followed the recipe almost to a tee, but decided to add the pineapple juice to both the batter and frosting. I used two spring form pans and frosted in between the layers. It was adorable and delicious. So moist!

100% perfect recipe.  I made this exactly as written and it could not have been any better. (actually, I omitted the nuts, sorry)  Just the right moistness and even crumb. I have been searching for the right recipe for years and this is it. I made it into cupcakes and it made 23. I will recommend this to everyone.

This cake is GREAT. Made it yesterday for my mom's birthday, and half is already gone! Everybody loved it. But, there was lots of icing leftover. I also used a bunt pan, and trust me, LET IT COOL FOR AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR. Breaks otherwise. Twisted the recipe a little, adding allspice and cloves to the dry ingredients.  Very good, and very carroty. Recommending this to all my friends!

Thanks for this recipe..the cake was so moist and do not taste carrot at all..my officemates liked it esp the cream cheese frosting so i got many orders from them.. I just made some adjustment to the cream cheese frosting, i use 1.5c confectioners sugar so you can still taste the creaminess of cream cheese.

Thank you so much for sharing the fantastic recipe. It was soooo easy that I was scared I was doing something incorrect as I am not a baker. I even added some raisins as I did not have coconut. I would recommend this to everyone.

Tried this recipe but changed baking temp  to 275F for 50 minutes and it came out really moist and yummy. We don't like really sweet cakes so sugar reduced to 1.25 cups, and carrots doubled to 4 cups.  We'll make it again

I followed the recipes to a tee, so--no changes were made. I decided to make cupcakes, so had to guess on the baking time.  The cupcakes never rose--and in fact, deflated when taken out of the oven.  I thought I might have undercooked them, but they were definitely cooked.  I baked them for 25 minutes.  I was disappointed in the lack of rise in them, and then how dense they were.  Taste wise, they were very tasty--just not what I think of as Carrot cake.

I was so happy with this how recipe turned out.  Carrot cake is one of my favorite desserts so I had high expectations for this baking venture and I was not disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly for the most part...I did omit the coconut (only because one of the people I was making it for has an aversion, I'm sure it would have been a delicious addition) and use about 1/4 cup more grated carrots (for a half recipe).  I also used pecans instead of walnuts because I had some to use.  Delicious and I will definitely make this again.

I make a bunny cake every Easter ( a tradition in the family) Thought I would make a carrot cake from scratch this year and came across this recipe.  This will be a keeper!!  I followed the recipe and only changed the walnut ingredient to pecans ( I had a big bag in the freezer) The cake turned out moist and the frosting was perfect and easy to work with.  Next time I make this cake I might add a little more spice, with this being said the cake is perfect as is with the 2 tsp of cinnamon if you like a lightly spiced cake. I like the chunky texture of the nuts, coconut, and pineapple. I am adding this to my recipe box now.  Thank you Marc for the yummy recipe! By the way, this recipe makes two perfect 9 inch round cakes. I only needed one for my bunny and froze the other one, with the left over frosting.  Can't wait to see how it taste after freezing.

I just can't say enough about this recipe.  Simply put, it is perfect. The most delicious and MOIST carrot cake I've ever had. (Due to family nut allergies, I omitted them from the recipe which may have even enhanced the other flavors and moisture.)

I've never made carrot cake anything before so this was a first time trial.  I made them into cupcakes instead of one big cake since it's easier to hand them out like that at work.

Very simple recipe, almost had everything on hand to make this, did NO substitutions or variations on ingredients nor measurements.  They turned out great.

Being they were cupcakes, I thought the cook time would be less, and it was, but only by about 10 min. (Be advised, I have a really crappy electric oven)  The toothpick in the middle was my timer.  

Will definitely make these again, the husband LOVED them, he's German and is used to a more dense cake than the fluffy American style.

Thanks for the recipe, it's definitely going in the recipe box!!

Made this for a co-workers birthday and everyone seemed to really like it.  I made it into cupcakes and it made over 24 cupcakes.  They didn't bake up a whole lot so next time I think I'll fill the cupcakes up with more batter before baking.  I also couldn't find a 15oz can of crushed pineapple so I just used two 8 oz cans of crushed pineapple and it still turned out great.  Very moist!

I made this yesterday for my mom-in-law's birthday, and it was a big hit with everyone that tried it; many had seconds!   We had the leftovers for breakfast this morning and it was even better. (The only reason we had leftovers is because we had people there that insist they hate carrot cake; wouldn't try it!)   The only changes I made were to use white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and I used organic cane sugar, which adds a little molasses taste.  So good!

I am NOT a baker, measuring is not for me, but this receipe was easy and AMAZING!  It was the first cake I've ever done from scratch, and I made it for my father's birthday.  Everyone raved and raved.  So moist and flavorful, without having too many elements.  I made 2 round cakes, and layerd them.  I highly recommend this recipe!

I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of subbing pecans for the walnuts (personal pref). I made cupcakes, and this recipe yielded about 30 cupcakes - bake on 350 for about 30 mins. Only gave 4 stars because it's a little heavy, I agree with other users that could use 1/3 less oil. If I make again will use less oil. I also used cream cheese frosting II from this site - which was a delicious combo. Will also use less than 1 cup nuts, i don't like a super nutty carrot cake.

I must admit im not a fan of carrot cake, but this recipe is amazing! I made vmy husband brizilan carrot and he did  not like it, So for valentines day i urprised him with this carrot cake. i had him close his eyes to try it. and he just moaned in delight! I have made this at least 3 times and have had numerous people try it and they all agree that its great. I add less then the recommened amount of walnuts to the batter. i add at least 1/2 of whats suggested but instead i add he remaining walnuts to the out side of the cake once its frosted near the rim.

I'm aware that the pineapple added to this recipe makes for a beautifully moist cake.  With that said, however, I found the amount of pineapple to be overwhelming.  With numerous chunks of pineapple in every bite, the end result was more like fruit cake! Some might like this textured abundance, but I'm more of a purist and prefer to taste more veggie than fruit in my carrot cake.  Maybe halving the amount of pineapple or not adding it will be better?  On a positive note, the frosting for this cake was FANTASTIC!

Wonderful carrot cake recipe! It's very moist and has a perfect balance of flavor. I did change a few things because of reviews though. I had originally planned on cutting down the oil to 1/2 a cup but forgot to. Then because of another review I added about 1/2 a cup of pineapple juice from the crushed pineapple and to balance the dry and wet ingredients i added a 1/2 cup of flour and a pinch of baking soda and salt and well as a dash of cinnamon to keep the the flavor. I also added about a 1/2 cup more carrot and a sprinkle more of coconut. The cake turned out delicious. TIP: halve the amount of confectioners sugar in the cream cheese frosting and it will do wonders! I also never added the butter by mistake but it didn't really affect anything. XD hope this helps!

Fabulous!  I love carrot cake, but had never made it before.  I was very pleased with how easy the recipe was and the cake was delightful.  Since my husband doesn't like coconut, I switched it out with raisins. Very good.

Really enjoyed this recipe.  First time I've ever made Carrot cake from scratch.  I did change the ingredients a little bit.  My family absolutely hates coconut! so I left that out and substituted some shredded Granny Smith apples.  I also added about a half cup of raisins just because my family likes it that way. Also, I baked it in a Bundt pan and decorated it to look like a Jack-o-lantern. (the stem is not cake) Thanks again.

So nice and moist..I just don't like nuts in my cake,so I cut the nuts and coconut out and instead added  3/4 cup flour ,sauteed the shredded carrots with 2 tablespoons butter and 1/4 c.sugar as Divajojo  review suggested, nd sprayed the cake with little amount of pineapple juice before frosting it..that way,it kept so moist and fresh for days..thank u for the wonderful recipe

Glory, glory hallelujah, this cake is delicious.  I followed the receipe exactly (except for the frosting), and I do believe it's the best carrot cake I've ever had.  I frosted the cake with "Whip Cream Cream Cheese Frosting" from Allrecipes, which was perfect.  Outstanding.  Heavenly.

I began to put this cake together and realized I did not have enough pineapple, nor did I have any coconut! I had already mixed the the sugar oil and eggs, so I had to do something. I had 2/3 cup of pineapple, and knew I needed at least 1.5 cups. So, I peeled a juicy pear, chopped it up really fine, and did the same with a very fragrant sweet apple. Together it made another 2/3 cup of fruit. I also decided to soak a cup of raisins in 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier and 2 tablespoons boiling water. When they had plumped up, I added them with the other fruit too. To the dry ingredients, I also added 1/4 tsp of grated nutmeg, along with 1 tsp grated orange zest and 1 tsp grated lemon zest. This cake was absolutely delicious! I will use this recipe over and over. Since my husband hates coconut, he appreciated it not being there, however, I think it would only have enhanced this recipe. I strongly urge anyone to try this cake.  My only criticism is that the frosting was a little bit too sweet, and I would look for a different cream cheese recipe for the the frosting.

I uses all palmsugar to replace the white sugar. 1 vanilla pod, and chopped almond since I dont have walnut on the shelves. 
the offside from this cake is the cream cheese, its overly sweet and potential for diabetes, I end up adding more and more cream cheese, and make a big batch of cream cheese spread

the second version I made is with buckwheat, I added chopped apple with raisins and walnut, this is the best.
Just I think it will be best if I mix it a lil with plain flour.

So good!  I gave it only 4 stars because it was WAY too sweet, IMO.  I actually made it with only 1.5 cups in the batter, and 3.5 in the frosting, which is already a reduction from the original recipe.  Next time I will make this with 1 cup in the batter, and no more than 2.5-3 cups in the frosting.  Love the moistness!

Fabulous cake. My first try at a homemade carrot cake. I followed the advice given in a few reviews. Substituted 1 c. brown sugar for 1 c.white, used more pineapple and used 1/2 c. whole wheat flour. Instead of using coconut in the cake, I followed the directions for decorating and made an egg nest with green coconut on top of the cake. My 3 yr. old grandson was delighted. Thank you!

Amazing!! Everyone loved this cake, it was gone withing the first hour! I made this cake for Easter this year because my mom requested a carrot cake. My husband isn't a big fan of carrot cake because of all the spices but this one made him get up for seconds. Very easy to make and had all the ingredients in my home. Buttermilk i used regular milk and just added 1 tsp of vinegar. Will make again in future.

This recipe is the best! It had excellent flavor, texture and raised nicely. Followed the instructions carefully except I used the "powdered buttermilk" you add water to for buttermilk; pecans instead of walnuts; and didn't use all 4 cups of confectioners sugar in frosting. If requests for this recipe are any indication the guests really liked it too! Thanks for sharing.

Delicious!  Very moist and tasty.  I followed one of the reviewers suggestions and used a slightly larger can of pineapple and it was excellent!  My picky 3 yr old loved 'em except for the nuts, he'd pick those out.    :)   Thanks for the recipe!

We are trying to watch sugar and fat so based on other reviews and our preferences, I made some changes to the recipe that will make it a real keeper in our household.  Upped flour to 3 cups, use 20 oz can crushed pineapple with the juice and 1 T. lemon juice and skipped the buttermilk, upped carrots to 3 c. and skipped coconut.  Also halved the frosting.  Felt healthier eating it this way so we enjoyed it without any guilt!

Great basic carrot cake, have made the cake twice and also cupcakes with it. The recipe for icing is far too large for just one cake though! Cut it in half, or use it for cupcakes!

Very moist but not very flavorful.  We left out the pineapple, so maybe that is why it was bland.  The frosting was perfect, however!

Almost perfect! The coconut is slightly overwhelming; which I didn't mind because I LOVE coconut! However, when I served this for a birthday party, the non-coconut lovers weren't as impressed as I was. Easily fixed by incresing the carrot to 3 cups and reducing the cocnut to 1/2 cup. This is also a VERY sweet cake so use the frosting sparingly.

I made this for Easter and the "carrot cake loving" members of the family loved it.  Even my daughter who is not a particular fan of carrot cake went back for a second piece.  The only modification I made was to add raisins.  Will definitely add this to my recipe box!  Also, I loved that it was so easy to make.

This is the best carrot cake I've ever had. Very soft and moist. Although I made a few changes. I grinded the carrots, pineapple and the coconut in a blender and then added them. For nuts I added walnut chips. This made the cake very smooth and soft. I couldn't get buttermilk so I added milk instead. Yet the cake was excellent.

This is a fantastic old fashioned carrot cake. The recipe doesn't need any changes, very moist, excellent flavor, perfect icing. The only thing I need to do next time is grate the carrots a little finer. And personally I like a three layered cake so I went with three round pans at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  Can't say enough, it turned out perfectly.

FANTASTIC carrot cake!  Made it for a birthday at work and folks raved!  I did leave out the coconut--i love it but knew not everyone at work may--and it was just fine without. Only snag was couldn't get the icing to set up/thicken.  Wound up adding an additional cup or better of powdered sugar beyond what the recipe called for and not much change.  It was still good, just kinda messy and had to be kept in the fridge or the icing ran all over.  GREAT RECIPE THOUGH!

This is the BEST carrot cake I have ever tasted, and my EXTREMELY discerning friend is a raving fan which means that this recipe definitely passes the test!  Look no further, this is it.   I will say that i did not use this recipe for the frosting.  i did this:  2 packages of cream cheese, and 2 sticks butter both at room temp, beat til creamy, add 16 oz. powdered sugar, and 2 tsp vanilla....that's the best frosting!    make this cake!!!

This is the BEST carrot cake recipe that I've come across! Yes it is moist and dense which is what an actual carrot cake is to be. I've take this cake to work and now everyone asks me to make it. Even have one co-worker who does not like carrot cake, but she will eat this one. The only change I have made to this recipes is that I decrease the sugar from 2 cups to 1 1/4 - 1 1/2 and use the whole can of crushed, drained pineapple.

Tried this recipe for Church coffee hour and it was a big hit. However in step 2 it said to add the vanilla twice.  Not paying attention I did so and the cake was still quite good.  I've tweeked it somewhat for less calories but basically it's still a great cake.

It seemed a little dry to me. I may have squeezed out too much of the pineapple juice. But, otherwise, fantastic!! Next time I will reduce the amount of salt too.

Lovely! I didn't have nuts or coconut so I left them out, and i added grated apple instead of the pineapple. also used yogurt instead of buttermilk, and added extra. baked it in a bundt pan for 40 minutes. This was so delicious, really moist and yummy :)

Fantastic!  I have made this 3 times now, and everyone I share it with has said it is the best carrot cake they have had in their lives.  I've even had 3 requests from friends to please make one for them for their birthday cake.  The first time I made it I did not have buttermilk, so I substituted sour cream.  It was great, so I make it that way every time.  I also double the cream cheese in the frosting (personal preference).  Thanks for the great recipe!

This recipe is a winner!  By far the best carrot cake I have ever eaten, and I order it often when we go out to dinner.  I made it and took it to work and it was devoured by the staff.

Good. Way too sweet. Half the sugar was better. But then the frosting was also way too sweet compared to other recipes - there are better ones on this site.

I'm giving this recipe 5 stars even though I had to make some big changes. I have a very strong feeling that this cake is fantastic as written. This was a spur of the moment thing as I needed to used up carrots. I had to use sucralose (hubs is diabetic). I substituted Kefir milk for buttermilk, I only had a small can of pineapple, I added pecans & some hemp seeds. No icing,  either; just a dusting of 10X sugar. Delicious & moist! I want the real version so badly!

This was best carrot cake I’ve ever tasted. Very moist and flavorful. Only change I made was I used one cup of white sugar and one cup of brown sugar instead of 2 cups of white sugar.

I made this for my son's birthday and of course being the good baker I had to taste since this was the 1st time making.  Amazing!  I had my 2 other older kids try also and they raved about for 2 days!  Needless to say he doesnt quite have a full birthday cake now lol  Oh, and I havent even frosted with cream cheese frosting yet....that's how good it is! Super moist and lots of flavor. I did add raisins, nuts and pineapple and it was perfect!  I did make in a 9x13 pan and ended up taking about 50-55 minutes total to bake completely but will worth the time and effort!!

This was very moist and flavorful. Made it without pineapple because the rest of my family doesn't like pineapple. Also only used half the powdered sugar and add added walnuts to the frosting. I rarely follow recipes exactly.

Not a huge fan of shredded coconut, so omitted that, and sautéed the carrots with coconut oil instead. Came out delicious! Everyone absolutely loved the cake! I paired it with the whipped cream cream cheese frosting from here instead, just to cut the richness, and it was perfect! Definitely a keeper!

Fabulous!!! I have done a lot of baking, but this was my first attempt at carrot cake. I suppose I was intimidated and nervous it wouldn't turn out. Carrot cake is my absolute favorite cake by far. I cut the recipe in half, as I knew a whole recipe would be too much for two adults and a child. I used one round cake pan.

The recipe calls for 3 eggs, and I used two in this halved version. I believe this added to the nice moist texture.

The pineapple added deliciously sweet moisture. I didn't have crushed pineapple, but I did have a can of chunks. I took half of chunks from the can and chopped them finely.

For the frosting, I used a mixer to mix it together. The instructions don't say to do this, but I highly recommend it.

I used a convection oven to bake. It took 50 minutes on 325.

The only thing I plan on changing next time is the amount of spice used. I will add more cinnamon and some nutmeg next time. This is for my personal taste, as I enjoy foods that are richly spiced.

I made this recipe yesterday with some adjustments.. I don't like pineapple so I got a ripe mango and chopped it up. Then I substituted 1 cup of white sugar for brown sugar. Plus, I  used only 1 tsp of baking soda and added 2 tsp of baking powder since there is already salt in the recipe. Plus I  added a 1/2 tsp of nutmeg for added flavor. it was easy and very moist. My husband loved it. I'm going to make it again for sure.

I got so many compliments from this recipe. The only change i made was leaving out the coconut personal choice cause nobody in the house likes it With that said it had to be one of the best tasting carrot cakes i have ever made even after 3 days it was as moist then as ir was on the day of baking. Oh i also added raisins another personal choice. I will most definitely make this again i am already getting request, your recipes on here never disappoint.

Love it! And I don’t even like carrot cake!! I didn’t have canned pineapple so I used canned pears, I omitted the coconut flakes, I added a cup of raisins and I also used three 8 “ pans. The cake cake out so moist and just the right density.

My daughter wanted a homemade carrot cake for her birthday and this recipe delivered.  I did not add coconut because she does not like it.  Next time I am going to make two small round cakes and add coconut to one. Absolutely delicious and my carrot cake recipe for life.

I deviated from the recipe slightly.  I did add a tsp each of  nutmeg and ginger. I also divided the batter into 2 9in pans and then layered frosting between the 2 layers. Also, because of this, I doubled the frosting. Tasty and moist, very much liked.

Didn't add the syrup from the pineapple, but it needed it, will add it for sure next time. Need extra confectioners sugar for the frosting in the hot & humid climate of South Thailand. We'll make this many times again.

I didn’t love it, but it was ok. I’m not even sure exactly what was wrong, but I’ve had carrot cake before that grabbed me by the neck and pulled me in.  Cake that demanded you eat every morsel. This cake was more and gentle invitation, but not a particularly urgent one.

Absulutely yummy and moist!  Served it for a gathering, everyone loved it.  Only I would cu the quantity for the frosting, it was way too much sugar on top.  Also added a half of lemon juice to the frosting, that was perfect!

Quick and easy to prepare, moist but not too dense, and just the right amount of sweetness. The flavors were rich but perfectly blended. What more could you want in a cake? This got rave reviews from my mother and my mother in law who are both big fans of carrot cake. The only change I made was a substitution for the buttermilk—I did not have any on hand so I used 1tablespoon of lemon juice added to 1 cup of milk. Seemed to work like a charm!

This is PERFECT!  So easy (I was on the phone with our daughter the whole time I was mixing it, just glancing at the recipe when needed)! Moist, fragrant, and pretty (rare in carrot cakes).  The frosting is AWESOME!  I favorited this, and will make it for years to come!  My husband’s favorite cake is carrot cake...this will be his favorite of those! P.S.  it’s his birthday cake! Thanks for the recipe!

Wow so good. Didn’t modify anything except pan size; I used two 8” round pans and cooked a little less (45min). Thought I would have to spread icing thin but it turned out to be just right, even with some between layers. Will try with pecans next time.

I’ve made this twice now and have heard “this is the best cake I’ve ever had” multiple times. It is packed with fruit/carrots and is so moist. The frosting melts in your mouth. I tend to do two layers and do a whipped cream layer in the middle and the frosting on the top. It’s definitely a crowd favorite!

I'll make it again, but modified quite a bit from the other reviews.  Did half the sugar as brown sugar, 20 oz pineapple, 3 cups carrot, skipped the coconut and added extra flour so it was not so runny.  Also, for the icing used 2 pkg cream cheese and 3 cups powdered sugar.

My mother’s favorite is carrot cake. I’ve made at least 10 different versions and let me say this is the keeper. I didn’t use raisins, but everything else I did. I have a huge family at thanksgiving more than 56 of us this year so I made 2 cakes and 24 cupcakes. It was such a huge hit my uncles made sure they got the recipe before I left. I’m in the military so coming home is a big deal as I have spent many years away from family. It’s the pineapple and coconut that in my opinion make this cake pop and keep it moist. I used pineapple rings and hand cut them fine. Usi

I made this, followed directions exactly except used a quarter cup of sour cream and 1/2 cup whole milk in place of buttermilk, and I just realized I used a 20 oz can of crushed pineapple, and it is delicious. I've never made carrot cake from scratch before, made cupcakes and baked at 350 for 25 minutes. Can't wait for my husband to try them!

A very moist cake with the interesting addition of buttermilk.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of granulated for the cake and baked in a 9x13 pan so reduced the icing recipe by 1/2 which was sufficient.  I will use this again.

Made this cake for my wife's birthday since there isn't a bakery around here that can make one right.  It turned out awesome!  I didn't have any allspice on hand but didn't seem to miss it.  I'll find out the next time I make it.  A definite keeper recipe.

This is an amazing recipe! I followed the recipe almost exactly. The changes I made were substituting 1/2 c. sugar with 1/2 c. brown sugar. ( I just thought it would result in a richer flavor) I also reduced the cinnamon to 1 3/4 tsp and added 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and a few dashes of allspice. This was strictly because I am not a huge cinnamon fan but not sure how much difference it made. The cake was so perfect that I’m positive the original recipe is also perfect-my changes were very minor. I also used a different frosting recipe-the cream cheese frosting II from this site as I wanted a frosting that was less sweet. I added a dash of almond extract to the frosting (in addition to the vanilla the recipe calls for) and the flavors were perfect with this carrot cake. 
The first time I made this cake I did 2 round cakes to make a layer cake. The second time I made the cake in mini loaf pans (about 8). Perfect both times! Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

My husband’s favorite is carrot cake. But he’s very picky about his food preferences in general, and doesn’t like shredded coconut, cooked pineapple, or baked goods with nuts. How carrot cake became his fav is a mystery, since those are common ingredients. But I decided to try this recipe anyway. I experimented, though. I cut the recipe in half, added about 1/2 a cup of raisins, and made 12 cupcakes - four different varieties, all with raisins. Three had everything. Three had everything, but no nuts. Three had everything, but no shredded coconut. And three had no shredded coconut or nuts. When I made half the batter with and without the shredded coconut, I noticed a large difference in the texture, which worried me that it wouldn’t bake quite right. The shredded coconut clearly absorbed a decent amount of liquid and was necessary for the right dry/wet balance. So I added the same amount of coconut flour instead (it’s the texture of shredded coconut that bothers him - not the flavor). It worked ok. They all baked at about the same rate, finishing in about 35min at 350° at our near sea level elevation. I had him try a little of each. Low and behold, the unadulterated recipe (plus raisins) was a clear winner despite his food aversions! Thank goodness. And it was delicious!!! (The coconut flour made it a little too granular for my liking, for what it’s worth. The shredded coconut was much more pleasant). (I made it gluten and dairy free, too, for my 3yo with food allergies.)

I added extra flour, 2 or 3 tablespoons, for high altitude. I also decorate it with some sprinkled coconut and candied carrots. For the carrots, simply slice them thinly and boil for a couple minutes in a syrup made from equal parts sugar and water.

A young friend wanted carrot cake for her wedding, and this recipe was perfect. I used pecans instead of walnuts and omitted the coconut.  Fortunately, I have an Oster which made short work of grating those carrots. Because it was for a wedding I only put the cream cheese frosting between the layers and covered it with a traditional white icing.

This is the BEST carrot cake! I did make some minor adjustments. I cut the sugar in half using 1/2 cup white sugar and 1/2 cup brown sugar, I substituted the vegetable oil with 1/3 cup coconut oil and instead of AP flour, I used plain cake flour. The cake was dense, but that’s a carrot cake & it was perfectly moist. I baked in two 8 inch rounds for 40 minutes. I would definitely suggest completely cooling to too

Overall, it was a pretty good carrot cake. It was a little dry and needed a little bit more flavor. I like that it was not too dense.

It was a great hit for our family Easter gathering - however, it seemed too dense / wet.  While the edges were getting over cooked, the center remained stubbornly soggy.  As it cooled, the center caved in.  I decided not to put frosting on it.  Will definitely try this again - maybe less carrots?

This had flavor and was moist - very very moist, almost too moist which made it a bit on the heavy mush side.  The frosting was overpowering, I thought.

This cake is amazing! You can also make this recipe in an open bundt pan which is what we did. The icing recipe is generous too and makes plenty for accomplishing icing :)

This recipe was a big hit! It's moist and delicious.  I used ingredients in my pantry, and substituted pecans for walnuts and added 1/2 cup of golden raisins since I only had 8 oz of crushed pineapple.
This recipe is a keeper!!

I made these into cupcakes tonight for my moms birthday tomorrow. One batch yielded 4 dozen cupcakes. You'll need to make a double batch of the frosting though. My husband says these were delicious but to go lighter on the coconut next time I make them. I thought they were perfect. The frosting is light and not too sweet. Just right!  I can't wait to share these with my family tomorrow!  My mom loves carrot cake and I know she'll love these cupcakes!

I made this cake and took it to a party and everyone wanted to know who made it , everyone who had a piece came up to me and told me that that was the best carrot cake they ever had! I did add raisins and chopped pecans along with 1/4 cup of walnuts (that’s all I had and knew it would need more nuts) . They also said how moist it was , 10 thumbs up.

So  good! Followed it almost exactly.  My pineapple can was 20oz and I didn't realize but it didn't matter. It also cooked perfect at 40-45 minutes. let your nose be your guide. I will definitely make it again. Thanks

I made this cake for my boyfriend he absolutely loved it. It's moist and pretty filling, we had some of this cake for breakfast one morning. I then turned it into a gluten free cake for my nephews using Red Mill's gluten free flour 1:1. If you use this flour you don't need to mix in the Guar gum or any other binders. Just follow the recipe and with GF dishes you need to cook the dish at a lower temp for a longer time. But this made as a regular cake with the cream cheese frosting is THE BOMB. I have made this cake numerous times because of its greatness. My suggestion is to make it first then of you want to tweak it you can to fit your taste.

The great carrot cake ever but way too much icing.   half the icing recipe. I also added some toasted coconut to the top for decoration and omitted the nuts and eggs due to food allergies. Turned out amazing.

This was a really great recipe! I thought 2 cups of grated carrots was a lot, but this recipe kind of missed a heavy carrot flavor. So, if there is some type of carrot flavoring out there, I would have used a bit. For my Maytag oven, it took only about 40 minutes to bake. The cake was getting rather dark 25 minutes into the oven, I was scared, so I turned the heat down to 140. I used less pineapples, like another user suggested...just 8 oz and I put 2 tablespoons of pineapple juice from the can in the icing. The icing was difficult to spread for some reason, but it was very good. Go ahead and use this recipe. It was my first time make it for my bae and he loved it!

This cake is without doubt the best carrot cake. I've been using this recipe for years. By the way, you can substitute pecans for the walnuts, but either are delicious. I toast them a little first.

This carrot cake was very moist, delicious and not heavy like other carrot cake recipes I’ve tried. In fact, it was even better the next day! I added 1/2 cup of raisins to the recipe and my family loved it. I took some to work and it was gone in seconds! I would definitely recommend this recipe to others

As far  as the ingredients go, I used everything exactly as listed, no substitutions.  I baked this in 2 round pans, however, and had to decrease the bake time by 15 min.  So I baked them at 350 degrees for 40 min.

I made this cake for the first time for a party.  I was nervous because I was bringing something that I had never made nor tasted before. It was a HUGE hit!!  Delicious and very moist.   The cream cheese frosting is perfect, not overwhelmingly sweet. The recipe is super easy.

I would definitely make this again and am doing so for my Dad's  birthday.  :)

This is a good basis for what could be an incredible carrot cake. I didn’t give it 5 stars because I never understand folks who give a recipe 5 stars but they made several modifications.  Such is the case here. Instead of vegetable oil I used coconut oil.  I added additional spices in order to get the right taste. I added 1/4 teaspoon of each of the following ground nutmeg, ground allspice, ground cloves, ground ginger. If you don’t have all those spices just add 1 teaspoon of pumpkin spice. It really adds to the recipe making this a truly flavorful carrot cake.

I have made this at least 5 times. The first 2 times I followed the recipe exactly but it didn't set properly. I did not know I was supposed to drain the juice from the can of pineapple. (Honest mistake Lol)  After those attempts I drained the juice but still found it a bit runny so I added another 1/2 cup to 1 cup of flour. It says 55 minutes to bake but for me it was at least an hour to an hour and 10 minutes. Besides that I ommited the nuts.  Excellent after all that. Everyone that tries it says it's delicious.

Tastes unbelievable. I put the batter in 2, 9" round pans. If you have someone that is anti dairy this is a fabulous treat. I will frost the other pan. It seriously is so good you don't need frosting.

YUM!  I added 1/2 cup of dates and 1/2 cup of oats to this recipe.  Fabulous!  The recipes allows for you to leave the cake in the pan.  This means no trouble at the very end.  Just frost it and go.  Topped mine with a sprinkle of cinnamon across the middle.  Delicious.

Made as described, except I added an extra teaspoon of cinnamon for extra flavor, and I cut out the nuts due to nut allergies. My cake finished cooking in about 40 minutes, so make sure to keep an eye on yours! My family is a carrot cake family, my aunt even had it at her wedding. They all raved about it. They loved how moist it was. I used the frosting recipe as well, but used half the sugar, and I would probably use even less next time. It was quite sweet. I know this will be a repeat in our family!

I reduced sugar to 1 1/2 cups as suggested by others and cut pineapple in half.  Excellent. Im sure it would be good as the original recipe as wee. I had requests for this recipe. Next time I will add raisins. Watch the oven time, the size of pan will determine the length of cooking time. This is a real keeper of a recipe.

I made this just as it is and it was moist and one of the best carrot cakes I've ever made.  I will definitely make it again.

I substituted walnuts for the pecans and I did not put the coconut in because my hubby doesn't happen to like coconut.  This cake is absolutely the best carrot cake I have ever had.  I made it into two layers instead of a sheet cake.  The only thing I would do differently when I make it again, is double the recipe for icing.  We love the icing almost as much as the cake.

I love how this is basically no fail and I have added some extra ingredients and it  still turns out really good; however I think I might try to choose more healthier options for future.  I am always left with way too much icing afterward and I would like to cut down the sugar/or switch for something else.. once I figure out how to do that..

Followed some suggestions in other comments.  Added more carrots and a large can of shredded pineapple with a few spices including cardamom.  I thought it was a little too wet.  My mom disagreed.  Everyone loved it.  Will make again.

This is an excellent carrot cake! Everyone raved about it and it really did come out with the consistency I was looking for. I have packets of dry buttermilk and I always get nervous using it for baking when the recipe calls for liquid buttermilk. If this is the case for you, just follow the directions on the box for how much water is needed and just add it right in the the dry mix. Not a huge coconut flake fan, so I might skip the coconut next time. Overall a great recipe and it was easier than I expected!

I subbed half the oil with no sugar added apple sauce. I also doubled the icing. Cooked it in a 9"x14" rectangular pan and iced right up to the top of the pan so it was level across. Sprinkled walnuts on top. This cake was so good!

This is the best carrot cake ever! I skipped the coconut and used raisins but that was do to a family member who dislikes coconut. I think the big difference is the buttermilk. it is so moist.

Great recipe! Tried to bake in a bundt pan but stuck to the pan. A good moist recipe if you keep it in the pan. Icing was a little thick so had to thin it out with a touch of milk. Otherwise I would make it again!

This was restaurant quality and the best carrot cake I've ever had. My husband said it was world quality! Everyone raved about it since I had it for Easter dessert. I even made the next batch and made muffins. Superb!! The cream cheese icing is divine! The only thing I omitted was the coconut and I added raisins. I will be making this recipe again and again for sure.

I made this cake for the last three years for Easter. Everyone goes crazy for it. This year I made the cake in a bundt cake pan. I should have cooked it a little longer than the direction for a 9 X 13 pan, but it still turned out great. Everyone thought it was really moist, but truly it as under cooked.

Very moist, I omitted coconut and nuts.  The pineapple was too much, we prefer more of a spice cake than a chunky cake.  Next time I will just add pineapple juice.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white sugar.  I added 1 tsp of all spice, and used 3 cups of carrots.  55 minutes to bake was to long, 45 would be plenty for my oven.  Some suggested to cut icing ingredients in half but we enjoyed a good helping of icing.

We absolutely loved this cake and it was easy to make. I did make a couple of changes: I omitted the coconut because I didn't have any and I added about a cup of raisins. Thank you for a great recipe!

Fantastic!! I did make a few changes to suit my family's tastes and to use what I had on hand. Ended up with hands-down the best carrot cake I've ever made. My boyfriend went so far as to say it was the best cake he's ever had, period! I substituted 1 1/2 creamed bananas for the pineapple, added 1/2 cup brown sugar and 1 tsp nutmeg to the flour mix along with listed ingredients, whipped my icing mix and added 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice to it, and sprinkled cinnamon and salted caramel chips on top for decoration/added flavour layers. My cake took 45 minutes to cook perfectly. This is a winner! Thank you!

Very yummy!  Would have given it 5 stars but was a little too dense, and called for too much coconut. Next time I'll decrease that and maybe add a hair more flour/cake flour  to give it a bit more crumb. But all and all, delicious!

Ok so I followed the recipe exactly except I left out walnuts and added 5oz of more pineapple. And WOW!!! The cake took 25 more minutes than suggested for the toothpick to come out clean, so I was worried it might be dry but let me tell you this cake was SO MOIST AND SO DELICIOUS!!! I made my frosting with butter, powdered sugar, vanilla and a hefty amount of cinnamon and it works perfectly. This recipe was a hit with my family :)

I would call this Trail Mix Carrot Cake. It has too much going on. It's too chunky and too dense. I was hesitant to make it initially because of all the different ingredients but was swayed by all of the five star reviews. I probably would have given it more than two stars if I hadn't had such high expectations going in. I bake a lot and found this recipe to be a little intense.

I accidentally put vanilla in the cake so it ended up having twice as much but man was it delicious! I added a splash of nutmeg and cinnamon to the icing as well and wow!!!

Excellent!  Just preference I omitted the nuts & coconut  and added 1 cup of white raisins. I've made it several times now, a definite keeper!

Just made this today for my daughter.  She loved it! I didn't use nuts on mine just in case someone with allergies had some.  I didn't let it cool long enough before frosting it so it is a bit messy.  But the taste is what matters. The batter was wetter than other cakes but I think it made it very moist.  I made it in three small round pans so I cut off about 17 minutes.  Basically keep an eye on it and decide by your oven and what pan you use.  Enjoy!

Very moist cake. Boiled my carrots first and puréed them then let cool. I did add some ginger, cardamom & all-spice for more depth of flavor (hence the 4 stars); substituted cranberries instead of raisins - just because I like them better. I also made it in cup cakes cooked for approx 20 mins. Then finished them off with a tangerine buttercream.

This is the first carrot cake I have made and it was so good!   I tried taking it out of the pan and decorating and it was so heavy it fell apart. Then cake kept crumbling when trying to fix. It was crazy looking but so good!  Best thing ever. Huge hit and everyone said it was the best they ever had.  I added a caramel sauce and walnuts on the top!

I always put less sugar in recipes. I would say this recipe is perfect.  (I used 1 1/2 cups sugar) but then felt like it probably would have been better as the recipe stated.  I certainly would not use that much sugar in the icing (I used 2 cups and it was excellent that way.)   Thanks for a great recipe!

This cake is wonderful! It's so moist and flavorful! The only thing I did different was to add a pinch of nutmeg and ground cloves to the cake mix. I also added two drops of food grade tangerine essential oil to the frosting. Oh my stars, but it's yummy!!!

I made this and it was wonderful. I followed the instructions to a "t". The cake was moist, tasty, not super sweet, the raisins and walnuts added an unexpectedly pleasant texture.(I don't like walnuts) The only drawback about the recipe, it didn't include a frosting recipe. I had to look through other recipes to find one, to pair well with the cake.

I thought it would be hard. So I got all the ingredients together. My son wanted a carrot cake for his birthday so I got this one. It was easy to mix together. It came out fantastic and didn't change any of the ingredients. I'm making this one again at Thanksgiving . For people with diabetes please don't add sugar add sweetener. I also used a bundt pan.

I made it as a 4-layer cake using 11.1" springform pans.  I left out the pineapple, and split the sugar into white and light brown.  I multiplied the ingredients by 1.5x, did it twice, to yield 4 nice layers that I sawed the tops off.  Filling/frosting was 4 8oz cream cheese, 4 sticks of butter with 4.5 cups of confectioner's sugar and 4 tsp vanilla.  I don't get frosting/filling recipes that call for 4 cups of confectioner's sugar per 8oz cream cheese, that is WAY TOO SWEET for my taste!  I make a big layer cake for my girlfriends's school once a week, they tell me my 4x 8 oz cream cheese/4 sticks butter/4.5 cups confectioner's sugar is the perfect mix, sweetened but not overly sweet.
Great recipe, I will make this again!

I was nervous about this but it was easy and came out yummy and moist. Good recipe, although I could swear it says to add something like vanilla an extra time.  Either way it was great!

I loved this recipe! I made it for a dessert party and won for best taste and won first place overall! It taste amazing, though if you want to make a two-layered cake (like I did), double the amount of cream cheese frosting and walnuts. ;D

I have a few carrot cake connoisseurs in my family so I have been searching for the ultimate carrot cake recipe.  Search over.  This cake has everything wonderful in it.  I used a double recipe of cream cheese frosting I with added vanilla. Perfection.
My family LOVED it.

I knew that this recipe would be very good because most of the ingredients are just what I always use except for the coconut and butter milk. I eliminated the coconut added  raisins. The texture was good flavor real carrot like . It took a little longer to bake . This will be my basic go to carrot cake recipe from now on. It's really easy to make and is simply delicious. I frosted with cream cheese frosting and decorated with slivered almond

Awesome!  Moist and easy to make. I baked it for a Farewell Party and my co-workers wanted the recipe for their families.    I did changed it a bit after I read some of the reviews.  I used 1 Cup of white sugar and 1 Cup of brown sugar, added 1/2 cup of raisins with the grated carrots, and added 6 tsps. of pineapple juice with the pineapples.  At that point, I did think it looked too thin, so I added another 1/2 Cup of flour.  I, also, added walnuts and pecans.  It baked up wonderfully.  Very moist and tasty.

we tweaked it a bit.. more carrots and more pineapple and used the package of carrots that are already in slivers.. made the pineapple more of a puree
and put coconut and walnut dust together on the sides of the cake after icing just a little.

Made this for Memorial Day Cookout and everyone raved about how good it was.  Most notably pointing out the pineapple making it extra delicious.  Unfortunately I couldn't try it due to food allergies, but it looked really good.  Unlike my usual routine, I did not read the reviews before baking.  I had already mixed the sugar with wet ingredients when I decided to reference them to determine if I should be using the sweetened or unsweetened coconut flakes.  I went with unsweetened, but afterward, my husband (who has a ridiculous sweet tooth) did say that was his only suggestion for next time, to use the sweetened.  But, in referencing the reviews, found the helpful tip suggesting allspice, so I did add the teaspoon of it to dry ingredients since I do recall carrot cake having a good spice flavor from when I ate it last.  Good suggestion. Also, saw the half brown half white sugar suggestion which I had already contemplated doing but it was too late this time.  I will do that next time.  Although everyone loved it just the same. Thank you for the recipe.  Oh, I also used store bought frosting as I thought it being my first attempt at carrot cake from scratch, that was enough for a not so talented baker as myself.  Next time, I'll try to do the homemade frosting as well. :)

I really wish that there was a 10 star option. My whole family loved this cake, even my husband who is generally not one for carrot cake. I took the left overs to work and it all got devoured, people thought it was a store bought cake. I did make some changes due to the high altitude and to increase the liquid for it I used 16oz of pineapple (couldn't find any 15 oz cans anyway). Cake came out wonderful, thanks for the recipe!!!

So I really don't like carrot cake at all, I made this for my mom on Mother's Day because she loves carrot cake.  Since that cake was to big for just my mom to enjoy, I shared with others that also enjoy carrot cake. My father in law and mother in law loved it, and my mom won't stop talking about it either!  And omg I even loved it! All these flavors combined were spectacular! The cake was moist and delicious, and the best part of all was that it was super easy to make!

This cake comes out wonderful  every time!   Thinking about trying the apple sauce instead of the oil this time.  Just don't want to ruin a perfectly wonderful cake.  Has anyone tried using the applesauce?

Awesome!!  I had people tell me this was the best they ever had.  The only changes I made was eliminate the coconut (because we don't like it) and  reduced the powdered sugar by 1/2 cup so it wasn't so sweet.  I will definitly make this cake again and again.

This is absolutely the best carrot cake I have ever tasted. I made this recipe the other week, and happened to try several other "professionally" baked recipes, and this one wins by a long shot. Perfect texture, perfect moistness, perfect frosting.

Didn't change anything from the recipe and the cake came out great.  I just finished eating it yesterday (a week later after we made it) and it was STILL moist!  Great flavor, especially the crunchiness of the walnuts.  The cream cheese icing was amazing and will have to make this every single time I make an icing.  I will definitely make this cake again.

I used this recipe and it was an absolute hit! Instead of using coconut flakes, I replaced the vegetable oil with coconut oil to still get that subtle flavor while keeping it nice and moist. Definitely recommend this recipe!

excellent recipe.  I like mine 'cakeier' though. so I will look for another recipe.  this 1 is delicious, dense and heavy.  I soaked the raisins in orange juice and added pecans and cardamom.  I used 1 cup of brown sugar and 1 cup of white, no coconut and only 8 oz. of crushed pineapple.  i baked it in a 9 x 13 pan and one half of the frosting recipe was plenty.  thank u for sharing.

I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out perfect. At first I thought the batter was too runny and I was about to add more flour, but decided to just see how it would turn out. So glad I didn't alter it. It's super moist. I'm craving it and want to make it again today but sadly I'm out of eggs. I'll have to wait until tomorrow.

Before anyone complains that I loved a recipe that I changed..  I shredded way too much carrot and so used 3 cups total but added a tablespoon of flour so the batter wouldn't be too wet.  I also substituted 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour because I bought too much and wanted to use it up. (I am putting some in pretty much everything I make using flour these days.)  Also I had to put in 1/2 cup of raisins because our mom always put raisins in carrot cake when we were kids and my family expects them.
I served the cake at Easter dinner yesterday.  I made 2-9" layers and baked them for 42 minutes,  The amount of frosting was perfect.  The cake was awesome and everyone who tasted it said it was the best carrot cake they ever had.   Thanks Marc!

OMG.  Made this for Easter Sunday and So delish!  Very moist cake. I was able to take the cake out at about 40 minutes and it was perfect. Used pecans instead of walnuts and left out the coconut from inside the cake (personal preference) but sprinkled on top of the frosting. Yummy!

This Is a very good cake recipe and I would highly recommend it! Very easy to make and moist! I have never made a carrot cake with coconut in it which makes this cake quite different in my book. It does not have a lot of spice in it which I would like a bit more, next time I make this I think I will add some nutmeg maybe some cloves. But over all a wonderful cake!

I made this cake for my husband's birthday. He says it was the best cake he's ever had, bar none. I have to say, it was delicious and everyone who ate it raved about it! The only tweak I made was with the cooking time. I made this cake in a white corning cake pan and it was plenty done in about 40-45 mins (instead of the 55 mins that the recipe calls for). It was absolutely delicious!

The top was getting brown very fast but the inside wasn't cooking. So that led to a half burnt cake.
I made it in a 9x13 inch pan and cut the cake in half and made a layered cake. I doubled the frosting (But only used 4 1/2 cups powdered sugar because 8 cups is way to much), and it was a perfect amount. Family loved it.

This was my first time making a carrot cake and I took some of the tips that DivaJojo offered and it came out beautifully!!!  It was moist and just simply delicious.a  I made it in a 9" round baking pan so it took about an extra 15-20 mins to bake through.  I took it to a dinner party that I attended and it was gone in no time.  Everyone couldn't stop raving about it!!

I made this carrot cake and it was delicious! The frosting was perfect and I loved the fact that it had coconut flakes because I love coconut. The only thing that I would do differently next Tim is puree the crushes pineapple first before mixing into the batter, I wasn't a fan of having chunks of pineapple in my cake. I did however follow the suggestions of others and did not drain the juices from the pineapple, I kept it in and I feel it kept the bread moist.

Delicious cake!!! I switched it up a little by using turbinado cane sugar instead of white, whole wheat flour and fresh coconut.
My family loved it!!!

Thanks for the recipe!

Very good cake. A little too moist. Think i will do without the canned pineapple which seems to make it soggy. The icing is delicious! Will make again minus pineapple.

Simply the best Carrot cake I have ever made!  I followed the recipe to a T and did not make any alterations.  The only issue I had was that there was more batter than I needed for 2 9" cake rounds.  Do not overfill your pans but instead make a few cupcakes to use up the extra batter.  I will be making thi one again!

Made it twice and loved its flavour and moisture. The spices and carrot coconut flavours are so well balanced. It is by far our favorite carrot cake recipe now. Yumm. Thank you for sharing it.

Delicious, moist, fruitcakey-style carrot cake. If you like the drier more cake-like carrot cake keep looking. I have adapted this many times depending on what I had on hand and it always comes out delicious! I like it best with half packed brown sugar, and half white sugar. It's good with a cup or so of various dried fruit... cranberries, raisins, apricots, whatever you have on hand. The coconut is yummy, but I have left it out successfully too. Melted butter can be subbed for the oil, and a tsp. of cider vinegar in regular milk works for the buttermilk. Cooked in two 9 inch pans as a layer cake it looks very festive, but be aware that the cooking time is a little less that way.

I made the recipe as listed and it was wonderful, but I found that the brown sugar/sugar mix makes it even better.  The only other change that I made was to add 1/4 cup of the pineapple juice and 1 tsp of cinnamon to the frosting.  It makes the frosting a little softer, but additional powdered sugar can be added to compensate.  The pineapple and cinnamon give this cake a huge flavor boost.  I also like cupcakes so I cooked them 12-15 min, makes 36 cupcakes.

Excellent recipe- Perfectly moist! The only reason I'm giving this recipe 4 stars is because I think it could have used a touch of cloves or allspice to give it a little depth in flavor! Otherwise, it was a great success!!! I chose to make cupcakes (it makes 24), so I opted with the crushed pineapple to just put it in as is...no draining! Now, for a cake I wouldn't recommend this because it would probably be TOO moist, but cupcakes always need a touch more moisture than cakes so I thought I'd give it a whirl...success! I also topped with a Cinnamon Cream Cheese Icing....WOW AND YUM! Just combine 1 pkg cream cheese (8oz), 1/4 cup softened butter, 1 tsp vanilla extract (or real maple syrup! I was out of extract and this did the trick!), 1 1/2 tsp of ground cinnamon and 3 cups of icing sugar (or add for a firmer texture). Whip it all up and spread it on your cooled cupcakes. My husband was in carrot cupcake heaven and we have lots left over for him to take to work tomorrow. This is the first time I've made cupcakes that aren't dry as a bone! Thanks for the great recipe for my collection!

This is a sweet cake that is very enjoyable. I made this  year for my Dad's birthday and he loved it so much I made it for  Father's day and he enjoyed as much as he did on his birthday. I did change a few things I added raisins, chopped  pecans, dry pineapple, and cut down on the coconut flakes a bit. Also I didn't use buttermilk because we don't  drink cow milk at my house. You will definitely enjoy this superb cake.

Dang it, missed the word “drained“ pineapple, so I put almost 20 oz of pineapple plus juice in there! Wondered why it was so soupy. Rather than throw it all out I put another cup of flour and probably another 2 teaspoons of baking soda in the batter. This is apparently a very forgiving recipe because it turned out OK. The frosting makes it, in my opinion. Baked to perfection at about 56 minutes (took me a minute to realize I hadn't put the timer on, flustered I guess). Took one star off because the recipe directions mention vanilla twice for the cake part in two different paragraphs, and because it would be very helpful if the words "drained pineapple" were in the actual directions.

I tried this recipe as directed except I left out the coconut and pineapple. It turned out looking more like a fruit cake and was very thick and sticky. I had a hard time getting it out of the pan. It had entirely too much sugar and salt and could use more carrot. I wont be making this again. I don't know how it has accomplished a five star rating.

My boys loved this, but I found it a little too "crumbly". I'm giving a 4 star because of their input. Personally, I like a cake with more density. It's all a matter of tastes!

I have made this recipe several times now, including in cupcake form.  I use regular Vitamin D milk and a little more carrots and vanilla but generally follow the cake recipe and it is REALLY good.  Cooking time for me was as low as 30 minutes in an oven that had been in use for a long time prior to baking this item.

The butter cream frosting recipe uses too much sugar.  Only use 2 cups of sugar and you'll love it.

I made a couple substitutions. 1) I used applesauce in place of the pineapple. I only had 1c of applesauce, so I added an extra cup of grated carrots, also to try and mimic the pineapple texture. When the cake came out, I thought it looked dry, so I brushed it with orange juice, thinking that would also add a citrus flavor that was lacking without the pineapple.  When I tried the cake after frosting it, it was completely moist and not dry at all. 2) I used neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese and it was fine. Great recipe!

This is the best carrot cake I have ever had! It was so moist! Since I couldn't find a 15 ounce can of crushed pineapple, I used 2 eight ounce cans drained. I figured 16 oz. was better than using a 20 oz. can as some had done.  Then used paper towels to absorb a little more moisture but certainly not all. Seemed a little soupy when I put mixture into pan, but resisted urge to add more flour.  It baked perfectly, not soupy at all.  After reading some reviews, I used a different frosting that called for only 2 cups of sugar and one half teaspoon more of vanilla.  Also sprinkled chopped walnuts over top of frosting.  Yum, yum, will be sure to make this again!

I found that my batter was way too runny, so I ended up adding about another 1/2 to 1 cup of flour. The batter also seemed a bit lacking in spice so I added all spice and nutmeg which I think added to the cake!

This is undoubtedly one of the best carrot cake recipes I’ve tried.  I initially made them into cupcakes for easy serving, and they went way too quickly.  They were such a hit, I made it into a cake a few days later.  The flavor is spot on, not being too sweet.  I recommend draining the pineapple very well.

Great recipe! I only used 1/2 cup of sugar and used applesauce instead of oil. My picky eater, loved it! I've made it twice, and he wants me to make it again!

This cake turned out so incredibly moist and delicious! I brought it to an Easter potluck and it was the first dessert to disappear. Everyone complimented and asked for the recipe. It was also very easy to make. I did sub pecans instead of  walnuts  but other than that I wouldn't change a thing!

Wow,  Followed the instructions and ingredients to the letter. By accident I increased the cinnamon & salt. 
Also,  used coconut oil, 1/2 brown sugar,  1/2 white sugar.. 2 C total. 
Tired of all the adjectives used in reviews to described a wonderful conclusion to a tried recipe,  this will be a keeper for generations

This really is the absolute best carrot cake. It gets countless compliments. I've made it a few times, and it's turned out perfect each time. I made cupcakes for my son's second birthday party, which was held at a pizza place. I offered one to a waitress, and she raved so much to the other waitresses that she had them asking for cupcakes, too!

This cake was excellent! I made it for my boyfriend's birthday because all he wanted was a homemade carrot cake this year.  I followed the recipe almost exactly except I added pecans in place of the walnuts and added about 2/3 cup raisins (I don't care for them but he wanted raisins).  I baked it in 2 nine inch rounds (didn't notice that the recipe was for 9 x 13) and baked it for the full 55 minutes.  I thought since the pans were smaller than called for that I had ruined the cake and that it would be dry.  Not at all! It was still very moist! I cut the cakes into 4 tiers and I doubled the frosting. Will make this again next year for sure.

My husband's favorite cake is Carrot Cake.  Over the years I have tried almost every recipe I've come across.  THIS IS IT!!!!  Once I tried this recipe, I have never strayed.  I have made it as cupcakes over a dozen times the past year.  They are devoured in minutes.  No adaptions needed in this recipe.  We omit the nuts for allergies and I've found a ground coconut instead of the flakes (same amount).  Totally perfect.  Thank you Marc Boyer!

Made this recipe without frosting to let kids frost for fun. Everyone loves this and it is a new family favorite. I made cup cakes in 30 minutes and a loaf in 55 minutes all cooked to perfection. My can of pineapple was 20 oz. I I used a tiny bit less oil to cut a few calories and it was still perfectly most.

Awesome cake recipe.  I used the Cream Cheese Frosting II because I didn't want anything too sweet on top.  I made a few changes.  I used whole wheat flour as that is what I had on hand, I blended pineapple as I didn't have any crushed.  I only used 1/2 cup of pecans and added 1/2 cup of raisins.  I used 1/2 white sugar and 1/2 brown sugar. I don't like overly spiced carrot cake, but I think I will add a little something more the next time.  I will make this again and again!!

This is an excellent recipe.  I followed the suggestion of some other reviews and did not drain the pineapple juice before adding the pineapple.  It turned out fine but it actually made the cake a bit too heavy for me.  Nevertheless, it was still a big hit!

Amazing texture. Great tasting! Though I am not a fan of coconut, I added it and found it was not overpowering and added more to the texture. I finely grated the carrots and used finely chopped nuts.  I like a less sweet icing, so I used 2 cream cheese packages.  
On my list to make again!

It is the best carrot cake I have ever had, and so simple to make. I brought it to a potluck and everybody wanted the recipe. I like the fact that there is less oil than most carrot cakes and it is still so moist. kdh862004 who wrote that it was carrot soup, may not have left it in the oven long enough, it does take quite some time to cook, and it often depends on the oven.

Awesome!!! So yummy! Huge hit! Will definitely make again! Modifications as recommended by other reviews: 1 C brown sugar and 1 C white sugar, 3 C confectioners sugar instead of 4 for frosting.  I used sweetened flaked coconut, wasn't sure as it wasn't mentioned.  I will try unsweetened next time and see which I prefer.

This was good, but a tad bit too sweet. May need to scale back on the sugar in this one. I may omit the coconut next time also.

Delicious, very moist and everyone said it was the best they ever had.  I used a yogurt cream cheese for the frosting and used yogurt in place of the buttermilk as well. Added raisins instead of nuts.  Other than that I would have added more cinnamon.  Enjoy!

I gave this recipe a shot last night and let me tell you....It was the best carrot cake I have ever eaten. I wouldn't change a thing in this recipe except maybe knock 5 minutes of the cooking time depending on the oven......The coconut is what makes it stand out for me at least.

I find that the batter turned out a little too wet, so I added some oatmeal.  Might be unconventional to do so, but it made the batter thicker and the cake heavenly and with even more texture.

I chose this recipe because it resembled a recipe I had years ago.  Its very simple to put together and I followed the instructions as they are. This is the by far the BEST carrot cake I have ever had. The frosting recipe included goes perfectly with it as well.

I loved this recipe!!! Easy to follow and is the best carrot cake I have ever had. The pineapple was such a lovely touch.  I too swapped white flour for wheat to make them more hearty and it worked perfectly. Everyone I shared them with loved them as well and with such a large yield they went a long way. I will be making these again and again. Thank you for the recipe :)

My first time making carrot cake and I was a little scared at first but it turned out amazing! 

The only thing I did different was using 1 1/2 cup of sugar and leaving in the pineapple juice with the crushed pineapple instead of draining. I did not use the frosting from this recipe but used Cream Cheese Frosting II from allrecipe. I also made cupcakes instead of a whole cake. Baked at 350 degree F for about 20 minutes (I just monitored and used the toothpick test to make sure they were done). 

I brought them into work and the entire office loved them! They actually think I could bake.. =) I would highly recommend this carrot cake recipe with the Cream Cheese Frosting II.

I used DivaJojo's suggestions and it was sooooooo good, brought to a party for the birthday girl and everyone loved it, I was explaining how I made it all night. 
My only very slight variances: adding just a touch (1/4 to 1/2 a teaspoon) of lemon extract to the frosting. The citrus gives it a freshness and it makes it much easier to eat without tasting like a sugar bomb. I think the buttermilk and the sour cream in the cake batter do the same thing while making the cake nice and moist.  I also eliminated the raisins, and used pecans for the nuts.

Yummmm! After reading thru several recipes & plenty of comments, I chose this one because of the pineapple & coconut (and no raisins). Other than sautéing my carrots in 1Tb coconut oil, plus 1 tsp sugar & 1tsp of pineapple juice, I followed the recipe for both the cake & frosting exact. It turned out fabulous!! Baked for the recommended time of 55 mins (for 9x13) and the cake turned out completely cooked & oh-so moist & delicious! Why bother with a box cake when this is so yummy & easy :)

Made this recipe as cupcakes for my daughter's first birthday. Delicious! I think I baked them for 25 minutes, I had 24, very full, cupcakes and there was batter leftover so I poured it into a 8x8 pan to make a very thin cake, also baked 20-25 minutes. I wanted to cut it and layer it with frosting to make a smash cake but I ran short on time for prep so I just ate it the day after the party.

The cake was dry and there was too much baking soda that the taste had slight of a change but I guess it was okay to eat! The frosting was too sweet and it did not look like the one on the picture.

 Might try next time

Turned out great with subbing in gluten-free flour and 1 tsp. xanthan gum. I forgot to start the timer, but I'm sure it cooked for well over an hour.

I made this and added extra carrots and pineapple. I had enough to make a cake and about a dozen cupcakes. I used some leftover buttercream icing mixed with some cream cheese and it was excellant. My husband wants this for his birthday cake. This time I am going to make the regular cream cheese icing since I don't have any made up buttercream icing. My family thought it was a wonderful cake and I can tell you, it didn't last long on the counter.

I made this as cupcakes and also as a sheet cake for a birthday party.  Everyone raved about this!  It's wonderful that you can adjust the servings in the settings.  I used directions to serve 24 and directions to serve 15.  I eliminated the coconut.  I also made some of the frosting more stiff by adding more sugar so I could pipe the top of the cupcakes.   Came out great.         Thanks!

Though I didn't include the coconut, since my family doesn't like it, we loved it!  However, the icing was too sweet and on making it a second time we completely omitted the icing.  My daughter made it a third time and cut down on the oil and sugar and it was too gummy.  In trying to reduce our sugar intake, I would keep most of the oil and sugar.

At first when I saw all the ingredients for this cake I was a bit apprehensive about using this recipe. I usually make plain carrot cake with no pineapple or coconut. I decided to make this cake at work and it was a huge hit! Very moist and flavorful.  I got 2 requests from co-workers to make this cake for them. Very happy with this recipe. Very good and easy to follow.

I've made this cake twice. It's delicious, but crumbly. Follow the directions when it says "frost cake while in pan," or it will be hard to frost nicely.

I have been looking for a carrot cake recipe for a long time that makes good muffins/cupcakes. I really liked the taste of this recipe but did not really like the extra "stuff" in this carrot cake recipe because it is not really carrot cake. To me, this was more of a hummingbird cake. I am still searching...

I have made this cake more than three times now.  Only change I make is cutting the oil to 1/2 cup and adding 1/4 cup light sour cream.  I add a creamy pineapple filling in the middle as well.

Received many compliments on this cake.  Very easy to make and tastes great. The only thing I might do differently next time is reduce the amount of pineapple. Wonderful recipe!!!!!

BEST CARROT CAKE EVER!!!!!!!!  I had another recipe that I'd been making for years, but it never really knocked my socks off, so I started trolling for alternate versions.  This recipe has just the right amount of fruit from the pineapple and coconut and just the right amount of spice.  Topped with the perfect icing...well, we were just blown away.  The instructions were PERFECT; no adjustments needed at all.  Thanks again, this is now my go-to carrot cake recipe!!!

is now my go to Carrot Cake recipe! It was moist and yummy and of course everyone loved it. I left out the raisins and pineapple out because I just don't like cooked fruit. My oven is properly calibrated and I found that it didn't need 55 minutes to bake. I bake it at 40 mins. Nice flavor! It's moist and dense and wonderful!

Good recipe.  I made exactly as written, minus nuts.  Very moist and a nice flavor.  I made cupcakes (18 small and 6 jumbo).  We actually like it better without icing.

Amazing recipe!  I cut the pineapple and nuts in half and used regular milk instead of buttermilk. I still love it and my husband always begs me to make it for him.  Great for cupcakes too.

It was good, but not any better than others I have made; carrot cake is pretty universal in flavor. Yes, it does not rise but it is fluffy inside as most carrot cakes are.

Best carrot cake ever!
I only had 2 eggs, so that's what I used, and I only used half of the can of pineapple.  I used half white sugar, half brown.  I added extra sugar to taste to the icing.  Awesome.

I followed this recipe exactly (which I don't often do) and it turned out perfectly. Loaded with taste and texture and very easy to make. I made my own cream cheese frosting for it, but this cake is tasty and moist enough to eat even without frosting.

Best cake ever. I used a mix for the dry ingredients. I just wanted to spice up the box mix a little and came across this. I will never make anything else now. The frosting is perfect too.

This was my first time making Carrot cake, I love Carrot Cake, but am a little picky in the way I like it.  This cake was PERFECT.  Great dense carrot and coconut texture.  I used only 1.5 cups of carrots, simply because I got tired of shreading them, and unsweetened fancy flake coconut.  The pineapple adds fantastic moisture, although you don't really taste it.  I baked mine in 2 9 inch round pans (so in my oven it only took 27 minutes to bake.  I will make this again and again.

i tried this recipe tonight and used 2-8 oz cans of pineapple chunks with the juice because i couldn't find a 15 oz can.  turned out great!  Hubby is the carrot cake eater and he said it was moister and fresher than we get from our local bakery.  I will be making this often.

I have been looking for best carrot cake recipes and this is the one. It turned out to be moist and soft. i reduced the sugar and skipped coconut and pineapple because i dont really like it sweet. instead i added more grated carrots. Also added about 1/2 cup of sour cream. I didnt make the frosting simply because it tastes so nice as it is.

even my husband, who doesnt really into cakes, loves this one. I will definitely make it again

Family Loved the cake so do I. Sift the flour i didn't and I ended up with a pretty heavy and dense cake. If you want something light then sift. 3/4 cups oil I found to be a bit much, my cake did turn out greasy.
Other than those two points the cake is really good.

I took this cake to the office, and everyone raved! I was very popular that day :-) I, too, used the Cream Cheese Frosting II recipe from this site, and it is so creamy and good -- not too sweet.  For the cake itself, I cut the sugar down to 1-1/4 C.  Next time, I'll just use 1 C. Cut back on oil, too, and used a bit of applesauce. 
Awesome cake.

This receipe was by far the BEST Carrot Cake I have ever made.  I made this for my husband to take to work and I actually received an email from one of the women he works with telling me it was the best she has ever tasted.  She could not believe it had pineapple.  I think that is what makes it so moist and delish!!!!!

This is a great recipe for carrot cake - the texture is not very dense, and the cake is dreamily moist without being oily. The icing that is towards the end of the recipe complements the cake nicely. It has the tartness of the cream cheese without being overly sweet!

I never cooked or baked in my life till I got married :) and I just very recently got married. So I'm looking for fast and easy recipes, and this is the easiest and yummiest carrot cake ever. I loved it, everyone else loved it. Cant wait to bake it again. I followed the recipe exactly except the coconut flakes and pineapple. But seriously thank you for such a fantastic and easy recipe.

This was delicious!  I made it for my husband, father and family for Father's Day.  I added raisins but other than that I didn't change a thing.  I used the cream cheese icing 2 recipe.  YUM!  Even better the next day.

5 stars for sure!!! Followed the recipe exactly. Doubled the recipe so I could take one cake to work for a birthday and it was gone in 20 mins!! Took 1/2 the other cake to my daughters house and her husband said best ever, as she snickered because she ate it all!! She's pregnant on bed rest so guess she had nothing else to do but eat it all. Making another tonight to use up my carrots. Was told over and over " Best carrot ever" thanks!

This is a very moist and delicious cake. Just found that baking time was 1hr 30 min. Added 1/2 t allspice and 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves. Will increase all spice in my next round and remember to drain the pineapple. The topping was too sweet though, 3 cups sugar are more than enough.

The cake itself was AWESOME.  I, personally, did not care for the icing.  It was a little thick for me.  I would have preferred a lighter frosting.  Having said that; everyone else who tried the cake raved about it.  I brought it to work thinking I would be bringing some home and it was gone within a half hour.

Wow! Probably the best carrot cake ever! I served it for a birthday party and everyone raved. I added a few golden raisins and used unsweetened coconut. So moist but not greasy at all, this recipe is a keeper.

Excellent. Very moist and tasty. I did not include nuts, as no one in my family likes them. 
I have also made these into muffin/cupcakes. Yummy!

This is the BEST CARROT cake ever, instead of the walnuts I used sultanas and dried cherries and for the frosting I only used half of the confectioners (icing) sugar that gave the frosting a much creamier taste and not so sweet. I took this to an aged care facility hence no walnuts and some to work for samples now I am printing of copies. IT REALLY IS TO DIE FOR. YUMMMMM

I made a few changes to this recipe , but it turned out great . I deleted the coconut and added about a half cup of raisins , then baked in two 9" cake pans . Everyone loved it , but I thought it would have been a lighter texture ,hence only four stars.

Followed this recipe to-the-t and it came out great.  Those that had trouble with the consistency maybe forgot to drain the pineapple WELL.  I would not change a thing.
