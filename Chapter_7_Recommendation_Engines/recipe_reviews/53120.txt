This is a great recipe!  It is quick and easy, and very versatile.  You can make changes to the recipe, based on your preferences or what you have, without changing the character of the recipe, as long as the three main ingredients--peach, corn, and tomato--are there.  For example, both times I made this, I forgot to puree the ingredients.  It's great just chopped, though I will try it the correct way sometime.  One time I inadvertently added a lot of extra peach and tomato, and it was still good.  I like it and the people I have served it to like it.  Everyone says it tastes "fresh."  It's good with tortilla chips; I have yet to try it on fish or meat.  The other change I make is that I use fresh garlic instead of garlic salt.  I was afraid that fresh garlic might be overpowering, but it's not--just one clove is perfect.  I highly recommend this recipe.

Excellent recipe!  Very versatile - peaches and  corn add a nice sweetness to compliment whatever level of spice you like.  If you have good sweet corn, don't bother cooking it first, just slice it off the cob and add it.  Also, I just rough chop everything - we prefer chunky salsa anyway and I like chopping by hand (therapeutic!).  I also use one clove fresh garlic instead of the powder, and have also sub'd various types of peppers.

I brought this to a party last night and have already received several follow up texts/emails for recipe.  I made the recipe as specified, but found it a little bland in color and flavor, so I added a bunch of fresh cilantro and a few exotic mild fresh peppers and it definitely amped up flavor and color.  So with cilantro, I'd give it five stars!

This one gets rave reviews by family and friends, and disappears quickly.  We added more jalapeno to kick it up a bit.  The peach really tops it off!

Easy and fresh - I added cilantro and lime juice to help flavors pop!
