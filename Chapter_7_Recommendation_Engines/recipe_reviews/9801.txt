I really liked these.  I did cut back on the butter by one tablespoon because I wanted them to be a little lower in fat.  The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because they were a little too sweet.  I would cut down on the brown sugar a little next time but keep the honey because it helps it stick together.  When these first come out of the oven they are soft and fall apart easily.  I let them cool for about 2 hours and then cut then with a large, sharp knife on a cutting board and it worked perfectly.  Oh, I used dried cranberries instead of raisins.  I don't like raisins and cranberries seem to match better with cardamom anyway.  I really love the flavor of these- you have to try these if you love cardamom!  They are so simple to prepare too and took only a few minutes to put together.

Fragrant, delicious, easy.  Just the right amount of cardamom for me.  I've tried variations with great success -- dried mangoes and coconut and banana chips; dried cherries and walnuts, whatever you like, just keep similar proportions to the orig. recipe.  Mashing it flatter in the pan just after removing from the oven was a good idea someone mentioned, my bars did not fall apart at all.  I'll be making this a lot.

Tasty, Good flavor, but mine always come out very hard and crunchy and cannot get out of pan without cracking. :-{

This is so good! I made some changes: I used about 1/4 cup brown sugar, 4 tablespoons honey, 4 tablespoons (slightly salted) butter, 1/2 cup of cranberries instead of raisins (goes very well with cardamom!), 1/2 cup of walnuts, 2 cups of oats, added 1/3 cup coconut flakes, and two heaped teaspoons of ground cardamom. I let it cool for one hour before cutting and the result was perfect. Oh, I did use the tip of another user to press it really hard before baking and also right after baking. I think this made the cutting after cooling much easier. They didn't fall apart at all. Thanks for the basic recipe!

Loved these! I used whole cardamom and ground (with a mortar and pestle)the seeds, that's always a stronger flavor so I reduced the cardamom to 1 teas. Other than that made as recipe directed.

OMGoodness! are these goooood. I just tried one as soon as they were ready and am dying to have another. I'll have to be strong.....Followed the recipe except for reducing the butter to 4 tbsp with success (just couldn't bring myself to go all the way :) and sugar to 1/4 c.  Also used dried cranberries and toasted cashews. They were a little brown at 30 minutes so will bake 20 minutes next time.  I need to have just one more!!

I only made half a recipe in a loaf pan to see if I liked the flavor combination...  they haven't cooled completely yet so haven't tasted any but the combination of brown sugar/butter/honey/cardamom smelled absolutely wonderful while baking.  I compressed the bars again when I took them out of the oven, and by cooling COMPLETELY I'm anxious to see if that eliminates the crumbling problem that other reviewers have reported.  Later...yes, they did come out of the pan and cut in bars perfectly.  I didn't use the foil either, just sprayed the glass pan very well.

Good flavor. Substituted pecans for the walnuts.  The bars didn't hold together so I'd probably cook it a little longer next time.

Who knew you could make your own granola bars??  I was afraid I'd let the butter/sugar/honey boil a bit too long, but they came out perfectly.  I did use the tin foil (saturated with cooking spray).  The bars sliced up nicely with minimal crumbling.  I love the peppery taste of cardamom, but this was a bit much and needs to be cut back to 1 tsp.  I can't wait to try this again as there is so much you can change up - the fruit, the nuts, the spice, adding chocolate morsels etc. I love recipes like this that inspire my creativity!

Reduced sugar to 1/4 cup, used only 2 tbsp butter and added 4 tbsp applesauce.  The flavour was very good but despite pressing it as flat as I could into the pan it was still fairly crumbly and a bit dry (thought that part may have been because of my playing around with the fat content).  I baked for 27 minutes but would probably remove even earlier next time.  I will make again but try to think of other changes to make it hold together better.

This is a fantastic recipe. I have had a lot of fun adding different things to this. So far I prefer a cup of mixed dried fruits and chopped peanuts. I began making these for my kids to eat before sporting events, but ended up having my hubby ask for more as he enjoyed them as a quick hearty breakfast before work.   I even added chocolate chips by accident once not thinking about what would happen when I added the hot mixture...what a yummy accident that was! The kids liked the treat of "chocolate bars" as stirring in the heated mix melted all the chips promptly making a very yummy treat.

Fantastic flavor but fell apart and became more granola than bar.  Next time will add an egg white and reduce the wet ingredients.  Really versatile recipe.  You could add salted roasted edamame/soy nuts, crasins, flax, sesame....go for it! Definitely worth a try.

I changed this review from a 4 to 5 stars; at first taste, after I put them in the fridge to cool was all-right, but a bit too hard and crumbly. After I wrapped in foil and left on the counter they softened up to a nice and chewy granola bar. My son loved them; I added dates, pecans, raisins and mini marshmallows! YUM!..

Dangerous recipe---because you can't stop eating them!  The cardamom is different, but certainly not too strong.  Very good.

Great stuff! I used craisins and since I'm allergic to nuts, used some gluten-free chocolate rice puff cereal and coconut flakes. Added a 1/4 cup of Enjoy Life chocolate chips too. Will add them well after mixing in the heated butter/sugar/honey mix so they don't melt! Can't wait to try this basic recipe with cinnamon instead of cardamom, which my 7-year-old didn't care for.

My first granola bars turned out great for our long bike ride!  I substituted walnuts for toasted sliced almonds and added .5t more of ground cardamom.  Next time I think I'll add a bit more raisin or mix it up with dark chocolate and wheat germ.  Very sweet and tasty granola bar!

I brought this to work today & everyone loved it. I only had about a half T of honey so I used 1/2 T Molasses & 2 T Sugar Free Syrup. A bit less Cardamom. Toasted Walnuts, Slivered Almonds & Sunflower seeds. Took it out at 23 minutes because I felt like the sunflower seeds were starting to get too dark. Delish! It ended up Granola, but everyone was very impressed.

I should've followed my gut on this one. There's WAY too much cardamom (and I only used about half called for because I was using the pods and got tired of crushing them open!). And a couple tablespoons too much butter, so they look and feel greasy. They did not need 30 minutes in the oven.

These were really good, and I love the cardamon flavor. I took the advice of several other reviewers and used dried cranberries instead of raisins, added just a little less brown sugar, and made sure to press the mixture together really well and let them cool completely before cutting. I also mixed in a little ground flax seed for added fiber. They held together ok, but the end pieces were pretty crumbly. I saved the pieces that crumbled as I was cutting them and used them as a topper for vanilla yogurt--delicious!

I should have followed other reviews with regards to the issue of the bars holding together. The taste and smell was wonderful, but it was falling apart so I put it back in the oven and I overcooked it. Don't cook it for too much longer - otherwise you'll get granola :) which was still yummy. I used it to top yogurt, and well, I just ate it with a spoon because it was so good. I'll have to leave it cool next time before cutting to see how it works, or try patting it down after it comes out of the oven like a couple others said to do.

These are quite good, maybe a little too much Cardamom for me.  Followed the recipe exactly, although used wax paper to line the pan as I had no foil.  NO problems at all with any sticking.

I whipped these up in no time and served them to some friends and family - all of them gave rave reviews. Personally I would cut the cardamom in half and perhaps add some cinnamon. I recommend waiting to cut the bars. They were prone to fall apart even after being out of the oven cooling for 15 minutes. So I packed them in with the foil from the pan to keep them together and cut them an hour later. Only one fell apart. I subbed pecans for walnuts. Great recipe!

These bars were really, really good. I was skeptical about the cardamom at first and only added 1 tsp, but it does give a nice flavor. Next time I will add the full amount.

MY bars fell apart...Not sure if I need to pack them harder in the pan or cook longer. I would try both next time. Cardamon was a little too much for me, I would use less next time...though it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be while I was making this. Over all they were ok...

absolutely LOVED this!  the bars were chewy, just the way I like my granola bars, and all the flavors melded together so nicely.  It really is a dangerous recipe, because I could make them all the time!  In fact, I think I will!! Thanks for sharing.

Very nice, although mine crumbled to granola when I tried cut them.  I love the flavors though, and it'll work just fine as cereal.  I didn't really measure, so I probably didn't use enough honey.  I did cut back on the sugar and it wasn't too too sweet. There is a lot of cardamom; I'll use less next time just because it's a strong flavor and I probably won't be able to get bf to eat it as is.  He doesn't seem to be a huge fan of cardamom.  Otherwise, it's perfect.  Thanks for the recipe!

I thought these were pretty good.  I would make them again, but with less cardamom.  Apparently, I don't LOVE cardamom, because I thought the flavor was too much.  I didn't personally think they were too sweet, though.

I didn't really like the cardamom flavor in the granola bars, however, all of my kids ate them.  I did add chocolate chips to them and didn't use the nuts.

Very crispy and not too sweet. I baked them in a silicon preformed granola pan by Pampered Chef. Reduced temp to 325 and baked them for 20 min.  I also dried cranberries instead of raisins. I love the taste.

Amazing recipe! Although I personalized it a little: instead of walnuts I used almonds. Also I used cocos, vanilated sugar, vanilla and rom extract and cinammon. Cannot stop eating :))

Thanks.  I used applesauce instead of butter, splenda instead of brown sugar, and left out the cardamom.  These were good, and they would have also tasted good as no bake cookies.
