This was my first time making sausage.  I halved this recipe using lean ground pork (4% fat) and it was sooo tasty - much, much better than anything store bought. I crushed the spices in a mortar and pestle together and squeezed excess moisture from the ground meat before incorporating everything together. I never made mine into patties, instead I made pizza and stuffed bell peppers with it.  Delicious!

I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed this recipe. I use Italian sausage in my spaghetti and lasagna but now I will never buy the prepared sausage again. My family and I loved it.

We loved this sausage.  Hubby tried it by itself and with a pasta sauce on homemade bread.  He said he would give it a "bunch of stars".  Thanks for posting the recipe.

"Robert's Homemade Italian Sausage" is excellent! I have made this recipe at least a dozen times now. I love this combination of spices so much that I now have a large jar of it in my cupboard that I use it for flavoring ground meats (beef, veal, and pork) for different things: meat patties; stuffed peppers; cabbage rolls; and meat balls. I also plan to give jars of it as gifts for Christmas. Thank Robert for sharing your recipe. I no longer have to go to a gourmet butcher shop to get excellent Italian sausage!

These sausages are excellent but as written I gave it 4 stars because they are very dry.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time.  The second time I used 2 lbs. of pork to 2 lbs. of turkey and they are better tasting than anything you can buy.  The only thing I didn't have is anise seed but I prefer fennel in sausage.  I did increase the salt to 1/2  tsp. and I only used 1/4 tsp. cayenne but next time I'll try 1/2 tsp. cayenne as they weren't too spicy.  Thanks Robert.

Just used this tonight to season up my pasta sauce and it turned out great. I halved the recipe and didn't have any pork on hand and it still came out great. I also didn't have any mace or nutmeg to replace it so I used a pinch (literally) of cloves and it was enough to enhance the flavor without overpowering. Didn't even use casings to make sausage, but mixed it all together in a bowl. Highly recommend, esp if you have ground turkey and don't know what to do with it!

This is good sausage but I think the measurements are off. I doubled this recipe for 6 pounds of meat and came up extremely short in salt.   I also noticed the minced onion amount seemed a bit light. I wonder if onion salt would cure both issues I had. I used a sweet red wine and eliminated the sugar because that's what I had and it seems to work with it. Certainly deserves another try.

Loved it.  I omit the fennel and anise because I don't care for them.  I like this much better than store bought!

I grounded 300 gm pork belly and add 1/4 of the seasonings and used the following ingredients to replace those  that I did not have:
ginger powder to replace minced dried onion;
cumin to replace coriander seeds;
nutmeg, dash of white pepper and dash of cinnamon to replace mace;
also add one egg white to make it juicy.
I made 8 pcs 4 inches (approx) sausages.  
I found the taste perfect except it was rather dry.  
If anybody had successfully improve on this, please kindly share with me.  Thank you very much!

Excellent recipe. I didn't have mace, so I substituted nutmeg, which is what mace comes from. Also for some reason I didn't have onion powder, so I left it out. Also didn't have any wine on hand so I left it out. I used two parts ground turkey to one part ground pork sausage.

 This recipe is very forgiving if you don't have exact measurements, so I just estimated in the palm of my hand how much of each ingredient. Turned out really good. 

I used a cast iron skillet with a light coating of olive oil to prevent sticking. Browned the pieces in approximately 1" pieces and then finished the cooking in red sauce with spaghetti.  I can't even taste the turkey, which is awesome. Not a fan of turkey but it's healthy.

"Robert's Homemade Italian Sausage" is one of my favorite recipes on Allrecipes. I should print it so I don't lose it. In particular, I use the combination of seasonings all the time to season meat for other dishes (i.e. stuffed peppers). Yummy!  Thank you Robert for sharing your recipe.

I am on a VERY low sodium diet, being Italian that means no sausage heartbreaking! . This recipe is very versatile. If I am making meatballs I just make this recipe and add more ground beef. If I am making a baked pasta dish or meat sauce I make this recipe then and cook it then add my sauce ingredients. I never have what the recipe calls for but I substitute Italian seasoning or look up an substitution, You can not substitute the fennel seeds! I Truly love this recipe! Thank you so much for sharing, I make it at least once a week!

I used only ground turkey and made as patties. Very moist and full of flavour. I would make again.

The sausage are dry and flavorless.  I double the seasoning and that seemed to help the flavor department.  I'll eat what we made, but won't be making it again.

I made this with half chicken thigh and half chicken breast. It was so delicious!!!! I have two extra lbs vacusealed in the freezer. Can't wait to use it for my zucchini lasagna. I also didn't have anise or mace so I didn't use those and I used a couple tablespoons of balsamic in place of the red wine. Turned out wonderfully. (Oh, I also added more salt because well... I love salt).

I used this recipe as my meat in spaghetti sauce (gravy) - did not make into patties, nor did I put into casings, but merely browned the seasoned ground meat into crumbles, then added the sauce.  I only used 2# ground turkey (no pork), but kept spice measurements the same (except didn't have any mace, so just proceeded without it).

This is wonderful - very flavorful, tasted like good Italian sausage.  Thanks for a great recipe!

I used this recipe to make crumbled, Italian sausage out of beef or game meat.  I then used the meat to make homemade lasagna.  It is an amazing recipe that turns boring (or gamey meat) into something wonderful!  You don’t need to fight with casings if you don’t have them.  This is perfect for lasagna or sausage patties!
