I made these but added some minced garlic, garlic powder and onion powder to the cream cheese filling. I used half a slice of bacon. I used a disposable decorator bag to pipe the filling down the bacon for a mess free application! These turned out great!

The platter was empty within 10 minutes of the party starting.  I didn't feel like doing all the math so I used 1 8 oz package of cream chees and 1 cup of brown sugar.  It made enough for 3 lbs of bacon.  I cut the bacon slices in half.  Net time I'm going to finish them off under the broiler as they weren't as crispy as I would like and I cooked them for over 30 minutes.

using a full slice of bacon the cooking time is closer to 30 minutes at 375 degrees.  Maybe a half slice of bacon would yield a quicker baking time.

The flavor was outstanding though.  I will do this again and adjust bacon size or temperature for a full slice.

This recipe idea is genius!  I cooked the bacon on a wire rack in the oven for 20 minutes then took out to cool.  I added chopped pickled jalape√±os to the cream cheese, little less sugar, then rolled them up.  Once rolled I sprinkled just a little brown sugar on top and fresh crushed black pepper.  I cooked them for 15 more minutes and they were perfect & delish!  I served them with Chile sauce on the side and celery sticks.

Strange recipe.  One slice of bacon?  I used 8 oz brick of crm chs and 1/2 cup of brown sugar.  First batch was pretty much a disaster.  I used 1/2 strip of bacon second time around and used a much smaller amount of the sugar mixture.  I a so used my broiler pan with slits in the top so the bacon grease drained down. I think this is the most important correction to the recipe as the logs weren't swimming in grease and leaking cheese.

Couldn't find applewood so used honey smoked bacon.  Added cayenne pepper and garlic to cream cheese and brown sugar mixture (used less brown sugar per reviews).  Cooked bacon 1/2 slices first for 20 minutes at 375 degrees prior to filling and rolling.  Put mixture in baggie and piped in to bacon slices then cooked another 20 minutes.  Can you say DERBY appetizer???

I had my doubts while they were cooking because the cream cheese mixture leaks out and the bacon rolls are in a lagoon of it. However, they tasted really really good and I will definitely makes these again.

These were a hit - I used half a slice of bacon as someone else suggested.  Super easy recipe, I will definitely make this again.

Just a tad too sweet for our liking but other than that these were great. Spreading the cream cheese down the bacon isn't the easiest task however it stays inside the bacon nicely when cooked. I was expecting it all to run out but it did not.

I would only use half a slice of bacon and if it is a thick piece I would slice it again. Otherwise, adjust your cooking time  accordingly. Great flavor! Great hit at a cocktail party!

Followed the recipe exactly and it instantly turned out to be a family favourite.  Would have taken a picture but before I could grab the camera the plate was empty.

I followed the suggestions to cut the bacon rasher in half. I baked the rashers at 375F for 15 minutes. 
I made the appetizer savory by mixing cream cheese and chopped sun dried tomatoes and green onions together.  After assembly and securing with a tooth pick, I served without further baking since the bacon was cooked as is.

I used Honey and sea salt bacon and it was the big hit of the party. The flavor worked well together. Next time im trying sweet ghost pepper bacon. Stay tuned.

Ew. The one reviewer who was surprised the filling didn't boil out should have seen the mess that was on my baking sheet. The bacon was basically boiling in a soup of cream cheese and brown sugar. I cut the bacon pieces in half, as suggested by another reviewer, but maybe I tried to put too many on the sheet at once (because who really cooks one at a time?). Th the flavor was not worth a second attempt, tho. Sorry.

I made these and I was disappointed. Glad that I only made 3. The cream cheese and sugar spread spilled out of the wrapped bacon while cooking. 15 minutes seemed to leave the bacon a little raw for my liking. It would not crisp up and eventually the sugar began to burn past carmelized. I do not personally like chewy bacon, this is a no for me.
