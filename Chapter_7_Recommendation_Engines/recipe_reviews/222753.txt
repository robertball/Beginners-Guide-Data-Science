I had 3 pears that needed to be used up, and this recipe fit the bill. I scaled this down to 4 servings. I didn't have a can of sour cherries on hand, but I did have some dried cherries. I just soaked them for about 20 minutes in hot water, and then drained.  Worked great! I really liked the pear/cherry combination. I baked mine in ramekins for 30 minutes. Thanks!
