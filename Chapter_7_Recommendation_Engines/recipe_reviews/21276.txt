As a personal chef, I may try a dozen or so recipes before I settle on one to present to a customer. This is where I stop on crab cakes! These are the best I've ever had. A better name would be crab burgers. Make sure to use lump meat because they really just hold themselves together. And the dipping sauce is wonderful. My husband made me make them two nights in a row!

I have finally found a winning crab cake recipe.  These crab cakes are incredible.  It has the perfect amount of filling to crab ratio, which for me is you barely taste filling and all crab.

  I made a few adjustments; used Ritz Crackers, sauteed a very small amount of onions/celery/garlic, added a little cayenne and crushed red pepper.  I mixed everything e except the crab meat and put that in last and just turned with a spatula so I didn't break the lumps.  After forming the crab cakes, I topped each with a little extra old bay seasoning.  For crab I used Blue Star pasteurized lump crab meat in the packet, it was very good. 

I have no opinion on the sauce as I like a sweeter sauce, so I went with the Honey Mustard II another poster suggested, with some adjustments it was excellent as well.

Great recipe. I found that you don't need the egg if you prefer them w/o. Forming the cakes into balls first and flattening once the first side begins to brown is essential.

Great crab cakes!  A true "non filler" crab cake.  Only thing I did different is added crushed red pepper (I like it Hot!)  If you've never made these before, I'd advise you to choose this receipe! ENJOY

These were great just as everyone suggested.  I used two 16oz plastic tubs of crab meat chunks and combined with two 12oz cans of crab meat - all for under $10.  I added a few extra spices for a bit of extra kick including 2x the Old Bay seasoning, and a dash of powdered garlic, crushed red peppers and pepper.  I also added fresh diced sweet onion and red pepper to "hearten" the cakes for a main dish.  Rather than sauting, I opted to broil until the cakes were golden brown on both sides.  The cakes held together fine and tasted perfectly; they even had a bit of a crunch.  The sauce was a perfect compliment to the cakes - although be forewarned, the sauce doesnt taste very well on its own.  

I highly recommend this recipe.

I've been living in New England for a year and enjoying the local seafood.  Who knew the best crab cakes I've tasted would come right from my own kitchen!  The taste of crab really shines through in this recipe (not like some I've had that are more seasoning than seafood) and the lime/cilantro mayo is the perfect accompaniment.

Yes, these were good/great crabcakes.  In fact, had I not tasted the Ginger Crabcakes, another recipe on this site that "takes the cake" (it is AWESOME), I would have given these a 5. The sauce was not so much a hit, tho it did add a little "something" to tantilize the taste buds...just not worth the trouble or calories.  The best thing about the recipe was that it did in fact have only little filler, so what you get is crab, crab, and more crab.  Refrigerating it as suggested is imperitive; otherwise, they will crumble.  Wish I could give 4 1/2.

Awesome!!!  These were the best crab cakes that I have ever had!!  I must admit I did make some changes, I added about 1/2 cup each of fresh chopped celery and onion, and about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder. And I broiled them for about 10 to 12 minutes, and they were the most wonderful crab cakes!  My husband and son really enjoyed them.  (The celery stayed a little crunchy, which my husband liked).  Will certainly keep this recipe!!!

My family and I were very happy with these crab cakes! I am a beginning cook and this was my first time making crab cakes, but they still were a major hit. My older cousin said that she has had many crab cakes and this was one of the best ones she had ever had. She noted that they were especially light, as opposed to an overly rich and heaven (mayo-laden) crab cake.  A few things I should note: I used 6 cans of lump crab meat (drained weight was 27 oz.). I combined this with 1/2 c. mayo and 1/2 cup of crushed crackers, as well as the seasoning, an egg, and lemon zest. this ended up making 8 fairly large crab cakes. We ate half of them just a little after shaping them (a few hrs setting in the fridge) and the we ate other half the next day for lunch. The ones we had the next day at lunch had a distinct lemon flavor, while that's not something that was prominent the previous night. I suppose that the lemon zest took on more flavor as it sat overnight.

I just made these tonight - my husband and son LOVED them.  I followed others' suggestions and only used 1/2 cup mayonnaise and added quite a bit more spice: more Old Bay, some cayenne, red pepper flakes, garlic, and some Emeril's Original Essence. I think the crab cakes would be bland without all the extra seasonings. Also, I sauteed celery, onion, and red pepper in butter and added, and used Ritz crackers as others suggested. (Used a little more than 1 cup crackers and my cakes stayed together just fine). Will be making these again!

GREAT! I cut the recipe in half, added one more egg and more crackers. YOU MUST let them sit in the refrigerator and get cold then they will stay together when cooking.

At first I didn't think that anyone else had problems with this dish. I had to search through all 1,000+ ratings in reverse order to see that others had my results too. The crab cake was lacking egg and cracker crumbs and ended up just falling apart. I used to make crab cakes fresh after catching/cleaning with my parents back home in WA, but now in TN I tried using pre-cleaned store bought. I don't know if it's a difference in the fresh v. frozen texture or truly the lack of egg+cracker. All I know is that right now I'm making the worst crab stir fry ever. This did NOT take on the cake form for me at all.

These melt in your mouth.  I would love to rate this a 5 but I changed the recipe.  I only used 1 Lbs Crab Meat (enough for 2), just squeezed a little bit of lemon juice, about 1/4 teaspoon plus 1/8 teaspoon of Old Bay (I will add more next time), 12 saltine crackers, 1/8 cup of mayo and about 2 tbsp of mustard. Then a small dash of garlic powder and pepper. I actually made this early in the day only adding 8 crackers, then put the mix in fridge.  Right before I started cooking, I made the patties and I added the 4 last   crackers.  *I did not make the sauce.

I used panko bread crumbs which worked great and also added chopped green onion tops and a bit more old bay seasoning.  Would recommend 1st beating the egg before adding and mixing crab by hand so you don't breakup the lumps.

These crab cakes are phenomenal. Having been born and raised in Baltimore, I have tasted many crab cakes in my day, and this recipe is definitely up to par by my standards. My only suggestion is to make sure that jumbo lump meat is used, and to throw in just a bit more old bay than the recipe calls for. I enjoyed this recipe and would absolutely reccomend it to anyone.

Wall-to-wall crab! These are perfect as written - and MUST be chilled before frying. None of mine fell apart prepared according to the directions. The sauce is good, too. I also garnished these with a bit of chili-garlic sauce for heat. Thanks for the recipe!

My first time making crab cakes and these were awesome.  I did however add minced onion, crushed red pepper & garlic salt for a kick.  I also made a different sauce:  1/2 c mayo, 1T cilantro, 1/2t lime zest & 1T lime juice

Great crabcakes whether made with saltines or Ritz.  I make them with a home-made remoulade sauce and they are OUTSTANDING.  I'm not willing to try the sauce included with teh recipe, I can tell it has too much oil for my taste.

With remoulade the crabcakes are awesome alone or over fettucini pasta.

Enjoy!

Absolutely perfect! I used dried basil and it still came out well.  I "pasteurized" the egg yolk for the sauce by briefly (about a minute) dipping it into "just boiled water (somewhere between 70-90F).

Bland, very sloppy, fell apart, too much lemon flavor.  Followed recipe to a T.  Will not make again.  How there are so many great reviews, I do not know.

The crab cakes get 5 stars but the sauce is just really gross!  With the cakes, I followed suggestions from others about adding more seasoning, onion, and cilantro.  I also used imitation crab meat since that is what we had - and it worked out just as well. And keeping the cakes cold before frying was a great suggestion.  Thanks for this recipe!

I scaled the recipe first off to 8 servings and made exactly as stated with the exception of using only 1/2 the amount of crab meat the recipe called for, which was plenty. I found frozen crab meat at the fish market for $10/pound, which is all I used. I did find the "Honey Mustard Dressing II" recipe off this website to be a better dipping sauce than the one listed in the recipe. Everyone preferred it, especially the kids. I did think the cakes needed a little more spicing up and next time will add more seasoning - especially some garlic! Thanks for the post! 4.5 stars!

A bit time consuming to make, in fact, I skipped making the sauce completely. But very good. Everyone at my party raved about them. However, this recipe calls for 4 lbs crabmeat, which was ridiculous at $21/lb. I only used 1 lb and it turned out fine.

These crab cakes are amazing-probably the best I have ever had! I used light mayo and it did not make a difference. I tasted the sauce by itself and thought it was just ok but it is absolutely delicious on the crab cakes. Make sure you use real lump crab meat.

I used two 1 lb cans of claw meat and then four smaller cans of diced meat and added 1/8 tsp extra of old bay, 1/4 tsp cayenne, 1/2 cup diced celery and onion and about another 1/2 cup of crackers just to try to get it to hold together.  I made them into small balls and rolled in panko crumbs before frying.  Next time will make with only the two large cans of meat as the smaller ones were too watery and the recipe just made too many servings.

Super tasty!  Just make sure for me next time to use right amount of mayo and egg to keep the cake sticking together.  Herbs really come out on this one!  Sauce = not very good and not needed.

We just make this recipe with king crab and it was the best tasting crab cake we have ever tasted. We followed the original and only substituted Ritz for the saltines.My husband used to work summers at Ocean City, Maryland's most famous seafood restaurant, and he said these crab cakes are the best hands down.

What an incredibly easy crab cake recipe this is!  I used wheat Ritz crackers and added about a half cup of sliced scallions.  I will definately be making these again.  My husband had four of these little suckers!  YUM-MY!

First time making crabcakes.  I thought they were excellent, and they got rave reviews from the rest of the family.  Would have been just as excellent without the sauce (for those of you who are made a little nervous by raw egg yolk, like I am).

This recipe was great, but I would not buy fresh crab for this dish-unless you want to go broke.  I'd use others suggestions next time and make it with canned crab. I liked the crunchiness from the crackers and the real crab taste you preserved (the filling wasn't overpowering like most crab cake recipes)

Awesome. Love them so much that I can't order crab cakes out to eat anymore because they wont stand up to this recipe. I once screwed them up because I didn't have any vegetable oil and substituted olive oil, big mistake as the cakes wont hold their shape and turns into a plate of mush. Otherwise perfect recipe.

DANG!!!!!  We craved these again the next day!  Have to admit, though, I used the imitation crab meat blend from the fridge section of the store and shredded the chunks really well.  Nobody knew and it was very cost-effective.  Outstanding recipe!

Delicious! I was nervous to make crab cakes for the first time but this recipe made it so easy. I only made half the recipe, including "half an egg". I used canned special white crabmeat which worked well, crushed saltines in food processor, and eyeballed the seasonings. I baked in the oven at 400 degrees until lightly browned on both sides. Dolloped cakes with red pepper sauce found on this site, which was also wonderful.  Served with green salad and cheese grits. Definitely a crowd pleaser!!

I never order crab cakes out; don't care for them; but this reciepe caught my eye. I used a little less mayo and a little bit more egg to hold the crab together because I don't care for a strong mayo taste. Also added just a bit of finely chopped red pepper, garlic, and onion. They were out of this world! So moist and tasty.... Whole family loved them.

I didn't rate this high because I didnt think it was great. It was good but I had to adjust the sauce, it was too oily and so I added more lime and cilantro. It could be because I had changed the recipe to yield 5 servings and some recipes don't adjust well. I would be interested in if any one else had the same result.

These were tasty, but a little too bland for a 5* rating. I added a bit of red pepper, which helped. I do, though, love how these taste like crab, not filler. The sauce was great and a perfect addition.

Awesome recipe. Love the amount of crab meat and little filling.
However, my patties fell apart when cooking in pan so I had to add more egg, ritz crackers, and mayonnaise to the original mixture (almost doubled recipe). Then the patties stayed together for the cooking. You might also want to add more Old Bay seasoning for more flavor in case your guests do not like the dipping sauce. Very delicious recipe for the crab cake.

I made these yesterday and they came out soft in the center but still firm on the outside. I changed the spicy part for garam masala - an Indian spice - and it was divine.

this was an over all good recipe.  I used crushed ritz crackers instead of saltines.  I like the buttery taste of the ritz.  Also, the amount of lime juice in the sauce needs to be scaled back by about half.  Otherwise the sauce becomes too sour.

I loved this recipe.  This is the first crab cake recipe that I tried that was successful for me.  The next time I make it, the only thing I will change is to add a little bit more seasoning (either old bay or salt and pepper).

These crab cakes were awesome!  I halved the batch and did half of that with canned crab and half with lump crabmeat from the seafood counter at my local store - the lump crabmeat was WAY better!!   I would've given this recipe five stars except that none of my family liked the accomanying sauce - it was much too lime-y for our tastes.  Crab cakes tasted fine on their own though :)  Two thumbs up!

I scaled this down to 12 oz. of crab. I also used bread crumbs instead of crackers, added a few red pepper flakes, and a dash of hot sauce and the results were delicious! My crab cakes came out looking exactly like the picture....

Definitely the best crab cakes there are. Fresh tasting, and easy! I would give the sauce 4 stars, as many people I have made this recipe for omit the sauce and still LOVE these crab cakes. I use buttery crackers (townhouse, Ritz, etc) instead of saltines.

i made this last night and it was wonderful.  we added chopped onion, celery, and minced garlic.  i also doubled the old bay.  to keep them from falling apart while cooking they must be very cold.  i cooked them 2 at a time and kept the rest of the mix in the fridge.

Very good, tasty recipe.  I used fresh crab from my seafood market and then prepared teh cakes using a round cookie mold for consistent cakes.  The only reason this got four stars was because of the high price.

I prepared this recipe as an appetizer for a dinner we were having with friends and everyone loved it.  I would definitely make it again.  Even though the crab cakes were delicious on their own, the sauce makes them even more delectable.  I will definitely make this again.

Absolutely delicious! I made these crab cakes today for lunch. I only used 1 pound of lump crab, the good stuff is expensive! It made enough for 10 medium sized patties. (3 for me, 3 for my boyfriend for a full entree with steamed broccolini and some toasted garlic bread, 1 for a snack, and 3 more for lunch the next day for me!) So for my 1 pound of crab, I used one full egg, 1/4 cup crushed saltines, 1/4 cup Japanese Kewpie mayo, about a half teaspoon of lemon zest, a bit of the chopped fresh basil, about a small handful or so of Panko bread crumbs, a little bit of chopped scallions, and about a half teaspoon or so of the Old Bay seasoning. Formed them and put in the fridge. Definitely let them get cold before frying! Then fried a couple minutes on each side with some veggie oil on medium heat. When done, let dry on same paper towels to absorb oil. AWESOME. For my sauce I stuck to the sort of Japanese inspired idea, I took some kewpie Japanese mayo, added some some zest and a small bit of lime juice, and a dollop of sriracha sauce. It came out tangy and zesty and spicy and creamy! My boyfriend said it was too lime-y so next time I would make his with no lime (pretty much just sushi style spicy mayo) and mine with the lime because I liked it. I might add more old bay seasoning and a little less lemon zest next time to the cakes. Overall though, awesome.

Switch it up! Basic recipe is good but I changed several things.
2 lbs. lump crab meat, 4 tablespoons fresh chopped basil, 2 tablespoon fresh chopped cilantro, 1 cup Panko bread crumbs, 1/2 cup Tartar sauce instead of mayo, zest from 2 lemons, 2 beaten eggs, 1/2 teaspoons Old Bay, 1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning, dash of Tabasco. Delicious! You can really taste the crab, plus a lot of flavor.  Made 3 1/2 cup size patties and 11 1/4 cup size patties. Love it! You can really taste the crab and it has great flavor!

Not good, but not bad either. Lacked flavor to a disappointing degree and needed more binding to stay together in the plan. I'll look elsewhere.

My girlfriend and I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner for just the two of us.  It was fantastic, and though we quartered the original recipe, we also steamed some clams and made some pasta with pesto to go with it all.  Overall, it was about as perfect a meal as I could imagine.

This is the first crab cake recipe I ever tried, and I'm not going to try any others.  I was attracted to it because I have to eat gluten-free, and I figured the small amount of filler would make it easier to adapt.  And I was right. I use gluten-free corn-flake crumbs, because I always keep them on hand, but with such little filler, I think rice crumbs or any GF cracker or bread crumb would work.  After making this many times, I double the Old Bay, which gives it a little more traditional flavor, but still doesn't overpower the wonderful lemon and basil flavor.  I also add a little diced shallot.  As far as the sauce, I love it, and it goes wonderfully with the crab cakes. I advise you to try it so you don't miss out. However, I don't make the sauce as directed because of the raw egg. I add the lime juice and spices to a half-half mixture of mayonnaise and sour cream. Not only is it safer, but faster and easier.

We liked this recipe, my husband had requested crab cakes and was very happy with these.  We used lump crab.  I know the recipe is meant to have very little filler, but I found these were kind of falling apart in the pan, I my add a little more filler next time to make them stick together a bit better.  Also the sauce was very good, I was unsure about the raw eggs but we liked it.  I only made 4 cakes and less sauce, so I actually whisked it by hand and that worked fine.

First time I ever made crab cakes.  A few modifications:  used 8 oz of crab meat.  12 oz of shrimp (Tangy Shrimp) and 6 oz of salmon (Chili Garlic BBQ Salmon).  blended the fish in a food processor.  modified the ingredients a bit since it was less than 4 pounds.  Also, on the sauce, for some reason the vegetable oil killed the fragrance of the cilantro.  So I added more cilantro, lime juice and an egg.   Turned out GREAT.

I give these a 5 for taste: the lemon zest was so yummy and the crab flavor really comes through.  I had a VERY hard time getting these to hold together though.  I used kitchen scales to weigh 4 lbs. of canned lump meat (8-12oz cans drained), but those stinkers fell apart in the pan.  We called it crab heap instead of crab cakes and ate a ton (my 6 year old especially!).  Did add 2 tbs. green onion, and made my own lemon/Old Bay aioli.

I am a crab cake fanatic. Tonight, I made the crab cakes and not the sauce. They were amazing!!! Restaurant quality at home. I used crackers I had on hand which were ritz crackers. I didn't want to buy a box of saltines and have the rest of them go to waste since we don't eat those in our house. Other than that, I followed the recipe and got rave reviews from my husband (picky eater). We used hot sauce on top of them. Delicious!!! This recipe is a definite keeper. Note: We used backfin and will try lump next time just because!!!

Growing up near the Jersey shore, my family is full of seafood lovers... and we're picky about our seafood!  Well, everyone in my family loved this recipe.  It's easy to make and delicious.  One variation is that I used Ritz crackers in place of Saltines because that's all I had... still delicious.  Also, I served the crabcakes with a sauce made with just about equal parts mayo and dijon mustard...this is a sauce we would dip lump crabmeat in, so it's great with these crabcakes!  Delicious!

Definitely the best crab cakes I ever made.  I'd say they're every bit as good, or better than any crab cakes I ever ordered, too.  The sauce was interesting, and I'd probably make it again, but I think next time I'll try that Honey Mustard sauce and see how I like it.

These were very good, especially with the "roumelade sauce a la New Orleans" from this site.  It was pretty tricky keeping them from falling apart, but I managed.  You just have to make sure you get the first side really nice and browned before you turn them over.

this recipe was amazing. I made these for one of the courses in our christmas eve dinner. I only had 3lbs of crab meat and did everything else as directed, except I did make them smaller,  and they came out great.  everyone wanted more. also, I am not a big fan of cilantro, so I used a lemon/basil aioli instead of lime/cilantro, everyone wanted to know what the green sauce was. another big hit.  thank you again for this recipe I will be making them every christmas eve now.

Easy to make, light and flaky, and the best crab cakes I've ever tasted. I didn't have the right amt of crab meat, only 2 cans, and it came out great, making 5 round 3x3 size. I didn't know crab cakes can taste so good. Even my 18yr old son was suprised that he likes these too.

Good.  I had to cut recipe because I only had one pound of crab.  My 3 and 6 year old liked them, but I wouldn't say my search for the perfect crab cake is over.  I didn't use the sauce suggested, I used a different crab cake sauce that I found on this site that is EXCELLENT.

These tasted pretty good.  It was my first attempt to make them, and i cut the recipe for only three people.  But the sauce on the side i didnt not think i would like and my husband was skeptical seeing to as he helped me make them.  However we were both pretty impressed with it, and we will make them again!

Great recipe.  I served them over angel hair pasta, and drizzled the sauce over all.  New family favorite.  I also added some crushed red pepper to heat things up a bit.

These crab cakes were good but not as good as others I've tasted... It could be because I didn't add any lemon zest and I also added garlic powder, black pepper and a little soul seasoning.  I will definitely try these again though! Thanks!

Made this and everyone loved it.  My daughter is now rquesting that I make it for her birthday dinner, that won't happen for another 6 months.  I used 3 pounds of crabmeat instead of 4 and it still came out great.

Being a bit of a "Cajunophile" (is that a word?), I substituted a popular Creole spice mix in lieu of the Old Bay . . .  It works quite well.

I live in the Northwest by the ocean and make fish, shellfish and other local produce all the time and this has to be the worst recipe that I have made in a long time. It had very little flavor, in my opinion, and the sauce that you make to serve with it, was terrible. I will not make this one again, which surprises me as I have made and enjoy so many of the recipes presented on this site.

Best crab cake ever! I made these for my parents, and they said they would never order a crab cake from a restaurant again, and they've eaten at all the best seafood restaurants in downtown Chicago. I  used a full teaspoon of old bay, and only added 3 pounds of lump crabmeat, and they were absolutely delicious! I bought 4 pounds, but it looked like enough crabmeat after adding the first pound. I  reluctantly added the second, then the third pound of meat. In the future I will use 3 pounds only. I  followed a user's suggestion to add the meat to the mixture after already blended. We didn't even taste the sauce because the crab cakes were so good! These are for people who truly appreciate the crab...and don't want the cake part.

This was my first time making crab cakes and boy was this recipe good. It's so simple and doesn't have a lot of "filler" but all crab. If they are really cold they will stay together nicely. I didn't have an hour or more to wait for the fridge so I gut them in the freezer while I made the sauce. The only thing I changed was I added one diced scallion to the crab meat mixture and a 1/4 tsp of garlic powder.  I cut the recipe in half and it was more than plenty for my husband and I. Don't let the sauce scare you! I was scared at first, but it was really good and paired with the crab cake was amazing. Not just good but honestly amazing!! This is probably one of the best recipes I've ever used off of all recipes and I've used this website for years. This is a show stopper kind of a meal.

Nobody in the family really cared for this crab cake.  I mixed and cooked some fresh and they fell apart. So I froze some and baked them. The baked retained the cake form, but the flavor was still lacking.

The only change I made was the substitution of panko crumbs for the saltine crackers. These crab cakes are delicious!!  I have had many great Maryland crab cakes and I was looking for a good recipe.  This recipe is restaurant quality.  My entire family loved these crab cakes and I'm making them again seven days later!

Made these for the first time tonight and they turned out fabulous. I did not have fresh crab to work with, but I did use the store bought imitation crab. Even when using this crab meat, the cakes held together great and tasted even better!

When I first made these I had never made crab cakes before.  I made just as directed.  They were so delicious I have made them several times now.  I will no longer order crab cakes from a restaurant because the bar has been raised too far by this recipe.  They are easy and delicious.  And I agree with another reviewer, they should be called " Crab burgers". Thank you for this awesome recipe!

Love the recipe! I messed up the prep a bit, and it was a little mushy, nonetheless very tasty! The dipping sauce was a huge hit also... I'm still learning to cook (period) I will definitely try this one again!

This was just wonderful! For the batter, we dipped in an egg wash. Then tossed in a mixture of flour, bread crumbs, old bay and a 5 pepper seasoning. Saltine crackers were added in both the crab mix and batter.Next time I might try in peanut oil. Fantastic recipe ! ty!

I have no idea what went wrong.  I followed the recipe EXACTLY and the cakes completly fell apart.  When I decided to give up and just have "crab cake mash" I had trouble getting the concontion to heat throughly.  I still consider myself a beginner, so it was probably my fault, not the recipe.

I somehow messed this up. It was mushy on the inside(not sure if it is supposed to be that way) and fell apart. The sauce was great though.

AWESOME recipe! Have made this many, many times! My friends love to come eat when we make these. I do however add a bit of spice brown mustard & a dash of tabasco. We also broil them instead of fried, not as greasy! I also use Vegetable Ritz crackers adds some extra color! Thanks so much for this recipe they are surely a family favorite!

These were really good and easy to make. We cut the recipe down by a lot (we only had about 1/2 lb of crab meat), but it still turned out great. Like someone else said, forming the cake in a ball first and then flattening it while cooking really helps keep it together. Made a lime aioli with it. YUM!

We had our annual Seafood Fest.  Both sides of the family absolutely loved them.  Of course i had to substitute a few items since i did not have them, but the main ingredients made this dish spectacular.

These were delicious! We used olive oil instead of vegetable oil though. Also, I added a bit of sugar to the sauce because otherwise it was a bit tart for our tastebuds. Overall, they held together nicely and tasted great.

These crab cakes are delicious! I never liked crab cakes much in the past, but this recipe definitely changed that opinion. I only made a serving size of 4 (which makes the ingredients a little harder to work with--i.e. the egg portion), but the recipe is so good that it's easy to add/cut as seen fit. I added more crackers than suggested just to firm it up a bit (I used Townhouse), and cooked a little longer on each side since I didn't have time to chill. I definitely suggest preparing the sauce first so you don't have to worry about it at the end--delicious sauce by the way! Great recipe--thank you!

These were simply amazing! I didn't even use real crab meat either! They didn't have any fresh crab meat at the store, so i used surimi. I had 5 guests for dinner and every one of them was asking where I got the recipe. I'm definitely making this again soon!

Outstanding! I thought the sauce was pretty good but not up to the caliber of the actual crab cakes.

mmmmmm...After viewing Bobby Flay's throwdown with crab cakes I had to make some and tried this recipe.  Used two cans of lump crabmeat and added some extra seasoning and these were incredible.  Very good even with the smaller amount of crab.  A keeper folks!!

First time ever making these, was much, much easier than I expected. Did not have Old Bay seasoning so I had to substitute. Even without, these were really, really good! Did not make the sauce, used sour cream and mayo with dill instead.

My search for a great crab cake recipe continues.The crab cake was just ok and the cilantro/lime sauce was not that good at all. We ended eating it with tartar sauce. I wasnt so disappointed with the taste of the crab cakes, more so then i was the money i spend on buying the fresh, wild caught blue crab meat for just mediocre crab cakes. It cost me $18 just for ONE pound! I scaled it down to four. The crab cakes did not hold together that well either. They were really delicate. I more than doubled the old bay and still could barely taste it. These were just average.

A quote from my husband -- "Ridiculously GOOD!" I had to size the recipe down to 6 servings -- and now we wish we would have doubled it!  It was very good.  I browned ours in a small amount of olive oil. I also did not have the seafood seasoning it called for - so I used Lawry's seasoned salt, a little ground pepper and a dash of garlic salt.  YUMMY!

I have tried this and my friends loved it. The next time I make it, I'could probably experiment with some variety of sauces made from canned Campbell soups for convenience.

This recipe was a hit! Try it with some shallots next time for a little change.
