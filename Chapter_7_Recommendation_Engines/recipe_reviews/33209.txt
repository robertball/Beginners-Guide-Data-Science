The batter didn't have any egg, therefore it falls apart when trying to fry it. I suggest using an egg and throwing in a little bit of onion to improve the taste as well.

Like the other reviewer said it needs an egg so it doesn't fall apart.  I made one batch and added an egg to the second batch and they stayed together.

I scaled the recipe up to eight, and followed all the conversions.  I used ground beef instead of ham.  Also, instead of oil I used PAM cooking spray to coat my skillet.  The pancakes turned out yummy and made a great dinner.  I served some peas and corn to go with these on the side.  Thanks for sharing Milo! A keeper that my young kids will eat. Meat and patatoes in one!

I "mashed" rather than shredded the potatoes for a fluffier texture. I also substituted the ham for "english spinach". A nice variation of the original recipe. Very YUMMY!!!

I like the addition of ham and cheese in potato pancakes.  It goes really well with applesauce on top.  But I think I should have done what one reviewer did and just mashed the potatoes or used a more traditional recipe with flour/egg.  I didn't care for putting them together the way the directions state.  Also, there is way too much oil for frying--my first batch came out soaking in oil.  The second batch came out much better.  Still, it's a great idea and was worth trying.

These were pretty good, tasted better the more we ate. Although they were more time consuming than I would have liked. Next time I may try to cook them in the oven on my large stoneware bar pan.
