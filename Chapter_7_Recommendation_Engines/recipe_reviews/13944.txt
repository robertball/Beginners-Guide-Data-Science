I've adapted this recipe at bit, I don't use instant rice, I use a regular brown and wild rice mix. I cook the rice using vegetable broth, and then add to it the cooked onion and garlic (I use double the garlic). I steam the broccoli, and then add it to the rice, onion and and garlic, mix the cheese through it (I use about 1/2 cup more cheese than what is called for - I like it cheesy) and bake in the oven until the cheese is melted, and then sprinkle the toasted walnuts on top. It's a great recipe, I've shared it with several people who all think it's great.

This gets 5 stars with the changes I made to it.  Before, I found it lacked a little something.  I took the advice of many reviewers and made this as a casserole instead.  I used real brown rice instead of instant and olive oil instead of butter.  I used low-fat cheese, too, and I don't think it affected the taste.  I added extra broccoli because we love it and steamed it in the microwave for about 4 minutes before adding it to the rice, onion, cheese mixture.  The major change I made was adding shelled, toasted pumpkin seeds instead of walnuts.  They seem to add just the right touch of crunch and salt to the recipe.  Then I baked the whole thing at 350 for about 20 minutes.  My kids love this, too.

I love all these ingredients except the walnuts.  I think brown rice is a hidden secret in our pantry and it alone helped me lose almost 30 pounds!!  Any recipe with brown rice I will try.  I really liked it except I had to steam the broccoli with water or it shrivels up w/o it.  I also put mine in a casserole dish and baked it in the 350 degree oven for 25 mins. and it was all gooey and good!!  I also use low-fat cheese cause then its not as greasy.  Thanks for this one!

DELICIOUS!  I just changed it a little bit:  In a 10 inch skillet I sauteed about 1/4 lg. onion diced small on low for about 10 mins. in butter and oilve oil.  Then I added about 4 sm. cloves of garlic chopped small and cooked for about 1 min. more.  Added instant brown rice and fried it for a couple of mins. in the mixture.  Added 1 c. CHICKEN broth, brought it up to a boil, then covered it and turned it to super low and cooked it until all the liquid absorbed (10 mins?).  Tossed in the frozen broccoli I had already steamed and about 1 c. finely shredded "mexican style" cheese (that's what I had in the fridge).  I divided it in two servings (my hubby and I loved it THAT MUCH!) and topped it with the toasted walnuts.  
YUM!  Oh, we also had some baked salmon along with it.  The salmon took a backseat to this wonderful rice dish.  Thanks Candice!

I was making this recipe and thinking to myself that the ingredients were too easy and wondering how it would combine.  I thought it would be pretty boring, but my husband and I really enjoyed the flavours.  This was a great recipe and I wouldn't hesitate to make it again.
Next time, I will use normal brown rice (not instant) and cook some brown lentils in with the rice when boiling with the stock. I love the combination of lentils, onion and brown rice, so I think it will make this recipe a 5 1/2 star one!!

Very good, very quick recipe! We used almonds instead of walnuts and added a drained can of kidney beans to make a complete meal since we do not eat meat. Wonderful! Thanks for the great recipe and please keep keep creating in your kitchen!

I was looking for something that would be comforting, but not too unhealthy and this was perfect.  I used regular brown rice and cooked it with the onions and garlic per the recipe, but used 2 1/2 c. of broth and simmered it covered for 60 minutes.  I also cooked the broccoli in my steamer until it was bright green and tender/crisp.    I really liked the different textures in this dish.  I leave the cheese out since I've stopped eating dairy and it was still tasty and very low in saturated fat.

Everyone loved it (including the picky 10 year-old)!  I used a whole boil-in-the-bag thing of brown rice (minute rice) and used lots of garlic.  A reduced fat cheddar topped it and was well-received (less greasy that regular and just as yummy)

I have made this twice since I found the recipe.  I made it with chicken broth both times.  It's one of those amazing recipes that I know will be made often!

Yum! Nice combination of crunchy and chewy, with good colors too. I doubled the garlic and used regular brown rice (not instant). I also used two packs of frozen chopped broccoli for a total of 20 ounces (1 and 1/4 pound). My one mistake was to increase the cheese to perhaps 2 cups (double what the recipe called for) as I was afraid it would be too bland, but in so doing I am afraid I upped the calories by quite a bit. 1 1/2 cups might be better. (Say, 1 cup mixed in and 1/2 a cup on top if you're putting it in the oven like I did?)

I combined all in a casserole dish, sprinkled lightly with cheese and some of the walnuts (chopped) and baked in a 350F oven. Took it out and left it on the stovetop to cool while I went to the gym and it kept very well for dinner when we got home!

Thanks for sharing this healthy recipe!

What an easy and delicious recipe. I preferred slivered almonds instead of walnuts. And, french green beans(frozen:cut up and cooked with the garlic, etc) rather than the broccoli,   to go with a perch dinner. Thank you, RE's jrbaker for a fabulous suggestion. I will make  this again & again, just changing up what veggie, nuts & cheese, I have on hand. Great recipe, Candice. Thank you, for submitting.

I liked this recipe so much since it don't have to use all those nasty cans of soup that have msg and other chemicals in it - this is a true home recipe.  It could use more seasoning, especially for us people who like a lot of salt, but what does that say about us?

This was really tasty and easy, and came together quickly once everything was chopped, grated, etc. I added cubed pork to make it a complete one-dish meal kinda thing and used chicken broth instead of veggie broth, because that's what I had. I was also too lazy to toast the walnuts but I'm sure that would have made it even better. I mixed everything together before serving and had yummy little pockets of melted cheesy goodness. Thanks for the recipe!

We really liked this.  My kids were a bit scared to try it because it does not look pretty but once they tried it, they loved it.  It makes a good main dish for us vegetarians.  It has a pretty good amount of protein and not too many calories (due to the large amount of broccoli).  So, it made a good rounded dish.  I will be making this again.

I really like this combination of ingredients! I would never thought of it myself. This is in my regular dinner rotation. I steam the broccoli on the stove top, I like it much better than the microwave method. I also use regular brown rice, not instant.

I'm loving this recipe!  I made a few changes based on others' recommendations: I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, regular brown rice, extra broccoli, and mixed it all together and baked it for 15 min.  I ate it as a main course for lunch which was great, but am thinking it would be an awesome side dish with some nice baked fish... mmm....  I will definitely be making this again.

Fantastic! The flavors came together very nicely! I didn't use cheese (I'm trying to eat healthier), and for me the meal didn't need it. I used olive oil instead of butter. This was simple to make, so I will be making this frequently!

i made this when i had a terrible cold and needed something tasty and easy. i followed other reviewers advice and put the rice (i used brown rice) and lentils in a baking dish, added low-sodium chicken stock, covered it and baked at 350 until it was almost done (about 45 minutes). i also added dried red pepper flakes, garlic powder, and black pepper. i added frozen broccoli and cheddar cheese and cooked a few more minutes until the cheese melted. i was surprised at how good it was and this will definately be in my permanent rotation.

My husband and I really liked this.  I didn't use the instant brown rice, but cooked regular brown rice the whole 45 minutes in the onion, garlic and butter. It turned out sooo good. Didn't have walnuts, but didn't miss them.

My husband said it was okay and I liked it, although it wasn't a repeat recipe in this  house.  I followed the recipe with minor changes...I used long grain brown rice and since I  didn't have vegie broth, subbed wth chicken broth.  As I was mixing in the vegies and cheese, the mixture looked much too dry so added more chicken broth and about 1/2-3/4  cup chardonnay.  Also, it was still a bit bland so added about 1 teaspoon Herbs de'provence.  The mixture started looking like a Risotto.  I placed it all in a baking dish, sprinkled it with about 1/4 c. grated cheddar and sprinkled it with toasted walnuts.  Baked at 350 degrees for about 20  minutes uncovered and 10 minutes covered.

We LOVE this dish. Almost any toasted nut is good on top,  pecan, almond, etc.  I would recommend using real cheese, not the 2%, as it just doesn't melt or taste the same. As others have suggested, I add the cooked broccoli to the rice mix, stir in the cheese, and bake it like a casserole.

Yummy! I added extra garlic and extra salt to taste. Also used chicken broth in place of veggie broth. I cooked the broccoli with a chicken bouillon cube in a little water on the stove. I made this once as a casserole and once right out of the pan and the stovetop way is the best. Thanks for the recipe!

AMAZING combo!  I made this with the Grilled Salmon recipe here and reserved the marinade (used about 1/4 cup) to pour over the rice and it turned into a restaurant quality Chinese dish.  I swapped Walnuts for roasted slivered almonds.  Baked at 375 for 20 minutes with 1/4c cheese in the casserole and 1/4c cheese on top.  Delicious and can definitely be a meal all by itself.

this was wonderful... I have made it several times and passed it on to friends... I did not have instant rice so I used the kind you have to cook... I cooked the broccoli on the stove as I prefer it cooked that way. I also used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth. Made if for dinner for a few girlfriends with a chicken dish off this site... definately recommend trying it... it reheats great...
thanks!

My husband and I loved this dish; it adds some zip to plain old brown rice.  I used boil-in-bag brown rice, once cooked I added it to my sautéed onion and garlic and put it in an 8x8 glass baking dish.  Toped it off with steamed broccoli, feta and pecans, and threw it in the oven while my chicken finished baking.  WOW, GREAT!

I give this 5 stars, with a few changes! I doubled the recipe and used 5 small heads of fresh steamed broccoli. I also used garlic-infused olive oil instead of the butter, some sort of low fat cheddar, and left out the walnuts. I cooked 2 cups of uncooked brown rice, and then mixed it with the onion/garlic and broccoli. I then stirred in the salt, pepper, and cheese. I put the whole mixture into a casserole dish and baked it at 350 for about 15 minutes. So delish!!!!.... especially with hot sauce!

I prepared myself for a somewhat bland meal when I was making this, but it was not bland at all.  I did use salt and pepper s stated but that was the only seasoning.  the dish had good flavor in my opinion.  I would make this again.

I really loved this!!!  My husband and kids loved it too!  I made mine more of a casserole by mixing in all the ingredients (added diced cooked chicken too), topping it with extra cheese and toasted walnuts then baking until hot and bubbly.  It was truly delicious and a comfort type of food (yet SO healthy!).  Also, I used regular brown rice instead of instant.  The toasted walnuts really made this dish for me.  Going in my permanent folder!!

I was a little skeptical, but routinely have these ingredients on hand so I gave it a try -- DELICIOUS! It's easy, it's quick and you can jazz it up with whatever you like. I'd made it just like this and with chicken.

This was amazing!  I used regular brown rice, a vidalia onion, extra garlic, lots of broccoli.  I also steamed my broccoli on the stovetop rather than the microwave.  We loved this dish & it will be a staple at our home!

My family and I really liked this, but I did tweak it.  I used olive oil as others suggested and cooked the onion and garlic in it.  Then I added the brown rice and 1 and 1/2cups of chicken broth and cooked that til the rice absorbed it.  Then stirred in half the amount of cheddar and 1/4 c of parmesean cheese.  Threw in the broccoli and added a can of cream of mushroom soup and then poured in in the dish.  I don't care for walnut so added italian seasoned panko bread crumbs on top and the rest of the cheddar cheese and cooked it for 20-30 minutes. MMM MMM it was delish!  My picky son even ate it.  Next time i might add a little Mircle Whip salad dressing to give it a little more zip.

I don't like broccoli that much, but when it's surrounded by cheesy goodness, it's a lot easier to handle. I substituted toasted slivered almonds for the walnuts, which added a nice crunch (and the healthy kind of fat), and baked it at the end like some people recommended for about 15 minutes. I'll totally make it again! thanks!

I upped the rice and left out the walnuts (not a walnut person) and found this to be pretty tasty. I also agree with other posters that the broccoli is best steamed, not done in the microwave.

Very tasty.  My husband commented that it had great flavor, and it gets two thumbs up for being so healthy.  I also baked this for 1 hour and then added the cheese, walnuts, and frozen broccoli and cook for 20 more minutes uncovered.  This will be a permanent addition to my cookbook!

This is so easy to make and quite good. It has a really nice texture and flavor. The only thing I changed is I put it all together into a casserole instead of serving platter and put it in the oven for 15 to 20 minutes. It melts the cheese better and heats it all through.

I only put about 1/4 cup of onion in because my family would not eat it otherwise.  I also used fat free chicken broth instead of vegetable and left out the salt.  My family liked it and they want me to make it again.

*I* thought this was absolutely delicious, but my husband thought it was boring. However, this is my review, not his! ;) Anyway, I used chicken broth instead of vegetable cos that is what I had. I added a dash of chili powder to the broccoli and used lactose-free cheese. Instead of serving the broccoli and cheese over the rice, I just mixed all the ingredients together in the rice skillet (to make sure the cheese was good and melted, as it tastes weird if it's not) and served from there.

We've just started trying to eat less meat, and as avid carnivores, we had pretty low expectations of being able to do that. But this really yummy! I took another reviewer's advice and added about 1/2 cup of lentils to the brown rice while I cooked it, to make it more filling.
 I never even liked broccoli before, and now we eat this nearly every week! Thanks so much!

This dish wasn't very good, The flavours didn't go well together. 
The cheese didn't taste so good on it. It made it taste worse of what it already was.

Amazing! I used regular brown rice and steamed my broccoli on the stovetop. We will definitely be making this often.

After cooking the garlic and onions, I added chopped mushrooms to give it a little more heft. This dish is super easy to make and is always so yummy!

I made this recipe twice. It's really yummy! The only changes I made was to use long cooking rice and threw in a couple handfuls of sliced portabello mushrooms. Love it!!

We liked this! I used regular brown rice that I cooked in chicken stock.  I mixed the onion/garlic, broccoli, and rice together, topped with cheese, and then baked for about 20 minutes at 350.  Added the walnuts on top.  Yummy! I think next time I'll add more cheese and might experiment with adding more veggies.  I served this with the broiled red potatoes that are on this site.  They are my fave! :)

I think this recipe would be MUCH better with regular brown rice instead of instant rice which has a strange, processed texture.  I cooked my broccoli in a steamer instead of attempting to cook it dry in a microwave (without moisture according to the recipe?).

EXCELLENT RECEIPE!  I am trying to find receipe's for my daughter who recently decided to become a vegetarian.  This receipe is great as written and you could easily add some cooked chicken or beef for those in the family who do like meat.    I don't think this was four servings, I would double it next time I make it.

yum! I used regular brown rice and added a dash of steak seasoning (just felt like it) . Super, duper delicious and healthy... if you don't go crazy with the cheese. Thank you for the recipe.

I really liked this! I made it for my husband because he hates rice. Unfortunately, he didn't like this dish... but I just think he'll never like rice :) I really liked it though, so he'll have to suck it up because I'll make this one again.

Really, really good! Everyone in my family enjoyed this, from my husband down to my 10-month-old (sans nuts). I did make a few changes. I added more veggies (cauliflower, broccoli and carots). I didn't have instant rice, so I cooked regular brown rice on the side first, steamed the vegetables seperately, and then added all the ingredients together in the end.

I really enjoyed this, but had to make a few improvisations.  I used pine nuts, (no walnuts), chicken broth, (no vegetable broth), and added a can of tiny salad shrimp.  It was definitely better before I added the tiny shrimp, they are salty little buggers!  I will make this again, maybe trying almonds instead of the walnuts next time.

I loved all of the cooking methods used to create this dish, I used tasted almonds and white instant rice-but next time I have brown in the house I think it would be great.  I used a half a onion which I loved, my husband though did not, so I'll be making two versions of this one with onion, one without.  I also liked the way the broccoli cooked up in the microwave.   The nut crunch was great.

Yummy good, except I used "real" slow cooking brown rice, pan toasted the walnuts and stir fried the broccoli with butter (excluding the salt and pepper entirely). It was delicious and WORTH the extra cooking time

I really liked this recipe even though I changed it a little because of what I had on hand.  I used basmati rice and cooked it in chicken broth.  I pretty much did every thing else the same.  Used fresh broccoli and extra cheese.  I would use extra walnuts next time... it made it really good.

This recipe as I made it would be 4 stars, but since I changed SO much from the original, I'm giving it 3 stars. I steamed the broccoli and used regular brown rice, cooked in veggie broth. I sauteed the onions and garlic in canola oil and substituted pine nuts for walnuts. I used more cheddar and added Parmesan, and I mixed everything together in a large bowl, put in a small casserole dish, sprinkled more cheese on top, and baked it all. It turned out quite well with these changes.

WE LOVE THIS RECIPE!!! I took some ideas from the other reviewers and exchanged the walnuts (i´m not too crazy about them) for pine nuts. All in all, a good, easy recipe to put together!

We followed other reviewers' suggestions and cooked regular rice in a rice cooker, then mixed everything together in a casserole and baked til the cheese was bubbly. We also added a little bit of red pepper flakes and cumin. It was very tasty!

This was great! The only thing I would take out next time is the walnuts. I wasn't a big fan of them with this. I would also probably crush up the broccoli smaller in this, but it was good.

Wow! This was delicious! I boiled the broccoli with garlic salt and pepper and doubled the walnuts, but left it alone otherwise. SO yummy! I might sautee the broccoli with soysauce and sesame seeds next time for more zip, and maybe add a bit of Thai Chili sauce to my own plate. Great recipe!

This is really good and perfect for a quick meal. I have already made this twice this week! You can substitute other veggies for the broccoli too. And no need to precook veggies. Just throw them in the pan the last couple minutes of the rice cooking. They will steam to a perfect el dente.

I loved this, my husband for some odd reason didn't but since he's not writing the review I'm disregarding his opinion ;) I added some sliced mushrooms to the onions and garlic while they were sauteing. After the rice was done I stirred in the steamed broccoli and a mix of cheddar and monteray jack cheese. I didn't have any walnuts, so I just sprinkled the top with sliced almonds (the kind you get in the salad section). I'll definitely make this again (though I'll have to wait until my husband goes to the field)

Decent recipe.....As suggested by others, I cooked the broccoli on the stove, and I used chicken broth instead of vegetable.  I think what I didn't care for about this recipe was the toasted walnuts.  I guess it's just a matter of taste.  I also chopped up a grilled chicken breast and added to mixture in the end.  Next time I make it I will omit the walnuts ( maybe sub slivered almonds?) and add more garlic.  Overall, it wasn't bad but didn't blow my socks off either!

This dish had a different taste. It was good, but I got full after a few bites. I used reg. brown rice. I doubled the recipe, so I cooked 2 cups of rice in 4 cups of vegetable broth. Next time, I will steam the broccoli. The cheese was delicious when it melted on the hot rice. But I think I will gain weight from eating this. Oh well, who cares? Try this recipe!

This was wonderful. I made a few changes based upon what I had in the cupboard. I used regular brown rice instead of instant, added more garlic, used 1/2 cup of mexican cheese and a few shots of Tabasco. Yum!! Tasty and filling. I served this with a piece of baked fish. Thanks for the recipe. I'll be making this again

Just made this for dinner, and love it! For my sister's sake I switched out the chopped onions for onion powder (she hates the texture of onions), and it tastes great.

I make it in 1 electric fry pan. I place the broccoli over the rice as it simmers... that steams the broccoli to perfection! Thanks for this recipe as it is one of our favorites from this site!

Good base recipe. I added cooked chicken to make it a little more substantial, and baked the whole thing for 15 minutes at the end. Next time I will add some bell pepper for a bit more flavor.

I am a novice cook always looking for easy and tasty recipes. This one turned out well for me. I read some of the reviews and adapted it by using regular brown rice instead of minute rice and steaming the broccoli. I also added a splash of wine and some chili powder as I like my food a little spicy. It has turned out well and I plan to add it to my dinner menu rotation.

This is good.  Added mixed vegtables because that is all I had.  I burnt the fist batch of walnuts so I had to roast some more, doing to many things at one time.  We ate it as a meal but I think I will make it as a side next time.

Following the advice of others, I treated this dish as a casserole.  I used a wild/brown rice blend, which I cooked with veggie broth.  Cooked the onion and garlic, steamed the broccoli and mixed it all together with 1 1/2 cups of sharp Vermont cheddar.  I baked it at 350 for about a half hour.  Simple, but tasty.

Delicious. Took other commenter's advice and cooked the brown rice in the vegetable stock, which worked out really well. I might even just cook the garlic and onions in with it instead of sauteing them in fat next time, too.

VERY GOOD!  I put the rice in a rice cooker with half homemeade vegetable stock (from this site) and half water.  Added garlic and onion powder and about a tsp of spread.  While that was cooking I  steamed the broccoli and chopped it small, toasted the walnuts and shredded the cheese.  I actually added the cheese to the rice cooker when there was still a liquid left so that it melted throughout the rice, then tossed the broccoli in as well.  I put into bowls and topped with extra cheese and walnuts.  My two year old had his without the nuts and LOVED it - always a plus!

Great taste! Just a few simple adjustments though... I steamed the broccoli in the microwave instead of just cooking it. I thought cooking it without water would probably make it shrivel. I also used one entire can of veggie broth to make sure the rice was moist and it came out perfect. I baked the dish at the end for about 15 minutes as well with the cheese already added. Yum!

I didn't add walnuts. Instead, I added shrimp and squid because they were just there to be used. I also added lots and lots of cheese. I love any dish that is healthy and delicious, and this dish is sure is! :)

This is a delicious combination. The only veg I had in the house was canned green beans so I used those instead of broccoli and it was great for a quick, healthy, vegetarian meal.

YUM! This was great! I made it for a non-vegetarian friend and she loved it! Said she would have never thought of rice and cheese together. I used parmesan instead of cheddar and peacans instead of walnuts. I did find it a bit on the dry side however, I think I would add a quarter cup of chicken stock after removing from heat.
Thank you!

This was a really great idea, pairing the brown rice (used regular) and walnuts with the broccoli.  I used frozen broccoli and next time I will double it.  I dissoled a beef bouillion cube in a cup of water as I didn't have vegetable broth.  I omitted the cheese because that just didn't seem to match up with the dish to me.  Next time I think I'll add diced apples to cook it with and a complementary spice, maybe marjoram.  I mixed in the broccoli and it still made an attractive presentation.  Thanks for a different and nice "company" recipe.

This was so yummy.  I used Smart Balance instead of butter, skim cheese & used low-sodium veggie broth, though.  My husband added his own sea salt, but I kept mine w/ no salt.  We will be making this often.  It made such a pretty presentation, too!  I think it will be a great way for my non-vegetarian guests to eat a wonderful vegetarian meal & be satisfied!

This was amazing. I desided to steam as suggested and added a little more cheese and garlic then suggested, I also love cheese. Will definately make agian! The walnuts really make it unique.

I don't care for onions and am trying to go vegan so I left out the onions and cheese.  It was still very good.  My husband and son even had seconds.  I will probably double the recipe next time so there will be plenty of extra.

I messed up the broccoli and the rice and forgot about the nuts, so I don't know if the recipe itself is perfect.  I was distracted by kids and husband, but I'm not willing to dock it a star for my not being able to manage it under pressure!  Maybe next time I'll get it right.  But I was able to get it together enough to know that it's worth doing again.  I like these ingredients together.  Healthy and satisfying and great as leftovers, too.

Great recipe. I made some changes suggested by previous users: Used a lot more cheese, mixed it throughout the dish then put in cassarole dish and baked it for about 10 minutes.

YUM!  I just made this for my 2 year old and myself and we loved it!  The only changes we had were regular brown rice and monterray jack cheese.  I also think I used about a cup of walnuts because we love them.  Now I just have to convince my husband to try it...

this was yummy. I substituted wild rice for the brown because it was handy and it was a beautiful contrast of colors and textures,dried cranberrys would be a great addition,thanks!

This was really great! I added lentils as suggested by others. I also used green onions instead of regular and feta instead of cheddar. I increased the recipe to 6 servings instead of four and it was a very filling meal for me and my husband.
