Way to go whodunitdr! Even though I tweaked a teeny by using fresh ginger and garlic and fillets instead of steaks, I am giving this recipe a resounding 5 stars! This dish is CLEAN and perfect. Very refreshing to try a seafood marinade that isn't afraid to let you taste the seafood. Buy good fish and use this recipe. Thanks!

It was very good. I'll make this again, with these small changes, from the recipe & from what I did: add a little more cayenne & perhaps ginger (both of which I couldn't taste); add 1-2 teasp. brown sugar for a sweetening & caramelizing effect; marinate 2 hrs.; sprinkle med. coarse sea salt on the skin (of fillet) just before grilling; and cook on a MED. grill as recipe indicates.  What happened this time was I marinated for 4 hrs. and cooked it on a med.-low heat, when recipe asked for marinating 1 hour  & grilling on MED. heat; these 2 factors led to a slightly too-dry salmon! So, I need to make this again.

Very good marinade, although I will marinade it longer next time and use more lime juice too. Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious! It gave the meat a slightly spicy, tangy and sweet coating! I added just a pinch of red pepper flakes, and in the future I would also add a pinch of salt - but this is personal preference. Started cooking skin side down (oven under broiler, got rained out), flipped and poured remaining marinade over, and finished cooking. Now the confession - I didn't use salmon. I used chicken thighs! It would be phenomenal on salmon. If you really want a lime kick, squeeze some freeze juice on top of your plate. Mmmmm. Thanks!

A bit too much spice- next time I'll half the cayenne pepper and maybe add a bit more lime- but besides that this one is definitely a winner

This has become my go-to salmon recipe.  I don't always marinate for the full hour, and instead wrap the salmon in aluminum foil and grill with a little extra marinade in the packet.  Makes for less clean-up, no need to worry about flaking apart on the grill.  Delicious and simple!

This was a very disappointing marinade. Lime does not accentuate the flavor of salmon. We won't be making this again.

This is a great summertime marinade. It wasn't overbearing and the salmon was still able to make an appearance.  I marinaded for a couple hours before baking and the final product was oh so juicy.  Thanks for sharing such a delightful recipe, I will continue to use this in my kitchen.

Very light and refreshing - much better than the last salmon recipe we tried.  Based on reviews, I used 3 limes which equalled 1/3rd cup and for the rest, I followed exactly.  I marinated 2 larger pieces of salmon for about 3 hrs and then grilled.  Needs a bit of finishing salt (I used celtic sea salt which was a bith earthy and goes well with lime).  Next time I will increase everything a bit except the oil.  Served with a lemon based bean salad and a fresh roll.

Tasty. I added about a tbsp of brown sugar to this to help with the tangy-ness and a tsp of soy sauce for a bit of salt. Very good recipe, thanks:)

I used the same marinade but sauteed it on the stove. Next time I hope to be able to marinate it for more than 10 minutes!

This recipe was ok, probably not making it again.  The salmon didn't have much flavor, even after marinating 3 hours.  I used salmon fillets, otherwise didn't change anything.  My recommendation would be to save some of the marinade, boil it and serve over the salmon.

Overall, a good mix of flavors. To infuse with more lime, add the zest. To balance the overwhelming tartness, I added honey and soy sauce. And for heaven's sake, don't throw away the marinade! Reduce it in a pan and drizzle over the grilled fish for extra flavor.

This was excellent!  I didn't measure the marinade ingredients, but I'm pretty good at eyeballing things, so I'm sure I got the proportions at least close to correct.  I used salmon filets instead of steaks, because that's what I had on hand.  I baked these instead of grilling because I was too tired after work to stand over the BBQ.  It took about 20 minutes at 400 degrees F to cook four 7-ounce filets.  The lime flavor came through exceptionally well, even after only about 45 minutes marinating time, so I'm not sure why other reviewers had trouble with there not being enough lime flavor.  The only thing I needed to add was a little salt to each portion.  Thanks, whodunitrdr, for a great, simple salmon recipe!

The flavor that this marinade imparts to the salmon is very subtle, not that that's a bad thing. I followed the recipe to the letter, with the exception of using fillets. Next time I would choose fresh ginger and garlic, but otherwise wouldn't change a thing. Thanks for sharing the recipe!

I didn't have cayenne pepper... but I don't know how much that would have changed things. It seemed tasteless after an hour of marinating.

This was tasty. I added extra lime juice (about 1/3 cup total) because people recommended it...and it seemed to be too much. I marinated for 1.5 hours and then broiled the fish.

This recipe is fantastic. Fresh and light, not too spicy, just perfect. I did use fresh garlic and ginger in place of ground, and I marinated Halibut filets, not Salmon. This was just right for my expensive fish - complimented the flavor of the Halibut beautifully without overpowering or drowning it in a heavy sauce. Marinate no more than 2 hours. Thanks for an amazing recipe! :)

We added 1 T extra of fresh lime juice and a sprinkle of garlic powder. We served it with a rice pilaf and green beans. Very enjoyable.

My husband and I really enjoyed this marinade.  I used Boars Head deli style mustard as I did not have any Dijon.  I also cooked it on the bbq using a cedar plank.  It turned out great!  I served it with grilled zucchini spears.  Great combination!!

Left out the ginger because we didn't have any, but glad we did--it would've been an odd flavor with the rest of the ingredients. Loved the bit of spice! Doubled the juice, oil, and mustard called for based on previous reviews.

This was an easy-to-prepare salmon recipe. I made two modifications; I added 1 1/2 tsp of honey to the marinade, which helped the flavour and also with browning as I baked tithe salmon in the oven (with the spring we've been having, will we ever see barbecuing again ?).

I used a bit more lime juice and marinated this for more than 2 hours after reading reviews that said the flavor isn't very strong. Overall, it was very good but we still wanted a bit more lime flavor. This is a great recipe if you love the natural flavor of salmon.

Quite tasty.  I gave it no time to marinate and it still was very flavourful on fresh salmon steaks.  If I marinated it I can not imagine how much better it would have been.

It was good, but really didn't impart much flavor or spice to the salmon steaks. I wonder if it was the quality of the salmon? Anyways, it is a good marinade, next time I will choose fresh salmon and not previously frozen.

The marinade itself was very good.  It gave a great flavor to the salmon.  It also does very well when used with other fish.  Perhaps next time I will try it on chicken.  The thicker the slice of fish you have, the longer you need to marinate for.  An hour works perfectly for a thin piece but we had a thicker slice and it needed more time.  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Great recipe! I've never had grilled salmon before, and thought this was a good recipe to start with. The marinade was really easy to put together, and the finished salmon was very tasty! The lime flavor came through well, but it didn't overpower the taste of the fish. I didn't marinade it for the whole hour, because I ran out of time...but it still turned out great. Thanks for sharing the recipe...it is very good!!!

This was a very tasty way to do a "low fat" salmon recipe - no butter! The salmon had wonderful flavors, none seemed overpowering - but you could taste them all. Used fresh ginger and garlic. Thanks!

Very nice.  I made this the other night using a salmon fillet.  The only change I made was I used a fresh garlic clove that was minced.  I poured it over the fillet and let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then popped into a 425 convection oven and baked it covered in a casserole dish. Served with basmati rice, oven roasted carrots and mixed veggies.  A very nice, quick easy meal.  I think the sauce would make a nice dressing for a salad too.

Made this to serve to guests and was told it was the best salmon they'd ever tasted. I used a special aluminum sheet (for grilling) on the grill and it did stick a bit, but next time will spray it with PAM first.  Many thanks whodunitrdr!

This is really fantastic.  I omited the ginger as I didn't have that on hand.  I broiled in the oven and it was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!  I will be using this many times to come.

I'm so glad I found this recipe!  My husband, who doesn't really like fish, said he would eat it more often if I cooked it like this all the time.  I made it several times already and sometimes I use lemons if I'm out of limes.  I also broil the fish in the oven instead of on the grill outside.

I mde it in the oven 25 min at 350. And turned out just fine.  I turn it into a sweet and sour. By adding a tbl spoon apricotjam. Also I did not throw away the marinade, I baked it in the marinade.  What will improve it to achieve taste I was trying for would be to reduce the lime  (it was just a tiny bit too pronounced) by 25% and I will increase the jam to 2 tbl spoons. Garnished with green onions

We absolutely love this recipe. It's perfect for hot days when you want something delicious and gourmet-tasting, but don't want to have to heat up the kitchen. Make the marinade the night before to save time.

Very enjoyable.  Bf didn't even notice the mustard and he told me it was very good.  Score!  (he thinks he hates mustard so it's always exciting when I can secretly get him to eat it.  Very evil, that's me.)  This is very light and refreshing.  I used my indoor grill to grill the salmon and they were very thick pieces, so it took me a lot longer than the recipe states, but I think of recipe times as guidelines anyway.  ;o)  I served with carrots and saffron rice.  An all around success!  Thanks for the recipe, whodunitrdr!

I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could. Had it the other evening and it was fantastic! I couldn't stop nibbling as we cleared the table. I didn't make it myself, but the friend who did used chili powder instead of cayenne and used fresh ginger and garlic.   As my mom used to say, "We ate the flowers off the plate!"

It was a spring-storm day that I tried this recipe so I wasnt able to use my BBQ as planned. Instead I chopped my salmon into cubed and grilled them on a flat top. I also was out of Dijon so I used a hot mustard in half the amount called for. It turned out great and had just a touch of heat that my family loved. I served  the salmon wedges over a greens salad with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds. YUM YUM

We love this recipe!!! So simple...the marinade does not overpower the salmon. I usually use a little extra cheyenne pepper. Before we grill it we wrap it in foil. Keeps it moist and after grilling it comes right off the skin. Definitely a keeper!

Used this marinade with swordfish and salmon steaks simultaneously. I tweaked it with a little sea salt, a couple shakes of ground turmeric and a few dashes if soy sauce. It came out very nice- not overpowering at all! I actually liked it better on the salmon! Easy and very satisfying!

I substituted the black pepper for red pepper flakes and spicy mustard with mayo for Dijon since I didn't have any. I also used thinner filets rather than the thicker steaks.  I marinated for several hours and this is my new favorite salmon! I thoroughly enjoyed every bite! Thank you for the recipe, I will make this many times.

Fantastic recipe. The only thing we changed was using fresh  ginger and adding 1 1/2 tsp. Would definitely make this again

Made with fresh Coho, marinated for 21/2 hours.  I use a grill pan instead of BBQ. Just enough background flavor not to overpower the Coho.

Made it with swordfish and double the mustard!  It was great with lemon quinoa.
