WOW! this is great stuff.  I fixed the "dense" problem; combine the yeast with the water and allow it to begin fermentation before adding it to the blender.  This stuff is so great I have decided to sell my bread machine. Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe.

Excellent bread!  And SOOO easy.  Although
this is not the bread for you if you 
crave a light, fluffy, texture, it is
excellent with a hearty, savory soup or 
stew.  It also makes fantastic toast!

Nice and easy.  Only the second loaf I've made, and it tastes great!  I used a mixer and bowl instead of processor, and it worked just fine.  Enjoyed it with olive oil dip.

Wow ~ I've never made bread before, this recipe was SO EASY!  I personally like hearty breads, so this one really appealed to me.  This is not your Wonder type of loaf!  This bread is perfect for eating with my homemade soups.  I'm going to try it with pasta & sauce too!

It is a bit heavier than regular white bread but the recipe does say RICH. A wonderful hearty bread excellent for sandwiches. I made 1 loaf and 8 hot dog buns, lovely taste with the hot dogs!! I let my dough rise twice before shaping and then one more time in the pan. (personal preference). My bread recipe from now on.:)

Instead of a loaf, I made 14 rolls in a 9" round pan.  They were the best. I brushed the tops with butter before baking 20 minutes. My family loved them.

It is an O.K. bread to make if you are in a hurry and have no other alternative
I found it was quite dense and heavy.

This is the best white bread I have ever had. My husband & kids all agree. We couldn't stop eating it. It is so great w/ a little butter & strawberry jam. We didn't think it was too heavy at all. We like the fact that when you spread peanut butter on it it didn't tear the bread like the lighter breads. I encourage everbody to try this bread.

If you are from the New England area and LOVE Bertucci Rolls, this bread is like a loaf of Bertucci Rolls! It's thick and dense and fantastic. The kind of bread you can get full from (like the rolls before dinner even gets there). I think for the people who made it and it didn't turn out, that they used regular yeast and not the FAST RISING yeast. That is clearly key in getting this done in record time. This is going in my go-to recipes for bread. It would also make fantastic french toast and the kind of bread that would sop up the yolk of a fried egg on any glorious morning. ENJOY!

I have made this bread many times and always enjoy it.  I like to call it EZPZ because it's so easy and fast.

I enjoy the consistency and the crust of this one-loaf recipe.  The bread has a nice texture, is moist and is great with jam, toasted with butter, or served with a stew.

Since it is a slow rising loaf, I let the dough rise at least one hour or until the rise is about 1/2" from the top of the pan and I bake it in a greased 9" stoneware loaf pan at 375* for 30 minutes.

When it comes out of the oven, I brush the top with butter while it's still hot.

I have never been disappointed with this recipe.

I just can't get this to turn out. I'm sure it's a great recipe, I'm just not good at bread making. I don't know if I'm doing something wrong or if my yeast has gone bad. I'm not giving up though! :-)

Unimpressive.  Dense and quite doughy.  Maybe I will ferment the yeast and try again.  The flavor really wasn't worth it.

This is a super easy bread to make.  When you have lots of little ones running around and very little time to watch the clock or knead; this is a great recipe!  Thanks for the recipe!

I let my yeast proof in the warm water before adding it to the processor. Super EASY!!! I made homemade hot pockets and this dough was perfect for them. today, I am using it for dinner rolls.

This is a great bread recipe.  Delicious.  Lately I’ve been making it with 1 extra tablespoon of sugar and I increase the butter by a tablespoon also.  More flavorful this way and still a fantastic texture - great slicing bread for sandwiches, etc.

I made this bread using the ingredients exactly as written. It seemed like 1/4 tsp salt was insufficient, but I gave the author the benefit of the doubt. The loaf came out looking beautiful, but it was not what I would describe as “rich,” and my instincts were correct...there was not nearly enough salt. I make bread fairly often, and the typical recipe will call for 1 tsp of salt. This loaf tasted decidedly bland. Otherwise, I liked the texture, and it made pretty good toasting bread with some salted butter and some jam. I will make the bread again because it was easy and attractive, but use 1 tsp of salt.

I was looking for a quick recipe to make while my beef stew was cooking. I found this recipe on the allrecipes.com website. I didn't make it in a typical loaf style. Instead I let it rise on a cookie sheet, as it would have if it were in the bowl, then baked it on the  cookie sheet . very good, especially still warm with real butter.

I do not find this recipe dense at all.  It has become my favorite bread recipe. I do not make it in a food processor.  I use my large kitchen aide mixer, and I let it do its work.  I do have it knead the bread for quite awhile, so maybe that helps. It was crumbly at first, but I switched to a bread flour rather than all purpose flour. I also increased the kneading time.

This bread was wonderful, the family loved it!  I fermented my yeast first and did not add the salt directly into the yeast mixture (It kills the yeast btw).  I don’t own a food processor so I just mixed it in a bowl, and kneaded for consistency.  I am giving the recipe 5 stars but the directions are 2 stars at best as they have you kill the yeast in the first step, which I assume is why many individuals have dense loaves.

This bread was very easy to make! I actually baked mine in a crockpot and replaced the egg with vegetable oil (since I had run out of eggs). It was my first time making bread and a great starting point! Turned out well and had a good flavor.

I too mixed the yeast with water for a few minutes till it bubbled up.   The trick in food processors and yeast baking  is to NOT over knead so  I used the pulse setting.

It  is perfect for french bread and freezes well. 

My new go to bread recipe AND no added chemicals :)

Came out very good.  I did place the yeast into warm water for about 10 minutes before combining ingredients.  I also made this by hand since I do not have a food processor.  I also added 3 tbsp of powdered malted milk which added a very nice flavor. I also baked it for 27 minutes to get a lighted crust. I will add more sugar next time I make this but other than that it turned out good.  I think with more sugar it would be a 5 star recipe.
