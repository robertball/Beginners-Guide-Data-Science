This soup is simple but truly AMAZING! I substituted green lentils as it is what I had on hand and also halved the recipe. Smelled delicious from the instant I put the spices on the onions and didnâ€™t disappoint.

This was super yummy. I followed the recipe very closely. I couldn't find coriander at the store and misread the recipe and only bought one container of veggie broth so added filled up the container with water, figuring I'd add boullion if it needed more. It was super great without. My family gobbled it up and asked why we can't eat this everyday. :) I also trimmed the dried stalk ends and cut up the stalk and put them in the soup with the broth and they got nice and tender like celery. It was a nice touch. This meal is well balanced and anyone needing an iron kick and is sick of steak, this is the recipe for you! Thanks for sharing. Will make again!

YUMMM-OOOO! Followed spice list and directions although I used green lentils, substituted with chicken broth and bullion and added diced potatoes and shredded carrots instead of chard and then blended 2/3 of the soup. Fantastic flavor! Thank you.

The seasonings are perfect as written. Like others, I did add the swiss chard stems and I had some mushrooms I needed to use so I added them. The soup was, to my surprise, very delicious! The seasonings and veggies gave off almost an earthy flavor. You do not miss there not being any meat in this whatsoever. Will make this again and again.

I've made this recipe probably 6 or 7 times now, and it was a staple for me during college. It's delicious! It it definitely a soup that tastes better the next day. It is good as is, I just taste it and occasionally add a little more spice after it's been simmering for a while at the end. The only thing I always change is I chop up the chard stalks and put them in-- it's basically like adding celery. You can also add carrots if you want to make it a little bit heartier! It does make a LOT of soup though, make sure your pot is big!

This recipe is excellent as written. I have varied it with red lentils and green lentils for a bit of a different texture. I always cook the stems (chopped) in with the onion as one reviewer suggested and in addition, I like to add sliced carrots for a little bit of color. I often increase the curry powder as we like things spicy.

This is the recipe I've been looking for!  I love the taste of lentil soup in cans, but am trying to get away from the unhealthy sodium level and preservatives.  This was easy & delicious! I used 2 bundles of red chard - that was the only chard available at my WalMart, I have no idea which lentil color was in the Great Value 1 pound bags - used 2 of them - it all came together very nicely.  I like my lentils soft, so I cooked them for 2 hours.  I added a dollop of cream cheese to top it off - super yummy.

This soup is delicious, nutritious, and easy to make.  I am always on the lookout for recipes using Swiss Chard since I have a lot in the garden. This was great! I will make it again!

Wow!  That was really flavorful.  Thank you for sharing that.  I didn't have any swiss chard, so I used dino kale and it came out great.  I also topped with home made croutons.

I should have used my cast iron dutch oven, though, because for some reason whenever I cook in stainless steel (like in my stockpot just now) I can never simmer it at the right temperature and I end up burning the lentils
