The recipe was very good but I changed a lot of it.  It kind of seemed outrageous to have 8 cups of powdered sugar so my first plan was just to cut the recipe in half.  I used 1/2 cup butter, only 2 cups of powdered sugar, 2 teaspoons of vanilla, and enough milk to make it the right texture.  But after doing this everyone in my house loved it.

Very tasty but I used only 1 stick of butter (1/2 cup) and only 3 3/4 cups confectioners sugar (about half what the recipe calls for) also, since it came out tasting incredibly sweet I added just the tiniest drop of white vinegar.  It came out perfect! What a delicious frosting.  I am not sure how much the original recipe yields but my "reduced" recipe made enough frosting to cover 2 9" round layer cakes with tons of frosting.

I liked this recipe because I had all the ingredients on hand.  I think the the trick is to beat it well, I cut the recipe in half and frosted a 2-layer cake and had about 1 cup of frosting left over.  I will make again, it had a great consistency!

This is also yummy with almond extract!  My mother used to be a cake decorator and this is just like hers!  For a flawless finish, use shortening instead of butter, and use a metal spatula with a smooth edge.  Let your frosting dry.  Dip spatula in VERY hot water and smooth frosting, wiping spatula frequently.  It will end up almost as smooth as fondant and be a beautiful canvas for your handiwork!

I made half the recipe, which generously frosted twelve cupcakes. I found I needed only 3-1/2 rather than four cups of powdered sugar, but the full amount would have been fine too. Don't be rigid on the amount of milk to use either - simply add it gradually until you get the consistency you want which will depend on whether you're spreading it or piping it. Since I piped this frosting onto cupcakes, I made a stiffer frosting which obviously required less. This is a standard, reliable recipe for basic vanilla buttercream.  It's very hard to go wrong on this one!

Excellent basic buttercream recipe.  You need to have the butter at room temp or cool (butter indents when you press)...not warm and runny...the butter needs to have some body to it.  I add the sugar a 1/2 cup at a time, tasting all the way.  Then some half and half (instead of milk), then more sugar..until it is light, fluffy, tasty and perfect.  I have no idea how much sugar I add,  but if you add the sugar, THEN the milk, both a little at a time, it will be wonderful.  Today I made a chocolate , a vanilla and a cream cheese frosting with this basic recipe.  I probably use less sugar so it comes out fluffier and less sweet.  Again...the key is the butter...it mustn't be warm..in fact if it's cool it's really perfect, will hold lots of air and become - with each addition and whipping - light and lovely.

a good basic recipe. I found that the best tactic with the sugar was to just add it to the butter and milk 1-2 cups at a time until you get it just right. 8 cups did seem like a wee bit too much for me, I only added about 3 1/2 cups.

Wonderful! Not too rich at all, nice consistency. Dries very smooth, not at all dry & crusty. I was out of Pure Vanilla, so I used 1/2 tsp Immitation Vanilla, instead. Came out great!

I found this is a good recipe. But I added a little more vanilla and decreased the powdered sugar by a cup and added 1/2 cup bakers sugar. I think it came out great and more fluffy. Thanks for the recipe!

There are a lot of "buttercream frosting" recipes here, but this is thee only one I give a good rating to because it's a true buttercream vs. buttercreme as it's made with butter & not shortening.  My trick to combat the sweetness is to add a little salt to it & when making the chocolate frosting, I cheat with a 1/4 cup (as per this recipe, but equal % for smaller batches) of margarine.  This is a tried & true recipe that is next to impossible to foul up & there are so many options to use for flavoring.  If you are like me & prefer REAL foods vs. the fake sorts made with shortenings & artificial flavors, you will be very happy with this recipe & to the "vanilla lovers" using this recipe, be sure to go all out & use a high quality bourbon vanilla for a taste to remember.  I've also fiddled with adding regular sugar to this & for a special recipe for someone I made cupcakes for who wanted a glossy pink frosting, I added just a dollop of corn syrup (yarrrgh!) & it did the trick.  I send a big THANK YOU to the cook, Diana Wilson, for sharing this & applaud her for not using "fake" ingredients.  Of all the recipes available for "buttercream" this is the only one I recognize as being true.  If you notice your frosting is too thick, slowly add in milk, 1/2&1/2, or cream; too loose, just add more confectioners' sugar.  Three thumbs up & a great big YUMMY for this recipe.

DELICIOUS! But very important: mix the vanilla into the butter BEFORE you add the sugar. If you put it in at the same time as the sugar it will form little brown clumps that are hard to work out! I cut the recipe in half and had a little more than enough for a 2-layer cake. It was a huge hit!!

Needed enough frosting for 12 cupcakes, so I made half of the recipe. I was also looking for a raspberry buttercream so I replaced the milk with approx. 1/2 cup of fresh raspberries. I mixed the butter and raspberries, added the vanilla and then added 1 cup of confectioners' sugar at a time and beat well after each addition until I was happy with the consistency. Worked out great! I will use this recipe often. Thanks for sharing!

I have been making this for years and everybody loves my cakes because of it!  The recipe that I have perfected is 1 cup (2 sticks)  slightly softened margarine, 8 to 9 cups confectioners or powdered sugar, 2 to 3 tsp vanilla and milk a few tbsp at a time to desired consistency.  This makes quite a bit (I frost a double layer 13x9 cake and have some left over).  Left overs can be stored in an air tight container in the fridge.  If 9 cups seems like too much sugar, it's not, trust me! The key is to keep tasting to make sure you get the balance of margarine and powdered sugar right! I also frost the top of the bottom layer, chill it to firm the frosting, then put on top layer and frost all of it.  Keep putting in the fridge to keep it firm.

I cut the recipe in half and made the lemony version to frost a lemon poppyseed cake.  I didn't use all the confectioners sugar called for and I added 1/8 tsp. of salt.  I don't know if by substituting the lemon juice for the milk it made it runny, but it was more like a glaze than a frosting.  I was a bit disappointed and I probably won't make this again.

Recipe perfect as is.  Great taste and perfect texture for cake decorating.  Yes, you need the full 8 cups of sugar, especially if you are going to use the frosting to decorate.  Also, without the sugar, the flavor is too buttery.

Altho I cut back on the sugar it was still a very good buttercream frosting coupled with the fact that this recipe is one of the few that did not call for shortening. The thought of eating shortening, sweetened or not, sends me over the edge.  I added a bit of red food coloring and made pretty little individual heart shaped pink frosted cakes. The love of my life adored this recipe Diana and we both thank you!

I did exactly what the receipe said and it turned out to be a real hit on my daughter's birthday cupcakes.  The confec sugar reduces down so much it was the right consistency.  I used a Pampered Chef decorating tool which actually tends to use up a lot of icing so I used almost all of it for 48 cupcakes.  Delicious!

This is a SUPER easy recipe. I agree about decreasing the amount of powdered sugar. I used only 1 stick of butter, 2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 3/4 tsp of vanilla. The milk portion came out to just over a quarter cup. I whipped it with a fork even and it turned out perfect!!! The kids frosted rice cereal bars with it.

so easy and delicious...i'll never buy grocery store frosting again!  i've made it in vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.  for the strawberry version, i just added a couple tablespoons of strawberry puree (just put a handful of strawberries in a blender!), and it made it the most beautiful pink color without artificial coloring. i usually do 1 cup butter (2 sticks) and only 5 cups confectioners' sugar and then add milk a little at a time to achieve spreadable consistency.  this makes for a more-buttery, less-sweet frosting, but you can easily adjust the ingredients to suit your taste.

This is the PERFECT decorator's frosting.  It's got the best consistency, and doesn't use shortening, so it tastes great!

I did the orange version of this recipe. It was fantastic! I couldn't leave my boyfriend alone with the bowl, every time I left it he had a handful in his mouth. The orange flavour was perfect. The only issue I had was the quantity. It made probably double or triple the amount that it said it would. So make sure you halve it. Other than that its phenomenal and I will definitely be coming back to this recipe anytime I make cupcakes.

This was a good recipe and tasted great to me. I sifted the sugar before beating it into the butter and it did not taste grainy to me. 
My only complaint was I made this for my son's August birthday and it melts fast so keep the cake or cupcakes refrigerated until serving or it will melt pretty quickly on you in any heat.

This is my favorite frosting recipe, i use it for everything.  However, because of dairy allergies at our house, i substitute extra virgin coconut oil for the butter.  This is absolutly amazing made as a chocolate frosting, tastes just like a candy bar!

Pretty good.  Followed the recipe exactly, but halved everything since I only had a dozen cupcakes to frost.  I wanted a champagne flavored frosting, so I did add a couple of tablespoons of the champagne until I could get the right flavor.  If you do this you need to remove the same amount of milk otherwise it becomes to runny.  Or add more Powdered Sugar.

Excellent!  I made this recipe to put on top of cupcakes. I halved the recipe. I had a dozen regular-sized cupcakes and a dozen mini cupcakes and had quite a bit left over.  I made the chocolate version using cocoa.  Delish!!!

I cut this recipe down to 3 servings because I wanted to try it before commiting to alot of ingredients, this reciepe is AWESOME! I made some orange cookies and the frosting that it suggested was way to thin, this buttercream (w/orange) knocked the cookies out of the park. I may never buy store bought again :-)

Yum.  Perfect for my Christmas sugar cookies and my brother's birthday cake.  I don't make a single substitute or change this recipe in any way.  My husband, who almost always scrapes the frosting off anything, loves this frosting.

Very good though I did not use the full 8 cups of sugar, yikes. I used 1 cup of butter, 6 cups of sugar and somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 a cup of milk. Pipes wonderfully on cakes.

This frosting turned out way too runny, it just kept dripping off the cake (very inconvenient when you are doing layers, it was so runny that the cake tipped to the side).  The taste wasn't all that either.

This turned out okay. I didn't find that it tasted of much other than sugar and had to spread it on really thin to keep it from overpowering the cake with pure sweetness. Since I spread it on so thin, I had twice as much as I needed to frost a two-layer 8 inch cake. It definitely needs salt if you use unsalted butter. I give it three stars because it was simple and made a decent frosting, but I won't make it again.

This may be a good base, but all we could taste was sugar. I made half the recipe and ended up adding lots of extra vanilla and about a cup of strawberry jam to give it some kind of flavor. I have had much better luck with other recipes!!

This recipe can definitely be cut down a bit since it made WAY too much with the 8 cups of sugar. The only thing I changed when making the original recipe was adding another 1/4 cup milk to get a more spreadable consistency. This frosting comes out a bit yellow thanks to the butter but unless you're specifically looking for a white color that shouldn't be a problem. It also converts very well to a chocolate frosting with just a little more milk and cocoa powder. Definitely, by far, the best tasting buttercream recipe I've come across!

Perfect! Love that there's no shortening. 1/2 recipe made plenty to generously frost an entire recipe of cupcakes, with leftovers. Used a bit more than 1/4 c milk, though.

This is the best recipe in the world for frosting! If you like chunks of toffee and a caramel flavor, you melt about 1/4 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons of butter then add the hot liquid quickly and grind it up with your mixer on high. if you put on vanilla cupcakes it is DELISH!

I have to admit, I changed this recipe too... I used 3 cups of confectioners sugar instead-- and a few tbs of heavy whipping cream instead of milk.  Also since it was St. Patricks day I did one batch with creme de menthe instead of vanilla.  All it all it is a quick and easy recipe.

I started off making half and by the time my boys kept tasting it I should have made the full recipe. So i started all over and did just that!!! This is an awsome recipe. Only thing I did different was substitute irish cream coffee creamer for the milk. It was delicious!!! Will definatly use this one over and over.

A good basic frosting.  I like to change up the flavorings depending on my cake, but always reliably good.

I simply added 6 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips, melted, cooled then added to the butter cream.  Delicious!

I took the advice of some of the other reviewers and halved the recipe and it worked great for a double layer cake. I will make it again but I think I'll add either more vanilla or some almond extract.

I also loved this recipe because I had ingredients on hand. I don't like lard or shortening. For chocolate, I followed directions but added a few drops of peppermint extract and added a tablespoon or so of cold coffee before adding milk for consistency. MMM!!!

I paired this frosting with some cupcakes I made for a birthday party today. It's one of the best buttercream frostings I've made, and definitely something I'll use again. This recipe makes a ton of frosting, way more than I needed for two dozen cupcakes, and the vanilla flavor was a little bit strong. A few minor tweaks, but otherwise, I think it's great.

Fast and easy recipe that we liked. Added grinded walnuts to frosting and made it slightly runny and put over hot bananna cake. Also poked cake with holes for the frosting to seep thru. Excellent! Thanks for the recipe

I halfed the recipe, used real butter and vanilla, it just didn't taste good, way too sweet.  The consistency is too runny even when I added more sugar.  I hope it will taste better on my cake.

This is the best frosting I've ever had.  My boyfriend tries to eat it on it's own.  I don't make the whole recipe.  I cut it in half and add the confections' sugar 1 cup at a time to taste.  I also add about 2-3 tbs of cocoa powder for chocolate frosting.

I gave it 4 b/c it was so easy. Not the absolute best I've ever had - I did as another reviewer suggested: 2c powdered sugar, but I found I needed 3/4 c butter. And a splash of milk, only 1/2 tsp vanilla.

I've made this 3 times now .. and to me it just doesn't taste right.  Something is seriously missing taste wise for texture and consistency it deserves 3 stars.    It would probably be ok adding flavors but, as a buttercream frosting this is very disappointing to me.

I used 1/2 butter and 1/2 crisco and beat on med for 15 mins with my kitchen aid so the butter and crisco were well combined. One of the best frosting recipes I have made.  This is a keeper!

Easy recipe that uses on-hand ingredients. I like that it's made with butter instead of shortening too. One less star because I didn't use anywhere near the 8 cups of sugar. I whipped the butter until fluffy then gradually added the vanilla and only 2 cups of powdered sugar. I added one tablespoon of milk and then whipped the daylights out of it which made is fluffier. This made enough to pipe generous amounts onto 2 dozen cupcakes.

Great recipe, but it's too much confections sugar, you couldn't really get the buttery flavor to come through.  Next time I'll taste as I go.

I've never made homemade frosting before, so that may have affected the outcome of this recipe.  I studied many reviews and heeded advice, but my frosting still came out too loose and too, too sweet.  Someone mentioned adding more sugar to stiffen up the frosting... that won't do -- I did and of course it made it sweeter.  Is there any else I could try next time to make the frosting a lot less sweeter but stiffer?  (I don't like the idea of shortening in my frosting...)

Perfect consistency.  I thought it tasted a little too strong of vanilla, but I'm pretty sensitive to the taste of vanilla.  Thanks for the recipe!

Wonderful recipe. I added a little more confectioners sugar to stiffen it up a bit, and a little more vanilla extract, and it turned out just perfectly.

I thought the milk was a bit useless to even have on the recipe. After beating the sugar and butter, it was already the thickness of frosting but I added a dash of milk. Also I would have used half a cup less sugar. A little too sweet.

This frosting is super simple and tastes great.  I halved the recipe and had ample frosting to frost a double layer 9" round cake with some left over.  I whipped the frosting for quite a few minutes with the whisk attachments on my hand mixer, and the more I whipped it the more frosting I got, so perhaps that is why some people seem to get more frosting than others.  Tastes great.  Perfect consistency.  Make sure your butter is room temperature before you start.

This frosting was really good, I had read in some previous reviews that they halved the recipe and still had plenty to frost a two layer cake. I did not find this to be the case. I halved it and had enough frosting to frost 2/3 of a 9" double layer cake. It was yummy and we all liked it.

I like this recipe and it was very very easy to make, i used barely any milk and only about 3 cups of sugar.  I made chocolate frosting and I'm not a huge fan of using baking cocoa...I think next time I will use melted unsweetened chocolate squares.  The vanilla, however, is amazing and so easy to spread! :)

This is it! Just like my Mom used to make. Delicious! 
I made 1/2 the recipe and used only 3 cups of the sugar and it was sweet enough. It was enough to frost a 2 layer cake. Will pass this recipe on to others. Thank you!

Easy! Generously covers a large 2-layer 9" cake. Next time I will use salted butter instead of instead. Salt cuts the cloying sweetness & perks up flavor. :)

I loved this recipe. I reduced sugar to  3 3/4 cups and used less that 1/2 cup of milk to get the consistency I wanted. I  frosted a dozen cupcakes with plenty left over. I put left over in the refrigerator and will use later in week for new batch of cupcakes.

I like the thick texture of the frosting by cutting the sugar down by 1/2 cup and cutting the milk down a couple Tbsps. It was enough to frost a few dozen cookies.

This will be my new "go to" recipe for buttercream frosting.  I am more comfortable using butter than the shortening many recipes call for.  I used about 1/4 cup of milk and the consistency was perfect for me.

I could not use this frosting for decorating. While I was working it became too watery and I had to keep refridgerating it in order to continue. Better off going back to using store bought frosting!

This is a great recipe!  I made a chocolate hazelnut frosting with peanut butter cupcakes and it was to die for!!  Instead of milk I used a 1/2 cup of hazelnut creamer and I used 3 1/2 cups of powdered sugar and 1/2 cup of coco powder!  I only used a stick of butter!!!  Great!!!

Love this! This is the best frosting ever. If you are going to use it for piping it is not stiff enough, you will need to add more confectionery sugar. But the taste is so good!

I tried this recipe as is and found that the taste was much too sweet and the consistency was a bit "gritty."  There were no visible lumps but definitely an odd grit upon tasting it and that was after mixing it for 10 minutes. Also, it merely tasted like powdered sugar.  There was no buttery flavor at all.  I was disappointed but feel I may have made a mistake in my execution since so many other reviewers found this frosting to be wonderful.  I will try again but will add less powdered sugar.

My cupcake crew and I made this recipe and did not care for it!! It's to gritty!! We cut the recipe in half and it's not good. We beat it for 30 min. and it's still gritty. We had complants from our customers. We want to rate it at 0 but it's not possible.

Good basic butter cream. Very thick, can be thinned by adding more milk. I personally added coconut extract it came out well.

This is pretty much the recipe on the back of the Kroger brand confectioner's sugar bag doubled except their recipe calls for the same amount of shortening as butter. I guess this would be a lower-fat recipe. My kids love it.

i was sick of using store bought icing because i couldnt pronounce some of the things in them.. I found this recipe and it's now the only one i use.. Although i did change it quite a bit. i use 1/2 cup of butter and about 3 1/2 cups of icing sugar, and only use milk if i want to change the consistancy of it depending on what im using it for... and it turns out perfectly everytime.. i even use it as a "glue" for when im using fondant on some of the cakes i make.. My neice also likes to pick out different flavors and colors to use for different occasions.. (theres currently a spring green one with blue, pink, yellow and orange flowers sitting in my fridge. lol )

So simple and SO good! This frosting was delicious on my daughters' cupcake cones. I halved the recipe and it was the perfect amount for 24 cupcakes.

This was a very sweet frosting and I was making it for someone who didn't care for all the sweetness. So, I added about 3 cups extra unsalted butter to cut it down. Based on taste, they loved it and raved claiming they wanted seconds. The frosting stayed nice and thick, even with the extra butter, and I added alittle milk to loosen it up some. 
Perfect.

I really liked this recipe.  However when I saw the picture I was expecting a chocolate buttercream recipe so I just changed it up a bit.  Also, unless you're frosting more than one cake or a few dozen cupcakes you only need 1/2 the recipe.  I made a custom recipe so I wouldn't forget the changes I made to the recipe which I loved.  I cut the recipe in half and then added 3 T butter flavored crisco, 1/2 unsweetened cocoa, a pinch of salt and I thought it needed just one more tablespoon of milk for a total of 1/4c + 1T.  After beating the ingredients on high for a few minutes to make it nice and fluffy, the frosting was perfect.  One more note - I made a box chocolate cake and substituted 1/3 c amaretto liquor for part of the water and it was delicious!

I love this frosting!!!  I only made 1/2 a batch, which frosted 12 cupcakes perfectly.  It is just perfect for piping and held its shape for hours (until it was eaten).  I will keep this one close by.

It's back to basics with this reliable buttercream.  I halved the recipe and was able to generously decorate 12 cupcakes.  Mid-way thru piping, I did have to pop the decorator's bag into the fridge as the butter started to soften too much from the heat of my hands, so keep this in mind while working in a warm kitchen in the middle of an August heatwave...

This recipe is WONDERFUL! The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I think I could have used a little less sugar. I love things sweet but when serving a cake to everyone else I think less can sometimes be more. I had RAVE reviews on this icing and I will definitely make it again. Great for piping too!

Makes a HUGE amount, more than enough to frost a 2-layer 8 inch round cake. I used cream instead of milk and it turned out great. Just a tad too sweet for me, would add a little salt next time.

This recipe is excellent, it's very sweet, so I added 1/2 tsp of salt, whipped it really well and add half the powdered sugar and vanilla, add half of the milk and the rest of the sugar until the consistency is just right, it does make a lot!  This frosting is better than any other frosting I have tried and taste as good, if not better than most bakeries.  I just love this recipe!!!

I half this recipe for a 2-layer or 9 x 13-inch cake.  For chocolate, I melt the butter and add 3 heaping T. cocoa.  I also add the milk a little at a time, alternating it and sugar, and mixing with mixer.  Sometimes I use all of the milk and sometimes I don't.  It depends on the consistency I want.

Eh, was too sweet and very grainy.  Is there a trick to making it nice and smooth?  It tasted like nothing more than SUGAR.  I guess I'm still looking for the perfect recipe but if you like sweet then perhaps this one is for you.

I'd give it 4.5 stars, only because there is no mention that the milk amount could be way too much. I used half the milk it calls for. This recipe is excellent, it's sweet, but the flavor is great, use a nice quality salted butter, whip it really well and add half the powdered sugar and vanilla, taste and adjust, add the milk and the rest of the sugar until the consistency is just right, it does make a lot!

True buttercream frosting. You can change the flavoring and amounts of milk and sugar to suit your needs. A pinch of salt will intensify the flavors. We like a less sweet frsoting, so I normally use about 4 cups of sugar and a couple of tablespoons of milk added a bit at a time to the mixer. The butter works best for me if I let it come to room temperature before I put it in the mixing bowl and cream it. I've tried softening butter in the microwave with varying not so great results.

A tad sweet - excellent for 1-2-3 cakes or two egg cakes that aren't overly sweet themselves. Makes quickly and fluffs up to a beautiful consistency.

I cut this recipe down and I had enough to cover a 9 inch cake, top and sides!  -2 cups icing sugar -1/2 cup (one stick) of butter  -1 teaspoon vanilla -2-4 teaspoons of light cream  Use less cream for a thicker icing and it wont be dripping down the sides.

I tried the chocolate version and used about 1 3/4 cup of cocoa (I split the recipe in 1/2) because I ran out of cocoa. But even with not using the whole amount of cocoa it recommended, it still had a very rich chocolately flavor - almost gourmet chocolate - like a gourmet chocolate cake at a restaurant. Very yummy.

This is the only buttercream frosting recipe I use- I add different flavors of gelatin (raspberry, lemon etc) to make it fruity/color it!  Fun!

Family loves it! Perefect for carrot cake. Full recipe does 2 layer 8in square + 1 9 in sq.with some left over. Be careful with milk. Add it last to adjust consistancy. Also did it with no milk but used sweetened condensed milk about 3 tsbl and 1/3 c water to the right consistancy.

Very delicious!  I cut the recipe in half and frosted 2 9" round cakes.  Just the right amount of frosting.  I used cream instead of milk cause I had it on hand.  A little extra fat never hurt anything!  I also added a dash of salt to balance the sweetness a little.  Great basic frosting!

OK not sure if I should be even rating this b/c I changed it up a bit, but it was SOOOO good that I had to share. Ha! I halved the recipe and that covered a 9 inch 2-layer cake. Also, I added Bailey's for the liquid... OMG so good. And I'm not normally a frosting person- but WOW. This seems to be a very nice basic recipe though, came out very fluffy and smooth!

I just made this recipe and it tastes great. I cut the recipe in half and it tastes so much better than the recipe on the confectionars sugar bag. Pairing it with my cream cheese frosting/filling is excellent.

I made this to frost sugar cookies, and it frosted over 100, so plan accordingly.  Also, it sets up okay, so I was able to stack the cookies after frosting them.  The key is cream the butter until you don't think you can cream it anymore!

I really liked this recipe. My consistency wasn't stiff enough to decorate with, but I ran out of powdered sugar. I can see how this recipe would be too sweet for some people, but I really liked it. It was way better than any can of store bought frosting. 

If your icing is runny it means there was too much milk. You can stiffen it up with more confectioners sugar.

This recipe was very good- I also made slight alterations and halved it but would definitely use it again as a base. I didnt have milk so I used coffee creamer and ended up with silky shiny frosting.

I made this recipe as it is written, and it is quick and easy to make.  I chose this one mostly because it did not call for shortening.  I do agree with a few other posters, I would cut down on the Sugar next time.  It is delicious though!  Will def. make again!

The recipe turned out well.  It was easy to decorate the cake with.  I felt it was too sweet and tried the suggestion to add 1/2 tsp of salt.  I don't think I will ever do that again.  It think maybe the salt would need to be mixed in the milk.  I beat it very well and still could taste salt granules in the frosting, and I had only added 1/4 tsp to start with.  I had to add more powdered sugar and a little bit of milk to save the batch.  After that it was good.

Tastes great, looks great! Just careful not to beat it too long or it will incorporate air bubbles and won't frost smoothly. A very nice alternative to vanilla or white frosting. I used imitation vanilla, not clear, and the color seems fine.

Wonderful!  Super fast and easy, and even my picky husband loved it.  I always add a bit more vanilla than called for, but other than that I followed the directions and it turned out fluffy and melt-in-your-mouth yummy.  Used it on a coconut cake because we have a non-chocolate eater in the family, and it complimented the cake perfectly. Thanks for a great recipe!

I wouldn't change a thing. One recipe will generously frost 24 cupcakes (maybe a little to spare for mistakes!). It's a good consistency for pastry bag application. I've also used almond extract in place of the vanilla, which is delicious - I imagine other extract flavors would work, too.

I like this frosting, but even when I cut it in half it  made a TON. I also cut down a little on the confectioners' sugar, and it still turned out great. I also put in a little more vanilla extract, because a little vanilla never hurt anybody. When I refrigerated my frosted cupcakes, the frosting hardened a little and still tasted really good. Next time I'm going to use some food coloring too. (Also, it turns out as a really pretty creamy color!)

To frost 24 cupcakes I cut the recipe in half and still had half of that left over....so if you are making the standard amout of cupcakes I'd scale the recipe down to a fourth instead of half as I did. Add the milk slowly as this will completely change the consistency so you get it the way you want it. A great basic recipe!

Recipe was over sweet and tasted very much like the confectioners' sugar ... I found it rather unpleasant after a bit of tweaking I got it to the point that I could stand using it sparingly on cupcakes.

I cut this recipe in half and added about 1/2 cup of whipped cream cheese. It came out really creamy and everyone loved it!

nice simple buttercream - and works well with the orange & choc variations. a half batch will do a full batch of 24 cupcakes with generous piping.

This frosting is almost perfect.  I only used 6 cups of sugar and added about a teaspoon of salt.  It came out ideal and was more than enough to frost a 2 layer 9 inch cake

We had to change it quite a bit in terms of how much sugar and milk we used. We just added a little of each at a time until we got the thickness and amount we wanted. And we added chocolate. SO good.

Didn't have luck with this recipe. It was WAY too sweet, and not nearly fluffy enough. I'll stick with the other one I found on here.

This is very very yummy.  I added the cocoa and it is just like Costco's frosting! YUM.  Next time I'll try it just as white frosting.  But its great!  I left out 1 cup of the powdered sugar.

Fantastic! I had all of the ingredients on hand, which made everything so much easier. Plus, I also almost always have the ingredients for the substitutes for example - the peanut butter frosting. I may try some different types of frosting next time! Terrific recipe =]

The buttercream of my childhood! And if you want it fluffy just put the mixer on high for 10-15 minutes and it will be fluffy and lighter in color. Enjoy!

I had to leave my husband in charge the other night to finish making the frosting needed for my first graders' valentine party...I pulled this one up on the computer, and left the rest to him and his but, but, I don't know anything about making frosting!! When I tasted it the next day at the party, I was thrilled!  So were the other moms!  I told them my husband made it and they were even more amazed...this is a simple, but classic recipe that WORKS!  My hat is off to you, Diana!  This one is the best we've tried so far!!

Good flavor, good texture.  Made this recipe to spread over some shortbread cookies.  Made it a bit thinner to help with the particular shape of cookie I was frosting.  Would definitely make again.

The frosting turned out really well but was very sweet.  The taste put me in mind of homemade vanilla ice cream.  It was too sweet for the cake recipe that I used but would be good on a more plain cake.

I added oreos to this recipe to enhance a birthday cake I was making for my niece.  I believe that a longer whipping process made this icing lighter than normal. It turned out fabulous...thanks for sharing.

I hate to write a negative review, but when i made by the recipe it came out runny and way to much sugar. i've never made buttercream frosting before and probably won't be making it again. If there was something else i was suppose to do then it should have been in the recipe.

This was excellent frosting!  I did take the advice of others and didn't put quit as much powdered sugar in and I did add a few drops of vinager. It was a really good tasting frosting. Not so powder sugar tasting as a few others I tried.

I made 1/4 the amount of the recipe and it was plenty for my batch of Sugar Cookie Cutouts, from this site. I did have to add a little more sugar to reach the consistency I wanted. I like the simplicity of this recipe. Thanks for sharing, Diana!

It was ok.  Very running it seemed and way too sugary..  and I usually love buttercream frosting, but this just didn't do it.  I'm not sure but I experienced alot of the same problems as the others.  I'll keep looking...

Its really just TOO sugary, if you are not one for that thick sugar taste add about a half of a teaspoon of salt to offset it a little bit and give it less of a "oh my gosh i cant finish the cake the frosting is too thick for me" taste

Wonderful flavor.  I used only one stick of butter and one teaspoon of vanilla.  I also used one teaspoon of almond extract.

This tasted pretty good, but it was not like the buttercream frosting from the bakery. It seems more like filling than frosting.

No need to make any changes to this recipe. It is perfect as is. I used whole milk. Lovely, creamy and buttery texture. Thanks for a great recipe I'll use again.
