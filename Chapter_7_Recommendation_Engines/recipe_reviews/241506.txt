This rub was excellent on our pork side ribs. I omitted the cayenne as my family doesn't enjoy heat as much as I do. Instead of applying yellow mustard to the ribs as the creator suggested we used maple syrup. OUTSTANDING!  Will be serving this to guests for sure!

Great seasoning rub, will revise after Birthdays this month. Made 3 batches for Brisket, Baby Back and will try on Beef Back Ribs ....... my Beef Back are usually just Salt Pepper Paprika and melted unsalted butter. Just a pinky test I know this rub is going to compliment my Smokin Cookin"!

worked out fantastic on a 10lb boston butt roast! Can be used for a bbq roast, a simple cuban roast, or even for pork tacos!
