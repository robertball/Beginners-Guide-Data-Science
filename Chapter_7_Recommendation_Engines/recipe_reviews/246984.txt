This is tart, tangy, and delicious! And the color is so pretty. The syrup is really easy to make, too. If you can brew tea, you can make hibiscus syrup! Look for dried edible hibiscus leaves (flor de jamaica or flowers of Jamaica or hibiscus tea) online, in a Mexican/Caribbean market, or the Latin/Caribbean section of well-stocked grocery stores.

I wanted to use up my ginger beer but was tired of Moscow mules. I'm so glad I found this recipe! It's not too sweet and not too tart. It's perfect!

This was my first ever taste of hibiscus, and it was such a fun and surprising addition to the drink. A little sweet, a little sour, and very pretty to look at!
