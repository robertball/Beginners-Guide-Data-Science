This was very good. I grilled it for about 20 minutes over medium-low heat and had tender-crisp corn as a result. The flavor was good, and the sweetness or the corn came through. Next time I may add a little more spice.

Great recipe for grilled corn - we grilled our corn the way we normally do which is in the husks. After they were done, we spread the butter mixture on top until melted - YUM!

Quite honestly, I liked it better spreading it on the corn after it was grilled.  I tried it both ways.  When I grilled the corn with the butter mixture on it, it seemed to make the corn a little "soggy".  Next time I will try it with the fresh onion & garlic.  Thanks Deann.

We have made this corn probably a dozen times since we discovered this recipe. We haven't changed a thing and follow the recipe almost exactly. Guests always rave and are impressed by the flavor. Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

Loved it! I used the ingredients but just eye-balled the amounts. I also boiled the corn instead and added the butter topping while it was still warm. Thanks for posting this great recipe...I'm going to put it into rotation now!

This was something different.  A good spice mixture.  I think I prefer my corn on the cob just with butter tho.

None of us really cared for this. I think the cooking time is way too long; at least for our taste. The kernels weren't crispy at all, actually rather soggy.

This was good, however, the recipe calls for too high a grilling heat (for our grill, anyway).  Our corn wound up burnt in places--obviously would have been much better had it not burned.  Next time I will grill it on medium heat as opposed to medium high.

Not bad at all.  The corn turned out just a little soggy, but I think it was otherwise good. Make sure to rotate often, it burns easily!

Excellent recipe!  Here's a tip for some of you who thought it took too long and was too soggy.  Pop the corn cob in the microwave for 5 - 6 minutes to partially cook them.  Let them cool, then follow recipe as stated. After cooking time, take off the foil and place directly on the grill, use a basting brush to brush any remaining butter mixture on it as the corn browns a bit.  Yummy yummy.  Thank you for posting this recipe

I really liked the spices but I went pretty heavy on them.  Coming from a state where our major crop is corn, I can tell you that grilling them for 20 to 30 minutes is way too long.  It makes the corn tough and starchy tasting.  It should be tender and sweet.  I grilled mine for 5 minutes on each side and that was plenty.  People tend to overcook corn and that takes away not only the nutrients but the wonderful sweet flavor.

I made this last night for a group of 6 adults & 3 kids.  We all loved it!  I did make extra of the butter mixture and those who wanted even more spice added it to their corn when it came off the grill.  Tip: soak your corn in water for 1 hour before dressing & grilling for even juicier corn.

i made this for a large BBQ and so many people raved at how good it was. its definietly a nice twist to youe everyday Corn on the Cob. the only change i made was using miced garlic (the kind you find in jars in the produce isle) it really gives it a nice taste and it also adds to the tenderness with the olive oil its in.

This is a very nice change from regular corn.  The changes I made was to boil the corn for about 5 minutes.  I then brushed with olive oil then spices.  I just roasted on bbq as is for a couple of minutes and served!

Terrific.  I used my propoane grill and kept the corn over medium heat for about 25 minutes, rotating quarter turns about every 5 minutes or so.  I also closed the lid of the grill, pitting the corn on the high rack, keeping the lid clsoed about 3 minutes maybe 4 or 5 times through the 25 minutes span.  Just for good measure, I kept the corn on the high rack with the lid open as I grilled the steaks we were also having that night.

Great easy way to cook corn! I couldn't get fresh corn but the supermarket stuff turned out well with this. Make sure you don't mess with the foil too much, just let it cook and trust the grillin; Gods to do their thing. I served it with grilled margarita shrimp and people were using the leftover chili butter to dip shrimp. It complimented well.

A really nice change to corn on the cob. Followed it to a T but used frozen corn on the cob. And still totally worked out very well. The chili powder is what I tasted the most. While it was a delight to the normal buttered corn on the cob, it will be in my rotation as a grilling side. I will remember to make a double batch of the butter for the next time, to top on the corn after it's grilled. Gotta love butter ;-)

This was really good. The only thing that I omitted is the cayenne pepper because of the grandkids. However, my husband was NUTS about this. He said it was by far the best corn on the cob that he has ever had. He would have given it a 10! :D

Delicious! I used a good sized pinch of cayenne, but should have doubled it. This had mostly a chili powder taste. Next time though I will add more cayenne and squeeze on some fresh grilled lime juice too. (Grill lime halves then squeeze the juice on chicken fajitas too!)

used everything but the  cayenne because I was feeding small children.  The corn was absolutely delicious.  I used frozen corn on the cob, and evryone thought it was just delicious.

This turned out great for us with no changes. This works well universally as a side to most any grilled meat.

Pretty good for a switch.  The recipe doesn't say how much compound to put on each ear so I had quite a bit left--just served it on the side for extra.

There is a lot of corn grown in our area and I am always looking for new ways to prepare it - this is a good recipe - made as is except only grilled for about 12-15 minutes so it wouldn't be soggy or overdone - corn on the cob should be a bit "crisp" when you take a bite anyway.  My husband (who really doesn't care for corn on the cob) ate 2 ears and mentioned to a neighbor how much he liked it.  Guess I will be making it again!

Yummy!  I ended up melting the butter on the stove (I'm a procrastinator and didn't get the butter out to soften early enough) and stirring in all the spices then brushing on the corn with a basting brush.  Really penetrates the corn that way.  Love it!

I soaked the corn for a couple of hours and then grilled one ear of medium size corn on the grill on medium-high for 30 minutes, turning every 5 minutes, while also grilling a large rib eye steak.  I did use the fat free butter (89 Cal) and wrapped the corn in the aluminum foil with the shiny side facing the corn.  This recipe has a very nice BBQ & spicy flavor.  The corn was done ‘just right’.

It was fantastic! I didn't have oregano so I ended up using a Cajun Spice Blend that basically had all the other ingredients. I increased the butter by a fair bit. Grilled at 325 raising it to 400 by the end (I was cooking chicken along side so had to compensate) for about 30 minutes. The corn was the perfect texture and the flavor was unlike any I'd had before.  The guests all commented on the corn in that off hand way that is the ultimate compliment. Saying to one another barely in hearing range, "this corn is delicious!" As opposed to telling the chef. That's when you know it's legit! Love that!

This is quite tasty and quite easy.  I baked mine at 350 for about 22 minutes and it did not get soggy. If anything, it could have used more butter!  A really nice combination of flavors.

Absolutely killer corn.  Thanks for the tips, had this on July 4th with NY strip steaks and everyone was blown away by the corn.  The steaks weren't too shabby either.

I thought it was very good...I didn't use quite as much spice as the recipe called for because of what some of the othe reviews said. But it would have been fine. And 20 min. was the perfect cooking time, it had crunch, but was soft enough to eat.

Very Good....made this a few times this summer with different variations....I found it much better if you wrap some of the husks in with the foil gives it a slightly sweeter taste and keeps corn from burning on the BBQ

This is the tastiest corn I have ever eaten.  I made the butter/spice mixture the night before to save some time.  I boiled the corn and brushed the mixture on.  People were raving about it all night.

Wonderful way to prepare corn on the cob.  I made it as written, but next time will go a little heavier on the spices.  Went light for the first time to see if we liked it....we loved it.  It was nice grilling the meat and vegetable at the same time.  I liked that this corn is husked before preparing.  Thanks Deann for a delicious recipe.

This is so great! I lightly rubbed a little butter on each ear before wrapping in foil. I noticed on the ones I put a more butter on were slightly charred more- which we love. We brushed the butter sauce over the roasted corn. I think the next time I make it, I will use less than 1/2 c. butter. I think we enjoyed more of the spice and didn't need quite that amount of butter. Awesome recipe you must try!

This was really good! I didn't have any problem with it being soggy, it is very crunchy! I didnt have onion/chili/garlic powder I just used garlic/salt.  I used olive oil instead of butter (that might help the soggy problem people are having).

These were delicious!  I used 1/2 teaspoon each of the onion powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  The corn grilled about 15 minutes.  This is a simple & fast way to make a fresh veggie!

I tried this after having grilled corn at a mexican restaurant in NYC.  My husband absolutely loved it!  His only suggestion was to add parmesean cheese to the mixture... I'll try that next time!

My boyfriend brought home a ton of corn on the cob about a week ago, and I've been trying to use it up.  I've tried a couple different recipes from this site now, and this was my least favorite.  It was okay, but I'm not sure I'd make it again.  I liked the BBQ aspect of it (because I was serving it with BBQ), but I wasn't crazy about the flavor.  I might try it again, though, with tweaking because I still like the idea of BBQ flavored corn.

I liked the mixture of spices, but I went a tiny bit too heavy on the oregano.  So be careful you don't do that, as it is overpowering.  I also soaked the cobs for an hour in water, after removing the silks and leaving the husks on, then tied the end of the husks with some soaked string, grilled them over medium heat for 20 minutes, turning them once.  I added the spices and butter seperately after cooking.  They turned out great!...sweet with a crunch and not soggy.

I liked this recipe very much, but was quite surprised that the flavor is not as bold as I would expect, considering the ingredients.  I even added paprika and fresh minced garlic and onions.  I also increased the amount of cayenne pepper.  Maybe next time I will let the corn sit in the butter before putting it on the grill to "marinade" it a bit.

I thought this was delicious. I actually just boiled the corn as usual, then wrapped it in foil with the butter/spice mixture all over it and let it sit for 10 minutes. So good!!

thanks deann for a fast and non messy way to serve bbq corn...i have tried bbqing corn in the husks and it is good - but the husks and string have been a nuisance at the table.. this is great! tasty-tender and everyone has their own cob in foil! i loved it ---next time i think i'll add more cayenne.

Very good.  Could use a bit more butter and I definitely kicked up the seasoning.  Grilled on the upper rack for 25min to perfection.

This was pretty good.  I had never tasted spicy corn before.  I have been grilling corn for many years, but with just butter and salt.  After buttering, wrap the husks back around the corn before you wrap in the foil.  This prevents the corn from burning.

I had a get together this weekend with quite a few people so this method of cooking worked really well for us. I did not taste much seasoning. I tasted mostly butter but they were still good. I will try again with more seasoning.

Pretty good.  Could use more of the spices in this.  The ears that were cooked less tasted better.  Some of the lightly charred ears tended to dry out.

Excellent recipe. I love how well the corn comes off the cob. It's very juicy. I made it for a friend who never eats corn on the cob and she had two pieces.

I have made this twice.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the next time I grilled the corn, cut it off the cob and sauteed the corn briefly in a skillet with the rest of the recipe ingredients adding some green onion and we like it better sauteed because we seem to capture more of the spices.  Very nice change of pace!

We didn't make it really spicy but used a bit of oregano, onion powder etc and it was a nice change but I think we still prefer plain old butter and salt.

Sorry, we weren't impressed with this at all.  Though the corn was tender it was very bland.  We will stick to our regular method, directly on the grill brushing it with Italian dressing or other savoury salad dressing.

Tasty and easy with a bit of kick. Might try rubbing garlic on the corn before the butter. I liked cooking them on the BBQ rather than boiling them.

This was a good recipe but not great. I didn't really care for the flavor of the seasonings with the sweetness of the corn. I think I will stick with simple salt, pepper, and butter from now on.

I am not a big fan of corn on the cob.  When I made this, I swapped the oregano for Tony Chachere's seasoning.  I loved it!
I at more than anyone else!

My boys and I really enjoyed this for our Memorial Day picnic. I made corn tonight and was asked why I didn't make it this way again... I guess this was a hit if they are remembering it after a few weeks!

I made one cob with this mixture and one cob with just plain butter for my friend, and neither one of us could tell the difference between them.

This recipe has potential, but when cooked as directed the finished product was a little disappointing. The butter of course melts as the corn cooks, and as it drips off the corn onto the foil it seems to take most of the seasoning with it. So while the corn was moist and cooked-through, it lacked the flavor punch I was expecting when I mixed up so much seasoning. I may try this again but applying the butter spread after I cook the corn.

Absolutely delicious!! I use these spices when I make frozen corn now too. This is a fabulous recipe for corn that we use every time we barbecue.

Awesome! My kids and husband loved it!  I dont like tough corn and this made it just perfect! I served it with ribeye steaks, and smashed potatoes and everyone had seconds. I used fresh garlic and Italian seasoning instead of oregano and it was awesome!  Will definitely make it again!!!

Nice and easy. Instead of salt+pepper try Lowery's seasoning salt.

The flavor didn't really hold too much, but it was pretty good.

Seasonings were just too weird, didn't care for the cooking method or end result. We will stick to soaking the ears in water, roasting shucks and all on the grill and using plain ole butter, salt and pepper. Thanks anyway.

This is a great recipe!!! I didn't have any garlic powder on hand, so I used minced garlic (from a jar) and it was AWESOME!!!! Unfortunately, right before we went out to grill, it rained... So I put the corn in a casserole dish and baked them in the oven for about 25 minutes. I wouldn't change a thing that I did- Even my hubby loved it, and he isn't a big fan of corn on the cob.

I LOVED this! It was so good. I will definately make this again. The color of the corn before the grill wasn't so great, but when it came out the corn was a lovely yellow. Strange, but true!
