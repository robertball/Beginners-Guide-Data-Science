I have not tried this recipe yet.  I just want to add a thought to the ingredient list. Instead of using 1 can of pineapple tidbits for the marinade I would use a small can of pineapple juice instead, and not wast the tidbits from the marinade.

I didn't follow the recipe entirely.  When I saw "Maui Chicken" I looked over the ingredients, and thought that perhaps shrimp, and scallops would be a better fit than chicken.  So I left out the chicken, and added 1/2lb scallops and a total of 16 medium shrimp.  Everything else I followed.  I thought the sauce was to thin, so I added some cornstarch to thicken it up - I served this over rice.  I think adding the shrimp and scallops made it more "Island fare" than chicken would have.  It is a great starter recipe.

Made the recipe as written (*gasp!*). Very good =) The mushrooms were a bit underwhelming, I think. In the future, I will try out the addition of other vegetables. Quick, easy, filling, reheats well.... it's a darn good recipe.

I thought this recipe was great. I modified a few ingredients based on what I had on hand. I used ground ginger instead or fresh and served it over rice. The only complaint I have is that it was much hotter than I was expecting. The spiciness was okay for me, but was too spicy for my dinner guests. Next time I will use less red pepper flakes.

This was really good but I did make a few changes:
increased ginger to 3T, used 2T sriracha instead of the
red pepper flakes (we like it hot) and replaced the
mushrooms with fresh broccoli. I also added a little corn
starch to thicken the sauce. I will try this again
with a sprinkle of brown sugar next time!  (It only took
45 mins to make - not 1.25 hours)
