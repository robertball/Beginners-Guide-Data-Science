Sooo good and sooo easy. Be sure not to overbake- centers should still be wobbly.

Wow! These are wonderful. I ended up adding too much sugar to the graham cracker crumbs, and added more melted butter. ( I agree with other reviewers- I think it needs more)

I made 12 regular and 12 chocolate (melted semi-sweet chocolate chips) and had enough crumbs and batter to make a small cheesecake in a pie tin. 

I found that they needed to be baked for about 25 minutes and I left most of them in the oven to cool overnight. (A tip from another cheescake recipe) I sampled one of the regular ones after putting it in the freezer to cool. This recipe is a keeper.

I have made these cheesecakes for years!  I make regular cheesecake (not chocolate) and I also purchase 1 can of cherry pie filling.  I spoon the cherries and some filling onto the mini cheesecakes.  They are always a hit!

This is a terrific recipe. I used a specialty mini cake pan. They turned out gorgeous...a bakery would be envious! I would recommend using an extra tablespoon of melted butter for the graham crackers.  Otherwise, a perfect recipe and instructions.

They are lovely, even  my boyfriend and his mate loved them. I made half of them chocolate and they were very tasty also but possibly a bit less cheesecaky. And you can decorate them with chocolate curls made with potato peeler, just make sure the chocolate is slightly warm

A big hit everytime I've made them for a party!  Also very good when you top them with strawberries or raspberries and then drizzle a little melted chocolate over the top.

Awesome! Simply awesome! My husband loves cheesecake and this was his favorite by far. The cake ends up so moist. Just be careful not to overcook it.

This is a keeper!  We loved these mini cheesecakes.  I put mini chocolate chips in half of them and the kids ate them all.  The other half I served with canned pie cherries on top.  DELICIOUS!  You can keep them in the freezer until you need them.

These were really good and disappeared quickly.  The recipe made 48 mini cheesecakes and one 8" cheesecake (not really deep, but an extra cheesecake nonetheless).  I usually reserve 5 stars for the OMG recipes and was going to give this a 4, but my daughter insists this qualifies as 5.

I really liked this idea, but this cheesecake recipe is not my favorite.    The condensed milk gives them a somewhat processed taste.  If I am going to go through the trouble of making something myself, I like to avoid this.  However, it is probably marginally easier.  The texture of the cheescakes turned out very well.  They didn't crack.  I cooked them for twenty minutes exactly.  I cut my recipe into thirds.  I made one third plain, one third chocolate (I used Baker's German chocolate out of personal preference), and one third rasberry and Irish cream by adding an one ounce of Baileys and three drops rasberry extract.  I prefered the flavored cheesecakes, but the plain ones weren't bad either.  The crust is a little tasteless.  Next time I will add more butter and sugar.

These are really good. To make it a little easier during the holidays I use the tin muffin cups, sprayed with a butter flavored Pam, and just pop a Nilla Wafer down in the bottom for a crust. I just take a can of cherries, strawberries, and mini-chocolate chips so that my family can top it how they choose. They're a big hit!

Delicious! I love a chocolate crust on all cheesecakes. I took a package of mini OREOs and ground them in the food processor. After adding butter and 1/8 cup sugar I patted the mix in the bottom of my muffin cups, I bake the crusts at 350' for about 8-10 minutes. LET COOL all the way before filling with cheesecake batter. YUM YUM. 

I made half of my cakes chocolate (semi-sweet chips) and the other half I mixed in white chocolate chips melted and OREO bits to make cookies & cream cheesecakes!

This was one of the worst cheesecake recipes I have ever tried. They came out dry and bubbly and the cheesecake had split from the crust. In the past the cheesecake recipes I have tried have been very easy and have turned very good. This recipe was not one of them.

These were very good but I thought they needed a tad of sugar added (even with the sweetened condensed milk).  Others who had them thought they were great as is.  They made a nice presentation.  I baked them all and then topped some with mini chocolate chips, some with mini chocolate chips, caramel, and a pecan ("turtle" version) and some with cherries.  I would use this recipe again.

This is a really great recipe!  A huge hit with my family and friends.  Although I did not have enough to fill the bottoms of all 24 cups.  I tried the chocolate variation.  Yummy!!  And so easy!

I would recommend more than the 1/4 cup of melted butter. The graham cracker crust did not hold together. It was a good thing that I made them in the paper liners!
I made the chocolate version of these for a work party and they were very, very tasty.

Very good recipe.  Cheesecakes came out delicious!  However ... I may have over cooked them, most were cracked on the top.  Nothing a lil pie filling cant hide.  Possibly because I used convention oven instead of standard.  Will definately try again using standard setting.

I made these this evening, and not sure what went wrong.. the cheesecake filling was fine until I baked it, when I took it out of the oven, they caved in (baked at 300 for 20 mins).. I will try this one again, hopefully, it will work out next time.

These turned out great.  I'm a big cheesecake fan and had never tried it with condensed milk.  Yummy.  Very easy too.  Plus they're so cute.  I tried it with the chocolate chips, which floated to the bottom a bit, but didn't detract at all.  This one's a keeper.

The best recipe ever!! So easy to make. It was the first time I made cheesecake and they turned out great!! A big hit at the party I brought them to. I used honey graham cracker crumbs and omitted the sugar. I also added 1 tbsp of flour. Then I topped with strawberry sauce and fresh strawberries and kiwi. Will definately make again!!!
