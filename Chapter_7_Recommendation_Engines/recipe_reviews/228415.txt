I soured my milk with a little lemon juice and I added a teaspoon of pure vanilla extract. I do NOT have a jumbo muffin tin, just a regular 12 cup'er. Baked at 350*, my muffins were done at a little over 20 minutes. My whole family enjoyed these muffins, they were pretty much toast by the end of the day.

I made this recipe almost exactly and it was just ok.  The only change I made was tossing the blueberries in a little flour before adding to the mix so they don't sink to the bottom.  The muffins were nice and fluffy - so A+ on that.  The flavor was just ok, not bad, just nothing over the top.  I would recommend using low-fat buttermilk instead of skim, butter not necessary and when just soft, doesn't mix well.  Try adding in some vanilla or plain Greek yogurt.

These were good, but I did make some changes. In an effort to make them a more healthy, I did 1/4 c. brown sugar and 1/4 c. honey to replace the 1/2c. white sugar. I also added 1/4c. wheat germ (replaced 1/4c of the flour). My daughter is allergic to eggs, so I used flax meal in place of the egg (1tbsp flax meal and 3tbsp water).
They came out pretty yummy, but next time I'll use some brown sugar/cinnamon on top to make the a little sweeter.

Thank you!  Simple ingredients, not too sweet.  It made exactly six jumbo muffins without any remaining batter--how satisfying.  I used all melted coconut oil in place of the butter/vegetable oil for simplicity's sake and used buttermilk rather than regular milk.  Being in a rush, I also omitted the brown sugar topping and didn't miss it in the least.  Great recipe.  You made my morning!  Just a tip, though, if you use frozen blueberries as I did, bake for 30 minutes.

Very good flavor. I used unbleached coffee filters as jumbo muffin cups. Just be sure to spray of oil them so they don't stick.

Delicious blueberry muffins. My entire family loved them. The brown sugar topping is a must. I followed recipe and it made 12 regular muffins and 9 mini muffins. Not sure how that happened? Maybe because my 4 year old was helping me?! Thanks for the yummy recipe.

So tasty! I swapped the white sugar for brown sugar because I like the taste better and threw in some toasted coconut and hemp hearts. Didn't bother with the topping. For those not thinking these are sweet enough, trying using the small wild blueberries - they're sweeter than the large ones. Will make again!

It wasnâ€™t even remotely sweet definitely will add more sugar next time. Also the blueberries were not cooked in 25 minutes I had the muffins in the oven

Used gluten free all purpose flour blend instead of the flour listed and substituted the skim milk with almond milk to be healthier . The muffins were amazing and I got several compliments on them. I will definitely be making these again!

OMG!! Sooooo yummy!!! I took others suggestions and added my own!! Soured the milk, added 1 teaspoon vanilla, I used Spenda white in the muffin. Then I made an oatmeal crumble with 1/2 C whole oats, two tablespoons whole wheat flour, 1 T melted butter and 1 heaping T Splenda brown. Mixed together, sprinkled in top. Used regular size cupcake liners in jumbo pans, baked for 20 minutes. A-mazing!!!

8 24 16 ... http://allrecipes.com/recipe/228415/jumbo-whole-wheat-blueberry-muffins/ ... 'Only had 3/4c whole wheat flour left so used that with 3/4c white; increased salt to 1/2t; added 1t vanilla (because I have to ;D); 2% milk.   The batter is pretty thin.  Since using frozen (homegrown big) berries, I coated with flour to help suspend them.  The topping has to be a typo - somehow - it works out to be 2t sugar per muffin - just on the top.  Yikes!  I made 1T sugar with 1/8t cinnamon & only used 1/8t per muffin; yes, "leftovers."  Using all wheat, I think there's still enough sugar with the sweet from the berries, btw; sometimes wheat "needs" more.  Three fifty seemed low for muffins, but whole wheat ones (I think) require a more gentle oven.  Since I used half & half, I upped to 375, 25 minutes This made twelve slightlyroundtop regular muffins.   The cinnamon isn't a predominant flavor, don't think it's supposed to be, but that's an easy fix if ya choose - add a t to the batter &/or more to the cinnamon-sugar topping (maybe 1pt cinnamon to 1-2pts sugar would do it).  I hope these are just as good once they cool.  :)  These were very well received.  E, 19, one then almost immediately another.  Verbal compliments from S.  Huh.

This  is a good muffin to use whole wheat flour.  I've made the recipe quite a few times and have substituted apple and peach for the berries.  I've also made it using raw sugar.  I like to  bake my muffins a little hotter for a little less time, I think they rise higher.

Very tasty, and the brown sugar really takes away some of the blandness that comes with whole wheat baking....I cut the brown sugar down to just a small sprinkling on top of each muffin, maybe 2tsp total and omitted the cinnamon....very tasty muffin, will definitely make again!
