Well this is a 3 egg omelet like you've never had before. YUM! The only thing I would change is to cut back on the tomatoes. A tzatziki sauce over the top would seal the deal..just sayin

No changes on the first try. Will definately make it again and add other veggies like mushrooms, red onion and asparagus.

I did not have feta cheese so I used sharp cheddar which is all I had...I do not doubt it changed the flavor however it was still delicious.. I also think heating the veggies before putting on the omelet would make it even better... I will definitely make it again only next time with the feta cheese...yummy breakfast a most important meal to me....

I made 2 changes--instead of using canned roasted tomatoes with garlic, which I didn't have on hand, I chopped some garlic, cooked it in the microwave and then added all the other ingredients for the filling--and warmed them in the microwave before putting them on the egg mixture.
