These came out great. I subbed sunflower seed butter and vanilla extract (1 tsp) and baked them in mini muffin tins. I did 9 minutes but will probably do 8 next time.

I used the vanilla extract substitute and also had to use a regular size muffin tin.  They tasted great, but had to be baked much longer and still were a little under cooked. Great little recipe for a healthier  snack!

I made these as written using the vanilla extract substitution.They took longer to bake than what the recipe states to get the clean toothpick and then the centers were still uncooked.  I will be attempting these again but using a mini muffin tin instead..

made it as is, with 1 TSP almond as many commentators pointed out. not a T. amazing!!! everyone liked it, from ages 4-32. thank you! making it again, but with vanilla instead of almond this time. thank you! also, made it in cupcake tins, not muffin tins, for the exact amount of time specified. had to wait a half hour to eat it, it is a very moist muffin, excellent.

Reduced the almond extract from tablespoon to teaspoon.  On one occasion, I was out of honey, and used maple syrup.  Was equally tasty.
