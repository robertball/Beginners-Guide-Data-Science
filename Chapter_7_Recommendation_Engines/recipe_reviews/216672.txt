This chicken was so tasty! I made it in the slow cooker, because I was going to be away all day and added 1/2 a can of low-sodium chicken broth. Wonderful taste and so very moist, I will be making this again FOR sure!

The end product was good, but the directions need tweaking.  In the first 20 minutes, the drippings began burning in the roasting pan.  I removed what I could of the burnt and added 1 1/2 cups chicken broth to prevent further problems.  After the first 30 minutes I basted on the half hour for one hour and the bird was finished with an internal temperature in excess of 180 degrees.  However, the skin was blackened.  Temperatures need to be adjusted.

I actually used this with chicken breasts cut into cubes. I added herbs, honey and butter in saucepan and heated until butter melted, then poured over chicken and baked. I cut back a little on the chili powder, cumin and cayenne. It was delicious!! I'll definitely be making it again!

EXCELLENT! I could not find my cumin, so I did have to omit that. Also, I had an orange on it's last leg, so I added the zest to the honey mixture, cut it into quarters and stuffed it inside the bird, along with a quartered onion and about 4 cloves of cracked garlic. This smelled wonderful while it was cooking, but my only complaint was that the skin sort of burned, so next time I'll keep a close eye and cover it w/ foil before it gets to that point. We all really, REALLY enjoyed this and I will definately be making it again! Thanks for sharing. :)

This was amazing! I used chicken breast and marinated them in the sauce over night, reserving some for basting. I then grilled it on our smoker/grill. I will be making this again!

I don't know what happened with Kevin's chicken,but I just made one and it was SUPER DELICIOUS!!  I had no problem with burning. It made lots of juice.
I did exactly as recipe was written.
I basted every 15. minutes.

When it comes to roasting...pan size matters. If your pan is too large your drippings are more likely to burn.

I make a lot of coatings like this.....especially on ribs. The trick is when using honey, you have to do one of 2 things. Keep it covered and uncover the last 20 min of baking to crisp up or use all the other ingredients in a rub and brush with honey the last 20 min of baking. For those of you who said the chicken had no taste, throw a cut up onion, fruit, garlic, herbs in the cavity of the chicken and it will permeate the meat and give it nice flavor. I really have to post some of my recipes on here!!!

This is a major hit at my house! I just recently made for a party I hosted and everyone loved it! I add in some chopped potatoes to the roasting pan, and I stuff the inside of the chicken with lemons, and squirt lemon juice on the outside of the chicken. Very delicious.

I was very disappointed, no taste after you got into the meat.  It looked great, but didn't have any kick to it given the spices that it had in it.  Also the strongest taste was the cumin, too much of that.

After reading the reviews, I made a few tweaks. I used chicken quarters and marinated in the honey mixture overnight.  Cut up some potatoes and an onion and threw them in a 9x13 pan and placed the chicken on top.  I made a fresh batch of the honey mixture (halved) and brushed on the tops.  Drizzled with butter and placed in the oven at 350 covered with foil.  After 25 minutes, I removed the foil, flipped the chicken and returned to the oven for another 25 minutes.  Took it out of the oven and replaced the foil and rest 10 minutes.  My boys LOVED it. They commented on the potatoes being flavorful and the chicken was moist.  Strong taste of cumin - I'm debating on whether to cut back or not.  This recipe is a keeper just for the simplicity.

This recipe turned out great! I used olive oil instead of butter just to be a bit more health conscious.I also used fresh garlic (2 big cloves pressed). I sliced up about half an onion and let that cook in the pan as well. I was only cooking for 2 so I bought a cut up chicken and only used half the pieces. Will probably recreate mixture for the other half!

AMAZING! I always make a whole teriyaki chicken and while its a family favorite, it started being over used. I decided to try something different and this was it!  The skin toasted up nice and brown. I did add a bit of chicken stock to the pan just to keep the juices from burning, but the flavor was excellent! My picky hubby loved every bit of it.  This will now replace some of those teriyaki nights, thanks!

The house smells wonderful while this is cooking.  I thought this was good just as written other than cooking time.  I realize ovens are all different but if I had cooked this even 1.5 hours it would have been very dry.  I cooked the initial instructions at 400 for 30, then it only took another 30 at 350 to reach the correct internal temp. Definitely set your mind for basting early in the 2nd half, and take the temp while doing so.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised how great this came out. Changes I made: I doubled the spices and honey, I used an oven stuffer roaster, around 7 pounds, I used a half a can of chicken broth in the pan so the honey would not burn. I started out at 400 degrees for 30 minutes and turned down the heat to 325 degrees for 1 1/2 hrs. This turned out to be one of the best roasted chickens I've ever made. It had just the right amount of heat for everyone including my 7 yr old grandson. When it finished cooking it looked like a rotisserie chicken straight off the pit. (without drying out) My family loved it and we all give it 5 stars. I will surely put this in rotation of our meals.

I like the spice with the sweet. I used boneless skinless chicken breast cut in half. I baked it for 45 minutes then broiled it for another 10 so it browned on top. Plus I added some whole roasted garlic and springs of thyme. I will make this again.

This was very good.  I made a couple of changes. I used my needle to insert some of this yummy goodness into the chicken when I basted it.  I covered after the first 30 minutes, uncovered for the last 30 and reduced the cooking time.  YUMMY!!

This was a disappointment.  We expected a very flavourful chicken with perhaps a kind of sauce from the jus but the chicken ended up burning due to the honey.  It was a pretty normal roasted chicken in the end.

This is a beautiful dish!!  It's tasty and moist, and it looks so good for entertaining.  I would have given it a full 5 stay, but I did a few things differently that I think made it better.  1.) I basted the bird every thirty minutes until it was done. 2.) I covered it with foil when it was nice and golden so it wouldn't burn, if you don't do this it WILL burn the skin. 3.) I added a tiny bit of chicken stock (water will work too) to the pan so that the drippings don't burn.  Overall a fantastic dinner though, one my family will use over and over.

Used boneless, skinless chicken thighs for this.  Put together the honey sauce in the casserole and placed the chicken in, turning to coat.  Refrigerated until cooking time, about an hour.  Cooked, covered, for 30 minutes at 350, turned the thighs over, and broiled about 15 minutes, turning once.  Very tasty.  Next time, will cook in foil-lined pan for easy clean up.  Forgot the butter and don't know what difference it would have made but it was very good without it.  Also, did not have a tablespoon of chili powder and used what we had, which was about half that.  Did not baste at all, so very little effort involved here.  Thanks for sharing!

Pretty delicious.  I have a gas oven so I browned it on 400 for 45min and it was perfectly browned. Then I cooked it for another 2 hours at 350.  The chicken was so tender it fell right off the bone.  It was a little dry but it was probably due to the fact that I forgot to baste it until the last hour.  I shredded mine and covered it with the drippings...yum, yum!!

This was delicious but it was only sweet to me, didn't seem spicy at all, and I had more then tripled the amount of cayenne it said to use.

Used split breasts and baked exactly as directed, basting every 10-15 mins...absolutely the best chicken recipe i've ever made!!! So moist and juicy the chicken actually "spit at me" when i cut into it, lol!  Will be making often ;)

I made this last night, but used a fairly large cut up chicken.  I did put foil on it for the last 15 minutes of baking so that it would not "burn".  It was delicious!!!  I'm thinking about doing the same recipe but using chicken wings. :)

This was a great recipe.  Tasty, easy to make, and enjoyed by the entire family.  I made the recipe without changing or adding any ingredients.  This will be a family regular!

Nothing special about this recipe.  If you take the skin off, it's just chicken.  My husband and I don't like spicy food at all, so I reduced the chili powder and cumin by half and used a dash of cayenne and 3/4 tsp salt.  I used the full amount of garlic powder.  If I was going to make this again, I would use the amounts stated in the recipe (except for the cayenne) - it was rather bland with the amount I used.  I used legs and thighs, baking them 20 minutes at 400 degrees, then baking 60 minutes at 350 degrees.  I basted it after 30 minutes and again just before I took itout of the oven.  The chicken was juicy.  The skin got quite brown, but I don't think it was burned.  I think it was just carmalization of the honey.  I will not be making this again - I have other recipes we like better.  If we ate white meat I might try it with skinless breasts (but we're dark meat people!).  That way you wouldn't lose all of the honey coating by pulling the skin off.

Very good! My family loved it, especially my husband. I took someone else's advice though and used it on boneless chicken breast and made the sauce ahead and then poured it on before it cooked. I've made it twice already.

If you do not eat the skin, as my family never does, the chicken has very little spicy/sweet flavor. The coating did help to make this chicken very moist, however. Next time I plan to make this in the slow cooker; Adding 3/4C chicken broth, substituting 1/2 tsp Northwoods seasoning (very spicy from Penzy's) for the garlic powder and omitting the oil. I will also coat the chicken UNDER the skin, thus keeping the skin for moistness but allowing the flavor to penetrate the meat. Hopefully with these tweaks we will have a yummy dish.

This is a five-star recipe for taste but am giving it four stars because of the directions.  I also had problems with the outer chicken getting brown too quickly.  I basted it every 15-20 minutes and had to add chicken broth to have enough basting juice.  Ended up covering the bird with aluminum foil the last 20 minutes or so to ensure the skin didn't burn.  The taste was wonderful and just as good the next day as left-overs.

I used drumsticks instead of whole chicken but I did not enjoy this recipe. I followed exactly & it really was bland. If I were to do this again, I would season chicken first before the rub.

Just ok.  I seasoned the chicken with salt and pepper before adding the honey mixture.  The mixture Did not burn in the pan.  It was not very spicy or sweet, it lacked flavor, I added honey on top at the end.

I made this for my Passover dinner and it was a huge hit.  I did baste it quite a bit with the butter, and add chopped apple to the cavity, but other than that I followed the recipe and had a beautiful result.
It was moist, tender, and had an amazing flavor.  Will make again.

Delicious! I poured the mixture over chicken tenderloins, baked them for 45 min. at 350, and broiled for about five minutes. Next time I will use less cumin (personal preference). I will definitely make this again!

OMG...this chicken is amazing. I made it today for easter dinner and there was absolutely nothing left in the pain except the remaining spoonful of honey sauce. I followed directions  exactly making sure to baste about every 15 mins or so to keep chicken from burning and to also seal in the flavors. I will be making this again and thanks for posting this wonderful recipe!!!

The combination of flavors is delicious! I did find the honey mixture difficult to spread, so I mixed it with the butter and heated all in the microwave. I poked some holes in the chicken with a fork, then poured the mixture over it. Also followed the advice of others and cooked at 350 the entire time, covering and uncovering the chicken as needed to get the crispy coating without burning. My family loved it!

Delicious! Cooked it at 350 the entire time and it was perfect, no burnt honey on top. Next time I think I'll try add some onion and garlic cloves to the cavity!

I used the sauce for chicken legs and I enjoyed it but the two 5 year olds were not convinced, I even left out the cayenne.  The skin was yummy but the meat itself was a bit blah.  I would marinate the chicken before doing it again.

This recipe is great! 

I only changed a few things-I didn't have cayenne pepper, substituted chili flakes for chili powder and chopped 1 clove of garlic instead of using garlic powder . I really liked the flavor and will totally make this recipe again!

Thank-you for sharing this recipe!

We tried to make this into a beer can chicken. Didn't work so well. Really blackened the chicken skin. The meat tasted Blaaahhhhh!!!!!! But it was very moist as all beer can chicken is.  The outside skin was tasty when not blackened.

I made this pretty much as the recipe states except I used a smaller fryer (about 4 pounds).  Since I only had about 1/3 cup of honey made up the difference with some Asian sweet chili sauce (there was more than enough mixture to coat the chicken inside and out).  I cooked it in an open cast iron dutch oven for the first 30-45 minutes at 400.  I glazed it a couple of times.  For about the next hour I cooked it with the lid on at 350 (to ensure that the chicken was cooking through)...the glaze really bubbled and it practically braising.  I removed the lid and let the skin finish to a crispy brown.  The chicken nearly falls off the bone and I could literally cut it with the serving spoon that I used to take it out of the dutch oven.  The taste is excellent.   I really don't know how it could be improved, however I did use the older spices in my cabinet as I am in the process of replacing them with organic.  The chicken was of high quality, free range, vegetable fed, locally raised purchased at Whole Foods which I recommend, it is not that much more expensive.  I will definitely make this for friends.  It seems like it would be better paired with some sort of slaw and fries than roasted potatoes as shown.

The recipe looks wonderful! How did it brown up in the slow cooker?  Anyone think it would work on a bone- in turkey breast or does that need too much more baking time?

The whole family liked this! I cut up a whole chicken but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. This will be a new staple in the meal rotation!

We made this last night. Turned out great. I put chicken stock in roasting pan before starting this dish. As mixture runs off did not want it to burn. Also cooked it at 350for 2 hrs. 5 lbs bird.that way it didn’t burn the skin

I really loved this recipe, the family was just so-so about it, saying they didn't think it had a lot of flavor.  I made a few changes to the amounts of the spices:
1.  Chili powder 1-1/2 tsps
2.  Cumin 1-1/4 tsp
3.  Cayenne 1/4 tsp
I baked it 30 minutes uncovered then baked it for 1-1/2 hours covered and basted with a SPOON not a baster.  Next time I'll up the spices a bit so maybe the family will like it more.

Not happy at all with this recipe. It didn't have the flavor I was hoping for. It wasn't worth the time it took me to clean up the baked on mess.

It was nice but not exceptional. The marinade was burnt on top and the drippings in the pan were also burnt . All the flavor is on the skin which we don't eat and did not contribute to the taste of the chicken. I don't think I will be making it again.

Followed nykrow's suggestion of slow cooking it in broth. Dear god, amazing. Fall apart tender and juicy. My only suggestion is to use a little bit more honey; didnt really get much honey flavor.

very delicious and juicy. I basted in 15 minute intervals. it's not actually "spicy" but more flavorful. I'll try in with double the cayenne next time. :)

Was great on chicken breast. I halved the recipe for 2 breasts (300g each), cooked in a toaster oven for 30 minutes at 400F on aluminum foil. Tasted excellent but not as spicy as expected. Maybe next time I'll add a bit more cayenne.

I used this marinade on chicken wings and baked them in the oven. They were great. If I had of marinated them for longer they would have been fantastic.

This recipe was awesome! My chicken was a bit smaller so it only took about 1.5 hours and I was out of cumin so I used curry powder instead. I'll definitely repeat this one!

I roast a chicken pretty much every weekend. It allows me to pull dinner together rather quickly throughout the week. Needless to say, I have tried nearly every recipe imaginable - and this one stands head and shoulders above the rest. 

I always stuff my chicken with 1 apple and 4-5 cloves of garlic, so this was the only change I made to the recipe. Oh, and I reduced the temperature to 250 and cooked it a tad bit longer. This recipe is superb!

As long as you baste it, as the recipe says, it doesn't burn. The skin gets a beautiful crisp, but it certainly doesn't burn if you watch it and keep basting it.

Simple, yet good. I used bone-in chicken thighs and halved the recipe. Was a good amount for four thighs.

Made this for a family get together and it disappeared quickly.    Had a great skin/crunch on it. The only bad thing about it was...My mother asked me what restaurant I bought it at.  REALLY?  LOL!  So will not make this for her again, but will make this for me.

a moist chicken with a little heat and a little sweet, a good little recipe. I like a bit more bite and will adjust the cayenne pepper nect time. Will definitely make this again!

Delicious! Keeping other review comments in mind I reduced the amount of time on 400 and covered the bird with foil once it got dark - which was pretty fast. Loved the skin. Definitely will make this again and again.

the flavor of the sauce is excellent, but same comments as previous posters. If you put the sauce on the skin you get burnt skin and not flavored chicken. Lift the skin and put the sauce UNDER the skin and you get flavored un burnt chicken. For personal taste reasons I cut the hot pepper in half to 1/4 tsp....but the real change here is in the sauce application

The chicken was delicious. I followed another person's suggestion and doubled the honey mixture and put it inside the skin so the flavor would come through. (and rubbed it on the outside too)I added 1/2 cup chicken broth to the pan so the honey didn't burn. I had to cover in tin foil after about 45 minutes because the outside was getting very golden!

I wasn't a big fan of this one.  With all that honey (ie. sugar) and spices, I'd have expected a LOT more in flavors-ville.  Because the sugar in the honey caramelizes, it turns the skin brown quickly but it's a false positive.  You think you're getting golden crispy skin but it's just turning colors.  It was around 30 minutes when I saw how brown the skin was, so I reduced the temperature as indicated to 350 F.  I guess I should have let it go longer because the skin was still soft and amazingly, flavorless.  I followed the recipe exactly.  

Also, the recipe asks the cook to apply the baste by hand.  I found that it preferentially sticks to your hand and runs off the chicken when it does manage to land on it.  

Another reviewer mentioned this but I wanted to reiterate; the sauce on the bottom of the pan does burn and I'm surprised the smoke alarms didn't go off.  Maybe I got to the window in time.  I dumped a bottle of water into the bottom and mixed it around.  Perhaps this was a mistake, I don't know.

On the plus side, the chicken wasn't dry and was beautifully cooked and moist/tender.  

Sadly, we were thankful to have a few packets of Jack-in-the-box Buffalo Sauce to rescue us in the flavor department. :/  I generally agree with most reviewers and enjoy many of the recipes that I try.  I was shocked that this turned out so "mehh". 

I will try this recipe again and see if browning it longer makes a difference.   And I'll add some chicken broth early to avoid smoke.

Made this with boneless chicken thighs. Put the thighs in a pan with sauce and covered with foil as recommended. Uncovered it for the last 10 mins of cooking. The honey mixture made a great sauce and pretty presentation.  Will make this again! Amazing!

My husband loved this dish! I would definitely make it again. I left out the cayenne so it wasn't very spicy. Next time, I think I will add some or at least some black pepper. Enjoy!

I haven't tried this yet but it looks awesome. My first try with this won't be with chicken though. Easter is next weekend so I am going to try this with our Easter ham. I'll post back the results.
