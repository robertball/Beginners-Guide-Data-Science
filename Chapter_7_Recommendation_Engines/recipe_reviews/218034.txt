Very nice recipe, combining everything I like in one:  lentils are always a nice change from other beans and legumes; as a Barbadian-American, rice is a staple in our menu -- Basmati's popcorn-like flavor is just an added boost; and caramelized onions (the miracle vegetable!) are fabulous!  We'll be making this one again.  (Didn't have Basmati rice the first two times I made this; used jasmine the first time and good old Uncle Ben's converted long-grain the second time.  Both worked exceptionally well!)

I guess I must have done something wrong. My basmati NEVER turned white and it was crunchy..not good at all. I had to put Pink Himalayan Salt and Garlic to have any taste.

This is tasty! I did change a few things: I put in an extra cup and a half of water when I added the rice, just because I don't know how it's physically possible to cook a cup of lentils AND a cup of rice together in only 2 cups of water. I also added cumin and a little garlic powder.

This is quite delicious and strangely addictive. Those caramelized onions just rock, totally.  I added some ground cumin and chili peppers. This went very well with thick, savoury yogurt. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious and simple. I thought I'd eat one small side helping. Ended up filling up and eating two big bowls. Husband loved it, and I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.

Great recipe! I added tofu for some protein, along with paprika and garlic salt for a bit of spice and flavor. Very easy but tastes amazing, highly recommend :)

This was tasty! In reading previous reviews, ppl stated everything was crunchy or undercooked or there was insufficient water, this is probably due to not soaking the lentils overnight... I soaked my green lentils (cover with 2” of water above the lentils)  then in the morning, drained them and left them till Dinner prep time. I also opted to add a few generous shakes of Both med. curry powder and a bit more than that of Cumin along with the salt. 
The onion prep is time consuming, but the end result is delicious. My 14yr old son liked it very much and my husband ate it all but didn’t state it was delicious ir anything -but he ate the heaping portion I served him. 
Also, I believe this is a fairly healthy side dish and will definitely make it again. :)

My ex husband from Iraq taught me to make this but heavy on the curry and using jasmine rice, still a staple for me, love it! Thank you for sharing!

Shortly after the rice went in, the water had been all absorbed so I added more to equal twice the amount of rice and lentils. This worked out well and everything cooked fine then. A bit bland though. I carmelized some sliced fennel bulb instead of the onion and it went very nicely with this dish.

The result is dry, crunchy and inedible. More water or pre-soaking is required. I added more water and found that when the rice was done the lentils were hard.

not enough water; the beans absorb most of it. The rice was crunchy and took for ever to soften. I added more water to try to soften the rice.

This is a quick, easy recipe, and it tastes great! I'm just wondering what this is traditionally served with? Is this typically a side dish or the main dish of a meal? I only know a few Assyrian recipes but I'd love to know more! Thanks for sharing!
