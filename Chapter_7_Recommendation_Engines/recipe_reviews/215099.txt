My husband loved this recipe! Very delicious. I used real bacon instead of bacon bits and that really added a good kick!

I'm giving this 4 stars for overall flavor.  I chose this recipe because of the ingredient list......how bad can it be when there is bacon?!  As I read the instructions I thought it to be labor intensive and losing nutrients when tossing out the cooking water.  Instead, I sauted the onion and bacon till tender.  then I tossed in the diced potatoes and cooked a little bit.  Finally I added the green beans and a cup of broth, salt and pepper stirred it all up and simmered until veggies were tender.   Lastly I added a can of Cream of Mushroom and more broth to make it 'soupy'.    Husband loved it!

Came out AMAZING!! I added a few different things.. I followed the recipe as it said but when I melted the butter for the onions and bacon I also added 2 tbps of minced garlic 2/3 cup of bacon and a tsp of adobo, then I mixed the condensed chicken soup with 1 cup of chicken broth and 2 cups of milk.. once everything was done saut√©ing I added all the ingredients together along with the potatoes that were set aside and it came out very flavorful and really delicious!!

This was really good! I used skim milk and also added some cooked chopped turkey sausage for a little more protein. It was great!

My husband liked it more than I did.  It just didn't have enough flavor for my preference.  I also didn't use the soda because even though it makes the green beans more colorful, it makes them too mushy.
