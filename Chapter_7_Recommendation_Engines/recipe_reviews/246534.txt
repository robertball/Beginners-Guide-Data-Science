It is time I must invest in a larger wok! This recipe is great. My sister's all ate and wanted more. I like spice so I added more red pepper flakes and marinated the shrimp iwith dry lemon- pepper rub while I  prep the vegetables. Very good 5 stars! Thank you.

Made as written except that I used only orange and yellow bell due to what I had on hand and I chose to use ground pepper instead of the whole peppercorns because they are not pleasant to crunch down on in a dish. This was pretty good but a little heavy on the fish sauce. It screamed freshness and it is one I will make again.
