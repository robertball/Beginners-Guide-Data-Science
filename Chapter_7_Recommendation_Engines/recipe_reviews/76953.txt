I "blended" this recipe with one for a dry-brined turkey from Fine Cooking -- so that I did not have to wet brine two turkeys.  Splitting the bird and roasting it flat was a FANTASTIC time-saver!!!  I made Thanksgiving dinner for 20 with only one oven -- and am so grateful for this recipe.  The gravy is fantastic!!!

Easiest and best turkeys I ever cooked.  The brine keeps the breast moist even after being kept warm (over 140) for over an hour.  And the smaller birds cook so quickly.  I loved having one carved, on its platter, and warmed even before my guests arrived.

My dad taught me how to make pan gravy the same way...BUT, we use flour and milk instead of cornstarch and water. Comes out super rich and delicious. Every Thanksgiving I always get a ton of compliments:)

My mother in law announced she was done hosting thanksgiving and passed the torch on to me. I'd never made a turkey before and was nervous about it. The directions were clear and easy to follow. The turkeys came out perfect (though I found out the hard way you are not supposed to leave the meat thermometer in the bird while its cooking), the gravy was good and half of the vegetables were good. My only complaint was that the veggies from bird 1 were charred into bricks by the time bird 2 was done roasting. Next time I will simply set the veggies from bird 1 aside with the bird.
