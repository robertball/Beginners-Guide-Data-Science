We have made carmelitas for years, its even in our church cook book. This is a great recipe, althought you do not have to get caramel candies... You can use caramel ice cream topping like smuckers, etc. For xmas I used the milky way kind of topping it was wonderful. Just a tip to save you a lot of time, who wants to unwrap all those candies, expensive too..

These were sinfully rich and delicious. My husband's co-workers raved about them, and I sent them as Christmas gifts with the recipe attached. The only thing I would change to the instructions is that I had to reheat the caramel after it was "set aside" because it was too thick to drizzle, so maybe this step could be done while the crust is baking? Otherwise - amazing!!

I absolutely loved these!  They are a bit crumbly (just the topping), but the RICH flavor is to die for!  The caramels make it heavenly.  One reviewer suggested using coconut and I think that would be delicious too!  I was asked for the recipe more times for this than any other dessert I've shared at work.

Rich and gooey!  Definitely wait until these are completely cooled to cut- and even then, they're pretty crumbly.

I made this recipe for a family reunion and it was a big hit.  It was very rich so I had some left over.  The only changes I made were 1) using heavy whipping cream instead of evaporated milk, and 2) adding a bag of toffee chips to the nuts and chocolate chips.  It was delicious!  I will definitely make again!

These are very easy and fast to make.  Fantastic taste, but they do not keep very well.  I made them on Friday and they were stale by Sunday.  I think when I make them next time if I make them more than 2 days in advance I will freeze them.

The BEST carmelita recipe on here! I have made several others, but they don't compare to this one! The only thing I do differently is to use 2 jars of Smucker's caramel ice cream topping instead of the individually wrapped caramels and milk. Oh, and for personal preference, I use pecans instead of walnuts. I press the bottom lightly into the pan, bake for 10 minutes, then add nuts, chocolate and caramel. Then sprinkle on the topping and smush down as hard as possible without oozing the caramel through. After baking for 25 minutes, they come out perfect and not at all crumbly! PERFECTION! And if you mix all the oatmeal/flour/sugar/butter in a gallon sized zipper bag and then bake in a disposable foil pan, you don't have a single dish to do afterwards!!!!

These are very good! A lot like the carmelitas I remember my college dorm serving and I've been making this recipe for years. I find that it's easiest to put 2/3 of the oatmeal mixture on the bottom and 1/3 sprinkled on top. I also pour the caramel on first, then sprinkle the chocolate chips on top of the caramel.  Really great tasting, but a little crumbly!

These are an absolute new favorite at our house - they are delicious and very easy to make.  People think they are a gourmet cookie bar and always ask for the recipe. I have made them both with caramels and with hersheys or ghiradelli caramel sauce. Both taste great - I dont prefer one over the other in taste but like not having to unwrap all the caramels.  Thanks for the recipe  - amazing!

These are great.  I only make one change.  Instead of using caramels with the evaporated milk, I use a 17 oz jar of Mrs. Richardson's Butterscotch Caramel.  I melt it in the microwave and it makes it so much easier than using caramels.  You can find it by the ice cream in grocery stores like Kroger.  The difference is amazing!

I made this recipe a few weeks ago and didn't like it very much.  Tonight, I made it again with a few changes.  I used the 5 ounce can of evaporated milk which really didn't make too much of a difference, but there was no waste and that meant that I used 5 ounces.  I added 1/2 stick of butter and an egg to the oatmeal mixture and it was so much better.  Last time it was so crumbly.  I also changed the temperature to 375 degrees, but it could be that my oven is not as hot.  This recipe is AWESOME!  You go, girl!  This is definitely a keeper.  Thanks, again.

YUMMMM.  My girlfriend called them the "candy bars" and told me off 'cause she ate all of them!  A little crumbly/messy, but worth it!  Not difficult, very rich...I substituted coconut for the nuts as I am allergic.
The next time I made these I added one beaten egg in with the melted butter to the dry ingredients.  I added about 6 minutes to the initial bake time, then an additional 10 to the end bake time.  Made a big difference in eliminating most of the crumbling, and easier to cut as well.  I cut them into 32 bars.  YUM.

Very Good, VERY crumbly! Next time I make these I will try using softened butter instead of melted (read in another recipe that this helps with the crumbling). I'll also add a tsp of vanilla to the oat batter.

Amazing. I can see why waiting for the bars to cool before cutting would be helpful, but there is no way I can wait that long to have the first piece. Only change I made was to leave out the walnuts. Oh and I used one stick of butter and one of margarine.

I have made these countless times, and have yet to find anyone who does not LOVE them. The oatmeal gives them chewiness and substance, the nuts and chocolate chips add a little crunch- a wonderful combination with the smooth caramel!

Quite tasty. I live in Britain where it seems to be difficult to find caramels so I tried another reader's suggestion to use caramel ice cream topping mixed with 6 tablespoons of flour. Also, I dislike almonds, so I toasted 1 cup of ALMONDS with a little bit of butter in a pan until light brown and used these instead - very very good.

According to the Kraft site 14 ounces of caramels is equal to 48 caramels. I cut my recipe in half and used an 8 inch square baking pan. I got 16 nice sized squares out of it and were they ever good. My husband found them a little too sweet but I thought they were fantastic!

Absolutely wonderful! The only thing I did different was wait to melt the caramel while the crust was in the oven and that was perfect timing. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing. Thank you.

Wow!!!  My husband and I love these!  I loved them so much that I baked them for our church's pie and dessert auction last month.  I made some more last night and halfway through the recipe I realized I only had 1/2 the butter so I substituted with 1/2 shortening.  It tasted just as good!  YUMMY TO MY TUMMY!!!!

I let these cool over night to avoid the excessive crumbling/mushiness others complained about.  Just cut into them this morning and the bottom layer is nice and firm.  I used 3 -4 Tblspns of 1% milk as I found out last minute that my evaporated milk had spoiled.  I think they'll be a hit!

These are very rich and delicious. They were my new cookie to try for Christmas this year. My husband loved them! I did everything just as the recipe states. I did leave the carmel on the oven, which was a little warm, while I cooked the crust. This kept the carmel nice and smooth, so it was easy to drizzle when the time came.

Delicious!  I have made this a few times, and always to rave reviews.  Easy to make, and the kids enjoy helping (especially since the dough is so yummy to pick in...)!  I used real butter, and I think that makes a lot of difference.  In a pinch, I'll use a jar of caramel sauce instead of the caramels & condensed milk--it's cheaper and easier than peeling a package of caramels (which are hard to find anyway).  Do coat the pan well with cooking spray or oil, as the caramels can stick badly!

I made these with some friends at an annual cookie-baking day.  We burned our hands on the hot filling cuz we could NOT wait to eat them!  :o)  These are sooooo delicious.  And since they're fairly rich, you can get 32 servings out of the pan.  Perfect for a pot-luck or when you need a lot of something fast.  The recipe couldn't be any easier.  I will definitely make these again!

I made these yesterday just for something to do, and I was thrilled with the results. They are delicious, although, they are so sweet, you can only have but so much in one sitting! I will definitely be making these for our next big church gathering! Thanks for the great recipe!

I have made 2 batches of these in the last 4 days.  I doubled the recipe as suggested by others, I use half semi-sweet chips and half milk chocolate, and pecans.  They are so good, and so easy to make.  Beautiful presentation, and they don't last long once everybody tastes them!  Thanks Becky!!

These are sinful!!  They are easy to make, gooey, sweet, chewy, and wonderful.  I substituted pecans for walnuts (I like the flavor and crunchiness better), and would recommend using Kraft caramels over any other (for flavor).  I also recommend refrigerating them, too - less mess.  A big hit!

I followed this recipe exactly.These were way too crumbly,grainy with sugar,and really disgustingly sweet.They sounded amazing and looked good when they came out of the oven,however when cutting they were way too crumbly and I could not avoid a lot of the  topping falling off and hitting the floor,

These are very good.  With a cup of butter, they are obviously quite rich, but seriously good.  I snuck in some wheat germ to the crumble part, and it makes me feel better about eating them!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Four stars, because the recipe is a little off, but they taste SO good when done!  I say it's off, because you are supposed to use half the topping on the bottom, and half on top.  Well, there is not enough to go on the top and bottom; only the bottom.  I ended up having to make another 1/2 topping recipe so I could have that top latyer.  It was annoying, and I used SO much butter!!  But they are SO good, I only deducted one star for that.  I cut back on the sugar too.  Maybe this recipe would work in an 8x8 pan?

Sooooo good! Very, very rich, just the way I like my treats. I used whole wheat flour and reduced the chocolate chips to about 3/4 cup. I will make this again for sure!

Maybe it's just my own personal taste, but I thought these were just so-so.  It seemed the oatmeal and semi sweet chocolate overpower the recipe.  I'm a huge caramel lover and would have liked to taste more of it through the other ingredients.

I really enjoyed these. Reminded me of 7 layer bars.  I found that you really need to compress the base crust in order for it not to fall apart and firmly pressing the top layer also helps.

If desired, you can half the recipe easily.  My Dad and 14 year old brother were fans, but Mom and I thought it was slightly better than average.  I doubled the oatmeal mixture, and don't reccomend doing so because it overpowers the caramel and chocolate taste.  Made without walnuts, and overall the recipe is quick and easy.

Very easy to make, and I received many compliments. I think next time I make them, I won't use the full 2 cups of chocolate chips. It overpowered the taste of the caramel.

Wow!  These bars are amazing.  I shared them with friends who proclaimed them to be "the best dessert ever."  I left out the walnuts (personal preference) and cut down on the amount of chocolate chips based on other reviewers' suggestions.  I also used regular oats instead of quick cooking oats, and had no problems.  They are crumbly, but who cares when they taste so good?

Very chewy and delicious.  I didn't have the quick oats on hand, so I had to use the regular ones.  I think they probably would be better with the quick, so next time I will follow the recipe.  The top was a little too crumbly, so maybe I will also add a little extra butter.

Absolutely delicious!  These have become a family favorite and I'm always requested to make them for the holidays.  I only use half the amount of chocolate chips, otherwise it's just too much chocolate.  I've also used milk chocolate chips instead of semisweet and it was just as good.  I melted my carmels in the microwave with the milk instead of on the stove.  It's much easier that way.

These were excellent!  My son and I made a batch yesterday and took some to a family dinner.  They went over very well.  They are also easy and fun to make.
They are a little crumbly, but I think maybe a little more butter mixed in may help.
Thanks for the great recipe

They were really good. The first day, I didn't think they were beyond great... but in the days after they were really good.
I took them in to my students at school, and they loved them. So did my husband.
The only changes I would like to make is to cut back on the chocolate. It seems like the chocolate overpowers the caramel.
Otherwise, it's easy to make (except unwrapping the caramels) and tasted really good. Thanks!

This would be another one that if possible...I would have given more than five stars! These were unbelievable. With all the carmel,chocolate and brown sugar I would have thought that they would be very sweet but they weren't at all. I had two last night after I made them and I had one already this morning. Very, very addicting!

The worse part is unwrapping all of those carmels.  The recipe was good but too rich for our taste. I think I may have added too many chocolate chips so would be willing to try it again.  Sent them to college with my son and roomates ate them up

I made the recipe for the second time today, leaving out the chocolate and doubling the nuts. I also use 3 Cups of mini caramel chips instead of the individually wrapped caramels.It is scrumptious! My family really loves it.I plan to use more recipes from this site!

I made these in a pie dish, and they came out quite nicely. I also topped them with crushed peanut M&M's--one of the reasons this recipe is so great is that you can put in almost any candy you want and it will taste good and be personalized!

This is a dangerous dessert--VERY sinful as one rating said, but fantastic. Gooey, rich and addicting.

This was good, will definitely make it again. Reduced brown sugar to 1/2 cup (you're adding a bunch of caramel on top!), and used salted butter, so just a pinch of additional salt. Reduced chocolate chips to 1 cup because too many will overwhelm the caramel. I melted chewy Werther's caramels rather than Kraft because they are much more delicious. Added 1 egg to the cookie batter and no issues with crumbling. Omitted the nuts so that my daughter could take some to school, but will try toasted pecans sometime.

I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  They were very good.  I think when I make them again , I may either cut back on the crust a little or increase the caramel/chocolate later.  The ratio of crust to gooey goodness was a little high.  They still tasted great, though!

These are wonderful and really pretty easy!  I didn't have plain chocolate chips, but had caramel filled ones.  Used those instead and they were great.  Also used the Kraft caramel bits and melted them with 1/3 cup whipping cream in the microwave.  Yum!

I have made this recipe a few times now.  I either use a jar of Mrs. Richardson's caramel/butterscotch sauce with 3 tbsp flour or I melt a bag of the caramel "dots" (already unwrapped caramels) with a can of sweetened condensed milk. I have had good luck with both.  The dots are getting harder to find though.  I might try adding an egg as others suggested to help with the crumbly topping.  But still amazingly good and husband and kids devour them!

I think this needed more caramel, or perhaps less crust.  It mostly tasted like flour and chocolate chips.

You definitely need a glass of milk with these - so rich! My coworkers raved. Only change was to add an egg to the oat mixture to prevent crumbling.

I found this recipe when looking for an "easy" addition for my Christmas cookie selection. I've gotten so many requests for the recipe; I had to make 3 more pans! They are excellent.  I made one small change, using a jar of caramel ice cream topping instead of making the caramel.  Also I omitted the walnuts. These are the best cookies I made this year!!

I'm gonna give this a five, because I'm sure it would've been if I hadn't messed it up.  I wasn't thinking and poured the entire can can of evap. milk in with my caramels.  I salvaged it with some brown sugar and corn syrup, but I'm sure the taste was off.  All in all, they were good!!

I thought that the crust in this recipe tasted a little too "floury" or "oaty," but everyone else raved over it.  I will make this again, but will probably make some adjustments in the crust/topping mix.

This is by far one of the easiest bars to make.  I loved it and the caramels really pull it all together.  I also left out the nuts and it was just as good.  A keeper!

WOW! These bars are incredible! I'm not usually a huge fan of chocolate and caramel together, but this was outstanding! I had to omit the nuts because of an allergy, but even so, they're awesome! This is DEFINATELY a new staple in my house! :-)

This is a wonderful recipe.  Instead of the caramels and evaporated milk I used a jar of caramel ice cream topping mixed with 6 tablespoons of flour.  It was great!  I think next time I might try Butterscotch topping instead.  One of my new favorites!

I just made this today, for a PTA meeting and everyone was asking for the recipe!  I added about a quarter cup extra butter that another reviewer had suggested.  Due to the fact that the bars were still very gooey, after cooling them for an hour, I placed them in the refrigerator for a couple of hours.  This seemed to firm them up enough for me to cut them into squares.

Delicious, although I did have some trouble lifting them out of the pan and the top was more crumbly than I was expecting.  That may have been my fault, however, as I was distracted and may have added one extra cup of oats.  The taste more than makes up for it, however.  We'll never know for sure unless I make up another pan!

WOW, WOW, YUMMY!!!
I'm more of a carmel fan, than chocolate, so i used 1 cup of chips instead of 2, Next time I think I will use even less or leave out, the carmel part is too good.  Satisfied the craving.

Ok I thought these were to die for! But does anyone have any suggestions on how to make them less crumbly? they are so good I just wish they would hold together a little better. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

These are wonderful!! I used pecans instead of walnuts and they turned out great. So easy-the hardest part is waiting to eat them. Will be making these alot!!

These are great!  My boyfriend hates anything with chocolate--so you can imagine.....They were gone at work really quickly also!

I doubled the recipe and made one set in a regular 9 X 13 pan, and the other in a disposable aluminium pan--use the disposable--sometimes the caramal sticks, and it's just easier to throw away the cheapie pan.  These are great!

The only thing that shocked me was that there were no eggs!  I had to check the recipe before I put it in the oven to be sure.

Overall it was a good receipe.  It was very rich and sweet!  It does have the potential to become spendy!

These were too rich, messy, and pretty expensive.
