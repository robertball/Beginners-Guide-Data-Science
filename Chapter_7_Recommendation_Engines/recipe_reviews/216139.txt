This is ok. I made it twice. The first time exactly as written. The method works perfectly. The flavor was just ok, though. For the second batch, I added more almonds, left out the cacao, added flax seeds for more crunch and added a couple of tbsp of brown sugar. I thought it was better after tweaking it. I would suggest trying this recipe, adjust according to your tastes. It certainly beats high priced, store bought granola. Itâ€™s good with milk, on yogurt, or on ice cream. Thank you for the recipe.
