I found this recipe looking for some real comfort food for dinner tonight with ingredient that I had.  I'd like to start off by saying that I am not a calorie-counter--  never, ever actually, but happened to see the calorie count in the nutrition info and was shocked at the calories and fat in this dish!  852 calories and 64.8 gms of fat in one serving! Holey Moley!  I made some substitutions for taste and to lower the cal/fat.  I parboiled my potatoes, but I won't bother next time.  An hour in the oven will be fine as long as you slice them relatively thin (1/8 inch).  I added a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce and some chopped banana peppers (with the extra juice squeezed out) to the ground beef.  For the sauce I substituted 1.5 cups of 2% milk and 1.5 cups of light chicken stock for the 3 cups of milk.  Instead of a cup of heavy cream I used 1/2 cup of sour cream that I had on hand.  I was going to add a full cup but the sauce was rich enough with only 1/2 cup .  These substitutions cut the fat and calories by half!  I also added an additional 1 tbl. of flour to the roux because some other reviewers complained of runniness.  I browned-up the roux to  make the sauce a little more robust.  Be sure to keep the flame low and keep stirring.  

I used 2 cups of cheese instead of 4, which seemed like overkill:  I used 1 cup of a jack, cheddar, asadero blend and 1 cup of shredded mozz.

I cooked it for an hour in a large cast-iron skillet and it was perfectly done: crisp and bro

What a wonderful flavor. After reading some reviews about not being able to get the potatoes fully cooked, I just boiled them before slicing them. (brought them to a boil, turned them off and covered them for ten minutes, then I bathed them in cold water, till I was ready to slice them) The result was a slightly under cooked potato that finished off nicely in the casserole. It turned out great. The next day I put the left overs in an augratin dish over a bed of frozen peas. I added a tbls of heavy cream to the peas, and topped it all with a little more cheese. Again great result.

This was great, loved it.  The only changes I made was I increased the hamburger to two pounds and used a 2 pound bag of Ore-Ida Southern style hash browns in place of the potatoes. Next time I'll use a bigger baking dish as it barely all fit.

This recipe (with a few of my adjustments and adjustments made by other reviewers) was SOOOO GOOD!  First, instead of cooking the onions, which I didn't have, I started right with cooking the ground beef.  I seasoned extra lean ground beef with plenty of onion powder and garlic powder, some Adobo seasoning, steak seasoning, garlic salt, 1/2 small can of chopped green chilies (suggested by reviewers from New Mexico) and black pepper.  I then added a scoop of sour cream to the cooled meat and about 1TB. of Worcestershire sauce.  Next for the Au Gratin potato portion, I made the roux like directed (no problems here for me) and then mixed in about 2 tsp. of chicken bouillon and about 2 cups of 1% milk.  When this mixture thickened up, I turned off the heat and added 2 cups of grated sharp cheddar cheese, the rest of the can of chopped green chilies, another 1 TB. of Worcestershire sauce and about 1/2C. of sour cream.  To the sauce, I added my thin cut potato slices (I used 3 large red potatoes that I had boiled until tender, then peeled and sliced).  Lastly, I layered my potato mixture with ground beef in a buttered baking dish (potatoes, beef, potatoes, beef, ending with potatoes).  I baked dish covered at 350 degrees for 45 minutes.  And then uncovered dish, added some green onions (chives) to the top and cooked for an additional 10 minutes.  For the last 5 minutes, I broiled the dish in order to get a bubbly and toasty top.  My husband loved the dish!!

Awesome!  My husband loves it so much that he could eat the whole pan by himself!  The only thing I did differently was used tater tots instead of potatoes to save time on chopping.  If you do this, make sure you bake them in the oven for about 20 min (while meat is browning) before you layer them or else the casserole will take FOREVER to cook!  Delicious!

I followed the recipe exactly and my family absolutely loved it.  I will hang on to this one.  I would bake it an hour so the potatoes are softer.

I cut back on the potatoes and cooked them before I mixed them in...if onions are too potent...saute them before browning the hamburger...garlic and onion powder...extra cheese

This turned out excellent. Husband and I loved it and he has requested I make it again! He said I should add more cheese, but he says that about everything. At first I thought I would need to add more meat because hubby is a big meat eater, but the meat-to-potato ratio is perfect, DON'T CHANGE IT!!! My only suggestion is to cut the potatoes into smaller pieces.

In my book, this is a recipe to be used as a springboard for your own interpretation.  I made it my way last night, and it was very, very good...as simple comfort food.  I knew at a glance that the white sauce was wrong (and other reviewers found runny) so I used Cook's Illustrated classic white sauce: 1/4 cup butter, generous 1/4 cup flour, two cups chicken stock and 3/4 cup heavy cream. Perfect. I diced my onions for my toddler's sake and sauteed in bacon fat to pack some more flavor. I then removed them, sauteed the beef in 1 tbsp bacon fat as well and then combined the onions and beef. I par-boiled the potatoes and sliced them thin.  Then I layered as directed using my white sauce and just eyeballing the cheese.  I was a bit worried I might not have enough white sauce but it really spread out and expanded during cooking and was perfect.  We really enjoyed this very much as I made it! Might add sauteed chopped spinach to the beef mixture next time -- not to improve the flavor but to sneak more veggies in my son...

This was delicious!, My entire family liked it alot.  Even my very picky 5 year old asked for seconds.  I added mushrooms to the layers. I am sure you can add anything you like. Yummy! But I did have to bake it for 1 hour to ensure that the potatoes cooked thoroughly.

NEEDS changes! #1 Be sure to add enough salt and pepper to make a difference, and add garlic and parsley to beef mixture, and sprinkle paprika on final top. #2  Be prepared to leave this "covered" in the oven for a ample amount of time. I baked it for 1:40 minutes and the potatoes were STILL not done! Take foil off and crisp top after it is all cooked.  #3  To make it simpler, a can of cream of chicken or mushroom soup with milk and sour cream will do in place of the roux, which is time consuming. #4  Cook the onions "with" the ground beef, no need to make it another step! #5  A full pound of beef is not necessary for this dish. (1/2 - 3/4 is plenty)! Following the recipe as is.... leaves you with a runny sauce in the end and nearly raw potatoes.

This was just great. Perfect for my meat a potato loving men in the house. It is like meaty scalloped potatoes.I followed the recipe as best as I could. Did not have cream, but using just extra milk worked fine. Leftovers this morning were delish. Bet it would freeze well. Thank you.

I really liked the idea of this recipe, but I changed it a whole lot. it sounded too rich and too expensive to make. You have to cover it with foil to get the potatoes done in a timely manner. 
I cooked the ground beef but used only 1/2 lb, with the onion, added 1/2 t seasoned salt and 1/8 t garlic powder. Added about 3/4 cup flour to this and then added 5 cups of milk and one cup of water.this I cooked into a "gravy". Layered into 9x13, sauce, then 1/8 head cabbage chopped, potatoes, sauce, 1/8 head chopped cabbage again, potatoes, sauce. added 2 c shredded cheddar on top, sprinkled with parsley. baked covered with foil 1 hr 25 minutes from cold oven (didn't preheat). then 20 minutes uncovered to brown.  I think I kept the original feel of the recipe but added more flavor and veggies by adding cabbage and seasoned salt and garlic. and lightened it a lot by using less meat and cheese and no cream and adding another veggie. also made it more economical priced.

The directions have been clarified. The milk and cream should be simmered for 10 minutes after it has been added to the roux.

This is a good recipe, albeit a greasy one.  Most likely due to the cheese itself.  I agree with other posters that 4 cups of cheese is a lot, but my family loves cheese, so I left it at 4 cups.  My only real complaint is that it took Forever to cook.  The potatoes just didn't want to get tender.  It took close to two hours to finish cooking.  This may have been due to my being in Denver and our weird altitude.  Other than that, between three adults and two kids, there was barely anything left in the pan!

With a little help this recipe is great. I added chilis, cayenne, cumin and worcestershire to my hamburger mixture and it turned out very flavorful. I also partially cooked my potatoes before slicing and putting in the oven.

Great Recipe. We all loved it.  I used a bag of shredded hashbrowns because I didn't have time to slice a bunch of potatoes (my food processor is packed away).  It still came out great.  Loved the white sauce in it.  I cooked the onions chopped in the ground beef, but layered everthing else according to directions.  Easy, delicious, and filling!

I did not care for this recipe. It sounded good, but the end result was uncooked potatoes, way-too-rich sauce, and no flavor. I actually tasted it, then put it back into the oven while I made something else to feed my husband. I tried it hours later, but the potatoes were still not cooked! I did not eat any, calling it a lesson learned. BEWARE.

My husband LOVED this and said it just got better as leftovers. I did use the evaporated milk instead of the heavy cream and I think that may be all I changed in the recipe. Microwaved and sliced the potatoes. I may use a little more beef next time as when the 1 lb cooked down there wasn't a lot there. Delicious though! This will definitely go into our rotation!

Not the healthiest recipe I've ever made - but EXCELLENT comfort food!  I followed the recipe fairly closely - here were my alterations:  I did NOT use the heavy cream, nor did I use the 1 extra cup of milk (just 3 cups of milk).  I also added the cheese to the sauce while it was still cooking (since this is what I do when making au gratin potatoes).  Lastly, I cooked it for 1 hour at 400 (again, like my au gratin potatoes) - covering with foil for the first 45 minutes.  Yummy.

Okay I made 2 casseroles, 1 I parboiled the potatoes and then sliced them with my Pampered Chef ultimate slice n grate and the other I just sliced it paper thin witht he slice and grate.  The y both came out at the same time and both were done!  I thinkyou just have to have them paper thin.  The Recipe was Fantastic, great with my left over turkey my family raved about it, one we added some hot peppers to for the adults, YUM!

Great recipe!!! USed my Pampered chef Ultimate slice and grate for the potatoes, they were paper thin. Recipe cooked in 45 minutes. Was thick and greamy nto sure why other user said watery I used whole milk and cream like recipe stated. Think the original person must have had mandolin for potatos or my Pampered chef thing. WILL MAKE AGAIN AND AGAIN! A real KEEPER> Just make sure potatos are s;ice paper thin.

I had high expectations for this recipe but was disappointed.  The sauce would not thicken and so I had to add corn starch, this took well over a 1/2 hour to get it to thicken.  The potatoes do have to be par-cooked before baking or they will be raw.  The sauce had a good flavor and the onions were great.  Not sure how to tweek it, or if I would even try.  I hope someone else has some ideas.

Made as listed the first time, and made again with some changes.  Original recipe lacked flavor.  Added some Worchestersire sauce, garlic, mushrooms and chopped hot pickled pepper rings.  Much improved.  I really enjoyed this recipe with the additions to boost the flavor.

I cooked it exactly to the recipe but I seasoned the hamburger as it was cooking

Took 2 hours to bake before the potatoes were cooked. Had to send the husband out to pick up a pizza for dinner.

I also had mixed feelings about this one... the prep time was more like an hour, after browing the beef and it taking so long for the sauce to thicken (I ended up adding 1/4c more flour and heating on med high).  No way was 1 pound of hamburger enough!  We like meat in our hotdishes, but even using 2.5 pounds was a bit skimpy for all the layers it calls for.  Even though very thinly sliced, the potatoes were not even close to done after about 70 minutes of cooking.  Maybe pre-cooking or covering with foil would have helped!  All this being said, I like the basic recipe, and with some tweaking and using some of the suggestions of others will try it again!

This was OUTSTANDING.  I pretty much made it as the recipe calls, but I did read the other reviews first.  I was very careful about the roux (white sauce) making sure that it thickened properly.  My family thought it was great.  The reviewer who described this as potatoes au gratin containing hamburger was rather accurate.  Very tasty.  Yes, I'll make it again.  It is a bit rich which is why it tastes so good, I suppose.

This turned out sooooooooo good!!! I am also from Albuquerque, New Mexico so I added the hot green chili like someone else said they did. I put 2 1/2 cups of milk, 1 can of cream of mushroom soup, and two scoops of sour cream. I used two pounds of Hamburger meat that I seasoned with pepper, garlic, salt, and the onions. My husband, and son loved it too. The next day after being in the fridge it was really good warmed up, and put in flour tortillas for burritoes. We want to make it again, and with the left overs add eggs for breakfast burritoes.

We loved this "comfort food."  We made a few amendments - we didn't have potatoes, so we used the frozen potato hashbrown squares instead.  We fried them up in veggie oil while making the white sauce, then just crumbled them into the layers as directed.  We loved the texture and flavor the hashbrowns gave it.  Also, we only had 1.5 cups of milk in the house, so we substituted half & half for the remaining amount of milk called for in the recipe.  This added a nice richness to the white sauce (along with the extra calories, so I would not prepare it this way all the time.)  If you are in the mood for comfort food, this meets the bill.  Not too time consuming, inexpensive, and (well...) comforting.

My husband and I both loved this. He is not big on leftovers and he ate it for lunch for 2 days! I made it as stated except I had some fresh mushrooms that I needed to use so I did a layer of those which I will do again. I also used some extra cheese and it was almost too much cheese. Next time I will just use the amount of cheese the recipe called for.
ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! I am so glad I tried this.

Not bad, but not necessarily worth the effort. This would have been so bland had I not highly seasoned the dish. I also lightened this up by using ground turkey, skim milk, fat free half and half and only two tablespoons of butter. I was able to cut back on the liquid by adding a "healthy" can of cream of chicken soup which gave it a nice flavor. I used my Pampered Chef mandolin to thinly slice my potatoes, but I still placed them in the microwave for fifteen minutes.

I enjoyed this dish.  I am going to add it to my "comfort food" recipes.  This dish reminded me of a Greek pasta dish called Pastitsio, which is ground beef and macaroni in a white sauce with just a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg.  After taking my first bite of this casserole, I sprinkled a little nutmeg over it and I had an Americanized version of Pastitsio.  I followed other suggestions of boiling the potatoes first and making extra sauce.  Thanks for the recipe.

Great recipe with lots of opportunities.  In addition to serving this casserole as a main meal I plan to change the hamburger to hot bulk sausage and serve as a side dish for a brunch or breakfast.   I used feta. cheddar and mozzarella cheese as that is what I had on hand.  I would cut back on the milk to 2 cups or maybe 2 1/2 next time.  A definite keeper, my husband and I both loved this recipe.  Thanks for sharing.

I made this exactly as the directions said and I did not really like this.  I thought it was too bland and just not very good.  I am giving it a three-star rating because my husband did like it but thought it needed something to give it a little more taste.  I doubt I would ever make this again because half the family liked it and half did not.

This was a HIT! But I did add some extras to it. I just added a few extra spices; TexJoy, garlic powder, few pepper flakes. 
I would NOT have tried this had I not just ordered a Pro Salad Shooter. I had 6 perfectly sliced up potatoes in less than 5 minutes! I used Butter Russets. I also added some french fried onions to the top over the last of the cheese. YUMMY!

This was AWESOME!!!! I made some slight adjustments, but pretty much followed the recipe!  I added some dry taco seasoning to the beef, added some more splashes of cream and milk to the sauce......and just used marble cheese.... It was divine!!! very hearty and filling.. my fiance and his son loved it! barley anything left afterwards...

I halved the recipe, but next time I should make full as it just made enough for me and hubby.  I used ground chicken.  I also made it all in my cast iron casserole dish to save on dirty pots.  I added clove or garlic.

My potatoes came out undercooked like some other reviewers had mentioned. I cooked it for 10 extra minutes but they were still more underdone than I would have preferred. My husband really liked this dish and even liked the texture of the undercooked potatoes. Next time I will probably add a half an hour to the cook time or pre-cook the potatoes a bit. Thanks for the recipe!

I actually had seconds of this recipe and my kids liked it but I will not be making it again. I made these changes: I sauted the meat first (with garlic, thyme, basil, and oregano) then I drained the excess fat and rederved it and sauted the onions in the same pan without wiping it and I did not add the oil. I then used the drippings from the beef in place of the butter. I also omitted the cream and used 1/2 cup sour cream, though I don't think it was needed. I cut the cheese down to 3 cups. Even with all these lower fat substitutions, it was still swimming in grease. Also it was a little bland. I know had my hubby been home to eat it he would have added hot sauce or something.   So overall, kind of bland and greasy. It served it's function for tonight, but I will not be making it again.

I would have given this reciepe 5 stars because I thought it was great, but hubby didn't like it.  He didn't finish his surving which is unlike him.  I should have cooked it longer though because the potatoes were not cooked all the way.  Unfortunately I will not be making this again because it was not well recieved:(

This was good, but I will be adding more meat and some green chiles( I am from New Mexico!!haha) next time! It was also stuck to the pan really bad! It took me 2 days to get it clean. I think I will try Pam next time to make sure I don't have the same problem!

They need to add directions stating that after adding the 3 cups milk it needs to be stirred until it simmers and then simmer until thickened.  I think that is why so many people are saying it is watery, mine came out the same way.  I was going to thicken it up but thought I had better follow the directions which say to gradually add the milk, add the cream and then remove from heat.  Nice flavor (I seasoned the meat with goya adobo) so I might try it again.

Both my husband and I thought this dish was good. He actually said it was delicious and he had it the next night after I made it. So still good warmed up. I am vegetarian so instead of hamburger meat I used MorningStar Farm griller crumbles. I sauteed the onions with the crumbles. I mixed in a can of sliced carrots before adding to casserole. I used 3cups fat free milk and a half cup of sour cream. I put in less cheese as well and used mrs. dash all purpose seasonings in the sauce instead of adding salt and pepper.

If I were the only one reviewing it, I would have given it a big "no thanks!!" but my kids seemed to like it, 2 of them even asking for seconds.  It needed way longer cooking time and was still too watery when served.  I agree with many previous reviewers that it was bland so I had to add some garlic salt at the table.  Not planning on making it again.

I followed the recipe exactly and the potatoes were not cooked and slightly crisp. The amount of hamburger seems too little for this size pan and lacks flavor. We basically tasted cheese and cream. Very rich and not enough flavor for my family.

I think 4 cups of milk/cream are wayyyy too much for a measly 1/4C flour roux.  Very, very runny.  The cheese cooked down into unappetizing, grainy lumps.  Biggest flavor of this dish was *greasy*.  With some changes, the potato/beef/cheese combo could be good.  We added peas to our casserole.

well i can say i am certanly going to try more dishes based on ingrediants and my prefernce instead of the amount of reviews and ratings.  this was so great!  i followed pretty much the same except doubled the sauce and added the onion when i browned the meat.  i too pre-boiled the potatoes as someone else suggested and it is a must...it then still took much longer in the oven.  next time i'm going to boil them almost completely done before slicing.  Still great flavor, oh yea, i didn't add the jack cheese, didn't have any and probably won't add next time either.
Thanks for a fab way to use left over hamburger!!

This recipe took FAR too long to prepare than what it was worth. If someone else decides to make it, the tip to make sure the potatoes are sliced thin means THIN.  I mean, you can see through the potato THIN.  I left this in for over an hour and even though the slices were thin, they still didn't get done.  The sauce was good.

Mind you, I'm a newish cook, but I made this exactly to spec and it turned out to be not very good. I ate the whole thing, both hot out of the oven, and as leftovers.I think the main problem was the sauce; I'm not sure what the goal was, but it turned out partly curdled and watery for me. The recipe should remind people to use thinly-sliced potatoes; some thicker slices in my version didn't cook well.

Followed the recipe pretty closely, only adding some celery to the meat mix.  I had noted people said it needed more time to bake, so I extended the baking time to a little over an hour.  The result was very watery and the potatoes were still crispy.  Had to throw most of it away and I'm not likely to try this again.  It didn't even taste good.

This recipe is absolutely delicious!!! I did have to add considerably more flour to thicken the sauce.  I also probably doubled the cheddar cheese per our taste.  You could add almost anything you like and it would taste great.  My daughter added sour cream to hers and loved it.  My husband is a no nonsense meat, potatoes and vegetable man and he ate 3 large helpings.  THANKS!!

I made this to recipe except adding smoked paprika and garlic powder to the cream sauce/roux. I liked it, but my husband ate 3 helpings stating “ I can’t stay outta this stuff!!.” That makes it a winner in my book!!

Family all loved this. Very basic but good food. Took a bit longer to back, but my oven may be a bit off. Didn't make any variations this time, but will do the banana peppers in the future. Paired this with some southwest style veggies and some Franks Hot Sauce. Really spiced things up.

Everyone really enjoyed it. Can be versatile with adding or changing up ingredients. I did parboil the potatoes to make sure they would be done and reduced my baking time. Having prior knowledge of cooking with a roux is helpful, makes me wonder if others who had poor results did not know how to make a roux. Should be listed as at least 4.5 stars to 5?

I have made this one twice now. The whole family loves it, even my picky 10 year old! Made no changes except added green chiles to the hamburger. I also just combined hamburger and onions, one less step. Delish! Oh, and I never end up needing the last cup of milk.

I made this last night for the first time.  Followed recipe exactly, but did find that I needed more flour to make the roux as thick as I like it.  Didn't have heavy cream, so I used half and half, which didn't seem to affect the outcome.  We really liked this recipe and will make it again.  Thanks for sharing!

Awesome! I had left over roasted potatoes that we made on the grill with steak the night before.  We cubed potatoes, added butter, garlic, onion and a few spices and had a lot leftover--this was a perfect way to use them.  The potatoes already had some flavor and they were cooked.  I added a layer of corn and  used half milk, half heavy cream.  Also used one pound of hamburger and 1/2 pound of Italian sausage.  This was very yummy!!!

Great recipe with a few additions. From advice of others, added Worcester Sauce, Chipotle Sauce, and garlic to the meat for some kick. Used a half cup of flour for a thicker "roux", which ended up needing more butter, milk, heavy cream and a cup of sour cream to get the constancy right (like runny mashed potatoes.) Constant stirring is the key until it is smooth and turns a light brown.  Also added cumin, celery salt, and a dash or two of cayenne pepper. The meat layer was very thin so I'll probably double the meat next time. Cut the raw potatoes at 1/8 inch to less and they came out fine in 50 minutes of baking. All in all, a very good meal.

My family who is particular about food liked it!  Yeah!   Yes, it is very high in fat.   I did add a mix of some cottage cheese/milk pureed together to boost the protein.    To the ground beef, I added the Worcestershire, garlic powder, some cayenne pepper as other users mentioned.   I'd like to try with finely cut spinach to add veggies for my picky family.    Would like to try w/sharp cheese -- I used my 4 cheese mix from Costco.    It's a great base to springboard & try variations.  THANKS!

I tried this recipe but used instant mashed potatoes, seasoned hamburger, bacon, and velveeta. I cooked the burger and potatoes, combined them and spread it into a 9x13 sized pan. Then added crumbled pieces of bacon and topped with velveeta. I then baked it for about 20 minutes at 350. It was great! Even the picky eater cleaned his plate ;) Very good quick meal!

This was very good!  I just mixed some green bell pepper and onion in with the ground beef while it was frying, and it turned out good!  I used frozen tater tots, but make sure you bake them before you use them in the casserole, or it'll never get done!  Will make this again.

This was a great meal that 3 of 4 kids loved!! The one kid only likes Mac and Cheese!! I did use Lipton Soup mix instead of the onions cause my whole family hates onions mainly my wife!! I also cooked it at 340 for 1 hour to get the potatoes perfect and they were!! I did not change any of the other ingredients this is a must try!!!

I followed this recipe exactly (I always do that first) but this was blah, and heavy, and the cheese/milk almost seemed curdled with hamburger and potatoes.  Basically it tasted like scalloped potatoes with hamburger thrown in but something bad happened along the way. I will not try to modify this one at all.

very tasty indeed! i made a few changes to the recipe. instead of 3cups of milk i used 1/2 cup and 1 10oz can of cream of mushroom soup. i also layered the bottom of the baking dish with 1can of pillsbury dinner croissants(found in the frozen section of your grocery store) rolls and flattened them. then i layered the ingredients according to recipe. i also skipped seasoning the cream instead i seasoned my hamburger meat with a little taco seasoning and chili powder. it turned out fantastic!!! oh and yes make sure you boil your potatoes first

This was really delicious. I followed the directions exactly and the only thing I had to change was how long I left it in the oven. I added an extra 20 minutes because the potatoes were too hard as some of the other reviewers said. But other than that it was perfect, my family loved it.

I made this last night and really didn't like it at all.  Even with lightening up the recipe as per another reviewer, I thought it was too rich.  I also was not able to get the roue to gel and got lots of little flour clumps.  I probably won't make this again.

This was pretty bland, especially considering I seasoned along the way. I was expecting it to be similar to Scalloped potatoes and onions from this site (that one has no cheese though) and prepared the potatoes similarly. My kids did like it, it just wasn't worth all the preparation steps to keep making it. It wasn't difficult, just time consuming.

Definate hit!  I did use the ideas of other reviewers to reduce calories.  One time I used cream of chicken soup instead of heavy cream the other time I used 1/2 cup sour cream.  Both were good.  I sprinkled each layer with garlic powder and sprinkled the top with oregano.  It made the "make again list".

This was a very good recipe! I had everything around the house already so I decided to try it out. I changed a couple of things though. Instead of using milk and heavy cream I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and one cup of prepared chicken broth. This gave the recipe some extra flavor. I also added some Mrs.Dash and Lowry's seasoning salt. I cut back on the cheese a bit too but it still turned out great!

I have mixed feelings with this one. Very rich indeed......not sure if I did something wrong, but ours came out too soupy.  I ended up cooking a bit more hamburger and some hashbrown potatoes to add to it.  So now we have tons leftover, haha!  I would definitely like to try it again, but maybe next time use less milk and cream for the amount of meat and potatoes it calls for.  I also added season salt and garlic powder to the sauce. I think the hasbrown potatoes work better too unless you cut your potatoes super thin.

This recipe was a good starting point for what I was craving. I microwaved my sliced potatoes for 10 minutes, made a cheesey cream sauce (using Velveeta), topped it all off with about a 2 cups of cheddar. We all really liked it, especially my 2 and 6 year olds!

Was very good and rich.  Although the sliced potatoes took an extra 30 minutes before they were done.  I'd like to try hashbrowns or diced potatoes next time.  Otherwise, very good!!!

Bland, Bland, Bland! I cooked this recipe exactly as listed. I pre-boiled the potatoes whole like reveiwers stated. I cut them into some cubes. I cooked it for one hour. The potatoes were done but very bland. I should of added some spices or something. My end product was not ruiny but I was afraid it would be. The leftovers were not that great either. My boyfriend really liked it (so I gave it two stars), however, I will not make again. I was very disappointed for a four star meal.

This is good old comfort food - we liked it!  I substituted fat free half and half instead of heavy cream - not so fattening and still tasted good!  I will make this again.  Thanks!

This recipe turned out good but took far to long to prepare and it's definitely not low in fat.

The prep time was a tad long, but the recipe turned out great. I will probably add less of the sauce and more cheese next time, but I'm a cheese hound. Thanks for sharing!

Good casserole right out of the oven; better casserole leftover after the flavors blend.

My family loved this dish.  I DID use 1% milk in place of both the milk and the heavy cream.  The dish was delicious.
