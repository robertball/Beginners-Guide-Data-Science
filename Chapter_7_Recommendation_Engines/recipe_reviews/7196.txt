I have used this recipe for the past 5 years and have never benn disappointed. It is simple, easy and best of all tasty. No one believes that it is made with instant potatoes. I am extending the tradition by teaching all of my children, nieces and nefews how to bake thes delicious tradiditonal breads. Thanks for the recipe.

I just wanted to add that it's great with cream cheese spread on it before you add sliced ham/turkey/etc.

My Grandma always made lefse when i was growing up. My brother and I wanted to make it for Thanksgiving this year for our families. We are new at this, but this recipe made it very simple. Looked and tasted just like i remember Grandma's. 
I used butter instead of shortening, which seemed to work fine. I also want to note that i was surprised how easy it was to mix the flour in with the pastry cutter.

I cheat and make lefse using instant potatoes.  Most recipes start with riced cooked potatoes, but this is much quicker.  Very good at Thanksgiving, where you can stuff with leftover turkey, dressing & sometimes cranberries.

This turned out great!!! We did it as a test to an old recipe we had been using. We did reduce the flour to 2 c. and the taste was the best we have ever made. Thanks for sharing. :)
