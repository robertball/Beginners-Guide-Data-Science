Excellent, excellent. I wouldn't change anything, the dressing is perfect. But I might add a few shrimp - and I did. ;) Thanks for the recipe!!

What a great lunch!!!

I used about a 1/2 cup of fresh chopped  from my garden, cilantro.  I used 6 large leaves of basil from my garden.  I used 2 pitted jalapenos, and 2 pitted banana peppers, all from my garden.  I also used rinsed black beans, and LaChoy Chowmein noodles.

Thanks again!  will have this at least once a week!

Great Recipe!!!

This recipe sounded like it was something right up my alley.  I never met a veggie I didn't like and I do like jicama but the combo of these flavors...I don't know what it was, I just really didn't like it. Maybe my pineapple wasn't sweet enough or used too much cilantro...sorry.

This was AWESOME!!!!  I used 1 pepper cuz I'm a wimp & about 1/3 of a "bunch" of cilantro cuz I'm impatient.  Other than that I stayed true to the recipe.  I will definitely make it again.  Woops!  I forgot to add avacado at the end...

My very favourite salad recipe.  The peppers add a nice bite but don't overpower.  I've also made it without the peppers when serving to kids.  I made them for my son's birthday and a couple of years later, people still mention it!  Very light and refreshing.. it's the only time I've seen people going back for second and thirds of the salad instead of the items!

This is so good.  I couldn't find Jicama and used an asian pear instead.  Perfect substitute for texture and probably better flavor.  Will make this again, for sure.

This is one of the best recipes I've taken a chance on.  I left out the peppers just because I wasn't looking for spicy this night.  Didn't miss it at all!  The salad was so crisp and fresh.  The sweet and tart together was FABULOUS!  Like another reviewer, I sauteed some shrimp to increase the protein.  I substituted red wine vinegar for the rice vinegar and halved the recipe.  I didn't end up with much "dressing" to drizzle on top so I used a very small amount of balsamic vinaigrette over top of the salad (maybe 1TB, probably a little less).  It didn't affect the flavor, just gave it more of a coating.  I will definitely be making this again.

This salad is simple yet very tasty. The pineapple can also be substituted by mango.

I expected to love this recipe.  I may consider trying it one more time but will substitute canola oil for the olive oil because I thought the olive oil completely overpowered the lime and cilantro flavors.  I'll probably add some lime zest to it as well.  My family wouldn't even finish eating their portions. : (

I followed the recipe exactly and it went over very well. I made it as a salad for Easter dinner and everyone that tried it liked the freshness & the textures of it. I liked that the heat kind of crept up in my mouth & didn't slap me in the face. I could distinctly taste all of the flavors. Very good & nice to try something new.

This is unusual, but works very well. The store did not have jicama, so I subsituted a peeled, julienned Granny Smith apple. This was fun to make. I almost bailed on the fresh pineapple, planning to use canned, but bought one anyway and used it. I described this recipe on a radio show last night while the hosts enjoyed it. They voted it tops!

I omitted the serrano peppers as I had very young eaters at the table; however, I did put in a pinch of chili powder so there would be at least a little spice.  We really liked the overall flavor and texture. (My husband is NOT a veggie guy.)  I suggest keeping the avocado on the side as not everyone cares for it, and it turns brown and gets mushy if you end up with leftovers.  Also, I used grapeseed oil, and it worked nicely.

This salad is wonderful. I have made it several times now, and have been making double batches (not double the lettuce or avo) so that I could have more jicama/pineapple leftovers!! The only change that I made was to substitute Anaheim peppers for the seranos, I love spicy, but not everyone in my family does. Anaheims have great flavor without 'burning' anyone's throat

I knew my guests wouldn't like the hot pepper in this salad so I substituted 1 tsp. of Mrs. Dash salt free Fiesta Lime shake.  I also added honey, about 3 tbs. and about a quarter of a red onion chopped fine to add a little kick and color.

WOW this was sooo good. Used 1 serrano pepper, 1/2 bunch cilantro, and diced jicama and pineapple a bit smaller so they would be easier to get in the mouth.

This is a nice, refreshing recipe.  I served it topped with grilled chicken.  I also only used one serrano pepper and it still had plenty of kick.

This recipe has potential I guess.  It was very bland to me.  I always exaggerate the spices whenever I first cook a recipe. (Nothing ever has enough garlic or spice etc.)  Even so, it was tasteless.  I will give it one more try...

I had my doubts about the dressing as it seemed too bland before it all got together, but the end product was phenomenal. My roommate and I devoured every bite. I doubled the lime juice, which I often do in sauces that call for lime, and that really did the trick.

Made it a couple of times now, it gets very high raves when I bring to meetings!! It has several of my favorite foods in it: cilantro, jicama, shrimp, avacado & now dried cranberries. I added about a 1/2 cup  for color & it brought it to a whole new level!! I highly recommend trying it!

This is a great, fun recipe. The one change that really steps it up is to grill the peppers, pineapple and jicama just long enough to get grill marks.  The jicama should be a slab, then slice across the grill marks for an interesting presentation.  The quick grill also kicks up the sugars in the pineapple!

This salad is a great summertime treat and seems like it would go with many main dishes.  I didn't have Serrano peppers, so I used one finely-minced fresh jalapeño pepper, and that worked well. Next time I would cut the salt in half.  I plan to try adding shrimp to use it as a main-dish salad, too.

I served this with a southwest marinated pork tenderloin, was a perfect combination.  As a side dish, this could probably serve 8 people - I don't know if I had an unusually large jicama or something, but this made a LOT of salad!

This was super fast & easy to assemble and very refreshing on a hot summer day.  The only change I made was to dice the jicama.  Will definitely try this again (and with shrimp as suggested by some other reviewers).

I had to modify recipe as I didn't know my peppers and ended up with a caynenne pepper so I used 1/4 of the amount called for since it is hotter than a serrano pepper and substituted granny smith apples for the jicama which was unavailable at the store.  It was pretty good, but I won't give 5 stars unless it is out of this world.

Excellent, if you add shrimp (which is delicious) take it out before refrigerating any leftovers.

This was very refreshing and great for summer.  I forgot the Jicama but it was yummy anyways.  Simple but looks fancy...and original.  Guests love it.
