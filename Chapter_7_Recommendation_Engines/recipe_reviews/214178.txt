This recipe is perfect when you want something quick and easy but with lots of flavor.  The browned tofu is delicious in the recipe.  I use light coconut milk instead of the regular when I make it.  We have made this recipe many times.  I will try it with my own sauce sometime too but it is nice to have the ready made sauce too when you need something quick!

Quick, painless and tasty! If only tofu came pre-drained, this would be ready in a matter of minutes. I just made a similar recipe with tofu and curry ... http://bit.ly/giE0r5

I did not have prepared curry sauce, so I whipped some of my own up while the onions and peppers were cooking.  Overall, my husband and I enjoyed the recipe and we will almost definitely make a variation on it again.  I think to suit our tastes we would prefer more onions and peppers, and a bit less tofu.  Still, it all came together very nicely and we had dinner ready in less than 30 minutes! That's always a plus.
