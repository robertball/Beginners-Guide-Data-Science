Okay, I didn't really understand this hot chocolate recipe. I thought it was going to be something different because of the name. It was just hot chocolate. Plus, I have no idea why but the marshmallows I used would not melt. Maybe, the marshmallows need to be "homemade" like the submitter suggested using. That may have given it a differen texture. I normally use recipes where I can make a mix ahead of time of making the cocoa. This one requires sitting over a stove and watching it. There is nothing wrong with it, but it's just cocoa. It's not creamy or special. I made 3 servings using the calculate button. It all fit in a small pot and I am sure it will all dissapear with some whipped topping or some other fancy addition. One day, should I come across homemade marshmallows, I may try it again.

I'm sure homemade marshmallows would be great in this but I didn't have any and my daughter was wanting something chocolate-y that she could make so we used store bought. It was a tasty hot chocolate. My little one got a bit creative and subbed Theo Chipotle spice Sipping Chocolate for the chocolate chips. She's such a smarty :) It was fantastic with that. Would have been good with just the reg. Choco chips too but yum with the Chipotle!

I think this recipe turned out pretty good. It wasn’t too sweet and you could definitely taste the chocolate. I used normal sized marshmallows and they took like 15 minutes to melt. So I would say don’t use giant marshmallows. The vanilla extract I would not add in again because it didn’t really mix in well. It just sort of floated on the top. It didn’t really add much of a taste difference.

It was a *mess*.... Tried making this for me and the hubby to have when he got home from work, and it was a disaster. :c The marshmallows wouldn't melt at all, probably because they're not homemade. The only difference I made was I used Andes Mint Chips instead of chocolate chips because those are the only ones I have around.
