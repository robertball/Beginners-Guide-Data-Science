I made this during a family party and everyone loved it! But I changed instead of the coffee on the top, i add a cup of coffee to the rest of the batter.

This went very well! I did not use instant coffee and I made this in a bundt pan. After 35 minutes, I used a mixture of coffee, cinnamon, nutmeg, ground cloves, melted butter, milk, and confectioners sugar and poured it over the top. It took another 25 minutes to finish baking. After I flipped it, I sifted the same cinnamon/nutmeg/cloves/sugar mixture over the top of the cake. The bottom had caramelized. It was moist, just the right amount of sweetness and had a perfect flavor. Will definitely be making again!

Good recipe.  I followed it exactly and thought it was really flavorful.  I topped mine with a coffee glaze which really made it full of coffee flavor!

Good, light flavor. I followed the recipe as written and was happy with the results.
