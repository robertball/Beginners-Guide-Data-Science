Beautiful milkshake! I love the extra added flavor of vanilla which is what sets this apart from the ordinary Oreo milkshakes. I used homemade vanilla ice cream and we added fresh whip on top!

I loved it!!! The kids had a blast making it. I added more ice cream and a little more vanilla extract and we topped it off with chocolate syrup and it was perfect.

So yummy! I like my shakes on the thicker side so I cut the milk portion in half and added a cup of ice in my blender as well. Tasted even better when I threw in a banana!

I used two scoops of cookies and cream ice cream. I only used 1/2 cup milk, and that was plenty. It made 1 serving for me. The added vanilla extract did give it more vanilla flavor.

The only thing wrong..... not thick enough.  Tastes awesome.   I did everything to try to make this a thick milkshake.  Help!  Where did I go wrong? I added more ice cream, more oreos, less than half a cup of ice and half a cup of Fat Free Milk. Boo!  Was it the fat free milk???

I prefer my shakes thicker so I had to change it up by putting less milk one more Oreo and more ice cream.

Great Recipe, simple and quick. I made a double serving for my kids and they loved it. The only thing I would do differently next time is A) use a different blender because my Ninja was too strong or B) use just a little less milk. I had to add a little extra ice cream to make it a little thicker, but a great recipe! Thanks for sharing.

I thought the taste wad good,  but it definitely need to be thicker. I would pump up the ice cream,  and add less milk.  I topped mine off with some chocolate syrup.

Mine turned out more like the consistency of the milk. I think I will try either using only half of the milk or double the ice cream next time.
