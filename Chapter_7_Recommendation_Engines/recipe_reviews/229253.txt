Easy and quick but more to the point - delicious! Everyone had seconds, and believe me, that is huge in my family!  I didn't use the parsnip only because I forgot to buy some - soup was still plenty tasteful. There is no salt added to this recipe so if you are watching your sodium, this soup is plenty flavorful as is!

I tried one similar to this one in a crock pot but the parsnips made the soup taste sour.  Never make this one in a crock pot.  My grandmother used to do a similar one using beef soup bones and we skimmed off the scum as it cooked.  She always made homemade noodles.

I found this recipe to be incredibly bland. I had to make so many alterations to the recipe that it was basically a new one.

Similar recipe passed down in our Hungarian family with a few changes.  We never used parsnip but  root parsley or if unavailable, several sprigs of regular parsley.  Also we add 1 peeled kohlrabi or 1/4 cabbage.  Caution with the number of carrots or the soup will be too sweet.  We included 2  stalks of celery (whole), 1 whole tomato, 1 green pepper - seeded, 1 whole onion and 3 cloves of garlic. 

 We also discovered that even the type of stockpot will make a difference.  Enamel works best. 

 Cook the chicken for an hour and then add the vegies for the second hour.  Also, once it's brought to a boil, turn to simmer.  You don't want it to boil too long or this will result in a cloudy soup.  It should be as clear as possible.
Agreed, do not cook noodles or even reheat with soup.  Do them separately.  Best with homemade noodles.

Strain soup once it's done, and serve the chicken, carrots and celery as a second course.

This is A really Good soup. The only thing is did different was
Sautee carrots, chicken celery in butter. 
Threw in Chicken broth with 2 cubes of Bullion. 
Add Milk in Towards the end. Perfect.
