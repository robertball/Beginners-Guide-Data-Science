A little to sweet for my taste.  Very overwhelming balsamic flavor.

This was good. I served it over a warm noodle salad with tomato and cucumber. Will make again.

I use this for everything, but it is perfect for a short-grained brown rice salad. I make it in the summer as an alternative to a mayonnaise based side. I add to cooled rice dried cranberries, celery, diced red pepper, scallions, and chopped parsley...sometimes I throw in nuts or raisins if they are around and then very lightly dress it with the curry vinaigrette and then add more just before serving. Thanks for this versatile recipe!

This dressing is wonderful over roasted root vegetables and/or rice.  It stays well in a refrigerator for a few weeks.  Highly recommend it!
