This deserves a big WOW!  Made this last night using a good quality hot italian sausage, basmati rice and fresh mint from my garden.  Didn't have any milk or yogurt on hand, so I used sour cream instead.  Since it was just me, I cut up just one acorn squash, then used all the stuffing to over stuff both halves.  Cooking time took a little longer than expected, but that may just be my oven, or possibly because they were overstuffed (the top of the acorn squash was completely covered in sausage).  Don't make the mistake of under cooking... you will know when they are done by the incredible aroma that fills your home.  Do NOT skip the cinnamon and mint.  The combination of hot sausage, spices, sweet acorn squash and long cooking time turned this into a mildly hot, incredibly flavorful meal all by itself.

Don't leave out the cinnamon.  I am a long time fan of Chef John and this is my new favorite.  I made a few changes, but only because of what I had on hand.  I used hot Italian sausage, omitted salt and pepper,  omitted mint and buttermilk (didn't have any) used green bell pepper, added one minced scallion (otherwise would have thrown it away), added some fresh thyme leaves from my sister's garden and increased total baking time to 2 hours because my squash was large.

Good stuff. I'll be making this again soon. I couldn't find any lamb sausage in my town, so I used spicy Italian Pork sausage instead. I also found out you can eat the skin of the squash. It wasn't bad.

This is really declicious and the portions were perfect--exactly enough stuffing to fill four acorn squash halves.  It was a little too dry for my taste, so the next time I would leave it covered longer, and uncovered just a few minutes.

Very unique and full of flavors!  Next time I will use Italian Sausage vs ground beef for more spice. (I browned the beef before mixing with other ingredients and added some ground assagio cheese into mixture too.)

I baked covered. Careful not to dry out your dish. Drissle some oil!

Deliscious!

Great recipe. I used seasoned chicken sausage and ommitted the cheese and breadcrumbs and added a little extra from the recipe and the flavor was great. this will make an amazing holiday casserole. Thanks for the recipe!

This was absolutely delicious! This recipe is healthier than others that call for a lot of cheese. The video made it easy to show prep. Next time I will try sausage and complementary herbs instead of lamb and mint. My husband likes lamb much more than I do. It's also a beautiful looking dish. Thank you Chef John!

Delicious!  True comfort food during dark days of winter. Smelled great while it was cooking and so delicious.

My acorn squash took 2 1/2 hours to cook! I should have listened to my instincts and pre-cooked the squash halves in the microwave for 10 minutes or so before roasting.

Outstanding, loved every bite. ChefJohn is the best.  (My guest found the mixture a little dry and suggested leaving out the egg.)
