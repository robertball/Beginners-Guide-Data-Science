I'm afraid the corn bread mix makes for a bit of an odd aftertaste...These were very pretty and moist, I just need to figure out how to fix the flavor a bit.  I got pumpkin on sale so I'm going to experiment!  I didn't add the raisins, just the pineapple, and followed the recipe to a T otherwise.

Yummy and moist!! I omitted the raisins because I didn't have any, but everything else on the ingredient list was in my cupboard, and it was fast and easy to do. I was a little nervous about the texture with the corn bread mix, but it was very good. Will definately do again!

wanted something using pineapple and pumpkin decided to try it had all ingredients.  not sure I will make again. I like cornbread, and use jiffy, but gritty leaves more to be desired.  moist muffins but different aftertaste. I followed recipe used raisins and did soak raisins for 10 minutes so they were softer.  there is a pumpkin oatmeal recipe out there will try that next time.

Ok, not even sure if it counts as the same recipe. I used poking pie mix instead plain pumpkin. I didn't have any cornmeal so I just chopped up some oats. Then added chocolate chips for good measure. They taste more like a dessert, but they aren't bad.

These were so easy and delicious! I served them with pumpkin ice cream and drizzled caramel over the dessert.  I only used the pineapple and they were so moist!
