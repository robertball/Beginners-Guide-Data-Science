I love traditional cilantro cream sauce made with sour cream so I thought this lighter version would be a great option. Unfortunately we did not like it at all. The combination of the Greek yogurt and lime juice was extremely tangy. The recipe does not give a specific measurement for the lime juice so it could be that my lime produced more juice than was intended for the recipe. I think I would prefer light sour cream to the Greek yogurt.
