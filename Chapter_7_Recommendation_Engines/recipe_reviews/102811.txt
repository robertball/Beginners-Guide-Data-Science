This is something I'd make again, but definitley change a few things. I definitley wouldn't put the items in the food processor for a whole minute each time. It ended up like baby food. I may just hit the pulse button until it looks well mixed. Also, I agree with not adding as much flour. To me (and my husband noticed once I said it) it tasted a little bit floury. Lastly, I may just add more spices to give it a bit more flavor. My husband said the flavor was good, but I think it needs a bit more. I"ll try it again though!

I did not use the same cheeses listed here - I used what I had on hand: some parmesan and some reduced fat cheddar - probably close to 1 1/2 or 2 cups.  I mixed by hand and shredded by zucchini on a box grater.  It was tasty - maybe a bit dense and dry, but still good.  I might reduce the flour a bit.

This was pretty good.  I did however make a couple changes.  I make quiche about twice a month so this is not a new menu item for us but adding zucchini to and making it without a crust was!  I only gave it 4 stars ONLY because I altered the recipe based on other reviews.  I reduced the flour to just over 1/2 cup (I rarely measure) and added the a variety of cheeses to include the feta and parmesan as well as Mozerella as well as some white cheddar.  I did add a full small onion that I chopped (not grated) and I used 2 yellow squash and 1 zucchini as that is what I had on hand.  I also added italian seasoning, black pepper, a small amount of salt and a LOT of dried parsley...Again...i dont measure.  I just eyeballed it all based on the reviews and the recipe as well and our our tastes.  I did add 4 eggs and a small amount of milk.  Typically when I make quiche I use mayo in it (thus i dont use but 3-4 eggs since it has eggs) but I decided to just up the cheese just for this recipe...it was already filling my pan up quick!  It looks great now and smells great!  Cant wait to eat!  Bread finishing in oven and salad ready!  Yum Yum!  Hubby wanted a bit less bread (therefore no crust was GREAT!)  Thanks for recipe !!!! :)

Super easy recipe.  We didn't have Crisco or anything and lined the dish with unsalted butter and a quick canola oil spray, which worked fine.  We used 1/2 med. white onion, which was plenty for us.  I recommend omitting the salt.

Delicious. I used 1/2 flour, 3 eggs and substituted the other 2 eggs with egg beaters. I also shredded the zucchini and blotted out some of the liquid and totally skipped the food processing step. Left in the oven about 50 minutes. It was yummy!

This recipe worked really well for us as a main course with a salad on the side.  I substituted assorted cheese ends I had purchased at a discount for the cheese in the recipe and it turned out great!

I baked this quiche with the following modifications: omitted salt, reduced flour to 1/2c, replaced mozarella with 1c sharp cheddar, added 1/c ham. It baked in 50 minutes. Tastes very good.

Delicious zucchini quiche.  I followed the recipe exactly, except it only took 45 min. instead of 1 hour.  Probably because I have a large quiche dish and it was thin.  My husband had the leftover quiche for breakfast and loved it.  However, I have another zucchini quiche recipe that has bacon in it and I like it slightly better.

I've used this recipe several times and varied what I added - sometimes leftover veges or potatoes. I use just 2/3 c flour - makes it less bready. I didn't add much salt- the cheeses give plenty of flavor.

Great recipe and very easy to make.  I eliminated the flour and baked it for only 45 min.  Everything chopped no need for a food processor.

I made a few changes and it was very good. I only used 3/4 cup of flour and used cheddar cheese. I would definitely pulse it in a food processor, so it was a little chunkier,

This recipe is great - except that I modified the heck out of it.  I didn't put in any flour or baking powder and I didn't put it in the food processor.  (My family is all from the French countryside, where food processors are a bit blasphemous.)  Oh, and I also used shredded cilegne mozzarella instead of shredded mozzarella.  But I know it's good because my roommate, who's studying for the GRE and hates everyone and everything at the moment, likes it.  So there you go.

This recipe is amazing - just know that it took over an hour for this to cook.  However, my oven is weak, so take that into consideration.

My kids are really picky eaters- they gobbled this quiche up.  I did not have the mozzarella  on hand so I used two baby bell and topped with 1/2 cup of cheddar.

Great recipe which I have used a few times. This last time I also added half a can of corn kernels which was really nice. I have found that my quiche pan is too small for this amount of mixture so I now use a baking pan like for lasagne. This works well and there is no overflow spillage.

Like other reviewers, I used this recipe to create my own crustless quiche!  I made it more traditionally by using eggs and 2 cups half and half, 1 cup shredded cheddar instead of the parm and feta cheese, and used the chopped veggies it called for.  I also added about 1/2 cup flour in case the zucchini and red pepper added too much extra moisture.  I cooked it in a square stone baking pan for about 45 min.  It came out perfect!

I thought this was very good. I made slight changes. I did not use a food processor at all. I used a standard box grater to shred the zucchini. I used two. I omitted the feta cheese because I didn't have any. I only used a half cup of flour because other reviewers had mentioned a floury taste. I also chopped up a few slices of deli ham and threw that in.  I omitted the salt.

I think this quiche would be very enjoyable at any time of day. I'm always looking for ways to add more vegetables and less meat to our diet. And I think this recipe is a big improvement over the standard "bacon and egg breakfast". I was very happy with this recipe.  I think it's very easy to add what you may have on hand.  It would also be great for brunch. Or, maybe bake this is a muffin pan for good grab and go breakfasts.  

It was easy to make, and easy on the budget. By the way, it browns nicely. Very presentable! Thanks so much for the recipe.

I totally changed this up. I sauteed onions, garlic, and red peppers. then i sauteed two sliced zucchini until only partly done;  i had tried to squeeze out any water from the zucchini before sauteeing it. i used Romano and asiago cheeses in it. For last 20 min i melted cheddar on the top. i added fresh basil to the batter, used about 1/3 cup of flour (or less) and added smoked bratwurst sausage, cut up in small cubes. i added a bit of cream and a tiny bit of milk. I did not use feta, parsley or mozzrella, It was fantastic!

I did make quite a few changes after reading all the reviews. While getting out my zucchini....... why waste the other veggies?? So i also added tomatoes, mushrooms, broccoli, peppers.  I only used 1/2 cup flour and added some milk to be sure if wasn't too "bready".  We enjoyed it and would make again, but....... why bother with the food processor?? Other than using it for the onion,  everything else I hand chopped and stirred in the bowl.

I made it exactly as written. We liked it but it was a bit too salty for our tastes. Will make again but will cut down the amount of cheese used

This turned out fine and the taste was OK. I had to take mine out at 50 minutes; it was definitely starting to look done. Maybe I'm just more of a fan of regular quiche, as I thought this was just a bit dry tasting. The only change I made was that I didn't have enough feta, so I added more mozzarella in its place.

I adjusted a few things... instead of mozzarella, I added shredded mexican cheese that we had in the fridge from taco night.  Used 1 zucchini and 1 yellow squash... each about 9 inches long (not sure if that's considered small or medium size).  Used 1/2 cup flour.  Didn't use a food processor, just stirred it in the bowl with a fork.  I did mix up the eggs in a separate bowl before adding it to the zucchini.  Baked for 50 minutes in a ceramic pie plate.  I think 1 hr would be too long and it may dry out.  Read the reviews and you'll see most people didn't bake it for a hr.  and many adjusted the flour amount.  Sounds like you can add anything to this and it won't hurt it.  I'd like to add spinach to the next batch.  Will cut it up small before adding it in.
Love the flavors of the feta, parmesan and mexican cheese baked together.  Enjoy!

We didn't really like this much. I couldn't get my kids to eat it and that was without them knowing zucchini was inside.  Something about the texture was just off.  I have a KitchenAid food processor and I literally processed it for 5-8 seconds rather than the 1 min/per step as recommended.  It still came out so processed that it looked like baby food.  Don't think we'll try this one again.

Used 1 xl zucchini, 1 tsp onion powder, cut the parm to 1/4 cup, used mozzarella instead of feta. WOULD have been really good, except I subbed 3/4 cup whole wheat flour for the AP, and the wheat flour was overpowering.  Riley said it tasted like a pancake! Also skipped out on the extra mozz at the end.

So easy. I vary vegetables I put in and I have made it with rice flour to make it gluten free. I don't make it in the food processor, but the kitchenaid mixer.
