This recipe is pretty good. It wasn't overly sweet. The only thing I did differently was what I baked it in. I used my cast iron skillet & let it preheat in the oven. I melted the butter in the skillet as it warmed. That created a good crunch on the edges. It also only took about 45 minutes to bake this way. I served it warm with vanilla ice cream...YUM!

I will definitely make this again.  I used gluten free all purpose flour, and it worked out fine.  It's so rare that I have a positive gluten free baking experience.  I also could not find almond meal, so I used a half  cup of sliced almonds that I crushed in a baggie with a rolling pin.  Thank you Chef John

Got up early one Saturday morning and knocked this off before my wife woke up. Excellent recipe, as expected from Chef John. I had no almond meal, so improvised with almond extract and bread crumbs and corn starch. Whatever the merits of that concoction, it worked and the buckle tastes great.

I had to take out of oven after about 45 minutes because it was getting real brown on top.   I served it warm with vanilla ice cream and it was very good.

Yes, I will make it again but with changes.  First, the recipe called for lining the pan in melted butter, but I used salted, and it made the batter too salty.  Next time I will use unsalted butter.  
I didn't have almond meal, but I did add 1 tsp almond extract to the batter.  I thought that was a wonderful addition and went well with the berries.

I made this with my three year old daughter. It was so much fun to do with her, and she was able to help with all of it, and kept interest in it the whole time. It wasn't even that messy to make with her! Also it was delicious, my daughter wanted thirds lol! Love this recipe

Made this with some of the fresh blackberries growing all over the Pacific Northwest right now. I used my 12-inch cast iron skillet and it fit great. Not sure if it's because the cast iron conducts heat so well, but mine only too about 45 minutes to cook. Great dessert for guests and leftovers made a yummy breakfast the next day!

As another reader shared to use chopped almonds if you
don't have almond flour. I should have checked the buckle at 30 minutes. At 45 min the edges were pretty crisp.Good
tasting..not too sweet.

I made this recipe for July 4th, today and loved it. I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out and tasted lovely. It was fun and easy to do and the end result was very tasty and pretty to look at. Very similar to a cobbler but the crust was crispy and crunchy once I added the toasted almonds to the top. Also, once it cooled it sliced well too. We added a very nice scoop of vanilla ice cream to each cooled serving. Very yummy combination!

Turned out wonderfully. I took one reviewer's suggestion to smash up sliced almonds in place of the almond meal. I also added extra berries and almost double the toasted sliced almonds topping. Easy, tasty, recipe that I will definitely make again. Thank you for sharing!

This was excellent but I decided to make it even more low carb by substituting 1/2 cup coconut flour for some of the all purpose flour. I had to add just a touch more milk and we love the flavor. I have tried a number of different fruits too and so far the best combo was pitted black cherries, sliced peaches and sliced pears. I mixed the three fruits in a bowl with the juice from the can of the cherries,and omitted the 2 tbs of sugar, my husband liked this the best (no seeds).

Excellent recipe!  I had extra coconut milk so I used one cup of that thicker milk and added 1/4 cup more regular milk.  I also used a mix of blue berries and black berries.  Super easy to make and this recipe was delicious.

It was a delicious recipe. I just melted the butter in a Pyrex cup in the microwave instead of melting it in a skillet. Otherwise I didn't make any changes.

I did not care for this recipe. The dry ingredients needed WAY more milk in order to become wet for the "pour-able batter" that he talks about. I think I ended up using 4 or more cups of milk!

I thought this was just a so so dessert.  The Crust was not very good and not as flavorful as I had expected.
I would not make this dish again.

I made this for dessert for my boyfriend and his parents. It was a huge success! Made good leftovers for breakfast the next day.
