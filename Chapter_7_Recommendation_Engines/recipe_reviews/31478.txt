I'm an African American from the South, so I needed a collard green recipe that would not disappoint at the Thanksgiving table.  This one was a hit and was very easy to prepare.  Everyone loved them and made sure to take some to go.  They were very well seasoned with the chicken broth, turkey leg and garlic.  Only difference is that we bought the pre-washed Wal-Mart bags of collard greens, but still cooked them for the time outlined in this recipe.  We used 4 bags with this recipe.  Next time we can probably cut back and only use 3, because it made a whole lot.

I tried these about 2 months ago which was my first time ever making collard greens. Let me tell you something them were the BEST collard greens I have ever taste! OMG they were sooooooo GOOD and flavorful. My entire family LOVED them and being in a black family collard greens are traditional at the dinner table. All you need to do is follow the recipe. That's it! The only thing I did different was cook them a little longer. Either or they were FABULOUS!!!

Anadri, thank you so much for this recipe! My mother had doubts that I could make some decent collard greens for the Thanksgiving table, but I reassured her that even though I had never attempted to cook my own, she would love mine! I was going to use a hamhock, but I waited until the last minute to shop (Thanksgiving Eve) and the grocery store was out of them! I hoped and prayed that smoked turkey legs wouldn't compromise flavor. Boy, was I jumping for joy when I tasted my collard greens while they were cooking! I made sure to clean them very thoroughly (rinsed them 3 times in cold water). Removed the stems, and ripped the leaves into smaller pieces with my hands. The chicken stock, onion (I added 1 small onion), and garlic added so much flavor! I think the key to making some good collards is to wash them thoroughly and to cook them through until they are tender. Don't hesitate to cook them a bit longer! You want them to have the same texture as barely wilted spinach- but let's face it, collards have so much more flavor :) Thanks for being a godsend! Mom and family had high praises. We dunked our breadrolls and cornbread in the delicious broth :9 Yum! * Prior to serving, I took the legs out, chopped into smaller pieces, and checked thoroughly for any loose pieces of cartilage in the greens.

These are the best the same way I always cook mine. Of course being southern, we sometimes add fat back or bacon for flavoring also.  Also if you find you greens with just a little bitter taste, I learned this trick from my granmother add about1 TBSP honey, srupor brown sugar.  People who usually complain about the bitterness witll eat it when I add the sweet.  Thanks...

Anadri, your recipe is terrific - thanks so much for sharing it.  My boyfriend claimed his "Momma's" greens are the best, but after 3 full servings he had nothing to say but refilling his bowl with more.  Thanks for helping me shut him AND his Momma up.  :)

Absolutely delicious and yes, tasty! Cooking these
greens in a mixture of chicken broth and smoked turkey promotes and outstanding and flavorful combination.  Of course, I added my own touch somewhat by cooking the greens with a finely chopped small onion and replaced seasoning salt for regular salt. We'll enjoy this recipe forever!

This is very similiar to the way I've always made collard greens.  I usually use fresh garlic, but I took a shortcut the other night and used canned roasted garlic chicken stock and surprisingly the greens turned out even better!  Used a splash of cayenne pepper instead of the red chile flakes and served with hot sauce.  Very good!  (Forgot to mention I added an onion to the chicken stock as well)

great recipe.  I would add a couple of things.  One, adding sugar cuts the bitterness.  Don't add more than a couple of tsp because you don't want the greens to taste sweet.  Two, I add a couple of tablespoons of vinegar. I use rice vinegar but I don't think it makes a difference. Three, experiment with seasonings. I add garlic, onion powder, season salt, and others that I have experimented with over the years.  The red pepper flakes are definitely a must but should be added maybe a half hour before cooking is complete.  Last, try experimenting with different smoked meats.  I've found that a combination of smoked turkey and smoked pork takes my greens over the edge.  I have sliced fresh tomato handy for folks to cut up in their greens and a little pepper soaked vinegar.  Been making greens this way for years.  Never had one complaint and I am always asked to cook the greens at every occasion.  Experiment and find combinations that you and your family will love

This recipe was wonderful. I was a little hesitant at first because the recipe was totally different from any collard greens that I have ever had, but my husband and I thought that these were great! Even my three year-old said, "these 'gweens' are good, mama!"

I have been hailed Queen of Greens from this recipe! The only things different I did was I did not add any crushed red pepper flakes and I added 1 & 1/2 tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  The results are AMAZING!  My family is black and some of my family is from the Carribean so I had a big table of judges waiting on Thanksgiving to taste this and I received 5 stars across the board for this dish.  Thanks Anandri!!

This was the 1st time I'd ever cooked collard greens.  I sauteed a small chopped onion before adding 1 Tbsp (not 2) of garlic.  It took quite a while to cook this but the smoked turkey drumstick added a nice flavor.  I'd suggest tasting it at the end to see if you want to add any red pepper flakes &, if so, how much.

Having roots in the deep south, I must say the turkey surprised me... I had thought the only meat for greens was fatback or hamhocks a very nice change to say the least! I want to suggest for those who don't know, it's easier when chopping the whole leaves if you lay 4-5 leaves on top of each other and roll them up cigar-style and "slice" across  about every 1/4 inch or so. We also add Louisiana Hot Sauce at the table to taste.

This was an awesome recipe.  I grew my collards in my garden and this was the first time I've ever cook them without them being in a can.  This will be a regular in our home.  Thank you for posting it.

This is the first time I have ever cooked collard greens...was always to "afraid" that they wouldn't measure up to my friend's.  This was so easy and the results were delicious!  I could not find smoked turkey drumstick, so I used a smoked turkey wing, which seemed fine.  The only other change I made was that I added a small chopped onion when I added the greens to the pot.  Instead of salt and black pepper, I used Season All, which I layered throughout as I added the greens to the pot and let them cook down.

I put my own twist on this a bit .. I boiled the smoked ham hocks for a couple of hours until falling off the bone, in water not chicken stock....then added to the boiling water onions, garlic, salt and pepper (red pepper flakes are a little too much for my family). I also added about a half of a teaspoon of liquid smoke to the water for a smokier flavor. I added the greens and boiled for about an hour, they were perfect. The final touches are vinegar and sugar (a must) before serving. Delicious!!!

I am a vegetarian who loves collards.  I cooked this with vegetable broth and omitted the turkey leg and it was still delicious.  My carnivore, nonvegetable-eating husband had seconds!  The turkey probably adds to the taste - but for those looking for collards without meat, these are still the best I've ever had!

The amount of chicken stock was not enough for the medium high heat simmering for 45 minutes and I burnt the greens. Either simmer on low the whole time or add a LOT more fluids.

This turned out so delicious. I used 3 bunches of collards with one whole smoked turkey leg. I only made 5 servings (using the recipe adjuster) which called for 3 cups of chicken stock, but I ended up using the entire 32-oz (4 cups) carton. After the greens were done cooking, I removed the turkey leg, let it cool and then shredded the meat and added it back to the greens. I also added a just a teaspoon or so of red pepper flakes. Other than that, I followed the instructions to the letter. Very, very good!

AMAZING!!! The flavor is perfect. These are by far the best greens I've ever experienced. Wish I could take the credit. I always put in lots of crushed red pepper flakes for an extra special kick!

Made this recently for my husband, who is diabetic. I was trying to find some interesting ways to serve greens because they are so low in carbohydrates. This is my first attempt ever to make collard greens--and I've been married nearly 36 years. I have to say, they were WONDERFUL. I didn't change a thing about the recipe, followed cooking times exactly. My only question while I was cooking was, How big is a bunch? I was worried about using too much/too much little of the leaves compared to the liquid involved. Anyway, I ended up using a huge, 2-lb bag of cleaned, cut up collards from Walmart, and the leaf-to-liquid ratio was perfect, not to mention the convenience of not having to wash or chop. About halfway through the cooking time I added another cup of boiling water to the pot. I may not have had to do this, actually, but I was lazy: I wanted to leave the room without watching the pot constantly to make sure it didn't run out of liquid. The collards were soft and tender but not mushy or slimy. The flavor was robust with just the perfect amount of garlic. The shreds of smoked turkey sprinkled throughout the greens (I simply pulled the meat away from the bone while the leg was still in the pot) were not too much--it still tasted like a vegetable dish. The oiliness factor was just right. All in all, a really great side dish. This recipe will feed a crowd. There's only three of us, so we will enjoy the greens for a week. Love this recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This recipe is great.  I have been using it as my base greens recipe for awhile now and with just a few changes here and there to taste (I like some onion and a pinch or two of curry), it always get's compliments.  I cut down on the olive oil a little bit because it seems like the turkey leg adds a bit of grease too, and they were a bit too oily for me the first time.

FABULOUS!!  Coming from an interracial family I never had the nerve to try it... SO GLAD I DID....my husband can't enough!  Modifications: added 1 whole onion with garlic and oil. Used 4 bags (32oz) of frozen prechopped (THANK YOU!), ended up using smoked neckbones as I couldn't find the smoked turkey leg.  What is the difference by the way with stock and broth?? I used 3 boxes of chicken stock. As suggested by others I did not add salt... thank goodness.  Did use black ppper and skipped the red pepper flakes. Flavor was fabulous.  The tiny bits of meat that came off the neck bones was perfect (just like my mother in laws), very tender but definately don't short the cook time.

These were yummy! My family raved about them! One word of caution, though: watch the liquid levels toward the end. I scorched the bottom layer, because the broth completely cooked off. And I followed the directions to a T. But lesson learned! A keeper!

This is now my go-to collards recipe. I like using smoked turkey instead of ham hocks. Only could find smoked turkey neck pieces but worked perfect. Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I added an onion like a number of other reviewers. I also used a ham hock instead of the turkey leg since I already had it but next time I'll definitely try the turkey leg!

This recipe is wonderful! I did add sweetner to the ingredients.  I tend to like a spicy-sweet taste to my greens.  You can use sugar or normal way that you sweeten your foods and beverages.

Thanks for posting.

I have made collard greens before not exactly to this recipe but very similar. I will definitley cook it in chicken stock next time and add some minced garlic. If you love okras try throwing in some whole okras in the last 40 minutes of cooking the greens. You can also season with ham hock meat.

WOW!!  I am a Black woman in my 40's and I have NEVER liked greens in my life UNTIL THIS RECIPE!!!  I served canned greens a couple weeks prior & they were NOT a huge hit.  My family normally would have to eat the homemade ones at family gatherings but I decided to give it a try to surprise my family.  I could not stop eating them.  They are the BEST!!  I have shared them with family & friends who ate greens for years and said that MY GREENS were the best that they ever had.  Thanks for not only giving out a good recipe but causing me to eat something I despised for soooo long.  I made them just the way the recipe states, no changes.  I didn't need the red pepper flakes and they were simply delicious.  THANK YOU ANADRI!!!

Wow, this is an excellent receipe.  Easy to make and tastes great.  I used ham hocks instead of a smoked turkey leg and took out the fat after it was done.  Also I added 10 crisp pieces of bacon (chopped them into small pieces) 1/2 an hour before they were done.

Wonderful flavor. Broth is so good you could drink it! I cooked onion and fresh garlic together then added the chicken broth and a cup of water. I used smoked turkey wings instead. I always remove the bone and cut off some of the meat halfway through and return it all to the pot for more flavor. The red pepper flake gives it a great kick. My 6 year old daughter will only eat these greens that I make which really upsets Nana and other family members. "My mama's greens are better!"

I cook some smoked turkey wings in the pot for 2 hours, then I add collard greens and sometimes I mix them. Add olive oil. I cook another 1 hour. Seasoning them just right is a must!

These were the best collards I've ever made.  Even my 17 yr old son ate them and liked them.  He said "it's like bacony lettuce".  I guess bacony lettuce is good.  The smoked turkey leg really adds a lot of flavor and a lot to meat to the finished dish.  Served them with a pot of beans (also seasoned with smoked turkey leg) and cornbread.  I am a convert.  I'll never use ham hock again.  Sounthern country cookin at it's finest.

I'm from the South, and love traditional, long-cooked greens. Using the smoked turkey is a great alternative to pork. Fresh collards in the fall/early winter are the best to use, if possible. If it's not possible to get fresh ones, bagged greens found in the produce section will work. If they're a little bitter, add about a tablespoon of sugar. It makes a difference and you won't taste the sugar!

This recipe was pretty easy.  I added onions, and hamhock instead of turkey, two tablespoons of Vinegar and sugar and I added two cups of water and an additonal cup of chicken stock and these greens came out so good.  Everyone really loved them for thanksgiving.  I also cooked the greens for an additonal hour and a half so they were very flavorful.

I had never had collard greens before.  After having them at a restaurant, I decided to try and make them at home.  This recipe was fantastic.  I even impressed some friends who grew up in North Carolina.  (I live in Michigan)  Made 8 servings for 5 people hoping to have left overs, but the bowl was empty at the end of dinner.

It's true. These collard greens are a hit. I read the reviews and said this is too simple to be in law competing kind of good, against southern women who have been doing this for years but the greens are that good.  Thank you so much for providing rookie cooks like me the opportunity to shut up women who swear to be the best. I am not a great cook but this recipe is easy. I used smoved turkey necks and had no problems! You must try this recipe if you like collards.

My first time making Collard greens myself, and this recipe was excellent! My husband and kids LOVED them. Everyone had extra helpings, which never happens with a vegetable. Added 1 tsp brown sugar and 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar as some reviews recommended, and left out crushed red pepper because my kids can't handle spicy. I added some Tabasco on my helping, and definitely kicked the flavor up to the next level. Delicious with or without though. Thanks!

This was delicious! One downside is that they burned because the chicken stock ended up boiling out (as noted by another review). Also, be careful about adding salt; I added barely any and it still turned out pretty salty. I'm guessing the smoked turkey must have been fairly salty.

These turned out very tasty as suggested! However, I had two pretty major issues with the recipe. First, I am not sure what size pot is recommended, but I used a large dutch oven pot and the turkey leg was sticking out of the pot the entire time it was cooking. So, I could not fit the lid tight. Once I added the collards I cooked it at about 6.5 on my stove and then on the last step set the stove to about 3-3.5. I also couldn't close the lid properly, so the water may have evaporated off a little quicker. On the last step, it only needed about 30 minutes more cook time. The second was that the recipe suggested that it made 10 servings. However, by the time it cooked down, I was lucky to get 5 servings. I ended up using homemade turkey stock and it worked great. I didn't add the optional red pepper flakes, pepper, or addtional salt. The stock and smoked turkey leg definitely had plenty of salt and flavor. I admit, I was really surprised how well this did turn out taste wise. My plan next time, is to make two pots or find a larger pot. I may also just try a smoked turkey wing. I will miss the meat, but it will at least fit in the pot. Either way, I think I will make this again on a holiday occasion. TY

This recipe turned out very flavorful. I did add a small bit of red onion to the garlic when I sauteed it. Otherwise I followed the recipe as written.

I leave out the turkey drumstick altogether and this is absolutely delicious!  I have made this several time and it always receives rave reviews from some people who know how greens should be.  They say the greens taste like they were cooked with ham or turkey even though they were not.  Thanks for the recipe.

Tisnisna simple easy recipe for "tasty collard greens". I have made with and without turkey as my sister in law is a vegetarian.  I cook my greens longer then listed for extra tenderness!

These were delicious!!!! I used a smoked ham hock and a few shakes of liquid smoke instead of the turkey leg, but I thought they were fantastic!  I will be making this recipe again and again.  Thank you!!!

Before this recipe I had never purchased, cooked or eaten collard greens so I was a bit apprehensive about cooking this. It turned out great and was a huge hit with my family. The only substitution I made was a smoked turkey wing for the ham.  I will definitely make this again.

As a southern girl living in MN, good soul-food style collards are non-existent unless I am on a road trip back home or make them myself, although I never got it quite right. I made slight variations to this recipe and now they taste like I have worked in a soul food restaurant for years! I forgot to buy turkey legs, so I used smoked pork neck bones instead. I also added a tiny bit (1/2 tsp or so?) of Liquid Smoke near the end, as suggested by another reviewer. They are amazing! I think the Liquid Smoke may have been what I was looking for but couldn't figure out. Thanks for posting this recipe for collards like I remember having back in LA!

These greens were my contribution to Thanksgiving dinner last year.    I've never tried making collards before so I followed this recipe exactly.   To summarize, these will now be a staple for Thanksgiving dinner from now on (and probably more often.)  What a huge hit!  My boyfriend commented that they were even better than our favorite soul food restaurant!  Thanks for making good food AMAZING!

Very, very good!  Thanks for the great recipe.  The smoked turkey drumstick gave it a great flavor.  I cooked up some sweet onions in the oil along with the garlic and used cayenne pepper instead of red pepper flakes (family preference) like some other reviewers suggested and will do so again next time.

We substituted swiss chard for collards and cooked it on a slightly lower temp for less time.  I also used a ham hock instead of the stock and turkey leg.  But it was a terrific starer recipe and I was very happy with the results.

My husband absolutely loves this recipe.  Very tasty with a littl kick from the red pepper.  Also the greens still taste very fresh instead of tasting like meat.  Nothing against greens with neckbones.  I make those too from time to time.

These were absolutely delicious!!  I have been trying to find a go-to greens recipe for years and I've finally found it!  The recipe was easy to follow and the greens were full of flavor from the turkey leg, chicken stock, and garlic.  I modified the recipe by adding some diced onion to the garlic/olive oil mixture and also decreased the amount of crushed red pepper flakes to one teaspoon plus to taste.  I made this for New Year's dinner and my guests thought these were the best greens ever.  Thank you for posting!

Wonderful greens. The first time I've made greens and it was so easy! Having just moved to TN from OR I was getting a lot of flack about my "Yankee cooking," but now my friends are thinking twice. I bought 2 bags of frozen, chopped collards (the store's fresh bunches looked less than fresh) and subbed 2# smoked ham hocks for the turkey. Also I added about 1 tbsp each of onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. I also added about 2 tbsps of butter just before serving. Will def make again SOON. Thanks!

I have been eating collards my whole life and when I make them following this recipe, they last about two days for two people. I make 4-5 lbs. every week.  These collards have become a staple in our diets.  Very healthy and very very good!

I am a southern cook, and I have been trying to cut fat in my cooking and keep the flavor. this collard green recipe sounds good, close to mine, but I use 3-4 smoked turkey necks, I cook them in 4cups water with onion, and garlic granules until the necks are tender. and water evaporated I then add my greens with a tsp of sugar(helps the flavor) I boil them on medium add canned chicken broth as needed to keep them from scorching and when they have cooked down I add, dash salt , hot pepper flakes or 1-2 pickled hot peppers and a couple tbs of chicken bouillon either granules or paste (this adds salt). I do not use any oil as the fat from the broth and necks provide enough fat. from that point I let them cook until tender. Takes app 2hrs from start to finish after preparing greens (I usully get 2 bunches fresh or 1 large prepack bag) either by rinsing if prepack or washing and rinsing if from the garden. I gave this recipe a 4 because of the use of olive oil to me thats just too much.

I used country ham instead of turkey leg for seasoning and turkey broth instead of chicken broth. There was no need to add salt with the country ham seasoning.

this recipe is basically how i've made collards for years, but a couple of important changes will improve upon a pretty good recipe. first, i use smoked turkey wings because the legs have splinter bones in them that can be tough to fish out (and you definitely want to get all of them out because of the potential choking hazard). the wings have just as much flavor as the legs.

an old southern trick from my mother & grandmother is to wash the greens with baking soda and/or some dishwashing liquid. this will help get the grit and sand off the leaves better than just clear water. using a salad spinner helps too.

cook the turkey until it's tender and falling off the bone then discard the skin and debone the wing. also, when you add the collards, make sure you stir them regularly so that you don't end up with some greens that are overcooked while others are under done. collards are tough and take a while to cook, longer than this recipe calls for, but don't leave them completely unattended for more than 10-15 minutes as you may have to add water (the broth may boil down and become salty, so taste it if it's reduced significantly).

Perfect method for cooking your greens, very tasty. I actually prefer using turkey kielbasa instead of smoked turkey but that's just personal preference. Thanks anadri!

Delicious.  Well worth the time on this one.  I have done it with and without the turkey.  Both are good but the with turkey gives it an edge.  I have saved 30 mins by doing it without the turkey.  I just add the greens to the broth mix once it is hot.  The greens cone out the same texture.

All ingredients were used to exact measurements with the exception on the greens. I used mustard, kale, and collard mix and it turn out GREAT.  The greens were so good that a week later my husband decided to make them again. This recipe is definitely a keeper.  This is an excellent recipe!

I think I was "fated" to find this recipe!  For the first time in my life (65 yrs) I bought a smoked turkey leg @ the WM deli, not really knowing why. (I also bought a chimichanga, which I'd never had!) I had collards, because I buy them regularly. By accident, I came across this recipe, and so glad I did!  Fantastic!  I had to stop myself from drinking all the broth! My friend and I both loved them, so I will be making them again soon.  Thanks for sharing!

Good recipe, but 2 things i do differently.  I always add some diced jalapeno for some warmth and sometimes I use smoked turkey kielbasa instead of the smoked turkey leg.  The meat lovers here like the greens with chunks of the kielbasa.

Also, I have found that it is easier to cook the meat and stock for a good hour before adding the greens.  This lets you adjust the cooking time of the greens (sometimes my greens are really little and cook well in 10 minutes and sometimes really big and tough and take 40 min).  You just add the greens and when they are done, you remove from heat.

Excellent collard greens and so glad I didn't have to use fatback. I could not find a smoked turkey leg on Thanksgiving Eve but my grocer did have smoked turkey necks.  I used about 3 necks out of the package.  Once simmered and cooked well, I removed the necks and tore off small pieces of meat to add back to the greens (and discarded the boney parts).  I had homemade chicken broth in the freezer to use.  Recipe calls for FIVE bunches of collards.  I had 2 large bunches and it took a long time to prep: washing, discarding the center stem and then chopping the leaves.  It was worth it, though!

I was a little skeptical at first but these greens really are amazing! I did however use a smoked turkey wing  instead of drumstick and added about 2 tablespoons of apple vinegar while cooking which gave it an special kick!

This was my first time eating or cooking collard greens.  All I can say is YUMMY!  I didn't have a smoked turkey drumstick so I used Liquid Smoke.  I can't wait to make them again.  Thank you for this recipe.

These greens were absolutely excellent.  My family loved them and said the greens were one of the best they ever tasted!!!  Next time I will use smoke tukey necks.  Drumsticks are too big!!  I didn't use any red pepper flakes.

Never made collard greens before but based on the reviews, I decided to try them.  I ambitiously made this for Christmas.

One word "WINNER!".  My husband, who loves southern cooking, LOVED them!  My mom who loved my grandmother's (R.I.P) greens, said these were almost on par with hers...I know she'd be proud. 
I didn't use the red pepper flakes but it wasn't missed.  Also, my husband added vinegar to one of the multiple servings he had and said it tasted just as good.

I've been looking for a good collard green recipe using turkey.  Previously it's come out very bland and I had to add extra salt.  These were very tasty.  Used about 4 bunches of fresh greens.  Made them for Christmas and everyone loved them.

Perfect for when you have run out of bacon grease!  The only thing I did different was left out the drumstick and added minced onion.

Really good recipe for collard greens, especially for a novice in the kitchen!  Could not get a turkey drumstick, but was able to use a ham hock instead which offered great seasoning as well.  My children all had extra helpings and asked for it to be served again!!  Thanks for such a great recipe!

These were good I threw everything in a crock pot and used afew hot peppers instead of flakes.  Cooked until tender 8 hours on low.  Note I cooked turkey leg by itself for an hour picked of skin and removed grisel.  Put clean bone back in so I didn't have and sharp objects in the collards.

I've always been nervous about attempting collard greens, but this recipe was easy and delicious!  Instead of fresh greens, I used frozen and cooked in a crockpot on low for 10 hours.  It was flavorful and made a great addition to the bean and vegetable soup we made the next day.

These were soooo good! I couldn't find a smoked turkey leg, so I seasoned and baked fresh legs in the oven, then poured the juices into the greens while cooking them. I then peeled the meat and put only that in the pot. For the greens I sauteed the onions in olive oil, then gradually added the greens sauteing them also... This is something a friend taught me and it makes them taste even better!

Delicious!  I used two bouillon cubes and 5 cups of water and omitted the salt.  I think one cube will be enough because the sodium content in two cubes is still way too high.  I also decreased the cooking time to 25 minutes because I like the greens to retain their dark color and I don’t like the texture to be too mushy.  Very easy and tasty recipe.  Will definitely make again.

I made these with ribs...SO GOOD! I think i will make these every week, so healthy...i love my vegtables! I followed the recipe but i added some finely chopped onion and some vinigar and definitly red pepper flakes. Oh and some bacon that was already cooked i wanted to use up in addition to the smoked turkey drum. I had nice little chunks of meat in my greens.

I grew up in the North where Escarole (which I abhor) is a staple so I had never eaten (much less prepared) Collard Greens. But I've always been curious about them. So now that I'm living below the Mason-Dixon line, I thought I would try this recipe. WONDERFUL! I didn't have turkey, so I used 1-1/2 lb. of pork chops (which I eventually cut up and re-incorporated) instead. DH loved it as did my 3 adult "children". Thank God, we'll never have to eat Escarole ever again! [oh, yes: I'd recommend allowing the finished product to sit and "marry" for at least 1 hour (reheat if necessary)]. We are 5 people. The recipe, as written, suggests 10 servings. NO leftovers. 'Nuff said.

OMG soooo good! EASY TOO! Publix didn't have a smoked turkey leg, but they did have ham hocks so I used 2 of those instead. 4 bags of collards was perfect.  Makes a whole lot so if there's only about 4 of you I'd divide this recipe. Make with confidence!

My husband grew up on these and this was the first recipe I tried that he said was good. I do back up on the red pepper and add to taste since my younger kids won't eat it if I add the full amount in.

This is hands down the best collard green recipe I've ever had.  I made this a total of four different times and each time, people told me it was the best bunch of collards they've ever eaten.  This is definitely a keeper!

Very good flavor and easy to prepare. Did need to cook longer than listed, about 1 hour extra. We used 2 bags of pre-cut greens and had plenty.

Really great recipe.  The supermarket did not have ANY smoked turkey so I bought ham hocks and used 1.  It's so good!  Might try the hot pepper flakes next time.  Update: Made this again with a smoked turkey wing this time and love the flavor as well, but watch out, it's really salty.

I made this exactly as the recipe stated, other than cooking it a little longer as some had suggested. This was soooo good!  It was the first time I had made greens and found the recipe to be easy to follow. I made vegetable soup the following day and added about 1 1/2 cups of the greens with its juices to the soup, and OMGOODNESS, it took the soup to another level of deliciousness!

Fabulous, delicious, healthy!!  I followed the recipe exactly and was delighted with how the collards turned out .  If I could recommend anything, it would be to use a quality chicken broth.  I used a cheap watery one and the flavor was just not the same.

Followed this recipe for Easter and the family thought they were awesome.  I couldn't find enough collard greens, so I subbed some mustard greens for some of the collards.

They were perfect. I stuck with the tried tested and true ham hock. Instead of adding the red pepper flakes on greens themselves at the end, I adding them in towards the end of the cooking time. My mother is in awe.

This was my first time ever making greens.  I didn't use the extra spice and instead of a turkey leg,  I used 6 slices of turkey bacon and no added salt.  I had someone who doesn't even like greens eat them and love them.  Also I had 4 people (3 of whom make awesome greens themselves)  try them and they all said nothing needed to be added.  I don't eat everyone's greens and have never really loved them,  but I'm trying to eat healthier and I loved them too.  Great recipe!

This recipe interested me as my New Year's meal was pretty "pork heavy" with a brown sugar ham and black-eyed peas with a ham hock.  I thought the turkey addition would be really nice - and it was.  I used 4 bunches of collared greens instead of 5 and a smoked turkey leg (brined for 11 hours with kosher salt, brown sugar, water, and liquid smoke and then *loosely* smoked on our grill).  After greens had cooked down, I removed turkey leg and diced a bit of the meat and tossed that back in.  Also added a scant tablespoon of sugar and a few splashes of white vinegar.  I didn't cook for as long as it said as my greens were getting to a nice consistency and I didn't want 'em mushy.  Really, really good.  I would like to try this next year with a proper smoked turkey leg (couldn't find one this year) - I bet that would make it great!

I cooked this for Christmas (first time making collard greens, although I've eaten them gazillion of times) and they came out banging! Easy to make and worth the wait.

I haven't even finished cooking these greens and they are so flavorful. I
You definitely have to be the judge about the broth. I used the washed/cut bags of greens (2)  and 4 boxes of chicken broth. I haven't even added salt yet. Make these greens people. Yummy yummy yummy :) Merry Christmas

This was an amazing recipe. My only additions were an onion while sautéing the garlic and I had to use bagged collard greens which wasn't enough. Since I'm not too such what a "bunch" consists of, next time I will use 4 bags of greens instead of 2. My family eats tons of this stuff so maybe we just need to double the recipe in general.

Pretty good start with chicken stock and turkey leg. I usually use ham hocks and water. I'm not used to tasting garlic in greens, so that was a bit of a distraction that actually led to the best pot of greens I've ever made. I added white vinegar to taste, seasoning salt to taste, and an onion. Also, I used three bags of the pre-cut Glory greens, and I kept adding alternating amounts of water and extra chicken stock as I cooked them until tender.

After reducing the proportions of the recipe down to 4 servings, I cooked according to the directions. A half hour into the last hour long stretch of cooking time, I entered the room to find all the collards burned to the bottom of the pan! I managed to salvage them with the quick addition of some chicken stock, but people reducing the recipe should consider adding extra chicken stock while cooking!

A quick easy way to make collard greens is in a pressure cooker.  I cook them all the time.  My favorite way is to put a little olive or vegetable oil in the bottom of the pressure cooker and brown two to four salted & peppered bone-in pork chops, turn the chops over after they brown on one side and brown for a few minutes and add a pinch of red chili flakes, chop the greens removing the bottom thick stems  and add to the pot. (Be careful if the greens are still wet because the water will cause steam and splattering oil.  Mix the greens with the oil and meat drippings then add water to the pressure cooker (the amount will depend on the number of chops & collards) you want a few inches in the bottom of the pressure cooker.  Put on the lid, add the pressure valve and bring to a loud hiss from the cooker, turn down to medium and cook approximately 15-18 minutes.  Oh my the drippings from the chops will really add great flavor to the greens and now you have a meal in a pot.  YUM

The flavor is really good. I had to use more chicken stock and I threw in a pinch of sugar to draw out some of the bitterness of the greens but it was really good.

EXCELLENT!!  We had never had collard greens till this evening, and this was a great recipe to try!  I followed everything, except for the turkey.  Instead, I used a smoked ham hock, as it's what I had on hand.  I'll definitely be making these again soon!

I did something a little different with this recipe:  I simmered smoked turkey wings with the broth, then chopped up some of the meat to add to the greens once they were cooked. I then added some fresh black-eyed peas and simmered a bit more till they were done (canned beans are good, too).  I served it in bowls with the broth so it is more of a soup, and oh my is it good.  Definitely a favorite of mine now.   Thanks!

This recipe is great!  My family is still raving over these greens.  The base recipe would be very good; I made a few adjustments:
1. 1 1/2 Tbsp Honey
2. Mixed Collard Greens & Mustard Greens
3. Seasoned with Smoked Turkey Wing
4. Cooked in Crockpot (low, 5 hours)
I sauted the fresh, minced garlic in the olive oil before putting it in the crockpot.  I added honey and salt at the end of cooking.
Enjoy!

Ohh these were delicious my family said I was crazy for using smoked turkey leg instead of neck bones! Turned very tasty. They were a bit bitter but added a lil brown sugar and it evened it all out. Oh and only use a dash of chile flakes. Lets just say I blew they mouths off :-)

Absolutely wonderful! I made this for Thanksgiving, and it passed my son-in-law's taste test. I used smoked ham hocks and omitted the salt pork.

Mmmmm...this is SO good. I used a huge bag of collard greens from Wal-Mart, used alot more chicken stock and just roasted a chicken to go with it, taking off one of the legs about half way through cooking and put it in the broth for my greens.

Made this for dinner with Fried Chicken.  It rocked!  It takes awhile to make, but boy is it good!  AND, every time I've had Collards before I made this, I HATED them!  I'm now a Collard Green lover!
Also, forgot to mention that I used smoked ham hocks instead of the turkey drumsticks, and added 2 tablespoons of brown sugar.

This is the first time I've made greens.  I love southern cooking and I can cook and improvise pretty well so when I didn't see some ingredients in this dish I have heard added to greens I put my spin on it.  I added about 3-tablespoons of molasses, 2-tablespoons of brown sugar and about a quarter cup of apple cider vinegar.  It is best to add the molasses and brown sugar to the broth before the greens.  I added the vinegar after about 30-min of cooking down.  I used two bags of cut and cleaned collard greens.  After it was done cooking I tasted the greens and added about 2-cups of hot water to balance the flavors.  Came out great.

I'm a new cook & a guy. So I thought I would try to grow some collards in the garden & cook them. I didn't have smoked turkey so subst smoked pork I had in the fridge. Plus added a whole red pepper in the broth for about an hour. This recipe is almost as good as my Mom used to make. This is a GREAT recipe!!

OMG this recipe is so the bomb. My family is from Panama and I did not grow up making or eating collard greens. I had a BBQ today for Sunday Night Football. I was a little apprehensive it being my first time and all.  All my guest were saying these were the best tasting collard greens they ever had.  I was so happy to hear that.  Only thing I would hold back on the crushed red pepper flakes if you don't  like hot food as well as I used season salt instead of regular salt.

I have to say this recipe is outstanding.  We absolutely love it.  I am a southern gal who grew up with these comfort foods.  I can honestly say my grandma would be proud if she tasted these.  Oh, and my kids LOVE it!  Thank you for sharing this!

Best tasting greens I had in a very long time. With the crushed red peper it gives it just a little kick. Great added twist will make again.

Always a hit! Great dish to make a large batch of and refrigerate so you can eat when you want it. I use cured pork belly/ bacon instead of turkey since the smoked turkey drumstick is somewhat hard to find in our area- surprisingly enough.

I made these last night for dinner.  I have been cooking my greens this way for years, but instead of the Turkey drumstick, I normally use ham hocks.  This time I put a twist on it by adding a bunch of mustard greens and the greens still turned out very delicious.  My husband and daughter could hardly wait for them to finish cooking.  I think, I will continue adding mustard greens to the bunch; it seems to bump up the flavor.

This recipe superseded my expectations! I wish I could give it 100 stars; the flavor these greens pack is unimaginable. The ease of making these greens is a plus as well. I have looked through many recipes for greens and they usually call for things that the everyday mom does not have in the kitchen. I had all of the necessary ingredients to make these greens. The only thing I did differently was; I used bag greens by Glory. Make sure you still wash them although they say "prewashed" I love these because they take away two steps for me and that is the cutting and soaking. I have made these greens three times prior to today and now they will grace my family’s pallet once more and that is for Easter dinner...Happy Easter everyone!

wow - these had so much flavor! i only did two bunches which fedf abt three people.  definitely do not skip on the smoked turkey; it provided so much delicious flavor and the smokiness added a whole different dimension to the dish.  my boyfriend's dad cooks this and adds smoked bacon rather than smoked turkey which is delicious as well! thank you anadri!

I made these for my Xmas brunch and they were  very good and well seasoned.  If you have leftovers after the first night definitely follow the advice of ANADRI and remove the liquid when you store.  Mine were a little salty the second day.  I didn't cook as long as suggested.  I used a full bag of the fresh Greens found in the produce section.  It seemed to be equal to the amount suggested.

This is a perfect recipe for collard greens.  I sprinkled pepper vinegar over them at the end instead of using crushed red pepper flakes.  Absolutely delicious, and even my 11-year old son loved them!

This is the perfect recipe for greens.  I make greens regularly and this is the first time I actully followed a good recipe. I recommend not draining the greens and just using tongs to serve them and then to store the leftovers in the juice/liquid to add flavor and keep as much nutrients in the greens as possible because  a lot of nutrients are in the liquid.  Excellent recipe!

Delicious.  I used a smoked ham hock instead of the smoked turkey drumstick and added a chopped onion.  Everyone liked it with the crushed red pepper flakes, but if your audience doesn't like very spicy food, cut back on the amount or don't add it.  I did not add any salt, and used unsalted chicken stock.

Delicious recipe! I've been making collards for years and using the chicken stock made all the difference.  I will use this recipe many more times.  My mother was here when I used it the first time and she was impressed.

OMG!!! This was my first Thanksgiving dinner, and my first time cooking collard.  They were GREAT, my cousin thought I used canned collards.  They were GOOD.  I dont even eat collards, now I do.  Southern African-american family approved.

Made adjustments to the recipe and the greens still came out tasty. Instead of chicken stock I boiled the smoked turkey in water. Once done, I pulled pieces of the turkey from the bone and added these pieces to the greens cooking in the turkey broth. Seasoned with salt, pepper, seasoned salt, and a tablespoon of sugar at the end. No garlic, no crushed red pepper. Made the night before, and reheated the next day for Thanksgiving dinner. Drained most, but not all of the liquid before serving. Everyone enjoyed. Giving 4 stars because I made several changes.

I knew this would be good because it was similar to a family recipe I used years back so I was REALLY pleased with it. I followed the recipe and used 2 smoked turkey necks. I think the smoked turkey and broth were PLENTY for the seasoning so I won't add more than a pinch of salt next time. I used two bags of Glory pre-washed/pre-cut collards and I this was the perfect amount for us.  My brother in law told me that he had never had collards and decided he didn't like them until he tasted mine today as apart of his left-overs from turkey-day. He said he's now mad that he didn't have any on thanksgiving because he loved them!  So did I and I grew up on my grandmother's greens!

Considering I never had the 'urge' to cook or eat Collard Greens .. this recipe really helped.  I substituted Pancetta which I browned with the garlic and olive oil, then added the chicken broth & greens. I added salt which was absolutely not necessary .. couldn't eat it because it was too salty. I would try this again and omit the salt.

I tried the recipe verbatim, and this being my first attempt at collard greens I think it came out really well. I wasnt sure what to do with the smoked turkey...so after it had cooked with the collards i shredded it and put in in with them to serve. Bad call on my part...I think they would have been better off on their own. Next time I think im going to try it with onions as another person suggested, they would definitely add some dimension. Low sodium chicken stock is the way to go here as well...with the smoked turkey it would be easy to get too salty.

Kosher Collards! I could feed these to my Jewish husband because there is no pork in them. One of my black friends exclaimed that they were better than his mother's. Is there a higher compliment?

VERY GOOD but seemed a little salty. Since others haven't commented on this it must just be me. Next time I'm not going to add any extra salt and might venture out and try to make my own broth. Also, I only used a couple of tablespoons of oil. This recipe is a keeper!

This is the first time I made collards and it was easier than I thought. I bought the bag collards which saved alot of cleaning time. I used broth by accident instead of stock, not sure if that made a difference in flavor. I thought it needed more flavor (maybe because of the broth I used)so I added bacon and that made it tastier.

If you're a Northerner like me, you may be squeamish about trying greens.  After tasting some remarkable collards at a soul food restaurant in Charlotte, I have looked for something similar and even grew collards in hopes that I could recreate that recipe.  This is it!  Even my son, who strongly dislikes greens agreed to try these and enjoyed them.  Looks like I'll keep a collard patch every year now.

My Mom said that these were really good. It was my first time attempting collard greens and I although I did not like them, I know that they tasted the way they were supposed to taste. I am very proud of myself for executing this recipe. I could not find a smoked turkey leg, so I added "a dash" of liquid smoke and that seemed to do the trick. My Mom is the big cooker in the house and if she liked them, they must be good.

This was a simple recipe. I let mine cook much longer (all day on the stove) as I like my greens cooked all the way down. I did add some vinegar and a very finely chopped white onion as well as a few banana peppers. The turkey leg and chicken stock are where it's at! thanks!

Very good!  I didn't have a turkey drumstick so I used a few pieces of bacon.  My husband who doesn't like collards actually ate these and loved them!  I also topped with some Chow Chow Relish from Cracker Barrel - mmm mmm good!

This was really good. I don't like mushy greens so I only cooked about 55 minutes. I also used ham because that's what I had on hand. Definitely make again.

These collard greens are the best!  I used another reviewer's suggestion and added about 1 tbsp each of sugar and vinegar.  Really helped to deliciously round out my "Southern Style Christmas dinner."

I added onions and garlic and crushed red pepper. The greens didn't need much seasoning after cooking.  Try this, you'll be glad you did.

My Family said they didn't like collards. But I found this recipe and they loved the collards. I cut way back on the garlic. And I don't really ever put in the turkey leg. (I found that my children like the collards better without the meat) But for better taste I add Jalapenos.

My first time cooking greens (other than from a can) and they turned out perfectly and everyone loved them! Next time will definately use the pre-trimmed, cut bags from Super Wal-mart.  The worst part is cleaning, trimming and chopping!  I used scissors rather than a knife to cut them and that worked well. After the greens were done cooking I broke up the turkey drum to add the meat to the pot.

Wow, what taste! I used this recipe for Turnip Greens and with a ham bone in place of the turkey. It was so good that my husband who doesnt care for greens ate 1/2 of what I cooked by himself in two days! I plan on using this recipe again even though it is making him stingy over his turnips now!!

I made this for Christmas '06, just haven't had the time to submit my review. My husband and I did not like greens I believe because of the traditional hamhock recipe his mother would make. However, I made this and it was delicious! My mother in law had to change her diet due to health reasons and this was an a delicious alternative and she loved it! Even more then her traditional recipe. That is saying alot from an elderly southerner!

I had been searching high and low for a greens recipe with lots of flavor, but not containing pork.  This one is a winner.  The smoked turkey and chicken broth gave a great meaty taste and the pepper gives it a little zing without overpowering.  It's a great alternative to the southern, pork flavored favorite I grew up with.

These were delicious!  I couldn't find a smoked turkey leg, so I used a ham shank instead.  I put some of the meat into the greens when I was done.  Also, I  simmered the broth and ham shank, then simmered the greens on medium high for 45 minutes.  I didn't need to simmer on medium for the additional 45.  I will definitely make these again!

A very helpful receipe to use.  However, I used a mixture of greens (collard, turnip, and mustard) and already packaged smoked bacon bits (from the salad isle in the grocery store)instead of the turkey.  I also used some sugar to cut down on the natural bitterness.  Will always use this recipe with the noted changes. Thank you for your guideline of ingredients this was awesome!  Better than tasty, they were absolutely delicious! Even hard to please southern eaters loved these and I'm not a southerner. I was told that "I got soul!"

I love collard greens. I followed the recipe but I added some mustard greens to it and "OH MY GOODNESS" they came so flavorful. My family eat the greens like they never had green before. I will make this part of my Sunday dinners line up.

First time we have tried Collard Greens this recipes was easy and delicious.  I smoked the legs myself in my Green Egg and used two turkey legs with the recipe.  I also put red pepper hot sauce in for the perfect tang.

Great recipe!  Made a couple changes and additions1.  Added an onion to the sautéed garlic. (Doubled the garlic)2.  Used ham hock instead of turkey leg3.  Replaced 2 bunches of collard green with mustard greens and turnip greens. 4.  Accidentally added too much salt so threw in a couple potatoes chopped into chunks. They were the best potatoes ever!

Everyone loved these collard greens. Worth the extra time to de-stem the collards. Better flavor (less bitter) and texture. FYI - Recipe doesn't say to keep the collards covered at every step of cooking.

I will definately make this again with a few additions.  Because the smoke turkey was not flavorful enough I added Goya dry ham flavor seasoning to the smoked turkey drummets.

My FAV Greens...made with SMOKEY TURKEY LEGS (NO Pork, whatsoever):  flavors exactly balanced.  I did start out bit different than Recipe, saute' one finely diced large yellow onion, just beginning to turn translucent, prior to adding 2 T. finely minced garlic.  IMHO use FRESH organic collards...tastier.  I do use Organic Chicken Bone Broth as well.  Even though it's my thing to add a good quantity of Trappey's (Cajun) Hot Peppers in Vingar to my serving, not everybody likes it hot...so I did not add the optional 1T. crushed red pepper flakes.  It's all personal preference...while I like spicy hot vinegar added, for others' maybe not so much.  (Note:  Frank's RedHot Wings Buffalo Sauce also works, though not as strong a vinegar flavor as Trappey's, it provides buttery flavor and cayenne red peppers) HIGHLY RECOMMEND this Recipe:  Made today, all-gone today.  Oh, almost forgot:  The Recipe says to SIMMER, not  to cook on Medium entire cook.  IF you cook on Medium the entire time, you WILL need more Broth...my only other change was using Organic Cold-Pressed Coconut Oil instead of Olive Oil (because of it's smoking point, higher tolerance to higher temperatures).

Made today as directed with just a pinch of sugar and they came out perfect!!! I never make collards with smoked turkey because I love my smoked neck bones but trying to eat a little healthier. Definitely delish! I only used a pinch of sugar because it's summertime and greens probably a little bitter, but delish all the same. Thanks for sharing!

This was very good. I had just a few people to feed so I only used three bunches of greens rather than the five. I also used two smoked ham hocks instead of the turkey leg since I had them on hand. I would make this again.

Fellow vegetarian here but I was craving some collard greens. I followed the recipe simply omitting the smoked turkey leg and it still came out fantastic. Delicious and very flavorful. I can see how the smoked turkey leg would add flavor but honestly it’s so good without it too. Great recipe.

I didn't have a turkey drumstick, so I used a rib steak, but don't leave it cooking the whole time with the greens.  I also only added about a half a tablespoon of red pepper and 2T of butter.

I'm not often fooled by AR ratings, but I'm not sure why they are so high for this recipe. If you like greens seasoned by ham hocks, you will be disappointed. The turkey leg added little to no flavor. Healthier? Maybe, but there were plenty of collards left over after the Thanksgiving meal.

I found that a whole turkey leg made the greens very salty and also you may want to wrap the turkey leg in cheese cloth because I had many small bones in the greens once I served them

OK! Now when your home cooking SOUTHERN mother ask you, how you make these greens BECAUSE they taste better than hers, you know you have a winning recipe. I changed NOTHING to this recipe, besides a huge SMILE! The 1st time I cooked these my oh so picky husband refused to be the taster (the one how taste things to see if it needs a little more or a little less) but he even enjoyed them. This 2016 Thanksgiving I was appointed to cook the entire dinner by my lonesome ??.  These greens were the last things to be started. Mom even said "the greens smell good". NOW I'm sweating bullets, because I know she's going to talk about me if they didn't taste good ??. But you now know the outcome to that. If you don't have the turkey leg (I used a smoked one) it's okay the recipe is good with or with out and guess what no vinegar needed! ?? Thank You So Much for the recipe, you saved me from a year of shaming!

I used this recipe to make a large pot of collards for Thanksgiving. It was amazing! My son said it's the best collard greens he's ever tasted. Like someone suggested I used the precut greens from Walmart. I was nervous because usually I buy whole collards and cut the leaves off the stalk and then discard the stalk. The Walmart brand has stalk and all. But once I cooked it down, they were tender. While cooking, I did add some vinegar and sugar. Also I cooked on medium low for 3 hours uncovered to get a tender consistency with thorough flavor. This recipe really is as good as everyone else says!

I followed the recipe except I couldn't find a smoked turkey leg. Instead, I used turkey bacon. I also cooked it in the pressure cooker for 17 minutes instead of on the stovetop. It was perfectly cooked and delicious!

My grandmother made VERY good greens & with her being gone now, this has been my go-to recipe for the past few years now. The only thing I did differently is added more seasonings to taste & a few hot peppers w/ some pepper sauce. And I don't drain the juice off the greens b/c it adds more flavor w/ them sitting in it. My family & friends love my greens....

This is sooo good!  Way better than expected.  The collard greens were tender and savory.  I used 2 small smoked ham hocks (about 1lb) instead of the turkey leg and it was wonderful.  Just follow this recipe and this will be one of your favorite side dishes for Sunday dinners, family pot-lucks and holiday feasts!

Omg these greens turned out great! I did add chopped onion in with the garlic. I've made greens a couple times before using bacon to flavor them, but using turkey wings gave it soooo much more flavor. This is the way I'm making greens from now on.

Easy recipe to follow and so delicious!  I used part of a smoked turkey breast I had on hand.  I followed the directions except for adding brown sugar as one reader suggested.  When I planted my collards in the garden my husband told me how much he disliked them and I would be eating them alone.  After one bite of these he changed his mind completely!  YUMMM!

Excellent ! Tastes delicious! My only minor complaint is that the first time it was too salty, even though I used reduced salt chicken broth and didnt add any additional salt after the long cooking time it was just too salty for my taste. The second and third time I made my own broth with no salt and it was much better.  I make a big batch and then throw the leftovers in smaller portions in the freezer with plenty of the broth and it reheats perfectly!

This is the ONLY recipe I use for Collard Greens. I saw it on this site years ago, and have made it many, many times. The greens always turn out perfect, and my entire family loves them. This is high praise coming from someone who was born and raised in North Carolina! I had a lot of collards over the years, and these are the best.

Excellent and very easy recipe. I have made these twice and this is my favorite greens recipe. I haven't used the turkey in them, but bacon is a acceptable substitute. Being a Southern girl, it's hard to find collard recipes that appeal to my tastebuds, this is my go to one. Thanks for sharing.

Every time I make this, I am told they are the best greens anyone has ever tasted.  Sometimes I use smoked pork, sometimes I use smoked turkey, just depends on what I find.  It doesn't matter, this recipe is so great, everything tastes good.

Oh my goodness, thank you for this recipe!  This was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as written, only used 7 cups of chicken broth in case it boiled down too low, which it didn't come close.  Then like other reviewers, during the last 90 minutes of cooking I added 2 teaspoons of sugar and one tablespoon of apple cider vinegar.  These were not bitter tasting at all.   I did not add the peppers at the end because my family doesn't do spicey, but rather served pepper sauce on the table.  I saved the liquid to use with leftovers, but there were no left overs!

Each time I have used this recipe, it has had an awesome response from my family.  I did not change a thing.  Someone did suggest using smoked turkey wings and I will give them a try soon.

I tried the smoked turkey wings and they did not do it for me. I have gone back with smoked turkey legs.

Make sure the collards are fresh!  I used a ham hock instead of turkey leg.  Also added a medium chopped onion.  You don't "have" to sauté the garlic.  Adding one teaspoon of sugar will eliminate any bitterness in the collards (some collards are better than others depending on where they are grown).

When I went to pick up the items for this recipe the store I went to was all out of collard greens so I substituted 3 bunches of mustard greens and 1 bunch of kale for the collard greens. The end result was still fantastic. According to another reviewer's suggestion, I added about 2 tbsps of honey to offset the bitterness of the greens (1 would have been enough for collard greens, but mustard greens are naturally much more bitter). I also added 1 onion. I only made these changes because I used mustard greens, but other reviewer's did the same for their collard greens. I served this as soup and will certainly be making this again. Thanks for sharing :)

This is how I make my collards and I love it! I add in some sliced onion, and have made this with or without pork flavoring, but otherwise, this is a simple and delicious way to cook greens.

These are the best greens I've ever had. This is my go-to greens recipe from now on. One warning: I added salt when it said to salt and pepper to taste, but with the stock and the smoked turkey, it really didn't need it. Mine came out a little too salty, so I'll omit that next time. But that's my fault, not the recipe's, so 5 stars!

I tried it for Thanksgiving and I wondered (as did my daughter) how only five cups of broth was going to be enough. Sure enough, by the time I got to the last ten minutes in Step 2 (after stirring occasionally), the greens plus not only were burned to the bottom of my pan, but I had to throw out the pan, which was one of my faves.  I have looked at this recipe over and over and I didn't miss a thing while cooking it. I should have just used my own tried and true recipe but I was trying to go with something with less sodium.    I was truly  disappointed:-(

I've made collards several times before and I am always I'm search of a good recipe.  Well, my search definitely ends with this one....it was awesome!  My mom doesn't eat meat so I had to forego the smoked turkey but I did add a beef bullion cube.  I also added some green onions to the garlic and olive oil sauté.  It was a hit in today's Thanksgiving table.  FABULOUS!  I'll make this again and again and again!

Great recipe. Thanks to this recipe I'm officially the greens cooker for the holidays. For this recipe I added butter to the olive oil when I sauteed the greens.I also added Goys's veggie seasoning, and took out the meat. The greens can out excellent. Thanks for sharing.

These are some of the best collards I've ever had, if not THE best.  I have made these several times (in big batches) and there are never leftovers.  I plan on taking them to my family's Thanksgiving dinner this year and will enjoy the compliments!

Great recipe!  This is not my first time cooking collard greens,  I just really wanted to try something different with them and I am so glad I came across this one first! Very, very delicious,  my family tore them up! Husband was licking his fingers, my children couldn't stop complimenting me on the greens.  Only thing I changed is,  instead of turkey legs I used smoked turkey necks and I also added chopped onions along with the garlic. I will definitely cook my greens this way again!

I made these greens and I have to say they were delicious.  This was my first time making fresh greens. All the flavors worked together wonderfully. The only change I made was that I sprinkled red pepper flakes into my greens instead of adding a whole tablespoon. That seemed like a bit much so I sided on caution. You won't be disappointed with this recipe. Can't wait till I make them again. Enjoy.

They turned out great. Along with the garlic, I cut up 1/2 of a onion and sauté together. I season with garlic salt as well.  I cooked for several hours on low heat. About one hour before serving, I added five yellow chili peppers. I did not drain the greens, the juice is the flavor.

Not bad, not awesome like everyone says, but not bad. They are better than what I was doing with Collards on my own, but there is still something missing from when I've had it made by relatives.   "Pork" would be the easy answer, but I've had it with smoked turkey before and I still can't put my finger on what is missing. Or maybe it is Pork, lol.  I did add a little vinegar and I enhanced it with the Goya jambon (ham) seasoning, as another reviewer did.

Might as well go ahead and add my 5 stars to the group of reviews. I made this as well as another from this site using ham hocks. They were both tasty, but this is for sure my go-to collard green recipe from now on. The search for the best is over!

I've made these several times and they taste great each time. I do add some diced onions to the garlic for that extra punch. So easy to make but taste like you've worked over them all day. definitely a keeper!

Loved it! I substituted onion soup mix,3 buillion cubes and water in place of the stock, and use whatever smoked meat is available at the store.  My family raved about these at Christmas dinner, and they have now become a regular at my table.

I made this recipe because of all the rave reviews and I must admit, that they are well deserved.  This was my first attempt to make greens and they were absolutely delicious! The only modifications I made were: using 6 cups of chicken stock instead of 5, I also used 3 bags of pre-washed and cut greens, and instead of red pepper flakes I chopped about 4 jalapeños peppers to give it a little kick. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

Oh my gosh...this was wonderful.  I just recently tasted collard greens (my husband is from TX) so I wanted to try and make some for him.  This was so easy and so good.  Definitely, will be a regular item on our weekly menu.  Used Walmart bagged greens and their smoked turkey legs, helps make it affordable.

I'm a Northerner who has moved South and am trying to acquaint myself with a whole new cuisine.  Yowsa!  These greens are great!  I wanted a flavorful, lower fat version than what a ham hock provides.  This recipe nails it.

This is pretty good.  I  impressed my picky-eater boyfriend. he's begging me to cook more.  The only thing i did different was use smoked turkey tails instead of drumstick only because that's what my mom used in her greens!  I also always used one TBL of brown sugar to cut the bitterness. yum!
