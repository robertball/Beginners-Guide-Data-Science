This was wonderful, my husband told me it was a keeper.  I made a few modifications though, I kept the peels on the potatoes, I added cubes of ham and instead of salting it I added two chicken bouillon cubes.  I will make this again and again!

This is a great recipe!  This is the recipe that I have been making for years.  I do add a little garlic powder.

This is the base of my potato soup, except I tend to make a lot more!  I use real onion + onion powder.  Adding a packet of country (white) gravy adds great flavor while making it thicker, and depending on how much gravy/milk & water ratio there is, sometimes I don't need teh potato flakes.  Great recipe, easy and filling.

I felt the soup needed more flavor. And the consistency was more like soupy mashed potatos. It was quick to make but not my favorite potato soup.

This was good, I took another reviewers advice and added two chicken granules in the water and also added a clove of minced garlic. Before I served, I added seasoning salt, pepper, and onion powder to taste. Another clove of minced garlic, and a handful of cheddar cheese to the pot. I had roasted garlic instant mashed potatos (Betty Crocker kind) That added great flavor to the dish also. I think this would of been bland with out all the extra seasoning, came out great though. THANKS!

Easiest way I've seen, to quickly make potato soup. And it's not bad.

I have been searching and searching for a poatao soup that tastes like the one a friend of mine's mother made when we were kids.  We went to a one room school house and whenever Sharon's mother made potato soup, she would take me home with her for lunch and then walk back to school.  This recipe is it!  None of the girls had their mothers recipe and Sharon is deceased, so I never got the original recipe. I have tried many and nothing compares to hers until now.  Thank you so much for a great recipe.

This is so good and easy too!  I only changed one thing.  Instead of reserving the 2 cups of water, I replaced that with 2 cups of vegetable broth.  It adds a little more flavor and helps get more vegetables in my picky family.
