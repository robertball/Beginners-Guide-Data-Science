For some reason I've always stayed away from stuffed porkchops, thinking it seemed too hard to do or that they just wouldn't taste good.  I had some very thick chops and decided to go for it with this recipe.  I'm glad I did because they were wonderful!  I only had italian style bread crumbs but they added a very nice flavor to the stuffing. I added about 1/2 a cup more of the broth to the pan which was just enough to drizzle over the chops.  I would even suggest thickening it a bit to make it more of a gravy if desired. The family loved them and were very impressed!  This would be great to serve to company too.  If you've never tried making stuffed chops, give this recipe a try.

Never had a pork chop I liked until now.  These were fantastic with a few minor changes and we're now having them once a week.  I use only 2 thick cut (an inch at least) chops, half of a boxed pork stuffing mix, and an entire can of low sodium beef stock (about 2 cups).  I put a little salt, pepper and garlic powder on them inside and out before stuffing.  Also, when I have time I brine the chops for a couple hours before stuffing (a little salt and sugar dissolved in a large bowl of water and let the chops soak).  15 minutes on each side simmering with the pan uncovered has worked perfectly for me.  The stock reduces down quite a lot and any bits of stuffing that sneak out really do help to make it a gravy as other reviewers stated.  I serve them with roasted rosemary potatoes.  As the chops are so huge I can usually only finish half of one and they are just as good the next day.

I enjoyed the flavor and taste except I clearly did not have pork chops that were cut thick enough.  The stuffing wouldn't stay inside the pork chop and it ended up being VERY messy.  In the future I will make sure my pork chops are cut thicker.  I ended up making the stuffing into a gravy as it was overflowing anyways.  It still had a great taste and I look forward to trying this again.  The only changes I made were... Adding extra garlic power, adding extra butter to the stuffing and using chicken broth instead of beef broth. I will not be adding this to my regular rotation.

I could not find thick pork chops, so my husband and I sandwiched the filling between two thin pork chops instead.  We skewered them together with toothpicks and put more filling on the outside of the "sandwich" because we had so much filling left over.  We also used chicken broth instead of beef broth as some of the reviewers suggested.  Then we cooked it as specified, and it was wonderful!  Thank you!

SUPERB!!!!  The only thing I did different, was to add season salt and garlic powder to the bread crumb mixture, and while simmering, I threw some sherry in the pan along with the beef broth.  Mouth watering good!

This dish is sooo delcious. I usually don't make pork chops b/c they are dry but these are so flavorful and moist. Like something you would get in a restaurant. I plan on making these for guests b/c it will impress them without being too hard for me. Add the end I added some flour and water to the juice to make a gravy and served it over egg noodles. Thanks

This was delicious.  The only change I made was adding dried cranberries to stuffing mix.  It went great served with garlic mashed potatoes. Will definately make this one again.

Very good.  My only hesitation in giving 5 stars would be to first saute the onion to soften them a bit.  The dish was a touch salty and I even used low sodium beef broth and only added 1/4 t. salt to the stuffing.  Also, I didn't buy thick cut pork chops---but I should have.  I had a difficult time creating the pocket in the regular cut chops--I just used more toothpicks.  I added the remainder of the stuffing to the pan juices to thicken, but again, the onion would have been better if it had first been softened.  I think with a few minor adjustments, next time I will definitely give 5 stars.

I really liked the flavor and the general idea...but it reminded me too much of Thanksgiving.  The whole family agreed that although it was good, they prefer to have stuffing and white meat on Thanksgiving.

This recipe really is pretty easy.  I used a few less bread crumbs (the first time I cooked them, they tasty really grainy), and added some cheese into the stuffing (my husband and I are cheese-aholics)!  Also, I didn't have any beef broth on hand, so I substituted with chicken broth.  It worked just as well, and it gave it a better overall flavor.  This one is in the monthly rotation!

This was awesome! I did make some adjustments per other reviewers and have a few ideas for next time: I doubled the butter to 6 Tbs in the stuffing; I diced the onion really small and I LOVED the crunchy texture it added to the stuffing. Next time, I will add diced celery as well, or perhaps diced apple. I used an entire can of beef broth, and if I make more than 3 next time, I think I will use 2 cans. I turned it into a gravy by adding 2 Tbs of beef broth to 2 Tbs of corn starch. The stuffing was a little strong, so next time I think I will halve the parsley. I served it with asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes. Everyone LOVED it! This is great for dinner guests.   P.S. It takes more than 55 minutes for mommies and for anyone who has never stuffed meat before! It gets easier as you go, but I think I will stuff ahead of time to cut down on prep time.

Yum.  I've been on an allrecipes.com kick lately, which my dear hubby has had to suffer (ha ha) through, and this was a definite keeper in our house.  Luckily I had purchased some super thick chops awhile back and kept them frozen with the intention to butterfly or something, but when I found this I knew there was a reason I'd saved them!  I actually forgot to add butter to the stuffing, duh, but ended up just spooning a little broth into the pocket and it came out more flavorful.  I actually also browned the chops in olive oil instead, used 2 heaping  tsp. dried minced onions (none fresh on hand), switched to chicken broth and added a little white cooking wine to the broth.  Since my chops were so thick, I used a whole can of broth so that it was level with the top of the bottom layer, and then just flipped the chops every so often to keep them moist and cook evenly without the stuffing floating away.  Some of it did, however this made the sauce that much better.  They were so moist and tasty I won't be able to eat plain chops again! Served with buttery egg noodles and steamed veggies, my husband was a happy man!

Five *'s all the way!!! These were SOOOOO good! I didn't think I'd like these b/c I have NEVER had (or made) stuffing w/ breadcrumbs b4, but boy was I wrong!!! Made 2 chops for my fiance & I Th. eve. Other than my fiance not liking the sides I chose (i.e. french-style green beans & Country Crock garlic mashed potaotes), we really enjoyed dinner :) I did make a few add. to suit our tastes. For starters, I add. a couple dashes of garlic powder & celery salt (celery is a basic ing. in my stuffing recipe; since I didn't have any avail., this was a suitable sub.) to my stuffing mix. & generously seasoned ea. chop w/ s&p & garlic powder. I also used the full c. of broth called for. Even though my chops were big, I had a bit of stuffing mix leftover. In order to not waste it, I add. what was left to my beef broth (after I cooked/removed both chops), brought to a slow boil & whisked until thickened. Viola! Perfect gravy!!! Our chops were juicy & delicious. They were a little underdone for my liking (not for my fiance!), so I think I'd cook a bit more than 30 min. next time & also be sure to pull out my handy dandy WS meat thermometer just to be sure. Oh, and I had no prob. w/ my stuffing oozing out. I have a handy trick. Use raw spaghetti to hold your chops shut. This works perfectly if you have no toothpicks on hand (like me!). The noodles dissolve completely! Thx. for sharing your recipe, Karen. These are AWESOME!!!!!

mmmmmm, what a flavorful way to make pork chops! homemade bread crumbs (crushed to a fine consistency but not pulverized like the commercial brands) worked well here. i also placed 3 toothpicks at an angle into each chop then snipped off the protruding ends with scissors. the only modification i made was to use the full can of broth for simmering then (after the chops were done), i rapidly boiled the broth until it reduced to half the amount & stirred in 1 T. cut cold butter. this made a tasty, slightly rich sauce which really complimented these pork chops. thank you for this delicious recipe karen!

Instead of buying thick pork chops, buy a boneless whole pork loin when they're on sale.  Cut to desired thickness and, when finished stuffing, tie together as if putting the whole roast back together again.

This was wonderful!  I made this pretty much exactly to the recipe.  I used what breadcrumbs I had which ended up being about 1/4 c Italian and 3/4 c Parmesan breadcrumbs.  My husband gave this a 9 out of 10!  It was so moist and full of flavor.  Definately will make again!

I love this recipe. I have made it many times for company. one thing I do add to the stuffing is some leftover saussage when I have it. My only question is I never know whether I should cover the pot while it is simmering.

This was sooo tender.  I did make up stove top stuffing and filled the pork chops with it.  I also found after cooking 5 minutes on each side I then added the broth and cooked another 10 minutes per side and it was plenty of time.  My chops were fairly thick.  Delicious!

The original recipe rated a 4 for us.  The next time I made them, I made a few changes and they definitely became a 5.  Here's what I did for those who would like to know...  I brined the pork overnight.  It had apple juice in it, which got me to thinking.  I sauteed the onion and a small amount of celery (probably half a stalk) in a little butter before adding to the stuffing.  I also added a little garlic powder to the stuffing.  I doubled the amount of butter in the stuffing (to 6 Tbsp.).  After stuffing, I seasoned my chops lightly with salt and pepper, then browned quickly over high heat.  Instead of the broth, I used apple juice (since that's what the liquid in my brine was...NOT the brine itself, it's too salty).  Cooked covered on med-low for 15 min., then uncovered for last 15 min. to let liquid reduce a little.  Sorry for the long review.  This recipe is good as is, but I thought I might give some ideas on how we liked it better!

I also spiced up the stuffing a bit. Garlic is one of my favorites with pork as well as substituting chicken broth for beef. I did, howver, like the fact that it was moister cooked in the pan than baking in the oven

As simple as this recipe is, it made a great presentation.  I added 1/2 dried porchini mushrooms soaked in 1 cup water to the sauce.  Fabulous!  I'd serve this to everyone!

This cooked perfectly.  I didn't give 5 stars only because the stuffing was so-so.  I did add sauteed celery, onions, and garlic to make the stuffing meatier.  I grated some apple into the broth (chicken broth instead of beef broth) while it was simmering and the apple melted right in. I will make this again, but will play around with the stuffing.

The first time i made it exactly as the recipe called for, only I added an egg to the stuffing to keep it all together and used chicken broth instead of beef. Also, i made a roux for the remaining broth and made a nice gravy. It was quite salty, but other than that, good. Then last night I made it again with the chicken broth and no egg. This time i added NO SALT to the stuffing and that tasted much better. The stuffing that had fallen out of the chops and into the pan made it unnecessary to make a roux for a gravy, although i liked it better as a gravy.

In conclusion, overall it is a good recipe. My husband loves it. To better hold the stuffing together, mix in and egg. And DON'T add the salt. Trust me... If you want to, you can salt to taste afterward.

Disappointing after all of the rave reviews on this recipe. The only change I made to the recipe was to add sauteed celery and onions. I can't believe that would negatively impact the overall results. I can't say these chops were necessarily BAD. The presentation was nice, but they were too bland for our liking. Something about the beef broth tasted weird to me. I'll definitely try making stuffed chops again, but I'll use my traditional Thanksgiving stuffing instead and maybe try turkey or chicken stock instead.

I totally spaced out and forgot the onion.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly except I browned the chops with a tiny bit of olive oil instead of butter.  My husband asked how difficult it was to make, which I replied that it isn't difficult at all.  He said "That's good, because this dish is phenomenal!"   I thought it was good, but I think I'll omit the sugar next time in the stuffing - I didn't like the sweetness, and I'll remember to add the onion, and perhaps a little celery. Both of my daughter's liked the pork, but neither would eat the stuffing.   The beef broth totally makes this recipe, and I think a little more would be good so there's more to have on top. In all, it's a keeper with a little altering!  Thanks!

I used some additional butter as others suggested. Heat the beef broth to a simmer in a seperate suacepan before adding to the chops. Add it a little at a time. You don't want to drop the temp in the pan with the chops already cooking.

Tasty and easy.  I used leftover, homemade stuffing and added some apples and dried cranberries to it.  I breaded the chops lightly. Once the chops were browned I did tweak the recipe by putting the chops in a loaf pan that I added some gravy to and finished baking.  So, so good!  Will make again.

Loved this!! As a hint, I had THIN cut pork chops and I was able to create the pocket slit that they mention but I packed them with less stuffing than you would the thick cut pork chops (Less meat, less stuffing). I did everything else the same except I simmed them for less time as to not dry them out since they wouldn't require as much cooking time. I did 12min on each side. Perfect!

Listened to some other reviews, and made changes according to what I would agree with. Prepared with spinach and garlic mashed potatoes; these three together were very good. Simple like the recipe said, and impressed my parents. For me to be able to say that is something. Would advise to people who haven't even cooked that much. 5 Stars!

Great recipe! I changed this slightly.  I didn't put fresh onion in the stuffing as I wanted it to cook down more than it would have, so I just put it in the frying pan with the pork.  Otherwise I made the stuffing as directed. I turned this into a 1 pot dish by adding chopped up potatoes to the pan and adding a bunch of extra beef broth.  Then I threw the entire thing in the oven at about 375 to finish cooking.  The pork chops finished first so I took those out to rest while the potatoes finished cooking at about 400.  Once the potatoes were done, I added a gravy mix to the broth and made gravy on the stove.   It ended up being a really good dinner!
BTW, it helps if the chops are a little frozen.  They are easier to stuff/cut and less likely to rip apart.

YUM.  Loved these pork chops!  Like many others, I couldn't find thick cut chops so I went with VERY thin and rolled them up with the stuffing inside.  Since I had a lot of stuffing left, I actually coated the chops in the stuffing and that was just phenomenal.  The thin chops cooked pretty fast too, which was great.  LOVED it, will make again soon!

I am just starting out and attempting all different kinds of meals...this one is the best so far. Delicious and easy...but looks fabulous when done.  Only tweak was that the beef broth needed a can full instead of a cup and it ended up thickening up...trouble with the low/med...but it still turned out fabulous.   A++++ Highly recommend for anyone begining the cooking journey...you won't be disappointed.

I cut this in half because I was only cooking for two and it worked really well.  I had a bit too much stuffing, but I just put it in the broth and it made a yummy gravy to go over the tops of the chops.  Highly recommended!

Gave this four stars because I made several changes, but this is a great base recipe.  Used butterfly chops, and it was much easier than cutting slits, and made for less mess.  Also soaked chops in a brine for about 2 hours before cooking.  Made them much more tender. Used 1 cup savory herb flavored boxed stuffing, sauted onion and added celery to stuffing mix as well.  Gave it more texture and flavor.  Chops came out very moist and tender, could cut with a fork.  Will definitely make again.

Altered it a bit, still gets 5 stars. Every time I have ever made stuffed chops, they always come out dry for some reason. These were anything but. I did, however, use stuffing mix in a box (Peppridge Farm) and instead of one cup of beef broth, I used probably about 3 cups of French onion soup mix I made from a dry packet (the kind you make dip with). Awesome.

Added one ingredient that I really think made the stuffing more tasty: minced granny smith apple (I added an amount equal to the onions - about half a medium apple).

Very good.  I have a hard time cooking pork without drying it out.  This was tender and juicy.  There was a sigh of relief when I cut into it!  I used StoveTop Stuffing instead of messing around with homemade.  Came out great!  A keeper.

I love the idea of stuffed pork chops and this recipe was fine if you like alot of onion.You really taste the onion in this one so if you only like it in moderation use less onion,otherwise it's pretty good.

Very excellent recipe! The reduced beef broth made a great sauce for these. Next time I am going to try using diced apple in the stuffing, or even add apple juice to the broth reduction. What a great find - thank you!

This was easy and well received by my husband.  I used packaged stuffing and that made it saltier than we preferred because the canned broth was very salty too.  Don't overstuff them or the juice may not make it to the very center.

Very tasty and easy to make.  I used fresh sage instead of parsley and added cornstarch mixed in cold water to the liquid to thicken it.  Served with pickled onions and cranberry sauce and received rave reviews from my husband.

I REALLY LIKED THIS RECIPE BUT I CHANGED THE RECIPE A BIT. I DIDN'T HAVE PORK CHOPS SO I USED BONELESS LOIN CHOPS AND CUT THE CHOP IN HALF TO MAKE IT THINNER SO I COULD ROLL THE CHOPS WITH THE STUFFING INSIDE. I DIDNT HAVE TOOTH PICKS SO SOME STUFFING DID FALL OUT BUT IT WAS OKAY BECAUSE IT HELPED THE SAUCE. I FOLLOWED THE STUFFING RECIPE TO THE T  BESIDES DRIED PARSLEY I ONLY HAD FRESH PARSLEY.  I ADDED TURKEY BACON TO THE STUFFING AS WELL. I COOKED IT UNTIL IT AS CRUNCHY THEN CHOPPED THEM UP INTO LITTLE PEICES. ONCE I WAS DONE ROLLING THE CHOPS I ADDED THE REMAINING STUFFING ON TOP AND AFTER 5 MINUTES I ADDED THE BROTH. IT WAS REALLY YUMMY. I KNOW SOME HAD ISSUES WITH THE PORK CHOPS BECOMING CHEWY AND NOT AS TENDER. IF YOU USE MY TECHNIQUE AND USE THINNER CHOPS YOU WILL NOT HAVE THAT PROBLEM. MY HUSBAND IS BEGGING ME FOR MORE AS I TYPE. THIS RECIPE IS DEFINETLY A KEEPER! I HOPE EVERYONE ELSE ENJOYS!

Great recipe. I added a little more beef broth. I added  some mushrooms, a dash of garlic powder, onion powder, and a little dash of cajun seasoning to the stuffing. I also sauteed the onions. Tasted great!

This was my 1st time making stuffed pork chops and it came out very tasty! I made a few changes. For two thick cut pork chops, I used 1 cup of chicken stove top, which I ground into bread crumb texture, halved other stuffing ingredients. I first sauteed the diced onions in the butter for a few minutes then create the pork chop stuffing. Cook time important because I think if you follow the recipe directions, it's probably more likely to end up dry. I hate dry chops! I did sear each side for 4-5 min on med heat. Added about a cup of chicken broth and simmered for 10 minutes each side. Super tasty gravy, really good chops, this was a good recipe. I look forward to trying with other stuffing options! Thanks Karen.

Loved it so much I'm making them for Christmas Eve! I used apples instead of onions and man, it was perfect! Next time I will try butterflying the porkchop, pounding it thin, and rolling it up with the stuffing.  I feel like I wanted more of that amazing stuffing with the pork chop. Thanks!!

I just finished the leftovers from last night. I think this was really good. Everything tasted great, from the stuffing to the gravy to the pork itself. Although I think I must have cooked mine a little too long because I feel the pork was a little bit dry. I think that if I were to make this again, and I most likely will, that I would get thinner cuts, pound them out and roll the stuffing in the pork, tie them up with cooking twine and cook the rest the same.

I made this recipe as it.  I used at least in and a half cut chops and they stuffed beautifully.  You could easily pound out chicken or thinner cutlets, stuff, roll and toothpick.  I used old fashioned oats and made them course in the food processor, I do this with all recipes that call for bread crumbs as I have an intolerance to white or wheat flour.  So yummy!!!  You could easily add to the stuffing (cranberries, pecans etc.) This will be on my rotation of monthly meals, truly decadent for everyday!!!  Thanks Karen

Pretty good - although a bit salty.  The beef broth cooked off during cooking - I used white wine to deglaze with about 10 mins to go.

The stuffing was very tasty but my chops were a little dry. I think the 30 minute cooking time was a little too long for my pork chops even though they were pretty thick. Next time I won't cook them so long. Over all, a very tasty and easy recipe.

This is a great recipe.  I took away one star for the white sugar.  I don't et that -- there's absolutely no reason for there to be sugar in this recipe as far as I can see.

These were wonderful! I was the hero in my family for the night. These were so much better than the ones that I buy in the store and pretty easy to make. I did make one change and used chicken broth instead. Thanks so much!

I found this recipe when I was trying to figure out how to cook a boneless pork loin I got on sale. I cut them into thick chops (about 1") and cooked as directed, except I used chicken broth because I had it on hand. I did end up making a gravy out of the remains on the bottom of the pan. YUM!

Very tasty - sauteed the onions before I put them in the stuffing, and added 1/4 cup of red wine to the gravy. I removed the chops, added a cornstarch/water combo to thicken up the gravy, returned the chops to the pan, spooned some of the gravy on the chops, and cooked for an additional 5 minutes. Def. a keeper!

WOW WOW WOW! My husband and I absolutely LOVED these pork chops! We just made a few small alterations. Decreased parsley to 1 TBSP, only used about 1/4 cup chopped onion, & added a little celery salt & garlic powder to the stuffing.  We put cracked pepper and a dash of seasoning salt on the top & bottom of the pork chop just before putting it in the pan.   After the 30 minutes was up, took the chops out and added some water/flour mixture to thicken up the gravy and served with rice. It was like we were eating at a gourmet restaurant. Thank you for sharing, this will become a regular recipe in our house.  AND it was SUPER easy to make!

Very simple stuffing recipe and yummy.  The first time I made these chops, I WAY over stuffed them.  The stuffing fell out everywhere and having too much of it made the pork too onion-y.  The second time, I added just a spoonful or so into the chops and my previous problem was solved. The smaller amount of stuffing also made it so that I didn't even need to "sew" them back up with toothpicks (which were too much fuss for me the first time).  Definately a recipe I'm keeping!

This is a great recipe! I was looking for something different to do with pork chops and this hit the spot! I stuck to the recipe for the most part. The only variation I made was to add a few ounces of gorganzola cheese to the stuffing mixture. All I can say is, "YUM!" I also used a bit more beef broth than called for (a 14.5 ounce can) and thickened the drippings up with some flour before serving. I was quite impressed with this dish and I will definitely be making this again!

Outstanding recipe.  Don't be concerned that it will be challenging to stuff the chops.  It is actually very easy if you get thick butterfly chops and use a sharp knife.  I followed the modifications from reviewer dawnzkitkat and the chops came out amazingly flavorful.  I needed to add about a total of 1.5 cans of beef broth to get the most of the wonderful gravy.  Also, I prepared the night before so it would be easy after work to cook. Stuffed them and sprinkled a little Adolph's tenderizer on them (be careful this adds salt).  Perfect.

This recipe is great. I made these today and all the family raved about how tasty and tender they were. I bought a pork loin roast because it was on special and then I cut it into thick chops. I'll be making this again. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used fresh basil as another reviewer suggested. Great taste!

This was a very good pork chop recipe.  If you have thin pork chops you can still make this.  Just pound them out to flatten them, put the filling in the middle of the chops and roll them up.  Still use toothpicks to keep it closed so the filling doesn't spill out in the pan.  The filling was rather dry based on the recipe so I added in two more tbsp of melted butter and this was just right.  Dont make it too wet or the filling won't stay in place once the chops start cooking.  Add a little cornstarch or flour to the juices when the chops are done and you have a great gravy instead of au jus.

Wonderful. I used Stove top stuffing to put in the pork chops and it turned out great. I typically don't like Stove top stuffing, but put inside the pork chops was very good. Reminded me of a Thanksgiving turkey but with pork chops.

This was a great recipe for a busy weeknight dinner. I seared the stuffed pork chops on one side in a mixture of bacon fat and grapeseed oil in an oven-proof casserole. After I turned the chops I poured in some red wine and let it reduce by half. Then I added some beef broth and put the whole thing in a 375 degrees F oven until the pork chops internal temp reached 160 degrees F. They turned out great, and my family enjoyed them with steamed broccoli and baked potatoes on the side.

Delicious!  I normally don't do pork chops because they are always so dry, but I made this for my sister's family and it was the most moist I have ever had.  Her kids don't like anything, but loved these chops!  They are allergic to wheat, but it was very easy to substitute in their bread crumbs.  I did use chicken broth instead of beef.

This was great!  We were concerned about the stuffing not having enough flavor, so I added a little garlic powder, sage and thyme before stuffing the pork chops.  Served it with the Baked Sweet Potatoes w Raisins & Pecans on this site and it made a delicious Fall dinner!

I rarely cook pork but I'll make this again with a few alterations.  I'll add celery and sautee them with the onion before mixing the stuffing.  I also slightly thickened the broth at the end and it was excellent.

Great recipe! i spiced up the stuffing with some fresh garlic, green onions, poultry seasoning and chicken broth. I also basted the chops while cooking to prevent them from drying out. We loved it. Thanks!

Iwas looking for a recipe for pork chops and found this one right away. Everyone really liked it and I thought it easy to fix. Next time I will use chicken broth and a little garlic and probably make my own breadcrumbs. Thanks, Karen. Ilove recipes like this. Also will throw some mushrooms in!

These pork chops were really good, but I wish you would delete all reviews that make more than 1 or 2 changes.  They are reviewing their own recipe, not this one.  If they like theirs so much, submit it as their own.

I found two double thick cut pork chops and followed the recipe. The only thing I did was add a little salt and pepper to the outside of the pork chops. It was very moist and flavorful. My wife had a little left over and the dogs were psyched she couldn't finish it. :)

I had really high hopes for this recipe, but found myself disappointed.I began with two thick chops and followed the recipe almost to a T. (I sauteed the onions.) It was dry and the flavor was bland. I think the pork needs to be seasoned before stuffing it. I'm glad it worked out for so many others, but I won't be making this again.

I like the way the chops were cooked.  I didn't care much for the stuffing.  I did use this method a second time, only this time I used my own stuffing mix.

this was great it took about a 1 1/2 hr but we made 9 chops prep and cook we used store bought stuffing and added apples raisins and bacon to it i followed the cooking instructions for the most part just added my own seasoning cooked slow on a simmer 2.4 on my oven and turned up the heat to about 3.5 for last 5 min to thickin the sauce also made the pocket real deep and stuffed the chops to the brim let some fall out in the sauce adds flavor if not thick enough in container with lid add 2 ice cubes 3tbl spoons flour and a little bit of water shake well no lumps bring sauce to boil stir in mix and should thicken then they were a little sweet that was the apples but they were great

I have never had nor made stuffed pork chops before, so this was a new expericene for me.  I did not have any bread crumbs so I toasted some whole wheat bread under the broiler and chubed it up.  (It was too sweet for this recipe)  Next time I am going to use panko crumbs instead.  I added a nice dash or two of garlic powder.  Kept everything else the same.  This was great.  Thanks for sharing.

I thought these pork chops were bland.  I followed the directions but my family was not impressed.  They were okay, but all of us thought they needed more outside seasoning.

this recipe was a starter for me. because my husband only likes stove top stuffing i didn't attempt to make the bread crumb stuffing. my chops were too thin to cut so i browned them in the pan for 3-5 minutes per side then i put the stuffing on top and baked them in the oven for about 20 minutes. i poured the cup of chicken broth into the bottom of the dish too keep from drying out. (i made a gravy from this and put it on my stuffing covered chops) and this is one of the best pork chops i have ever made. i rated this recipe 4 stars even though i barely used it because it gave me such a delicious out come when i had no idea what to make for dinner.

This was a big hit in my house with my husband & 2 year old son! Everybody cleaned their plates! Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the stuffing was a little grainy for my taste. Still good, though!

I did not care for this recipe. They reminded me of those frozen meals that are drenched in dark gravy that only young bachelors eat. I would not ever consider making this again.

I don't cook often, but I made these for my fiance as a surprise and he was in love with them. The stuffing was very good. I added just a little bit of garlic powder to it because we both like garlic. They were very easy to make.The hardest part was getting the toothpicks in after stuffing the pork chops.

I used turkey chops, and only put the stuffing on the thicker side. It wasn't easy slicing and stuffing them, but so worth the time and effort! I used onion powder instead of onions to save time, and also a packet of Splenda instead of the sugar. These were great! My husband ate two. And both of my very picky children asked for more. (I didn't put the stuffing in theirs. The bouillon and extra flavor from some of the bread crumb stuffing that fell out flavored theirs nicely.) I will make this again.

I used 1" thick chops that were butterflied.  Even tho' I simmered them for a total of 10 minutes less than called for, they still turned out a bit dry.  The flavor was OK, but nothing special. I doubt I'll try this one again - bummer, 'cuz it sounded so good!

Fantastic. I bought butterflied pork chops and stuffed them then closed them up with toothpicks. Took a little bit longer than 30 minutes simmering to finish cooking them, but the taste was fantastic.. Great recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This was absolutely delicious and very simple to make!  I ended up having 6 pork chops in the pack so I used all 6 and had plenty of stuffing for the 6 without making extra.  I had hoped to have 2 for leftovers but my husband and oldest son polished them off that evening.  I served this with homemade applesauce and steamed carrots.  Very  yummy and will definitely be making this again!

I thought this recipe was a great take on a stuffed pork chop.  Very juicy. I did add sage and rosemary to the stuffing, just because our family enjoys those flavours. All in all, a very nice recipe for stuffed pork chops.

My husband has already requested these pork chops again after making them for the first time last week.  The only change I made was to saute the onions first.  I think the bread crumbs were a little grainy, but that wasn't a big deal.  This was amazing.  I did use beef broth, and that was just fine.

Great, moist and tasty. I'm kind of a slacker when it comes to measuring stuff so I made more stuffing than ncessary (I was also cutting ingredients in half because I was cooking for 2) so I stuffed the extra stuffing in a tomato (sqeeze/scrape inside out of it) with some cheese on top and baked it 400F for 20min. Also since I put a bit too much beef broth, after I took out the pork chops, I threw in some chopped onion (also cut too much earlier fcr the stuffing) and some sliced mushrooms and cooked for 5-10 min (till soft), threw in a dash of red wine, a teaspoon of butter, dried parsley and some oregeno (salt & pepper for taste too). I like it thicker so I put like 1/4 teaspoon of cornstartch mixed in a bowl with a bit of the sauce from the pan (don't put the startch in th pan directly, it will clumb) and with in 2-3 min it should thicken a bit. Yum yum and easy!

These pork chops are delicious.  I brined them as others suggested and also added a large clove if minced garlic.  Will make again and serve to company.

Very easy to make; I doubled the amount of butter and added garlic powder and seasoned salt to taste; Next time will try chicken broth instead of beef; Followed advise of another cook and basted the stuffed chops while they simmered and had no problem at all with stuffing being dry; Will definitely make this one again.

Haven't tried this yet but I'm reading that a lot of people can't find "thick" pork chops. If you have a Trader Joe's in your area, they have amazing thick pork chops on the bone. They would work perfect for this recipe!

These pork chops sure are impressive! They're delicious and best of all, easy to make. I didn't have beef broth so I just added a chicken bouillon cube. Also, I only had thin chops so I topped each chop with stuffing, rolled them, then secured with toothpicks.

Very delicious! Had only 3 pork loins so went with that. Used all measurements as prescribed except I used chicken broth instead of beef. The 'chops' were done to perfection (so tender!) by the end. I put the leftover stuffing mix into the skillet with another tablespoon of butter, about a cup more broth, and made a nice gravy. Spooned the gravy on the plate first, put the 'chop' on next and it was amazing. Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

So yummy!  The stuffing inside the chop was a little dry for me at first, but once I cut it open and poured the simmered broth and cooking juices over the chop - it soaked it all up and was absolutely delicious.  Will definitely be making this again!!!

This was DELICIOUS.  I had an extra cup of chicken broth I wanted to finish and followed many of the other reviewers comments.  

While my pork turned out just a hair dry, on my next attempt I may add a little more broth and simmer for a little longer on a lower heat.

This was really tasty and easy to make.  I did make a few changes based on things I did or did not have on hand.  First, as suggested by another reviewer, I stuffed the stuffing btwn two chops, since the ones I had were really thin.  Second, for the stuffing I sauteed the onions w/ about 3/4 cup of chopped celery and 1 glove of garlic minced and then added it.  Since I didn't have parsley and I am not particularly fond of it, I used some fresh chopped basil from my garden to season.  (turned out really fragrant and good).  Lastly, I used chicken broth, since I did not have any beef (including buillion).  The only thing was that because of how I used two chops it took longer to cook and I ended up baking it for 20 minutes after cooking for 15 minutes on each side on the stove.  I added the extra stuffing  to the juice, covered for 3 minutes and voila...perfect!

VERY GOOD!!! I thought that it would be a little plain but NOT SO. The only thing I will change next time is to use two thin pork chops instead of one really thick one.

I made this tonight and my husband and 8 yr old daughter, who is very picky, loved it.  I did make some changes. I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added chopped mushrooms and oregano to the stuffing.  I didn't use the salt or sugar in the stuffing, and I didn't need the extra butter or the beef broth because I grilled my chops. I rubbed some garlic, oregano, paprika, black pepper and salt on the chops before I grilled them.  I seared the chops on high heat and then slow-grilled them on indirect low heat for about 40 minutes. Here's a tip that was given to me by a friend that makes keeping the stuffing inside the chops much easier.  Cut a slit about 1.5 inches through the fat side of your chop.  Then open up the inside of the chop using a fan-motion w/ your knife.  You'll still have the small opening but will have a nice pocket opened up inside.  Fill with the stuffing. Cut some lemon wedges slightly larger than the opening in the chop and squeeze the juice out-I used the juice in a pitcher of iced tea. Pop the lemon wedge into the opening in your chop with the rind facing out. Your stuffing won't fall out and no need for toothpicks!

Thought this was a great recipe.  I added garlic to the bread crumb mixture, and I used chicken broth as others had noted.  The biggest difference for me was in the prep...I didn't have any toothpicks so instead, I make a slit on the side about 1.5 inches long and used the knife on the inside to separate almost all of the rest of it.  I would not recommend trying this if you are a newer cook since the knife can cut through.  I then put all the bread crumb mixture in through this slit and pushed it to all corners of the chop.  It was a lot neater and I didn't have to worry about the bread crumbs coming out.  Great recipe with ingredients on hand (except the beef broth for me ;)

The whole family really enjoyed the dish.  They all rated it a 4, because they said the chops were a little over cooked.  Next time will reduce time 10 minutes.

This was wonderful!  I usually am not a fan of pork chops because they usually turn out dry and tough, but these were tender and juicy!  My husband told me more than 10 times how much he liked then, and that we should make these the next time that we have guests.  I only made one change, I didn't have any beef broth so I used a can of condensed french onion soup.  The soup cooked down wonderfully and made a great topping for the chops.  If you are considering trying this recipe you won't be disapointed!

My mother in law was visiting and I wanted to cook something to "wow" her.  This recipe was bang on perfection.  I didn't deviate from the original instructions and they came out perfectly juicy and flavorful.  If you are looking for a fresh way to make chops (or perhaps even use for stuffed chicken breasts) I highly recommend this recipe!

This recipe is great. My only changes were: used shallots instead of onions (this is good if you don't want to cook the onions); added about 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese to the stuffing; used less sugar (only a small pinch). Wonderful! I've made this several times and my husband loves it.

Very good- I put a little less sugar in it than this recipe called for after the first time because I just couldnt get over the sweetness.. not my style.  The stuffing itself is very good though and I've made it several times now.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was awesome.  I did cook my onions before mixing them with the bread crumbs.  I bought some really thick pork chops, so I had to add a little more beef broth.  It made the best gravy, plus I cooked some extra onions for the gravy.  YYUUMMM!!!!

My family LOVED the recipe, will definately make again.  I added mushrooms & more butter to the stuffing.  3 toothpicks held in the stuffing just fine.  I added some of the leftover stuffing to the pan which thickened up the broth very nicely. Mine was slightly dry, will probably cook a few minutes less next time.  SUPERB!!

This turned out rather well, though I agree with previous reviews that the meat wasn't tender enough.  I bought chops that were already butterflied, which saved on time.  Rather than using the breadcrumbs and other stuffing mixes, I used pre-made stuffing left over from another meal.  It was difficult to cook with the toothpicks sticking up and trying to work themselves free, and I cursed at them more than once, but it wasn't bad, and definitely worth it for a homecooked meal.  The pandrippings were especially tasty, but next time I'll probably thicken it up so it will be more like a gravy.  Over all, not bad!  I'll definitely try it again.

My husband liked this one very much.  Will make again.  My pan "drippings" weren't much, so I added half and half to mine, and it made a good sauce/gravy.  Very good recipe.

This recipe is great.  I pull it out when I want to impress someone who tends to be a meat and potatoes kind of person (i.e. my parents.)  I cut down on the parsley and tossed in chopped apple and some garlic to the stuffing for a little more flavor.

We loved this recipe.  The chops were very tender and had a nice full flavor.  I thickened the gravy as other reviewers has suggested and will probably take another suggestion and add dried cranberries just for a flavor kick the next time.  Served these with baked sweet potatoes and green salad and it was perfect.  My husband generally likes pork chops thin and fried crisp (very southern) but loved these!  I will definitely serve these again.  I would consider these a good company meal.  Thanks for sharing!

I read one of the reviews that said that there was barely enough sauce to pour on top of the meat, so I put four times the broth than it called for.  I recommend adding more broth than just one cup, but four cups was too much.  The pork chops still turned out fabulously and looked pretty impressive, so I'm definately going to make it for company.

As others suggested, I added apples to the stuffing with a little garlic.  I also added some white wine along with chicken broth (instead of the beef broth), and as I didn't have any apple juice, added some leftover apple slices into the sauce while it was simmering, and then strained the sauce before serving.  Everything was so flavorful!  Thank you Karen for a wonderful recipe!

Delicious and hearty meal! I added a clove of minced garlic to the bread crumbs and instead of using a white onion,I used scallions.The stuffing was divine!(and pretty,too!)I,too,used chicken broth instead of the beef and it worked beautifully.This would be very good "company dinner" to impress people!

Very easy.  Both hubby & I loved the chops simmered in the beef broth, however the stuffing was just a little on the "plain" side.  I will season it a bit more next time.  I used center cut bone in chops, and just stitched the two together after stuffing.  Thanks Karen for the easy yet tasty dish.

I usually dont like pork chops because they are too dry. This recipe was a wonderful exception. I followed this as written except for using chicken broth. (didnt have beef) I only had 2 chops, so had lots of stuffing, so had to sew them to keep stuffing from falling out. Hubby and I both loved this recipe. No need for revision!

This was pretty tasty, and I think it was the first time I'd ever made a "stuffed" dish (no mushrooms or bell peppers yet). I made it exactly as written. I thought my chops were fairly large, and I stuffed them well, but I still wound up with maybe 1/4 of the stuffing left over. I was a little surprised at how good such a simple stuffing tasted, but maybe I just love stuffing. Oh, a large skillet is needed to accommodate this recipe.

I seasoned pork with MOrton seasoning salt, garlic & onion powder prior to stuffing. I sauteed onions and garlic in pan and then mixed it with the bread crumbs. I added cheese to the bread crumbs and used low sodium beef broth. I used some Corn Starch to thicken gravy after I put the pork in the oven to finish cooking.  Was very good but the husband said it was salty.

Wow, what a great stuffed chop.  Have never cooked stuffed pork chops before and really did not eat them growing up.  Now I know what I've been missing!  I did alter things as some others had suggested.  Trimmed off fat from the chops.  Added apple, garlic minced from a jar, and fresh parsley to stuffing.  Chicken stock instead of beef.  I used plain bread crumbs and followed the recipe except I also used coconut oil in place of the butter.  I wanted my chops to be browned more than picture shown here plus wanted to be sure my thick chop was done.  Cooked a little higher temp than on low during the 30 minutes.  The resulting sauce from this dish was yummy on my mashed potatoes too!  Will definitely cook this dish again and combine with a complimenting glass of wine.  A great cold weather dish, you'll love this one.

Delicious! I had 2 butterflied chops and I just put toothpicks in the sides and packed it with stuffing. I finely chopped the onion and actually thought that the tiny bit of crunch added to the stuffing. Served with Goat Cheese Mashed Potatoes.

I had a little trouble getting the stuffing to stay in (maybe I needed more toothpicks), but I found these to be very flavorful and moist. Even as leftovers the next day, I really enjoyed them!

I used about half cubes and half crumbs for the stuffing. I cut small holes in the chops and widened it out inside so the stuffing wouldn't fall out. That worked well. I thought the stuffing had good flavor and I followed the rest of the directions, but the pork chops were still kind of chewy, not very tender. That's why I don't usually make pork chops. Maybe if you simmered this for an hour or two instead of just 30 minutes, they would become more tender.

I had 3 1" chops so thought I'd try this recipe.  It turned out very well.  My hubby liked it.  All I had on hand were Italian Bread crumbs so I added a little garlic powder.  Kudo's to you Karen.  I will definately use again.

I love this because it is so EASY! It was delicious. I added some Italian seasoning and garlic powder and seasoned the pork chops on the outside before searing. Don't worry if stuffing falls out during cooking--it thickened the beef stock into a great sauce.

This recipe was great! I added my own little twist to it, like making cornbread first to use as breadcrumbs in my stuffing. I diced 1/3 cup of onion, green pepper, and celery for the stuffing and didn't use any sugar (it will have a sweet taste from the cornbread). Also I didn't use pork chops but a boneless pork loin that I butterflied, put stuffing in and folded close using toothpicks to keep it closed during cooking. And last I used chicken broth instead of beef broth. Thanks much for your tasty recipe!!!

I made this special for my husband and he LOVED it. He kept asking what was in it. I followed the directions exactly. In the future I would add no salt. I felt it was a little salty.

I don't like onions in this meal, but a little onion powder works wonders. I also add a little garlic powder. Juicy and tasty!

Most, delicious and so easy!  We made an extra chop and fried it up in fried rice the next day!  My SO has always been afraid of pork, but not anymore!

I used boneless pork chops as that was what I had on hand.  They were very thick so it was easy to filet and stuff them.  They came out very tender and delicious.  We enjoyed this recipe very much.  I also added a handful of romano cheese to the stuffing for some extra flavor.

This was my first attempt at stuffed porkchops, I've always been scared to try them because they seem so difficult, but this wasn't at all!  I followed it exactly as stated, except I did have to keep adding a little bit more broth to the pan as it cooked...with the leftover broth and "stuffing" in the pan, I added a little cornstarch and water and made a kind of dark gravy that I poured over the chops before serving...AMAZING.

This was excellent, and the surprise was the taste coming from being simmered in beef broth. I would have liked the stuffing to be less wet, but the taste was very good all the same.

Enjoyed them very much.  Husband really liked them.  Substituted Italian bread crumbs, which gave it a great flavor.  Cooked an extra 30 minutes for tenderness.

fantastic. The whole family loved it. Will definitely make again. Added some of that Johnny's garlic seasoning to the crumbs and I did increase the beef broth to 2 cups. Just used a couple bullion cubes and water, worked great. And the juices left in the pan make amazing gravy, just add some flour and a little milk and serve over the pork chops. A++

These pork chops turned out so tender and flavorful !!! Never cooked stuffed pork chops this way before but I will definitely be using this method again. All that I did differently was to saute the onions in butter first as another member suggested and I didn't really care for the sugar so I will leave it out next time.

A very good recipe, the only way I will ever eat stuffed pork chops! I tweaked it slightly in the following ways: sautee the onions in the butter before adding then to the stuffing, and add Marsala wine to the beef broth...it adds a special touch of flavor!

I found this a bit difficult to prepare. My pork chops were difficult to cut so I pounded them flat and folded them over. I found it hard to cook and flip the chops in a pan with the toothpicks in them. I'm sure they would have been good had they cooked better. Maybe I'll bake them next time.

Although I really hate to give a bad rating, I must agree with other cooks about the stuffing being very dry, and not sticking together at all. The porkchops themselves were very juicy and tender, but getting to the dry stuffing in the middle took away from the rest. I don't think I will try another stuffed pork chop recipe again, but thanks for sharing.

This was a bland, tasteless pork chop.  I'm not sure why it received such good reviews.  I will never make this again since I was utterly disappointed.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and made no adjustments.  My husband agreed; the pork chops we grilled two nights early with just a sprinkling of salt, pepper, and garlic powder were above and beyond better than this recipe.

I made the recipe exactly as written last night for dinner and was disappointed.  Although the pork chop was very tasty, the stuffing was extremely dry and did not hold together.  I will try the recipe again stuffing the pork chops with  a homemade herb stuffing or Pepperidge Farm herb stuffing.

I made this 2 nights ago and it was awesome!  I did two things different though.. I had no dried Parsley, so I didnt use it, and I only had chicken broth so I used that instead of the beef broth. I do think this would be even better with the beef broth though.

These were ok, I followed the recipe but I think I may have over stuffed them, the filling fell out making it look ugly and they seemed like they were swimming in broth. They tasted fine though and were moist, I was not able to make a regular gravy like others were since alot of the filling fell out. I put the leftovers stuff from the pan in a blender, blended all together and then back in the pan with a little butter, this was delish served over our chops. I will try this again. I gave 3 stars because I was dissappointed with the filling falling out, not the fault of KAREN....

This recipe is great! I did everything exact and the chops came out very moist and flavorful. I forgot to buy toothpicks, but I was just very careful when placing/ flipping in the pan and I lost very little stuffing. I added some flour to the beef broth to make it more gravy-like and it was fabulous! It tasted real good on the mashed potatoes and broccoli I made too! The only thing my husband suggested for next time is that I baste the chops while they're simmering because the inside stuffing was still kind of dry.

This recipe was delicious.  I would suggest just a little less beef broth, my pork chops were swimming in that much (I made 8 chops), added some of my own spices, and used instant stuffing to make it faster, but it is a recipe I will keep using.  Lots of flavor and easy to make

i love this recipe. ive made it twice now. although i have cheated and used boxed stuffing. i think i will at some point make it from scratch. my only critique of it is that i believe you could use a little more beef broth that is low in sodium. this last time i made it i added cream of mushroom soup at the end of the cook cycle and that made it phenomanal. one of the best recipes ive ever made.

The beef broth and the pork juices were the yummiest.  My hubby thought the sweet stuffing was the yummiest....I guess we could'nt go wrong with this recipe!  Very easy too.

I adjusted the servings to 6 and made accordingly.  My first bite was salt overload!  I think I could've have used the original amount of salt and pepper, and that might have been a bit much.  However, my guests raved about it, so I did 4 stars.  I simmered for 5 minutes longer since it took a few minutes for my "sauce" to get to a simmering point.  I used a whole can of beef broth and a whole can of condensed French Onion (split between two pans).  Also added some flour at the end to make a gravy of the sauce.  The flavor was excellent and the pork tender.  Just next time I'll use much less salt and pepper.

These chops were AMAZING!!!  I put them together last night and then refridgerated and cooked them tonight!  So Simple!  I did use fresh parsley instead of dry and think that did make a difference.  This is a must try!!!

Rating the method more than the recipe here.  I made stuffed chops last night, but had never done it, so I used the method here of frying and then adding broth to finish.  I used my own stuffing recipe, and added mushrooms to the broth.  After chops were done, removed them from the broth and thickened it with a little corn starch for more gravy consistency.  Very tasty, and thanks much for the inspiration.  My first attempt at stuffed chops turned out very well!

Loved this recipe. It was a big hit with my family. I did add about a 1/2 cup parmesean cheese to the bread crumb mixture, and used a whole can of beef broth. I also added the remaining bread crumb mixture to the gravy for added thickness. Very, very good!

This recipe worked out very well! It's a great starter for those who rarely or never have worked with pork chops. These turned out quite moist, and I used the drippings to make a gravy too (just add a little flour and milk to thicken), which turned out wonderful. Thanks!

This is the first time I've made pork chops that didn't come out too dry. They were delicious and thanks to a few reviewers, I thickened the sauce a little with flour and it made a great tasting gravy.

I loved this recipe.  I've only been cooking for about a year and try different recipes every night.  I love this one.  I cut down on the butter because I try to stay on the lean side, but I don't think it made any difference.  I loved this and have gone back to it many times now.

This recipe was EXCELLENT! I made only four pork chops and used all of the stuffing, so I overstuffed mine a bit. But they great! Cooking them in the butter, and then in the beef broth I wasn't so sure about, but it gave them SO MUCH flavor! I love this recipe.

I used pre-stuffed chops from the grocery store, so can't say anything about the stuffing. I can comment on the cooking method...
After browning the chops, I added a little garlic powder and cognac to pan with the beef broth. Chops were moist and very tasty! Will make them again.

My husband loves these chops, I did add monterey jack cheese to give it a gooey treat.  I alternate between the recipe and this addition.  I also use more water and broth to keep them from drying out.
All in all it is a big hit in my house for a few years now.

I have long been afraid of pork chops.  Mine normally look and taste like shoe leather!  These were tender and delicious!  I did add both cooked celery and a cooked diced apple to the stuffing mixture, and added a little red wine and flour to make a gravy.  Delicious!

In the past I stayed away from stuffed pork chops but I sure am glad I tried this one.  It was very easy to make and even easier than I thought it would be to stuff the chops.  The only changes I made were that I used seasoned bread crumbs because that is what I had on hand, added a little extra butter and celery to the stuffing mix, and used a can of low sodium beef broth in the pan to cook the chops (more than the 1 cup listed).  The flavor was excellent and didn't overpower the pork and the meat was very tender and juicy.  My family devoured this!

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I ran out of tooth picks, so I just was careful as I turned them.  I simmered the left over stuffing with the chops and used it as a gravy over potatoes and the chops.  Only alteration was I didn't have parsley and used rosemarry instead.  Thanks for sharing!

This recipe turned out great! My boyfriend and I made it for my parents and everyone loved it. I topped the chops with the remaining stuffing mixture. When I added the beef broth, it made the consistency of the sauce more like gravy. It was good but next time I'll stick to the recipe.

my husband loved this meal. After his first bite, he asked "and when will you be making this again?"... I cooked the onions before putting them into the stuffing mixture and added 1/4 cup sherry to the beef broth. With roasted potatoes and green beans, it was a hit!

I made this dish last night.  I have never made stuffed pork chops before.  It was surprisingly simple though!  I took the suggestions of several users and spiced up my stuffing with sage and garlic powder.  I also seasoned the chops with Italian Seasonings before stuffing with the dressing.  My only downfall was not adding MUCH MORE MELTED BUTTER TO THE STUFFING.  I added 4 tbsp. instead of 3 and that still was not nearly enough!  I will probably double it next time.  Yes, there will be a next time!  The chops weren't dry at all.  In fact, they were very tender and easy to cut into.  I also added my left over stuffing to the pan and it created a great gravy.  Great recipe!

I really loved this recipe.  It turned out really well. A few changes:  Because I was entertaining 8, I did not have enough time to pan-fry each one, so I baked them all together at 350 and it turned out just as delicious. 

Also, I did not have enough onion, so I added a green bell pepper in with the stuffing and it turned out very well.

I had happy guests all around

Wow,incredible recipe! The chops were easy to prepare, cooked quickly and were very tender and flavorful. Following the advice of some  of the previous reviewers, I increased the butter and sauted celery and garlic along with the onion. I also used chicken stuffing in place of the bread crumbs. I'll definitely be making this recipe again!

This was average. I felt like the stuffing was to moist, and ordinary tasting. It seems as though the moisture problem could be cut down if the chops were baked in the oven (with the beef broth in the casserole dish) after being in the frying pan.

These were great! My husband said that they were the best pork chops he has had in years. Very EASY, very moist. A definite addition to the family recipe box.

I use extra thick pork loin chops and they always taste great! I usually add more broth so that 1/2 the chop is simmering at any time. Easy and the family loves them.

These were very good and very easy. I cooked my onions in some butter first, and instead of dry breadcrumbs I toasted 4 pieces of bread and broke them up in the food processor along with the other stuffing ingredients and mixed a few seconds on pulse.

I loved this recipe! Next time, I am going to use small bread cubes for the stuffing.  As others, I also used sage and extra butter in the stuffing.  I also floured both sides of the pork chop before browning.  Excellent!

Yummy!... I added extra butter... the stuffing was dry and I couldn't see how it would stay in the pork chops... so the butter was doubled and it was fantastic!

This was pretty good. I altered it a little.  We thought the pork was nice and tender, but didnt like the stuffing very much. It tasted ok, but was dry in comparision to the rest of the meal.  I also did not have any beef broth, so instead I used a can of french onion soup.  It was good.  I didnt need to cook the pork chops any more the recipe stated.  The chops I used were not very thick.  I was impressed with myself, because I have never tried stuffing porkchops and it worked well!

We made these last night and really enjoyed them.  I added minced garlic to both the stuffing and the broth.  Seasoned the chops w/italian seasoning too. We had some extra onions and stuffing that, like others, we added to the broth as it was cooking.  Used chicken broth and it worked just as well.  We doubled the broth and then added a T of butter to the broth at the end of the chops cooking.  We will definitely add this to our list of foods from allrecipes we love!

This recipe was delicious! I added sliced apples to the stuffing and I really enjoyed it. Also, I combined the remaining stuffing with the beef broth which thickened the sauce perfectly and added a lot of taste.

The very best pork chop recipe I have had!  My chops were very thin so I used 2 and sandwiched the stuffing between them.  I used tooth picks to hold them together.  This was a little difficult when flipping but worth it!!!!  Very easy and yummy

These pork chops were fantastic!  I've never stuffed meat before and I struggled with the toothpicks at first.  Then I pulled out extra long toothpicks(mini-skewers) that I had in my cupboard.  These worked great and my pork chops stayed together really well.  I didn't have the perfect chops for stuffing but they all turned out great.  With some of them I just pinned two pieces of meat together.  I stuffed them ahead of time and left them in the fridge for a few hours.  My husband came home from work  2 hours late so I kept the chops on low for two extra hours and they were still incredible.  Two thumbs up from my hubby and my mom (who had them for leftovers the next afternoon).

These were excellent!  I used Italian style bread crumbs and fresh parsley and added several cloves of garlic then followed the rest of the directions as written.  This was the first time I have ever tried stuffing pork chops (I needed thicker chops...although I just doubled over the thinnest ones).  They were very moist and my family LOVED them!  I served them with the Georgian Green Beans (this site) and Sweet Potato French Fries....YUM!

Wow!  I've never made stuffed pork chops because it seemed so hard but these are so easy.  My husband loved them, kids and I thought they were pretty good.  Probably won't make them on a weekly basis but will be making them again soon.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Great recipe! It was a bit salty... but that was my fault. Next time I'm going to use a low/no sodium broth or reduce the salt and use plain breadcrumbs instead of seasoned.  Also, I used fresh parsley and it looked so savory with the onions. Thank you for this keeper.

I too thought the stuffing was a little dry for this recipe. But what I did was changed it from homemade stuffing to Stovetop and it made a world of difference. This is my favorite Stuffed Porkchop ever!!

Very excellent - I recommend one variation...add 3 tbls of red wine vinegar to the beef broth.  Makes the meat a little more tender, and adds nice aromatics when cooking, and flavor.

I actually used a whole 2k chunk of pork instead of chops. I sliced the pork and added the stuffing (fresh parsley instead of dried, ripped up small chunks of crusty bread and some garlic).
Other than that I did the recipe the same.
The pork was flavorsome, moist and delicious and we will definately have it again.

This was a big hit with my boyfriend and his kids.  The only problem was that the stuffing was a little dry.  I'll definitely try the recipe again...does anybody have suggestions for making the stuffing moister?

This was a big hit with both my husband and I!  The pork chops were tender and the gravy was delicious!  The only suggestions I have are to flip the chops several times during cooking to ensure both sides absorb the flavor and to cover the pan to retain moisture!  I will definitely make this again!

My family devoured this recipe. The pork was not dry and it had so much flavor. I simply used a portion of a box of herb stuffing mix and still added all of the extra ingredients that the recipe called for. Will be making it again!

Ummm....this was an utter failure for me. I only put a half of an onion for 7 chops ( left one plain for my ultra picky grandkids ) because the onion I had smelled really strong. I like the suggestion of cheese so I used 1 cup bread crumbs (called for 1 1/2) and did 1 cup of cheese.  My daughter in law said had to many bread crumbs. And the onion was WAY strong. I can still taste it! Next time I will just use stove top stuffing!

Delicious! I ended up using leftover garlic bread and puree’d that in my food processor for my bread crumbs. Did cut the cooking time down, this was absolutely delicious.

We following directions EXCEPT after browning, we added the beef broth and placed them in the oven, covering the pan with foil.  350 about half an hour.  Let them rest a bit.  Excellent.

I made the ACTUAL recipe. Very good, but salty! Some tips: Needs to be at least an inch thick chop. DO NOT ADD SALT - skip what recipe calls for. Cover pan. Med low, not low low. Like a 4-5 on electric stoves. The recipe had me cooking at a 3 uncovered but they were still pink after the 30 min called for. Highly recommend.

It took me no time to mix the ingredients and stuff the pork chops. Easy to adjust for fewer or more servings and by the time it cooked I was able to set the table and cook a side dish and make a salad. This is a perfect quick and delicious meal and looks impressive.

Needs more seasoning on the actual pork chops. I had to finish cooking these in the oven for another 30 minutes due to them still being undercooked.

Haven't made these in years and forgot how good they really were.Had thick,  boneless pork chops from Costco - followed the recipe but added a bit more garlic powder and 1 rib finely diced celery.  I used toothpicks to skewer my chops closed while baking them.  OMG - were they ever good.

We all loved these pork chops, even my picky 8 year old.  Made almost as written, except I sauteed the onions and added a little marsala to the beef broth.  I wasn't sure if I was supposed to simmer covered or uncovered, so I covered for all but the last 5 mins.  Pork was very tender and the flavor was fantastic.

I have prepared before and just HAD to prepare again! One of the BEST stuffed pork chop recipe around! All I changed was to add a few more spices to the stuffing such as a little curry, oregano, garlic and basil. It really brought out the juicy sweetness in the meat and complemented the entire dish! I did use extra beef broth too due to the size of the chops I used. Next time I may try chicken broth with a little white wine. Mmmm sensational and so yummy! Leftovers for hubby and me tonight too!

I just found this recipe tonight. Like everyone, always looking for a way to make pork chops so they are not dry. I followed the recipe to the T, however after it was done cooking, I took the pork chops out of the pan, drained the drippings, added 2 tablespoons of butter and  a tablespoon of flour. This made a thicker sauce for the chops! Just excellent!

Good! Will make again, BUT next time I'm going to pre-cook the onion before adding it to the stuffing mixture. The onion didn't cook enough and over powered the flavor of the stuffing. I think cooking it slightly before stuffing the pork chops would help.

These were amazing!  I'm usually a little nervous about making pork chops because they're so easy to dry out.  The only change I made to this recipe was to leave out the onion and bake them instead of cooking them for the full time on the stove.  I seared them on each side before putting them in a glass pan with the broth, then covered with foil and baked at 400 for 20-25 mins.  I turned and basted them once.  These had great flavor and weren't dried out at all!

This was pretty tasty & nice to have something different to do with pork chops. 
The onions were a bit crunchy & strong for my kids so next time I would cook them a bit longer. 
Had to use Italian Bread Crumbs & I used a whole can of beef broth & added red wine. Also added cornstarch to the broth in the end after removing the pork chops to make a gravy.

Turned out really good. I was out of parsley so substituted oregano and basil. Lots of flavor. Only criticism, next time I will saute the onion. Thanks for the idea!

Ok, this was good and very easy, but not the best that I've tried from this site.  I kept to the recipe, even though many made suggestions.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and that did add some flavor, and I stuck to the beef broth and thought it worked well even though many used chicken.  For someone who had never made stuffed chops, this is a great one to start off with.  If I make again, I'll probably add some celery and make more broth in order to make a gravy to spoon over the chops.  I think, I'll season the chops with some garlic salt and pepper before browning.  Worth doing again with a few changes.

First time I made these they were ok. Stuffing was a little dry so the second time I added more butter to the crumb mixture. And I basted them a lot. Much better w these minor changes

the things I did differently was to omit the sugar and salt (I substituted garlic powder), used italian style bread crumbs, used chicken broth instead of beef (as it's all I had on hand, and it's not low sodium hence the reason I omitted the salt) and I added some grated parmesan cheese (the one you get in the bottle) to the bread crumb mixture before I stuffed the chops (about 1/4 cup) 

I only gave it a 4 because I do NOT eat pork, but my husband begged me to make pork chops, this may not have been what he had in mind but he LOVED them and I got the benefit of not having to experience the pork "after taste"

Excellent! Made just a few changes as others recommended: added garlic powder and season salt to stuffing mixture, simmered pork chops in beef broth and a splash of white wine, mixed leftover stuffing in pan juices and used as a gravy. Delicious!

Moist and delicious!  I made a significant change to the recipe, simply due to the lack of ingredients.  I used a box of cornbread stove top stuffing and "dressed" it up by adding 3 links of Italian sausage, cooked and crumbled, and a handful of dried cranberries.  As suggested, I seasoned the chops with garlic powder and black pepper, then stuffed with my faux stuffing.  Used chicken broth to simmer.  It was delicious!!  Served with baked apples and mashed potatoes...everyone raved about the dinner!

I made this last night,and it was very easy and delicious!
The minor changes I made were suggestions from fellow reviewers: I sauteed my onion,added an egg to the stuffing mixture,used premade Italian breadcrumbs&chicken stock instead of beef.I served these chops with Bacon Cheddar Potatoes and Sauteed Kale.Thank you for a wonderful recipe!I will certainly be making this again!

Very tasty and easy. I added goat cheese and some allspice, cayenne and smoked paprika to the stuffing. Never stuffed a chop before, it's so easy.  
Also made a reduction from the remaining liquid; delicious!

I did not care for the stuffing. I will use regular chunks next time and not crumbs that were very dry. The cooking technique was nice and juicy with the drippings thickened with cornstarch.

Wonderful idea!  I used store bought boxed stuffing, added chopped celery and made it by the package directions in the microwave.  Stuffed my pork loin chops and used the directions here to cook them along with chicken broth made from a boullion cube instead of beef broth and it turned out scrumptious!  Will be doing this again and again, my family loves it!

Easy and very good.  A nice change of pace from our normal pork chop.  I used a vegetable boullion cube to make 1 c. broth since I didn't feel like opening a can of beef broth.  Worked great and everyone enjoyed.

The recipe is good but alot of broth.  I ended up using it all for gravy so that was fine but the pork chops were 3/4 covered in broth/drippings.  Still it works and juicy too.

Stuffing was off. It had too many spices and I think it should have had gravy to top it with instead of just cooking it in broth.

Stuffing didn't ooze out but it was gross.  I scraped the stuffing out and threw it away then just ate the chops.  I added garlic to the butter to give it more of a flavor.  Won't be making again.

!!Use Thick chops!! Good Recipe for the box, I used italian bread crumbs. My chops were not thick enough so I made pouches through the thickest areas. My only issue was that it took alot of time.

I'm a beginner but found this easy to make - I thought they were a little on the salty side but my husband thought they were perfect. I had extra stuffing and rubbed it on the pork chops before cooking - also I added some red wine in with the beef broth.  It was good with mashed potatoes which soaked up the extra sauce.  Will make again.

This is fantastic! Definitely a keeper in our house. The "what to drink" box said to pair with a Merlot. We'd prefer a Cab-Merlot. The Merlot was not the best pairing - a bit too bland for the dish.

These were so so so good!  I will definitely be making them again.  My husband loved them!  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  The only change I made was to add some flour in the end to thicken the sauce.  I made mashed potatoes and broccoli to go with this.  Delicious!

This recipe surprised me.  I didn't follow cooking directions, I used a cast iron skillet, and once I seered the meat, I threw the chops in the oven at 350 degrees, for about 25 minutes and made sure to turn them over half way through.  I think I'll make it again, but I'll be adding more to the stuffing.

I made this last night with some asparagus and roasted potatoes for my family and I must say there wasn't one morsel of leftovers.  The beef broth gave the chop such a good flavor and it was a very easy recipe.  Many compliments!

I made this recipe for my mother and grandmother and they loved it.  I did make it one other time and used Italian bread crumbs, which made it very salty.  This time I used regular bread crumbs and it was perfect.

The easiest stuffed pork chops yet! I've made this several times and I usually skip the extra salt, the broth has enough for me. Thanks for sharing!

Great porkchops. They were moist, full of flavor and looked 5  star restaurant quality to boot. I sauteed the onions the second time and it didn't change flavor. I didn't make gravy, but next time I will as these are a little dry. However, I used a can of beef broth and it will not be enough for gravy. I will take someones previous advice of adding sherry wine or red wine. Thanks for such a wonderful recipe.

The original recipe sounds good, but I can't resist the urge to add my own touches.  I started by sauteing a pan full of mushrooms and onions.  I set them aside and used the same pan (with a little more butter) to brown the chops.  Then I added the mushrooms and onions back to the pan along with the stock and about 1/2 cup of beer.  I'll make this again, and might do my experimenting with the stuffing itself next time.

WONDERFUL! Flavorful and not dry at all.  I saved some time by using stovetop stuffing to stuff the chops.  I also used an entire can @14oz of beef broth, put some stuffing in with the broth, and simmered it all for 30 min. uncovered. I had it with green beans and twice baked potatoes (I had frozen). I will definately put this in my normal rotation.  I really enjoyed this meal!

Excellent! I never made stuffed pork chops before and these were very easy. The only changes I made were to add red bell peppers to the stuffing and I added some BBQ sauce to the pan in addition to the beef stock. Fantastic!!

We really enjoyed this dish.  I cut the onion amount in half since my wife does not care for them, however she said the onions were a nice blend with the stuffing.  It certainly pays to spend a little more for the thicker chops.

i would probably only have given this a tree star rating except that my hubby liked it quite a bit. the stuffing was too salty and could have used some additional moistening pre-stuffing the chops. the chops (although covered when cooked) came out dry. we "au jus-ed" them.

We thought this was just ok. The only thing I did differently was to lightly season my chicken with pepper, garlic powder, and ms. dash. I don't think the dish is bad, I think we just prefer conventional baked or fried pork chops with rice and gravy. Thanks anyway for providing an alternative to the "same old same old" though.

This is so simple. I am not much of a cook and with this easy recipe I didn't burn a single thing! The only change I made was using more butter. The pepper was a little heavy but they tasted great. This will deff. be repeated.

These were soooooo good. I added 1/4 cup chopped celery to the breadcrumb mixture, and sprinkled the pork chops with salt, pepper, and paprika before searing. I will DEFINITELY be making this one again. Thanks for the great recipe!

So easy!  So good!  Even my 2 year old son loved these chops! I did take some advice and add garlic powder in the stuffing.  The only thing I would change would be the amount of beef broth used because I like more gravy than the recipe made.  Overall, a very big hit with my family!

We just made this for dinner tonight we gave it four stars because simmering 30 minutes is way too long after browning the chops.  15 would probably be sufficient.  The changes I made was to nix the sugar completely and I made my own stuffing mix with chicken broth, melted butter, celery, onion and carrot peel and then stuffed the chops.  It was fabulous.  Served with acorn squash and baked apples.  Delicious!!!

Great dish. The only additions I made was to add a few fresh herbs and garlic to the stuffing.

It was great!

This was excellent. When I make it again I'll have to add little more seasoning to the meat for flavor. And will put less sugar in the stuffing.

I made this with a few of the modifications mentioned, cooking the onions, adding thyme, adding garlic, adding sherry to the stock, making a gravy with the sauce.  It was very, very easy to do.  It came out very tasty, almost thanksgiving-ish.  I craved cranberry sauce with it.  My husband said it was very yummy also.

I really liked this recipe.  I used all ready seasoned 'Pork' stuffing from Stove Top stuffing and it turned out very good!  The only thing was that the chops where a bit dry. The chops wouldn't simmer on 'low', so I put a cover on it and turned it up a bit and it dried them out a bit.

We loved this recipe and I appreciated the lower calorie count. I substituted onion soup for the beef broth and it was delicious.

This smelled so good when it was cooking!  I added two tablespoons of sage,  which was probably too much.  I'll cut that back next time.  I also forgot to put the onions in.  This still tasted really good, and I'll definitely make it again.

I didn't end up eating this, but my husband said they were very good. Both the chops & the stuffing were moist. I used chicken broth instead of beef broth because it has a milder flavor than beef broth. I made a nice sauce out of the broth to top the chops with. Next time I will definitely eat one!!

Pretty good.  I forgot the sugar so I added it to the mixture in the skillet and sprinkled some ontop of the pork chops before serving.  It was pretty good.  I'd make it at again.  The husband enjoy it very much!

SALTY!  The stuffing could also have used some cheese or something other than parsley for flavor.  Though they have potential and were easy (the 25 min prep time more than I'd ever need), although I don't think I'll make them again.

I thought this recipe was very tastey...I sauted the pork chops in fresh garlic and butter and then I just added a dash of paprika and italian seasoning to them right before broiling them in the oven.  Delicious!

This was easy and good.  I added some additional spice to the breadcrumbs and salt and peppered the pork chops.  Per prior reviews I added the left over stuffing to the broth to make a gravy.

I know a lot of people rated this as very good to the best but I found the flavor over-powering. Maybe it was cooks error, I followed the recipe as was scaled down to 2 servings. I don't know what exactly it was that I didn't like or what was over-powering, but I just didn't particularly like this dish. I will not make it again. Thanks anyway for the recipe.

Deeeelicious! I used butterfly chops (that's what the hubby thawed), added minced garlic to the stuffing, and simmered in roasted garlic chicken broth. It was very yummy!!

I made this for my husband and myself the other night and it was delicious. I added mushrooms to the stuffing and doubled the amount of broth. Once I was done cooking the chops I also added the leftover stuffing to the broth and it made a wonderful gravy which I poured over the chops and brown rice that I served as a side. The chops were very moist and we definantly plan on making this a regular in our house.

This was amazingly good and easy.  I took some of the other suggestions and made some of my own additions.   After simmering for 30 minutes I did notice the inside flap still pink.  So I put a lid over the pan and increased the heat for 5 minutes. All cooked and still very moist.

Not too bad.  Bought the thickest pork chops the butcher had, and still had a hard time getting them split open perfectly.  So instead, I improvised and pinned the stuffing between a regular bone-in pork chop, and a boneless pork cutlet.  I browned each on both sides before stuffing and toothpicking, and then followed the directions.  Turned out excellent, and was very filling.  (The family raved about this one.)

This was an awesome recipe. My husband loved it and now wants me to cook pork chops like this from now on. It was easy to follow directions, especially for someone who is bad at cooking. The pork chops were moist and delicious.

Easy and oh so good!  Instead of salt, I used garlic powder, and to sweeten it up, I put dried apricots in it.  Since there is so much stuffing left over after I stuff the porkchops, I cook those, then add the rest of the stuffing to the pan and make a sauce for the porkchops.
this recipe is requested almost EVERY WEEK it sooooo good!

My husband and I really didn't care for this recipe. We thought it was bland and the stuffing part was dry. I think that the pork chops need some marinade or something before you stuff them. I just used some black pepper and garlic powder and they were still a little bland, but still much better than the stuffing part. We ate the pork chops and didn't eat the stuffing. I think we just prefer something with a little more moisture and flavor. I did follow the recipe as written, didn't really have any "sauce" left after cooking. Maybe if you doubled up on the broth that would help. We won't use this recipe again.

I make this all of the time now, with two modifications.  First, I use herbed bread crumbs for more flavor.  Also, I crumble blue cheese into the stuffing (about 2 tbsp per chop), which tastes great with the other flavors.  Always a hit at my house!

This was very good.(the kids didn't like it though) I added a little extra melted butter to the bread crumb mixture to moisten it up a bit more. I did exactly as the recipe said besides the extra butter. This was something different for a change. Will make again.
