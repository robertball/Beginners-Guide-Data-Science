I think Bloody Mary Caesar would be a more appropriate name because that's what it tasted like to me. And that wouldn't be too bad if it weren't for the color; the brownish-green color was the most unappetizing smoothie color I've ever seen.  The Cook's Notes said to add ice, so I did blend it with crushed ice.   Yes, low in calories and fat, but I wouldn't go as far as to say that it's healthy with 892 mg of sodium.  All I could taste was the Clamato and a hint of lemon, but would never know that there was any spinach in this.  I like fruit smoothies, but I also like kale and spinach smoothies.  Sorry, I know that this is the first review, but this just didn't work for me, and I won't be making it again.

Granted, this isn't the healthiest of drinks, and the colour lacks appeal, but I sure did love the flavour. Perhaps because my Clamato is Mexican and has a bit of picante.  I prepare it a lot.
