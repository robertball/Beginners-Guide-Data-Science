OMG these  are so easy and really addictive. I used Girardelli brownie mix and smooth peanut butter since that's what I keep on hand. Next time I will double the brownie mix since I had lots of the filling left. I will experiment with making them miniature size too. These would be great for a bake sale.

These were delicious, and very easy.  I followed the recipe exactly as directed.  I did use all the filling.   Dropping by tablespoonfuls gives 8 full size whoopie pies.  They are a little too much for one serving: think giant brownie, so if I made them again, I would drop by teaspoonfuls and make mini-pies.

Brownie part was better than another recipe I tried!!  But they are FLAT!!!  Came out puffy but fell flat like I thought they would for a brownie!  I used a different icing/filing that is made from scratch!  Over all a good treat!
