I liked this. Instead of steel cut oats, to save time, I used an equal amount of quick oats. I cooked them in the microwave with 1/2 cup of water for 2 minutes. They were perfectly cooked. For the peanut butter I used Jiff Creamy Natural peanut butter. I didn't have Whole Foods brand available. I also assumed quick oats are not as hardy as steel cut, so I halved the peanut butter and maple syrup. I went to do the same with the brown sugar, but it just seemed like it needed more. I added 2 more pinches of brown sugar which may have came to at most 1 tsp. With the extra brown sugar and a quick sprinkle of salt the flavors seemed more balanced. I forgot how quick it is to make a bowl of hot cereal in the microwave. I may make this again as a change to all of the fruit flavored oatmeal recipes. Calories, as made in my notes, came to 1 serving at 118.6 calories. ty, this was very filling this morning with a hot cup of coffee.

I love oatmeal and I am always looking for a different way to prepare it.  I really liked the peanut butter flavor in the oatmeal, but, I was not a big fan of the maple syrup.  I would try it again, but, probably add a little milk to make it creamier and experiment with different sweeteners like honey or agave.

Our first new recipe of the year, New Years Day breakfast, hubby and I both liked it.  Made exactly as written except we used JIF peanut butter because we didn't have natural peanut butter...still very good but probably don't need the added brown sugar if you use regular PB.

My husband is a big fan of this maple/peanut butter combination but, I have never tried it.  I am a huge oatmeal fan so, this was my big chance to try this out.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I did use milk instead of water and I did not have steel cut at thia time so I used rolled oats.  I will definitely make this again.

I used quick oats because that’s what I had.  My son didn’t mind and ate it happily.  I also put a bad of jam on the side if he wanted it.

I followed the directions exactly, aside from using JIF peanut butter, and using white sugar and more maple syrup in place of brown sugar. it was heavenly, great consistency, great flavor, will definitely make this again.

I used old fashioned oats and made according to directions on box, including the salt.  The maple syrup, peanut butter and brown sugar made this extra special along with a little half and half.  I rated it 4 instead of 5 stars, because without the salt it would be a little flat.

It was way too much liquid, and turned out like soup. I had to throw it away.

I really liked the peanut butter and maple combo. I used crunchy peanut butter, and it was so good with the steel cut outs. Like a few others have said, I will leave out the brown sugar next time. It just wasn't needed.

It wasn't bad, but it was missing something special. I couldn't put my finger on it, Very easy and good but there are better recipes out there. Sorry.

I added a tablespoon of black walnuts.  The flavors all compliment each other, much better than instant oats.  I make a weeks worth and store in serving size containers for quick morning breakfast alternative.

I put less milk in it, put it in the refrigerator  overnight and heated it in the microwave in the morning. It's a great way to have a quick breakfast.

Interesting oatmeal. I liked it. I always have to change things to my liking. I cooked it in coconut milk instead of water, but soy milk would be good too. It made it creamy. I left out the brown sugar. The maple syrup and peanut butter is sweet enough. I added cinnamon,chopped dried plums, and walnuts.

I really liked this oatmeal, it came out sweet and tasty. I was able to taste the peanut butter well. I also did throw in crushed almonds and raisins.

Good recipe, just add milk to make it a bit creamier and it is perfect!

I rarely use peanut butter, so this was a completely new taste for me. Very filling, but kind of dry. I just poured hot water over oats (very soft and tender kind I use) and added peanut butter and sweetener. I'll try to add some refreshing fruit next time.

I have oatmeal almost every day for breakfast.  I'm looking for new ways to change up my oatmeal, new things to add to it.  I was intrigued by the peanut butter, so I gave this a try.  I made this exactly as stated with the only differences being I used rolled oats (not quick cooking) and Jif peanut butter because these are what I had on hand.  It was suprisingly good, but I'll have to make adjustments for my personal taste to make it great.  The dish wasn't as sweet as I thought it was going to be, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just not what I was expecting.  The peanut butter muted the maple flavor and sweetness.  The peanut butter also gave the oatmeal a wonderful creamy consistency, which I loved!  However, it was slightly on the bland side, not terribly bland, but bland enough that I will have to tweak the recipe.  Possibly add raisins, cinnamon, maybe add more maple syrup or walnuts.  It's a good starting point, though, and gives me ideas for different ways to serve oatmeal.  I'm very grateful for that, thanks!
