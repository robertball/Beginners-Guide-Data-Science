So good you could sell ‘em!  One of the better muffins, sweet or savory, I’ve tried in awhile.  I think a good way to describe these is that they’re sooo unboring!  At first glance they’re interesting and beautiful with all their “confetti” colors, flecked with the herbs and peppers.  And I think that because I used orange and red peppers along with the green onion and didn’t cook that mixture but a few minutes so as to retain their vibrant colors, certainly helped.  I used fresh herbs rather than the dried – sage, basil and thyme - and added them at the end along with the parsley, again so as to retain their color, but also for that fresh herb taste.  I also added a clove of finely minced garlic and some freshly cracked pepper.   I baked this rich, thick batter for 14 minutes at the high 4oo degree temperature and was rewarded with perfectly shaped, perfectly pretty muffins.   For a little gloss, after removing the muffins from the oven I brushed the tops with melted butter. Their appearance was an accurate indicator of what your taste buds could expect too.  Fresh, herby, bold flavor and, no surprise, rich and moist from the butter and sour cream – an exceptional muffin.

4.5 stars. This is the best savory muffin recipe I have come across. Very moist and lots of flavor. The seasonings are easily adjusted to suit your likes, which I did as no one in my family likes tarragon. No need to bother with the extra step of sauteeing the veggies. I set my oven temperature at 350 rather than 400 and baked for 20 minutes.

I give this 5 stars because even though I had make a few substitutes (didn't have all the ingredients at hand) it still turned out great. I'm sure the original is just as good, or even yummier, as my version.   These are my changes: Used all whole wheat pastry flour Only used 1 tbsp sugar No sour cream, so I used yogurt No basil (that never happens!!), so I added a dash of cayenne, chili powder, paprika & a little extra dijon Only used 1 egg Used 2 tbsp of oil w/the veg & herbs, but 1/3 cup of apple sauce for the rest of the oil  Sounds like it might turn out awful, huh? Luckily, I ended up with super moist, tasty muffins that are healthier than the originals!

These are so pretty, and very good, too.  Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't cook the peppers and onions too long - just barely enough to tenderize them a little.  I think the only thing I would do differently next time is to add some garlic and pepper (or crushed red pepper flakes) for a bit more flavor - they are flavorful as is, but very subtle, mild flavor.  You could use whatever herbs you like, and subbing fresh for the dried would be nice, too.  I would love some parmesan in there, too!

This is a wonderful little savory muffin!  I made half the recipe to try it out and now I wish I’d made the whole thing. I sautéed the onions and peppers for only about three minutes and removed them from the heat.  The additional ten minutes of cooking after adding the parsley isn’t necessary.  Instead, I added the parsley when I was combining the wet ingredients and vegetable mixture.  I baked mine for about 16 minutes.  These muffins are on the small side, but they are delicate and buttery, and we loved them.

These are wonderful buttery rich muffins! I added a bunch of red, yellow, orange and green bell peppers, minced, along with the other ingredients. I sauteed the onions and peppers for about 2 minutes, added 1 garlic clove, fresh black pepper, then removed it from the stove. I used all fresh herbs which I added last to the pepper/onion mixture along with the fresh parsley. I stirred this into the dry ingredients and ended up with a nice thick batter. I filled exactly 12 muffin cups 2/3 full and baked these for 15 minutes. Before placing them into the oven I did brush the tops with a little melted butter. The muffins rose up nicely forming a round shape as a muffin should. These muffins are prettily flecked with bright red, green, yellow and orange colors! The muffin itself is a light color. The aromatic is so wonderful -fresh herbs and peppers! The butter and sour cream makes these rich, moist and buttery! They are wonderfully flavored with fresh herbs and a mixture of sweet, colorful bell peppers which, to me, makes this into a 5 stars! The ingredients, direction, baking time and servings size were all spot on! I served these with, "Hearty Chicken Vegetable Soup I," which is also from this website! This is one muffin recipe I know I will keep in the back of my mind to go along with soup, stew or a hearty chili!

These muffins were pretty good.  We served them with soup and I'd not serve them as a standalone dish.  They were moist, but not moist enough to be served alone.  I enjoyed the flavor and texture.  Slightly crumbly and bits of onion&pepper added to it.  Nice colors, too.  Definitely enjoyed a savory muffin.  Thanks Nancy!

We always called these "calico muffins" at my house. They are sooooo good, especially hot from the oven with butter melted on them! A nice change of pace from your typical sweet muffin.

These were fantastic! I made them exactly as written. I served them with brunch, but they could be served at anytime. Will definitely be making these again!

These are pretty and colorful, but not my favorite savory muffin.  The peppers really overpower the muffin so much that you can't taste anything else.

So good and very easy.  I didn't have green perrer so I increased the red pepper and used fresh taragon.  I love savory and would eat them for breakfast or they would go great with soups.

Great recipe! For those of you who are lactose intolerant I substituted the sour cream with 1/3 cup of soy milk and 1/3 of a cup of salsa. Also, I used white onion, 1/2 teaspoon of dried parsley and 1/4 teaspoon of oregano instead of tarragon. They turned out great. Although if you want big muffins, double the recipe and fill up the muffin cups.
