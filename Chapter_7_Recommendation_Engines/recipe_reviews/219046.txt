I used a cheap cut of meat and half the amount called for (beef stew meat--hey, on a tight food budget!) and only a pound which meant a) I had to simmer my meat just a little longer and b) I doubled the mushrooms so I could fake the actual amount of meat I used. I used dijon mustard and I added a teaspoon each of dried basil and dried oregano. I did NOT add the extra salt as there was plenty in the beef broth I used. I served this with buttered egg noodles and roasted broccoli. Everyone loved it. There's just enough for someone to re-warm for lunch tomorrow. Very good.

This is absolutely delicious! The only thing I would change to make it a fool-proof dish is to use beef tenderloin for the meat--it cooks faster and is always tender. It's worth the extra $$ for special occasions. I didn't happen to have wine on hand, and substituted red wine vinegar for the marinade, and it added a nice tang to the roux. If you're not fond of spicier flavors, it's fine to omit the red pepper. This is gourmet eating--remember to leave a tip for the cook!

My husband raved about this recipe! I did not marinate in red wine, and the flavor was great without it. As other reviewers mentioned, I subbed dijon for yellow mustard. Instead of red pepper flakes, I used a pinch of ground cayenne. Also, this recipe can be completed with a slow cooker for 4-5 hours on low;  add the sauteed mushrooms a half hour before the end of cooking time. I found that the gravy was a little thin in the slow cooker, so added some corn starch just before serving. You will love this recipe!  The sour cream and cream cheese add the depth of flavor that makes this stroganoff "rich and creamy."  Thanks, sanfrancook.

Oh. My. Word. You know those recipes that you just have to try because they have 3,000+ five-star ratings, and they turn out to be AWESOME? This deserves thousands of five-star ratings!  I left out the red pepper flakes and added the wine with the sauce ingredients instead of marinating.  I used 1/2 C. sour cream and 4 oz. cream cheese.  I served it over Spaetzle noodles imported from Germany.  Simple words are inadequate to describe how good this is!

Very tasty and delicious Stroganoff. I used the rest of my Christmas Prime Rib, cut into thin strips instead of the chuck roast recommended. Sauteed the onions, garlic and mushrooms together, set aside and proceeded with the rest of the recipe, following the directions as written. Only sub I made was using dijon mustard instead of yellow prepared. I served over a hearty  home-style egg noodle and heard nothing but mmmm's around the table. Thanks for sharing a great and easy recipe. Will make again for sure.

Used a cut of top sirloin as that's all I had available without going to the store for chuck roast.  Stroganoff was very creamy and thick, but I found the wine marinade to be a tad strong and made the "gravy" somewhat sharp even cooking down for the allotted time.  I'll cut back on the wine next time and it should be perfect.  Very good recipe.  Thanks for sharing Sanfrancook.

Loved it even more before adding the cream cheese & sour cream... so next time I make this I'll leave those 2 things out.    I made the following variations since I do NOT like tough or chewey meat & didn't want to take a chance so I did this portion of the recipe using a slow cooker.  ... I used a beef round roast that I sliced 1/2" thick slices; (I used an inexpensive red wine -Terrenal Cabernet Sauvignon - from trader joe's) marinated, pat dry, sear each side in olive oil, then immediately put into slow cooker, saute onions & garlic in butter, olive oil, splash of wine, pinch of salt.. added to slow cooker along with remaining marinade & all the other liquids & seasonings listed... let cook 3 hours on high. When done, use all broth from slow cooker when following directions for "Steps #3..." ... the sauce was creamy & so tastey.  Personally, I feel the cream cheese & sour cream are optional when using a slow cooker for beef.  Tip: for noodles, try this recipe: Grandma's Butter Noodles by Momofaddy. Delicious!!

Best recipe I've found for Stroganoff! I used white wine instead of red and next time I'll cut the crushed red pepper in half. We love some spice but this was a little too much for us.

Definitely 5-star!  I've never been a huge fan of stroganoff--it was always something my mom made as something to do with leftover Sunday roast, so I have used it the same way.  And, for me, it's always been somewhat "ho-hum."  But this? Wow...I just made it with some leftover meat and my husband and I were practically licking our plates!  I can't wait to make it fresh, with all fresh ingredients. I also used canned mushrooms 'cause that's all I hand on hand.  If this only gets better with fresh, marinated beef as well as fresh mushrooms I CAN'T WAIT to make it again.  Thank you very much for this recipe SanFranCook!

We've made this a couple times now. The first time the spice was overpowering, and this last time the flavor was just bad. The meat had no flavor, and the gravy just wasn't good.

There are SO MANY ways to vary this recipe, that I can't even begin to put it all down.  We have eaten this recipe in some form at least twice a month since I found it about a year ago.  The original recipe is very good, but you can do it however you want and I promise, you CAN'T mess it up.  

--I ALWAYS add the cream cheese and sour cream before I add the meat back and I always use ground beef (way cheaper to feed our family).

Things to try that we have done and LOVED every time:

--Don't have wine? No problem, just don't use it and add a wee bit more Worcestershire....Still tastes awesome! 

--Spicy Brown mustard substituted for yellow and 3x as much!

--Too thick? Just add more beef broth!

--Don't have beef broth on hand? Just use beef bullion and water.... Can't tell the difference.

My husband absolutely loves this stuff and when I say "Stroganoff Night!", he actually talks about how much he loves my stroganoff the ENTIRE time until it is done!

P.S. This entire meal can be made in less than an hour if need be.  I never simmer for an hour at the end.  Just get meat cooked (10-15 mins for ground beef), cook down onions and mushrooms together (5-10 mins), get the sauce part all mixed up (20 mins max) and add meat back in, simmer while wide egg noodles boil (10-12 mins), and presto!  Dinner in an hour! :)

This was the best stroganoff I've ever made....my husband called it "absolutely delicious"! The only thing I did not really like was the flavor the meat took on from marinating in wine; next time I will not marinate meat, but will add the wine to the sauce...it gives the sauce some depth.

Best beef stroganoff ever!  I did a couple things differently.  I did not marinade the beef and I browned in a dutch oven in 3 batches.  I added the mushrooms with the onion and garlic and left them in the pot.  Instead of simmering on the stove, I covered and braised in 325 oven for 1 hour 40 minutes.   Very good!

SOOOO GOOD! I'm 19 years old and just moved out into my own apartment. I havn't cooked very many meals but figured I'd give this a shot. I followed the recipe and it turned out amazing! Everybody liked it, even my boyfriend who was a bit sceptical told me to make it again! 
I found the gravy to be a bit too thick, so I added more beef broth to thin it out until I got the desired consistency. Also, the recipe says it serves 8. I served 4 people with this and we were scraping the bottom of the pan, so I don't know how anyone could feed 8 with this! Other than that, it was a delicious recipe and I will be making it again for sure :)

Loved this one.  Will definitely make again.  I followed exactly and it was perfection.  A little warning though, I love spicy, I mean LOVE, and it has a kick... that I love, but for those who don't, you might want to go light on the red pepper flakes.

Very, very good.  A little bit of work, but well worth it.  I ended up making two changes: one out of necessity and one out of frugality.  I substituted white wine for the called-for red in the marinade ... because I didn't have any red wine in the house (or at least none that i wanted to open for the amount needed for the marinade).  I suspect the outcome would have been *slightly* better, had I used red wine.  The other change I made was to use the "remaining grease" from the browned beef instead of the called-for beef broth.  The "grease" was largely very valuable beef essence; it would have been criminal to pour it down the drain and open a can of commercial broth!  In any event the final result was a very tasty contribution to a potluck last night.  The crushed red pepper added just the right amount of zing.  Don't leave it out (I used the minimum amount)!  I poured the completed stroganoff over a pot of buttered egg noodles in a covered casserole and hit the road!  Yum!

WOW, this was yummy!  Pretty much followed the recipe exactly, except that I was talking on the phone and added a little too much flour which meant more broth.  Didn't care though, the gravy is amazing!!  Thanks for a great "first" for me!!

This recipe is FANTASTIC. You can use ground beef and leave out the 1hr simmer. I used sherry in the place of red wine and cooked the mushrooms (doubled them- I had alot) a couple of minutes after I put in the onions. Also used margarine instead of butter, Fat free plain yogurt instead of sour cream, and FF cream cheese. 
So good!!

Very tasty. Only had 1lb. of ground beef  so I used that and doubled the mushrooms to compensate. Still used the red wine, but not as a marinade, simply straight into the sauce. Reduced the red pepper flakes. Added oregano and basil, may have used a little extra cream cheese. Served over elbow macaroni.

This recipe was really good. I just fried the beef in a skillet and mixed in all the ingridients without pre-frying or marinating and it tasted great :) And instead of melting butter and adding flour, I cooked the meat in the broth. There was no need for a thicker gravy I think :)

I have never made Stroganoff before, but I was so pleased with the outcome of this recipe. My husband was full but kept eating. It was truly delightful! One thing that I did wrong was that the meat did not stay tender. Maybe that's normal. If anyone has any suggestions please let me know. I will be making this again.

This was yummy! To be fair, I did change it a bit.  I used beef shank bones simmered for several hours, shredded the meat and used the broth in the recipe.  I also used a little extra broth and milk to thin the sauce.  I used white wine instead of red, since I prefer the flavor.  I cut back on the red pepper flakes and there was still a bit of kick, even with approximately 1 tsp. I also added 1 Tbsp of red wine vinegar.

There is no need to follow the instructions quite so closely. I just cooked the meat, cooked the veggies together, made the sauce and threw everything together!  It was really good and this will be my standard recipe from now on!

Finally - the perfect stroganoff recipe!!  I didn't have cream cheese, and so I omitted it and bumped up the sour cream, and it was wonderful.

Husband challenged me to make beef stroganoff, found this recipe and tried it! Loved it! After browning the meat, I put the meat and juice in the bowl and later incorporated it back in. Used dijon mustard for yellow, and finely chopped most of the mushrooms since my 5 year old won't eat the slices! Made this twice and thinking next time might try it in the crock pot. Thank you for this delicious recipe!

This is an example of how to use leftover prime rib and also lasagna noodles.  I started the recipe with the sauteeing of the garlic and the shallots I used in place of the onion.  I also used less red pepper flakes.  Otherwise I made this according to the instructions.  It was delicious.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

This was excellent! I was too tired last night to measure everything but i put all the ingredients in with a general idea of measurements. It was seriously fantastic! Good beefy taste my husband prefers with his Stronganoff. Thank You!

VERY VERY VERY YUMMY!!!!  The flavor of this recipe is awesome ~ my four-year-old is even enjoying it!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe...made it as written (with the the exception that I forgot to save the marinade, so used fresh red wine instead of the marinade toward the end).  Still turned out fantastic!  THANK YOU FOR THIS RECIPE!  **Update** Forgot to mention I OMITTED the red pepper flakes from this recipe...my 4 year old isn't keen on anything even slightly spicy.  Turned out great even without them!!!

So, so good! I used white wine instead of red, left out the red pepper, and used cornstarch instead of flour since one of my dinner guests is gluten intolerant, and it was a huge hit. (Obviously over rice instead of noodles.)

Adapted this to make a mushroom stroganoff. I used a 12 oz pkg. cremini mushrooms, sour cream, tsp. dijon mustard,  4 reg. sized cloves of garlic, red wine, worcestershire sauce, one shallot, 2 green onions, and fresh parsley. Served it over egg noodles. DELICIOUS

OH MY! This was super flavorful, a little bit different than the ordinary stroganoff and really hearty! Use whatever cut of meat you want, but if you go with the cheaper cuts, just be sure to allow enough cooking time to insure the meat is tender. This one's a definite keeper... even picky husband was impressed!

awesome with some modifications.  I found I needed to add more wine and more broth.  Less cream cheese and more sour cream.  yum.

My husband loved this recipe!  I changed it as I wanted to work with what I had on hand.  Instead of making the mushrooms in the pan with flour, I used a can of cream of mushroom soup as a short cut.  I used the beef bouillon and added to water.  My husband is a bit picky about spice so I cut back a little on the red pepper flakes but he loved it so much that next time I will use the full amount.  I think that I will also use larger cuts of beef and cook a bit longer for tenderness.  All in all it was very delicious!

This recipe just didn't work out too well for me.  The sauce was initially too thick, I eventually added water and it thinned out. The sauce was really good before the cream cheese and sour cream.  The meat just never got tender.  I simmered for 2 hours and it was still tough. I did not like the taste of the cream cheese.  The consistency was really good with the cream cheese but the taste was not to my liking.  Next time I would use a better cut of meat, double the sour cream and skip the cream cheese.  Then it could be exceptional.

Right off the bat....I subbed. I used ground beef in place of the roast so I didn't marinate, obviously. I used only enough red pepper flakes to give it a tiny kick(maybe a pinch). We thought this was very good but I already use sour cream & cream cheese w/a can of cream of mushroom soup for my reg stroganoff & I didn't find this anymore flavorful or different at all. I think I'll stick to the easier version(mine) but if you're cutting pre-pkg'd foods out of your diet, this one's for you!!

This was THE best stroganoff I've ever had and I didn't even make it right.

1st I made it with some ground turkey I had on hand. It wasn't saucy enough and I was rushed so I just added broth until I got it the consistency I wanted. Next time will add more of the other sauce elements also.

I also used red wine vinegar as I had no wine on hand, and chicken broth because it was what I had and I ended up forgetting to add the pepper flakes (I'll add them next time). 

The vinegar, mustard and Worcestershire melded to a very nice distinct flavor.

I will definitely be making this one again.


Update: This is still my goto stroganoff recipe (so much better when done right). It's some work but sooo worth it the fam loves it. do yourself a favor and try it at least once.

Very good!  My husband really enjoyed this and it was great on a cold winter day.  The only thing I did differently is saute the mushrooms and onions together and then added the beef (without patting it dry)  I doubt it made any difference in the results.  Very tender - I served with brown rice.  Delicious as a leftover as well.

Holy cow, we made one substitution plain greek yogurt for sour cream well and used 5 cloves of garlic but I'm sure either way it didn't make a difference.  What a fantastic recipe.  Love love love it!  Can't wait to make it again.  No leftovers because everyone overate!

Really, really nice stroganoff.  I did knock off one star for the recipe as written as there is no way I would use 2t of red pepper flakes.  I used a 1/2t and you could still feel the heat.  Didn't have any cream cheese, but it was just fine using only sour cream.  I would also recommend adding some herbs, like thyme, rosemary and parsley.

I think the meat needed a little more marinating, maybe 30 minutes instead of 10.  Otherwise, pretty great.  Served over egg noodles is the best.

OMG this was amazing. So creamy and hearty. We followed other reviewers' advice and cut back on the crushed red pepper - we gave the skillet two good shakes from the dispenser, and it turned out just right. We also substituted dijon mustard for the prepared mustard. Followed the rest of the recipe just as written, using a cast iron skillet. Just be sure to watch it while it's simmering - ours started to burn to the bottom of the skillet. We served it over egg noodles and topped with breadcrumbs, with a little of the Pinot Noir we used for the marinade. SO good.

This was just the recipe we'd been looking for! I used the chuck as suggested by the original recipe and it was plenty tender. I also followed other user's suggestions and had marinaded it in red wine, though I think next time I'm going to follow the original with white wine to see the difference. I also added 2 tbsp garlic and fresh mushrooms when sauteeing the onions, and then added 1/3 cup of cream cheese when I added the sour cream at the end of the cooking time. The whole family loved it! There weren't even any leftovers!

I made this exactly as written.  It takes time, but the layering of flavors was very enjoyable.  The only thing I would do next time is reduce the amount of red pepper flakes - just our taste.  Otherwise, would highly recommend.  Thank you for the submission!

This was the best beef stroganoff I have ever had!!!  The ingredients were so flavorful and the measurements were spot on.  The only thing I did differently was I used skirt steak.  I find the chuck steak to be too tough when it cooks in the sauce for that long, so I seared it, and then added it in at the end for like 10 minutes to heat through.  The meat was very tender and the sauce was absolutely delicious!!!

Followed this recipe exactly and thoroughly loved it. I thought maybe 2 t. of pepper flakes would be too much but my husband said it was fine. The only thing negative I could say would be I don't know how this would feed 8. Seems to me probably four people but I guess that would depend on the serving size. I would definitely make this again.

very good, but VERY fattening. I would suggest using just a spray of olive oil for all the sautéing instead of all that butter, and low fat or fat free sour cream and cream cheese. ALSO…2 tsp of red pepper flakes is way too much. I used one and it was still a bit too hot. And I like spicy food for the most part.

This was excellent! I made the recipe as written. I thought it was perfect. One of the kids thought it was too spicy. I'm sure it would still be good with half the pepper.

This is a great recipe!! I left out the red pepper flakes as it didn't seem right for stroganoff to be hot/spicy. Then added about a clove more garlic, a teaspoon of dried crushed thyme and a tablespoon of parsley. This will become a staple in my household. My family doesn't like mushrooms, so I had to omit those, but it was still wonderful.

This recipe is delicious, although I do think it takes a lot of prep time. I forgot to put the sour cream and cream cheese in, and it was still delicious. I put them in the left overs the next day, and think its better without. MUCH less fat too!

yummy, all I had were low fat sour cream and cream cheese which were a little sweet so to counter act that I used a couple tablespoons of buttermilk.  Perfect!! My picky teen ate enough for another teen!!!!

I don't why I never thought to put mustard and worchestire in stroganoff so when I saw this I was excited to try it.  Very good.  I used cayenne pepper for the kick and that was a surprise.  This was good but not 5 stars.  I can't put my finger on it, maybe it's the cream cheese. I've never put cream cheese in stroganoff. All in all, it's a good staple to have in your arsenal.

Very good.  I was afraid of the pepper flakes and only used 1/2 t.  Still had a slight kick.  I think next time I will omit them entirely.  I like spicy food but not spicy stroganoff.

My family of 7 LOVED this meal.  I cut the red pepper in half, and my younger children still thought it was too spicy so next time I will just use a 1/4 of the red pepper.  The rest of us loved it with half though.  I also used stew meat instead of roast.

Wow!  Dee-lish!  This does pack a little punch, and though I like it, I will pull back to 1 1/2 tsp. red pepper flakes, next time.  I used 1 pound of meat, but kept the sauce as written, so there would be lots of yummy sauce for our egg noodles.  Served with steamed broccoli for contrast in simplicity and beautiful color on the plate.  Thanks for the recipe!

Great taste, but it was a bit bland. Needed more salt and pepper, and by using a heavier red wine, letting the meat sort of marinate in the wine longer than 10 mins. ( More as  45 min. to 1 hour).   Turned out great. Used chuck roast with plenty of marbling. The wine broke down the toughness. Will use this recipe again.

Followed the recipe exactly and my 17 year old asked why I don’t become a chef! Lol guess that means it was delicious. I personally thought the only change I would make is to cut down the red pepper. I liked the kick but it was a bit much for my husband. I will be making this again.

I did make a few changes and I will definitely make it again. I cut a few steps. Cooked the mushrooms with only one tbsp butter and one of olive oil. Set aside with the cream cheese and sour cream.
Cooked the meat onion and garlic and red pepper together and used one tbsp butter and one  of olive oil. 
In a separate pan I cooked the butter, flour, beef stock, wine marinade, mustard, Worcestershire sauce. Added the sauce to the meat mixture and simmered for one hour  then added the cream cheese, sour cream and mushrooms. Served over egg pasta ribbon .

Perfect recipe for hearty stroganoff. I use sirloin steak rather than chuck & only about 1.5 lbs but 1 lb of mushrooms as we prefer a lot of mushrooms. I use a decent/good Cabernet wine for the marinate/stock & it makes all the difference.

Was very good! I did put in a little less Worcestershire sauce and added a bit of Heinz 57 in place of red pepper.  Fed 9 people and every single person went back for seconds!

I have a big family, so I doubled the sauce to serve over egg noodles. I used Dijon mustard instead yellow mustard.  I substituted about 1/3 cup of heavy cream instead of the cream cheese and added a little more sour cream.  I put over two lbs  of egg noodles. It was delicious.

I made this for the 2nd time this weekend and liked it much better than last! Added more mushrooms and cut the pepper flakes in half. Used some sirloin I'd gotten on sale and let it sit in the marinade most of the day. It was good last time--this time it was wonderful!!!

Really loved this recipe.  I changed a few things.  I used a roast that I cut into 1/2' strips and marinated the meat with a Cabernet Sauvignon for 3 three hours.  I did not pat the meat dry prior to lightly browning it in the olive oil.  I then sauteed the onions and garlic in the butter and later added the mushrooms with. I removed this and melted the butter and added the flour and made the roux.  When this was cooked added the onions, mushrooms, garlic, meat back along with all the other ingredients except the cheese and sour cream.  Simmered it on the stove for about an hour then added the cream and cheese.  It had a wonderful flavor from the Cab.  Will be making this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

If I made this again I would cut the red pepper flakes in half. I used light sour cream and light cream cheese. I would reduce the butter if I made it again.

This meal is a lot of work for no one really liking it in my family. Kids didn’t like it. I thought it was good until I put the cream cheese in it. I don’t plan on trying this again.

LOVE - no cream soups...very much from scratch and worth the time.  I did not use the 3 oz. of cream cheese...it didn't need it.  I did increase the sour cream from 1/3 cup to 2/3 cup.    I also cooked the mushrooms the entire time with the beef.

It was really good. Nice creamy texture and flavor. Next time I will omit the red pepper flakes. It was too spicy for my children. I thought the sour cream and cream cheese would override spice. No such luck.

Great recipe. Very flavorful with a little zip to the taste. Actually used sliced cubed steak and let marinate longer just to make sure it was tender. Turned out so good!

I made this as the recipe is written only I omitted the red pepper flakes. I've never seen a traditional stroganoff made with hot peppers, that's a personal taste thing. I used a little over 2 1/2 lbs of top round London broil cut and simmered on low for 1 1/4 hours and it was very tender. I increased all ingredients accordingly. I prefer fresh, sauteed mushrooms. We also like extra gravy for which I used 1/3 cup flour and a little over 2 cups beef stock. It was delicious and will definitely make again.

I have been making this recipe for several years and never has it come out anything less than exceptional.   I will say it takes some cooking experience to make as a good roux sauce requires timing and patience.  People that aren't happy with the gravy or flavor are probably making mistakes during the process.  Prep everything ahead of time and just be prepared to stand directly over the stove for like an hour stirring and you'll be fine (and trust me its worth it).  I have never had a single compliant only compliments, the red pepper is a nice addition  as well and adds to the dish.  I usually make mine with chopped baby bella mushrooms and for the wine I use a cheap bottle of cab sauvignon.  I have used stew meat  as well as vegetarian broth and vegetarian beef tips (gardein brand) and both came out very good so this can be modified for non-meat eaters.  I have also swapped out the egg noodles for garlic mashed potatoes and that went over really well too.

This was the best beef stroganoff I've ever made. Naturally I made a few small changes but I'm sure it wasn't necessary. I used thinly sliced stew meat which came out tender, beef consume in place of stock, added green/red pepper strips to the onion/garlic mixture (to try to fit in some more veggies), and only cooked the mixture about 10mins instead of the hour it recommends. The spice level is perfect. Will definitely make again, so good!

The cream cheese was overpowering and took away from the rich sauce.  The beef was tender and delicious.  Will make again without cream cheese for sure.

This is not stroganoff. The real, original recipe is made with filet and contains only beef, onions, mushrooms, dry mustard, salt and pepper, and sour cream.  It is sublime.

Definitely watch and taste how much red pepper flakes you wish to use. I used only about a 1/2 tsp. I also used dijon instead of regular mustard.

Everything was fine until I put pretty much everything in the pan to let it simmer for an hour. I followed all the directions perfectly and when it said to cover and simmer for an hour I had my doubts because I thought it would burn since it never said to stir. But I wanted to follow all of the directions perfectly so I left it in the pan. I came back 15 minutes later and it looked good. I couldn't wait until it was done. I came back 20 minutes later and the whole thing was burned. I was sad and it was very hard to scrub. I saved a few pieces of the meat and they were very tasty but the directions never said to stir. When you make this I very much recommend that you stir it.

Beef chuck was tough. It needed to cook a couple more hours before it would have been tender. Would also cut the red pepper flakes, as it was quite spicy. Definitely use a better cut of meat.

I made this omitting the red pepper and mustard, and increased the sour cream to about a cup. I also put it all together, then baked at 300 for about 45 min to further tenderize my cheap round steak meat. It was fabulous. Great depth of flavor!

I did this in the slow cooker (add sour cream and mushrooms for the last half hour) and it was a big hit even with my pickiest eater.  When I made it again I will decrease or omit the mustard.  That flavor was a little too strong for our family.  I also decreased the pepper flakes for the kids.

This has to be the very best beef stroganoff I have ever made. The creaminess is outstanding. My husband raved about it with every bite he took.He's not a big fan of cream cheese so I waited till the end to tell him that it was so creamy because of the sour cream and cream cheese. Will definitely make again and it's the only beef stroganoff recipe I will use.

I tried this with left over prime rib. It was great.  I reduced the recipe to 4 servings and was confused by the recipe when it came to adding the amount of butter. Also I added more beef stock because I like more gravy.

I have looked a long time for this recipe.  I fixed one like this about 18 years ago.  The only thing different I do is use a small can of tomato paste instead of the mustard. Great revues before and now back again with this recipe! !

Such great flavor in this recipe! If you don't like heat I'd cut back on the red pepper flakes. Overall, a delicious, easy-to-make recipe!

Overall very good!  This was my first time making Beef Stroganoff, and it was an easy recipe to follow.  I did everything per the recipe except for 2 things.  I used about 1/2 the beef (so glad I did) and 1/2 the red pepper flakes (also glad I did).  My husband said it was still a little too spicy for him, though I was okay with it.  Giving this a 4 stars based on those 2 things, and when I make again, will use a higher quality beef.  It did get tender with this cooking, but we like the texture of higher quality.
The flavor was great! Heads up this does take awhile to cook, cutting the meat was the most time consuming and labor-some.  I definitely recommend it and adjust the recipe to your liking.

Yum!  Used Dijon and reduced red pepper and added more fresh ground black pepper.  Served with buttered broad egg noodles and parsley.

In one word, AMAZING. I doubled the recipe, as we were having company over. The only thing I did differently was halve the amount of meat to two, 2 pound roasts (that's a lot of meat that the original recipe calls for!), sauteed a little over 3 cups of sliced mushrooms, only used 1 tsp. of crushed red pepper, and didn't use yellow mustard (didn't have any on hand). The hardest, most tiring, part was the cutting and preparation of the two roasts. The rest was easy, peasy, lemon squeezy! 

The dinner table was quiet, as we all just inhaled the food (not the awkward kind of quiet -- the loud, fast, munching kind of quiet lol)! Everyone had seconds, and we still had enough left overs for lunch, enough for 4 people.

This was just OK.  I didn't think the time involved=how I phenomenal I thought it would taste.  Followed exactly.  Don't know what I would change but will probably not try again.

This is one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. Cooked exactly as the recipe indicated, only I sliced up left over barbecued sirloin - saved the time of the long simmering, and was absolutely delicious.

Loved this recipe! So easy, I had 99% of the ingredients in my fridge which is what I love in a new recipe! Is there anything worse than having to buy things you never really need more than a small amount of?! I used a roast that I had in the freezer, we cut up our roasts from Costco to make them stretch further. This was the little guy so it was perfect. Did everything exactly as mentioned and served over egg noodles. We skipped on the mushrooms since we have a picky eater in the house. Has anyone tried to freeze this recipe? I wonder if I make a batch (excluding the sr.cream and crm.cheese) and then put it in the crock pot at noon. Let me know if anyone has tried that! 
Thanks for the recipe! I hope more people try this one out!!!

I liked the taste using the wine. For me though I knew that amount of red pepper was to much. I omitted it and used a dash cayenne pepper.And I also used stew meat beef. It was not tender enough after an hour. Next time I think I will use a better cut of meat or shaved steak or hamburger. And I think the cream cheese takes away from the flavor to much. maybe half of that amount next time.Great tasting ,but lots of steps.. and what a mess I made lol

This is my new favorite Beef Stroganoff recipe!  I was a little bitter about having to share my wine, but it was totally worth it.  I didn't use red pepper flakes, because my kid hates spicy. Just a wonderful dish.

I followed this recipe almost exactly and while my family enjoyed it (but did not love it), I did not. This may be because I have a sensitive nose, but the smell of the meat cooking in the wine marinade turned my stomach to the point that I could not eat it, although the smell was remedied when I added the creams. The red pepper was discordant and did not enhance the dish in any way. Next time I attempt it, I will leave out the wine and red pepper to see if the results are better.

I followed directions and I didn't like the taste of it.  I think it was the red wine flavor.  I won't make again.

I cut the cubed beef in half.. about 1.5 lb's. I forgot to add the sour cream and cream cheese (kids were very distracting) and used mixed veggies instead of mushrooms on a bed of veggie pasta. It was awesome, first time making Beef Stroganoff!

I was taught to make stroganoff with a packet.  However, I didn't have the packet and needed it on the fly.  This was amazing.  My husband even promised a back massage for it.  Thank you!!

This recipe is delicious! I had been wanting to make a stroganoff from scratch and decided on this recipe.  The only change I made was leaving out the mushrooms because my husband and I don't really like them.  We loved the flavor and the spice the red pepper flakes gave!  My husband said he could smell this cooking outside while he was doing yardwork and it made his mouth water.  He was very happy it was coming from OUR kitchen when he came in for dinner!  I will definitely be making this recipe again.  :)

I made this exactly as written with the exception of the red pepper flakes. I used 1/2 a teaspoon as opposed to 2 teaspoons and my tongue is still burning a little. Other than that this is a great recipe. I used the pre-sliced chuck roast for stir fry at the meat counter in the grocery store and saved myself the effort of cutting a roast up.

I read the reviews and used them to adjust the recipe to my family's taste. I prepped the food the night before as I babysit my young grandchildren the day of the meal. I did not marinate the beef in the wine but added the salt and pepper to the wine and refrigerated it over night in a container. I browned the beef, onions with garlic, and mushrooms the day before and put everything in the refrigerator, ready for the next day. I followed the recipe with two minor exceptions. After taste testing I decided to only use a couple of shakes of red pepper flakes and cut down the amount of cream cheese to approx. 2 and 1/4 oz. (3/4 of the 3 ounce block).  My family LOVED this recipe and I will be making it again and again.  Thank you for a true winner.

This was FANTASTIC!  I followed the advice from someone else and saved the beef drippings.  I then added enough beef stock to bring it up to the 1 1/3 cup mark.  I read the reviews about decreasing the red pepper, but followed the recipe and didn't find the dish to be overly spicy.  This is a keeper!  It ALWAYS takes me way more time to prep than others apparently, but still, it was worth every minute of the time I spent in the kitchen!  I did almost forget to purchase the noodles for this dish, so it would be great to see that added to the ingredients list.

AWESOME!!! The best Beef Stroganoff recipe I have ever made and I've made a few. I agree though with one of the comments that 2 tsp of red pepper flakes is a little to much. I am adding this to my repertoire.

Delicious recipe.  Excellent way to use up the leftover prime rib from Christmas.  This recipe is definitely going into my fav's.  I mixed in some egg noodles and then served it over creamy chive mashed potatoes for a true comfort food orgy.

This was one of the best beef stroganoff recipes I have ever tasted.  The roux made all the difference in the sauce.  I didn't put in as much hot pepper flakes, probably only half, as my husband doesn't like spicy foods.  This is my new beef stroganoff recipe, I threw out the one I had.

Too much red pepper.  I spent hours making this dish and when it was done, all we could taste was red pepper.  I would cut it down to half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes or none at all.

This recipe just called out for using left over Chuck Roast that had been braised tender in red wine and beef stock the night before. I also used Chef John's Creme Fraiche recipe from this site instead of sour cream. Since the beef was already cooked and tender all I had to do was slice and add it to the onions, garlic, mushrooms and sauce leaving out the red pepper flakes. Served over homemade egg noodles. My wife loved this meal better than the Braised Chuck Roast w/veggies we had the night before. A keeper for left over chuck roast!

This is a fantastic recipe. placed it over egg noodles with a side dish of buttered peas. I made a double batch and probably should have used less beef stock for a thicker roux but regardless, it turned out perfect. This is a keeper for formal dinners

OUTSTANDING.  Made precisely as the recipe called.  The best Stroganoff I've ever had.  Loved it, loved it, loved it.

If you are looking for a quick and easy recipe this one is not for you but it is soooo worth your time and energy.  My daughter was begging for Stroganoff and this really soothed her cravings.

Yes, great recipe! As always I added my own twists -
Doubled it because we (family of 5) didn't have enough as everyone wanted second plates on the first round draft! However, from original recipe, I doubled the mushrooms, added about 1/4 cup cream, 1/8 cup cooking sherry and 1 more Tbsp Worcestershire.  Also, used pancake mix instead of flour. Delicious!

This is the BEST recipe! My husband and I make it once a week now. No need to cook everything separately. Just throw it all in together. The longer it cooks, the better.

Awesome! I only changed a few things. I used 2lbs of stew meat since that is what I had. I added an additional 1/2 cup of water since I knew my meat needed to cook for 2 hrs to get tender. I added 1/2 tsp of Tarragon and reduced the Crushed Red pepper by half since my kids haven't quite gotten their spicy side yet. Cooked on cook top for 2 hrs and it was amazing. I did not add cream cheese. Will definately make this again to use up my stew meat. Thanks for the recipe!

This is a very good recipe and has very good flavor. 
I had left over beef roast with the juices it produced while in the crock pot and wanted a recipe I could use that in. This worked out perfectly.   My meat was not marinated first and I don't like to review recipes if not made exactly but I thought it was a small enough change to warrant the review since I felt it was a very good recipe.
  I also added 1/2 tsp pepper flakes instead of the full 2 (from the food co-op which I often find I need less than if I bought it from the grocery store).  I don't like things overly spicy. I wasn't sure that little would have any effect on it but it did and it was perfect for us. 
  My husband thought it was a little thick (could have been that I thickened it too much) so I added some milk to thin it some and it didn't change the flavor at all. I liked it both ways, thick or thin. 
I am not a big stroganoff fan (could be because I usually have the cream of mushroom soup kind) but I actually looked forward to the leftovers the next day. 
The guys said it was a keeper and I should make it again.

This was delicious! I used left over tri-tip, sliced thin. I let my sauce thicken too much, so added some cream.  Left out the addition of any salt, but followed the rest of the recipe exactly. Served over egg noodles.  Yum!  I would deffinately make this again.

LOVE it and I am not fond of Beef Stroganoff. The only change I would make is to reduce the red wine to 1/4 or 1/3 cup. I had chuck steak on hand so I threw it in the crockpot with some broth for the day. Let it cool a little and chopped it up and then used the broth for the sauce. MMMMMMMMM

This is really, really good. I was looking for a recipe without cream of mushroom soup and gave this a try, though I had never made a roux before. I used margarine, and with constant flattening, scraping and stirring with a heat-proof spatula in a cast iron skillet, it was bubbly and fragrant within about 3.5 minutes- to me, the scent was just like a pie crust. I had to substitute chicken stock for beef stock and white wine vinegar for red wine (was going to sub red wine vinegar, but was out of that as well) and it still came out great. I only added about half of the leftover marinade so the dish would't taste too vinegary. Also added dried oregano and basil, as another reviewer suggested, plus a little onion powder. The beef stew meat I used simmered for about 1.5 hours before the larger pieces became tender. I'll definitely never need another stroganoff recipe. This would be great in the crockpot, after cooking it on the stove until the point when everything is simmered together. Thank you, SANFRANCOOK!

This was wonderful.  I made a couple changes just because I was out of things: skipped the mushrooms due to a picky eater and replaced with cut green beans that I only added at the end; replaced the red wine with white because I was out of red, and used the water from cooking the green beans and an extra dash of Worcestershire instead of the beef broth.  Everyone loved it!

Great recipe, had to omit red flakes and wine for kids. Also halved the sour cream, cream cheese and butter. Came out great anyway. Thanks for posting this.

I made this for my daughter and grandson.  I thought my 17 year old grandson was going to eat the entire dish and he has requested it at least once a week.

I did double the sauce and left out the red pepper.

This is definitely a keeper in my house.

Really, really tasty recipe!!! This is a keeper! My only adjustment would be to decrease the red pepper flakes to (1) teaspoon. I really like spicy foods, but (2) teaspoons was a little too much.
Thank you for sharing this recipe with us!!!

I was very happy to find a recipe that used beef chuck roast instead of the usually just roasting it...and it turned out to be delicious!  However...I did NOT use 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes...is that a misprint?  The beef is already marinated with a mixture that includes pepper, I used like maybe a half teaspoon of red pepper flakes and it was perfectly spicy.  2 teaspoons would have been way too much to me.

Only thing I did differently is I used a stoneware piece to cook the beef in and kept it cooking while I prepared all the rest in a side pan, adding it to the beef, so the beef kept cooking at the same time.  I think next time I will buy a better quality piece of beef, but it was so good anyways.

Wow! Tired of pot roasts and not sure what to do with that cut of chuck roast? Here's a great option, only it's a bit tedious thinly slicing the meat with all the connective tissue. Though it simmers for an hour, so after making this I think some connective tissue will melt away, as the meat was very tender and the sauce was awesome! Will definitely make again. Thanks for an great recipe!

Delicious!  I added double the mushrooms and used an elk roast. I also only used one teaspoon of pepper flakes and it had the right amount of zing. It was oh so good. Best stroganoff recipe I have ever made. Make sure you have some yummy sour dough bread to soak up the sauce that’s left on your plate.

This was seriously the best stroganoff I have ever had. I served it over no yolk noodles and wow!! Everyone asked for seconds.  My husband asked me to make it again the very next night. I used an inexpensive Merlot and added extra garlic.  this will be a monthly staple in my meal planning. THANK YOU to whomever posted this recipe.

It would have been great if I had cut the red pepper flakes in half.  Two teaspoons overwhelmed the whole dish.  I will  make it again and use 1/2 tsp next time. Everything else was good.  I tossed the cooked egg noodles in the meat mixture at the end.

Followed the recipe exactly.  This is a lovely creamy stroganoff, but the crushed red pepper flakes just do not work in the recipe.  They literally distracted from the richness of the flavor.  We love spicy stuff, but the flakes are a big no-no here.  Better to stick with a nice finish of fresh ground black pepper.  Love the recipe though and it was pretty easy to make.

Super yummy, only things I did different was use .25 cup of wine, and did not marinate the meat. Also next time I would use much less red pepper flakes, but if you like a little kick then add the whole amount!

So good!  We used a very good cut of steak.  Shortened the cooking time for the steak and nearly skipped the simmer time (only about 15 minutes.  The two of us wanted to eat the entire batch.  Recipe is a keeper!

Didn’t have Woustershire sauce so used a sub of soy sauce, lime juice, fish sauce and brown sugar.  Worked really well.  I didn’t have time to dimmer for 1hr, only did about 20mins and was still delicious. Family loved it, will make again!

I used cream of mushroom soup instead of sour cream and cream cheese and sliced mushrooms.  I also used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes instead of 2 tsp.....and it gave just the right amount of spice.  Very good and creamy!

This was delicious. I didn't have any steak so I used ground beef. I didn't marinate it...just browned it.  Very rich and flavorful. I am from the Caribbean and if my food doesn't have flavor I am not eating it!  The kids loved it as well as the neighbors who stopped by unexpectedly. I will make it again!

Lots of flavor! I followed the recipe except, instead of red wine, I used red wine vinegar & 1 tsp. red chili flakes(vs. 2). Still had quite a kick! Everything turned out delicious even the beef was tasty and tender! Will definitely keep this recipe for future stroganoffs!

I found it too rich- would just use sour cream and not cream cheese.  Probably would cut back on all the butter for every level of sauté - alternately maybe not use the roux and keep the cream cheese?

Will definitely make again!!! My family loved it! I changed a couple things - I only used 1 tsp. red pepper flakes, doubled the mushrooms and used tenderloin steak and I sautéed the onions, mushrooms and garlic together - but it was fabulous! So many layered flavors - my 20 yr. old son has asked for the recipe to make for his guests! ;) Definitely a keeper - thank you!

This is the most delicious stroganoff I’ve ever had.  There aren’t enough stars to rate it, it’s just absolutely wonderfully delicious.  I made no changes to the recipe except to add more garlic and onion (we love lots of both).  Delicious.  Thank you for the recipe!

Very tasty.  Made exactly as recipe called for except used fresh mushroom which added a bit more liquid to the gravy.  Will account for that next time.  Will definitely make again.

The way I read the recipe it calls for 4 pounds of meat. I used 2 pounds but kept everything else the same. Because I was short on time,  I put it all in my Instant Pot for 30 minutes instead of simmering for an hour.  I forgot to add the sour cream & cream cheese at the end & it was still amazing! Can't wait to try again next time with all of the ingredients.

This was a HUGE hit for our family.   We did make some alterations that worked great for us.  I've listed them below.

-Replaced the Chuck roast with beef tenderloin.

-Used Shitake mushroom because we happened to have them. Was quite good but will probably use regular white button next time.

-Used a Red Cabernet Sauvignon for the wine.

-Reduced cooking time by almost an hour (because beef tenderloin does not need that long to cook).

-Changed Red pepper flakes to cayenne and reduced amount   to 1/4tsp because my family doesn't like this dish too spicy.

-Added 1 TSP MSG, 1 TSP Fish Sauce and 1 TSP Marmite to really punch up the savoriness with Umami.   

Added a white vinegar to taste to brighten. ( between 2 TSP and 1 TBSP)

I never measure as specifically as it says, but I did add all the ingredients called for. My husband always eats what I make, but this is the first time he commented that it is REALLY REALLY GOOD!  A little labour intensive for me, but worth it!

I used (1) 3 pound chuck roast, an entire package of fresh sliced mushrooms and increased the amounts of the wine, beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, cream cheese and sour cream, and I’m glad I did because if not the sauce would have been too thick. I also added a little dried dill seasoning. It took a little time to make, but was really good. The one negative thing about this recipe is the 2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes and it honestly almost ruined the dish for me. It was so spicy that it was uncomfortable to eat and our mouths were burning, and pretty much all you could taste (and feel) instead of the flavor from all that work you put into the dish while cooking it, so that was a MAJOR disappointment. Next time I make this I won’t be adding any red pepper flakes, it just doesn’t go with this dish.

Mine came out thicker than I'd like, but with a lot of sauce.  Just adding more broth wouldn't be the answer.  Next time I might skip the 1/4 cup butter & 1/4 cup flour and just add cornstarch to the thickness I want.  Good taste though, certainly lives up to its name of "creamy".

Very good recipe. To better tenderize, add an additional 1/2 teaspoon of salt and marinate in the red wine for 15-20min rather than 10min, which reduces the summer time to 30-45min rather than 1 hour. I also only used 1/2 of the red pepper flakes. Hubby loved it

I used meatballs that we had instead of the beef did not have any sour cream but used the cream cheese. I just made sure that I tempered the cream cheese to make sure it did not curdle when added to the sauce.  Wife loved it asked that I make again real soon. :-)

Flavor was great.  My biggest complaint is he prep/cooking time of 1 hr 50 mins is  very low.  This dish took me close to 3 hours of time.  Prepping the meat, onion, mushrooms, etc. and all the steps just took so long.  Also, the next to last step to simmer the mixed ingredients for 1 hour was not going to happen because there was not nearly enough liquid.  I had to add another cup of beef broth.  I was also only able to simmer it about 40 mins.  The cream cheese makes a nice  flavor profile addition, although it does take some of the tartness out of traditional stroganoff.   I doubt I make this again.  I will definitely consider adding cream cheese to the stroganoff recipe I usually use.

My family loved it! I didn’t have beef stock so I used liquid cream and it ended up less brown and more yellow but still super yummy. 
The idea of pouring champignons and cream at the end is great! 
Will def do it again!

I really love this recipe because I don't have to change much for our tastes, and it's SO good. My method differs only in that I prepare the onions and portabellas, then dredge the meat in some seasoned flour and brown it quickly in the same pan with some butter and olive oil, in batches. I then deglaze that pan with the red wine and beef broth, and proceed with the sauce from there. I add it all to my slow cooker and let it simmer for a few hours before adding the dairy. The ingredients I add are thyme, extra garlic, a bit of au jus mix, and I use spicy brown mustard and no red pepper. Bon Appétit!

Good recipe! I cut the recipe down because only half our household eats meat. The men loved it! I was going for a pork stroganoff so just adjusted this recipe accordingly and it worked perfect! I used ingredients that I had on hand, love being able to utilize the fridge and leftovers! So, pork for beef, red jalapeno for the red pepper. Had Shitake shrooms which were perfect for upping the 'beef' flavor. Chicken stock for the beef, and cut the red wine and Worcestershire out because I needed a lighter flavor. I used a good quality German mustard and buttermilk (leftover from something else) in the sauce, followed up with fresh parsley. Turned out great!   * I have made this recipe for beef and it was WONDERFUL! Just recently altered recipe for pork, was still awesome! Thank you so much for letting us play with your recipe!

I followed the directions but my quantities may have been a little off as I was using leftover tenderloin pieces I had used for shish-kabobs the night before and didn't quite have the required amount of wine.  I followed the recipe but omitted the red pepper flakes (not big on heat) and WOW this turned out amazing.  It may not be your traditional stroganoff, but we really liked it!  I think the worcestershire sauce is what made the difference and using tenderloin meant that I could skip the last step of cooking for an hour as the meat was already tender.  A definite keeper!

Was looking for my recipe and decided to use this one as a base. Using my cast iron dutch oven. No wine so I skipped that step. Sauted salt and peppered beef strips( from a boneless cross rib roast)  in oil, then diced onion, then garlic in butter.  Set that all aside. sauted mushrooms in butter set aside separately. put 1 1/2 cups of homemade bone broth in pot, put beef onion mixture back in. Added 1 tsp of dijon mustard, a few oregano flakes, a few red pepper flakes. as well as a couple tsps of cider vinegar. covered and simmered for a couple hours. Added mushrooms back in. mixed up a couple TBS cornstarch with water and blended that in and turned the heat up a bit and stirred until it thickened. Added 1/2 cup sour cream and about 1/3 of block of cream cheese. stirred in and turned heat down. Added a small amount of cooked egg noodles and stirred. Served over basmati rice alongside steamed broccolli. So yummy.

I used 1/2 white flour and 1/2 coconut flour - striving for a few less carbs.  I also added a little more sour cream.  Served over egg noodles for my husband and son and served over zucchini noodles for myself.  This is an amazing recipe - but set aside some time.

No changes but the broth turned out better than I expected with a twist that made what I thought was bland before into something with a bite.

It was a lot of work for mediocre results. I've made better, that were a lot less time consuming. Will not make again.

It was great! I followed the recipe exactly except I cut the red pepper flakes in half and used bison steaks that had been in the freezer for a while. So using the better cut of meat cut down on the cooking time.  My husband loved it! This one is going on the regular meal roster.

Very easy to make and tastes amazing.  Deep, rich flavour from reducing the sauce.  I only used 1 tsp of the pepper flakes and that was more than enough to give it a nice bite.  The two tsp the recipes calls for would be too much.

Great recipe! I didn't have any sour cream, so on a whim I added a little heavy cream and goat cheese to get the tang, and it turned out great! Only issue I had was the sirloin needed longer than an hour to tenderize while cooking. Next time, I'll use a better cut of meat!

This is a winner. I used sirloin and marinated the strips for four hours. I also used more mushrooms but followed the recipe otherwise. By using sirloin I only had to sauté for 30 minutes.

This is pretty darn good. I used twice as many mushrooms, and had to add more beef stock or the gravy was too thick. While it’s very tasty, I think for the amount of work / time it takes, I would probably opt for other recipes over this one.

Made this with leftover rib roast. Not sure how much meat but doubled the sauce and only simmered 30 minutes. My stroganoff never thickens, so this was so much better. I did not need to double the red pepper flakes. Next time I will halve that ingredient, but everyone loved it.

Made a few changes: (a) added one shallot 'cause I had one, (b) used shiitake and baby bellas, (c) cooked the mushrooms in a separate pot with heavy cream, butter, salt and pepper and served as gravy (my son is not a mushrooms fan), (d) used quite more white wine to deglaze the pan before adding the butter and the flour.

Delicious - I halved the red pepper flakes and the dish still had a nice zip. I did not add cream cheese - just sour cream and a bit extra to substitute for the deletion of the cream cheese.

This is a delicious dish!  It’s took a little longer than recipes it I previously used,  but it was well worth it.  Letting the meat simmer in the sauce makes a big difference.  We chose to serve over rice and that was great too.

Very tasty recipe.     I’m of the less spicy palate so I may do half the pepper flakes next time. Even so it’s nothing a good Bavarian Lager can’t tame !    I also mixed with egg noodles.    Next time I will just spoon over the top of noodles.

Love this recipe! I changed this recipe only a hair by browning the meat then putting everything together after making the roux with broth into my pressure/slow cooker.
I pressure cooked it for 45 min then slow cooked it for 2 hours and its melt in your mouth awseome!

I thought this would be harder to make than it actually was. It is the best beef stroganoff I have ever had! Thank you for the recipe.

I made this and it was really great but I made it in a steamed bag with green onion, onion, corn and a slow steam bag cooking seasoning.  Then i boiled the egg noodles with 2 cups of water a half cup of milk and 1 tablespoon of butter. This was real rich with flavor!!

Well per usual I am working with what I have...freezer cleaning today. Four small mock chuck steaks are standing in for the chuck steak. Mushrooms were saute'd ahead of time (large costco box needing to be used)- refridged until I could figure out what to do with them. Added onions to meat as it browned then added a little more oil and flour. Deglazed the pan with chicken stock. After meat was browned I added all the mushrooms. pulled out two cups to freeze for another use. Then proceeded to add the other ingredients as written (altho I did sub the mustard for dijon as that is what I had) Serving over noodles later this week and I can't wait! It smells great, thanks for the inspiration! Edited to add: before I finished this for the fridge I tasted and upped the worscheshire sauce added a Tbl Balsamic cause no wine and some chicago steak seasoning to make it flavorful over egg noodles (which are so bland) - hubby says it's tasty -

Followed the recipe. Was great ??.  Had friends over and he had a second helping. My husband said that it is a keeper.  Froze the leftovers. Add liquid when I reheat. Tastes just as good.

I made it with top sirloin. I did everything else the same way but forgot to simmer an hour before adding the sour cream and cream cheese. We ate it immediately and it was so good. Even better the next day.

I've made this 2 times now!! This is a little labor of love, however, spectacular! I added a little water to sauce before simmering, seems sauce is a little short. Worchestire a little extra and dijon! Fab!!! Perfect to reheat over and over. I didn't add cream cheese only sour cream until served individually. Make it!!

Excellent recipe. I used a leftover striploin steak that had been grilled medium rare and stir fried it in the olive oil after marinating. Dijon instead of yellow mustard, white wine instead of red to marinate, Greek yogurt instead of sour cream, and spicy smoked paprika instead of red pepper flakes. Served over noodles with a green salad.

Was the "2 teaspoons of red pepper flakes" a typo? I used 1 teaspoon and it was quite spicy. Perhaps 1/4 or 1/2 teaspoon would have been enough.

I substituted beef broth with mushroom broth. Added a bit more pepper flakes. Added more mushroom broth as sauce was a bit too thick. Overall it tasted fantastic,

This was incredible stroganoff. Probably the best I have ever had. I cut the chili flakes in half for the more sensitive types I was feeding it to and it came out with just enough kick to keep everyone happy. I will definitely make this again.

Made it as directed but didn't have fresh mushrooms i used canned and added them at the end, fresh probably would be better. cream cheese was a nice addition made a thicker sauce.

I've been making stroganoff for 40 years. I decided to "tweak" my recipe with this one. I'm so glad I did. My husband said it's the best one I've ever made. I used a cheap cut of meat, and cooked it in the pressure cooker after soaking it in the wine, with the beef broth. So tender. Other than that, I pretty  much stuck to the recipe, with the exception of the mustard. This was absolutely delicious. My husband just got home, and is having the leftovers. He said he's been thinking about it all day.

I chose to get thin cut (1/2" thick) chuck steaks which I sliced into 1/2" strips. . I sauteed the strips in groups so they wouldn't get overcooked and also for less time than the recipe called for so they were slightly pink in the middle. When all the ingredients were placed together in the pan I only cooked it for 10 min, not the hour that it called for,  because the steak was thin. It  turned out perfectly tender.  I did not use the red pepper flakes. Overall flavor was delicious.

Excellent recipe! Nice and rich - even my daughter liked it! I did make one change - I added 1.5 tablespoons of rosemary. When I tasted the sauce it just needed a little something. The rosemary really finished it off nicely. This recipe will be part of our regular rotation!

I have made this with beef chunks, strips, etc. Delicious.
I have always been a bit intimidated by making a roux, but it is easy enough. I have done this recipe upwards of 3 times and it always comes out wonderful.

Rave reviews from the family. Used my own marinade. Deleted red wine and used 2/3 C Olive Oil, 2/3 C Balsamic vinegar , 2 cloves garlic. Marinated 2 hours. In final stages erplaced marinade with fresh Balsamic vinegar and added other ingrdients. Substituted Neufschatel cheese for Cream Cheese. Served over No Yolk Egg noodles. It was delicious. Will do it again.

The whole family liked it and rated it a 4. I would've rated it a 4.5 if I could. Very tasty, but took a long time to make.

Used sirloin steak instead. With all ingredients was a pricey dish. I was in a rush so printed recipe and went shopping. I must remember to read reviews because too much crushed red pepper ruined the whole thing.  I am a total rookie to cooking and baking so for now try to follow recipe to a T. The amount had to be a typo.

I halved the meat and cut the wine and cream cheese (because I’m currently expecting), but this came out so delicious! I also used rotini noodles and let them re-absorb the pasta water so the dish came out creamy like a Mac-n-cheese texture.

Delicious!  This was so good and made the absolute perfect stroganoff.  The sauce is so creamy and flavorful!  I did saute the mushrooms first, to set aside.  Then I browned my meat and onions together.  I used meatballs for this, to make a meatball stroganoff, and used about 1 lb. to the whole sauce recipe since we like ours with extra sauce.  Any meat would be awesome with this recipe.  I didn't marinate with the red wine, and just added it in after adding in the beef stock.  I used dijon mustard and also added in a touch more seasoning like a dash of garlic and onion powder and some parsley.  Since I used meatballs, I let it all simmer together with the lid on for around 20-25 minutes and it was very flavorful and creamy.  I did need to add a touch of milk to thin it out a bit at the end of cooking.  Excellent!  I will be making this a lot!  Thank you for the recipe!

This was awesome. I put my beef in a crockpot with some salsa to simmer until pull-apart tender. I think those flavors just enhanced the dish. It made 8+ generous portions. WOW! Definitely making it again.

Great recipe! The only substitution I made was dijon in place of yellow mustard. I will definitely make this again - it was a hit with everyone. The red pepper flakes provide a definite kick, and we love that.

Omitted all spices and replaced with Montreal Steak seasoning.  Also used stew beef, but I sliced the chunks into very thin slices. Ate over zucchini noodles instead of egg noodles and it was delicious.

This was excellent! I didn’t change a thing but did omit the crushed pepper. It was a very affordable and easy meal. Since cook time was little longer it made for the perfect hearty Sunday Dinner. My husband and 8 year old loved it and have requested we eat it at least once a month.

while tasty, the needed ingredients can become rather expensive,  especially the beef.  it also took twice as long on the prep as the recipe calls for.  won't make again due to cost and time needed.

I used this recipe when I had left overs from a standing prime rib roast.   I just kept the  cut up meat aside until I needed to add it.   It was fantastic.....put over mashed potatoes.....rice and noodles.   I used it for three different meals.  Made the cost of th prime rib roast worth it.   I added more wine .....to taste.

First attempt at making stroganoff ever. It turned out amazing!! Even my picky kid loved it. The beef was so tender. The only thing I did differently was marinate the meat longer (1 hour) and I added extra mushrooms and garlic. Fantastic recipe.

Over all, this recipe has wonderful potential. Although there are 2 parts that I feel could be improved.

1) Instead of cooking away all the flavor of the steak first step, bring it out instead. DON'T cook it for 7 minutes as per directions. That will drain flavour. Bring it out by searing it over high heat for 2 minutes instead. (Heat pan to high then add meat for 2 min.) Don't worry if not fully cooked. (It shouldn't be.) It will cook later during simmer.

 2) This next part was such a sacrilege that it nearly made me cry. Throwing out all the grease after cooking the steak then replacing it with butter? NO! That grease has ALL the flavor inside. ALL the flavor that would taste best INSIDE the food you are creating. Please use that same grease instead of the butter for the next step.

My husband had been craving beef stroganoff, so I began scanning these recipes.  Wow! I'm sure glad I found a winner.  I made this, exactly as directed, and it is wonderful.  I will cut the red pepper flakes in half next time even though my husband usually puts Tabasco or jalapenos on almost everything, otherwise this is perfect!

This was very delicious! I made a few changes. I did not marinate the meat in red wine to save time. I added very dry sherry to the sauce along with a splash of heavy cream. I used plain Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream. Lastly, I did not simmer. The meat was tough enough as it was so I just added it back to the sauce after it was finished simmering. I served over lasagna noodles. Yummy!! I will definitely be making this again. Thank you so much for the recipe!

Great recipe!  I followed the directions exactly except for the mushrooms (hubs hates them).  I thought 2 teaspoons of crushed red pepper flakes seemed excessive, so I only used 
1 1/2 teaspoons, and it was still too hot.  I managed to removed about 1/2 teaspoon of the flakes from the mixture, but it was still a tad too hot for our taste.  Next time I'll probably only use 1/2 teaspoon to start with and adjust from there.  Other than that, it was fabulous and hubs is still talking about how good it was three days later.

My family loved it! A bit spicy for the younger boys but I wouldn’t change the amount of red peppers. I would like to make it again with filet mignon. Recommend it to everyone! A must try!

Very tasty and tender. Only made a few changes: 2 teaspoons seemed excessive so I used 1/2 teaspoon, and it was still very spicy. Didn't have sour cream so I only used cream cheese at the end, so saved a few calories there.

This was wonderful! I used my leftover pot roast meat (uased Chef John's slow cooker pot roast recipie)  So it was super simple to put together. Cooked my onions and mushrooms, made the roux (let it cook and change color to medium brown...don't burn it) added the rest of ingredients for gravy, then the meat and veggies to warm. Added cream cheese and sour cream last.

This is by far the best beef stroganoff recipe I've  made. My family is crazy about this recipe. Every time I make this I make it in a big batch. The wine that I found works best for this recipe  (and I used a couple different types) is Cabernet Sauvignon (get a wine you would drink). If you do not drink wine the best brand is "19 Crimes" or "Cupcake". I only use 19 Crimes (around $19) because its a wine that I drink. I've used CupCake ($6-$9) wine a couple times and it worked great as well.  I also use regular mustard, nothing fancy. Any cut of beef would do as well.  Enjoy!!!

I did not like the crushed red pepper  in it.   The Worcester is enough to give the dish some zest.  Next time I will eliminate the red pepper flakes.  And I used 2 cups of sour cream instead of cream cheese.   Overall good recipe.

I used top sirloin and the flavors are delicious.  I found it worth the different layer of browning meats, onions and mushrooms.  Nice complex layering of flavors.

We ate this, but only because we were hungry & didn't have anything else defrosted. It was way to spicy & we used about 1/4 of the pepper flakes.  We do like food with some heat, but this was bad. If you like this recipe I'd suggest frying the meat, garlic & onion together. Also I'd put the mushroom & wine in the end before you serve.  This cuts down a lot of the steps SanFranCook put in directions. All the butter & olive oil is way to much & can spoil the flavor. Think we'll stick with our stroganoff recipe instead & it is a lot easier.

Great dish - everyone LOVED it.  This is the second time I've made it and decided I needed to give it the rating it deserves.  If you love this traditional dish but have never made it before, I recommend this recipe.  The only change I made was that I marinated the meat overnight not using the wine recipe here but rather used Allegro Original marinade.

Made it, tasted better than it looked. Mine was much more creamy looking so as I added the cream cheese I took a  big chunk out as I saw it was getting too creamy.  ( then I added more broth)

This recipe is awesome - and i received RAVE accolades for this one.  I used top sirloin because it was on sale. Of course, i used more mushrooms than called for because in our house, we have shroomies who will fight over them.  And I added a little  extra  red wine - I am allergic to measuring alcohol for any reason :).  But, other than that I prepared recipe as written and it was outstanding! Thanks, Sanfrancook!

Made this according to recipe for a friend of mine; I used fresh mushroom rather than canned and added extra as this person really likes the health benefits of mushrooms.  Every one really enjoyed it and especially the extra little 'kick' from the crushed red peppers.

Delicious! Made it according to recipe, (well, almost) and the wife (a picky eater) ate it all and wanted seconds!  I halved the red pepper flakes, but it still had a little kick to it. I'll make this again!

I used stew beef, seasoned with garlic powder, salt and pepper. Browned all sides first, did not drain off the grease. I used beef broth and omitted the red pepper flakes. I also substituted Mexican crema for the sour cream.  It was delicious and will definitely make it again!

Followed the recipe exactly, this is very good. Cooked it a little longer, and added beef stock to thin it out. Flavors were perfect, don't not add the pepper flakes, they are infused in the sauce and add depth, not so much heat. Might add soy to leftovers just to bend it a little. Enjoy.

This recipe comes very close to one I used to make but lost the details for. Next time I will cut back on the butter and use something like Brummel & Brown instead as it was a bit over the top in fat. I would also not add the hot pepper flakes unless you like alot of "zing" in your meal (we don't). Makes a very nice size amount and was quite tasty except for the hot pepper and I only added half of what was called for.

Good flavorful meal that  with noodles is a budget savor, with the wine marinates it into a tender dish.

Very good! One of our favorite meals but takes quite a bit of prep so only made on rare occasions. Used need stew meat and cut it down a bit. Did not use the mustard but still delish!

It was a hair on the spicy side (and we like spicy) so I may cut the spice a bit next time, but other than that, it was really really good.

A bit of work to make but was nice and tender.  I used a bit of meat tenderizer in the marinade and less salt.

Awesome result.  Prep was a bit long, will probably be shorter next time as I will know what I'm doing .  Pepper flakes made it a bit spicy for the kiddos so I will decrease drastically or omit.  i liked the spice though.  Very good recipe

This recipe turned out to be absolutely delicious! I didn't have any wine, so I used beer instead and  I only used a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and it was really great! I did use a cut up roast and the meat was very tender and flavorful.  Leftovers didn't last through the night. Fantastic meal!

It was good but in the past I've made it with White wine and it had more flavor in the sauce which is what I cook with. My cooking is all about flavor no matter what I make. When I make Stroganoff again, it will be with white wine.  Don't get me wrong however as it was good though.  I'm just referring to my personal taste and that of my boys that made the same comment.

We really liked this. The only adjustment I made was using 1/2 the crushed red pepper the recipe called for. It was more than enough.

I've tried a few times to make different stroganoff with no success.  This recipe is awesome, the while family loved it! I replaced the wine with diluted Au Joir sauce and add 3 tbsp cream cheese with the sour cream . Definitely a keeper. Thanks!

Loved it. I used an arm roast as it was all I had. Great flavor and since it's only me, I had enough for 3 meals. Next time will reduce the red pepper flakes a tad. Thanks for sharing.

Although this was a little time intensive fixing, it turned out wonderful.  
The only thing I changed was the cream cheese...I was unexpectedly out of the block of cream cheese, so I used the soft cream cheese in the same amount.  Worked just fine.
Also, my husband suggested that next time I should cut the pepper flakes in half.   
Will definitely make it again.

I wish I read the reviews first and adjusted the red pepper flakes.   I am SO not spicy kind of person (and I even made this with half the beef with same amount of gravy) and I couldn't even swallow it.  I MIGHT try it again, but it really isn't traditional beef stroganoff where you taste the flavor of sour cream, it was more just a gravy.  Hubby liked it ok though, he likes spicy.

Delicious and a keeper!  Followed to a tee except the only noodles I Had on hand was spaghetti. It queued but should have been egg noodles.  My son, who is picky, loved the sauce.

I am not a fan of Beef Stroganoff, but my husband loves it. So I tried this recipe and to my surprise I LOVED IT, and so didn't he. I will continue making this version of Beef Stroganoff.

This dish was amazing, we loved the addition of the cream cheese. I used dijon as others suggested and only used 1 tsp chili flakes which was spicy enough. When i put it on to simmer for the hour it was very thick so i added another cup of broth it came out perfect.

This is a delicious beef stroganoff!! I would highly recommend trying this. The creaminess was my favorite part. My one suggestion is to be careful with how much crushed red pepper is used. It can be very spicy if you use too much. Overall quite a crowd pleaser!!

Will make again but probably not use the cream cheese and increase sour cream pro rata.  It needs the full two teaspoonfulls of chili!  I used bolo very successfully. Lovely meal.

I made this skipped the red wine marinade and used sirloin cut into thin strips it was absolutely delicious.  I did add quite a bit more beef broth than called for and cut back a bit on crushed red pepper to about 1 & 1/2 tsp it still had a good kick. Instead of red wine I used cognac however I didn't try marinating the beef in it I just added to the sauce.  This will be my go to stroganoff recipe from now on.

Loved it. I did use tenderloin which is pretty expensive but I sure enjoy the flavors.  I also used spicy brown mustard. I'm not sure  about the red wine but I'll see what the leftovers taste like.  It seemed a little overpowering and distracting from the other flavors  instead of complimenting  them.

This is very flavorful and will definitely make it again. The only changes I made was a different cut of meat, used beef tips and cooked 1 1/2 hours to make sure they were tender and only used 1/4 cup of sour cream because we aren't crazy about it but everything else including the wine was left the same. Can't go wrong with this recipe if you follow it exactly the way it's written. Thanks for the recipe this is a keeper.

I LOVE this recipe!! I have made this over the years in the basic sense! Always great, but this one is over the top! I did make a few changes to my liking by using beef tenderloin! It is LEAN, CLEAN, and TENDER! I don't eat much in the meat dept, but when I do it must only be beef tenderloin aka filet mignon! So it justifies spending the extra $$$! Next thing is I doubled the sauce recipe to ensure it was juicy! Hey it's a rich meal so might as well enjoy it right! Next I used plain greek yogurt instead of sour creme!! Works perfectly! And finally instead of using regular egg noodles I used pappardelle noodles and let me tell you, it was better than eating at the finest of restaurants! I loved the marinating in red wine idea, it added to the richness and flavor of the meal! I loved the pepper flake idea, because I love my food to have zing! If you don't, add just half and you will enjoy it still! This came at the right time, because I made it for my boyfriend as a going away dinner and he was in shock and awe!! Thank you for posting this recipe, I will be making again for small dinner parties and special occasions!!

Didn't have any red pepper flakes but it was delicious without. I would simmer the meat for longer than an hour next time. Otherwise absolutely delicious! My 2-year-old and my husband both devoured it so we will definitely be making this again.

I changed nothing except a little less red pepper flakes and I put the mushrooms on the side because two of us like them and two of us don't.   Everyone asked for seconds and it's extremely rare for everyone in my family to agree on food.  I will absolutely make it again!

So good! I changed it up slightly. I used a 3 pound chuck roast. I had 1/2 lb. of mushrooms, uncooked they ended up being 1.5 cups. When I cooked the beef, there was about 1 cup of liquid left over, so I added 1/3 cup of beef broth to that and used that mix to add to the roux. I used spicy brown mustard instead of yellow mustard. When I added the beef/onion mixture, it seemed too thick, so I added another 1/3 cup beef broth. I used No Yolks dumplings, because it's what was on hand. Took some time, but well, well worth it!

I followed the advice of others and used Dijon instead of yellow mustard. Added an extra half cup of mushrooms. Next time I'll increase the gravy portion and use a better cut of beef. 

Otherwise, this is a great meal and was fun to create.

My family loved it. I used white grape juice in place of the red wine which worked very well.  It also helped tenderize the meat. I don't usually cook with mushrooms, but tried it this time. It added a good flavor, but I think next time I'll cut the mushrooms into smaller pieces. I doubled the marinade and discarded it when I browned the meat. Therefore, I used 1/2 cup white grape juice to add to gravy instead of the reserved marinade. Will definitely make again, but will double it next time. With teenage boys, there were no leftovers.:-)

Love this recipe! Great flavor and easy to make. The only thing I did differently was dirty a couple of extra pans and cook the beef, onion, and mushrooms in separate pans at the same time to cut down in the cooking time. Then after adding onions to the beef mixture I reused that pan to make the roux.  We will definitely be making this recipe over and over again.

My husband LOVED it!!  He said it was the best he's ever had.  However, in regards to the ingredients, I used 1 cup of red wine and cut back on the red pepper flakes (around 1 tsp instead of 2).  I'm not much of a stroganoff lover but this recipe was great!

I forgot that I ran out of mustard, so I used mustard powder and made spicy Chinese mustard instead. I didn't use red chili pepper flakes. This switch was amazing in the overall flavor. Other than that this is an excellent recipe.

I didn't have any red wine but did everything else exactly and this recipe was DELICIOUS!! We used leftover beef tenderloin and holy toledo was it good. The red pepper flakes gave it a little heat so if heat's not your thing, I would recommend leaving that ingredient out.

This recipe was super easy to make and the taste was phenomenal. I omitted the wine marinade and used ground beef instead. I also cut the sour cream in half. Everyone loved it......and it will be making a regular appearance on our table.

BRA-VO!!!!  I had leftover prime rib from Christmas to use up and decided to try this recipe.  So glad I did!  In order to compliment the "fancy" prime rib, I used coarsly chopped portobello caps in place of regular sliced mushrooms...and doubled the quantity.  We love mushrooms!   I also used spicy brown mustard in place of yellow; cornstarch in place of flour (personal preferences).  And since the steak was already seasoned and cooked, I skipped the marinade part (still added the wine & seasoning after the stock/roux comes to boiling) and only simmered it all for 20 min.  My word, was it good!!!  My husband went nuts over it.  So rich, so flavorful, and so elegant.  But so easy.!  This meal would be perfect for a dinner party.  Thank you for sharing what might be my new most favorite recipe!

Granted, I used the leftover prime rib from Christmas.  So the cook time was minimal considering  the meat was already cooked. But this was fantastic as is. Super creamy, decadent, over the top good. The best stroganoff I've had in some time. Do not hesitate to make this one. I got raves and requests for the recipe.  Boom!

I modified slightly with much less red pepper (2 or 3 shakes).  I also used left over rib roast from Christmas dinner for the meat which didn't require much cooking time.  I also used less onion.  The hands-down best stroganoff that I have ever made or had!

I was so tired of ordering my favorite meal-this meal-and not having it when I wanted. I am so proud to say that I made this meal myself! I followed it to a "T" and added more beef stock and sour cream in the final steps to make it more creamy! My husband and 3  growing  boys were beyond impressed!  I dished out to my younger son before adding mushrooms- will definitely make this more often! Better than the ones I have ever ordered from! Seriously soooo good!

Made it and made it again.  The beef turns out great, and the flavor is good.  We thought it was too hot the first time, so we toned down the red pepper in the second batch.  Keeping the recipe.

I made this last night and it was delicious. It was easy enough, the meat was nice and tender, and the gravy was very flavorful. I will definitely make this again. The only thing I did differently was add Greek yogurt instead of cream cheese.

Really good as is, solid 4 star. Next time I'll use less flour and add a beef cube to the beef broth for a more "beefy" flavor.  I'll also use less cream cheese next time...little too many calories lol. Besides that, pretty awesome stroganoff!

We had this for supper tonight over noodles. We both liked it and have agreed that it's a keeper, with modifications. I'm so happy that I cut back on the red pepper flakes or I would not have been able to eat it. As it was, I liked it but it was on the edge of being too hot. I think next time I'll cut back just a touch on the mustard too. I don't like mustard and I could taste it so that's too much for me. Otherwise, it's a great recipe.

Absolutely incredible! I literally plan to make this once a week. I use the cheap red blend wine and an elk roast, served over buttered Hungarian egg noodles. Just one thing to be aware of is though- the pepper flakes. This dish was surprisingly spicy with the full amount of pepper flakes. Which was fine because we love spicy food. However, if you're not a fan of heat you may want to dial back a bit.

Made with deer meat OMG!! SOOOOO GOOD!
USED white wine instead of red cause that's all I had. Also used 2/3 cup sour cream didn't have any  cream cheese which would have been amazing.
Super super great tecipe. Every time I make it there r no leftovers.

Best Stroganoff I ever made!  Awesome creamy texture.  A bit of extra work to put in and take out the meat, then the onions, then the mushrooms, but in the end worth it.  I did a few modifications, no mustard.  Was very generous on the onions, garlic and worcestershire sauce.  Didn't have beef stock, so used water and bullion.  Also, I skipped the cream cheese and doubled up on the sour cream.  Came out great and family loved it!  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

Made this today and it's delicious!  I used two chuck roasts, slicing them up myself.  I felt it was very easy to make, coming together very quickly.  Didn't make any changes to the recipe and I will make it again.

This was good, very rich as advertised. We made it with pork stew meat and chicken broth and deleted the mushrooms since my family doesn't like them but it's a good recipe.

I used a left over roast which had turned out tough because of a bbq meltdown, and this recipe was delicious.  I added a bit more stock because it was a bit too thick for my liking, but it turned out delicious and I'll certainly be making it again.

I liked the recipe because the meat, and I used your basic round steak, was VERY tender. I also did not use cream cheese, but doubled the sour cream instead. My household doesn't care for real spicy so I halved the pepper flakes, too, and it was scored as a winner. Will do it again.

Great recipe. My kids even loved the mushrooms.  Only change I made was to add onion powder to the marinade for the beef. Will use this recipe again.

I made this as per the recipe and it turned out fantastic.  It was a hit and I'll definitely be making it again.  I think you could cut the salt without compromise and I'll probably use light cream cheese and sour cream next time just because the dish is so rich, but all in all a great find.  Thanks for posting

Use 2 cups sliced mushrooms because 1 cup turned in to 1/3 cup after sautéing for 10 min, which didn't feel like enough mushroom in the finished dish. The dish was too rich, I think cutting down the butter and some of the cream cheese/sour cream would be a good idea. Or, just use low fat versions of the same amounts. I used the full 2 tsp pepper flakes and found it was the perfect amount of heat/spiciness. I used flank steak strips I found at the local Asian market. I believe they are used mostly for stir frys. No special preparations were needed to tenderize it.  The flavour was very enjoyable.

This was very good. I didn't marinate the meat instead I  poured some wine in with the meat as it cooked. Then separated the meat onto a plate and the broth into a bowl. Cooked the mushrooms and onions at the same time. Then after adding the flour, mustard, etc I cooked everything together. Loads of flavor, will make again.

I followed the recipe except for the amount of red pepper flakes. I only added 1 tsp. and it was still too much. I like hot foods and spice but the rpf overtook the other flavors so I would leave it out next ft time.

Used leftover steak from the night before.  Didn't put in red pepper flakes, just didn't think they belonged in the recipe and glad we omitted them.  It was so good.  Will make again

This was so delicious!  I used shallots instead of onion, Dijon mustard and cut back on the red pepper flakes by half.  I also didn't have any red wine so just seasoned the beef with salt and pepper before cooking and the flavor.... my goodness.  This is my husband's new favorite dish.

I made this recipe with sirloin instead of chuck roast because it was what I had in the freezer.  Omitted the pepper flake to accommodate a 10 year old.  Used 3 lbs of meat instead of 2 and also used more wine, worstershire, and garlic.  My family devoured it!  I sautéed extra mushrooms for the mushroom lovers to add to their finished dish.  I wish I had some minced parsley.  I think it would have been a nice flavor addition.

My husband and I don't like mushrooms so I added peas instead.  It was absolutely delicious!  The meat was so tender and the seasoning was perfect.  Very easy to follow recipe.  One of my favorites.  I will be making this again.

This recipe is awesome! I've been looking for the "right" stroganoff recipe for a long time, and decided to give this one a try. I'm so glad I did because it's everything I wanted it to be...creamy, beefy, and full of distinct flavors. It was also a very easy recipe to follow. I deviated a little bit from the directions, but used nearly all of the ingredients. I skipped the step with the onions because I'm not a fan of actual onions, and instead opted to pre-season the meat with onion powder (in addition to the salt and pepper) before marinating. I also threw the minced garlic into the marinade since I wasn't cooking the onions with it. After cooking the meat, I didn't drain off the grease/juices because I thought a lot of good flavor would be lost  by tossing it. Instead, after taking the meat out of the pan, I cooked the mushrooms in whatever juices were left, plus butter. I really think that deepened the flavor of my mushrooms and the dish overall. I also omitted the red pepper flakes because I don't like them, but instead added a little more black pepper and some parsley. It turned out so delicious! I'll be making this for years to come.

I am one of those people that use allrecipes for everything but never leave a review. I know.. I am just horrible. But, after making this multiple times, I HAD to take the time to leave a comment. This recipe is AWESOME. My family and I absolutely LOVE this version of Stroganoff. I don't use red pepper flakes because I have a 2 year old, who is also very picky and its very hard find foods she likes and will eat repeatedly... she devours it every, single, time I make it.

I used 2 lbs of round steak and  1/3 of a brick of light cream cheese.  I felt that amount of cream cheese was sufficient to make a nice creamy sauce with plenty of taste.  My family loved it!

I had to alter this because we don't eat beef....but it came out really, really yummy using turkey medallions pounded and cut in strips (as is done with the beef in recipe).  I used a 10.5 oz. can of chicken broth and whisked about 1/4 c. of flour into it before adding to the meat mixture - didn't want it to be too thin as some reviewers mentioned.  I followed the rest of the recipe pretty closely (but did use fresh mushrooms and Dijon - not prepared mustard). 
I will definitely make this again. My husband really liked it too!!
Thank you for making it possible for me to make a tasty Turkey Stroganoff!!
It will now be a part of my regular dinners  :)

My family doesn't like mustard so I omitted it. I did add a little red wine vinegar and less red wine. I stuffed 8 slices of fresh garlic in the meat for about 2 hours before. 1 hour before slicing I marinated the meat in red wine, red wine vinegar, Worcestershire sauce and fresh garlic. I cooked in low for about an hour and a half. My husband said its the best he's ever had.

Amazing, cream cheese really takes this dish to another depth of flavor. I added a couple additional shakes of Worcestershire sauce because I love the richness that gives. Now, this is perfect as is but if I'm being honest I doubled the sauce (doubled everything except meat and produce) only because I mix it into the pasta before serving which tends to tight sauces up. The extra sauce also allows this dish to be an excellent option to re-heat at work the next day for lunch

Great recipe and easy to revise with items on hand. I was craving a Stroganoff taste but we don't use beef much.  The meal came out totally delicious!! Check out what I did:
~browned 1.5 lbs of ground turkey
~added 1/3 cup white wine w/1 cup chicken stock (didn't have the beef stock)
~used Dijon mustard (didn't have prepared mustard) and increased to 1 tbsp
~used low fat cream cheese
~cooked onions & garlic for 2 mins, then added chopped fresh mushrooms and cooked/removed all together
~used half the butter for each of the steps and substituted w/olive oil as needed
~served over Rotini pasta (didn't have egg noodles)

An all-round healthier meal and tasting super yummy!

My family loved this! I put the meat onion and salt and pepper on to cook in the crock pot and waited about an hour and a half then fixed the gravy in a skillet and added to the meat, then I waited until everything had cooked on high for 5 1/2 hours and added the fresh mushrooms. When the crock went to the keep warm stage I added the cream cheese and sour cream it was thick and rich and delicious! Served over wide egg noodles.

Wonderful recipe! I started cooking  rather late in the day and so used my pressure cooker instead of simmering for an hour as called for. The meat (basic stew meat) was fork tender. I didn't use the pepper flakes, only because I forgot, but will add them next time, and believe me, there will be many next times.

I used a pressure cooker on a cheap cut of meat, no other changes, and it was fabulous and easy.  Next time I think I will cut red wine in half or use a really good red wine.

This is an awesome recipe. I used green onions and didn't have sour cream so used extra sour cream. There was a enough for a second meal and so I browned off some pork loin and simmered it in mushroom soup for about 30 minutes and added the left overs from the night before. It was awesome. Might do a combo of beef and pork in the future. The red pepper flakes add just enough peppery kick to this recipe.

I used a mash-up of multiple people's recommendations and ended up with a DELICIOUS result!  I only had 1 lb of stew meat, so I coupled it with about 4-5 lbs sliced mushrooms.  I'm also a huge fan of garlic so used 5 cloves, minced.  I sort of "eyeballed" the measurements--used a "large dollop" of dijon mustard, "sprinkled" in red pepper flakes (my guess is less than the recipe called for and the spice factor was perfect), a large "pinch" of both dried oregano and basil.  So so so delicious!  I will definitely make again, probably using the same meat-to-mushroom ratio!

This is very good. Yes I did alter the recipe a bit. I made 4 times the sause with 4 times the fresh sliced mushrooms and 1 and a 1/2 times the meat. I used dijon mustard instead of red pepper as others suggested.  I omitted the salt substituting with beef bullion to make certain the sause had enough beef flavor. I crushed and sprinkled the beef bullion in the butter used to make the roux before whisking in the flour. Bullion also helps to stop flour from tasting "raw."

Fantastic! I doubled the sauce part of the recipe. My family never seems to get enough sauce with recipes. The flavor in this recipe was just delicious. I left out the wine and even my picky eater loved it. Thank you!

Absolutely delicious! My family loved it! I have to admit I didn't really measure anything and just followed the directions. I didn't use too much pepper flakes, just a sprinkle. I used 3 rib steaks thinly sliced, so the meat was very tender. Fabulous!

Fantastic!  I took the advice of other readers~~used Dijon instead of yellow mustard, cut back on the chili pepper flakes by half, and used stewing beef since that's all I had on hand, plus I added about a teaspoon of fresh thyme leaves about 10 minutes before serving...my husband raved!  Thanks for sharing!

The only changes I made were that I added a teaspoon of crushed horseradish out of a jar I had in the refrigerator and used a can of Cream of Mushroom soup instead of fresh mushrooms.  For the wine, I used a good Merlot, which I used in cooking the meat and then drank some Merlot with the meal.   I used beef stew meat and simmered it on the stove until it was tender.

I boiled my meat so it wouldn't take over an hour to finish and I was in a rush. I didn't put wine in it cause I don't drink nor do I care to cook with it. I used dry mustard, and I sautee my mushrooms, garlic, onions together.   Other than this it tasted very good. I'll make it again only with more time to cook better, I'm guessing my guy didn't mind and my grandchildren like it...

This turned out so good! I accidentally threw away the leftover marinade so just added more wine to the mix when it was time to add the leftover marinade. I didn't like it  so thick so I used a whole cup of beef broth.  Next time I will omit the cream cheese and sour cream because the sauce tasted great and was very flavorful even before adding those two ingredients.  Plus I really don't need those extra calories!  I served it over rice and my husband loved  it and said it was a "keeper"! I will definitely make it again. Next time, I will also sauté the onions, garlic and mushrooms all at the same time to save time and hassle and I don't think it will really matter much to add the mushrooms earlier.

Great base recipe that is  flexible to small changes.  I used this recipe to save a flavorless Denver cut chuck steak we bought. I hate cooking with wine so I used some rum instead. I completely forgot about the pepper flakes but the sauce was very good without them. This took some time, but I think it was worth it.

This is one of the best things I've made in a while. The only change I made was I used 1/2c of sour cream and 4oz of cream cheese (half a brick). Otherwise followed as directed. The only change I would make is use only 1tsp of pepper flakes. I liked the heat, but others thought I was a tad too much heat. Other than that everyone loved this meal.

marinate, every time!  I use grass fed ground beef, and all wine rather than beef broth.  I've tried a merlot, but I didn't care to much for the color, a lighter color would leave a less pinkish hue- though flavor is OK either way.  our family does not like the addition of red pepper flakes.  unflavored yogurt is all I ever have on hand, so I use that instead of sour cream and cream cheese both.  this is a staple meal for our family!

Really great flavor. I served over Spinach noodles. 
Only suggestion is to let the meat simmer on very low heat for longer than suggested. However, I will be making this recipe again. Yum!

Delicious!! I used 1/2 tsp of red pepper flakes which was just right. Also, the cream cheese MUST be softened otherwise it doesn't fully blend into the sauce. I will absolutely make this again. I made this at my husband's request and he loved it!! Thanks

Used tenderloin, shallots instead of onion, skipped the mustard. Very tasty though a little more involved than other easier stroganoff recipes.

My household absolutely loved this recipe! I slightly increased the beef & used sirloin tips just because they were on sale. I also doubled the mushrooms, added another oz cream cheese, another oz of sour cream, and another 1/4 cup red wine, another 1/4 cup beef stock, and another tablespoon of flour. I almost omitted the red pepper flakes completely, but added 1/4 tsp & everyone thought it was *just enough*. I was expecting to have enough for another night's dinner, but there is barely a serving left!

This was REALLY good! The only thing I plan to do differently next time is to double the amount of ingredients used to make the sauce so we end up with more of that. Will probably have to thin it down with a little milk. It was a really delicious sauce, but was thicker than I'd hoped and didn't go that far. I only used 2 lbs of beef and I felt like it needed to be "saucier." I may also add a touch of horseradish for a little extra zing. :-) We will definitely be making this again soon.

Would've been 5 stars but it had way too much red pepper flake. I love spicy food, but this was too spicy even for my husband and I (we had to feed the kids chicken nuggets instead!) I will definitely be making this recipe again, just using much less (maybe half) red pepper flake.

This is one of the best meals I have ever made!  I used sirloin and cut into strips, but other than that followed the recipe on the nose.  I was hesitant to put in TWO hours for such a "simple" dish, but I am GLAD I did!!  The flavors are complex and rich.  I will be making this again.

on a tight budget I used 1.5 lbs of ground beef 2 medium onions and a bag of frozen mixzed veggies as we don't like mushrooms. I added a little extra red pepper and I only had white wine on hand and I have to say it was fantastic!!! I served over garlic buttered noodles. it was gone!

Corn starch is TERRIBLE for us. It clogs our GI Tracts, and constipates us. The same job of thickening our sauces can be achieved by using arrowroot powder, tapioca flour, kudzu root powder just to name 3 alternatives, all of which, most especially the arrowroot powder actually CLEANSE our bowels. Hence "Digestive Cookies" for infants made with arrowroot flour. Corn starch IS good for powdering skin rashes, hahahaa!

This was a delicious recipe my wife and I loved it the only thing we changed is we did not add the red wine the second time we made it the red wine seem to give it a little bit of an off taste for us but the second time we made it without the red wine it was absolutely delicious

Very good. I did not marinate the meat in red wine. In fact, I used ground beef instead because... that's what I had. It was still very good. So, because I used this meat instead, I sauteed the onions right in the pan with the meat. It shaved time off the prep work and still turned out good.

First time making stroganoff. This was simple to follow and was definitely, "not like mom used to make". I had to cut the pepper flakes in half, knowing my families tolerance. But this was absolutely phenomenal. I served it with egg noodles.

Excellent! Though i only used regular beef chuck, couldn't find anything to make strips, so the simmer time in my cast iron was about 25 minutes or less, & 2 cups of mushrooms, with only 1/4 cup wine, with no marinade left as it all soaked the beef.

My family loved it!!! Followed recipe exactly. Husband said it reminded him of the expensive tri-tip version at the Trump golf course restaurant here in L.A. He licked the plate!

This was excellent I didn't have red wine and it turned out just fine without it.  For time saving efforts I cut my meat accordingly and grilled it for 5 mins, but that is truly because i have 3 kids begging me to eat anything at that moment.  I also just realized after dinner has been made and finished for hours that I didn't remember to add the sour cream OR the cream cheese and it tasted just great....I will add that none of the adults here are extremely picky, the kids are though :(

I made this for dinner tonight to share with friends.  We all agreed, it is a keeper for sure.  I did cut back on the crushed red pepper flakes (personal choice) but followed the recipe exactly as printed.  I could have licked the pan, it was that good.  Next time I am going to try it with white wine, just for a comparison.

Amazing. I made two changes. I used petit sirloin steak and a couple of dashes of red chili flakes. Otherwise the rest was as written. The flavor was spectacular. I put the leftovers (there's only two of us) in the freezer for next month. Can't wait to have it again.

Made this exact recipe.  I have never marinated beef in red wine, after browning the meat was not sure if I would like it but once everything is added, it all comes together and is delicious!!  This is a keeper!

This recipe is amazing! The red pepper flakes give it such an awesome kick. If you don't like spicy, definitely omit this ingredient. I'm already planning to make it again for my parents. Soooo gooood!

Simply awesome! Used a 5lb chuck roast, no wine, a couple of pinches of cayenne instead of red pepper flakes, and no cream cheese, just a little more sour cream.  I only put 1t mustard for the double batch,as we have some real haters, and added about 3/4T soy sauce for the zip. As this week it's the low-dough show, used minced onion n garlic from the shaker and fridge, respectively, and mushrooms from the can. Still awesome! I quick sauteed the onion n garlic in a little butter and put them in a bowl, then browned the beef strips in batches, pouring any broth cooked out into the bowl to fluff up the dried minced onion. Made the roux as directed, then dumped everything but the mushrooms in for the hour simmer. At the end of the hour, I added the 'shrooms, turned it down really low, and let it percolate whilst making elbow noodles and rice for our mini army:) Really, couldn't get any easier! Our picky 10 yr old was dancing around the living room, singing my cooking praises... muahahaha!  thanks so much, sanfrancook!

I have made this several times and it is delicious. The substitutions I have done is use Dijon or brown spice mustard as I like the flavors on those better.  I have used white wine, red wine and sherry wine and red wine vinegar and and no variation of wine I like them all but I like it best with red wine.  The last variation I have tried is with cream cheese and other different substitutes like Neufchâtel or Greek yogurt and they definitely add creaminess and enhance the flavor profile.  I have also tried it with out and taste still good.  With all that said using the red wine for me is what really puts it on the next level!!

YOU MUST MAKE THESE CHANGES AND IT WILL BE AMAZING! Made this recipe once before and wasn't so crazy about it but gave it another shot and changed a couple things and was amazing! used 1lb ground beef instead of chuck roast, only used 1/2 tsp chili flakes, and used a full can of sliced mushrooms. I think i inhaled dinner, was sooo good!

Awesome!  I Marinated this for about 30 minutes, and added some Adobo seasoning while it was simmering.  I also increased the simmer time to 2 hours.  I did not have fresh mushrooms so I used 2 large cans of mushrooms and sautéed these with a little butter for about 1-2 minutes.  I then added the mushrooms with the sour cream and cream cheese.  Delicious!  Looking forward to making this again!

Excellent recipe. I seldom make a dish exactly as presented because I know what I like and adjust it to my taste; comes with experience. This, however, sounded good as is and it didn't disappoint. It is now my go-to recipe for Stroganoff. Served it with Chianti and a good sourdough and got raves. I will experiment with it by adding a couple of chopped bacon slices to the onion and garlic, and a tablespoon of good bourbon in the sauce just to see how it works. That's one of the joys of cooking; experimentation! And for those of you who thought this was too spicy......you need some serious work on your heat resistance, lol! This just has a pleasant little zing to it. Thanks for the recipe sanfrancook!

Love it! I did alter for tastes as I usually do, -- Stroganoff is I think an eastern european dish, so I wondered if the red pepper flakes was meant to be or could be subsituted with paprika.. I like paprika just not a lot, so I omitted from the recipe and sprinkeled about 1/2 tsp over the serving platter.. It worked for us! I also cut back on the cream cheese.. just seemed really thick.  and next time - I might sub out some of the sourcream for a really good yogurt? Has anyone tried that? Thanks for a great stroganoff

What a wonderful recipe. I am a beginner cook and I found it to be a bit of a challenge and very rewarding! I did cut back on the meat and red pepper flakes(like the kick the pepper flakes add). I also used some low fat ingredients and it came out fantastic. I would recommend this recipe to anyone and it was fun to make!

We loved this, but the amount of red pepper flakes was way too much! I'm going to make again, but will only add about a 1/2 tsp this time.

I read a review that said the recipe was too spicy. I reduced the red pepper to 1 tsp, but used spicy brown mustard, since I didn't have yellow. It worked out fabulously. This was sweet and savory at the same time on the tongue. Upon swallowing, the peppers warm your throat. Only time I've had stroganoff prior was hamburger helper. This isn't in the same class. Waaaayyy better! Rock this with broccoli or asparagus, and red wine! She will bow before you!

what a great recipe! this was super yummy! I put in to much red pepper( more than what was called for) so it was super spicy but i loved all the different flavors of this stroganoff! I didn't put in the mushrooms because we don't care for them.  I will be making this recipe again.  My boyfriend thought it was restaurant worthy.

I followed the recipe to the letter, except for the red pepper flakes.  Following other's advice here, I cut this down to 1/2 teaspoon and it was more than enough.  I liked the zip that the pepper flakes added, and I love spicy food, but 2 teaspoons would be overwhelming.  The sauce is very thick and delicious.  I can see where some may want to thin down the sauce a bit.  Overall, very good recipe.

This is the only stroganoff to use in my opinion.  No one in our family likes mushrooms but we all eat them in this recipe!  I use a stoneground mustard and sirloin tips cut into small pieces across the grain.

I thought this recipe was wonderful. Only reason I gave it 4 vs 5 stars was that I found that the red pepper was a bit overpowering. I would use 1/2 the amount next time. I also found the prep time to be longer than listed which is not a big deal, just good to know if you are in a time crunch. Otherwise, great!!

This recipe always turns out delicious. We can't get cream cheese or mushrooms easily or cheaply here, but it is still creamy and rich without them. I have never had to simmer it for one hour, I think the sauce would be a little thick.  The red pepper flakes are divine in there but I'm the only one who can take the heat in my family. We've served it over rice and egg noodles and it's simply delicious. This is my go-to meal for guests because I can count on it turning out delicious.

I reduced the red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon, no cream cheese, dash of red wine. Pretty good although I'd probably try it in the crock pot next time for more tender beef.

Thanks so much for this recipe. My mom use to make beef stroganoff when I was a child and I have been searching for a recipe that compared.  She passed without me getting her recipe.  This was spot on.  It brought back so many wonderful memories.  The only thing I did different from the recipe was to add the wine into the sauce without marinating the beef. I will be cooking this for my sisters who also enjoyed my moms beef stroganoff.

This was a fabulous Sunday dinner for 4 and the best stroganoff I have made in some time.  I followed the recipe to the letter although did use some extra flour to thicken the sauce.  I served it over egg noodles that had been buttered with poppy seeds, a hearty green salad and multigrain bread with oil and balsamic dipping sauce.

Five stars because taste is wonderful. While we love spices, I have to agree with others that the crushed red pepper should be reduced a bit. It took over the flavor.

This came out a flavourful pasta and meat dish but did NOT taste like stroganoff. First of all, to me stroganoff is just not a spicy dish.. . but with the red pepper it wss quite so. Second I'm not sure what I was supposed to get but with 2 lbs of meat and only half a cup of wine I pretty much had NO marinade left to "reserve". I did leave out the onions {my family doesn't like} but I don't think that was why it didn't come out quite as expected. But again~ a flavourful pasta dish... just not quite stroganoff.

This is absolutely decadent.  I left out the mushrooms, reluctantly, as my teenagers don't like.  Only modification to consider...reduce red pepper flakes.  I loved, but the family thought a bit spicy.  Not kidding, I was sopping up the gravy and eating while cleaning up....was that good.  Served with some country green beans and fresh tomatoes. Yum.

This is hands-down the BEST stroganoff I've ever made...and I've made a lot of different kinds.  One slight modification:  cut the red paper flakes down to 1/2 tsp. and it gave it just the right amount of heat without making it overwhelming.  Recipe is delicious and impressive enough to serve to company.  It's a keeper!

Whole family loved it. With small children, I did reduce the red pepper flakes to 1/2 teaspoon. We had to use ground beef (2lb) and doubled the roux/sauce and it was perfect.

I was afraid an old chuck roast just wouldn't be tender...but I was SO WRONG!  This was really yummy...and TENDER...who'da guessed?!  Only thing I would do differently is use either dry mustard or maybe dijon...the yellow came thru with too "bright" a flavor...didn't ruin it, but I think the other options would make great even better.

I've made this in the past exactly as written as well as with changes & it's always delicious, & it's a great way to use chuck roast when it's on sale for super-cheap. I use a smaller roast, usually around 2 1/2 lbs, but use the full amount of the other ingredients so there's plenty of sauce. I don't really marinade the beef the full 10 minutes, but rather put the wine/salt/pepper in a bowl, add the beef as I cut it up & give it a few stirs until I'm done cutting & it's time to cook. I don't bother drying the beef with a paper towels, & if I don't have red wine I substitute beef broth & use half the amount of salt in the marinade. It's also good with canned mushrooms or no mushrooms; yellow or dijon mustard. And the red pepper flakes I currently have are a Mexican brand so I know they're hotter than most brands, so I've been using half the amount.

Used chicken instead of beef, still tasty. Took recommendations from reviews and used a dash of chili powder instead of red pepper flakes, it was awesome.

I found this to be a great meal, my family loves it.  I cut the pepper flakes in half and used sirloin steak for the meat, came out perfect!  Thanks for another great meal!

I followed the recipe to the letter...it was amazing. My husband had seconds and when he found out that his second portion finished off what I had made he literally went "awwwwwwwwww" and got upset. Made this and gave some to my babysitter because she works for food and she LOVED it. I'm eating it now and my mouth is doing a happy dance. This is SO worth the work!!

This recipe is delicious and by far the best stroganoff recipe I have found!  The meat was a bit tougher than I would have liked but that was me.  I used stew meat (grad school budget) and even though I let it simmer 2 hrs it could have used another 30-45 minutes to be fall apart tender, but I got impatient. I also halved the red pepper (I like spicy but not in my stroganoff) and added a tsp each of oregano and basil.  But this will be my go-to recipe from now on for stroganoff.

This is the best stroganoff I have ever had! I've been making it more simply for over 10 years. But this is much better and ill be my go to from now on. The only changes I made were: 1/2 the red pepper (plenty spicy!), used sour cream in place of cream cheese. I also used a T-bone steak for the meat as that's what I had on hand. In addition, I used a whole pack of mushrooms.

This was absolutely delicious!  I will definitely be making it again.  I pretty much followed the recipe exactly as shown, only used beef tenderloin instead of beef chuck roast.  This really turned out fantastic!

Didn't love the flavor as is, so I added half a package of onion soup mix and a little more beef broth. Made it superb!

So delicious! I followed the recipe exactly except I omitted the sour cream and cream cheese because it simply didn't need them! Plus, the hubs is super picky on certain ingredients! He loved this one though! One HUGE plus to this recipe is that it makes enough sauce for the whole family to put over noodles. With other recipes i find myself having to double or sometimes triple the ingredients just for everyone to have enough sauce! I definitely will be making this again! Thanks for sharing your recipe ;)

Wow.  This was fantastic.  We used sirloin steak and plenty of a (sadly) sub-par cabernet sauvignon, cut the pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp, and omitted the cream cheese.  The velvety sauce was completely worth all that butter. Definitely a keeper for special occasions.

A wonderful rich and creamy flavour, just as the title claims.  The crushed red pepper added some spicy complexity to the dish, which I absolutely loved.  I will never go back to my old stroganoff recipes. From here on out, I plan on using dry mustard (in smaller quanity) instead of prepared yellow mustard.

Delectable, and worth the effort, but boy does it include some fat calories!  There's no such thing as a 3-oz package of cream cheese (typo!), however, heeding other people's dislike of its inclusion, I only put about that much in.  Perhaps those that've complained about toughness didn't marinate in the wine long enough?  My meat practically melted in your mouth.  Sauce yearns for some kind of herb.

I was very surprised at how well this turned out.  Now! For those of you, like me, will have to finish the bottle of wine while finishing this recipe, use less mustard, and add more wine to everything.  It tastes phenomenal no matter how much you stray from the original recipe.  I used stew meat rather than a more expensive cut and it was a hit with my entire family of picky eaters.  also, make sure to put on the noodles or what ever you are serving this over, when you add the stew meat ( i only simmered it about 30 minutes.)

Very good.  Only thing I would change is better cut of meat or marinate longer.  Flavor is wonderful.

I liked this stroganoff but wasn't wowed by it. If someone wants to cook this for me, I'll happily eat it.  But I don't think I want to go through this much work again for, in my opinion, a 3 to 4 star recipe.

What I liked: the zing of the red pepper flakes - but definitely cut in half or less!

What I didn't like: the cream cheese addition.

Beware: Unless you keep adding additional water as it simmers, the sauce will be way too thick.

Good.  Took about 2 hours for the meat to be tender.  I also doubled the gravy ingredients and served over hot noodles.  I did not add the sour cream or cream cheese at the end (I forgot and everyone was hungry as it took longer than expected.)

I used this for leftover tenderloin from the holidays. I used 1/2 the pepper flakes and still overwhelmed the dish.  Would reduce to 1/2 teaspoon next time.

Until I found this recipe, I had never attempted Beef Stroganoff.  Being brave, I went for it for a Christmas gathering with friends.  LOVED this recipe!!!  Friends asked for the recipe and made sure I knew they'd be happy to "guinea pig" again for me anytime I wanted to make it again (and again)!!! which I will.  Since I'm allergic to wine I substituted balsamic vinegar which added great flavor.  All I can say is, "You gotta try this!"

I was expecting a lot more from this recipe based on all the incredible reviews, but was pretty disappointed. I must have just done something wrong because mine didn't turn out great. I served it on top of egg noodles. Next time I will try beef tenderloin like a previous poster suggested.

I don't see how this recipe would have worked at all if I hadn't added almost 2 cups of liquid and cut the pepper flakes down to 1/2tsp (my kids aren't crazy about super spicy). Anyway, with the extra water it had an over all good flavor, it just would have been a solid lump without it.

I thought the recipe was great!!! I listened to the reviews and cut the red pepper flakes in half. It was still pretty hot. (And we love spicy food). I would only put 1/4 teaspoon of red pepper flakes. The flavor was awesome!!! I will keep this recipe for sure.

This recipe was amazing.  Tastiest Beef Stroganoff I've ever had.  My husband and toddlers ate it all in record time!  Only changes I made was added an extra clove of garlic, 1 cup of wine and fresh 4 or 5 sprigs of chopped fresh dill.  Delicious!

Made this for the first time and my husband and I really enjoyed it. I used a tougher cut of beef so I marinated it longer in the red wine. I  used a bit more beef broth and as others had recommended, used only a pinch red pepper flakes, next time I will use slightly more. This dish was flavourful, rich and creamy.

YEP! I chose to add a little less flour and a little more stock to the base (may be because I am at a high altitude), but the combo of sour cream, cream cheese and red pepper will keep your taste buds excited for every bite. Tenderloin would have been an excellent substitution to the chuck, but a good cut of chuck is more cost effective.

Love it! I skipped the sour cream and cream cheese step and it was still very creamy and delicious!

Very tasty and rich!  The only change I made was use 1 tsp. of the red pepper flakes which was just right for us.  Served over noodles.

My husband thought this stroganoff was the BEST I've ever made. This does take a while to prepare but it was worth it. Didn't change too much except did not have cream cheese so I doubled the sour cream. Still was yummy. Also used dijon mustard instead of yellow mustard. Thanks for the recipe SanFrancook. I will make again when I have the energy. :)

This was a bit of work but very good!  I generally followed the recipe though reduced the amount of red pepper flakes and added extra garlic.  I also used Dijon mustard instead of regular mustard.  My husband really enjoyed this dish!

I loved this dish! I modified it as follows: I did NOT marinade the meat. I simply pan-fried the whole uncut steak then sliced it afterwards . I liked how the middle maintained a little bit of pink so it didn't get overcooked. At the point in this recipe where you would add the marinade I simply poured in some nice wine, the mustard and the Worcestershire. I also did not cook the meat for an hour to tenderize it, as stated in the recipe. The flavors really came together with my cooking it all at one sitting and my family loved it.

I didn't have fresh mushrooms so I used canned and fried them with the onions and garlic.  I followed the recipe otherwise and it had an ok flavor.  I am not impressed.  Will not make again. P.S. I cooked it closer to 2 hours.
