I used this marinade for some chicken breasts and left it to marinate for 2 days.  I don't know how but I forgot to add the milk!  I didn't get to taste this but the bf stated it was the best & most tender chicken he ever had, so on his behalf this is a 5 star recipe.  Next time I might even add the milk (& there will be a next time).  Many thanks for sharing your recipe.

I think this would taste better on pork or chicken rather than beef.

I marinaded chicken in this for 24 hours. The chicken didn't even have any flavor when I was done with it. The chicken didn't taste bad, but I might as well have not done anything to it beforehand because it would have tasted the same.

Simple and good but I think this would be better on chicken. Regardless of the protein you choose, this definitely needs some salt. Other than that this is good as written.

I used this marinade on chicken breast chunks for kebabs.  I salted the chicken right before grilling.  My family loved it.
