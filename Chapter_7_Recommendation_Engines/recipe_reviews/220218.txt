I live in Alaska and have halibut in the freezer.  After I came home from my husband's company pot luck where someone had brought Halibut Enchiladas, I had to make some for myself.  Found this recipe on Allrecipes.com.  Very good and very close to the taste I was looking for.  In the future I will lighten it up a bit with reduced fat sour cream and cream cheese.

I live in Alaska and somehow managed to get myself a husband who isn't a fan of fish.  I am always looking for halibut recipes that he'll actually eat without complaint.  This was, by far, my greatest success!  He HIGH-FIVED me, complimented the meal, and has eaten leftovers with enthusiasm!  Our son and I also enjoyed these enchiladas greatly.  I followed the recipe, but omitted the butter, used a little extra lemon juice, and used light cream cheese.  Delicious!
