Delicious!  Did half the recipe and only added 1/4 tsp of vanilla. 

My husband loved it!

Super simple, quick, and tastes a lot better than store bought whip! Minus all the extra ingredients that you don't need! Now that I know how fast and easy it is to whip up, I'll never buy store bought whip again.

Most people turn to cream in a can (aerosol style whipped cream) or worse...a concoction claiming to be “cool whip” which is actually oil based -who wants that?! This topping/whipped cream is noticeably  different with the addition of vanilla. It’s also more sturdy than aerosol style whipped cream. It’s so quick to make, why buy the other stuff?
