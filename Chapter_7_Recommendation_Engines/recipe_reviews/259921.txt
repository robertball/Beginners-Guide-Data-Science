These are tasty little cakes that are quick and easy to make.  2 
cups blueberries is way too much for 6 ramikens, 1 1/4  cups would be more than enough. Also a little bit more ginger would enhance the flavors . Overall we really liked them.

I made it strictly according to the recipe.  My husband who is very fond of desserts, and really likes blueberries LOVED it!  Although I make different desserts for him all the time, he thinks I'm a marvel for making this great dessert.  We were both blown away with the texture and taste of the cake itself.  I've never had a cake with that texture.  Thank you, Kim, for a keeper.  In answer to the question asked by someone about the size of ramekins, mine are 9 oz. and were perfect.

I haven’t made it yet.  I need to acquire the ramekins, but I find that they are all sold by ounce size.  I have four already that have an inside measurement of 4” and they are huge and deep.  Couldn’t possibly work.  Please tell me the ramekin size by volume.
It won’t let me submit my question without a star rating, so I will give it 5 stars, because it looks fantastic.

I put it in a 6x8 glass pan. It needed about 45 minutes to finish. It was good with some homemade whip cream.  We would make it again!

The recipe worked perfectly in my 6 tin Jumbo Muffin pan. The flavors are well balanced between tart and sweet. The cake component is delightful. I will definitely make this again! Thank you, Kim!

I just ate two of these, they are so good.

I followed the recipe as is, but baked them for 40 - 45 minutes.

This  was very easy and good...and it looked the same as the photos. My husband said this is a keeper for our dinner parties and a co-worker said it tasted perfectly balanced. I mixed blueberries and raspberries-yes you may need more ramikens. Needed a little bit more brown sugar and butter mix to drizzle down. I messed up and added the lemon juice and the zest to the berries; but then added a little more juice to the batter. It became less sweet,  but it was equally sweet and tart.

This made attractive little cakes topped with whipped cream.   The texture of the cake was spot on.  Everyone enjoyed them.
