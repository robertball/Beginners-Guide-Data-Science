This is a solid recipe.  I made these using a cast iron skillet - sear one side, flip and then the skillet goes into the 425 oven.  Only cook to about 145 though and then allow to rest.   "USDA recommends cooking all whole cuts of meat to 145 °F as measured with a food thermometer placed in the thickest part of the meat, then allowing the meat to rest for three minutes before carving or consuming."

Great recipe!  My husband loves breaded pork chops and this was perfect for dinner for two.  It has a nice combination of flavors and is very simple to make.  I followed the recipe exactly and baked them at 375 for 15 minutes vs. 425 to avoid dry pork.  Overall, very tasty.

So good my Parmesan cheese hating husband scarfed his pork chop right up and requested I not forget to make these again.  That’s quite a tribute! I altered the recipe slightly so as to make it work better for me – first, I had boneless chops and found the stint in the oven unnecessary.  A few minutes in the fry pan on each side was not only sufficient, it was perfect, tho’ I did de-glaze the pan with some white wine, allowing the chops some simmering time while it reduced. The chops were tender and juicy and the crumb coating stayed put.  I added garlic powder to the salt and pepper seasoning, fearing fresh minced might burn during the sautéing.  Finally, I used fresh, minced sage from my garden.  The lemon zest was an unexpected and pleasant addition which I would not recommend omitting.

Easy and great tasting... excellent recipe! I've made this twice now and the only adjustment I make is to reduce the breadcrumb/cheese mixture by 2/3, since as written I throw away most of it because it makes too much.

Very nice.   I am currently following a strict low g.i. diet, so I left out the flour and the breadcrumbs, and they still came out great.  Dipped the chops into just beaten egg, then the seasoned parmesan cheese.  The lemon zest is an important lift, I think, to this - keeps it from feeling too heavy.  Thanks for the great recipe that I was easily able to alter a bit for my low g.i. needs.

I loved adding a new option to cooking pork chops which usually end up losing their moisture along the way. Surprisingly, I used 1" thick Bone in Pork Chops and the results were a tender, flavorful meal. Additionally, if you happen to be a chef that imbibes libations from time to time, you can grate extra lemon zest and contribute part to a Martini Shaker and part to your Martini Glass. You can also use the lemon that was grated for the lemon juice needed for a wonderful, lemon drop Martini. 2/12/2013

This was really delicious cooked exactly as written.  The lemon zest gives it a great flavor.  I reserved some of the bread crumb mixture because it seemed like far too much (and it was) and used it to coat some lightly oiled zucchini rounds which I baked.  The taste was incredible.  Also served with artichokes with some wasabi mayonnaise.  We are excited to have this again, thanks for sharing.

this as amazing!! do not leave out the lemon - really adds to the flavor of this dish. I cooked them at 375° for 15-20 min in the oven after browning. The most juicy pork chop I have ever had. two thumbs up from my pork chop hating husband as well. served with green beans and rice pilaf. fantastic!! cannot wait to make again. as other reviewers stated - the bread crumb mixture makes A LOT so maybe half the bread crumbs are needed for only two chops.
baking tip - I have a small rack I put in a baking dish and put the chops on that when in the oven, that way both sides stay crispy

This was our dinner tonight; it was so delicious!!  My hubby said he loved the mix of flavors and the breading mixture was light and stayed nice & crispy.  I have a hard time making something that he truely loves, as he is an amateur gourmet chef himself and does most of the cooking in our house.  This one is a keeper.  The lemon zest, sage and parmasean cheese in the breading was very flavorful!

Very easy with good results, used 1/3 less flour and also 1/3 less bread crumbs and parmesan.  Next time I'll add more sage and put it in the flour.

This is the best I have found. But I cook 4-6 chops, so I at least double the egg. I use panko crumbs instead, much more crunchy. I usually don't have the lemon so I've been leaving it out. Still turns out the best!

I made these chops for my husband's b'day dinner and they were a HIT!  Loved the addition of the lemon zest.  I only had powdered sage and thought it might overwhelm the dish but it did not and was delicious with the parmesan beadcrumb mix.  He ate the other chop the next day after I had re-heated in the microwave and it was still Fabulously flavorful.  Will definitely make these again.

These were very good.  I made as directed but would add a little more seasoning next time.  I pan seared in a cast iron skillet, then directly into the oven without having to use two pans.  The flour and parm amounts were way to much for two chops.

Good recipe. Easy to put together and delicious to boot. If you are making a larger batch, keep in mind that you don't need to adjust the breading mixture as much as the recipe calls for (egg and flour adjustments are fine). I ended up with a lot of wasted breading when I increased the serving amount.

Making this recipe for the 2nd time. It is very simple and we like the flavor. The pork chops stay nice and moist, too. The only thing I did differently this time was squeezing lemon juice into the beaten egg because I did not have a whole lemon on hand to zest. It is a small detail and did not seem to matter. Thanks for sharing!

These pork chops were excellent. The lemon zest and sage really made these special. I did use freshly grated parmesan rather than the canned cheese. My chops could have used a couple of hits with the meat mallet as they were a touch tough. The bread crumb mixture could be cut in half.  I did pile on some of the leftover crumb mixture atop the chops before I put them in the oven as the freshly grated parmesan wasn't sticking to the chops. Sooo good with the toasted cheese!

Very good recipe for pork chops!   It is a quick and easy keeper with great taste!  Made this with a homemade mushroom sauce, brown rice and steamed broccoli and it was eaten up in no time!  Definitely will make this one again - the sage was a great seasoning to use!

I had 3 pork chops and based on other reviews, cut the breading mixture by 1/3 or so and still had plenty left over.  I didn't have any lemons to zest, so I added a splash of lemon juice to the egg.  Tasted all right, but had to cook quite a bit longer than suggested and ended up a bit dry.  But that's why I don't cook pork; it's a pain to get right.  Might try again if I get stupid and buy pork chops again, haha.

This was very good. I made exactly per recipe, except I didn't have breadcrumbs, and made my own, adding in Mrs. Dash's Italian seasoning. I will make it again, but I think I'll add a little more spice to the breadcrumb mix. Thank you for the nice recipe.

Very good recipe, however, the cooking temps and times were very long. I pan sauteed for about 8 minutes (four on each side), then put in a 400 degree oven for about 5 minutes and they were slightly overcooked. Next time, I will most likely just finish them in the pan.

Only had two pork chops so I cut the breading ingredients in half. Seared them in a cast iron skillet and baked them at 400 for 15 minutes or so in the same skillet. Really tasty, liked the hint of lemon and the chops were tender. Will definitely use this recipe again.

My husband really liked it but I think I got too much salt in the flour mix.  With the salt in the parmesan cheese it was a bit much for my taste.  I also didn't have the lemon.  Next time, more lemon and less salt.

Oh these turned out sooo good! I took the advice of another review and baked them for 15 minutes at 375 and they were so moist and delicious! This is now a cornerstone recipe in my book!

I made this for my boyfriend and I last night and it was delicious. I am not an experienced cook and didn't know what to expect. The batter made the coating over the pork chop fluffy and crunchy, kind of like battered fish. I used shredded parmesan, rather than grated and it worked well. I was surprised with how much the taste of the lemon zest came through. Very good, we will be having this again!

Excellent recipe! I did tweak the seasoning-- more pepper, garlic salt instead of regular salt, and some oregano. I made 4 chops and have enough dry mix to make 2-4 more. May want to reduce the bread crumb/parmesan quantities depending on how many you are making.

My husband loved this, I too kept in in the pan and transferred it it the oven.  Shortened the cooking time and let it rest for a few minutes.  It was moist and very tender.  I like spice and added some Cajun season to the breading,  and mixed up the bread crumbs to include whole wheat, Italian and Panko crumbs, which gave it a nice crunch. A keeper for sure!

I used lean pork loins instead and the meat was very moist and the breading was very flavorful and tasty- and not too heavy like other pork dishes that are to heavily seasoned or smothered in sauces. I paired it with sliced apples, the baked apples gave it another layer of flavor and a soft texture. Delicious! I recommend.

This was DELICIOUS!  The only change I made was to use lemon pepper in place of the lemon zest. SO good!  I made 10 chops, used my silpat and baked at 450 for about 20 minuter.  Chops were golden brown, juicy and tender.  Will absolutely be making this again!

This recipe was delicious. I used my cast iron skillet to brown the pork chops and then just left the chops in the skillet and put that in the over. The crust was so flavorful. Saving this one for sure.

Delicious flavor! I didn't read the recipe well and mixed the flour, salt, & pepper in with the bread crumb mixture but it still turned out fine. I added a little panko and used asiago cheese instead of parmesean.  I will def make this again!

Fantastic.  I followed the recipe to the letter without reading any reviews before hand.  I used 3 boneless centre cut pork chops and found them very tasty and juicy.  I noticed I had a lot of bread/parm mixture left over, so I might cut that in half next time I make this recipe.

Tasted great and were nice and tender.  I didn't have a lemon so I used True Lemon, and my chops exceeded the recommended temperature in less than 10 minutes.  Otherwise I followed the instructions exactly and was very pleased with the result. Very good breading.

Great recipe!! Although when I tripled the recipe I ended up having to throw away a lot of the bread crumb mixture (in which I had put in lemon pepper seasoning instead of lemon zest).  I used 10 small boneless pork chops, which fried up quicker, and they still cooked well within that 10 to 15 minute window.  Add some rice and beans and it was a very tasty dinner!  Will be adding this to my personal cookbook :)

This is super easy and tastes good! Due to a last minute kitchen accident I ended up with no eggs. I subbed milk and it still worked great. I served with mashed potatoes and green beans. It was wonderful.

Made it with bone in chop instead of boneless and regular bread crumbs instead of Italian seasoned.

This was really good.  I followed other suggestions and cooked at 375 for 15 minutes.  My 2 chops were bone in and quite thick and if I had cooked longer or at a higher temp, they would've been dry.

I used gluten free flour and bread crumbs and next time I will cut it down to 1/3 of those ingredients, since I threw away far too much.

we used regular thickness pork chops.  I had to add a tablespoon of egg whites because one egg wasn't enough and a bit more flour.  My daughter declared that there wasn't enough lemon rind, so we used about a tablespoon of freshly grated lemon rind.  the extra lemon really brought out the flavor of the cheese.  yummy.  5 stars with the extra lemon.

Very good and moist! I didn't have Italian Breadcrumbs so I used plain and added Italian Seasoning and Garlic Powder.  I also used a cast iron pan as others suggested and didn't have a rack that fit so instead, I took 2/3 of my 'naked' lemon and sliced it into 4ths as I had 4 pork chops before putting them in the oven (set to 375 as some others suggested), I slide a slice of lemon underneath each to keep the chops out of the fat and add a little more flavor, which  also caused caused a crust on both sides. I also added a more of the Parmesan mixture on top, a little too much, next time I will use less. I cooked them for about 20 minutes but mine were boneless and about an inch thick. I cooked them until they were about 145 and then let them rest as I cooked the asparagus and finished up the noodles.  I took the last of the lemon (sliced and cut in quarters) and added it to the water (brought the water and lemon to a boil first) I was using to cook the asparagus. Also served some rotelle noodles tossed with  garlic infused olive oil,  a bit  of butter and  grated Parmesan cheese. Kids loved it, even the picky boy! Yes, a very cohesive meal and may be too boring for some but the boy prefers his flavors "match, not fight". As you can guess, its a challenge to find a meal he likes.
The chops had a wonderful lemony flavor and not overly greasy, with using the lemon slices in cooking, I will add more Sage next time.

This was a very good, solid pork chop recipe. I made it just as written, using 3 bone-in 1” thick chops. After 3-4 minutes per side in a cast iron skillet, they cooked in a 375 oven for about 20 minutes and came out nice and moist. The flavor in the breading was just perfect and everyone liked them. I will definitely add this to my rotation!

This is a tasty recipe but the cooking time is way off.  I cooked mine on the stove as directed but only 10 minutes in the oven and they were still way overcooked. I also made five chops instead of two and I still had a lot of breadcrumbs left over.

I've made this twice now. Instead of using egg, though, I drag the chops through a lemon vinaigrette. And cooking to about 150° is perfect. Chops are nice and moist!

I used boneless pork loin chops in a cast-iron skillet. This was surprisingly easy and excellent! Served with baked potato and french style green beans. Pinot Noir an excellent pairing (but a hearty Chardonnay would work as well).

I made this, but instead of putting it in the oven I pan seared it with herbs and garlic then finished it in the oven. My husband said it was the best porkchop he had ever eaten, and requested it again that same week. Excellent recipe! This has become a family favorite with roasted potatoes and brussel sprouts.

My husband asked for breaded pork chops and I made these. He really loved them. He said the only change he’d request is a little more salt. I think I may reduce the Parmesan a tad too but otherwise liked this too. Also, in place of oil, I cooked with bacon grease. Came out nice and crispy!

Made this gluten free with Garbanzo flour and GF bread crumbs. Was out of lemons, but it was still tasty!

I make this for my husband; he absolutely loves it!  I buy a thick boneless chop from Whole Foods and have them slice it in half, lengthwise.

it worked well with  4 boneless pork chops. the meat was super juicy and delicious! I used extra sage and extra flour.  One I like sage a whole lot and two why not add extra flour since you might run out. Everything else was doubled since I made 4 thick chops!

We eat a ton of Pork and this is going to be in our regular rotation!

DELICIOUS!! I did have to alter the recipe to accommodate my Ketogenic way of eating and my husband’s Gluten Free Sensitivity— I omitted the flour and Breadcrumbs but used the Delicious seasonings with my Parmesan and Egg! The Flavor is still having a dance party in my mouth !  Oh- I also hammered out the pork and squeezed some of the lemon juice from my zested lemon on the pork then sprinkled with Parmesan cheese, dipped in egg and then rolled it in the Parmesan cheese/ lemon zest and sage mixture! It was extremely helpful to have a Delicious concept that I was able to tweak!!

I thought this turned out well.  I substituted lemon pepper for lemon zest, poultry seasoning instead of just sage, and added parsley flakes on top to dress it up a little.  Served with Garlic and Olive oil Couscous and lite pilsner beer.  Highly recommended.  I wasn't too pleased with the presentation of it, but it looked ok I guess.

I tend to rest the chops for at least 10 minutes or so after the dredging to help the coating adhere. 

Easily one of the favorite dishes we make - for us and for friends! They love it! Best served with mashed potatoes & green beans we think... but brussel sprouts & quinoa make it into the meal often enough!

Easy to make and full of flavor.  Parmesan is a favorite in our house and we loved the addition of sage, which added some depth.  I definitely look forward to making these again.

We've made these 100+ times!  They are a family favorite and now a neighborhood favorite as well!  We love the combination of flavors and we do very little to change the recipe.
For starters, we never do the double dredging... just don't think it needs it.  Simply put the pork in the mixture (no egg/flour dredge) and it adheres just fine without the extra.  We also do not add the butter at the end just to save some calories.  We do use 3/4" thick boneless cuts and it's fantastic every single time!

OMG! These were so good, I used my Dutch oven after reading the review of someone using their cast iron frying pan to sear and go straight in the oven; saves a small step and dirties one less pan! These were flavorful, juicy and a new favorite. Thanks

I made this recipe as it was written except for a suggestion of cooking it at 325 for 15 minutes so not to dry pork out. I give it a five star. The flour measurement wasn't enough to flour both pork chops so I added 1 tbsp more. This was very delicious. Definitely made it to my must have to make again. No changes needed to this recipe ingredients. WTG to the one who posted this recipe

I made this exactly according to the recipe.  It seemed to me that the parmesan cheese made the chop a bit "dead".  I made it without the cheese, and it became a very good "go-to" for a fall day.  I plan to experiment with panko crumbs combined with the Italian bread crumbs.

This was a really good recipe. I used lemon pepper since I didn't have lemon zest and it gave a good lemon flavor. I also baked them in the oven on a sheet pan with no pan frying.

I was looking for a recipe for boneless pork chops that was different from the usual. THIS was one of the best recipes I have had in a very long time. I changed it minutely by using parmesan - Romano cheese. I also used garlic pepper and garlic salt.  I took the advice of a reviewer and put the chops on a rack over a sheet pan to keep them nice and crispy and lowered the temp to 375. like I said small changes but the basic recipe will be my go to from now on! Thank you for taking a boring meal and changing it into an awesome dinner!

I am not a fan of pork chops but its important to me that my family and I eat healthy.  Pork is a lean, white meat so it goes into the dinner rotation.   I couldn't believe how delicious these were!  I loved them.   I followed the recipe exactly except I had baked potatoes baking at 350F and I only have one oven so I baked the chops on that temp for almost 30 minutes.  They were moist and perfect.   Such an easy recipe!  I used bone in chops and did pound them.

Simple recipe.  Super quick.  I've made it twice (command performance), in the past week.  My only modification was to increase the amount of oil in the browning step to accommodate 4 versus 2 chops.  
Make it, enjoy it.

Loved it, and so did my kids which is a big win in my house. Followed the directions as is. I did swerve some lemon juice on the chops when they were done. Fantastic!

I made this just as th recipe stated.  The breading browned way too much when browned in the time given.  I think next time I will skip the Browning process and go right to the oven.  The flavor would come out more.  Not sure I will make it again but they did come out moist.

This is a really good chop recipe that my husband enjoys every time I make it. However, I never seem to have sage nor lemon for zest on hand when I make it, so they get omitted. I agree with others that there's a ton of Parmesan/crumb mix left over, so cut the mesurements in half and it won't be such a waste.

Just to start off... this was amazing! made exactly the way it says. This calls for 2 pork chops I had 5.. I doubled the breading and definitely didn't have to made way too much so next time I will just use what it calls for for 2 lol my husband is not a pork chop fan so wanted to try something different... he had 1 bite and said I'm gonna need another pork chop this is f@#$ing amazing :)  needless to say he was to full   and only ate another 1/2 pork chop lol and is taking the other for lunch tom.... this is definitely going in the recipe book... also I tried the garlic parmesan  red potatos off this site and went very well together ... you should give it a try!! Thanks for the recipe!!

Great recipe and delicious.  Definite keeper.  I used fresh sage and freshly grated Parmesan cheese along with panko bread crumbs since I had all on hand.  I used a case iron skillet and after flipping the porks chops over immediately put pan in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes. Came out perfect.  Otherwise followed recipe as written .

Was looking for something to do with pork chops on a week night, and this would up being amazing! My fiance's new favorite. I made with mashed red potatoes, gravy from the drippings, and roasted corn. Fabulous!

This was delicious. I made it entirely on the stove top. The only issue was the breading came off as I was cutting the meat while eating it. I used Panko breadcrumbs, my favorite. I might increase the sage to give it more flavor the next time I make this. If I could keep the breading on it, I'd give this 5 stars.

Good, easy weeknight recipe with  a very nice flavor combination. The lemon zest brings a surprising lightness to the pork. I'll definitely be cutting down the crumb coating ingredients to half, or even a quarter of what is called for. As written, there is far too much extra; I was sad to see so much go to waste.  A basic recipe, but a keeper.

My husband and I loved this!!!!! I didn't have a zester so I omitted the lemon zest.  I let the pork chops bake in the oven for 20 minutes to ensure they were done.  The flavoring of this was great!! I will definitely be making this again!

I did change it and I'm really making notes to myself.  Wish Allrecipes had a spot to do that.  I left out the egg, flour, butter and lemon zest.  Put all the other ingredients except oil into a gallon zip, kind of guessed on amounts and added some panko.  Rinsed the chops in water and shook them in the seasonings in the ziplock.  I sprayed olive oil in a baking dish and after breading the chops, drizzled olive oil on top, broiled until browned, flipped, oiled and broiled the other side.  Baked 1 inch boneless chops for 25 minutes at 425.  They were moist, flavorful and delicious!  The seasonings in this recipe go really good together.  Yum--

This was the best pork I've ever had! Hubby and kids loved it too! I used others' advice & it couldn't have been better - cut breadcrumbs mixture by half, put lemon in with the egg, use a cast iron skillet to brown then put in the oven for 10 minutes (at most).

Changed the  portion size to 8 people.  I used 10 boneless pork chops and had more than enough of the bread crumbs.  I did add about 1/2 cup of herb seasoned stuffing breadcrumbs that I crushed fine in my blender.  Didn't change anything else.  Whole family enjoyed the chops and I had enough leftover for another meal.  Great reheated in the oven @ 375 for about 15-20 mins.  Turn them over at 10 mins to keep both sides crunchy. 
Will definitely make again.  Think it would be good with chicken too!

Very tasty and the meat was incredibly moist.   I didn't have any lemon zest so I left that out.  I don't think it made a difference.

I have made this before following the recipe. This last time though, I used almond flour,more parmesan cheese,and zest of a whole lemon. I enjoyed the  taste of the lemon,it was not overpowering.

Very easy & flavorful. I decreased the amount of bread crumbs & parmesan, as I had to throw out a large amount left after breading. I replaced the sage with curry for the flavor I like.

Quick and easy.  Only change I made was to bake in the same cast iron pan I had fried in.  Pork was very juicy and tender.  Used 1" thick pork chop.  Oh I did make break crumb mix with half pinko and half plain bread crumbs.  Nice flavorful crust.

Made these last night for my husband.I used bone in pork chops, and cooked accordingly..they didn't need any extra time, but that will depend on the thickness. I don't eat pork chops but my husband says they were good, and really enjoyed the Parmesan in the crust. Probably will make again for him.

Did not have sage on hand so used Bells seasoning instead. Also used bottle lemon juice for the zest. My husband thought they were really good and should make them again. So the recipe is now in my saved list to make again. Thank you for sharing this recipe.

The taste is amazing and very easy. This is something that you can impress at a dinner party without spending a lot of money.  My only suggestion is to only do half of the breadcrumbs/sage/parmesan cheese mixture.  I threw out at least half of it because you don't need this much to cover two pork chops.

We're not usually pork chop fans but these were very good and very moist.  I used 4 thick pork chops, and since others recommended reducing the breading, I actually made a little less than the recipe called for for 2 pork chops;  I still threw most of it away. I set the oven at 375 as someone else suggested and baked it for 20 minutes.  Very tender and juicy with good flavor. My husband loved it.

These might have been the best pork chops I've ever made. Great flavor and very moist. I gave it a 4 for two reasons. The recipe didn't say to cover the pork chops in the oven, but I think this is important to keep them from drying out as they cook. Also the amount of breadcrumbs and Parmesan seemed excessive fo two pork chops ( and mine were good size). I had a whole lot leftover, so I'll be using a bit less next time.
3/5/17 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/4 cup Parmesan was still too much. Next time: 1/4 cup and 2 Tbs.

I'm picky when it comes to pork chops. But when i found this I figured I will give it a try and from reading other reviews cooking in a cast iron pan is a big MUST do. So good.

This recipe is perfect as is and delicious! I used a Dutch oven to fry and bake the pork. After frying I sautéed some chopped onion  in drippings from pork & sprinkled with bouillon before returning pork to pan and baking. Squeezed lemon over pork and topped with fresh basil. Amazing!

Really great pork chops!  Sage and pork are a wonderful combination that mom made growing up. The warmth of the sage and tang of the lemon are mellowed out by the Parmesan cheese. My  three chops were 1 inch boneless.  It took 25 minutes to get up to 160 in the oven.  They were still moist. I did cover with foil.
About the amount of Bread crumbs and Parma cheese, I had a lot left over.  Next time I'll use half what's called for.

Great recipe!  Followed recipe exactly and turned out great!  Would't change a thing!  My only advice is to only use as much of the Parmesan breading at a time as you need it.  Put the rest in the freezer for next time you make the recipe.  I used less than half on six pork chops.  I was glad to have the extra for the next time I make this which will be soon!

The flavors work really well and everything about the pork chops are really delicious.  I just had a problem with the breading falling off in the oven.  I brined the pork chops in 2 T. salt and 2T. sugar with 4 cups of H2o for 45 min before the cooking process.

We love breaded bone-in pork chops so I thought I would adapt this recipe to that.  I pounded the chops so that they would be thin enough to fry in oil without spending additional time to cook in oven (you could do that to the boneless chops too).  I didn't have lemons for zest so I followed others and added bottled lemon juice to beaten eggs.  I am not sure we noticed it.  Then I followed recipe for breading except that I added lemon pepper to both the flour and to a combination of bread crumbs, panko crumbs and parmesan cheese.  Like others I reduced the amount of breading mixture by half.  It was delicious.  Loved the flavor of the cheese in the breading.  Will make again.  It was made in no time since I did not need to use the oven.  Served with Knorr's pasta with parmesan and a salad.

Recipe was a hit. I more than doubled  the seasoning. I also added a generous amount of parsley flakes and 1 clove of fresh garlic per chop. As others noted, I found that the measure of bread crumbs exceeded the need. The chops came out nicely juicy and crunchy.

Fantastic! Definitely use less Parmesan and Breadcrumbs. I used 1/3 cup breadcrumbs and 1/4 cheese and I still had extra. I also used the suggestion to bake them at 375 and it worked great! I ended up baking them for a total of about 19 minutes.

Love these!! So easy and delicious, made exactly as written. The bread crumb cheese mixture is enough for many more pork chops, next time I'll try cutting it in half, seemed like a huge waste. But do make it, they're great!!!

Taste is great! And super easy too. I agree that there is too much breading as written (I did 6 chops- 1.5lbs) with the breadcrumb mixture and still had some leftover. But no big deal, just plan your breading according to your chop size :)

This recipe was terrific!  I will definitely make these pork chops again.  My pork chops were rather thick, so I took the advice of one of the previous reviewers, and baked them in a 375 degree oven for about 30-40 minutes.  They were perfect!

Wow! Made these a few nights ago. As others have said, it makes a HUGE amount of crumbs (guilty: I didn't cut the amount, but will next time). I made the recipe as is, except I used bone-in pork chops (think they have more flavor) and increased baking time by 10 minutes. Might have been too long. Hubs & I loved them!!! What a great recipe.

This has become a regular at our house. The Husband prefers it without the lemon zest though so we leave it out entirely. We also sometimes double dip the chops in the egg and then crumb mixture again.

I normally don't like prom chops, but pork is great for pulling toxins out of the body and I found this recipe. The breaking had a nice crunch, and even with thin cut pork chops they were nice and juicy. The lemon zest seals the flavor nicely! Don't measure my breading, but I use more 1/3 more Parmesan than bread crumbs and it is delicious. Will make these again!

Was easy to make and boyfriend said it tasted good; I think this is very prone to user error however...I couldn't get the breading to stay on the chop very much at all :O 
None the less, a good recipe choice for people trying to up their game in the kitchen

This turned out great! Made it pretty much exactly as called for.  Used a little extra lemon zest and added half a teaspoon of garlic powder to the flour.  Only mistake I made was letting it cook a little longer in the oven because it seemed too juicy when I first took it out.  Ended up being a little dry so lesson learned.  Next time I will take it out at 15 minutes.   Very flavorful and was a big hit!

I skipped the flour and subbed crushed pork rinds for bread crumbs (seasoned with Italian seasoning) but kept the rest of the recipe the same to save on carbs and it was great!  Since USDA recommends 145° I pulled from oven at 140° and allowed to rest as temp continued to rise to recommended temp.  Next time I would cut down on the breading as I did have a lot left over.

This is a great, easy recipe for when you don't want to spend a ton of time in the kitchen.  I made 6 chops, and the recipe was just about right.  After searing on both sides, they came out of the oven in 10 min, ready to eat!  Enjoy!

I made this tonight and it was delicious! The only thing that I changed was that I used lemon pepper instead of lemon peel, because I didn't have any. I also added a little lemon juice to the egg. I followed the cooking instructions and they weren't dry at all. I will definitely make this again! thank you for the recipe!

Followed the recipe except I doubled the fresh sage. I used fresh lemon rind.  These were excellent! My fiancé tolerates pork chops and he said these have to be the best pork chops ever.  He ate all of his.  I made 10 boneless chops, not the breakfast size but still pretty thin.  It took  all of the sage mixture plus I had to double the flour mixture and use two eggs.  We will eat these again, one of the best recipes I have tried so far.

The pork chops were good but I found it to be a lot of work. I often just 'shake n' bake' my pork cops and put then in the oven and they taste as good as this recipe without the flour and dipping in the egg etc. Also, there was a lot of waste with the amounts of breadcrumbs and parmesano cheese.

This recipe is pretty much spot on. Cook times, ingredients, I thought everything was perfect! Smells great while cooking, crispy crust, and deliciously moist inside. The only change I made was cutting the bread crumbs to about 1/3 cup while keeping the 1/2 cup Parmesan (so it was Parm heavy, which is never a problem in my house!). Will make again!

I often substitute the sage with Italian Seasoning and omit the lemon zest or throw a squirt of lemon juice at it after it's done, depending on what I have. This is my main pork chop recipe I use. VERY good, with a nice coating.

Our pork chops turned out moist and delicious. It was quick and easy, not too many ingredients. Will definitely make again.

The crumb mixture makes much more than necessary. I saved half and froze it for next time.

I made this recipe last night. Very tasty and easy to make. I would suggest reducing the ingredients used in the coating as there was quite a bit left over. And I was generous when I rubbed the chops in it before cooking. I just sprinkled a bit on top of each pork before placing them in the oven. I also added a tsp of garlic powder to the mix. The bread crumbs have garlic in the m but it was nice with a little more. If you have a skillet that can go in the oven you can use that for the frying and baking. Great recipe.

Super easy and very tasty. I recommend cutting the breading ingredients by half. I made breaded zuchinni as a side, so just used the leftover breading for that. I did not have lemon zest so used lemon juice and added to the egg mixture as others have suggested.

I baked the chops at 375 for 40 mins because my chops were double thick. The breading mixture is very tasty. Next time I'll try baking at 450.

This was absolutely delicious! This would make great pork chop parms with cheese, sauce, and pasta in the cooler months. The only thing I would change is to make a little more of the flour mix and 1/2 or 2/3 of the breading, way too much, I should have listened to the other reviewers. Otherwise, required ingredients were spot on.

I didn't use nearly the amount of Parmesan or bread crumbs. I probably used about 1/2 cup of the Italian bread crumbs and 1/3 cup grated Parmesan and used 6 pork chops as opposed to 2. I added an extra pinch of the lemon peel and sage into of the pork after searing and before placing in the oven. It was delicious! I also shaved some fresh Parmesan to place on the pork chops when they came out of the oven. My dad is a hobbiest gourmet chef and he loves the pork chops just alongside some herbed rice and a salad!

I was looking for something super easy after purchasing some thin cut pork chops.  These were delicious for something so quick, and I had all the ingredients on hand!  I actually made 8 very thin pork chops without doubling the recipe.  They cooked up very quickly.  I will definitely make these again when I need something quick, different, and not grilled!

Excellent. It was so tasty, but not overpowering. It was also juicy and tender. I loved the taste of the Parmesan, and the crunchiness of the bread crumbs. We made ours gluten free, and it came out amazing. We used gf flour and gf breadcrumbs, but everything else was 100% the same and we used the same directions. I was surprised by the pan-frying AND oven baking, but it came out so juicy! My husband loved it, and he is hard to please when it comes to food. Paired with mashed potatoes and gravy and it was perfect!

Even though it made more crumbs than needed, I put the excess crumbs in the bottom of the pan before baking the pork chops and served them with the chops. Delicious!

Delicious, 5 star in taste, but I am giving it 4 because recipe makes way too much parmesan breadcrumbs. Recipe is for only 2 pork chops. I had 4, but did not increase amounts because it looked like enough. There was so much left after I put the chops in the oven that I thin sliced a large potato and dipped slices in the flour, egg, breadcrumbs, and fried. Used up all the flour & egg, but still a lot of parmesan breadcrumbs left. Would cut it in half or less for 4 pork chops, so as not to waste so much cheese, sage, lemon zest. Fried potaoes were also delicioius with this coating by the way. Would be great for chicken also.

These are really good, but unless you use the really thick (1 inch) pork chops, there really isn't a need to "double cook" them.  They'll cook just fine in the frying pan, or laid on a slightly greased cookie sheet in the oven, for about 30 - 40 minutes.  I've made them both ways, depending on whatever else I'm cooking, and they work just fine.  The double cooking can lead to a very dry chop.

excellent recipe! I followed it faithfully except for the parmesan (I was fresh out) I added a little garlic powder to the flour as well. My husband said it was delish moist chops!

I followed the ingredients but I did add in a little cayenne pepper to the breadcrumbs. We like a little heat. I had thick chops with the bone in and didn't want them to dry out so I followed one commenter and baked at 375°. The chops were nice and moist! It was easy to make and my kids loved it. Definitely will be making again.

Very Tasty!  I followed the recipe exactly except I didn't have any lemon, and it still came out very good.  My kids loved it, so it is a keeper.

Little disappointed as it was lacking the parmesean flavor.  I also cooked on a lower temperature at 375 for 10-15 minutes and the pork was very tender.

Wow...this was good! I had 9 thin-sliced boneless chops. I doubled the flour mixture and the number of eggs, but there was plenty of the breadcrumb mixture (as written) to cover the chops. Also, because they were thin, I only popped them in the oven for about 5 minutes. The sage and zest really come thru in this recipe; you shouldn't omit them if you can help it. A definite keeper...will make this again and again. Thanks for sharing!

This was a very good recipe! I have made chicken and porkchops with a similar recipe before, but the lemon zest really tweeked it....very enjoyable. Followed the recipe exactly; chops were 1" thick and still partially frozen, but after 30 minutes in the oven, tested at exactly 160 degrees....thanks for the hint. Juicy and crust was delicioso! Was perfect for dinner for my husband and myself, served with mascarpone and fig pasta...very nice.

Followed the ingredient list exactly, and it was just enough to cover 3 thick boneless pork chops. I opted to cook it in a skillet for the whole cooking time, and they turned out fantastic. Into the recipe box it goes!

The chops were very moist and the crust was a perfect crunch.  My girls loved it, including my very picky "if it doesn't have cheese I'm not eating it" 8 year old!  We will be making this a regular dinner meal!!

Easy to make and it's very delicious. Seared them in a cast iron skillet and then popped that in the oven for 13 min.  Let it sit for 4 additional min.  It was perfect!

Love this recipe and so does my husband!  I followed the recipe except I didn't have sage but I did have poultry seasoning (sage is in it).  Olive oil isn't great to fry so I used vegetable oil and used about 2 tablespoons.  More like 3.  I will make again and again!

I thought this was easy and delicious, but my boyfriend did not like it because it tastes a little like chicken fried steak ( which he does not like) :( sadly I won't be making it again any time soon. But I liked it!

Came out great, tastes great...2 issues with the directions though:
1. The amount of ingredients in the parmesan/breadcrumb mixture were way too high, cut everything in half (or more) for 2 pork chops
2. The cook time is way off...it took 25 minutes for the internal temperature to reach 160 and the pork chops were not that thick

Made these on more than one occasion because they are so delicious & my family asked for more. The recipe is easy to follow & actually blended fresh lemon juice with the eggs because I've found that it makes them more flavorful. This is one of my (two) favorite go-to pork chop recipes.

Made this for the family today.  This is going into the regular family rotation. Even my picky son thought it was really good. Did not change a thing. Cooked it in the cast iron skillet and just popped it into the oven for about 10 minutes to develop that nice crust on the bottom. Excellent combination of flavors.

Fairly easy to make. Taste was absolutely delicious. Didn't have any rubbed sage, so I used a bit of thyme, and it still was delicious. I also slightly doubled the recipe for 4 pork chops. I did have a ton of left overs of the bread crumb mix as well as the flour in which I had to toss because of the contamination possibility if kept. Other than that, really delicious and the girlfriend loved it :)

Tasty. I baked this at a lower temperature after frying briefly like some others suggested. The meat was moist and tasty,but the breading was a little soggy. The next time we made this my husband fried them, but the flavor wasn't as good. Next time, I'll fry and then bake, but at a higher temp.

I didn't end up having sage or bread crumbs so I improvised and it turned out tasty. I switched to corn tortilla chips I pounded to bits. I used Savory and tarragon. I seasoned with  thyme, lemon & bay leaf sea salt.  I also just put all dry ingredient in one dish and dipped the chops in egg then dipped and covered in the dry ingredients. It was a tasty hit! :-)

This as a good base recipe. I used 2 small boneless chops about 3/4 inch thick. I cut the bread crumbs to 1/4 cup and still have a lot left over. I used lime zest instead of lemon because that's what I had on hand. It tasted great with the lime. I also added a teaspoon of garlic powder on the bread mixture and omitted the salt in the flour mixture. I felt the cooking time would dry out the pork chops. Instead of putting the chops in the oven I just cooked them in the pan for about 4-5 minutes on each side. I omitted the oven cooking altogether. They still turned out great. I served them with roasted garlic cauliflower.

Quick and delicious - I didn't have sage but I had poultry seasoning which has sage in it.  I didn't have lemon peel but squeezed lemon juice into the egg mixture.  If you refrain from making pork chops because they're usually dry and leathery, try these - super juicy and the topping stays put.  Served with garlic toast and peas - excellent!

This was delicious! I followed the recipe for the quantity of breeding mix, and then (before using) set aside half in a ziplock bag, which I saved to use later.

This is a pretty good meal. I tried it a couple of times now and it is really good and quick. My family loves it. I did what they asked as far as making it and it turned out great. Just take your time and I'm not one to come out of my comfort zone with cooking new things.

i only used about half the amount and that was enough not only for the pork chops but also for a large chicken breast.. next time i'll add more sage and lemon zest as i was expecting them to be more pronounced.. didn't need to bake in the oven.. just fried in the cast iron skillet.. the end result was tasty.. we both enjoyed the dish.. ty for the recipe

The recipe is good but the cooking time (especially for thick cut pork chops) must be adjusted.

This was a good recipe, but the cooking time definitely needs to be less as cooking chops to that degree will make them very dry.  The breading needed more flavor and punch, so next time I will dress it up a bit.

Yum! This was so tasty. I followed the advice of Kellinwood and reduced the bread crumb mixture by 2/3s, which turned out perfectly. I also skipped dredging with flour. It turned out fine.

Great recipe. I don't like cooking pork because it always seems the same. This was a nice twist. Used thicker pork chops so also dropped the oven temp and lengthened the cooking time. The crust keeps the chops moist. I cut the breading by 1/3 and still had more than enough for 3 chops. The lemon zest is a must since it really adds a nice tang. Fresh sage really punches up the flavor and freshness. Next time I make I'll probably deglaze the pan with white wine and make a quick butter lemon wine sauce since the crunchy outside and juicy inside really needed a sauce to pull it all together. Served with a fresh salad, rice pilaf, and riesling.

We really liked this. We did not use more than half of the bread mixture, but we put the extra in the fridge thinking it would taste good with other things like chicken.

Nice recipe! I had 3 boneless pork chops. I didn't have lemon peel so I added 1/2 tsp. lemon pepper to flour mixture. I also lowered oven temp to 375 and baked about 15 mins. Will make again there's  not very many pork chop recipes that have an end result this good.

Mmmmm! Very tender and flavorful! I used super thin pork cuts, but I still stuck them in the over for 5 minutes. I squirted the leftover lemon on them right of the oven, and ate them over some fresh greens. YUM!

Even though mine got way toooo brown, I am rating this 5 stars just because that was my fault not the recipe.  Just warning though, it does seem this happens very quickly if you do not keep an eye on it.  This is a crunchy, very good recipe and I have done it before using chicken with great success!  Thanks MissaLissa!  You have a winner.

It was delicious, BUT... I was looking for more flavors than just tough floured, fried chops. This recipe is scrumptious! I also did not need to triple all the ingredients when I tripled the recipe. BUT the clean-up is big. In a busy household where kids (boys) clean the kitchen, there were 3 dipping pans, the frying pan AND the baking dish. All washed by hand. I will think about that before I use this recipe again.

Good w/o the lemon zest I think. In the breaking gave it a weird "thing". Maybe lemon sauce would be ok.

Oh wow!!!  These were amazingly delicious!  It's one of the best pork chop recipes I've ever made, for sure.  I will definitely make much less of the breadcrumb mixture next time so that I won't have to throw away so much, but otherwise I made it exactly according to the recipe and it was divine!

Great recipe! The whole family ate everything on their plate. Juicy and flavorful. I did as another review said and baked until 140 degrees and then let it rest for about 10 minutes and they were perfect!

My family loved this recipe, although I did have to improvise, as I didn't have all the ingrediants on hand.  I substituted a 1/2 tsp. of Lemon-Pepper mix because I didn't have any lemons.  Also used Panko and Italian Seasoning, because I didn't have any bread crumbs.  My only complaint is that they went in the oven nice and crispy and came out greasy.  This may have been because I used bone-in chops, though.  I'll definitely make again, though I might try cooking them in the skillet instead of the oven.

This recipe is terrific.  I made it exactly according to the instructions, and my husband and I loved it.  Definite winner! (I don't ordinarily cook, but it's easy.)

This was so delicious! I served it over a lemon pepper pappardelle pasta (from Trader Joes) with zucchini, pesto and fresh Parmesan. Will definitely make again.

These were a hit, even though I had to make some substitutions and adjustments. I didn't have any breadcrumbs on hand, but crushed vegetable crackers made a fantastic replacement and instead of the very finely grated Parmesan you'd find in the pasta section of the grocery store, I used some that was pretty coarsely grated. I skipped the browning stage of the recipe because I didn't want them to be too greasy and I also spritzed them with some fresh lemon juice when they were fresh out of the oven. Very, very good!

Very good! I especially like the idea of using lemon zest. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys breaded pork chops.
