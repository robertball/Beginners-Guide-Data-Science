Made as written with only one small change after tasting. I felt this needed a little something so I added a couple shakes of Worcestershire and that did the trick. My biggest advice is to watch them closely in that final broiling step. At one minute they look like they are not browning at all but at two minutes they are slightly over as seen in my picture. Also be sure to use a slotted spoon while assembling your sliders or you will end up with soggy bread. These were fast, easy, and fun and would make a great snack for a tailgating party.

These were really good. I didn't use sweet buns instead we had dinner rolls. I had bought some onions with red and green peppers frozen for fajita's, so I used that. Turned out perfect with half the prep!! Enjoy!

We LOVED these! Keep an eye on them in under the broiler, tho, as they will burn quickly.  These could use a little condiment like mayo or Italian dressing or something, but that's an easy fix. A keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I followed the recipe exactly, and I will make this again with two adjustments.  First, keeping all the meat and veggies on little slider buns is difficult, so I will probably  use full size hoagie buns in the future. Second, I won't use Italian seasoning the next time I make this. I will just use salt and pepper to taste.

These sliders are delicious! I used sliced fresh mushrooms  instead of canned, added after the steak strips. The sweet buns were nice to balance the flavors of the peppers. We will make this recipe again!

Pretty good sandwich!!. Went light on the Italian seasoning and added Southwest chipotle sauce.

Made it as directed and thought it was good but missing something. Next time will add worcestershire sauce like in some other reviews.
