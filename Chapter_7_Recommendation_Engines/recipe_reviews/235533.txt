The sweetness of the apples intensifies as the apple slices bake, and although a cinnamon-sugar mixture is traditional on apple chips, I think the sea salt provides a fabulous contrast to the sweetness.  I baked these for four hours at 170 degrees F, and they weren't even close to being done, so I bumped up the temperature to 225 for the fifth and final hour.  These apple chips are divine, but in the future, I will try cooking them at 225, five hours is just too long.
