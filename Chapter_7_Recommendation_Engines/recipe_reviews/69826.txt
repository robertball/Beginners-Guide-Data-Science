This is delicious. Just as moist and rich as the original chocolate version. I did make one modification, I used two sticks of butter rather than part butter part oil. If you have never made a Texas Sheet cake, do not be scared by the consistency of the batter, it WILL bake up correctly. Be sure and use the 10x15 pan, it's supposed to be flat. I didn't have the ingredients for the icing in this recipe so I used this one. Bring 1 stick butter, 1/2 cup peanut butter, and 6 tb milk to a boil in a large saucepan. Add 1 tsp  vanilla. Mix in 1 box (3 3/4 cups) powdered sugar. Mix well, beating with handheld electric mixer for smoothest consistency. Frost cake while frosting is hot and cake is warm. Finally, I drizzled lines of warmed hot fudge topping over the icing. Once the hot fudge cools it firms up so don't substitute with chocolate syrup. For me, the chocolate adds a lot somehow.

Really good! I made this for work and it was well received. I made it as written except that I doubled the icing. Because so many reviewers commented that the peanut butter flavor was somewhat subtle, a couple even saying the cake was bland, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't be peanut buttery enough for my taste, but it was. I did add just a sprinkle of salt to the icing to draw out the flavor a bit, as I used unsalted butter. I will definitely make this again as a simple way to satisfy a PB cake craving!

This cake is wonderful!!! Rich and moist and flavorful! I used two sticks of margarine instead of butter and oil and baked it in a 9x12 pan - came out LOVELY!
Great with fudge frosting!

Since peanut butter cakes can be dry, I was encouraged to see that this recipe apparently took that into consideration by including a little oil. But it disappoints.  The cake is a little on the oily side, has a dense crumb and doesn't pack the peanut butter flavor I hoped for. The frosting recipe didn't appeal to me, so I made my own peanut butter buttercream frosting.  The cake might be improved by reducing the amount of oil a little and replacing it with the same amount of peanut butter, and by using brown sugar rather than white. I'll still keep looking for the school cafeteria peanut butter sheet cake I remember from my school days.

PB sheet cake makes it to nearly every family function on my hubby's side. I am pregnant with a craving and there's no family event in sight. So, I made my first ever pb sheet cake. The frosting is amazing. It makes the cake. Upon first bite, I was slightly disappointed as the cake does seem a bit bland (though o-so-moist!). My tastebuds caught up and the frosting took over. I think if the cake were any sweeter or any more peanut buttery, I'd be in a peanut butter coma. Both textures of cake and frosting are perfect. I did use all butter instead of butter and oil, and I doubled the icing. Everything else was the same. Great stuff! ETA: It's even better the next day!

This cake is pure heaven for the die hard peanut butter lover and is "oh, so good" served with a tall glass of milk.  I've been making this cake for a long time and I have to admit that I've never been able to get consistent results.  My biggest problem is with it falling in the center.  The other inconsistency I have is that the texture can be oily (sometimes more than others).  What I've learned is this:  1)  You can't over bake it.  It's a moist, moist cake!  2) Regardless of how it turns out, peanut butter lovers LOVE it!  I've never had to toss one out because people refused to eat it.

Turned out GREAT (used a buttercream frosting that I added peanut butter to)- good peanut butter flavor.  I was afraid it would be oily like previous reviewers but it wasn't.  I did add about a 1/4 c. more peanut butter and cut oil to 1/8 c.

This is a great cake.  If you love peanut butter this one is perfect.  I made it for work and it was gone by lunch and I made another one the same night because it is an easy cake.

Everyone has to try this cake. This is one of the best cake receipes I have ever made.  I agree that the peanut butter is not overwhelming.  I didn't have marshmallows in my cupboard but I did have marshmallow cream and used it instead.  Wonderful result.  The cake has the taste of mild peanut butter fudge but better.

A bit oily, but this can be fixed by subbing apple sauce for oil.  UPDATE - Have repeated by using only 1 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of apple sauce, and 3/4 cup peanut butter when boiling the original mixture.  Much more successful this way.

I haven't made the cake yet, but I made the frosting to top the "Chewy Peanut Butter Brownies" from this website. I also used 1/3 c. marshmallow fluff instead of minis. It was delicious. I can't wait to make the cake as well.

Great recipe!  Perfect for a peanut butter lover.  I would recommend using chunky peanut butter in the glaze and putting that on while the cake is still warm to enable easier spreading.

I tried this recipe and brought it to a party.  Very moist. It was a hit!!  I doubled the recipe to make a bigger sheet cake. That cake was devoured within an hour. I didn't use frosting recipe. I use a stick of butter, 1 cp PB, 1 block of cream cheese, 1/4cp of milk and 1/4cp flour. Blend until smooth. Everyone loved it.  Even the picky eaters enjoyed it.

We love this cake.  I doubled the icing, however. In place of mini-marshmallows I used 5 large ones (10 if you double it). Great!

Very good recipe and very easy to make.  We love regular texas sheet cake and this was just as good.  It was very moist and a lite but perfect peanut butter taste.  I will make this again.

I was excited when I came across this recipe.  I have made the buttermilk sheet cake for so long that I have the recipe memorized.  I made the cake for work and it turned out great.  My issue is with the frosting.  I made it the first time and it seized up and I could not spread it.  I thought maybe I miss measured so I made it again with the same result.  I used the second batch and crumbled it on the cake, it tasted delicious, just looked like a hot mess.  I would appreciate any assistance.

okay..i needed dessert for a huge crowd and wanted to go with ingredients i had on hand. i also had a carton of buttermilk from a previous recipe so this one was a lay up. i took some suggestions from many of the reviews and this is what i came up with.
First off: i doubled the recipe
2. I split the sugars between white and brown
3. increased the peanut butter by 1/3 cup and used about 2 tablespoons of oil instead of the 1/4 cup.
i also added spices to the dry mix. cinnamon, ground cloves, ground nutmeg. just a dash of each. I took into account several posters saying the cake was oily and heavy so i used large industrial size pans making it a rather flat sheet cake. 
Results?
Absolutely Perfect! Texture is similar to a light banana bread but not greasy or oily. The taste is lightly spicy with a gentle hint of peanut butter. I used chunky peanut butter as well.   Instead of the frosting i chose to just dust lightly with conf. sugar.
I will use this for large crowds again. Very happy with the results and the suggestions other's have posted.

It is different than normal cake. It's denser and more oily. It does have good flavor though. I did not use the frosting that was suggested as I'm not a fan of marshmallow. I used a simple light peanut buttercream.

The cake part of this dessert absolutely deserved 5 stars, it's delicious!  We did use slightly more peanut butter in the batter and added some mini chocolate chips in.  With the warmth of the batter, the chips melted right in and added a great flavor!  I gave the recipe 4 stars though because we did not like the flavor of the icing at all.  It didn't add much to the cake at all.  I will say though that if you do decide to use this icing recipe, you will definitely need to double it since I couldn't get it to cover the whole thing.  I will also say that you should wait until the cake is almost finished to start the icing.  I had to put it back on the warm stove to keep it melted enough to put on the cake.

Reminded me of Reese Pieces candy on the first bite. It is a tasty dessert and large enough to feed a crowd. (If you're not cooking for a crowd you should consider freezing portions of it so you can take out just enough at a time to curb your peanut butter craving.) The baking time for me was about 30-35 minutes, although I used a stone sheet so it could have been a factor. Other than that, the recipe resulted in a perfectly prepared cake so thank you.

I made this sheet cake for a family gathering.  After reading the reviews, I made the following changes.  Made the cake as directed, doubled the frosting.  Then I made a small amount of chocolate glaze and spooned it into a clean ketchup plastic bottle (the kind you take on picnics).  I then drizzled the chocolate over the top in a basket  weave pattern.  (Not hard at all).  I then sprinkled some chopped peanuts over that.  The nuts adhere to the icing and chocolate glaze.  This not only made it "pretty" but gave it more "peanut" taste.  I will admit there was not a crumb left when I went to take my pan home.  I plan on making it again for my grand-daughters graduation this coming June.

Cake was awesome.FROSTING WAS NOT.  I made it exactly as recipe stated.  I even double checked the recipe to make sure I hadn'ot forgotten anything.  Mine turned out impossible to spread without tearing up cake and there was no way near enough to cover the cale.  I will try the cake again but with a different frosting or icing.  It is moist and has a good flavor.

So yummy! I usually use this as a middle layer between chocolate or yellow sheet cake when making large birthday cakes! I fill the middle with a mixture of marshmallow cream and frosting! I have gotten rave reviews for both flavors! When I made a smaller sheet cake, I used the left over batter to make cupcakes! So tasty! Thanks!

Followed the recipe exactly & it turned out great.  Very moist and delicious.  The only thing I'll do differently next time is to double the frosting as my cookie sheet is a little larger than 10 x 15 and I had to spread it very thin.

This is an absolutely wonderful cake. I followed the directions, with the exception of a few things.  Because I only had generic brand peanut butter, I used more than the directions recommended, and used about a 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract in the cake and the frosting. I also cooked some pecans, into the frosting, because I did not have chunky peanut butter. Oh, and I used a portion of butter to replace the oil, because of what previous ratings recommended.  I made the cake for my mother, because she loves peanut butter. She loves the cake!   If you are looking to bring out the peanut butter flavor more, please consider using a little almond oil.  Enjoy!!

Wow this was great! I'm not a big cake person and I had 2 pieces.. I didn't have buttermilk so I made my own with skim milk and vinegar and also I didn't have any evaporated milk so I just used skim. Still turned out so good and so moist! yummy!

excellent recipe.  very sweet and rich.  but if you are making a peanut butter cake, you are probably wanting this result.  i used coconut oil instead of vegetable as it makes all baked items super moist.  i didn't have evaporated milk, so i used whole.  worked fine.  and i baked for 25 minutes in a 9X12.  this was hubby's birthday cake and he LOVED it.    this will definitely become my standard peanut butter cake recipe.   a must for any peanut butter lover!

I thought this was very good.  After reading several reviews I did make a couple slight alterations.  1) Used 1 C white sugar and 1 C brown sugar (instead of all white in recipe)  2) Omitted the vegetable oil the recipe called for and increased Peanut butter to 3/4 C, and 3) I doubled the icing recipe. At first I thought doubling the frosting was going to be way too much, but it was the perfect amount for a 10 x 15 pan.  I probably would have been angry if I used the icing recipe as written.  Last, I waited until the cake was done before I started making the frosting, because I didn't want it to set up before the cake was done.  Cake was still plenty warm when the frosting was ready to pour.

Absolutely delicious! I made it gluten free too! (It's not a fad for me, I actually cannot digest it.) Everyone loved it-no one had any idea it was gf.  I used part almond meal, part oat flour and quinoa flours- I did use a 1/2 cup of Pamela's baking mix in addition to the flour  called for to ensure a good rise. I did use the previous bakers' recommendation to use applesauce in place of some of the oil and upping the peanut butter. I'm glad I did! So moist! Will make again for sure!!!

This cake is delicious!  My family loves it with chocolate frosting; I use the chocolate frosting from the Texas Sheet Cake Recipe (minus the nuts).  The cake reminds me of a Reese's Peanut Butter Cup.  A favorite in my house.

OMG, this is AWESOME!! I just made this and if you love peanut butter this is the cake for you.  The only change I made was two sticks of butter and no oil and doubled the frosting recipe as others have stated. This is definitely going in my favorite recipes.

We made this for a fundraiser dinner at our school.  Our plan was to make four cakes.  We had two high school girls helping us make it for a home economics class.  On the first try, one cake turned out and the other did not rise at all.  We thought it may have been "cook error" since the girls were helping us.  So the next batch, we carefully checked and measured the ingredients ourselves and still, they cake did not rise.  It came out flat and funny tasting.  We have scratched our heads at this as to why one cake would turn out and the others not turn out.

I didn't have a 10x15 pan, so I used a standard 9x13 cake pan.  I wish someone had said the batter would be very liquidity compared to cake mixes from a box.  I thought it wasn't gonna turn out so I added more flour, sugar & PB - my cake turned out quite high but a good taste.  I strongly suggest using the right 10x15 pan for this recipe.

This cake was plenty moist, and if you're looking for something with mild flavor this will suit. I should have given more weight to the comments about the lack of peanut better taste in this cake. As another reviewer mentioned, I'm also looking for a peanut butter sheet cake recipe like our school cooks used to make, so good it didn't need icing.

I thought this was an ok recipe.  It did not have enough peanut butter taste.  I don't think I would make it again.  If I did I would put a different frosting on it.  Not bad not great.  Just not excellent.

I have made peanut butter sheet cake for years--use chunky peanut butter in both cake & frosting.  Had a birthday party over weekend for around 50 people--had made the pnut butter sheet cake & had 2 other cakes made--guess what went first--peanut butter cake.  Wonderful.

The cake was easy to make and very moist.  However, it was also very bland.  I would use the cake recipe but finish it like a tandy cake recipe using a peanut butter layer followed by a chocolate frosting.

I have not yet actually eaten the cake but wanted to make a review based on Chellebelle's suggestion as I made the icing recipe she provided and not the one as provided with the recipe. I followed the cake recipe exactly and although I had to let it bake a bit longer than the recipe indicated, it turned out perfectly. While it was baking, I made chellebelle's icing (using crunchie peanut butter) and while cake was still hot I covered the cake. It had cooled slightly but spread beautifully on the hot cake.  I then made a hot fudge sauce (1-14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk combined with 1 cup choc chips melted in a sauce pan over medium heat until smooth then add 2 tbsp butter = Yummy hot fudge sauce!) Then poured some of the sauce into a zip lock plastic bag, cut a very very tiny hole on the end and drizzled the hot fudge over the cake.  Super easy and looked great! Put the rest of the hot fudge sauce in a container in the fridge to be warmed again later over ice cream. 
I tasted the icing and it is delicious!! Will review the cake later.

Made the frosting from the recipe to put on a regular (chocolate) Texas sheet cake, for a chocolate-peanut butter combo.  It really does taste like peanut butter fudge, but if you want a more traditional, soft and fluffy frosting, don't go with this one, it's dense and almost chewy.  Also, I agree with other reviewers that there wasn't enough to cover the cake, and I used a 9x13 pan.  I think increasing the recipe by 50% would have worked better.

This stuff is to die for!! Seriously so addicting! I had it twice, then made it myself for two different occasions and have already handed off the recipe a couple times! Great for big get-togethers. Obviously not on the lighter side, but you can't change this recipe, leave as is and you wont be dissapointed. I made mine in a regular cookie sheet (not jelly roll) and it turned out fabulous!

I put my own spin on it as was fixing for diabetic.  I omitted oil and used 1 cup natural peanut butter which is already pretty oily.  I also increased the baking soda to 1 teas.  I only used 1 cup of sugar and replaced the other cup with one cup of stevia. Did not make the frosting that is included in this recipe. I am sure original recipe is better but this turned out moist.

I followed the recipe as written.  The cake itself was moist and yummy.  The frosting was ok, but not really to my liking.  It was way to sweet and had a funky texture.  I made this for easter and just about everyone was scrapping the frosting off after the first few bites.  I will make this cake again but will use a different frosting.

I love this recipe!  It never lasts for very long that is for sure!!  I didn't use the icing ( i just used peanut butter, powdered sugar, with a little bit of milk) but the cake itself was VERY good!  I will be making this again and again and again.  Thanks so much!

Very yummy!  I used a cup of coffee, in place of the water (I had some left in my coffee pot), and I added 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder to the flour mixture.  I also chopped up some mini peanut butter cups, and sprinkled on top before the frosting set.  I love this version of sheet cake, and will make it again in the near future:)

Great recipe.  It was a big hit at my work!  I followed the suggestion to use all butter (not butter and oil) and also topped with some leftover choco frosting I had.  A definite winner!

Great cake!  I frosted it with a chocolate cream cheese icing I had left over from my bf's Banana Chocolate Truffle B'day cake.    The cake was great with the chocolate cream cheese icing.  The cake itself was moist and had the perfect peanut butter flavour.

You know, I just don't get it---all of these five stars, and I just wasn't crazy about this. Firstly, the flavor was just really not that exciting (and I am a huge PB lover). It was just a little bland to me. Then, I baked the cake as directed, took it out when the toothpick came out clean, tried to spread the frosting on top and the top of the cake just peeled right back; the frosting was totally unspreadable. The cake looks a mess. I tried to salvage it by tossing some chocolate chips on it to bring a little flavor. It's better, but just not great. Sorry!

Wow! I just finished a piece of heaven! I made some modifications that worked well. I used cake flour(Don't forget to add about an eighth of a cup extra)instead of all purpose. I also added about a half cup of mixed white, butterscotch,and semisweet chips in the saucepan with the peanut butter. It didn't need frosting. I served it with a dollop of real whipped cream.

This cake was dense, moist, and had the right amount of peanut butter flavor.  I made it in 3 9" round cake pans to make a birthday cake.  I sealed the cake with vanilla buttercream icing, and when that was dry I piped on chocolate whipped cream frosting.  Everyone loved it!  (To make the chocolate whipped cream; 1 cup heavy cream, 1.5 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa, 2 tablespoons sugar.  Put all ingredients in a bowl, mix the ingredients together with a fork, then put in the freezer for a half hour, take out and whip until stiff peaks form.

Oh, my!  This is SO good!  My 8-year-old daughter made this herself and won a third-place ribbon in a Girl Scout bake-off.  The first and second place winners were both chocolate cakes.  People could not quit raving about how moist this cake is. We used 2% milk instead of buttermilk and baked in two round cake pans.  We also used a slightly different variation on the icing - similar ingredients only you boil for a finished product that tastes just like peanut butter fudge!  If you can, make this a day or two in advance.  It's one cake that truly tastes better the longer it sits!  Now back to the kitchen for that last piece...

Oh boy was this good...I had to use chocolate frosting because I ran out of peanut butter!  Still very good.

I thought this was okay, but my husband wouldn't shut-up about it so I had to give it five stars.  Very moist and a very mild flavor.  I would like to try this with different frostings, too.  Very easy to make.  Obviously I'm making this again since this is my hubby's new favorite cake:)

I made this a layer cake. I used heart shaped pans, and it turned out great! Followed recipe exactly except used cake flour. Frosted with Rich chocolate frosting from this site. May add just a tad more peanut butter next time. Really great recipe.

This cake is extraordinary!  I doubled the icing and took it to a work party - it was gone in a ridiculously short amount of time, and people are still asking when I'm going to bring it in again.  **The icing hardens pretty fast, so it spreads neatest for me if I put it on the hot cake while the icing itself is hot.

This was very good.  I was a little a scared because the batter is very runny but it worked.  I wanted to use other cake pans but with the consistancy of the batter I think that the pan the recipe calls for would work the best.  I also frosted it with chocolate fudge frosting and it was great.  Next time I want to make it with strawberry filling and wipped frosting to maybe mock the peanut butter and jelly sandwich! Thanks for the recipe.

I did not make the cake but did use the frosting on some banana oatmeal cake cookies that I just made.  The frosting is just delicious!  It was the perfect taste/texture to accompany these cookies.  Yummy!  Now I have to try the cake itself, because if the frosting is this good, the cake must be, too!  Thanks for sharing.

This sheet cake tasted great.  I used the recipe for fluffy peanut butter frosting off of this site instead though.  I didn't have all the ingredients for the icing in this recipe, but it sounds good too.

A peanut butter lovers delight.  With all the suger and marshmallow I thought it would be to sweet, it's not.  I did exchange regular milk for the evaporated in the frosting.  Didn't know what I would do with a partially opened can. Next time I will drizzle with chocolate fudge.

I made this cake for family, then took the rest to work. Everyone raved about it. I used crunchy, honey-roasted peanut butter in the cake batter, and regular peanut butter for the icing. Yes, the flavor is delicate, not like a stick-to-the-roof-of-your-mouth peanut butter sandwich. It is very moist. I will definitely make this cake again!

Since I love the taste of chocolate and peanut butter I decided to make my traditional Texas sheet cake minus the cinnamon but use this icing~delecious!
I used marshmellow fluff...1/3 cup...instead of mini marshmellows and plain peanut butter.  Much better combo then the sickening sweet icing I usually use.  Thanks~I may try the cake recipe the next time.

I changed this recipe a bit - thought it had too much sugar and with the butter and peanut butter in it, I omitted the oil.  I used only 1/2 cup butter in the frosting.  My kids loved it!  It is a nice relief from chocolate.

The cake and frosting were a nice consistency, and it looked great, but the flavor was too bland for us.  I'll use the frosting/glaze recipe again, on a chocolate cake or brownies.

I have made this cake a few times. Sometimes i sub a quarter cup of brown sugar for white and i always lessen the amount of oil, i find it only needs aboout a cap and a half or 2 tbls at most and a lil more peanut butter instead! Also i use chunky for the cake and frosting. ??

This cake puffed up very nicely and is very fluffy, not dry at all but I think it needs to be a tad sweeter. I added just a dash of salt to the topping...just enough to enhance the flavor. I sprayed a sheet of parchment paper with flour-enhanced baking spray and laid that in the bottom of the pan instead of buttering the pan. The recipe is much easier than it reads...just be sure to stir the butter and water mix as directed when boiling otherwise it will scorch. I made this especially for my brother and he really loves it!

It was great although very rich. It wasn’t too dry but I would recommend a glass of milk with it. My husband is a peanut butter lover and went back for seconds. (Although it was so rich it gave him a tummy ache)

Who doesn't love peanut butter? 
Very moist.  I used 1 1/2 times the ingredients and it was enough to fill a 12 1/2" x 17 1/2" sheet cake pan (for the potluck) and a 9" square pan (for my daughter).
If I made it again I would use creamy peanut butter in the frosting.

Loved it! Wife loved it too. No marshmallows, so after a bit of research used plain old gelatin powder. Needed to wait a bit as frosting was pretty solid well before the cake was finished in the oven, but a great success

Per reviewers' suggestions, I reduced the oil to 1/8 cup and used heaping amounts of peanut butter in the cake and frosting. Also added a dash of salt to the frosting as suggested to bring out the peanut butter flavor. The cake turned out very moist and not too oily.

Although my cake didn't look like it did in the photos, it fell flat and became thin. Nonetheless, it did taste well with the coarsely chopped peanuts I did by hand (and not by blender). I have plenty for leftovers during this holiday weekend. I would love to make this again and hopefully it would rise to the occasion.

I made the recipe. I used several of the reviewers tips. I didn't add any oil. Instead I used 1 cup of unsalted butter (2 sticks softened) and added an extra 1/4 cup of peanut butter (chunky). Made it in a 9 x 13 pan.  Didn't have everything for the frosting, so I made cream cheese frosting with another 1/4 cup of chunky peanut butter. Turned out great.  Every piece was gone the same day. Will make again.

I made the peanut butter sheet cake just as instructed, it turned out fabulous, it was eaten quickly by teenage boys in my house.
I also made another one leaving the peanut butter out of the cake mixture and adding 4 heaping tablespoons of cocoa powder, cake turned out yummy with the peanut butter frosting, I would double the frosting mixture for the chocolate cake version.

Very moist, baked up beautifully! Per other reviews, I used 1/2 white & 1/2 brown sugar, & subbed unsweetened applesauce for the oil.
The pb frosting didn’t tickle my fancy, so I made the frosting from my chocolate Texas Sheet Cake recipe. To. Die. For!!!

It was moist and delicious. I didn't have chunky peanut butter so I used creamy.  It was a great hit at potluck.

This was absolutely delicious! Super moist, tasty and rich peanut butter taste. I made it exactly as the recipe directed. I used a jelly roll pan as stated and lined it with parchment and sprayed with cooking spray.  I will make this again.  I had a cooking uh-oh after making my frosting.  I thought I'd measured out 1/3 cup of evaporated milk but I must have measured a little shy of that amount.  My frosting wasn't near the consistency of the video (which was very helpful, if I hadn't watched that I would not have realized.  So I added just a tad, seriously, probably a teaspoon or two and all of a sudden it flowed just like the video.  Not only did it turn out yummy, but It turned out beautiful as well.  Thank you for the great recipe.

Easy and delicious. I can't do dairy so switched out the butter for coconut oil and the buttermilk for almond milk (which requires switching the baking soda for powder to balance out the PH)

I made it exactly as the recipe called for. I was in charge of dessert for my grandson’s football team so I made three Texas sheet cakes for 55 hearty appetites. One was white, one was chocolate, and the third was this recipe. It got rave reviews and I  will definitely be making it again.

I had to substitute the sugar in the cake with Splenda due to the dietary needs of a family member.  I also left 1/4 of the cake without icing so that it could be enjoyed by that person.  The cake is absolutely delicious!  I will be making this one again and again!

I made the cake as written, although I used a "heaping" measure of peanut butter. Very moist and tender cake!  I didn't want to buy the marshmallows for such a small amount, so I used a different boiled icing with peanut butter and powdered sugar, and sprinkled the top with chopped peanuts. The cake was a hit at my event and I will definitely make this again.

I make this at least twice a year.  I follow the recipe  completely other than baking it in a 14.5 × 11 pan. It is amazing. It also never lasts more than a day in the house.

First off, this is a SHEET cake, meant to be baked on a SHEET,  not a cake pan.  A jellyroll pan is called for, like what you use for Tollhouse pan cookies,  but  a 9x13 pan will work.  (I don't think many people have jellyroll pans anymore.)  Your pan will have an effect on your texture.
That said, I used my rectangular, stainless steel 9x13 cake pan.  The batter is very runny, but that bodes well for a moist cake.  I used melted butter instead of oil, but as far as the cake goes, that is the only change I made.  The cake was moist, dense and flavorful, easy to serve from the pan, which is what you expect from a sheet cake.
Four stars, because the frosting struck me as tooth achingly sweet, so I  frosted my cake with the standard chocolate frosting from the back of the Herehey's cocoa tin.  My family loved this cake.  Advice:  Use the proper pan, and for those complaining about the lack of peanut butter taste,  use a good peanut butter.  or trusted generic  brand.

I loved  it but made some changes. I had never thought of making a peanut butter cake before.  The only problem was the buttermilk and butter (lactose intolerance) So I used oil and lactose free milk.  Made the peanut butter from scratch in the food processor first, and didn't make the topping.   It definitely turned out 5 stars for this family.

Easy and delicious. I used 1 cup of oil instead of the butter/oil combo cuz I couldn't be bothered with all the heating and melting.
This is a dense, rich cake with hella peanut butter flavour. Exactly what I was hoping for.

I've made this several times for church events and all I have to say as I walk in the door is peanut butter cake and the line forms behind me. I don't do anything different, I make it as written. 
Fyi, for those that say it doesn't bake up right or it falls in the middle.... It's a sheet cake, it's supposed to be thin and not baked in a 9x13.

Very good, as is. It was more to our tastes, however, with a few minor modifications the second time. Since as is, the peanut butter flavor is quite subtle, I added 1/4 cup peanut butter, and cut back to only 2 TB oil. Texture was less dense this way, but it didn't increase the punch of peanut butter flavor I had hoped, hence the 4 stars. It was light and delightfully moist. The peanut butter fudge-like glaze was scrumptious, but makes cutting pieces neatly all but impossible. It goes together fairly easily, and should please most everyone. A good, solid formula for pleasingly homey comfort food.

I made this recipe for our crowd at work.  To say they loved it is an understatement.  I got so much praise and there wasn't a bite left.  I followed the recipe exactly as written.  I would use a larger sheet pan as the 10 x 15 didn't leave room for the frosting.  I inverted it onto a tray and carefully frosted it.

Excellent moist dense cake..it's annoying when reviewers change a recipe totally and tell every minute detail they did so why not just post it as a new recipe..I don't see how they can rate a recipe they have totally changed..for those that didn't use the icing recipe that came with this cake recipe buy instead used a buttercream pb icing. .u don't know what u were missing. .this icing was like  pb fudge..awesome. .the only change would be to double it..those that said this cake was bland makes me wonder if they can cook at all..excellent flavor..some say pic cakes often too dry then turn around and say this one too oily??? Perfectly moist and not oily at all..I hardly think 1/4 cup of oil I'd gonna be too much..lol   awesome recipe

I love Texas sheet cake. I took one look at the picture & said "YES! I want this for my birthday!" I sent the recipe to my mom who made it & when I saw it - it was not the cake in the picture. The recipe calls for crunchy pb & the picture is very smooth. The pic is also thick with frosting but the reality was not. The flavor of the cake was oily & light on PB flavor while the frosting was okay (it would be better as a buttercream & not a melted marshmallow). People ate & liked it but was expecting something much better

Delicious!  I love that it makes a 10 x 15 pan.  I made it for a soup kitchen and people kept asking for the peanut butter cake.  It was easy to make, the texture was very good, and the taste was wonderful.  I will be using this recipe often when I need to take a dessert somewhere,

**Updating previous rating** Brought to the office today. It's a hit! Good PB flavor but not overwhelming. Very moist. I doubled the frosting & would recommend you do the same. Frosting is very sticky & gooey....almost caramel-like consistency. Super yummy!

I tried it the first time my kids liked it,but it was not well cooked so instead of 26 min. cooking time I cooked it 40 min. I have to say this was the best cake every. I had several friends to place orders.

This was a very tasty, moist cake. I didn't have chunky peanut butter, so I used creamy, and it was very good!

This was wonderful! I substituted whole wheat flour for half the flour of the cake and left the marshmallows out of the icing and it worked great. I took it to a potluck and the whole cake was gone in a matter of minutes. It will be a staple recipe for me.

I made it with a chocolate icing because I didn't have the ingredients called for to make the peanut butter icing.  It was wonderful and I had people asking me for the recipe.  I will definitely be making this again!

This was a big hit.  I baked the cake in a 9X13 pan and frosted it with canned chocolate fudge frosting.  Everyone loved it!
