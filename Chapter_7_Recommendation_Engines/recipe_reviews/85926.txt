Great stuff. I have made this before. One alternative is to use a little more cheese. Add 1/2 cup of freshly graded Romano to the mozzarella, as well as a 1/2 cup of sharp cheddar . I also add ricotta or cottage cheese to the pasta and sauce mixture before I top the pasta bake with the 3 cheese combo. I also omitted the veggies and added Italian sausage along with the pepperoni.  Best baked in a glass pan. Note that this can be pre-made and stored for up to 24 hours covered with plastic wrap in the fridge.  That's you can come home from work and slap it in the oven and relax. Or you can do the prep earlier in the day when you have more energy and all you have to do before the Spouse gets home is the baking part. Serve with a fresh green or garden salad. Yum!!

I prepared this with 1 pound of Italian sausage, and skipped the veggies and Canadian bacon.  Fantastic!  It has a really rich pizza taste.  I did use a casserole dish, though, and I think I will use a 9"x13" pan next time.

I used Rotini instead of macaroni and omitted the canadian bacon. I also sauteed the mushrooms a bit with the onion and sausage. Really, any of your favorite pizza toppings would be great in this. I'd like to try ham and pineapple with a white sauce next time. Kids loved this - tasted just like pizza.

Great recipe! I made it with ground beef, pepperoni, and turkey sausage. My husband won't touch mushrooms or olives, so I omitted those and added chopped spinach to the skillet w/ the meat and onions.  I also didn't have enough mozzarella, so I added some grated provolone, asiago, and a little bit of sharp cheddar.  Turned out just right. :)

My family loved it. I changed it just a little. I used rotini pasta instead of ellbows. I used grd beef instead of sausage. I used spag. sauce instead of tomato (what i had on hand). Left out the milk and bacon. I also used a kraft 4 cheese pizza blend instead of mozz. It was wonderful. Anyway you make it its fantastic.

This was good, my husband really liked it.  I added 1 lb. of sausage, wish I would've added more pepperoni.  Probably because I didn't add the olives, mushrooms or canadian bacon.  I doubled the amount of cheese but mixed most of it in then topped with the remaining the last 10 minutes of baking.  Good recipe to tweek to your personal "pizza topping" liking.

This was just ok for us. Very quick and easy to prepare, but my husband did not care too much about it. Probably will not make again.

This went over very well with my family! I omitted the pepperoni and olives. I increased the amount of mushrooms and used whole wheat pasta for half the pasta. VERY GOOD!! =)

My family enjoyed this on a cool weekday evening.  I used low carb pasta, sweet italian sausage and made my own pizza sauce using a 28oz can of tomato sauce with lots of spices.  I don't usually make casserole things like this to often and enjoy making somewhat gourmet food and this was a simple but good meal made lower carb.

I added italian seasoning, worchestershire sauce and a couple cans of diced tomatoes, cut out the milk, and
upped the olives. I also added shredded carrot when I sauteed the garlic and onion together. Everyone inhaled it, even the baby. There were no leftovers.

I will make this again.  I liked the C. bacon in the recipe so I would leave it in. The only thing I did different was I used 2 cups mozz cheese instead of 1.

Great recipe! The only thing I did different was...I used 1 lb of sausage and skipped the bacon and I used more cheese on top. Will definitely make again...even my 18 month old ate it and he won't eat anything!

Tasty and fairly easy, but saltier than necessary (prepared pizza sauce, tomato sauce, sausage, pepperoni, bacon).  Next time I'll use no added salt tomato sauce (or no added salt canned diced tomatoes) and just add additional seasonings for flavour - oregano, basil, black pepper.  My picky 2 year old did like it, so we will try it again with minor changes.

I made this recipes with out veggies only because I don't care for them. For the onion flavor I used 1 tsp onion powder. I thought this was just ok, not a wow repeat recipe.

This was very good.  I doubled the recipe and it came out just fine.  We omitted the mushrooms because they aren't a family favorite and I added parmesan cheese to the sauce.  Next time I'll add more meat, but that is a personal preference.

This is easy to modify "toppings" to whatever you normally like on your pizza. I even snuck in mushrooms without my daughter realizing it.

So I skipped the olives and mushrooms but it just didn't seem to do it. It also seemed like the sauce quickly got absorbed and wish it had more sauce. Maybe I forgot to cover it in the oven which dried it out!

I made it as a special dish for a family dinner.  It was a new twist on baked macaroni, and was very tasty.  It was also very easy to make.  The leftovers were a good lunch too.   I would make this again.

Awesome! Did double the cheese (used 2 cups) and used half pizza sauce and half spaghetti sauce since that's what I had. Also, didn't have Canadian bacon, olives or mushrooms, but I'm sure that would have made it even better!

I had to make it without meat for a potluck, so just used pre-chopped peppers/onions from the supermarket and some mushrooms I had on hand.  Came out well, people seemed to like it, but I'm sure it would be even better with the meat!

Didn't have pizza sauce so used spaghetti sauce. Since it's the middle of summer, I cooked in microwave till cheese melted. Very, very tasty! My family loved it.

Pizza Pasta Bake Haiku: "We weren't too thrilled. This didn't go over well. Tossed the leftovers." Dropped the black olives and Canadian bacon (enough meat w/ the sausage and pepperoni for us) but kept everything else the same. Not really sure what the point of the milk addition was, but we thought it was way too saucy, and agreed that all of the ingredients would've been better on a pizza crust rather than all higgly-piggly in a casserole dish w/ the elbow noodles.

This is definitely going into the rotation at our house! The only thing is, next time I will use homemade sauce. It was a little bland.
