Mine didn't necessary turn out creamy but they turned out excellent. My potatoes were quite large and could have used more buttermilk but I struggle with mashed potatoes in general and was afraid of them turning gluey so I didn't add any more. I think a weight for the potatoes would be good seeing how potatoes vary in size. Unfortunately I did not weight mine so I can not help there. Although mine came out looking somewhat dry, they were not and they were loaded with flavor. The dill really sets these apart from all others and they most definitely did not need gravy. Excellent recipe and 5 stars all the way!
