Having lived in So. Florida for 10 years, the thing that I've really missed (besides the year-round perfect weather!) is smoked fish dip! I came to this site (and several others) specifically looking for it. I don't know what chef you guys mugged for this recipe, but it's as good as any that I had when I lived there!! I made my first batch using the wrong fish, (fresh catfish), and it was still delicious! Warning, if you use anything other than whiting or white fish, the seasonings have to be increased considerably! I serve this with sliced jalapenos, crackers, lemon wedges,and celery. Yummy with a capital Yum! Thanks Chuck & Chris!! Someone in Texas is really delighted to have this recipe!!!

This dip was great!  I  used salmon that I had smoked on the barby, so I omitted the liquid smoke.  My teenager said it was the first time she ever had fish she liked.  I was apprehensive that the taste would be bland, because the recipe lacks some of the "usual gang of suspects" in a dip, such as cream cheese, garlic, onions, etc.  No worries, this allowed the flavor of the fish to come out.  And it's low-fat!  This dip will now be my standard dish to take to dinners and events.

I live on Florida's West Coast and here, we call it fish "spread".  This recipe can be modified if fish isn't "smoked" and be good as the restaurants.  I just made mine and it's terrific.  Here's what I did to modify the recipe... I used tilapia, just a plain white fish (because that's what I had in the refrigerator).  I marinated with lime juice.  I cooked the fish in a pan with just a tiny bit of butter on high heat so it got crusty on the outside... just a few minutes on each side if the fish is thin.  No need for a messy food processor!  I sliced into tiny pieces, but in a bowl with all the ingredients in the recipe EXCEPT, I was liberal with the Old Bay and the cracked pepper.  A little bit of garlic powder thrown in, too.  Also, if you're serving this as an hor d'oeuvre for a crowd, you'll want to double the recipe.  Use an ice cream scoop to make a rounded serving or two on leafy lettuce.  In Florida, fish spread is served with Captains wafer and sometimes Tortilla Chips.  Hope that helps!

I followed the recipe exactly... and it tasted bland and gritty!  I wasn't going to let $9 worth of smoked whitefish go to waste, so I added a couple more dashes of wor. sauce, 10 dashes of tabasco, an extra pinch of Old Bay, and 1T each of mayo and sour cream.  My family seemed to like it (no requests for the recipe), but I was disappointed.  Too much work for so little reward.

I'm a native Floridian and my husband and I LOVE smoked fish dip. This was my first attempt at making it myself. A friend gave my husband a bunch of smoked mullet and this is what we did with it. This recipe is very close to what is served in the local restaurants. I added an extra tablespoon of mayo and sour cream and omitted the liquid smoke. Next time I might try adding a little red onion. Served with crackers, lemon wedges and hot sauce. YUMMY!

Great recipe.  For those of you that are disappointed that it doesn't taste like the gulf coast version might not be using the right fish. We use mullet and the flavor also depends on the person smoking the millet. I am from the gulf coast and we smoke the millet with oak and then make the dip. You can come close with other fish but it just isn't the same.

This is a really nice dip for any occasion! I added a bit more seasoning but I did not add liquid smoke as I wanted just the smoked flavor of the whitefish to shine. Healthy and tasty!! Thank you!

Hubs belongs to a fly fishing club and is always bringing home smoked trout, so I decided to try this out for him.  I made this as written and let him taste it.  He wanted it creamier, so I added more mayonnaise and more sour cream.  I also increased the Old Bay and left out the liquid smoke.  He is really enjoying this, so I’m sure I’ll be making it again!

I live in Treasure Island Florida and this recipe is perfect!  I didn't use the food processor, I use smoked mullet that we smoked our self. I took it to a neighborhood gathering and everyone wanted to know where I got it!  I did squeeze half a lemon on it at the end.

Delicious!  I used plain greek yogurt instead of mayo and probably 30 + drops of hot sauce.  I couldn't even taste it before 15.  I will be making this again.  It's such a healthy and different way to prepare fish.

PLEASE NOTE: This recipe uses Smoked Fish. The person who complained about following directions and getting a mushy dip, most likely used baked fish. If you do not have a source of smoked fish, you can smoke your own (directions available on internet).

This was okay, not a good as I was hoping for, not what I remember from living in South Fla. I used trout that we had smoked, maybe it was not the right fish to use. I did have to double on the spices to give it any taste at all.

i thought this was a really great recipe, and pretty easy for most people. Although i went the extra step. Instead of buying smoked whitefish, i smoked it myself and the dip was excellent. Like most american families i don't have a smoker. So, i bought this little wood chip box and placed it near the holes where the propane leaks out and placed aluminum foil on the grill plates, this turned out very nicely. WITH THE WOOD CHIPS YOU MUST PLACE THEM IN WATER TO GET THE SMOKE TO RISE. I soaked the wood chips in Blue moon Beer to get more Flavor. Great recipe, Great Food, Great Times!

I LOVE this recipe and so much appreciate this CHEAP trip back to West Palm Beach FLA!  I have made it exactly as written above and it was the rave of my parties.  I have used other fish and have modified slightly to suit.  I've used trout and salmon although the best is the whitefish. I do not recommend mackerel. Couldn't be easier to make!  I serve with Club crackers and Pepperoncini peppers as my favorite restaurant in West Palm Beach would serve. Thank you!  Thank you!

I enjoyed this recipe.  After boning fish, it was a breeze to make.  I did double all seasonings and added some diced jalapeno from a jar.  Yum!

This was easy to make and tasted great. We smoked some fresh fish on our camping trip and had just enough left over to make this when we got home. We followed the recipe exactly except our fish was seasoned as it was being smoked. This made for a spicy dip. Now I know to use less hot sauce.

I recently moved to Florida and was introduced to whitefish dip served as an appetizer at the local fish houses.  When I saw smoked (with oak) whitefish at the seafood counter, I bought the fish to make my own.  I didn't change anything in the recipe and it was better than restaurants.  I flaked the fish by hand pulling little pinches at at time  so that the pin bones were easily seen to pick out.  I had no bones in my dip.

I might add a little parsley next time to add a little color and I could see finely sliced green onions, chopped pimento or jalapenos might make a nice change but the base recipe is perfect for any customization you might want to add.  

I would also serve on endive or baby butter lettuce leaves for a carb free option or use celery sticks for dipping.

I caught a 25 pound wahoo on Tuesday. We ate it steaks on the grill and brought the rest to the smoke house. I made this dip tonight and it is better than any I have had in the local restaurants. I served it on crackers with jalapeño slices and fresh lemon from my tree. Heaven!

I followed the recipe, tasted it, added more smoke, and enjoyed! Theres still an element that is missing but this dip is still very close to the dip Ive had in florida. I eat mine on a cracker with a piece of sweet onion and a small amount of sliced jalapeno. YUM!

I used baked tilapia and it turned out nicely. I did season the fish with old bay and lime prior to cooking and I upped the sour cream, old bay and hot sauce (I like my food a little spicier) and omitted the liquid smoke. Also really no need for a food processer, it blended well with just a spoon. It seemed a little runny at first, but after a half hour in the freezer it was perfect consistency. Brought it to a party with some large sesame wafers, when those ran out my friends continued eating it with tortilla chips. Went over great!

Great tasting, but I modified it a wee bit, also added 1 tablespoon of cream cheese, extra old bay and a little extra lemon! Topped the crackers off with some jalapenos and crystal hot sauce!  Very happy with the way it turned out and it tastes much better after a few hours in the fridge. Very Good!

Excellent recipe and easy. Tastes just like the whitefish salad you get at the deli. I increased the spices a bit just because I like a lot of spice and the flavor of the fish still comes through. I did add some finely chopped red onion as another reviewer recommended. Served it on a bed of watercress with sliced lemons.

Wife and I are from Tampa Bay now living in the Midwest. Seafood is not their thing. Made this recipe after smoking some frozen salmon and mixing with a little smoked cod. Turned out great. Servo d with saltines and slices of pickled jalapeño just like Gators on the Pass.

I bought fresh cod and smoked it 2 hours.  Followed recipe exactly and dip was restaurant worthy for sure.  Will make again. Thanks for recipe!

This is a pretty good recipe.  I used smoked Mackerel (that came in one of my Japanese Bento boxes that I had ordered to go).  I made it using cream cheese instead of sour cream to make it a thicker spread.  I also skipped the hot sauce altogether.  It came out wonderful!  I spread it on Carr's Water crackers with some capers to top it off.

I used salmon and mackerel i smoked on the Weber.  Did not use a processor.  I added 1 tbs sweet relish, bumped the Old Bay to a tbs, tsp celery salt, and 2 tbs minced sweet onion.   Better than any dip I've had in a restaurant or bought from a store.  And I've tasted dozens of 'em.

Don't use the Food Processor!  Shave the smoked fish with a bread knife.

Used 3 tbs Mayo + 3 tbs Greek Yogurt
Grated 1 tbs each of onion, celery and carrot
Juice of 1/2 lime, or 1 key lime.
Used Hot Pepper Oil (chinese) instead of tabasco sauce.
Followed recipe otherwise.

Mixed it all with a fork until spread was mixed and consistent.

Absolutely great!

The family’s loved it!   Great simple recipe and thank you for that!  I made it with whole Yellowtail Snapper on a BGE smoked/grilled fish until 160.   I made it three different ways with different hot sauces and different amount of mayo/sour cream all came out great!

Best dip here in town. Live on the coast and have had raving reviews from everyone who has tried it. Only thing I changed was adding 1/2 stick of cream cheese and some scallions.

I used freshly caught and oak smoked whitefish from Lake Huron and added green onion and a touch of garlic. I omitted the liquid smoke as I wanted the real smoke flavor to shine through. The family loved it and this will be the base of all my smoked fish dips from now on.

Great basic recipe for your own tweaking. I use actual smoked fish from the local fish market (Thanks Pop's), so I have no need for the liquid smoke. Ad some jalapenos to your garnish list.

Made this with some fresh smoked amberjack -- amazing!!!  I didn't give it a 5 because I think the quality of the smoked fish you use probably makes a difference... and I did have to add 2 teaspoons of Antilles Spice Clipper Old Island Recipe Fish Spice to give it enough flavor for us.  Picked up the seasoning in St Maarten - not sure if it's available in the US, but there are many good fish seasonings out there - just use your favorite.

I will definitely make this again.  It is a great base recipe for fish dip but needs to be kicked up a notch.  I don't like Old Bay Seasoning so substituted Prudhomme's Blackened Red Fish seasoning.  Also added a bunch more hot sauce, garlic powder, a bit more mayo and sour cream.  I used smoked Mahi for my fish.  Easy to do without a smoker....throw some wood chips in a disposable foil pan, put on the grill and cut up your fish in chunks.  Spray with cooking oil and use a fish grill over the pan.  Turn every 5 minutes or so...will be ready to go in 30 minutes.

Loved it with a little twist of seasonings! We used freshly smoked yellowtail ( as found off shore in California ) skipped the liquid smoke but added 2 dashes of old bay and some ground cayenne pepper, other than that we followed the recipe.

read the recipe and immediately hopped in the car and bought some smoked mullet at the Mullet Shack at Apollo Beach
 never tasted mullet before. I can't believe what I've been missing. this dip will be a staple for Sunday football watching.
