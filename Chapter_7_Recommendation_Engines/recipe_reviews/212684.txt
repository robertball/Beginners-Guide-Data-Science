I made these with left overs after thanksgiving.  I tweaked the recipe a tad - first I added cumin powder, chili powder and a touch of brown sugar to the sauce to give it more of a mole flavor.  Also, to the turkey/sour cream/cheddar mixture I added more chili powder and some diced black olives for added flavor.  The enchiladas were a huge hit!

This was a hit with my turkey loving family. Although the turkey flavour might have been a bit heavy for the mild flavour of the cheese and sour cream, the sauce was amazing with yellow pepper instead of jalapeno.  I will definitely make this again (as an alternative to the use-up-the-leftover-turkey pot pie).

I have a very similar recipe that I make all the time.  It is slightly easier with similar results.  When making the sauce, cook together 1 cup Chicken Broth and about a 1/2 cup of salsa (hot or mild, whatever you like).  Once it's hot, add a rounded tablespoon of cornstarch, blended into a few tablespoons of cold water.  Bring to a boil and cook about 2 minutes stirring constantly.  Reduces the amount of cutting and chopping and saves a few minutes.

This is fantastic. Just the right amount of moisture. I read the reviews that said it was bland, and added about 1/2 tsp chili flakes, but that made it a bit too hot. Next time I'll use 1/4 tsp chili flakes. Also, I used about 2 tbsp of flour instead of 1 tbsp. The sour cream is a lovely contrast to the spiciness of the sauce.

This was good. I used fat-free sour cream and increased the turkey so that I could make 6 enichiladas instead of 4. There was enough sauce, too. I might try crushed tomatoes instead of the diced--my DH likes tomato sauces but not chunks of tomatoes.

This was excellent! I would however add more sour cream due to the fact of reheating, it was kinda dry when doing that. Deffinately add more cheese too.  The sauce was easy, make extra if you like it really covered. I doubled this recipe and it made 2 large pans!

I made these with turkey left over from A/ R Slow Cooker Turkey Breast.  They have GREAT flavor and I will definitly make them again.  When I began preparing the recipe I put the tomatoes in a strainer to drain and continuously "shook" the strainer while making the rest of the dish.  My problem was that the enchiladas were soggy and when I plated them the tomato topping slid right off the top.  Next time I will use 14 oz diced tomatoes and fresh tomatoes for the remaining 14 oz. Again, great flavor and good for leftover turkey.

This recipe is awesome!  Living in Canada I can't find good Tex Mex anywhere and this brought it home.  I used a can of ROTEL tomatoes (with chiles) then added some velveeta cheese (half a small block) to the sauce and the family was all over it.  Great with the spanish rice recipe on this site too.

The turkey and sour cream mixture was good, but it was too tomatoey. Not enough seasonings, so I added cilanto and cumin. The flour tortillas got soggy so if I try the recipe again, I'll use corn tortillas.

Wow, talk about bland!   I doubled jalapeno, and used 4 cloves of garlic, but it still was irritatingly mild.    Edible yes, but fails miserably if you are expecting something that actually tastes like an enchilada.

This was a great meal! I did change a few things. I increased the flour to 2 tablesspoons. I used 14 ounces of diced tomatoes, drained and 14 ounces of Picante sauce. It came out perfect. At first I thought there was too much sauce but it was the perfect amount and they did not turn out soggy like I was afraid of. Cant wait to try this with chicken!

I used a chopped chipotle in adobo sauce in place of the jalapeno pepper.  It gave it a nice flavor and spiciness.  The enchiladas were even better the second day.

I made this exactly like described. I was not impressed and neither was my husband. It was bland needed something else. What exactly I could not say but I do know I will not be making this again. It filled the tummy but that is just about the best I could say about it.

I will make this again when my picky eaters are out of the house and I can spice it up for my husband and myself. This time I had to change it some. No black olives, homemade enchilada sauce I keep on hand. Corn tortillas were used and I softened them by rubbing some oil over them, then enchilada sauce, stuffed the tortillas with my turkey left over from Thanksgiving and shredded cheese, rolled them up and covered with more sauce, cheese. After removed from oven, sprinkled cilantro over the dish. Served with fresh salsa and sour cream. Also squeezed lime juice over the enchiladas. Served with Spanish red rice and tortilla chips. Not the healthiest, but still Yum! I would like to add green chilies, jalapenos and black olives, different cheese like queso fresco or manchego the next time I made this for the adults.

I didn't like these due to the flour tortilla was soggy. However, it was easy to make.
