Made this for T-Day 03...Good Lord this was chocolately!!  I used only 3/4 cup of chocolate chips & it was STILL too chocolately!  My husband, however, ate it up like it was his last meal ever!  My tips: use less chocolate chips when mixing, bake for 30 minutes & cover with a foil tent (stick a toothpick in the center & layer foil over it like a tent....otherwise, the foil will stick to the pecans), then finish baking so you have a pretty golden pie.  Thanks for sharing the recipe; will definitely make this again!

this recipe was awesome!!!, i made it for my brother in law  from L.A.,  although going by other reviews I decreased the chocolate morsels to one cup,  and I used dark karo syrup instead and I added a capful of premium vanilla flavor, I cook it  by 9 PM and by the following morning it was gone! so I have to make another one. this one is definitly a keeper.

This pie is easy to make and bakes up
beautifully, but it's just too sweet
for our palates.  If you love chocolate,
and have an awesome sweet tooth, don't pass this one up.

I tried making this pie for Thanksgiving and it was flop.  I followed the recipe and the top of the pie burned (not the crust) and the inside wasn't even cooked.  I was very disappointed.

There was so much filling for this pie that it overflowed in the oven while it cooked. I suggest using a deep dish pie crust. I used less chocolate then called for and it still overpowered the pecan taste.  My family said I should just call it a chocolate pie. The pie was so rich I felt my heart racing minutes after eating it. I LOVE rich desserts but this one was too much.

I made this for my husband because he loves pecan pie and he loves chocolate pie, so I thought he'd really love this. I don't like chocolate or pecans, so I can't comment, but based on his response, this will not be made in this house again.  He said the chocolate was completely overpowering and I used less than was called for. I gave a few slices to my brother and he said it was only OK.

Sorry,  I just don't like the mix in this recipe. No one that tried it, liked it. Just not our thing I guess.

I made 1 and 1/2 recipes. I made 2 beautiful pies and did not run over the sides. I did not measure my pecans, I just placed them in a circular pattern on top of the pie. It bubbled up enough that it coated the pecans. Yummy. I also used some dark chocolate wafers that I had lying around, approx 1 cup. Again, Yummy.

This is too much filling for a 9" pie crust, had filling left over. It was more of a chocolate chip pie rather than a pecan pie and overwhelmingly sweet. If you are wanting a traditional pecan pie flavor with a hint of chocolate, this is definitely not the recipe to try. Possibly use half of the chocolate recommended for this recipe.

You need to bake it longer than 50 minutes if you want it to set.  I have made this a few times and people love it, but I've learned to cut the sugar by a bit, cut the chocolate chips to 3/4 C, increase the pecans, cover the crust edge with foil and bake for approximately 65 minutes.

I have made this pie three times in the past week, trying to get it just right. It is so rich with the chocolate that I like it best with mini morsels, a little more subtle. The filling is so generous it can be used in two 7 inch pie shells or one deep dish, 9 inch.

This is a great recipe and extremely rich! If you are a chocaholic, you will love this recipe. Keep it to very small pieces though, as a regular slice is almost too much. My 10 year old thought that it was almost too chocolaty!

I will make this recipe again, but maybe I will use about half of the chocolate that it suggests, and maybe fill it with a few more pecans. I would even suggest adding a little bourbon or even Kaluha to make up for the chocolate.

This recipe was just a little to rich in chocolate for my taste, and I'm a chocolate lover.  But if you're craving something super sweet, this is the recipe for you.

Have done this just i melted the chips and real butter, dbl the recipe except for chocolate chips. Makes 2 pies. Wrap with foil strips to keep crust from overcooking. Fold everything else as usual, bakes out jus wonderfully. I did 20 one year for family and friends. Freezes great too! So can do early and then hand out to everyone. Doing again this year when I go home, along with a cpl Apple pies. Yes I plan on working my A off again for Chrustmas, but so worth it just to be home again. I'm in charge of being in the kitchen a great deal of the time and let my sis-n-law have a break. Tommy

Really easy to make. After I read the other reviews, I split the recipe into two pies. I topped it with whipped cream, chopped pecans and caramel. So Good!

This recipie is wonderful.  My husband loves pecan pie, and he loves chocolate.  So this was made just for him.  If you have chocolate and pecan lovers in your family-- give this one a try!
