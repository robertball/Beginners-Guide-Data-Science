These were delicious!! And so easy to make.  I had leftover mashed potatoes so I tried them in some too.  Actually preferred the ones with potatoes to the stuffing.  Make sure you have gravy to dunk them in!  Will definitely  make again.

What a good idea!  I was looking forward to having leftovers just so I could try these.

These were the bomb!!! Best to get all your ingredients ready and probably have a little extra. My husband loved them.
