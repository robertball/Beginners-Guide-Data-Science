This was fabulous.  We eat a lot of Thai food, so the ingredients really caught my eye.  The only changes I made this time were: substituted one of the tbl of veg oil with sesame oil, prawns instead of chicken, reserved one of the tbl of cilantro and sprinkled it on top of the rice to serve, and squeezed fresh lime over the entire dish.  My husband said it reminded him of the rice he had in Thailand.  (I did not know what kind of "green" chile the original recipe calls for.  In San Diego, all types of chiles are available, so I used jalapeno.)   Next time, I will add an egg, reduce the oil by at least a tbl, and top with chopped roasted peanuts (unsalted).  03/22/09: I have made this recipe several times since this review.  Now I use a bit less oil, but still use 2 parts canola to 1 part sesame oil.  Before I add the rice I scramble in 1-3 beaten eggs (sometimes I double the recipe).  I add the unsalted chopped peanuts before serving.  I have also made with just chicken, just shrimp, and a mixture of chicken and shrimp.  It is so good.

This is EXCELLENT! It makes a great base for fried rice, with limitless options for add-ins.    I made mine without the chicken and cilantro; threw in a handful of julienned carrots with the garlic and cooked for a couple of minutes; turned the heat up really high and added the rice, then made a well in the center and scrambled an egg and mixed it in. I then added the sugar, fish sauce, and soy sauce, along with a scant teaspoon of sesame oil, which in my opinion is a necessary ingredient for authentic-tasting fried rice. Don't skimp on the fresh basil either; wow, that is a great taste!  I don't have a wok or a gas stove, but even with a large skillet on an electric stove, this worked really well.  Just remember to turn the heat up really high before adding in the rice, so that it cooks quickly and doesn't get "gummy".   
My DH raved about this fried rice!! He thought it was fantastic, and my 3-year old gobbled it up as well.  Be sure to double the recipe if you want to have even a chance at leftovers.  It's good cold or rewarmed.   This will become a staple in my recipe repertoire.

I am eating this as we speak.  I made exactly as written except I used olive oil instead of vegetable oil.  It is so easy to throw together and is not your traditional fried rice that I am used to but is a welcome change.  Great taste!

Very good rice! Important note: the rice measurement should be for UNCOOKED rice, not cooked rice.  I made this recipe measuring out 2 cups cooked rice and it was very oily.  Use 2 cups uncooked rice to get the proper consistancy.  I doubled this to freeze for OAMC and it is great!

This is one of the best recipes I've made from this site! I LOVE pad thai, but find it a little time consuming to make. I did add a few ingredients, mainly because they are in pad thai. I cooked the garlic in sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. I added 2 scrambled eggs,and used shrimp instead of chicken (my husband loves shrimp) and also added chili powder. I chopped up extra cilantro and green onion to put on the table (I like lots of both) and added bean sprouts. My rice came out a little on the thick/sticky side, but I've never cooked with jasmine rice before, so I wasn't sure how it was supposed to look. It still tasted FANTASTIC and I will be making this recipe for many years to come!!!!

This is a wonderful recipe, and incredibly easy to cater to your specific tastes.  I used pork instead of chicken and sesame oil instead of vegetable oil, and because I live somewhere that fish sauce is not readily available, I substituted another tablespoon each of oil and soy sauce.  I also added finely diced zucchini and an egg.  It came out fantastic.  I'd never thought of using cilantro in fried rice before!

I will give it 5 because it is the best "base" for thai style fried rice I have found so far. I actually spiced this up a bit by adding a teaspoon of crushed red pepper (if this is too hot for you then seed your chiles), other better additives were celery, carrot and white onion to the garlic mixture so they all could caramelize together and then added the rest of the recipe. Will definitely make again - my way - thanks for sharing the great recipe.

This is a very flexible recipe. I have made it with chicken, shrimp and most recently, scallops. I think it works best with seafood. The complementing tastes of the basil and cilantro make this dish and should not be left out. The only changes I make are substituting olive oil for the vegetable oil and adding 2 tablespoons of “hot” sesame oil. Since there are so many dominate flavors in this dish, do not waste money on expensive fresh shrimp or scallops. The frozen bulk variety from Sam’s Club or other warehouse stores work just fine.

I wish I could give this 4.5 stars instead of only 4!  After 12 years of marriage to a lovely Thai woman, I can tell you that this a pretty close to the way she makes it and would be delicious as is. Of course every Thai cook has their own recipe and for me, the following changes put this recipe over the top. The differences are that she uses red chilies (not that important), spicy Thai basil (pronounced: bi-g'pow) - which makes a huge difference in flavor; she omits the sugar and regular soy sauce and uses sweet soy sauce and thin soy sauce (available at SE Asian markets) which is a significant substitution (sweet soy has a subtle blackened cane sugar flavor and the nutty flavor of the soy bean is more pronounced in Thai thin soy sauce than in either Chinese or Japanese soy sauces). She also adds chopped tomatoes and butterflied prawns in the last minute of cooking and tops each serving with a fried egg (not scrambled - cooked to desired doneness) and finely chopped peanuts. serve with fresh cilantro, lime wedges, white sugar, red chili flakes and fish sauce with green chilies as condiments. This is so scrumptious - you HAVE to try it just once! BTW the Thai name for this is Khao Phad.

My husband loved this fried rice. I squeezed lime (just a little) over it just before serving and it brightened it up a bit. Very good.

I love fried rice and I LOVE cilantro, so this was one recipe I HAD to make!  I always have jasmine rice on hand, mainly because it cooks so quickly but also for that lovely "perfumed" flavor.  The cilantro just adds to the perfume!  I made a couple of changes, out of necessity only... didn't have any fresh chiles, so chopped up a fresh jalepeno, didn't have fresh basil (wish I did!) so used dried.  I left out the chicken as I made Oriental Drummies on the grill for the main course, but added a scrambled egg instead for protein and more body.  Even with the changes, this was SO GOOD!!  Next time I make it (it will be a regular in this house!) I will make sure that I have fresh basil on hand because I think that would just kick it over the top!!  Thanks, Mitch, for the excellent recipe!

love this...i add 1tbsp asian red chili sauce, use 2 more tbsp of cilantro, and dried basil not fresh. i use basmati rice which works as well as jasmine (used 1st time i made the recipe) because basmati works out cheaper for me.

Excellent fried rice!! I left out the chicken and served with Lemon Ginger Shrimp (recipe on this site) and they went together perfectly. I used Thai Basil, basmati rice and doubled the fish sauce and soy sauce but other than that followed the recipe exactly. Will be making again soon!

I gave this recipe a 4 star rating because I did not add both the fish sauce and the sugar. I never did add or eat fried that had sugar and fish sauce in it. Otherwise this dish tasted fine. I cooked 2 cups of rice and chilled it overnight. It was not hard to put together. I had leftover rotisserie chicken that I cut up into cubes. At the end I stirred in the chopped green onions, basil and cilantro. I also seasoned with a little Hawaiian sea salt and black pepper. This dish has a nice herb fragrance, tastes fresh and is lightly seasoned which I liked. The scent and flavor of cilantro is pronounced in the rice. If you like Chinese Parsley, a.k.a. Cilantro, then you would like this fried rice dish. Otherwise you might want to cut back on the amount of cilantro. Then again, this is “Fried Rice with Cilantro”. I served this with, “Egg Foo Young,” also from this website.

I made several changes, both of past reviewers and my own, but the result was five star!  First, I wanted to cook the chicken separately (we have an atkins person in the house), so in it's place I scrambled two eggs and added them at the end.  I cut the oil by at least 1/2.  But I think what made this extra special was the addition of julienned cabbage and chopped onions.  About a cup to 1 1/2 cups of each, I sautéed in the oil and garlic until onion was translucent.  Then I proceeded as recipe suggested.  I added the egg when I added the basil and cilantro.  This got rave reviews from all and I'll definitely make it again!

This was a great recipe! I added too much oil and so everything was waaay oily, but still really good. I think next time I will add some veggies or tofu to it though. And More cilantro because I'm in love with it.

This recipe is so good! I make it every time I have fresh basil and cilantro. And I've stopped measuring these out, it's fool proof. Tastes good no matter how much cilantro or basil you throw in. I love it with chicken and bacon best. Great summertime meal! Thanks!

This is a very easy recipe. When I made this we were already having stir fry w/chicken so I subsituted chicken with eggs (2) and it tastes great! 
The best part is, I had it for lunch the next day and so the soy sauce soaked in it tasted even better!

This was very good fried rice!  I made the full recipe with the intention of it being the main course for two people, and there was still a nice big bowl left for lunch tomorrow.  I altered this recipe to fit what I had on hand- shrimp instead of chicken, frozen peas and no basil.  I didn't put the full amount of cilantro in but will next time.  Also, I cooked the ingredients out of order from what it says based on reviews, but next time I'll do it like the recipe says except add the cilantro right at the end.  Served this with egg drop soup and steamed barbecue pork buns.

This is delicious. It is quite hot though, I used about 3 cups of rice, I would probably use even more. I also used shrimp which I added with the last steps.  Substituted Thai basil for regular, excellent!! Great side dish for Thai food.

Not bad. A nice change from the typical Chinese fried rice. It has a slight sweet taste to it and reminds me of Thai fried rice alot. I dig the flavors of the baail in the rice. Worth a try!

Excellent and easy!  I didn't add any meat to it as i was looking for a side dish to go with potstickers.  This was really good - very flavourful.  I didn't have green onions, so just used very finely diced yellow onion, added a bit of celery and grated carrot.  Used fresh cilantro but dried basil.

I really liked this recipe. I got a little nervous when it was time to add the fish sauce because I really didn't like the smell of it but when the dish was complete it tasted delicious! Glad I tried it!

Added diced sweet pepper and an egg that I scramble before adding the rice.  Very good!

Wow this was really good! I put 2 "cups" of brown rice in the rice cooker (the cup given with the cooker isn't really a cup) the night before so it would be cold when I made this. I used dried basil because I didn't have any fresh. Next time there will be fresh basil. Otherwise I followed as written - maybe a little less oil. My boyfriend didn't even hesitate to rate it 5 stars!

Made with shrimp.  Used 4 chops of cilantro.  Used wok oil instead of adding separate garlic.  Followed suggestions of 2 T wok oil and 1 T of sesame oil instead of 4 T veg oil.  Added one beaten egg when I added the rice.  Kids approved for keeper file.

I made the following substitutions:
No garlic or green onions, so I cooked the chicken with a brown onion.
One red chile instead of two green.
After the chicken mixture cooked, I removed from heat and covered to keep warm. I then stir-fried a bag of Thai style frozen veges. When they were done, I added the rice and sauces. Then I made a well in the middle and scrambled two eggs (I doubled the entire recipe- plenty for leftovers!) and added the chicken mixture back in to warm.
It was great, and quick and easy to prepare. Serve with lime wedges- the flavour really sets it off!

This is a pretty good way to use left over rice and chicken.  And I also added the egg like others suggested.

This was easy to make and tasted really good.  I could not find fresh green chiles so I used canned.  Other than that followed recipe exactly.  I might cut down on the sugar next time.  It was a little sweet.  My husband ate this without complaining so it's a keeper!:)  Thanks for sharing:)

Wow!  I was looking for a recipe similiar to my favorite thai fried rice, this was a great base recipe! I added about 1/3 lb sausage, carrot, red pepper, and onion.  I deleated garlic, green onion and sugar, upped the soy, and added garlic chili sauce.  I also added bean sprouts and fresh tomatoe wedges.  Thanks for a great basic recipe for my favorite carry-out thai rice!

This is PERFECT!!!!  Love, love, love!  For an entree, it's great with the chicken, but if you like it as a side dish, I recommend sauteing mushrooms, carrots, and any other veggies you like.  The sky's the limit; you could add anything from toasted almonds to tofu.  Thank you!  I will def make this again.  I omitted the green chiles and fish sauce when I made it for my kiddos.

Delicious! I sauteed Napa cabbage and Shiitake mushrooms and then I added a raw egg scramble lightly because I didn't have chicken. I used frozen chopped basil and cilantro. The recipe has a balanced foundation of basic ingredients for fried rice, so experimenting is easy and tasty. Great recipe! Thank you!

Just finished with this. Added extra cilantro and basil, and used long grain brown rice only about 1.5 cups of cooked rice.  Separately fried up some fresh broccoli in veggie oil and sprinkled it with crushed red pepper.  EXCELLENT result.  Definitely sticking this in the physical recipe box and making this again.

It was simple to make and tasty. However, I felt that it was a bit bland. Maybe it was because I omitted the basil since I didn't have it at hand. I also didn't use chicken but fishcake since I only had that at the moment. For the oil, I used olive oil and sesame oil instead in the ratio of 3:1. I also added diced carrots because I love them! Another thing about the dish was that it was a bit greasy. The next time I make it (definitely I would), I would add less oil. Also, the dish in my opinion requires a tad more heat. I'm gonna put in some chilli padis next time.

Amazing!!! We make a "plainer" version of fried rice from the "More With Less" cookbook all the time to use use up leftover rice--probably 2-3 times a month. Really, what other way is there to use up leftover rice? :-) Our whole family--including the kids--loved this new variation & I ate (or scarfed, as my husband said) what was left in the pan! Easy & definitely tasty enough to eat again many times!

This recipe is really good.  I used four cups of rice, doubled the fish/soy sauce but kept the oil the same.  It was absolutely delicious.  It didn't taste fishy at all.  I will make this again!

This rice was awesome!  After reading a few of the reviews, I added a couple of eggs which I beat and fried up first and took out until I put in the rice.  I also added crushed peanuts at the end.  I used shrimp instead of chicken.  The result was a fabulous rice dish good enough to serve company.   Quite reminiscent of pad thai but much less labour intensive.

I LOVE this recipe. the sauce is so easy yet very flavorful and the entire dish is incredibly versatile. I have made this with different combination's of chicken, pork, egg, and shrimp as well as used a ton of different veggies. My favorite combination so far is chicken and shrimp along with diced bell pepper, jalapeno, and onion. A must try!

Best fried rice!  I took the advice of some other reviewers and replaced a little of the vegetable oil with sesame oil.  I also added carrots and mushrooms. Garnished with extra cilantro and lime.  I made mine with a mix of chicken and shrimp. Also another reviewer said his thai wife puts a fried sunny side up egg on top of each serving and then mixes it in before eating.  I did this just for fun.  It was great.

I replaced 1 tbs of oil with sesame oil.  I beat 2 eggs and scrambled in the pan before adding the rice and other ingredients.  I omitted the fish sauce as I didn't have any.  Squeezed lime over the top before serving.  Love the jasmine rice!  Delicious!

This was surprisingly tasty!  Ive made fried rice before and it always tastes bland.  But, this one was so good..better than a restaurant! I made it vegetarian by taking out the chicken and adding carrots and peas.  I also stirred in about a teaspoon of ground ginger and that really took it up a notch!

I picked this recipe because of the fresh herbs and I wasn't disappointed! It was very flavorful, and I agree with others that it's similar to what you'd get at a Thai restaurant. The only thing I changed was to add in the goodies you normally see in fried rice - egg, peas, carrot, bean sprouts, etc. Yum!

Made this for New Years Eve Dinner. Fantastic Spin...I love fried rice and when I saw the twist of Cilantro ( a very spanish food) I had to try it out. Absolutely delicious. I omitted chicken cause I was too lazy to wait for it, but it tasted great without! Definitely try this recipe.

This is delicious - i added a couple handful of frozen peas for color and I have no left overs.  This also was a very quick dinner.

This was delicious! Instead of using chicken, I put a ton of veggies in it and served it with the candied garlic wings from this site...it was a huge hit... I did use a little sesame oil in the rice, and to those with sticky rice issues-jasmine rice is stickier than normal rice, put a little olive oil in the water that you cook the rice in...this usually helps me.

This was a nice, light meal and easy to make. I didn't have fish sauce, so I doubled the amount of soy sauce. My husband and I both agree that the flavor wasn't very exciting. I think the fish sauce might have helped. Also, I added egg instead of chilis- the chilis might have given it some kick. Next time, I'll put the cilantro and basil in at the end without cooking it. Cooking it for that minute made the fresh herbs a little wilted and bland. I added sweet thai chili sauce on top of my serving for a little extra flavor.
Thanks for the light n' easy recipe- it's a good starting ground for adding your own twists!

We love chinese and thai food. This recipe was great - easy & delicious! We omitted the cilantro since my husband doesn't like it. I also added a scrambled egg and used jasmine rice.

This was excellent! So easy to make, took no time and everyone raved about it! I highly recommend this for anyone who wants to change things up! I didn't add egg as other reviewers mentioned, but next time I think I will. (Note: if you make rice, make extra. Leftover rice makes this quicker and easier.) I didn't add chicken, I paired this w/ Hawaiian Chicken Kabobs from this site and it was AMAZING. Hubby loved it!

Great Thai fried rice.... I used chicken this time but I'm looking forward to trying it with seafood. Fish sauce isn't available in our small town, but I've had luck finding it online. Try importfood.com.

My husband and I loved this recipe! I cut out the chiles because I don't like them, we didn't have fish sauce so I left that out too and I used brown rice instead of jasmine. I'd love to try jasmine rice though because I've had it before and it's a yummy smelling rice - I just didn't have any either. It still was wonderful - a sweet pleasant taste that worked well with the chicken. I'd like to try it with shrimp some time. Thanks

Good fried rice.  Since I'm not so hot for spicy foods I only added one green chili; the result was a very mildly spicy fried rice.  Next time though, I'm going to skip the chili altogether and use green peppers instead.  I'm also going to use less basil and more cilantro.  Finally: good tip on adding the rice after the sugar and sauces!

I was deliberating ordering a takeaway biryani or a pad thai when I decided that I would look up ingredients that I had on allrecipes - chicken and soy sauce - and discovered this recipe! It was ready in no time and deeelicious! I continued to cook the chicken in the soy sauce and fish sauce a bit then added the rice.

Wow... thanks so much for this yummy recipe!

I modified it a bit to use up some of the veggies I had laying around. Added diced carrots, snowpeas (finely sliced), shredded cabbage and some lime juice. (and I used bacon as that is all I had on hand)

This tastes so good... it will definitey become a regular meal around these parts!

Great twist on fried rice.  I made it with shrimp instead of chicken & added a few frozen stir fry veggies. It was a little sweet & very yummy with the cilantro.

I would give this 20 stars if I could! This is the best cookie recipe I've come across! (And notice I didn't say "best WHOLE WHEAT cookie recipe" it's the best, period!) I've made it 2x so far, the first time exactly as the recipe says, and the second with all whole wheat flour (I only have regular whole wheat, not whole wheat pastry), and both were perfectly wonderful. The best part is the dough, it is soooo nice to work with! You don't have to chill it to get to ball nicely, it has a fabulous consistency all on its own! (Note: I don't have margarine, so both times I used slightly softened butter). Anyway, thank you for this amazing recipe that has now become my standard cookie recipe!! (and I make cookies a lot!!) :D

Excellent.  I've made this several times now.  I can't find fish sauce anywhere so I used oyster sauce.  Also, you'll need significantly more soy sauce than this calls for.  I use the low sodium stuff.  The use of sesame oil in conjunction with the vegetable oil is a must.  

Also adding a chopped up fried egg is good.  The chicken came out a little bland, so when I cooked it in the oil, I added a little soy sauce then.  If you could marinate it ahead of time, it'd be even better.  The fresh herbs are a must, I've had trouble finding them, but don't skip on the basil and cilantro.

One final note- I tried this once with brown rice.  Though healthier, it doesn't soak up the sauce/liquid like jasmine rice does.  I ended up with a saucy fried rice instead, so use the jasmine rice.

Pretty good! I was expecting BOLD flavor, but this ended up being quite mild (at least for my palate). Nonetheless, I enjoyed this quite a bit and my hubs REALLY enjoyed this (a HUGE plus)! :) I did have to make a couple of changes to suit our tastes, however.... I have to agree with HORSEZ001. As is, this is VERY moist / oily. Because my box of (Goya brand) rice did not specify how many MEASURED servings each cup of uncooked rice would yield, I had to guess.... This ended up being my saving grace since I had about a cup's worth of leftover rice to work with. To compensate, I added an additional 1/2 T of EACH liquid ingredient AND sugar to my rice - PERFECT! I could not locate Thai chiles, so I used serrano peppers instead (jalapenos are also a suitable substitute). Chicken was my protein of choice, but I will try using shrimp or scallops next time. Because this dish is so delicate, I think seafood would pair wonderfully with it. Chopped scallion and peanuts were perfect garnishes. A squeeze of fresh lime is an absolute MUST (it "made" this dish, IMHO). Veggie spring rolls rounded out our Asian-inspired meal. Thanks for sharing, MITCHNSTEVE! With a few minor tweaks, this was a darn good weeknight meal. :-)

Will make again but try with reg white rice next time. The jasmine was sticky, but I did like the taste.  If the white rice doesn't taste as good, then I will go back to the Jasmine only.  I think the fish sauce really makes it. We do a regular Fried Rice & will use fish sauce in that now also.

This was DELICIOUS! I marinated the chicken in soy sauce and garlic powder for a day first and added mushrooms and green pepper. I also used regular white rice. DEFINITELY recommend the lime squeezed on top- really finished it off. If doubled, good for big groups! Will definitely make again!

Delicious recipe, I tried several other thai fried rice recipes but this one has been the best one so far. Instead of the chili pepper I used 1 tbsp of Thai chili paste to stir fry the chicken. I probably used twice as much green onions and little 2-3 tbsp more cilantro. I also added a couple of eggs, this one is a must. I didn't have any basil but still came out great! I'll try it with basil next time.

This was fantastic!  I've never had fried rice turn out this good before - very authentic.  Per other reviews I doubled the recipe but not the oil and used half sesame oil.  Added sliced onion and mixed frozen veggies.  Added a scrambled egg with some soy sauce mixed in.  Family went nuts.

I did not care too much for this rice. Although this is my first time cooking jasmine rice, I do not like the fish sauce flavor added into this rice. The reason I rate this a three is because even after adding some honey in rice to enhance the flavor, I still did not like it that much. This is not the best fried rice I've eaten. Thanks anyway for posting this recipe on site.

Best fried rice ever! The only thing I do different is for the oil I do 1/2 sesame oil and 1/2 regular and I add a couple of scrambled eggs. SO good!

I love this! It's fresh tasting and you don't need to add any dried herbs to give it flavor since it has so much flavor on it's own. I made it last night and followed recipe except I used 2 cups dried jasmine rice, and once it was cooked used it all. Also I omitted the fish sauce and used a sesame vinaigrette. (tony wu's garden vinaigrette)
Made it again tonight since there were no leftovers. I didn't even need to measure anything but the sauces and sugar. 
The family liked it as is, but I added fresh lime juice and unsalted peanuts to mine. It's soooo good!!!!

I  added some onion and cayenne pepper, since the green chile pepper is a bit too spicy for me. This dish is really terrific.

This was really yummy. I didn't have basil but the cilantro was outstanding in this. I subbed eggs for the meat since I made this as a side. I started w/ half the amount of garlic and oil to cook the eggs. Then I removed them and and added the remaining garlic and oil and cooked the rice. When it was ready I returned the eggs to the dish so they wouldn't get rubbery. I used leftover brown rice for this. I definitely recommend trying it with brown rice. I served it with slow cooker beef and broccoli and some frozen egg rolls.

Yum! Really easy to throw together and so adaptable to ones tastes. I used Thai basil and used 1 tbsp of sesame oil in place of 1 tbsp of vegetable oil, palm sugar instead of regular sugar and sprinkled a bit of lime juice on top (a combination of other peoples' suggestions and what was on hand). I'll definitely be trying this again with some additional veg and different types of protein. Also, I'm quite sure that you should COOK two cups of dry rice and chill it, not add 2 cups of cooked rice. 2 cups dry yields upwards of 4 cups of cooked rice. This would probably be a little greasy if you added only 2 cups of cooked rice. Thanks for sharing!

I used this as a side dish so I didn't use any meat or fish added in. I read some reviews and left out the sugar, subsituted the veg oil for olive oil and added one egg.  Used this as a side with seasoned wild salmon. Yummy! My husband and I loved it.

Very good recipe to start with--cut the sugar in half--double or triple the sauce, but not the sugar; add red pepper flakes, Sesame oil.

AWESOME recipe!! Hands down best fried rice I've made. We all gobbled this up.. Made with oyster sauce, (couldn't find fish sauce), extra soy sauce and I added two scrambled eggs, used chicken breasts and large shrimp, I forgot to add  the sugar and I wont add any next time either, everything else was exactly. I loved the fresh basil!... LOVE this recipe! Some of the takeout places by me could learn a thing or two with this recipe.. And thank goodness finally a fried rice dish with NO frozen peas and carrots!! . I will make it often!

I used less oil than the recipe suggested but didn't have any basil on hand. I used grocery-brand sesame oil, and it didn't do great things for the dish, but had I used a good quality sesame oil, it would've been much better. I love cilantro, so I think I must've doubled the amount for that. Even without some ingredients, it was awesome!!

This is the equivalent of what most Thai restaurants serve as their Thai Fried Rice!   Be careful with the fish sauce...AKA don't spill it around because it stinks! (but it's good in the food). Be precise with the soy sauce, because if you add too much it gets way too salty.

Altered this recipe to be more like the Thai Pineapple Fried Rice I love! Rice ingredients: 2 cups jasmine brown rice (cooked two days prior), 2 tbsp vegetable oil, 2 tbsp sesame oil, 2 eggs, 5 garlic cloves minced, 1 cup pineapple chunks drained and halved, 1 chicken breast cubed, 10 frozen shrimp thawed, de-shelled, and halved, 1/2 sweet onion chopped, 1/4 cup raisins, 1/4 cup chopped cashew nuts, 1/2 cup of chopped scallions, 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro. Sauce: 1 tbsp white sugar, 1 tbsp fish sauce, 1 tbsp lite soy sauce, 2 tsp curry powder (personal stash from Shanghai).   Prepare sauce and set aside. Heat oil. Fry garlic until golden. Add onions, chicken, and shrimp. Once cooked through, stir in beaten eggs, and scramble. Turn to high heat and add rice. Stir in sauce. Add cashews, raisins, pineapple, cilantro, and scallions. So good!

Cooking the meat with the green chilies is brilliant.  I've been making fried rice for a while based on advice from Cooks, but this recipe has completely changed my tactic.  I used a can of diced chilies when I couldn't get them fresh, and it worked great too.  Also, the cilantro is amazing.  As with any fried rice, you can add whatever vegetables you like.  I used carrots, celery, green peppers, water chestnuts, broccoli, bean sprouts, and, of course, the green onion.  But the chilies are really what sets this recipe apart.

This is a 5 star recipe.  I never made fried rice like this before, and this one was delicious!  At first, I was skeptical about using white sugar and fish sauce, but oh boy... it turned out to be a fantastic fried rice!  Thanks for the recipe.

Oh my gosh!  This was so good and relatively easy to make.  I didn't have green peppers so I added red pepper flakes.  The other change I made was to add chopped white onions in with the garlic.  Oh and I added a splash of sesame oil.  The cilantro made this dish.  Yum!

This was just average for us. I think the fish sauce overpowered the rest of the flavors.

I was a little nervous about making this and it turned out fantastic! The boyfriend loved it and the cilantro was an interesting kick! I was most nervous about the fish sauce but it turned out fine.  Must definitely add sesame oil and an egg to top it off!

I used this as a starter recipe, and ran from there. I was really inspired by the use of herbs in this rice dish, and loved the flavours! To make it vegetarian, I used silken tofu instead of chicken. I added more garlic, a dash of sesame oil at the end, added peas, fried in an egg, and replaced the green onion with chives. All in all, really useful and delicious. Thanks!

I followed the recipe but NO one in my family liked it, including me.  For one, there is WAY too much oil!  The rice was SO greasy.  Second, it had a fish sauce after taste; so be warned and lessen that ingredient.  Third, with cilantro in the title of the recipe I expect to actually taste cilantro.  We love cilantro but the other flavors overpowered in this recipe.  We will never make this again, there are other fried rice recipes on this site that actually taste like fried rice!

Very good & easy!!! Fish sauce & herbs add nice flavor to make a more Thai fried rice than Chinese style. I didn't have any chili  peppers on hand so I added a bunch of crushed red pepper for a little heat. Also scrambled an egg into it like others, but completely forgot to use sesame oil, which I will definitely try next time!

Excellent, tasted just like real fried rice!  I didn't have the fish sauce, so I just doubled the soy (reduced sodium) and it was great!

This recipe is so good! I did make a couple changes, adjusting it more to our taste.  I cut down the oil by at least 1/2,  added extra garlic and threw in some frozen peas and bean spouts while the garlic was cooking.  I also added a sliced up egg pancake (plain omelet) for color and towards the end I added close to a tablespoon of SESAME OIL, I think this is KEY to get the same sort of flavor that the restaurant version has.  I don't think I will add the chili peppers next time though, it just seemed to be an odd taste and take away from the "fried rice" taste that we are used to.   Definitely a keeper though, just throw in whatever veggies and meat suit your taste buds!

Very good fried rice!  I had never cooked with fish sauce before, and after smelling it almost didn't use it at all!  I doubled the cilantro, because we love it.  Very full of flavor, just don't smell the fish sauce. :)

I made it as directed but I did add an egg, and use a bit less oil as others suggested.  I'm only giving it a star b/c I have to give it something. I wouldn't suggest this to anyone - and I LOVE CILANTRO!!!!

So good!!! Probably among the best fried rice I've ever made! I didn't have the chillies or fish sauce so I left those out, but it was the cilantro (which I love) that made this recipe anyway! I was heating up leftovers in the microwave at work and coworkers said it smelled so good!

This was a terrific fried rice recipe, I used 2 serrano chilies and it added just the right amount of spice/heat! Next time I may add some sliced water chestnuts or slivered almonds for an additional crunch. My husband loved it, and he has a picky palate!

Sorry I have to disagree on this one it really lacked flavour for me which is a suprise as I love cilantro,basil, soy sauce and fish sauce (hence the 3 stars) perhaps as I used light salt soy but no I don't think so.  Infact it is sitting on the table now and DH has been tying to persuade the kids for 25 mins to eat it and they are fighting all the way and I am point blank refusing. Far too much oil aswell had to pour out quite a lot and it would have been better not too have cooked the garlic so much prior to the chicken being added. I was tempted to add to this but have made a promise to myself to cook as directed.

This is awesome.  I was looking for a side to go with Korean BBQ marinade from this site and my sister told me about this recipe.  They go great together.  I use boneless skinless chicken thighs instead of breasts.  I also add more fish and soy sauce than it calls for.  I think the sauces should be to taste.  This one will stay in my recipe box.

Awesome...great flavor, like others, I couldn't find fish sauce so added extra soy sauce.  Doubled the recipe for only 4 of us but I wish I would have tripled it as not too much was left over. I only added 1 and 1/2 the oil (instead of doubling) and even then it did seem a little oily. (used half sesame).  Will definitely make again

I definately liked trying this recipe I love to make chicken fried rice and my father loved it. Adding egg definately helps, also I definately suggest adding more chicken. I have plenty of rice leftover, but all of the chicken was fished out when serving.

This was so simple and great tasting! Nice little bite from the chile. I didn't have any cilantro {wish I did}  I added the fresh basil after I was finished cooking to keep the fresh flavour and also like some others mentioned...I had to add the egg!!

Oh, yum! I used brown basmati rice and chicken sausage, what a flavor! As per previous suggestion, I did not use the fish sauce and made up the difference in the oil and soy sauce - I think next time I will only make up half the difference in the soy sauce and leave the oil alone. This was so easy, I will definitely make this again!

This is always good.  I shred the chicken and add about 2 Tbl of minced ginger, a bag of frozen peas, and a handfull of oyster mushrooms.  At the last minute before serving I stir in a drizzle of sesame oil.

Very good. I ate this along with "Ken's Spicy Chicken Curry" (recipe can be found on this site). Don't forget to add egg! It's not fried rice without egg - that's what I think anyways.

This was super easy to make and delicious. I've never made fried rice before so I'm thrilled with the results. We added leftover chicken and pork to the recipe. Next time I'll try shrimp. This recipe is definitely a keeper!

I thought this was very authentic tasting.  I didn't have cilantro, and it still tasted wonderful, so I can only imagine that would improve the taste immensely.  My husband was very impressed with it....and my kitchen smelled like downtown Bangkok, Thailand, for the next day or two (probably due to the fish sauce!) :)  Next time I may decrease the amount of fish sauce just a little bit for personal preference, it was a perhaps a little overpowering for me personally (although my husband would disagree).  I'm just not crazy about it, I hate the smell, but it's often necessary for many Asian dishes! :)  Oh, and I also didn't have any green chili's so I used red Thai peppers.  Great recipe!

been cooking this rice for 4 days straight, really really yummy flavor.  I didnt have cilantro though so i just cooked it with the basil.  The taste was perfect!  I can imagine how much more yummy it would be with the cilantro!  You guys have to try this :)

I thought this was awesome. I a container of leftover coconut rice from the a few nights ago. I only had 1/2 of jalapeño so I added in some Sambal Oelek spice and it was really good. I also added sesame oil instead of all olive oil.  I didn't overcook the chicken which I think is key.  I used just one of my butcher box containers of chicken which was a perfect amount. I also only had a tad fresh basil so I added in a bunch of dried basil.  I also added in some scrambled eggs. But next time I might not scramble them. I served this with frozen dumplings I had on hand. So good.

Wonderfully different, tasty!
Very important that you measure and prepare all ingredients before starting.
Once begun, the cooking moves very quickly. I had to throw away the garlic and start again because I couldn't move fast enough adding the ingredients.

This was really good. Doubled the recipe. 6 tbsp avocado oil, 3 chicken breasts, 4 cups uncooked rice. I had the oil too hot at first and burned the garlic. Took it out and thru in some dehydrated garlic which I wish I’d done from the start. Yummy dish!!

Made this tonight to go with smoked Chinese BBQ pork tenderloin.  Used brown rice, oyster sauce instead of fish sauce, added broccoli,carrots, and an egg.
It turned out great!  Will definitely use this as a base for many fried rice bowl dinners!

This recipe is great. I’ve made it a couple times. My kids only complaint was that I didn’t make more! Not sure what the green chili is referring to. I tried poblano and serrano. Will try something spicier next time.

This is the best fried rice recipe I have tried. My family loved it. I doubled the recipe to have leftovers and used 1 lb of chicken breasts cubed and 1 lb of fresh shrimp. Otherwise I followed the given instructions. It has a very fresh Thai taste- similar to the taste of our local Thai restaurant fried rice. I think the basil and cilantro are essential. I was skeptical about the jalapeños but they add a very nice flavor without being overpowering. I garnished with fresh cilantro and peanuts on top. This is a keeper !! Thanks for this recipe!

Lovely recipe for fried rice. However, I tripled the amount for the sauce and used mince chicken to give the dish a more even texture. Also added broccoli and will add scrambled eggs next time. Tipped it with Siracha sauce, too.

I followed what one person suggested with using  one part sesame oil, also peanuts on top and a squeeze of lime.  I made it quite spicy, also added some thai sweet chili sauce.  Was very confused about adding sugar, but it worked!  Used brown rice because that is all I had - loved it.

My first successful fried rice! So delicious and quick. I swapped the veg oil, green chilis and chicken for coconut oil, red chili peppers and eggs (2 eggs added to the middle of the skillet and cooked through just before adding the basil and cilantro and mixing it all together for the last minute on heat). This will be a regular!

I had to substitute mild Mexican peppers for deseeded jalapeños as my missus declared the jalapeños too spicy.  The dish turned out very bland though I’m not sure this is the only reason.  Adding lime as suggested by one reviewer didn’t help.  My kids declared they prefer store bought fried rice to this but it might not be a fair test.

Amazing results, made a few modifications:
-Cook an egg or two in the center of the pan once everything is added and cooked
-Made with Jalapeno peppers, made for a great kick and good flavor
-Smaller amount of fish sauce, the flavor isn't entirely necessary, and frankly it smells like  anyway

Doubled the fish and soy. Used dried chiles and tripled. 1.5 cups dry Jasmine brown. I found this recipe to be the easiest non-packet based fried-rice and much better than the spice packet variety while not having numerous spice ingredients to remember and assemble. So trivial to prepare, that this will be my new fried rice.

Amazing. So delicious I went back for seconds. I added finely chopped cauliflower and used brown rice. My husband thought it was too sticky but the flavor was awesome. I added more rice after it was done cooking to make amount go further. Definitely going to make this again.

Really delicious and easy to substitute things in and out.  I used basil paste (from the produce section) and omitted the green chiles.  I added some heat with crushed red pepper and after sautéing the chicken, scrambled two eggs quickly (my husband's only "must have" in his fried rice.)  Really delicious, will be making again and again!

My entire family (including my picky kids) loved this recipe so much! It came out delicious and I will definitely make it again. Everyone wishes that I had made more. I doubled the recipe but I wish I had made eight cups! Four cups were not enough for my family of four!

Easy to make, my 3 girls love this recipe.   I cook all my rice in a rice cooker.  I store overnight in the fridge with no lid to help dry the rice out.  I have made with other meats or without meat completely.  Stir fried vegetables such as peas,carrots, onions are all great adds.  I had some left over noodles and followed this recipe with no rice and it turned out nicely.

I came across this recipe while looking for pork fried rice. I needed to use two pork chops I had on hand. While I was going through my fridge I found some left over vegetables with red pepper, broccoli, carrots, and a few chopped onions. Then I scrambled a couple of eggs in for extra protein. I left out the fish sauce as I didn't have any, but the major change I made was using spaghetti instead of rice because my brother in law stopped by and he's not a fan of rice.It was delicious!

Although I added eggs and used brown rice instead of rice it was absolutely delicious. I didn't add chicken to mine instead I had green beans on the side. It was QUICK, EASY and delicious. I also cooked my onions with the eggs.

I enjoyed this recipe quite a bit.  I used red bell peppers instead of green chili peppers, because they were what I had on hand, and also added one more clove of garlic.  Note:  It's pretty easy to burn the garlic on the heat setting recommended.  Be careful!

When I lived in California there was a Mexican/Asian Fusion restaurant I used to visit on lunch hours. they had the most amazing Cilantro rice well since I left California and no live in the Midwest I have not found a replacement and I missed it a lot. 

This is not exactly like theirs but it is a good start, I will be tweaking this recipe till I get it right. Thanks for sharing it is as close to home as I have found so far.

This was a really good recipe. I did make some changes though; I used coconut oil instead of veggie oil, I used white onion instead of green (because that's what I had) and cooked the white onion in with the chicken to soften it up, and I omitted the sugar entirely. Delicious.

This is delicious. I used less oil because I felt that it didn't need 4 Tbsps. I don't really like when people change the recipe then rate but I will say that I did change a little. I just added a few mushrooms and green beans and a little more spring onion but even if I didn't the flavour of everything was spot on just as the recipe is. Thanks for the recipe. Definitely a keeper.

This is a fantastic recipe! I left out the fish oil, and used the breast meat of a rotisserie chicken. Also a little more soy sauce, and some black pepper. The cilantro is a genius idea-really compliments the flavours! I can't wait to make this again.

This was perfect! Fast and easy to make and you can easily substitute here and there. I made mine vegetarian and just added more veggies, it was great!
Thanks for the post.

REALLY good. But I wanted a little more crunch to it and would add some vegetables, maybe broccoli, celery, peas, something like that.

I've made the original recipe and though it was pretty good, I felt there were a couple of things that could be added and subtracted from it. I left out the basil because I like a more subtle flavor in my fried rice and I didn't see the need for sugar. My personal modifications included adding eggs(which were flavored by fish sauce and a bit of salt), maggi seasoning sauce, fresh ground black pepper and sesame oil. The end result is an amazing flavorful fried rice!

I rate this a five for being highly adaptable. I followed reviews to use less oil, use a bit of sesame oil, and I added about 2 tbsp rice wine vinegar at the end. It was a great touch. Instead of meat, I added pretty much all the veggies in the house. Peas, carrots, onions, bell pepper, finely chopped spinach, and mushrooms. I used fresh basil, but I couldn't quite detect the flavor. I grow my own basil, but if I didn't, I'd likely try the dry herbs. Make this how you like it. The fish sauce and soy sauce really make the flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

My family loved this. We don't care for fish sauce, so we substitute hoisin sauce. We also love cilantro, so usually double it. Have made it with chicken, shrimp and leftover pork chops. Very good!

Delicious!  I sort of tripled the recipe....this is what I did. I used 1.5 lbs of chicken breasts, diced and cooked with 5 cloves of garlic, 1 jalepeno pepper, and a large handful of finely diced baby carrots.  Removed the chicken from pan, increased heat, and added in 7 cups of cooked brown rice (for the health factor...started out with 2 cups raw).  Made a well in center and scrambled 2 eggs in it.  Poured mixture of sauce (3 T. sugar, 3 T. fish sauce, 3 T. soy sauce, 1 t. sesame oil) and stirred to combine.  Added the chicken back, along with a generous sprinkling of dried basil and cilantro (couldn't find fresh).  Added in a handful of chopped green onions.  Whole family liked it except picky 3 year old who wouldn't even taste it.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow!  Thanks for the great recipe!

This is a good fried rice recipe.  However, it was not great.   It is the first time I have seen fried rice without any egg.   It needs at least one egg and I will add that the next time.

We thought this was good but not amazing.  I don't understand the rave reviews... definitely a solid recipe but I think I need to try other fried rice recipes before making again.  I also thought the fish sauce was overpowering; this could have been in my head however, because my fiance wasn't bothered by it at all.

Easy and tasty...  I found that it needed a little something, so I added about 1/2 a teaspoon of ground ginger and it turned out great!  The recipe called for cubed chicken and I was unsure what size to go for...  I would recommend about 3/4" as you dont want the garlic to burn before the chicken in cooked through.

This is fantastic stuff. I can't get enough of this recipe! Make sure that you cook fast or things will get to mushy and soft. That's the key to a good stir fry.

Awesome recipe!!!  My first attempt at making fried rice at home and it was gobbled up!  I used pork tenderloin sliced rather thin.  I also added frozen peas and sauteed one large chopped carrot along with the garlic.  Also added scarambled eggs.  Didn't have onions, basil or cilantro on hand but my boys did not miss any of these ingredients.  They did however ask for extra soy sauce.  Amazing all around!

YUM!  I'm eating this rice right now, and it is soooooo good!  The only change I made was omitted the chicken (I made sesame chicken to go with the rice), and added a fried egg and broccoli.  It is great with the green onions and cilantro!

I really liked this recipe as written but after some modifications I LOVED it!
*orginal review*I did not use green onions (didn't have any), and substituted firm tofu cubes for the chicken. When it was finished cooking it seemed a little too dry so I made another batch of the sauce. I added a handful or so of frozen peas, an egg (scrambled), and some chopped tomato. It was very good.*updated* I came home from work and wanted this as leftovers. I ended up adding some more chopped tomatoes, diced an avocado, and added some chili garlic sauce. With these changes this dish was fantastic I couldn't stop eating it. I will definitely be making this again and soon! Thanks for the recipe.

What a good recipe and exactly what I was hoping to find.  I wanted a Thai style fried rice.  This was delicious and I took a cue from another reviewer who said the exact amount doesn't matter.  I used diced pork and some turkey bacon as well as 3 cups of rice.  I added the bacon with the cilantro, onion and basil at the end.  I also used a little sesame oil and more soy sauce and fish sauce than the recipe indicated.  I threw in some diced carrot when I added the rice. I sliced some cucumbers and quartered some roma tomatoes to serve along side the rice. I will say that, like most ingredients, the quality of the fish sauce makes a difference.  I once bought a very cheap brand and it ruined the dish I was making.

Best fried rice I've ever had. Promise! I've had it from restaurants to homemade, not by me. My first attempt at making it and I'm not disappointed one bit. Neither was my boyfriend. Something about the flavor. Maybe it was the basil or fish sauce, but, they all went so well together. I did not add the chicken, chili pepper, or green onions though. We had the chicken on the side and I didn't add the other two ingredients because my boyfriend doesn't like them. Still tasty though. I also added a scrammbled egg towards the end. I will definantly follow the recipe next time I make it for myself. =) Will make it over and over again. Thanks for the recipe!

Wow!! This was amazing!!  I used leftover turkey and frozen peas  and this had such authentic flavor, and so quick to make!!  I cooked the rice in the morning to get it out of the way, and since the turkey was already cooked the meal took about 20 minutes to make, total.  I will try next time using brown rice.

Fantastic. If you like Cilantro you should try this out. We followed the recipe exactly for everything but the chicken, we used peel and eat shrimp instead. We just threw them in at the end so they would not get too tough. In the future we will make the jasmine rice the day before so it can dry out in the fridge overnight before frying it(perfect for fried rice dishes as it will reduce moisture in the rice). Will make this again and again!

Light, easy and delicious. I used more cilantro than this recipe calls whch was definitely needed. I used fresh jalapeno peppers instead if chili peppers because that's all I had. I omitted the fish sauce because I didn't have any. It was still excellent. I will make this over and over again.

Amazing! I make it without chicken as a side dish.  Goes well with Orange chicken or other asian dishes.

I try to make it healthier by using brown rice and adding more veggies (onion, carrot, red bell pepper, mushrooms). I also threw in a scrambled egg as the other reviews suggested and sprinkle some lime on top. Turns out great every time! The fish sauce is really the essential ingrediant in my opinion.

This was the best rice i've ever had. I added shredded carrot, used bacon for the meat and used long grain white rice cooked in beef broth. Other then that I followed the recipe exactly. Thanks for the best rice recipe ever.

This was great for at-home fried rice.  I made it with venison and it was great!  Cannot wait to try it with chicken and maybe add in some carrots and other veggies:-)

This is the best fried rice recipe I've ever tried! I modified the recipe by using shrimp, adding a few sprinkles of curry, and brown rice instead of white. Absolutely amazing!

Oh My, I love this fried rice. I didn't use any chicken at all though. Instead, I just put in eggs and vegetables like chopped broccoli, julienned carrots, frozen peas and frozen corn. Used only a little bit of fish sauce and substitute most of it with soy sauce since my husband doesn't like anything too fishy. It was really good!. Next time though I might throw in more basil and cilantro. ThankS for the recipe.
