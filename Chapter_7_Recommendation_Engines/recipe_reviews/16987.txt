I followed the reciped exactly and it just wasn't good.  The flavors didn't mingle well...seemed like there was too much thyme in particular.

I have a variation of this  recipe and it is a hit with my friends and family during the holidays.  I make my stock using celery, onion, tomato, and shrimp shells, and either whole pieces of fish or the heads and tails.  i don't use oysters but replace it with sliced pieces of fish (orange roughy or tilapia).  i tried flounder once but it breaks up and you can't distinguish it from the crabmeat. I also add sea scallops (sliced in half) or bay scallops.

Easy to make, I cooked it on low for eight hours I thought it would be dry but was perfect. Placed over white rice, the recipes creates a good portion for about three people. Would make again.

This is a great recipe. I added a few ingredients and a touch of my own. I added crawfish and smoked beef sausage and more hot sauce.
