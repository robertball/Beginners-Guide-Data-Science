My brisket was a little shy of 4 pounds and I used the full ingredient list. I used a smoker instead of the grill and did 10 hours in the smoker and 2 hours in the oven. It wasn't fall apart tender but brisket isn't supposed to be in my opinion. You need to be able to slice it. This sliced perfectly, was super tender, and the spice blend was very nice. The leftover held up well the next day too. I simply put it in the oven with its juices at 250 for 30 minutes.

Wow!  Absolutely delicious brisket!!!  I started with a 10 lb. prime brisket.  Prepared the rub exactly as stated, coated the meat completely, and placed it in my covered roasting pan (my grill isn't working).  Roasted it in my oven at 260 deg. for 9 hours (no peeking!).  The end result was a perfectly seasoned and extremely moist brisket.  The meat sliced beautifully (no shredding) and was incredibly tender.  This is my new go to rub!!!  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe.

Great rub!  Used a 12 lb brisket, smoked for 5 hrs and kept in the over for 7.  Will tent the foil in the oven next time to keep more moisture in, but meat was still tender and broke apart fairly easy with a fork.

Did the recipe exactly, we just added Mushrooms (baby Bella mushrooms to be exact) when you pour the sauce on the steaks. It turned out Amazing!

The timing was off ....over cooked... I adjusted. ...also the crust/rub we wasn't a big hit with us.. .good effort though
