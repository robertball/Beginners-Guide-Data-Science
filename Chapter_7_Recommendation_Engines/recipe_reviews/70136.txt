I made this into soup - I pureed everything together - and it was fabulous! I left out the cream.

Wonderful recipe, my husband and I both loved it.  Has a natural sweetness due to the cooked carrots and fennel bulb.  I made this recipe exactly as written.

Loved it!!  Making it again for Thanksgiving.  The only changes I made where a) I used half and half instead of cream, and b) I added a splash of dry sherry with the half and half.  I served it family style, topped with chopped fennel tops and lemon slices.  It looks as good as it tastes!

Really excellent.  Needed a good helping of salt and pepper, and turned out great.  I used some butter and whole milk (had no cream), and eventually needed to increase the amount of butter/whole milk to 3-4T/1c to give it the creaminess it seemed like it should have.

I added chicken broth to make it into soup. I omitted the fennel seeds as I find them rather soapy-tasting compared to fresh fennel. Turned out great. Thanks!

I just finished making this and it really is very delicious.  I used fat free evaporated milk and it worked perfectly!  I did add some salt and two tblsp. butter to add to the taste...lovely recipe!

Yummy! I omitted the fennel seeds and added a little garam masala spice. I didn't have any heavy cream so I used milk and butter instead. Lovely flavor but I think next time I'll use some coconut milk in place of the cream. Hubby really enjoyed it as well. Thanks for this one!

Wonderful recipe; can't wait to make again.  I didn't have coriander, so I used curry powder, I substituted 1/4 C. half-n-half for the 1/3 C. heavy cream and I used just a scant 1/4 t. anise seed.  How fun it is to try a new veggie (fennel)!

I agree with Sonia S.'s review: adding spices makes this unbelievably yummy. What I did differently was 
(1) I rubbed the stainless steel pot I was using with a stick of butter and cooked 1/2 of a diced onion until it was just browning and 
(2) added a little more butter (maybe 1 tbsp) when I put in the diced fennel. I cooked this for a little bit and then 
(3)added the carrots I had painstakingly grated (Grating added at least 6 min to the prep time for me)with no more than 1 tbsp of butter, making sure the pot was coated. After adding these three components I added 
(4) 1/2 tsp turmeric, 1/2 tsp ground cumin, 1/2 tsp garam masala, and then I added the 1/3 cup of cream
 (5) I didn't use the spices listed in this recipe, so I can't comment on their contributions to flavor. 
After stirring in the cream, I put a dollop onto a piece of plain bread (I didn't have any rice handy, which it would have been peRFEct with)-- it was pretty good except it was missing salt. 
(6) So, I added a light sprinkle--- no more than 1/8 tsp of salt which did the trick for me--- to the entire mixture-- and it became even yummier! I definitely recommend adding the spices and eating this with rice-- this is a wonderful recipe because of its simplicity and the ability to improvise with it, and still have it come out well.

This has a great blend of flavors.  I didn't have cream, so used evaporated milk instead. As other reviewers recommended, I added a little butter just before serving.  We will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe.

Although I didn't like this at all - too heavy, almost sweet, with a lingering aftertaste, too much of carrot and not enough of fennel -  my wife did.

I needed to use the fennel I got with my CSA so I made this.  It was really easy and really good.  I used half-and-half instead of cream and needed >1/3 cup.  I'll definitely make this again the next time I have fennel to use.

I love the combination of fennel and carrot, but I left out the cream in this recipe because I try to avoid dairy. I added a splash of white wine and it was very yummy,  I had fennel and 3 carrots in the house and not much else, so this was perfect.

This... what I will call a slaw... was fantastic. And just when I'd decided that I didn't like fennel (it tastes totally different raw).

Per others' recommendations, I also added garam masala and a bit of salt, and then I totally forgot about the heavy cream, and it was STILL fantastic! Can't wait to try it with the cream! :)

This is the first time I've ever used fennel. This recipe is so delicious. I didn't have fennel seeds, so just used a tiny bit of ground coriander as seasoning, along with salt and pepper. I'll be making this again, for sure.

Delightful! 

Things I did differently: I roasted all of it in the oven together before putting it in a saucepan, because I had the oven on to roast other veggies too. I used soy milk because we can't do dairy. I bet it would be wonderful cold too!

This was really good!  My daughter who claims she hates fennel ate  it off her plate before she touched anything else.  When I asked her how she liked it, she said it was awesome and wanted to  know if there was more.  When I told her it was fennel she was very surprised and it is now one of her favorite vegetable dishes!

I am a huge fan of healthy, unique recipes. But this pretty much tastes like steamed carrots (which would have been much faster).

Was surprisingly good.  I used almond milk instead of heavy cream since I'm on a dairy free diet right now and coconut oil instead of olive oil.  I also added some salt and pepper at the end. I could see this making a good soup.

I don't like cooked carrots, but I enjoyed this. My husband, on the other hand, who loves cooked carrots, didn't like it at first, but it grew on him. I used coconut oil and coconut milk, and I even added some dried unsweetened coconut, and I simmered it covered for about 20 minutes to absorb all the liquid. I think this would be good with caramelized onions and topped with fresh cilantro.

I thought is was okay but husband and teens did not like it.  One of my boys even thanked me for not saving the leftovers.  Oh well.  I think using a mortar and pestle on the coriander seeds to crush them a bit so the flavor comes through more would have made it more exciting.  Otherwise kind of bland.

I had some fennel and did not know what to do with it. I found this recipe and I admit that was skeptical, but this was pretty tasty. The only thing I added was salt and pepper.

The mild fennel flavor dresses up the carrots.  This side dish is a fun departure from my routine and cooks in about the time you can bake chicken breasts.

Because of my GERD I am trying to add fennel to my diet.  This was one of the first recipes I tried.  It is WONDERFUL!  Rich and complex flavors, but oh-so-easy to make.  We have this often now.  Even the kiddos like it. Made it exactly as written.

Interesting flavors, I liked it, husband did not. I assume the grandkids would like it as it is mildly sweet. I didn't add the fennel seeds because I didn't want to overwhelm it with that flavor. I will make it again it is a yummy side dish and quite fast and easy.

Delicious! I followed everyone else's recommendations and started with about 1/3 cup onion, then added the carrot and fennel. Added about 1 tablespoon butter, salt and pepper and just a smidge of cayenne pepper. Then more coriander until it tasted good then added the cream.  I used 4 medium carrots.

It was real good. I will definitely make again. I did use coconut oil instead of olive oil and it added such a nice flavor to the carrots. Next time I will use coconut milk too to make it dairy free and I will add more fennel. The ratio between carrot and fennel bulbs was a little off- not enough fennel.

Wow!  I didn't know what to expect , not having cooked fennel before.  Th e cream must smooth out any bitterness.  I added turmeric but not fennel seeds.  Terrific blend of flavors.

I gave this three stars, prepared as directed. It was little bland for my taste. I spruced it up to my taste by adding salt, pepper, garlic and a dash of brown sugar. I’d make it again with the added flavor.

I omitted the heavy cream, added some water and blended as a creamy soup. Loved it.

Excellent combination; carrots and fennel. I have made this three times now, each time trying some of the suggestions made in the reviews. I have to say, just follow the recipe. It is excellent the way it is written. The flavor is impressive not too fennely and carrots are the perfect compliment. It keeps well as a leftover in the fridge too.

This is insane. It's so easy and simple but it is so delicious! I didn't have the fennel seeds or spices in hand so I just did the carrots, fennel, salt and pepper and cream and it turned out so good. My wife's new favorite dish I'll be making. Make sure not too have too large of pieces of fennel or they'll be crunchy. Unless you like that. Not us.

Lovely delicate flavour.  I spiralized the carrots - fun and good for even cooking.  Also used half & half. Next time I will try caramelizing the fennel for a minute or so before adding the carrots.  I will also try some other spices, although the fennel seeds were a hit.

Hubby and I love fennel and always looking for new ways to use it.
This was an instant hit and I will make it again, and again. 
Really good exactly as is but also lends itself to many possible tweaks to make several new ways to use my fennel crop this year.

Got fennel in a CSA box and had no idea what to do with it. This dish was so delicious. It was heavier than I expected so it's best as a side dish. I will totally make this again.

I found this recipe and wanted to try it based on the fennel and carrots.  Once I read the reviews on this I decided to  try it based on their recommendations.  This might irk some people since I am reviewing an altered recipe but I am commenting for my own sake to remind me of how I did it the first time I made it. That being said, I thought this dish is fantastic! I sauteed 1/2 a cup of diced sweet onions until translucent, added the diced fennel and sauteed that a few minutes, and then added the grated carrots.  I cooked those all in butter for maybe 10 minutes or so. I added coconut cream and heavy whipping cream (ran out of coconut cream) until I got a nice consistency.  I salted to taste and added 1 and 1/2 teaspoon of garam masala.  This is my most favorite of all the spices and once I saw someone used that I had to try it this way!  I let this simmer a few minutes only since it was starting to cook down and I didn't want to keep adding more cream.  This was a great way to try cooked fennel.  I have only had it once before raw in a blood orange and fennel  recipe that was good too.

Love this recipe, made it several times!! Last time had no coriander so used a "curry" grinder of spices that had 21% coriander plus fennel & other spices. Worked well, just a bit more spicy than original recipe.

Good but very heavy - would be good in the winter, perhaps with some fresh mushrooms added.

Very tasty. I used 4 large carrots thinly sliced instead of shredded. Large fennel bulb, minus the stalks and leaf-y things. For seasoning I used 1/4 tsp. coriander & fennel & turmeric, 1/2 tsp. seasoned salt & garam masala & garlic powder & chili flakes. Increased the cream to 1/2 cup as we like out dishes a little sauce-y. I would probably use fresh onion and garlic next time. This could use some pepper too. Not sure how I'd like this as a soup, but it tastes great as a side-dish.

Prepared just like the recipe and I'm getting ready to make it again for a pot luck. A bit different than the usual fare at a pot luck but I think everyone will like it.
