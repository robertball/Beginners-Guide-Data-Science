Deep fried turkey started as a novelty at our house, but we are now in love with it.  I really felt that the whole jar of creole butter was too much though.  It helped keep the turkey moist, but the spice over powered everything else.

Deep frying a turkey is the only way to go. Once you deep fry, you will never have oven roasted turkey ever again. Cajun spices make this one great. In response to the first review, i think it is implied that you fry outside. Would anyone really bring their burner, propane, and three gallons of peanut oil inside???? Seems pretty easy to figure out. Great Rub A+++++++
