I actually used canned cooked chicken instead of turkey and I added potatoes that I boiled for about 10 minutes. I also used one package of turkey gravy and one package of chicken gravy and I bought some pie crusts at the store. It was very very good. I had to cook it a bit longer than 20 minutes. It was in the oven for about 25 minutes, but it was delicious.

Was great. I added penne and topped with biskets. Very tasty!
