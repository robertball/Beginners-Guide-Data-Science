I love Indian food and I love salmon, but this combination seemed kinda weird at first.     However, it smelled fantastic while it was marinating.  I only had one mid-sized fresh salmon steak (I was cooking for only myself) but left the marinade as is.  I supposed if I was making the full recipe I would double or add more marinade.  This fish was awesome!  It wasn't spicy (I held back on the cayenne  and I should of added more).  I always eat my salmon with lemon, and this tasted amazing on its own.  I will definitely be making this one on a regular basis.

I wish I could give this recipe six stars. I would seriously pay for this in a restaurant--it's that good. Great with fruited rice pilaf from this site.

We loved this! My husband is an Indian chef. I made this for dinner one night and he really enjoyed it! (Which is saying a lot, since he's not a huge fan of fish). Even the kids ate it...but they're used to the spicy stuff. I can't imagine eating Salmon any other way after trying this recipe.

This turned out really hot, and I'm not usually a fan of very spicy foods, but in this case it was a fresh, short lived burn, which was cooled by the moist fish and yogurt.  I'm trying to get more fish into our diet, and this is a great way to add variety to our menu because it really tastes different than typical fish recipes.

I had already stuck some salmon in a bag with some ginger and garlic with a little olive oil when I came across this recipe.  I whipped it up and added it to the bag.  The flavor of this fish was just wonderful.  Not too strong, just even taste and goodness.  I will definately try it again.

I love salmon, and usually prefer it plain and simple - no overpowering sauces or marinades, BUT....this was by far the best salmon I have ever tasted!  Mine actually marinated nearly 24 hours - I was kicking myself all day thinking I should have prepared it in the morning instead of the night before, but the end result was PERFECT!  Nice bite of spice, cilantro, garlic and ginger on the outside, perfectly moist, tender salmon on the inside.  My only change was to use Greek yogurt (all I had) thinned down a bit with some water.  Can't say enough about this one! I LOVE it!!

I love this recipe!  It was so easy to make  and so good to eat.  The combination of spices really complimented the salmon. I've shared this recipe with lots of friends and  even the kids asked for seconds.

This was great for a change of pace.  I usually use a soy sauce based marinade.

I loved this dish!  I was skeptical about the potential heat becasue of the cayenne pepper and made my 1, 4 and 6 year olds an alternative.  It turned out to only be a slight kick, so the kids will definately be in on the dish next time.

This recipe was so wonderful that I made it twice in two weeks! My two year old grandaughter couldn't get enough.  I have made it with salmon and with trout. 
I substituted a ginger garlic paste for the ginger and garlic.

This recipe is excellent!  Next time I will halve the salt as it was a bit salty and I used a little less cayenne than was called for because my spice tolerance isn't great.  This would also be a delicious marinade on chicken or tofu if your family doesn't all enjoy salmon.  I'm a vegetarian who eats fish, but I'm excited to try this with seitan or tofu. I will definitely be making this again with salmon as well--thanks for the recipe!

This is my first allrecipes review. This salmon is short of oustanding. I prepare as directed. No changes no substitutions needed. My husband loves it as is. Have also made with chicken. Super yummy. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

My family loved it!  Followed recipe as written except I omitted salt altogether, left the excess marinade on our salmon and baked it at 400 for 20 minutes (roughly).  It was fantastic.  Just enough bite for my husband and almost 7 year old son.  And me.  We love Indian food and enjoy making it often.  I served this over simple saffron rice (rice, water, and a bit of saffron in the rice cooker) and there are no leftovers.  Thanks, we will be making this again.  I also think the marinade would make a fantastic dip and plan to make some soon.  Maybe with a bit of sour cream to thicken it up a bit...or use greek yogurt instead of the organic stonyfield my husband bought.

I prefer salmon without any spicy sauce. It has a great taste on it's own without so many spices. Still very tasty recipe...you might like to try it, but not my favorite way to cook this fish....

This is by far one of the best tasting salmon I have ever had! The marinade tastes great and the garlic and ginger gave the dish a great texture. Overall, two thumbs up!

This was so good.  I don't usually like cooked fish, but this was amazingly tasty...so moist, so flavorful.  I marinaded for 24 hour then I broiled it....4 mintutes each side....so GOOD!!!!!   You must try this.  Wipe the excess marinade off, broil and enjoy.  I used greek yogurt and all the spices and it turned out really good.

This was absolutely delicious!
I cooked it for my husband and a couple of friends. They all loved it and asked for the recipe. 
Instead of regular plain yogurt I used Chobani's plain Greek yogurt.
Also think that 1/2 Tbsp of Cayenne is a bit too much. Was overpowering, so the second time I cooked it I used 1/4 Tsp instead.

Husband is a big fan of salmon with curry flavors, and this recipe did not disappoint. I marinated the fish for about 8 hours which was plenty. I cut back on the cayenne a little, and it still turned out pretty spicy. If i were to make this again, I would add a little bit of lemon or lime juice. Good stuff. Thanks!

Made pretty much as is. I used 2% Greek yogurt as the only change. This was unexpectedly wonderful. Just like others said, who would have thought. The only change next time would be to cook the fish with more of the marinade. I served this with roasted carrots that had many of the same spices, plus cinnamon, and Trader Joe's mixed rice medley.

I did not think flavor went well with salmon. I marinaded salmon overnight(as the recipe said)and add more yogurt to mixture. I prepared two fillets with this recipe, and after I ate the first fillet, I poured honey glaze over the second one to see if it would give salmon more flavor, but it still did not work. The baste was too watery during the cooking process, and I had to pour some juice out the pan halfway through cooking salmons. Instead of garlic cloves, I substituted garlic powder, everything else was the same. Overall, I was not satisfied with dish.

This was yummy and easy!  The only change I made was using greek yogurt instead of regular yogurt.  I also didn't remove the excess before baking.  The flavor was wonderful and it had just the right amount of spiciness.  I'll be making this again.

A nice change of pace for preparation of salmon.  We liked it but I was a little disappointed because I expected more flavor.  The kids (2 and 4) didn't eat it at all and they do eat salmon prepared other ways.

Wonderful marinade. Produced really flavorful and tender filets. I did not change a thing, and ground my coriander seeds fresh for this recipe.  I would however reduce the marinade by half, as it makes substantially more than is neccesary. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Excellent. Only thing I changed was to cut the salt down significantly and we didn't miss it. Great flavor with a little bite from the cayenne. Thanks! :)

Being someone who doesn't like fish, I quite enjoyed this meal and will make it again.

I cut down a bit on the cayenne, still came out a little too spicy for the kids, who usually love spice. But really good as a whole. Served with basmati rice and salad.

With the yogurt and cumin I had high hopes . . . just wasn't as flavorful as I would have guessed.  Suprisingly, the marinade made it taste fishy

My husband and I really enjoyed this as it was such a different way to make salmon! The marinade really gets into the fish, and it makes a nice, spicy flavor. We served it with okra, onions and mushrooms that we sauteed with Indian spices, and then just had some raw veggies (tomatoes, cucumbers, and carrots) on the side. Yum!

This was a wonderful recipe, so flavorful! I wasn’t able to marinate it overnight, only about 6 hours, and I was worried it wouldn’t absorb all the flavors. I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty it was! I imagine a full 24 hours would really make it excellent. Broiling rather than baking made it perfectly flaky on the outside and tender on the inside. It paired well with brown rice, asparagus and roasted red pepper & corn relish (recipe on this site). I will definitely make this again!!

Very good, but I found I needed to add liquid to the yogurt.  It was too thick.  I added a little white wine until it was a thick marinade consistency.

I did not use fresh ginger, but used the ground ginger that I already had.  I also used cilantro paste instead of fresh.  Turned out wonderful.  Great flavor (I do not like a fishy taste.)

Super easy and flavorful. The ginger was a bit ovverwhelming. My salmon was cooked more than my personal taste but that could also be my broiler. I'd make this again for sure. Served it with carrot rice (featured in the Allrecipes magazine) and stir-fried swiss chard.

I love salmon and I love using yogurt as a healthy moisturizing marinade-but this combination overpowered the salmon. Might try using yogurt and "lighter" spices next time.

I made this recipe with boneless/skinless chicken thighs and grilled them. It turned out great! I'm guessing thighs work better than breast because they have more fat/flavor. I did use a bit less cayenne but that's because my kids and I aren't big spicy fans. Adjust the cayenne according to your heat factor. Served with pita bread instead of rice.

This was amazing! The only thing I changed was using tilapia fillets instead of salmon. I also served sprinkled with lemon juice and fresh cilantro. The flavour was out of this world and just popped! This will definitely be a permanent dish in our house!

This was great ! Im trying to make fish at least once a week, and I thought I'd try this out...loved it ! My boyfriend was surprised when I told him the marinade was yogurt (fat free !) Only thing I changed was a little extra tumeric (1/2 tsp) and I didnt have any cilantro so I skipped that. Seriously I will be making this often, it was so easy and delicious.

We had high hopes for this dish but we thought it was just OK.  I followed the recipe to a T and my husband still felt it was a bit bland.  I definitely could taste the heat and garlic, but he was expecting more.  I, too, added the juice of 1/2 a lemon like Caroline C recommended and it added a nice touch.

I love this recipe! I have tried it with salmon, tuna and chicken breast. They all came out great! I do add more seasoning then what it calls for. Thanks for the great recipe.

This is fantastic! Seriously, if you eat salmon, you want to try this recipe. I didn't even marinate this overnight. I just threw it all into a bag and swished it around and put under my oven's grill. I didn't have fresh coriander, so I used fresh parsely and a pinch of ground coriander and I didn't use salt or chilli. I cooked my salmon from frozen, just wrap in foil for the first 5 or so minutes and I kept basting the salmon with the marinade when it cooked. I wouldn't do this if it marinated overnight however. I am going to marinate another batch now and have it for tomorrow night's dinner. Thanks. I am stunned at how great this is.

Did not make any changes to this and it was great - a little blander that i would have like, but really good - and super easy.  Marinate the night before, come home from work, throw on some brown rice and veggies and wah lah!  I will probably try it again because it was so easy.

I love salmon and was looking for a new way to fix it. I also love Indian so this seemed perfect...and it was :-) So easy and quite tasty. I served it with saffron rice - a perfect side for this salmon.

Very tasty!  I advise watching it carefully if you have a powerful broiler - five minutes a side was enough to blacken both sides.

Very good! I made it as written and then served it with brown rice, mango chutney, and some raita (yogurt and cucumber). I will definitely make this again.

Super recipe! I cut the garlic in half and think that helped to bring out some of the other flavors (also because we have HUGE garlic cloves here in Norway!)I also wrapped it in foil and grilled it. A real keeper!:-)
