This pie is delicious and easy to make.  I used instant pudding because that was all I had on hand and it seemed to turn out fine.

I used 1 can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 eggs...Yum! and just to spice it up, the second time I added two teaspoons espresso powder..very good! Tip: Hide a slice for yourself or you won't get any.

This pie was so easy to make, and incredibly delicious! I used just a tad less corn syrup than called for, and it still tasted sweet and chocolatey. It went quickly for Thanksgiving dessert; and I'm about to make another one for a different holiday party!

I was looking for a recipe just like this one.  Something that had the flavor of fudge brownies but in a pie.  It's good and fudgey.  I warm it up a little in the microwave, and it's great.

I needed a quick pie recipe for items I had on hand, and this was perfect.  I had to use instant pudding as it was all I had in the cupboard, and it seemed to work out fine.
