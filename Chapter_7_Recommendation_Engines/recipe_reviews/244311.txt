This is my "go to" recipe for making Impossible Pies.  It works well for any recipe that calls for biscuit mix and includes milk.  I make up a large batch of the baking mix and then freeze it.  I substituted oil for the butter and I go easy on the salt.

Great Recipe I doubled it to use with Red Lobstter biscuits with 1/2 cup of cold water, and mixed in 1 cup of cheddar, brushed them with 1/4 cup butter melted with 1/2 tsp of both Italian seasoning and garlic powder and 1 tsp of parsley. baked in a 450 degree oven for 10 minutes.

This works quit well. Cold butter seemed the easiest way to cut into the flour mixture. I made Quick Cheddar Garlic Biscuits from this site and they turned out great.

Love this simple recipe! I mixed up the dry ingredients, then added melted butter along with eggs and milk  to make pancakes.  Wow, great results! I'll never buy bisquick again!

I used this recipe as part of another recipe, and it worked well.  I appreciate having proportions for one cup of flour; it makes it easy to mix up only the amount you need for a recipe.  I did this the prior day, so I still got the time benefit of a mix on the busy weeknight.

This mixed came together very well; very easy to blend using my pastry cutter.  I prepared it to be used atop a casserole.  It is a dish I've made for years loved by many.  Unfortunately, the batter did not rise well staying virtually flat.  Perhaps my baking powder was the issue?  Don't know as I used it not too long ago producing a good quick bread.  Won't use the recipe again.

I used this in a pinch after realizing I did not have enough bisquick for pancakes. Absolutely perfect! For pancakes I used oil instead of butter. Great substitute thank you.

I've used this recipe, as it, for at least a year now and it never fails. Much less expensive than a box of the retail stuff. Easy to make and the ingredients are for 1 cup only. Great when that's all you need.

Just wondering though, if anyone here as added BUTTERMILK POWDER to the mix to create Buttermilk biscuits?

I am not a fan of Bisquick so was very happy to find this recipe.  I have used it to make the cheddar biscuits (this site) and they turned out great.  I made no changes and will make it whenever I need a biscuit mix.  Thanks for sharing.

I increased the servings to 16 (4 cups flour, etc.,...) and mixed it in my food processor.  The butter was cold not softened.

These turned out amazing! They really fluffed up when cooked over soup. I made a double batch in the food processor by adding the dry ingredients, then dropping in bits of cold butter until mixed in. I poured in about a cup of milk to form a perfect dough. Make sure not to overmix or it might make the dough tough though.

I used the mix as a starting point for drop biscuits.  Added another Tbs of butter then 1 cup of buttermilk.  Just mixed by hand until combined.  After the biscuits were baked I brushed them with butter that was infused with garlic and butter.

This worked well to substitute for the Bisquick mix in an Immpossibly Easy pie recipe.

Thank you for this recipe!  I needed a substitute for my chicken pie when I realized I was out of Bisquick!  This turned out great.

I used this homemade Bisquik mix for the Cheddar Bay Biscuits from this website. It worked very well, and the biscuits are delicious! I have some mix left over and hope to make some breakfast biscuits with them soon!

I thought I was going to have to go to the store to buy Bisquick until I saw this recipe. I had all the ingredients in the house to make this. I used canola oil instead of butter as I did not have a pastry cutter to mix it in with. My milk was sour so I used Almond milk instead.I used the Bisquick substitute to make topping on an Impossible Chicken Pot Pie. It seemed to work okay, the only thing is, I think I cooked it too long, the top was dried out. Will use again but watch the time better next time. Nice that it makes a smaller quantity at a time so you can make it fresh each time you use it.
Revision: Just noticed recipe does not call for milk. I must have used it for something else.

Great!  Made the best fluffy pancakes this morning with this mix!  I followed the recipe exactly and then used it to make my pancake recipe.  Thank you for saving our sleepover breakfast!

I love this because it’s a great recipe that works perfectly as a Bisquick substitute, and it’s a reasonable quantity. All other biscuit mix recipes make a large amount.
