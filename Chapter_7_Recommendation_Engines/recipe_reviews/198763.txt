I followed the recipe as close as I could, only using regular clover honey in place of the avocado honey and 1% milk in place of the soy. I also quadrupled the recipe. Good thing because both my kids and I enjoyed it. I served it with a float of milk and a little maple syrup on top.

This is delicious!  I made mine in the microwave (about 4 min. on high, stirring at 1 min. intervals).  I used cow's milk for hubby's and soy milk for mine.  I used regular honey (stirred about 1 tsp. into the oatmeal and drizzled 1 tsp. on top) - it's a wonderful accompaniment to the pumkin and oatmeal.  We enjoyed this on a cold fall morning.  It's a great and healthy way to use up leftover pumpkin from your baking!

I wanted to apply store oatmeal ethics an subbed water for milk, didn't add walnuts, an added as lil sugar as possible, hoping to replace with more cinnamon, spices, and extracts. OMG when I added that [[immatation]] maple extract, down the sink it went. GAAAGGGGG. Please stick to the recipe. ~~I give it a five cause everyone else has had nothing but good to say about it an don't want to hurt the star rating. Just wanted to advise against such mods.!! Thank you for sharing

Oh my!  This was very good and a perfect way to start the day.  I opted to use skim milk and regular honey.  I also subbed pumpkin pie spice for the cinnamon and added a bit of vanilla.  In addition to the walnuts over top I added some raisins and dried cranberries.  Great recipe!

This is simply great! I got a can of canned pumpkin from my food bank and didn't know what to do with it, outside of the typical stuff. I also didn't want to buy anything extra just to use this up and I didn't!  The only suggestion my husband could come up with was add some salt.  I wasn't able to buy vanilla silk, but I plan to do so soon. Thanks for a great new way to make oatmeal.

Yum.  Made with vanilla soy milk, pumpkin pie spice (instead of just cinnamon) and used splenda instead of the honey.  Can't believe how creamy the pumpkin makes it!

I used skim milk and regular honey. I did add a few packets of splenda to sweeten it up a bit.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Pretty good!  I wasn't a fan of the honey in it so I used agave.  Another day I wanted the sweetness of sugar, lol.. so I used a packet of Truvia.  I can eat this everyday for breakfast!

I love this recipe. My suggestions: 1. Use vanilla soy milk. It adds a nice mild sweetness, which makes it delicious but not overwhelmingly sweet. 2. Add a lot of pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon. 3. Top with whipped cream!

This was a nice change to regular oatmeal. I had to change some things based on what I had. I used 2% milk, and regular honey. I also used extra cinnamon and stirred in a little vanilla at the end of cooking. Topped with chopped walnuts, diced dried cranberries and a little bit of brown sugar. Thanks for the recipe!

Nice recipe.  We left off the honey (reducing sugar early in the morning) and the walnuts (I'm allergic to them raw and was too lazy to toast them).  It was still a good recipe but I could see the honey and walnuts taking it right over the top.  I also used regular milk and banana squash puree.

I have actually been eating similar oatmeal several times a week, except I use almond milk and use butternut squash and a packet of stevia. Excellent, healthy and delish pre-workout carbs!

I make this recipe often.  However, I use 1% milk, which increases the protein in this hearty breakfast, and I use 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon.  It's satisfying, so I don't get hungry until noon.

Deelish. Do not try adapting for prep in the microwave as I did on my second attempt- it just kills the flavours.

Wonderful!  The only thing I did different was add 2T sugar to sweeten.  I loved this, my husband loved this, and my two little boys loved this!  What a nice, warm way to wake up on a cool winter morning!

Wow this was great! I was looking to use up an open can of pumpkin. I used vanilla almond milk so I left out the honey because the milk has cane sugar. I added raisins which I think is what made this recipe 5 stars. I used pumpkin spice too. What a great breakfast! Very filling too!

I thought this tasted good. The texture wasn't exactly what I prefer. It seemed like more liquid than I normally use. However, the ingredients are very healthy. I did use low-fat milk instead of soy milk. I made it because I accidentally bought pumpkin pie filling, instead of pureed pumpkin, and was looking for recipes to use it in. So, I left out the cinnamon and honey as the pumpkin filling already has sweeteners and seasonings.

This was okay- just what I expected. With so little sugar, the pumpkin or spices couldn't be tasted. To have lots of favor, more sugar is probably needed (which defeats the purpose).

I really enjoyed this recipe. We modified with regular milk, fresh pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spice (instead of cinnamon), and clover honey... but it was delicious. 

I have since multiplied the recipe x 10 and put it in the fridge for the kids' morning/afternoon snack. It keeps my workload down.

Thanks for sharing!

A great idea for a filling and healthy breakfast.  The recipe could use a bit of a flavor boost so I used a few sprinkles of nutmeg, ginger, and cloves along w/the cinnamon.  I think toasting the walnuts would also help.  Didn't have avocado honey so I used regular clover honey and didn't really notice it.  This is a great base recipe to tweak to individual tastes

LOVE this oatmeal! My husband doesn't like oatmeal, but he really loved this. I followed the recipe to the letter, but I used goat milk instead of soy milk. I also added a touch more honey, I think only because most soy milk is sweetened, so I didn't have the added sweetness from the soy milk. So delicious and healthy, it tastes indulgent but it's not!

This was ok, it was a little bland though, and I didn't care for the crunch of the nuts. Next time I will use Splenda, pumpkin pie spice, and leave the nuts out.

I used 2% milk and clover honey, and my daughter wouldn't touch it. I wasn't too impressed with it either. However, I found it's amazing with a good helping of cinnamon sugar thrown in.

I liked this recipe. Its also good with raisins in it if your out of walnuts. I just used regular honey because I didn't have avocado honey and I've done it with raisins or walnuts and like it either way.

This was delicious. I would definitely garnish with pecans and sweeten with pure maple syrup. I didn't try those because I was out of both, but they would definitely go with the taste. This is amazing; but I hope you like pumpkin.

This was okay.  Pumpkin has a lot of nutrients and my toddler seemed to like it.  (I added a little brown sugar instead of honey for him.)  I'll make this for him often.

My new favorite oatmeal recipe!! It is so warm, delicious, and filling. I can eat oatmeal only on weekends, and this is the one I've made for the past couple of weekends. I used 1/2 the milk called for because I normally soak my oats overnight so they already have some liquid in them. Other than that, the changes I made were to use coconut milk in place of soy, and clover honey in place of avocado. Thanks for sharing!!

This is delicious and wholesome. I left out the honey, since the soy milk I used was already sweetened and used pumpkin seeds instead of walnuts, which I'm not a fan of.

Tweaked this recipe a bit -- used 2% milk instead of soy milk and puréed fresh pumpkin. Sweetened with maple syrup and brown sugar. It was ok.

I found it to be really bland. I hardly taste the pumpkin at all. Next time I'm going to use pumpkin pie spice and almond milk.. But it is very healthy for you and that's a plus!!

I have an over-abundance of frozen pumpkin in my freezer from this years halloween, so I'm trying to find some creative uses for it. I stumbled upon your recipe and it sounded amazing. I made this for my son and I last week and again on Sunday for my husband as well and he loved it too! This is a keeper that's sure to warm you up and keep you full for a very long time... I forgot to mention that it also tastes great! Thanks for sharing!

For those of you who found this bland, I make a similar breakfast with stone cut oatmeal, making enough for the week in a big pan.  Follow the directions on the box for # of servings, and then add pumpkin pie spice, sweetener & cinnamon, and a little nutmeg and ground cloves, all acc/taste.  It's to die for!

Great recipe! If you like pumpkin you will love this!  For my taste I changed it slightly; and for 2-3 servings.  I put the stove on med-low heat and then put 1/2cup soymilk, 1/2cup whole milk, and then about 1 1/4 cup pumkin puree. Mixed all together, so there were no lumps, then added about 1/2 tsp. of pumkin pie spice and about 2 tsp. cinnamon.  stirred about a Tbsp of molasses and honey.  Then added the oats, mix was almost to a simmer. Turn up the heat to about med. I added about a 1/4cup of water, but i live in a dry climate so this may not be necessary. Cover for part of cooking so it will cook faster. cook until desired texture. Put in bowl and add more honey (brown sugar would probably be really good!) and walnuts if desired. Thanks for the Great recipe!

I used 2% milk instead of almond milk, which gave the oatmeal a very creamy texture- delicious!! Also went a little heavier on the cinnamon and added a dash of nutmeg and cloves as well. It wasn't bland, nor overpowering... just right.

Doubled the recipe. Used unsweetened coconut almond milk, doubled the pumpkin, added small scoop vanilla protein powder, 2TBSP each coconut oil and ground flax, a dash of ground ginger, cloves, nutmeg with the cinnamon, and pecans instead of walnuts. I also used some stevia in place of some of the honey. Also added raisins to my husband’s portion. He said it was delicious.

I used whole milk and maple syrup instead of honey. It's creamy, not overly sweet, and has a subtle pumpkin taste. I also added a little maple syrup to the top before eating.  It was great!

This was good. Used steel cut oats (quick ones) and also decided to use water. This could benefit from a dash of salt and maybe some additional spices such as nutmeg. I don't have avocado honey, so just used the regular honey I have. Will probably make this again. Thanks!

Very good! I scaled this down to one  serving and still could not finish it because it was a lot. I used pumpkin pie spice in place of the cinnamon.  I tasted it while it was cooking, and added a little regular honey because it definitely needed some sweetness. I topped it with maple syrup and the chopped walnuts. Very comforting on a cold morning!

Hands down, the best oatmeal I've ever had. Made it with stuff on hand....easy vegan or gluten free if needed. 
I sub'd maple syrup for honey, added sliced banana (really good), and up'd the cinnamon a bit. One pan meal in 10 min! Delish!
(Oh, I drizzled whipping cream in my bowl...like pumpkin pie at that point.)

I love anything pumpkin pie, so when I made this (x6, to have leftovers for tomorrow) I added all the spices in pumpkin pie blend- about 1tsp ground ginger, 1 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1TB cinnamon, 1/8 tsp ground cloves, and pinch of allspice. Instead of soy milk I used organic nonfat milk powder, to help thicken it up, and a little maple syrup. Fantastic! Even my husband who HATES oatmeal tried it. And then had a few more bites! He actually liked this. Thanks for sharing.

I made this for my 4 year old and I for breakfast. It was good but made it even better adding a little brown sugar! It was a great way to use up my pumpkin from another recipe left over.

This oatmeal was so yummy!! I used skim milk and regular honey because that's what I had on hand. So simple and easy to make

Had this in my recipe box and finally got around to getting some canned pumpkin. Made it for dinner tonight. Definitely a nice spin on plain old oatmeal for pumpkin lovers!

This was yummy and comforting. To enhance the pumpkin, I added a generous amount of cinnamon and ground cloves on top, then drizzled maple syrup instead of honey. Great start to the day!

Good. But I don't like honey that much. I prefer  topping it with Pumpkin Spice coffee Creamer  and sunflower seeds.

This was rich and creamy and really tasty, especially on a chilly morning!  That said, I must add that I used regular milk (we don't drink soy milk), regular honey, pecans instead of walnuts... personal preference, but was really tasty and used Pumpkin Pie Spice mixture instead of just cinnamon.  Also, amount of honey was not sweet enough for me, so I added more (I have a sweet tongue).  Next time I might try a sprinkle of brown sugar and/or fresh maple syrup!  Was skeptical about this, but it turned out great, will make many, many times again.

Creamy, pumpkin pie flavor!  I used 1% milk and pumpkin pie spice then topped it with a sprinkle of brown sugar and splash of half and half.  It was delicious!  I'll be having this for breakfast a lot this Fall.

I love pumpkin so I was excited to try this recipe.  Be warned that it has a very strong pumpkin flavor and quite bland.  We like our oatmeal with a little more sweetness so I doctored it up with some maple syrup and brown sugar (not as healthy but definitely needed it in order for it to be eaten in our house!).  Next time I will add less pumpkin.

This is a good change for oatmeal, and I love getting a vegetable at breakfast.  I didn't have nuts, used raw honey and 1% milk, loaded on the cinnamon, added a few dashes of cloves and ground some fresh nutmeg.  It's not fall-over amazing, but I liked it and will make it occasionally, especially when I have pumpkin left over from another recipe.

I used regular skim milk and brown sugar instead of honey, this was great and hearty enough for dinner. I love pumpkin and make everything I can with it - I would have never thought to do this though. Thank you!

This is wonderful! I too just used regular honey and almond milk instead of soy milk. Wonderful fall flavor:)
