It looks like a big pancake.  I followed the directions to a tee - but when I tried to cut the 10 wedges it fell into a dozen pieces..... I haven't tasted it yet, but it sure doesn't look like the picture - in which the base looks like one solid piece, not the "crumb mixture called for!!!!  I am sorely disappointed - planned to serve it to my church group in the morning, but don't think so now.
