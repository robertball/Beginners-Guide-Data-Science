I have been making this recipe for literally years - my family loves it!  We call them "Chicken Squares".  I don't use the pimentos or the croutons.  After putting the chicken mixture in the middle of the crescent rectangle, I just fold the sides flat up over the top and gently pinch closed to make a little packet.  I used to twist the sides together on top as originally listed, and had problems with it staying "doughy" in the center of the twist - you nearly have to overcook them to get it done that way.  Most of the time I omit the butter on top of the crescent rolls and no one has ever noticed the difference.  I do use Cavender's Greek Seasoning in the chicken mixture, and I think that is the secret to a really spectacular recipe. It's definitely a keeper and a standard in my recipe file!  :o)

Like another reviewer I used muffin tins to make this dish.  I used 10 oz canned chicken, 4 oz cream cheese, and 2 Tablespoons of diced Roasted red bell pepper.  I also needed two packs of crescent rolls and put a heaping tablespoon inside each triangle.  Sealed them anyway they would and topped with the melted butter and roasted garlic flavored breadcrumbs.  They're pretty and easy to handle in the muffin tin method.  350 degrees for about 17-20 minutes worked for me.

This recipe is so yummy and super easy to make! I usually use 4 oz. cream cheese instead of 3 oz. just because my boyfriend and I love cream cheese.  I also do not use the pimento or brush the crescent tops with butter and sprinkle with croutons but they still turn out delicious.  One suggestion I do have is to season the chicken a bit while cooking.  I usually poach the chicken in chicken broth and season with salt, pepper and a little of Emeril's original essence spice just to give it a bit more flavor.  Also, do not let the crescent rolls sit out too long as you prepare the chicken.  I found that it makes the dough too soft and when you go to wrap the chicken mixture it tears much easier.  Keep the dough chilled until you are ready to use.

HELPFUL TIPS ON FOLDING! I posted a picture of how I fold them, and I never have any issues with some of it not cooking like others did.  Basically fold two longest sides up until they meet & pinch together.  Then fold up and over the short sides (1/4th of the way) ...pinch, then flip over the entire crescent so the folded side is on cookie sheet (again, see pic)!  Also, without a doubt... TWO crescent rolls are needed to complete these, making a total of 8.  I find it a lot easier to use my largest cookie scoop 1/4C so they're consistent and it's exactly the amount of mix this makes!!  Due to recommendations, I found a few T of red peppers and a handful of almond accents (sliced FLAVORED almonds in the salad section) make this taste wonderful w/a nice crunch.  Breadcrumbs instead of croutons taste terrible as a substitute, so don't do it! Also, using generic crescents make this not turn out the same.

YUMMY!!  I used canned chicken and it was still incredible.  For those of you who thougt it was "too bland", try this......make your normal "favorite" chicken salad, but use the 3 oz. cream cheese instead of mayo......then follow the recipe.  It's so good.  I added celery, red onion, and apple pieces.  This was so great......definately an easy favorite I will make again and again.  Oh, and I sprinkled w/Italian breadcrumbs instead of crushed cruotons

This was really quite good! I'd read some reviews that mentioned the filling was somewhat bland, so I cooked the chicken in a little butter, oil, and s&p, and when it was done, i sauteed the onions briefly in the pan juices/tasty brown bits. I also threw in a bit of garlic powder. The crushed croutons were a good addition (I'm sure bread crumbs work, but may not be as good), and they were a lot of fun to put together!

I have made these chicken bundles for years, and my family and guests LOVE them.
The filling can be made a day ahead and stored in the refrigerator reducing last minute prep time. I prefer to substitute chopped chives for the minced onion for a more delicate flavor.

Overall, this was a pretty tasty recipe. But, I did change a few things. After I put the chicken mixture in the middle of the rectangle I topped it with a tsp. or two of canned diced chiles and a sprinkle of cheddar cheese. I also took out the pimento since we don't care for them and I used an extra can of crescent rolls to cover the tops instead of folding the rectangle over. Very tasty and versatile recipe! Thanks!

My husband and I absolutely loved these.  I couldn't believe it when my 
husband kept saying how good they are, because he is a real "Beef" and potatoes kind of guy.

Delicious! I made some alterations.  I sauteed the raw chicken in some butter with a clove of minced garlic, 1/4 cup onion, half  of a roma tomato, and 1/4 cup chopped broccoli. Then I added it to the cream cheese, butter and milk mixture.  My husband said it tasted gourmet! 
(I also put some of the filling on sandwich bread cut up into small squares and toasted the squares in the oven. Great appetizers!)

Delicious! Hubby said "make this again!"  I didn't have pimento and I didn't add croutons.  I did saute the onions and equal amount of celery.  I will make it again.

I've made these twice, once without the pimentos and croutons and once with pimentos and fat free herb croutons. I definitely preferred the taste with the croutons -- we thought the filling didn't have much taste on it's own, but with the croutons, it tasted much better. Next time I make these I'll try adding some cheddar cheese or even slivered almonds.

I make this a few times a year, we double and freeze them. I add diced olives, green onions,& garlic. I also use seasoned bread crumb instead of crouton with parmesan cheese. I make a gravy of cream of chicken soup and 1 soup can of half-n-half, garlic salt and 1/4 cup parmesan cheese ( the powder stuff) it is loved by all .

I reduced the fat by doing half cream cheese and half light sour cream which turned out EXCELLENT.  It was still very creamy.  I also cooked the onion in the tablespoon of butter on the stove until it carmelized and it added a lot of flavor to the dish.  I also omitted the butter and croutons on top and sprinkled some garlic salt on which was also great.  I wouldn't change anything I did.

I have used a similar recipe for years, I use a tub of cream cheese with chives, 1/4 cup of butter/margarine, and a can of sliced mushrooms in mine.  Also I make a gravy with cream of chicken soup mixed with milk.  My kids always say this is their favorite dinner!

Very good.  Used a 10 oz. can of chicken, and omitted the milk because it seemed "thin" enough.

Very quick and easy base recipe. I did a twist on it and both my husband and my picky 2 yr old son gobbled them up.
To the filling I added onion powder instead of onions. I omitted the pementos and added pesto sauce (1 1/2 tsp) and I used purdue already cooked oven roasted chicken brest strips (diced). 
To the crust I used 2 packages of creasents and just made large triangles. After basting the butter on I sprinkled the tops with Mc Cormick's crusting blend (Italian herb and cheese). They smelled wonderful while I was baking them and tasted just as good as they smelled.

Made these little tasty "Treats 'n Eats" last night - YUMBO !!  The only change I made was dicing up a bunch of green onions instead of using minced - omitted the Pimentos and milk - then followed the "Folding and Flip" suggestion from Chef Joy's Aug 13, 2009 review - worked like a charm - oven temp and time right on perfect !!  After making these once and seeing how easy and fun they are - your mind just races thinking about all the other goodies you could stuff these with !!  Too Fun !! 
P.S....Leftover Thanksgiving Turkey works too !!!

Wow - the other pics are great. My crescent rolls would NOT work with me. I finally decided to put half crescent rolls in the bottom of an 11X17, top with chicken mixture & put the remaining rolls on top. Not sure why you put croutons on top. Didn't seem to go with crescent rolls to me. Good way to use up a beer butt chicken. Kids liked it & it was easy! Mom & dad gave it a 3 1/2.

I love these, so easy to make, so easy to make them your "own" recipe. My personal suggestion is to try them once with won ton wrappers instead of crescent rolls. Just fry them up in oil and they have a savory delicious crunch.

Sometimes a recipe is like a movie - you hear rave reviews and your expectations are so high that it would be impossible to live up to them.  I think that might play a part here for me.  I really didn't care for this recipe but gave it 4 stars just because it has potential and I think some of the reasons I didn't like it were because of the modifications I made.  I used canned chicken as some reviewers suggested for convienence and that was my biggest mistake.  It turned mushy and I have to agree with one reviewer that the taste and texture was too much like tuna fish-yuck in this recipe. It definately needs fresh chicken breast or rotissarie chicken to make it right.  I also seasoned it much more than the original recipe called for since many reviewers commented that it was bland and our family likes lots of flavor.  But it was still really blah even after adding more onion, celery seed, garlic, roasted red peppers (instead of pimentoes), thyme & cheddar cheese on top of the filling.  The others having dinner with us agreed that it was "OK" but I didn't see anyone going back for seconds.  Everyone agreed that a filling of chicken/bacon/ranch or ham/cheddar/broccoli would be much tastier.  So not a total disaster and something I will try again with a lot of modifications. I definately recommend using a muffin tin to bake them in and to use the crushed croutons.  The muffin tin allowed me to make them very attractive and the croutons gave it a little more flavor and texture.

My family loves this; it is quick, easy, and yummy, and along with a salad or some steamed veggies, makes a great meal!  I usually use a store-bought rotisserie chicken for this- it's a time saver and tastes a lot better than the canned stuff!

Absolutely delicious! I don't really care for pimento's but I used them anyway. I have to admit they really added a good flavor to these sandwiches. I made the recipe exactly as written and everything was wonderful. I'll be making this one again and again.

These pocket sandwiches were o.k., but next time I will use my chicken salad recipe and see how that turns out.  I might try adding more veggies to the chicken mixture too. We'll see which one turns out better.  In my opinion, this recipe was just a little too bland and kind of dry.

We really loved these!  Due to the previous reviews of being a little bland I did the following:
sauted 1/2 of a sweet onion with the one TBSP of butter then added one clove of chopped garlic.  While still warm added the cream cheese and milk, after blended added a little onion powder and mild curry (about a dash) along with the salt and pepper.  Then added about 1/4 slivered almonds, 1/2 cup frozen peas and 1/2 cup frozen corn and the chicken.  Used 2 crescents (triangles) side by side (how they come out of pkg) to form a rectangle, added about 2 rounded TBSPs of chx mixture. I then folded middle up and then the sides, pressed each opening with a fork.  Cooked on parchment on top of a pizza stone.  Did this only b/c mine didn't stay completely sealed and didn't want to end up with a mess all on my pizza stone.  Even with the various holes, they cooked perfectly and really not much of the filling came out.  I thought they might end up dry due to all the veggies I added but it was perfect, not overly juicy but moist enough.  I had enough filling to use 2 cans of crescent rolls.  Will definitely make again!

These were excellent little hot sandwiches! I used the regular sized crescent rolls, and dried minced onion. 3 boneless breasts yielded 2 cups chopped meat. I cooked the chicken in 3 cups water and 3 cubes chicken bouillon plus half an onion and some celery tops for about 30 minutes then let it cool before chopping. The crushed croutons made a nice crunch on top and I wouldn't leave them off. I used seasoned croutons. These would be perfect for a luncheon or party as well. Great recipe, we liked this one. Thanks!

Very good!  I only had about 1 1/4 C chicken, so I added about 3/4 C raw chopped brocolli.  I also added a small can of diced green chilis instead of pimento and used sweet onion.  On the top I used Marie Callendars garlic butter croutons - they really enhanced these!  I used reduced-fat crescent rolls by Pillsbury and reduced-fat cream cheese.  Loved the flavor!  What a super way to use left-over rotisserie chicken!

This is a very family friendly recipe.  All of my kids loved it!!  Next time I might add some garlic or garlic salt to the mixture.  Also, I did not have any crutons so I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs instead.  I even used Neufchatel cheese (low fat cream cheese) and low fat crescent rolls.  This recipe is going to be a keeper!!

Great recipe!! Easy, too. I made up the chicken mixture the night before, then put it all together in the bundles the next day to bake before my luncheon. Easy and fast!

My mother made this for me growing up, and I have made this for years.  We don't serve it as a sandwich- we serve as a dinner with a sauce made from one can of cream of chicken soup mixed with one cup of Sour Cream.  Heat this up and spoon over.  Makes a wonderful addition and adds moisture to the dish.

Added 1/2 tsp Greek Seasoning as suggested by another reviewer. Used bread crumbs instead of crushed croutons which is essentially same thing without the work. Delicious. We loved it. Will make it again. My husband said it looked "beautiful" bc of the bread crumb topping.

So good and SO EASY!  The only issues I had were the dough popping open when trying to make the bundles, but once they were cooked it didn't seem to matter.   Also - instead of 1/2 cup chicken mixture use 1/3 cup.  There isn't enough of the filling to use a 1/2 cup in each, but 1/3 cup was perfect.  Thanks for sharing!

I love this dish but I make it a little differently. I leave out the pimiento and onion and add some (about 1/2 can) cream of chicken soup (undiluted). And (to make things simple), I just buy a rotisserie chicken at the grocery store and shred it. A little expensive maybe, but worth it because it cuts down on prep time.

This was a good recipe, although I too changed some things, after reading other reviews. I made it very similar to chicken salad, except I used thanksgiving turkey leftovers, 4oz cream cheese instead of mayo, and I omitted all other spices except for 1 tsp celery salt. I also diced up a couple mushrooms and through those in. It was very delicious as I prepared it, and I omitted the croutons and cooked for 22 minutes.

These were good, but a little dry.  I also had trouble keeping the four corners pinched together.  A little to time consuming for me to try again.

This was one of the first recipes I ever followed close to 30 years ago, I made it for my parents and sisters. It came from a Pillsbury bake-off cookbook. I use dried, seasoned bread crumbs in place of the croutons just because it is easier. I just made these last week and they are as good as ever. Thanks for bringing back an old favorite. I have made these with canned, drained albacore tuna and adding dried dill weed also.

The crescent roll part was great.  I think it just needs a few modifications.  I shredded the chicken which doesn't add anything to the recipe, I was just being lazy.  It needs more spices inside too.

Make this recipe frequently and always love it.  Heads up though, don't use the store brand crescent rolls, they will give you a lot of trouble.

Someone told me about these sandwhiches a long time ago so I have been making my own version w/out a recipe so I was excited to find this one! The minced onion is a great addition. I just wanted to make one suggestion to those who thought these sandwhiches are bland: slow cook the chicken in chicken broth, pepper, onion powder, garlic, etc. Whatever seasonings you like.  This helps add flavor to the blandness of the cream cheese. These also freeze well so you can make extras for those busy nights. Also, great to take with when you need to pack lunches for the day. (My kids get tired of PB&J) Enjoy!

Good but not great. Used the muffin tins and needed 2 things of crescent rolls. Added paprika, cayenne and instead of pimento used roasted bell peppers.

I wanted a recipe where you could easily use cooked chicken. My family gobbled this up. I followed the recipe exactly, except I added garlic powder. I did use muffin tins lightly greased. Next time I thought it would be nice to add broccoli and/or red pepper.

Yummy.  We call them Crescent Squares. These are so good this time of year.  I too omit the pimentos,croutons and additional butter. But, I use about 1/4 of a large onion, chopped.  Nothing better than cream cheese, chicken, butter and onions.  I ALWAYS use Pillsbury brand also.  Store brand crescent rolls just don't get it with these lovely squares.  My family likes a thin chicken gravy over these.  I use a bit of chicken broth and my favorite cream soup.  Like Cream of chicken or even Cream of Mushroom, thinned with some broth.  Use as much as you like to make it thick or thin. These are very filling.  Even my 17 yr old can usually only eat one!  This one's a keeper.

I have been making this recipe for years!  I was actually stunned when I saw it on the allrecipes website.  We leave out the pimentos and add sauteed mushrooms that we put into the food processor.  Delicious!  One recommendation, I let the butter and cream cheese get to room temperature and cream them together in a mixer and then I add all the rest of the items to make the mixture.

Added bacon and green chiles.  Next time I will substitute the chicken for sausage.  Tasty, but very rich.

I made it without the onion or peppers because of my picky 2 and 6 year old sons.  They LOVED this meal and so did I!  They ate every last bite.  I love this recipe and will be adding it to my list of "good recipes".

We love it! I've had it with and without the pimentos; and it's always fabulous! I add lots of different spices each time and am never dissappointed with this dish. It looks like I slaved away over this fancy meal when in reality I'm just using leftovers!

WOW ** WOW ** WOW **

I had these delectible little "chicken puffs" at a wedding last month and have been searching for something like it.  (Theirs were smaller like horderves) These are so wonderful and really not that difficult to make.  I used roasted chicken from the deli, dehydrated mushrooms & chives I had on hand, and a whole onion (mushrooms, chives & onions cooked in butter) Mixed it up with the cream cheese & salt & pepper. They were just great.  I am glad they were bigger to make me realize portion control.  If I had made puffs I would have just popped them all in my mouth I am sure.  Five Stars!!  (Although, They are very rich)
*********note***   I ate the leftovers cold the next day and it was a whole different taste.  Very Good.

I cut back on the minced onion per other reviews and I completely forgot to buy pimentos so I added a little tabasco sauce to the mix. A nice, quick filling recipe. Oh and instead of croutons I used italian seasoned bread crumbs.  Hubby liked them a lot, said it reminded of a quick pot pie!  Thank you for sharing the recipe Sandy!

My family did not care for the taste and I thought it was a little bland (even after adding garlic).

very good - next time i'll add another T of milk.  i used the single sheet of crescent dough and cut it in half and put half of the chicken mixture on each sheet then over-lapped the sides & pinched the ends together.  baked seem side down.  perfect - no leaks and easy to assemble.

I liked it; my family, less so, complaining it was too bland. I'll make this again, but next time I'll experiment with replacing the cream cheese with one of the Philly flavored cooking cremes.

I've been making a version of this recipe for 20 years.  I use more cream cheese (at least 6 oz. for the amount of chicken used) and chopped chives.  No pimentos, and no onion (and I love onion).  The chives give a slight onion taste.  There is no need for the extra croutons or butter.  I also use my baking stone to bake the little chicken packets.  You can use reduced-fat crescent rolls, but the flavor is not quite as good.  My grown kids still get excited when we have Chicken Packets!

I have been making this for years and it a family/friend favorite.  However, I do add a cucumber sauce on the side that really adds to the flavor.  It is made with chopped cukes, sour cream and dill! Try it and you'll like it! Yummy!!

I've been making a slightly different version of this for years.  Chicken squares.    I use shredded chicken that I roasted from two bone in chicken breasts seasoned with salt and pepper.  Or you could use a store bought rotisserie chicken.  I also make a delicious sauce of cream of mushroom and sour cream to pout over.  It really adds what this recipe is missing.  Yummy.  Have fun with your creations.

These were very delicious! I added chopped celery and mushrooms to the mix, used italian breadcrumbs instead of croutons, left out the pimentos, added a little garlic powder, and used canned chicken. I was a bit nervous about using canned chicken since I had never used it before, but it actually tasted very good!

It was quick and easy, the crescent dough was a little difficult at first, but after reducing the amount I put in each pocket, it was better. I did have some leftover mixture though, so I could probably have used a can and a half of dough. I may have had more chicken than called for though. (I used one big breast that I fried in a skillet) The flavor was ok, I added some seasoning to the chicken breast, cooking it with little pieces of broccoli, and sprinkling it with cheddar cheese before baking, but that didn't make a huge difference. I might try this with different fillings. Also, I slightly undercooked the dough, it was a little gooey inside, so watch that. it was good, just not fantastic with this particular filling. (Maybe it was the cream cheese?) Again, I may try it with something else, do like a chicken cordon bleu type thing. Oh and they didn't drip a bit, I put them on a cookie sheet without greasing it or anything and one of them had a big hole in the top and didn't leak, but still warm and moist inside, so it is worth a try, it might be to your preference!

Seeing this recipe made me laugh (in a good way)  We made these in my Home Economics class in 10th grade (17 years ago)  We didn't add pimentos or croutons though.  These are very good!!!

This is probably one of my favorite meals I've ever made.  I use everything low fat - Neufchatel cheese, reduced fat crescent rolls, margarine, not butter, skim milk - and it tastes great.  Instead of pimento peppers, I chop up 2 stalks of green onions, and add in about a tsp of dried basil.  Really good!

This was really great. I made some modifications to suit our preferences. I used 4oz of cream cheese, the pimentos, and about 2tbsp of roasted red peppers.  I also added a cam of cream of mushroom soup with roasted garlic. I boiled 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts in chicken stock with minced garlic. Once the chicken is cooled, I shreadded and added to cream cheese mixture, and let the flavors marry for an hour and half in the fridge. My husband wanted to make a sandwich out of the chicken cheese mixture before I even had a chance to cook it all in the crescents. I only sprinkled the tops with grated fresh parmesan cheese. Everyone loved these, and we paired them with the Spicy Mustard roasted red potatoes on this site. Thanks for a great base recipe.

This was so good my husband ate my 4 year old daughter's leftovers and tried to "reserve" my 7 month old daughter's biscuit for himself!!! The second time I made this, I doubled the cream cheese and decreased the milk by half. ***UPDATE*** The third time around, I added some garlic powder and onion powder. Also, I made my own croutons with bread, butter, onion powder, garlic powder, parsley, oregano, and a little bit of basil.

This was wonderful! I added bacon and 1/4 cup of feta cheese to stuffing...put in 1/8 cup of minced onion which is a bit more than the reciepe. 86ed the croutons and put shredded cheese on top of croissants. Used Three breasts of chicken and three croissant tubes which ended up making 6 large pockets of delicious goodness!!! oh also sauteed the chicken in olive oil and garlic. with larger pockets cook time is cut to around 24 minutes.  With a bit of marinara on the side...talk about the perfect comfort food!!

I added bacon pieces and chives instead of an onion, but this was still very bland, especially considering how many calories there are.  It definitely needs more flavor, but the idea is good... maybe herbed cream cheese?  Ranch dressing?  I'm not sure, but it was definitely missing something.

I've actually been making this recipe for years.  The recipe I have calls for turkey instead of chicken (which is great for Thanksgiving leftovers).  Instead of using onion, I omit the onion and use chive cream cheese.  I also add a little garlic powder.  They come out great!

Delicious.  The only thing I changed was that I used reduced fat cream cheese.  Still turned out wonderful and you couldn't tell the difference.  I also didn't put the croutons on top.  Wonderful and great reviews from my kids too.  Thanks for the recipe.

Easy. Salt, peppered, and added paprika to the shredded cooked chicken before mixing with the rest of the called-for ingredients. Skipped the croutons and pimientos. Perfect for dinner parties - everyone gets their own! I thought there may be too much bread, though, and might roll out the dough a bit next time and make more "dumplings."

Although I think this is a great idea...it didn't really work for us.  We just thought it was ok.  Had hubby's friend for dinner and he eats anything (usually goes for seconds or thirds because he is single and doesn't get home cookin all too often) and he only ate 1.  He said it was ok.  It looked great, but not for us.  Thanks anyway for the post.

It is very good - my husband LOVES these. cooking the chicken and cutting takes awhile - if have canned shredded chicken it's much easier.  i don't bother with the croutons - they fall off.  i think it's a lot of work for a 5 star, but it's the day after christmas and i'm worn out - haha.  oh yea - these really don't refridgerate well - get all mushy - need to be baked right before eating...

This was good, but not something I would make often.  I found it easier to just fold the ends of the rectangles over and then squeeze the sides shut.
***UPDATE: I tried these again, but this time I added mild cheddar cheese, white corn and bacon.  I also seasoned my chicken with plenty of garlic, Lawry's and pepper.  This time, we were Wowed!  My husband insisted it was the best stuff he had ever put in his mouth!

Wow! These are terrific. I made them smaller (using only one crescent each) because I was taking them for a pot luck. I put some heated cream of chicken soup in a small pitcher on the side for topping. They went like hotcakes!!

I double the recipe and use 1 carton cream cheese with chives and onions. I still add the other onion and the chives. I also add 1 stick of celery diced very fine. I dip mine in melted butter and then seasoned bread crumbs. I also make a sauce with 1 can cream of chicken soup with herbs and 1/2 can milk. That is enough for a single recipe. I have also made it with puff pastry.

Wow - this was a real winner with my family - even the kids raved!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and it was extremely easy and tasty - sort of like a creamy chicken baked in dough.  I used Tyson roasted chicken strips (already cooked), and did not use the optional pimento - and it was very yummy.  Many requests to make it again!!!

Very good, but made several modifications.  2 TBSP milk makes the mixture too runny - cut it down to 1 TBSP.  Also added some minced garlic for extra flavor.  A crowd pleaser.

These were super-de-duper! I cooked 3 boneless breasts in my crockpot and then tossed them into the food processer and the consistency was perfect. Instead of topping with croutons, I used crushed Ritz crackers. Wonderful!

This is a great (and easy) way to use up that leftover chicken.  After reading over the reviews I decided to modify the recipe by adding a 4oz can of diced green chilies and increasing the cream cheese to 4oz.  The result was wonderful - my husband and I both thought it was very tasty.

Great, easy recipe.  I have modified it some, I use a little extra cream cheese and diced chilli peppers in place of the pimentos.  I have served this to many guests and always get rave reviews.  A great midweek supper.

This would have been much better if I had just made chicken salad and packaged it in the crescent rolls.  I found that the cream cheese didn't give the chicken enough tang or flavor.  It's an excellent concept, though!  - Allison

This was very good.  I would suggest going light on the salt while preparing.  Salt afterwards.  The minced onion made it very salty. (Especially if you use the spice instead of fresh).  It was very, very good though.  A keeper

Filling was wonderful. However should have rolled out crescents and used thinner ones for these. Too much roll to filling ratio. Originally only used 1 pkg crescents and made 4 large puffs with 1/4 of sheet or 2 triangles together.

Loved this! I made it twice within a week for two different groups, both of which were grunting in satisfaction when first tasting. I tried adding curry the second batch, and that made it even more amazing. Will absolutely be making this again.

It was great!  I sauteed my chicken with onions, garlic and peppers. I did not use the butter and crumbs on top.  Once I figured out how to do the bundles (I didn't twist the tops, I just pinched together) it was great! Will definitely make this again.

This is a great recipe that my husband's family has been making for years.  They don't use the pimentos and they heat 1 can of cream of mushroom soup to serve over the top after they are cooked.  Adds lots of flavor and acts as a gravy for them.

I've now tried this recipe once as written, and once modified. As-is they're very tasty, although maybe a little bland depending on what you use for breadcrumbs. The second time I left out the breadcrumbs entirely, based off of other reviews, and I also added a bit of rosemary. This recipe is a good one to experiment and make your own! I totally failed at doing the dumpling shape, though... I ended up making them look like little burritos, which worked just fine for us. For the burrito shape we cooked them for 15 minutes.

One thing that others should DEFINITELY take into account is that you will probably want two cans of crescent rolls. I used the default measurements of two cups of chicken, and that was enough for about six-ish bundles, and with two cans I used all of the filling perfectly.

This recipe is AMAZING!!!!  I had "other" items on hand, so I added bacon bits, cheese, shallot, roasted garlic, basil & parsley.  I didn't make NEAR enough!  (Everyone wanted more.)  Will keep this one in the rotation.

I have been making these for years - everyone LOVES them.  I have always used 'real' chicken and all I use is chicken, cream cheese (light) and hot pepper rings chopped up.  I simply put filling on the flattened crescent roll and pinch together on top.  They freeze very well.  To die for!!!!  -  Pat Baker

This recipe was so yummy! I used all reduced fat ingredients (crsecent rolls, cream cheese). I chopped up two organic chicken breasts, sauteed them with about 1/4 cup onion, and 1 garlic clove. Then, mixed with 3 oz recuced fat cream cheese, about 1/4 cup shredded smoked cheddar, 2 heaping tbsp diced pimentos. They were awesome! Next time, I think I might add some mushrooms and herbs in the mixture.

This was quick and easy to make. I followed the directions with the exception of the crushed crutons. It was delicious and the kids gobbled it up. The only thing that I would probably do differently is add additional stuffing to each pastry.

My family has made these for years as well, only we call them "Chicken Sweaters".  I don't use the pimentos either, but after I bake the chicken I use the drippings and seasonings from that, pour it in a pot, and saute the chopped onions in that. I add the cream cheese and melt that all in, then I add in the chopped, cooked chicken.  For a little extra flavor I add some dry ranch dip mix to the cream cheese mix.  I also use those crescent sheets now.  I roll one out a bit and cut into fourths.  Much easier to wrap up than having to pinch all the week spots in the crescent rolls.  Our family also makes a sort of "gravy" to pour over them with cream of chicken soup.  YUMMY!!

I have been making these for years, I think the original recipe was in one of those Pillsbury cookbooks.  My sister calls them "Chicken Dingers".  I use thyme or tarragon in the chicken filling.

I have also been making this for years and I also call them "Chicken Squares". I make them the same way except I have never used pimentos and I fold them into a square. I will try the pimentos to see if I like them that way. I have always made a chicken gravy to top them, so instead of them being a sandwich, they are more like a dinner. I have put chopped broccoli in them or mixed veggies too. I think the butter on top with the croutons are a must for the crunchy texture. These are so good!!!

I have made this for years- but I have cheated and simplified it as well. Perdue short cut chicken with cream cheese mixed in a bowl. ( used to add mushrooms but my kids dont like them). Place in crescent roll and make a little pouch. Brush with a little melted butter and sprinkle crushed croutons on top. Bake on parchment paper-

Try using cream cheese with chives and add garlic--fresh or powder along with some form of onion.  No need for the extra butter or milk. Either canned or cooked chicken breast works. Separate the crescent rolls and put a golf sized scoop on the wide end of each and roll up tucking the ends over to make a packet.  Cook as directed-- 350 for about 20 min and serve with white gravy.  They freeze well.  Delicious.

I made these tonight with a few changes. So good, kids loved them. I used onion and chive cream cheese and didn't brush butter or croutons on. I increased the amount of filling and had enough to make two crescent roll container worth. I also added some cheddar jack shredded cheese to the filling. Making again!

I cubed leftover cooked chicken thighs seasoned with salt and pepper, but because of the reviews stating this recipe was bland I also added 1 Tablespoon of curry powder and 1/2 teaspoon of tarragon to the cream cheese mixture before stirring the chicken in. Pretty tasty. The filling could be tweaked in any number of ways to make different flavors based on what you like. Easy and quick if you have leftover chicken.

I got this recipe from a friend over 30 years ago and it's a hit with everyone.  One of my family's alltime favorite meals.  However, the recipe I got includes a sauce to pour over them which I think makes it really good - otherwise too dry.  Just a can of Cream of Onion soup and some milk heated.  Use milk to whatever consistency you like. If you can't find Cream of Onion....cream of celery or cream of chicken work fine too. Delish!!!

These. Were. Absolutely. Delicious. I've made them 3x already this week. I didn't have canned chicken, so I just cut up and cooked some chicken breasts with garlic, onion, and poultry seasoning. I followed the recipe with a coupe modifications: add some chopped spinach and substituted the salt and pepper for about 1 Tbsp of powder ranch dressing mix. Thank you for the recipe, these are quick to prepare and taste superb!

This was the best-looking recipe on the site, although I was worried about all the comments saying the chicken filling wasn't savory enough.  So I erred on the side of caution and added a lot of seasonings: garlic salt, onion powder, pepper, cumin.  I was afraid it would be too much, but it wasn't!  
I also wanted to make more so I rolled up a small teaspoon of filling in individual rolls instead of  combining 2 rolls together.  A pack of crescent rolls made 8 puffs.  I also accidentally bought a pack of the "golden layer" rolls and was amazed that they actually peel apart so I could fill them and seal them back up together!  They worked just as well as the crescent rolls.  Quick and easy and the whole family loved them.

I have made this recipe many times and have passed it to many friends and family. I modify it by adding about 1T of milk instead of the butter. I leave out the pimento. After making the chicken pockets, I then roll them in chicken broth to save on calories or you can roll in melted butter then roll in bread crumbs. This is a dish!!!

Good stuff right here! I use "real" chicken cooked with a bit of salt, pepper and minced garlic. I always skip the peppers and add some frozen peas & carrots instead. Sometimes I also like to use shredded parmesan in place of the crutons. Definitely rich but they sure are tasty. Don't skimp on the cream cheese!

Delicious!!  I used 4 oz cream cheese and 2 cans of crescent rolls.  I rolled them individually so it made 16.  I did not use butter or crumbs on top as it did not need it!

I thought this was quite good.  What I really like about it is that it's very versatile.  I omitted the onions, pimentos and croutons.  I seasoned the chicken mixture with garlic, basil & parsley.  My whole family loved it.  If you already have cooked chicken on hand it makes for a very quick & easy weeknight meal with little cleanup.

It was superb.  Even my small kids loved it.  I didn't have pimento peppers, so I substituted diced green chili peppers and added chopped frozen spinach.  It was excellent.  Will definitely make again.  I used a muffin pan, it was so easy.  My huband was a glutton and had 4.  I didn't use croutons, milk or butter either as I thought it was fattening enough already.

When I look at a recipe and it has a 4+ rating, I figure it's gotta be pretty good.  This one was not up to expectations!  It was bland, even though I had added the extra onion and garlic powder....as well as the regular onion and some celery....Just nothing to write home about!  Wouldn't bother to do it again.

Family loved this.   Changes I made:  Sauted (1) gala apple, (2) celery stalks, and (1/2) onion in 2T butter.  Added this to the cream cheese/chicken mixture.  Left out the croutons, but sprinkled some italian breadcrumbs lightly over them.   Excellend!    Spread mixture out lengthwise, leaving about 3/4 inch at each end, seal the edges, then bring up short sides and seal them altogether.

Tasty! I did a little tweeking. I added some garlic powder, crushed pecans and a little more cream cheese (I'm really bad about measuring)Just tried to get a good consistency. I did leave out the pimento-person preference.

Yum! I use about 1.5 packages of crescent rolls, or else the filling is everywhere.

This was very bland.  I have a similar recipe in one of my cookbooks that adds 3/4 c. cream of chicken soup.  They have turned out well for us in the past.

A good base recipe that needs some tweaking.  I added broccoli florets, shredded cheddar cheese, garlic powder, and some italian seasoning.  I would like to try it with condensed cream of chicken soup instead of the cream cheese/butter combo.  Overall it was good.  Thanks for sharing!

These were so yummy.  When I went to make them, however, I realized I had run out of a few things, so I had to improvize.  I cooked the chicken with some salt, pepper, and garlic powder, then instead of onions (because I had somehow run out without noticing) I used part of a green pepper I had left over. I sauted that in the same pan as the chicken.  I also fried up four strips of bacon because bacon makes everything better.  When everything had cooled down I made the filling, adding about a tablespoon of French mustard and some shredded chedder to the mixture.  I found the the cresent rolls stretched really well over a large amount of filling, which was helpful. When they were all wrapped up (they didn't look as pretty as I would have liked, but not bad for the first time) I sprayed them with some butter and sprinkled them with Italian breadcrumbs as suggested in some other reviews.  When they came out they were so cheesy and delicious.  I will definately make them again.  I think this is a good recipe because I think these could be made in any number of ways and still be wonderful.  Thanks for the great recipe!

I always roast two chickens at a time to ensure that I have leftovers - and this was a delicious way of using up the chicken!  These were really tasty and very easy to make.  Rather than folding the dough inwards I used two crescant triangles on the bottom (to form a rectangle) and did the same for the top.  I added a caesar dressing (dry) mix along with extra garlic powder which really made them tasty.  I think you can probably add any favourite vegetable to the mix and would just enhance the whole meal. Will certainly be trying many variations of vegetables with this recipe.  Thanks!

This is a really good recipe because it leaves plenty of room to play with.  If you follow the recipe to a "T" it turns out great.  If you make alterations it still turns out great.  Usually I'm scared to alternate a recipe, but this one leaves plenty of room to play with.  Tonight I used 3 chicken breasts (baked and seasoned w/garlic salt and pepper).  I shredded the chicken and added it to the cream cheese butter mixture.  I sauteed a half of an onion and fresh garlic and put that into the chicken mixture.  I also added steamed broccoli and cheddar cheese to the mix which was a new thing.  I used 2 cans of cresent rolls to make big chicken pockets ( I got 4 chicken pockets out of 2 cans)and baked for 20 minutes at 350.  They were delicious and so easy to do!  Have fun with this recipe and don't be afraid to experiment!

So easy and everyone at my house liked it.    Next time I will make the filling more like chicken salad (apples, celery and onion).  Thanks to the reviewer who made that suggestion.  Didn't think they would be very pretty, but they turned out ok.  Not as good as some of the other pictures.  Kudos to the cooks who made them look so beautiful!  :)

I've been making these for years.  I usually use can chicken and it still taste great.  I don't use pimento though.  They are fast and inexpensive to prepare and they make a great presentation.

Better than I thought it would be.  It was actually pretty easy to make and will definitely make again, maybe adding bacon or peas to the mixture.

This was very tasty!  I baked chicken tenderloins with olive oil, sea salt and fresh ground pepper.  I also sauteed baby portobello mushrooms and diced them up, adding them to the filling mix.  Skipped the pimentos, doubled the cream cheese and threw in a handful of grated sharp cheddar.  Skipped the croutons and just brushed the rolls with melted butter.  These reminded me more of mini pot pies than sandwiches; my husband was in heaven.  Really rich & really good!

For a lighter recipe, I used ff cream cheese, skim milk, ff croutons, and brummel and brown instead of butter.  Diced chiles took the place of the pimentos, and it turned out delicious!

This was WAY too rich for me. Maybe if you were to cut the amount of cream cheese in half and add sour cream instead it would be better but I didn't care for this. Gave it a three because the two others eating said it was pretty good.

I'm not sure about the original recipe but with my revisions this was wonderful. After reading so many say that it could be bland I made a couple of adjustments. no croutons, pimentos, or milk. After shredding the chicken I put it in a skillet on low with 1/2 a can cream of chicken soup, the onions, and 1 tsp diced jalapenos. When that warmed up I added the butter and cream cheese to the mix. I then wrapped them up in the rectangles as the recipe says. I thought it was plenty. I only cooked them for 20 minutes. Everyone went back for seconds and I will deffinitely make this again.

This is a good base recipe. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe as submitted. The 2nd time I made them, I wanted to spice them up a little, so I added sliced mushrooms, diced jalapeno peppers, garlic and red pepper flakes. I omitted the pimentos and croutons. Worth trying, and adding your own touch to it.

The fiance scarfed these down, so between that and the fact that they were EASY, this definitely earns 5 stars. However, I will note that it's much easier to shape the bundles if the crescent dough is chilled. I very stupidly left mine on the cookie sheet too close to the preheated oven, so my chicken packets were functional, but uuuuugly.  :-) Thanks for a winner!

This recipe is almost identical to my mom-in-law's recipe. I made these last night, and I did add one thing. 1/4 cup of shredded Parmesean cheese to chicken mixture. It was VERY good!!! We love these:)!

This has potential. I added some spices but it was still a little bland. I love the concept and it is quite pretty, so I will add something maybe mushrooms, sundried tomatoes maybe and some Parmesan cheese. Thanks for the idea

These were super good. I took some advice of other reviewers, threw this and that in just guessing amounts. Chopped chicken breast, about 4 oz light cream cheese, a couple tblspns light sour cream, s&p, a bit of milk, a few broccoli florets and a few good sprinkles of grated parmesean cheese and mixed it all up. It made quite a bit of filling for 6 rectanglular pockets of yumminess. Like another reviewer, I found it was easier to fold it over and pinch the three sides together too. Oh also, make sure the dough is cold when you do this. We ate these with forks because they were soft. We want to try different styles, meats, sauces, cheeses and such. My boyfriend wants to try them with ham, eggs & cheese for breakfast. Thanks for this idea!

Fantastic! Like others, I put my crescent rolls in a muffin tin and used two packages. One package for the bottom, one for the top. I ended up with six FULL muffin-size crescents. I omitted the pimentos, and added about 1/3 cup of chopped water chestnuts, and about 1/3 cup of sauteed onions and garlic. They were delicous! This recipe is definitely a keeper!

These were really good and very rich.  Like others, I left out the pimentos and used bread crumbs instead of croutons. The filling kind of reminded me of a chicken version of crab rangoon.  I will definately make these again, maybe next time I will make them smaller by using just one crescent roll.

I thought these were pretty good. I omitted the croutons as I thought they were a bit much since the recipe already uses crescent rolls and didn't use the butter over the top - there was already enough fat in the rolls, I thought. Might try an egg-wash next time but I will be making these again. Served with Roasted Brussels Sprouts and Oven Roasted Potatoes from this site. Turned out great. Thanks!

I followed the recipe and made a few changes, I added some garlic powder, broccoli and cheddar cheese to the chicken mixture and it was absolutely delicious. My husband loved it. This is definitely a  meal I will make again!

This was SO good! I've been looking for a recipe like this! I didn't add the onion or pimento (don't like) but I did add onion powder, garlic salt and pepper instead. Also, instead of topping with crushed croutons I used Italian breadcrumbs. YUM! This recipe is a keeper! Thanks!

I've made a similar recipe to this before that used herbed brie cheese instead of cream cheese.  Both versions are very good and the preparation is wonderfully easy compared how fancy the results look.  I prefer green onion in place of the regular onion, and I always sprinkle rosemary on top instead of the crutons.  I also recommend the canned chicken if you are in a hurry.

Love these. Because we are sort of "dieting", I used lite margarine instead of butter in the mixture, light cream cheese and the low fat crescent rolls. Cooked the chicken in a pan sprayed with Pam,  with some diced garlic and chopped green onions, and threw the whole mixture into the food processor. I didn't brush them with butter, I gave each "bundle" a real short spray with butter flavored spray so the crumbs would stick on top. (oh I also threw a few drops of Red Hot sauce in the mixture because that just enhances the flavor of everything except pie):O) DELICIOUS. By the way, this also works great with tuna instead of chicken.

This was really good and easy. My husband loved it. I doubled it, using 8oz cream cheese and 2 packages of rolls. Used onion powder instead of minced onions. My kids liked that you can pick it up an eat it like a sandwich. A great easy meal. Thanks!

Quick, easy, delicious! I grilled the chicken on my Foreman, used chives instead of minced onion, and canned olives with jalapenos instead of pimento (that's what I had!), used garlic & cheese croutons (don't skip the croutons!), next time I will probably add about an ounce more cream cheese.

We have this every 2 weeks in my family. It is my husbands favorite.  I boil chicken breasts for 1 hour in chicken stock, carrots, celery and onion before putting it in the bowl with the cream cheese mixture.  I then shred the chicken in with the cream cheese. We use italian bread crumbs on top instead of croutons.  I always have a salad and veggies (beans or broccoli) on the side as well.

These are yummy, but VERY rich and very large.  I recommend making them smaller, using only the crescent triangles.

Yum! These were excellent. The taste was wonderful. And eating just one was very fulfilling. I didn't have the croutons, but they were still wonderful. I may add more pimento peppers next time, but that's because I really like the taste of them. I bought diced pimento peppers in a jar. These would be great to serve at a brunch or shower (wedding or baby). It doesn't take very long to make either.

These were the hit of the new year's eve party.  I couldn't make them fast enough. I decided to make them h'eorderve size instead of sandwiches. I used 3 packages of rolls and made 24 muffin shaped chicken bites.  They came out great in the muffin tins.  Great recipe!!!

I am newly married and am slowly learning how to cook…which is why I love this website! Last night my hubby and I had my parents over for dinner and I make this recipe…it turned out great! I omitted the onions and pimentos (my hubby does not like these), I used about 5 oz. of cream cheese, garlic powder, and paprika. I also doubled up on the crescent dough. I was so pleased when I took the pockets of goodness out of the oven. They looked like they must have been so hard to make, but of course they were not. Everyone raved about how good dinner was! I will be making this dish often.

I have not tried this with home cooked chicken, but with canned chicken, it is BAD. My husband swore it was tuna fish inside the rolls not chicken. It seemed like a really tasty recipe idea, so I may give it another try sometime when I have some leftover grilled chicken breast.

I've used this recipe before, but tonight I didn't follow the recipe for the chicken filling and I like my version better! I mixed lite cream cheese spread with sour cream and a little mayo for the creamy base, then added the chicken. For spice, I added lots of dill, basil, pepper, and onion powder. These ingredients together added a nice creaminess with a little kick.

Made these last night and was very dissapointed. I used the vegetable cream cheese in hopes of adding a little something extra but....no luck. They were kind of plain and much different than I had expected.

I used red bell peppers instead of pimento and cooked the chicken with seasoning/the onion first. The final product was good, but not as good as I thought it would be for the effort. With a little experimentation, I think it could be great.

This was pretty good- my boyfriend loved it, I thought it was okay. It made a nice presentation. I didn't feel like getting my hands all stinky by chopping an onion, so I used some garlic salt in place of the salt, and then added more becuase it was a little bland. I also used Italian bread crumbs insted of croutons- that's less hassle than crushing them yourself.

Great recipe, but I made some changes, I use any vegetable I have on hand, no pimento, no croutons, and I had 1/2 cup of mayo, sometimes a little shredded cheese.  One of our favorite recipes.  Thanks

These are really tasty! I think that not only would these make a great main dish, but you could probably cut them up into cubes and serve them as appetizers.

I have made these twice and I will make them again.  The second time I added a can of mild canned chilies and I loved the depth of flavor.  I used canned chicken for a quick lunch, with 4 oz of chive and onion cream cheese and a handful or so of shredded mild cheddar. I mixed all ingredients, and then added the can of drained chicken. I melted 1 tablespoon of butter and mixed with Italian style panko crumbs for the top of the bundles, but I am not sure that is necessary.  I pressed two pieces together, placed the mixture to one side and folded over and sealed the seams with a folk.  I baked at 370 degrees for the time on the crescent roll package.  The first time I did not grease the cookie sheet, and they kind of stuck.  The second time I sprayed the cookie sheet and they came off the sheet very nicely.

This was really good!  I didn’t change a thing except I omitted the (optional) pimento because I didn’t have any.  I baked a 4 pack of Costco chicken thighs for the meat and used dried onion flakes. I loved the sweetness and flaky consistency of the crescent rolls.  This is definitely a recipe I’ll be making again!

It was a nice option for leftover chicken.  Easy to make, especially if you want to prepare filling ahead.  Taste a lot like potpie, which surprised me.  Easy to make in muffin tins, as another reviewer suggested.  Used jarred red roasted peppers instead of pimentos.  May make again.  Good comfort food.

Did not add melted butter to filling or on top of crescent squares and it was  fine.  Added ch. almonds to filling along w/some garlic and onion powder.  Probably not the most healthy recipe because of the crescent rolls, but I had a pkg. of them and some cream cheese to use up.  They were very good.

This & Chicken Baseballs are very similar.  I'll keep this for kids, but I doubt it will be a request by anyone else.  I made changes, but I'm can still tell how it would've been without those changes.  Either one's a three star.  :/  Double recipe: I had leftover wing sauce so leaned toward buffalo pockets = 3 1/2 c chicken, 1/2c mild-almost-medium wing sauce, 8oz pkg cream cheese (with 1/2t parsley & 1t apple cider vinegar, 1/8t each onion powder, garlic powder & pepper, 1/4t (hot) blackening seasoning), 2 pkgs crescent rolls.  That's it.  I added the wing sauce to the chicken; spices to the cream cheese then lightly combined.  I could've made two more (two triangles per sandwich) if I had 'em.  I'd add another 1/4t blackening seasoning if I make them again.  I didn't do anything to the tops before, but after I gave them a shot of butter flavor spray - for looks.  :?  :)  With last one gone, I got the "What were those called ... you can make them again" from E, 17.  :O  :D

I have been making this for years, but it is starting to fall out of favor with my family.  It's pretty bland and good for the kids, but for more "grown up" food, I would think you might need to add a little something extra.

I took two chicken breasts and cubed them and cooked them in a pan with a little butter and a packet of Italian seasoning. Once the chicken was cooked, I mixed the cream cheese (a full 8oz.) and some chopped green onions in a bowl. I used a muffin tin and rolled the crescent dough out since I only had one package. I also used bread crumbs instead of croutons since that's all I had. It was sooooo good and my 2 year old even loved it!

Delicious family favorite. I added diced carrots and celery. I omitted the pimentos and used season all salt instead of the regular salt. I placed the dough into rectangles into muffin tins with a scoop inside and folded over the dough.

I gave this 4 stars because I slightly altered the recipe.  I think it is a solid, delicious recipe, but can be modified to fit your tastes.  I do not like raw onion in baked dishes, so I sauteed the onion with a bit of minced garlic before adding it to the cream cheese mixture.  I also used 4 ounces of cream cheese because it was easy to measure half an 8 ounce block.  I'm glad I did because anything less might have been too dry.  Also, I added a pinch of thyme to the chicken mixture.  I didn't feel like crushing croutons, so I used breadcrumbs on top, then added a dash of a seasoning blend.  
We thought it was delicious.  Easy to throw together and my 18 month old loved it.  I will make this again.  A nice winter staple.

Meh, definitely not worth the 500 calories and 30 g of fat in my opinion.  It was okay, but nothing to write home about.  Was a little bland (and I have a very low spice tolerance, so for me to say it was bland...) and they got pretty soggy.  Not bad, but with so many rich ingredients I don't think I will be making again.

My family really loved these!  Beware: this recipe only makes four kind of small pies.  I ended up having more of the chicken mixture than I had crescent rolls.  I would definitely double the recipe next time.  I don't see a need for the croutons eiher as they are wonderful by themselves.  Thank you for this recipe!

Made these lots of times but I like it better with green onions rather than a regular cooking onion...and then put a clove of garlic in it too...also I have never added the croutons...I don't see a need for them.

I made this and left out the milk (not as runny) and didn't crumble croutons or brush with butter.   

next time I would get 3 pound of chicken for 4 cups of cubed chicken....and then double the recipe and make 8 of the pockets.

My family calls this Elysian Chicken Pockets.  I have been making it for years with a few alterations from this version. I use canned chicken breast, Philly Vegetable cream cheese, dehydrated onions and garlic salt. No pimentos. Quick and easy to put together after a long day at work and always gets raves reviews.

Lisa-I too took the rolls out early-bad idea! I used oven baked chicken from my store deli added some garlic powder, Lawrys salt and chicken spice blend. Instead of pimento I used Mancini peppers. Had no problems getting them to stay together. Very good! Next I will use a little more cream cheese and onion. I'm an onion lover.

My picky son even said I'd eat these every day! I added some chopped broccoli, a couple sprinkles of bacon bits, and used biscuit dough instead of crescent roll dough. Do not bake them for 25 minutes, 10 is plenty. Great recipe!!!

Great recipe! I omitted the pimentos since we are not a big fan. I precooked thin sliced chicken breasts cut up with salt, pepper, onion and rosemary. I used 2 tubes of crescent rolls as well. Mixed together cream cheese with chives and added in the pan after the chicken was just about cooked. Filled the crescent rolls and brushed butter mixed with garlic over the pockets and top with seasoned croutons crushed. Awesome! Even my picky 14yr old loved it!

This has been a family favorite for years!  Don't leave out the crushed crouton topping as it gives flavor and makes a nice presentation.  I always serve it with the white sauce I make with my chicken pot pie recipe... just put sauce in a gravy boat and serve with the pies.  Delicious!

Delicious and very easy. Definitely treat the dough like a dough you made. It had to be worked a little bit to cooperate and cover all the contents. Didn't have croutons so used seasoned breadcrumbs for a little crunch. Worked fine. Will make again.

My kids LOVE this and have even requested it for their birthday dinners!  I added the Greek seasoning as another reviewer did and also added garlic salt.  I only had one can of crescent rolls but used a can of biscuits to make up for the lack of crescent dough; their wasn't any difference.  I too placed them in a muffin tin and "flipped" them over after 12 minutes because the top was nice and golden but the bottoms definitely needed more time.  I gave them another 7-8 minutes and they were perfect.  A big recipe that can easily be adapted to the taste of your family.

I've been making a very similar version of this dish. This was the 1st meal I made for my roommate (over 30 yrs ago) - I took shredded chicken and put mushrooms inside too...along w/scallions stirred into cream cheese - add a lil pat of butter in & outside of crescent roll....YUMMY!!

These were great. My bf LOVED them. I only used 4 oz of cream cheese and left out the pimento. Next time I will leave the croutons off, they didn't add anything to the meal in my opinion. Will make again!

I think the amount of filling doesn't match the amount of crescent rolls, so next time I will use two packages of crescent rolls.  I threw in some leftover peas, left out the pimento peppers, and topped mine with bread brumbs rather than croutons because that's what I had on hand.  I didn't like these as much as I thought I would, but they're an easy use for leftover shredded chicken which I always have in the freezer and my husband liked them so they're a keeper!

We love this recipe at our house.  I do make a few changes.  I use chive cream cheese in place of the plain and I use chopped green chilis instead of pimentos.  I use italian bread crumbs instead of croutons, use two packages of the crescent rolls and also add a dash of garlic powder to the chicken mixture. It is a delicious recipe.

Made this last night and the family loved it! The only changes made: I added 4oz's cream cheese instead of 3 and instead of pimento I added sauteed mushrooms and onions. Very delicious and easy to make, will make this again!

I baked these for an easy lunch along with salad when I had guests in from out of town. They LOVED them. I did make a lot of changes, but the basic recipe stayed the same. I took some advice from others too, like first sauteing the onions in the butter along with some garlic and then dumped it all into the mix. I also used chopped up roasted red peppers instead of pimentos. My biggest change was the cream cheese. I saw some reviews where people were complaining that the recipe was a little bland, so, when I went shopping for the ingredients, I looked for a flavored cream cheese instead of plain. What I found worked out great. Philadelphia Brand now makes the "for cooking" cream cheeses that come in little tubs. They have some great looking flavors, but I went with Italian Herb, I added in a little extra to my batch and then just omitted the milk. Seriously, they were great! Even my 2 year old couldn't get enough and he hates anything that contains meat!

This is great! I used 1 crescent triangle per serving with 2 Tbsp. of filling.  For the filling, all I used was a packet of dry ranch seasoning, increased the cream cheese to 8 oz., and chopped the chicken somewhat fine, to avoid lumpy rolls. Just divine!

This is one of my fave recipes. I ommited the bread cumbs and pimento and it still came amazing! I added some Emeril's season to the chicken just for some more flavor. Easy to make and who doesnt love Crescent rolls? :)

These bundles were pretty good.  I added dill to the chicken mixture for some added flavor.  Shredded chicken gives a better texture than cubed.

This had absolutely no flavor at all and I was really disappointed. I even seasoned the chicken before I cooked it. Maybe I'll play around with it but it's almost not worth it.

Not sure what the deal was, but I typically LOVE most of the high star recipes.  Did not dig this one.

Only four stars because the flavor was only OK, but has potential if altered to one's taste.  I sauted the chicken with garlic, onion, and pepper.  I also added some shredded cheese and Italian seasoning to the cream cheese mixture - could have used more.

My family loves this recipe!  We change a couple of things...leave out the onion (just use onion powder instead) and also the pimento..I also season my chicken pretty well while I cook it.  I do everything else by the recipe except after I brush the butter on before baking I sprinkle with Parmesan cheese instead of bread crumbs! Yummy!

Pretty good.  I brushed with oil instead of butter and used bread crumbs instead of croutons.  I like the flavor in these although I'd like to add broccoli to them.  How, I'm not sure, though, as these are pretty small.  I may have cooked too much chicken as I ended up with enough filling for 8 of these, not four.  That was okay bc I have enough crescent rolls.  These aren't especially quick but I like them and they bear repeating.  I'm sure cheese instead of the cream cheese would be great too.  Thanks for the recipe!

We omit the pimento. If I don't have croutons I use seasoned breadscrums. My husband says this tastes like some dish from Houlihan's Restaurant. My sister-in-law showed me this recipe and we LOOOOOVE it!

My family really liked these.  I did have a problem putting them together--the crescent rolls seemed to separate.  So I kinda just rolled it into a roll and pinched the sides.  Served with rice and chicken gravy.  Great recipe for leftover chicken!

This was ok but my husband didn't really care for the flavors. It was a little rich for us. I think I would definitely use less cream cheese or serve it sliced for appetizers instead of the main course.

I too have been making this recipe for years.  My mother found it about 25 years ago (maybe more) in the city newspaper.  I even made it for my bridesmaids' luncheon, chiefly to impress my mother in law to be with my cooking skills.  Generally I only do the crushed croutons if it's a fancy dinner.  The family is too impatient to bother with the extra step.  This past week, I made it with leftover Christmas turkey meat, and it was excellent!

Yum - This was really great and fast. I used two 6 oz. packages of pre-cooked chicken and it turned out great. There was a little chicken mixture leftover so I heated in the microwave and ate it with tortilla chips - Yum!

Would probably work better with large Pilsbury biscuits...the rectangles were very messy.  Needs a bit of flavor, will try again with some cheese and pizza seasoning.

This was great but I changed/added a few things:

*2X the chicken
*1/2 cup swiss cheese
*1 small clove garlic
*Sauteed chicken, garlic, onion
*Sprinkled tops with parmesan instead of croutons

This was really great with the tweeks I did to it. I think it could also be good with all of these tweeks plus a teaspoon of dijon mustard. Will certainly make this again as it was easy and quite a time saver. Thanks for sharing!

These were very good and I'll make them again, but they definitely need a lot more seasoning.  I cooked the chicken in butter with garlic/onion powder and added 1tsp minced garlic with a touch of cayenne pepper to the cheese mix and my husband still commented that they were bland.

This was SO easy and absolutely delicious. I read all the reviews first and simplified the recipe even further. I mixed the two cans of chicken with cream cheese, some garlic salt and lemon pepper to taste. I put the chicken mixture into the crescents, folded instead of pinched,  sprinkled on some zesty bread crumbs, and cooked for 30 minutes. My husband LOVED it and so did I. Will definitely be making these again! Thanks for the great idea!

I made this and added some finely chopped celery and Cavender's greek seasoning as recommended by another reviewer.  I was concerned how it was going to go over with my husband and kids, but everyone said it was great and voted it a keeper.

Great, easy recipe!  You could customize each "sandwich" to individual tastes.    Instead of pimentos we used marinated artichoke hearts and we sprinkled the tops with Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Our batch turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe!

I like the base of the recipe. It was a little bland for me, but my hubby liked it the way it was. I think next time I will use flavored cream cheese and/or red onions, fresh garlic and a little bacon.

I used fresh chicken I cooked myself instead of the canned like some others recommended.  I don't think it would be very good with canned.  I also did them in a muffin tin as recommended by others and they came out absolutely beautiful!  I thought they were pretty enough to serve for company!  I'm only giving them four stars because I didn't think they had enough flavor.  It seemed almost like too much cream cheese.  I will try these again, though, maybe adding bacon and definitely more onion.  Garlic is a nice idea as some others said they add.  I would also try grating some fresh parmesan either in it or on the top until browned.  Great recipe that seems very versatile and I love the idea of the crescent pockets that could be filled with just about anything.

These were a bit tricky, but ultimatley YUMMY! I definatly recommend chilling the chicken/cream cheese mixture before stuffing the cresents. It made it much easier to work with. Overall, very good & will make again.

My family did not like this recipe at all.  It was way too rich between the cream cheese and crescent rolls & I love cream cheese.  Following others suggestions and boiled the chicken with chicken broth and added bacon (I skipped the pimentos and croutons).  Maybe it would have been better if I had just stuck with the recipe.  I am going to use the crescent roll idea to make mini pot pies however.  Sorry.

These were great!! I used canned chicken, added fresh red pepper instead of pimentoes, added about 2 tspn. of fresh tomatoes and some garlic powder. I topped them with italian breadcrumbs. It almost tasted like a crab cake. Sooo good!

THIS WAS INCREDIBLE!! It was super easy and all five kids and their finicky pallets loved it. I did not use the pomiento's and seasoned the chicken a little with basil, mrs dash, and dill before adding it to the mixture. Other than that and increasing the servings to feed 8 instead of 4 - it was perfect. I was hoping to have some leftover to take to work for lunch but that surely didn't happen.  Thanks so much!!

Loved the crescents, loved the croutons on top, loved the the whole idea, just wasn't crazy about the stuffing.  However, this was just my personal taste!  I think I will make it again but possibly stuff mine with ham & cheese, or mayb some kind of pizza stuffing.  Easy after work recipe!

This was easy and delicious. While cooking the chicken (which I simmered in broth), I added a small white onion, two garlic cloves, and a few handfuls of spinach leaves. This mixed easily with low-fat cream cheese and margarine. I slipped the pimentos.

Absolutely the delicious! :) The only thing I would do is sprinkle seasoned bread crumb’s instead of the croutons, but just for convenience.

I have been making a similar version of this recipe for years and years....I use italian bread crumbs and add a little more spice (whatever I am feeling at that time)  I then use cream cheese and lemon pepper seasoning for the filling.  I melt the butter and after filling the rolls I roll them in the melted butter and roll them in the bread crumbs.  Never bland this way, always gets rave compliments.

I followed the directions pretty closely. I thought the filling was much better before I rolled it up in the dough. And the croutons are terrible, it would probably be much improved without them. I just thought it was too dry and bland, but I may play with it a little because it was so easy to make.

I have been making these for years it's one of my son's fave's This is close to how I make them but I use green onions and I do not use the pimento.  I also use italian bread crumbs.  Where I found my receipe it had a sauce made from 8oz. of sour cream and 1 can of cream of mushroom soup heated together.  I serve with mashed potato's.  I do try and use fat free where I can and I always make lots and freeze before baking.  You can also use left over turkey!

After reading others' reviews on the bland flavor I changed the recipe up and even with all the changes it was just okay. I doubled the recipe and yielded six large rolls. I used the cream cheese, butter, 2 cans of cooked canned chicken, 2 Tbls. of Cavender's seasoning and the croutons on top. I also added some Cheddar cheese and parsley flakes to the mixture and then added some extra Cheddar cheese on top of the meat prior to folding over the top to seal the bundles. I must say they made a very pretty presentation though. Probably won't make again.

Wonderful! I didn't add the pimentos because I didn't have them, but I did add one can of cream of mushroom soup to the cream cheese mixture (for the husband)and added peas and it was a HIT! No complaints, just silent gorging at the dinner table. I will definitely make these many times as they were quickly devoured and much appreciated.

Substitute turkey for chicken, and this is a great way to get rid of Thanksgiving leftovers. I also add a chopped stalk of celery and some bacon for a variation. Instead of croutons, I sprinkle cornflake crumbs on top. This is good served with tomato soup. Yum!

My sister made this according to the recipe directions and I thought it was a 5 star. My husband doesn't like cream cheese though (and yet I married him anyway - I'm a tolerant woman) so I changed it up. I left out the cream cheese and put in a little mayo and some Cheddar cheese instead. He still didn't like it (because of the texture) but I did.

I made a few modifications, and my husband, and I were not pleased. It was edible. But it was a strange taste it. I sauted some onions, and mushrooms, and mixed with the chicken, egg, and cream cheese.
With the taste of the crescent dough, I would go a totally different route with the insides. 
Chicken, cream of muchroom soup, some onion, carrots, peas. I think it would taste best with more of a pot pie inside.

Good, quick meal.  Husband and I enjoyed this, boys did not, no surprise there, it was not pizza or PB&J.  You can modify spices to suit your taste.  Certainly worth a try.  Thank for the recipe.

Good, but a little bland.  Would be better with some spinach and extra seasoning.

Good recipe, I added a little more cream cheese, just a personal preference of our family.  I also omitted the pimentos.  I had lost this recipe and I'm so glad I came across it on here.  Thanks for sharing!

Very easy and flavorful. Great to make extra and freeze so you have an excellent and easy weeknight meal. Hubby requests something crunchy like carrots or celery in it so I'll try that next time.

My family enjoyed this homemade version of a hot pocket. Used onion powder instead of onions -picky eaters. But turned out very tasty regardless.

Very Good. I added water chestnuts for crunch and found that it was much better with rotisserie chicken (I used canned chicken the first time I made it)

I accidentally used an 8 oz package of cream cheese and they were, not surprisingly, too cream cheesy.  I am still giving it a five though because they were very yummy and I'm sure that if I follow the directions correctly that they will be fabulous.  Thanks for the wonderful, easy recipe!

This was great. I left out the pimentos (my husband is picky) and added garlic as other reviews suggested. Very good and easy to make. I made 3 with the croutons on 1 without. I preferred without.

These were great and so easy!  The only thing I changed was to add 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic, and sliced up about 4 fresh mushrooms to add to the chicken mixture.  They turned out great!

very good! I added fresh sage and a little more onion than recipe calls for to the cream cheese mixture, tasted great! Used italian bread crumbs on top instead of croutons as well. Perfect when you are in the mood for comfort food.

This was alright, not terrible but not as great as the others have stated.  I added cheese and marinated the chicken which, I think probably made it better.  I can't imagine tasting it without doing that.  I will not make again.

This was allright.  I had some cooked shredded chicken to use and it worked quite well for this dish.  I didn't have to use extra crescent rolls; my sandwiches (or bread "kisses") were stuffed and chubby.  Next time I'll add some dill and either some peas and/or celery as well.  I didn't use the crushed croutons and don't see that it really affected anything.

My mistake for not reading the reviews before I made this. We found it a little flat...needed more spice. Next time will brown celery, onion and garlic before adding to chicken. As per another reviewer, I will add cheddar cheese before closing.

These were great!  I made a few changes, sauteed broccoli, onion, garlic and then added turkey and cream cheese, and right before closing them added some shredded cheddar.  They tasted great.  I've made a recipe similar but with mayo instead of cream cheese and this one is a lot better and creamier.  This is very versatile and you could add whatever kind of ingredients inside you want.

ridiculously easy and soooo good. i omitted the milk because i didn't want it to get runny and added a clove of garlic, some grated cheddar cheese, and extra onion. the only problem was that the dough kept splitting and i would have to keep pinching it together. the croutons are an inspired touch- they make it look all the more delicious.

MMM... I did tweak it a little. Used leftover marinated chicken (1/4c oil, 2 T. lemon juice, 1/4c soy sauce, 2 T. grated onion, 2 cloves garlic, 1 tsp. salt, 1 t. celery salt...very good! the longer you marinade the better!) I added to the mixture 1/2 cup finely shredded chedder cheese, 1 clove garlic and used 4 oz. cream cheese instead of 3.  I had enough mixture for 2 pkgs. 8 oz. crescent rolls. For 8 servings.

My family loves this recipe. It's one of those that's great for a night when you need a quick dinner. Really a no fail recipe, in my opinion. I don't, however, use croutons. I use crushed Ritz cracker crumbs.

I just realized I never rated this recipe, so let me tell you that it is one of my favorites!!! Soooooo good!! I always use 8oz of cream cheese, though, and it isn't too much by any means. If you've never worked with dough like this, make sure to put it in the freezer for about 20 minutes before manipulating or you will end up crying like I did the first time!! Seriously, can't recommend this enough-- I make it ALL THE TIME!! YUM!

I found this to be a little bland, BUT---if you use celery salt instead of regular salt and add about 1/2 tsp ground thyme and 1/4 tsp garlic powder to the mix, it's pretty good. Make sure you seal up perforations well, or it's a big mess!

Eh, these came out rather bland. Perhaps it's because I used low-fat cream cheese and I didn't use pimento peppers (I didn't have those on hand). It tasted like it was missing something. Probably wouldn't make again.

Easy and tasty.  I think smaller versions would make a nice appetizer for a party.

This was a nice change for us, thank you for submitting. I used leftover shredded/chopped turkey. I didn't have time to soften the cream cheese so I used a mayo & sour cream instead. I omitted pimento's and used paprika. I added basil and onion granules. I wish I had added shredded cheddar cheese! I used two packages of crescent rolls and this was so yummy - we love bread! I still made 4 but placed one rectangle on top of the other. I didn't use any butter, I think that the crescents have enough in them. I think that this would be nice for a ladies lunch!

What a quick and easy recipe!  I used canned chicken, which was okay, but I think next time I'll use fresh chicken.  I also used low fat cream cheese to cut down on some of the fat.  Still, it turned out fine.

The whole family loved these. I used an herbed rotisserie chicken which added a nice flavor. I put all filling ingredients including chicken in my food processor. I did double the recipe as another reviewed suggested, so that our family of four could each have 2 sandwiches.

OMG!! i love this recipe. i havent heard about it until my bf's mom made it. its easy and cheap to make. especially if u have leftovers, like on thanksgiving, turkey is as good. what i really like about it is that she puts gravy over top of it. it reminds me of thanksgiving everytime it eat it, and i cant just eat one!

These are really great, but don't let them sit out for to long after you take them out of the oven, they'll loose alot of their "oh so goodness".

Very easy and tasty. We sautee the chicken with about a tablespoon of paprika instead using the pimento. I add a dash of garlic powder as well.

These were good but kind of a weird texture.  They aren't real big so if you have a hearty appetite you may want to make enough so that you get 2 for yourself.

This was GREAT!  I am not a very good cook and it turned out so well even for me!  I didn't use pimentos (I don't even know what those are!) and I used 4 oz. cream cheese instead of 3 which I think worked out perfectly.  With the 4-serving recipe, I was able to make 6 servings with plenty of filling to put in each.  Anyways, my husband was extremely impressed with my cooking abilities and that just doesn't happen that often so THANK YOU for the wonderful recipe!!!  (They are even good warmed up in the microwave as leftovers!)

My family (including my VERY picky 2 year-old) loves this recipe.  I didn't follow it exactly, because I had only half a package of cream cheese on hand.  But, to make up for the other half, I substituted ricotta cheese instead.  This was a beg hit with my husband!  (I also left out the pimentos)

I substituted green chiles for the pimento.  The recipe has excellent flavor, but I had a little trouble keeping the rolls together.I will definitely try this again.

Hi, I am married to the pickiest man alive, who, on the second bite replied, "THIS IS A REPEAT!" I never get responses like this. Thank you so much for the recipe. 
I did grill the chicken marinated for 30 minutes in italian seasoning and teriyaki sauce then followed the rest of the directions.

I read the reviews and I'm not sure what I was hoping for but this was not it!! The recipe needed something, my husband says it needs vegetables and he might be right. All in all, this recipe was just O.K.

This was a great way to use up my leftover chicken. Incredibly easy and very tasty. I substituted a couple of cloves of garlic for the onion, and I kind of regreted it, but it still rocked.

Fantastic!  Sometimes it is hard to close the crescent dough around the filling, so they don't always look very good, but they taste wonderful!
