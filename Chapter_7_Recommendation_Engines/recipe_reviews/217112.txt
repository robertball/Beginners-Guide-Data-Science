Simple and quick - the perfect go to recipe when you need a little treat! I also make these with 1/2 cup butterscotch chips & 1/2 cup peanut butter melted together and 3 cups of corn flakes.

Great Recipe! Mine came out wonderful!

I made one change. I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup. I also put them in the fridge when I was done putting them into individual cookies so they were ready faster. I also didn't have an wax paper but a plastic cutting board worked just fine.

Loved this it was fast and easy to make! I was looking for a sweet treat using only stuff I had on hand! This made the cut! I did add a couple things to it. I added 2 Tbs cocoa powder (because I had it and my family loves chocolate) and 1/2 tsp vanilla. These came out great! I will be making these again!

My grandmother used to make peanut butter corn flake balls similar to these. They were great. I found the proportions in this recipe to be a little off. Not enough peanut butter or corn flakes, too much of the other stuff. It's still a good recipe but not as good as grandma's!

Very easy and came out great. I was worried it would be too sweet, but the peanut butter balances out the sweetness nicely! I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup, and actually forgot to include butter. Tasted totally fine without butter, so I suggest trying it if you'd like to cut out some calories!

I learned to make a version of these in fourth grade, but the recipe I knew was slightly different.  It had 1/2 cup each of sugar and light Karo, but no butter and a whole cup of peanut butter, and then used 6 cups of cornflakes.  Those were less sweet than this version would be.

A very forgiving recipe which produces a favorite public school dessert from the 70's.  I have stopped using corn syrup but the results are the same

I used:
 agave nectar 1 cup
1/2 cup sugar
3 TBSP butter  and brought to a boil for 1 min 
removed from heat and added a heaping cup of peanut butter stirring until smooth.  added 8 cups of corn flakes (no need to crush) Stir until mixed
poured all into a buttered 11x7 glass x dish.  smash down with bottom of pan or glass.
Takes a couple of hours to harden enough to hold together.  Cut into squares.  Try not to eat the whole pan by yourself!!

It's a 5 for the level of effort. So easy. so quick. so few ingredients!

next time I might add some nuts or chocolate chips, but it's a great impulse cookie.  Skipped the wax paper, through down a silpat on the cookie sheet and was good to go.

Certainly a very adaptable recipe. I had to substitute out the corn syrup and cereal for butterscotch sauce and crushed crackers, still came out delish! I think you could substitute it further to meet any taste by using almond butter or Nutella instead of peanut butter and use whatever plain cereal or cracker that meets your fancy. Maybe stir in dried fruit or chocolate too.

These are soooo delicious!  They are fun and easy to make and they set up well.  Cheap to make and they make a lot.  I have a family of 5 (husband, me, and 3 boys) so I am always looking for recipes that make a lot and are cheap and easy!  This recipe is a must in my house - I make it so often!

It is a simple and quick recipe, I tried both original and the maple syrup version. Maple was simply too sweet for me, and didn’t set up as well. The original was nice, but next time I plan for slightly more peanut butter and less sugar.

I remember the lunch ladies at my gradeschool making these. I used to look forward to the days these were on the lunch menu. The only change I made to the recipe is that I used honey instead of corn syrup. These cookies are as yummy as I remember.

These were super easy and so good. I made them with my 9 year old and she had a blast and loved them. We made them just as the recipe stated, except we drizzled some chocolate on them at the end. Awesome!

I decided to use what I had on hand to make these so I used saltines, ritz crackers and a mini box of Frosted Flakes! They came out tasting great, looking a little odd!

They used to serve these in the school cafeteria and were loved by many including myself. I made the recipe, but doubled it, and they got hard as a rock. Does anybody know why? Thanks

Add some green food coloring and a few red hots and these turn into mistletoe cookies. Perfect for the holidays!

Nice for a quick peanut butter fix! I like them with 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 corn syrup with the sugar. Also used a tsp of vanilla, added when the peanut butter is stirred into the sugar/syrup mix after it comes off the stove.

Totally great - and came together much quicker than I was expecting.  I scooped 1/2 of the cookies, then added some chocolate chips to the other half. All were delish!  I will probably add a little salt the next time I make them (the natural peanut butter I had in the house was low on salt).  Also thinking of swapping brown sugar in for the white sugar for a molasses-y flavor.

I cut a bit of sugar and corn syrup and added 2 tbsp cocoa and some chopped nuts. It was a bit hard to hold together but totally yummy

These are awesome, just like the ones the lunch lady used to make. I also added a cup or so more corn flakes, they just seemed to wet without the added flakes.

Extremely easy to make and for me the proportions turned out just right. Went back about 10 minutes after dropping onto cookie sheet to make the drops a little tighter....was hard to do while very warm.

Simple, easy and yummy.  I had corn flakes that were going to go to waste and found this recipe.  Took about 10 minutes and that was with my 4 year old helping.  I added a half cup chocolate chips right before I dropped them on the wax paper.  You could add anything you may have in them (mini m&m's, any kind of chocolate chips, nuts, etc).
