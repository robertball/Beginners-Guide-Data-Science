These are very good!I thought the amount of chocolate chips was going to be too much...but it's not. The struesel was too wet, though.  So next time I won't melt the butter; I will cut it into the struesel so it is more crumbly.  Great!

The muffins turned out great! The streusel topping made it especially delicious. I added a Hershey's Kiss in the centre of each muffin for a special touch. My family loved it so much... defintely gonna make it again!! Thanx Nestle! :)

My 5 year old son made these last year for a local fair and got a blue ribbon!  He was so excited.  These are very easy and yummy! Kids love them.  They taste like toll house cookies in a muffin.  A definate keeper.

I can't believe I'm saying this, but there were way too many chocolate chips for the amount of batter---otherwise pretty good.  My son really enjoyed them.

I thought those would be bigger. They look more like British scones than they do muffins. They taste greatbut I find that there is too much chocolate for my taste even though I'm a chocoholic. Easy and quick.

My family loved these muffins! As other reviewers suggested, I cut back on the choc chips and added vanilla essence.  I also substituted butter milk for the regular. I think it adds a tang to the flavour.  I also tried these using butterscotch chips and they were fantastic. Make a bit extra topping and freeze it for further batches.  Thanks for the recipe!

Delicious!  Following some of the other reviews, I did reduce the chocolate chips, and it was still plenty!  I just softened the butter for the streusel topping, did not melt it, and it had a nice, crumbly texture.  Definitely will make these again!

I reduced the amount of chocolate chips and added 1/2 cup of creamy peanut butter. Mmmm, it was tasty. I used some milk chocolate chips in addition to semi-sweet, plus I added semi-sweet chocolate chips to the streusel topping instead of nuts. Both my husband and I enjoyed the muffins very much.

This was good.  I made it for a morning coffee group with my SAHM's, and everyone really liked them.  I did substitute slightly.  I used canola oil in place of margarin (since it had to be melted anyway) and I added 1/2 tsp of vanilla extract.  I just couldn't imagine these without the vanilla.  The consistance seemed odd in the bowl, but they turned out good.  I thought a muffin should be a little sweeter, but everyone said they were great, and not one was left.

Very yummy! After reading the reviews, I didn't put as many chocolate chips in, I only put about half as much as it calls for, it was just enough for me.

Quick & easy recipe.  I brought these into work and got rave reviews.  A few people told me that they were bakery quality muffins!  At the end of the baking, I decided to leave the muffins under the broiler for just a minute to help the streusel topping brown slightly.

These are terrific!  Very moist muffins.  For a gift, you can layer the first 5 ingredients in a wide-mouth canning jar, then put the chocolate chips on top of the layers.  I only used one cup of chips, as I didn't want the chocolate to overwhelm the muffins

I used this as a base to make chocolate muffins. I added a little more than 1/3 cup of cocoa powder. I didn't use Nestle as I do not use genetically engineered products so I used chocolate powder and chips from Wholefoods, but you can get non-genetically engineered chips and ingredients at many natural stores. The muffins came out with a perfect texture and consistancy. Firm yet moist. I can't try them as I made them for a friend, but I'll definitely be using this as a base for all future muffins.

Thanks!

These turned out good, though the batter was not as sweet as I was expecting and the semi-sweet chips were slightly overpowering.  Might be better made with some oats and less flour.  These were good and I will be making them again.

I liked these, my son did not.  He said the topping was too hard.  I read previous reviews about the chocolate chips overpowering the muffins, so I cut back on those.  I will probably not make these again, only because my son didn't like them, and as far as muffins and stuff go, I don't make what he doesnt' like.  Other than that, I would make them again in different circumstances.

SUPER EASY TO MAKE, GOOD FLAVOR. EVERYONE LIKED THEM. I MAY TRY MAKING THEM WITH 1/3 TO 1/2 FEWER CHOCOLATE CHIPS NEXT TIME, THEY ARE SUPER RICH.

I wasn't impressed with these.  I guess I was expecting more of a "chocolate chip cookie" taste.  Mine were moist when they were warm, but dry after they cooled.  I did not use the struesel topping.

painfully dry, tates more like fluffy cookies than muffins, the streusel needs at least 2 tablespoons of butter to work properly, it has an interesting flavor but I'll never use it again

My family loves these muffins, although, I only add maybe a cup (at most) of chocolate chips and I don't always add the streusel topping.
