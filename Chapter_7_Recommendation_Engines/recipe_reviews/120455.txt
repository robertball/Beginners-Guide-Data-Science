I added crushed red pepper and some cayenne for heat to the orange sauce, and served this over rice. My family loved it.

These are very tasty tidbits.  Works well as a meal served with rice or as an appetizer.  The sauce was really mild, nice orange taste, a little touch of brandy as other reviewer suggested made a nice addition.

I used this recipe for my family/friends xmas get together.  Everyone enjoyed and my husband added a little of brandy to the sauce which made it taste even better.  Great holiday appetizer. Will make again.

These were quite good. I served as a main dish over Onion Rice from this site. My only thought would be to perhaps add a little cornstarch slurry to the sauce, as it didn't coat the chicken quite as well as I wanted. Thanks for sharing!

I enjoyed this ... my family is still not sure. I made it ahead and reheated but it was definitely better when it was first made! I will make this again, even if it's only for me.
