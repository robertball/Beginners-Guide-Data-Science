This bread is great! I did make a few modifications, though: I used whole wheat flour and brown sugar, I used extra orange juice instead of adding water to the butter/orange zest/juice mixture, and I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla. I also didn't put the frosting on top.
This is a great recipe. I'll be making it a lot in the future!

A no fail recipe! Cranberry Nut Bread is my favorite holiday treat! I followed the recipe to the letter, but made them in individual pans rather than one big one. They freeze beautifully, and look and taste fresh when defrosted. They smell heavenly while baking. No fuss magic!

Everyone loved this recipe! We couldn't wait to get it out of the oven, it smelled so good! I substituted pecans for the walnuts, we'll make this several times a year, not just around the holidays!

I found it awfully dry for my taste. Looked nice but ended up throwing most of it away.

This recipe is as fantastic as it is easy. I made it as gifts for Christmas, and everyone raved and wanted the recipe. My husband calls it "crack in a pan." I made it without the frosting and did two small loaves per batch. They cooked in the same amount of time.

I only made a few adjustments (I always try to make a bit healthier): whole wheat flour, 3/4 cup of dk brown sugar (I just prefer the taste), about 2 tablespoons of Smart Balance spread for the butter, halved the cranberries, added 1/2 tspn each of vanilla extract, cinnamon and nutmeg and skipped the icing. I cooked it at 350 for 50 mins and it turned out pretty tasty. I did find it a little dry and I will try adding a small amount of nonfat yogurt to the batter next time in place of the butter. I'm going to make mini loaves for the kids to give their teachers for Christmas this year. 1 loaf should translate to 4 mini loaves.

This recipe is Wonderful.   I made it for a Christmas party and every one loved it.  I did make a few of the modifications mentioned in the Review written November 25, 2006.  by Amanda Cornelius  I used extra orange juice instead of adding water to the butter/orange juice mixture, and I added 1/2 tsp. cinnamon and 1/2 tsp. vanilla.  ** I left out the orange zest**   (I followed the recipe on everything else)

Really good especially as a not too sweet dessert.  I used frozen cranberries as fresh were not available.  They worked just fine.

I made this for a pregnant neighbor who was craving cranberry walnut bread. It made everyone happy! Great recipe.

It's not tangy or tart at all; I would have liked it to taste a little tart, so next time, I'll add lemon juice or something.  I made it as directed but instead of an orange, mixed an entire clementine in a food processor (minus the peel) and used that in the batter.

I used pecans instead of walnuts.  Was in a hurry so I didn't make the glaze but sifted confectioner's sugar on top.  Got some great reviews!

This is perfect with a morning cup of coffee, not too sweet, just right. Using my Cuisinart oven central, this recipe cooked 5 muffins in 20 minutes and one 8x8  "loaf" in 25 minutes. That saves heating up the oven.
