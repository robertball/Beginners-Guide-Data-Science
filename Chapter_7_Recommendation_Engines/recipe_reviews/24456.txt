I found that by putting the mixture in the fridge and leaving it overnight - it made it a lot easier to roll........Also when I ran out of Chocolate sprinkles I rolled the remaining dough in Cocoa powder.

I found these while looking for a gluten-free version of my Xmas favorite rum balls. They are super rich, but not too sweet; much more like fudge than like the traditional Nilla-wafer-based rum ball cookies.  

After reading LARABER's review, I decided to forgo the jimmies and used General Foods International Suisse Mocha flavored coffee powder to roll them in instead, which worked really well. I think the sugar in it helps compensate for the bitterness of the chocolate.

I also had the same experience where the mixture was much too runny to make into balls. I added about half a cup more powdered sugar (maybe even more), which seemed to help. Also, it wasn't cold enough after an hour in the fridge, but three hours was plenty.

Finally, I used amaretto for half the batch and rum for the other half. Both tasted awesome. :-)

These were very hard to roll, even after an hour in the fridge. The dough was overly soft and not easy to work with. Also ran out of jimmies, I was not thinking about how many I'd need, but maybe the recipe should say "several bottles of chocolate jimmie sprinkles". I rolled the rest in finely chopped walnuts, and that was OK.

Great recipe as I am cutting back on gluten.  I used semi sweet choc  as I didn't have unsweetened and they turned out great.  I added a pinch of chili pepper and substituted pecans for almonds. I used a gourmet chocolate sprinkles that is less sugary and more refined looking and every one thought I bought them at an upscale bake shop.

These turned out way too runny, even after adding extra powdered sugar and freezer time! They did taste okay, but really not worth the sticky mess... sorry.

A tasty little morsel with a prominent rum flavor.  I didn't have any jimmies so I rolled them in crushed chocolate cookie crumbs which worked out great.

Maybe. Coffee really brings out the chocolate flavor, but not 'rummy' enough for me, although all who tried it said they could taste the rum.

All I had when I was done was something closer to a batter than a dough.  My objective was to make nut-free, dairy free (I used tofutti cream cheese), and gluten free rum balls, adding sorghum flour and tapioca starch helped slightly.

even better using amaretto in place of rum
