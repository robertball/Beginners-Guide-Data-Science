I used my No Guilt Ranch dressing as a base for this instead of a bottled/packaged dressing. This took my recipe to a whole new level. I made a veggie platter for dinner and I swear we ate over half of this dressing in one sitting. It's FABULOUS. One of the best ranch dressings I have. EVER. HAD.

This is wonderful.   I followed the recipe exactly, except I used homemade ranch dressing from their own buttermilk packet.   I made this to put on beef fajitas, but it will be excellent for dipping just about anything into.   Thanks!

Thank you so much for this...
I use a bottled jalepeno ranch as part of a sauce for deep fried potato salad, but needed some way to pass it along to others who may not have pre-made dressing available locally....

THANK YOU !!!

Oh, wow! This is FANTASTIC!!!! I am one of those people who can not stand the taste of store bought ranch dressing, so I made my go-to ranch recipe (1/3 cup mayonnaise, 1/3 cup sour cream, 2/3 cup buttermilk, 2 tbsp. hidden valley dry ranch mix) and used it in the recipe instead. I also substituted 2 tomatillos for the tomato, added the juice from 1/2 a lime, and increased the cilantro to a loose 1/4 cup. Let me tell you, this is now my NEW go-to ranch recipe! Simply delicious!!!

So good!!! I cut the recipe in half - kept the same 1/4 cup of jalapeño measurement and it was the perfect amount of spice for us. Was great on fish tacos!!

I liked this a lot. I made homemade ranch then used this dressing on salad. I then used it on another recipe (taco stuffed peppers) and liked it even more. I did however use fresh jalapeños. Great dressing! Thank you for the recipe.

This was wonderful! The only one change I would make next time is to use fresh jalapeno's over the pickled. I used this on a salad last night with dinner and I just finished the rest of it off for lunch with raw veggies.  This would work well on many different things. Thanks for sharing!
