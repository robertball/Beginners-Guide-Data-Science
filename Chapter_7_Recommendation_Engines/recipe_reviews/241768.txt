This is a great  basic recipe to which you can add whatever you like.  I added sunflower seeds, chia seeds, ground flax seeds, dried blueberries, black and regular sesame seeds, and dried apple. I cut and freeze mine; they are perfect when I'm ready for a treat.

Okay, these are terrific!!!  Only a 4 on this because I agree, they need more oats.  I didn't have any coconut, but put in extra sunflower seeds to make up for it.  Next time I will add more oatmeal and probably more peanut butter, and cook the syrup longer so they aren't so soft.  It  is very humid today and they are just too soft!!  Great recipe for a no-bake.

I love these! I often use honey instead of corn syrup and a little less of it in general and then decrease the amount of cereal slightly. Instead, I could just add less brown sugar to reduce sweetness. I also add flax seeds usually, and whole peanuts when I don't have crunchy peanut butter. It's difficult to stop eating them because they're somewhat virtuous, but really I should be treating them like a cookie.
