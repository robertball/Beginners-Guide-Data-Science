This is really good. It is the closest I have come to copying some terrific French Toast from a Vegas Breakfast Buffet.

I guess I was expecting more of a unique french toast, but really, this tastes like french toast! My family couldn't even tell it was a new recipe (despite the tiny cornflake coating). It IS very good but everyone already thought this was my french toast recipe. Since I don't think it tastes better than my recipe, I won't go through the extra effort to make this again. Still, very good.

This was great.  I used regular white bread but only dipped the pieces of bread in the egg mixture.  Excellent brunch for my husband & I this morning.

I didn't enjoy this recipie b/c the first piece of bread soaked up at least half the mix. The two remaining breads that i was able to moderate the servings a little better were still not good.

The best french toast I had ever tasted! I didn`t even use the vanilla extract and only put a tablespoon of syrup in, and they still came out delicious. The confectioners` sugar made them perfectly sweet enough. And the idea of putting cornflakes in is ingenious. ;)

A good overall recipe. I will use thick bread when I make again-regular white bread fell apart-maybe I soaked it too long. I added another egg, but the batter only was enough for 5 slices.

Great recipe! Doesn't taste all that different from regular french toast, but still good. I used grape nuts instead of cornflakes and thought it worked well.

I didn't eat the french toast I just made it but my younger brother said it was very good. It seemed average to me. The milk to egg ratio seemed to work well in it. 4 stars.

My husband loved these. I used whole grain bread, soy milk and granola instead of corn flakes. He said, they feel healthy :) Great recipe for a fast yet delicious breakfast!

I don't eat French Toast but my kids do and they really enjoyed this version. I used Sy's Challah bread from this site which made it extra special. Thank you!!

Very good! I substituted the sugar for whey and used sprouted bread for a nice supplement of protein. I also used crumbled blueberry Cheerios giving it a nice hint of fruit.

Made this recipe using loaf sandwich bread that needed to be eaten before going bad. Didn’t use cornflakes because I didn’t have them, but it was still delicious!  Only dipped the bread in the egg mixture for a couple of seconds on each side rather than soaking them.  Fried them in melted butter and poured maple syrup on top.  It was more like dessert and so very delicious!

It turned out too soggy.  I am a novice at cooking, but I followed the recipe exactly, except I did remove the crust.   Any tips?

I made this with our local bakery's cinnamon swirl bread and cut into nice thick slices.  It made 4 slices so I added a couple more eggs and milk with a dash of syrup and made 2 more. It came out nicely crisp and moist. French toast is always made best with day old or drier bread.

I did not make mine stale first and need to do that next time. Also with brioche bread soaking it makes it fall apart and too gooey inside. In any case it was delicious and easy to make!
