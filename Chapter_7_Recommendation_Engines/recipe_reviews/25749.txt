This was so good! It took a long time to actaully cook, but it only took about 10 minutes to prepare! And then you just simmer it and forget it! It was good!

Great recipe...I added only half the wine and in addition at the end of cooking time some Gruyere cheese as a topping for the finished soup.  This is authentic and wonderful.

Made EXACTLY as stated.  I'm sorry to rate this so low, but it was we did not care for it, and we could not eat it. My husband and teenaged sons who are quite adventurous when it comes to food all, after 2-3 tastes, pushed their bowls back and said they didn't like it.  Oh, well.  I know this is a legitimate recipe because I did a search and found very similar variations.  I like the history of the recipe, but it is just too sweet.  The incorporation of the bread just made it look a mess.  Not a visually appealing meal either.  Will stick to French Onion Soup.
