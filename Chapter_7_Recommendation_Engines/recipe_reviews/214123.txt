Very clever! I made these for Halloween this year. However, I used pimento stuffed olives for the eyeballs and the meatballs took on a very olive-y flavor. But my guests loved them. :)

I have been making different meals and treats to get into the holiday spirit and this one was a big hit. I tried the recipe for the meatballs here and the family asked me to make it again with my own recipe for meatballs. My husband was tickled pink though when I put it on his plate for dinner.

Cute and tasty. Plate at the last minute though as they tend to cool quickly.
