After adding all the overly sweet, artificial-tasting barbecue sauce and goopy mayonnaise, there is no crab taste at all.  With this recipe you may as well nuke a frozen TV dinner.

Unfortunately when I made this, I failed to notice the "chill time" and had not planned it into my cooking time! Arggg!

An absolute horror. When a recipe is a complete flop, sometimes I have to assume it might have been me, the cook, but in this case I don't think so. It was not overcooked, undercooked, I did not use substitute ingredients, nor did I rush the recipe, modify it, ad-lib it or do anything otherthan follows directions to the "t". I would love to have someone from Kraft come by my house and make this by following this recipe and then sit down and eat it.
