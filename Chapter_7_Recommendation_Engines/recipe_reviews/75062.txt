I would give this dish 4 stars as written. The changes I made to make it a 5 star recipe for us are as follows:
First I soaked my Tilapia in milk for about 2 hours.
I then coated the Tilapia with a highly seasoned flour mixture(seasoned pepper, granulated garlic, onion powder, paprika, powdered basil, celery salt, cayenne, ginger, thyme and lemon peel.
I also added a hefty sprinkling of Kraft Parmesan Cheese. I sauteed the fish with a bit of minced garlic and extra EVOO, removed to the serving platter, and did not return to the skillet at all. I added the wine ( a Pinot Grigio, capers, lemon, tomato and a few sliced mushrooms. After whisking in the butter, I decided I needed more of a sauce... so I mixed up about 1/4cup of cream with 1 Tbsp. flour, blended it into the skillet and WOW!!!
A bit of extra lemon and we had an amazing dinner the other night, one which I am planning on adding to the family cookbook. THANKS!!!!!

Wow, we loved this! My boyfriend made this last night and it was delicious. He used canned, diced tomatoes instead and didn't serve it with asparagas.  Watch salting the fish, as the capers add a ton of sodium.  We'll be making this again, THANKS!!  UPDATE: Made this again, submitted pic, and used asparagas this time and it was even better!  We used frozen tilapia, which I don't recommend b/c it's fishier than fresh, but it was still good.  The filets were smaller and fell apart a little, o'well still yummy!

Excellent recipe, but I coated filets with flour and seasonings first before frying in olive oil and left the extra salt out since the capers are very salty already!  I trippled the recipe as well to have a nice sauce to serve over the talapia and served it on a bed of buttered orzo!!  EXCELLENT!!

I'm giving this five stars because it really is very good and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  That being said, I do think this Easy Tilapia would be even EASIER, if you change the process like I did.  First I cooked my asparagus separately ahead of time and reheated it in the microwave.  I didn't want to cook it with the tomato/wine mixture and then have to fish it back out to finish the sauce, as the recipe instructs.  Secondly, once the fish is cooked, why would you add it back to the sauce and then take it out AGAIN???  So to further simplify, I cooked the tilapia and kept it in a warm oven while I made the sauce.  I plated the tilapia and asparagus and topped them with the sauce.  DELICIOUS and even EASIER!!

I made this as a foil pouch "all in one" baked meal and it was very good.  We will definitely do this again - next time on the grill.    My method was: on a large sheet of buttered foil laid out asparagus; sprinkled w/ half the tomatoes and capers; layered tilapia; topped w/ remaining tomatoes and capers; drizzled with a scant 2 ounces white wine vinaigrette (I used Girards Champagne); fold up and baked at 350 for 35 min (my asparagus was thick stemmed and I left it in till they were fork tender - the fish stayed moist). I made one pouch per person.

We loved this dish! The only changes that I made was to add one clove of garlic for my garlic loving husband and since we are not wine drinkers I always sub with chicken broth.  It was easy and came out perfect, great recipe!

This is my recipe and I don't know why there is a bottle of wine in the recipe.  It should only be the 1/2 cup of wine.  Please change this if you can.  Thank you!

Good recipe for someone hesitant to cook fish.  I bought a bit more fish as 6 oz. of fillets was hardly enough for two people.  The sauce makes a lot of sauce and I could have cut back on that.  My son loved the fish, but wasn't hot on the sauce (I think because of the capers) and my husband liked the sauce, but thought the fish was too lemony.  It was an easy way to incorporate fish into our life, but I would use less lemon next time and add garlic.  Thanks!

This is very easy and delicious.  I use white wine/lemon sauce for several dishes, and it is best used with broccoli steamed in it.  Some tips: don't use tomatoes or any veggie, and less butter.  Keep the capers and a pince of minced garlic.  You can use the sauce to saute pasta dishes, chicken or any seafood!

Very confusing recipe, especially for novice cooks.  2 TBls olive oil is way too much~~it doesn't explain that the lemon should be juiced...and asparagus should be cut into 2" pieces & blanched before adding to recipe. Two minutes is not enough to render the Asparagus tender.  Tilapia falls apart if cooked according to this recipe.   Tilapia is bland unless you add plenty of seasonings.  These are the changes I made to make it edible.  Season Tilapia with Old Bay, or S&P, your choice.  Heat 2 teaspoons and cook till slightly golden, no longer than 2 minutes per side or it will fall apart.  Keep warm.  Cut asparagus into 2" pieces & blanch about 1-2 minutes in boiling water.  Add wine, lemon juice, tomatoes, (I used halfed cherry tomatoes), asparagus & capers to skillet, increase heat, cover and simmer for approximately 3 minutes.  Unless the asparagus is blanched, it takes a good 10 minutes to make it tender enough to eat.  Remove from heat and stir in the butter until of desired consistancy.   I did not add the Tilapia back to the skillet as it was already flaky & falling apart. I have a similar recipe, but much tastier.  I will not be making this again. Very bland, even with my adjustments.

So easy and so delicious. Sauteed some minced garlic and onion before adding the wine, lemon etc. Used canned diced tomatoes and rinsed the capers. Will definitely make again, Thank you.

I don't typically care much for fish, but do incorporate it into my family's diet for health reasons.  That being said, i LOVED this dish!  Everything blended so well together.  The only thing I changed was touse 5 tilapia filets and about 1.5 (1 bunch chopped) asparagus.  I kept all other measurements the same.  I also put the asparagus in with the wine & tomatoes since i worried that if added with the fish it wouldn't have enough time to cook.  It came out perfectly firm but cook.  This dish might make a weekly rotation.

After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this one. Both my husband and I thought it was ok, but was too acidic. If I try it again I will not use the whole lemon.

I made this recipe AS WRITTEN!!!!  It was a very nice change and quite tasty.  I'll make it again. Yes I might make a few extremely minor changes the next time...or not.  The bottom line is these reviews should be on the recipe as it's written.  What is it with people who write reviews and say...this was great with MY changes. That's insulting to the recipe creator and says your recipe sucked but I can save it for you.  Gee thanks.  Are you such great cooks you have to teach everyone how to make other peoples creations.  Create your own recipe and submit it.  It seems there are a lot of people here who just can't help themselves.  They have to "make things better".

Made this last night and it was amazing! I would have given it 5 stars but I changed the recipe based on what I had on hand, also I read another reviewers comments and copied them. If interested in the changes I made- I soaked in milk, coated with flour mixture which was (not measured)- flour, pepper, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, basil, celery salt, cayenne, ginger, thyme. I sauteed the fish with minced garlic and olive oil. Removed fish, added to pan- 1/2 cup chicken broth, juice from 1 lime, 1 chopped tomato. Cooked down then whisked in the butter, 1/4 cup cream and some of the seasoned flour that remained from the coating. Poured this gravy over the fish. DELICIOUS!!!!

We loved this recipe.  Slight change...I only had about 1/2 tablespoon of capers so I substituted sliced cured black olives. It really made this more of a Mediterranean flare.  The rest remained exactly the same. The cooking time was perfect. I used 4 fillets.  Can't wait to eat the leftovers!

I was anxious to try this recipe, but was dissappointed.  It was WAY too salty. I won't add salt to the fish next time. It was also very acidic. Based on the comments, I won't add as much lemon. I also used canned diced tomatoes (no salt added) I will give this recipe another try.

Excellent!! I cut back on the butter to 1 Tbsp and still delicious-could probably cut it out all together. I've used this sauce with tilapia and chicken-both very good.

Mmmmm....yummmy!  Didn't even need the extra butter at the end.  My husband, who does not like fish, actually liked this.  I followed the recipe exactly, except kept the butter out.  It was delish!  My daughter liked it, too!  I hope I can keep making fish for dinner, cuz I love fish!  Now, maybe my husband will, too.  I served it with parmesan couscous and because I had corn leftover, I added that in, too.

I made this recipe last night and it was a bit salty.  I omited the asparagus and used green beans instead. I also used Red Snapper.The store had ran out of tilapia. I put the cooked fish on top of brown rice and it was delicious.

Excellent dish and very easy to make.  Watch the salt as the capers are naturally salty :)  I served it with rosemary/onion roasted potatoes and it was great.  It is a keeper!

I enjoyed this very much.  Much like a picatta sauce, but very thin.  Perhaps a little cornstarch would thicken it up a bit.  The flavors were great together though.

This was delicious.  I did not add any salt.  The capers provided enough in my opinion.

Added garlic and artichoke hearts.  Went easy on the salt because the capers provided enough.  Also doubled the lemon.  It was delicious!  My boyfriend found this and he made it for me.  YUM!

Super delicious! I didn't use too much salt based on the comments of the reviewer about the capers adding a lot of sodium and that worked out just perfectly. The flavors and the aroma while cooking was fantastic. Served with a side of garlic rice and toasted/buttered sourdough. For sure the rice soaking up the sauce added a lot to the flavor and added texture to this dish. DH and I loved this dish. For sure a keeper!

I was a little disappointed with this recipe. I thought, how can you go wrong with fish and vegetables. Followed it exactly, but it was too acidic and sour for me.

This is an excellent recipe.  I make it frequently, once a month or so, and my wife ALWAYS loves it.

The sauce is wonderful, but takes a while to thicken.  It is worth the wait to thicken it correctly.

Due to the saltiness of the capers I always rinse them, with water, in a tea strainer.  I have also cut back on the amount of capers.

I am often frustrated by the fish breaking up as it is moved about.

However, notice I still give this dish the best rateing.

I often serve EASY TILAPIA with long grain American Basmati brown rice.  It is more costly and takes extra time; but, is well worth the result.

Delicious!  I was really happy with the way this one turned out.  I did make one addition however: at the very end I threw in a handful of feta cheese to the sauce to help thicken it and add a little more zip.  Also, next time I might use halibut instead of tilapia as I was only able to find previously frozen fillets and they were not so good... I think it would be great with either though!  Thanks for the awesome recipe!

I too can see where this could get very salty if you're not careful...and I like salt! I rinsed the capers before using and added no additional salt. I mostly kept to the recipe, though I blanched the asparagus separately and added it straight to the sauce toward the end, rather than serving it separately. For the fish, I brushed it in evoo and lemon, then dipped it in egg then bread crumbs. This seems to give tilapia a little more presence, though it would probably be just as great per the recipe. Made the sauce per the directions, but added one garlic clove and put the asparagus into it at the end to cook it enough, but still keep it crispy. Made garlic rice pilaf, placed the tilapia on top, then the sauce/veggies. Very good. Not amazing, but fresh, and good. Might make again but not as often as others have mentioned here. Would not make for guests, as this isn't a..."pretty" dish.

What a quick, easy, delicious recipe. We doubled portions and enjoyed every bite. Had no lemons, so we used limes. The tomatoes cooked down beautifully in about 10 minutes and with the capers, wine, oil, butter and a very little bit of chicken broth, made a great sauce. The tilapia is quite meaty, so it didn't dry out in the oven while we made the sauce.  Have served it twice in the last two weeks, once with asparagus, once with broccoli. Yum.
Thanks for a new favorite!

This is a fast and delicious way to serve fish. This sauce would work with several varieties. Even my 3 year old loved this. I followed the directions pretty closely and didn't use asparagus (didn't have any).

I also followed other reviewers advice and put the asparagus in to cook immediately with the wine, tomatoes, etc.  It was perfect.  I won't cook it as often as other fish dishes due to the fairly high fat content, but it will be a wonderful occasional dish.

I love this dish. It is an exact replica of a picatta made with salmon at a local restaurant. I did add some artichokes and garlic after I realized that this tasted like that dish. Yum, yum, yum!!  Thank you Elizabeth!! :) Perfect!!!!

I enjoyed this recipe. The fish came out light and flaky and the veggies made for a nice looking presentation.  The sauce was average tasting, mostly it just tasted like lemon, which was fine for me since I like lemon with fish anyway.  I used Chardonnay and perhaps another type of wine would add more flavor.  Next time I might add some garlic or onion as another reviewer suggested.  Also, you need to be careful flipping the fish because it breaks easily!

I have a recipe similar to this, made without the asparagus or butter, but with 1/2 cup onion and 2 minced cloves of garlic sauted in the pan between cooking the fish and the tomato mixture.  We love it. The kids are 5, 7, 11, and 13 and they do pick out the capers, but they eat the rest and count it as one of their favorite dishes.  Note the author's review, that only 1/2 cup of wine is required for the recipe.

This was amazing. I cooked it for a friend who said it was better than any restaurant and I really don't consider myself a great cook. It was also very easy. I made a couple of changes. I breaded the fish with breadcrumbs,Italian seasoning and parmesan cheese. I can't wait to make it again.

I cooked what I had on hand. Cooked the tilapia, wine (white cooking wine), lemon juice (bottled), tomatoes, capers and bok choy for about 5-7 minutes.  Took another reviewers suggestion and had buttered orzo with it.  Delicious!!

Love this recipe, first time making it was easy and awesome. The only thing I will do differently next time is not to double up on the wine when I double up on the fish or use something other than moscato.

I made this and enjoyed it. I did feel that there was too much lemon, so next time I will cut that down. I also put summer squash, zucchini and broccoli in for the veggies(i needed to use them before they went bad). I did cook them a little and then added in the tilapia again. It was delicious though. I will make this again.

Yummy, but I substituted chicken broth for wine and skipped butter.  Actually tastier and definitely lower in fat.

Really delicious. Added mushrooms and garlic, Old Bay Seasoning,  and olive oil. Thickened sauce with some corn starch. Minused the asparagus and butter. Wow!!! Best fish ever.

I would have given this a 5 star if the recipe had included the recipe suggested by the previous review. I followed that format and it was incredible.

This came out ok. It was a nice easy meal. I felt like some butter was needed to be added somewhere also, it would have been better if shrimp was added. Also, it taste better the first day. I had leftovers for lunch the next day and the flavor was overkill.

We love this recipe with the added garlic. Note: if you increase the amount of fish, you don't need to increase the amount of lemon. If you do, the lemon becomes overpowering. I made this with a 12 oz salmon fillet and increased the oil, wine and lemon by 1 1/2 and ended up with about a cup of leftover sauce. I plan to pour it over some leftover chicken tomorrow night!  Yummy.

Searching for a new tilapia recipe, this one caught my eye!  It was very tasty, and it was declared a "keeper"  -- not an easy verdict in this house.  I followed the recipe as written, though I did include the zest from the lemon.  We thought there might be a few too many capers, though that could be my heavy hand when it comes to capers!  Nice recipe.  Thanks!

This recipe turns out great! Restaurant quality. Made it once before and making it again tonight. Making saffron rice to go with it tonight. we will see?

Just make sure someone is watching the fish because it can cook so fast. you can taste the lemon, wine and butter in the sauce, so good.

This is one of my new favorite recipes! It is so easy to make and it tastes divine. I've already cooked it three times this month! I made some healthy alterations to my dish, adding a bit of garlic and mushrooms and cutting out the butter and half of the capers and white wine (or its too watery). But since I'm playing with the recipe, I've made it differently every time - and EVERY TIME it has been delicious! This is definitely a keeper. I love that I can substitute different vegetables for the asparagus as necessary, and that the fish and sauce are so easy to whip up. Thank you!

This was fantastic! Light and filling! I cooked the asparagus a little longer than the recipe called for, but that's my personal preference. If only I could get my husband to eat seafood - I would cook this all the time. Great with shrimp too!

I'm always looking to try new recipes for tilapia, and I found one that allowed me to finally use the jar of capers I have had in the cupboard for months, and the little bit of leftover white wine. We really enjoyed this, and will definitely be making this again.

I skipped returning the fillets to the pan with the tomatoes. I didn't use capers or asparagus. I substituted a drained can of italian stewed tomatoes and added 1 tsp or so of flour to thicken. The sauce was great. Not sure that it was the best sauce for the fish, but I enjoyed it anyway.

Just not that flavorful. I served it without the capers at my guest's request, but I don't think that would have saved it. Also, the wine & butter never thickened to make a proper sauce.

This was very flavorful.  Used used yellow and green zucchini.  Sauce is awsome.  Could be used on other seafood. My husband likes everything spicy so he added cayanne pepper to his portion.

Really good and easy. I used crushed tomatoes and mushrooms and red peppers instead of asparagus. Next time, I'll sear the fish on a higher heat as some browning would make it taste even better.

I think the white wine that I used was a little too sweet because it ended up becoming candied asparagus. And I didn’t realize till I got home that I was out of tomatoes! I added garlic and a little bit of Parmesan cheese. I think the recipe calls for too much lemon or I just got a particularly juicy one! I will definitely change some things next time!

Easy, delicious.  We are not usually fish eaters, but I will definitely make this again.  Only change I made was to dust fish with searing powder first and put asparagus in with tomatoes.  They were still crisp and delicious.

Made it according to directions.  Slightly tart due to lemons and capers but pallet adjusted.  Certainly would make again and good enough for company who like fish.  Not at all fishy tasting!

I cooked this recipe as is. I prefer my fish to not be so mushy/soft. I think this would have been better if I pan seared the tilapia and made it a little crispier. I gave it an extra star just for the sauce. I will not be making this again.

It calls for butter but does not state when you do use it confusing.  I used red pepper instead of asparagus.  It was great and I cut back on capers. Best tilapia I have ever made or had.  Beautiful dish to plate as well.

Great, tasty sauce! I had too much fish to do in a pan, so I baked the fish in the sauce for about 20 minutes at 425. I added tomatoes to the pan for the last 3-5 minutes so they wouldn't get mushy.

Great flavor, even without asparagus or capers. I modified it to what I had on hand:  halved cherry tomatoes, scallions, and chicken broth instead of wine. Super yummy!

I added some additional spices,  a seafood blend,  and served it with turmeric seasoned orzo and sautéed  vegetables. The 3 stars are for the basic recipe. Once additions are in place I would give it 5 stars.

This recipe is fantastic!!! Followed the directions to a T,with the exception of adding capers. I'm not a real big fish person, but I do like tilapia. And this recipe is phenomenal!! Good job :)

I made this recipe with a couple of changes. I used broccoli florets instead of asparagus. I also added more wine to increase the sauce. Besides, what's not better with more wine?

I loved this dish. It was easy to make and delicious. I used rock fish instead of tilapia and added rainbow chards with the tomatoes instead of capers. I loved it and my 9 year old loved it. My friend who is also a "foodie" came over and tasted it and gave me her approval.

We just made it tonight, and loved it!  We were going to make fish tacos but didn't have all the ingredients.  We had everything we needed in our refrigerator already.  It reminded me very much of the way fish was prepared when we were in Italy...simple, fresh and tasty.  This is eating healthy!

I've made this twice and it turned out well both times.  Didn't have asparagus so made the sauce without it and it was still delicious.  First time I had white wine for the sauce, second time I didn't so subbed chicken broth. Either way worked.  I love the tomatoes simmered with capers.  Just a great, flexible healthy dish.

I made this recipe almost exactly as described, except for the tomatoes.  I didn't have any and it didn't sound good.  I used brussel sprouts halved instead of asparagus.  It was so good.  I am giving only 4 stars because the amount of tilapia must be off.  The rest of the ingredients are too much for only 6 ounces of fish.  I used a whole pound.

This is so good! I' didn't have asparagus so I substituted fresh spinach, and went light on the lemon especially because spinach soaks in so much, and the other reviewers found the lemon a bit heavy. I served it over lentils because I had them. A glass of white wine finished off the best dinner I've had in a long time!

My husband made this with halibut as that is what we had for fish. We are giving this five stars with his enhancements.  It would be a four if he had followed the recipe as directed.  He added shallots, used garlic infused olive oil, Mediterranean pink sea salt, more tomatoes and lemon.  The recipe appeared quite simple to make; perspective, I was playing fetch with our puppy and enjoying a glass of Prosecco so of course I am going to say it was simple.

I had the same problem some other people had with this recipe. You have to be careful about the sourness that is added by the lemon and the capers. It's a really nice recipe and I will make it often.  It's easy and quick to make.

Loved it. I coated the  tilapia fillet with flour and seasonings being frying.  I also substituted chicken broth for the white wine because my 4 year old was eating it.  I will try it with the white wine just for the grownups at another time.   Simple, tasty, delicious, easy pleaser for the whole family.

This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Here are my changes: I soaked the tilapia in buttermilk for a bit, dredged it in flour mixed with some spices (smoked paprika, lemon pepper, lemon zest, salt, oregano, tiny bit of nutmeg) fried it in a little olive oil, then set it aside until everything else was done. I added thin-sliced garlic into the sauce, because garlic. In the end, I plated a bed of rice, placed the asparagus next to that, poured the sauce over both, then placed the fried fish on top. So good.

This was full of fresh flavor. We cooked the asparagus longer as we prefer it not crunchy. Also kept the tilapia in with the tomatoes and asparagus as the butter was added. Served with brown rice it absorbed the delicious juices from the pan. Will make this again!

We've made this three times and it has been great each time.  I didn't have asparagus the second two times which was fine.  The third time I used canned diced tomatoes and sliced yellow squash and it was delicious as well.  Very flexible recipe (and I don't stray much from recipes normally).  Serve over angel hair pasta for a complete meal.  We especially love that it only takes ONE pan...two if you make pasta.

I liked this recipe. It was simple yet very tasty and elegant and without all the hard work.  It uses simple ingredients most homes have on hand. I think the asparagus could better exchanged for other vegetables if you didn't have them on hand. I used more fish than the recipe called for and I only used 1 Tbsp of butter, 3 seemed like too much and it tasted fine with just 1 Tbsp.

This recipe gets 5 stars for being delicious, wonderful and forgiving! The sauce was something I had never done before. My pantry had no tomatoes nor capers. Instead I used a large chopped Vidalia onion and green olives instead.
2/5/14 update: This again got a 5/5 from hubby. It was made as written, except substituting apple cider vinegar for the wine and with the addition of 1/4cup of cream with 1 Tbsp. flour, blended it into the skillet. When hubby is happy, everybody is happy...

Actually, I'd like to give this 3.5 stars. Very good although I'm looking for something other than tomatoes to add. Thanks!

Pretty good, pretty easy!  We'll take that!  Three year old's first time with seafood other than shrimp, and he unfortunately wasn't a big fan of this recipe, but it's only the third time he's had capers, so, the jury is still out on that one!

Fine, although the tilapia itself is pretty boring.  But easy and good.

I followed the recipe as provided and made no modifications. It is wonderful! And a good change from plain ole Talapia. My boyfriend loved it. Although I would agree with others to not oversalt, as the capers are quite pungent.

OMG! Yummmooooo!!I changed a bit, used bread crumbs, parm. cheese, fresh parsley & garlic salt to coat fish. For sauce, used chicken stock in place of wine and only 1 tbsp. of butter and juce of 1 whole lemon ( I really like lemon). This came out awesome, tasted like my favorite picante recipie!!

Tasty and very easy. I was tempted to reduce the butter but don't--you need the full 3 tbs. to balance the capers. I would only note that you need to judge the quantity of capers carefully as there are several varieties.

good basic recipe. Added a little garlic powder, paprika, and a very small shake of cayenne (we love the heat) to the fish before cooking. Only used 2TB butter and that was still a little much--will cut down to 1TB next time. Didn't bother putting the fish back in between wine & butter...really not necessary.

Amazing! I unfortunately didn't have any white wine (and living on a budget I wasn't about to go buy some), but another reviewer recommended substituting chicken broth and it worked wonders. I also left out the salt, feeling the capers did the job just fine. I would give this a five-star rating, but since I had to make a few minor changes I'll stick with four. Kudos!

Very good and very easy.  Better if the tilapia is breaded first and then pan fried as the fish is very light and difficult to manipulate.  A family favorite when breaded with Progresso Italian breadcrumbs.  Easy recipe also!

Great! Eash and good. I wasn't sure at first but I was willing to try it. Didn't use the capers, Substituted lemon juice for lemons. Add feta cheese flavored with bais and tomato. Mixed the cheese in to thicken sauce and on top of the dish to serve it. Fish of course fell apart, so I gave up trying to keep it together.

The sauce in this dish is fantastic. The only tomotoes I had were cherry tomatoes, so I halved them and they worked fine.  The only difficult part of this recipe is moving the fish from skillet to plate, plate to skillet, then back to plates to serve.  Since the fish is already cooked, it is hard to prevent pieces breaking off.  Still, the flavor is great.  I served this over angel hair pasta which worked well with the great sauce.

Pretty tasty. Again, the capers (I used half of what was called for) add plenty of salt. Black pepper works well.  I adjusted the serving for 10, my family of 5 nearly finished the dish. In my recipe box.

Yummy.  A little salty, but I crave salt.  I made double the recipe and I wanted to eat all the leftovers.  I made no changes..it had a really good tast.  The only downside, was with all the transferring of the fish, it sort of broke up.

Except for the work involved in seeding the tomatoes, this was indeed easy. The 5 year old went back for seconds and there were no leftovers.  The only change I'll make next time is to cut back on the butter, and use 1T butter and 1T soy butter to improve  the healthy status of the sauce.
