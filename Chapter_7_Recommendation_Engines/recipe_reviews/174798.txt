This cake turned out so adorable, and was deceptively simple- I made it for my son's first birthday (he loves ducks) and took the head off so the little one could dig into his "own" cake, while the rest of us ate the body of the cake.  I did use a different frosting recipe that I had ingredients for, and dyed it a light yellow- it turned out so cute, and I was so relieved and thrilled at how it turned out.  (I am NO martha stewart...)
