This is an "almost excellent" recipe!  With just a few minor modifications, it makes an excellent family meal; my husband loved it and my kids (who are very picky eaters) ate it up!  I recommend using four boneless chicken breast halves instead of eight, roasted garlic cream of mushroom soup instead of the regular variety, and water instead of milk.  Also, I cooked this meal in the crock pot on HIGH for five (5) hours (instead of on low for twice that time) - the chicken was moist and the potatoes were soft with just the right amount of sauce (or gravy).  It actually exceeded my expectatons and turned out to be a very flavorful and filling meal!  No leftovers!  :)

My husband and teenagers are picky eaters but loved this recipe because it has their favorites: Chicken and gravy. This is quick and easy to put together, has large inexpensive portions that are not laden with fat. These are my recommendations/changes:
6 split chicken breast, meat carefully removed from bone. Rinse, pat dry.
7 med red potatoes, scrubbed, skin on & cubed (no larger than ¾”)
2 (10.75 oz) cans Campbell’s healthy choice (low fat/sodium) cream of mushroom soup.
1 soup can water (filtered if you have it)
3 heaping tablespoons of the packaged dry onion mix
2 cups fresh green beans (tips removed, beans cut in half)
2 cups baby carrots
Tarragon and garlic powder - divided, sea salt, fresh ground pepper and paprika

Layered ingredients starting with green beans, potatoes, carrots.  Sprinkle over veggies: 1/8 teaspoon Tarragon, pinch of garlic powder, light on the salt & pepper.  Lay chicken pieces over veggies making sure thickest part of chicken points towards crock-pot wall.  

Mix together the 2 cans of soup, 1 can water, 3 tablespoons of dry onion soup, 1/8 tarragon & 1/8 garlic powder.  Salt and pepper to taste.  Pour sauce over chicken & vegetables.  Sprinkle lightly with paprika.

Cook for 5 hours on high making sure after 4 1/2 hrs chicken isn’t already done.  If it is, remove meat and cover to keep warm while veggies continue to cook until tender.

Sorry about the detail – teaching teenagers to cook.

I replaced the cream of mushroom soup with cream of chicken soup (we don't like mushrooms), replaced the milk with 1/2 cup of water, and omitted the cornstarch because I didn't have any on hand. The result was fantastic!! My fiancee had two helpings and raved about this meal for hours!! Thanks, Sarah :)

I use the cream of mushroom soup and onion soup mix to make a wonderful eye round roast in the crockpot - I never add any additional liquid to it or cornstarch and the gravy comes out perfect - lots of compliments, so that's how I made this dish and it also came out perfect.  So, for everyone who finds this recipe bland, omit the milk and cornstarch - it makes all the difference.  If you do want the gravy a little thinner then add no more than 1/4 cup of water.

I made this for dinner and my husband coundn't say enough about how delicious it was, and my VERY fussy girls' backed him right up.  I think there was too much chicken for 4 people and I would use 4 halves instead of 8 next time to make the ratio of chicken to potatoes more even.  Instead of the milk (I used condensed) you could use 2 cans of soup for a thicker sauce but I just added 4 Tbsp. of flour to 4 Tbsp. of melted butter and cooked stirring constantly for a minute until bubbly.  I added to the sauce for the last hour as well as some salt, pepper and sprinkled a layer of nutmeg on the top.  It tasted great and was plenty thick enough for me.

This was really great!  I made some modifications as others suggested - browned chicken in a skillet with garlic, paprika, salt, pepper, and oregano.  I also added these same spices to the sauce.  I used 2 cans cream of chicken and a combination of chicken broth, water, and milk instead of the canned milk. I used 4 large chicken breasts and added carrots, diced onion and fresh mushrooms.  It cooked in 2 1/2 hours on high.  It was kind of soupy so I cut up the chicken and it was a wonderful stew that was good alone and over quick drop biscuits!

We used a bit of advice from other reviews - Cream of chicken soup, water instead of milk - and it turned out excellent!

What a great idea!  I took this base recipe and, like other reviewers, added my own touches.  I made it into more of a stew almost, by adding a sliced onion, 2 carrots cut up, 2 stalks of celery, and some garlic.  To the soup sauce I added basil, old bay, herbs de provence, pepper, and extra can of soup, and about 3/4 c chunked velveeta.  I used only 1 1/2 cans milk, and doubled the cornstarch.  After 3 hrs on low the veggies were still hard, so i cranked it up to high and cooked 2 hrs more.  The bf raved and requested it again SOON!

Great and easy recipe!  I made the mistake of using pre-seasoned chicken, so it was a bit salty - but that was my fault!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a good base recipe.  I added veggies and spices (Herb d'prov. and fine herbs) as well as garlic.  I substituted Mushroom soup for Chicken condensed.  I also used frozen chicken breasts from M&M meats and they turned out soooo tender!  mmmmm.  I turned it on low at 7am and ate at 5 pm.

Ive tried this two ways now.  The first time was by the instructions, it turned out absolutely disgusting and had to throw it all away.  The 2nd way was after reviewing other people's comments...changed it like this:

1 cup water instead of milk
Cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom
5 chicken breasts
Did not add cornstarch.

Now this turned out really well and I'll make it again - but I don't consider this the same recipe, so leaving my rating at 1.

I used 3 FROZEN boneless skinless chicken breasts, stated amount of potatoes, 1/2 package of onion soup mix, 1 can of water and milk mixed together and a heaping TSP of cornstarch.  I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken.  I put it on low for 10 hours (long work day).  My 3yo loved the chicken--my 8yo and I loved the potatoes.  Nice for a comfort food cold winter night!  Thanks!

I put frozen chicken breasts in the slow cooker and cooked on high for 5 hours and replaced the milk with water like other reviewers suggested and deleted the cornstarch altogether. I added a small can of sliced champignons too. Served over pasta spirals...what a hit! My fussy toddlers loved it and licked their bowls! *sigh of relief*

The chicken was SO MOIST! It was flavorful and made a great gravy. I used water instead of milk and started with frozen chicken breasts. I cooked on high for about 4.5 hours.

My "picky eater" family loved this dish! I did brown the chicken in olive oil, 2 cloves minced garlic, 2 tsp Wor. Sauce, and 1 tsp soy sauce. Added onion soup mix, corn starch, mushroom soup and water to pan drippings to make gravey. Sprinkled top of chicken with Thyme leaves. Chicken was very moist and had plenty of gravy. GREAT AROMA!

Wonderful recipe!!  Since I was short on time, I used my toaster oven instead of the crockpot. The chicken breast browned very nicely in a covered roasting pan. Much prettier then the picture. Using 4 large frozen skinless chicken breasts, it was done in about an hour.  I did double the cream soup as recommended by some others. I also added one sliced onion and a few carrots to add additional flavor. Since the mixture was thick as is, I opted to leave the corn starch out.  At the end of the baking time (about l hour), I added some chunks of velveeta cheese to the potatoe mixture. If you like scalloped potatoes...you will love this recipe! Delicious! Thanks for sharing!!

Wonderful and comforting! Have a long week at work so I threw into the crockpot this morning-8 BS chicken breasts and sprinkled them with Mrs Dash. Washed and cubed(didnt peel) 8 potatoes and 5 carrots and one large onion(cut into rings) and layered those on. Plus I had a handful of fresh green beans from the garden so I threw those in. Mixed up one can cream of chicken mushroom and one can cream of celery with one bag of dry onion soup mix and one can water and poured it on. Let it cook on low 10 hrs and came home to a delicious aroma!Will definately make again as the chicken was SOOOOO tender!! THANKS!!

This was delicious. I put in frozen breast tenders, first browned with olive oil, worshitershire sauce and garlic. I used one can of cream of mushroom soup and 1 1/2 cups of chicken broth, and one envelope of Lipton onion & mushroom Soup mix. Mixed it together and put it over chicken, red potatoes, and baby carrots. Let it cook on low all day and it was very juicy and tender. My kids raved about it! YUM!
Thanks!

Pretty darn good!  I scaled it down for two and added a little chicken broth (maybe 1/2 cup) as my crock tends to get a little more hot than I'd like when cooking for a long time.  I started this at 7:30 on low and we ate when I came home by 6:30.  A LONG time cooking but it held up very well.  Will definitely make this one again.

We all loved this recipe.  I made a few changes to this wonderful base recipe.  I seasoned my chicken with Mrs. Dash salt free onion and herbs seasoning and pepper.  I also added some seasoning to the potatoes.  I used 2 cans of garlic cream of mushroom and 1 can low sodium chicken broth.  I used the one package of dry onion soup mix and some Mrs. Dash salt free onion and herb seasoning and pepper.    I used 6 chicken breats as I feed a large family.  We served over home-made biscuits and salad on the side.  My family loved it and I will keep this base recipe and create more variations in the future.  It is nice to have good base recipes like this one so meals never get boring.  We hate boring same ole same ole for supper.

I followed this recipe exactly and while it cooked it smelled so good and we were anxious to try it. I cooked it exactly like called for. However, we were so very disappointed. My husband and I could not even finish eating it--it was bland and we tried to doctor it up with a little pepper and some salt to no avail. My father who does not have a sense of taste anymore liked it because of the texture. I can not figure out what went so wrong after reading other reviews this seems to be the exception.

This was a nice dinner for a cold night. It was filling and comforting, but I wouldn't call it flavorful. I added some carrots for some veggies. It made a lot of food (and I only used 6 chicken breasts). Next time I will add more seasoning.

Love this recipe! One of my faves to use when time is short. I put potatoes and chicken in the crockpot (either breasts or tenders), leave the skins on the potatoes, and use either mushroom or cream of chicken soup. The cornstarch really doesn't make that much of a difference. I let this cook all day on low, and the chicken just falls apart. I actually like to cook brown rice as a side dish, which is great with the gravy. We serve green beans or peas as a veggie, and I have happy campers. I've read other reviews where they think the flavor is lacking, but I think it's just right. Oniony but not overpowering. Anything any stronger would turn my husband and kids right off. This is great inexpensive, easy, pretty healthy dinner for a busy family! Thanks!

Very tasty!  I used 2 cans of soup, added some baby carrots and mushrooms, and baked the whole thing in two pastry crusts.  Makes yummy pot pie!

This was a good,basic recipe, but I did think it was a bit bland. That might be primarily because I prefer a little more "zip" in flavor, but it was a solid and easy recipe. Smelled good while cooking. Might make it again, but adding some spice...

Very simple recipe.  I used thighs and legs (which I seasoned with a little salt, pepper and garlic powder) and instead of cream of mushroom soup I used cream of chicken. I also replaced the milk with chicken broth. The chicken fell right off the bone.

After I saw all the rave reviews I thought I had to try this one out.  It was nothing great at all.  In fact, we'll never cook it again.  It was more like a soup, but the chicken was too done and there wasn't enough flavor.  I even added spices, carrots, onions and garlic like some reviews stated.  Also, it just had too many calories with adding the soup.  If I was going to make a chicken soup I'd just use some water and the onion soup mix.

Used cream of chicken soup and only 1/2 cup of milk so I didn't have to use the cornstarch.  I also added some garlic powder and chives to bump up the taste (bland).

Good, but standard.  The standard combination of onion soup and mushroom soup.  Not for those watching sodium intake!

I'm giving this 5 stars for two reasons, it's easy and my picky family liked it.  I have two toddlers (1 & 3), they both ate this eagerly and that is no easy feat!  I doubled the recipes for the gravy and that worked out great.  I made white rice for the kids and used the gravy for the rice (since they don't like potatos).  My husband enjoyed it with the potatos.  Oh and have some bread or biscuits with this to sop up the gravy.  Next time I think I'll add carrots to it.  Thanks Julia for the great, easy recipe!

This recipe was very easy and delicious. I didn't have cream of mushroom soup so I used cream of chicken instead. I also used regular milk instead of canned milk. My family absolutely loved this recipe! Thanks for sharing it!

This was great and it had alot of flavor! I read the reviews before making this so I used 2 cans of cream of chicken soup and there was pleanty of gravy. I also doubled the corn starch but not the milk if I had it would have been to runny. I also added carrots like other reviews stated. Over all it was very good my whole family like it!

I think this dish is exactly what it claims to be--"an easy, one dish meal".  I found it to be very tasty, not bland at all.  In fact I was worried it would be too salty due to the onion soup, but it was perfect.  I didn't have potatoes, so omitted those, but added some frozen broccoli for the last 15 minutes of cook time.  I only used 2 chicken breasts and they were done in 3-1/2 hours on low.  Perfect--tender and juicy.  Ate it over white rice and it was great.  I would make this again.

I fixed this meal for the first time this afternoon for my family.  We were all very impressed.  It was delicious.  I made a few modifications baecause of other reviews.  I used skinless, boneless, thighs.  I added pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder to the chicken before putting  in the crock.  I  also used 1/2  cans of water instead of the can of milk, and pot 6   meduim  potatoes.  Also cooked it  on high for  4 hrs. Next time I will put 10 thighs since there were very little left overs.  Thanx for the post

Blecch.  The sauce curdled, and the potatoes were a funny consistency.  It was also way too salty.  Won't make this again.

Since my boys hate mushrooms, I used cream of chicken soup instead.  As dinnertime approached, the sauce seemed a little thin, so I added another can of soup, more milk and another packet of onion soup mix.  My husband loved it, but the kids weren't too crazy about it.

OMG its so delicious!I know people makes alot of comments on how we change the orginal recipe.I do it because if I have food in the house I would rather add it into whatever I make or else I waste it.Anyways,I read other peoples reviews as well and love it.So what I did to this recipe is I boiled my chicken first as to me putting raw food into micro or slow cooker Im not comfortable cooking with it.So,i layer my  4 chicken on bottom,sprinkle all seasoning,garlic and pepper on it.Then of course I added my red,orange,yellow and green peppers plus onions on top of chicken and baby carrots.Then I mixed mushroom soup,a little bit of water and the rest with chicken broth to make 1/2 cp then I added the cornstarch and dry onion soup.Mixed it up and then poured it on top of chicken.Cooked on slow and now Im enjoying this delicious meal...Thanks so much for the recipe..I will make it again...

I decided to change this up a bit for a different spin. I omitted the potatoes and added fresh mushrooms(sliced) and fresh garlic to the ingredients. cooked on High for 4.5 hours and then spooned the finished product over mashed potatoes! Aaaaaaaamazing! :)

This was VERY good! I'm a busy mom that works fulltime and has two young children in school/daycare so I loved being able to throw everything into crockpot in morning. Cooked on low from 7am-6pm. I did use water instead of milk since I didn't have much on hand. The only thing I would add next time is carrots as well. We served over toast.

I also used cream of chicken soup and exchanged the milk for water. Everyone loved it, even my son who is in culinary school. He usually only like food that uses many ingredients. He was impressed something so simple was so good!

This was yummy on a rainy cold day. I doubled the cream of mushroom, used water instead of milk, and added some garlic. I plan on using the leftover gravy for mashed potatoes tomorrow!

We all really enjoyed this!  I made it with red potatoes but I think I might try it with rice or egg noodles next.

I forgot the cornstarch, which is a MUST in this recipe.  I used Campbell's Healthy Request Cream of Mushroom, for less sodium and fat, and used 1 T. chicken bouillon in place of the onion soup mix.  I also tossed in a little dried minced onion, garlic powder, and season salt.  I sliced the potatoes thin, instead of cubing them, and this allowed them and the chicken to cook in only 6 hours on low.  This recipe is simple and delicious, will definitely make it again!

Not my favorite.  5 stars for ease of preparation.  Flavor - not so much.  Made it as listed.  It smelled good when I came home, we just didn't care for the overall flavor of the dish.  Not really willing to tweak it to try to make it better.

Very good!  I had no onion soup mix, so I "souped it up" with garlic powder, pepper, a bit of cayanne and a sliced onion.  Don't let other reviews make you afraid of the milk.  I actually used heavy cream and a bit of chicken stock. I used new red potatoes because they needed to be cooked, and left them whole.  Perfect after 4 hours on high. Thanks, Julia!

Super easy.  I threw 4 frozen chicken breasts in the crockpot with quartered potatoes, a can of chicken gravy, a half can of water mixed with the onion soup mix and turned it to med-high for 5 hours.  When it was almost ready, it still seemed soupy, so I added some flour mixed with water to thicken it up.  Smelled and tasted delicious.

I think this recipe is better without the combination of dry onion soup, milk, and cream soup.  Maybe omit the milk and substitute chicken broth.  Will try that next time.

This recipe was very easy and tasted good.  My husband liked it.  The potatoes tasted great after sitting in the slow cooker all day!  I cooked mine on low for 8 hours and I think maybe I could have cooked for an hour or two less.  The chicken didn't even taste like chicken because it was so tender it was more like a beef stew!

Wow! I was amazingly impressed. I was in a rush yesterday morning heading out to work but I wanted to throw something together for supper, so I didn't follow the quantities I just threw it all in the slow cooker along with pepper, a dash of bay leaves, cayenne pepper and parsley. And my husbnad added some shredded cheddar cheese and I swear it was the best meal I've ever made. I had it on High for about 3 hours and then on Low for another 5 or 6 and the chicken was so incredibly tender. WOW. definitely going to make that again. I ate it with the potatoes but my husband doesn't like them so he had his over rice. Delicious!

I thought this was really tasty, but I did change things up a bit. There are only the 2 of us so I started out with 2 frozen, boneless, skinless chicken breasts. I browned them on both sides in a skillet with some olive oil and seasonings.(pepper, worchestershire sauce and garlic powder)  I cut chicken into bitesized pieces, & then popped the cubed potatoes and chicken in the crock pot. I put the cream of mushroom soup, milk, and onion soup mix (I did not use the cornstarch)in the skillet that I had browned the chicken in and stired it until it was well blended.   Poured this over the chicken and potatoes, turned the crock pot on high. Five hours later we dined on this, with peas and carrots, and light rolls. Thanks, Julia, for a great recipe!

I did not use milk, I used 1 1/4 can water, I also used 2 cans of garlic cream of mushroom soup, I added one whole onion, and one half bag, baby carrots, could have used whole bag of carrots, I also used creole spice - generous amount, and 2-4 tablespoons of cornstarch to help thicken sauce, I also used chicken thighs with bones and the meat came right off the bone.  This was so good and had the whole apt smelling delicious, the neighbors and I enjoyed thoroughly, please take my suggestions to heart, this was awesome.

This is a delicious recipe - I did a little changing.  I used 4 chicken breasts and added a can of drained green beans (kitchen cut) and a bunch of baby carrots.  I cooked it for about 8 hours on setting 2 of my slow cooker which was just a little above low.  I will make this again and again as it was SUPER GOOD.

This recipe was so easy and quick to make, but my husband and I loved it.  I am a schoolteacher and I definitely plan to make this again during the school year when I am short on time! I only added 1/2 a package of onion soup mix, but next time I will add the whole thing to have more flavor. I also liked that I could only use 4 chicken breasts and less potatoes and carrots to make it smaller for two people.

Wonderful. It was great over rice or noodles. I have modified this all kinds of ways. Great as-is or as a base. Try 1/2 cup white wine or a Zinfandel instead of milk.
Also great with small green trees in in it. (Broccoli)

I don't know how anyone would not like this.  My husband and toddler devoured it!  I used only 4 breasts, added some garlic/pepper/parsley/paprika, and omitted the cornstarch.  I also added potatoes and carrots to the cooker first.  I then threw in some frozen peas about an hour before serving.  It was a delicious meal.  I just added a salad and some bread - voila, tasted great and was easy! Since I have become a mom the slow cooker has become my very good friend, lol.  Thanks for the post!

This was very easy and good!  I used about 4 split chicken breasts, and reduced the fat by using skim milk and reduced fat cream of chicken soup.  I served it over rice.  Will be making again!

This is a great recipe.  True comfort food!  I modified slightly and added Cream of Chicken soup for half the Mushroom soup and added  onion slices to the chicken and potatoes.  I also used Red potatoes which added a little color to the dish!  It was very declicious.

DH liked it. I thought it was okay, the potatos were salty from the onion soup mix. I cut the chicken breast into chunks instead of leaving them whole, added some garlic powder and I added about a cup of fat-free sour cream an hour before I served it. I didn't have cornstarch so I mixed milk and flour to thicken it. I will probably make it again, but not that often.

I like the boldness of adding something different to the mix, however I found this stew lacking the flavor I thought it would have. It came out kind of bland for my taste, but I agree it definitely has potential.  I think with a little tweeking this could be an excellent slow cooker recipe.

this was good but was missing a little something. I did add some frozen peas to it when it was done (about 2 cups) for a veggie also. I think next time I will add 1/2 tsp salt and 1/4 tsp pepper and maybe a cup of fresh mushrooms as well. Tasty but needs a little help.

My fiance and I both really enjoyed this one.  It was very similar to a casserole I used to make.  I did make a few changes.  I used cream of chicken soup instead of mushroom, and I only put in two chicken breasts (there were only two of us eating) so there was plenty of gravy.  Along with the potatoes, I added 3 cloves of garlic, carrots, broccoli, and frozen corn.  It was a little soupy and the sauce needed to be stirred a bit at the end.  Right before I served it, i melted a couple spoonfuls of sour cream into it... made a really hearty stew!  My Fiance wanted some rice or bread to sop up the sauce thoguh.  I ate it with a spoon

Well after reading the reviews and suggestions I came up with my own little version and it seemed to satisfy everyone's palate at my house.  First I took some flour and added about a teaspoon of sage, some garlic powder, onion powder and just a dash of salt and pepper and dredged the chicken in that before browning it in a skillet for just a minute or two on each side.  I also went with the suggestion of using water in place of the milk and only used 3/4 cup with no cornstarch.  I cooked it on high for about 2 hours then cooked it on low for about 4-5 hours.  The chicken was nice and tender and the potatoes were just right.  The only thing I would change in this method is maybe adding some of the seasonings directly to the chicken and letting it sit in the refrigerator overnight so that the meat absorbs the flavors.  To me the chicken was kind of bland in the "middle" but everyone else in my household loved it.  I don't think I have much choice but to cook it again, but next time I'll do a little more experimenting to infuse the flavors into the meat.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

It made the house smell great, but the taste was only ok.  It was mushy and not appealing to look at.  I don't think I'll make this again.  I used 4 chicken breasts.

When cooking this, it was way too thick--I added water after about 6 hours. I didn't think it was bland like other folks, but maybe it's because I cut my chicken up into pieces. My husband liked it and had two helpings. I, on the other hand, couldn't eat it. I didn't like the consistency of the potatoes, and the sauce was kind of over-powering.

This was a very good meal.  Easy to make and smelled wonderful the whole day in the slow cooker.  The only thing is that my husband and I decided that next time we would add a little more milk and make it more of a soup instead.  That is because it lacked the makings of a "meal".  But it was super and the left overs were great as well!  Thanks for sharing!

I had company coming and wanted something in a hurry so tried this.  It was okay, but I hoped it would be better. The sauce curdled and the chicken was somewhat dry.  Probably would not make it again.

i already had chicken and potatoes in the crockpot when i went searching for a way to use them for dinner tonight. i made a changed a couple things, but it's basically the same thing.
i used cream of chicken instead of cream of mushroom and mushroom gravy instead of onion, because that's what i had!
i used about one cream of chicken can full of water, instead of the milk.
i thought it was an okay recipe, we used it over rice and sprinkled cheese on top. i dont know how often i'll make this recipe though.

I didn't think this recipe had enough flavor to it. I also used cr. of chick because I didn't have any cr. of mush. I used drumstick, instead of breast. I don't think any of the changes would have made a difference to the amount of flavoring.

i made this and used cream of chicken soup with water.there really was no need for the corn startch it thickend fine without it. i didnt think it had much flavor and  wasnt real crazy about the potatoes with noodles ,could used some veggies. this was very easy to make and was ok. if i made it again i would add some veggies, take out the potatoes and serve over mash potatoes.

I made this for the first time today, and my family LOVES it ! I did substitute the milk with the same amount of water, added more potatoes, and at the last 2 hours, added  mixed frozen veggies... It came out like a Chicken Pie recipe would and the next time I will be adding biscuits or dumplings to the top :)  I am delighted with this recipe, thanks Julia !!!!!

the chicken and potatoes were tender. I used chicken broth instead of water and cream of chicken soup cause that's what I had. I added garlic, oregano and basil per some other reviewers. I wish I had omitted the onion soup it made it very salty.

So simple and we loved the flavor! My two and a half year old is pretty selective about what he'll eat, and he loved this. I did cut the chicken breasts into pieces and used water instead of milk. I also used 5 red potatoes instead of 4 regular. And finally I put it in the crock pot on high for 4 1/2 hrs instead of low for twice the time. The gravy/sauce is especially good. Yum!

Great Recipe!  I took it down to 6 chicken breast, and replaced the milk with chicken broth.  Also added two carrots, adobo and fresh garlic.  Was a big hit.  This receipe will make another appearance at my table for sure =)

Very good!  I cooked 4 chicken breasts on low for 7 1/2 hours. Chicken was cooked perfectly, and broke apart while serving.  I served this in bowls over rice.    I added 1 tablespoon of minced garlic, some paprika and parsley.  Also added 1 can green beans 1 hour prior to serving.  I would defiantly recommend adding a vegetable to this dish.

Delicious and easy.  I have modified this recipe to make a low-cal/lowfat recipe by adding fat-free soup and also make the original version.  My family and I find both versions to be delicious.  My picky children love this recipe and it's one I make quite frequently.  Five stars!

I used cubed thigh fillets to make it more economical. Next time I will halve the amount of milk and add white pepper and dried tarragon for the last 20 mins of cooking as it was a little bland.

I tried this lazily because I wanted dinner done by the time we got home from work. At lunch I went home to put it together. I used chicken legs seasoned with garlic & herb mrs dash and pepper, added chopped garlic cloves and didn't use potatos. Mixed the onion soup with crm of mushroom before adding the milk and then a can of mushrooms and some more spices. It came out pretty good, I will definatley stick to the recipe next time and use boneless chicken breasts (or thighs) as it would have a better flavor I think. It made a really good gravy thickened with corn starch. (I didn't add starch to the crock pot.) Served with instant potatos and green beans. Great quick and easy meal! After getting home, dinner was on the table in 10 minutes! Leftover chicken and gravy will be made into a casserole with stove top and mashed potatos for another quick and easy weeknight meal. I love it when good meals can be easily made and leftovers used up to make the second night easy as well. Thanks for this this one!

This was good, but a little bland. Next time I would follow the recommendations of those that used more seasonings. I used sliced baby red potatoes, and they cooked nicely. I also added sliced onions AND the onion soup mix, and only used 1.5 pounds of boneless skinless chicken breast. The family did like it. My picky children at it right up!

Oh, it's easy, alright! It's also tasteless. I can't think of what one could do to make this edible, Goodness knows I tried everything I could think of. One problem is I think it cooks for too long. While the chicken was tender, that's all I could say for it. I tried adding spices, veggies, salt, worchestershire sauce - nothing seemed to help. Might be good for nursing home patients but if your tastebuds still work and you have your own teeth, skip this .

I also did the cream of chicken/water combo.  Turned out great!!  I make new recipes ALL the time, and this was one my husband said, be sure to keep that one!  One note, the chicken breasts do shrink up quite a bit, I used 4 large breasts cut in half and it was just enough for dinner and about one meal leftover.

Not a fan of this one...it kind of turned mushy with not alot of flavor.  I think if I would have left out the potatoes and just did the chicken with a few more spices it might have been a good gravy on mashed potatoes.

The family enjoyed this...so did I because it's so easy. I used a small packet of chicken boullion instead of dry onion soup mix because that's what I had on hand. To get the onion flavor I added one medium chopped onion. I also left out the potatoes so I could make mashed potatoes. And I used 3/4 can water 1/4 can milk instead. Very tasty over mashed potatoes...this one is a keeper for us! Thanks for sharing.

I thought it was very good...I used 4 chicken breasts. I did first brown in olive oil with fresh garlic and added a bit of soy and worchester sauce. I added 1/2 a bag of baby carrots to the crock pot instead of the potatoes. I baked potatoes in the microwave and used the extra sauce from the crock pot as a gravy! I would make it again!

I followed the recipe exactly as originally stated. Not good at all. I wish I would'nt have used the canned milk. The sauce separated. Maybe use the variaions other people suggest and it might be better. Sorry!

Tasty! I didn't measure anything, just threw the chicken, potatoes, carrots, and onions into the crockpot along with a mixture of a can each of cream of chicken and cream of mushroom soups, most of a can of milk, a bit of water, and a bunch of spices. (No cornstarch or onion mix.)  It turned out to be more like a gravy-ish soup, but my husband and I really enjoyed it that way. Next time I plan to cut the chicken into small pieces and keep everything else the same.  Yum!

My family LOVED this.  Especially the sauce, we saved the leftover sauce for dunking bread, crackers, anything whatsoever in.  I used one can cream/mushroom and then used the can to measure 1 can of heavy whipping cream, instead of cornstarch & canned milk (or water like other users suggested).  Mixed in the soup mix, added frozen chicken, chopped potatoes (skin on) and sprinkled basil on top.  Yum!  Might try adding green beans next time; not carrots, afraid it will take away from the flavor.

This recipe was in fact extremely easy.  The chicken was good and very tender.  Unfortunately the chicken fell apart.  The recipe was also a bit bland. Next time I will probably cook for less time and add some garlic when cooking.

I did change few things. First I used hen, rather then chicken breasts, then I seasoned it with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and oldbay. Then with 3 table spoon of olive oil, I then browned the chicken on all sides, before putting to my crockpot. I added 2 large carrots and 3 cloves of garlic. I read other posts, and I too used cream of chicken. Cooked it on low for 7 hours, and it's fabulous!! I'd give it 10 stars if I could!!

I used 4 chicken breast, half a can of milk, and no corn starch (only because I didn't have any). It was good but a little bland but it wasn't anything a little salt and pepper couldn't fix. I also put in carrots and than put it all over rice at the end. My husband really liked it, and he's picky! I too liked it and will be making it again. It reminds me of a country home cooked meal.  :)

I thought this recipe was a little salty and very oniony, however some might like that.  I didn't use water and used milk instead and thought it was fine.  Chicken was tender and I added mini carrots and a can of real mushrooms too.  Overall, quite good.

This was an EXCELLENT recipe after a few modifications based on other's reviews.  I omitted the milk/cornstarch and 2 chicken breasts.  Instead used a 26oz can cream of chicken soup w/10oz water.  I also added fried onions the last hour of cooking.

Great recipe overall! Took others advice: no cornstarch, instead of milk - used 1/2 cup water, no potatoes, and 4 chicken breasts are plenty. Cooked for six hours - a little dry, will cook for 4hours next time. Made the house smell great while cooking, and my husband loved it! Will make again, was very easy to put together.

Not thrilled with this.  It was okat but nothing special.  Reminded me of the chicken and rice recipes on the rice or soup containers only that tastes better.

This was ok but not outstanding. I was a little skeptical of the onion soup mix because I thought it would turn out too salty but it wasn’t. I only added a 1/4 cup water. It could have used more. The soup was a little dry around the edges of the crockpot. I would make it again adding more liquid.

I made this and was pleased with the results. It was easy and tasty. Chicken was tender. I cooked on low for 9. 1/2- 10 hrs.  The last hour I added green beans. 

Only question I have is why in this picture there is pasta noodles? It does not call for rotini or any pasta. My guess is that’s someone  substituted pasta for the potatoes.

YUM!  Made this for dinner and the chicken was so tender and the gravy? WOW. Used a can of cream of mushroom, can cream of potato and dry onion soup with herbs. For the liquid I used a can of chicken broth instead of milk or water. This will go in my recipe rotation for sure.

I was very disappointed in this dish.  I am not sure why it turned so bad, but it was not edible.  The chicken was dry and the overall flavor was unpleasant.

This is kind of like a chicken stew. Good meal for a cold winter day. I added an extra can of cream of mushroom soup because 1 can didn't look like it would be enough, but it turned out to be too much. I added some fresh green beans for veggies, which was good and served it as is with freshly baked bread.

I am not sure if I cooked it too long...but I did find that the chicken was dry.  I wish that I had served it earlier because the sauce looked really good.  So I admit that the dryness could be related to my own preparation, but ultimately my success with this dish was limited.

Very easy, quick and tasty meal. Replaced the milk with water, as others suggested. I don't know why people changed it so much. Tasted good to me as is. Served with rice. Will definitely make it again.

It was easy to make but it was very bland.  It reminded me of something that my mom would make in the 80s that was bland and life-less.  I even tried to punch it up a little but to no avail.  It is the first time that my husband asked me to through away the left overs so that he didn't have to take them to work.

Very good, very easy meal that satisfied the whole family including 4 semi-picky kids!  Used 5 skinless/boneless chicken breasts, 4 potatoes cubes, 1/2 cup water, cream of chicken soup, cornstarch and 1 packet onion soup mix.  Cooked on high for 5 hrs and turned out great!  Also made a side of white rice for the kids as they don't eat potatoes.

I tried this recipe, and it was ok.  If you are watching your sodium intake, I do not recommend this recipe as it was too salty.  If I make it again, I will omit the onion soup mix or just use half the package.  Thank you.

I thought this was okay when I made it, but it was GREAT the next day! My husband loved it so I will make it again, but next time I will serve it the next day. I also added more shredded cheddar cheese on top. I served it over pasta, the cheese sauce was nice and thick.

excellent recipe!  The family loved it.  I didn't have boneless chicken so I used two whole cut up fryers and omitted the potatoes.  I was also out of canned milk and substituted approx 1-1/4 cup 2% milk.  I added Red pepper flakes to give it a kick.  Definitely a repeat at our house.

This was very yummy! I used a pack of drums ans thighs I had in the fridge and added 1 onion chopped in big pieces. And since I didn't have any soup mix on hand, I subbed 1 teaspoon of onion powder, 1 teaspoon of garlic powder and 3 chicken boullion cubes. I also added 1 tablespoon of dried ground chipotle pepper. That added a great kick! Thanks for the recipe, will definitely make it again!

I used less chicken like other reviewers suggested, but stuck with the cream of mushroom soup (even though most of my family doesn't like mushrooms).  Not only couldn't they tell, they loved it.

Very good recipe. I didn't use the cornstarch and I changed cream of mushroom to cream of chicken only because I don't like mushroom. Everyone liked it.

I made a few changes (no cornstarch, broth instead of milk, cream of chicken & cream of mushroom soups when doubling the recipe). I will make this again and add carrots.

I followed some of the suggestions given in other reviews.  My husband loved it.  I served it with a hunk of brown bread.  A big hit!

Good Start, but lacks a little flavor. Needs to be served over something such as rice.

The flavor was unusually good for a canned soup base dish. This is certainly not something I would serve guests but my husband and I enjoyed it for a comforting winter day dinner. I baked this dish in the oven instead of the slow cooker and it was fine.

I made this and thought it was going to be good, but it was awful.  The onion soup mix made it far too salty and it was very unappetizing and bland looking -  my kids wouldn't even touch it.  Might be better over rice, but I don't think so.  I won't make this again.

Personally I didn't think it was that great but I give it five stars because my family loved it. I doubled all tne sauce ingredients because we are real gravy people and it was the perfect amount. I will make this again for the family.

I cooked the chicken thighs in the slow cooker with chicken broth, then shredded the chicken. I omitted the potatoes, and cooked carrots separately.  I served mixed with egg noodles.  Very yummy!!

i had to add a can of water to get more liquid on the potatoes and used my own seasonings instead of the dry soup mix and it was wonderful.

This recipe lacked flavor and sauce to eat with the chicken.  I think I should have doubled the canned soup to make it creamier.

On the plus side, the chicken and potatoes turned out very tender and perfectly done. However, the onion soup pack in here just did not work. I have cooked with the packets for seasoning before (beef pot roast, etc) and have loved it, but somehow (maybe the milk? chicken? potatoes?) in here the taste was overpowering. I could not finish my portion the first meal, but still saved the rest. I just tried some leftover, and the flavor has mellowed - hopefully, I can manage to eat the rest and not waste 4lbs of chicken breast. Most everyone else on here seems to enjoy this - all I can say is if you try it, be very guarded with the seasoning.

I changed this recipe so much, that I dont even know if I should rate it. I didnt have any onion packets so I just added 1 real onion. I didnt have any mushroom soup, so I added turkey gravy and a can of chedder cheese, instead of the milk I added 1 can of chicken broth, I did not add corn starch, but instead just salt and pepper. I also added fresh green beans and a can of peas and carronts. I cooked it for 5 hours instead of the 8 hrs, and it was just perfect.I served it with homemade bread. The whole family loved it. Everyone asked me where I got the recipe!

I didn't care for this recipe. My husband doesn't care for mushrooms so I used cream of celery soup mix instead. Maybe that was the problem. Anyhow, he didn't mind it but I didn't care for it.

I took the advice of others and used 4 chicken breasts, did not add milk, I added 1/2 c. water, and omitted the cornstarch.  I think it was delicious.  Served with corn.  Next time I will make stuffing as well becauase it reminded me of a nice Thanksgiving dinner.

This was excellent.  Very quick and easy.  I used chicken broth instead of milk and added carrots. I browned the chicken in a skillet with some salt, pepper, onion powder, and paprika prior to putting in the crock pot.  This helps seal in the juices and gives the chicken a little more color and flavor.  Thanks for the recipe. :-)

Like other reviewers, I added a can of cream of chicken soup and a bit more milk.  I also used a whole chicken, cut up and skinned, and added a couple potatoes and carrots, cubed.  This is going on our family's favorite list. Great flavor, and super tender.  Ended up a bit soupy, so we had some crusty bread with it... Great meal!

My family all liked this recipe and said it is a keeper.  My chicken was larger pieces, so I added 1 can crm/mush and 1 can crm/chicken soups and 1 1/2 cans milk. The smell of this cooking was awesome.  Very good recipe.

This was pretty good. Very filling. I as well only used 4 chicken breasts. I did think it was really a bit to creamy so I will try the water next time and the garlic mushroom soup sounds like a great idea. Thanks julia.

I use a recipe like this for beef stew meat. But all I use is the cream of mushroom soup, onion soup mix and about 1/2 cup of cognac (or sherry). It is amazing! This was good too with just the same ingredients and chicken and potatoes.

I can't describe it, but it just lacked something to me.  The chicken was very tender, but it didn't have much flavor at all.  The potatoes were very good though.  My husband liked it, but  I just thought it was ok---maybe i'll try it again with some more seasoning or something.

Pretty good. Try adding cilantro, mushroom, and french-fried onion for the last 30 min.

Good stuff. I do the cooking at home and the wife loved it.  I did use Cream of chicken instead of the mushroom, but overall will make again.

Thanks,
Phil

I have a huge family and cook all the time. My kids did not like this recipe at all and they are a brave bunch in trying new recipes. I did not care for it. First it did curtle as some of the the other reviewers as but did not think it was possible so tried the recipe anyway. It is too rich. Maybe water or broth as a subtitude would help or low fat milk. I like the concept of this meal as a warm winter comfort meal but I for the life of me peddle the left overs. It went to the trash which in my house is rare. I wasted several chicken breasts. This recipe needs some serious improvements.

This was a good, basic meal....smells great while cooking.  I did add some extra spices (adobo and a packet of Sazon) to give it a little extra zip.  I'll use this again, as it is an easy dinner to make in a time crunch.  Thank you, Julia

Not too impressed. Used cream of celery - cuz I hate cream of mushroom. Didn't do well with that either. Probably won't cook again.
