Very pronounced lavender flavor with a pretty pink color!! My kitchen smelled like aromatherapy during and afterwards! I used dried organic culinary lavender (which I ordered over the internet). It seemed that the lavender flavor was even more pronounced the following day. To make 1 cup of lemon juice I used about 7 lemons.

This is way too much sugar. I had to fill the rest of the 2 qt pitcher up to dilute it and it's still way too sugary. Great concept, though. I used lavender leaves instead of flowers and 1/4 cup reconstituted lemon juice since I had no fresh on hand. Next time, I think I'll cut the sugar in half, add a little more lemon juice, and enough water to fill a 2 qt pitcher.

Delish lemonade.  Loved the addition of lavender.  However, had to adjust the amount of sugar used since I thought it was a little tart.  Overall, received rave reviews from friends.

Great inspiration, but way too much lavender. A full cup of flowers for only 5 cups of liquid made it very "perfumey" and even somewhat soapy tasting. Tried again with about a 1/4 of a cup and it was much better.

Yum!  I made the full recipe with 1/2 cup of lavendar flowers but they were homegrown which are stronger than most. I made sure to muddle the lavendar in the hot water and squeeze all the lavendar flavor out of the 1/2 cup.  Thanks!

The only thing I had to alter was the amount of lavender. After reading some of the reviews I went ahead and only used 1/2 the amount of lavender and it turned out perfectly! Also, while the lavender is steeping don't be worried if the color looks blue/green. As soon as you pour it into the lemonade it will turn pink, I promise! Great recipe, I will definitely make it again!

It's way too much lavender.  I added another cup of water and filled the pitcher with ice.  Then added 2 tablespoon of honey and it tasted better.  But still to me, it is still too much lavender flowers and yes, I used organic culinary used lavender flowers.

This was gross. I used dried organic lavender flowers ordered from Amazon.  Cut the lavender in half based on other reviewers suggestions, added more water, sugar, and STILL tasted like soap.

So good!  Seriously so easy.  I went out back snipped some lavender, plucked a couple Meyer lemons, 15 minutes later voila!! I only added 1/2 cup sugar only because I know my lemons are quite sweet.  Some local honey would be a great add too!

WAAAAAY too much sugar.  We used 1.5 cups for a double batch and it's still a bit on the sweet side.  Fresh lavender did well, but the lemons we picked from our yard were a bit strong; if you're using fresh lemons, maybe water the end result down a bit, like and extra half cup to a cup more of water.  Added two drops of blue food coloring, because vanity.

I would gladly made this again;however,I feel that using lavender essential oil( 1 drop)that is appropriate for ingestion could suffice as well.

I made a double batch but kept the original amount of lavender and used even less sugar than the original recipe called for.  Quite very, very delicious!
