I made this fish dish with a beautiful halibut fillet.  If I were to make again, I would replace the oranges with limes, or at least a more tart orange to punch up the citrusy goodness. Overall very enjoyable.

Very good taste on the marinade. Did let the fillets sit on it for two hours. The flavors were amazing and the fish was very tender. I used the ingredients and did the steps without modification. Will definitely make again!

My cod was  a little tough.  Not as flavorful as I had hoped for.

We used black bean sauce instead of soy sauce and it made a thicker layer of marinade.  Delicious!

Just okay. I did NOT alter this recipe at all. I marinated mine for 2 hrs. It was lacking a lot of flavor. I will not make this again.

Tasty,  easy,  quick.   Added a little sesame oil.
