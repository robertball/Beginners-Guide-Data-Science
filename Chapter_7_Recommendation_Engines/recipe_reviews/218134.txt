I used two packages of reduced fat cream cheese. Other than that, I made no other changes. Oh man. This is DELICIOUS. GREAT with homemade pita chips.

This recipe was sent out in one of Allrecipes' newsletters, and since we were invited to an evening gathering of neighbors for appetizers and drinks, having all the ingredients on hand I thought I'd give it a try.  After a very quick and easy prep, I had a delicious cheese spread that was great with a variety of crackers, and everyone enjoyed it!

Delightful summer dip with fresh basil from the garden.  Great on Pretzel Thins or a nutty-flavored cracker.  Enjoyed by adults and teens.

At first I thought this was a bit bland, but the basil flavor really developed after a few hours in the fridge.  I'll make it in advance next time.  Nice recipe, thanks :)

My family thought this was a bit sweet and felt like it was missing something. I think with the addition of some parmesan cheese it would be a winner for us.

I made it first time and do away with the nuts. It was great! It's easy to make and I love the taste.

Tried it, but thought it was very heavy. Could have been because I added a handful of Mexican style cheese. Also, did not have the self rising flour, so followed previous reviewers hints on how to make my own. Probably wont try again!
