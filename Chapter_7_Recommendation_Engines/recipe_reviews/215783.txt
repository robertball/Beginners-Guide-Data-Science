Quiet and understated, yet full of fresh flavor - the perfect  side dish for our Chicken Cordon Bleu. Attractive too.  Added fresh minced garlic, butter along with the olive oil, and fresh parsley rather than dried.  Loved it.

Loved it!  Used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil to saute the onions and zucchini.  I added about 1 tablespoon of garlic to the onions after the onions cooked about 3 minutes.  I also added a couple of teaspoons of grated lemon zest along with the parsley at the end.  Really nice, fresh flavor.  For those of you who found this to be bland, adding the garlic & lemon zest really does add a lot of flavor.  Next time I will only make 8 ounces of orzo, as I had a lot left over (I could see it was too much compared to the onion/zucchini mixture - so I left a good bit out, which is fine, because I can use this in another dish.  Maybe a nice orzo salad).  This one's a keeper!

This was good.  It has a very mild flavor and would pair best with something more boldly flavored.  Although I was reasonably pleased with my results, I do think this recipe is poorly written.  First off, what is the point of putting the cooked and drained orzo in a large saucepan?  Why dirty another pan?  Secondly, my zucchini were done in 8 minutes; they would have turned to mush after 15 minutes.  And the volume of food this recipe produces would surely feed way more than 4 people.  I reduced the amount of orzo significantly, using only about a third of the amount indicated.  I also tossed in a pat of butter when adding the final seasonings.

This was really nice, but light on flavor like many said. I started out by following the recipe exactly but then added 1tbsp worcestershire sauce to add flavor. I didn't love that with this so I will try another flavor boosting idea next time. Oh and I added minced garlic.  I had mine with season salted added, DH added parmesan cheese to his. We'll try it again though - we didn't hate it, just needs a boost.

Needed more flavor. Suggest adding salt and pepper earlier, then, when done, topping with Parmesan cheese. Another possibility is to add soy or Worcester sauce for more flavor.

This recipe was very bland as-is. I suggest making it the day before to let the flavors blend. I added lemon juice and zest,  a good amount of sea salt, and some dried oregano and basil which gave more flavor.

I thought this was excellent!  I could see myself using what ever veggies are on hand in the future, but the Vidalia onion was perfect.
The veggies to orzo ratio was off, I will scale back the orzo to maybe a half cup next time.
I put a splash of lemon juice on each serving but Parmesan would work too.  Depends on the mood.  This is a light side dish, it complemented our grilled salmon perfectly.

This recipe was delicious as made, but I agree with another reviewer that it was poorly written. I used similar proportions of ingredients (cut back on the orzo), added garlic and chicken stock, and only used 1 pan. I sautéed the onion in 1 Tbsp olive oil and 1 Tbsp butter until translucent. Added 3 garlic cloves, minced, and sautéed until fragrant. Added the squash until just softened. Added 3 c. Chicken stock and brought to a simmer. Stirred in 1.5 cups of orzo, returned to a simmer, turned the heat to low, and allowed to simmer covered for 15 mins. Removed from heat and stirred in 1/4 c. Chopped fresh parsley, juice of 1 lemon, and green onions. Seasoned with salt and pepper. It could probably have used another lemon if you really wanted the lemon to stand out. Served with shrimp in a white wine tomatoe sauce with feta. Absolutely amazing!

I loved this!  And so did my squash hating hubby!  I admit, I seldom follow a recipe exactly so I kinda winged it.  I added more zucchini than called for and summer squash too, added a bit extra lemon juice and lemon zest at the end and the freshly grated parm cheese is the key to getting it down my hubby.  I salt my pasta water when cooking it and that really helps to flavor the orzo.  Nice mild flavor, I'd bet even kids would love it if my hubby did. You could also add in some mushrooms and a sprinkle of cooked bacon to add another flavor.  Love it so much that in fact, I am making it tonight as a side dish to burgers.  :)

It lacks flavor. I ádded salt, pepper, and minced garlic to the onions. I added feta cheese at the end, and it helped a bit. I'll give it another try with other seasonings.

I jazzed it up a bit. This is a great recipe as a base to get you going but that’s the way I use this recipe app in general. Green peppers and cheese added a lot to this. Topped it off with tomatoes, dill and cilantro. Thanks

Honestly I loved this as a main dish with steamed broccoli. I added a tbsp of bouillon mixed in 2-3 ounces of water. It helped the flavor. And added fresh lemon and Parmesan for flavor. It was so tasty!

I thought it was really good. I added an extra zucchini and when I was all done I thought it was pretty bland so I added a table soon of butter, a little more salt and squeezed a couple lemon wedges of lime over the complete dish and tossed it all together.

Really a nice side dish offering a variety of flavors and textures with a relatively simple prep. Orzo is perfect, but probably any similar pasta can be subbed. Fresh parsley > dry.

We liked this.  I used 1 1/2 cups orzo and a whole, fairly large zucchini (no squash - didn't have any).  I added garlic to the onion when the onion was almost translucent.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of Old Bay and about 2 ounces of freshly grated Parmesan which melts beautifully into the orzo.  Will definitely make again.

Great side dish.  We had it with our Easter ham.  I only had zucchini, so I used 2 of them instead of the yellow squash.  Also added some leftover broccoli and a tablespoon of butter melted in the drained orzo.  Good light flavor.  It would be easy to add garlic or other seasonings to modify the flavor, but I liked it fine as it I made it.

I added a few chicken bouillon cubes to the lemon water. Finish off with a little salt before serving. Really delicious sweet/salty side dish even for those who don't like veggies.

I was hoping I would disagree with the reviewers who said this was too bland because it just sounded good, but unfortunately it is indeed extremely bland. I put in extra lemon juice, extra olive oil, and went a little crazy with the salt and pepper, and it was still bland. So then I dumped in a bunch of Italian seasoning and topped it with a pile of parmesan cheese, and NOW it actually has some flavor.
