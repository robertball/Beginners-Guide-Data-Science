I infused the water with a white tea before I mixed in the sugar. It made for a delicious, floral frosting.

Excellent recipe. A lovely light and fluffy buttercream, very buttery with a very nice sweet finish. The only changes I made were to temperatures. Egg whites were cold, butter was room temp. I find this helps hugely in getting stiff peaks and cuts your post butter mixing time down. If your butter is too cold the buttercream will crack and you'll endup needing to warm it anyway.

I added cocoa powder when I added vanilla and  the frosting was light, stable, and delicious!

Very good. Made the recipe exactly and it came out silky smooth and not too sweet. Definitely will use often.
