The pumpkin filling firmed up perfectly and the icing was very rich, but you should definitely grease the bottom of your pan regardless of the amount of butter used in the crust.  I brought this to thanksgiving dinner and they wouldn't even come out of the pan.  Grease your baking pans and dishes!

These were good but VERY sweet.  Try playing around with both sugars, I definitely didn't need that much, especially with the sweetened condensed milk.

This was WONDERFUL!  The crust actually turned into sort of a crunchy, praline texture (I use a glass pan).  We put a dollop of French Vanilla Cool Whip on it while it was warm and it was better than any pumpkin pie I've ever had. I also didn't have any allspice, so I just substituted 1/2 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice.

I found that the amount of spice in the recipe wasn't enough for my tastes so added 1 tsp. each ginger and cloves to the mix.  They turned out really well and were very popular with the people I fed them to.  I even had requests for the recipe.  I will be making these as a holiday treat from now one.  Yummy!

Very easy to make and very tasty.  I took some to work and everyone asked for the recipe.  I will difinetly make them again.  I also substituted pumpkin pie spice for allspice.

Made crust as instructed, except used mixed nuts. Used 2 cups prepared (baked and pureed) FRESH pumpkin, and instead of spices recommended I used pumpkin pie spices as I would for making pie: 1 tsp ginger, 1 tsp ntmeg, 1.5 tsp cinnamon, and 1 tsp corn starch -for thickening. Turned out FABULOUS! All party attendees loved it and wanted more than just hte one big pan! I put out whip cream as I would use for pie and bars were gone in less than 1 hour!!!!!

I made these for a bake sale fundraiser and they were a big hit.  I had some sweetened condensed milk and canned pumpkin leftover from the holidays, so it was a good way to use them up.  My husband said I should add raisins next time, too.  I doubled the recipe with no problems.

This is GREAT!  My family loved it.  My husband doesn't like allspice, but he did't mind this at all.  The only thing I will change next time is, I will use less crumb mixture for the top.  1 1/4 cups was too much.  Something else I did was, I used fresh pumpkin, and I used pecans for the nuts.

This was very good.  I used the suggestion of making it in a glass/ceramic dish instead of metal.  It made the crust candy very nicely.  I'm not one for liking pumpkin, but the pumpkin flavor was not too overbearing.  I think I would like to try the same crust recipe with other fillings like apples.  I think it could work with just about any pie filling.  Thank you.

Very Tasty~Reading the reviews makes me wonder if the recipe was followed by the bad reviewers. I followed the recipe exactly....Crust was NOT soggy, crust was NOT too sweet, the 1/4 of topping was NOT too much, the filling was NOT too sweet. This dish was nearly perfect. I DO NOT care for super sweet treats--this was not too sweet, again it was very good. I used straight up pumpkin from a can not pumpkin pie filling. I DID spray with non-stick spray as suggested. They came out of the glass dish-cooked at 350 degrees-just fine

Very tasty! Loved the crust. The only change I would make next time is sprinkle extra chopped nuts over the top to give it a little extra crunchy texture. Otherwise, I like this better than a traditional pumpkin pie. Thanks!

what a great recipe!  awesome alternative to pumpkin pie for anyone who needs a travel or gift dessert.  i read that some bakers thought the crust was too sweet so i tried something different:  instead of 1/2 C sugar and 1/2 C brown sugar, i finely crushed 1 C store-brand ginger snaps. i broke them up and ran them through the food processor until i had a full cup of fine crumbs.   the mixture wasn't quite sweet enough so i went back and added about a quarter cup (it could stand a half cup) of brown sugar.  still put the cinnamon in too.  the ginger snaps make the crust delicious and really spicy - brings out the great flavor of the pumpkin!  also, don't be alarmed if the pumpkin mixture is like soup before you bake it .. it firms up! i was worried too!  :)

Followed the recipe, just added alittle more spice.  But, this was just OK for me, nothing great or outstanding.  I was going to grease the pan as suggested in other reviews and forgot and that was a big mistake.  Sticks bad!  It is better the next day with whipped cream. Glad I tried it once but probably won't again.

This was VERY good - a true taste of Fall. The crust is the  best part! Enjoy!
It does want to stick to the pan - so I would suggest greasing it!
Also - do take the suggestion to let it sit for 10 minutes after baking..

These have a great flavor and I love the nuts in the crust.  You definitely need to spray the pan, as it is impossible to get "bars" out.  The crust completely sticks to the bottom of the pan, even with all the butter. I too used Pumpkin pie spice instead of the other spices.

These were fantastic!  Since they were pumpkin pie bars though, I used the same spices called for on the can of Libby's for pumpkin pie.  Every time I make them, no one can eat just one.  Make sure you bake it long enough that the bottom crust comes out crunchy.  I made it once where the bottom crust was soggy and it was still good, but no where near as good as the crunchy bottom crust.

I call these Pumpkin Pie Squares, they are not actually a bar cookie... They are so addicting I had to take them to church to share or I would have ate every last square myself!  I could not stop myself!  Everyone else had the same problem... I had a friend text me the next day to tell me she could not stop thinking about them... poor thing doesn't bake...lol.  I will make these for every potluck I go to, just so I HAVE to share them!

These bars were great! Even my husband liked them and he usually avoids pumpkin treats! I substituted apple sauce for the eggs because of an egg allergy and made my own pumpkin puree.

These were delish! I did not have all spice and we did not miss it. I cut the sugars in half and I probably could cut it in half again.  Very moist and creamy.  I sprayed the pan with Pam and once it cooled I put it in the fridge overnight.  They were easy to cut and remove unlike some other reviews said.  Will be making these again soon.

I gave this two stars mainly because it just looks gross.  The taste isn't bad, a lot like pumpkin pie, with the pumpkin pie texture.  the crumb bottom doesn't stay crumbly and the crumb topping gets all soggy.  I've made this 3 different times, thinking maybe it would turn out different.  every time it's the same, and the only thing I've changed in the recipe is adding some nutmeg/ginger and cloves in place of the allspice.
otherwise, if you don't mind, kinda gross looking, mushy 'bars' that aren't really bar like, it's not bad.  but presentation is important especially when giving these 'bars' out as gifts on holiday plates.

These bars are simply amazing. I made them for a bake sale at work and they vanished, with several people coming back for seconds! The crust is a great texture and just the right sweetness. The only adjustment I made was using much less of the topping, so that it only slightly covered the top.

Good.  I think better cool than warm.  The nuts give it a "peanut butter" taste. I topped with cool whip in the pan, it looked nice.

Made as written except cut sugar back by half- it was still very sweet.  The flavor was good and the idea of pumpkin bars was cute but these just sat around.  No one was wow-ed; if it where a pie it would have been gone in a day.

Fantastic recipe.  I lined the baking pan with lightly greased parchment paper before pressing in the crust mixture and they turned out beautifully.   Between the sugar in the crust and the sweetened condensed milk with the pumpkin, these are VERY sweet, but they disappeared.  I also used the spice mixture from the Libby pumpkin recipe (cinnamon, clove, ginger) instead of allspice because it is the blend we prefer.

This is a large dessert which is great for the holidays coming up.  Definitely spray or grease pan.  I added one teaspoon vanilla to pumpkin mixture.  Also, did not have  allspice so used 1/4 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp nutmeg.  And, yes, it is best served warm but it is still very tasty cold. This is a wonderful, delicious dessert I would give it  ten stars  if I  could.

These are very good! I cut the sugar in half, 1/4c. white and 1/4c. brown. I also used only 1/2c. marg. The top and bottom turned out crispy and the pumpkin was well set. Baked 35 minutes.

These turned out well good flavor and texture but, not quite sweet enough with only one cup of total sugar for the filling.  I will make them again and add about a half cup of brown sugar extra next time.  Also, I put a little cooking spray on the dish for easier removal, it workd well.

A bit too rich and a bit on the soggy side, best eaten with a fork. Not as much flavor as I had hoped for.  I followed recipe ingredients with the exception of using "I Can't Believe It's Not Butter for Baking", and only using 5/8c (10T). Cut bars into 32 pieces.

Mine were more like a pumkin pie, not pumkin bars. It was tasty though. I did not use pumkin in a can. I make the pumkin puree myself. Maybe that is why it was not as firm.

Yummy!! This recipe came to me today along with other Halloween recipes.  I was looking for something to make for a party I am going to tomorrow & I had the ingredients on hand.  Made it up, serve it with ice cream or cool whip (for the lactose intolerant) and it was SOOOOOO good, I have to run to the store now for more ingredients for the party tomorrow!  My family loved it!

"My oh my its halloween time!" says marita as she inhales the sweet scent of these pumpkin pie bars! They were a delight unto our family and i can not begin to descibe the sentiments that were included with each bite that entered by autumn mouth. Though the rain drizzles above me, i am filled with sunshine in the midst of a cold season. So thank you, for making a fall season so much more. Thanks for making my autumn, autumn.

Very good, but yes, make sure you butter the pan, or you will not be able to get them out!

Yum!!!  OMG, I can't stop eating them.  I think I probably should have cooked them for 40-45 minutes, just a few min. longer.  Make sure to grease the Pyrex pan even though it has a lot of butter in the crust anyway, like another reviewer suggested.

I did as others suggested and lightly greased the pan.  Because I use a glass dish, I cut the temperature down to 350 degrees.  I added a little whip cream on top of each bar before serving.   These were so yummy.

Woot! Woot!  I LOVE these.  I'm sure they're going to be a big smash at various holiday get-togethers.  Thanks SO much for sharing this recipe.  I agree that you should grease the pan, but since I did, mine came out VERY easily after allowing to cool for 10 minutes.  They were still somewhat flexible, so cooling for a little longer might be a good idea.  I had no issues getting it out of the pan.  (I uploaded a picture to show everyone in my Pampered Chef Stoneware.)  I was impressed to say the least.  I don't like things too sweet.  Even with all the sugar and sweetened milk, this is not too much other than the typical holiday sweet treat.  I think one reason I liked it so well is mine was in such a large stoneware baking dish, so the layers each were thin.  I'm glad I did it this way.  It didn't have one large layer of pumpkin.  I'm not a huge pumpkin fan, but these were absolutely delicious!

It wasn't exactly what I was expecting because I used a whole pumpkin and I think I used more than was necessary. It was super creamy but not so firm. I also cooked it with out the topping first and let it firm up a little. But once it was finished it was wonderful. I made it a little too late at night and we ate it for breakfast. My husband ate half of it before he left the house. We are making this for Thanksgiving!

These were delicious and I didn't have any trouble with the crust crumbling or sticking to the pan. I wonder if the people who did have that trouble used 3/4 of a stick of butter rather than 3/4 of a CUP of butter? Either way, these were a big hit at my house!

Really disappointing. The pumpkin flavor is overpowered by the floury crust/topping.

Wonderful!!  I did cut back on the sugars in the crust to 1/3 cup of each brown & white sugar.  Trust me, you'll never miss it.Also,  I didn't have any allspice, so I substituted 1/2 tsp ginger and 1/4 tsp cloves in the pumpkin filling. Perfect! Lastly, I was a little nervous that the recipe advised NOT greasing the pan, so I sprayed just a tiny amount of Pam, with a little extras in the corners (where stuff usually likes to burn, if it's gonna burn!).  It probably wasn't necessary, and next time I will use an ungreased pan.  And there WILL be a next time!!  :-)

Pretty good. It is similar to pumpkin pie. I used pumpkin pie spice instead of allspice and threw in some extra cinammon. Definitely spray the pan.

These were not good. The crust is flavorless and soggy. The filling was good but ruined by the crust. I would say the crust definitely needs some sugar in it. I will not make these again. The idea is great but the recipe needs work.

I loved this recipe. It was easy to make and tasted almost better than pumpkin pie (and I made lot's of pumpkin pies this last fall for our village fall fair contest!)
I increased the pumpkin pie spice flavoring by adding 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/4 tsp cloves and this worked really well. I also greased the bottom of the pan and used a glass bakeware dish as suggested by other members and this worked great.
Note of caution: It will appear that the batter isn't really firming up but the bottom cruse is getting nice and golden. This is similar to when cooking a pumpkin pie. If you think the crust is done then take it out. The batter will continue to cook and will in fact firm up and turn out perfectly and not over done.
Also, the recipe suggests to serve warm but I actually found them to be much better once they had a chance to cool completely and the flavors had a chance to settle. Enjoy!

Tastes wonderfully of autumn. Prefer it cold like my pumpkin pie.  Warm would be good with ice cream.

This is a fantastic recipe. My sister and I have managed to consume the entire batch in a couple of days. I added more spices than the recipe called for. I didn't have allspice so I added extra cinnamon, cloves and ginger. I will also add nutmeg when I make it again. It smells so good while it's baking. So much better than pumpkin pie. I used pecans for the nut addition-2 thumbs up on that. This is a keeper recipe!

The only thing I did differently than instructed by the recipe was to grease my baking pan. These turned out so good!  A very nice alternative to basic pumpkin pie. I found the taste to be just the right amount of sweetness and the allspice was enough flavor for me.  I loved the texture that the crumb top and crust gave to this.  Really a perfect little dessert!!

Tried this recipe exactly "as is."  Not great, but not bad! Needed some ZING. I have made a similar pumpkin bar w/cream cheese,so I may have expected these to have THAT richness...but to me, this recipe is just good, not great.
