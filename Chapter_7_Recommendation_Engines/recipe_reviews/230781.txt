I made this for dinner tonight and it was a good departure from regular macaroni and cheese.  I did not add the avocados because a) they are too expensive! and b) I was afraid they would get mushed up inside but I am curious to try them next time.  This bechamel sauce was a little gluey...normally I use less flour so I recommend doing the same.  But the beans, chilies and Mexican seasoned cheese were really good addition.

This is a tasty twist on Mac and cheese. Everyone liked it but the kids.
