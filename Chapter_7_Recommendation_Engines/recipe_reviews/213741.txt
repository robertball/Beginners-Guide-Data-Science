YUM! So happy to try this - I had parsnips from another recipe AND my herb garden is getting out of control with mint and sage. Initially, I was hesitant about the mint, but it really blends in nicely with the other ingredients...certainly doesn't POP like you might expect it would. The honey helped with the sweetness of the veggies (I added carrots because i had them peeled and cut already... glad I did for an extra burst of color!) Everything about this was perfect, in my opinion. Other than adding more veggies for more color/nutrition/variety, I wouldn't change a thing!!

This is a delicious vegetable dish. Like other reviewers, I used carrots and parsnips (4 of each - and there was plenty of the mixture to coat the vegetables). The only change I made was to use fresh oregano for the sage, as I didn't have any sage. A definite make-again.

While I liked this dish (I love parsnip) I was shocked at the compliments it received during dinner. The sage overpowers the mint, I feel. I also didn't measure the honey - just added a squirt or so, definitely not a full tablespoon. Four parsnip is a very small portion for four people - I used six parsnip and three carrots for six. I'd definitely make this sometime again.

This was excellent! I loved having a new idea for a vegetable side dish as my usual fare gets old after a while.  I added 4 carrots to this and cut them in the same julienne shape.  They really did seem like veggie "fries" and were so tasty.  The mint and sage were brilliant additions.  I can't wait to make this again!

This is my new favorite way to make parsnips! I ran out of mint, so I doubled the sage, and it was delicious. These came out almost like sweet (but not too sweet) french fries. I'll be making this often throughout the winter.

Excellent flavor! Don't skimp out on the honey--- completely worth it! My only advice is to check it after 20 minutes at 450. Because at 30 minutes at 450, mine burned and turned half black. So in the future I would lessen the cooking time OR lower the temperature, whichever makes a better fry. Thanks for a great recipe!  And who knew that mint and sage are such flavor enhancers when used together!?

Yummy and I didn't even put the fresh mint and fresh sage - used a little dried sage though. Thanks!

It was good, just not as good as I anticipated. I didn't like the sage and mint, should of left those out.

Yum! I also added carrots and golden beets to this dish. I did not have any mint on hand either, but it was still amazing.

We loved this. I mixed equal carrots to parsnips to feed four (but two of us ate them all). The honey really does the trick, and I found using mint & sage a great combo. Terrific recipe!

These were great! Good alternative to french fries, and the herbs add a lot of flavor.

I may have sliced my parsnips too small (went for a potato wedge, or thick cut fry size)... Mine turned out way over done..might try this recipe again after spending more time checking out other reviews!

Made exactly as directed except added carrots for color. Easy dish that even my 3 year old loves.....who at times I think survives off of chicken nuggets and Mac and cheese.

Like other reviewers I used half carrots and half parsnips. The herbs are a must- even if you think it sounds strange, it works! My husband raved about these.

It was good but I thought the sage and mint was weird. I don't think it complimented the sweetness of the parsnips with honey. I think something spicy would be best like hot chili flakes? By the way made exactly as stated when rated.
