I also halved the recipe, et it marinate overnight, cooked it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 mins. It was perfect -- so moist and tender. Plus, the leftovers make great Greek pita sandwiches with lettuce, tomatoes, olives, feta, red onion, pepperocini and greek dressing. Yum!

This is an extraordinary dish!  I followed the recipe as directed and it turned out great!  The taste of the lime on the pork is absolutely remarkable.  I added extra marinade on top of the pork tenderloin before inserting it in the oven at 400 degrees Farenheit for 30 minutes and it turned out to perfection. (Since it's winter and quite cold here in Ottawa, Canada, I couldn't use my bbq so I used the oven instead). I served this great dish with Asiago toasted cheese puffs (see recipe on allrecipes.com) along with risotto with artichokes!  What a great combination!

Bar none, this is one of the tastiest ways to prepare pork tenderloin I have ever tried.  I accidentally forgot to add the oregano, and it was STILL just great.  Next time, of course, I will try to remember the oregano!  Per some of the other reviews, I halved all the marinade ingredients and had plenty for 2 tenderloins.  I used fresh lemon juice to make it "authentic" Greek, rather than lime juice, minced about 1/3 of the garlic for the marinade & made slits in the tenderloins & inserted the garlic slices.  We cooked it on our gas grill over indirect heat for exactly 25 minutes (to 160 degrees), and it was superb!  Thanks, Dave, for this keeper of a recipe.

Excellent marinade for pork tenderloin - however I cut the amount of marinade in half and it was plenty for 2 pound of pork. I used lemon juice instead of lime about 1/2 cup and cut the salt back to 1/2 tsp. I used only 2 Tbsp. of oregano. I added 1/4 cup of low sodium soy sauce. I cut the pork into kabobs, put everything into a ziploc bag and let it marinate all day. It grilled up perfectly and tasted great!

The thing I love most about this recipe is how well it freezes. It's great for bulk cooking. When the pork chops I like go on sale, I buy a bunch for this recipe.  I line up enough gallon-size zipper bags to put 4 or 5 chops in each bag, then I make a half-recipe of the marinade in each bag and add the chops. I lay them flat in the fridge to marinate until the next day, then I transfer them to the freezer.  They make a nice quick meal, just thaw and grill/broil.

Truth be told, I modify the recipe a bit. I use lemon juice instead of lime, and use 3 generous Tbsp each of basil and oregano.  I also use more garlic and mince it.  Love it!

Very tasty.  I'm allergic to pork so I used boneless, skinless chicken breasts.  Marinated them for about 5 hours starting from semi-frozen state.  I think I'll marinate a little longer next time to bring out the lime.  Will make again.

Good recipe with a few modifications. Makes way too much marinade - cut it in half and there is still more than enough for two whole tenderloins. I used lemon juice and reduced the amount of oregano. Also added fresh ground pepper to the marinade. Roasted uncovered in a 350 degree oven for about 40 minutes. Use an oven thermometer to get it perfect. If it's overcooked it dries right out.

This came out DELICIOUS! I used minced garlic for the sliced and bottled key lime juice instead of the fresh, as I didn't have any. My only reservation was the large quantity of grilled (and therefore slightly crunchy) oregano bits on the meat when we ate it. I think next time I would try to rinse them off with the marinade or use ground instead of chopped. (The recipe doesn't specify which to use.) To those who used lemon juice instead of lime and thought it was too tart, OF COURSE IT WAS! If you don't make a recipe right, don't give it a bad review!

I was never too sure about this recipe until I tasted it....Outstanding!
I cut the marinade in half as previous reviewers sugessted. Other suggestions:
- pour some olive oil on a paper towel to grease your grill grates. Grease just prior to putting meat on (use enough towels so you don't burn yourself!).
- use gallon ziploc freezer bags to marinate meat in. Turn over every hour or so.
- put a meat thermometer in center of one of the tenderloins after turning...should just reach 170 degrees when done.
- use fresh limes! (6 to 8 to get 7 ounces).

Very good.  I started it on the stove for 10 minutes, browning on all sides.  Then put it in the oven with the remaining marinade at 400 degrees for 12 minutes, took it out and covered with foil and let it sit 10 more minutes.  Sliced and spooned a bit of the marinade on.  We had the Beet Salad by Robbie Haferkamp on this site and Orzo with Feta and Cherry Tomatoes from Epicurious.com.  Yummy Greek dinner!

I made this for dinner for my parents.  My father and I really enjoyed the dish.  My mother however complained about both the strong citrus flavor and the oregano flavor.  So I suspect the rule should be don't make if  you don't like citrus or oregano.  It doesn't take long for the marinade to saturate the meat.

It was great, I changed it up a little though.  I wrapped the tenderloin in bacon and it really went well with the lime seasoning (which is one of my favorites). Served it over yellow rice and asparagus, nothing but compliments!!!

We had this for dinner tonight and it was pretty tasty. Very tender. The marinade made the fridge smell delicious all afternoon, but in the end the lime overpowered all other flavours for a bit too much for me. We'll save this recipe but next time I think I'd like a little less lime, or perhaps add more olive oil to balance it out.

When I first mixed up the marinade, I was a bit worried that it seemed a little bland and was unsure how the end product would turn out. After marinating the pork for 8 hours, we grilled it on low temperature and served it to a dinner party... and oh.my.God. I couldn't believe how amazingly tender,  burst-in-your-mouth flavorful the pork was. My mouth would have dropped to the table had I not been afraid the meat would fall out and and I'd miss out on that lost piece! This is bar none THE BEST MARINADE EVER for pork. Don't question it. Just make it. Hurry up... you're wasting time reading this!

NOTE: This is WAY TOO MUCH marinade for 2 pounds of pork.  I used 1/3 of all ingredients (except the pork), and it was plenty for 2 pounds of pork!  (If you change the serving size of this recipe to yield 2 instead of 6, you will have the right proportions.)

I also added 2 T. of sugar and a dash of pepper.  It came out great!  

I was looking for a marinade free of soy (soy sauce, teriyaki, etc.), and this is perfect.  We make this all the time now!  We usually cut up the pork into large cubes before marinating, and then grill them as kabobs with green peppers, cherry tomatoes, and pineapple.  Always a favorite in our house--and we never have any leftover!

I just wasn't crazy about it. It was just too much oregano. The meat was moist and the lime flavor was fine but the oregano was so overpowering. I won't be making this recipe again.

I did this with just plain ol pork chops.  My son devoured 2 by himself (he's 7).  Very tastey!!  I'm SURE this is even better on tenderloin.

I was really skeptical about this recipe because I have never equated lime with being Greek - it's lemon, right? I was pleasantly surprised to find that the finished product is delicious - and Grecian-esque. Thanks for the recipe!

We could NOT believe how good this was.  We used this recipe to cook a 2 lb. pork loin roast on indirect heat charcoal grill, and it was outstanding!  No need for sauce or gravy, and I didn't think it was too much marinade, if that was what tenderized the roast to perfection!! Wish I could give this 10 stars.

This is a really great recipe.  It takes minimal prep, but is incredibly tasty.  Guests are very impressed by it, even though it doesn't take much work.  It's been too cold to grill out yet in Indiana, so I've just baked it at 375 for about 45 minutes, and it has come out perfect every time.

I use fresh lemon juice instead of lime, and pork chops instead of tenderloin.  Bake in the oven at 350 for around 40 minutes.  So easy, and tastes great!

Absolutely fabulous! The marinade was zesty and flavorful: as good as that of our favorite Mediterranean restaurant.

I substituted the juice of Seville oranges (from our tree out front) and used bottled chopped garlic without any noticeable compromise of taste.

Some of the best meat I've ever cooked!! I did mine a little differently than instructed. First I had adjusted the servings to 4. I ran out of lime juice, so I only put in 1/2 a cup and it was the perfect tartness. I think following the recipe would have been too much. I used Italian seasoning instead of oregano because it's what I had. I put the tenderloin in my crock pot and dumped the marinade over it. I rubbed it all over the loin and let it sit in the crock pot in the fridge all night. Then, in the morning I started the crock pot on low and let it cook all day (8 hours). It was tender and delicious. I've already sent the recipe to several people to make.

Simple and delicious! Prepared as directed, but cooked in the oven for 20 minutes at 400, then removed from oven and tented with foil on counter for another 10 minutes. Perfect! A wonderful mid-winter's meal, with fresh citrus and garlic taste, with salad and saffron rice on the side.

This was excellent! Very easy to make, once you juice all the limes. :) I did use fresh limes from my lime tree and used 1 1/4 cup of juice. I marinated for 2 hours but will definately do 5 hours next time for more flavor. Cooked 30 minutes and it came out perfect. This is being added to my 'favorite' folder.

I wish I would have not substituted the lime for lemon juice.. This was tasty but I think it would have been much more flavourful with the lime. I also halved the amount as I only made a 1 lb tenderloin.  23 minutes on a medium grill and it was perfect!
Very good overall and I will make again with the lime instead!

What an awesome marinade.  I took the advice on using fresh lemon juice versus the lime, and this came out to be one fantastic meal.  I used this on butterfly pork chops as I didn't have any tenderloin.  We basted the chops as they were cooking on the grill with the extra marinade.  Fantastic!  Thanks Dave!  Another keeper from this great website!

This was very good, but next time will cut the recipe in half because it makes too much marinade.  Thanks for a nice alternative to teriyaki.

Maybe this marinade didn't work out for me as well as it did for others because I tried to adapt it for a low-sodium diet by omitting salt.  I found the oregano overpowering, but the rest of the family enjoyed the tenderloins.  I will try again with less oregano.  Thanks!

Wow. Packed with flavor. I used fresh oregano and baked it in the oven (350 deg, 45 min), and it was fantastic. I even used bottled lime juice and jarred garlic, and it was still fantastic. If you're looking for a prettier presentation and are using the oven, I'd recommend searing it in a pan first...

Oh, I did end up marinating it for 24 hours as well, for what that's worth.

When I made this for my relatives (12 people including myself) everyone found it to be absolutely delicious. I found the meat to be very tender even when cooked well done and the lime gave it a pow! The aromas of garlic and oregano filled the kitchen and had everyone salvating in anticipation. For a pork roast, this was very satisfying and I'm sure I'll get the cravings to make this dish again.

Excellent flavors!  I took the suggestions from others who've tried this before me. Upped the garlic to 8 cloves, took the oregano down to about 8½ Tbls, added black pepper to the marinade, and roasted in the oven. ~did use the meat thermometer(good call)~ Cut the temp down to 375° to keep in oven a little longer. This kept it moist.  Then turned up the oven to 400° in the last few minutes. Made a roastpan gravy to spoon over while the meat "rested".   Will be making this satisfying tenderloin again for the family.

Wow!  Absolutely delicious.  I baked in the oven as other reviewers had done.    Turned out perfectly!   The only change I made was to add about 1/2 to 1 tsp. of sugar, and about the same amount of garlic powder. The marinade is addictive!  I can't wait to try it out on chicken and maybe even fish!  A definite keeper.

The recipe was absolutely fantastic! I have never grilled OR cooked a pork tenderloin before, so this was the perfect, easy way to give it a try. I took advice from previous reviews and roughly halved the marinade ingredients and had plenty. This was so flavorful and juicy, I can't thank you enough for this wonderful recipe! It will be used over and over again! 
PS to other readers- my marinade was a bit too tangy/limy for my liking before I combined it with the pork, but I ran out of olive oil. After cooking I discovered that most of the tangy lime flavor cooks out leaving a delicious flavor to the pork, so dont be worried if it's a bit too tangy or citrusy before cooking!

There's very little I can add to previous reviews, except to confirm that this is a simple, delicious marinade, guaranteed to please everyone around the dinner table. I'm very glad I used fresh lime juice, because I don't think lemon would have been nearly as good . . . . The next evening, I put thin slices of cold tenderloin on a green salad with feta cheese and red-wine vinegar dressing, which was equally as tasty. Two easy hot-weather meals I'll be making again!

My fiance loved this recipe, our guest made no specific comments about it, and I wasn't too fond of it. As I was preparing the marinade, I kept tasting and smelling it and I could already tell it was going to be bland, but I decided to give it a chance... I marinated it for about 4 hours and the lime was the only flavour I tasted, even though I followed the recipe to a 'T'. It was a little dry as well. I won't make this again as I've DEFINITELY had better tenderloin recipes! Sorry...

I left mine to marinate 2 days in the fridge- I thought this was ok-i've done it with chicken.  But it seemed the acid in the lime was breaking down the meat.  It was unedible. So maybe my mistake?

This was delicious.  The only minor changes I made was to use l/2 oregano and l/2 thyme.  I also ended up cutting the tenderloin into Kabobs and added veggies to the skewers.  I  marinated the veggies with the meat.  This would also be great for lamb!

Made this last night and it was terrific!  It was raining (again) here in Jersey, so I browned it a little first, then baked it at 350 for 45 minutes with a little of the marinade in the pan.  It was soo good!  I used lemon instead of lime, but might try lime next time....when hopefully the skies will clear and I can grill it...can't wait!! Thanks Dave!

This tenderloin recipe was fantastic.  I've always loved the flavorings of greek dishes, and I'll be proud to serve this dish anytime, anywhere.  It would be a great addition to any barbecue, greek theme dinner, or a regular meal as its so easy.

Excellent! I scaled recipe down to 2 servings and there was still plenty of marinade for four boneless pork loin chops. They turned out moist, tender and very tasty. I didn't have lime juice on hand, so substituted lemon juice as suggested by other reviewers. Also, I only used 2 tsp. of oregano (compared to 2+ TBLS in recipe scaled to 2 servings), as we aren't big oregano fans. My husband, who did the grilling, was hesitant about dinner as he doesn't usually care for pork. But, even he liked these! Thanks, Dave!

18 Aug 2014.....I tried this recipe EXACTLY as it was posted, and it was one of the best marinades I have used. It works very well with chicken too. It does make maybe a little too much, but I used the excess to baste the loins/chicken while they were cooking on the Q.  I also think this would work well with beef. A nice strip loin on the grill, or a rump roast on the rotisserie     Paul T.

Really easy to make, was very good. Didn't have enough lime juice in the house so I used part of a can of Budlite Lime-a-rita and it turned out just fine. Husband loved it with a caesar salad and pearl couscous.

This is the first time that I cooked a pork tenderloin.  I thought since they are an extra lean meat it would be dry & tough.  This recipe helped the meat stay moist and it virtually melted in your mouth.  Great flavor.  The oregano was a bit heavy so if you are not fond of that earthy flavor cut it back.  I used a flat griddle as I don't have a grill pan (yet) but that worked well also.  I'm going to try this on the BBQ as I think that would work well also without heating up the house.

This makes a LOT of marinade so I cut it down quite a bit, I also cut down on the oregano & it was super yummy.

I had a lime I needed to get rid of but wasn't sure it would go with my pork chops. I searched allrecipes and got this -- it was great! I didn't have time to marinate, so I put the pork chops in a foil packet with the marinade and baked them for several minutes, then threw them on the grill to give them grill marks and finish them. Delish!

My 11 year old daughter says this was the best meal she had in a month! Nice and different flavor for a tenderloin.  I seared all the sides for a couple minutes in a dutch oven then added the marinade and cooked in oven for 30 minutes at 350. Let rest for 10 minutes, cut and covered with the remaining marinade from the dutch oven.

This was fabulous!  I used only 1/3 of the marinade, let it sit for about 4 hours, and it was perfect for one tenderloin.  I started by searing it on all sides on the stovetop, then roasting it in the marinade for about 20-25 minutes (very unscientific) at 400.  It was so juicy and delicious!  Used some fresh meyer lemons and fresh oregano.  I thought the marinade was going to be too strong when I first made it, but it turned out so good.  A great alternative to apples, sweet potatoes, and maple syrup.  Goes great with a Greek salad.

This came out great using the recommended modifications. I used mostly lemon juice and just a few tablespoons of lime juice. I also used dried oregano straight from my brother-in-law's backyard in Greece (it grows wild and abundantly). I prepped the marinade the night before so the flavors could marry. Then I poured it over the meat inside a ziploc baggie and massage the meat a lil. I worry about over-marinating meat especially when it has a lot of acid like fresh lime/lemon so that is why I didn't do it overnight. This marinated all day until I got home from work (about 10 hours). I grilled it on med-high to sear in the juices (3-4 minutes each side) and then turned it on low for about 15 additional minutes turning once.  It was juicy and flavorful.  Served with a greek pasta salad and some crusty bread.

Made this for 8 adults and it is great but I thought the oil and lemon juice quantities were a bit too much for me so for about 2.5 lbs of meat I used only 1 cup lemon and 3/4 cup olive oil.Used 1/4 cup dried oregano. This amount of  marinade could have handled another pound of meat in my zipploc bag. I served it with oven baked greek style potato nuggets, Greek salad and had pitas on hand for those who wanted to do a sandwich with extra feta and home made Tzatziki.Most of my guests ate it this way after seeing a few of us doing so. The combined flavours made it a super special BBQ evening amongst family.Thanks for the inspiration!

I've done pork tenderloin a few different ways and this was not one of my favorites.  It made the meat very tender but did not bring a whole lot of flavor.  To me tenderloin is a pretty bland cut on its own and it needs bold flavors to make it really shine.  My favorite recipe is something similar to this then top it with pineapple salsa. Also, I find that leaving the tenderloin whole is a not the best idea.  I cut mine into medallions then pound then flat.  This gives you much more surface area and a fast grilling time.

I really enjoyed this. I love the citrus taste and the seasoning was good (I did cut back a little). I had to use bottled lime juice since I neglected to pick up limes (oops!). Very moist and delicious!

Wow was this good!  I also used lemon juice as other reviewers noted.  I cubed up the pork tenderloin and marinated it w/yellow peppes, orange peppers, mushrooms and onions and made shish kebobs.  Very tender and delicious!

I'm sorry I didn't review this before...I actually made this dish for Easter several years ago and I still remember it. I use the marinade on occasion for other meats - I used it tonight for lamb chops.

My wife's verbal review after a couple of bites said it best: "I'd given up on pork tenderloin because they're usually just about tasteless, but this is so good!" Very easy, too.

Absolutely delicious.  I followed a tip and baked it in the oven for 40min on 400F.  My husband couldn't stop talking about how delicious and moist it was.  I've already started sharing this one with friends.

I chopped 3 potatoes and a medium onion and then placed the veggies in the pan with the tenderloin to roast. After adding the veggies, there was the perfect amount of marinade to cover everything. I also subbed the lime juice with lemon juice. This recipe was fantastic and I'll definitely be making it again soon!

Amazing! This was mouthwatering. We have been using the leftovers all week long in salads, stews and sandwiches. I would note that it took us significantly longer to cook the tenderloin on the grill than quoted, so I would recommend using a meat thermometer.

This has become one of my favorites. An excellent marinade that is just downright delicious! I live in an apartment and don't have access to a grill, so I cook it uncovered in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 425 (along with some of the marinade). It is perfect -- so tender!

Just had this for dinner the other night and the family loved it! The only thing I would change is to decrease the amount of lime juice a bit. Didn't have oregano on hand so I used italian seasoning instead.

This recipe is one of my absolute all time favorites!  I use pork chops that have a bone in/and some fat on em!  I also changed the proportion's up a bit.  I use the 666 method.  6 Cloves of garlic smashed, 6 Limes-juiced, and 6 teaspoons of dried oregano.  Instead of salt, I add alot of fresh cracked pepper.  I add evoo to equal the lime juice.  Marinate 6 hours then grill em up.  The smell from the grill is devine!!

I used key lime juice, cut back to 4 tbs of oregano.   I also had to put it in the broiler since my grill ran out of gas.  I was absolutely wonderful this way also.  I will definately make this one again.

Wow!  This is terrific!  We had this for Easter dinner, and everyone raved.  It was so easy, and had a great taste and texture.  This has replaced my previous favorite pork tenderloin recipe...THANKS!

I couldn't believe how good this was for the minimal amount of ingredients that were in it. The flavor on the outside of the roast was unbelievable! I can't wait for grill season to start up so I can make this again!

Yummy, but nothing out of this world (hence why only 4 stars).  Very basic, a good start for a marinate, or good on it's own.

This was excellent.  A definate "do again" recipe.  I didn't have enough limes on hand, so I used part lime, part lemon and it worked great.  I marinated it for a total of about 18 hours, and it turned out nice and tasty with a lot of juices.  It didn't get dry like grilled pork does sometimes.  Thanks for the recipe!

We thought this was GREAT!  I cut the recipe for the marinade in half and used 2 tenderloins...there was more than enough marinade.  My suggestion is to let the meat marinade all day if possible then lightly salt when you put on the grill.  Even better left-over.  A winner!!!

Yum! Excellent marinade.  This makes alot of marinade, so will cut in half next time.  Didn't want to grill, so followed suggestion from previous reviewer and baked at 350 for 45 min. Very tasty.  Will most certainly make this again. Thanks Dave!

As I get really tired of using lemon juice, I used the lime juice as the recipe suggested, and I do love my oregano, so I used the full amount there. I made enough for 3.25 lbs, as others have suggested this recipe makes AT LEAST double what you need, I could probably have done with 2/3 less. Also, as the recipe suggests, sort of, add the lime juice slowly, tasting as you go along so it's not too tart.
Once I had the tenderloin on the grill, as I turned it, I patted each side with a bit more of the oregano.
I strained the marinade and fished the garlic slices out of it, sauteed them in 2 TBL of butter till they were brown and made a white sauce from that adding enough of the marinade till it tasted tangy. This really wasn't necessary though, the meat was extremely savory and moist! YUM, the hubby, who is a very picky eater, ate almost a third of the roast!

This was really good.  I used lemons instead of limes and cut back on the oregano by quite a bit - only used 3 tablespoon.  Also, I let it marinate for a full day and a half (we weren't into a big meal the first night so we left it in the fridge till the next day).  The marinade smelled really garlicy and I was a little worried it would be too strong but in the end, it really blended nicely with all the other flavors. I'll be making my tenderloins this way from now on!

This marinade was fantasic and soo easy!  I used one inch thick boneless pork cultlets and feel that these were the best I have ever made.  I had a few left over and they even tasted great reheated the next day!  I used 8 fresh limes, garlic powder and Lowry's season salt.   Thanks for the great recipe!!

Easy, quick to prepare and enjoyed by all. I do think the cook time is a little optimistic--it took my 3 lb. tenderloin a little over 50 minutes on the gas grill at 3/4's heat to get done (of course it was 5 degrees out, but that usually isn't a factor).

Thank you Dave!  I took this to a freinds cottage and we were invited back, as long as we brought some more of this.  Very easy... restraunt quality.  If you mess this up, you shouldn't be allowed in a kitchen.

I had guests for dinner and found out at least 3 people didn't usually eat pork.  After eating it, they loved it!  All of them even asked what it was marinated in!  Thanks for the great tasting pork!

I used lemon juice instead of lime and this is absolutely delicious!  My Mother-in-law is Greek and she always uses lemon.  Everyone loved this, even my in-laws who are Greek!  Next time I will cut down on the amount of marinade.  It was too much marinade for 2 - 1 pound pork tenderloins.

I get recipes all the time off this website.  My husband complains that he loves my cooking but never gets to enjoy the same meal twice.  Until this recipe I have never rated a recipe.  This was so incredibly fantastic.  I have to admit that I had thick, boneless chops instead of a tenderloin and they were incredible.  You know how sometimes you have something for dinner and then crave the flavor the next day?  This one did it for me.  This is one I will make often.  Yum!

Wow, great recipe with some very minor changes- I used (for 2.5# of tenderloin) about 4 1/2 T of oregano, the full amount of lime juice, olive oil and salt. Cooked it in the oven as my grill bit the dust late last year...
For those who thought the oregano was too intense, a quick fix is to have your sides less intense and have plain Greek yogurt available on the side.  
Amazing.

Super easy and really unique taste.   I marinated for 24 hours, then seared right before I grilled it.  My family is a huge fan!

I marinated it overnight. I used half the marinade, and there was definitely enough. I decreased the oregano because one reviewer said it was too much. It was good, but I think the full amount of oregano would probably also have been good.

Not being a fan of limes, I used fresh lemon juice instead. WONDERFUL! I also halved the amount of marinade,minced the garlic, and just had to add fresh ground pepper...no brainer addition, huh? Liked it enough that tonight I'm trying the marinade on chicken drumsticks.

The acidity of the lime juice will sear the pork, so marinade time is not really important IMO.  This recipe also works in a skillet with chops in case you want to use the oven for something else.

loved this recipe!  I only used 2 pork chops and used 1/3 of each ingredient.  Also, I had 1 large lemon i was trying to use so I juiced it, got a little over 1/4 cup juice ( i believe) then added water ( i believe to make it 3/4) and it turned out perfect!  It was still very lemony without being over powering.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!

Very tasty. The lemon really infuses the pork. I browned it  on the stove top first,  then put in the oven uncovered for 30 minutes at 400 degrees. I let it sit for 10 minutes, covered before I served it. Everyone loved it. Will definately do it again.It definately does have a lot of marinade left over.

Delicious! If only there were leftovers that I could thinly slice into a pita w/ feta and olives and tomato. /drool/ But we ate it all! I made a 1 lb'er (halved the marinade, and there was still too much) and baked it at 350 for 45 min. Moist, tender, and a delicate lime-ey tang made this tenderloin terrific!

While this wasn't a bad recipe, our family decided it wasn't as full of flavor as we had hoped.  You tasted a bit of the garlic and the lime but not the oregano.  The marinade was enough for twice the amount of meat they called for.  Its a good recipe, just not one we were hoping for.

This was extremely easy and extremely good. The only modification I made is that I cut the olive oil in half.  I only had time to marinate for 1 hour, but it still had great flavor.  I can't wait to try it again after a full 5 hours of marinating.

I found this really just tasted like lime. I didn't notice the garlic at all. However, it was very moist and most of my guests seem to like it.

Excellent...used fresh lime juice and cut back on the oil. I also added less salt and maybe 2-3 tblspns of oregano. Very flavorful and garlicky. I did marinate the tenderloins and froze them in a freezer bag with the marinade.I think the longer meat stays in a marinade, the flavor is that much stronger. They grilled up perfectly and the meat was very moist. Will make again. Thanks!

I used lemon juice instead of lime. I did cut the serving size down to two and it was plenty of maranade or two tenderloins. I did use the amount of garlic in the six serving version. ( I love garlic.) I used my garlic press instead of slicing. Great recipe !!!

Incredibly delicious!!

I marinated the pork for about an hour and a half as well as some parboiled potatoes in the same kind of mixture in a separate bowl for half an hour.  I used less oregano than the recipe called for, yet still found it bursting with flavour.  I then combined the two mixtures into a glass baking dish and baked at 400F for 50 minutes.  Some of the potatoes got really mushy - they probably didn't need to be parboiled - but this created a kind of intensely flavoured paste that worked really well with the pork and remaining potatoes.

I'll definitely make this one a regular dish!  Thanks!!

Wow this is so flavorful! I only had two hours available to marinate it, but the pork was still full of flavor! This marinade would be good on chicken too! I halved the recipe as many others advised and it was more than enough for two pounds of pork. I also used both lime and lemon juice, reduced the oregano to just under 2T. and added greek seasoning. Next time I will keep the 2 tsp. of salt instead of 1 tsp and will marinate for three hours instead of two. Try this, it's easy and so yummy!! Update: forgot to add that we melted feta cheese on top of the sliced pork. WOW, so amazingly delicious!!

LOVED IT! I followed the recipe as written, except I didn't have fresh limes (just the lime juice in the green plastic "lime") excellent anyway. I also added a very small amount of fresh rosemary (about a tsp.) to the marinade. We couldn't get enough of the pork. I can't wait to try this marinade with chicken!

Very good. I found that 1/2 of the marinade was sufficient for 2lbs of meat. The lime added just the right subtle tang. Using real limes is important to the taste. I used about 9 regular limes to get 3/4c. The amount of oregano was just right. After marinating don't be surprised that the meat looks greyish. It is reacting to the lime juice. I think the  2-5 hrs recommended shouldn't be far exceeded or you may end up "cooking" the meat. 
Make sure you have some left-overs. This tenderloin is delicious cold. 
Thank you Dave Nash for a wonderful recipe.

This was WONDERFUL!!!!  It is our new favorite!  I followed other reviews & cut the recipe in half and there was plenty.  I also decided to use half lime & half lemon juice… so tasty! The other changes I made from the original recipe were to add fresh cracked pepper & go a little shy on the oregano.  I also broiled the meat instead of grilling & it was prefect.  Great recipe!  Thanks so much Dave!!!

This was excellent.  I only made half the marinade for one pork tenderloin.  After marinating it I cut it into thick slices and made kabobs with red onion, red pepper and green pepper.  We grilled it and served it over white rice.  Very tasty.  I will definitely make this again.

This turned out really well. Even the "picky" eaters of the group devoured it. I prepped the meat the night before and let it marinate for about 24 hours. It was so moist. I tossed it in a roasting pan (along with all the marinade) and baked it at 450 for about 20 minutes. I served it with Tzatziki I (recipe from this site) and it was a huge hit.

To add to the "Grecian" feel, I served the medallions, topped with Feta cheese crumbles.  The perfect combination of tartness and richness.  If I knew wines better, this could be the ultimate meal or hor de voir!

I followed the recipe exactly except I cooked the loins in the oven as opposed to the grill.  I marinated them overnight. I put the tenderloins and all of the marinade ina pan in the oven. I am not a grill master and I didn't want to risk ruining what appeared to be a yummy dinner!  It was!  My mother and daughter thought it was too 'limey' and it could have been a bit more subtle with the citrus flavor, but I still thought it was delicious.  I would make again just like it was.  I warmed some pita bread and cut up the tenderloins and put them in the pita pockets with romaine, onion, feta cheese and the cucumber sauce from Sean's Falafel and Cucumber Sauce from this site.  Great dinner and healthy too!  Thanks for the recipe!

I'm making this AGAIN by special request, it's on the grill right now. My family loved this and I can't wait to try it with chicken. Super easy and a great neighbor meal. At medium heat on the grill, this needed more like 45 minutes to one hour to cook for me. Thanks! Updated 9/18/07: I have since made this with chicken as well and it is excellent. We served the chicken with Magpie's cucumber sauce recipe from this site, flour tortillas (homestyle), red onions, lettuce and grape tomatoes. Made a great souvlaki-type meal.

This made a great tasting pork tenderloin that my husband cooked on the grill. I marinaded it in the fridge for about 2 hours. The amount of oregano was a bit much for our taste, but overall it was a great marinade.

I marinaded for 6 hours, and added chopped flat leaf parsley to the dish. It came out great. We will make this again for sure.

Only did 1 1lb. loin.  Used 1 cup fresh squeezed lime juice and 4 tablespoons oregano and the called for amount of everything else.  

I used a gas grill and grilled on med to 150 degrees, about 25 minutes.  The first 3 minutes I had it on high and the last 3 minutes I had it on high to sear it and to char it a tad.  

Best ever pork tenderloin recipe.  The lime and the oregano is an amazing combination.  And yes, it was moist.  Don't blame this recipe for a lack of moistness.

This is FABULOUS!! I marinate it over night and sometimes add 1/4 c of honey.  The marinade makes a GREAT salad dressing when sweetened with honey and compliments the meal perfectly.  Everybody RAVES over this one!  It is perfect for summer nights.

This was WONderful...I didn't have enough lime juice, but filled it out with lemon (lemon says "greek" to me more than lime anyway).  I added another clove of garlic, and grilled the tenderloins on the George Forman grill.  Tender, filled with flavor, a definite keeper!  Thanks for a great recipe.

Wonderful recipe.  I slightly modified, using the zest (peel) of four limes.  Didn't have six cloves of garlic, so I used the two I had, added a couple of teaspoons of garlic powder and a little minced garlic (I hate vampires).  Let marinade about three hours.  I also poured/brushed the marinade over the meat repeatedly as I cooked it, rather than discarding.  It was one of the best tenderloin recipes I have ever tried.  The marinade permeates nearly to the center of the meat.  Exquisite!

Thought this was a great, delicious, and fairly simple recipe.  I actually used this to marinade a 4lb pork loin, per the recipe I tossed it in a bag and threw in the fridge.  I marinated overnight, and grilled for probably 1 to 1.5 hours.  Great flavor, moist, and yummy!

The flavor was wonderful, but it wasn't as moist and tender as I had hoped it would be though.  We had trouble getting the internal temperature high enough on the grill, so had to cook for quite a bit longer than recommended (gas grill, not charcoal, so maybe that was the problem).

Great mild flavor.  I wish I could have marinated it longer.  Loved it on the grill, nothing but positive remarks from friends.  Using lime as the theme taste, it paired well with the black bean and couscous salad.

The pork was tender and delicious. Instead of grilling, I cooked it in a dutch oven with all the marinade on med-high heat for 30 minutes. My husband has already requested that I make it again!

Quite good.  We did not eat it until the next day, but even reheated in the microwave it was still tender, moist and quite flavorful.

I love this recipe.  The only change I made was to cut the tenderloin up into 1 inch cubes and grill as kebabs for about 12 minutes. Goes wonderfully with grilled cherry tomatoes and orzo pasta tossed with butter, olive oil and lemon juice.

marinade made the pork so tender...a tad on the sour side.  But delicious just the same.  Will definitely make again.

My mom talked me into trying this recipe, even though I'm not a big fan of pork. I'm glad she did! The tenderloins turned out very tasty and tender. It's a VERY easy main course for guests because you can prepare the day before and let marinate overnight.

A huge hit with my husband!  He's a huge pork fan (I'm not), so I made this with him in mind.  He enjoyed the tangy marinade and how tender the meat was.  To my surprise, so did I!  To keep things even, I've also made this with chicken, which I prefer, but with either pork tenderloin or chicken breasts, this is a recipe we will use again and again.

I wanted to make a greek inspired meal so I made this tenderloin. The only thing I did different was I used lemon juice instead of lime, and I used fresh oregano in place of the dried. I grilled them for about 30 minutes on a charcoal grill putting the lid on for half the time. I served this with "greek orzo salad" that is also on this website. The one thing we did not like was this was a bit too tangy for our taste I would perhaps cut down on the lemon juice it overpowered all the other flavors.

This is a wonderful marinade recipe for pork, whether using a loin or chops.  I reduced the amount of marinade I make as well to about 2/3 of the recommended recipe.  I have made this recipe several times with great reviews from company.

Very flavorful.  I used butterfly chops and marinated them overnight.  Perhaps they were too thick because the interior was a little dry...I'll try thinner tenderloins next time, but marinade was wonderful

This recipe was a hit for my Sunday dinner last night.  My pork was 1.8 lbs and I didn't know if I should slice it or not before putting it on the grill.  I did slice it and it took about 20 minutes to reach medium.  I also made half as much marinade and that was perfect.

My husband really liked this marinade and commented on how good it was, which is a real compliment since he usually never offers any comments on anything.  I will definitely only make half of the marinade next time as it was way too much.  I made it on my rotisserie and it turned out really good.

We loved this tenderloin.  My husband made a breakfast burro with some of the left overs and said it was a huge hit at work also.  We had yummy shredded pork sandwiches for lunch too.  TRY IT!  YOU'LL LOVE IT!!!

A huge hit!  I cooked it using country pork ribs as well.  The plastic bag is a great idea, but if you don't have one large enough, just marinate in the fridge.  Same delicious results.

I have tried many pork loin recipes and this is, hands down, the best!  My family loved it!!  I followed others advice and used fresh onion and garlic.  Baked in the over at 400 for 40 minutes.  It was perfectly done.

The only deviation that I made form the recipe is that I gave it a really light brush of honey about 3 minutes before I pulled it off the grill. Highly recommend.

Easy and delicious.  Try to marinate it as long as overnight.  It does make a tender piece of meat even more tender.

I don't see why many rave about this. I used lemon juice instead of lime juice, but that was the only deviation from the recipe.  I marinated it for about 7 hours and then grilled it.  It had an overwhelming lemon flavor.

A good marinade to penetrate the meat.  I only had one lime so reduced the rest of the ingredients to keep the proportions right..except the salt..kept that at 1 t.  It was plenty to coat the tenderloin.  It thawed in the marinade and since it was too cold to grill I  braised it in an oven-proof skillet and finished it off in a 450 degree oven.  I think if oregano doesn't suit your taste, rosemary would work well instead.

This was delicious! Halved it like some suggested. I wasn't prepared to grill so I seared it for 10 minutes and then cooked it in the oven at 400 for 30min. I also left some marinade and added some tomatoes to the dish half way through. When finished. I sliced it and laid it on a  bed of salad with the marinade as a dressing with some tomatoes. Was so tender and flavorful. Will repeat!

Fantastic.  I've made a number of similar recipes, so I was reluctant to try this one...but it was simply outstanding.  I believe that simple cooking with fresh ingredients yields the best outcome, and this recipe certainly qualifies.  I used a 3lb boneless pork loin and halved the marinade as many suggested and marinated for 8 hours.  I only had 4 limes, so I added 1 lemon to get up to the required 3/4 cup.  I used only 2 tablespoons of oregano as 3 just seemed like too much to me.  My family loved it.  Paired it with roasted sweet potatoes and a salad.  Really nice, simple recipe and

This one is a solid 4 1/2 for me.  I really loved the tang from the lime juice, it was such a different flavor than I'm used to for pork.  I had this as both dinner and used some for an egg scramble the next day.

I did make a couple of minor changes.  I was unable to get pork tenderloins, so I used a 3 1/2 lb pork roast that I split before marinating, and due to apartment living, I was unable to grill, so I baked at 350 for 45-60 minutes.  I did also let marinate for 2 days, not just overnight as I normally do.

Being a huge fan of all things pork, I have made this several times with the following modifications to my taste.  I halved the recipe since I cook for 2; I used a combination of equal parts lemon and lime juices and used about 3 tsp. minced garlic.  I knew it would be overwhelming to my friend so I cut back the oregano to 1.5 - 2 T and used some thyme, maybe 1/2 tsp or so.  We love pork tenderloin done this way and it is truly very moist and tender.  I have both grilled and broiled and it is wonderful either way.

Fantastic! Had my in-laws and our best friends over for dinner and decided to try several new recipes. I used fresh lemon juice instead of lime and my husband grilled over charcoal instead of gas and everyone loved it. I've already recommended this to my sister.

I cut my pork tenderloin into 1 to 2 inch steak and only used 1/2 the marinade. Grilled them on the barbecue. They were so tender and juicy. Just the right amount of seasoning. It was fantastic. Used the left overs for Greek pita's. They were as good as any I have had in Greek restaurants.

I was really suprised at this recipe... i toned down the lime juice a little (1 cup) then seared on grill finished with indirect heat.  Very nice, juicy tenderloin...  as with any tenderloin be sure to let rest before carving.

Eyeballed all the ingredient amounts, subbed lemon juice for lime, subbed italian seasoning for oregano, cut way back on the seasoning amount, and the family LOVED it!

It was hard to determine what was too tart and too sweet without over-adding any particular ingredient.  It turned out pretty good in the end.

Wow, this was good. I subbed lemon juice for the lime juice. If you have the time definitely marinate this longer than 5 hours. And make sure the marinade is very well salted. Can't wait to make this again though.

A great and easy to prepare recipe - without even reading the reviews, I cut the marinade ingredients to 1/3 of the original. I also used fresh oregano, chopped and added freshly ground pepper. The meat was moist and flavourful. 
Thanks for the tasty recipe, Dave.

I loved this recipe it was very refreshing and clean tasting. I cooked it on the BBQ on a low heat for 3 hours. My guests raved and ranted over this. I did use fresh limes and I would make this again any day, it was simple and no clean up. Love it Love it.

My husband and I really enjoyed this recipe.  I served it with Oregano Cubed Potatoes and Greek Style Green Beans (recipes from this site)and a Greek Salad.  I also roasted it as I was too lazy to get the coals going.  Next time, though I will just add the potatoes to the pork and drizzle with the marinade in one dish.

Awesome recipe, my family loved it.  I have to add a little more olive oil though, because the lime tends to be a little overpowering for my taste.

This is a great marinade!  Left it in the fridge for about 3 hours and then grilled...we loved the sour lime taste and it wasn't overwhelming.

YUM!! I used 1 cup lemon juice and a 1/2 cup of freshly squeezed lime juice. Cut the oregano down to 3 tablespoons and added 2 tablespoons of greek seasoning. Also, I didn't want to use up all of my expensive olive oil so I swapped it with canola. So good!!

I've served this recipe so many times over the last couple of years, and it always gets rave reviews, kids love it too! Last time was New Year's Eve and I added some fresh tangerine & navel orange juice, since I was running short on lime juice and it worked well. I've lost track of the times I've printed the recipe to give to friends. It can also be cooked in thr oven if you don't have time to use the grill.

Wondereful!!!  I used two .75lb. tenderloins,  marinated for a little under 3 hours.  The meat was very moist and the lime juice gives it a nice subtle tangy flavor.

I decided to cook an entire Greek meal for friends and I found all the recipes I used on this site. I marinated the tenderloins overnight so they would be very flavourful. I did substitute the lime for lemon because it seemed more Greek to me, but next time I will try with the lime just to get a comparison. Everyone was impressed with the meal. Very tasty recipe.

I used this recipe a couple of months ago when I had a hankering for souvlaki. It worked great! I cut up the tenderloin, 1 green pepper and one red, a chunked onion and cherry tomatoes (I poked a hole in the stem end for the marinade) in a big tupperware dish and let the whole thing marinate all day. Skewered it, grilled it and served it wrapped in pita bread with feta cheese and tzatziki. Yummy!

delicious, easy, and different!  Used a garlic press instead of slicing the garlic and it was even quicker.  It sat in the fridge for 6 hours and was perfect.

I am only giving this 3 stars because it was rather bland.  The marinade was very tasty, but it didn't give the meat much flavor, even after marinading it for 5 hours--maybe overnight would've been better.

My hubby now actually likes something I cook! LOL!  This is VERY EASY and you use ingredients you have on hand!  I actually use it on boneless pork loin chops and I don't even have to marinate them very long and they turn out great!  Try 'em, you'll definetly like them!

Used this recipe (with a few tweaks listed below) and received rave reviews and requests for recipe from everyone at our birthday dinner. Because timing for marinating was limited, I peeled 2 limes and put the flesh into my VitaMix along with 6 cloves of garlic, 2 T dried onion, olive oil, 3 T oregano, salt, a splash of dry sherry, and a tablespoon of peach jam (to cut tartness a bit). Marinated for about 3 hours. The meat was especially  tender and juicy and the flavors wonderful. Superb recipe which is adaptable to whatever tweaks cook may need to make.

This was excellent.  I used two fresh limes for the juice (I was only making half the recipe) and I cut the salt by half.  Even my picky four year old liked this.  I would make this again.

Very good but the flavor didn't seem to seep through into the entire tenderloin.  Used the BBQ and it turned out great.

Wow!!!!! What a great recipe! I marinated for about eight hours and watched the tenderloins very closely on the grill. Great flavor. Didn't quite have all the lime juice that I needed but it didn't seem to matter. Also, used bottled lime instead of fresh. I thought the oregano might be too much but it was perfect. I don't think I have ever had a more moist and juicy pork tenderloin. I cannot wait to make this again and for company.

Delicious!  Very easy to make.  I did marinate overnight as people suggested.  I loved the lime/oregano taste.  I used a cut up pork roast and grilled to perfection.  Very moist and tender.  Thanks for the post!

My whole family raved about this recipe.  It was gone by the next day.  It is even great cold!  We did decrease the lime juice (I believe we only added 1 cup).  Otherwise, PERFECTION!

This was a very simple and yummy way to serve tenderloin!  Unfortunatly I was the only one eating it, as my kids thought the flavors were too strong.  I probably wouldn't make it again for that simple reason.  I'm sure others have tried and loved this recipe!

I used only 1 cup of lime juice. I was worried the marinade might be too tart. I marinated the pork for five hours before roasting. The pork was delicious! Very tender, zesty. Lime and oregeno flavored the pork, but not overpowering.  I served it with orzo (olive oil, lemon, dill) and greek salad. Very delicious! Will make again.

Absolutely delicious!  An impressive dish to serve to company.  We couldn't get enough of it.  I made a 5 lb. tenderloin, cut in thin slices and poured juices over the top to serve - the marinade makes plenty.  Used only 4 T. of oregano as 6 seemed too much.

Very good! 

I cut down all the ingredients in the marinade, by about a third, since I didn't have enough lime juice, but the flavor was still great!  I think I would just put the garlic through the garlic press next time instead of peeling and slicing it. I will definitely make this again!

Intresting taste. Be sure to use chopped oregano b/c ground will make the marinade a green goo.  I probably will not make this again.

I wouldn't change a thing about this marinade!  I use a whole tenderloin and grill it really slowly on indirect heat.  The slow grill takes over an hour though.  It always comes out juicy and flaverful.  Just make sure you let it marinate long enough.  It's really good served with garlic mashed potatoes and salad.

This marinade smelled absolutely wonderful while the pork was marinading and I tested it to make sure it wasn't too sour, but when it was cooked all I could taste was the lemon. I might try making it again with a lot less lemon. I think it's just my own personal taste, not the recipe.

This was delicious.  I didn't use the full 6 T of oregano, as it seemed like it would be overpowering.  I used maybe half the amount and it was very flavourful and moist.  So simple and everyone always loves it.

Pork is not a regular meat used in our home, since we've never found any recipes we enjoyed, but that's all changed now!! This recipe is delicious. My picky boyfriend loved it, and says it's a keeper.  I did cut the recipe in half, as previously suggested.

I reduced the amount of lime juice to 1 cup and the oil to 1/2 cup which was plenty of marinade for the amount of pork.  My husband said it was the best marinade I've made for pork tenderloins.  Will make again.

A very tasty recipe - I only made a few changes.  I did as some suggested and decreased the amount of lime to 1 cup, which was plenty.  The pork definitely still had a tangy bite to it.  Also, I added 1 teaspoon of black pepper.  It needed just a bit of spice to it..  A tasty recipe!

This was tasty and very easy -- I marinated overnight and prepared on the grill.  I only used 1 cup of lime juice (that's all I had) and more garlic (I ran it through the garlic press, didn't slice).  I actually prefer rosemary with pork, but the lime, garlic and oregano were a nice change.

I used half lemon juice and had to bake it in the oven.  Nice flavor, I 'd like to try it on the grill next time.

I used bottled lime juice (with fresh, maybe 5 stars??) and marinated for 24+ hours.  Nice flavors, nothing too overpowering.

I always have trouble cooking pork but this turned out great, although it was a tad dry.  I didn't have lime juice so I used key lime juice instead and it gave it a nice, tropical kick.  I will definitely make this again...a nice dish for a low-carb diet.

I didn't give this 5 stars because it had way too much oregano in it.  Otherwise it was very good.  The olive oil causes the grill to flare up, searing the meat.  Thank you for this recipe.

Awesome marinade!  Very zesty!  Used powder garlic, added finely chopped purple onion for added flavor!  The lime makes it taste soo good!  It's a keeper!  Thx for sharing!

Very good.  The flavor in the first bite was incredible, but by the end of the meal it was a little overpowering and I am sure that is b/c it stayed in the marinade too long.  I will definitely make this again, but next time I will marinate for no more than 5 hours.  In addition, I will put a little less lime juice and a little more oil.

This recipe is great, it has become a staple in our dinner rotation.  I usually make it with bottled lemon juice to save time, but am sure it would be even more unbelievable with fresh lime juice.

AWESOME! Had this for dinner tonight. It was so simple and so tasty! I only made half a recipe of the marinade because I thought I only had a pound of tenderloin. Turns out it was almost 2 pounds but the marinade was more than sufficient. I'll definitely put this in my permanent file.

This recipe was only OK, but it was no one's fault but my own! I only had thick boneless pork chops, and a Foreman Grill to cook them on!
We stuck them in the oven for a while to finish cooking, but they got a little dry.
The marinade was great though, and like everyone else I could have gotten away with about half the amount for the 1.5 lbs. of chops.
Served with garlic and olive oil cousocous for a pleasant meal!

Sorry just not very impressed, the lime was definitely too overpowering.  If I was to do something similar in the future I would use lemon juice rather than lime.

Oregano & Lime? I love them both (separately), so I thought I'd give this a try. Too bad I did. Tasted really weird. Definitely NOT a keeper.

This truly is the best.  Try using a bunch of fresh oregano instead of dried.  I used sea salt too, but will cut down on it next time because it was a bit salty.

BBQ'd the Grecian porkloin last night....outstanding....grilled portabella mushrooms and baked sweet potatoes made it perfect!
