This soup is amazing.  I work as the head chef at a local country club, and I made this soup for my members.  I had nothing but compliments.  I added a little white wine for extra flavor.  I would definitely recommend this soup to everyone.

Very good recipe.  Pasta does balloon when left in liquid.  Might be good to cook pasta seperately and add to soup per serving.  Excellent flavor.

Yum! I used Jimmy dean light bulk sausage, italian herb mix in place of rosemary, basil & sage, and subbed low sodium veggie broth for half of the chix broth. I added more celery and 2 bay leaves too. I boiled whole wheat rotini pasta separately until almost done, then finished it in the soup. Best part: we had a snow storm, and I already had all of the ingredients on hand! Next time, maybe no pasta (bread instead!) and add chopped spinach at the end.

This soup was great - we used Portuguese sausage instead (chourico) since my husband is Portuguese and I've been trying to find recipes where I can use it as he loves it! And I also substituted diced potatoes for the pasta.  It was great and definately stay in my permanent box of recipes!

Good and easy to put together on the spur of the moment with ingredients I most often have at hand.  Rather than the individual seasonings I just used a tablespoon of my favorite Tuscan seasoning. My own tomatoes put up from my garden filled in for the canned, although I would have been just as happy with the canned.  I used a combination of beef and chicken broth, and cannellini beans (white kidney beans). I added a good glug of red wine, threw in a rind from Parmigiano-Reggiano during the simmer, and added some chopped fresh baby spinach at the end.

This soup is easy to make, hearty, filling and delicious.  I used 2 cans of beef broth and 1 can of chicken since that's what I had on hand.  This is a great dinner to keep ingredients on hand for and throw together at the last minute!

This soup is easy and fabulous!  I've made it several times, always to rave reviews.  I have only made very minor adjustments: increased the celery to three stalks, increased the pasta to 1 3/4 cups, and added 1/2 cup white wine and two bay leaves once the ingredients are all simmering together.  I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but this recipe is absolutely amazing!  Try this .. you won't be sorry!

It was pretty good, but I think next time I'll leave out the noodles.  The sausage and the rest was the best part, I thought the noodles got in the way.  Very tasty, though.

Good sausage soup. Not as good as some of the others on here such as the original Sausage Soup, but still very good.

This was excellent!  Used a spicy sausage and added some spinach.  Next time, I'd like to try adding kale.  I did cook the ditalini pasta separately but actually found the pasta unnecessary and may not even use it next time.

Very good comfort food.  I used chicken mild Italian sausage links and fire roasted diced tomatoes.  I kept my portion pasta free, it was delicious.

Very tasty! I also used potatoes instead of noodles since noodles seem to get mushy in soups.

VERY TASTY!! My husband just loves it & suggests I make it often :). Today was a good day for it as it was minus 40 below zero celcius. The changes I made were to replace the kidney beans (YUCK>>>never did like those things) with garbanzo beans (aka chick peas) omitted the rosemary (another yuck) and used 1/2 the amount of crushed red chile pepper & pasta. also I added about 1/2 cup of chopped red pepper. 
  I sliced, buttered & toasted under the broiler a baguette, took it out of the oven & put some "4 cheese shredded Italiano" cheese on them & popped them back under the broiler for another minute. For us, it went perfect with the soup. Thanks for sharing the recipe :) it's a keeper for sure!

Flavorful and not terribly time consuming, however I didn't measure out the pasta and I guess I put more than 1 cup because by the end of the night it ended up absorbing nearly ALL the cooking liquid!!! I couldn't believe it. Anyway I would probably still make it again but with less pasta. I also omitted the celery and sage to suit my preferences.

Absolutly delicious after a few changes:
-14.5 oz can Fire Roasted Diced Tomatoes instead of regular canned tomatoes
-Chipotle Chilli Pepper Seasoning instead of Red Pepper Seasoning
-16 oz. Dry roasted Extra Firm Tofu instead of Kidney Beans

The first time I made this recipe I didn't like the bland flavor of the kidney beans.  For such a flavorfull soup I thought it took away from the taste.  I dry roasted the tofu and added it when I was supposed to add the beans and WOW!  What a difference!  Try it, you can thank me later!

Great recipe with unusual spices.  As suggested, we added Pecorino Romano grated cheese to the finished product and believe it or not it brought everything together.  Had to add more chicken stock because hubby likes liquidy soup.  Yum!

This recipe was very good.  I used ditalini, turkey sausage and scut up some fresh spinach.  I also added extra broth because the pasta really absorbs it.  Will make again... thanks!

This soup was delicious and so easy!  I made it to take to a sick friend, and we both loved it.  I started in a pan too small to fit all the broth, so only used about 2.5 cups of chicken broth to the 1 pound of sausage and only one small onion, plus I left out the noodles.  It as fabulous.  The herbs are great!

Just great soup! I used Jimmy Dean Italian sausage (in a roll), fresh basil and rosemary, no beans, no red pepper;the sausage had plenty of herbs in it and salt, so I used no-salt tomatoes and chicken broth and it all came out perfect; oh, also added kale as I'm always trying to work this healthy veg into recipes.

This is a very good recipe and takes even less time if you just add everything all at once and cook until the pasta is done. Yum!

Ooh wee!! Oh my goodness!!!!  This is off the hook!! My tips: 1 T olive oil, Jennie-O Sweet Italian Turkey sausage, 1 cup onion, 4 med. carrots, 3 celery stalks, 1 T minced garlic, 1 t dried basil, 1/4 t dried rosemary, 1/4 t dried tarragon, 1/2 t oregano leaves, 1/2 t dried parsley, 1/2 t crushed red pepper, NO SAGE, 1 14.5 ounce can petite diced tomatoes, 5-6 cups chicken broth, 1/4 cup red wine, and 1 27 ounce can of kidney beans (do NOT drain them). Cook the pasta (or rice) separately and add it as it is eaten; the soup is great with or without the shells. You'll love it...my mom sure did :)

I served this recipe for bookclub and everyone loved it. I changed the recipe just a bit by adding turkey smoked sausage, 2 chopped zuchini, 2 cans beef broth and a handful of chopped kale. I kept everthing else the same.
It was terrific.

I have made this many times and every time --everyone asks for the recipe. I have a teenage family member that always asks me to make this just for him every Christmas. This is all he wants. So every Christmas he gets a pot of this soup for his present and he is over joyed. It is sooo easy to please him.

This soup is fantastic! It's super easy to make and comes together really quickly. To change it up a bit sometimes I'll add spicy tomatoes to give it a kick. My husband is a soup nut and he requested this one be put on permanent rotation!

I used ground mild sausage and omitted the carrots (a personal preference) and used homemade chicken stock to cut back on the unintentional sodium. Awesome!!! :-)

I noticed some reviews about how this recipe wasn't "soupy" enough. I added additional stock and used orzo as the pasta.

This was so good that I had to make a second batch to send home with my father. Four of us polished off the whole first batch and had no room left for the dinner that I made. It was delicious! The only things I did differently was to use a can of diced tomatoes with garlic and onion and I heaped the tablespoon of garlic. Yummy!!! Thank you so very much for sharing this recipe. I waited until about 15 minutes before serving to put in the shells so they wouldn't swell too much. If you can't do this, I would suggest using the tiny shells or the small tubular pasta instead. Excellent recipe as written!

This soup is PHENOMENAL! I followed the recipe except for the addition of a bay leaf, some zucchini and yellow squash and using white beans as well as kidney beans, since I had all of these things on hand.  Also I threw in some chopped baby spinach when I added the pasta and it adds a nice color and flavor to the soup, as well as vitamins :) I will most definitely be making this again, 5 stars all the way!

Won't be making again because there are other Italian sausage soups I like much better. The pasta absorbed most of the broth so it wasn't "soupy."

Great soup!  I had to make a couple changes though.  I didn't have celery so I added some celery seed, and didn't have dried basil so I threw some fresh in the last 10 minutes.  Also I used a small type penne for the pasta.  Had a small amount of chopped cooked chicken I threw in as well.  Nice flavor and we really loved it!  Thanks!

Loved it!  I accidently put more crushed red pepper than it called for, but it came out great anyway.  The diced tomatoes I used were seasoned (I think with basil, garlic and ..?).  I pre cook the shells, dice up one potato and added it with the veggies and threw in a bay leaf.  Will definately be making this again.

AWESOME!  I made exactly as written except to make it healthier I used Jenny-O sweet italian turkey sausage and also used fat free low sodium broth.  I also used a whole wheat pasta and threw in some fresh spinach.  This tasted wonderful.  It is highly seasoned and is hearty and yummy!  In my opinion it is important to cook the pasta in the soup as it absorbs the broth and gets a lot of flavor.  Cannot wait to make this again, was definitely a hit!

simply the best soup ever! I make this when I have a big group to feed, it is hearty and delicious - and easy to make! I always get tons of compliments. I also added some marinara sauce (or any basic spaghetti sauce will do) to thicken it up a bit and add flavor.

Truly an excellent recipe. I used both mild and hot Italian sausage and it really helped to improve the flavor. Followed the recipe other than that and would strongly advise doing so on the first time. Adjust after you know what it is supposed to taste like.

What a great combination.  I eliminated the beans and pasta and used Turkey Sausage as another reviewer suggested.  I substituted 1/2 cup quinoa and 1/2 cup barley and diced up 2 large garden tomatoes for the pasta and beans as my husband can't have beans. Excellent!!

I liked this recipe. I did exchange celery and carrots for spinach (frozen and thawed) and mushrooms. I did keep the pasta seperate until serving like others suggested. Very yummy! My husband is already asking to make again...

An excellent soup with great flavour, I used butter beans instead of kidney beans it gave it a milder flavour. I also drained my italian sausage well after cooking in order to cut down the fat in this recipe. I think spinach would compliment this recipe well.

This recipe is SO surprisingly good! My husband thought it looked bland, but when he took a bite, he was so surprised and ate two bowls. My whole family loved it. I just used my dry spices from my spice rack and it turned out great!

We used orzo for the pasta, and 1 tsp. of ground celery seed instead of celery (picky 4 yr old) and this soup got rave reviews in our house!  We also added a little salt and pepper.  Definetly a keeper!

This is a wonderful recipe! It is easy to make, and soooo good! I took other's advice and cooked the pasta separately, then added it before I served it. I had it again for lunch today and it was delicious!

Great recipe, it was tasty but I think it could still have used more flavor like added herbs.
I added three cups of pasta instead of one and instead of using chicken broth I dissolved a chicken bulion cube in water. (maybe thats why it was lacking in flavor just a tad)

Other than that, very good, will make again!

I didnt have the sage or fresh garlic. I added a bit of garlic powder and left out the sage. I added more spicy sausage. It was great. Just like all the other feedbacks. Leave the pasta on the side and add as needed.

This recipe is great! I made a few substitutions/additions that really make it come to life: 

-Zucchini instead of carrots
-Add 1/2 teaspoon tarragon (this balances the spice)
-All fresh herbs
-Double the amount of crushed red pepper
-Extra basil!!
-Extra Garlic!!
-Add to the soup a couple slices of dried porccini mushrooms in a tea strainer while simmering (adding this to any italian soup/sauce greatly enhances the flavor)
-Remove the zucchini after stir frying, and then add it to the soup at the same time as the noodles--this keeps the zucchini from getting super mushy

LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS!! Boyfriends sister made it for us in California, told me where she got the recipe, so I had to try when we got home. This is fabulous, easy, and hearty! I used 1 lb Italian sausage with 2 links of "spicy" Italian sausage to give it an extra kick, adjusted vegie and spice quantities to compensate and added 1 1/2c uncooked pasta shells. I made extra so we could share with a friend who's girlfriend was OOT, he loved it too! We served it with toasted Bollilo's-MmmmmMmmmm GOOD!

Tried it loved it. We have it on a cold winter"s night. However, I cook the pasta separately and add  an appropriate amount to each bowl as I serve it.  I keep the pasta in a plastic bag in the refrigerator until the soup is gone.

Terrific soup and easy.  My family loves it. We leave out the pasta and add more beans.  Also have made without the sage because I did not have any and it was still great.

This is wonderful! Everyone loved it, including 2 kids. It was very easy to make, fairly inexpensive, and very zesty. I did change a few things..My husband cooked the sausage whole by mistake, so we just sliced them up. I cooked the onions, celery and carrots in the left over grease from the sausage until soft. I also used 2 cups of shells instead of one. The next time I make this I will try to use turkey sausage instead. This is definately going into our regular rotation!

This soup is like a burst of lovely flavors.   The only thing I changed was to add only 4cups of chicken stock and a couple cups of water.  It didn't water down the flavor at all.  Very good!

Totally awesome!  Added 2 tbsp of tomato paste, white wine, 1 red pepper, half green pepper (as I didn't have any celery), 2 bay leaves, and replaced the chicken stock with vegetable stock.  I'm sure it would have tasted just as well without the tweaks.  Thanks!

Excellent soup.I added a can of corn and decided not to put in the pasta.Next time I might not add the extra spices as it had tons of flavor and I didn't think it was necessary.

This soup is delicious! Every time we eat it my husband tells me that it's the best soup ever! I make it and freeze it for busy weeknights, so I omit the pasta and either use potato instead, or I'll just add the pasta when heating up the soup before serving. I use thyme instead of sage and only a dash of rosemary as I find it a little too strong in the soup. Definitely a great alternative to eating the same old soup!

This was very tasty but not quite as hearty as I was expecting.  It may be because I cooked the pasta separately so they did not soak up the excess broth.  Also, I made this in the crock pot - so easy to throw it all in in the morning and let it sit - flavors melded together very well.  Overall, great soup!

Both hearty and comforting as well as complex and elegant.  A wonderful recipe.  I made it for my family and after two bowls they were still looking for more. I subbed one cup of dry white wine for broth as another had suggested and also used chorizo sausage instead of italian.  Didn't need the crushed red pepper as the chorizo is hot enough.  Thanks so much!!!!

Thank you so much it was delicious  I am one who is totally intimidated by soups but this was so easy and taste so good.  I did add some white wine, extra garlic--Im a garlic gurl :) and I add the pasta separately in the bowls then added soup to it it was fabulous  My boyfriend loved it--youre making me look good thank you

This was my second time making this one and it is yummy, and perfect for the awful frigid weather we are still having in March...  I didn't really make any changes except using beef broth rather than chicken, because I like the flavor of it better with the sausage.  Also, I left out the sage and added some oregano instead.  Wonderful soup!

This is excellent.  I use sweet, and hot italian sausage to give this a kick.  Great on a cold day with your favorite bread.  I use orzo, and not too much because it does soak up your broth.  Everyone who tries this wants the recipe. Good Luck !

This soup was really good!  After all of the comments about the pasta ballooning up, I decided to use sliced potatoes instead which worked out well.  I will definitely make it again this winter!

had some Italian Turkey Sausage to use and chose this recipe ... turned out very good and I'll be making this again ... I think next time I might use Great Northern Beans instead of Kidney Beans though ... I also think that this would be good with some mushrooms in it ... seasonings were perfect as written in the recipe ...

I brought this soup to one day for a potluck lunch at work. Since then, my co-workers are relentless requesting to have me bring this soup at every function. This soup is easy to make and gets rave reviews. I prepare the soup in advance and re-heat it the next day in my crock pot.

This was easy and exceptionally tasty!  I added a lot more of the seasonings though (I probably doubled them).  I also added some of my Pampered Chef Italian Seasoning as well.  I had a mixture of penne and shell pasta on hand and used those; it worked fine.  The only thing I'll do next time is increase the chicken broth (I used the equivalent of water and boullion cubes for 5 cups of broth) to maybe 6 or 7 cups as I like more broth in my soups.  I think the shells absorbed a lot of the liquid.  Very yummy though; my husband ate 5 bowls at once!

This soup is very flavorful.  I will try to save you some time and say that I agree with several other reviewers that the amount of pasta called for is excessive.  I just cooked the pasta separately and put it in the bowl with the soup on top.  The whole family loved it!

This was excellent! I also made a few adjustments. I boiled the noodles seperately and added them at the end to the soup. Since I didn't have 5 cups of broth I used one can of broth and 2 chicken cubes (and water). Also I used oregano instead of rosemary since I didnt have any and a bay leaf.

Fabulous dish and relatively easy to make. I used sweet italian sausage, but would definitely try adding some hot sausage as well next time.  As others stated, you do need to add more broth then the recipe calls for, and I also used frozen spinach for convenience.  Served with crusty bread to sop up the wonderful broth.

Made some changes to make it healthier:
- Added fresh basil
- Added package of frozen spinach
- Used low salt, low fat chicken broth
- Used diced tomatoes with chili peppers
- Used small elbow macaroni
- Left out rosemary, celery & sage
- Left casings on sausage, cooked separately, drained fat, patted dry and chopped up sausage.

Delicious!!!

This was excellent-- even according to my "soup-skeptical" spouse!  I substituted black beans and rotini pasta (because I had them on hand), and it was wonderful.  I DID cook the pasta separately and add it just before serving.  Love it!

They only thing I did different was I used tarragon instead of rosemary and northern beans instead of kidney beans because that is what I had on hand.  Served this to my company and they ate it up.  I will use this often this winter.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

This was a great tasting filling soup.  I cut the oil in half as well as the sausage but I doubled the beans....one can of red and one can of white.I even added some zucchini that I had in the fridge.  I am sure I will make this again.  Thanks DOLAN1031!

Instant classic for our house. I made a whole recipe and after eating one bowl, watched my friend eat the entire rest of it in less than 24 hours. We ate it with a fresh loaf of sourdough bread, which was good for dipping in the soup and soaking up the remainders. I didn't think the pasta shells were especially necessary -- I may leave them out next time.

Really good, fast soup.. I substituted the kidney beans with garbanzos since I had them in the pantry. Red pepper flakes add a little heat so don't add if you don't like soup slightly spicy.

I love this soup and make it all the time and receive rave reviews. I always had more broth b/c it's very thick otherwise and this makes it last longer too. I sometimes cut down on the rosemary b/c don't really like biting into it. I agree on the pasta -- best to cook separately and add per bowl. It also freezes much better without the pasta.

This soup was awesome and definitely a keeper.  The flavors were great.  I didn't have kidney beans and used cannellini beans instead.  I used a combo of chicken and veg broth too.  My picky kids cleaned their bowls.

SO good! While Mary P's Italian sausage & tortellini soup and Perri Pender's slow cooker Italian sausage soup are still my favorites, this certainly gives both a run for the money! What I like about this is the spice blend. My kitchen smelled like Thanksgiving and evoked thoughts of some of my favorite seasonal dishes (my hubs commented that the whole house smelled like I was preparing a batch of homemade stuffing and roasting a turkey in the oven!). :) For this reason alone, I'll be making this a "day after Tday" tradition! Although nearly perfect as is, I couldn't resist the urge to make a few changes.... Because I had it, I added a few glugs of red wine (cabernet). I also used half chicken, half beef broth (I thought beef broth would help bring out the flavor of the red wine). I subbed cannellini beans for red ones (hubs' preference) and ditalini pasta for shells (didn't have the latter variety). My final change was to add a couple handfuls of chopped spinach during the last couple minutes of cooking. Ciabatta rolls and a sprinkling of fresh grated Parm hit the spot! Thanks for sharing your delicious recipe, DOLAN1031! I'm kicking myself for waiting so long to give this a try! :-)

1st time-Used Jimmy Dean Sweet Italian Sausage and macoroni (which I cooked ahead separately and added after soup was just about finished.)
2nd time-Used Family Foods bulk Italian Sausage & Orzo pasta (which I cooked ahead separately and added after soup was just about finished.)
I liked the Jimmy Dean & the Orzo the best.

Excellent. I added about 3 more ounces of broth so I didn't let any go to waste, and about 1/2 cup more macaroni. Topped it off with cheese as I was serving. Delicious! Will make many more times! Thanks for sharing!

This was a  Big hit at my Family's Thanks giving Day party!! I followed all the instructions except I used beef Italian sausage and I also added my own touch by adding shrimp...I had left the dish earlier and when I came back to the party everyone was asking who made the dish!! I looked at the big pan and it was practically empty next time i will make more it is an excellent dish for any occasion. Also I love spicy so I added a lot of red pepper to my tasting... Great dish .. Thanks

What a great recipe!  I made it with jenny-o sweet italian turkey sausage.  I had to alter it slightly with what I had on hand (ditalini instead of shells, and I don't care for rosemary and sage so I used fennel seed instead).  My kids and I ate it up!

This was so easy and so filling on a cool Fall night!  My husband and 8 year old loved it, but the 6 and 4 year olds were unimpressed, but since it wasn't McDonalds that doesn't surprise me.  Will definately make this again!

Awesome and simple recipe.  Since I don't like kidney beans, I added chick peas instead.  I served it with warm asiago cheese bread and a simple salad.  It was phenomenal!  This recipe is an instant family favorite.

This soup was really good!  It reminded me of minestrone soup with Italian sausage in it.  It got even better the second day.  Will definitely make again!

Used double amount of ground sausage (instead of cased).   Added more Broth & used elbow noodles.  Great new soup!  LOTS of flavor &  SOOO easy to make. You can add more red peppers to spice it it up... be careful I almost added too much.

This soup is different and delicious! I followed the advice of several others and cooked the pasta separately, and I used corn pasta to keep the soup gluten free. The only other change I made was to add some cubed chicken breast, which I added with the sausage.

I made some changes based on what I had on hand.  I added 1/ 3 cup of rice instead of pasta.  I also doubled the broth and the spices and omitted the kidney beans and tomatoes.   I gave this 5 stars.   This seriously was the tastiest soup I've ever made.   My whole family loved it including my picky 8 year old! !

This is easy and good, but I didn't use the pasta.  I used 24 oz. of diced tomatoes, and it wasn't too much.  I added a little bit of fresh spinach to each bowl, which blended nicely, and I provided optional parmesan cheese. I used mild Italian sausage, but it still came out with a nice little kick (mild to medium).

This recipe was easy and delicious. I used beef broth and rotini noodles. I added 2 additional cups of broth since I used larger noodles.  I also added 2 bay leaves while simmering.  Great way to cook with Italian sausage.

This soup was easy to make and has a lot of flavor.  I didn't even add salt and pepper.  Delicious!  Quick enough to make for a weekday night.

This soup was great.  I added some extra broth though, as the pot looked a little light on liquid.  Also, I didn't have any shells on hand, but I had bowties and orzo.  When it came time to add the pasta, I chose the orzo because the bowties may have absorbed too much of the liquid.  In the end, the orzo was the right decision.  To everyone that complained about the pasta, try orzo.  They plumped, but not too large (about the size of long grain rice), they absorbed the flavor really well, and had a nice texture.  I used about 1-1/2 to 2 cups eyeballed.

This was great! I added portobella mushrooms, as well.

This soup is awesome!  It has become a family staple on cold days.  You can vary the type of sausage you use depending on how spicy you make it.  I have cooked it both on stove top and crockpot.  Both work well. Agree that pasta needs added near serving time or it does swell, but still taste very good. Try switching it up by adding squash.  Or even fresh spinach at the end just before serving.

Delicious!  I agree it could use more celery.  Also, the suggestion to cook the pasta separately is a good one, otherwise, the pasta sops up too much of the tasty broth.  For those who don't like heat, leave out the dry peppers or you'll find it much too spicy.

Very good.  I changed it a bit due to lack of ingredients and left out the celery and swapped the carrot for sweet potato.  Fab!  Highly recommended.

This is a great stew!  We did take out the pasta, though, to make it low carb.
