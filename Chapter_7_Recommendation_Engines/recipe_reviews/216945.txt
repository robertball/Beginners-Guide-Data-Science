I think that even beginner cooks would know to transfer the browned hamburger to a soup pot and add the remaining ingredients and continue cooking as directed.  I found it to be very easy, quick, and tasty.

I thought this was pretty good, but I personally didn't like the strong Italian herb flavors. I would cut down on parsley and basil in the future. I also would have hoped for more of a beef flavor, but it was more of a tomato/veggie broth flavor. I'd make it again with a couple adjustments.

I could not find pearl barley at my grocery store, so I used lentils instead. I don't think they gave the soup enough bulk or texture. Tossing in croutons at serving time seemed to do the trick. Next time if I can't find the barley, I would use small noodles (like ditalini). Also, I used 28oz of crushed tomatoes, instead of the 14 oz of diced tomatoes and tomato juice. Seemed to work well.  I also sprinkled grated parmesan and romano cheeses on the the top.

Very filling and delicious! I used low sodium broth and tomatoes and doubled the beef. I also used fresh carrots in place of the frozen vegetables and could see adding others (green beans, for example) the next time I make it. An easy, simple and yes, as the title says, hearty soup!
