As an Italian, my only objection to this recipe are the instructions to cook the pasta first, and set aside.  If you want your pasta "al dente" (angel hair easily overcooks anyway) I suggest the pasta pan be started only after the chicken is already cooking with the saut√©ed onion and broth.

This is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. I cut the recipe down to serve 2 and followed it almost exact with one exception. I doubled the amount of broth because it appeared a little dry. Instead of pouring the chicken mixture over the pasta, I added the cooked pasta to the skillet with the chicken mixture and heated it through for a couple minutes. It was so good, I made it two nights in a row!

I, too, like many reviewers thought this recipe sounded wonderful. The aromas from the seasoned chicken filled my kitchen, reminding me of the holidays. However, once the chicken dish was completely cooked, I was not impressed with the overall taste. It needed much more seasoning. It's hard to believe, given the amount you use on the chicken. Perhaps the chicken broth really dilutes the flavors. The only way I could save this dish was to add a can of crushed tomatoes. That is just what this dish needed! Only then could my family and I really taste the seasonings from the chicken. This dish was great, once I added the tomatoes!

This turned out awesome.  I made the following changes:  customized it to 2 servings, used half the amount of pasta, substitued chili powder for Cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper flakes as I had none, and used twice as much chicken broth.  It was easy and very good.  I added olive oil, salt, pepper, and parmesan cheese to the pasta while it was waiting for the chicken, and it turned out delicious!  Will definitely make again.

This was a very good dish. 
It gets more brownie points from me because I am watching my calories to lose weight (I used less oil), and trying to eat less red meat. I added white wine (a mix of sherry and chablis) in favor of chicken broth used a lot more garlic, and I used fresh herbs from my herb garden (which I think are a million times better than dried!). I don't think it would have been as good without the wine and the fresh herbs. I also left out the spicy stuff for my 6 year old, but I bet with it it would have been even better.

Very Spicy and full of flavor!  Don't let the negative reviews keep you from giving this recipe a try.  As with all recipes, you just have to tailor them to your tastes.  I cooked the standard amount of pasta I usually use for four servings.  Instead of measuring the spices I simply seasoned both sides of the chicken breasts liberally, then added some additional spice to the sauce.  I used one and a half cans of chicken broth, and to thicken sauce added 2tbsp. flour mixed with 2tbsp. broth close to the end of the simmering time.  The last minute of cooking I added a splash of skim milk, 2tbsp. fat free sour cream, and a couple cups of cherry tomatoes that I had sliced in half.  This created a lovely, fragrant, and rich sauce that is still fairly 'healthy'.  The cherry tomatoes added both zing and sweetness.  Served with broccoli on the side drizzled with the sauce...YUM!  Am excited about the leftovers I brought for lunch!

This recipe was great for the chicken and the sauce...very flavorful.  I however and my family did not like the angel hair pasta.  Made it again with regular spagetti noodles and they really liked that alot. I did add more creme to the sauce too.

I make this all the time, but not how it is written.  It is much easier, (and tastier) if you do it this way.  Chop raw chicken breasts into bite size pieces and brown in a skillet with 2 T. olive oil, chopped onions, garlic and spices until chicken is almost done.  Then add the broth to "deglaze" the pan. Spoon over the pasta and sprinkle with parmesan cheese.

What a great weeknight recipe!  I changed a few things, but not too much honestly.  I cut the pasta to 6 ounces.  I cut the chicken into bite sized pieces and tossed with the seasonings prior to cooking.  I cut the broth to 3/4 cup and mixed 1/4 cup of broth with 2 Tbsp corn starch to use as a thickening agent.  At the end, I tossee the angel hair in with the chicken/broth mixture.  We didn't have any leftovers!  I will make this frequently, especially on busy weeknights.

The chicken was delicious.  The pasta lacked flavor; it definitely needs to be seasoned somehow, as the "sauce" made from broth, onions and garlic doesn't do enough for me.  But the seasonings on the chicken were great and at least that portion of the recipe is a keeper!  Update: leftovers were better, well the pasta (chicken was still great).  The pasta soaked up some of the sauce and gained a nice flavor overnight.

Very good and easy dish.  I cut up my chicken breasts into large cubes instead of leaving them whole and it was great.  Lots of flavor and easy to make.

This has all the elements of a great meal. 1--it's simple 2--it's quick to cook 3--ingredients are almost always on hand.  It also tastes great! I did add a little more broth since some of the reviews said it was a little dry.  Once it was done simmering, I removed the chicken and added the pasta to soak up the flavors in the sauce.  I also added a couple handfuls of fresh baby spinach to make sure we get our veggies.  It was great!

Tried this last night and after adding lots of garlic and seasoning, it turned out great! my sweetie LOVED it! I brought 3 chicken breasts so we both had one and there was one left over, she immediately made a plate to take the rest of it to work for lunch the next day! I didn't call it first so she won and called me at work to say THANKS AGAIN because it was sooo good.

Very quick recipe but cut back on the chicken broth because it would have been to much liquid, I also used rice instead of pasta, and added some yellow and red peppers to the dish and it came out very nice and colorful with the basil and rosemary blended in. I also substituted Cajun seasoning with a pinch or two of cayenne pepper. LOVED IT!

This was VERY good.  Very moist and a wonderful flavor.  I made mine with linguini.  I didn't have any Cajun spices, so I used creole and it turned out really, really good.  I will definitely make this again.

This was great! Simple too. I used turkey breasts instead of chicken, and added lots of mushrooms - an essential addition in my opinion. A keeper!

This recipe was wonderful!  I was a little worried that it wouldn't be flavorful enough because there is so much pasta compared to what appears to be relatively little sauce, but it was VERY flavorful and wonderfully spicy.  I will probably add more chicken next time (and probably increase the sauce because of that), but I will definitely make this one again.

Reading from other reviews I was worried that it wouldn't have enough flavor so I added extra with salt. I enjoyed the spices but my only complaint is the oil. It was way too oily for me so next time when I make this I will not use 1/4 cup of oil.

Excellent and Easy, but could have used a little more flavor. I used wheat pasta, added fire roasted diced tomatoes like another reviewer, and threw in some basil and oregano. Next time I want to try with cooking wine, but I was out. I will make this again.

Used the basic recipe for the chicken, but added other spices (dashes of paprika, cayenne, chili powder, oregano) and also a can of diced tomatoes. Also left in the onions and garlic, but took out the pasta, turned out good and spicy!
Have a glass of milk with this one.

This is a wonderful recipe! I'll agree that it is one of the best recipes I've found on this site. My husband can not stand bland food and he loved this meal! It has great flavor and if you add the red pepper flakes just the perfect amount of heat. It would be a great meal for when you are entertaining. We will definitely make this again! I also added a little corn starch to thicken the sauce and cooked my chicken in bite size pieces.  I find the chicken faster and easier to cook that way.

No need to change a thing in this recipe. This is a keeper!  We tossed the sauce & pasta together - & served the chicken on top.  Easy, flavorful & made w/ ingredients we‚Äôve always got on hand.

This recipe was very fast and very flavorful.  The only thing I left out was the rosemary, but, other than that I followed the recipe exactly.  The red pepper flakes give this a nice heat.  This is a good after work dinner.

This turned out really good.  I also added about a cup of broccoli florets and half a green pepper (chopped) and sauteed them with the onions.  They added a lot of necessary flavor!  Very good!

Just didn't have enough flavor to support the cajun seasoning and crushed red pepper spice.  Will not make again.

This was a great recipe!  I did change it a little though...I used onion flakes instead of an onion and added 1/2 lb. of sliced fresh mushrooms.  I also cut the chicken into chunks.  Next time I would add more chicken broth as the pasta sort of overwhelmed the dish.  We enjoyed this very much and I will be making it again!!  Thanks Bethany!

The chicken turned out good and tasty, but the noodles weren't very flavorful with the olive oil mix over it.

I was totally surprised at how much the kids liked it even though it had onions in it!  This recipe is so simple and the amount of spices was perfect.  My only suggestion (which I got from another review) was adding some crushed tomatoes.  I didn't have any so I mashed up a can of stewed tomatoes and it turned out great!!  I'm definitely going to make it again!

Not impressed. It is simple and easy and edible but no different from your average chicken cassarole. You could just as easily throw this in a crock pot before work and have it ready when you get home instead of having a hungry family waiting 1 1/2 hour. Wouldn't make again. Sorry

Light and tasty...took ideas from reviewers and added more chicken broth, white wine and the pasta near the end to heat through...my husband wondered if this would work with clams?

This was awesome! The only thing I changed was I added about 1 tablespoon of balsamic vinegar. Delicious! Mix the balsamic with the spices and then dip the chicken in the mixture. I loved this recipe!

I liked this recipe. It was really good and easy to make on a week night. I made the recipe exactly as written and did not change a thing. No changes were needed. The chicken was delicious. A little spicy but I didn't mind that.

Wonderful, accurate recipe which I paired with Brussels sprouts (http://allrecipes.com/recipe/roasted-brussels-sprouts/detail.aspx)

I did change the recipe to yield a single serving, and the conversions were mostly accurate with the exception of the sauce. I used more olive oil and more garlic. I also added thin sliced button mushrooms with the garlic, and used some Wondra flour with the chicken stock to thicken the sauce a bit.

As previously posted (especially if you are making the brussels sprouts) WAIT on the pasta!! Start boiling your water no more than 15 minutes before you are ready to serve.

Amateur kitchen jockeys should allow more than 15 minutes of prep time ... that is not realistic.

Easy & quick. We cut the chicken up into chucks so the flavor could blend better with the pasta. Didn't change a thing, but did use both the Cajun seasoning & the red pepper flakes.

I made this tonight for my husband. 36 years of marriage and I have NEVER heard him rave about a recipe like he did this one. He must have said "this is good", "this is great" a dozen times while eating. He also said it was better than anything you'd get in a restaurant. The only change I made was to scale it for two, and omit the salt, because the Cajun seasoning I used has more than enough in it already. I do like the idea of more chicken broth though, and I will try that next time. Might make it 6 stars!

The flavor was ok, but I thought a whole cup of chicken broth was too much because the sauce never got thick, and it was too thin to eat over noodles.  Maybe it would have been ok over rice.

I didn't have any chicken broth or white wine to make a sauce, so when I cooked the chicken I put in a little butter, then added more olive oil when I cooked the onions and garlic. It worked great. A little parsley and parmesan on top, and it was delicious

My husband and I loved this recipe.  The broth gave a nice flavour to the noodles.  I misread the recipe and ran out of time, so I only simmered the chicken in the broth for 15 minutes but  it still turned out great.  I also added green onions like the recipe suggested.  I will definately make this again!

This was delicious..since I was cooking for one, some modifications were necessary.  I didn't have cajun seasoning, however a great "filler" is Goya AllSpice, I use it a lot.  This chicken was so flavorful and brought bland chicken back to life.  I added some parm. at the end too!

I do not like spicy food and based on reviews that this was bland overdid the spices the first time. The second time I used exactly what was called for and it was good, I did add salt prior to eating. This was a good chicken w/ pasta. I cut up my chicken prior to cooking because I was in a hurry & added a little cornstarch to thicken slightly. Cutting the chicken made this very easy to cook, mix together & eat.

This was a pretty easy recipe.  It did not produce alot of sauce, so the noodles were a little dry.  I would use more broth.  I would say you could double it, although it maybe a little too spicy then.  I was certainly good and I will be using this recipe again.

Very Good Recipe.  It's a good thing I cut the recipe to two cloves rather than three of garlic, it was almost overwhelming with the two.  But still highly recommended!

My boyfriend loved this.  I personally loved the chicken.  The chicken was flavorful and the pasta was a little bland, but it was nice and light.  I thought it tasted even better as leftovers.

Good flavors, my family didn't like it over angle hair pasta, the sauce was too soupy.  Will try again, but will add thickner to the sauce and we'd increase the seasonings.

This is a very tasty dish.  We added parmesan cheese and it added a little something.  It does make a little too much pasta, so we will cut that down next time.

Very blah. Even added tiny tomatoes and still no flavor. Needs more spice of some kind. Maybe some sesame oil would help. Would probably put in some mushrooms if we ever try it again.

The chicken was pretty good, but there wasn't enough of a "sauce" for the pasta.  Next time I might add some cream or corn starch to thicken the chicken broth.

This recipie is very tasty!  Spreading the sauce over the pasta gives it a nice zing that is hot, but not too hot.  I forgot to add the garlic, but it was wonderful without it.  This one is going in the recipie book!

I found this recipe a little bland, but I left out the cajun seasoning, so that may have something to do with it.  I'll probably try making it again, but I will definitely add some broccoli next time to give it some color and flavor, and modify the herbs a bit.

Quick and easy.  It is pretty garlicy, but I love garlic, so I thought it was delicious.  It makes a lot more than 4 medium portions, though.  I cut the recipe in half and my husband and I still had enough for 2 meals!

Only change I made was I mixed all the spices with some flour and dredged the chicken into that then pan fried. once chicken was done, I removed chicken then added the broth to the pan. since I had used flour, after cooking down the broth for about 5 minutes it was a lovely consistency. just right. Thanks for an easy meal!

I gave it 4 stars because my  husband and I didn't agree completely on this recipe. When I made it according to the recipe, I left out the chili powder and red pepper flakes because we don't like spicy foods, and just used Italian seasoning and garlic salt to season the chicken as I cooked it. I then sliced the chicken into strips as I sauteed the onion and garlic, and then put the chicken strips back in with about 3/4 of a can of chicken broth. I let it simmer for a while and then made a slurry of corn starch and chicken broth and mixed that in to thicken the sauce. I originally served it as so, and I was fine with the taste, but my husband thought it was bland and missing something. So I put his bowlful back in with the leftovers in the pan and added a can of diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings, as I had read from another reviewer. I brought my husband another bowl and he said it was perfect. So, I thought it was fine as-was, but I have a very sensitive palate and what others would consider bland or under-seasoned tastes fine to me. My husband didn't care for it when I followed the recipe, but with the addition of the can of tomatoes he was very pleased.

One word: AMAZING!!! My entire family loved this recipe & we have more than 1 picky eater. I actually made this because I didn't make it to the grocery store & this utilized ingredients already in the house. I made a few changes because of previous reviews & missing ingredients.  I didn't have fresh onion, so I used 1/2 cup dried onion flakes. Also, I sprinkled onion & garlic powder over the chicken. I also put additional  Rosemary & garlic into the liquid & deglazed the pan. The final change was 1 cup of  chicken broth & 1 cup of chicken stock.  This is definitely a recipe I will use over & over.

Based on feedback from another reviewer, I added the same amount of white wine as chicken stock.  Everything stayed moist enough and this was okay, just nothing special.

Wow! What a surprisingly easy recipe that tastes great! I used some leftover canned chicken that I had & it still came out tasting fabulous.

Also, at the final stages of cooking the chicken, I also added in some sun-dried tomatoes in the few last-minutes of cooking the chicken. It tasted great & I received many complements from my guests!

I followed this recipe except for the optional spices and I used scallions instead of onion as I had none. Was very disappointed because it did not have much flavor as I thought it would. I don't think I'll make this again even though it was an easy recipe.

Follow Judy's suggestion of adding a can o' diced tomatoes (with basil, garlic & oregano - drained).  I also added in some white wine and thickened up the sauce with cornstarch (ran through the sifter, to avoid lumps).  Topped with some fresh grated Parmesan cheese, and served with garlic bread.  Quick, easy dinner that I didn't have to pressure the kids to eat!

I thought this was delicious, especially since I am on a dairy free diet and crave pasta! I did add Italian bread crumbs to the chicken before frying it and followed the other reviewers advice to add the pasta to the chicken mixture.

Loved it!  I followed the directions exactly, however, I did thicken up the sauce with some flour.  This is a great alternative to the simple olive oil and garlic pasta that my husband and I love so much.  If you are expecting a rich, thick sauce, this may not be the recipe for you.  I will definitely make this again!

My family really enjoyed the chicken.  It was very flavorful.  The pasta sauce, however, was very bland.  So in the future I will just season the sauce up a little more.  But overall a great recipe.

Needs more seasoning than the recipe calls for. It was still a good balance of flavor, just too mild for my taste.  Next time I'll increase seasoning but keep the proportions.

I too enjoyed this recipe but thought it was a little bland at the end. I did all the steps the same, but instead of mixing the chicken and oil/seasoning mixture with the noodles, I extracted the chicken from the mixture and added it to the noodles. I then added my favorite Alfredo sause. YUMMY!

This is awesome. I added too much pepper though by accident. Mu husband loved it but I had a case of firemouth. Next time I will measure more carefully. We relly like hoe the chicken broth created a sort of "non-sauce". It was such a nice change from usual

This was delicious.  Didn't use red pepper, or cajun seasonings, but still delicious.  Also I used fresh herbs from my garden.  Even the picky eaters loved it!

Enjoyed this dish very much. Had plenty of flavor.  Although I added about 1/4 white cooking wine which I though added a nice touch.  Also, I made this dish with white rice which I think was perfect, the pasta didn't seem right with this dish. All in all a make again meal!

This was okay, but a little too bland for us.

Really Excellent recipe. Easy, but good enough for company. I took out the onion as none of us like it and I used rotini pasta as that is my daughters favorite and we all enjoyed it. Definately on my fav. recipe list

Wasn't all that impressed, and neither was my family.  Too plain and somewhat bland.  A good recipe if you're in a rush.

Chicken was great, but the pasta didn't soak up any of the flavor or spices.  It was rather bland and just an average recipe.  I won't be making this one again.

This was absolutely amazing! I kind of messed up on it since the house was really busy and I wasnt paying attention and accidentally added 2 cans of chicken broth instead of 1 (2 cups worth instead of one) so the sauce was thin, but I think I liked that BETTER then what it might have been. I also didnt have any onions so I used Onion Powder. I doubled the spices and used half on the chicken and half I threw in the sauce for more pizzazz.  This recipe is fairly spicy...but we're a spicy couple and we really liked it!

This will become part of my regular menu!!!

Great recipe! Because of the chicken broth, the meat came out wonderfully juicy. Instead of regular pasta, I used past which was pre-seasoned (lemon/garlic, by ronzoni) so that it wouldnt be too bland. Next time I would add more flakes and more cajun seasoning to give it a kick.

I have come to depend on this recipe - it's a hit with everyone! I added a little extra spices, because I like things hot. I tripled this recipe for the office party, it was gone almost immediately!

though individually the chickena and onions/garlic was good combined with the pasta it was bland and dry. It needs a sauce desperately as the pasta soaks up all the flavor and again the entire thing is to dry. i ended up eating the chicken by itself with ketchup.
