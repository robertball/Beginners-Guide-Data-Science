Well, being from Baton Rouge the word "cajun" caught my interest so I had to try this. Just had it tonight and found it delicious. The fish is mouth-watering tender and the sauce very good. I did have to make a few slight adjustments. I am not crazy about blackened seasoning so substitues Tony Cacheres Creole Seasoning. Added some extra mushrooms and some half n half to add some richness and cut back some of the salt. Cream of shrimp can be a little salty and I found that this combination helped eliminate that. Overall a very good dish. Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent recipe! I have made this two times now. The 1st time I couldn't find Cream of Shrimp soup so I used Cream of Mushroom and it was still good. If I used Mushroom again I would use 1 can and some Half & Half.  Soup mixture was very thick. I think it depends on which brand you use. The 2nd time I used Cream of Shrimp and BOY was it worth it. It was absolutely amazing. Use the Cream of Shrimp if you can find it. Will be using this recipe for a long time.

Awesome dish! Cooked this for our super bowl party last night and it was gone in an instant. I used catfish nuggets for an easy appetizer-like dish. This will be a regular in our house.

My family (none of which are huge seafood fans) LOVED this.  They kept talking about dinner long after the dishes were washed and put away.  I subbed Tilapia, added lemon pepper to sauce, used cooked cocktail shrimp (added just b4 baking) and about 1/2 the butter.  If no shrimp at hand, xtra mushrooms would be great.  Only baked for 20 minutes.  Great over plain white rice.  A real keeper!

This was absolutely fabulous!  I made it for my husband and he said it reminded him of something he'd get at the restaurant Pappadeaux.  I would probably not add as much butter next time but I have to admit it was yummy just the way it was.  I used precooked frozen shrimp and it worked just great.

This was good.  I did reduce the amount of butter in the recipe.  The only suggestion the husband made was that he thought it would be better with tilapia...and I happen to agree.  I think that catfish has too much flavor and it kind of drowns it out a bit.  We will definately use again, but will probably try with tilapia.  Thanks for the post.

My husband loved this recipe and went back for seconds!

For my seasoning, I used Garlic Pepper Blend and lightly used Seasoning Salt since others said it was too salty in the end.

Campbell's Soup makes the Cream of Shrimp Soup.  I'm not sure if it's sold in all 50 states or not.  I read where some people had problems finding it.

I used dried parsley since I already had it.

And I cooked fish in olive oil since a stick of butter for the recipe seemed like a bit much. 

Although I did use 4 tbl spool to saute the mushrooms, parsley, green onions and shrimp.

I served it over brown rice and it came out great.

My husband gave me a double A+ for presentation as well.

Great recipe!!!

My boyfriend and I absolutely adored this!  Oh goodness it was sooooo good over herb rice!  YUMMY!!!!! scaled down to four,  didn't have cajun blackened seasoning so improvised by using regular cajun seasoning, a pinch each of thyme, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, black and white pepper.  did use cream of shrimp soup.  It doesn't get much better than this.  Next time i might add a bit more spice, leave out the catfish and add crab and. . . . it is so GOOD!  thank you thank you thank you Lu Post!

This is, by far, the best thing I have ever made!  In the 10 years that I have been cooking for my family... I shocked my husband!  Of course, with a few adjustments.  Being in Alaska, I used halibut instead of catfish.  In step 3, I added a small can of mushrooms-undrained (instead of fresh), sweet onion instead of green, 1 can cream of celery soup and 1/2 cup sour cream (instead of the crm of shrimp).  And finally, served over fettucine noodles.  Yummo!  We usually pay $20 a plate for this at our local resturant!  Never again!!!

This was a good recipe--nice change of pace with catfish. I will make this again, though, I thought that it had too much butter involved--I'll try 1/4 cup next time.

This recipe was great and I will definitely make it again.  However, next time I will use half the butter. I served the dish over rice.

My very picky husband had seconds and asked me to make it again less than a week later.  I used cilantro instead of parsely and cream of mushroom instead of cream of shrimp.  I also added a tiny bit of half&half for richness.  I agree it was a tad salty but overall an excellant recipe.  Thanks!

Excellent! Very good recipe. I had to make some substitutions because I was short on some ingredients (white onion instead of green onion; dried parsely instead of fresh parsley and creole seaonsing instead of blackened seasoning; we also used the petite salad shrimp)...but it didn't even matter. We loved the end result. Next time we may try this with chicken.

Oh my goodness! This recipe was delicioooous! Neverthless, I made a few adjustments. I used cream of mushroom soup instead of cream of shrimp because it was difficult to find. It tasted wonderful as well. I used chopped onions instead of sliced onions and I used Magic Seasoning Blend( blackened red fish magic) by Chef Paul Prudhommes in the spice aisle of the supermarket.  My boyfriend loved it and ate two large plates of it......SO IT HAD TO BE GOOD!

I made this recipe with flounder. The fish seems unnecessary because the topping is so good. It would make a good jambalaya type dish over rice. I used baby salad shrimp. Probably will add some scallops next time with a big BAM! of garlic and forget the fish. Very good!

I did not care for this recipe. You cook the shrimp before you put them in the oven ? The cream of soup was not good.

Fabulous! I made several changes based on other reviews. I used Old Bay Seasoning in combination with garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, white pepper, kosher salt, thyme, and paprika in place of blackened seasoning. I also used dried parsley instead of fresh. Instead of 2 cans of cream of shrimp, I used one can plus a 1/2 can of half-and-half. Lastly, I used frozen shrimp so all I had to do was thaw it and it was ready to go!... just serve over rice. I'll definitely make this again!

Fabulous recipe!  I've made this several times.  I've used tilapia and it was great.  I use less butter and I increase the blackened seasoning. Sometimes I top it with grated parmesan cheese.  Yummy!

Very good.  I made the following changes - used 2 tablespoons butter, and only 1 can of cream of shrimp soup diluted with 1/2 soup can heavy cream. This might explain why I didn't find it as salty as some reviewers have noted.  I've also used tilapia with good results.

Very good over rice.  Two thumbs up for this recipe.  Even if you don't like catfish I think you'd like this recipe.

Very easy dish...  As I was preparing it, my daughter walk through and said "ugh".  As I was cleaning up after the meal, she asked me to make it again.  Go figure.  Served with brown rice, sautéed spinach and garlic toast.  The only change I made was to add a bit of garlic.

My family loved this!  It was my first time trying to cook with catfish and was so pleased with the results!  I used only one can of soup and subsitituted the cream of shrimp soup with cream of celery soup.  I couldn't find the cream of shrimp soup and thought the cream of mushroom soup might overpower the taste of the fish.  I also doubled the shrimp because my family can't ever get enough.  I covered the dish with foil when I baked it because I was worried it might end up too dry.  It came out perfect!  My family raved about it all night!  My husband said he felt like he was dining in New Orleans!  Thanks for the recipe!!

I love this recipe. I've made it twice so far.  Instead of using two cans of soup, I used one can of fat free cream of mushroom, a cup of half and half and a half cup of white wine. I also added cayenne because I love it.  This was served with lemon orzo on the side.

I thought the recipe called for a pound of catfish until i realized i was wrong when it was too late..... i went ahead and did the recipe exactly like it said... i did not think that two cans of cream of shrimp made it too salty at all. It was good but not that good.. maybe next time i would add more cajun seasoning, i would like it to be spicier.

This was really, really good.  I could have ate just the topping minus the fish, but either way it was delicious.

I couldn't find Cream of shrimp soup in our grocery store, so I used Cream of Mushroom. It was very good; probably would have been better with the Cream of Shrimp. Very good topping on the shrimp and so easy to make.

I tried the recipe out, and it didn't thrill me one bit.  It tastes boring and homogenous, just like all recipes that you dump cream of X soup into.

AMAZING! My other 1/2 said it was one of the best dishes he's ever eating EVER!!You could do so many things with this too... 1) More FISH  :O)
I would maybe suggest adding a potato and rice to this casserole, but it is good jsut the way it is. Maybe wrap in a tortilla?

This was really good!  I made it exactly as the recipe states, and will make it again, with a few slight modifications.  While the catfish was tender and cooked through, it lended a little too much fishy taste to the mix.  On the next batch, I might fry the fish and cook the sauce separately, or use tilapia.  The butter was a bit excessive too, but adds to the decadent flavor of this dish.  Served on a bed of dirty rice, it hit the spot in a big way! Great dish, thanks for sharing the recipe.

My boyfriend and his cousin loved this dish. I served it with a salad and greenbeans. The only thing I did differently was use tilapia instead of catfish. I had jumbo shrimp at home so I used those also instead of the small ones. I guess it would have been 6 stars if I would have done the part with the mayo and refrigeration but I was pressed for time so I just seasoned the fish with a creole seasoning and went from there. All the soup in the grocery store was $.99 except the cream of shrimp, it was regular price LOL.

My boyfriend, originally from Mississippi said this tasted GREAT if without the catfish and he picked all the catfish out.  He said this IS a cajun dish.

I on the other hand would like to say that I cooked this recipie as it was prinited with the exeption of one can Cream of Shrimp Soup and one can Cream of Mushroom Soup/Low Sodium.

I did everything to the tea as called for and I am from California so maybe my taste buds are different but...This was disgusting.  It was the FISHIEST tasting dish ever.  It was SALTY.  I LOVE SALT....So if it tastes salty to me, that is a sign of SALTY SUPREME. 

I will never attempt to make this again and gave the 2 stars for my boyfriend, ft they were for myself I'd have given none. 

I ended up eating a TV dinner which wasn't more complimentary but a lot better than Cajun Catfish Supreme!

I enjoyed the taste of this dish, however next time I make it I will change a couple things.  When you transfer the catfish to the dish, drain the remaining butter from the skillet before cooking the remaining ingredients.  I would also pick the pieces of catfish out of the skillet to help keep down the grease.  I would also use low sodium shrimp soup if found.

Wow this dish is soo delicious and easy!  My husband couldn't stop talking about it.  I changed a few things, such as using Old Bay seasoning instead of  the blackened one (didn't have it) and I also had to omit the maynonaise due to time... but it turned out to be out of this world!  Next time I will definitely include the mayo as the cream of shrimp was a bit salty (maybe mayo evens it out?).  Thanks for a great recipe!

Mmm! This was well-received, even with my Cajun fiance. The only changes I made were using Tony's on the fillets, instead of the blackened seasoning, omitting the mushrooms and adding red pepper flakes (it didn't seem like it would be hot enough. As far as the saltiness is concerned, I thought it was reasonable. If you're more sensitive to salt I'd recommend using one can shrimp and one can mushroom soup. Thanks for sharing.

Liked the catfish, didn't like the sauce.  Maybe my shrimp weren't the best but the sauce was very "fishy".  I've never cooked with the Cream of Shrimp soup before, maybe if I'd substituted one or both of those cans for cream of chicken/mushroom/celery I would have enjoyed it more.  Didn't hate it, just didn't love it.

My boyfriend made this for us and I loved it! Everyone but me thought it was just "okay". He is a good cook but too critical of his own cooking. The kids only like breaded fish but I am the one rating it and I am giving it the 5 stars it deserves ;) If you like catfish give this a try!

This recipie was terrific. I too couldn't find the cream of shrimp soup so I made my own. I got a package of white gravy mix, not the Country gravy kind, and I sauteed some shrimp in a tablespoon of butter or two. Then I added green onions and white onions (chopped)and minced some garlic on top and sauteed everything together. What a wonderful aroma! I made the gravy mix, and added the sauteed shrimp mix then let it sit and cool until it was time to add the shrimp sauce to the dish. YUMMY!!!

This was really good.  I ended up adding some green peppers as I had one on hand that I needed to use up.  I also used Tony Chachere's and Old Bay seasoning instead of the blackened seasoning as that is what I had on hand.  I think next time I might add a can of tomatoes to add a nice twist.  Both my kids cleaned their plates which is always a good sign.  I severed this over baked brown rice.  Nice meal!

YUM!! I only gave it 4 stars because I couldnt find the cream of shrimp soup anywhere. I boiled 3 potatoes and mashed them with heavy cream and clam sauce. I used Creole seasoning instead of Cajun-style seasoning. I didnt leave the mayo, seasoning and fish for one hour either. I was hungry! Soooo good! Thank you Lu.

This is a wonderful recipe and so easy! I have used flounder filets and tilapia filets and both times this came out great. You can cut back on the butter when you sauté the mushrooms (if you want) since there is some left in the pan from when you blackened the fish. Thanks for one of the best recipes in a long time. Big on flavor, elegant and definitely company worthy.  Use the cream of shrimp soup- so worth it!

This was delicious!  For a veggie, I steamed asparagus and then quick saute in olive oil and garlic and a splash of balsamic vinegar.  I also had some fresh Italian bread, toasted with olive oil to clean up the plate.  Mmmmmm.  I couldn't find cream of shrimp at my local Kroger, so I used 1.5 cans of cream of mushroom, and a pinch or so of flour to thicken a bit further.  It doesn't specify, but I used portobello mushrooms and it was perfect.  Also, I used Creole seasoning instead of blackened seasoning.  I didn't measure it, but just shook it on until I thought it was good.  Next time I make this, and there will be a next time, I may try to cut the butter in half and use some type of oil to compensate if needed.

I was looking for a catfish recipe and found this one last night.  I went out to purchase the ingredients that I did not have in the house and made it today. I did not use green onion or the blackened seasoning.  I used seafood seasoning instead.  I also used dried parsley and added a can of rotel for some spice.  OMG!!! It was sooooo good. I will make this time and time again.

This was sooooooo good! All the flavors go together so well. The only thing I would suggest is to the right amount of mayo or less, there was kind of a lot of oil sitting in our dish. But still- it was delecious!

this was very good but i expected it to have a little more of a kick to it like cajun food.... i used olive oil to brown my fish and less butter to cook the mushrooms in... next time i may try tilapia and i will use more cajun seasoning....... overall...... great....

This was a super easy recipe. I made it for work and it went over very well. I liked that it stayed moist and flavorful, and the color was appealing. However, next time I will omit the mayo and use half grape seed oil or olive oil rather than the whole stick of butter. Very good over rice.
Thanks!

This is one of my favorite seafood recipes.  Always a big hit.  I usually make it with tilapia.  I made it for my mother in law shortly after my husband and I got married, and it passed with flying colors!

Very good recipe.  I haven't had anything quite like it before.  I actually think that it would havbe been better with a different kind of fish though.  Next time I am going to add other types of seafood too.

I was kind of weary making this... as I didn't have cream of shrimp, so I used cream of chicken! Boy was I pleasantly surprised when I took my first bite! Yum! I also used canned baby shrimps and increased the amount of Cajun seasoning, just cuz I love the stuff. Thanks for a great recipe.

This recipe was really good for fat Tuesday!  My husband also loved it.  I used 1 can of cream of mushroom and 1 can of cream of shrimp.  I also added a green pepper.  Next time I will add cayenne and white pepper.  It wasn't hot enough.  Definitely a keeper.

This is so good!...but we did double the seasonings. I used half the fish and shrimp but kept everything else the same, and used one can of the cream of shrimp soup. I browned the fish in an oven proof skillet, then removed, added the shrooms and things with the added butter...but also minced garlic at the last. Put the fish back in the skillet with the mix and baked. Next time I will not sauté the shrimp before baking....but that is the only thing I would change. The BF just hummed through dinner....and would occasionally say, "this is good...." Thank you so very much for sharing!

This is probably the best thing I have ever made. I had to use cream of mushroom soup because I couldn't find cream of shrimp and only used one can because I misread the recipe but it was delicious. Definitely will be making again. I made Zattarain's black beans and rice with it and broccoli.

This was easy and delicious. I made it with just catfish(no shrimp) and I cut back alot on butter and exchanged mayo for avocado oil. This recipe is simple to alter to your liking. I'll definitely make it again!

Made it for my family tonight.  However, I didn't have time to refrigerate for an hour and it turned out just fine.  I used very little butter because of the catfish and its fat content.  Also, I made the sauce before searing the catfish and not using the same pan because I didn't have the time to refrigerate.  I used 4lbs of catfish, and opted for cilantro instead of parsley.  I also added spinach and garlic.  Once I seared the catfish (which wasn't "seared" enough for me), I broiled it for about 5 min before topping it off with the sauce.  And then in the oven for about 15 more minutes.  Served over rice and it was a HUGE hit!

OMG! Wish there was an option to double the stars, this was AMAZING.  Not terribly difficult to make. Our grocery stores do not carry cream of shrimp soup here, so we substituted 1 can cream of onion soup & 1 can cream of mushroom soup. I will say, we didn't think it was quite spicy enough so we added extra blackened seasoning to the soup mix before pouring over the catfish: this dish gets spicier as it cooks ;)  it turned out we didn't need to add the extra spices, so dont worry if you taste it and it doesn't seem spicy enough-it will be in the end. Such a big hit, AMAZING meal!

I sautéed about a cup of chopped green peppers with the mushrooms. Wow! This was really good. I reduced the number of pans by browning the catfish in a large cast iron pan. As per the recipe, I made the sauce in the same pan. Then I just tossed the fish back in with the sauce and put the whole pan in the oven. I also reduced the amount of butter down to a couple of tablespoons because there was plenty of mayo on the fish, and I increased the amount of Cajun seasoning to about 1 tablespoon. I ended up using 2 lbs of fish and 1 lb of shrimp. There was plenty of sauce for the entire dish.

Made almost exactly to recipe, had a little more of everything except the butter, when it was time to cook the shrooms I still had butter so I didn’t add the other half a stick. I added a little Tony’s to mine afterwards but didn’t use it in the dish as most people probably wouldn’t need it.  Tasted great and I’ll be frying a lot less of my catfish

I had to use the mushroom soup instead of shrimp so I added a little lobster bouillon. I also used Cajun seasoning instead of blackening. Other than that I followed the recipe and it was delicious! Husband thought it was great. Will definitely make again!

This was surprisingly easy! I will agree about it being too salty, I will be fixing that next time around. Other then that, it was good. *Note to self* don't be lazy, pull the tails off the shrimp, and don't forget to cook the rice.

The sauce is amazing.  I bought frozen catfish in a bag at the store.  It had the skin on.  I quickly realized after cooking that not removing the skin was a huge mistake.  You must remove the skin before any cooking of the fish or you will get a bad, slime and nasty fish taste to this wonderful recipe.

I'm going to look for a Cajun seasoning without salt in it because this was way, way to salty and I think it was the Cajun Shake I used. The soup would also be high in sodium but I don't normally find it to be so salty that I can't eat it. We try to eat low sodium so we may be particularly sensitive to the salt but it was bad, we seriously couldn't finish the dish.

I made this last night and my family raved about it! I also substituted tilapia simply because it's what I had on hand.  I also opted to decrease the Cajun seasoning after reading that it might be a bit too salty. I poured this delectable dish over fettucine...Yummy!!!

Very Good! Omitted the butter and used olive oil. I doubled the spices. Did not use shrimp. used 2 cans of low-sodium cream of mushroom. Everything else I follow except I baked fish for 30 min at 425deg. Very moist and tasty. Will use again

This was delicious.  I used 1 can cream mushroom and 1 can cream shrimp and added one can of half and half.  It was not too salty at all.  I also used talapia fish instead of catfish.  It was enjoyed by all!!!  Will definitely make it again.

I thought this recipe was delicious. The sauce really made the dish. I used catfish nuggets. Even my picky child had seconds. Thanks for sharing

After reading a lot of reviews, I ended up using one can of soup and half a can of heavy cream.  Kept everything else as written.  Next time I will use both cans like the recipe states.  Did not think it was salty at all.  Thanks for a good recipe.

My husband and I really enjoyed this.  Based on the previous reviews, I used unsalted butter.  It still was kind of salty.  I think next time I'll use reduced sodium cream of mushroom soup instead of the cream of shrimp.  Only change I made was to double the amount of mushroom because we love mushrooms.  In fact, I think in the future I'd put even more mushrooms in.  Thanks for the recipe!

My husband and I were both disappointed by this. It was fairly salty and lacked something we can't quite place. Like a crunch or some difference in texture. Ended up feeling like it was a waste of money. Was against my better judgement to throw condensed soup on a pound of fresh shrimp and catfish. Should have gone with my gut. On the upside it was relatively easy to make.

This dish was disappointingly lacking flavor considering all the time and prep to cook.  Probably has potential, but will plan for a time when I have all afternoon to prepare, may try bacon as a base for mushrooms and add spinach.

A relatively easy, festive, good dish.  A bit too salty (even with the cream substitution).

What did I do wrong, LU?  Mine was WAY overcooked.  I'll try it again because we have pond raised Catfish at our disposal. 1/18/08  Tried again. Just too dry as given. Could your instructions be wrong?

The only change I made was to use 1 can of Cream of Shrimp soup to an equal amount of whipping cream. It was great served over Zatarain's Garlic & Herb rice mix (without the ground beef)! Thanks!
