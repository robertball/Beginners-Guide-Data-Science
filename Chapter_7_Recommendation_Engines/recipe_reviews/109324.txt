I made this as instructed and thought it was wonderful.  Next time I'll experiment with different flavored puddings.  A note to the reviewer who gave this 1 star because it melted on a hot day.  Are you serious?? The recipe called for it to be frozen for 6 + hours so naturally anything frozen will melt.

This was OK but not that good on a hot day. Everything melted!
