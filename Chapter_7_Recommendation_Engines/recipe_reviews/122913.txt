A very good tasting and tender pastry but I agree with Nancy these puff up! With her review I was ready as they came out of the oven and used a small lid to push down the dough to create a well. I also made 28 tarts out of the dough instead of 18 in hopes that would help, which it did not. Still, this is quite good and I will use it again. Thanks.

Very good, I actually filled them with a cream filling and topped with fresh strawberries. If you are having problems with the tarts puffing up too much, I would try freezing the dough for 10 minutes before baking and halfway through baking, use a fork to gently poke the bottoms if they have puffed up.

I made these larger, probably twice the size/saucer-shaped, to hold fresh fruit, topped with whipped cream.  I also made some as per the recipe for using later on.
If I use this recipe for this purpose again, I'll likely roll the dough out, to get a thinner "pastry".  It came out rather too thick to easily cut with a fork.  One person cut into the pastry, and part of it shot off onto the floor...so some guests were eating the fruit first, then picking the "cookie" up to eat separately.  It's a delicious alternative to regular pastry.

Pretty good, but MAKE SURE you use butter and not margerine... it tastes much better with butter!

WOW!! Love this recipe! I cook for a living I knocked out 72 tarts in under 40 minutes, and they were show stoppers. Intend to use this recipe on a regular basis. I suggest you roll them out nice and thin.

These were indeed very easy to make. I used them to wow my fiance's parents at Thanksgiving. I just made them again recently and instead of putting the pie filling in afterwards, I put it in before baking the tart shells. I had to bake them a little longer, but it made the fruit pie filling I was using taste better. I also sprinkled granulated sugar over the tops instead of powdered sugar. It made a small difference, but enough of a difference to matter to some people.

made these several times and everyone just loves them.  i use all different kinds of fruit filling and all taste great. very easy to make also which is a plus if you are in a rush. just make sure not to make dough balls too big because when they bake it will puff up over pan.

I looooove the cookie part.. not too sweet!  It's a good thing cuz I had some left over buttercream from some cupcakes I made last weekend, so I put a squish of that on the bottom, and topped with cherry pie filling.. so pretty much a cherry cream tart.  SOOOO GOOD!  I made two sizes, mini and regular (reg muffin tins), I used cooking spray and made 1" balls for the small tin, 1 1/2" balls for the big tins.  Then I pressed them into the cups and part way up the sides.. trying to keep them pretty even.  I had NO problems with puffing or anything!  Ty for the simple but yummy recipe! Now I just gotta stop eating them! -_-

Simple to make and has a very nice presentation. I tried a variety of different fruits for the filling and it was very nice. Great for parties or drop-ins.
