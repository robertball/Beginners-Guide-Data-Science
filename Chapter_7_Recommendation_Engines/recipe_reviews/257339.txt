My family absolutely loved this!  They ate 6 a piece.  I had to double  the part I dipped the bread in and it made just enough for one package of sausage.  Also coat your pan before placing them on to be cooked otherwise they stick and you rip the bottoms out of them.

I am so happy I found this! Super simple and fun to make. I followed the directions exactly as written. I did not have cream cheese to make the icing with but I did have Nutella. Kids were in the kitchen looking for more. I did make some with the maple sausage and some with just regular breakfast sausage. I preferred the regular sausage, but again the entire pan was gone!

I made it exactly as listed, with the exception that  I did not add cinnamon sugar to the bottom of the pan. I used an ungreased stoneware sheet  to cook it on. It was really amazing and we could  have eaten a lot more!  Definitely will be added to our meal rotation.
