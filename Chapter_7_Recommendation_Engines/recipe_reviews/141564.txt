I give this 5 stars for being easy and satisfying! I used chorizo instead of the Italian sausage because we love any excuse to use chorizo but I'm sure the mild anise in the Italian would be great too. Thanks Kelley!

Delicious!  My husband really enjoyed it, too, and says it's a 'keeper', so will make it again soon!    I used HOT Italian TURKEY sausage to add some spice and to shave off a few calories and next time, will throw in leftover brown rice to bump up the nutrition.  I also had made-from-scratch garbanzo beans on hand which have a nuttier flavor and are not as soggy (overcooked) as the canned variety.    Thanks for sharing!

This was a very hearty meal, and filled our tummies. It was not great, but not bad either (thus, my 3 star rating). It did help me clean out the pantry of a few canned items that needed to be used up, so that is a plus.

I found the BBQ sauce gave the soup a strange flavor. I might give it another try with a different BBQ sauce.

My daughter is an avid hunter and I have tons of deer sausage in my freezer, hot and mild,  that need to be eaten. (For the record, venison is NOT one of my favorites!) I was looking for a recipe for the purpose of using up some of the HOT sausage when I came across this one. I changed it quite a bit, but it's still very similar and indeed excellent - I had two servings myself and so did my husband!  I used about a pound and a half of "hot" (spicy) deer sausage, the onion, green pepper, tomato soup and water, but to please my picky husband, I left out the garbanzo beans and the rice. Instead, I used a regular size can of plain baked beans, and a 22 oz. can of Bush's Grillin' Beans - Smokehouse Tradition. I also added about a half cup of ketchup since I have tons of bottles I'm trying to get rid of, and also to hopefully cool the spicky sausage down a bit. I did not need to add any barbecue saucee because the Grillin' beans had a Sweet & Smoky sauce already. The results were excellent (and spicy, but not too much so). I found a way to use up some of this deer meat I have. Thank you very much!

This recipe is quick and easy to make. I doubled it for my large family. I skipped the barbeque sauce and added a large clove of garlic, some chili powder, oregano and a little hot pepper flakes. Delish!
