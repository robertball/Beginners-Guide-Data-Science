Great Idea...but try it with Roasted Asparagus instead of steaming! Awesome! I just lightly oil the asparagus with canola or olive oil, salt and pepper then place in 425 degree oven for 8 min, then take out, lower oven to 375 and then place in glass dish, cover with toppings and back for 15 min. YUMMY

Yumm JZG.  I was looking for something a bit different to do with fresh asparagus.  I did this exactly as written since I had everything on hand.  It turned out great (today it was my breakfast, lunch and the rest will be served with dinner, and I will make another batch for Easter dinner).  Oh, and the broiler tip is a must.  Thanks for sharing!  Nelly

I replaced the mayonnaise with cream of mushroom soup since a couple of us dislike it. Was a great way to use up asparagus I needed to use.

thought I would try this, as I usually just saute asparagus.  It turned out good, even my husband liked it, who doesn't like any veggy unless is has cheese sauce. He had seconds.  My 16th month old loved it!  He had two spears.  I added some parsley and paprika and garlic powder to the bread crumbs.  I used Kraft parm, because I didn't have any other.  I would like to use fresh grated parm next time.

I thought this dish was very tasty.  I tried the roasted version as posted by another reviewer.  I lightly oiled the asparagus and added salt and pepper.  Put into a preheated 425 degree oven for 8 mins, the decreased the temp to 375 degrees and added other ingredients, returned to oven and baked another 15 mins.  My only negative comment is that 1 cup of mayo is way too much.  I decreased it to 1/4 cup and I think that was plenty.

This was good but I think I prefer my asparagus simpler, roasted with a little provolone melted on it if anything. I think this recipe is probably pretty good for people who don't like asparagus that much or kids maybe. But for me the "junk" took too much away from the veggie itself, but then again, I am an asparagus lover. I am giving it four stars though because I did enjoy it and so did my husband.

I am not a huge fan of asparagus but felt the need to buy a bunch during the season. I LOVE it now! This was awesome and I almost ate the whole thing before my boyfriend could even taste it! Used this recipe as a base and changed the following: Used light mayo, added a dash of hot sauce and lemon juice along with garlic and onion powder. Stirred it all together while the asparagus steamed, then added along with grated parm. cheese. Used crushed Ritz crackers instead of bread crumbs and sprinkled with shredded moz. cheese before sticking under the broiler for a few minutes - delicious! Going to make it for the holidays this year!

Very, very good.  I used Miracle Whip instead, because that's what I had.  My husband and I really enjoyed it.

This was amazing and neither my boyfriend nor I are huge asparagus fans.  He even asked me to make it again the next day.  I did add bacon and garlic powder to the mayo.  Will definitely make it again!

This came out AWESOME. The smaller asparagus came out crispy, so that was a treat. I did put the asparagus drizzled with olive oil and salt for 20 minutes before doing the recipe, instead of steaming them.

While myself and my daughters liked this recipe. It needs a little more flavor to me. My husband didn't like it because of the mayo but thought the asparagus was very nice and my son just didn't like it at all. I double the recipe with 2 bunches of asparagus and an additional cup of mayo but left the bread crumbs and parmesan the same, then  put it in a 8x8 baking dish. But used seasoned bread crumbs with the parm. Next time I'm using a shallow baking dish because there was a lot of excess mayo that curdled along the sides. So now note to self, if doubling this recipe again I'll use a 1/3 cup more of mayo not a full cup. And add some italian seasoning to the mayo as well. But all in all it was a fairly decent recipe and a worthy dish. Just needs just a little bit of something added.

If looking for a fresh way to cook asparagus, this is definitely not it. I wish I would have read through the introduction. As I was eating it, I kept thinking this taste more like part of a casserole then anything I think of as asparagus. The boiling and then baking made the asparagus reminiscent of something I would get from a can in color and texture. Also, no way this amount of asparagus could be 6 servings unless eating only 3 pieces. I recalculated the 6 servings to 4, which was more realistic, and it went from 343 calories per serving to 514.5 per serving. I wanted to try this, so I just did 1/4 of the topping and calculated it as the 4 servings and it came to 137 calories per serving. Surprisingly, the asparagus was still loaded with a hefty layer of mayo, bread crumbs, and parmesan.

MMMMMMMMMMMMMMM..........this was soo good. I made this for Easter dinner to go with Cola Easter Ham (recipe on this site) and the asparagus went perfect with the ham.  I roasted the asparagus in the oven for about 18 min at 325 on top rack. I don't care for asparagus steamed I prefer it roasted so I simply skipped the steaming step of this recipe. The bread crumbs browned nicely.  Thank You for sharing.

This was delicious. Roasted asparagus with salt, pepper, olive oil and added bacon bits (the kind in pouch, when you roast them they get Krispy) for 8 minutes. Then covered with mayo (not a cup) crushed Ritz crackers mixed with parm cheese. It was very good next time I will cut the asparagus up some before I cover it, just easier to eat

My family loved this recipe! I took advice from other reviews and roasted the asparagus slightly (for 8 minutes) before finishing the recipe. Also cut the asparagus into bite-sized pieces. I definitely recommend this and will be making it again in the future.

This was phenomenal! I put a little salt, pepper, garlic, & olive oil on the asparagus and baked for about 8 min at 425°. Then put 3 heaping big spoons of mayo (prob about 1/3C), sprinkled Swiss cheese, and then put smashed up  Club crackers on top. I forgot to turn it down to 350 at this point...but it didn't matter. Cooked for about 15 min more and it was wonderful!! The asparagus still had a little crunch to it, not at all soggy (finally). My husband gobbled it up & gave me a ??. I told him it was mayo and he couldn't believe it. Even said I was "brave for trying it." But that I should definitely do it again ?? This will be a dish I make for my folks or a dinner party. It's a rich dish, paired well with grilled pork chop & salad.
