This is a very good recipe, but I can't bring myself to give 5 stars to any recipe that tells me to discard garlic (?!).  I made the following changes which I think made it better (my entire picky family loved it).  First of all, I marinated the peeled shrimp WITH the garlic, coursely chopped, and about a tbs. Italian seasoning, some fresh ground pepper, and 1/4 cup olive oil for about 2 hours.   I sauteed the shrimp until barely pink (with the garlic, of course), and I added the parm. cheese with the wine, and simmered for about 5 minutes, then used about 1/2 cup seasoned bread crumbs to thicken.  Came out great, sauce neither too thin nor thick, excellent flavor.

This was very tastie with a few variations that I made -- I sauteed the shrimp in 1/3 cup olive oil and 6 cloves of garlic for 5 minutes while my angel hair pasta was cooking. Then I removed the shrimp and added 1 cup of white wine,a few basil and parsley flakes, and fresh ground pepper. I simmered this for a few minutes and at the end I added a couple teaspoons of ground seasoned croutons (I put them in the blender). I added one teaspoon at a time because it really thickens quick. I poured this mixture over the cooked noodles and sprinkled with more of the ground croutons and parmesan cheese.

I was low on dinner ideas one night and low on ingredients as well. I just happened to have everything required for this so I thought I'd give it a try. It was seriously, AMAZING. I felt so accomplished serving this gourmet dish (which was secretly very easy). I did make some changes: I used a LOT more garlic and left it in rather than pulling it out, used spaghetti rather than angel hair, used chicken broth instead of wine, used Italian bread crumbs, doubled the sauce, and added some lemon juice. (Most of which were changes I had read in previous reviews). Adding the breadcrumbs slowly is a must. Thanks for this fun and simple recipe. I am happy to know I have something impressive to cook for guests.

Great!  Since I used precooked shrimp, it took about 15 minutes to make.  I think next time I won't defrost the shrimp before adding it, so that it won't get as overcooked.

Ok, YUM!! I have never made shrimp scampi before and this was really good! I had to make 2 changes as I did not have bread crumbs on hand (thought I did when I settled on this recipe) or white wine (don't drink it). I did have chicken broth on hand and subbed it for the wine and crushed up caeser croutons to replace the bread crumbs. I had leftovers for breakfast and lunch the following day--couldn't stop eating it!! We adore garlic so I could help myself from using about 6 gloves sliced. Very high in calories but tasty for a once in a while supper! Thanks for such a yummy recipe!

Very good base recipe. Actually could have another half star (4.5). Agree with others about way too much bread crumbs.  Added shallots, extra garlic and sliced portabello mushrooms.  For more flavor, added fresh parsley, a bit of nutmeg and some lemon pepper seasoning.  Still tasted like something was missing, although the guests all loved it - even took home the leftovers!

A very simple recipe for scampi
Not at all enough Garlic and why would you discard it?
Try using 7-10 cloves and mince1/4 cup of onion in the mix with some fresh parsley.

good rating for simplicity. Just a couple additions-KEEP GARLIC (why would you ever discard!). add shallots, chop up some fresh flat leaf parsley and throw it in your pasta (fresh parsley has a great flavor and makes the dish much more presentable), also try 50/50 olive oil to butter mix.

THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO MAKE SHRIMP SCAMPI!  I made the following minor changes:  I increased the garlic to 6 cloves.  I saute the chopped garlic in 1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup olive oil combined.  I leave the garlic in and I saute shrimp.  After adding the wine, I remove the shrimp with a slotted spoon.  I don't use all the breadcrumbs, but whisk them in a bit at a time.  I keep chicken broth on hand and add crumbs and broth until I get the consistency I want.  Then I add the shrimp back in and mix to coat.

Fabulous! I doubled the recipe so I could use the entire box of pasta (I used small wagon wheels because I have small children), but only used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I can't imagine using as much as the recipe called for! I added a cup of frozen green peas  with the shrimp to make it more of a one dish meal. And I kept the garlic in the pan, but I took the shrimp out when I added the bread crumbs. I then mixed it all together again and poured over the pasta. My preschoolers and my husband loved it, and it gave me a great excuse to drink a glass of wine with dinner. :)

Simple and easy to adjust to your tastes. 
I listened to the other commentors and loaded on the garlic. I didn't remove it, but let it simmer. 
I left out the bread crumbs as well, opting to slip my pink shrimp into a nest of whipped parsnip. 
Don't knock it till you've tried it ^_^.
The two flavors complemented each other very well.

The easiest company-worthy dish I've come across. The sauce was the perfect consistency for clinging to the shrimp and lingering on the tongue - and looked glossy like the magazine photos to boot! I gave this 5 stars with slight modifications: left the minced garlic in the dish and added a dash each of Season-All and lemon pepper and a tablespoon of lemon juice. Fabulous! Thanks for the submission.

This recipe was phenomenal.  Absolutely restaurant quality. I put the garlic in the pan with the butter and cooked the shrimp.  I left the garlic in the pan and added the breadcrumb slowly to thicken the sauce--- it was amazing!
Definitely make extra sauce.I also added a few red pepper flakes and fresh parsley.  My husband LOVED IT! THanks for this recipe, I will be making it again soon!

I made some changes, I made it with whole wheat Italian pasta, left the garlic in and sauteed it smart balance spread instead of butter then I added cook shrimp to the melted spread and added white wine and the bread crumbs. I then added the pasta and for the finishing touch I added the juice of half fresh lemon. Delish!!!!!!!!

I made this for guests the first time..they raved about it.  It has become a family favorite.  My husband does not care for the texture of the bread crumbs so I do omit these and thicken instead with flour.  Still delicious!

Thanks

Recipe was decent. It did not take even half the breadcrumbs that it called for. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is missing something. I think it may need some crushed red pepper and some fresh lemon juice. I added fresh basil and oregano and it still wasn’t enough. I will make it again but will tweak it a bit more. I also used the minced garlic from the jar and left it in the sauce. Over all the flavor was good though. It’s a good base recipe that needs your own personal touch. Also from a health stand point I think I would add about half as much butter and add more wine.

This is my wife's absolute favorite dish i've made. We added some "rooster" sauce into the pasta when serving for some extra kick and for a little Thai flavor. Good Stuff.

This recipe had things I needed to use up and avoided the oven on a hot summer day.  I used 1/2 cup butter, but increased substituted chicken broth to 2/3 cup, and kept the shrimp at 1 lb.  I used 4 huge garlic cloves, as well as some red pepper flakes and Italian seasoning.  Definitely do not pour the stated amount of breadcrumbs, just do it slowly until it thickens to a consistency you like.  Sprinkle with parm cheese and parsley before serving.  Excellent fresh and as leftovers.

This is a great recipe. Left the sliced garlic in the butter and made sure it didn't brown. Used linguine and squeezed a little lemon juice over top at the end. Used the fine Italian breadcrumbs and only about 1/4 cup, which was plenty and was a really neat way to thicken the butter sauce.

Naturally I made adjustments, but the base recipe was a great start.
I used 2 sticks of butter, increased the wine to 1/2 cup, and I minced the garlic and didn't remove it.  I added: 1 small onion almost minced, 2 TBS fresh parsley, 1 TBS chives, 1 TSP lemon or lime zest, 1 TBS lemon or lime juice.  I used Fetachini and after it was cooked I drained it and added some butter so it wouldn't stick.
In a large sauce pan, melt butter, saute onion until tender, remove onion.  Add shrimp and garlic and cook until pink.  Stir in white wine and return the onion.  I then added the bread crumbs until the thickness was to my liking.  I served the pasta and shrimp on the side so each person could serve themselves the amount desired.  Delicious!

This dinner was great! I left in the garlic without it I think it would lack taste. When they say slowly put in bread crumbs listen. I didn't use all that it called for it would have been to much.

Nice easy starter recipe.  I read through some of the reviews and made some changes as well.  When melting the butter I added minced garlic (what i had on hand).  As i sautéed the shrimp i added some extra garlic powder (we love garlic) as well as some Italian seasonings and black pepper.  I only used 1/2 cup of bread crumbs.  After it was done i sliced up some sun dried tomatoes and mixed that in.  This was a huge hit!  The husband and 4 year old LOVED it.

Next time around I plan on using Coconut oil to saute the shrimp...hopefully it will turn out just as good!

Was not very good. Make sure and use way less bread crumbs than recommended.

Delicious! No I didnt discard the garlic, and I mixed the cheese with the breadcrumbs.  I also added a tablespoon and a half of lemon juice. Definately will be making this again.

We really enjoyed this. I used italian flavored bread crumbs and a little extra garlic. This really created a great flavor. Best recipe I've found for Scampi.

I do not know why I put the bread crumbs in this!  It ruined the dish!  Shrimp, wine, garlic and butter, and a touch of lemon juice.  All you need!  I don't  know. maybe I thought it would add a "different flavor....." it didn't .  Sorry.

This is very good! My family loved it.I used extra garlic because we like a lot of garlic and kept it in the sauce. I only used a quarter cup of breadcrumbs in mine and also sprinkled fresh parsley on top. I will be making this often.

This was very nice for date night!  The man thought I had worked so hard, but it's easy!  I even cut some time out by using the frozen already peeled and cleaned shrimp.  I did add mushrooms just because I love them and even though it was date night we like extra garlic!  Kept the Italian theme and made a Caesar salad and some garlic bread.

I absolutely love it when I find a great recipe.  From start to finish it took about 15 minutes and it was delicious.  Everyone kept saying this is “wicked good”.  The only suggestion I would make is to not use ¾ cup of bread crumbs.  I like the butter to be more of a sauce so I used less than ¼ cup and it was perfect for us.  Loved it.

I liked this recipe, the more garlic the better.  But next time I make it I will either leave the bread crumbs out or cut them WAY back.  Flavor was great, but it turned out to thick!

I quadrupled the recipe easily and made it for a crowd on Christmas Eve. Everyone loved it and it went together quickly so I could spend time with our guests.  I nixed the cheese this time, and would add more garlic in the future if I was just making it for myself.

Excellent recipe!  I made it and both my wife and I loved it.  I (did what I always do) and modified the recipe slighly.  I added a bit of chicken broth to the wine and sprinkled in a few shakes of Basil and Italian Seasoning...that's it.    I'm a saucy guy, so when I made it again 2 days later, I doubled the wine, chicken broth and bread crumbs...worked out perfectly!  Thanks for the wonderful recipe!!

I didn't use the recipe exactly as written.  More like, used it as a template.  Still my shrimp came out very well.  Instead of white wine I used water and added a few spoonfulls of vinegar.  Served it over fettucine. Was quick and yummy.

This recipe was pretty good.  I used a bit less garlic.  I was not pleased with the taste of the white wine but it worked with the pasta.  The one thing I did different was I put the pasta in a pan and poured this mixture over the pasta and mixed it together.  Then I sprinkled more parmesan cheese over it.  My friends loved it.

Wow, this just came together in a snap and was totally delicious!  I used less butter and a little EVOO.  I loved the addition of the breadcrumb in a saute, just binds the butter/oil/garlic together and gives that classic scampi taste.  I added a little petit diced tomato fresh basil, and mushroom for some added veg.  Terrific, quick, very nice recipe!

This is a great scampi base.  I added a little olive oil (tsp) with the butter, increased garlic to 4 or 5 cloves (I didn not remove from pan) squeezed half a lemon, used only 1 tbsp. of bread crumbs and added some parsley along with the parmesan cheese.  My family loved it.
Thanks MLT!!

WOW!  I've never made shrimp scampi before & now my family wants it every week.  I used about 7 cloves of garlic (left them in) in the butter with a touch of extra virgin olive oil. Then I followed the recipe until after I cooked the shrimp, I added the zest of 1 lemon & juice of 1/2 a lemon.  I only need a very small amount of bread crumbs to thicken the sauce.  I also added about 1/4 cup of fresh parsley to the sauce.
I had some frest asparagus I needed to use so I cleaned & quartered it.  Then I steamed it above the pasta as it cooked.
Once it was crisp tender, I stirred it into the scampi sauce too.  Fantastic!!
Thanks for a super fast & easy recipe.

Thanks Mary, this is a very tasty, and so easy. The entire family went for seconds.  I used less then 1/4 cup of breadcrumbs in mine; and found it to be enough. Many thanks for this recipe! YUM!

Really tasty.  I added chopped parsley to it.  When the pasta was done, I added it right to the shrimp mixture.  Quick, and easy too!

This recipe is a great starting point...sautéed about 1 c of mushrooms, some chopped bell pepper and 2 sliced garlic cloves to the butter.  I added 2 more cloves minced garlic with the shrimp.   I also used red wine, a little less than 1/3 c, and added chicken broth to make 1/3 c.

Served over fettuccine, this was fabulous!  Kids asked e to make it tomorrow too.  It's a keeper for sure.

This was a great starter recipe.  I added the following to make this over the top:  I marinated the shrimp in about 7 cloves of minced garlic and 1 packet of italian seasoning for the afternoon.  After sauteing the onion and shrimp I removed.  I then added the wine (2/3 cup) , (1/4 cup) breadcrumbs and lemon 1/2 squeezed until blended. Then  I added 1/2 cup sun dried tomatoes,   1/2 cup artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup parm and cooked until bubbly.  Last was the  reserved onion and shrimp.   Mixed in the ala dente pasta.  Incredible is an understatement!

Liked this recipe, simple and easy.  Had pasta going while I cooked scampi, and added at last minute. Also after looking at other recipes decided to throw in some red pepper flakes while the garlic and shrimp were being sauted. Also right before the bread crumbs I did also throw in some sliced green onion. Husband loved it, tasty with a little kick!

Quick, easy and delicious!  Had shrimp but not much else and came across this recipe.  I only had penne pasta and it was great with it.  I left the garlic in and the sauce smelled and tasted great!

I think this turned out ok, but didn't care for the bread crumbs.  I found that the bread crumbs soaked up all of the garlic butter sauce, which left nothing to coat the noodles.  I think if I make it a next time, I will omit the bread crumbs.

My favorite way to cook shrimp.  I followed the recipe pretty exact.  Added a dash of lemon juice.  Add the bread crumbs super slow because it thickens very quickly.

5 stars because super simple and easy to modify!

Changes I made:
used frozen cooked shrimp partially thawed,
sub 2/3 cup chicken broth instead of wine,
add 1/2 cup canned petit diced tomatoes,
keep garlic in sauce, sub italian bread crumbs instead of plain, add way more fresh garlic, and
add dash of lemon pepper

Easy dinner on the table in less than 30 minutes!  Will make again and again and again and again...

Ohhh heavenly! I am one that usually alters recipes without hesitation, and must admit that after reading through this recipe, I had no desire to change anything! I prepared it as directed, and probably only used about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I just sprinkled & stirred, sprinkled & stirred until the sauce remained thin enough to coat the pasta well. I used "italian style" bread crumbs and vermicelli, only because that was what I had ... still PERFECT!

Wow! This was my first time cooking with wine and I thought I had ruined the dish after I put the wine in. The smell was just not pleasant. So, I took a shrimp to try it before I served it and WOW OH WOW! It was delicious! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! The entire meal was devoured!! This is a keeper!!

This Shrimp Scampi is awesome!! I followed some of the other suggestions, like marinating the prawns/shrimp for 2 hrs, with olive oil, Italian seasoning, lots of garlic, fresh ground pepper & garlic seasoning......i also used ox chicken broth instead of the wine.  Thanks so much for sharing your recipe :)

Extremely easy to prepare, quick and tasty.  I followed the recipe exactly and will do so again.  I am a novice when it comes to cooking with wine and could not find 'white wine' in the wine isle therefore used chardonnay.  I am not sure if that was the right choice, however, I look forward to the next time to try another 'white wine'!

Breadcrumbs (only used 1/4 cup) turned it thick and goopy!   Probably would be okay without breadcrumbs.

Made this for my son's 15th birthday and it was delicious! Only recommendation would be to make a little more sauce if you like your pasta well coated. I also added a bit of fresh parsley at the end for some color.

I made this dish for our New Year's dinner, it was wonderful. It was the second time I have made it. The first time I followed the recipe exactly. Last night I tried champagne instead of white wine instead. It turned out excellent. This meal is quite easy to make and a good one to impress your friends and family.

This was SO good!!! I didn't discard the garlic and added some sliced cremini mushrooms after the shrimp was cooked, but before adding the wine. I also threw in some fresh basil for color. I served it with steamed broccoli and garlic bread. Even my husband who shys away from anything that is not a red sauce said this was "awesome".

We were not thrilled with this recipe; too much wine and didn’t like the breadcrumbs mixed in.  Will stick with my butter, minced garlic (and for goodness sake--leave the garlic in), 2 tablespoons of wine, and a sprinkling of Blackening seasoning.

I thought this was a great base recipe.  I took the advice of others and used olive oil instead of butter and left the garlic in the sauce.  I also added from fresh garden veggies - peppers (green and orange), zucchini, tomatoe, basil, and spinach.  It was great.  I will definitely use this recipe again.

Very yummy.  I halved the butter and substituted olive oil instead and it was delicious.  I also added some pea pods and fresh chopped tomatoes.

This was amazingly good.  The only change I made was to leave the garlic in (finely minced, not sliced) and to serve the shrimp without pasta.  I was skeptical about the bread crumbs, but it wasn't the least bit "bready".  The entire family loved this recipe.

Very good recipe!  As my 9-year-old daughter said "This scampi is FABULOUS!"  I did add about 1/4 teaspoon of salt while the shrimp was cooking, but I think it would have been fine without it.  I served it over Garlic and Olive Oil flavored Pasta Roni instead of plain angel hair, because that was what I had on hand.

This recipe was delicious! I made it with whole wheat pasta to make it a little healthier. I will definately make this again!

This was by far the best shrimp scampi I've ever had.  My husband called it the best shrimp he's ever had.  I think the removal of the garlic is key - there's no way it can get burned or bitter.  Also, the bread crumbs are an important vehicle for the butter.  I served it with lemon wedges, which was great.

My entire family loved this dish!  It was VERY easy and tasty.  I did take two bits of advice from the many reviews and used less than half of the bread crumbs.  Also, I did not throw out the garlic.  For those who like their food a little spicier, red pepper flakes would be excellent.  Will definitely keep this one!

This is a good basic scampi recipe. I did add a dash of lemon juice to mine. It made a big flavor difference.

I wasn't sure what to make for dinner and only had frozen shrimp in the freezer, so I was looking for something simple to do with it. This was a delicious meal that was very easy and quick to prepare! I did make a few slight adjustments. As with some of the other reviewers, I left the garlic in and actually used 4 cloves, minced. (We love garlic in this house!) I also removed the shrimp once they were cooked so they didn't get overdone and retuned them to the pan once the sauce had thickened. In terms of the sauce, I really just eyeballed the amount of parmesan and breadcrumbs I used, but I definitely used more parmesan than breadcrumbs. While the sauce was excellent on its own, I added pepper and hot pepper flakes to my plate to kick the flavour up a bit. This recipe is a definite keeper. I will be making this again!

This recipe was delicious.  I have never made shrimp scampi before and this was very easy.  I used slightly less bread crumbs than the recipe called for and still came out with a really nice consistency with the butter and wine used to sautee the shrimp.  I also made mine with boiled spinach as I can not eat pasta.  It was a nice combination with the shrimp and there was enough sauce left in the pan after removing the shrimp to add on the spinach.

This was totally awesome for very little effort. I used whole wheat pasta and I used 1 tbsp butter and 1 tbsp olive oil. I also used 1/2 parmesan cheese and 1/2 Italian seasoned bread crumbs to thicken the sauce (as suggested below) and it worked great. I was out of white, so I used Marsala wine and it was delicious. We halved the recipe as it was just 2 of us, but I could have eaten twice as much, it was so good.  I've made scampi before, but from now on I will make it just like this!

I love to make this for my family on nights that I don't have much time. I follow this recipe as close as I can, I do agree that is too heavy on the bread crumbs. I use my own homemade whole wheat bread crumbs (I just start adding and  stirring until it looks right) and probably more cheese than needed but only because we really love parmesean cheese. One word of advice is to cut the garlic into big pieces so that it is easy to get out of the oil, it also is faster. Thanks for the recipe!!!!

I used the following alterations:

1/3 cup olive oil
1/4 cup butter
1 head of garlic
3/4 of a pint of grape tomatoes, cut in half
1 pound shrimp 
1/2 to 3/4 cup wine
1/3 cup seasoned bread crumbs
1/4 cup shredded parmesan cheese

I left the garlic in and cooked the tomatoes in with the garlic. Next time I'll add some sliced mushrooms.

I minced my garlic and left it in the butter and MAN did it smell awesome.  I didn't use many bread crumbs at all, as the garlic thickened the sauce a bit.  But I think I will double the sauce ingredients for the hubby next time.  I don't eat meat, but I made this for my husband and he LOVED it.  He said he could eat this about once a week. hehe  He is normally not a huge seafood fan, but this is a new favorite.

This was very tasty. I kept in the garlic (and used more of it), added some green onions, pepper, basil and parsley. It was certainly tasty, but a bit greasy (that is a LOT of butter). I will definitely make it again, but probably cute back on the butter and substitute olive oil for part of it. Thanks for sharing!

This was a quick and easy recipe.  I used 1/2 the butter and added olive oil in its place.  I love garlic so I did not throw it out after sauteeing it in the butter/olive oil.  I also added in some fresh cauliflower which was a very nice addition.

I have been cooking with Ghee lately for recipes that require butter.  It takes about half the amount and saves afew of the calories.  Added extra garlic and didn't discard it.  Really great and easy recipe!  Will definatly make it again.

A wonderful recipe. I made this for my wife and mother-in-law. They loved it and so did I. I was very pleased with the results. I made enough for four, I should have made it for six. Nothing was left over.
I took the advise of other raters and used 1/4 cup breadcrumbs, (Italian style), and added a total of six cloves of garlic, (We are garlic lovers).
I will be making this recipe often. My wife told me so.
Thanks Mary Lynn.

Very tasty!  I'm glad I read the instructions about adding the bread crumbs a little at a time.  If I had added 3/4 cup, I would have had glue!  Very good!  I will definately make again.

One of my fav shrimp recipes.  I also add a slurp of olive oil to the butter to prevent burning.  This also allows me to pour it over the pasta for a flavorful sauce.

This could be a good beginning for Shrimp Scampi, but for us it didn't make it even with a couple of changes. I doubled the sauce which should really have no effect on the finished dish. Really, shrimp scampi is a garlic dish - so who would discard the garlic!!! Since I doubled the sauce, I minced about 10 medium to small cloves of garlic and sautéed them in the melted butter. I gradually added about 3/4 of the bread crumbs called for in the recipe, and it was still way too much.  The sauce was almost pasty. I added some water to thin it some, which helped, but still way too thick.  Even discounting the thick sauce, there was something missing.  If I tried this again, I would add minced onion, and possibly more seasoning, but I don't know what at this point. I suppose this could be a good start for Shrimp Scampi, but I think I will continue my research for my next attempt at it. There is a good possibility that this recipe would be very good with much less bread crumbs. I don't fault the cook for this as it was mentioned that the bread crumbs were used only for thickening and should be added gradually. In doing so, you have to wait for a bit until the bread crumbs have time to absorb the liquid. It's possible that I didn't wait long enough.

This was simple and delcious! Other than not having garlic scapes and having to use a garlic clove instead, I followed it to a "T" and it was scrumptious. A nice, healthy light dish.

KEEP. THE. GARLIC. OMG. I followed most people's advice: Double the sauce, but do half butter and half olive oil.  No breadcrumbs either.  Liked the idea of adding parsley and shallots too!!!  Super yummy!

Well, while making this recipe I looked at it and said to myself, "wow this is an easy recipe", but it did not turn out that way.  Like the others taking out the garlic was not easy chore maybe if I would have kept them in bigger pieces but it took awhile to get the garlic out of the skillet.  I know the recipe said to use the bread crumbs as a thicken ingredient, but the recipe was dry before even adding the bread crumbs I had to keep adding pasta water I don't think 1/3 cup of wine is enough liquid.

I agree with ERMB. Discarding the garlic is insane! I liked this recipe a lot on the other hand. I used 4 garlic cloves and did not discard it. I also added some fresh parsley, cilantro, and lime. I thought this recipe was delicious with changes.

Needs more garlic.  I did not discard mine.  I minched 4 cloves rather than slicing 2 and it was still pretty weak for the garlic.  I will use closer to 6-8 next time.  Overall crowd pleaser

Easy and delicious recipe!  I left the garlic in rather than take it out.  Used Italian seasoned bread crumbs. Served for company.  Wonderful!

Very good recipe, quick and easy.  Love shrimp scampi and this was yummy and my husband actually liked it and said it was, "very good"!  High praise from a man that almost NEVER says one word about what I put down in front of him whether excellent or not.  So...I will definitely make this again.

Loved this recipe!  I did add a couple of changes though.  I added a generous sprinkling of lemon pepper, parsley flakes and instead of butter I used olive oil.  After you boil your pasta, you can add the water from the pasta instead of bread crumbs.  I probably used about a cup of pasta water.

This recipe was very delicious. We neede only about 1/4 a cup of bread crumbs to thicken it up. We also added fresh squeezed lemon. My picky daughter loved it.

When i made the dish the sauce turned to thick, i would not use as many breadcrumbs or even use them at all, but besides that it was okay not very garlicy though i will skip the breadcrumbs and keep the garlic in.

This needs much more garlic than what's called for.  We loved it with these changes: I used 1/4 cup each of butter & EVOO, 8 teaspoons of minced garlic (didn't remove it), and only used about 2 heaping teaspoons of the bread crumbs.  Served it over spinach pasta.  Yummy!

Excellent recipe.  I read some of the other reviews so decided to modify as some suggested.  I used 1 lb. of shrimp instead of  1 1/2 lbs., added 1/3 cup fresh lemon juice and 1 tablespoon fresh chopped parsley and served over yellow rice.  Awesome and will definitely do again.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this recipe! I made a few alterations; i left in the garlic, added red pepper flakes and portabella mushrooms. I also bought pre-cooked shrimp which cut the cooking time down. When the pasta and sauce were done I added it all into on large pot and let the pasta soak up the sauce which made it very delish! I will definately keep this recipe on hand for a quick dinner.

I had some cooked shrimp I needed to use.  Had all the ingredients so tried this and it was excellent.  I am not much of a cook but my husband was impressed.  I left the garlic in and think next time I may add a little lemon juice.  It was very good!

Delicious! Light and fresh- a great quick summer meal! I used I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and chicken broth (I had no open wine), and also added some chopped vidalia onion and zucchini to the garlic, and it came out great!

This turned out realllyyy well. My only changes were to double the sauce, keep in the garlic, and only use about a half cup of bread crumbs. Definitely be sure to add the bread crumbs in slowly, as the sauce thickens pretty very quickly otherwise.

This is really really easy to make and good.  I did take the shrimp(used frozen) and I marinated in Italian dressing for an hour in the fridge with 1 tbsp of olive oil and 2 minced garlic cloves.  Then I sauteed the shrimp with the marinade and 1 tbsp of butter, added the white wine, then the bread crumbs.  Yummy

GREAT recipe! I did leave the minced garlic in the sautee pan with the shrimp though. The white wine really makes it. I only had to use about 1/4 cup breadcrumbs to get a good thickness. And I added salt and pepper on the shrimp. I also added chopped parsley. We loved it!

Very good.  Suggest using less bread crumbs, keep garlic, use safflower oil instead of butter and add sundried tomatoes.  We accidently ate it all!

This was a simple and pretty appetizing dish. I was out of garlic cloves so I substituted garlic powder. Can't wait to try it again with garlic cloves and maybe change it to 5 stars.

This was a decent recipe and my family enjoyed it, with the exceptiong of the picky 4 year old who didn't want to try the shrimp.  I used twice as much garlic as inidcated and it worked out well.  I had marinated the shrimp in lemon juice and still found the recipe to lacking in the acid department.  Next time, I will add lemon juice while I am adding the bread crumbs.   It would be a good "company" dish if served with a nice salad or you added veggies to the scampi and some good crusty garlic bread.

Very good recipe!  I made a few modifications to the recipe.  I added some fresh squeezed lemon juice, added about a quarter of a cup of olive oil to the butter ( I know, high fat but soo good), reduced the wine to 1/4 cup, and used A LOT more garlic that I of course kept in the sauce...The more the better in my house!  I also added much less of the bread crumbs, probably used 1/4 cup instead.  Seasoned with salt and pepper, and served over linguini. Great!  High fat, so it's an occasional meal, but very good!

This was really a great base recipe. I combined olive oil and butter,and used more garlic as others stated and a bit more white wine and fresh parsley and basil. I served mine over fettuccini. It tasted like a special dinner. Great to just keep some frozen shrimp on hand so you can whip this up anytime.

Excellent! The bread crumbs really thickened this nicely and really helped the sauce stick to the pasta! I didn't have whole garlic, so I slowly used some minced garlic and added a little of parsley. Outstanding!

I am a newlywed and not a great cook but this recipe was easy and tasty. I made some minor changes though...I minced the garlic and kept it in and added fresh parsley and freshly squeezed lemon juice and I used freshly shredded parmesan instead. My husband was impressed! Thank you for sharing such a great recipe!

A very good recipe.  I used Italian seasoned bread crumbs and added black pepper.  I recommend adding a little olive oil to the noodles to keep the dish from being too dry.

During Lent we are always looking for tasty seafood recipes and we found one here!  My husband prepared this on Friday and the only changes he made to the recipe was to substitute 1/2 cup Smart Balance(stick form) for the butter and added a little more garlic.  It was very rich and delicious.  Would definitely recommend this recipe!

This was suprisingly good.  I doubled the sauce, used chicken broth instead of wine, and only used about 1/4c of the bread crumbs. Not the healthiest dinner because of the butter, but I will definitely make this again. YUM!

I did not have any white wine or chix stock.  I did use 6 garlic cloves and diced a tomato and sauted them before adding the shrimp. The family raved about this recipe.  Definitely will prepare again.

Really good flavor.  I used 6 cloves of garlic instead because we REALLY like garlic! I used fresh ground bread crumbs from a day old loaf of french bread and did not need quite as much. This is a really good recipe!

This was really good, and very easy to prepare.  I also used chicken stock instead of wine.  I also added some parsley to the chopped garlic, as well as sun dried tomatoes.  I will use this recipie again.  It tasted restaurant good!  TRY IT!!

Really very good. Wife went nuts over it.  Am getting ready to fix for my vegetarian daughter.  Made according to recipe.  Only comments are be careful to not over cook Angel Hair pasta and be real careful adding the bread crumbs - give them some time to thicken before adding more.  Thanks for a tasty & easy recipe.

I used 1/4 cup butter and about 2 TBLS of olive oil and sauteed minced garlic. I then added frozen asparagus. I also added diced tomatoes and then the precooked shrimp went in the pan!It didn't take long to heat through. Don't overcook. Lemon juice squeezed over the top made it just perfect! I loved the recipe for a basic scampi and it handles additions nicely. Thank you for a great recipe that my family really enjoyed! We felt we had been to a restaurant to eat! Very delicious and quick!

I'm not a huge shrimp fan, yet this was pretty tasty.  Keep the garlic though!  I minced up the garlic and left it in.  I also like to add a little bit of freshly squeezed lemon if I have any lemons around.  Any type of lemon seasoning works well though also.  I have used "lemon & herb" to give it a more interesting flavor.  Overall the recipe is a keeper!  The white wine flavor is delicious in it.

Wow, this was great!  I added mushrooms with the garlic and sauteed them so they soaked up the butter and wine.  I also used parmesan cheese to thicken rather than the bread crumbs, and it was absolutely delicious!  This is a keeper!

This was really good and tastes even better the next day.  We added more shrimp, and used about 6 cloves of garlic.  The garlic, however, seemed to lose some of its flavor in the cooking process.  Will probably try adding more next time, and maybe even some garlic powder.  Very tasty though!

This recipe would only be good with major tweaking.  It was very bland and way too rich.  What a disapointment.  It needed more garlic and some heat (red pepper flake?)  I don't think it's fair to rate a recipe favorably that you have completely remade.

I love this recipe!  It was a big hit during my last dinner party!  I made a few changes to the original recipe.  While the butter and garlic were simmering, I chopped up some mushrooms and escargots, and instead of white wine I used vodka (it gave it some extra kick). OMG IT WAS SOOO GOOD!

VERY tasty recipe!!  I made it with a little less than 1/2c. butter.  I used equal parts parm. cheese and plain breadcrumbs to slowly thicken it.  Then at the very end tossed in fresh chopped basil.  Yum!

This was very good.  Followed the directions for the most part but I added extra wine, fresh basil and a little bit of red pepper flakes for a little kick.  I did not measure anything out as I made extra sauce and served it with a crusty bread for soaking the sauce up.  Make sure to just use a litte bit of bread crumbs at a time as it depends how thick you want the sauce.

Awesome. I used chopped garlic from the jars you get in the produce section.  I didn't remove it because we all like garlic. I took some advice and doubled the sauce and put the bread crumbs in slowly until I was happy with the consistency. I really liked how the bread crumbs thickened up the sauce.  That way it actually clung to the pasta. Great recipe. Will make again.

This dish is awesome! I used Italian bread crumbs and did not need the amount listed- I used 1/2 cup and that was too much.  I also did not have white wine, so just used chicken broth with some lemon juice in its place.  It was delicious- thanks!

This was good with some flavor additions.  I added a chopped shallot, dried basil and oregano, some fresh chives and salt and pepper.  Also I agree, add the bread crumbs very gradually...you don't need much!  I also added more garlic, but don't tell my husband!

This dish was excellent and simple!  For future cooks, I used about 4 cloves of minced garlic and I did not discard it.  I also used about 4-5 heaping teaspoons of bread crumbs to thicken and that was it.  I will be making this many, many more times!!  My boyfriend wants me to make this for his parents!!

This was wonderful.  I added more garlic, minced, and left it in.  Loved cooking with the wine, which gave it a delicious flavor. Huge hit with my family.  Definitely a keeper!

Great recipe! I used all the ingredients but had to improvise for the white wine. I combined apple juice with white wine vinegar. I also used parmesan breadcrumbs since that’s all I had. I did add far less breadcrumbs than the recipe called for. You can gauge this while you’re adding the crumbs. Thank you for sharing such a delicious recipe. My husband and I loved it!

I used crushed garlic in olive oil . I also used much less breadcrumbs, probably between a quarter to a half cup. It had great flavor, my husband and I really enjoyed it. And it was such an easy recipe.

Very good recipe. I worried about discarding the garlic too but I decided to smash 4 garlic cloves and cook them in the butter until they started to get brown and removed them to a paper towel. I also cooked some red pepper flakes with the garlic. When I added the wine to the shrimp I also added some lemon juice. I didn’t use very much bread crumbs because I didn’t want it too think. I skipped the cheese altogether because I’m not a fan of cheese with shrimp. It was very garlicky and delicious. I toasted baguette slices and used the smashed garlic to rub on them. My family loved it!

Wow, was that good.

I concur with the others. More garlic, 10 cloves, cut back on the bread crumbs. This needs to be added to create the consistency you like. I used 1/4 cup. Next time I would use a little less. Add a dusting of kosher salt, black pepper and a little crushed red pepper.

For something different, I also added 4 stalks of bias cut asparagus, sauteed while cooking shrimp.

This is one of my all-time quick favorites.

I added some jarred artichoke hearts chopped up and used thin spaghetti instead of angel hair pasta. I also added some dried chives. Basil and/or oregano would have worked as well, I think. The butter sauce was soaked up quickly (probably by the extra seasonings and veg), so next time I will use a little less bread crumb and a little more butter because I like a saucier dish. I think sauteing some diced white onion with the garlic or some sliced green onion later would add some additional interest as well. We served with garlic bread and even my son, who isn't big on seafood, liked it.

Great basis recipe.  Used 4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil and a lot less bread crumbs.  Watch you don't over cook that pasta.  So delicious!  Just bought extra special scrimp for next time.

I thought the sauce needed something.  Maybe red pepper flakes?  .But it all came together like a charm in just a few minutes.

Dish was really easy to prepare.  One problem though and that was that it only took a couple minutes to prepare.  WE used precooked shrimp and that cut down on the time.  My wife came hoe to the smell of a touch of garlic that was a pleasant surprise, along with dinner being ready when she walked in.

I used this recipe as written and the gang LOVED it!!  It was light and delicious, and the plentiful, fresh Gulf shrimp made it "pop!"  This will be my very simple, "go-to" shrimp scampi recipe!!

Made this and the family loved it.  I made just a few minor tweaks- I added some lemon zest, cracked red peppers and left the garlic.  I did lightly season the shrimp for about an hour with some  pepper, a little salt and garlic powder. 

I did not have angel hair pasta so I used bow tie pasta.

This recipe is very easy to make.

One of the best scampi recipes I have ever made.  I added a bit more garlic because we LOVE garlic.  My mom always said we would probably put garlic in banana cream pie--she was not a fan.

Way better if you use reserved pasta water  for thickening and sprinkle toasted, buttered breadcrumbs on top. Otherwise a decent recipe. Don’t toss  the garlic, though!

I have been making this for years and we love it.  I leave the garlic in the sauce because we really like garlic, but I don't use the bread crumbs.  They really aren't necessary.  I usually serve the scampi over white rice rather than pasta, but it is good either way.

I followed another reviewer’s suggestion and marinated the shrimp in the fresh garlic with a couple swigs of olive oil for about an hour before.  Other than that, I made as written and it was a big hit with my hubby and teen boys. I will make more sauce next time and perhaps try with angel hair. Served with Jimmbo’s Garlic Knots from this site along with a salad. Will definitely add this recipe to the repertoire!

I followed another suggestion and marinated the shrimp in the garlic and olive oil while waiting for the water to boil for the pasta. It turned out incredible. I believe that the big thing that I was missing was the bread crumbs.

This is an excellent recipe.  I made the following changes:  1) used 3/4 C butter; 2) used 4 garlic cloves; 3) used 2/3 C wine; 4) added 1/2 C swiss chard, torn into small pieces, and mixed in the hot mixture just until wilted. It gave it a creamier consistency and added color.

I think it needed lemon. I ended up adding it but without that the dish was only so so. I thought the bread crumbs were an interesting twist.

Turned out great for the family.  I agree a little more garlic makes it quite good.  A hit for all!

Made this for my family and they loved it, I changed the recipe a little 1 used chicken broth in place of wine and I mixed a 1/2 teaspoon of corn starch into the chicken both instead of using bread crumbs. I used Penne pasta and double the cheese.

All time favorite shrimp recipe - quick but restaurant quality / company quality meal - just make sure you don't overcook the shrimp - cook only until they are opaque.  Better undercooked than over cooked.  Love it!

Made a few of the recommended changes (kept the garlic and added extra and added cheese while cooking). Absolutely delicious and so easy.

I gave this 5 stars only because I changed it up a bit , I left some of the garlic in there , how could u get rid of garlic really lol.  Plus as to not dry the shrimp out I let the sauce cook first then added the shrimp to it as it only takes a few seconds to cook thru then I added the bread crumbs to thicken the sauce while it finished cooking .  That's what I would recommend works best for a simple delish 5 star recipe !!

We loved it! We had minced garlic so used that and of course did not remove garlic. Did not thicken with bread crumbs. Instead just put shredded Parmesan into sauce. We used 1 pound shrimp and 1/2 pound of bay scallops. The only other thing we did was make couscous instead. Everything was delicious. I probably would double the sauce ingredients to stretch in the future.

By preparing the garlic in the recipe this way, not much flavor is added.  My suggestion would be to crush the garlic (one large clove should be enough) and cook it in the sauce.  I also think adding a splash of lemon juice to give the recipe a bit of tartness would help.  I also added some capers, which enhanced the flavor.  My family loved it prepared this way.

Good simple recipe that the whole family loved. Like others, I kept the garlic in. I also used Italian Breadcrumbs, but I might cut back a little on  that next time. Otherwise this was really good and will be added into our rotation.

I made this for lunch today it was awesome. I used 3 cloves garlic chopped coarsely, did not discard, only used 2/3 c bread crumbs. Will make this again but will use more wine and not thicken quite as much. I like some of the sauce on my pasta and this way there is no sauce

Very tasty! I used more wine than called for and only about 1/2 cup of bread crumbs. I used minced garlic from the jar and didn't discard it. Tasted great that way. Easy to make and very quick. Better than most restaurants!

I made a high-fiber, alcohol-free version by using Oat Bran instead of bread crumbs, and white vinegar diluted in water instead of white wine (I added two teaspoons white vinegar to one cup of water, then took out what I needed).  I also kept the garlic in by using a garlic press.  Finally, I added a little Old Bay seasoning and a little Italian seasoning.  This was my first time cooking shrimp and I'm very happy with the way it came out.

This is one of my favorite recipes to make! It's quick and easy! The only thing I changed was I obviously left in the garlic, probably added more than it called for and added cherry tomatoes for a little more flavor and color. Just cut them in half and threw them into the cooked shrimp to simmer with the sauce for a few minutes. I also leave out the bread crumbs because I like a lighter sauce, and I added a dash of lemon juice. Delicious!

This is very delicious! I'm usually not a big fan of shrimp scampi. I find it doesn't really have much flavor. This is the first recipe that has proven me wrong. I will definitely keep this one. I had left over penne so i mixed that in instead of the angel hair and i didn't have fresh garlic so i used minced and left it in. Really deserves five stars!! Thank you1

Good, used less bread crumbs (think I will use even less next time) I also added more garlic and lemon juice. Will make again, next time make more sauce for the noodles. Very Good though.

Wonderful! I used chicken broth in addition to the white wine as I didn't have 1/3 cup of wine. Also, didn't have bread crumbs so I crushed crackers. Added crushed red pepper for a little zip. Definitely will make again!

Tweaked this a bit--Added fresh parsley, juice of half a lemon, and a couple sliced shallots.  Also used 3/4 cup butter, about 1/2 cup wine, and about 1/2 cup bread crumbs. I used a TON of mashed garlic (about 8 large cloves) and added the extra white wine when I saw that the bread crumbs had thickened the sauce to somewhat of an unsightly consistency!  The person who shared this meal with me thought it was "so delicious."  I wouldn't go that far--but then, I knew what was in it and probably felt like it just wasn't worth all those calories for something just above "decent."  I'd probably make this again in the event I don't have many ingredients at home, which is why I tried out this recipe in the first place last night.  I would think most people would enjoy it.  (Next time I will try to substitute some chicken broth for some of the butter I used the first time.)

Beautiful dish. My dear husband came back for seconds. My only addition was a little bit of sriracha sauce as we love spicy food. Will make again.

Fabulous. I made this for my grandma (yes, my grandma) and changed the portions to one serving. Guess what? She fell in love with it. I followed the recipe exactly and added the bread crumbs as seemed appropriate. I had jumbo shrimp on hand and used those instead (four since they were huge) and did not serve the scampi with the garlic as I didn't cook it entirely through. And being picky as she is, she doesn't like the "firmness" of just-cooked garlic.  The recipe stayed true to its prep and cook time, even for a novice like me. I do plan on making this again.

This is a great "what's for dinner??" meal.  I used Sam's frozen uncooked shrimp and followed a few of the other suggestions by marinating the shrimp in olive oil, black pepper and italian seasoning.  I also used 1/4 cup italian bread crumbs.  Wonderful!!

I made some suggested changes.  I didn't have any white wine so I used water and I used Italian bread crumbs.  Lastly I added parmesan cheese to the mix.  Turned out great.   :)

This was very good.  I did leave in the garlic and must say that it didn't adversely effect the dish.  Other than that and adding some Parmesan cheese into the sauce (and on top) I followed the recipe exactly.  Everyone loved it so I will be making it again!

I was skeptical that this recipe would be as good as it was since it's so simple, but it was awesome. The only modification I made was to add more butter and parsley. Served with sugar snap peas and the rest of the chardonnay.

This is the best shrimp scampi recipe I have found yet. Simple, quick, and delicious. I happened to have cooked shrimp and it didn't seem to matter, it just cut down the cooking time.  My 13 yr. old loved it and he is picky!

Great recipe --- a few changes: for more sauce, I used 1 stick of butter and 1/2 a cup of white wine. And being the garlic lover I am --- I minced 5 or 6 cloves of garlic and kept it in the sauce. Very easy and very delicious!

We really enjoyed the scampi flavour, however, we found the pasta to be much too try for our taste. We would certainly add more wine and olive oil if we made this again.

I used 6 cloves of garlic and didn't discard it since we love garlic.  We didn't have angel hair pasta so I served it with brown rice.  It's a keeper recipe and I will definitely make it again.

This was really yummy!  We loved it and will make again.  I used 8 garlic cloves and cook slowly on the butter and olive oil (I used half/half). I only had cooked shrimp and it was fine.  I used the Italian Seasoning bread crumbs and added slowly, no need for the whole amount. I added parsley and lemon garlic seasoning.  Leftovers are ready for tomorrow.  Thanks!

Very good scampi recipe.  I've made scampi before but not very well.  What I did was add alot of garlic in the butter... sauteed and kept the garlic in.  I used at least 6 cloves.  Sauteed the shrimp added the white wine and then added some chicken broth because we like our pasta a little bit soupier as opposed to dry.  Added a little less bread crumbs and also added some lemon juice. Used spaghetti because I didn't have any angel hair.  Also added red pepper seeds to my own individual plate b/c I like it a little bit spicy.  The key is to cook the shrimp for only a few minutes.  The longer you cook it the toughter it gets.  You can even under cook it a bit and it will continue to cook after you add it to the hot pasta.  Sprinkle the whole thing with parmesan and it'll be perfect.  My Mom puts her scampi in the broiler and then tosses it with the pasta.  I didn't do that.

Only change I made was used chicken broth instead of wine (did not have any used chicken broth as others reviews suggested) & did not disgard garlic Oh ya I added 6 gloves of garlic (just because we love it)and also just to make this a little bit healthy I used 4 tablespoons butter & 4 tablespoons can't believe it's not butter - they did not no the difference! Served with penne pasta & garlic bread. Yummmm, Thanks

This was ok.  It was good, but it didn't make me say mmmmmmmmm......  I think it needed more garlic (and I did not take mine out) and something else, not sure what.  I will make again, but add a bit more seasoning, more garlic.

This was very tasty.  I did follow other readers suggestions and used less bread crumbs and put the parm cheese in as it was cooking.  I love cooking with wine so that was nice.  I did use a little lemon and fresh parsley at the end.  My hubby loved it and it is a keeper.

Terrific, it was very easy for a quick meal. I didn't have any angel hair pasta so I used Penne, I left the garlic in the oil as others had mentioned. I didn't want to make a separate pot for asparagus so I cut it up and threw it in with the shrimp. It turned out great. Thank you for the recipe.

Very good!  Unusual use of bread crumbs.  I only used a half cup of bread crumbs, though.  More than that and it would have been too dry and clumpy.  Make sure you serve it with a salad or other green veggie on the side.  It is very rich with no healthy ingredients, just yumminess!

We loved it - for the taste and the ease.  I agree with some of the other reviews about the bread crumbs - I only used about 1/3 of a cup, and I too left the garlic in.  I added a sprinkle of Italian seasoning, too.  I will definitely make this again!

Delicious! I had no butter, I used a few tablespoons olive oil instead. I also didn't discard the garlic. The breadcrumbs were a great idea, but I only used about half of what the recipe calls for. Holding onto this one!

I did as another reviewer suggested and omitted the bread crumbs in favor of adding more Parmesan cheese.  I also added a dash or three of crushed peppers.  The recipe makes for a good, mid-week meal; not necessarily out-of-this-world great, but definitely good and satisfying.

This recipe is absolutely amazing!!! The only thing I do differently, is I substitute half of the breadcrumbs (I use Italin seasoned breadcrumbs) with Parmesan cheese. Adding parmesan cheese afterwards seems to dry out the dish to me, so I add it while it's cooking!!!! YUMMY!

I liked this recipe alot. very easy to follow and customize.  for 1 serving, id use a half stick of butter, a teaspoon of flour until cooked, then added garlic, then added the shrimp, while shrimp was cooking i added the wine (i used chardonay) and then just blended it with the noodles.  mmmmm.  i also added pepper.  i didnt like when i added the bread crumbs, so i dont recommend that.

This recipe was very easy to prepare and it ended up having a delicious flavor to it.  I cut back the amount of bread crumbs to about 1/3 cup and doubled the amount of sauce.  However, the sauce ended up very buttery/greasy and it kept separating.  I added the bread crumbs just until it was barely set up and yet the sauce still seemed to take on the texture of those bread crumbs.  While the flavor was outstanding, I plan on finding a recipe with a better sauce.

This was quick and easy, and SOOOOO good.  Even my husband loved it, and he can't stand the taste of wine in anything.  I did add extra garlic, but we adore garlic, and I went super light on the breadcrumbs to make more of a coating for the angel hair - but man, it was totally delicious!!!

Made this as stated, other than adding some oregano, basil and lemon pepper... it was terrific!  Loved the addition of the bread crumbs.  Next time I may use more wine as I found it very rich.  (I noticed that one recipe on this site used 1 cup wine, but all other ingred seemed about the same.)  Will make again, hubby raved!

This was excellent!  My hubby was braging to his friends the next day.  Based on others feedback, the only adjustment I made was that I didn't add all of the bread crumbs.  I just sprinkled them in slowly until it started to thicken.  I will make this again!  Thanks for sharing!  :o)

Ok, but way too much lemon.  I also used Italian style bread crumbs to thicken a very thin sauce.  Not sure I would make it again.

I LOVED this recipe! it was so easy to make. I did remove the garlic after it softened, and I replaced the wine with chicken broth. Also, I used about a 1/4 cup of bread crumbs. I really wish i had followed other reviewer's advice to DOUBLE the sauce. Next time I will definitely be doing that. THANK YOU for this great recipe!

Lovely, lovely meal!  Didn't remove the garlic, as we're garlic-lovers.  Next time, I'll leave out the bread crumbs - soaked up too much of those yummy garlic-butter juices.

My family liked it but there have been others that have been better. The bread crumbs were a nice touch to thicken the sauce but it left us with no sauce for the noodles. I did add only a little at a time as suggested by others. Thanks for sharing - I will try again with a few changes.

I only used half the amount of bread crumbs and I thought it tasted like I was just eating bread crumbs.  There was just not enough sauce to it.  It didn't have much of a shrimp/garlic flavor to it.  My parents thought it was alright but I would never make this again.
