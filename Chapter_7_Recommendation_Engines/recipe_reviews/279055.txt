I used the ingredients and flavors as a base for my very delicious soup. I added diced tomatoes and a jalapeño pepper to jazz it up.

This soup turned out delicious! I will definitely make it again. I will probably use less  red pepper next time. It’s a matter of taste!

This soup caught my eye as we are in northern Ohio and a hot soup is still appealing in early April. Due to the world Virus, supplies vary at the grocery store. I bought 3 one-pound cans of lentils and drained them because there were no dried lentils. I used my soup pot on the stove top instead of the Instant Pot. All else exactly the same. Delicious!

This is a delicious soup! I successfully used spinach ---didn't have any kale. I also used hot chili powder and it had a kick that was also delicious. I would suggest not doubling the recipe unless you have the largest instant pot. I was up to the max line in my pot when I doubled and then couldn't add all the squash it called for in the recipe ---still very good!

Delicious! Only change I made was to cook on my stovetop and use zucchini instead of yellow squash. Husband and kid approved!

I didn't have any vegetable stock on hand so I used chicken stock,  and I almost doubled the amount of the spices, some nice heat came thru with the increase in chile powder.

I hesitate making soups (other than chicken noodle) because I'm not a huge fan. This one I would definitely make again and I was definitely a fan of the taste. I omitted the coriander, kale and squash because I didn't have any. This is an excellent, easy recipe.

This recipe is delicious. The whole family loved it and it makes a big batch you can save in the fridge or freezer for later. It tastes even better after a couple of days. Super yummy!
