This is an excellent recipe and does taste better if chilled overnight. Using a rotisserie chicken makes the recipe SO easy.  I have also added a large can of pineapple chunks, drained. Served on a large platter with papaya and avocado it makes a nice luncheon entree.

Excellent recipe even if you skip many of the ingredients. I often do a plain chicken/papaya version during the week. So unique, easy quick prep and versatile I have had this for breaky, lunch and dinner and never tire of it.

I followed the recipe exactly with only one omission:  I did not have any papaya.  I often add curry to my chicken salad, but not this much.  I will cut back on the curry to 1/2 tsp, if I make this again.  I like chicken salad with grapes, but I don't think the avocado added much, and I love avocado.  IMHO, the sweetness of the fruit was not enhanced by the avocado, or vice versa.  I would like to try this again with the papaya, leave off the avocado, and cut back on the curry.  I will also omit the water chestnuts, since there was plenty of crunch from the almonds and the celery.

I made this Chicken salad for my three adult daughters for our mothers day lunch. They loved it.
