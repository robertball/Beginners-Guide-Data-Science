This is soooo good.  I've made it two times now and I just can't get enough.  The chicken is so tender and just makes a really flavorful sauce.  I like the sauce a bit thicker than Chef John demonstrated in his video, and so by the time I reduced it to the desired thickness, there wasn't much sauce left.  So the second time I made it, I started with 2x 24 ounce jars of sauce and just 3 Cups of water.  Gosh it is tasty.  I highly recommend this.

Wonderful! I followed the recipe as written, and it turned out fabulous. I think it's even better the next day. The leftover sauce also freezes well.

I followed the recipe exactly. I thought it was delicious, but my wife and children did not like it as much as I did. I think what threw them off is that they were expecting a traditional spaghetti sauce taste and this definitely has a much different taste than traditional spaghetti sauce. Anyway,I liked it and thatâ€™s what counts! Thanks Chef John!

Chicken and spaghetti is my favorite combo. This recipe was 4 1/2 stars.  I added 1 cup of wine during cooking time and reduced by 2/3

The sauce was really tasty.  My adult son really liked it.  I'm not sure how I feel about poached chicken in spaghetti though.  It tasted good, just seemed out of place.  I only cooked the pasta 4 minutes because the sauce was still very loose even after an hour reducing, and I only used 1.5 jars of water and a 32 oz jar of marinara.
