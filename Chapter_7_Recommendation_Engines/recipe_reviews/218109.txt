Quick, easy, and delicious - perfect for lunch! Plus, it's a great way to use up leftover grilled chicken. all I had to do was sautee some peppers. I used red and green for some added color and flavor to go along with the thin sliced red onion. I used a thin crust boboli bread shell and our favorite bbq sauce. I also used a Mexican blend cheese but I'm sure any cheese would do as long as it gets nice and bubbly! Overall, very tasty!

I made this as a last minute dinner for my three boys, leaving myself out as I'm suffering from some kind of summer sickness. I used a full pound of chicken breasts, red pepper instead of green (that's what we prefer), and as a pre-baked crust, I used 1 sheet of Pillsbury crescent roll dough baked as a pizza crust. I did not have the kind of Kraft cheese that the recipe called for so I used just plain old sharp cheddar cheese. This recipe was incredibly simple, lent well to substitutions so I could use what I had on hand, was cost effective to make (most of the ingredients I used I couponed) and the boys inhaled it. Serves six? Psh. THREE. No leftovers

I've made a version very similar to this, with the exception of using a gluten free pizza crust and I like to bake it on my gas grill.  I have never tried the cheddar with Philadelphia cheese, but I intend to see if I can find that version of cheese and make this again!

Delicious recipe. I made it just this evening! It is different enough to be made for a dinner of adults and older children who are tired of the same ol' same ol'. Young ones may not like this recipe. We really enjoyed it.

Made this pizza tonight using Jay's Signature Pizza Crust recipe from AR and was it delicious.  A little extra work, but so much better the ready to use crusts.  Never bothered to measure anything and kept the ingredients the same.  I cooked the chicken breasts first in a little olive oil and seasoned them with roasted garlic sea salt.  Once the chicken was done, I then cooked the sliced green pepper and a very liberal amount of diced red onion.  Will definitely be making this pizza again.  Thanks Kraft, this is a keeper.

This was delicious! My husband and I ate it up! I used a boboli premade pizza crust and a mix of a couple different bbq sauces we had in the fridge with red pepper, purple onion, and mexi blend cheese. SOOO tasty!

I completely rate the topping on this a 10, but the bbq sauce and store pre-baked crust about a 2. I may even make the topping to put in a sandwich sometime. To save time I bought a rotisserie chicken at my whole sale club. I realized that the peppers and onions were supposed to be cooked with the uncooked chicken, so I added a spoon of whipped butter and cooked the peppers and onions alone on med. low. Once they were carmelized I added the cut up rotisserie chicken. At first bite the topping is so good until I got to the sweet and yet still kind of cold bbq sauce and tasteless crust. I may use the topping again with my own crust and bbq sauce. Quick meal, but I guess I like more of that homemade taste.

This pizza was delicious!! The only thing I did differently was that I added some freshly chopped cilantro before adding the cheese (as most bbq chicken pizzas come with it), and left off the onions b/c I do not like them. Overall easy and tasted great left over!

Used the pre-cooked chicken strips in the lunch meat aisle and followed everything to a T.  It was SOOO yummy, exactly what I was looking for!

This is a deliciously easy meal! I used the pizza crust from the packet, where you just add water, so I could make a thin crust. The BBQ sauce used in this recipe is good- a bit on the sweet side, but incredible with the type of cheese used (touch of philidelphia). I made two pizzas to feed my family of 5 and will be making it again soon, I'm sure! Yum!

Absolutely Yummy! I seasoned the veggies and chicken with some Season All as it cooked and then when it was done I poured the barbecue sauce in the pan and let it simmer a little over an hour adding more sauce and a little water as needed. I had a dough that we were waiting for to finish rising hence the toppings simmer time. I'd fix this again the same way. I used a half a green pepper and Texas sweet onion, Bullseye Memphis style sauce, and Monteray Jack cheese. We were wowed. I wanted to rate this 5 stars but since I made slight changes by using homemade crust, letting the sauce simmer, and using MJ cheese I didn't feel like a 5 would be an honest to goodness rating on this. Thanks!!!

Simple but effective recipe. I altered it a bit, I used mozzarella instead of cheddar, Sweet Baby Rays instead of Bull's-Eye and i added a bit of jalapeno for some serious flavor.  You can never go wrong with BBQ chicken pizza.  One of my favorite pizza's.

Everyone in my family loves this pizza.  I love making it!  I add red bell peppers too and make it with canned crust.  Turns out great!
