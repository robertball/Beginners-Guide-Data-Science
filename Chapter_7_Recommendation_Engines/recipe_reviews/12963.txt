This is an excellent recipe! We have had Avegolemono (it's Greek name)many, many times in restaurants. Our FAVORITE makes it a little less rich (less eggs),a lot more rice and chicken, and with just-a-little thinner broth.  I will adjust this recipe to our tastes next time;but this was a wonderful example of Greek Lemon Rice soup.  Thank you so much,for the recipe!  I suspect the reviews that said it was too salty, were using 'boullion' or a brand of soup base that was very salty. My brand soup base "Vogue" did not have a lot of salt (I bought it at an health food store). Also, I never add the rice into the large pot;but only in the INDIVIDUAL serving bowls; I mix it in JUST prior to serving. It works better for leftovers;you never wind up with puffed up rice mush this way. :)

I think this is a great soup! I as usual changed a few things. First I do not precook the rice, I added olive oil to pan, and cooked the chopped onion, carrots,celery and rice for about 10 min. Than I added the broth, lemon juice, 1/2 cup white wine, and 1 can of "Creamed Chicken soup" instead of the butter and flour. I used only FOUR egg yolks. I also did not add more chicken. Prepared this way my boys really liked it - a good thickness, but not too thick. Really GOOD!!!

I was only going to give this 4 stars since it was not a hit with my family, though I loved it, and my best friend and her two kids were fighting over the sample that I brought over to them. Alas, I finished the remains when I returned home and decided it needs 5 stars.

Made the following changes:
just used 1 1/2 TBS chicken soup base in water; eliminated the celery;
sauteed onion with 2 cloves garlic in EVOO before adding to soup; only used 2 TBS butter & flour to make a light roux, added some broth to the roux before adding back into soup; added 1/2 cup uncooked orzo pasta during last 10-15 mins of cooking; only used 4 egg yolks; used a roasted chicken from grocery which I skinned, boned, and chopped before adding to soup;  garnished w/ fresh, minced parsley

This was my first attempt at a greek dish and my fiance loved it! He is greek and he said the recipe was perfect, just the right amount of lemon. This is a definite keeper! I do want to mention that instead of canned chicken broth I used real chicken broth from a whole chicken (4.25 lbs) I boiled for the recipe. I then shredded the meat from the whole chicken to add to the soup. I also added 2 teaspoons of Greek seasoning. Lastly, I used a full cup of the veggies instead of the 1/2 cup it called for.
Thanks!

My whole family loves this soup!  I modified this a little bit, though. I only added 4 egg yolks to cut down on the fat a little bit.  I also substituted orzo pasta for the rice.  I actually prefer this style chicken soup with the fresh lemon juice over traditional chicken and dumplings.  It is so easy to make, too.

I actually made this soup twice. I thought I must have made the recipe wrong because it was sooooo salty and lemony.  I reduced the base to 2 tbsp and the lemon to 1/3 cup and it was still too strong for my test and I'm a salt lover.  I was very disappointed because I love the lemon chicken soup I get in restaurants.

This soup was a huge hit at our friend's yearly Greek party. His family is Greek, he had me add a total of about 12 lemons, he said "you just cant have too much lemon!" The key to making it creamy is at the end. You put the hot broth into a food processor or blender and turn it on. Add the egg/lemon juice mixture in a slow stream to the broth and keep blending for a few minutes until it is frothy.  You would never guess there is egg in the finished product. I LOVE this soup!

I normally love Greek lemon soup.......But this was SOOOOO salty!!!!! I'm not sure if it was the type of base I used or if the recipe has a typeo when it calls for 6 tablespoons of base. I will try this again with less base.

GREAT soup! I boiled a whole chicken (about 4lbs) in stock pot. Covered in water, added 2 stalks celery, a peeled carrot and 1/2 an onion (quartered) for flavor. Brought to fast boil and then turned to down simmer for 2.5 hours. Drain your stock through a colinder and let the chicken sit in the colinder for about 10 minutes to cool. Picked chicken apart, just FELL apart, perfect! Then shredded the chicken for soup. I did double the amount of chicken in my soup, and still had enough chicken leftover for another pot (and enough homemade stock to make another pot too!). I did slowly add the lemon juice, after reading all the reviews, but did end up using the entire 1/2 cup. This amount was perfect to my husband, but I squeezed an extra slice right on my bowl, brought it closer to the "coney" taste I am used to. It took about 1.5 lemons for me to get the 1/2 cup of juice. Used 6 tsp of the chicken soup base, which was perfect, not too salty at all. Also used the 4 egg yolks, rather than 8. Did cook the rice and then just added rice to each bowl and poured the soup over to keep from rice soaking up too much liquid. THANK YOU to everyone who has made this and provided very vailable feedback.  After reading all the reviews and taking everything into consideration I feel like I mastered this on the first try! This is the kind of soup I will always keep single servings in the freezer for a cold day  :)

Creamy and hearty, like the kind you get in a restaurant. I cut the chicken boullion in half, and use low-sodium broth, otherwise it's too salty.

I put in extra rice.  And I did not think that it had too much lemon - just right.
This is a great recipe!

I cut the recipe in half. Did not use soup base at all. I kept the rice separate so people could add as much or as little as they wanted. EXCELLENT! Hit the spot, exactly what I was craving. Light, creamy, lemony, Delish. I melted the butter before mixing with the flour and also shredded the chicken instead of cubing. I will be making this again and again! Thank you for this great recipe

I really liked the flavor of this soup; however, I thought it was way too salty. Typically, I am one to add salt to my food. Whereas, my boyfriend is very sensitive to salt. I used "Better than Bouillon" chicken soup base and knowing that is very salty (from previous recipes) I reduced the amount I used in this recipe. Still my boyfriend had a hard time eating it even though he enjoyed the soup.
I should have reduced the number of tablespoons further. We both ended up adding water (twice) to our individual servings and to the pot. I think next time I will reduce the bouillon down to half or less. It was still delicious and I will definitely make it again; however, with the aformentioned alterations.

I use a recipe very similar to this, but I use orzo instead of rice (more authentic). It's outstanding. You will never want to eat any other type of chicken soup again. Serve this with a full bodied greek salad, and *wow* you've got a winner!

This was very good with some modifications.  I'm very glad I read previous reviews before I made this.  I halved the egg yolks and soup base, added 1 1/2 cups of cooked orzo instead of rice and also flavored the soup with 2 teaspoons of oregano (I would recommend Greek seasoning, but I didn't have any so the oregano worked).  The recipe as written would not have been as good.  Thanks for all the suggestions.  My two year olds each ate three bowls!

I love this soup and have had it many times in Greek restaurants. I was happy to find this recipe to try it myself, and it was just as good as any I've ever had. I think it's important to note that I added no soup base, as I don't use the stuff. It was more than fine without it. I cut the recipe in half as I didn't need 16 servings. So this is where my only issue with this recipe lies. There is no way this serves 8 when cut in half, never mind 16 when not. I ended up adding more broth just to increase the volume. Fortunately, that didn't dilute the flavor much and only made it a little thinner. If the serving size had been accurate, I would have made the full recipe.

excellent soup.  This is one of my favorites.  I added more chicken, chopped spinach and instead of rice, Shirataki (tofu) noodles.  It made it more of a complete meal with more protein and vegetables.   I was afraid of tempering the egg, but it worked perfectly.   I did use only 4 eggs and that really tasted fine.

I made some adjustments to this recipe: omitted carrots and celery, used 3 T of chicken base instead of 6 T (and it was still pretty salty), used black pepper instead of white, butter instead of margarine, orzo instead of white rice, and 4 egg yolks instead of 8, and did not use the 16 slices of lemon. I noticed that 1 cup of orzo was not at all enough.  Next time I will add at least 2 times the amount listed in this recipe.  The soup is delicious, my husband loved it and I would make it again.

I love Greek food. I've made this soup twice only. Loved it both times. My husband doesn't like creamy soups at all. I had a very hard time convincing him of the fact that the soup is a flour base soup with lemon. No cream. He liked it once he tried it. Thanks for the recipe.

Great Recipe!! The only change I have made is to add more white pepper for a little more heat as is our preferrence, and omit the flour completely.  It seemed to make it too thick and not as I remembered my Greek Grandmother used to make.  By omitting the flour, it tastes exactly like what I remember in my youth. . . PERFECT

Darnit, second time I've done this to an otherwise perfectly good batch. It must be noted that you pour the yolk VERY slowly into the soup, otherwise you get an egg drop soup consistency. This should be emphasized.

Great chicken soup recipe! My family gobbled it up! My changes: added 2 tsp Greek seasoning to the lemon base; and I used orzo instead of rice. This one is a keeper! I will definitely make this again!

This soup hit the spot and is great when you have to feed a family who is suffering with colds. I added a cup of orzo instead of rice and used half the eggyolks. I made the roux with butter instead of margarine because that's what I had. We used fresh lemons and parsley from our yard. Yummy.

Can't decide whether to give it a three. It is way too lemony and salty, I should have started with less and added more after tasting. I still feel it needs more tweaking.

First time I ever made Lemon Rice Soup and we all LOVED it.  I tweaked it based on other reviewers and loved the version I came up with.  I did not use flour/butter for roux...instead added a can of cream of chicken soup and a little cornstarch dissolved in cold water to thicken it a bit. I used orzo instead of rice and placed the cooked orzo in individual serving bowls, then ladled soup over.  I also used 1/2 of a rotisserie chicken cut up.  Great  flavor, easy recipe.  Paired it with Spanakopita for an awesome dinner.  =)

Followed the directions, although I will say, the portion sizes are geared towards this being served as a side dish and not a main meal.  Might cut back a bit on the lemon juice in the future, as it is pretty strong.  Would also add more pepper (both white and black), and I'm trying to think of a good spice to give it a little more depth of flavor, but haven't figured out what that would be just yet.

This is a truly wonderful recipe! It has a great body and richness yet is light in flavor.  I give the original recipe 4 stars since it does need a couple changes IMO.  Since I've made it 3 times now, I do have some changes that improved it.  First off- the amt of "chicken soup base" is too much for me. Of course this will greatly depend on what brand or kind you use, but it was too salty for me so I adjusted to 2 TBSP.  I don't see how 6 TBSP of any brand could work.  I use butter instead of margarine simply because I never have margarine in the house. And I only use 4 egg yolks.  Don't be afraid of the egg yolks, it just makes a wonderful almost-creamy full bodied soup! But I don't think you need 8.  Do be sure to temper the yolks properly or you'll end up with scrambled eggs. I have made the rice separate and in the soup.  You can really do either, it works both ways, but is thicker when made in the soup.  When I made this last night I got oooohhhs and aaaaahs with "this is delicious" said about 5 times.  Served with warm pita and tzatziki. That was nice for a change but it is honestly a meal in itself as well!

This is very good. I changed it as follows: 
Only used 4 egg yolks (didn't like it with 8)
Used a lot less Chicken soup base - just did this to taste.
I also used some diced meat from a Lemon Pepper Rotisseree chicken which added a nice flavor. 
Have made this with both white and brown rice and it was good both ways.
I also omitted the Flour / butter paste....it was thick enough without it.

This definitely needs less base. I used homemade (no salt) chicken broth and only 4 Tbsp of base, and it was still almost too salty for us. Next time I'll use 3, and if you're using commercial stock, I'd recommend using 2 and then tasting for seasoning. I used the juice of one whole lemon, plus the zest of half the lemon and it was perfect for our tastes.  I didn't have leftover chicken, so I just poached a chicken breast in the broth while the vegetables were simmering for the 20 minutes. I precooked orzo pasta for this batch, but I think next time I will just add it uncooked a few minutes after I add the butter/flour mixture, to make this a true one pot meal.   I kept everything else the same, and although it was a touch salty, we absolutely loved it. With a little less soup base, this is an easy 5 stars. Thank you for the recipe!

Although I think this recipe was a 3 star for me, Im giving it a 4 because I might have messed it up a bit.. not sure. It was pretty salty, a little too much for my husband. However, Im not sure if that was because I used an already made chicken (which was probably heavily seasoned). The chicken base probably added a lot of salt too. I might make again, but make with low sodium ingredients. Thanks for the recipe! My son liked this soup!!

Definitely a typo on the "6 Tbsp" of soup base, use 6 teaspoons and this will turn out perfect.  Exactly the taste I was looking for which is just like a authentic greek restaurant here in Chicago.  It goes together so quickly, I can't believe it is this easy to make.

I made this a couple days ago when we really needed to go grocery shopping so I didn't have much on hand.  I did have enough to make recipe though, which was great.  I served it with some leftover naan that needed to be used up.  I did not have onion or celery (we honestly don't care for them anyway) so I used extra carrots instead.  I used the full amount of egg yolks called for.  I probably had a bit more rice than called for, as I had some leftover from a previous dinner and I just put rice in our bowls and poured the soup over the top.  It was easy, filling, and my husband said he liked it too.

I made this soup EXACTLY as stated. I love lemon, but thought this was too lemony. Next time i would only use a 1/4c lemon. Plus, i don't really see that all these egg yolks and butter really improve the taste, so i would cut that as well. I wanted to see exactly how much better it made it with all the fat and calories, but i wasn't impressed. I could make it much healthier with exactly the same flavor. The lemon, chicken, and veggies is really where the flavor comes from. The rest should be cut way down. Plus, i would add more rice and chicken as suggested in other reviews.

This was pretty awesome.  My boys order this soup at every Greek restaurant we go to, and they agreed this was at least as good, if not better.  Made this as the original recipe prescribed except for very minor tweaks: 1) I cooked the onion and celery in olive oil first; 2) I didn't use the flour/margarine for thickening as the soup didn't need it; 3) I used 8C water and 6TB chicken base; and 4) I only used six egg yolks.  Delicious.

This soup is so delicious.  I made a couple of changes.  First, I didn’t bother adding the chicken base.   To get the maximum flavor from the vegetables, I sautéed them in a little butter, then mixed in the flour, and then added the chicken broth that I had heated in the microwave.  The soup came out perfect.  I’ll be making this again.

I made homemade broth with a whole chicken (didn't add any salt in anticipation of the too salty problem many people had...I didn't have that problem at all) and I substituted orzo for white rice.  I added 1/2 c raw orzo when I added the butter/flour mixture.  It came out great!  I garnished with a bit of feta, which really adds to the flavor.

5 stars for an excellent base!  With a few tweeks, this has a permanent place in the weekly rotation.  I add 1-2 t. greek seasoning (from McCormick) with the first simmer. No celery for me (personal preference) and double the carrots and onion.  Chicken soup base varies, and I only need 3T. for flavor. Sub butter for margarine.  I also use 5 egg yolks and 2+ cups of rice.

My whole family loved this recipe. It has just the right amount of lemon in it. It was just a tad salty so I may reduce the amount of chicken base next time, but otherwise it's excellent as is!

Good recipe, although, a little too "lemony" for my hubby.  I added zucchini slices and sliced rather than shredded carrot.  Halved the butter and flour, and used couscous since I didn't have orzo on hand...just halved the amount since the couscous swells a bit when it cooks.  Enjoyed it myself though, and it was good for the kids since they're fighting colds!  Might try it again in the summer as a light side soup.  Thanx for sharing!

Truly delicious! Light and filling at the same time! My only alterations: I used 3 tbls of soup base ("Better than Boullion" brand), 5 egg yolks, and a little more chicken and veggies than the recipe called for. Oh yeah, and I used wild rice instead of regular white rice. It didn't get soggy at all. Nice. I will be making this again and again. I served with homemade hummus and warm pita. Next time, I might use 1/3 cup lemon juice (I liked it very lemony, but husband thought it was a little too much.)

I made a few alterations but will still give this recipe 5 stars, as I feel all recipes are merely guidelines.  I used half the recipe, homemade chicken stock, and sauteed 1/3 cup of each veggies plus a clove of garlic along with 3 oz each of raw rice and orzo in olive oil butter combo.  The raw rice and orzo eliminates the need for the roux, and the rice, as at my Greek restaurant, is soft.  I used 1 cup chicken and 3 egg yolks and I had no chicken base on hand, but it tasted good without it and I am sure it would taste more chickeny with it.  Very easy and tasty, thick and creamy.

Being from the Detroit area, this soup is often enjoyed at our local favorite Coney joints, and this is very comparable, if not better. We stuck to the recipe, the only things we changed were using 1 cup uncooked rice (whatever that equals to cooked, 3 cups, I think), and added two flattened, shredded boneless chicken breasts. Not too salty, not too lemony. Overall, this recipe was delicious, and a keeper. Thanks for sharing!

I don't even like soup and I LOVED THIS...I only had one Tablespoon of Turkey Soup base, so I used that and added a touch more salt. I also added cream of chicken soup as a thickener. I'm officially addicted!
While the broth was heating up, I put a single chicken breast in the broth to cook. Then added the veggies after a bit. I used the one chicken breast as the chopped chicken and it was enough. I also used the full amount of lemon juice and it was the perfect lemony flavor.

My family didn't really like it, although I did. If you like hollendaise sauce you will like this soup. I am glad I made it, but wished I had halved the recipe.

This was fantastic--at least as good as that which i had in my favorite greek restaurant last week.  i added an entire head of minced garlic and sauteed all the vegetables to tender in olive oil before adding all the other ingredients.  i did not use the soup base as i don't have it and don't use it in order to decrease the Na+.  the lemon and salt flavors were just perfect.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and added the rice to individual bowls of soup.  Also, used cornstarch instead of flour because my husband has gluten sensitivity.  Use half the amount of cornstarch as you would flour.  Always substitute butter for margarine to avoid TFAs.   This soup is perfect.

I made this and just like KerryW mentioned, it was over-the-top salty. My husband and I tried to eat it, and it was just too much salt. Next time, I'll either use 3-4 cups of water in place of chicken broth to balance out the salt when adding the chicken soup base, or i'll ditch the base all together. Otherwise, the soup came together nicely, looked just like restaurant quality, and smelled delicious. It was just too bad we had to waste so many ingredients because of the saltiness.

I love this. It was out of my comfort zone with the egg yolks, but it was actually really easy. I halved the recipe, made my own chicken stock. Subbed bell pepper for celery (since I didn't have any). We eat low salt so I just added about a teaspoon on tones chicken base. I just used one lemon, but it was very juicy. I used more White Pepper because I love it & added fresh garlic & a some fish rub seasoning that I make. I only used 2 yolks, and less of the flour butter mixture - I tend to like more of a brothy soup than a creamy one. Since I'm the only one eating it, I just added the rice to my bowl. I'll eat the rest tomorrow for lunch & add rice at that time. Really filling, different & tasty! Thanks for sharing the recipe.

We had this soup once in our local greek resturaunt and loved it. I've been hoping I could find a similar recipe and was thrilled to find this variation which I love even more.   I varied the recipe a bit by reducing the soup base to 4T and also added an extra 1/4c. each of the vegetables to make the soup a bit heartier.   The recipe recieved 5 stars all around from my entire family of picky eaters.

Very nice! I made a few slight variations. I used orzo instead of rice, I did not have chicken base so I used one boullion cube. I omitted the celery. This was as good as the soup I use to get at a greek restaurant called Nabilles! Thanks for sharing.

As written, this soup is very very very salty! However, I think it will be just right if I cut down on the chicken soup base and lemon juice!

I LOVED this recipe! Left out the carrots and added lemon zest, due to personal preferences; also, I didn't have any soup base, so I added some poultry seasoning to compensate. The only issue I had is that I had to add quite a bit more chicken stock to keep the soup "loose". A great combination of fresh and comforting!

PERFECT!  I am no where near having any cooking experience so this recipe was perfect for me.  I was dying to figure out how to make avgolemono (the Greek name for this soup) at home and this recipe seemed the easiest, and the most like what I'm used to.  I kept everything the same except I used Orzo instead of rice.  The soup came out so creamy, tasty and wonderful, I was very impressed with myself!  I can't wait to have my husband taste it (he's a chef) hopefully he'll be impressed but I'm sure he will be-this came out great!

I LOVE this soup.  I did leave out the celery (personal preference) and the chicken soup base.  I replaced the broth with water + 8 cubes chicken bouillion (1 cube/cup water).  I added extra lemon juice and it turned out delicious--perfect lemon flavor and not salty at all.

I made this to accompany a baked chicken dinner.  It is delicious, but I did make a couple of slight changes.  The amount of soup base appeared to be too much.  I added some and stopped when it fit my taste.  Same was true of the amount of lemon juice.  I started with 1/4 cup and went from there.

I am in love with this soup!! The flavour was awesome for me, very lemony without being sour. My husband didn't like the lemon taste so much, but to bad for him! He's allergic to rice, so I substituted orzo pasta and some barley for the rice, which turned out great.

I made this the other night. I gave it 4 stars because I did make a few changes to the recipe. I took the advice of a previous review about blending the soup while adding the egg yolk to it - wow, just wow. The consistency of the soup was dead on delicious.  Whenever I have this soup, there are not other veggies in it so I wanted to keep close to its roots of the soup because my boyfriend is from the Mediterranean. This is how I made the soup - the only vegetables I used was garlic and onion. I sautéed the onion and garlic first, added said ingredients together and threw the cooked onion/garlic in the soup. For this particular soup, the more lemon the better. I used 8 organic lemons. I used white and black pepper. Added the butter/flour mixture into the soup and then put it in the blender. While blending the soup, I slowly added the egg yolk into it. After that, I put the soup back on the stove, heated it through (you will see a beautiful froth on top at this point). I shredded a lemon pepper rotisserie chicken, threw it in the soup. I made the orzo separately and platted it in the bowl and poured the soup right on top.

wow, what a great recipe. It takes some time, but it makes so much which is great cuz...I'll eat every last drop.

I got stuck on eating this from Greek restaurant here in California. This restaurant has there carrots,celery,onions and chicken minces so I used my magic bullet to get that effect, I also use arborio rice which, gives it a creamer texture and a much smooth taste in your soup if you like a nice cream soup, not that this isn't already.

For folks that feel that it was to salty, I say chicken base is already super salty (as are most soups) so maybe adjust it there. I used 2 different types of chicken base for my soup. Knorr and Herbox by Hormel..there super-duper-salty but, I used the amount the recipe called for and I found it a tad.. just a tad salty but still yummy. Also, I used Organic chicken broth.
The only thing I will change next time I make this I will use only 6 eggs yolks cuz, I could smell the egg in the soup a bit and I'm not a fan of eggs.. but it didn't prevent me from eating it at all.

Mmmm-mm! Yummy! I'm not really a fan of soups, but this one was great. I left out the soup base completely, and the flour, and I also reduced the number of egg yolks to 5.
 
I noticed that some reviewers had trouble with the saltiness of the soup. Here's what you could do : peel a potato, cut it into large pieces and then put it in the food, letting it simmer for about 10-15 minutes. Remove the potato(es) and taste. If it's still too salty, repeat. Hope this helps!

Absolutely delicious.  This is exactly what I wanted -- just like the homemade soup served in Greek family restaurants in the Chicago area.  I did add a bit of heavy cream at the end because I like a creamier soup.  Otherwise, followed the recipe exactly.

This flavorful soup is adaptable and easy to prepare.  My version was short about 2 tbsp. of soup base and 4 eggs and included a bowlful of leftover cooked rice (@ 4 cups) and shredded chicken from two pieces of a kabob.  Topped with fresh snipped parsley.  Even with the modifications the soup was thick, rich, creamy and delicious.  Loved it!

I absolutely love this soup! i have made it so many times! I don't put as much soup base in it though. I add about half or 1/4 of the soup base so its not too salty. Some think it is too lemony, but i think it is just right. This is most definitely my favorite soup!

This beats the Greek Lemon Chicken soup at my favorite local soup shop - and that's saying a lot! A couple modifications - we used all the meat from a rotisserie chicken, and made stock from the carcass; I used a lot more onion and rice, and right at the end added some chopped fresh basil. I want to eat this every day!!

I made this for the first time today and it turned out GREAT! I did not have any fresh lemons but used lemon juice instead, and as per other reviews I only used 4 egg yokes. I added leftover chicken and put white rice in bowls and poured soup over....Perfect! My teenage sons thought it was a nice light soup on a hot day. It does have a strong lemon flavor but we enjoyed it very much!

This was my first time making lemon rice soup , although the recipe was so yummy , i have to give it 4 stars , reason is , you DON'T need 6 TBSP. soup base , i only used 3 tbsp and it still way too salty . I ended up have to add a little water , to tone it down . Next time i probably just use 1-2 tbsp. soup base . In my opinion unless you use water instead of chicken broth you don't need 6 tbsp. of soup base . All and all it was easy recipe and delicious .. minus the 6 tbsp.  of soup base :)

I make this soup at least once a month. We cannot get enough of it. It is very easy and quick to make and ike most soups, it tastes even better the next day. The only adjustments I make are I start with 1/4 C lemon juice and cut the chicken base to 4 TBLS and I add cornstarch to thicken it instead of the flour. We do not even add the rice. It is great on its own!

This recipe turned out really well with simple uncooked chicken that eventually makes it's own broth and adds a real chicken flavor, this way u can avoid processed bases that make it too salty, I added the chicken at the begining and didn't need chicken broth or base, just some salt later on. I would next time try only 4 eggs for a healthier version, even though I do love the richness and consistency I  ended up with, also I liked the idea to add the rice in later for better leftover serving.

this was very good.  i cut the eggs in half (4 yolks instead of 8), used only 2 tablespoons of chicken stock (would have been entirely too salty otherwise without low sodium stock), 2 tbsp of margarine and 2 tbsp of flour mixed with a bit of the soup broth as the thickener, boiled a whole chicken and used the broth from that, used the boiled chicken in the soup, put rice in the bowls before adding the soup so as to not end up with rice mush, all as per other users suggestions.  i didnt find the soup too lemony or salty.  i did use a bit more celery and carrots than the recipe called for, it was perfect.  will be making again.

This is the second time I've made this soup, the first time I followed the recipe exactly, and my family and I liked it BUT it was very salty and too chunky. So this time I tweaked it slightly. I used half a bullion cube in place of the chicken soup base. I also used orzo in place of rice, and omitted the celery. With the celery, onion and carrots it makes the soup too "chunky" but other than that it is a wonderful recipe.

ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!! I made this soup exact to the recipe and it was voted the best dish at the gathering I took it too. It tastes like a soup you would find at an elegant restaurant rather than something made in a common kitchen. When making this soup, do not make changes to the recipe. You will find it is a perfect balance of salt and lemon. Also, the amount of egg yolks determine the smooth consistency and rich flavor. It was just as delicious the next day warmed up. Thankyou for this recipe!!

This is so delicious.  I have made it several times now, and we seldom have left overs, although they are just as good the next day if you're lucky enough to have them.  This is the only chicken soup I make now.  Great recipe, thanks.

Super good soup.  I was looking for a recipe that would taste like the soup I had in a restaurant, and this was it.  I did take others suggestions and use only 4 egg yolks and cut back on the soup starter a bit.  Delicious!!!

I followed the advice of others, but I think I should of stuck with the original recipe.  I halved the recipe, doubled the veggies, chicken, and rice, only added half the egg yolks, halved the roux.  Didn't use any chicken base or celery (didn't have any on hand).  Mine came out supper thick.  I think I see the point of adding pre-cooked rice at the end instead of adding it in the beginning, because it soaked up a lot of the liquid.  This could of also been because I added more rice and the type I used (calrose), but I think some would still be absorbed anyway.  The flavor was very nice.  Can't wait to try this again, except with the original amounts.

I too liked this recipe, although I agree that it is too salty.  Cutting the soup base by at least a third should help.  I also added more lemon juice, checken and rice.  A proven crowd pleaser.

We are soup lovers.... especially during the cold months.  We've got a bunch of regular soup recipes that we rotate.This soup rated at the top and will be added as one of our regulars.  I made the "chicken soup base" from homemade turkey soup.  Used at least 10 cups of broth from chicken bouillon.  Used whole eggs rather than just yolks.  On the side I made carolina enriched rice adding salt and butter to it.  Did as others suggested and added a nice heap of rice to bowl then added soup on top.  Wow!!!!

This is a very good soup if you follow the suggestions posted by the reviewers. I did just that and it made a wonderful meal for my family. I didn't use the soup base, but I did add more rice and chicken. I also used less lemon and seasoned the soup with a lemon pepper blend to round out the flavor. Next time I make this satisfying soup, I will use less egg (4 eggs could work well) and I might add more carrots/celery/onion. Another note, I am used to heating the roux and mirepoix, then adding the stock and heating to a boil (not heating the stock/mirepoix, then adding flour and butter later). This is how I prepared my soup and i had great results!

This is the best recipe I have ever found for Greek Lemon Chicken Soup! Delicious!!! It turned thick and hearty. Perfect! I am very grateful for all the modification tips and tricks. Like most, I only put in 4 egg yolks, sautéed the veggies and rice in evvo, and omitted the soup base for 3 bouillon cubes. I make my own stock for the first time using a whole chicken and spices.

I love this recipe. It came out perfect It's actually the second time I used this recipe. My family loved it so much the first time I made that they've been asking me to make it all summer long. I love and normally make hot soup during Winter Season and love and make chilled soup such as (butternut squash and apple) during the summer; but Im glad I made it despised the hot weather, it was delicious and my family's bellies were contempt. I did however make a small modification. I used corn starch instead of all purpose flour, orzo pasta instead of rice, 3 large Garlic cloves because I didn't have anymore flour, my 2 year old loves orzo pasta and we just love garlic.:0)

I used Better than Boullion low sodium organic chicken broth so it was not too salty at all - also used Real Lemon juice - skipped carrots (didn't have any) used dried chopped onion, some celery salt, orzo cooked in the water before adding the broth and left over chicken - EXCELLENT

I love this soup. I made it one night when my  girlfriend was sick. She loved it. Now it's a staple of our lives when we're ill or feeling down. I only use about four eggs, eight was too much cholesterol in my opinion. Kale makes a really nice addition to this.

Ok. I used only stock and it was sooo good!  I also added a can of sliced green chiles at the end because that's what it seemed like it needed. I'm not sure you could classify it as greek any more. It tasted more like a white chicken tortilla soup. It definitely gave me a new taste to play around with. Thank you!!!

I used 3 tbls soup base as suggested by others. The soup is delicious but needs to be poured over 1/2 rice in the bowl. I didn't add it to the soup because it was such a minimal amount. The soup is too tart with out the rice.  But absolutely delicious with the rice.

Pretty good.  Though I, too, found it too lemony and a bit too salty.  Added more rice and will add more chicken and broth next time as it was too thick for my taste.  Overall, though, pretty good.  Will make again.

Good. I would put less lemon next time, though. It was a bit sour.

EDIT: I went back and gave this 5 stars rather than my original four. This has become such a favorite ... I still stand by my original changes and have found using less lemon everyone enjoys it. Very good on the first tasting and probably better tomorrow (if there is any left - 16 servings? No way!). I can't imagine how salty this would have been with the 6 tbsp of chix soup base. I didn't want to go the expense of "Better than Boullian"(wouldn't use it again) and bought Knorr's chix boullian cubes - one cube was just enough. Added just under 1/2 c. of lemon juice, orzo rather than rice, and 4 egg yollks v. 8 - based on comments of other reviews. As good as any quality Greek restaurants and perhaps better.

This was easy to make vegetarian and also easy to simplify for weeknights.  I made a half batch, used vegetable broth, 1 tablespoon of a vegetarian soup base (but I really think it's optional), skipped the chicken meat and also skipped the slices of lemon.  I reduced the egg yolks from 4 to 3.

YUM! This is a delicious, velvety soup.  I used a rotisserie chicken and followed everyone's advice and only used 4 egg yolks. I also didn't use quite as much lemon juice or the soup base as called for. I did add a clove of garlic. This was so easy and so delicious. I will definately make again!

I loved it! I did use a whole chicken, more vegetables, less chicken soup base, some whole wheat flour and 4 whole eggs instead of just egg yolks. I added oregano, which seemed to be what made the flavor complete. I added brown rice into individual bowls. I'll definitely be making this one over and over!

This was a fantastic soup!  Thick, but not heavy - just delicious.  I only used 6 eggs, and I put uncooked rice and chicken in the pot with some lemon olive oil prior to adding the base and veggies.

Wa easy to make and wonderful! All 16 guests loved it. Substituted bouillion for soup base, as I did not have. It was yummy and simple. Prepared the ingredients in advance to cut down prep time. Sincerely, Soup Girl

I was hoping for a rich, thick soup, but this soup turned out more like a chicken broth with a lemony flavor.  The flavor wasn't quite right compared to other lemon rice soup I have had.  I followed other's suggestions to reduce the soup base and used 3 tbsp and my husband said it needed more salt.  I would have liked it with more of the rice, too.

Just as good as when we had this soup in Athens looking at the Parthenon. I use less margarine than required subsitute lemon juice for fresh and use more chicken soup base for the broth.. its fabulous and just like we had in Greece.. company always love it. Thanks for this taste of Athens. Its a complete meal with nothing or serve a salad first and a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc.

So glad I tried this recipe! It's an excellent way to liven up your basic chicken soup. I did do a some small things differently: instead of using "soup base", I  cooked a whole chicken in water for several hours. Once it was done, I removed the chicken and deboned it, adding all the vegetables and shredded chicken to the broth. I then added a heaping teaspoon of salt, plenty of black pepper, and minced garlic. (All "soup base" consists of is salt, chicken fat, and a few seasonings. So much better to do it naturally.) Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and loved it. The lemon gives it such a perfect kick of flavor!

Delicious!  I followed other reviewer's advice and added half of the soup base.  I added twice the rice, but it made the soup a little thick.  I'd stick with one cup next time.  I also like the soup more lemony, so I add extra lemon juice to my bowl.

So good, fresh and bright. This soup is great, creamy but not heavy, full of flavor and the lemon is just right.  I didn't have broth or base so I just used bouillon, it was perfect.  Thanks!  Now I can get my Greek fix and not have to go out.  Loved it!

Wandered on this by accident and was so excited. Yummy, it was just like the one I love in the restaurants.  Used 4 egg yolks to cut fat a bit but I'm sure it is great with all of them.

So salty, but what could I expect with both chicken base and chicken broth in the recipe? I cut the chicken base down by a third, but it was still too much.  If making it again, I'd use half water/ half low-sodium broth.

I discovered this recipe 2 months ago, and since then have made it 3 times. It has become my favorite soup and I'm beginning to think I always need some of this stored in the fridge to satiate the cravings!!! I have changed a few things, based on what other reviewers have said...the most significant change being that I only use 2tbsp of both the flour and butter to create the roux (sp?), and it is still incredibly thick. Love it!!

This was great! But, I had to change the amounts here and there. I used more like 10 cups of broth and the flour/butter roux really isn't necessary. I also used 3/4 cup lemon juice as well as a full cup of all the veggies and I added fresh chopped garlic. I also used more like 2 cups of shredded white chicken meat. I also added a couple shakes of greek seasoning and completely skipped the chicken base, instead using only one chicken bouillion cube. This is delicious and I will make it again and again!

I loved this soup.  I have had something similiar in my hometown greek restaurant.  The flavours are quite strong--if you don't like lemon, I would reduce the amount of lemon a bit if you prefer a weaker flovour.  My husband also felt it was a little too thick, so next time I will try to thin it out a bit for his sake, but I loved it as is...

Love this recipe.  We've been looking for one that resembles the soup we got at Brother's Restaurant.  I eliminate the soup base.  Also, I double up on onions and remove carrots.  This soup should be all white.

This soup is superb!  Tastes just like Greek Lemon soups that I have eaten in restaurants.  I used bouillon cubes as I didn't have any fresh broth on hand, and omitted the celery as well.  It still tasted great.  I also followed other reviewers advice and added the rice as it was served.  It wouldn't have been a problem though as there were no leftovers. Delish!

What an excellent soup!  This is definitely one you can play around with to taste, too!  Here's what I did different - I took others advice and only used 6 tsp of the Chicken Soup Base - which, by the way, was kind of hard to find!  I had never used it before.  But - finally found it and I'm glad I scaled it down - I might even use 5 tsp next time.  I used boneless thigh meat simply because I love the taste - I think it's got great flavor and it's cheaper! I fried the meat in a little bit of butter and olive oil beforehand which was reeeally yummy.  Also, I took others advice about the Lemon Juice and I think 1/2 cup would have been WAY too much!  I started at 1/4 cup and I think I ended up at 2/4 cup.  I think it's all according to HOW much lemon you like!  I think it's great to garnish with lemon - coz if you like more you can add a little spritz!  I added an extra cup of chicken and rice - guess I like my soup a little chunkier.  Didn't think I was going to use all of the egg yolks, but I ended up using them all and it was FANTASTIC!  Thanks for the great recipe!  I shared this with my mother who is sick and she loved it.  I think I also used a tad bit more Chicken broth than was called for.

Overall, a good recipe. I love chicken soup and this was a nice change. I also altered the recipe: Cut the amt. of lemon juice to 1/4c and added the zest of the lemon; doubled the amt. of chicken; cut the amt. of chicken base to 6 tesapoons, used only 4 yolks and omitted the lemon slices, which seemed like overkill. The recipe makes a thick, rich, unusual but refreshingly different tasting broth and is not at all hard to make.

Since you have to prepare the chicken, rice, a flour/butter mixture separate egg yokes, this is not the quickest recipe but not difficult. Overall I really liked the soup but would add more rice and carrots to make it 'heartier'. It was a bit salty for my taste so I might reduce the boullion a bit.

I didn't have chicken base on hand, so used chicken bouillon granules - this made it too salty, so I added more liquid, more rice and chicken.  I think the lemon makes it seem salty too.  It was very good and I will make it again with the correct chicken base.

What a great recipe! I have had this soup several times a restaurants and was happy to find a great version to make at home. While the flavor was a big hit, I am only scoring it 4 because the prep is a big pain.  Lots of steps, lots of mixing bowls involved. I have made it a few times.  Unlike SOME users, my rating is for the actual recipe. I have made it a few more times with a few tweaks listed below.

Alternative suggestions - 
Orzo instead of rice
Doubling veggies
Lessening or omitting soup base

Made this for dinner tonite and it was so good. Started it in crockpot overnite on low to cook the vegetables and the chicken (which I added cubed and uncooked to the crockpot). After work, I took it out of the fridge and heated the soup on the stove and added the roux and the 4 egg yolks as recommended by many reviewers. I also used only 2.5 tbs chicken boullion granules. I cooked and added orzo instead of rice.

I thought this was an excellent soup! I did only use half the amount of lemon juice and would probably add more chicken and rice next time.

Love this soup! I make a lot of soups but this is my fav. A few changes...I saute the veggies before adding the broth.  I only use 4 egg yokes and make sure the small amount of soup has cooled a bit before adding to the eggs.  I use brown rice (already cooked in bag) and use 1 1/2 Cup of chopped rotisserie chicken from the grocery store.  And,I add a little white wine at the end.  Yum!

Delicious!  I left out the chicken broth and just used the full amount of chicken base called for.  It did not lack of salt whatsoever.  I left everything else the same aside from using only 4 egg yolks.  I can't see how adding more egg yolks could make it any better.  It was heavenly!  My husband loved it as well.

I followed the recipe to a T. I LOVE lemon and I love Greek food. I am THAT person who goes into a restaurant and eats the lemons straight without wincing.

So when I say this was too lemoney, take that how you will.

AMAZING! I just got done cooking this and couldn't wait to finish eating before raving. I even added a photo of it. LoL! This is my first time and the recipe was fantastic (along with some of the suggestions I read in reviews). I went with 6 eggs and added 1/4 more cup of lemon juice (to give it a lil extra zing)...definitely will do this again soon! YUM!

Love this soup...I am eating right now and can't wait for lunchtime at work tomorrow for left overs.  I browned the onions, celery and carrot in a bit of butter first before adding any broth.  I also used orzo instead of rice and put it in at the beginning so it could cook....to cook the orzo,  held a low boil for 8 minutes of the 20 minute simmer and only used 3 eggs.

This was my 1st time making lemon rice soup and it was easy and delicious.  For sure only use 6 tsp. chicken soup base.  Perfect!  I put the lemon slices directly into the pot then served.  I think this made the soup a little too lemony.  I will garnish with the lemon slices next time.

I LOVE this soup. I will definately be making it again. I altered it slightly. I made a half recipe, I was supposed to use 4 egg yolks but I used 3. I did not have ground chicken soup mix but I did have chicken boullion cubes and I used 6. I used brown basmati rice and about a cup of chicken. Served it with dark rye and swiss cheese grilled sandwiches. Great by itself!

I took the advice of other reviewers and cut the egg yolks to 4 and the chicken soup base to 3 T. The consistency of the soup was right on. However, there was a very unpleasant undertaste of some sort that was just terrible and ruined the soup for me. It is difficult to describe, but it must have been the chicken granules because I used good cartons of chicken broth. I couldnt even really eat the soup because of the weird taste and I will not make this recipe again.

I liked this!  Used white rice but would have preferred orzo.  I made the changes suggested - 4 cups broth, 4 cups water.  eliminate soup base, butter and flour and add 1 can cream of chicken soup. 4 egg yolks.  Add 2 tsp Greek spice.  Yummy!

I really wanted to like this, but I couldn't even finish my bowl.  It tasted too egg-y to me even though I did my best to temper it.

Wonderful!!!  Modification: 4 tablespoon of base and only 4 egg yolks.  Great flavor and texture.  Added more chicken for a heartier soup.

Made this for my family with left over Christmas turkey. My daughter introduced me to excellent Greek Lemon Chicken Soup at an authentic Greek restaurant in Chicago so I was very pleased that she found this to be delicious as did the rest of the family!  I only had 7 eggs, but that seemed to be plenty. I will make this again!

This was delicious! It's a wonderful dish with a taste very different from my usual dinners. I was a bit apprehensive about the egg yolk and only added 4. I also garnished each bowl with fresh chopped parsley. My family loved too and I'll definitely be making this again!

This soup is wonderful. I add a little more lemon juice as I like it on the tart side and left out the carrots and celery. Instead of rice I used Orzo pasta which was a nice touch. Super Soup!

Great recipe...I tend to go for chunkier soups so I used 2 chicken breasts that I brined (used the brine in the ultimate BBQ chicken recipe on foodtv.com) and then fried on a skillet.  Brine may not have been necessary, but I had brined chicken breasts stockpiled in the freezer.  Like the previous reviews, I backed off a bit on the egg yolks (used 4 yolks instead of 8).

THANK YOU! I never post reviews, but had to after trying this recipe.  Took the advice of some of the other reviewers and changed it a little bit.  I used 1 cup of all the vegetables, replaced the roux with 1 can cream of chicken soup, only 2 tbs soup base, only 4 egg yolks, 1 cup uncooked orzo instead of rice and 3 boneless skinless chicken breasts.  The magical component, however, was the addition of 2 teaspoons GREEK SPICE (also on this site) from another review - that made it soooo good!  THANK YOU!

Good and thick and creamy. Serving sizes per the recipe would be pretty small, so if you plan to use it as a main dish, you will want to plan on more.

This turned out way too sour for our tastes, but we tempered it with some heavy whipping cream and it was delicious after that.

It was really good lemony flavor, and I followed other reviews and added only half of the chicken soup base, but it was still waaay too salty! Maybe it was the brand I used versus the one used in the recipe, but watch out for it! If I make this again, I would omit it completely and I think the recipe would be 5 stars

I cut this recipe in half and only made a few changes.  I used butter instead of margarine, orzo instead of rice, and turkey instead of chicken. May not be necessary but, I sauted the onion and celery to get rid of the crunch before adding to the soup base. Absolutely loved this recipe. The blending of flavors is perfect.  This will be added to my recipe box as a favorite.  Thank You!

Great recipe!  Pita bread for dipping is a good idea and I added a few dashes of cayenne but I'm a little on the spicy side.

This was fabulous...very hearty..I seared chicken tenders and cooked them with the dish deglazeing the pan before adding water for stock...I agree about adding the rice later though..it does tend to get a bit mushy while sitting..I would say cook the rice in a chicken stock for the same flavor..

Excellent fresh taste.  Love the lemon.  I used homemade turkey broth and turkey (leftover from Thanksgiving).  Didn't add the soup base (too many nasty ingredients in those), used orzo instead of rice, added a touch of oregano and lots of fresh spinach.  I only used 6 egg yolks and omitted the flour and butter and it was plenty thick and rich enough and much more healthy! Whole family loved it.

We ate this as our main course with toasted pita bread---really nice on a cool day.  I added one teaspoon of jarred garlic, skipped the celery. It was creamy and thick and lemony. A little different from my usual chicken soup but I will definitly make it again. I used leftover roasted chicken breasts and homemade chicken broth from my freezer. Since we keep chickens, I always have extra eggs. It was an economical dish for us. Instead of rice I served the soup over Israeli couscous.

I love this soup.  As suggested by other reviewers, I used only 4 egg yolks, less soup base and subsituted a can of cream of chicken soup for the flour and butter. I also used brown rice for more fiber.

Way too salty. Use less chicken base or maybe none. Really good flavor but seriously way too salty, i even read the reviews and used less bouillon.

This was really good!! I made some modifications based on dietary preferences and other user reviews. I don't eat meat so I used firm tofu instead of chicken. I thought it tasted great! I used 5 egg yolks instead of 8, and veggie broth instead of chicken broth. I eliminated the soup base entirely because of the reviews stating how salty it came out. I don't think the recipe suffered! I started the base by doing a sautee of the onions and added a generous amount of garlic in EVOO. After sweating that for a few minutes, I added the rest of the veggies and a 1/2 cup white wine. I let that simmer for a few minutes and then continued as the recipe called. I switched the rice for uncooked Orzo and it came out well. I think next time I will follow another users review and keep the pasta separate so it doesn't get too saturated in the leftovers. Overall this was a great recipe. Everyone who ate it loved it! thanks for sharing!

Everyone in my family loved it.  Even my preschooler.  I used whole wheat pastry flour instead of all purpose and brown rice instead of white.  It tasted just like what we get at our local greek eatery.  I plan to make a double batch next time and freeze some for a rainy day.

I only made this soup to use up some random ingredients but I'm glad I did. I scaled the recipe to 4, used one egg yolk, and cooked the rice in the soup. I eyeballed the amount of lemon, and think I used more than it called for but I really loved the lemon flavour! Would definately make again.

Delicious, wouldn't change a thing, except I dissolved a teaspoon of cornstarch in a bit of the broth after adding the rice and chicken to thicken the soup a little.  After that addition, the consistency is what I was looking for--thick, creamy, and comforting.  Just like what you'd find at the local Greek diner!

I used a low sodium chicken broth, cut the eggs back by half and for health reasons, didn't use the soup base. It was delicious as is and thank you Shelley!

This soup was good, but didn't come anywhere close to the lemon-chicken soup I've had in Greek restaurants in the past.  The only alteration I made was using 4 egg yolks instead of 8.  If I make this soup again I will cut the lemon juice in half - I found the lemon to be overpowering.  I would also add more rice and perhaps more chicken and vegetables as well to give the soup more substance.

Love this recipe! I changed only a few things. I doubled the veggies and added extra lemon juice. I only used 4 tbs of chicken soup base and low sodium broth.

If you use the suggested six tablespoons of chicken soup base in the broth it will be sooo salty you can't eat it. Try using one tblsp and then salt to taste when served. I had to throw my first batch out!

This is the best!  I fell in love with this soup at Steve's Greek Restaurant in Boston, but can't afford to be buying it all the time from them.  This recipe tastes just as good as their soup and is a lot cheaper!  Now I just make a big stockpot full of it every week or two and freeze it so I can enjoy it whenever I crave it.

Made as written, this soup is waaaaay too salty!  Hence the low rating. The higher ratings I've noticed were after the recipe was tweaked, which is very misleading. I'm pretty sure the culprit is the chicken base, which we will either adjust or leave out next time we make it. Since other reviewers report success with using bullion we will try it instead.

LOVED this soup! Just as good as the restaurant version. I did add a bit more chicken and rice, and ended up having to add some more broth and lemon juice at the end because it thickened up quite a bit. Also, used uncooked rice, that probably just added to the thickening. Should have followed the recipe exactly, next time I will! YUMMY!!!

Great soup taste better than this Greek restraunt down the street! I did not use as much soup base as called for but used about 3/4 of the amount called for. Was noot to lemony for my kids or I but my husband said it was a tad bit too lemony so I figured the lemon issue should be adjusted acording to taste! Great recipe!

With a few minor changes, this is the best soup in the universe!  My favorite Greek diner closed down and I was mourning the loss of their soup, when I discovered this recipe.  I do believe that this recipe even tops theirs!  I did cut the soup base in half based on other reviews, and I add a bit more veggies, rice & chicken.  I have made this twice now, and the second time was a double batch so I could freeze some.  Last night after thawing some for dinner, I think I saw a tear in my husband's eye.  He said it's the best soup he's ever tasted.   
p.s. If the egg starts to separate a little upon reheating, just whisk it.

A friend once made a soup similar to this one and I loved it! However, when I tried this, I could barely get past the first bite. It was waaaaay too salty!! I think you may want to rethink this recipe or better yet, try a different recipe.

The recipe made exactly as-is is waaayyy too strong & salty. There must be a typo with the chicken base. I'm thinking maybe it should be 6 TEASPOONS.  I will definitely try this again though because I think it would be really good otherwise.

This was delicious!!! My kids loved it! Used leftover turkey and made it twice in a week. The lemon came out of a bottle and the soup defintely is a step above regular chiken soup. Also, like others said, I put the rice in the bowl and poured the soup over it.

I made this soup for my family and friends and everyone loved it!  After reading some of the reviews, I decided to also added a can of cream of chicken soup to the mixture.  I made enough for 8 servings and I had no left overs.  This is a recipe I will be using a lot!

I used to nanny for a Greek family when I was in highschool and she would make this soup all the time and this is just what it tasted like.  I used a whole chicken for the broth and It was very rich and very good.

This recipe is awsome. I made a few modifications after reading the other's reviews. I didn't have any soup base on hand, so I just used two chicken bullion cubes, I reduced the egg yolks to four, and I used brown rice instead of white. Also, I used a 1/2 a cup of lemon juice. This soup is heavenly, I will definately share this recipe with others!!!!

I found this soup to be excellent, better then I have had in all the Greek restaurants I have been to here in Florida! I rarely follow a recipe exactly and I made some changes. I made my own broth from fresh chicken,(used more then 8 cups water) put more chicken in the soup and added boullion to taste.  I used more lemon, brown rice and 9 eggs, and my yeild was 5 quarts of soup.

I LOVE lemon rice soup- and this one is pretty ok. I thought it tasted a little "eggy" with the 8 yolks so I added more chicken broth and a can of Campbell's Chicken Rice soup along with more rice and chicken- lots more. I also like it very lemony so I adeded some concentrated lemon to the soup and cooked it in a crock pot overnight to bring it to a potluck. Next time I'll take other's advice and add only 4 eggs.

Way too lemmony and salty for my taste.  I ended up adding a lot of water to tone it down.  I added a lot more carrots, rice, and meat to make it heartier.  I also added chopped red potatoes, which turned out great.  If I make it again I'll add less bouillon and lemon juice and see if that helps the overall flavor.

The only reason I am giving 4 stars is because 6 Tbsp of chicken soup base was WAY too salty.  Next time I will reduce to 3 Tbsp.  Lemon juice 1/2 cup was equal to about 4 lemons.  I also only used 3 egg yolks.  This was very good and I will definitely keep this recipe.

My Greek husband loved this. So did I. I used cornstarch instead of flour to thicken it and added uncooked wild rice since I made it in my InstantPot but other than that, I stuck to the recipe as written. I will definitely keep this soup recipe in my rotation. The key is to really froth the eggs before adding. I was surprised how creamy it was after adding the eggs. I made a half batch and added 2 Meyers lemons (we grow our own). It made it plenty lemony. I can’t wait to make another batch!

The family loved it. I bought a rotisserie chicken and cooked in pot, to flavor soup. Took out skin and bones, chopped up chicken and added to soup. Did not use chix base, due to sodium. Added oregano as a greek spice. Cooked rice separate, to keep from getting mushy.  Placed rice in a bowl and ladled soup on top.

Perfect recipe. I doubled it.  Made typical stock from the rotisserie chicken carcass adding lemon ends and ginger.  Strained it and used it for the base. I forgot the flour and butter rue, but I’m fine with that because I want it more soupy than thick.  There was a little bitterness from using the lemon ends in the stock, but I added about 2 Tbl of butter to smooth it out.  Wanted to use thyme. Didn’t have any.  Used a pinch of Italian seasoning instead.

Made this for the first time.  I used creamy chicken soup instead of the margarine/flour/chicken base, orzo instead of rice, and 4 egg yolks. It turned out wonderful.  I might try using the full 8 yolks some day but the soup didn’t seem to be lacking.

I used the entire egg and blended them with hot broth in the vitamix.... super creamy and I didn’t feel wasteful for only using the yolks. I cooked the rice in the broth as well

this soup was amazing! My daughter is allergic to eggs, so I had to use chickpea flour as a substitute for eggs, and it still turned out great. Made this when everyone in my home was sick with a cold and they all loved it!

I halved this recipe and left out the flour/butter add in. I used day old rice from a casserole last night. The soup was very thick and super tasty! I'll add more broth tomorrow night. It's a keeper!

I have made this recipe for years, and it’s comforting and delicious and one of my most requested recipes. You can feel free to cut the number of egg yolks for a lighter soup, and I never use the full amount of soup base.

I cooked the rice in the broth and that thickened the soup so that I didn't need the flour and butter. Used 1/4 cup lemon and only 3 eggs.  Lovely creamy soup.

I had my own recipe for this and I add a full container of grated Parmesan cheese at the end just enough to heat it up and it helps bond the rice and egg but the slices of lemon for garnish made the soup too bitter so the next time I made this I didn’t add the slices of lemon.

I loved this soup!!!!! I will make it over and over again! I did make changes after reading some of the reviews. I only used 6 teaspoons of bouillon base and 4 egg yolks. I did add 2 cups of additional water and I like lemon so I added lemon zest. It did turn out a with a distinct lemon flavor and some may interpret that as too salty but I loved it!!

So! I made this soup again! I did make changes to try and lighten it up some and it turned out just as tasty!! This time I doubled the amount of chicken broth, used 6 tsp of soup base, added more chicken and vegetables, zested a whole lemon, used 2 tbsp of butter and 1/8 c of rice flour, and 2 tempered egg yolks. It turned out phenomenal! I love the lemon flavor but next time I may only zest half a lemon.  If you reduce the flour, butter, and egg yolk the soup is not as thick as the original recipe but just as flavorful. I love this soup! This is what I crave when I want Greek lemon chicken soup!

I  make a  good chicken soup.  Then I found this.  Where has it been my whole life.  My husband said,  put it in the Book. ( I have created my own cook book of just things we like!)  Such great flavor.  I used one of the grocery store roasted chickens.  Wonderful!

The only changes I made were to not dice my vegetables quite so small, and I also used less egg yolks, just because I don’t like my soup so thick. This is my go-to soup when I’m not feeling well, and decided I needed to learn to make it myself instead of always ordering in. My whole family enjoyed it, including my picky husband!

My Go to. Added Baby spinach and chopped water chestnuts for a little crunch. We like ours lemony so we used about a half cup of lemon concentrate. Yummy

I used to make a simple version of Greek Lemon Soup. This is an awesome recipe! I am happy I checked the comment section before I dove into making this because of the salty nature of this soup. I used only 4 (large eggs) I will use more in the future but if I do, I would leave out the chicken breast.
   I will always "taste as I go" when I make this and I added egg whites to the soup because I love stringing egg whites into broth! So good! I added the egg yolks at the end. If I make this for company, I will have to make a bigger batch. My husband and I stopped after two big bowls and I wanted more. You get 5 Stars for this and I will make it again OFTEN as my new version!

This was the perfect soup for our sick family. I made a roasted jalapeño paste to garnish the soup with which also helped to clear our sinuses. The soup was very flavorful and we can’t taste anything b/c of our sinus infection but the lemon really helped. Highly recommend!!!

Made it to bring to a church soup pot lock.  It was the only soup that completely disappeared!  I will make it again.  It was wonderful.  Used the lemons from my trees.

Made it as the recipe stated and turned out awesome. The only change was to use a blender when adding the yolks to make it frothy, a tip from another reviewer and it turned out perfect. We add the rice per bowl so it stays like soup and keeps in the fridge for days, not that it ever does.

Delicious soup! I will absolutely use this recipe again. I happened to have turkey drippings available and used those in place of chicken concentrate. Worked very well!

It’s definitely pretty lemony but I feel like it needed some salt so I added some pink Himalayan salt it seem to help a little bit. But I don’t know why my soup looks more like egg drop soup then what I see in other people’s pictures.

It was good. I followed the recipe exactly, except that I added a little fresh chopped parsley at the end for color. I found it more sour tasting than lemony but maybe my lemons weren't the best (?) Also it was pretty salty for me but I tend to be sensitive to salt.

We’ve made this recipe twice now, both times with amazingly yummy results.  I know it’s seems contradictory to now state my changes but they’re only minor ones to me.  We omit celery, and double the amount of chicken.  Comes out perfect!  Opa!

I made this and I thought it was awesome! I did double the rice and the chicken so it is a bit more filling.  I will definitely make this again!

The broth was perfect! I didn't want to spend the money on chicken base so I used 4 chicken cubes. I tasted it after adding cubes before proceeding with the recipe and it was just right. I would advise against only simmering for the first 20 minutes because my veggies weren't cooked thoroughly. I'd probably low boil it until adding the flower mixture. All in all, it was a good soup

The first time I had this soup I was @ my mother's assisted living facility. I loved it so much I had to make it for myself. I made it as per the recipe  with the exception of using wild rice in lieu of the white & added 2 T minced garlic. I will definitely be making again.

Have made as published and with slight variations.

Love it, just as published.

If I am in a rush and do not have cooked rice or if making it for just the two of us, I substitute orzo.  The texture is different, but if anything we like it a tad better -- even if not authentic.

Tonight I had a few fresh mushrooms getting a tad old.  Happens when cooking for just two.  They worked well, also, sliced thinly.

We loved the soup!  I did make a couple changes based on other reviewers and my own ideas. I used chicken pieces for the broth to get more of a bone broth. I cut the egg amount in half and sautéed the veggies and then added the butter and flour directly into the veggies.  I used brown rice instead of white. Excellent results!

i reduced the servings to 6.  i cooked the celery, onion and carrot (after shredding them finely in food processor) in 3 c. reduced salt chicken broth.  i added 1 heaping T.  chicken base.  simmered for the 20 mins.  i put the veggies in food processor along with  about 1 c. of the cooked broth.  i made up a roux of 2 T melted butter with 2 T flour and added that to the broth left in the pot.  mixed with whisk.  i mixed the 3 yolks with about 4 T lemon juice.  i added a bit of the hot, thickened broth to temper the yolks.  as another reviewer suggested, i slowly added the yolk/lemon mixture to the veggies and broth in the food processor and processed.  turns a lovely colour and frothy.  then that went back into the pot.  i added the chopped chicken, 1/4 c. rice and the zest of 1 lemon.   excellent!

This was my first time making this soup and it came out great if II do say so myself :)

Since I am cooking for one, I halved this recipe  with no problem. 

I also followed suggestions from others and:
 - Used rotisserie chicken cut up 
 - Used cooked brown rice 
 - Sautéed the veggies before adding to broth (sans celery since I didn't have any on hand)
 - Used "Better than Bouillon" Low Sodium Chicken base to make the broth 
 - Squeezed a whole lemon and added extra chicken (because I wanted it meatier and more lemony) 
 - Used 2T of butter and flour for the roux
 - Used 2 egg yolks

The favor and consistency were spot on - would def make this again!

Made exactly by the recipe.  Everyone loved it kids included! It may replace chicken noodle soup at our house.

Easy to follow recipe   My first attempt at incorporating egg yokes.  This recipe is a keeper.   Lived all my life in Chicago and have had this soup hundreds of times in all the Greek diners and restaurants  around the city.  Brings me back to those times.

Excellent flavored soup. I took the advice of the others an only added 4 egg yolks.  It may be a bit salty for others, but it was spot on for me.

Very creamy and rich.  Cut the egg yolk in 1/2.  
My husband would like to have this as a regular meal  which means every 4 to 8 weeks.

This soup is really yummy! I halved the recipe to make it for two people but kept the amount of chicken, rice and vegetables the same as the original recipe. I think the portions are off because it didn't make 8 servings (half of the original recipe's 16). It only made about 4 servings. I left out the tbsps of chicken soup base completely and just added salt to taste. Also, in step 2 I believe you're supposed to make a roux but it doesn't explain that very well. For that I just melted the butter at medium heat in a sauce pan, added the flour when the butter was all melted, whisked the flour and butter together for about a minute, until it smelled nutty then added it to the soup slowly like the directions say.

I found this soup so very salty, so salty there wasn't anything I could do to fix it, and it was not able to be eaten.  In retrospect, I should have known 6 Tablespoons of chicken base would be way too salty.

Oh my goodness this was TOO SALTY. Ask anyone in my family and they will tell you I'm a salt fanatic, so for me to say it was too salty means it made my husband almost gag. I used low sodium chicken broth and low sodium chicken base and it was STILL super salty. Maybe with less of the chicken base it would be better? (I used 6 TBS Better Than Bouillon Low Sodium Chicken Base.) Also a bit too strong of a lemon flavor. Disappointed.

Delicious. I quadrupled the recipe, however, only used 9 yolks as I didn't want it to be overbearing. Great dish for left over white rice and chicken. Threw in some Turkish oregano and extra lemon juice upon serving.  Fantastic!!

It was delicious and I got rave reviews! I did not add the chicken soup base, and I made a roux in another pot using butter and flour because I wasn't sure how to "blend the butter and flour".

it was wonderful but I only made half and used orzo instead of rice. I also adjusted the salt content and only used 1T butter and 1T flour. No chicken meat as is our preference.

I really enjoy this soup for something different.  To make it more like my favorite local restaurant's version, I shredded/macerated the celery, onions, and carrots using an electric handi-chopper (small food processor).  Per the recommendations of other reviewers, I used only 4 egg yolks.  I also skipped the lemon slices at the end.  The result was very close to the restaurant version I love.  I paired this soup with the Syrian Bread recipe found on this website for a nice meal.

I absolutely love this soup and have made it several times now. I'm getting ready to make it again tonight.  I cut down the number of egg yolks to make it more acceptable to our dietary practices.  Also I keep the rice separate; I like to make a rice form in each bowl and ladle the soup around it. It's just delicious. Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Do not precook rice, add olive oil to pan – cook chopped onion, carrots, celery and rice for about 10 min. then add broth, lemon juice, ½ C white wine and 1 can creamed chicken soup*  instead of butter and flour. Most people use 4 egg yolks, add 2 teas. Greek seasoning (*or cook 1 whole chicken and don't use cream chicken soup)

We've been making this recipe for about 8 years now.  The original is intensely salty.  We use low sodium broth and add only 3 tablespoons of base.  We shred up a rotisserie chicken so it's moist (add it last few minutes), which also adds some salt in replacement of the higher dose of base.  We also add garlic, use sliced carrots instead of shreds, and use orzo instead of rice.  Also butter instead of margarine.  It's absolutely amazing!!!  I'm experimenting with a gluten free version tomorrow  ??

I made a few changes but am still giving this a 5 because I would have been lost without the base recipe.  The two major ones were to cut the egg yolks (I halved the recipe so I used 3 instead of four).  I only used one heaping tbs of bullion and two shakes of a Greek seasoning.  I used the juice of one lemon and leftover chicken from chicken slouvalaki.  Oh!  And while I was blending the egg yolks I also added some of the chicken, then slowly added in a little of the hot soup.  I slowly returned to the soup and did not end up with scrambled egg soup.

Great recipe,  My family  prefers a heavier lemon taste  so I just simply  used one whole lemon  and added the grated zest as well. We also prefer  a hearty  soup so I doubled the rice.

This soup is great!  I did have to make a few changes, however, and it turned out perfectly.  I can't wait to make this all the time.  It's so easy!

First, I doubled the recipe.  We are big soup eaters in our house, so I'm definitely glad I did that. Second, I didn't have celery in the house, so I added a little more carrots and onions and used celery salt to season it, along with some oregano, salt and pepper.  Third, I cooked the vegetables in a stick of butter until translucent, and then added the flour, creating a roux.  Then I added homemade chicken stock, so there was no need for the chicken base.  Lastly, I added 6 egg yolks, and this was perfectly fine for me.  8 in the original recipe seems really excessive.  I also followed the advice of one other cook, and cooked the rice separately in chicken stock and added it to the bowl with some grilled chicken right before serving.  WOW. So good.

This is awesome soup but that being said it doesn't say what chicken base was used. I use the better than bouillon base and 2 heaping Tablespoon is perfect. If using this base 6 will be uneatable. I also used chicken stock instead of broth. Added extra chicken and rice because my husband loves extra in. The lemon is perfect i used bottle lemon juice. This would be wonderful with pita bread. However when i make again with pita bread i might make it a little thicker. Its plenty creamy as is but we like extra thick when dipping with bread :) Also i used a rotisserie chicken the savory flavor.

Hi!

This was slammin', but I did mess with it:

Sweat garlic, onion, celery in about 1/2 stick of butter;
added flour directly to it to make roux;
de-glazed with a little white wine;
only added 1tbsp of 'Better than Bouillon' chicken soup base; added only 4 egg yolks; hit it with a little oregano. I wouldn't add uncooked rice to this while it simmers, unless you want all of the liquid to be absorbed by the rice. It's best to cook rice separately and chop up a rotisserie chicken on the side.

I quartered the recipe, because I thought it would just be for me, but it was soo good, even my three year old enjoyed it! I did omit celery because I was out, but it was still very tasty!

Love this soup! Tastes just like what I get at my favorite Greek restaurant.  Followed tips from other reviews. Used low sodium chicken broth, only 2 tablespoons of chicken soup base,  and added 2 teaspoons Greek seasoning to first simmer. 

Blended yolks in food processor until light yellow, then SLOWLY added 1/2 cup hot broth into food processor while running and kept blending until frothy. Added the mixture slowly back to the rest of the broth. Delicious!

Second time we made it, reduced the soup base to 3 TBS and it was much better. I think I'll try and cook the soup longer than 20 minutes next time so that the veggies are a bit softer. One of my daughter's favorite dinners!

This might be one of the best things I have ever made.  It is so light and the flavor was delicate and just perfect.  Easy to make - I made sure to cut the celery and onion very thin since it was only going to cook in the broth (get good broth or use homemade).  Don't skimp on the egg yolks or the lemon juice.  I did use orzo instead of rice (personal preference).  I could not get enough of this.  I just ate the last bowl for lunch and I'm seriously sad.  I will be making this often - it can be a year round soup since it's really not too heavy.

I made this following the recipe.  Both my husband and I were delighted with it.  He never adds salt to any food and noticed the salt but didn't think it was over the top.   I thought it was fine and we both loved the amount of lemon in it.  A winner that I will make again.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe.
It had a few techniques that I wasn't too comfortable with (the rue, and the egg yolks) but it was easy to follow and came out wonderfully.

I did make a few modifications:
I added some olive oil to the pan (+/- 1 tbs) to start and then cooked the onions, celery, and carrots for about 5 minutes.  I also used about a cup of each (instead of the 1/2 cup).
I used only 3 tbs of the soup base and then tasted it to see if more was needed.
I used 6 yolks instead of the 8.
I also made it with whole wheat orzo instead of the rice.  I added the orzo just prior to adding the yolk mixture and then cooked for an additional 10-15 minutes to make sure the orzo was done.

I will definitely be making this soup again, I loved it!

Delicious!  I decreased the servings to 12 and it made about 6 bowls of soup.  Not troughs, LOL, but regular Fiesta cereal/soup bowls.  The amount was actually perfect for our family.  :)

The decreased recipe called for 6 egg yolks and I cut it to 4 since that is all I happened to have and others had noted that they decreased it with no problems.  I also didn't use the chicken soup base - I just prefer using real ingredients.  Those who have complained about the soup being too salty may find that it is the soup base that is so salty.

The "best" part - we had pink lemon(ade) soup!  The only carrots I had were the red carrots and, as I suspected, they turned the liquid strangely pink.  Once the egg yolks were added, though, the color was much more muted.  LOL

This recipe is definitely a keeper!

wonderful taste and very hearty ~ a full meal.  I followed this exactly and found it was just a little too thick so might reduce the flour next time.  Just the right amount of lemon.  Somewhat labor intensive with several steps so allow enough time.  Quantity is more like 10 servings not 16.  Loved this!

I have made this soup several times now.  The first time I followed the recipe exact and the amount of soup starter was too much.  I now make this once a week for my family.  I do add the 8 eggs but I add 3 full eggs and 5 yokes.  I feel bad throwing all that good egg away! I temper the eggs just a bit...they somewhat scramble when I add to the pot and my family loves it that way.  It makes it more stew like.  I also now use Orzo pasta and add that at the end.  Delicious!

We really love this soup and I've made it many times but didn't give it a full five stars as I make a few changes.  I reduce the soup base to 3 tablespoons and also reduce the amount of egg yolks to 4.  I cook the onion/celery mix for a few minutes before adding the broth and soup base.  For the chicken, I usually buy a rotisserie chicken and shred the breasts and put it in the soup and generally skip using any rice or pasta.

The consistency was great and the flavor was good, but the whole family agreed that the lemon was a little overwhelming.  What we've had in restaurants has had just a hint of lemon.  Will try cutting that in half next time.  I also used a half cup of orzo pasta instead of rice.

Oh mah gawd! This is my favorite soup of all time. My family loves it, too. I add more chicken, onion, carrot, and celery to bulk it up a bit. Also, I serve rice on the side so that the rice doesn't absorb all the yummy broth. Do not be afraid of 8 egg yolks!! It is amazingly scrumptious. Less if very good too, but using all 8 is VERY CREAMY AND DELISH. Make this soup tonight and have a happy belly a little while later!

Made this as is.  This recipe as it is written is too salty and doesn't have enough of the carrots, celery, rice and chicken in my opinion.  It also doesn't mention the specifics of how to add the egg yolk. 

Is it a good START as a recipe? Yes it is.  Cooks who are familiar with this soup and know what it should taste like, will just need to adjust it for their own tastes and requirements though.  Others not familiar with it will need to do the same although this is normally a "lemony" soup so people complaining of its "lemony-ness" probably should do a different soup entirely.  Also the lemon tends to highen the saltiness slightly.

For changes, read other people's reviews.

I loved this soup.  I, too, reduced the chicken base (I used Caldo de Pollo) to 4 Tbs and the egg yolks to 4.  I added two large grilled, chopped chicken breasts and two cups of prepared white rice.  I wish there was more broth, so I might modify the amount and the roux as well, to retain the viscosity.  Yummy, yummy.

After reading reviews I also, cut back to 6 yolks and on the soup base and used the juices from my baked chicken instead, added more rice, we like it more hearty and unlike others, I added more pepper and lemon, my big fat Greek family loves lemon! Not my Mother's Avgolemono but it passed!

This might be my favorite soup recipe. I have made it many times and sometimes I don't have fresh lemon juice, but bottled juice doesn't seem to change it much. Also, I only use 4 egg yolks & it is definitely rich enough for me. This tastes just as good as any soup you would get in a greek restaurant!

Excellent recipe !  I rarely make soup but I definitely will with this one.  Followed the advice of reviewers and reduced the egg yolks to 4.  I did add other seasonings though just to be a little creative.  I added Herb de Provence, Dill, Tarragon and a little Thyme.  This is the type of recipe where anything goes.   Thank you for this delicious recipe.

way too salty..I even put a raw potato to suck up the salt and it didnt work. We were drinking water all night. I think the chicken base combined with the chicken broth was too much. Don't know how I would try to fix, maybe try another recipe. I was dissapointed it was our "Greek" menu month. I should have read the other reviews instead of looking at just the stars.

This soup is fantastic. We used 4 bullion cubes instead of the soup base and orzo instead of rice. Mixing the butter and flour before adding them to the broth made the texture perfectly silky.

I really liked this recipe a lot. It seemed really easy to me. I used REAL lemon. If you're going to follow the measurements for lemon juice in any recipe you should use real lemon unless it says otherwise. The concentration is different. Also instead of using the soup base (I didn't have any) I used the leftover juice from my chicken because I cooked it in a crockpot. I added some greek seasoning to taste, I did not add any extra salt. I never add extra salt when using broths and greek seasoning as these are already salty enough. I also did not add vegetables. I cooked them separately and served them on the side. It was AMAZING. I'm about to eat leftovers and I never eat leftovers!

I browned the carrots, onion and celery with a little vegetable oil before adding the broth. I only used two tablespoons of the chicken base. I cooked two cups of cubed chicken in the soup. I used 5 egg yolks.

What a tummy warming soup! I did use egg beaters instead of real eggs, Used orzo that I cooked in the broth & Shredded boneless chicken thighs.
Simply fabulous.

Wonderful!  I had just made a pot of fresh broth, and just used that.  I used orzo, instead of rice, because that's what I remember when I ate this as a kid.

I was looking for something to make with fresh lemons from my lemon tree.  I had never heard of this, and it sounded good.  Made the recipe as instructed (except I didn't have celery).  My family loved it.  Only request was more rice.  I will make this again. Delish!

Turned out great. Added garlic and subbed cod for the chicken. Roasted the lemons before adding at the end with rice.

I did not care for this recipe. It was extremely salty and I should have read reviews first because 6 TBS of chicken base is too much. I tried to save the soup by adding like a 1/2 gallon of milk and it was still pretty salty, but at least edible.

This was a great and easy recipe! Upon reading others reviews, I added 1 cup of carrots and 1 1/2 cups of rice, and a tsp of minced garlic.  I served this with homemade pita bread, my husband and kids loved it.

love this recipe! Hubs loves it too. I used one chicken cube bullion in place of the base, because it's what I had. I followed a few other comments about cutting the egg yolks down to 4. I thought it tasted just fine. Oh and I used a box of the chicken broth, I think it was the 48oz, and added 2c water, so I don't think it was too salty at all.

I just finished making this and I was VERY excited to make it because I love lemon. Plus there is a Greek Restaurant near by and I wanted to replicate the soup. It was WAY TOO LEMONY and SALTY and I love lemon and salt. Somewhat disappointed, not sure what to do next.

Very good recipe!!    I did make a couple of changes though, I added 2 chicken breasts pre-cooked and 3/4 cup of uncooked rice at the beginning so they would get the flavour cooked threw it. I also added about 1/8 cup less lemon juice.    I will be making this again thanks to a wonderful and very easy to follow recipe!

Definitely a keeper. It was awesome. It turned out less soupy but not quite stew either. I ladled the cooked rice into th bowl first, as directed. I also didn't think the lemon slices on top was necessary because I wasn't presenting the soup to guest.

This was an absolutely yummy soup. A rendition of chicken rice soup, but better. I highly recommend not keeping  lemons in for too long, as they make the soup bitter from the rind. I added 1 tsp. of Greek seasoning as others suggested and it gave it a nice kick. Also used instant rice to have it sooner. I will make this again, and again.

Really enjoyed this soup! Even my kids, ages 10 and 12, liked it.  I cut the recipe in half thinking 16 serving was going to be too much, but it just made 4 bowls of soup.  Next time I won't half it. I scooped the rice in the soup bowls first and then added the soup.  I also doubled the veggies and chicken and reduced the yolks to two (I halved the recipe).  I also used only half of the amount of chicken soup base (bouillon). Make sure you use low sodium chicken broth. Yummy!

AWESOME!!!!!! My husband was very skeptical when I told him what was for supper the night I made this! This was so good!!! It has been added to my recipe box and will be a permanent addition. I thought it had a perfect blend of salt and a great lemon flavor without being overwhelming. Definitely make pita bread to go with it for dipping! If I would change anything, I may add a bit more rice and I might even double the chicken.

This is better than the soup we get at an authentic greek restaurant we go to in a city with a large greek population!  My husband absolutely loved it; it was very lemony flavored but we really liked the flavor  If you prefer less lemon just add less lemon  I did use greek roasted lemon chicken to add to it which itself was delicious too  and I added more rice to thicken the soup a bit

I did what a couple reviewers suggested and used fresh chicken stock as well as just a couple tablespoons of the bouillion but it was still gross.  It wasn't the saltiness I had a problem with, it was the lemon juice.  I did not put in the whole amount at first so i could taste and then add the rest.  Even putting in the little bit that I did made this soup sour and very unpleasant.  Not sure why anyone considers sour soup to be good but to each his own.  The eggs added nothing good either and when I took the soup out of the fridge the next day it has some sort of froth on the top that was very unappetizing and stinky.  I am very careful with my food so I know it wasn't bad, just stinky.  I will steer clear of any soups with lemon juice or egg yolks.  I do have a recipe for baked greek chicken that calls for lemon juice and it is wonderful.  But I will leave the soup recipe out of my cookbook.

Yummy! This was delish!  I am adding this recipe to my favorites.  The changes I made are as follows I used only 1 1/2 Tablespoons of chicken base, and this was plenty. (I made this a couple of years ago with 6 Tblsp and it was waaay to much!) I used 6 eggyolks, but should have used 8 because we had to thicken it up with cornstarch a bit.  Five of us licked the pot clean!

We really liked this.  I used a red onion because I was out of white, but I doubt that made a difference; I also used low-sodium broth and reduced-sodium chicken base, and can't imagine doing it any other way as the results were plenty salty.  (I was actually a bit concerned about the salt level after the first tasting, but in the finished soup, the egg yolks and the lemon juice go a long way toward mellowing out the saltiness.)  The lemon and the chicken, combined with the egg yolks, make for a hearty but somehow light meal.  I know other people complained about it being too thick, but that wasn't a problem for us; maybe because my egg yolks were on the small side.  The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the chicken base, which was definitely a dominating flavor.  It was by no means a bad thing, but I'd love to find a recipe that resulted the same depth of flavor without resorting to using such large quantities of such a processed ingredient.  I'm not above using a bouillon cube or two, but six tablespoons was almost 2/3 of the jar I used, and . . . it just seemed like a lot.

Decided to make this as a main meal for dinner last night. I was hoping there would be chicken soup base in the cupboard but there wasn't so just left it out :-) I think you need to have the base to thicken it up a little. When I make it again I will double the vegetables and the chicken, and might cut down on the lemon juice. It turned out alright but think It will be better second time round.

I have to change my review a big. It was SUPER salty, so I cut the soup base down by half the next time. Also, to say this makes 16 servings. Um, maybe as a starter, but not for a meal. It might make 10. We added some milk and a bit of sugar to cut the lemon, and will cut the lemon juice down the next time. Overall, this was great....just taste a lot as you go.

WHOA - Lemony... I need to tone this down some before I can give this five stars... it has definite potential... it's just potent and not what I was looking for.

I really wanted to like this soup, but it didn't do much for me. I only made a half batch, since it's just me and the hubby. I don't know that I would make this again.  I did not, however, find it too salty or too lemony, but I did find the directions a bit vague.

Absolutely LOVE this recipe.  If you want a cozy dish on a crisp fall day or cold winter night this is it.  Just like you get at the best Greek restaurants!  This has been a meal for my family and a starter dish for gatherings.

I had to do a lot to make this recipe not as salty and lemony! But with tweaking it tastes like restaurant quality. I use Orzo instead of rice. I cut back the soup base to about 2tbsp and the lemon I add as I simmer for taste. Otherwise this is a family favorite!

Don't get me wrong, it is completely edible, filling and tasty in its' own right.  But this is restaurant style and I was comparing to traditional Avgolemono Soup- I think I just prefer it when it comes to Greek styled food.

Excellent, restaurant quality.  I did make a few changes as suggested.  I used low sodium broth, I used 3 chicken bouillon cubes and only 6 egg yolks.

This was yummy.  I used organic chicken broth and organic chicken soup base.  Neither contains an excess of salt and the soup turned out just right. I skipped the rice and added extra chicken and veggies.

I loved this soup!  Based on the reviews posted here I used 6 egg yolks instead of 8, and used low sodium chicken broth.  I didn't think it was too salty at all.  Next time I'll double the amount of rice.  I wonder if the person who said there was too much rice cooked one cup of rice instead of adding a cup of already cooked rice.

Trying to use up some lemons I was given, I remembered having a lemon soup at a Greek restaurant that I liked.  Was pleasantly surprised when this tasted just like it!  The only thing I beg to differ with is the "16 servings"... because of the great taste, this recipe only served about 6 because of my Chinese "kids" who love to eat "American" food!  It was all gone before I knew it!  They actually think I am a good cook...  Ha!Ha!  (Thanks allrecipes.com!)  So much for leftovers!  Sad because I didn't get seconds but happy because it was such a hit!

This soup is wonderful,except next time I make it I will cut down on the chicken soup base -- it seemed a bit salty -- I added some light, low sodium chicken broth to cut the salty taste and it was much better.

At first bite I was dissapointed!... I think the major mistakes were my own fault so didn't want to give a low rating!..  I did follow other reviewers suggestions and cut back the egg yolks and chicken base... I didn't use fresh lemon juice, I used the little plastic lemon stuff (my fault)...  I couldn't taste the chicken broth at all!... Too acidic!... It also had a weird preserative flavor!  I took quite a bit of time to make this and I was hoping for a wonderful meal; I really wanted to love it!  I am not finished, I will try it again with real fresh squeezed lemon juice and maybe cut it back a little.  Everything else was good.  The consistency was perfect.  I added 1/2 cup uncooked rice while cooking the vegetables; the rice overcooked some, probably why the recipe called for cooked rice.  Presentation was lovely!

Wow. I made this recipe exactly as written and the result was wonderfully lemony and flavorful. I served it with whole wheat pita but I think a crusty bread would be the perfect compliment.

I cut the egg yolks down to 4 and it was just fine. You can cook the rice with the celery, carrots, broth, etc. It doesn't have to be pre-cooked. Good taste. Just like the restaurant down the street!

I'm not sure where I went wrong on this recipe...  It didn't turn out awful, but definitely NOT what I was expecting!  I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of decreasing the soup base, and using orzo instead of rice.  After 3 bites I couldn't eat any more- WAY too much lemon!!!  My husband asked what I put in the soup, and when I told him 1/2 cup of lemon juice he started laughing - I double checked all the ingredients and directions to see if I made a mistake, and I followed it exactly.  At first I considered trying it again with 1/2 the lemon juice, but after cleaning up dinner am so sick of it that I don't think I will.  I guess I was expecting it to be similar to a greek restaurant soup that I really love that had a hint of lemon, but this is definitely LEMON Chicken soup!

I liked this.  I go to Daphe's Greek restaurant here in S. CA and this is the closest recipe I have found.  To make it even easier, I used 4 cans chicken broth, 2 cans water, 1 can cream of chicken, 2 tsp. chicken broth seasoning, and instant rice.  I also added parsley and a small amount of green onions for color.  Thanks for posting.

Yum! I took another reviewer's advice and sauteed the veggies and uncooked rice with some garlic. I used Better than Boullion, and put the whole amount called for in... SO RICH with that fresh lemon juice!

This is absolutely my favorite soup ever! I've been making it for over 10 years now! I prefer orzo pasta to rice. I have used fresh chicken and canned chicken and both are great. I usually use only 5 egg yolks and 2 tablespoons chicken bouillon as the chicken soup base.  So very very very good!

Holy smakerals, is this soup salty!  Maybe it was the brand of soup base I used, since not everyone is complaining about the same thing.  Using the same brand, I would probably use 6 teaspoons instead of tablespoons.  I really love this kind of soup, and I might be willing to give it another try with less soup base, but as it is, I've eaten salt that was less salty than this soup!

I really  like this recipe. Quite a unique flavor. Family members who weren't familiar w/this soup found it to be salty. This could be controlled by the chicken stock you use. I did use some of KIMALA's suggestions and had great results, thanx. I'll use this again.

Really yummy and filling but still not thick or heavy.  I added a little grated lemon zest to the broth to make it even more lemony (personal taste) and it was great!

I was looking for something to remind me of the soup that a first generation greek family made for me once, and this is close. I made this as stated except I used egg beaters instead of eggs. I recommend using regular eggs for better egg strands in the soup. The reason it didn't get 5 stars is that my boyfriend complained that it wasn't nearly as good if it wasn't eaten hot. I ate mine too fast to notice so I don't know!

This was delicious.  I didn't have any carrots on hand, and I used little pasta stars instead of rice (threw them into the pot 5 minutes after the soup came to a boil).  I also used my leftover Thanksgiving turkey in place of the chicken, which was fine.  I added a bit more lemon too.  It was excellent - definitely a nice change of pace from your regular old run-of-the-mill chicken soup.

This was not what I expected - it was way too salty.  I think maybe too much soup base was called for.

This soup is refreshing and easy to make. A real winner in my book. I used chicken boulion cubes instead of soup base and they worked perfectly. I sort of crumbled them into the broth once it was already hot and they melted right in. With colds going around this time of year I think all the Vitamin C in the lemon is a good kick to the immune system.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  It was WAY too salty.  I recommend reducing the soup base to 3 or 4 tablespoons instead of six.  Otherwise, the soup would have been perfect!

Great recipe!  I made it for my partner when he had a cold and he gobbled it up!  He was not even feeling hungry until I put it in front of him.  Great taste and different than what we were used to with chicken soup!  I followed the directions completely.

Everyone loved the soup at our Greek Christmas dinner!  My husband was skeptical, but has asked me to make it again.
