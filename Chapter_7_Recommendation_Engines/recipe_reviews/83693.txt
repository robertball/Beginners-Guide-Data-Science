Delicious, even if I did forget the cheese lol!  I cut back quite a bit on the half and half as well and it was plenty creamy.  Yum on the bacon!

This tasted pretty good and it was a very hearty soup.  It may be a personal preference but it seemed pretty thin so I turned to my old standby to thicken it up.  Added 2 tbsp cornstarch dissolved in water and added to pot.

Like another reviewer said, I added cajun seasoning to taste. It was fantastic. This will definitely be in my soup rotation form now on.  i liked that the soup was thin like a soup and not thick like a chowder or bisque.  i may try to add some corn starch to see i like it even better.

I followed the recipe with two exceptions; thanks to other reviewers’ suggestions, I added some Tony Chachere’s Creole seasoning- 1tbsp while sautéing the onions, peppers, and garlic, and another 1tbsp when I added the crawfish. I also didn’t have carrots, so those were omitted. It was so delicious! The bacon really brought out the flavor in the crawfish. Definitely will be making this again!

I love this recipe. I've made it twice now, the first time using crawfish and the second using shrimp. I also use an orange pepper instead of green, and I add cajun seasoning.

We absolutely loved this!   Only gave it 4 stars because I used a little more potato and used a water/corn starch mix to thicken it up as it was a little thin for us.  Other than that, we'd not change a thing.

I made this recipe last night for my holiday party.  It was an absolute hit.  People that do not even eat crawfish were in love with it.  I sautéed my veggies in bacon grease, no bacon added.  I also added Cajun seasoning.  I only had a pint of half and half, and finally I used Mexican shredded cheese.  Try it, you will not be dissatisfied.

Oh my goodness it's so good! Next time I will do a little less carrots and chop my celery up smaller. I added cajun seasoning, garlic powder, and onion powder. I love it!

we had a few cold windy nights, so I made this for dinner.  It was good, simple to make.  My only problem is that it wasnt as thick as I would have liked.  I'm big on seasonings, so I did add creole seasoning and red pepper.  My daughter who had come over for dinner originally didn''t want any.  Once it was ready, she actually ate two bowls of it!  If you like this one, try the crawfish and corn soup.  Its really good.
