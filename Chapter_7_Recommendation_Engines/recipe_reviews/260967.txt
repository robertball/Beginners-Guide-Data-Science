9-5-2018  ~What luck to come up with something so good and satisfying using everything I already had on hand – Italian sausage and pancetta in the freezer (um, always), red wine on the counter (um, always), spinach and mushrooms in the fridge and fresh herbs and tomatoes in the garden.  No changes, but for my own tastes I prefer much less of the “sauce stuff” to pasta ratio – easy enough to adjust to one’s own preference.  Topped it off, of course, with a generous sprinkle of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Clean plates tonight.

YES, this is the one!  I have been making a few orecchiette recipes and thought this one might be ok, it turned out GREAT!  Now you are waiting for the eighteen changes and adds I made to make it so good. Well wait no longer!  I made this recipe the way it was called for, only halving the portion and I did add some more tomatoes halfway through the simmering.  The recipe turned out terrific and we will definitely be making this again!  Thank  you Staci!

Wonderful... The family really enjoyed it!  I used sweet Italian sausage. Otherwise ...followed all directions and ingredients.  Served it with garlic bread and a salad.

The flavor was awesome even though mine turned out way too salty!  I contribute this to the fact that I used prosciutto instead of the pancetta and I think the chicken sausage was salty too, so this is not the fault of the recipe....thus the 5 stars!  Would definitely like to try this recipe again, only this time, correcting my mistakes!  10-26-18

I made this with the following changes: I used mild pork Italian sausage because that's what I had on hand, and 5 ripe Roma tomatoes, again - because that's what I had on hand. Otherwise, I followed the recipe exactly. It was fabulous. I love tomatoes and will probably add an extra tomato or two next time I make it (for a little more sauciness) and would love to try it with the chicken sausage from Trader Joes. Absolutely delicious!

I will make this again.  I used several types and sizes of tomatoes from my garden, Spicy pork sausage  and added extra mushrooms.  Cooked the sauce for about 90 minutes.   My house smelled amazing while cooking and the taste of the completed dish was even better!

Delicious. 
I used Earth Balance instead of butter( dairy issues)
I used my tomatoes and herbs out of the garden.
I used Mild Italian Sausage.
The only thing I scaled back was the pasta , I used 3/4 of the package, but left everything else the same.
The Orecchiette took 12 minutes to cook,
.Great dish enjoyed by all.
Will make again. 
Sept. 2018.
