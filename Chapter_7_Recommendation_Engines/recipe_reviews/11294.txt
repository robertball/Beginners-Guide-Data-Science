These were good and freezed well, too. I think they may be even better if you substituted almond extract for the vanilla.

I needed a recipe for a bridal shower I was catering and the only thing they said they wanted was "Italian cookies" - so I hunted and tried this one - it's amazing! The cookies are nice and moist and if you add some flavoring to the icing, they are even better! I used a dual-handled ice cream scoop and they came out in perfect mounds!

These cookies were decent, but not as flavorful as I had hoped. The good news is that I was able to rescue them with a PERFECT icing recipe: combine 5 C. confectionary sugar, 6 Tbs water, 1 1/2 Tbs fresh lemon juice and 1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract. Mix all ingredients in a saucepan over low heat. Dip cookie tops in icing and let the extra drip back into the pan. 

Also, I noticed that you really must let these cookies bake all the way through. Otherwise, they will be shrivelled on the top rather than full and round. They also get hard very fast, so either store them or eat them asap!

I made these at Christmas and put them on platters of cookies I give away to family and friends. They were easy to make, and because you can decorate them without a lot of effort, they looked great on the platters. They coud be decorated for any occasion, not just Christmas. They were not too sweet, and I will be making them again next year! Thanks

These have a nice texture, but the flavor is a little bland.  They need some salt to offset the sugar, and next time I'd try some different extracts, like anise or orange.

These were really good! I looked for a recipe to make with my niece, she just wanted 'cookies with sprinkles'.  The plain cookie was pretty plain but not bad, the icing made them just right in my opinion. I did use almond in the icing too but that's the only change we made. We really had fun making these! BTW she mostly made them with me over-seeing, and she decorated them entirely on her own. I am not the best decorator but I probably would have done better than these lol

After having made similar cookies into shapes, this recipe is as good with much less time. And the taste is just as good as other Italian Cookies with less work. Highly recommended!!

See, my family and I mostly came from Southern Italy, and we do kind of the same thing. The frosting and sprinkles are exactly the same. However, if you really want flavor, we use anise in our batches. It's a bit more complicated than this recipe, mainly because it takes over 45 minutes to stir the dough (it's in a gigantic bowl. And since we use a lot of anise and make over 300 cookies, it is an expensive recipe. Plus, it's all handiwork. You mix the dough with your hands, and we make twisty shapes and swirls with the dough. It's a family event that takes (at the maximum) two days! The baking time is pretty much the same though.
Basically, this recipe is for someone who is leaning towards the traditional cookie, but doesn't have the time to do the hard work.

I wanted to try something different but I didn't really care for these cookies.  They look pretty but as some others have said they don't have much flavor.  I did add a few drops of anise oil to the glaze but even with that addition they didn't have much taste. I won't bother making them again.

I followed the cookie dough recipe as written but I added some orange extract to the glaze.  Great tasting and also a pretty cookie.

At our house we call these the "Play-dough" cookies. That is fairly close to what they taste like...bland although less salty than the namesake. Right out of the oven they taste like a bland sugar cookie with some egg flavor. Over time they lose the egg flavor and become, therefore, more bland...

These are a great simple cookie and I loved them with almond flavored frosting.  I usually make frosting with a little butter, powder sugar, milk and vanilla.  So I just changed the vanilla to almond and it was yummy!
