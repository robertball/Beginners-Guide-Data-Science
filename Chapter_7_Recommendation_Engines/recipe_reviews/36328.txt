have been looking for a marinade that would give a steak enough flavor to pair with a tomato mozzerella salad. this was delicious without overpowering the meat! be sure to use a red wine you would also want to drink!

I thought this was a wonderful recipe.  I used red wine vingrette and turned out great.  I just think it needs to marinate longer than 30 mins to get a more taster meat.  But it was yummy.....thanks

This turned out quite well for me (even though we over-cooked the steaks a tad). I used a merlot, mixed my own italian seasoning, added about a tablespoon of lemon juice to the marinade, and let it sit in the fridge for close to 5 hours. Will definitely try this one again... I think it would be fabulous on a rarer steak.

I did not give this a 5 rating because the recipe called for round steak which I feel is too chewy (even if it is rare).  This is an excellent marinade tho for sirloin or boneless rib eye.

Even my wife, who doesn't much like steak, gave this one 5 stars. Very flavorful after two hours of marinating.

We really like this. Sometimes I use red wine vinigarette which is also good and adds a bit of tanginess. Have used this on T-Bones and it is good also. Thank you.

We enjoyed this recipe.  The steaks marinated for 24 hours, and the flavor combinations really worked.

I really enjoyed this dish.  It was a very flavorful way to cook round steak.
