This cake was delicious!  I had tons of apples and I was getting sick of making only apple pies, so I tried this one out.  I did change a few things, though.  I didn't use the cherries because I don't like them and I used crushed almonds instead of walnuts because we have a realative allergic to walnuts.  And, at the end, while the cake was still hot, I poked holed in the top and poured hot caramel (from a jar) over it.  All the hot caramel sunk into the cake.  To die for!!!

This is fantastic.  I made this once with apples and blue berries and once with bananas and cranberries.  Delicious with a vanilla glaze over it.  I also added a single serving of flavoured apple sauce. I just find it always makes cakes more moist.

What went wrong. There is so much oil it soaked through a napkin and when I push on the cake is runs out. Has a very bland flavor and the apples are mush despite I cut them then kinda big.

Gigi, thank-you so much! This cake is wonderful! Moist, full of apple flavor, and pretty to boot with the specks of cherries. This will be the holiday gift from me to my neighbors this year. Delicious!

Oooo, this was YUMMY! VERY moist and tender. I loved the slightly crisp, buttery outside and fruity, yummy, moist inside. I think I may add a banana or 2 next time, but it was great as is. I did add 1 teaspoon of vanilla instead of 1/2 teaspoon, but that was my only change. This was a simple delicious cake that I will be making again! Thanks for sharing. :)

I hate giving poor reviews but this was just really bland and tasteless, even after following the recipe exactly and then using a teaspoon or so of cinnamon. Husband and I only ate a piece each and ended up tossing the rest. Definitely won't be making again.

YUM! I used 1/2 oil and 1/2 applesauce. Very moist. I cut up and froze in zip lock bags, and when I eat I simply put them in a toaster oven.

The cherries gave this cake reddish color on the inside which was quite unusual but great for holiday seasons, apples gave it moisture, while the nuts were the crispy little bits that improved cake's texture. I'm definitely making this cake again.

This was a great recipe.  Next time I'm going to add a few more apples and a carmel glaze on top.  Thanks!

Rather time-consuming but a good, moist cake. I only used 1 1/4 C sugar and it wasn't missed. Also, I didn't have quite 1 C of maraschino cherries, so I added some red candied cherries. It worked out very well.

MOIST & DELICIOUS!  This cake is excellent!  The walnuts mixed with the fruit gives it great flavor.  A little cinnamon would be a nice addition but not necessary.  It's just a personal preference.  Thank you Gigi for sharing your recipe!

This is a surprisingly wonderful cake!  Very moist, easy to make.  I made it with the Maraschino Cherries - which I normally do not like.  Works very well and tastes fabulous!  Nutmeg and Cinnamon add something special to this cake also.  I can't wait to try it with other fruit!

Well, I have the dissenting opinion on this cake, so give it a try before making up your mind.  I've been baking a lot of cake recipes from this site in order to find one worthy of entering in our local fair, and this one is not in the running.  I served it to two different sets of guests as well as my family but, after a week, ended up throwing half away because nobody would eat seconds.  It is moist, so that's not the problem.  The flavor is somewhat flat, though - just not a cake that grabbed us and had us wanting more.

Followed exactly except for the cherries because I don't like those in a pound cake. This turned out more bland than I expected.

YUM. This recipe serves as a great base for variations...I didn't have the cherries, so I used raisins. Since I used that combo, I added spice: Fresh Nutmeg, Cinnamon and Cardamom Powder (All 3 mixed to a total of about 2 teaspoons.)  My inlaws (from India) loved it!  The cake itself baked a dream!  No complaints here!  I must try sometime as written (with cherries)!

Delicious & moist! Was looking for strawberry recipe so used this one and replaced apples & cherries with 1 qt finely chopped strawberries (used food processor). Replaced 1/2 C oil with 1/2 C plain apple sauce. Used 1 tsp Vanilla instead of 1/2 tsp. Perfect! For those reviewers who said the cake was bland, maybe Vanilla was missed. I almost missed it due to the way recipe is written and it's added with dry instead of wet ingredients which is not typical. So just don't forget the Vanilla!

Followed the advice of two others.  I used 1teaspoon vanilla.  And added 1/8 cinnamon and dash of nutmeg.  This cake is so incredibly moist and delectable.   We don't like excessively sweet desserts so we loved it without glaze.

This recipe is incredibly versatile. To give the outer edge of this cake a nice carmel flavor I use some brown sugar and reduce the white sugar accordingly. In addition, I use a single serve of strawberry applesauce in with the apples and a tad of cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger to taste.  I haven't tried using the maraschinos yet,  but I will!

Love this-I brought this to a party and it was a huge hit.
