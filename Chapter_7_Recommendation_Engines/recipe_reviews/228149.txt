This was very good and I would make it again.  I used 2 oz of old cheddar and 6 oz of mozzarella.  I also added some mushrooms and red onion to the pepper mix but I am sure it would be good as written.

This was a very easy and delicious recipe. However, it did lack flavor so next time I will spice it up with a little Cajun seasoning.
