I make a lot of boiled chicken, and I would like to add some advice.  Be sure to cut the chicken into parts, remove any giblets, and rinse the chicken before boiling it.  I prefer to add some salt to the pot, which this recipe doesn't do.  The amount is up to you (start with 2 teaspoons if you're not sure).  You can remove the chicken from the pot as soon as it's done, if you prefer, rather than waiting for it to be "falling off the bone."  The white meat will be done before the dark meat.  If you leave the spine in the pot after removing the other parts and let it stew for a while, then strain the solids out with a sieve, you have some nice chicken broth to use for soups.  Let it cool, and remove the fat that rises to the top.

Here is a hint to ensure that your chicken is always juicy, never dry - cool it completely in the broth before shredding or cubing! Works like a charm.

This is SO easy and tastes SO good!  I put my chicken (usually boneless breasts) in the crock pot, cover it with water and add the salt, pepper, onions, carrots, celery (and garlic too) in chunks.  Someone else had posted that it is then easier to pull out of the broth when you're done.  Unbelievable flavor for both the broth and chicken.  And in the crock pot it is absolutely effortless!!  Thanks for the great recipe!!

This is the way my mom made it too... I add garlic and seasoned salt, and remove the skin off before simmering to reduce fat.  Less to skim off after.  I'll buy one of those 10 lb bags of legs n thighs when they're on sale and do the whole 10 lbs.  After deboning, freeze meat in broth to help prevent freezer burn.

When the chicken is done, take the meat off the bones and continue simmering the bones and veggies for a couple more hours to make a rich, flavorful broth.  Season to taste with salt.  Strain and discard the bones and vegetables, as the flavor is pretty much cooked out of the veggies by this time.  Chill (or freeze) the broth to use later.

I make this at least every couple of weeks. I freeze small portions in ziploc baggies & then use in my dogs' dinner (my vet advocates boiled chicken for my dogs)or in many other recipes calling for chicken.  I do leave the veggies in big chunks for ease of removal. To clarify stock for clear broth, removing solid flecks that are too small to be strained out with cheesecloth, follow this method. Separate the egg white from the egg yolk of one egg and reserve the shell. In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup cold water, egg white, and crushed eggshell. Add to strained stock, and bring to a boil. Remove from heat, and let stand 5 minutes. Strain again through a sieve lined with cheesecloth. From cloudy to crystal clear in no time! (I got this method from another recipe on this site...Basic Chicken stock)

I didn't actually make this recipe but I boil chicken to debone it constantly.  I am responding because of the number of people who stated they are using boneless,skinless chicken breasts for this!?!?  Why? The whole point of boiling chicken is to leach flavor from the bones and skin (where the flavor is) into the water for stock and so you can easily remove the meat from the bones and skin afterward.  This allows you to use a more economical cut of meat(i.e. bone in skin on chicken breasts,etc.) for your meals that call for shredded chicken (casseroles, chicken salad, etc.) and to save the more expensive cuts for your meals that call for a cutlet (cordon bleu, chicken parmesean, grilled chicken etc.) I would imagine boiled bonesless skinless breasts would result in a very bland stock that would require several buillon cubes to add more flavor as well as very bland chicken meat.

This recipe is great!  I didn't have celery on hand so I threw in a couple garlic cloves and some seasoning salt and simmered it until the meat was falling off the bones.  I did what one reviewer suggested and cooled the chicken in the broth to make the chicken as moist as possible.  As I was shredding the chicken for the enchiladas I'm making tonight, I couldn't help taking a quick bite and it was awesome!  Thanks so much for this great, cheap, building block recipe!

Great recipe! I used 1 bag of frozen chicken breasts and added 2 cloves of garlic. I then reserved the broth, divided the chicken into 1 cup potions and stuck them in the freezer for future use.

I used this as a base for the Creamy Chicken Lasagna recipe listed on this site. Instead of a whole chicken, I used two large boneless, skinless chicken breasts (about 1 1/4 pounds total) and I halved the amounts of vegetables. I didn't have peppercorns, so I put several shakes of ground pepper in the pot. I let them cook away for about 50 minutes and they were done and perfect. I saved the stock, and I will either use it in the next couple days or chuck it. :) It's not really strong broth, but it's not just water anymore either! Thanks for a quick and simple way to make stock AND cook chicken up! Maybe I'll cook up a few pounds of chicken, then cut them up and stick them in the freezer for quick chicken sandwiches in the future...

I've made this recipe for many years. Over 40! There are some hints, however:
Use a whole chicken. Cheaper, and more flavor. Don't use boneless, skinless breasts. The meat will be dryer and the broth not as flavorful. After cooking let chicken sit in broth until cool. The meat will not be tough. No need to debone chicken first if you have a big enough soup pot. Another hint: When cooked through, remove large pieces, then pour broth and remaining pieces through a sieve into another container. The little pieces of meat and bones and skin will be left behind. It will be easy then to pick through and get the meat. (Let cool awhile or you could get burned.) Another hint: The broth doesn't have to be used that day. Freeze some in containers, but take an ice tray and put some of the broth in that. This makes bouillon cubes. No more needing to buy artificially flavored, over salted, and MSG filled cubes from the store. Delicious. Update: Forgot to mention. My recipe calls for some herbs. Poultry seasoning, or sage and thyme. Maybe some rosemary.

This was the most tender, juicy chicken I have ever cooked.  I can't wait to use it for chicken tacos, burritos, and soups!  I added some garlic and salt to the water.  Also, I let the chicken cool down in the broth before shredding it.  After removing the chicken, I put the bones back in the broth and let it simmer for another couple of hours to make some AMAZING stock.  I let the stock cool in the fridge overnight and then removed the fat the next day for a virtually fat-free stock.  Next time, the only thing I will do differently is add some fresh parsley and thyme to the stock to round out the flavors.  I got everything to make this for around $4, and it made 4 cans' worth of stock and several cups of shredded chicken.  That is a steal both for my wallet and my health!!  I will continue to make this every single week because it is so healthy and so versatile.

Great recipe! This works well with chicken breast too. I recommend that the chicken be thawed for even cooking. Because I did not have all ingredients, I had to improvise. I used 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp celery salt, 1/8 tsp garlic powder and 1/4 onion powder. This turned out great! This one is a keeper!

I've made this time and time again as a base for my homemade chicken noodle soup and it's perfect!  One reminder though, never bring the water to a boil because it makes the chicken tough.  It's important to catch it right before a boil and let it simmer from there.  Follow that rule and you'll have the best most tender chicken around!

This is great! I tasted mine about half way through, and it was incredibly dry, but I kept going, and the end product was juicy and delicious! I will probably boil my chicken for now on when a recipe simply calls for "cooked chicken." I did add a clove of garlic. Thank you so much!

I used frozen boneless breasts for this, without thawing, and it turned out great - I only boiled for about 50 minutes. Not only is it easy, the chicken is tender and very mildly seasoned, perfect for casseroles, sauces, pastas, etc. The broth is an added bonus, too. Thanks so much for sharing!

I just prep chicken breast filets with this recipe instead of the whole chicken.  It's so good that I can eat my chicken breasts without any extras.  Health, low-fat, low-cal and low-sodium

This chicken and broth is the BOMB.  I stop and sniff it probably 10 times as I'm cooking this because it smells so good.  And with a short ingredient list, you know it's wholesome.  If I'm just doing chicken breasts, then I cook it 30 minutes and let it cool completely, as BODIE358 suggests and it's completely moist and flavorful.  I then keep the broth frozen for whatever I need.  I do it the night before and make chicken and dumplings (from this site) with it - the soup comes out so rich this way!  The crockpot method that Christy Marie suggested is also awesome. It really couldn't be easier.

awesome and moist, my 9 yr old said it didn't have much flavor but I left the peppercorns out since some of us have a sensitivity to that. worked out great, I added in some salt- perfect for combatting this cold! ;-)

Perfect "starter" recipe for so many chicken dishes. Definitely use a whole chicken, and when the meat has fallen off the bone, keep those bones, vegetables used to season the meat and cartilage, after stripping the cooled meat, to make stock using the water remaining from boiling the chicken. I use the chicken to make chicken mole, and make stock to freeze in cubes or for soup the next night.

Such a simple recipe yet, so useful!!!  I cooked a huge batch and then use it in different receipes during the week.  A handful sauteed in TexMex Spices works phenomenally well when whipping up some quick quesadillas.  We also mixed BBQ sauce in it for speedy sandwiches.  Add a little mayo, apples and walnuts a couple of days later for chicken salad.  I got requests for it again immediately!!!

I put a whole chicken, onion, carrots, celery and water in my pressure cooker.  Cooked it on high for 30 minutes.  Perfection.  Next time, I'm going to make homemade chicken stock.

This was very tasty and moist. I used half of the chicken for enchilada's and the rest I used with the broth and veggies for chicken soup. Thanks for the recipe.

this was so easy and it yielded wonderfully moist, tasty chicken.  I used boneless skinless breasts and then shredded them to make a casserole.  I will be using this chicken recipe as the base for my quesadillas now, too!  I also added chicken stock to the boiling water...just for a little extra flavor...

I added about 1/2 cup of teriyaki marinade (Trader Joe's Soyaki, specifically) which gave the chicken a light teriyaki flavor--delicious! Great for Chinese Chicken Salad or really any other cooked chicken recipe.

I wish I could link this recipe to some of the other recipes on this site- to name a few you may like to try- Chicken Pesto Pizza, Chicken Lasagna, Chick. Pot Pie, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato Salad w/Chicken, the possibilties are truly endless w/ this one! Sometimes, on a weekend, I do this in the crock pot for 6 hrs and that really lowers the risk of it drying out. I'll make huge batches and freeze for future recipes. Huge time-saver for busy Moms and Dads!!

Great time saver!  I used my chopper & shredded carrots, onion, celery, green pepper, added some garlic, pepper, & chicken boullion.  Then I added 3lbs. of chicken breast, water to cover & cooked about 1 hour.  I used 1lb. for chicken salad, 1lb. for a casserole & the rest I cut up, added some noodles & had in the soup it had cooked in!

I make this almost every week.  The meat is so tender and flavorful. The meat can be used for salads, casseroles, you name it.  The broth can be used for soup, rice, noodles. A very inexpensive yet versatile recipe.

I have a different take on this recipe.(DO the night before the BBQ or oven bake...)  Only boil chicken for 1/2 -3/4 hours.(With a couple of bay leafs and a handleful of dried rosemary in the water.)Drain & refrigerate overnight, "marinating" of your choice. Preheat oven/BBQ to 400C Bake/or BBQ...on medium.. (turning frequently)for additional 20mins. At this point of grilling you can add whatever BBQ sauce...(etc) which will make it 5 stars to you :-)

Really enjoyed this chicken.  It came out very moist. I also used chicken breasts and only boiled them for about 50 minutes.  Didn't have peppercorns so used garlic salt and ground pepper. Turned out fantastic!  Even better the next day in our chicken salad sandwiches.

I follow many of the suggestions other reviewers have.  I remove the skin to cut back on some of the fat.  I also like a lot of garlic in my chicken.  I will have to try letting the chicken cool in the pot, I usually remove to cool.  Finally, save the liquid as it does make great stock.

The broth was awesome & I regret only saving a cup full (don't know what on earth I was thinking). As others stated, the meat fell off the bone so that process went quickly. I'll use this method from now on. Thanks George.....

Fantastic, fantastic chicken.  Used to make the Chicken Noodle Soup by Sherry on this site - and it was fabulous! Will definitely use again (although I may use chicken pieces rather than a whole chicken next time, to save time).

very simple. i use the slow cooker when makeing broths or stocks. i also hate wasteing the vegetables so i do something a friend taught me. i save the ends and parts of the veggies i normaly wouldnt in most recipes, and freeze them. then when i have a decent amount of vegetables saved i make this recipe or broth. works very well and i dont feel quilty discarding them when im done.

Thank you, George, for posting this simple yet useful recipe. I am a fairly inexperienced cook, and as of three days ago I did not know how boil chicken. I marinated my boiled chicken in zesty italian dressing and put it in a pasta salad. I also made some delicious chicken tetrazini. Thanks again!

This was so great and so easy!  I added jalapenos and peppers for a little extra flavor and made enchiladas with the shredded chicken.  I used a three-pound chicken and it was fully cooked after an hour  so make sure you check it and don't cook it too long. Thanks for the recipe!

I make this quite frequently when I need cooked chicken meat. Usually, I use chicken breasts instead of the whole chicken. Add a little bit of fresh minced garlic. Very tender and flavorful.

This recipe was great, the chicken was flavorful and tender.  I followed the recipe, but as directed in another review, I allowed the meat to cool while still in the water/broth.  
Love the broth that was created as well.
~ Two Great Staple items from one recipe!

Excellent recipe.  I made it as directed (just added salt).  Shredded chicken made excellent chicken salad; broth made wonderful soup (after being frozen).  Thanks so much for this money-saving recipe.

I personally don't like to make alterations to other people's recipes... especially ones that are rated with 5 stars, but I did add a few extra ingredients. Sorry--often annoyed by other reviewers for making so many alterations that it is no longer YOUR recipe. However, your recipe is perfect. I just added some garlic and parsley to suit my tastes. Even without that, it would have been absolutely wonderful. Thank you so much. I searched for this recipe simply because I wasn't sure about the cooking time. Your instructions are immaculate as far as I am concerned. Thanks again.

I wish I had found this years ago. I was always told to boil the chicken til "it fell off the bone".  Was that 10 Minutes? 2 days? I finally figured it out, but if I had known this recipe was here, (for timing reasons) I would have been making chicken salad and things a long time ago.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is a very good basic recipe.  For those who say that it bland should realize that it is for the basic diced cooked chicken.  You spice and season it as you make your final recipe.  When I get a great sale on whole chickens, I get out the giant stock pot and fill it and cover with water and start heating it.  I like to be able to go out to the garden and snip some fresh herbs.  Whatever is growing and looks good.  I like my final recipes with dark meat.  Some (my SO) do not, so I bag up some different mixes and freeze them.  The boil the bones some more and filter the liquid through a fine mesh filter.  This liquid freezes into the best broth you can get.  I really like to be able to put a bunch of these into the freezer before winter comes.  It gives me the cooked chicken for taco, burritos, pot pies, chicken soup, chick and dumplings, etc. at a drop of a hat for a hearty winter supper.

I'm always a little wary when it comes to cooking chicken...you don't want to over cook it and you don't want to under cook it. I took the advice from another reviewer and boiled two boneless skinless chicken breasts for 50 minutes and it turned out great.

My grandmother who came from Rumania used the same recipe. I use it for soup and chicken salad. My in-laws say I make the best chicken salad ( it's soooo easy with this recipe). All my children use it as well. I suppose my grandchildren will use it. I really never thought to post it, because it's so easy. Thank you!

I threw a chicken bouillon cube into the water to preserve the flavor and a jalapeno for kick. Great by itself, with rice or tacos.

I have used this recipe or a variation based on what I have on hand many, many times now. It works excellently! If you allow your chicken (or chicken bones) to cook with the vegetables/spices you like for an hour or so before straining, you get a nice chicken stock. You'll know if you got chicken stock or if you have chicken water based on how it smells. The water should still smell like chicken noodle soup AFTER you remove all the "stuff" from it and it should not be colorless! Now you can make a soup from the stock or you can freeze the stock in ice cube trays (then repackage into baggies) and use it in recipes :)

I use this recipe for almost EVERY recipe that calls for chicken! This chicken is tender, juicy, and has the most amazingly warm and comforting flavor. It is so simple with only a handful of ingredients thrown into a pot then letting it cook itself for a few hours (I usually let it cook until it falls off the bone). I throw out everything but the shredded chicken and the broth (you can also freeze the chicken so it can be used months down the road but I HIGHLY recommend freezing it in a bag with the broth to avoid freezer burn).
Thanks SO much for this recipe -- I have already given it to several of my friends and family! :)

Simple & tasty.  The chicken was literally falling off the bone as I was taking it out of the pot, and it's juicy & delicious.   I haven't made soup yet, but I tasted the broth and it is delicious.  Thank you so much! EDIT: Since my 1st review, I have used this method several times; with whole chickens, thighs, legs, breasts (whatever was on sale!) This is a great way to cook a lot of chicken in "bulk" and still have a lot of versatility.  If you can stock up on chicken of any cut when it's on sale, or the day before it expires at the supermarket, this recipe is for you! You can boil as stated in the recipe, or use plain water and while it's simmering, you don't have to do a thing! I used the stock of soups, and in 1 batch, I had enough to fill 2 chicken pot pies, fajitas for my family and a week's worth of chicken for chicken salad sandwiches (try the curry chicken salad recipes). This is perfect for the budget conscious.  Thank you SO MUCH!!!!

Who would think that you needed a recipe to boil chicken.  I do it all of the time without one.  But this recipe was wonderful!  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  I also strained the broth and froze it for use in soups and sauces later.  It was incredibly flavorful!

So easy and yummy!!  I used this recipe as a base for soup. I used a whole chicken and didn't cut it up (as some other reveiws had suggested) and had no problems, chicken was done in 90 minutes exactly. I did use some salt though, only a pinch. When the chicken was done I removed it from the pot and strained the broth. Way better than broth from a carton or a boullion cube, and although it takes some time its really easy.  :)

Boiled just under 2 hours, meat was falling off the bone. Placed the chicken on a cutting board; skin was very easy to peel off with a pair of tongs. Ate the legs as is, going to chop the beasts tonight and use for chicken noodle soup (and use some of the stock I strained from the boiled chicken).

THANKS! Sometimes simple recipes like this can be a pain to find any where! I have a recipe that calls for boiled chicken - and I had NO IDEA how to do this as I'm a beginning cook and I know poultry has to be cookedhandled just right. Also thanks, AQRoland for your added extra tips...again, the whole giblets part - I wouldn't have even thought about.

This is how I will cook my whole chickens from now on. I usually boil the bones after roasting a chicken, but this eliminates that step... and is much easier to clean up. I was a little afraid the breast meat might be dry, but it wasn't. Extremely economical and versatile way to prepare chicken for lots of dishes.

This is a great recipe.  You can't go wrong!  The chicken came out great.  I used this recipe to boil chicken for a chicken salad.  It tasted so rich!  The leftover broth was great too!

Good recipe/technique.  Only gave it 4 stars because I let the chicken cool in the stock before removing and shredding.  Chicken remains moist and stock more flavorful.

Great recipe.  I used a 5-pound chicken so I cooked it a bit longer, but it was very moist and perfectly done.  I also made stock like other reviewers suggested which I am going to use for risotto.  Thanks!

Thank you for giving me an idea of how long to cook chicken. Some people may never have to look this information up, and might find it strange, but I really don't know how to cook chicken or fish. My mother rarely cooked meat when I was a child, and somehow beef is easier. Enough of my life story - thanks!

This recipe is great!  I'd never thought of boiling chicken before.  I used boneless chicken breasts, and just put them in a pot with onion and carrots and water.  Make sure to use a big enough pot though, cuz the water boiled over in mine.

I did this in the crock pot for about 10 hours on low and the chicken fell into tender pices.  I've frozen it for later use and used the broth to make a delicious soup.

This is such a good recipe!  I will never de-bone a chicken again the old way!!!  You can also refrigerate the juice, then take the fat off the top and voila!---- yummy chicken broth.  Wonderful!

This was perfect for chicken salad...the meat really did fall off the bones! It was so easy to make, and tasted great.  I too saved the chicken broth to make chicken noodle soup for later.

You can't go wrong with this recipe. This is the first recipe I used from this site, and it is so versatile! I usually make it for enchiladas, but it also makes amazing soup, or chicken for any other recipe! It is funny that you'd need a recipe for something that seems as basic as boiled chicken, but three years ago I had no idea how to make shredded chicken. Now I make it all the time!! Thanks!

This was my first time boiling chicken and it came out sooo tender and delicious. I bought a 2 pound WHOLE chicken and all I added in the water were carrots, flattened garlic cloves, pepper, an salt. The rest of the flavors came from the chicken. I simmered the chicken just before boiling (following a reviewer's suggestion) and the meat really did fall off the bone. YUM! Also, since I used a 2 pound chicken it only took me about an hour.  I agree with the reviewers that said to keep the skin for the extra flavor, and then skim off the fat later.

Skim the top a few times while it's cooking and you have broth for soups - way better than canned and way less wasteful.

I never knew how to boil a chicken!  Now I do and I save the broth for other recipes.  Oh so good.  I made a few changes, some because I didn't have ingredients on hand.  I used celery flakes instead of fresh and regular pepper instead of peppercorns.  I did add a clove of garlic and some parsely for added flavor.  Very good - thanks!

Awesome!! I used this recipe for chicken and stock for  a chicken noodle soup recipe from this site and it turned out great.  I added 2 garlic cloves, crushed but whole so they would be easy to take out, and a bay leaf.  I allowed the chicken to cool while sitting in the pot and it turned out tender and full of flavor and the stock was a great start to my soup!!  Thanks!

I was sort of skeptical too, but this definitely is the best recipe for the economical cook like me!  I boiled chicken breasts to shred and also got a great pot of broth out of it too!  Thanks for the tip about cooling the chicken in the broth...my chicken came out tasty and not the least bit dry!

I used this for Chicken Pot Pie VI from this site, which was NOT good. Family liked it, i hated it. But the one reedeming feature in the pie was the lovely moist chicken that i got from using this recipe. Used breast pieces and just lowered the cooking time a bit.

I read all of the reviews and followed many suggestions.  This chicken was absolutely tasteless.  You would be much better off roasting the chicken in a 350 degree oven after rubbing extra virgin  olive oil all over the breasts, sprinkling with salt, pepper, paprika or rotisserie chicken spice (comes in a premade container)and roasting it for 30 to 40 minutes, or until juices run clear.  Good thing I got a deal on the chicken breasts at the store.

Thank you so much for this recipe. I have tons of recipes that call for cooked chicken that I don't make often because I hate paying for the expensive precooked chicken at the store and wasn't sure how to do it myself. This is so cheap and easy that my family will be eating loads more chicken now!

Cooked mine a bit longer, about 2 hours. Stock is great, chicken tasted good, but because the carcass broke down so much, it was difficult to remove all of the small bones from the meat. Make sure you double check the meat for bones!

I just used this recipe for the Chicken Pot Pie IX on this site. Both turned out excellent. Though as I was making this, it smelled so great I thought I should have just made soup instead!!! Highly recommend this, the meat falls right off of the bones and is juicy and tender.

Every cook's must have recipe.  Makes life a lot easier.  I make this for my alfredo sauces, enchilladas and other pasta sauces.  Don't throw away the broth.  It's yummy too with a little salt.

Thanks for the great recipe! I used a crock pot because it fit with my schedule better. The chicken was very tender and easy to work with!

Yep, this was perfect!  I boiled split chicken breast which promptly allowed the meat to fall off the bone.  I then used the chicken in my own curried chicken salad.

The chicken turned out great, and I froze the broth for later use.  It tasted much better than store bought broth.  Thanks for the recipe!

Here is a hint for straining the broth. Put the chicken and veggies in a cheesecloth bag (or a net cooking bag, they have them in some stores). When the chicken is done just lift the bag out and open it into a large bowl. No straining necessary! I also suggest more spices and veggies. Parsnips add a wonderful flavor, garlic and thyme and fresh dill are nice too, but I guess that is if you want a flavorful broth as well and not just boiled chicken.

I came across this recipe because I had two large bone-in chicken breasts that I wanted to poach but couldn't remember how long to simmer them. This is a great recipe. I also followed other reviewers suggestions and let the breasts cool in the liquid and the meat was tender, flavorful and juicy. After removing the breasts, I simmered the remains for almost 2 hours adding a little salt and now have a wonderful chicken broth to use for a pot of chicken and rice soup. So economica and easy. Thanks!
and easy

Wow, what a great recipe. This is my first time boiling chicken & I must say, this will be the way to cook it from now on.  Very moist, tender, flavorful!  Yummy. I cooked it exactly the way it reads, added salt as well as garlic. Chicken falls off the bone. Saved the stock for soup later.  Thanks for the recipe.

Our kitchen really smelled good while this was cooking.  The chicken was tender, moist and delicious.  We immediately made soup (for a family with flu) with the dark meat and broth.  We kept the white meat for chicken salad or burritos.  What a great way to get the most mileage from a chicken.

This was amazingly good for something so simple. The best advice from another reviewer was to let the chicken cool in the broth before removing - it was extra moist and flavorful.  I'll be on a boiled chicken binge for a while!  Thanks!

When making chicken I normally just put them in a pot, fill water to cover add a little salt and pepper. Did it this way and chicken was much more flavorful. Thanks

Sometimes when you get to a certain age in life, your taste buds falter.  (Like mine)... So I use 5 quarts of water to 3 lbs. chicken and 3 chicken bouillon cubes from Wylers.  It always makes the chicken broth awesome if make dumplings to this.  I use to dice all my onions and that's why I hated boiling chicken, but I just threw some on the stove and hope it does the same thing.  Half it uh? :) Love it!

This produces very flavorful chicken.  I didn't have any celery, so I just added a teaspoon of celery salt.  I used 5 bone-in chicken breasts.  I used two breasts for Parmesan Basil Chicken Salad, and have the rest chopped up, ready to go for tomorrow's dinner.  I saved the broth too, it was pretty good!

I used skinless thighs - the meat is moister than breasts. I saved the liquid and made white sauce for chicken pot pies.  I would definitely use this recipe again. Thank you!

Super easy! Very economical, I actually got 3 meals out of one chicken for my husband and I. The first night I had sliced chicken breast and my husband had the legs and some thigh meat. Very tasty and tender! Then I cubed some for chicken salad sandwiches, and then cooled the rest in the broth and then shredded it to add barbecue sauce for pulled chicken sandwiches. I will do this again!

I do onion, celery, carrot, salt, pepper, rosemary, and garlic. Strain the broth and keep for chicken and rice or any other chicken recipe. I put the broth in an ice cube tray and then (when frozen) into a gallon-size Zip-Lock bag in the freezer for easy portioning.

Very nice basic recipe. I used a package of chicken thighs and served it with rice as a bland dinner for a family member getting over a stomach illness. I only made two changes: (1) adding about a teaspoon of minced garlic from a jar, and (2) I followed the other reviewers' advice to let it cool in the broth, and the texture was great - very very tender. Yes, it is quite tasteless, but when you can only eat crackers and toast and Jell-o, it's a great change! You can get it slightly tastier by adding salt and pepper beforehand and fresh lemon juice just before serving.

I followed the recipe to the letter and it turned out perfectly.  I used my boiled chicken to make "Chicken Noodle Soup" by Sherry, off of this website.  To die for.  Thanks to both George and Sherry for great recipes.  The chicken turned out excellent - juicy and tender - and made my home smell wonderful too.

This was wonderful.  It made a wonderful chicken stock.  We had the most tender chicken and so flavorful.  I also made majority of the chicken and broth into a soup and it was THE best chicken soup we had ever had.  So, thank you for this basic boiled chicken recipe.  I will never buy canned chicken again when this is so simple and much more tasty!  I did follow the advice of some of the others and it turned out great!  I can usually find whole chickens on sale for $.69/lb and the amt of meat you receive can make several meals.  Works great to freeze as well.  Just be sure and freeze in a little of it's broth to keep it moist.  I also bought some ice cube trays and will use those to make my broth cubes to use.  No longer needing to buy those very SALTY boullion cubes!

This is fantastic, and very simple.  I use this for a soup, and the larger pieces of meat I use in a casserole the next day.

Excellent recipe!  Both the chicken and the broth were incredibly tasty - the only modification I made was throwing a few garlic cloves in.

This recipe was fantastic.  I decided to put my own little twist on it.  Instead of water, I cooked it with a small amount of olive oil in a frying pan.  I also added mushrooms in place of the celery and onions in place of the carrots.  I finished it off with some red wine sauce.  Came out awesome!

Thank you!!!  And you're right, boiled chicken meat is called for in SOO many recipes and is very expensive comparatively in the cans.  This way, NO preservatives, I pick the spices and herbs, salt to taste, VOILA!!  And as much chicken meat in my soups as I like!  THANK YOU, GEORGE!

Nice and easy.  I did add some chicken boullion to the water.  This is a great way to eat chicken when on a diet, especially a no-carb diet.  Use it for buffalo chicken dip or buffalo chicken sandwiches.  Thank you for your recipe!  :-)

I just made this today with boneless chicken breasts . Mine came out tasting similar to a pot roast except with chicken flavor instead of beef. Definitely will cook this again!

This recipe is good with boneless breasts if you don't have bone-in on hand, though bone-in is obviously going to be better and have a richer favor. For boneless breasts, I used half water, half canned chicken broth.

I do recommend adding garlic, either whole or powder, increasing the amount of onion to taste, and cutting the chicken into strips or chunks to help it better adsorb the flavor. The chicken gets more tender the longer it cooks, so you may want to let it cook a while past being done until it gets as tender as you want it to be.

I followed & modified this recipe. The results were: well seasoned, tender & juicy. 
I removed organs from cavity, rinsed well & placed the entire chicken in the pot. I rotated the chicken twice while cooking to ensure even cooking sinse it wasn't completely submerged in broth.
I added 3 cans of Swanson chicken broth, 1 can water,  1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper, 5 stalks celery, 1/2 white onion, 5 fresh thyme sprigs, 1 orange habanero pepper, garlic & sea salt & let cook covered 2 hours.

I make this all the time because it's much more flavorful than store bought type.....I make broth/stock as written above but I always add Salt,  a couple Bay leaves,  a bit of Rosemary, and a small sprig of Thyme.... Peel the onion and slice it in half. After cooling your broth, freeze in pint size freezer bags for use in other meals.

Basically the same as my recipe except I add a bay leaf.  Also, after deboning the chicken I return the bones to the stock to add flavor to my broth.

Pretty much a good base for broth or chicken stock and soups. Here is another hint for that Oomph that chicken broth often lacks:  Add a pinch or a scant 1/8th tsp. of saffron shreds to the soup. You'd be surprised at what it adds to the flavor.

I loved this recipe!  It was exactly what I was looking for.  I used 1 packet of chicken flavored bouillon, carrots, celery, covered with water and and let simmer.  It was moist, and had a "soup" flavor to the chicken which I was trying to achieve.  I will definitely be making this again and again - especially when I need more "not so spicy/bold" foods in my diet.
Thanks for sharing!

I use a lot of chicken broth in cooking and like to make my own  rather than using canned broth. You can add or delete ingredients according to your personal tastes, but this is a basic, simple recipe with great results.....tender chicken for casseroles , soups, or chicken salad, plus a delicious broth that can be used as a base in cooking rice, green beans, etc.

I didn't notice much of a difference in doing it this way and just using plain water. Still got the added benefit of using the veggies for part of the meal though.

It's called boiled chicken so don't expect spectacular but its quick, easy, and good.
