Made this tonight using 2 large acorn squash, no olive oil (forgot) and 1 pound of mild Italian sausage.  I pre-cooked the squash and sausage as per the recipe before picking my husband up from work.  I left the squash in the oven (turned off) and the sausage in on the stove (also turned off) and then came home, heated the meat a bit, drained the water off the squash and continued on with the recipe.  Delicious!!

This dish was amazing! I made sure not to tell my boyfriend what i was making because I knew he wouldnt go for it, a couple bites in and he was ready to know when i would make it again :) We love garlic and onions, so i cooked up some onion with the turkey then added in minced garlic.  I also used someone elses idea to add bread crumbs in with the meat.  Will definitely make this dish again!!! The sweet and spicy combination is perfect.

Love this! I use hot pork sausage like other reviewers I microwaved the squash for 8-10 min to get them soft then bake for about 15 min, then I throw it under the broiler for a minute or 2 to get the brown sugar caramelized.

I think this is great.  I served this with a side of pasta. Are people giving it low stars because it's so easy? I used "Tillamook burn like a ragin' fire sausage" and it was HOT!  I love hot but I will try different meat fillings in the future....it will be fun :) Great dish!

This was a delicious recipe.  I used hot italian sausage (not turkey).  It was awesome! I also served with sour cream on the side for anyone who wanted it.  That was delicious as well.  Very easy and tasty recipe!

I have made this three times since I first discovered recipe in march. Fabulous. 6 thumbs up frome each member of my family. I can't use spicy sausage (yet) because our youngest won't eat spicy foods. So I doctor up seasoned turkey with some cumin and mild chili spices. I made this tonite in honor of our first "fall" dinner....! Very happy family.

Really delicious.  I substituted sugar free maple syrup for brown sugar (better for diabetics), sage pork sausage and about 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes.  Of course with pork sausage being used there was no need for the olive oil.

This is great. My wife who hates squash actually had two servings! I put cheese on two of the halfs to see if it would make a difference. I think we liked it better without the cheese.

I used splenda, 2 lbs turkey sausage, and left out the olive oil.  Very flavorful and easy.

Didn't care for the flavor but it just felt like it was missing something.  It felt like a very incomplete dish.

Made this last night and loved it. I changed a couple of things- used a chicken & apple sausage rather than spicy turkey and added onions to the sausage while cooking.  Also topped with a little bit of goat cheese once the squash was done cooking.  Great recipe, will definitely be making this again (and trying new additions to the mix =)  )

I just happened to have a few acorn squash and spiced sausage I needed to use. It tasted "okay" but I probably won't make it again.

I made this tonight, with the usual personal amendments (I happened to find pork sausage before turkey, and cooked it up in a rather haphazard fashion, then ran short of brown sugar). I'm fairly certain that my shortcomings did not harm this recipe much. It was AMAZING. Just the thing for a cold and windy night.

I used hot & mild sausage.  As I did that I cooked the squash for about an hour because I had a large squash.  It was a tad overdone but it was delicious!!  I also used parsley.  Pretty easy and you can add other ingredients to the dish to spice it up!

very good, very easy.  I used turkey sausage and added a bit of red pepper to make it a little more spicy.  I halved the squash and put it in the microwave in a glass dish w/a bit of water.  Probably a total of 10 minutes is fine.  Cooked the sausage and pre-heated the ove to 400 in the meantime.  Added a tiny bit of butter (don't think I will next time) and brown sugar to the bottom, stuffed w/sausage, then brown sugar and bread crumbs on top.  Cooked in oven for about 10 min then a quick broil.  Very good and very filling!

I revised the turkey by adding my own spices, I don't like hot spices. Very yummy! I will definitely make it again. :-)

Easy to make. Did not add olive oil to sausage (did not want it to be too oily).  Added sprinkle of cinnamon and ground cloves on top with remaining brown sugar.  Cut recipe in half and it was good (with 1 lb. of mild Italian bulk sausage)Ea

Tasted excellent. It would be a perfect fall meal. It was not filling enough on its own, though. I should have fixed rice or something to go with it.

Made it with chicken andouille sausage and put under broiler to brown the sugar a bit.  So delish. Glad I tried it. Think it would be great with a bit of diced apple.
