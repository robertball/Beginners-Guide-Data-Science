Yum!! I give these an easy 5 star! 
Very tasty. I don't think they will last long in my freezer.  Lol.  
I think I cooked the base ingredients a bit too long as it turned out quite chewy.  I like them that way anyhow but they are a bit harder to cut into nice squares .
Thank you for sharing.

super easy and tasty. I reduced the amount of margarine in the custard layer and added water a bit at a time.
