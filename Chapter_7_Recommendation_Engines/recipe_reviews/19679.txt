This was just OK.  I will stick with my recipe of yogurt, 1 envelope of Zesty Italian Dressing, and chopped shallots.  Just mix and chill 1 hour.

I was looking for a yogurt dip recipe because my "bff" is on a low fat, low salt diet. This was the only one I found so I decided to give it a shot, despite the less than favorable review. I added garlic and onion powders and quite a bit of Italian style Mrs. Dash along with a bit of fresh diced onion. With all of my additions, it turned out to be a tasty dip and healthy too!

Easy to make but I can't say the taste is outstanding.  I recommend cutting the recipe by half to see if you like it before making so much dip.  I'm still searching for a yogurt based vegetable dip that I can use for snacking with vegetables.

This is far from bland. As with any homemade dip, make this ahead of time to let the flavors develop. If you make it 5 mins before you need it, of course it's not going to have much flavor. I tasted this about 4 hours after I made it and it was very flavorful. The next day it was delicious! I like the combo of the herbs used and the versatility to substitute or add others. I made it exactly as written and I made a half recipe. I love that unlike envelope dip mixes, this isn't loaded with sodium and other preservatives. Plus it's healthy! I used non-fat Greek yogurt and it was nice and thick.  The only suggestion I would make it to cut back a bit on the fresh garlic because once the dip sits for a while, it gets very garlicky!

Wow, this was really good, I was surprised! I didn't have chervil so I used tarragon and I doubled the amount of garlic. I served it with sliced green bell pepper and celery stalks, yum!

Very bland. I added garlic salt, more pepper, dried dill weed (1/2 tsp), and a large tablespoon of spicy hawaiian dressing to give it some kick. Maybe not so healthy, but the orig. recipe gives healthy a bad name!

I was hopeful I was going to like this even though there were some reviews that said it was bland. I used tarragon in place of chervil and doubled it and the marjoram. I used Greek yogurt, and I let it sit for about 6 hours. I thought it was rather bland, and I wasn't that fond of the raw minced garlic. I wish I had used garlic powder instead. I liked it best on salty Triscuits. I won't make this again though.
