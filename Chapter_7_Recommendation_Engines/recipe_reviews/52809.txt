This was a huge hit!  We forgot to pickup the buttermilk at the store, so we made our own by using cream and putting a couple of teaspoons of vinegar in it.  What can I say but WOW!

This is a very interesting and yummy recipe -- the dumplings are tasty and the berries (I used a mix of raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and blueberries) made for a nice dumpling sauce.  However, I cut the amount of sugar (used brown sugar instead of white) by about two-thirds, and it was still sickeningly sweet.  I'd suggest adding the sugar slowly until you reach the level of sweetness that suits your taste, rather than simply trusting this recipe.

Tasty, but very, VERY sweet. If I make these again, I will cut down on the sugar and add more lemon juice. If the lemon was meant to add any tarness, there isn't nearly enough to do the trick. These are very simple to make. I did need to add some extra buttermilk to make my dumpling dough soft enough. Flipping the dumplings was a little tricky because they were very crowded in the pan.

I had never made dumplings before and really liked these.  We had just gathered pick ur own black raspberries from a farm and this was a nice recipe for them.  The dumplings were deliciou.  My 7 year old son especially liked them.  I used the leftover syrup for other things for the rest of the week.  Like pancakes or a blueberry dessert and I topped it with my leftover raspberry syrup which I heated up before using.  Thanks for the recipe.

I wish I had read all of the reviews before I made this. I used blackberries which were already very naturally sweet. It turned out delicious, however it was even much to sweet fro my 4 boys. It was like eating dumplings in syrup. The dumplings soaked up allot of the sugar so everything about it was SWEET! I will definately make again but only using half the sugar. Thanks for the great recipe.

We loved them.  I substituted strawberries, so I had to step the sugar down to 1/2 cup to begin with and sweetened to taste.  I would recommend you did the same with the raspberries starting at about 2 cups, because it can easily get too sweet depending on your batch of berries.  After the dumplings cooked off I tossed in a handful of fresh slices strawberries into the syrup for texture.    I've even made the syrup ahead of time and finished it off in a crockpot before.

These are almost sicky sweet, and could use less sugar, and more tartness.  However, the most pertinent advise I would give anyone looking to make this tasty treat is to use a pan at least twice the size you think you need.  Dumplings need space, especially if you're going to flip them.  Cram them all into a too small pot and end up with crumbled dumpling mess, and a fantastically purple stove that will be loads of fun to clean up after all that syrup has cooled onto your stovetop.  Otherwise, these are a great sweet treat.

Used wild picked black raspberries.   Only two cups (and I think even less next time) of sugar and increased lemon to 1 tsp.  Had a nice raspberry flavor and the dumplings were fun especially as it has been too hot to bake this week.

This is exactly what we called Grandma's Roly Poly.  Growing up in Canada, we would go out and pick some fresh berries, bring them back to Grandma and she would make up a Roly Poly.  Always delicious!  I have tried many times to find a recipe under that name but couldn't find the right thing.  I did cut back the sugar a little and then threw in a few cranberries for the tartness. Thanks for sharing!

Delicious!  I used milk with a couple of teaspoons of vinegar instead of buttermilk and red raspberries.  Still delicious!

I made some tweaks to the recipe and it turned out very nice, but RICH! The sauce is thick  and the dumplings are yummy. I cut the sugar down to 2 cups and doubled the lemon juice and added a nice vanilla extract to the berries.  I added  a few Tbps of sugar  and 1.5 tsp cinnamon to the dumplings and used butter instead of shortening, but a bit more.  I could see how the dumplings could be bland if they weren't jazzed up a bit.

i also, started making these before reading all the reviews. i noticed the flour mixture never got to pea sized, and i had to add extra buttermilk to form a dough. holy sweetness batman! although this is delicious, its definatly over-sweet. i would definatly cut down on the sugar, by at least HALF! NO JOKE! when i had my first bowl, i had with vanilla ice cream, and without the ice cream to mellow out the sugar, it would have been too much. i am freezing the juice/berry mixture for pancakes & ice creams for a later date. i would definately make again, but tweak the recipe.

This recipe sounded delicious, but I decided to adjust the sugar according to the other reviews.  I only added 2 1/2 cups sugar, which was perfect.  We did like it, but everyone felt that the dumplings were just tasteless lumps of dough.  Yes, they were covered in the awesome berry syrup, but we couldn't get past the bland taste of them after you bit into it.  I will probably make this again, but next time I'll try adding some sugar to the dumplings for that sweetness in every bite.

I don't think my sauce was hot enough when I dropped the dumplings in because they formed one big glob at the top of the pan but when I turned up the heat a little bit and it began to boil they eventually broke into smaller pieces (I helped by gently mixing it).   I also put 1/2 cup less sugar than the recipe called for because it seemed like an awful lot of sugar (I was going to only put 3 cups of sugar in but I was afraid it might not turn out at all).   However, despite that and the fact that due to the sauce not being hot enough (at first) I think the dumplings soaked up some of the sauce (I don't think the dumplings are supposed to be black all the way through like little black raspberry balls...instead I think they're supposed to look like little bisquits -oh well!)...despite all of that, the finished product is still delicious!  I put some half and half over it to cool it because I couldn't wait for it to cool naturally. My hubby put whipped cream on it and we both loved it.

A waste of expensive berries. It was too sweet and did nothing to bring out the flavor of the berries. Will not make again.

It was quick and easy to make and good, but it was VERY sweet! so next time I will reduce the sugar. I didn't care much for the dumplings so I will try a different recipe for them as well.
