Kids loved it. They called it their new favorite dish. I used a medium spicy salsa.  I liked it too, but  found it could use just a touch more flavour but I'm not quite sure what... maybe some extra garlic?  Definitely worth experimenting with!

I really liked this, however, I used Chi Chi's pineapple salsa which made this dish kind of sweet.

Excellent and super simple! The only change I made was to add a little minced garlic. I'll definitely make this again.

This was such a nice change from a traditional pasta dish. To save time cooking after work I prepped the chicken, pasta and peppers over the weekend. We will definitely be making this again.

Wonderful dish and so easy!  I added red and yellow peppers for extra color and flavor and rubbed Cajun seasoning on the chicken before cooking.  Fresh made salsa from a local restaurant is likely better and maybe even cheaper than canned salsas.  Next time I want to try with zucchini or other squashes and a bit less cheese.
