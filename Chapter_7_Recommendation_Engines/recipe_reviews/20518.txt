I like to serve a lot of different appetizers at
parties and over the years have found some
great ones but this is still a favorite. Try using
10 slices of real bacon, cooked and crumbled.
The filling can also be made several days ahead
and refrigerated, then softened before using.

I was looking for a savory "finger food" to take to a Christmas party tonight and for something that I had all the ingredients so I didn't have to go to the store.... these fit the bill!  After reading the other reviews here are the changes I made:  I also used 10-slices of real bacon, drained and crumbled.  I added a big handful of shredded cheddar cheese ("mexican blend") and a dash of garlic powder (plus the onion and black pepper called for in the recipe).  I did not have any crescent rolls so I used the small 10-count refrigerator biscuits.  I pinched each biscuit in half and put them in my mini-muffin pan and pressed them up the sides of each muffin cup.  I put the cheese/bacon filling in one of my cake decorating disposable bags and cut off the tip and squeezed a big dollop of filling into each biscuit cup.  Baked for about 12 minutes until the biscuits looked done.... VERY YUMMY!!!  I will definitely make these again.  Thanks, Holli!

Really good except I used real bacon and crumbled, less onion, and 1/3 cup shredded parmesan cheese for the filling.  I also brushed the top of the crescents with melted butter and sprinkled with poppy seeds.  So good warm!!!

I liked these but my daughter and boyfriend did not (I think they just didn't like the cresant dough? Perhaps phyllo dough might change their minds?) I took "Linda Mclean's" advice: Used real bacon, added a dash of onion/garlic powder and some parsley.  Might try these again to see if my family will give them a second chance. Thanks anyways Holli!

Very yummy, a great little bite-sized appetizer. Made for our Christmas party. I actually prepared all of the "big" rolls the night before and refrigerated them overnight. This made slicing them SO easy the next day because they weren't as squishy. Also, make sure you put them about 1" to 1 1/2" apart and definitely make sure the baking tray is lightly greased (I forgot and it wasn't a good result). I will probably make these again.

I had friends and family back to the house after my daughters' recital and these little appetizers were loved by all. I too used real bacon and I also seasoned my cream cheese with garlic and onion powders and a little parsley. Next time I might try sausage and use Italian seasonings in the cream cheese. Thanks Holli for a very easy and delicious recipe!

Pretty good, but the bacon:cream cheese ratio was way too high. I used a little less bacon and a litttle more cream cheese and they turned out very nicely. Not very pretty, but tasty!

A 5 star winner, hands down.  Holli, have you ever considered entering this in the Pilsbury bake-off contest?  I'll bet this would have a chance at winning!  I used real bacon, and myself and my guests loved it.  It's easy, and I most certainly will be making it again.  Kudos, Holli!

This recipe can be made much faster using the new crescent refrigerated flaky dough sheet's...finally,  NO pinching together seam's !!!!  it's a dream come true !  There is no end to what you can do with them.

Don't pass these up just because of a few bad reviews.  Follow some of the other reviewer's advice and use real bacon instead of bacon bits (which I refer to as a dirty word), add garlic powder to the cream cheese, and freeze for about 20-30 minutes before slicing.  These are great, easy, and affordable.  I've also sprinkled some with cheddar cheese, but you couldn't really taste it much because most of it melted out, so I wouldn't recommend that.  However, give these a shot, making a few changes, and you'll have happy guests!

This was a great recipe!  It took me a little longer on the prep time (appx. 10 minutes), and I rolled the dough up into two sections, making two logs.  This made small bite-size pieces.  I made this for my Sunday School class, and they loved it!

These are great! Since I was serving them with lots of other appetizers at a recent poker party, I made them with phyllo rather than the crescent rolls. They turned out tasty, light and crispy.

This was very good. I used real bacon rather than pre-packaged bacon bits.  I had this as an appetizer for a family dinner and everyone wanted the recipe!

I made this for a take along appetizer to Thanksgiving dinner, It was a huge hit. I rolled the dough up into two sections, thus making two thinner logs and slicing 1/2" thick.  The one tip I would give is to refrigerate the logs before slicing to make it neater and easier to slice. I used real bacon drained and diced as I don't care for the 'bits'. I did add some fresh garlic, mozzarella and parmesan cheese for a more grown up taste.  I look forward to trying it again without my additions. I will make this recipe again and again, thank you for submitting it.

I really liked this recipe. Instead of bacon I used Jimmy Dean sausage browned and crumbled. I also used the softened cream cheese with onions and chives in it. It's a lot less work and they came out great.

I halved the recipe, used 3 strips of bacon, added some grated carrot, chopped parsley and green onion, and sun dried tomato (some of these additional items for color).  These little pinwheels are good (and easy), but I think they need a little more seasoning in the filling.  Salt for sure and maybe a little chopped garlic.

These bacon cream cheese puffs are so simple and delish. I'm packing finger foods for my SO as he heads on a cross country trip this afternoon, and these are clean to eat and bite size, a def must if you're driving.  I halved the recipe. I used one container of crescent rolls, 4 oz of cream cheese (1/2 box), about 1.5 oz real bacon pieces, some minced onion, and fresh ground pepper.  I do recommend, as with dough you play with, dust some flour on your board and try to keep the dough as cold as possible. I sliced these into really thin bites with a butcher's knife, and they rise into perfect 2 bite pieces.

I was shocked at how good these came out. I did change a few things. I used real bacon and then I sauted the onions in some of the bacon grease until they were carmelized. I also added a little garlic powder to the mixture then sprinkled the tops with a little mild cheddar cheese and parsley. Winner at a cocktail party

I was making Jet Swirl Pizza Appetizers (also on this site) as the same time so I substituted refrigerated pizza dough for the crescent roll dough.  It is easier to use and we like the texture better. I also added some chopped sundried tomatoes.  Yum!

Very easy to make and very tasty.  You really can't go wrong with bacon, though. I, too, used some real bacon. I think I cut them a little big though, because it took longer than 15 min to bake.

I brought these treats to work for a potluck and they were the first things gone!  EVERYONE wanted the recipe.  I almost didn't want to tell them how easy they were to make.  I will also add a half packet of dry ranch dressing mix in the future for a little added zing. Great recipe.

Very yummy. Made these for a party and they were gone before I even got to taste one. Everyone loved them so we went out and bought stuff to make a second batch and they went just as quick.

Had my (pre-teen) daughters make these for a New Year's eve party.  They followed the recipe to a "T"...except it called for a 12 oz. jar of bacon bits...I figured it must be a typo and had them use 4.5 oz. for a double recipe.  They not only made the whole house smell wonderful while they were baking...they taste just like I hoped they would.  Five stars in my book!  Next time I'll use real bacon and add some extra cheese.  I'll be bringing this to more gatherings for sure!

I make these slightly different. I pull apart the crescent sections then cut each in half. I spread them  with onion and chive cream cheese mixed crumbled bacon. Then I roll them up into mini crescent rolls and bake. Delicious.

I made this snack tonight. I used chives and onion cream cheese and pre-cooked bacon and it was wonderful. Everyone loved them and I loved how easy they were to make! Thanks for the great recipe!

I make these, but with one can of flaked ham in place of the bacon, herb and garlic cream cheese, parmsean cheese, green onion, and sometimes jalepenos. 
Also with salmon cream cheese and canned salmon. All are very good!

My husband called this Bacon Happiness, and has asked for it since!  These were a big hit at a party we had.  It was the first item gone, and everyone wanted the recipe.  I will definately make these again.  Very yummy and easy to make.

This has a great base, but is a little bland. I used real bacon and crumbled it up. I also increased the onion to 3/4 cup, added 1/2 clove garlic and sprinkled freshly chopped chives over the top. My 2 year old loved them!

This recipe is a good concept, but the flavor needs to be kicked up.  I caramelized the onions, added garlic and Parmesan cheese, and next time I would add even more seasoning.  I also found that they took more than 15 minutes to brown at 350 degrees.  I like the idea and will definitely try this again!

These are really good warm. I served them at a party and they were a BIG HIT! 

I have also altered this to make it easier by using onion and chive cream cheese instead of cream cheese and onions seperately.

I had some major trouble with these.  I agree with many other reviewers, way too much bacon.  I only used two 4.4 oz containers of bacon bits and followed everything else exactly and it was all bacon.  The exact words from the party were "I feel like I am eating bacon bits by the handful." If you try these, you should definitely half the bacon, double the cream cheese and, please, use real bacon.  I think that is the true key.  Hope this helps.

In making this I thought it was WAY too much bacon and it would be too overpowering.  So I added shredded cheddar cheese and chives to the mix.  My guests LOVED this, asked me for the recipe and took the leftovers home!

These were great...I used 2 pkgs of cream cheese, green onions and added shredded sharp cheddar cheese.  Best right out of the oven.

My  2 1/2 year old son is so picky and wont eat much these days, but he ate these up.  So did my fiance and a family friend.  Left out the onions. I will make these again for a fam gathering so everyone can "love" them.

These are simple and can be varied to your taste. Instead of onion/pepper, I mixed real bacon and Lipton Onion Soup Mix into the cream cheese. They were gone within ten minutes and people were surprised at how simple they were to make.

These were okay, but I think the recipe calls for way too much bacon. I could not taste the cheese at all. I halved the recipe and used a 4.5 oz jar of Hormel bacon pieces and it was just all bacon. I also added some fresh parsley to give it some color. However, my fiancee really liked these and asked me to make them again so I will, but next time I will use real bacon and taste the spread as I go!

These were a hit at a neighborhood BBQ.  I used Herb & Garlic Cream Cheese (other flavours would be tasty and I'll try those next)and used real bacon.  I agree that they are at their best when they are still warm.  Yummy!

My guests and family LOVED these.  I added garlic powder to the cream cheese and used bacon and sauteed onions as suggested by one reviewer.  I also added a little chopped red pepper (I was already using in another recipe) with the onions.  Made this way it is a 5 star recipe and I think it would work equally as well as a brunch item or appetizer.  Very yummy, would be good with sausage as well.  I would suggest making it ahead and letting it chill as a log to make it easier to slice into circles.  Very easy to make.  Thank you for the recipe and the review that made it better!

These were delicious and pretty easy.  I brought them to a party and they went very fast.  I did add some shredded cheddar cheese and used real bacon instead of bacon bits.  Someone suggested adding a little hot sauce for extra flavor.  Will definitely make again.

These were very good and SO easy.  I used less onion and fresh bacon.  Also, I halved each roll of crescent dough to make smaller logs and smaller "bites."  They were full of flavor, and next time I'll use even more bacon because, well, I like bacon.

I made this recipe this weekend and it was wonderful !!  It was easy to put together, although I would advise using a mixer to blend the ingredients and make sure to leave the cresent rolls in the fridge until you're ready to use them.  I left them out and they were really soft, so when I tried to spread the stuffing on them I had to be really careful.  These were a big hit the night I made them as well as the next day at the beach.

I followed the recipe exactly and they were rather blah.  I will say that the next day, I packed them in the lunch boxes and they tasted better.  Nothing spectacular.

The only change I made was to use real bacon but I had a hard time figuring out how many slices would make up a jar of bacon bits.  Very good, but next time I will follow the advise of other reviewers and add some garlic.

These were so good. Course being a baker, I had to change it some. I didn't have cresent rolls, so I substituted  puff pastry. I used regular  crumbled bacon and added four cloves of roasted garlic. And the crowd went wild. Thanks

YUM! These were a very nice treat. I made just a few changes to my batch, though: I, like many others, used real bacon and crumbled it. Instead of using cream cheese and diced onions I used an onion & cream cheese spread (b/c that's all I had on hand) and I added a good shake or two of garlic salt, as well as  grated parmesan cheese like other reviewers mentioned. Thanks for a great recipe!

They were pretty tasty, but they weren't exceptional.  If you're looking for quick, easy and very good, these fit the bill.  If you love to wow your guests (my goal is to blow the socks off of my guests), you might want to keep looking.

I made these for a friend's birthday and they got gobbled up in about 10 minutes. Did make one change and spread the mix over one package of rolls and then used the other package as a top, sandwiching the filling in between.

a little bland, but 3 stars for ease of preparation.  However, I used bacon bits and this might make a world of difference.

I thought this recipe was okay, but everyone else seemed to really like them. I used one 4.4 oz container of bacon bits and you could barely see the cream cheese. I couldn't image using nearly 3 containers to equal the 12 oz that the recipe calls for.

This is a very good recipe.  I didn't rate it higher because I didn't care much for the crescent roll dough.  The fillingas terrific though.  I will make them again but try with another type of dough.

Very easy and very yummy. The first time j made this I followed the recipe to the tee. The second I used the same measurements but only one pack of biscuits and no onion. I felt that the second time came out a lot better. Personally, my guests and I did not think there was enough filling the first time. The second, it was perfect!

Very Tasty.  My husband loves them, and a batch is off to a Super Bowl Party today.  It would be easy to add a little chopped jalapeno if you wanted to add a little kick.

Winner, winner - very good and easy.  I also used real bacon, (8 thick slices chopped small and cooked.  I had on hand Laughing Cow Garlic & Herb Cheese wedges (yum) added 1/4 cup of low fat cream cheese.  No need for onion or seasoning.  I also had 1/2 c shaved Parmesan cheese and sprinkled the shaved pieces before rolling.   Thank you, the possibilities are endless, and the dough sheets are great!  THANK YOU

Very very good. Easy to prepare. At first I was shocked at how little the circles were when you cut them. Of course they puffed up but I still thought they were going to be bigger. The size they ended up being was perfect size for a couple of bites just as an appetizer should be. Don't increase the onion as it was just perfect. Dividing the mixture was perfect also for 2 crescent rolls pkgs. I pinched the triangles together and did roll it out just to smooth it. I also was able to roll it up nice with my nonstick roll mat like you would a pumpkin roll.

What a delicious little morsel!  I used real crumbled bacon pieces and garlic butter flavored crescent rolls, and they were fantastic!  I also added a sprinkling of shredded parmesan cheese before rolling the dough up into logs. I didn't slice them in 1/4 inch slices either, more like 3/4 to 1 inch thick.  I would make these for company, they would be a great appetizer.

Great little savory appetizers.  The cream cheese is simply a nice vehicle for spreading the other flavors all over.  Notes: I used a shallot instead of onion, as that's what I had on hand, and also used packaged bacon "pieces" instead of fake flavored bits.

I like this recipe but I tweaked it a lil to mine and my family's own tatse..I def agree to use real bacon but I used the precooked kind bc it was easier.Also I use flaky biscuits instead and pull them apart making two biscuits.I then line them in a mini muffin pan for individual serving.  For a diff flavor I use scallions and a lil ceyenne pepper(to taste)TY for such a good and flexible recipe!!

I wasn't sure what to expect for the texture of the cracker after cooking in bacon grease.  But after the first one I was hooked.  What's not to like?  I did as another reviewer suggested by using aluminum foil under a slotted upper rack to allow the grease to drain off.  I did  sprinkle a little cayenne pepper on top before cooking to get that sweet, salty, spicy combo!  My boyfriend took them to work and had to limit everyone to just 2 because they were disappearing FAST!

I can't get crescent roll dough in the Uk, so I used pizza dough instead. I added some garlic powder and parsley to the cream cheese mix as suggested by other reviewers and used real bacon. They soon disappeared. Thanks.

I combined the cream cheese with a packet of hidden valley ranch mix and a 1/2 cup of shredded cheddar.  I omitted the onion and only used 1 jar of bacon bits (I think the amout listed is a misprint)

LOVE these!  I, however, don't believe in such a thing as "too much bacon".  :-)  These go fast at parties and don't require tons of work.  Yum!

Not bad. My guests really liked these, but I agree that the recipe, as is, calls for far too much bacon. I would probably cut the bacon amount in half next time.

This was not a good recipe. No one would eat them. The onion was very strong, too strong. And they tasted like they were missing something. If I ever tried to make these again, I would sprinkle shredded cheddar cheese after spreading cream cheese mixture onto croissants. However, this was a very easy recipe to make.

Made the roll ahead of time.  Put it in the fridge and then cut and cooked it just before I served it.  Turned out great.

Used the Boars Head precooked bacon and they were great, quick, and plentiful!

Loved the cream cheese and onion flavor. I preferred less bacon, instead using spinach and a little cheddar. Just my personal tastes, my husband loved the bacon. Great base recipe for baked crescent roll pinwheels!

These were delicious!  I did add a sprinkling of shredded light cheddar cheese, and a teaspoon of a dry roasted red pepper and garlic dip mix (by Wildtree Herbs). Easy, fast appetizer recipe.  I'll be making these pinwheels again.
