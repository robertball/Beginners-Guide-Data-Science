This is very good!  We added it to our Super Bowl spread last year, and had no guilt about eating it.  I did sprinkle some grated parmesan over the dip prior to serving.  A definite keeper.

I like this dip a lot...very good with corn tortilla chips. It didn't look too thick to me when it was finished simmering. But it thickened up in the refrigerator. Good flavor. Thanks for the recipe!

Wouldn't call this a pizza dip; maybe a glorified thick tomato sauce. It is what it is, but certainly nothing what the recipe title suggests.

We added some velvetta and cheddar cheese to it and used it for chip dip. Turned out great.  Thanks for the recipe.

It was pretty good, not very exciting though.  I little too chunky for my taste.

I added a little more spice and served with crackers and also had a cheese ball on the table and the mixture of this with a cheese ball was a huge hit.  All the ladies asked for the recipe and requested a make it again.

This recipe was a bit disappointing. It tasted like tomatoes and we had to simmer it for an extra 10 minutes. Wouldn't try again.

This recipe was bland, so I added 1 tsp. of Italian seasoning and cooked it 5 minutes longer.  My family loved it.  We served it with pita and grated parmesean.
