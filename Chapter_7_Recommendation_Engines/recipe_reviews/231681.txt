Easy and delicious. Lots of opportunity for personalization in the future. Most ingredients are already in the kitchen, a BIG plus.

This was just what 3 stars indicates:  ok.  It was perfectly easy and well balanced, but nothing about it stood out for us.  I very much appreciated the ease of preparation; this was on the table in less than 20 minutes.  I think this is a good jumping off point to personalize it a bit per your personal tastes.  THANKS, damialyon!

I liked it, I think was very easy and didn't take long.  I added a pinch of cayenne.....just to do it.  I'll make this again, just need to remember DON'T COOK THE SHRIMP LONG BEFORE ADDING MORE INGREDIENTS!!  I always do it and overcook the shrimp.

I liked this quick recipe. I used coconut oil instead of sesame. I also substituted a cup of chicken bullion instead of chicken stock. We loved it. thanks

It was just ok. I knew by looking at it, that it wasn’t going to have much zing so I added additional garlic and pepper flakes. I was looking for something quick and it was but I wouldn’t make again.

This worked great for me since I always have frozen stir fry veggies on hand.  I added about an inch of grated ginger root, and don't add the shrimp till 3-4 minutes before the sauce is done!

This was a very simple and great recipe!  I actually substituted Coconut Aminos for Soy Sauce (due to a no-soy 30-day cleanse I am currently on) and it was 'ok'.  We needed to add more Coconut Aminos and salt & pepper, but then it was pretty tasty!   I truly appreciated how quick it was to make!  Just needed a bit more flavor for our tastes.

This recipe lends itself to all sorts of personalized changes. I use fresh vegetables, including lots of broccoli, red peppers, mushrooms, and celery. I also add  pineapple and toasted cashews. The flavors pop!

I made it according to the recipe but I added 1 teaspoon of ground ginger and some chopped onion which really gave it a little kick. Are used rice noodles which were really good! I also made Costco egg rolls with it it was a great dinner. I also doubled my recipe because are used a lot of shrimp.

I made it tonight, and I've made it many times. One thing I add is fresh sea scallops. I use around 1/2 pound of each, it makes it even more delicious. You can also top it off with fresh chopped basil and cheese as you plate it. Great dish

I made this last night. I opted for frozen gulf shrimp and frozen veggies and it was still good and a lot easier. For the sauce, I made some variations. I didn't have garlic cloves to mince, but I just used garlic powder (converted). I also added ginger seasoning and red pepper flakes.

I liked because it didn't have the typical Chinese food saltiness and the ease of the recipe.  However, I agree it needs a little tweaking.

It was easy and quite good. I added some chile garlic sauce for more flavor and red pepper flakes for added spice. I'd suggest cooking the veggies a bit less before putting in the shrimp as they were a bit overcooked when it was all done.

As Liesl said, this recipe is very easy to add your own touches to. Basic is sometimes best in my eyes so that you can flavor yourself. I added garlic powder and Tony's to my liquid mixture, and sauteed onions and garlic in coconut oil before adding vegetables and shrimp...I added hoisen sauce and a tiny bit of sesame seed oil. I also added red pepper flakes for a little kick!! Huge hit for my husband and I.

Great recipe, quick and flexible.   I added some fresh ginger, sauté the ginger with the veggies otherwise it will be overpowering.  The dish was vey tasty and easy cleanup.
