I made as is and would tweak the next time.  I did add 1 Tablespoon flour to apricots because I had some very juicy ones.  I would add almond extract to the apricots next time and maybe some nuts to the topping.

This is such a nice, easy, and delicious recipe! I added about 1/2 teaspoon of almond extract and some flour to the apricots as one of the other members suggested. I also added cinnamon to the topping. Our house smelled fantastic! The fruit was soft and sweet and the crispy topping was a nice contrast with the fruit. We'll be using this recipe quite often in the future.

This was delicious! I used GF all purpose flour and turned out great!  Next time I will make a bit more crumble for the top as it barely covered my apricots as I used more than 4 cups because I needed to use up my remaining apricots:)

This was really good, but next time I would use 4 cups apricots with 2 tablespoons sugar and then put it in a 8 by 8 pan with half amount of topping to give a better fruit to topping ratio.

This was good. I used maple granola from Trader Joe's for the oats. I put the apricots cut side up, I wonder how it would turn out with brown sugar on the bottom and apricots cut side down over it---pineapple upside down cake style?

Making this recipe, I was a bit leery of how well it would turn out. No cinnamon? Just six ingredients? No way could it be as good as the other reviewers said it was. WRONG. This was incredible. My husband could not stop raving about this dessert. Apricots are not our favorite fruit, but with this recipe, they very well could become our fave! I am not overstating how good this was. 
I hate it when people change and modify a recipe, then give it a rating on that. The only modifications I did were add a tablespoon of flour to the cut up apricots before putting them in the pan (as suggested by another reviewer to help the juices thicken up) and I used about 1/8 of a cup white sugar to sprinkle over the apricots first. The topping was perfect, no cinnamon was needed. This was tart, sweet, and really brought out the flavor of the apricots. I have added this one to our family book of favorites. Thanks, Miriam!

I enjoyed the flavor of the fruit,sugar, butter, etc.  I will use this part of the recipe in the future. 

I am going to find another topping recipe (sugar, flour, butter,oats, etc.

I didnt use all the white sugar the recipe called for. 
I added chopped pecans. 
I combined it with a scoop of vanila icecream.
It is WONDERFUL!
I just wish I cut the apricots in quarters so that they are easier to bite with the crisp chunks.
What a treat!

Wow!! I've made this twice: once with apricots off our neighbor's tree, and again when peaches came into season.  I use half the amount of white sugar, max.  The crumbly topping is almost exactly the crumbly topping on my mom's strawberry rhubarb pie - I.e.  one of the best things in the world.   I'm tempted to try with pear next!

My hubby and I both did not like this, and I am an apricot enthusiast. I would double the crisp topping, and eugh the fruit tasted so strong!

Tasted good.  Added 1Tb flour to apricots, but it still was soupy and the crisp sank so overall kinda of a waste of fresh apricots.  Would not make again.

I liked this and will make it again.  However, BEWARE THE  AMOUNT OF BROWN SUGAR. The MAJOR  change I made is the amount of sugar.  This recipe calls for 3/4 c. of brown sugar in the topping. That seemed incredibly high so I checked a recipe I have for  a cranberry apple crisp which I make often.  That  recipe calls for only TWO tablespoons  packed brown sugar.  I can't imagine what this crisp would  taste like with 3/4 c.  of brown sugar.  I assume it would overpower the apricots and be way to sweet for my taste.  In terms of butter, I used the microwave to melt it rather than than cut it in.   Faster and easier.   I also followed the suggestions of others and added the almond extract and the flour and doubled the topping.

Amazing although I used Honey-Nut granola instead of the rolled oats and it turned out delish! I put the brown sugar, flour, and butter in the food processor and then added the granola afterward to top the quartered apricots, then added more granola over the top. I baked in an 8x8 Pyrex for 30 min and it was perfect! Topped it with French Vanilla ice cream and it was an absolute hit!

I made it exactly as written and it tasted great, but had too much liquid.  I read other reviews later and wish I’d added the flour for thickening.  I’ll do that next time and am sure it will be a better consistency.  I served it warm with a little scoop of vanilla-Carmel ice cream.  Perfect together!

Wet gloppy mess. I even tossed the fruit in extra flour to absorb moisture. This did not get crispy, just a mushy dish of mush.

Made this with fresh apricots from my backyard tree. Followed recipe exactly, with gluten free oats and flour. It was fabulous! A little less sugar would be ok. Will definitely make again!

I agree that more of the oat/flour topping is better and a 1/2 tsp of almond extract added to the flavor.  I also increased the apricots to 6 cups was better as well.

It was really easy to make and I actually used my food processor to make the topping which made it quick as well.  I added almond extract and sliced almonds to the topping as suggested in earlier reviews.  My apricots were quite tart so it was perfect with a scoop of ice cream. My husband and I ate the whole tray in less than 2 days!
