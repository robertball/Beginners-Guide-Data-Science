We liked all the fresh vegetables and the meat was flavorful. I did have to add 2 cups of beef broth because the barley soaked up the liquid even though it cooked for less time then required. ( 6 and 1/2 hours.)  We also tried the spicy version and it was a bit too spicy for everyone in my family.  I would definitely make the stew again. Next time, I will add 2 cups of beef broth and use just the tomatoes with the garlic.

This was very flavorful compared to other beef stews that I have tried! I didn't have V8 juice so I substituted with beef broth. I doubled the amount of liquid to 24 oz bc I wanted more liquid in the soup. I didn't add mushrooms either and there was some liquid left but not a whole lot. Great recipe, thanks!

This turned out to be more of a stew than a soup, which I actually personally prefer, but if you want soup you will need to add more liquid.  I made this as written, although the only tomatoes with garlic I could find were fire-roasted, but it still worked out well.  This was great to leave in the crockpot all day Sunday while we worked outside and then come back in to a warm meal.  I served it with Cheddar Cheese Muffins from this site.  The leftovers re-heated well.

Making this for the second time as we speak. I added 4 cups of stock made with Better than Bullion. Added a few small diced potatoes, left out the corn, peppers and mushrooms. I made this on my stove with browning the beef, removed it, added the veggies to soften, the added the rest. The seasoning are spot on. It will simmer for an hour till the barley is cooked and the beef tender.

As others said, the recipe as is turns out like a stew. If I made it again, I would replace the tomato sauce with tomato juice. I cooked on low for 10 hrs and some of my cubed potatoes were a bit al dente.  Would cook longer next time.
