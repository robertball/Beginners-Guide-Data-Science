This is such an awesome recipe!  I did some simple modifications and it was a hit at Thanksgiving (The proof was in all of the leftover pumpkin pie that year!)  First I used a store bought espresso I found in the coffee section of my supermarket.  Then because I love macadamia nuts, I chopped them and spread them over the caramel layer.  I also use two different ice cream flavors- chocolate and coffe, and I spread more of the espresso sauce in between those layers.  Finally I top it off with more of the chopped macadamia nuts and serve it with whipped cream.  Make sure you cut the slices thin because this is rich- but absolutely heavenly!!

I wanted to make this recipe for a few reasons. First, I loved that it was labor intensive and completely from scratch. Second, the last review is a few years old and there is no photo of this recipe yet. I pretty much followed the recipe as written. For the chocolate cookies, I used Oreos, which I chopped finely in my blender. The caramel sauce turned out nice and creamy. For the fudge I realized I was out of Karo syrup as I was making it so I made a homemade verision. The espresso fudge is amazing, don't substitute or leave out the espresso! For the vanilla ice cream, I made homemade vanilla ice cream using a David Lebovitz recipe. On top of the last fugde layer on top of the ice cream I added Godiva 85% chocolate shavings then I piped on homemade whipped cream and added cherries. Turned out fantastic!

Maybe Im not as advanced as the other cooks who have rated this recipe.  Though the finished product tasted outstanding, the process was not easy.  I melted my spatula into the caramel sauce and had to re-do that part.  I forgot how hot the stuff was so when I put water in the pan I had to throw out, it splattered all over and burned my toes!  I know that mistake was purely do to my haste.  The part Im still not sure of is the last layer of fudge sauce over the ice cream.  It solidified before I could spread it over the whole pie.  Also, when I went to cut the pie, the top layer of fudge stuck to my knife instead of the pie.  Maybe I didnt freeze the ice cream long enough and cool the fudge off enough.  I hope that helps the next cook.  I still recommend the recipe cuz no matter what it looked like served up, I was sooooooo tasty!

The taste was great, but I had to double the Espresso Fudge Sauce recipe, because it wasn't enough for two layers.

This is my husband's favorite dessert.  Last Superbowl Sunday, he even offered to go to the store for me to get ice cream if I would make this pie.  One note:  I had a really hard time with the caramel sauce and the crystals.  I read to add a few drops of lemon juice to the water/suger and it would keep the crystals from forming on top.  This is a rich but EXCELLENT dessert!

The end result is very tasty, but it is not as easy as it sounds. This is a time consuming recipe because you have to continue freezing the dessert between layers, so allow plenty of time. I initially used a coated pan to make the caramel sauce and the sauce did not darken and eventually crystalized, so I had to start over. Also, my springform pan did not fit into my freezer (I have a split fridge/freezer), so I had to rotate the dessert during the freezing process to ensure that the liquid did not roll to one side and freeze.

I have to say, this recipe is FANTAB! I love to bring pies to my Bible Study and my fellow worshipers thought it was fantastic. I added crunched up Samoa Girl Scout Cookies (Be Prepared!) in the fudge layer. It was excellent. Recommended.

We all love  this recipe in the family- and it can satisfy the gluten free in our family by just using gluten free chocolate cookies for the crust. One caution I learned last night though. When making the caramel sauce, use a pan that has no copper bottom. Two attempts (and almost 2 hours later) at caramelizing the sugar failed miserably until it struck me to try a pan with no copper bottom. Presto - worked beautifully. (and way quicker!) There's obviously some chemical reaction occurring that hindered the process!

I make extra jars of the espresso fudge sauce just for ice cream sundaes when the pie is gone! They're a great Christmas gift as well and all of our friends ask for jars too! Thanks so much for the great recipe!

This was excellent.  We had it on Christmas Eve as a 'Birthday Cake for Jesus' and the kids agreed that it would probably be His favorite too.  :)
Next time I will make it without the coffee, though.

Good recipe, had problems with the Caramel sauce. I would recommend the author put temperatures in for the making of that particular item. Overall delish and will try again with a few modifications.

We love this! I usually use coffee ice cream, but all varieties work. We also make homemade whipping cream (whipping cream & sugar) and put that on top. It is sinful. Just delish!  Thanks for the recipe... it is to die for :)

Delish!  It is so rich, I decided to use only half the caramel and half the fudge, using the fudge on top only. I substituted slow churned coffee ice cream for the vanilla and I cut the butter in half on the crust and the chocolate fudge.   Also, edged the pie in crushed, raw almonds.  So now you can have your cake (pie) and eat it, too!

Great tasting recipe, my crust came out to crumbly, next time I will use more butter to help keep it together.  Also a good trick to making caramel sauce is to use a pinch of Cream of Tarter after the sugar has dissolved and before it begins to boil, It will keep the sugar from recrystallizing if you have that issue going on.
