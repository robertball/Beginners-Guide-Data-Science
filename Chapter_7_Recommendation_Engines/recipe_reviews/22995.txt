This is a recipe I have made every Christmas for the past 23 years I have been married, and was handed from my Grandmother before that.  It is a "must" at the holidays, and will keep in the freezer, ready to be sliced, for months!

I've been making this Christmas "cookie" ever since I was teeny-tiny. This recipe works with almost any kind of grahams you have on hand and it really dosen't have to be colored marshmallows. It's really up to you. I do suggest you don't chinze out and use cheap sweetened condensed milk because you'll have issues getting it to come together and for me, it just dosen't taste the same. This is also good if you use half coconut/half chopped pecans to roll the log in OR add about a half cup to the marshmallow mixture.

Didn't go as fast as I expected it to. Just wasn't to my family's liking.

This is what my mom made every year for my birthday parties (but without the nuts and cheeries!).  I have a bag of coloured marshmallows and decided to make some for my little girl but couldn't find the recipe.  Thanks for posting it!

I did not have high expectations for this recipe and I am so glad I was wrong! My niece and her two daughters absolutely loved this and I did too. I used white marshmallows and maraschino cherries because that's what I had. Thanks for sharing this addictive recipe!

This was one of my favorite recipes as a child and now I make it every holiday season. A big hit in our home.  The only thing I changed was reduced the amount of nuts in half.
