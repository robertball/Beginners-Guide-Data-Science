this is a great recipe. Changed it slightly. I used the Boboli dough and cooked it with no toppings on it for about 5-8 minutes. This made the crust nice and crispy in the middle. Then while the pizza dough cooled down i cooked cut up chicken with teriyaki sauce in a pan on the stove. Be careful not to burn the teriyaki sauce (since it has so much sugar in it). When the chicken was almost done, i added the pineapple juice and chunks. I didnt want to overcook the pineapple. While the chicken was cooking in a separate pan i cooked up a whole onion, sauteed it in a little oil. Then when everything was cooked i layed it the following:
1. Teriyaki sauce
2. Grilled onions
3. Cheese (used shredded mozzarella and a mexican blend.)
4. Added the chicken  & pineapple
5. put a little more cheese on top

baked it for about 10 minutes

My boyfriend wont stop talking about how good it was.

Fabulous!!!  I added too much teriyaki sauce, so it was a bit salty, so beware that "a thin layer" really does mean a thin layer.  I cooked the chicken all the way through before adding to the pizza and it was still tender!  I also forgot to add the pineapple (oops!) but I added sweet red pepper which was delicious!  Also I would recommend a sweet, red onion because I didn't think that was overpowering at all!!!  I would highly recommend this recipe!
Addendum: After making this recipe for awhile, this is still a family favorite!  I use Pillsbury pizza crust, cook it at 450 for 7 minutes without toppings, then add the toppings (fully cooked chicken, raw onion, raw red peppers, pineapple, sauce, cheddar cheese, mozzerella cheese) and cook at 350 for about 15 minutes until the cheese is bubbly.  The lower temperature allows the veggies to cook.  I use the Kikkoman Baste and Glaze teriyaki sauce, which works perfectly!

WoW!!!! Very yummy pizza! It's different but soooo good! I used Emeril's teriyaki/ginger sauce and I added a cup of that to the marinating chicken/pineapple juice. I also set out a dipping bowl of Emeril's BBQ sauce and a bowl of the leftover teriyaki/ginger sauce for dipping. Oh man, this is a definite keeper! I am going to use the chicken/teriyaki marinade on the chicken for other dishes as well (maybe a teriyaki stir-fry...hehe). The chicken was SO yummy and tender!!! Thanks for a yummy new meal to add to my rotation!

This was pretty good. Better than I had expected. Next time I would use crushed pineapple and more chicken though!

For pizza, this wasn't our favorite. I used 3/4 cup of teriyaki sauce and it was still overwhelming and salty. I put leftover cooked chicken I had on top and left off the feta cheese (my husband's not a fan). I used half of a regular onion and put it all on the following whole wheat dough recipe: Amazing Whole Wheat Pizza Crust. I would definitely lessen the teriyaki sauce and make it a very thin crust; otherwise it's either too salty or too dry.

Great! I tried it last night, and both my girlfriend and I loved it! I did change it a little. We used three small crusts and took out the onion (she likes onion, but I do not). Also, we used about 12 oz. of fresh pineapple, cut up quite small. I cooked the chicken, then added some teriyaki and pineapple to cook it all together. Very tasty!!

This was absolutely delicious. I was worried about the feta cheese tasting strange - but it was very tasty.  I'll definitely make this again.

Very good- I omitted the sweet onion and instead spinkled the top with green onion for color and also sprinkled top with cashews- the presentation is a litlle prettier this way, though it really didn't change the flavor.

Wow! This was tasty! I omitted the onions, used fresh pineapple, and added sliced red bell peppers. I also didn't prebake the crust, jut popped it all in the oven at 400 and let it go for 20 minutes. THe only problem with this recipe is that I ate way too much!

Delicious!  This was fast and easy.  I used red onion and crushed pineapple as recommended by other raters.  I often make homemade pizza and this recipe will definitely be something I make again and again!

this was good but I thought it was a bit lacking. I carmalized the onion to give it a bit more flavor.

Very good.  Based on other reviews, I used teriyaki glaze.  I added extra pineapple and cilantro.   The sweetness of the extra pineapple cut some of the saltiness of the teriyaki.   The whole family liked it.  It's a nice addition to our other pizzas.

I almost left off the feta cheese, because it sounded gross, but I  used it, and loved it!  Nice change from a regular pizza.  Very good.

So, So GOOD!!!  We don't care for Feta, so I left it off.  I also didn't saute the chicken.  Delicious!!  This one is in our pizza rotation.  Thanks for the recipe.

This was a big hit at home. Sounds strange, but the flavors are excellent together, if you like teriyaki. I added more chicken which I cooked in teriyaki sauce and shredded. I found the crust didn't need to be cooked as long the second time and since the I precooked the chicken I didn't have to worry about raw chicken. An excellent recipe we will be making again! Thanks!

So yummy!  All the different flavors really concerned me, but it is delicious.  I used the Kikkoman teriyaki basting sauce and used a very thin layer.  I was so afraid it wouldn't be enough, because I like things 'saucy'.  However, it was perfect.  It is so such a salty sauce, you don't really need much.  I also substituted green onions.  Overall, an excellent recipe that I will be repeating!

This recipe totally shocked me.  It was amazing all I did was leave off the onions as I don't like them and I forgot to pick up feta cheese.  Will have to make again with the feta cheese.  It was even better the next day as flavors have mixed.

Very good! My husband LOVED it! We will definitely make this again. I will probably add a bit more garlic next time...and I followed another review and only put a very thin layer of teriyaki sauce on--I will definitely put more on the pizza next time. I used Pillsbury pizza dough--just one 13 oz. package--and it was great. Thank you for the great recipe!

I baked the crust @450 for 7 minutes prior to adding the toppings and will NOT do that again. The crust came out really too crisp for our liking.  We weren't too keen on the flavor of the feta cheese (even though we both like feta). We'll use a combo of mozzarella and cheddar cheeses next time and just put everything on the crust and bake for 20 minutes.  

I guess I want this to taste like my fav pizza in town, but was disappointed when it didn't. We'll try again though.

2nd try: This was more to our taste likings and the crust came out perfect this time.
Changes from original recipe:
Used crushed pineapple, cut the chicken into very small pieces, used 1/2 cup Kikkoman Teriyaki Baste & Glaze on EACH pizza, used 1/2 small onion, added some chopped red pepper, substituted mozzarella cheese for fetta. I did NOT pre-bake crust; just rolled it out on the sheet, spread the sauce, added 1/2 of the cheeses, cooked chicken, vegies & pineapple then the rest of the cheeses. Baked @ 400 degrees for 20 minutes. Perfect!

Absolutely delicious.  I make my own pizza crust so I added all of the toppings at once and cooked it for 15 minutes.  I loved the feta cheese on this.

I thought this was pretty good, a nice change from traditional pizza.  I did make a few changes, based on reviews I read:  I used a dry packaged crust and make it according to the pkg. directions and did make it thin.  I baked it first.  I used a teriyaki glaze, not sauce, as well as crushed pineapple.  I sauteed the onions for a bit and mixed the marinated chicken with them before adding to the pizza.  I omitted the feta.

Delicious!  I was a little surprised at the addition of feta cheese (didn't seem to fit with the rest of the recipe) but the outcome was great!  I didn't marinate the chicken in the fridge for an hour (too crunched for time!) and that turned out fine.  I also added some of the teriyaki sauce and half the onions to the chicken and garlic mixture in the pan, and sauteed it all together.  Yum!

This was great! I left out the pineapple because my husband doesn't like it on pizza, and I let the chicken and garlic marinate in the teriyaki sauce. I also used shredded cooked chicken, which I already had. I'll definitely make this again.

This was OK. I guess my fiance & I just didn't care for the combo like I thought we would. I was looking very forward to trying this recipe... my fiance not so much (but it wasn't his night 2 cook... lol!). I pretty much followed Renee's directions exactly except for a couple of personal changes. I purchased pizza dough from my Italian market instead of using the commercial stuff (if I'm not making my own crust, I prefer the next best thing!). Oh, and I also marinated my chx. for ~ 5 hrs. & only topped 1/2 of our pizza w/ pineapple (my fiance doesn't care for the stuff, especially on pizza). I ended up using a tad less than 1 c. feta/cheddar (all I had left in the fridge) & used only HALF the amt. of teriyaki sauce called for - which worked out beautifully since it's all I had on hand anyways (FYI: A full c. is WAAAY too much IMHO). I am not sure whether I should have used teriyaki marinade OR basting sauce (I used the thicker Kikkoman brand basting sauce).... Perhaps the high sugar content of the sauce caused the sides of my pizza to burn ever so slightly???? All in all, this was a nice recipe to try, but I do suggest 1 change: It is NOT necessary to pre-bake your crust! It didn't make any difference for me. My crust was no more crispy than if I hadn't. I guess it's a matter of personal preference. Sweet lemon iced tea was the perfect complement to our meal! Thx. for sharing, Renee :)

Wonderful.  A big hit at our house.  Used way less teriyaki sauce.  Chopped up the chunks of pineapple as others suggested.  This one's a keeper.

Gosh this was good.  I didnt follow it 100% due to ingredients on hand.  We had an impromptu pizza party, and this was already on my menu so I had some previously cooked chicken marinating for most of the day.  I had to make my own teriyaki sauce & no feta.  I used a homemade beer crust, and a thin pizza sauce was accidentally put on but it was fine.  It was gone in a flash!  So I hurriedly made another.  It was a Betty Crocker crust this time, the chicken of course only marinated briefly but it was gone in a flash also!  Thanks for sharing!

This was fairly good...go light on the garlic though...it came out rather strong the first time. Overall, it's much better than I ever imagined it would be. It sounded disgusting at first, but the adventurous spirit in me wanted to try it.

This was pretty good.   I first tried using the pilsbury tubes of dough and this was a disaster...I didn't have a rolling pin and I just couldn't get it rolled out right, and then it ended up sticking to the pan. So I sent my husband to the store to get a Boboli crust.  
I didn't pre-cook it at all since it isn't dough.  
I only sprinkled on a light layer of onions because I'm not a fan of them. I also only put pinapple on half the pizza because my husband doesn't like it.    
We both liked it!  My husband is already asking when i'm going to make it again.  I may marinate the chicken in the teriyaki sauce next time...while marinading in pinapple juice sounded like it should be awesome, the chicken really didn't have much flavor.

This was really good. I didn't quite put 1 cup of teriyaki sauce on the crust, but added a little to each piece as we ate it. I also snuck in some mushrooms without my husband knowing. :) Really good and quick recipe.

This topping was exceptional! I added tomatoes as I had some that needed using up, which blended well with the other flavours. There was a lot of topping so we did not end up with a naked crust, which is a good thing!

This pizza was AWESOME!  I pretty much followed it with a few modifications.... I used premade crust and did bake it for 7 minutes.  I used a Teriyaki GLAZE bc I don't like a dry pizza and I felt it would be better.  After I cooked my chicken and chopped it up small, I also drizzled it and mixed it up with the glaze so it was coated as well.  At the end, I put a small drizzle of glaze all over the top before popping it into the over.  It was wonderful and not too dry...very very flavorful and was even great as leftovers.

This is one of our favorite pizzas! I would suggest using terriyaki baste or glaze instead of terriyaki sauce, as the sauce is often too liquidy/watery.

This is a keeper in our household. I put all the pineapple on the pizza, and of course husband didn't like that much so next time I will use less pineapple on the pizza. Otherwise, this was quick if prepped the night before and easy to make. Loved it!! Thanks

This was surprisingly delicious.  A great mix of flavors.  I usually avoid making pizza because I hate dealing with dough and yeast but I just used a boboli crust(as suggested by another) and fresh pineapple.  Will definately make again.  Yum.

I used a Boboli crust and added green peppers.  I also used red onion instead of sweet, and used only cheddar.  This came out really good, will make again.

I thought this recipe was superb. I left out the chunks of pineapple and the onion. I used a boboli crust and it came out nice and crispy. Whoever thought of the flavor combination is a genius! Loved it and this was so easy! I will definitely make this again. Thanks so much!

Odd flavor combination.  Tasted a bit salty, probably from the feta.  Was slightly runny from juice seeping from the pineapple and from the teriyaki sauce. I used a Boboli pizza crust and eliminated the pre-baking.  Not a keeper.

This was a mess, mainly because there was way too much teriyaki sauce and the recipe had a conflict. This was only the second time I've ever made a "specialty" pizza. I measured out the full cup of sauce and it sure seemed like way too much, far more than the "thin layer" mentioned, but I thought, maybe it reduces or soaks in or caramelizes or something. The result was a pizza swimming in sauce. Maybe the original recipe used a very thick teriyaki sauce? Mine was pretty liquid. If only the ingredient list had said "to taste" or "as needed" instead of specifying a full cup, I would have liked this better - it's not like a 16-inch pizza is very variable in surface area. Oh, and all that sauce probably contributed to the fact that this took over twice as long for the pizza to be "done", more or less.
Not a happy experience for me.

Delicious flavor! I cut back on the teriyaki sauce and could have cut back more. I was also confused as to which teriyaki sauce to buy...the regular runny kind or the thicker basting sauce. I bought the runny kind. I used a cheddar cheese blend. This was incredibly rich even without the feta. Will make again.

This pizza turned out awesome!! I think next time I will marinate the chicken with some teriyaki sauce along with the pinapple and garlic...I didn't have feta or cheddar cheese so I used Montery Jack and Mozz. Turned out fabulous, my new favorite.

Flavor was great, I would make it again, but with barbecue sauce as the base.  We like saucy pizza at our house and had to dip it.

Excellent pizza - the teriyaki sauce gave it a very unique flavor. I made it for a couple friends and it went over very well. I couldn't find a sweet onion, so I substituted some chopped green onion, and saved some time by using a premade Boboli crust. I'm a big fan of vidalia sweet onions though, so I'll have to try this again when I can find some.

This is a awesome recipe! Go thin on the teriyaki sauce (you really don't need much to get the zing out of it) but pile on the chicken!! My husband and I both loved the flavors and the texture. Four thumbs up!

This was o.k.  I think you could get away with using only 1 10 oz pkg. of pizza dough, it was a little doughy with 2.  I also grilled the onions with some green peppers which sparked it up a bit.

I will definitely try this recipe again, however I will make some serious changes.  There was FAR too much teriyaki sauce.  I would cut the amount in half, or cook the chicken in the sauce and drain before putting onto the pizza dough.  Mine looked nothing at all like the picture.  It would have required twice the amount of cheddar (which I may do next time).

My husband liked it but I wasn't impressed.  I made my own crust and teriyaki sauce, otherwise, I stuck to the recipe as written.  Oh, I used dark meat chicken instead of chicken breast.  I personally didn't like the teriyaki sauce...it was overpowering.

I was out of teriyaki sauce so I used sweet baby rays sweet vidalia onion barbeque sauce instead. I also used a boboli pizza crust instead of baking one. Everything else remained unchanged. It was very tasty!

Very good, but very sweet! The feta cuts the sweetness which is good. I caramelized the onions and used the grilled and ready chicken strips.

Soooo yummy!  Hubby is an onion hater so that was the only thing I left off, but next time I think I'm going to put them on half because just thinking about this pizza with some caramelized onions on it has me drooling... :)  Delicious!  This will definitely go on our Friday night pizza rotation.

This is the most unique pizza I've ever taste...very CPKish! I used a bread machine pizza dough, which is awesome. I then grilled one side of the dough on the grill for 7 min. Put the toppings on the grilled side per the directions. Then put back on the grill for 10 min until the feta is melted. FOLLOW ALL DIRECTIONS ON TOPPINGS, they are awesome, don't leave anything out!!

A huge family favorite. We make it often. The best was making homemade teriyaki sauce to use, less salty and much thicker. However we are lazy and just use store bought and it turns out fantastic. Oh, and it tastes even better on a pizza stone. For some reason the stone improves this particular pizza.

This is a fantastic recipe!  The flavor combination is amazing.  Try adding toasted almonds for a little texture.  I served this on mini-pitas as appetizers and they were party favorite.  It seemed like there were a lot of left-over toppings, so I toasted them inside full-sized pita halves for lunch.

This was okay.  I used a pre-made crust and pre-cooked chicken.  I reheated the chicken in the juice and garlic.  This was very salty.  I was not crazy about it.

This was so tasty as well as fast and easy.  I had never used canned dough before but it was pretty good.  I did make homemade teriyaki suace and cut down on the onion per other reviewers advice.

This recipe was super easy to make and had a VERY interesting taste!
I couldn't find any refrigerated pizza crust dough at my local grocery store, so I bought a pre-made crust, and the pizza still turned out great.
I highly suggest the recipe to anyone wanting to experiment with new ideas in pizza.
The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I'm not a big fan of onions...and so I lessened the amount of them a little bit.

I'd use a little more teriyaki sauce and a little less feta cheese.
