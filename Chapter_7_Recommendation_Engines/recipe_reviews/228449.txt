I'm the submitter of the recipe.  I actually submitted this 6 years ago, and I've made some changes in how I make this now.  I usually use cane syrup instead of corn syrup, and depending on how sweet my potatoes are, I cut back a bit on the sugar.  The pie is not heavy on a spice flavor due to my preference (I like the sweet poatoes to take center stage), but you can certainly up the spice amount if you prefer a spicier flavor.  You can also use pumpkin pie spice;  I just like the apple pie spice better.  I don't recommend using canned sweet potatoes as the fresh gives a much better flavor, but you can certainly use those in a pinch.  As the notes states, this is a very sweet pie, and it's definitely not low calorie.  Great for a thanksiving or Christmas table, because it's definitely an indulgence.

This recipe is quick and VERY easy. My first time making a sweet potato pie and it was delicious.  I didn't have corn syrup but followed the recipe otherwise. For those wanting spice, I added more vanilla and a tsp of cinnamon and found it enhanced the pie nicely.

This is THE PIE right here! I chose this recipe because it was simple enough for my first try at a sweet potato pie, yet slightly different than other recipes. Oh my goodness y'all, it was so good. I honestly don't know if you could get a better flavor. The apple pie spice sets it off! My husband is very partial to his mothers pie and he's funny about eating anyone else's. He absolutely loved it! The only thing I would recommend is using very large potatoes if your only going to use 2 like it calls for.. I bought regular sized ones and it was to loose so I had to add 2 more. The consistency was perfect after that. Also, I had to cook it a little longer than 45 min. but it may just be my oven. It made enough for 2 deep dish pies. I will use this recipe from now on!

This was a great recipe, in my opinion it was a little too sweet, but still very good. I also chose to use pumpkin pie spice compared to apple pie spice.

Delicious pie!!! This one is a keeper! My fiancée wanted me to make her a sweet potato pie and it scared me because I've never even tasted it much less made it. Bake time is wrong, and at no point does anything ever get fluffy...but it comes out in the end and that's what we care about! The lady says this one is a keeper. The lady has spoken!

Loved this pie! I used several small sweet potatoes and didn't double any of the ingredients but had plenty for TWO pies. Instead of corn syrup, I melted a heaping cup of dark brown sugar in 4 TB water and used that which worked perfectly. Also didn't have apple pie spice or nutmeg which I think would have made it even better. I used cinnamon, cardamon, and allspice. Cut back on the white sugar and was generous with the vanilla. I'll definitely be making these pies again soon!

If I could give this recipe more stars, I would!  Hands down, the best sweet potato pie recipe I’ve tried. This will be my “go-to” recipe from now on. I followed the recipe to a “t” and even bought the apple pie spice as suggested. The taste of sweet potatoes shines through and is accented by the light spices. Oh my ..... this is GOOD!

Did not have sweet potatoes so I used canned yams. I also didn't have evaporated milk so I left out the sugar and use sweetened condensed milk.  Came out great!

Awsome recipe I have never made a sweet potato pie but this recipe is amazing its simple and delicious I subbed the apple pie spice for the pumpkin pie spice I also made mine own crust thats my preference. The pie is definitely sweet so next time ill cut back on the sugar and corn syrup to bring the sweet potatoes stand out more if anyone has some other subs for the recipe I'd love to hear it.

My family LOVED this recipe. This was my first attempt at making sweet potato pie and it was a huge success! The only thing I changed was I added a half of a teasppon more vanilla and a dash more of cinnamon
