I basicly made this the same way, but instead of pickle I used a chopped seeded cucumber, and no red pepper. We had it that way in a Mexican Resteraunt[sp?], My husband and I loved it.

pretty good.  we love pico de gallo and make it often.  we love the "secret ingredient", it adds just the right amount of crispy, saltiness.  we use red onion, Roma tomatoes, and add a tablespoon of minced garlic.

As far as improving on a such a simple dish, the pickle goes a long way. Lime juice a must and we added garlic.  Very enjoyable.

GREAT recipe! I loved the tang and zip the dill pickles gave it. I also added a little shredded cabbage to add more body. Instead of the traditional taco fillings, we layered the taco meat and the pico de gallo and it was fantastic!! Next time I think I may add a little chili powder too.

We loved this! I did add a little bit extra cilantro but ONLY because I wanted to finish using what I had left in the fridge.  I am making another batch soon to take to a pickle loving neighbor. He puts pickles in almost everything but I think this will surprise and thrill him!

Great taste! I omitted the jalapeno and instead used Hot & Spicy Dill Babies for the pickles. Thanks!

This was a big hit with the family. They were scooping it by heaps on tortilla chips. It is not a typical pico flavor but it is very good and different.

Good! Not quite as much heat as we like. Need to kick it up a notch for my family so next time I will add more peppers. Not really sure if the dill pickle made much difference, but I will continue to use it whenever I use this recipe.

This was fantastic! Loved the zip that the dill pickles gave to this recipe! Took advice of others & added lime juice & minced garlic...YUM! I made 2 batches, 1 spicy & 1 mild...both gone in record time!

Good.  Not great.  I didn't think the pickles added much "zip"...but I guess I could have added more.  I served the Pico as a side to "Addictice Sweet Potato Burritos" from AllRecipes and the fresh/spicy flavor complemented the sweetness from the burritos well.

I have indeed try this recipe and I've got to say thank you, I have looked for over a year for the ingredient that mine was missing and it was a pickle all the time.

I added some ground pepper spices from a friend to increase the heat. May use Habanero pepper instead of Jalepeno next time for more heat but it turned out really well. I'll definitely be making it again.

I made this exactly by the recipe except I didn't have dill pickles.  I did have dill pickle relish and I used that instead, already chopped up and easy to spoon up. I was careful not to include much of the vinegar juice; just the relish.
