This was absolutely delicious. So glad I found this recipe.
Pork shoulder is one of my favorite roasts -- it gets fall-apart-tender when you braise it like this. Wonderful flavors. My husband loved it. Will definitely make again.

A few hints. I seared it in a dutch oven, then just added the rest of ingredients and braised it in the same pot. Cooked uncovered for the final half hour so the sauce would reduce slightly. Then to remove some of the fat, once cooked, I moved the roast to a platter, then put a colander over another pot and poured everything into it. Then I put the sauce into a fat separator, and put everything back into the pot together with the leftover juices (sans fat). Wonderful.

DELICIOUS.   I followed the recipe almost to the T... I didn't have any shallots so I used green onions instead.  Everything was great about this recipe. The smell of it while it was cooking made my neighboring apartment dwellers jealous.  I will definitely make this again and again. UPDATE... I tried this again today. As I had plans that were going to keep me away from my home for the day, I decided to make this in my crockpot instead. It was even better! I followed the seasoning to the T... the only difference is that instead of roasting it in the oven, I cooked it on low for 8 hours in my crockpot. The crockpot is much smaller than my roasting pan so the liquids almost completely surrounded the pork. My boyfriend enjoyed it so much he went back for thirds!

Excellent recipe. The pork is melt-in-your-mouth tender. I substitued greem onions for shallots since I didn't have any and I omitted the beans because I just didn't want beans in the sauce. That didn't affect it at all. Will definitely make this again, perhaps next in the slow cooker.

Fabulous. The taste was phenomenal and paired really well with cornbread.  A man meal-as my husband says.  Next time, however, I'm trying red wine in place of beer and I'll cook it in a deep dutch oven so the meat actually sits a little deeper in the juices.  These are just personal preferences.  The original recipe is truly wonderful.

Wow!  Great recipe!  I made some adjustments and it turned out much better than I expected - extremely tender and full of flavor.  I rubbed the pork shoulder with garlic powder, salt, & pepper before searing on the stove; mixed canned diced tomatoes with Italian stewed tomatoes; substituted the beer with red wine (used about 1 1/2 cups for a 5 lb. roast); diced the shallots and garlic; added more seasonings (thyme, italian mix, and garlic powder); mixed everything together first to taste before pouring over the seared pork shoulder in a crock pot and cooked on High for 5 hours.  We're pretty critical when it comes to new recipes, but couldn't find anything we'd change for next time!

This recipe never fails.  It's perfect and doesn't need any changes.  However, I never have shallots, so I've never included them.  I also never have stewed tomatoes, so substitute diced tomatoes.  It's a great "comfort food" type of meal and always a huge hit.  Well done!

This was the most tender pork roast I've ever cooked (even better than a crock pot!).  Didn't have shallots but used a lg leek and a can of northern white beans instead of the cannallinis.  I'm going to try this with a beef roast next week!!   Oh, I did the whole thing in a big cast iron skillet.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

Delicious!  I used a very lean pork roast and the meat just fell apart.  Served it in bowls and it was kind of like a stew with the beans.  Will make again!

I'm making this for tomorrow night's dinner.  But I have a hint I use when I copy a recipe.  I copy the recipe and then I open a blank Word document.  I read through 10-20 of the best reviews and copy and past the ones with changes I might want to try into the new document.  Then I go back and highlight the changes  and make the changes a different colored text.  Since I keep my recipes in a 3-ring binder with sheet protectors, my "review" sheet goes on the backside of the recipe!!  Hope this hint is helpful.

GREAT RECIPE as written! Thank you LADY_ALETHEA for posting it.  We LOVE pork roast and I have made it many different ways, but this is unique and a HUGE hit with my entire family (7yrs to 53yrs).  I don't normally buy shallots and they were very expensive at the 1st store I went to so I only bought 5.  I doubled the recipe (as I always do) since I had a 7.5 lb roast.  I decided to go to another store and sure enough the shallots were a fraction of the price, so I purchased 15 more (doubled recipe).  I attempted to put everything in my "large" crock pot but all the ingredients did not fit.  I transferred everything into my "large" roaster and it was to the tip top (but everything fit)....I cooked it for approx 6-7 hrs on the lower temp and then uncovered it for the last hour at the higher temp.  I used 2 bottles of "Moosehead" beer and I did serve it over rice, which was a HUGE HIT!!!  It smelled fantastic (and I had a cold).  It tasted so "fresh & healthy"......will definitely make again!!  DO NOT SKIMP OR ELIMINATE ANY OF THE INGREDIENTS as it is PERFECT the way it is written.  THANKS AGAIN and I can't wait until leftovers tonight.  I BET IT'S EVEN BETTER TODAY!!  P.S.  This goes a long way!!  I froze 2 big bowls for a later date plus we ate last night and again tonight.  TO THOSE WHO GIVE LOWER RATINGS AFTER THEY "ALTER" THE ENTIRE RECIPE:  RATE THE RECIPE AS IT IS WRITTEN NOT AS YOU WRITE IT!!!  You should then CREATE your own recipe ~ That just cracks me up!!! CHEERS~

I made this today for our traditional New Year's Day dinner.  Instead of using cannellini beans I used black-eye peas and skipped the rosemary.  It was absolutely fantastic and will be my go to recipe every New Year's Day!  Happy New Year!!

This was fantastic and amazingly easy!  I browned the roast in an dutch oven so I didn't have to move the roast to a different pan, added everything and off it went ino the oven.  Otherwise no changes made. Fantastic as is.  We froze the left overs and used them as a base for soup.  All I did was cook an chopped onion, celery, and carrots. Added the leftovers and some beef broth and cooked on the stove on simmer for about an hour, very hearty and yummy!!! Not a bite was wasted from this roast.

YUMMMY!!!!!!!  I just made this recipe tonight for Sunday supper and it was FANTASTIC!!!!  I've NEVER liked any recipe that included beer so I was hesitant to use it, but it really made the dish!  I didn't have shallots.  I used about 1 tsp. dried rosemary instead of 3 sprigs of fresh.  Everything else went into the roasting pan exactly as listed in the recipe.  I followed the cook times and it was perfect.  Thank you to the person who suggested serving cornbread (one of my husband's favorite things to eat.)  I can't wait to make this again!  It was super, super easy and the entire house smelled fantastic all day while the pork roasted in the oven.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!  I'm not an experienced cook but was successful this time!

I made this in the crockpot( 5 hours on high) adding baby carrots, chopped celery and new potatos(Yukon gold). My wife ate two helpings immediately and raved about it the rest of the day. This is definitely a "keeper" recipe and will be made again many times. My wife wants it made weekly! Thanks to Lady Althea for this delicious addition to my files!

This recipe is awesome!  This was my first attempt ever making a roast of any kind.  My fiance bought a pork shoulder roast at the grocery store because it was on sale for super-cheap, but I had no idea what to do with it.  Then I saw "Easy Pork Roast" and thought: "Easy.  Excellent!"  So I went to the store and bought a roasting pan and made this. It truly was incredibly easy to make.  I couldn't believe cooking a roast was as easy as browning it and throwing it in a pan with some veggies and beer and then leaving it alone for hours. It is so tender it fell to pieces as I carved it and we ended up eating it in a bowl with all the veggies and sauce.  It was really more like a stew. The best part is it tastes even better as leftovers.

This is the  perfect 'throw-everything-in-the-pot-and-do-nothing' recipe! I have made this pork roast about a dozen times now. I don't always follow the recipe exactly, but it always comes out perfect! I have used dark beer or light beer,  shallots or no shallots,  cannelini beans or navy beans, dry beans or canned beans, roasted in the oven or slow cooked in a crock pot! It is always amazing! You just can't mess this one up. Thank  you for sharing this wonderful recipe!!!! Oh and today I'm trying  it with a boneless Boston butt roast.

This recipe is different than any other pork roast recipe I have tried before. The pork came out so tender and the beans and sauce were good. You can taste a bit of the beer flavor. The only change I made was using 5 shallots rather than the ten. I will try the 10 next time but shallots flavor is so mild I do not think the 5 more will make that big a difference. We are having the leftovers tonight and I am looking forward to the beans.

This is good. I doubled the tomatoes, used 1.5 cups of red wine instead of beer and chopped the fresh rosemary and added it along with fresh thyme to the tomato mixture. I found the cooking time to be correct (4.3 lb roast), though I might have added a bit more liquid to the pan when I turned up the heat for the remaining hour. The meat and tomato and bean "ragout" were really yummy. The only complaint that I have is not with the recipe itself, but this is the first time that I've cooked this cut of pork, and I didn't realize how fatty it is. Pork fat is good stuff, but this dinner was very heavy. Also, clean up was not fun, but the recipe itself is good and worth a try if you like this cut of meat. Oh, and I don't think that rice is necessary as a side. Instead I'd suggest a green vegetable or salad.

It was kind of dry, and I didn't even cook it the full time. But the outer part of the meat was great. I'd fix it again.

Given that everyone else rates this recipe so well, I'm willing to concede that maybe I misinterpreted it and did something wrong as I found I had some questions as I was going through it.  I wondered if the beans should have been drained. I didn't drain them since it didn't specify to but I don't usually cook with quite so much starchy liquid.  Was I supposed to uncover it at some point during the cooking?  Was I supposed to stir it at any point?  Since these were not specified, I didn't do them.  What kind of beer (dark, med, lighter) works best? I used a med to light type.  Was I supposed to trim the pork shoulder?  The one I bought actually had skin on it so I did trim all that off.  At the end, I just didn't like the look, texture or taste of this recipe, especially the "juice" which was surprising since I love all the ingredients.  Specifically I found the onion/shallot combo to be overwhelming but yet otherwise bland.  I was so hoping to like this as it sounded fantastic, but disappointed with my first attempt.

A big hit with the family.  The house smelled so good all afternoon while the roast slow-cooked in the oven.  All the ingredients blended well and the beans were yummy.  Just a great recipe.  WIll use it again and again

Did you know that your recipe is the same as PASTA FASULI??!! That's an old Italian recipe that my ancestors have made for centuries... just boil pasta and add your recipe on top of it! Either way, it's DELISH!

Tender and Tasty I used a pork rub that I had purchased for BarBQ'd ribs. I rubbed it on a fresh pork shoulder, wrapped it in plasic wrap & placed it in the frig for a few hours. Then just before roasting I sprinkled garlic powder over the roast. The roast was 3.7 lb and took less than 2 hours. I cooked it according to temp with a meat thermometer placed in the roast during the cooking. Very easy and great recipe.

The pork melts in your mouth.  It was so easy to make.  I wasn't sure what I was getting into with this, but I'm glad I gave it a shot.  Thanks for sharing this recipe.

I used only 2 onions, 1 pkg of onion soup mix, pepper, small amount of adobe sauce and 2 cans of Dr. Pepper or any soda on hand...soo tender and yummy.  Pull apart or add BBQ sauce so tender it melts...300-325* for 6 hrs in dutch oven, turned roast over once, bake till tender..fantastic!!

This recipe was fantastic!!  The meat was so good, and so moist and had so much flavor!!  I only used one can of cannellini  beans, used the drained juice from the tomatoes and as I didn't have a covered roaster big enough, i covered it with tinfoil. It was a recipe I will use again!!!

Fine but nothing special.  I cooked it in the crock pot and was surprised how little the beer taste cooked out.  It tasted like pork cooked in beer without any other flavors.  It needs other flavors too.....not sure what though.  It was fine, but I wont make again.

We loved this recipe.  I did not drain the beans or the tomatoes and used a bottle of Corona.  The aroma through our home was wonderful.  The pork was so tender and the bean/tomato mixture was very tasty.  I would think of it as a one dish meal.  I served a mixed salad alongside this dish.  I will make it again.  It made GREAT pork sandwiches the next day.

Made this for the family last night, following the recipe exactly.  The reviews were so good that I decided to give it a try for something different. Unfortunatley, nobody liked it, including myself.  We ate it, but with no rave reviews and I had to let them know not every new recipe works out for us. Maybe I shouldn't have added the liquid from the 2 cans of beans, but since the recipe didn't say to drain, as it did for the stewed tomatoes, I figured that meant to add the liquid.  Maybe that's what went wrong, I don't know, but I don't think it would taste much different with or without the liquid. The next day I made BBQ pork sandwiches out of the leftovers and everyone enjoyed those, but was dissapointed in the original recipe.  I love making new things for my family so we don't got bored of the regulars.

Good flavor combination. I forgot to pick up shallots, and I only had canned tomatoes, not stewed, but everything else I followed pretty closely. I did use the method some other reviewers mentioned of doing this in the slow cooker - the house smelled great, and the pork came out SO tender. Instead of serving over rice, I tossed a couple handsful of rice into the mix for the last 30 minutes or so - the rice soaked up the flavor, and no extra pot to clean.

Amazing flavor and very forgiving. Hubby tried this last night. He messed up a bit and it still turned out well, bless his heart.  Our roast was almost 8 lbs and he only used seasonings for a 4 lb roast.  We didn't have any shallots. He also forgot to cover with tin foil.  Yet, it was a HUGE hit!!!!!  Will add to the rotation!

This recipe was GREAT, I don't eat pork but my family loved it.  I cooked for 2 1/2 hours and uncovered for 50 minutes, I took the roast out and let most of liquid evaporate, I then made angel hair pasta and mixed the stuff from the roast and the family loved it....  It was weird with the beans and pasta but it worked!!!  Great reacipe and thanks for sharing!!!  Oh and I used "Stella" beer ....soooo good!

Yummy!  I love rosemary but I felt like it was a little over powering in this dish.  Next time I'll probably use 1/2-1/3 the amount suggested.

This is the best pork roast ever. Delicious, tender, succulent. I used a white onion and a 14 oz can of tomatoes, but otherwise stuck to the recipe. Please try this if you like roast pork. Lady Alethea is a genius!

Absolutely delicious!  I used white wine instead of beer and a can of diced tomatoes because that was what I had, and Oh. My. Goodness.  Melt in the mouth tender, great and classic flavor combination and excellent, classic technique.  This is one of my new go-tos for an easy winter meal.  Thank you so much!

This is a sound recipe.  I was looking for a quick, easy recipe for a bargain pork shoulder roast I recently bought and started with this.  Even though I didn't have most of the listed ingredients (forcing me to substitute canned peeled tomato strips for the stewed tomatoes, dried navy beans for cannellini, granulated onion for the chopped onion and shallots, dried rosemary for fresh, and bottled minced garlic for fresh cloves), the results were more than satisfactory.  I look forward to trying the recipe as published.

Made this for someone that doesn't like the taste of beer (or wine) in their food so I subbed with two 32 oz. containers chicken bone broth from local co-op. It covered the meat completely. Added all other ingredients plus sliced carrots and parsnips. It was wonderful. Only had a 3 lb roast so I baked for 3 hours at 275 then upped it to 425 for the last hour for a total of 4 hours in the oven instead of five. It still came out moist and fall-apart tender. Reminded us of a French cassoulet. Definitely will make again.

Perfect. Love this recipe, wouldn't change a thing (except the beans) Made once with the beans, not a big bean fan, then second time did without them, either way it's delicious.

I highly recommend Lady_Alethea's pork roast recipe as written. The prep really is easy. In the time it takes to brown the meat, all the veggies are chopped, cans opened, seasonings gathered, and oven heated.  The results were tender meat and a tasty medley of flavors that were very French Provençal. My hubby exclaimed that for a big pot of meat and beans it's very Julia Child. We decided to serve it over lightly buttered egg noodles, instead of rice.

This was a hit with the fam. My mom even dropped by unexpectedly and ended up eating with us- loved it! The meat wasn't dry at all and really loved the beans with it. Didn't have any rosemary and will add a little of that next time. Definitely will be making again!

This dish had great textures. I loved the flavor of the cannellini beans and rosemary with the pork, and this was an easy dinner. Next time I will use sherry or wine in place of the beer though to add some depth to the flavor.

This turned out really good.  Very easy long and slow but it was tasty all liked it.  Followed the recipe no modifications.  I Willis’s this again. Oh rather than a large casserole dish I used a Dutch oven.  It yielded the same results very tender.

I followed the recipe with a few adjustments: I didn't have fresh rosemary, so I used crushed dried rosemary; I didn't have any bay leaves, so I skipped them; I had to use a can of cannellini and a can of northern beans; and finally, my roast was only 3 lbs.  But, I thought the flavor was great, the juices make a nice simple sauce and the beans round it out and make it a meal.  Next time, however, I will use a dutch oven so that the juices don't boil over and burn on the bottom of the oven (my mistake).  I will definitely make this again!

Loved the recipe as it is written but anyone contemplating making it should know it is very versatile.  I've used mild salsa in place of the stewed tomatoes,  chopped garlic when I've had no fresh and slow cooked in a Crockpot on days I've had to work.  If you're tired of the regular old pulled pork recipes, give this a try.

I had been looking for a good pork shoulder recipe, and came across this one. It was Great! I only had one problem, and that was the roast I had was 10 pounds, not 5. But, using all the ingredients listed, it was perfect. I should have added a little more salt and garlic, but that's about it. Loved it!

Although very tender and juicy, I'm sorry, but this pork was flavorless. I won't make again.

I made this a couple of weeks ago.  I didn't have all the ingredients so i modified to what I had, but it turned out awesome!  I am making it again tonight.  This is what I did:  pork picnic shoulder (bone in), 2 cloves garlic, half an onion, didn't have the shallot, salsa (I can't used canned tomatoes, my husband is allergic to citric acid.  I am using 3 cans of beans tonight, because there just weren't enough!  Seriously, be brave and do what you can with what you've got.   As long as the base ingredients are the same, it will turn out!  I served it over rice, but husband wants mashed potatoes tonight.

Delicious.  Only changes were that I forgot the rosemary.  I used other suggestion of rubbing roast with salt and pepper but also used some Pork Magic before browning the roast.  I served it with the Irish Colcannon (great), corn bread, and the Superfast Asparagus (also great recipe).  My guests came back for seconds so fast that I was amazed.  I did take the roast out of the liquid to make it easy to serve.   I then put a couple of cups of the liquid including some of the roast vegetables in a pan and thickened it with corn starch to make a gravy for the meat or potatoes but it really wasn't needed.  Will use another auggestion and make soup out of the rest of the liquid.  Definitely worth making.

Absolutely wonderful!!  I stuck with the recipe almost to the T, it's pretty perfect, but as others have mentioned, open to personalization.   Husband loved it, says it's company fair for sure, maybe with a Waldorf type salad on the side.   We loved the beans in the dish, you don't need a potatoe side dish at all.   YUMMY!

This was phenomenal! So tasty! I did it with a boneless pork shoulder and after it was done there was alot of fat.... I had to trim... Next time I will use either a pork loin roast or 4  tenderloins(1 pound each) , or pork sirloin steak... They all get fork tender, but so much less fatty....

I made this just as written, and it was absolutely wonderful.  I don't usually have good results with pork roasts, and relucantly invited a guest to share this with us, and everyone raved about it.  Perfect.  I'll make this a special occasion dish, and find special occasions to enjoy it.  Thanks so much!

Oh my gosh!  I didn't believe it was possible to make pork so juicy and tender!  I've been trying to find a way to cut back on red meat - as well as save some money - so I picked up a package of pork steaks at the store, I found this recipe when looking for ways to cook them other than the grill.  My husband normally doesn't care for pork because it's so tough and bland.  This was juicy, fell off the bone and we were able to eat it with a fork!  The only modifications I made were - I dry rubbed the steaks with some greek seasoning before searing them.  I didn't have any white wine, so I used a little sweet red, and I didn't have an onion soup mix - so I just chopped up a medium sized yellow onion and threw the fresh onion on top for cooking.  I served the steaks over brown sticky rice with the broth/juices as a gravy.  It was fantastic!!!  Will definitely be making this again!

I was surprised and disappointed at how significant the fragrance and taste of beer was in the final product.The meat turned out tasty, and I certainly kept that, but the beer based broth and its tomatoes, shallots etc smelled like and tasted like hot stale beer. I was hoping to be able to use the whole product sort of like a stew, with the meat and fixins' all on a plate, but I wound up throwing the whole broth mixture out. Meat good, other stuff yuck...

One of The Best recipes I've tried from this site.  Bravo to the creator.
I served it with Mashed potatoes, my style:  adding heavy cream to it, a lawyer of mozzarela cheese , some bits of butter, oven 350 for 15 min, sprinkle parmesano cheese on top, oven 10 more minutes....  Flavors combined So Well !!
Prepare this during the last 30 min. of the pork in the oven.

This was a great recipe.  I do another one similar to this leaving out the rosemary, swapping out the tomatoes for salsa, and swapping out some of the shallots for a mild onion, and tossing the entire thing in a crockpot on low....wonderful shredded goodness for tortillas the next night, and soup for the third!

Oh Oh OH!  This recipe is good!  My husband and my 4 year old daughter LOVED it.  I did a few things different...only because I had to use what I had on hand.  I omitted the shallot, changed the beer for wine, and used a can of whole tomatoes crushed instead of the stewed.  I also added finely chopped carrots and celery.  I served with Brown rice...YUMMO!

Very tasty. And smelled like pizza while it was in the oven. 
I used apple juice in place of the beer, since my kids have celiac and I skipped the beans because I ran out of room in my dutch oven (my roast was from a pig we butchered ourselves, so it was near 6 pounds!).

I could not find shallots this week, so I used leeks. I already had a smaller roast in the freezer so I cut the recipe in half. I used a remote read meat thermometer and it took much less time. I never ramped the temp up, in fact had to drop the temp. It was fall apart tender and delicious.

Made it as instructed last night for the family and it was pretty good. Next time I will use a little more salt or possible some chicken bullion. Also I didn’t anticipate how much liquid was in this and I didn’t have a big enough roasting pan ??  haha. Think I will make it again with a much bigger pan

This is a very easy, tasty one-pot dish that got rave reviews in my house. I substituted red wine for the beer. That's all I changed. When the dish was done, I took the roast out of the dutch oven, removed the bay leaves and rosemary stems and used an immersion blender to create a puree of the beans, tomatoes, onions, garlic and shallots. It is a company-worthy dish that is so easy to make.

This is a super eady way to do a pork shoulder or butt roast.  It was tender and tasty. I re-potted the left over roast the next day with a bag of 10 bean blend it made great pulled pork soup.

Melt in your mouth. I baked in slow cooker for about 3 to 4 hrs and then under broiler for a few minutes. Husband loved the meal. A keeper recipe.

Nothing special. No unique flavors. I used Great Northern beans instead of Canelli beans because my store only had Progresso canelli beans and they were more than twice the price. Don’t think there is much difference. Also used two red onions quartered instead of shallots because my store did not have shallots. I will probably not make this again, but if I did I would add another can of beans (maybe black beans) and a lot more seasonings.

Extremely tasty!!!  However, I reduced the cooking  time by 1 (one) hour.   I took off the hour from the lower temp. and left the last hour at the higher temp.  

Also, added carrots and see no reason why other hearty veggies can't be added also.

I think the best way to serve is after cooking, stir veggie mixture well.  Let cool completely and then store in fridge overnight.  Warm in microwave without overcooking... just barely warm.  The flavors were better the next day as a leftover meal but now know that next time I won't plan to serve until the next day. 

We enjoyed with a fresh salad and would have loved a loaf of crusty, hearty bread!!

Very tasty.

We made this exactly as the recipe stated.  The pork was fabulously moist and tender.  The beans were great.  But the taste of the shallots and garlic was overwhelming.  I don't think I'll be making this again.  We all ate it but no one wanted to eat leftovers the night after.

Upon reading the recipe, I thought it was a strange mix of ingredients.  I made it exactly as stated, although I did increase the initial time in the oven by 1/2 hour because my roast was larger.  It was wonderful!  Very very tender meat, and the accompanying beans and tomatoes were good as well.  some leftover meat became pulled pork, which was equally terrific.  Thanks for sharing!

I loved this recipe and I don't particularly love pork (except bacon).

I followed this recipe except I didn't have any cannellini beans so I added a can of navy beans and a can of butter beans. I cooked it in my crock pot so I also added a can of beef broth and 2 cans of water.   I cooked on high for about 4 hours and shredded the pork when done and added it back it to the pot.  It was amazing!!

Thank you for sharing!

This is one of the BEST recipes I have ever tried on this site!! I don't particularly like leftovers but I have been eating this for 3 consecutive days. The only changes I made was to add less tomatoes and added 2 red chili peppers to the mix for a little spice. The beans produced a wonderful, soupy consistency. Absolutely fantastic!!

Did not care for this recipe much at all.  It had a lot of tomatoes and was really soupy.  The meat was really tender which was nice but we didn't really care for the rest of it.  We left off the rosemary as we don't like it and used green onions instead of shallots because that is what I had on hand.  I don't believe that my substitutions/omissions were enough to completely change the dish as it would have been soupy regardless.  The only good thing that I took away from this is that I had never had cannellini beans before and they were pretty good.

Super easy to make!  I used what I had on hand: can of white northern type beans, and a can of tri-bean blend.  I also used 1 (14oz) can of stewed tomatoes, and 1 can of fire roasted tomatoes.  I didn't have fresh rosemary, so had to use the dry stuff.  It was still very flavorful.  Just make sure to season the pork prior to searing it, too.  Served with buttered noodles, and sautéed vegetables.

I'm going to use the leftovers as burrito filling tomorrow.   :-)

Tried it last night.  I think the Rosemary overpowered it...did not like the taste.  May have been good without it. Will not do it again.

This was good and different. I've never thought of putting beans or tomatoes with my pot roast. I usually do potatoes and carrots. I had to substitue some things such as diced tomatoes for stewed (personal preference) and I didn't have any shallots so I just used some scallions. I used heineken light beer since that's all I had. It was pretty tasty and I would do it again.

This was waaay easy and sooo delicious. Had people over for a casual dinner. I put the roast in the oven that morning and then cleaned house!! My guests raved about the roast and there was nothing left in the pan after the party....Thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a favorite in our family. I make it as is. The meat is super tender and falls apart when forked. I serve with mashed potatoes. Yummy!

Great recipe! I'll admit to having doubts about cooking my favorite roast with tomatoes poured over, but I needn't have worried.  Served with steamed white rice and veggie for a family dinner -- everyone liked or loved it.  I used Guinness (almost beer), since that's all I had, and skimmed as much fat off the gravy as I could about half way through the cooking -- my 7 lb roast was done in 4 hours at 275 degrees.

I forgot the beer on the counter right next to the stove so I missed out on that layer of flavor, but it was still fantastic!

After reading all the rave reviews I decided to try this - OMG - fantastic just like everyone else said! My only change was that I used vidallia onions instead of shallots because they are a bit more economical and I had them on hand.  If this recipe was any better I would have to cry.  Thanks for a recipe that will now be a tradition in our family and definitely good enough for company!!

I have to give this three stars because my hubby and I did not like it, but, I took it to work the next day and shared it with coworkers and they raved over it! I just didn't like the beer/stewed tomato taste. Its back to pork and sauerkraut for me, but the coworkers printed off the recipe! Thanks!

This was really excellent.  I browned in dutch oven and then cooked in same pot.  I also strained off liquid and defatted.  There was about 3/4 cup of fat removed so this step is essential.  Other than that, prepared exactly per recipe and served with rice.  I loved it and my family loved it.  Great recipe.  Thank you.

sorry to say, I followed the recipe to the letter and this dish, though tender, was bland and nothing special.

Really not sure what all the fuss is - followed the recipe and it was like onion stew - too much just same flavors - garlic, onion, shallots.  Would not make again.

This is definitely a keeper recipe.  The aroma of it cooking was as heavenly as it tastes.  I baked it in a high sided cast iron skillet, but next time I will try it in my small slow cooker.  I wasn't sure if the recipe called for 10 whole shallots or 10 shallot cloves as there is so much from the onion family in the recipe.  I used 10 shallot cloves and only one large onion and it was awesome.  Served it in a bowl with crusty French bread and a Caesar salad.  Comfort food at its finest!

I typically take reviews only so seriously because I know some can be very nit-picky and critical, while others create a completely new recipe all together. I never saw so many positive reviews with little to no renditions/changes to the original recipe so I decided to give this one a try and used the suggestions made by aCookingLaQuintaCA and used my dutch oven. Hands down, unbelievable recipe. The perfect amount of flavor, not too salty, not too bland. The pork just falls apart on the fork it's so tender. I will definitely keep this recipe handy when entertaining large groups. Thank you LADY_ALETHEA for a wonderful meal! Please share more!!!

Very good recipe for an inexpensive cut of meat.  I didn't have any shallots but that didn't seem to hurt the recipe.  I served it with white rice.  Good meal on a cold night!
