Excellent.  Wonderful fresh, light flavor.  I was not cooking in my own kitchen so made some subs.  Some of which I would have made at home, others out of necessity.  Bottled lime juice for fresh; olive oil for veg; a splash of lemon juice and a splash of white wine for lemon-flavored vodka; garlic pepper for lemon pepper; chopped iceberg lettuce for bagged Euro blend; no orange zest (no zester); added one-half cup chopped pecans.  When I make this again, I will use fresh lime juice and the orange zest.  HOWEVER...pull out soap box here...if I'm going to all the trouble to use fresh lime juice, fresh oranges, fresh orange zest, I'm not going to risk all that freshness on bagged salad greens.  I don't know about other cooks, but I've found them unreliable.  Sometimes OK, other times taste like the inside of a stale, empty, unused refrigerator smells.  Yeah, I know, canned cranberries and orange marmalade from a jar ain't exactly fresh squeezed!!  Bottom line is that we really like this salad!! Update: just noticed that this recipe calls for 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon lemon pepper.  Check to determine if your lemon pepper includes salt already.  If so, either omit salt or make adjustments.

I replaced the vegetable oil with olive oil and omitted the salt on the chicken since lemon pepper has a substantial amount of salt already. Other than those minor adjustments I followed things as they appeared.  The dressing was a bit too sugary/syrupy for my taste but the dish was enjoyable nonetheless.

This was pretty good.  I followed the recipe exactly and in the end didn't find the chicken picked up much of the marinade flavour (although I marinated it for about 10 hours).  The dressing was good, but if I were to make this again, I would add some toasted almonds for crunch
