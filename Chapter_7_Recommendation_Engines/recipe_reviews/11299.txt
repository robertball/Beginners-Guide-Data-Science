Great tasting cookie.  I used a tsp. of fresh lemon juice, and a tbs. of lemon zest (omitting the lemon extract).  Excellent.  After trying these, I have also decided to skip the rolling in sugar step, and just dust the cooled cookies with powdered sugar.  The powdered sugar will nestle nicely into the surface of this cookie!  Even though I made some slight alterations, I give these cookies 5 stars because they are sooo easy to prepare, quick to cook, and are incredibly easy to transport.  It's crisp, yet chewy, allowing them to be packaged in any way.  Mahalo nui loa!

Sweet Fancy Moses!!!!!!!!!!!  These cookies are one of THE BEST that has ever come out of my oven!  I couldn't believe how fast they were mixed up.  We rolled these in a mixture of yellow colored sugar and regular granulated-gave them a nice yellow color with a little sparkle-they are really pretty.  The taste is incredible-so light and refreshing.  You would never guess that there isn't any real lemon in this recipe.  The citrus flavor and the chewy texture of this cookie is fabulous-I will make this over and over!  Thanks for sharing such a wonderful recipe.

I would double, if not triple, the lemon extract.  Also, if anyone is wondering why there are discrepancies in the reviews as to the texture: if you want a crisp cookie, use lemon extract, not lemon juice.  The acid in lemon juice will react with the baking soda to create a leavening agent, giving you chewy cookies.  But, as others have said, these cookies are quite beautiful =)

What I love about these cookies is that they not only taste great with a great texture, but they also look perfect. They bake into perfect circles. I made these for a birthday party and rolled them in colored decorator's sugar to match our party colors instead of regular white sugar. If you're pressed for time put the dough in the freezer to chill, only takes about 20 minutes. I'm baffled by other reviewers comments about the cookies spreading too much. My only guess is that their dough wasn't chilled enough or they didn't use real butter. I baked mine about 2 inches apart and had room to spare when they were done.

A few key changes brought these up to five star status!  I doubled the lemon extract, added a tsp. of fresh lemon zest, and added several drops of yellow food coloring to the wet ingredients.  I also made my own lemon sugar to roll them in, by adding lemon extract and yellow food coloring to the sugar! I only rolled the top of the cookie, as I didn't want them to be overly sweet.    I didn't have parchment paper, I used cooking-spray and a light dusting of flour on the sheet, and they didn't stick at all.  Also, I only had unsalted butter, so I added 1/4 tsp of salt to the dry ingredients.  My dough was easy to handle after 15 minutes in the freezer. This cookie is delicious, and with the changes I added, is a real keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This is the perfect summer cookie, especially here in the Southwest!  This cookie is crisp on the edges, soft in the middle, with a very light lemony taste.  These began to brown pretty quickly, so I decreased the oven temp a few degrees and baked for 10 minutes.  I also made them a little smaller, using rounded teaspoons instead of the larger cookie.  They did spread a little, but the tsp size bakes a perfect tea sized cookie.  These are great!

These cookies were great! I didn't have any lemon extract, so I used a tablespoon each of lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. Lovely cookies!

These cookies are pretty good, but I like to make them smaller than "walnut size".  I used 2 tsp lemon extract, and next time I will add a little more. I suspect that reviewer who complained that these are "too sweet" used the entire 2 cups of sugar in the dough rather than reserving a cup of sugar to roll the dough balls in. This recipe makes very pretty cookies.

These cookies are delicious!  I am a chocolate lover, so I usually only make chocolate desserts, but these lemon cookies are amazing.  My husband really enjoys lemon-flavored treats, and he was eating them right off of the pan as soon as I took them out of the oven!  I combined some of the advice from earlier reviews--doubled the amount of lemon extract, added one tsp of vanilla, and the zest of one small lemon--and they are absolutely fantastic.  Thanks, Tamme.

I loved these!  Sometimes I get a lemon craving just like one gets a chocolate craving, but I do not always have fresh lemons in the house.  These are great because they use lemon extract.  The corn syrup is a perfect addition because they provide extra moistness - corn syrup is good in any suger type cookie for just that reason.  I use a Silpat to bake on so it took more like 15 minutes per sheet to bake instead of 12.

I doubled the recipe and they turned out perfect. Followed (doubled) recipe exactly, except for the parchament paper. I just lightly sprayed the cookie sheet with canola oil.  For those whose cookies don't seem to turn out, it's not the recipe's fault. Substituting margerine for butter, for example, can make a huge difference in a cookie. There is a good advice article on this site about the "science" behind cookies and how each ingredient affects the outcome. An oven thermometer is also a great tool to have (they cost as little as $4). Anyway, these cookies are great. They manage to be crispy and chewy at the same time. And for us, the lemon flavor is plenty strong.

I added some grated lemon peel to the dough and kept it in the fridge while one batch was baking.  I didn't have any trouble roling them as long as they were cold.  Next time I will use less sugar.  The sweet seemed to overpower the lemon.  They were also a lot chewier than I expected.  They have been well eaten by everyone in my home though.

I'm so surprised at how much I like these!  I expected something pleasant but not too special, but these are some of the best cookies I've ever made.  I used about 3 tsp. fresh lemon juice because I didn't have extract, and I grated some zest into it too.  These are a lot like snickerdoodles, but the lemon taste is a spectacular alternative to cinnamon.  Thanks!

These were very good but not lemony enough. I used bottled lemon juice instead of extract. I found that the flavor came through nicely, but again, not strong enough. However, the cookies were a tad too butter tasting for me. But it also might have to do with the fact that I didnt refrigerate the dough. My cookies came out fine, nice and crisp.

After reading several reviews I made just a couple additions.  I added 2 tsps lemon extract, the zest of one lemon, and the juice from one lemon.  It was perfect.  I couldn't imagine leaving it out.  Seems it wouldn't have much lemon flavor.  Or maybe we are just lemon nuts.  :)  I didn't have any parchment and just assumed it was stated to use for clean up purposes.  I learned with my first batch why it needs it.  My cookies stuck to the pan.  No biggie, just sprayed the pan with Pam for the remainder.  These are very delicate cookies so be gentle with them.  Slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Use a cookie scoop for sure and rolling in sugar makes them very pretty and yummy.  Will definitely make again.

Wonderful recipe.  I substituted honey for the corn syrup and used lemon zest and the juice of a small lemon in place of the extract.  I slightly increased my flour to make up the difference.   Cookies had a great taste, but are slightly tricky to bake.  Keep an eye on them, no matter what the timer says.  Mine needed a few extra minutes. Highly recommend using the parchment paper.

These cookies are easy and excellent! I followed the recipe exactly, except for substituting lemon juice/lemon zest for the extract. The juice really gave the cookies a fresh lemony taste that just melts in your mouth. I also added some yellow food coloring to make the cookies lemony in look as well as taste. The result was a beautiful, delicious cookie I would recommend to anyone!

These are excellent cookies. I rolled my dough into balls and put them in the freezer on a baking sheet to firm up. Once firm, I tossed most of the dough into a ziploc freezer bag and only baked a few. These are great, but you need to majorly up the lemon. I used the juice of a whole lemon and some of the zest. I wanted a pretty yellow cookie, so I added some Wilton Lemon Yellow coloring to the dough.

Delicious, chewy cookie!!!  I doubled the lemon extract and added a few drops of yellow food coloring to enhance the lemony experience, though, and also added a cup of white chocolate chips.  Because of the white chocolate, I used only 1 and a half cups of sugar, and it was PERFECT.  These cookies DO expand, though, so keep about three inches between them on the baking sheet.  I'll definitely make them again!  THANKS!

Lovely cookies!  I added some lemon zest and doubled the extract as recommended.  Also dipped them in colored sugar before baking - added a little extra pizzaz.  One suggestion to those whose cookies came out very flat: chill dough before putting in the oven (just put cookie sheet in the fridge ) for a few minutes before sticking in the oven.  AND make your balls a little bigger.  I made my first ones small because I prefer smaller cookies - and they were very thin and runny.  Then I rolled the balls bigger - the cookies came out the same size - but were thicker - like the photo!  Anyway - lovely lemon cookies!   Thanks so much!

These cookies are AMAZING!  I am not a huge lemon fan, but I love girl scout lemonade cookies so I thought these sounded similar... they did not disappoint!  I tried adding a lemon glaze to some of them and that made them even better... I am addicted to these cookies!  Also, I took some reviewers suggestions and doubled the amount of lemon extract.  I was a little worried at first thinking they would be too lemony, but they weren't at all, they turned out perfect.  This is going into my recipe box, it is a new family favorite!

Simply delicious!  My hubby loves lemon cake and so I decided to try lemon cookies for him.  He is addicted.  Big hit in our home.  I highly recommend them.

awesome flavor ... light and delicious. i did as another recommended and used 1tbls of lemon zest and 1 teaspoon of lemon juice instead of the extract and it was delicious. chilling the dough is SO important ... can not skip that step.

Excellent cookies!  The only addition I made is to add some course sugar after rolling in granulated sugar for texture.  These cookies are extremely easy to make and are absolutely delicious.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Unfortunately, when I made these, I FORGOT to double the lemon extract when I doubled the recipe. So, they turned out as "Sugar tea cookies with a hint of lemon." They were still delicious: and the texture was perfect! Crispy on the outside, soft and chewy on the inside! I can't wait to make them again (this time with ALL the ingredients), maybe with a citrus or lime drizzle on top....

My cookie jar was empty and I was looking for something different to fill it other than the usual chocolate chip, oatmeal or sugar cookie I usually bake.  I thought these sounded good, so I decided to give them a try.  I have only one complaint...the recipe does not make enough cookies!  These cookies are so yummy, they were devoured within a couple hours by some friends that came by for a visit.  I am now waiting for my dough to chill so I can bake more cookies as my kids hardly got any.  Needless to say, I am baking a double batch! I followed the recipe exactly except I did add about a teaspoon of lemon zest which gave the cookies a good lemon flavor.

After looking at everyone's reviews, these are the changes I made. To help with the sticky dough, I added an extra 1/4 to 3/8 of a cup of flour, and it didn't make the cookies chalky at all. Definitely chill these to both help prevent spreading and it also makes it easier to roll in the sugar. I also added a tsp of vanilla (only because I like vanilla in all my cookies). Here's the big one though: I used 4 TBSP of RealLemon because I already had that instead of lemon extract, and I could still barely taste it, so I will add more next time. Excellent sugar cookie though! :-D

Baked these lovely cookies for my daughters cake sale at school but used golden syrup instead of corn syrup and fine lemon zest and juice instead of lemon extract-they were gone before the sale started(her teachers got there first).Really easy to make and melt in your mouth!

I used lemon extract, plus zest and a squeeze of lemon juice. I also added a tablespoon of poppy seeds and the combination was amazing. Lovely recipe, I really liked it.

I enjoyed making them and my crew likes eating them. I did not use any corn syrup and I added real leamon juice (2 tablespoons) instead of extract plus lemon peel (1 tablespoon). If I make them again I would add more lemon peel. But they are soft and very tasty.

Very good recipe!  I omitted the lemon extract and used the rind from 1 lemon, 2 tsp. lemon juice and 1/8 tsp of salt with the salted butter.  After the cookies set for awhile they lose some of the lemony flavor but still a yummy cookie!!

Good Recipe but simply not lemony enough.  I followed recommendations and doubled the lemon extract (and also rolled in lemon juice, then sugar before baking) and still craved more lemon -- so I ended up drizzing a little lemon juice over the cookies when out of the oven   (next time these would be wonderful with lemon icing, of course then they aren't really tea cookies then ... LOL )  Overall not bad, just too lite on the lemon for my tongue buds :)

These are absolutely delish!  I took the advice of a few reviewers and doubled the lemon extract - recipe needs that.  Also found that baking on a higher rack in the over creates more "poof."

FYI - These do not work well in cookie cutters. They cling to the cutters, are too sticky to move (even cold), and then spread so much in the oven that they just became circles anyway. Delicious, but just form them into balls as the recipe suggests (you don't have to flatten them though). I would've given them 5 stars if they'd stayed thicker (even the balls spread too thin for my preference).

All in all a pretty good cookie, however I did add an extra teaspoon of lemon extract andf 1/4 teaspoon of lemon zest. They may mellow overnigt and have a little more lemon flavor. but I would make them again.

Love this recipe! The cookies came out thin and chewy with a subtle lemony flavor. I followed the basic recipe with only a few exceptions. I added 1 teaspoon of lemon zest & a squeeze from 1/2 a lemon to the batter. I omitted rolling them in sugar before baking. After the cookies baked & cooled I frosted them with powdered sugar frosting. [1 cup powdered sugar, 1 tsp. lemon extract, 1 drop of red food coloring(to make pink), & 1 tblsp. milk. These cookies would be delicious even without the frosting and just rolled in sugar like the recipe states. They had the pleasant taste of lemonade! Great for a tea party! Thanks...this one is a keeper!

This cookie was easy to make and had a nice chewey texture. My kids loved them.
For me, they were a little too sweet and not quite lemony enough. Next time I might try 1/2 Cup less sugar and either more lemon extract or lemon zest - or both. :)

I seldom give a one star review but I must be honest and say that this lemon cookie was greasy and flat. We made it twice just because we thought that surely we'd made a mistake. However the second attempt was just as greasy and flat. I would NOT recommend this recipe.

These cookies were delicious! I changed butter for shortening, lemon extract for fresh lemons, I added 1/4th teaspoon of oil because the were a little dry,  and I didn't roll them in sugar; instead I dusted them with powdered sugar. I also added lemon zest into the recipe and on some of the cookies. I cooked them for ten minutes at 300° Fahrenheit. Thanks for the recipe!

Really yummy sugar cookie but not at all what I was looking for. I wished they had been crispy and thin and actually tasted like lemon. I tripled the amount of lemon and could taste none of it.

These are really good!  The only thing different I did was to use 1 tsp. of lemon extract and 1 tbsp. lemon juice.  Other than that, I followed the recipe.  Mine didn't spread out and get super flat like so many said.  They are just "normal" cookies!  Glazed half with powdered sugar/lemon juice glaze and left the other half with just the sugar.  Will definately make again.

These cookies are wonderful.  I will definitely be making them again.  The only change I made was instead of 1 tsp of lemon extract I used the zest from one lemon and the juice from half a lemon.

Made these for a party and they were a hit! I used 1.5 tsp of lemon extract and they still were not very lemony. I might add an extra tsp next time. But they were still delicious! Great alternative to my usual choc chip cookies. Will definitely make again! Edit - Oh yeah, I forgot to add that I did not have corn syrup, so I used honey instead. It worked great!

I would give this cookie 10 stars if I could. Its THAT good. My grandmother bought some cookie dough from a school fundraiser a couple christmas's ago and I thought they were the best cookies i had ever eaten, but she couldnt remember for the life of her what company made the cookies. These cookies taste exactly like those cookies!!!!! I altered the recipe just a tad. I put in a TBSP of lemon extract and added the zest of one lemon. Then at the end I added craisins!! Thanks for posting this recipe!!

These cookies were just right.  For the people who complained they were too sweet:  the recipe calls for lemon EXTRACT not lemon JUICE.  There's a big difference.  They're about as sweet as lemonade.
I found that the dough didn't need to be refrigerated, it was solid enough as is.  I made them with margarine, and only used about 1/4c sugar to coat the cookies.

I loved the crunchy/chewy consistency of these no-fail cookies! I used 1 TBSP of lemon extract and a few drops of yellow food coloring.  I've also substituted the lemon for raspberry extract and orange extract.  Both great revisions!

We have a sweet tooth in our house but these cookies were MUCH too sweet. The texture of the cookie wasn't bad... chewy -when first out of the oven and crispy when they are cool.

3 WORDS TO DESCRIBE THIS RECIPE...... AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!  This past weekend I have made 3 batches of these cookies, they were a hit at Thanksgiving.  I altered the recipe just a bit, added 1 tsp. of vanilla and used 2 tsp. of Lemon extract instead of 1 and rolled them in a combination of powered and regular white sugar.
I totally blew my diet with these cookies

I made these for an afternoon tea party at an elderly home.  They were a hit.  In the end, my cookie plate was the only empty one.

Don't know if I mixed something wrong, but the dough was really sticky, making it hard to role in sugar.

These cookies were just alright. I more than doubled the extract and it still wasn't lemon-y enough. I wish I had some lemon peel to throw in. My boyfriend was totally underwhelmed. I added a lemon glaze and that helped a lot. A lemon frosting might work on these too. I'm not sure if I will try to tinker with this recipe or just move on. The texture was really nice though.

I love these cookies but the reason I only gave it a 4 star review is because I had to add a lot more lemon extract to get the real lemon flavor. I used 1 whole bottle of extract (yes, gets expensive if making a lot), to a double batch as our families like the real lemon flavor. Wasn't tart but the smell and taste was oh so good! Thanks for the recipe!

Exceptionally delightful... just finished tea and cookies.  I took a raters suggestion and used lemon juice and zest, and added vanilla extract (gramma would insist) but the overall cookie was so delightful and would use lemon extract just to have the yummy dunking cookie!

I only gave it 4 stars since my experience could have been my fault. I made the cookie exactly as directed and while the cookie was tasty, I had no lemon flavor. I was really wanting a nice pronounced lemon flavor and it just wasn't there. I may try it again with more lemon.

Good, but not nearly enough lemon flavor. To make up for this, we made a strong lemon frosting from another lemon cookie recipe I had - and then they were amazingly addictive!

This cookie is practically perfect!  Bake til lightly brown for tender and chewy or a couple more minutes for a crunchier milk-dipper.  Either way, they're really great.  Boost the health factor by subbing 1 1/2 c whole wheat pastry flour plus 1/2 c unbleached flour, evaporated cane sugar, unsalted butter plus 1/3 t sea salt, and agave nectar for the corn syrup.  If you stir the dry ingredients into the wet just until there is no dry powder showing - no longer, and refrigerate the dough for an hour, your cookies will be nice and tender (over mixing will make them tough.)  Oh, and you're going to want to make a double batch!  :)

I made these for my birthday last year when I put together a tea party and they were a big hit! They sure are sweet but loved that they had lemon zest to offset that sweetness. So crispy on the outside but chewy in the middle, perfect little cookie for tea. Thanks for this wonderful recipe, it will now be a staple at my tea parties!

Awesome.  I have wanted lemon cookies for weeks and finally made them.  I didn't have lemon extract or I used half of a lemon juiced and the zest from it.  Turned out GREAT!

These lemony cookies were sweet, chewy, and delicious! Our entire family enjoyed this perfect summer snack, which was a delightful change from the usual sugar cookie. Followed directions exactly, only rolled in half sugar, half yellow sugar sprinkles for fun and color.

Very easy and quite tasty! I agree the lemon flavor was subtle. I used lemon juice in the recipe, and omitted the corn syrup as I did not have any. I put more lemon juice in a spray bottle and spritzed the finished cookies while still hot out of the oven. This did the trick for upping the lemon flavor.

YUM! These cookies are delicious!   I did substitute for things I didn't have, and they are still amazing! Instead of extract, I used zest and juice (2TB) of a small lemon, and instead of corn syrup I used honey. Very good recipe.

These cookies really hit the spot. I just had a real craving for a lemony dessert, and since I had all the ingredients I tried these! The only thing I would change next time is to add more lemon extract. I used 1 tsp., but also the zest of one lemon and it still wasn't lemony enough for me...but others may think differently! I will be making these for family at Christmas.

I was sorely disappointed with this recipe; my main complaints are that the cookies spread extremely thin and that they came out extremely greasy. They also had a quick burning point--10 minutes was too little, and 11 minutes made them start to burn on the edges, which created an awful burnt butter smell. I was hoping for a thick, chewy cookie, and instead I got something that I would be embarrassed to serve to company. I followed the recipe, so I'm not sure why I had bad results and so many others had great results. I did leave the batter in the fridge for several hours instead of just one, so maybe that had something to do with it. I may try them again at some point, following the instructions to refrigerate for only one hour and watching the baking time very closely. However, I don't recommend this recipe to others.

I've made this recipe a whole bunch of times, and they've been perfect! I've done it both with lemon extract, and substituting fresh lemon zest/juice as well.    The longer you leave them in the fridge, the less they'll spread and the more of a sugar cookie texture they'll have. Sometimes I make the dough a day or two ahead, just make sure you let it warm up a bit before trying to use - it gets rock solid!

Wow! I was really impressed with how these turned out. My whole family liked them (including the four-year-old), and they were all gone within the second day. Fantastic :)

All we had in the house was whole wheat flour the first time I made these. I was very worried that they would come out weird but they were delicious anyway. Later I made them with normal all purpose flour. I have to say I actually prefer them with the wheat flour. :) Rolling them in sugar is definitely a must- they were better that way. Great recipe!

These were delicious! I could, however, tell from the beginning that they'd need more lemon, so I used probably a tablespoon of lemon extract . . . seems like a lot but they were so good!

Ok, I dont know what happened with mine. But they turned out as flat as a pancake.Well actually I have made pancakes thicker than these. The only change I made was I added juice from a lemon instead of extract. They had an ok flavor but since they were so thin they just fell apart.

these are really nice tea cookies. i did add the zest of a lemon and about a TB or so of juice from a lemon as well as a bit of extract to punch up the lemon flavour.   my cookies didn't turn out as flat as most of the photos...maybe cause i rolled them smaller? or maybe i had to flatten them. either way they still tasted delicious..i'm mailing some off today!

AMAZING Cookie!  I followed it exactly except I put about 1 1/2 tsp of lemon extract with about 1/2 tsp of lemon juice and then I mixied in about 1tsp of Watkins lemon peel to the flour mixture.  The lemon flavor comes out more when you put them in the fridge overnight. My family have told me that this is their new favorite cookie! Deffinately will make again!

I had to make some changes but I'll go ahead and write a review anyway as these cookies were excellent. Used 1/4 cup butter, 1/2 cup coconut oil. Omitted corn syrup. Did not roll in sugar as I thought they were already sweet enough. Added 1/4 cup Meyer lemon juice and zest of half lemon. Used lemon oil instead of extract for huge lemon flavor. Sorry , can't stand when people change the whole recipe and than write the review but have to say that by using the recipe as a base I was able to make some really wonderful cookies. These changes worked out perfectly.

My daughter and I made these and they came out great. We added orange zest and 11/2 teaspoons of lemon extract. The whole family loved them. For a crispier cookie cook just a little longer.

Very easy and delicious. I used part lemon extract and part lemon juice, as I was low on extract. I also added some lemon zest.

I used Lemon juice, and I used a little more than 1 teaspoon, like maybe 1 teaspoonn and 1/4 or so. I ran out of regular flour so I used about 1/4 of it is whole wheat flour. I love the fact that you have to refridgerate it :) It is really good, and sweet, except I do not taste any lemon. None.. well except in one of the 5 cookies I have had so far. They came out soft, and the texture of the dough is really good, but I wish they were harder.

These were sooooo yummy! I made them for my 6 year old sister in law and her cousins and they LOVED them! My bro in law said they were his favorite of my cookies!I did add like 2 tsp of lemon extract for more lemon flavor. I also used self-rising flour in place of the all-purpose and soda and powder and they turned out great. They did not expand much (maybe due to using self-rising flour). I made little "baby" tea cookies...this recipe made like 66 of them!!! Also made a lemon powdered sugar glaze on top....would be even better with a lemon icing!!!! Very good.

These cookies are amazing.  I added extra lemon extract, plus some lemon zest.  Next time I will probable add some lemon juice to cut the sweetness back.  They still were really great.  They were the first to disappear.

Wonderful, chewy cookies! AS others before me did, I used a T. of fresh  lemon juice along with some grated lemon zest since I didn't have the extract.  Also, these cookies were quick to make since I ignored the recipe and did not refrigerate the dough.  I did, however, use cold butter and threw that in the food processor with the sugar, etc. and the butter being cold kept everything firm.  CAUTION: Do NOT throw in the entire amount of sugar listed in the recipe when making the dough. Half of it is supposed to be reserved to roll your dough balls into.  (I did not need more than 1/3 of the amount of sugar listed to roll my dough balls into)

Very cute little cookies.  Not enough lemon flavor for us, and I added a tbs of lemon zest.  We love lemon, though.  Other than that, I really didn't modify the recipe.  I did sub water and brown sugar for the corn syrup, though.  I was worried about spreading, but didn't have a problem with it at all.  12 min at 325 was also perfect for these cookies.  They end up soft and sweet with a touch of lemon flavor.  I'd add a bit less sugar next time and more lemon.  thanks for the recipe!

These are AWESOME. I didn't have any lemon extract though so I used raspberry extract. I substituted honey for the corn syrup too. Thank your for this recipe. It is definately going in my recipe box. Really you could use any extract in these cookies. I was thinking that orange would be good too. I just realized that I screwed up the recipe! I put BOTH cups of sugar in the dough and they still came out wonderful. lol

these cookies were just okay for me. . .not nearly lemony enough.  I topped with a lemon juice-10x sugar glaze to up the flavour.  Also I did them as a drop cookie, without refridgerating or rolling, and they turned out fine.

These cookies taste fine but I had a real problem with the form.  I made them exactly as the recipe called and knew someone had said they are very flat so I spaced them a good distance apart but the whole tray cooked into a flat thin mass.  The next batch I put into muffin tins to see if it would help them keep their shape but they puffed up on the sides with a big indentation in the middle.  That would be fine if you wanted to fill it with preserves or something else but I just can't seem to get these to have a normal shape.

Made them for my family cookie exchange and they were a hit!! I used 1 tbls. of real lemon juice and 1 tbls. of lemon zest and they were so yummy!! A lot of reviewers said that they came out flat well I found out once you roll the dough into balls and then the sugar, place them back into the fridge until they firm up again or for 15 mins, then throw them in the oven and they only take 10 mins to bake and come out much thicker, but with the same chewyness!!! So make sure they aren't at room temp when you put them in the oven!!

EXCELLENT! These cookies are great. Very sweet, so if you don't like too-sweet cookies...these aren't for you. I happen to love sweets so these were perfect for me. Just make sure to watch them and as soon as the edges are a light brown color, TAKE THEM OUT. My kids loved them. Enjoy!

These cookies are on point for the lemon lovers out there. I had to experiment a couple batches to get the right texture. Do not make them bigger than walnut size,because they will spread too much and will fall apart even after they've cooled. Didn't have the lemon extract either, just used the juice and zest(about a tablespoon each) of one lemon. Instead of rolling them in sugar, I just sprinkled it on the top of them. WARNING,HIGHLY ADDICTIVE.

This is a great cookie. I followed the recipe with the exception that I did not have any lemon extract, so I made it with 1/2 tea. almond, and 1/2 a tea. vanilla extracts. I then added the zest and juice of one lemon. Perfect..........I did not refrigerate after mixing (no time) baked straight away.  Served with fresh strawberries, a great compliment to the cookie.
Great add in ideas: (one only) raisins, dried blueberries, dried cranberries, roll in poppy seeds and the sugar mixed. I will be using this recipe alot.....

Melt in your mouth-luscious!  Added the zest of one lemon,  just because I wanted them really lemony.  They came out perfect and very pretty.

These cookies had a wonderful lemon flavor and the texture was perfect...chewy with a little crisp.  They were a tad too sweet but all in all delicious.

I also substituted corn syrup with golden syrup, and added nearly 4 tea spoons of lemon juice + 1 teaspoon lemon zest. I also cut down sugar to 3/4 cup in the mix plus sugar sprinkles and still found it (pleasantly) sweet and  mildly lemony. I tried to make it eggless by replacing 1 egg with almost a tablespoon of white vinegar (although I suspect omitting it altogether might be ok). I can't wait to try another batch with egg and see if there's any difference. I had to bake a bit longer to get a nice golden colour, and mine appeared crispy (yayy!) outside and  just a bit moist inside (and it also spread out nice and round)...maybe I shouldn't have over-baked. I think this is as pure a simple lemon sugar tea cookie should get! :)

These are like a mild lemon snickerdoodle. Very easy to make. Definitely chill the dough to prevent spreading. I like a tart lemon so I made a glaze of lemon juice and powder sugar. We liked them rolled in sugar but liked the frosted ones better.

My daughter wanted to make lemon cookies for Santa so we chose these. Very yummy cookies, I think Santa will be pleased! I also added an extra teaspoon of lemon extract (would not of had enough flavor without it). I did not have parchment paper so I used an ungreased cookie sheet, no problems with sticking or spreading. One tip I might suggest is allowing your butter to come to room temp. I have always had better success with my cookie recipes when I do this.

delightful without being overwhelming. Might try orange or peppermint extract instead next time. The balls do flatten out quite a bit .. leave plenty of space between them. Great for a "higher class" meeting or a spring iced tea party.

These are great!  Kind of sweet, I may cut down on the sugar IN the recipe, since the cookie is covered in sugar.  An easy way to sugar the rolled cookie ball was to put sugar into a small ramekin, then dump the ball in, cover the top with your hand, and shake a couple of times.  A good job for a kid to do.  Thanks!

This truly is a delightful recipe.  I chilled the dough probably 2 hours, and had no trouble handling it.  Baked exactly 12 minutes.  The smell while they were baking was great, and the finished product is very, very good!  Thanks so much for sharing this one, it's a keeper!

Very easy to make but has to be done in advance for dough to chill but well worth the wait.  Kids will have fun rolling cookies in sugar before placing on baking sheet

These are absolutely the BEST lemon cookie I have ever had. Super easy to make and they went great with my tea party. My guest asked if they were store bought! 
I followed the recipe to a "T" and would not modify it at all! 
These are a light tasting lemon cookie that I can (unfortunately) eat numerous in a row.

I added a lot more lemon extract & some lemon juice, but I like lemon a lot. 
I found they do better in smaller balls.
I've made them with regular flour, but just made them with gluten free flour mix & 1/4 tsp xantham gum & they came out just as great.

For part of the extract, I used the juice of a lemon and lemon zest. I also made them into bars by pressing the dough into a 9x13 inch pan and sprinkling with a portion of the allotted sugar, then baked until done.

I also added another teaspoon of lemon extract (although I used fresh lemon juice) I also added 2 tsp of lemon zest. I colored the sugar topping yellow with food coloring. I prepared 3 trays of cookies, then chilled the remaining dough until they were cooked. Fantastic cookie and no spreading of dough. Chewy and crisp outer edge.

Great flavor, but mine were thin. I measured flour carefully, so I'm guessing it was measured without sifting and possibly settled. Also, a measurement on size (3/4" balls baked best). Walnuts have the shell on 'em in my world, so that was 2". Great cookie if more flour and 3/4" ball was baked.

Doubled the lemon extract and used juice of one lemon-thanks for the tips from other reviewers! Chilled in freezer for 30 minutes - it was good enough to work with and form balls.  Wonderful cookie - love the texture.  Chose not to roll in extra sugar.  Used "Sugar Cookie Glaze" from this site.   Thanks for a great recipe!

These cookies turned out perfect! They have a great lemony flavor and they're sweet but not overly so. I didn't have lemon extract so I did what another review did and used  a tbs of lemon juice and a tbs of lemon zest. I also didn't have corn syrup so I just used sugar mixed with water instead. Even with these changes the cookies were still delicious! I'll definitely make them per the exact recipe next time.

I've made this recipe 4 times since finding it a month ago & it is by far the easiest, yummiest, sugar cookie recipe I've found. When my Mom tasted it she said "OMG these are just like the cookies my Grandmother used to make when I was a little girl"

My husband gobbles these up within 2 or 3 days of my making them. I can't make a batch for a potluck unless I make a double batch and leave half home! The only thing I changed is I made a light "drizzle" from powdered sugar and fresh lemon juice and drizzled a little on each cookie. It gives the lemon flavor a kick! Definite keeper recipe. Thanks for sharing.

They were good, but not special.  In addition, mine spread out like crazy, despite having followed the recipe exactly (except for using whole-wheat pastry flour instead of white).  I ended up with nearly one large sheet of lemon crisps.  My dough was completely chilled so I see no reason for this.  Others have said the same in reviews; I should have listened to them.  They were good, just not the results I expected based on the high ratings.

Love it, but it could use a stronger lemon flavor. As is, it tastes much more like a regular sugar cookie. I'm anxious to try it again using lemon extract, juice and a little zest, like others recommended.

These don't taste like lemon cookies, they taste like your standard sugar cookie. I used 3/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup vegetable oil spread. I would suggest rolling in sugar before baking. Great recipe!

These are the real deal!  I have made them several times.  I add lemon peel and juice along with the lemon extract.  I also had 1/2 salt and 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar as I like that cracked top look.  They are fabulous cookies!  Enjoy.

These cookies are GREAT and would have gotten 5 stars if it had more lemon. I put 2 teaspoons of extract the 2nd time I made them and a tablespoon the 3rd time. A tBL is best. I made these instead of sugar to decorate. they worked great! You can not have a better texture than this cookie! thanks!!!!

I made these for my brother in law for his birthday because he loves his tea and enjoys the lemon flavor. They turned out really great! Tastes yummy and easy to make. The lemon flavor is not overpowering and I love the texture. My favorite is how they just melt into perfect circles once they're backed! The only bad thing I can say is that I thought they were a bit oily, but that's more of a personal preference.

These are really great! You can really taste the lemon - I used a little yellow food coloring and tapped the cookie sheets on the counter to make them flat right after taking them out of the oven.

Awesome, awesome cookies.  Loved by all - adults and kids alike.  I add 2 tsp of lemon extract instead of 1.  The cookies disappear really quickly in this household.

I made these with a few changes. Instead of 1 cup of sugar I used 3/4 cup. Added a total of 3 tsp. lemon extract, and I used a yellow decorative sugar to roll one side of the cookie dough ball in. I really liked these, they were chewy, buttery and delicious. It would be fun to experiment with maybe an orange extract or other flavors.

A good cookie, added 1 tsp of vanilla extract as well as 2 tsps. lemon zest. I found if you chill the dough over-night the lemon flavor is much better.

This recipe is great! I used about 3 tsp lemon juice and 2 tsp lemon zest instead of lemon extract. The recipe doesnt say how far to space the cookies, but they do need space! I made a glaze of lemon juice, vanilla extract and powdered sugar. Also crushed some almonds to dust over the top! GREAT recipe! My children keep begging me for more!

My husband loved these so much I now have to bake them weekly. I do suggest adding a little lemon zest to the batter for those who like a stronger lemon taste. But in all a great cookie.

These had a great taste - refreshing and surprisingly light - but didn't rise as much as I would have hoped for.  Loved the texture.  Nearly doubled the lemon extract called for. I will make these again!

I have been looking for a good lemon/orange cookie recipe for a long time! This cookie is also excellent as ORANGE sugar cookies! I just added a couple of tsp. of orange zest and orange extract plus a little orange juice. I also added just a pinch of salt to the dough to bring out the flavors.  LOVE IT! Thanks... Judy ¤

The lemon taste is definitely lacking. Not only did I use 3 tsp. of lemon extract, a whole lemon zested, 1 TBL. of lemon juice, I still could barely taste the lemon! So I went to put in my lemon extract and it spilled! I thought it was a squeeze top but it wasn't. I ended up using 1/2 of the expensive 1 oz. bottle. I am not a huge lemon fan and I really thought I'd have to double the recipe to make up for all the lemon poured in. Well, I kept tasting the batter and it was fine.  To sum it up, yes try the recipe, definitely add more lemon, and taste the batter often! I also put in yellow food dye for a better yellow color. I drizzled yellow icing on them too to make them more inticing.

These were good.  I will make them again and next time, use the lemon extract.  I used lemon juice and couldn't taste much lemon.  I followed another suggestion about dusting with powd. sugar after they are done.  They have a great texture, and I was amazed that they tasted so good even when I used Smart Start tub margarine, because I was out of butter.  I will make again!

WOW!  Super easy and SUPER DELICIOUS!! My husband is crazy for lemony sweets and LOVES LOVES this recipe (ate almost the whole batch himself!).  Followed the recipe as written except for adding about three times the amount (3tsp) of lemon extract (based on previous reviewers suggesting so for more lemon flavor) - still think I could have added even more (for hubby's lemon fetish *winks*).  Still a 5-star recipe no matter what!  Thanks a bunch for submitting.

I used the lemon juice/lemon zest combination because I didn't have extract, and I think it made them come out thinner then I expected.  Next time I would try the recipe as written.  Nevertheless, they had a good taste to them...my kids and spouse gobbled these up right out of the oven!

These cookies are fantastic.   I used the extract which worked perfect- I used about 1 1/2 teaspoons after reading the other reviews.  I decided to roll them out and cut them into heart shapes decorated with edible glitter.  Worked fine just needed to chill the dough and roll it out between two sheets of parchment paper.

These are WONDERFUL!  I used 2 tsp. of lemon extract because I like a definite "lemony" taste.  However, everything stayed the same.  It is so good, we ended up making a double batch.  They are a nice contrast to the heavier variety of cookies.  The kids and I made these for Christmas, but I foresee making these for Easter.

Thank you so much for sharing your wonderful recipe!  I doubled it even though this was my first time making these, and they turned out fabulous!  So quick and easy to make too.  The texture is soft in the middle and crunchy around the edges....just perfect.  This will no doubt be a recipe that I will turn to often, as the cookies don't seem to last long at all!!  :)

This recipe was awesome! It was really easy to follow although I did read the reviews and added 1 more tsp of lemon extract but after I tasted it I would have added another tsp. For me I love tasting a strong lemon taste in my lemon cookies! As for my hubby he doesn't like sweets and lemon stuff but he loved this recipe! Thank you!

I thought the taste of these was really good, but the consistency was more like a light cake??  I think I might have done something wrong, although as far as I can see I followed the recipe to the letter.

The flavor was nice, but I wasn't that impressed with the presentation.  They spread out VERY thin.  They were really great the evening I made them, but by the next day they had become incredibly stale.  I don't think this is quite the lemon cookie recipe I'm in search of.  I will keep looking.

So... I didn't have any white flour, all I had was wheat flour so MAYBE that's what my problem was (I don't know!), but these were a little on the dry side for me. Would that affect them at all? However, I did love the taste of them, not too sweet, not too sour. The sugar on the tops gave them a nice crunch too. I'll try again with white flour.

These were absolutely incredible!I can not eat much sugar, so I substituted Splenda for baking and shortening for corn syrup. Light, lemony perfect cookies. The Splenda makes them crumbly but that is the nature of baking with Splenda. Glad I made a double batch, these will not last long!

This is an absolutely fantastic recipe. These cookies are melt in your mouth good and I will be adding this to my time and time again collection. I did as other members mentioned and increased the lemon extract to one TBSP just because I wanted the extra lemon flavor. I also did a special twist by adding a few white chocolate chips that I needed to get rid of - this addition hit the spot! Highly recommended recipe :)

Mmmmm, so good! Used 1 whole lemon juice and zest as we had no extract, and added poppy seeds to taste. Made this recipe last night, and there are only 5 cookies left today. That says something!

These cookies were really good!!! As some of the other reviewers I also had a different type of cookie in mind then what they turned out to be. But they were very good. I used reallemon juice instead of lemon extract, and you couldn't taste it at all. Also when I took out my first batch of cookies, even after sitting were wayyy to soft and doughy, so I cooked all my others for at least 14 minutess..Anyway good cookies in the end

I have been looking for a sugar cookie with an animal cracker flavor to it.....
I had lost my recipe from Women's Day or Family Circle and it was printed around 12 years ago.  THANK YOU TAMME, this recipe is so sensational!

My sweetie LOVES the taste of lemon. So I've been looking for the perfect lemon cookie recipe. This one just may be it. I made these cookies for a cookie exchange at work. And they were the biggest hit of all! I did make one change. Because we love lemon so much, I added extra lemon extract AND some lemon juice (to taste). I don't think this made the cookies too sweet (as some reviewers have said). You just have to flavor the cookies to match the taste you're after.

I was very disappointed in this recipe, mostly because I anticipated a cookie that looked like the one depicted with the recipe on this site.  Instead, mine spread too thin and darkened and had a very odd texture.  They were okay, but nothing like I imagined they would be, which somehow made them less than ideal.  They were intended for a Christmas open house but I trashed that idea because they were just too ugly.

This is a great cookie recipe.  Slightly crispy, a little chewy, and tastes a lot like a good sugar cookie.  I would have given it 5 stars if the recipe, as it's written, produced cookies that tasted lemony.  I added an extra tsp. of lemon extract (based on other reviews), and I still think I could have added a 3rd, or maybe some rind, for a more pronounced lemon flavor.  But the cookie texture etc is fabulous.  I will def. make these again, but with more lemon extract or rind.

Eh....we were un-impressed with these. They were quite greasy and almost sickeningly sweet. I've loved nearly every cookie recipe I've tried making on allrecipes, but I don't think I'll make these again.

These are good sugar cookies. But with the amount of lemon extract posted you can not taste it.  I doubled the lemon and still could not taste it.  When they cooled, I glazed them with a lemon juice and icing sugar frosting.  Will make them again but triple the lemon extract.

I made these to take over to my in laws for Christmas (my father in law likes lemon things). My mother in law and her sisters raved on them, said that their grandama made cookies just like these and she died before anyone was able to get the recipe for them

These are easily the best cookies I have ever eaten. My whole family just loves them. I followed the advice of another person here and doubled the amount of Lemon Extract to 2 tsp. and added 1 tsp of Vanilla Extract. I didn't have any trouble with the dough being sticky and the texture of the cookies is just great, crisp but chewy. Will be making these again.

These cookies are terrific! I get requests for the recipe whenever I take them somewhere. I did double the lemon extract, and added a couple drops of yellow food coloring.  Also, only 1 cup of sugar goes in the recipe, the rest is for rolling the dough balls in. I made that mistake the first time I made them - then I re-read the recipe :)  Thanks Tamme!

I LOVE eating these cookies when they come right out of the oven. They taste heavenly! Don't worry though, they still taste great even when they cool down. These cookies always impress and delight, though they seem quite simple.  Even those not normally fond of lemons have loved these yummy cookies. Excellent :)

I made these lemon cookies the other day. They came out alright. I used 'real lemon' lemon juice and doubled the amount. I also added some lemon zest. Instead of rolling them in sugar I made a 1 1/4 inch diameter loaf and cut off half-inch sections. When the cookies were baked I put on icing made of beaten eggwhite, lemon juice and powdered sugar. It sounds pretty lemony but they really weren't. Next time I will add some more lemon juice in the cookie as well as the icing.

These are absolutely delicious. I can't wait to make them again. I made them with real lemon juice and added a bit more and it tasted great. Be sure not to cook them too long or they turn dark brown. Still taste the same but not as appealing.

I used golden syrup because I din't have corn syrup. Maybe I'll have to use more butter next time, because the dough was a little dry. (I had difficulties to measure in cups) The dough didn't spread out too much.
Yummie, beautiful, chewy cookies!
Next time I'll put in some lemon zest and vanilla, or cinnamon , for another kind of flavour. You must roll them in  very fine white sugar, or in vanilla sugar!

Really good, light cookies when chocolate seems to heavy for a hot day. Rolled half the batch in sweet flaked coconut but those took longer to bake. The other half omitted the sugar but dusted w/ powdered sugar. I just ate the first one outta the oven and am not sure if I want to share! Easy b/c the ingredients are all on hand! Next: orange extract. YUM

These turned out absolutely amazing and were gobbled up with everyone wanting more.

I wish I could say I followed the recipe exactly, but I didn't have some of the ingredients.  I used honey instead of corn syrup and lemon zest instead of extract. I didnt have the time to let it sit in the fridge, so I did lower the cook time to 10 minutes since the dough wasn't cold.

The cookies were fresh, chewy, and delicious. They had the perfect amount of lemon. The outside of the cookie was slightly crisp, but the inside was so soft.  

amazing cookie and we will be making again.

These are the best cookies I've ever made, and I make a lot of cookies. Slight modification: I had some Meyer lemon syrup, so I used that instead of ther corn syrup. I added both lemon and vanilla extract, since I love the combination. I also added some of the lemon syrup to the dipping sugar, using a fork to mix it in until it was blended. Extra lemony, incredibly delicious.

A complete novice baker over here and these cookies were delicious! Next time I will make the cookie dough balls smaller since the cookies really spread out while baking, but otherwise scrumptious. Not bad for a first time “from scratch” baking attempt!

Very good recipe. I not only doubled the lemon extract and added lemon zest, but I reduced the sugar by 1/4. For a different twist, I ground freeze-dried blueberries in a food processor and mixed them with the remaining sugar and rolled the balls of dough in the mixture before baking. Very nice touch of blueberry.

As everyone is saying- needs more lemon! I tasted the dough until I got the taste I was after and ended up adding  4 teaspoons total of lemon extract (instead of  1t) PLUS fresh lemon rind from 2 lemons- they were VERY lemony then, which I love, but 3 teaspoons should be plenty for normal folks who don't need their tastebuds exploded like I do. 
 Also, I loathe corn syrup, it is the most unhealthy food in the world, so I used 1T honey instead of the called for 2T corn syrup- worked great to make the cookies a little chewy, which is nice for this type of cookie. 
    I recommend baking this cookie until *just* cooked. They are very easy to under bake or over bake. I literally just sit in front of my oven with the oven light on and watch them for three minutes, turn them around so they bake evenly...and then wait until just cooked. 
   Perfect cookie baking is an art form, and one I have not yet mastered, but these are my tips and I hope they help you. I didn't add the extra sugar to roll in because they are already soooo sweet. I also added some lavender leaves.

really nice lemon flavored cookie. like other reviews I found dusting with powdered sugar after baking easier although I don't know if it's better still so delicious. I did bake these without chilling the dough and found that worked out better than first batch I did chill but again could be my climate or the season but however you make them 5 stars all the way

Great tasting cookies! I used maple syrup instead of corn syrup and it worked out just fine! I love this recipe because it tastes so good and my family loves it! Thank you for sharing this recipe with everyone on the website!

These cookies are so good. I highly recommend lemon zest and fresh lemon juice. It really brings the lemon flavor to the forefront. My whole family loves these.

Good Cookies!  Next time I am adding more lemon and lemon zest. These cookies remind me of my Mom’s Lemon Sugar Cookies. I also added 1/2 tsp of salt!

I made these and they turned out spectacular!! I used Lemon Vitality oil and put it to taste, and instead of corn syrup I used half honey and half syrup. They turned out with crunchy edges and a soft thin middle. Loved It!!

They flatten out a lot and are a little too buttery. Cut the butter by just a little bit. Also, I ended up using lemonade mix rather than lemon. That added to the lemon flavor where you could actually taste it.

I used 2 tsp of lemon extract and the zest of one lemon. I only rolled the top of the rolled dough in the sugar and baked for 15 min. The cookies came out perfect. I will definitely make them again.

OMG, these are outstanding!!  I followed the recipe EXACTLY.   Perfectly delicious.  A breeze to throw together.  I used a very small cookie scoop (about 1 tablespoon) which made the perfect size cookies.  They spread a good bit so some of mine were too close together and ended up touching.  No big deal.  I just know to space them better next time.  Just the right amount of lemon flavor.  I saw a couple people complain there wasn't enough lemon flavor, but they used lemon juice instead of extract.  Extract has much more intense flavor than juice so be sure to use extract.  Texture was great.  I also saw some complaints about them being greasy.  I did not have that issue at all.  
Can't wait to make them again!

This is great. Still not enough lemon for my mother, but I could always make a lemon curd for her...

I used 3 tsp of lemon extract and added 1 tsp of lemon peel.

Also, I made a simple syrup since I did not have any light corn syrup. (What did have was dark corn syrup that expired in Oct 2016....oops.)

Even though they're not lemony enough for my mother, it hasn't stopped her from eating them. Haha. My dad even likes them well enough and he's not a sweet-eater like Mom and I are.

I suggest using a 1/2 Tbsp to scoop out the dough.

I will be making these again.

With a couple of changes, this is the *perfect* base for a soft sugar cookie. Add 1/2 cup of flour, swap the extract for vanilla (lemon is good, but vanilla is better imo. I plan to try almond as well), and be sure to chill for at least 1.5 hours. Cookies come out soft and not too sweet. Be sure to watch for overbaking to prevent caramelization and a crunchy "ring" on the outside of the cookie  -- the low temperature and short baking time is just right to keep the cookies soft and looking beautiful.

Solid recipe. I've made this several times for church functions, and while these cookies will never be star of the show, they offer good balance to a cookie tray, and are easy to make. I've always followed the recipe to the letter--the chilling the dough, the parchment paper, etc. I think omitting these steps to save time would compromise the results.

The recipe is perfect when you use powdered sugar instead of plain sugar at the end.  I’d suggest an air bake pan over a ceramic.  Bakes better with this recipe.

These are really very good.  I had to make a variation on the recipe, because I live in Guatemala and lemons, as we know them, don't exist here.  I used the zest and juice from a large lime instead of the extract, and as my husband put it, just tart enough and not too sweet.  

Because of the amount of juice in lime -- if you put one or two in the microwave for about 20 seconds you will get a lot more juice -- I added a couple tablespoons of coconut flour to the dough.  Okay, and then I tossed in a handful of white chocolate chips.  

These baked up perfectly, not runny or spread out at all.  They are softer than I usually like, but the flavor is perfect.  I definitely recommend you use parchment paper.  Let the cookies cool completely and they come off the paper easily.   Otherwise, I had a few that wanted to stick even to the paper.  These will definitely go into the box to be made again, as limes are plentiful and very inexpensive, and we love the flavor.  Thank you for a great recipe.

Very delicious.  Easy to make.

Followed other's advise:  added fresh squeezed lemon and lemon zest.  Had to freeze dough for about an hour before rolling dough.

I did not use the corn syrup.  Not a fan.  Not sure what they taste like with the corn syrup - but they were fabulous without it.

Overall, this came out very nice for my first try.  I think if I make it again, I'm going to add more lemon extract, (it wasn't as lemony as I like) but other than that, it came out very nice, and I recommend this for soft cookie lovers everywhere

Great recipe even though I made one change, which I will not do next time; I substituted fresh lemon juice for the extract.  Baking time is perfect, but if you want them to have a slight crunch, bake for an additional 2 minutes.

After reading some of the reviews, I tripled the lemon.  I still don't taste lemon at all, but I do taste corn syrup.  The cookies look great and taste ok, but I specifically made these because I wanted lemon cookies.   I probably won't make them again because the lemon taste just isn't there, in my opinion.

These are so delectable!  I read some of the reviews after I had prepared the cookie dough and put it in the fridge for an hour and ten minutes.  You definitely want to refrigerate the dough to have it very firm when it goes into the oven.  This will keep them from completely melting as soon as they go in and cut down on the spreading.  I noticed some reviewers said that they didn't have lemon extract so they used lemon juice and therefore there was not enough lemon flavor in the finished cookies.  The lemon extract and fresh lemon juice are not at all the same thing.  The extract is much more concentrated and the one teaspoon of lemon extract gives this cookie the perfect amount of lemony deliciousness!  I had a fresh bottle of Watkin's lemon extract that I used one teaspoon of.  I didn't roll the cookies in extra sugar and they sure don't need that!  They are perfectly sweet without the added rolling in sugar!  I used a walnut sized cookie scoop that made short work of getting the dough balls on the parchment covered cookie sheets.  Also, using the cookie scoop prevents the heat from your hands melting/softening the butter in the dough.  The cookies were done in 12 minutes and they didn't spread into each other.  My hubby said these cookies are most delicious and I have to completely agree!  This is a lovely, lemony cookie that would go beautifully with a nice cuppa tea!  Update:  I tried two teaspoons of the lemon extract this time to see how that was as we love lemon flav

Followed the recipe exactly as it was and it came out great, so easy. I doubled the lemon extract for future batches, though, as I like it extra lemon-y.

I used only half of sugar, and it tasted good as well. However, 325F/12 mins may be too long.

I will make these again. The first time I did not have lemon extract . I used lemon rind and juice. It still turned out great! I now have lemon extract I will make the recipe as printed. I may have to update the recipe.

I agree with other reviewer, would like them a little more lemony.  May try again and sub out fresh lemon juice and lemon zest for the extract as another reviewer suggested.  Really liked the texture; chewy inside and crisp outside!

Very delicious cookie!  I followed  the recipe as described, except I didn't roll the dough in granulated sugar before baking.  Instead, I sprinkled confectioners sugar on the cookies after baking.  Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I was craving a lemony treat and had some fresh lemons on hand so I made these cookies.  They were so delicious! I made a few changes based on what I had on hand. Instead of lemon extract I used 2 tbs of fresh lemon juice and about a tsp or two of lemon zest (based off other reviews I wanted more lemon flavor). Instead of the corn syrup I used the same amount of honey.  I didn't have any baking powder so I added an extra 1/4 tsp of baking soda and 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar.  Instead of rolling in sugar I opted to dust with powdered sugar after cooling.  These cookies were easy to make and so yummy.  Just the right amount of lemon flavor and SO SOFT and chewy which is exactly what I wanted.  I can't stop eating them!

I didn't have any lemon extract, so I used the juice and zest of one lemon instead.  I used a cookie scoop and got about 30 cookies.  Put the batter in the fridge between batches to keep it cold.  Everyone loved them!

I don't know why anyone changed this recipe. I followed EXACTLY  and they are EXCELLENT.  Perfect taste of lemon and they bake just beautiful round cookies glittering with sugar crystals. Only advice is invest in air bake cookie sheets and don't use regular cookie pans, which tend to burn bottom of cookies. Big hit with family. Loved loved loved them.

Even though I took others advice and added real lemon juice, zest and another spoon of lemon extract, these were still not the big lemon hit I was hoping for. They were more like a sugar cookie with a hint of lemon. A few were bigger than the others, and they didn't cook as nicely (so had to eat those - too sloppy looking!) But they were nice and chewy and overall a pretty good cookie.

Very easy.  I made my cookies a little too large and it made 40 cookies.  Probably would easily yield 50 good sized cookies.  I doubled the lemon extract as per other suggestions.  Everything else the same.  Took mine about 16 minutes to cook.  Maybe due to size.  My husband does not like softer cookies, but he love these!

I followed some other reviewers and used lemon juice and lemon zest instead of extract.  I also added some white chocolate chips to about half the dough and decided both ways were good.  I used my small scoop and got about 40 cookies.  I will definitely keep it in my rotation.

The only change I made was to use lemonade drink mix in lieu of the extract. This gives a HUGE punch of flavor so there is no question of whether it is lemon or sugar flavored.

1st. these came out perfect. Remaining dough i rolled into balls and froze on cookie sheet then bagged in freezer for another time. 2nd time my frig. got turned down so they didnt get cold enough. put em in another 15min. then did just like above. Amazing cookies everytime! make a double batch so you have more on hand. these go fast.fyi.I pick lemons from tree, squeeze put into ice tray freeze for future baking needs.

I made these and they had a great texture but they were not have a strong enough lemon flavor for my taste. I would definitely make them again but I would add a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice to amp up the flavor.

I added juice from half a Meyer lemon and zest of the whole lemon. Husband and daughter loved the cookie and its fresh tasting lemon flavor. You could see it in their faces as they ate :). The cookies were a bit flat. I thought they were ok

So I replaced the 1 cup of sugar with 1 cup of country time lemonade mix since I haven't met a lemon cookie with enough lemon kick. They are almost ready so I shall see if my meddling has paid off........super lemony but a little stiff so I cooked the second batch a little less.

Amazing cookie. I did make a change though. I did NOT chill the dough and it's still delicious. So good! I will make this again. It's very easy. YUM!

My husband was craving lemon zesty cookies and they hit the spot! ???????? Quick, easy , delicious recipe! I didn't have corn syrup so I used tbs of grade A maple syrup. I didn't have much time so I melted the butter in the mic.  Used a hand beater and mixed sugar and butter as much as I could.  Didn't have time to cool the dough for two hrs.  15 min was what I had to work with and still they came out so be so delicious.  I glazed them with a lemon glaze recipe found on the web. Girl Scout lemonade lemon glaze. 1 cup of powder sugar. 2 tbs of milk and 1.5 tbs lemon juice and voila!

It was very good and I really liked it, but there wasn't much of a lemon flavour, but the cookies were very soft and chewy. I definitely will make it again.

I doubled the lemon extract but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  This is a quick and easy recipe which I loved.  The cookies had just the perfect balance of a chewy center and crispy edges.  I didn't feel like waiting an hour to refrigerate so I used a just spoon to drop the dough on the cookie sheet.  Each cookie was a perfect circle!  My kids and hubby loved them so this recipe will be added to my regular cookie rotation.  I'll probably double the recipe the next time I bake these.

This recipe is easy and amazing! I love it! My kids love it, too, which is always a plus. Quick tip, if you love the almond cookies that are sold in the Chinese restaurants, switch out the lemon extract for pure almond extract. Delish!

The mixture was terrible. Followed the recipe to a T and it just wouldn't harden enough to be handled. It was more like a cake. Very disappointing and a complete waste of ingredients.

Great recipe! comes out perfect every time but have to adjust time and temp depending on the oven I use, also added 1/4 cup extra flour so they wouldn't be too flat. This recipe doubles perfectly!

Wonderful texture and a hint of lemon. One of the best cookie recipes I've ever made! In the oven, they go from chewy to crisp (both of which are delicious) in 60 seconds, so watch them closely if you make them.

This cookies yells SUMMER! I used 1 tsp of fresh lemom juice and ! TBL of lemon zest, but the dough didn't smell lemony enough so I added a drop of lemon extract, that's it. Other than that I followed the recipe to a T. Don't understand the corn syrup, but used it anyway. I did not use parchment (never do) just the cookie sheet and nothing else, came out fine. Hubs loved um. A great change up from the choc chip and peanut butter that I always make. Will not disappoint. :)

This is a great recipe!  I made no alterations, except sprinkling with powdered sugar rather than rolling them in granulated sugar.  A little crispy on the edges and chewy inside; a great lemon taste.  This one stays in my recipe box!   Thanks for sharing!

These are amazing! It's really hard to find a decent sugar cookie; one that's not too crunchy but still tastes great. And these were the perfect blend. I have a lot of friends that don't like lemon flavored cookies, but it's just the right tinge, not too much. A family favorite for us!

Loved it! Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, with a nicely pronounced lemon flavor. I did use the freshly squeezed lemon juice and some zest, and on top of that I also added the lemon icing which I thought helped to intensify the flavor. Boyfriend declared them his favorite cookies! Awww.

If you're looking for a light lemon flavored cookie that won't overpower your excellent coffee then this is the cookie for you!  It is chewy with just a hint of crunch. Marvelous!

Crispy and chewy, wonderful cookies! Replaced the lemon extract (didn't have any) with a tblsp of lemon juice and a tsp of lemon zest. I didn't roll them in sugar, but I did flatten them out a bit with my fingers before baking, they spread about 1 inch on each side.

These cookies tasted fine (I used real lemon instead of the extract as that is what I had on hand), but I wasn't a fan of how much they flattened out (even though they looked just like the picture).  I added some cranberries to them and it was a nice compliment to the lemon and gave them some extra pops of color.

Wow!  Nice basic cookie dough mix that worked with what I had on hand.  My first attempt at cookies and the dough slid so much I though it had skates on. All over the pan. I now know how to prevent that. I didn't add baking powder. Just the baking soda the recipe required, a bit more sugar, and a pinch of salt. I didn't have parchment paper..so I sprayed a pizza pan with Pam buttery flavor..voila, no sticking whatsoever!  LOL! Also, I added a little more lemon extract..but it barely made it lemony they way I really like.  Next time  I will add also lemon zest or lemon juice.  I think that will do it.  My thanks for taking the time to give us the recipe! Simple directions enough that I didn't screw it up.  That's saying a lot!  Blessings!

This cookies were AMAZING. I made 20 and pulled them out of the oven like 10 minutes ago and they are almost gone! I changed some things I had no lemon extract so I used 1 tsp. of lemon juice and 1 tbsp. of lemon zest. Plus a tsp. of vanilla for flavor :) These were soft chewy and delicious. Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!

This cookie recipe is so amazing that I knew I just had to sign into this account that I never used to give it 5 stars!!! I've tried a lot of different kind of sugar cookie recipes and this one is amazing. So buttery, so moist and light. Not too sweet! The only think though is that I wish I would have put extra lemon extract in it. I usually so but I wasn't sure if I should. The lemon taste is faint for my cookie. But it's still a great, simple recipe!

Such a wonderfull recipe.. I have made theme time and time again. Sometimes I use orange zest and a few teaspoons of juice, and roll in cinnamon and surgar. but any way is great. I like how after they are baked they sparkle. It is just a perfect recipe. Always a hit.

These were awesome cookies! I added a little extra lemon extract and 1/2 teaspoon of almond and vanilla extract. I had to put them in a bag and hide them because my younger sisters kept eating them!

Delicious! Substituted the lemon extract with a tablespoon of fresh lemon juice. Just the right amount of lemony flavor, and great chewy texture!

Yummy!

Great cookies, they are rich and therefore you cannot eat too many of them. I added more lemon extract and lemon zest. I also made them a little smaller. But they are very chewy and soo soo good... I will make these again... a keeper for sure!

These were just okay. I did keep adding lemon juice in hopes to increase the lemon flavor, but it changed the cookie from having a more crispyness to more cakey like consistency, which I wasn't crazy about.  So, that's my fault. I might try again, but I really have been searching for a very lemony crunchy cookie.  Guess I will have to keep searching!

I made the cookies again, and it turn out really good. The first time i made these, they were puffy and had a bitter after taste to them. This time i decrease the oven temperature (my oven seem to be 25-50 degrees off), and they came out flat. Would make this again.

I too made the mistake of creaming in 2 cups of sugar with the butter instead of reserving one cup for rolling the dough, so I made another batch without the sugar, and mixed them up together. Still came out pretty and yummy. Will definitely make again.

Yummy!!  They were nice and chewy on the inside and perfectly crispy on the outside.  I did double the amount of lemon extract and still thought it could use a little more, other then that, they were perfect!

Very tasty cookies!  But don't expect them to be soft.  These are thin, and a bit crispy on the outside.  I used one tsp. of lemon extract and 1.5 tsp. of lemon zest and found that to be plenty of lemon flavoring.

Very good!  It was a more subtle lemon taste than I would have preferred . . . next time I would probably double the lemon extract and add a teaspoon of lemon zest.  I only needed about 1/3 cup sugar to roll the cookies in, so you might want to pour it out 1/3 cup at a time to save ingredients.  Also, the cookies spread out more than expected on the pan.  I would freeze the dough next time.

Given the reviews I thought these cookies would be GREAT!  They're good, don't get me wrong, but nothing out of the ordinary.  I do like that they can be made with ingredients I already have at home (now that I bought lemon extract), and I may make them again for that reason, but they're nothing to write in my blog about :)

These cookies do taste very nice, but they definitely took longer than 12 minutes (about 15)and unfortunately I didn't have any parchment paper so they bent way out of shape when I removed them from the pan (when I left them in the pan to cool, they stuck really bad!)But overall, they are pretty tasty. The recipe is so easy so I will try them one more time with parchment paper :)

Great, easy lemony cookies. They spread out a lot so keep in mind when placing on pans. I didn't roll in the extra sugar just dusted with confectioner's sugar after slightly cooled. Good cookies.
