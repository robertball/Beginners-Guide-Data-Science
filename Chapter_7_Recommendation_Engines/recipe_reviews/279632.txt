This was exceptional! I made 3  small modifications, I used minced garlic instead.  I fried the chops in olive oil and butter heated and  when reducing the marinade I added 2 cups of  apple juice then I reduce to desired thickness.  My mom does not like chops and loved this recipe.

Pretty good - marinade keeps the chops moist during the low-heat cooking phase.  One caution:  Don't take the instruction "sear over high heat" too seriously.  At least on my range that resulted in instantly burned chops.  When I reduced the heat to medium plus one or two notches things went much better.

Neither my husband or myself finished. There is tangy and there is vinegary. This was not to our tastes.

Pork chops were very juicy, cooked thru, and the treatment was very delicious.

I didn’t use the red pepper flakes simply because I don’t like any hot. Other than that no changes. I loved it. Best pork chops ever. Found a new way to fix them.

I made several changes.  I used to like my food really hot, but now at my age, the mustard and crushed chilies seemed a bit much, so I reduced the mustard to 1 tblsp and the crushed chilies to 1/4 tsp.  I also substituted a cup of pinot grigio for the vinegar. I didn't have any chops, so I sliced a chunk of pork tenderloin into 1" medallions. I doubted that waiting for the meat to go through the rest stage would give enough time for the sauce to reduce, so I heated that in a small saucepan and still ended up adding some corn starch as the pork ended its resting stage. The taste was great. Nice sweet sauce with enough bite to enjoy, without burning my mouth.

The marinade after it was cooked was delicious! We grilled our pork chops then put  them in a  skillet last few minutes with sauce.

Very tasty, and will make again. Keeping the marinade and reducing it slightly really made for a nice sauce.

Little brown sugar & soya sauce added would have made it more like honey garlic..grainy mustard acts beautifully as the acidic component. No need to reduce too much.  1/2 tsp cornstarch mixed with 1/3 cup water would thicken nicely.

Really yummy and very easy to make, love the marinade and how great it is when you make it into a sauce to finish off the top of the cooked pork chops.   GREAT

I made it as listed, except used 1/4 chili flakes.  My family did not enjoy this.  The vinegar was definitely too strong.  Probably won't make again.

I did not care for this recipe - so much of a vinegar taste
