This review is based on how I made it, not the recipe as written. I used 1 tsp dried cilantro instead of coriander seed and upped the lemon juice to 2 Tbsp. I mixed all the seasonings into the oil prior to applying to slices. After baking, topped with diced fresh tomatoes that were mixed with a little basil and salt. Easy and yummy.

I did not have coriander seed so used a different herb mix,  but even so this was quite good. There were leftovers, and it got better every time I ate it! The lemon seemed to blend with the spice over time to deliver a really tasty flavor.

I really enjoyed this. I sweat the eggplant first to get rid of the bitterness and cut into rounds. This was my first time using coriander and I was surprised what a nice, faint flavor it adds. I made this according to the recipe first and thought it was great. Then I added tomatoes, feta and more lemon and basil for a nicer presentation. See my before and after photos. Next time I will cut thicker than 1/4 inch because it doesn't hold its shape very well when cut so thin. I will also peel the eggplant as I'm not a fan of the skin, but that's just preference. My eggplant stuck to the pan a little despite the olive oil coating so I would recommend spraying your pan lightly with cooking spray. Overall a tasty and easy recipe that I would make again.

i used this as a starting point for our vegetable side for dinner tonight and really loved the results.. i only used 1 T of oil (veggie), 2 T of lemon juice (bottled), and 1/4 t dried basil.. like mrs. kosmos i mixed everything together instead of the different steps in the directions.. i also added some  red wine vinegar (1 t), black pepper (1/8 t), and a pinch of cayenne.. i marinated the eggplant, after sweating it, for a couple of hours before broiling it.. the end result was great.. ty for the recipe

This was such simple seasoning, yet very good. However, I overdid it on the salt since it said "to taste" and I wasn't sure. Still good, though. My 5 and 3 year old enjoyed eating it with their steak.

OMG! I have a garden filled with eggplants. This is such a good recipe and realy easy to adjust for flavor alternatives also!  Great 4th of July party dip for veggies or chips too! Fantastic on grilled chicken or kabobs of any type! 5+++ stars!

I didn't have any coriander seed, so I used a bread dipping spice mix instead. I loved everything about this recipe -- it was quick and easy to make, good texture, good flavor, fast clean up.

This was different from our usual eggplant and tomato combinations.  I'm not sure I'd make it again, but it was nice to try something different.

Great recipe! So simple and delicious. The only change I made was to doublevthe broil time and to use cumin instead of corriander.

These were nice! I didn't have coriander seed, so I used dried parsley and ground coriander - you can really use whatever herbs and spices you have on hand. Next time, instead of cutting into length-wise slices, I'm going to cut them into thick rounds.
