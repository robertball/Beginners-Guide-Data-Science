This stuff  is addicting.I have some short cuts to share. I used 16oz.bag Dole Classic Cole Slaw. Toast the alomnds & sesame seeds in a saute pan (why heat the oven) Just put them both in the pan crank the heat to high and constantly stir.  Has soon as they start to brown turn the heat off and coninut stiring until golden brown. 3 min tops.  As for the dressing use rice wine vinegar and added 2T soy sauce. Since I used all 16oz. I needed a little more dressing. Instead of making more I used Good Seasons Asian Sesame with Ginger bottled dressing.

MMMMMMMM!!!!!!  I love this recipe!  Try toasting the Ramen noodles along with the almonds and sesame seeds.  Toasting makes them a little crunchier and they don't get soggy from the dressing.

I made this to take to a potluck and it really got soggy. I would suggest NOT adding the dressing and crunchy ingredients until RIGHT BEFORE serving. Leftovers are not very good because the noodles and nuts get mushy and the dressing soaks into the slaw making it look like sauerkraut. The salad is wonderful, three stars are because the recipe should warn about the sog factor.

Doubled the recipe for a crowd and it disappeared faster than any other dish on the table.  I used 2-16 oz. pkgs of shredded cabbage, 3 pkgs. of Oriental flavored Ramen noodles, added about 1/4 c. soy sauce to the dressing (and thus, omitted the salt entirely), and tripled the almonds.  I also substituted Splenda for the sugar since we are a family of diabetics.  Great recipe.  Next time I will try this as a summer main dish by adding some grilled chicken breast on top.  Thanks for sharing.

Such a versatile recipe.  I have made a version of this one for the past 15 years. I agree with a previous reviewer; use rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar.  If you are fortunate enough to have a Japanese market where you live, buy the Nissin Ramen (chicken flavor).  It comes in a yellow and red package and is already seasoned.  This ramen makes all the difference in the world.

I've been looking for an asian-type coleslaw, because my husband doesn't like mayonnaise...and boy, did this recipe please everyone! The first run was a little too sweet for us, so I now reduce the sugar to only 1 tablespoon. Also, for the oil, I use half sesame oil and half vegetable oil; this really picks up the flavor.

AWESOME!!!  We eat this all the time for picnics and at home.  My kids request it!! I use olive oil and red wine vinegar.  Brocollislaw is perfect for this recipe.  I also use sunflower seeds instead of almonds but both are great.  EVERYONE asks me for the recipe.  DOUBLE DRESSING.

Modify Recipe - Highly suggest 5 stars.  I made this for a family picnic and made the original recipe and a modified version based on other reviews.  The Modified disappeared - rave reviews with 4 requests for the recipe.  The original was o.k. 2 stars maybe - nothing special.  Per Reviews - I made one using the Oriental Ramen Noodles instead of Chicken and replaced the oil with Sesame Seed Oil and instead of White Wine Vinegar used Rice Vinger flavored with Roasted Garlic.  Added the dressing RIGHT before serving.  VERY VERY GOOD.  Thank you all for your feedback.

This is a great recipe but I like to make it the night before so the ramen noodles get soft and then right before serving, I add the sesame seeds and almonds.  Some people prefer the ramen crunchy and add it right before - it is just your preference. Definitely use rice wine vinegar instead.

This salad is wonderful! I've been looking for a salad recipe like this for a long time now. I love the crunchiness of the ramen noodles and the flavor of the dressing. Changes I made: I used a bag of prepared cole slaw mix to save time. I used double the dressing for an entire bag of the mix. I omitted the salt since the seasoning pack was salty enough, did not add green onion, and added sliced bits of chicken sausage. A delicious and light meal!

This was pretty good but you have to eat it all at once.  It does not keep or sit for long.

I have a similar recipe for this salad and everyone loves it. My dressing calls for the addition of 1 tbsp of soy sauce and using rice wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. For those of you found this recipe bland, those two changes make a big difference. I also toast my ramen noodles with the almonds and sesame seeds in just a smidge of butter in a frying pan and then I add the seasoning packet to that and not the dressing. Very yummy!

I, too, have been looking for this recipe for years! Absolutely yummy! Add a couple of teaspoons of sesame oil for more Asian flavor. The recipe fails to mention that the ramen noodles should be broken up into small pieces before mixing ingredients. Someone who has never prepared/eaten this slaw may not undererstand that step. Make this salad 3-4 hours ahead so the noodles have time to absorb some moisture and soften up. The addition of chicken or turkey would make this a whole meal salad. Delicioius! Picky kids and some men may find it "weird", but I could eat this once a week.

I have made this for years and we have always enjoyed it. I do lots and lots of variations with this recipe. Sometimes I use sesame oil for veg., interchange different flavors of ramen noodles, never use sesame seeds, always use sunflower seeds. I use bags of pre-shredded slaw or usually use the shredded broccoli slaw. One thing that is a must: you have to keep the dressing and veggies seperate until right before serving and then toss lightly. I take this to work a lot and always take ingredients in seperately or you will have a soggy mess. This does not keep well. This is a great way to get folks (like me) to eat broccoli :-)

I am a very picky eater myself and usually stick to bland, everyday foods. However this salad is delicious! It is a hit at BBQ's and other bring-a-dish-to-share parties. I love to add mandarine oranges (canned, drained) to this salad.

Very good and different.  I added sliced sugar snap peas for a little more freshness.  Next time would wait to add the noodles until right before serving - so they are crunchy.  All raves at our Fourth of July barbeque!

Great & easy recipe.  Totally different from traditional cole slaw.  My entire family loved it.  I waited til ready to serve to add the noddles, almonds and sesame seeds - so they would stay crunchy.

This is fantastic!  I made this for company and they loved it.  My husband loved it- and he can be fussy.  I used a bag of tri-colored cabbage, used olive oil instead of vegetable or sesame oil because it was all I had, and I doubled the amount of the dressing- except I only used one packet of ramen seasoning. It was excellent. I ate the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  I will make this for many years to come. Wonderful!
Note: This could easily be made with Splenda without altering the results.

This is just what I wanted!!!  Only changes I made was using 1 tablespoon of sesame oil in place of half the vegetable oil, it does make a huge difference in the whole flavor.  I didn't add salt, just the ramen seasoning packet, used balsamic vinegar instead of white wine vinegar, as that was the closest I had in my cupboard, which tasted great but it would have looked prettier using a white vinegar.  I did follow another reviewer suggestion and toasted almonds (raw, chopped because that was available), sesame seeds and the ramen noodles.  Also used fresh green and red cabbage.  Thanks again, soooo good!

I modify slighty and use Sunflower seeds vs the sesame. I use Napa Cabbage which is a little milder. This is a great variation for coleslaw as the Ramen, Sunflower Seeds and Almonds add a definate cruch.

Yum!  I love the crunch of the salad.  I'm a slaw snob and I usually don't like the typical mayo based ones.  I love this.  I used half the packet of seasoning and rice wine vinegar, and toasted the ramen noodles w/ the seeds and almonds.  LOVE IT!

This is simply the best slaw Ive ever had. Use half red cabage and half green, with carrots too, for a really fancy look. Is great with  BBQ chicken. I wonder how it would taste with a few raisins??? mmmm....

My version of this calls for chow mein noodles instead of Ramen.  I also shake a little seame oil in and sometimes use red cabbage for a fancier salad.

Really yummy - I used splenda, half the oil and twice the cabbage to make it more nutritious.  Still turned out great.

If you toast almonds and sesame seeds in sesame oil it's tastier. And also it's taste alot better if made the night before.

Intially, I did not think there would be enough "dressing" to cover the entire salad but it did and turned out great! Ofcourse, I used a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw and (although "fattier") I sauted the ramen noodles, seasame seeds and almonds over the stovetop in 1 TBLS butter oppossed to baking them. Very good and we will make this easy but delicious coleslaw again! Thanks Mary!

I've made this in years past, finally found the recipe again and can't wait to make it! This is the one potluck dish I brought to office functions and it was ALWAYS the most popular .. no one could believe a GUY made it! And by the way, DON'T use the seasoning packet that comes with the Ramen noodles .. even *I* knew that the first time I made it!

This stuff is the bomb.com.  I don't toast my almonds in the oven bc it takes too much time.  I just brown them with the ramen on the stove.  I also add about 1/4 t of sesame oil and sub 1 T of the vinegar with rice vinegar.  I also have made this without the onions.  I find that 5 makes it a little too oniony, so I only use 3.  Awesome :D

I LOVE this slaw and made a couple of changes.  I used rice wine vinegar instead of white.  I used 2 T of light olive oil and added about 3 drops of sesame oil (VERY strong stuff).  I left out the almonds and toasted the ramen noodles with the sesame seeds.  I agree with a previous review that stated the crunchy ingredients get soggy very quickly and should be added RIGHT before serving.

My family loved this.  I have been playing with different types of cabbage.  I have mixed savoy with traditional and it gave it a lighter fluffier texture.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I did change one thing, and that was that I used cider vinegar instead, seeing I didn't have the other.  I'm looking forward to sharing this recipe this summer, at the docks.

The first time I made this, I followed the recipe exactly.I  found it was very good. The next and subsequent times I made it, I used seasoned rice vinegar instead of wine vinegar and I used sesame oil instead of vegetable oil. It is fabulous that way! I give it 5 stars if use sesame oil and seasoned rice vinegar instead.

I thought this was very good.  Even my picky 7 year old who doesn't enjoy salads too much really liked it.  That feat alone gives this recipe 5 stars.  The only thing I did differently was to use apple cider vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.

I have been making this for years and it is my favorite coleslaw!  The things I do different is to add sunflower seeds to the mix and toast altogether with the broken up ramen noodles, and usually use the oriental flavor.  I would suggest to add everything together right before serving.

I make this sald all the time.  I add broccoli slaw to the mixture as well.  You can really use any type of seed.  I sometimes use sunflower seeds.  I also add soy sauce to the dressing.  I don't put the ramen noodles in the slaw, i put them on the side in a seperate bowl, just in case all the slaw does not get eaten.  This way, they don't get soggy!

Good easy recipe to feed a crowd.  I bring this salad to all the pot lucks.  I make almost double the dressing, with two packages of noodles, use the bagged, coleslaw, plus add a package of bean sprouts.  Just remember to serve as soon as you add the noodles and sauce, otherwise the noodles get mushy.

Love this salad, so easy and always a big hit.  I omit the salt and pepper and wait until serving time to add the noodles and the nuts, they are better crunch.

Like the dressing for this.  I also crunched up the ramen noodles and baked them with the almonds.  In the future would probably add shredded chicken to make a complete meal.

The dressing in this recipe needed something more; perhaps soy sauce.  I didn't think there was enough dressing either.

I love this salad!  It is so fresh tasting.  When I arrived to the potluck I brought the dressing, crunchy stuff and salad all in separate containers.  Mixed when I got there.  We ate about 30 minutes later and everything was perfect!  I did add chicken to my salad to make it more hearty.

Oh, yum!!  totally addictive.  I used oriental ramen, since that is what I had on hand, and it was delicious.  I also toasted my almonds and ramen in a little butter.  I would definitely save the noodles and almonds on the side and add right before serving to keep from getting soggy.  Total winner!  Everyone loves it.

I had this dish at a picnic and I've been looking for a similar recipe.  This one comes pretty close.  Instead of the sesame seeds, I used 1/3 cup of sunflower seeds.  Otherwise, I kept everything the same.  I mix the dressing up in a pint-size mason jar so that I can shake it up and pour it over the salad right before serving.  If you don't like cabbage, this would also be good with broccoli slaw.  You can find it in the grocery store near the bagged lettuce.

Upon tasting the first bite, I didn't know what to make out of this BUT somehow, I kept coming back to the bowl and eating and eating. Liked the crunchiness and the ease of preparation. Next time, however, I will make toast the crushed noodles in a little butter. I made another recipe similar to this one and that made the difference between the two. Used bagged cole slaw mix. Next time, I will also add more green onions, almonds and sesame seeds and try it with seseme oil. Make sure you do not put the dressing on top of the cole slaw mix until you are ready to serve -- it wilts very quickly.

I love creamy coleslaws, so I was a little worried as to whether or not I'd like this.  Since so many others had raved about this version, I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did.  It was different, but absolutely wonderful.  I will make it often and will serve it to company.  Thank you so much for this recipe.

I use broccoli slaw instead of cabbage, balsamic vinegar and omit the salt and pepper as the seasoning has salt.  I wasn't sure my husband would like this but he ate almost the whole batch!We will definitely make this again.

This recipe was fantastic! .. I had to give e-copies to all my guests  at my BBQ .. very easy and wonderful .. the only thing I did differntly  was use to use what is called  Chinese or California cabbage wich is a young sweeter cabbage, and I  added a little fresh sliced  fennel to it.. really great!  .. Also my oven is very hot and the seeds and nuts  were browned in 5 minutes .. keep an eye on it...

It is an awesome recipe. Seeing as how I can never leave well enough alone, I added fresh squeezed garlic and ginger, as well as Sesame oil and a little bit of soy sauce. It is a five-star recipe either way.

Love it. Only difference I do is I use sesame oil, then double the dressing and double the noodles, sesame and almonds. It's fine without being doubled..but we kinda like more dressing than most I guess. Good stuff I tell ya! Yum!

I actually have a very similar recipe to this that I make when my family gets together and for parties. Everyone raves about it. It's a bit simpler:

I use 1/2 a bag of broccoli slaw
1 package coleslaw
1 cup sunflower seeds (you can toast the sunflower seeds but you don't have to, still tastes delicious)
1 bunch of green onions
2 pkg of Mr. Noodles broken but not in too small of pieces(I use spicy chicken)

Dressing:
1 cup oil
½ cup sugar
1/3 cup apple cider vinegar
2 seasoning packs (from the noodles)
1 cup walnut pieces 

Combine the ingredients for the slaw, mix the dressing separately and put it on minutes before putting the slaw out for guests. Enjoy! :)

For the best results dress the cabbage the night before to wilt down a little.  Add the seeds and nuts just before serving.  If you anticipate any leftovers just let guests top their own portion with the noodles since they will get soggy if left in the dressing.  The noodles also do have better crunch and flavor if they are toased as well.

My mom makes something very similar.  Only difference is she puts in pine nuts instead of almonds and sesame.  But both are delish.  I hate sharing when I make it. I can eat the whole bowl by myself

This is a family favorite. I made a few changes. No salt, added dry roasted sunflower seeds instead of almonds (I didn't have any), added a handful of  cranraisins, thinly cut purple onion (I didnt have any green onion), and thinly sliced carrots for more color (precut bag) and pre cut slaw in a bag.  The noodles do get soggy if made to far in advance.  But we even liked it the follwing day.  The dressing is very light I added a little lite soy sauce.

Nice and light. I didn't have green onions, and substituted rice vinegar for white wine vinegar, and it was quite delicious. I had Oriental seasoned ramen instead of the chicken flavored one. My husband said, "This is the kind of thing I could eat every single day."

Mary, this salad is Great! I used a little sesame seed oil along with the vegetable oil, this gave it a wonderful aroma and taste. I did add chopped cilantro and sliced  onions. I took the others suggestion and toasted the noodles along with the almonds/sesame seeds.  Thanks Mary!! I will make this again and again.

Shred the cabbage in a food processor.  I did this about the same time I was making breakfast so shredded potatoes for hash browns = two jobs/one food processor cleaning. Rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, 1/2 the packet ramen seasoning, some diced yellow pepper for more color.  Toasted the almonds & crushed ramen in a pan - be careful not to brown. Economical, nutritious & tasty.

This is really good - I agree with others to go the route of a slaw mix (easier and more colorful).  The dressing seemed to be missing something - I tasted it as is and added a little ginger but still seemed to be lacking.

I totally love this recipe and could eat it by the bowlfuls. I use a large bag of prepared tricolor slaw mix and two packages of ramen. It doubles the recipe, but I triple the dressing with the exception of only using 2 of the flavor packets.  I use half olive oil and half sesame oil and rice wine vinegar.  I also add a couple tablespoons of soy sauce and some ground ginger. With the soy sauce and flavor packets, you can omit the salt. This goes great with an Asian meal, or for bbq's and potlucks. I've never had any leftovers.  Much lighter than mayo based slaw and has wonderful texture

This recipe is awesome. I added more almonds and less ramen, because I had to make a whole bunch and failed to get enough ramen to get the job done. It came out great, and subbing more toated/satueed almonds reduced the sogginess factor, in all likelyhood. Also, I added some lemon juice, because I didn't have quite enough rice vinegar, and it was a nice touch.  I made it for my boyfriend's big barbeque today, for all his friends and family. He's never done that before, and I really wanted to support him, but he wanted everything done his way. The store was out of pre-made cole slaw, which it what he wanted, so he asked me to pick some up elsewhere. I begged him to let me make it, and with no small amount of dramatic body language, he reluctantly agreed to resign control of the cole slaw to my care, stipulating only that he wanted vinegar-based, not mayo-based.  I found this recipe, and had many of the ingredients on hand, plus the reviews were great, so I went for it.. and it was a huge success. His mother has put in a standing request that I make this and bring it to all family dinner events (all the holidays, basically). The store-brand potato salad was hardly touched, but the cole slaw is all gone -- what wasn't eaten was requested for take-home. This was seriously out of the ballpark, and I had a great day based on this recipe rocking. Thanks for all the thoughtful reviews as well.

This one is GREAT!!!  Followed the advice of other reviewers and bought good quality Raman, (Japanese NISSIN brand is fantastic), and toasted it.  Other than that I followed everything the same.  Delicious salad, and I will make again.

Thanks soooo much for the tip of using sunflower kernels instead of sesame seeds. Love  the sesame seeds, but they are very expensive in my area. Seems price of ingredients becomes more important each day!

This was delicious!!  I served it with the California Thai Flank Steak from this site.  To preserve the leftovers, I kept the noodles & almonds separate & topped each serving with this mixture just prior to serving.

We love this!  I added a peeled, seeded and diced cucumber and chopped cilantro for extra volume and taste.  The only thing I would change is to double the dressing (still only using 1 of the chicken seasoning packs though), we wanted more dressing.  Mmm.  Thanks!

This is unbelievable. I love both ramen and coleslaw, so this dish just completely made it for me. Left out the sesame seeds since I couldn't find any at the local grocery store, and used Chinese Savoy cabbage for a bit of Asian flair. Star reviews all around, my family thanks you for introducing this to us!

Very good!!  I used a bag of broccoli slaw mix instead of cabbage, which made it very crunchy.  Instead of the almonds, I used toasted sunflower seeds with the sesame seeds.  Just a really fresh taste!

I made enough for a birthday party.  I multiplied it to use 3 cabbages, 30 green onions and 6 packages of ramen noodles.  It was a success!  Everyone raved.  I divided the white wine vinegar with rice vinegar and also added some soy sauce.  The sesame seeds were purchased already toasted.

I've made this several times with terrific reviews.  I use pre-packaged coleslaw, sunflower seeds in place of the sesame seeds, and rice wine vinegar in place of the white wine vinegar.  This is super-easy to throw together in the morning for an afternoon picnic.  I'm looking forward to trying the other variations that have been suggested.

If you're looking for a salad with CRUNCH, look no further. This salad is a refreshing variation of Cole Slaw and Chinese Chicken Salad--2 of my faves. I added diced hothouse cucumbers, instead of the onions. I used both vegetable & sesame oil and used rice wine vineagar. Do double the dressing and you may want to consider using a tbsp. less sugar.

The leftover salad is great heated up the next day. The soggy noodles seem "right" once the dish is hot. Just microwave a serving for about 45 seconds.

Great salad, thanks! I thought the dressing wasn't
enough so I made a little extra and added a few 
grated carrots for some color. I can't wait to
make it again!!

This salad is incredibly good!  Very easy to assemble.  I was unsure of using uncooked ramen noodle, but they are just perfect in this recipe.. Make it, you won't be sorry!  ( I also used rice wine vinegar)

This was different, easy and very good!  The only low mark I gave it was for kid-

I made this last minute for a party substituting the pre-shredded packaged coleslaw. I also used "Oriental" flavored noodles. I didn't have any sesame seeds so I followed another reviewers suggestion and used half veggie oil and half sesame oil. Worked great!

I don't add extra salt in recipes if there
is anything prepackaged or prepared in it.
The seasoning packet was plenty salty, adding
the extra salt called for would have been too 
much.  Without the extra salt, it was just
right!

A HUGE hit!  Doubled dressing as recommended....2 bags of cut cabbage....used apple cider vinegar.  I put all the dry ingredients in a container and the dressing separate.....tossed it all together right before serving. So easy and inexpensive!  Making it again tonight for another get together.  This will be my go to recipe to bring to big parties.

I've made this twice now, once as written and once with some modifications.  The first time I made a single batch and my husband and I thought there was too much dressing and that the dressing was too sweet. Thus the 4-star rating for the recipe. The second time I made this, I made a double batch to serve with burgers at a BBQ and made some modifications based on other reviewers' comments and it turned out great with several requests for the recipe.  My tweaks (for a double batch) were to use 2 16oz bags of coleslaw mix; used half rice wine vinegar and half white wine vinegar; reduced the sugar by 25%; used veg. oil for half the oil, the other half was equal parts sesame oil and hot asian chili oil; waited until shortly before serving to add the dressing.  With those tweaks, the double batch was fantastic and had the perfect amount of dressing!

I made the coleslaw with red cabbage.  The coleslaw was better after it soaked in all the flavor overnight.  When I tried to eat it about a half hour after making it the coleslaw had very little taste.  Unfortunately though I don't know what it tasted like with the sesame seeds because I bought some at the store but the store forgot to give them to me (happens to me often I find).

Fantastic. I served this at my Memorial Day BBQ and it was a hit. I added some shredded carrots(three)and mandarin oranges. I did not have any Romen so I substituted half a bullion chicken flavor cube and added some sesame flavored cracker toppings. Would make this again.

Maybe I have just outgrown this type of salad, it was just ok to me. After eating some and thinking it was boring I added cilantro, peanut butter and a bit of lime. It was much better. Thank you for sharing.

Wow!  Just what I was looking for!  Very easy to throw together and very, very tasty!  I made a few modifications based upon what I had on hand:  Used a "cup o' noodles" type ramen soup, the spices are already mixed in, so I jusst crushed everything together, added a small head of cabbage, about an eighth head of red cabbage, two grated carrots and 1/2 small chopped onion.  I doubled the dressing recipe accordingly, and used 1 Tbsp sesame oil with the oil called for (1T sesame+3 T canola oil.) Used rice vinegar and Splenda in place of the sugar.  Added a splash of soy sauce.  I didn't have almonds or peanuts, so I chopped up some cashews instead. 

I've already eaten two bowls and can't wait to make this again...so that maybe my family can try it!  Thanks for a great recipe!

This is a wonderful coleslaw recipe-- easy to make, good on a hot summer day when you are worried about spoiled mayonnaise.  I use rice wine vinegar instead, and add dried cranberries for color and a different texture.  Enjoy!

...This definitely tastes better than it looks.  I toasted the ramen noodles before adding and also added some shredded carrots for color...I absolutely loved the dressing and will double it next time..also will let the slaw and dressing set in the fridge overnight and add the toasted ramen and nuts before serving.  Nice change from my standard mayo based coleslaw and always need another recipe to use up ramen noodles...Thanks Mary!

This was a wonderful recipe, did some adaptations.  Yesterday family raved on this recipe which I doubled to accommodate the crowd.
1) Used purple cabbage for a brighter Fall color presentation

2) Subbed sugar for organic Stevia: each individual Stevia packet is equivalent to 2 tsp sugar --- a TBSP = 3 tsp, therefore that would be 3 packets if you're the making recipe as is, if doubling,6 packets or to taste.

3) Swapped half the oil out for sesame oil

4) Used half seasoned rice vinegar and half white wine vinegar since I didn't have enough of the rice vinegar

5) In addition to toasting the sesame seeds and sliced almonds, I opted to toast the crushed Ramen noodles too to avoid the sogginess others mentioned.  There's only a little of the coleslaw left this morning and the Ramen noodles are still mostly crunchy!

5) FOLLOWING SOMEONE THE OTHER REVIEWERS SUGGESTIONS, I did not assemble it until right before serving.  

REFLECTIONS *** I think if you roast the Ramen noodles, it would be safe and optimal to put it together about 30 -60 minutes before, to help the flavors marinate a bit, because I notice it's more flavorful this morning. 

Next time I will try it that way and post an update if it made a difference. If anyone else is brave enough to try this and post feel free ?  By the way, sorry no pic. As usual was rushing yesterday!   Will post what's left in a bit.

This is so good and easy! I toasted the sesame seeds, almonds and broken noodles all together and doubled the dressing but did not add second package of Ramon noodle flavoring. I doubled the sesame oil, rice vinegar and sugar and that was enough flavor. I put the green onions in with the dressing and mixed. I chopped up the cabbage instead of shredding, added shredded carrots for color and it was very good and did not get mushy, also looked better serving on plates. Served with pulled pork sandwiches on oven toasted buns! Great!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe to a T. It was delicious as is. Now I use Sesame Oil and Rice Vinegar and it's got an amazing oriental flavor. I always make these changes now. GREAT recipe.

This one scores a home run when you reach the point in the summer when you can't stand another mayo-laden side dish. My crew loved it. I'll be making this one again, for sure.

WOW! what an awesome recipe! I tried it last night, was a bit nervous as I like to cook from scratch, and the idea of using ramen noodles and (yikes) the seasoning packet, well.. I was not sure how that was going to turn out. But it was so refreshing, and my guests raved about it (I let them take the recipe printout). Thank you for sharing. This recipe is definitely a keeper. :0)

a personal favorite.. I sub toasted sesame oil for regular oil, and rice vinegar for white vinegar. I also add Sriracha for a kick, especially if there is a sweet meat in the menu. I don't use the noodles, because I can do without the added carbs, and add the seeds just before serving.

Thee best coleslaw I have ever had with one minor change.  I added a 1/2 cup light mayo in the dressing.

This is really good and quick.  I used rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar and used a whole cabbage and added more green onions. I used sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds.

I used 2 16oz. bags of prepared coleslaw, 3 chicken flavored ramen noodles, sunflower and sesame seeds.  For the dressing, I mixed 1/4 cup veggie oil, 1/4 cup soy sauce, 1/4 cup rice vinegar and 2 packets of the Ramen seasoning. So yummy!

Can't say enough about this slaw.  Divine!  I used red cabbage and it was fantastic.  I couldn't find the specified chicken flavoured ramen so I just bought steam fried chinese noodles (they were in a yellw and red package) and used a pack of chicken OXO for seasoning.  Used rice wine instead of white wine vinegar.  Used a small fry pan for toasting sesame...heat it first then add the seeds.  Make sure you keep an eye and turn after every 10-15 sec or they will burn.  I had mine at med heat.  I omitted the almonds only because my grocery bill that day was getting too high haha.  Served with/on top of a pulled pork sandwich...this will be something I make a lot from now on!

I really wanted to make this, but I didn't have all of the ingredients on hand - and it still came out great.  I was trying to duplicate a ramen coleslaw I used to eat at a German restaurant in Chicago.  This came darn close!  I used poppy seeds in place of the sesame seeds (since that's what the original had) and I didn't use the almonds or green onions.  I also used packaged coleslaw mix - it was so easy and so good.  It was even good the next day, although the ramen noodles were soft-not a problem for me.  Thanks for a great recipe - I really enjoyed it!  PS - I can see that this would also be good with an Asian flair as some reviewers suggested.  I'll try that another time, but today, I have to have it again as written!

This was so easy to make. I calculated the recipe ingredients to 12 servings and followed advice from a couple other reviews:

1) Used frying pan to toast the almonds (couldn't fine sesame seeds but I really liked the almond flavor!)
2) Used two packages of coleslaw mix instead of cabbage and green onions.
3) Used 1/4 low sodium soy sauce and omitted the salt.
4) I waited until right before serving to mix in the toasted nuts.

This was delicious and very easy and went really fast at our family BBQ!

This was okay.  My husband did not like this and he'll eat just about anything.  I just don't get the ramen noodle part of it.  I know it is supposed to be crunchy, but by the time I served it, it was mush.  My husband asked me what it was because he was afraid the coleslaw had worms. The flavor wasn't that great for me either.  Something I thought we'd be eating through out the week got thrown away before we ate anymore.  I gave it three stars because of the ease, even though it just wasn't my cup of tea flavor wise.  Others might find it more palatable.

This is a great change up from your usual slaw.  I didn't have any almonds, so I skipped them- didn't miss them!  Also if you use the whole seasoning packet, you do not need the 1/2 t. of salt.  Great for summer!  Thanks!

Sadly, my husband and I simply did not like this coleslaw and we're normally big slaw fans. The ramen spices were just way too much and the ramen noodles were annoying at best. Back to the drawing board for us, I guess. :(

So yummy! I also used rice wine, a bag of cole slaw, and browned the seeds, almonds, and Ramen over high on the stove. At dinner my husband looks and says "I'm not a fan of cole slaw", I told him it wasn't and had him try it; he had three servings.

Delicious!  I took the advice of the rice wine vinegar but otherwise kept it as it was.  I also used the Dole shredded cabbage.  I do that with coleslaw too because of the time saver it is.  The only thing I want to add is to the person giving a low rating because they weren't warned the noodles would get soft in the dressing...isn't that just plain ole' common sense.  That pretty much goes for anything crunchy that gets added to a liquid dressing.  If you don't prefer soggier noodles, bacon, etc., leave them out until right before serving.

I love this recipe - but I am allergic to MSG and nearly every ramen spice packet has MSG in it!  It's too bad but I leave out the packet and add a little chicken bouillon to the dressing mix.  Nothing is lost in the flavor at all...it's still wonderful.

Excellent, excellent coleslaw.  This is my absolute favorite coleslaw that I make for every large cookout.  An added bonus: no mayonnaise is in this recipe so you don’t need to fear the mayonnaise going bad.

Excellent slaw.  I couldn't stop eating it. I only had black sesame seeds and didn't bother toasting them.  By the way, 10 mins @ 350 is way too long and I burnt the first batch of almonds.  I know, my fault I should have kept a closer eye on them.  Anyway, thanks for a great recipe!!

This is a wonderful recipe that I have making for years!  I change it up by adding chopped/shredded leftover chicken (if it's chicken flavored ramen) or beef (if it's beef flavored).  I've yet to try shrimp but it might be the best yet!!  Thank you for adding this!

I have never had ramen noodles before. What a great way to be introduced to them.  I was looking for a different coleslaw recipe and decided to try this one.  I am so glad I did.  I too used the pre-shredded bag of slaw and also added 2 tablespoons of sesame oil along with 3 more tablespoons of white wine vinegar.  This coleslaw was fantastic!  I will definitely be making this again and again!

Even easier: I went with a bag of pre-chopped coleslaw mix. I didn't have sesame seeds and wasn't about the spend $10 on a bottle, so I used a capful of sesame oil in the dressing. I skipped toasting the almonds and just added them straight from the bag. This is definitely a recipe that is easy to customize or substitute ingredients in.

This is a great recipe, and its even better with some chicken added in. Another amazing add-in is mandarin oranges. Drain them first, but save a spoonful or two of juice for the dressing. TO DIE FOR! :)

Pretty tasty!  I used brocolli slaw instead of regular shredded cabbage (much prettier presentation).  I added the dressing immediately before serving.  When I make this again, I will probably put the dressing on about 20 minutes prior to serving.  It was a bit too crunchy with putting the dressing on right before.  Also, I substituted olive oil for the vegetable oil.

Mmm, tasty.  I just made this, and tried a bite before popping it in the fridge.  Love it! (and this is from someone who never met a coleslaw she liked).  Out of necessity, I did make a few minor substitutions... Used chives instead of green onions, and chopped pecans instead of almonds.  It's still delicious.  I think the key is the dressing and the toasted sesame seeds.  I will make this often.  Thanks for the great recipe!

This was good but needs a little something extra.  It's a little bland as-is.  I would definitely double the dressing as another reviewer suggested.  I don't think you need double the dressing but you definitley need a little more than the recipe makes.  Maybe a little ginger or soy sauce would make it better.

Excellent recipe. I used rice vinegar and sesame oil for a better flavor. I also added 1.5 tsp fresh grated ginger to the dressing, and increased the amount of dressing by 50%. Also, in order to save time, I purchased bagged coleslaw.    Will certainly make this recipe again!!

this is the best version of a ramen coleslaw i have ever made and had. one tip tho do not put the almonds, noodles, dressing or sesame seeds on until you are ready to eat the salad will get soggy especially those items if u put them on too early.

Easy flavorful recipe.  I made a few changes: I toasted the sesame seeds, almonds, and noodles together in a frying pan with about 3 T butter until golden brown.  I made the dressing with half seasoned rice vinegar and half blackberry vinegar.  I wanted it more tart so I added white balsamic vinegar until it was tart enough (about 1or 2 more tablespoons).  Then I tossed it with warm shredded chicken (about 1 1/2 breasts) and served with sour dough bread.  My 12 year old son loved it.

Great Recipe!  I only used 1/2 of the seasoning packet in the dressing and made sure to make the dressing up several hours ahead and let it chill. Also, I toasted 1/2 cup cashews in place of the almonds and toasted them together with the crushed ramen noodles in the oven for 10 minutes.  I also cooked 6 slices of bacon until crisp and added that to the slaw.  Toss all together about 10-15 minutes before serving and it was wonderful!!! Great side dish for BBQ and hamburgers.

I found this to be way too salty; I would omit the ramen seasoning packets, especially since they contain MSG.  I subbed rice vinegar for the white wine vingar, and toasted the noodles with the almonds and seeds.  Will try again without the seasoning packet.  Was OK, but mine did not turn out as addictive as others claim.  A little cilantro might be nice too.

Yummy.  I omit the almonds due to allergy, but followed the recipe otherwise.  Light and crunchy with a subtle vinegar bite.  We had this with pork barbeque sandwiches and hash brown potato casserole.  Great summer fare.

I made this for a family dinner and they ate it up in no time! Here are the changes I made: I used red wine vinegar and upped the oil to almost ¼ cup. Next time I make this I’ll scale back on the oil, but I can’t imagine 2 tablespoons being enough. I added a bit of sesame oil too. I only had Blue Diamond Smokehouse almonds so I just chopped about 1/3 cup of those up instead. Delicious!  I mixed the sesame seeds in when adding the dressing, but held off on adding the ramen and almonds until just prior to serving. They couldn’t get enough!

I had been searching tirelessly for this recipe after devoring it as an appetizer last Thanksgiving. The first batch I made was gone within 24 hours, so upon preparing this again, I made a few changes... I only used half of the ramen noodles and instead added some bean sprouts, which still provided a good crunch. I also threw in a little cilantro because I love it and was happy to find out that it complimented the flavors really well! Although this recipe calls for half of a head of cabbage, I used the 16 oz. bagged stuff and I actually enjoyed it more because it wasn't drowning in dressing. Also, as a side note, the first time I made this, I used the Oriental Ramen because that's all I had on hand, and while it was good, I used the Chicken flavor the second time around and it was much better!! (That could be why the recipe calls for it!! :) ) It's so nice to have a recipe that can be made so easily and that you don't feel guilty about eating!! Yummy!

So VERY yummy!!  I doubled the dressing since I used two 16oz. packages of angel hair coleslaw, but only used the original amount of sugar. I used some sesame oil too as well as seasoned rice vinegar. I also toasted the crushed ramen noodles with the sesame seeds and almonds. The family LOVED this one...thanks so much!

We've been making a variation of this recipe for a number of years.  We like using apple cider vinegar and balsamic.  We also use the Oriental Flavor ramen noodles.  We like this seasoning best.  If you add strips of roasted chicken, you have a complete meal.  When I make this I usually use 2 full heads of cabbage.  It never lasts long in our house.

I made this tonight.  I have made a similar recipe before.  I liked this one better.  What I did different:  I used a small regular onion, slivered almonds and only 3/4 of the seasoning packet.  I also omitted the salt.  I added about 1/2 tsp garlic powder and about 1/8 tsp five spice powder.  I took the recommendation from the reviews and used 1 Tbsp Sesame Oil and 1 Tbsp Olive Oil.  My only complaint - not enough dressing.  Next time I'll probably double the amount of dressing I make.

I made this for my son's 1st birthday and it was fantastic! I did cheat and used bagged cabbage instead of cutting up cabbage myself. It was a hit at the party! I would definitely make again.

I used sunflower seeds in place of the sesame seeds, and used beef ramen noodles in place of the chicken.  I added some cooked, chopped chicken breast and served this for a main course.  It was gone in a flash and everyone loved it.

The crunchiness in this salad was nice.  The seasoning was mild and I did alter it a little more to my liking.  I added some lime juice, more salt and 2 tbs.  Good Seosons "Asian Sesame with Ginger Dressing"

This was a huge hit at our neighborhood block party!  I make the dressing using cider vinegar and soy sauce and omit the flavor packet from the noodles and it was really good.  The bowl was empty by the end of the party!

My husband and I liked this better the second day when I combined it with some Asian marinated chopped chicken breats and made wraps.  It could use a little more of a kick to it but I liked the crunchy texture.

Love this, but have changed a few things:  I use rice wine vinegar (usually the flavored), add peapods, and peanuts.  I've had it with the almonds, the sunflower seeds, or the sesame seeds and will only use peanuts now - it's the best!

Simply awesome!  I made this for a party and maybe a 1/4 cup was left.  It got rave reviews.  Oh... I doubled the dressing amount - I just like it "wetter".

Great recipe!! I'm definitely making this one again. I followed the other comments and substituted sesame oil, rice vinegar, and broccoli slaw.  I also left out the seasoning packet from the ramen noodles.  I think next time, I'll try adding mandarin oranges.

My family has been making this slaw for years!! Our family recipe uses the Oriental flavor Ramen, Apple Cider Vinegar, and Pecans. Try it that way for a different flavor. We also add red cabbage to the green for more color. I make it every weekend!

Light and delicious.  It's the perfect party side dish that's easy to make and keeps well.  I think it's tastier when the veggies have been left to sit for a few hours to soak in the dressing.  Just leave out the ramen noodles until ready to serve.

I love this salad if I can get the dressing right. It is easy to make the raman noodle part in the oven. I have seen other recipes that make it difficult to do. Someone told me it was the best salad they had ever eaten. I use Napa cabbage instead of regular cabbage.

Delicious! I recommend refrigerating the salad for a couple hours before serving to let the flavors blend and to slightly soften the noodles. I use roasted sunflower seeds instead of the almonds.

If you use the pre-shredded coleslaw this is super easy to throw together.  I do like to use the red cabbage mix to give nice color.  I think that subsituting seasame oil for veg. oil is a must to give it a bit of a kick.  I recommend changing the ramen based on your main course, pork, chicken, seafood, etc.  If you use the creamy chicken ramen it does make the salad just slightly creamy to please everyone.

I thought this recipe was great.  It has just the right amount of kick and is a good alternative to the traditional coleslaw that is high in fat and calories.  I made the coleslaw without the almonds and it was still great and kept well in the fridge up to a day afterward.  Thanks for the recipe.

I have made this recipe several times for my family and for gatherings; always a hit!  To help keep the salad from getting soggy, I toast the ramen noodles along with the almonds and seeds.  It's really nice on a buffet or for potluck - but always wait till right before serving to add the noodles and nuts.

This was easy and so tasty! Since I served alongside fried fish I used shrimp ramen instead of chicken, and toasted the almonds, sesame seeds and noodles just before adding.  My husband loved it which makes it a keeper - thanks for sharing this!

I decided to sign up for a login at allrecipes.com just to review this recipe.  It is EXCELLENT!  I cannot keep enough of it in the house.  We have been making two batches a week for a few months now - since finding the recipe here.  I recommend tossing the salad just before serving for best taste and crunch.  Buy the cabbage with shredded carrots in it to add a dash of color.  Enjoy!

I used sunflower seeds instead of almonds and sesame seeds.  Everyone I made it for loved it!  Be sure to add the ramen noodles right before serving or they will get soggy.

This did not taste as well as I thought it would.  It was okay, but I doubt I would make it again.  Might be better without the pepper.

I did have to add a little bit more sugar to it because it seemed somewhat sour.  Maybe using rice vinegar would have solved the problem instead of white wine vinegar.

Terrific!  A good switch from conventional slaw-loved the sesame seeds and almonds which gave great flavor.

I've been looking for something like this for a while so this recipe was a good start.  I modified it in a couple of ways; I used broccoli slaw instead of the cabbage and sunflower seeds instead of the sesame seeds.  I also omitted the seasoning because I didn't like the chicken flavor.

You can add chicken to make this a one-dish meal.  I slice 1 whole boneless, skinless chicken into 1/2 inch strips and marinate it in terriaki for about an hour.  Then saute the chicken until cooked and refrigerate it.  Make the recipe for the coleslaw and add the chicken before serving.  People love it!

Easy to make. Husband says: "It's good." Subbed rice wine vinegar for the vinegar, didn't toast anything, decreased the sugar, and omitted the sesame seeds.

I like most anything Asian, but I didn't care for this much.  I found it to be too salty and too peppery.  I gave this two stars due to how quick and easy this was to make.  Perhaps next time I will try to modify the recipe and see if I get better results.

This was a little bland, so I added some ginger, a few drops each of soy sauce and sesame oil.  I made a mistake by using Ramen as it doesn't soften as fast as Cup Noodles.  I tossed in a little more water to help it along.  I added cooked chicken to make it a one dish meal.

I used 2TBS peanut oil and 1TBS sesame oil. I used 2 TBS white vinegar and 2TBS rice wine vinegar. I cut back on the white sugar and doubled the salt and pepper. I toasted the ramen noodles as well, they kept a great crunch! I also prepared the night before and added the almonds and noodles the next morning.

Horrible. Sour. I added much more sugar, even honey.  The flavor was non existent. I lost a previous recipe for oriental cole slaw that called for honey. It was delicious. This recipe was no where near the oriental crunchy cole slaw I use to make. Very disappointing.

If I make this again I would not use as much pepper as it was very strong and spicy.  I had to add sugar to the mix to counter act the spicyness.

I loved this recipe.  I mixed green and red cabbage to give it a little flair in color.  I ommitted the seasoning packet from the ramen noddles (need to watch the sodium) and instead added 2 tsp of lite soy to the dressing mix.  I like adding the ramen noodles at the very end to keep it crunchy.  My 16 year old son had three servings!  I also coarsely chopped some whole almonds and that worked fine too!

I had this at a recent party and the hostess got coy when I asked for the recipe.  Well here it is!  I did use rice wine vinegar and packaged cole slaw.  I did not add any salt to the dressing but I did add a few shakes of lite soy sauce.  This is so versatile,  I can see adding diced chicken or shrimp and other vegetables.  And if by some odd chance you have leftovers, it is even better the next day.

Followed suggestions using 1TBS Sesame oil, 1TBS Soy Sauce and Rice Wine Vinegar instead of white wine vinegar. Only 1TBS of sugar too. Toasted noodles with almonds.  Next time don't add sesame seeds til almost the end as they sit on the bottom of the pan and brown faster.  Okay overall, but needed more dressing.

I've been makeing a simular recipe for years but couldn't find the recipe!! LOVE ALLRECIPES!! Most of the changes I saw in reviews were changes I already use - ORIENTAL Ramen noodles - rice vinegar - sesame oil - BUT be sure to put some chicken in it - makes it a meal. I also use 1/4 cup roasted sunflower seeds along with the almonds and sesame seeds - great addition! Can use half broccoli slaw (bagged) with the (bagged) cole slaw for a little healthier meal. BE SURE to DOUBLE the dressing!

This is a GREAT recipe!!  You can add sliced fresh mushrooms, fresh bean sprouts, cooked chicken breast....I used agave nectar to cut the sugar out or rice wine vinegar is sweet so you don't need to use the sugar, too.  I have also used Farkay noodles and add them just before serving so they are crunchy.  Yummy!!

Great recipe! I think I added more cabbage, so I decided to double the sauce, using boullion cubes for the extra seasoning. It ended up being more salty than I wanted, so I added two cooked, cut up chicken breasts, which was one of the best ideas ever.

We are not a coleslaw family.  But this recipe was different enough to capture my interest.  The family loved it.  Will definitely add this into my menu rotation.

I absolutely LOVED this recipe.  I was leary of the amount of pepper suggested, but that extra little tang really lit up my taste buds.  As other reviewers suggested, I toasted the ramen noodles with the almods (didn't have any sesame seeds on hand) and I think that made the salad even better...if that's possible!  :-)

Yum yum. I thought this was super delicous. I followed the recipe about to a T, except for the fact I did toast almonds and sunflower seeds. I just put the sunflower seeds on the salad as in, and it was still delious. I definitely would recommend this.

Excellent flavor! I made it with the broccoli carrot slaw (no cabbage) because I had it on hand. I also did not have a ramen spice packet and the flavor was still delicious (you don't even need it)! One note of caution, however, the white wine vinegar is a strong one and gave me notable heartburn, so be prepared!

This recipe is delicious!! Nice and light! I made a few modifications. Added slivered carrots and iceberg lettuce to the mix. I omitted the salt since the package seasoning already has quite a bit and i doubled the amount of dressing.

This was very different from the usual coleslaw.  I was out of white wine vinegar and used rice wine vinegar instead.  I also added some soy sauce and cut down the amount of salt.  I felt it needed a little brightness, so I added about 1/4 tsp of grated lemon zest.  This really made it pop!  I doubled the amount of dressing and used a bag of coleslaw.  We'll see how our friends like it in a few hours at the bbq...

This lacked flavor and was even unpleasing to the eye.  Given how much everyone likes it, I can only assume I did something wrong, however, I followed the ingedients exactly.  Would never make again.

I love this recipe! I whipped it up one day for a BBQ, but didn't have any sesame seeds or almonds so I chopped up some honey roasted peanuts instead and it was delicious! Of course, wait until you're about to serve it to toss with the ramen and nuts! I typically use equal amounts of vinegar, oil, and sugar and add a teaspoon or so of peanut butter to the dressing. It thickens it up a bit and helps the dressing stick to the slaw.

This recipe is SUPER easy and very tasty.  I always skip the salt, since the ramen package has plenty already.  I also use seasoned rice vinegar since that is usually what I have on hand.  If you have any nut allergies, consider using sunflower seeds instead of the almonds.  Use purple and green cabbage, add canned mandarins, and anything else you like.  Ready in no time!

Excellent just as written.  I did, however, add rotisserie chicken to make it more of a main dish.  Also, I used bagged shredded coleslaw mix to make it faster.  Adding the ramen noodles at the last minute it also key.

I just made it and it's very yummy! After reading everyones reviews, I added a little sesame oil, toasted the ramen noodles and do wait to add them until you're about to serve, and (next time) I would make more dressing. Thank you Mary for sharing this recipe!

This was fantastic!  I made a few changes~ I used broccoli slaw, rice vinegar, and used sunflower seeds instead because that's what I had on hand.  All of my kids LOVED it even my son who typically HATES veggies!  I will definetly make this again!  It is a nice cold crunchy side to grilled meat in the hot summer weather!

This was so good!  I used bagged coleslaw, and doubled the dressing.  I also sauteed the almonds, sesame seeds, and ramen noodles until they were browned.  Instead of white wine vinegar I used rice vinegar.  Since only 2 of us were eating it, I halfed everything and made it 2 different nights.  My husband loved it!!!

I took this to a family reunion and out of about 5 similar salads brought by others, mine was the only one that people really ate. I got lots of compliments and several asked for the recipe. It was really good. I didn't have sesame seeds but other than that, I followed the recipe exactly.

This is such a fantastic recipe.  My husband and I LOVE it with shredded chicken.  Its easiest to do by shredding up a rotisserie chicken and tossing it in.  You get a great lunch out of it.

I have made this twice....LOVE the recipe! Was out of white wine vinegar so I mixed rice vinegar and apple cider vinegar and it came out awesome! Tastes much better if you cut up the cabbage yourself. I would recommend not buying the pre-shredded cabbage.

Mmmm. Very yummy, needs something added though. More veggies or something. Added the soy sauce and even the seasame oil which both were great additions. I'll definately make again!

I used Apple Cider Vinegar - it gives it a nice bite to the dressing. This is a great recipe for home or a potluck.

This is great!  I use sesame oil instead of vegetable oil and for an asian touch.  I also like the bagged broccoli slaw.  Eat it quickly-once the ramen noodles get soggy it loses the crunch.

This is really, really good, I've been making it for years.  I add a little finely diced red onion for color and flavor.  I mix the dressing into the salad a while before serving to let it marinate the cabbage, but then I add the Top Ramen noodles only right before serving so they don't get mushy and they hold their crunch.

Great! Make sure you add the dressing, almonds, and sesame seeds right before you serve. Otherwise it will get soggy.

this is a great recipe.  My kids loved it!  I doubled the ramen noodles since the crunch is their favorite part.  Great way to get a different vegetable into them.  Next time I might add some shredded carrots.

I have been making this for years; it's always a crowd-pleaser. I have a few honorable mentions. I don't notice a huge difference between white, wine, or rice vinegar; I just use whatever I have on hand. Our local grocer sells 16-ounce bags of coleslaw (cabbage and carrots) for 88 cents. For 16-ounces of veggies, DOUBLE the "sauce" (including ramen noodles). I've seen a few mentions of adding soy sauce. I personally think the sauce is amazing as-is and that the soy sauce really detracts from that! Fast, delicious, and fresh-tasting. Yum!

Needed a little more flavor for me. However, my kids loved it and they're 1 and 3. I added some sweet chili sauce to mine and it was better! I also want to find a way to season it without the ramen seasoning because of the MSG in it. Still a great coleslaw. Love the crunch.

I used 1 pkg of angel hair coleslaw mix and grated 1 carrot into it.  Followed the rest of the recipe as written.  I think it tastes best right after you make it.  I made it about 6 hours before eating and the flavor was so bland and lost it's character.  Be warned, only dress this right before eating.

This is the most requested summer recipe I make for family functions.  A shortcut; buy a bag of toasted seasoned sliced almonds.  I don't toast the sesame seeds and can't tell the difference.  Most of my family watches their salt, so I leave out the ramen noodle seasoning packets and add a smidge of regular salt.  Add the dressing with sesame seeds 1 hour before serving and the ramen noodles right before serving.  Always a hit with everyone, even kids like it.

I used splenda rather than sugar and I added a few dashes of soy sauce, thus omitting the salt.  After reading the reviews I expected something fabulous, but this just was blah.  The dressing lacked something.

Great recipe!  I did crush the Ramen noodles and toast them also with the almonds and sesame seeds and it was great.  I made this for Memorial Day and my mom and I wanted to eat the bowl ourselves! Yum.  Next time I will double this.

this was OUTSTANDING!!  i've been wanting a good slaw recipe for a while...this is a keeper.  everyone in my family enjoyed.  i cut back on the green onion so it wouldn't be overpowering for the kids, and i used olive oil instead of veggie oil.  also used red wine vinegar b/c i couldn't find any white wine vinegar at the supermarket.  also, used about a tablespoon of the hidden valley ranch slaw mix in the bottle because i had it on hand and don't want it to go to waste.  finally, used the sliced, honey-roasted almonds for salads instead of the plain sliced almonds. if you use these, they won't need to be roasted w/the sesame seeds.  GOOD EATS!!

Delicious!  I used to make a similar salad, but haven't made it in years because it contained too much oil.  This is much lower in oil, but still very flavorful.  I substituted Splenda for the sugar.  Can't wait to make it again!

Easy, I used cole slaw mix, but I don't know about nutrition. Definitely tasty, and worth the 10-15 minutes it takes to throw together.

I have made this recipe for years and you can substitute sunflower seeds for the sesame seeds and you don't have to taste the almonds. It is equally good and makes it a much faster recipe to prepare.

Nice change from traditional mayo based coleslaw recipes. I didn't have almonds or sesame seeds so I substituted sunflower seeds. I also used apple cider vinegar because that was all I had. Turned out great.

This was delicious! A nice change from the standard coleslaw, and quick to make. I highly recommend this. Didn't change anything in the recipe.  I was surprised that I even enjoyed the leftovers 2 days later.

This recipe is a wonderful change from the ordinary.  I add fresh ramen noodles to the leftovers the next day and they make it crunchy again.  I find the leftovers are only good for a couple of days.

Yummmy!!  I love this stuff.  It's no good as leftovers so if you don't think it will all get used up, make only half a batch.  Also, could cut back on the oil and still be fine, I think.

I had extra cabbage and didn't want to waste it.  I also had all the other ingredients.  I was skeptical, but the the reviews were great.  YUM!!!  I loved it.  A nice change from a boring old side salad.

I made this almost exactly according to the recipe, but found it not to my taste.  The textures and flavours just didn't mix, and it was rather soggy toward the end.  I like the concept, so I'll likely try it again with variations others have recommended.

I love this salad! I make it all the time, but I use beef flavored ramen noodles and also toast the noodles, It tastes best eaten right away but I also like the salad the next day, even though the noodles are soggy.

I liked this a lot. I probably would have liked it even more had I let it sit for an hour in the fridge. I will definitely make this again and add some chicken like some had previously suggested.

I make this every year for my departmental picnic and every year it is a hit.  To add a little flavor I add canned chicken meat and for color use the tricolored precut coleslaw mix, you'll find it in the produce section.

I didn't care for this dish at all.  I think it is the Ramen noodles.  Without them, it might be OK, maybe with shredded chicken (no promises)??? I was very disappointed, especially since I've had a similar salad before at an office potluck and LOVED it. I won't ever make this again.  Sorry!

This is excellent!  I made it for my family's annual July Birthday Bash, and it won raves! I like to change things up a little, so I used a small bag of pre-shredded coleslaw, a small bag of pre-shredded red cabbage, and a bag of broccoli slaw.  I also added a splash of balsamic vinegar to the dressing (I doubled the dressing recipe, too, using one package of chicken ramen and one package of oriental ramen noodles).  This was super!!

Loved this recipe! Very good and very easy! Used suggestions from others for rice wine vinegar, sesame oil and sunflower seeds. Since I could not find oriental version I think this helped spice up the chicken that I used. Very good!

WOW! I am in love with this. I was weary of the vingear, so didnt put as much in. But next time, I think I'll follow that as well. The dressing tastes great, and with red cabbage (all I had) looks amazing. Thank you for sharing!

This is the best.  Too bad you can't store the left overs (gets too mushy).  This is a great alternative to the mayonaise type.

This was a great coleslaw slad. I use a bag of cabbage. I also tosted the almonds in a frying pan. Everyone loved it!

So delicious! Only thing I did different was use 1 tbsp. vegetable oil and 1 tbsp. sesame oil for a little more Asian flare. I also used a 16 oz. bag of pre-chopped cole slaw, which is the perfect amount and saves time. Served this at a BBQ and it was the absolute hit! Thanks for the recipe!

Good. But too much pepper for my taste, it tended to drown out the other flavors. I used pecans instead of almonds and no sesame seeds.

I make this salad with broccoli slaw, broccoli florets and a can of sliced black olives.  I also use a package of Mann's broccoli slaw instead of cabbage and red wine vinegar instead of white wine vinegar.  I got the recipe out of Taste of Home and every time I make it I'm asked for the recipe.  My husband and I love it too!

I have been making this recipe for quite some time.  I always get requests for it.  I love it!! I use the bagged slaw mix (only contains cabbage).  This is really a time saver for me.  Plan on making it again for Sunday Christmas dinner at church, as well as my family dinner on Christmas day.

I am finally posting my review after making this salad for three years.  It has become a staple at family parties, and I get requests to bring "the coleslaw that everyone loves".  My only change - I toast the ramen noodles when I toast the seseame seeds and almonds.  I also used the packages coleslaw cabbage.

This was wonderful!!  I made for a get-together.  Used sunflower seeds rather than sesame seeds..yum!  I doubled the dressing but will not do this again.  Followed everyone's advice and added 'crunchies' at the last minute!!  FABULOUS!!

I used a bag of preshredded coleslaw mix (with red cabbage and carrots). This is similar to a salad my aunt makes but her recipe includes grilled chicken strips. I liked that I usually have everything in this recipe on hand. It was easy to put together.
My family and our guests enjoyed this very much. Thanks!

I thought this was a nice alternative to the usual creamy coleslaw, but it didn't blow my socks off.  I used sesame oil and rice wine vinegar as others had suggested.  And I also toasted the ramen noodles along with the almonds and sesame seeds.  Make sure you throw the crunchy stuff in right before serving so that it does not become soggy.

Delicious!  Next time I won't use the ramen season packet- I think the dressing can stand on its own without it and we didn't like the taste.  Otherwise this was delicious and a fresh take on coleslaw!

Definately double this recipe. Always a hit when taking to a pot luck or fixing for the family. Always best served shortly after tossing - NOT so good next day, as the Ramen Noddles go soggy

I have a very similar recipe, and this is delicious.  I don't use the seasoning packet and use sunflower seeds in addition to the almonds and sesame seeds.  I also add about 1 t. of sesame oil to the dressing, if I have it.  You can keep the crunchies and dressing separate and then toss together as much as you want with the cabbage when you need it.  The crunchies keep for a few weeks, as does the dressing.

I started out skeptical, but I was very impressed!  This salad is yummy day of or day after it's made.  I made a few substitutions for items I had on hand (red wine vinegar for the white and napa instead of regular cabbage).  I did feel that the almonds and sesame seeds were a little browner than I'd like; next time I'll watch them more closely.  I served this with a grilled chicken breast on top for a healthy salad/meal.  Thanks, Mary, for this great recipe!

I prefer the beef flavored ramen noodle packet.  We like the taste of the dressing more.  Also, contrary to some other reviewers, I think this slaw is best when the dressing is tossed right before serving.  If it sits too long, it sogs out.  The beauty of this salad is the crunchiness.

This is so good! I made it for small get-together but almost didn't take it - I wanted to eat it all myself. I cut the sugar down, and I used red wine vinegar (all I have). I also skipped the soup powder, and put half the noodles in when I made the salad and half right before serving. This is great! Thanks!

What a great potluck salad.  I had this at a church salad supper once and have been looking for the recipe since.  I have found it and will make this again.  Great with chicken added too.

My kids did not care for it.  I would try again using broccoli-slaw, but my supermarket didn't carry it this week.  I think the noodles taste better if they sit overnight--more flavor and less crunch.  I rated it high on taste and verrry easy to make, however.

This is a wonderful potluck recipe.  I often make it the evening before so the flavors have a chance to develop.

I tried 2 different versions of this before I found this recipe, and loved them both.  Then, when I made this one, I was in heaven!  My hubby, who hates raw cabbage, couldn't eat it, but both my grandmother and sister, who adore regular coleslaw as much as I do, asked for the recipe!  I even made a version without seeds or nuts for my grandmother who doesn't like either, and it's just as good.

This is now our favorite slaw salad!  Took it to a summer barbeque last weekend and everyone wanted the recipe.  We like our salads with a little "zing" to the dressing and I found by adding just a bit of balsamic vinegar, it was perfect.  Thanks to Mary.

This is an excellent recipe.  I often use a bag of the pre-shredded brocolli slaw instead of cabbage.  It's delicious and addictive!

I loved this dish as a kid and have been searching for the recipe for a while.  I omitted the sesame seeds because I didn't have any on hand and substituted rice vinegar for white wine vinegar.  It turned out great!

This brings back memories of my dad he had a similar recipe and made this often when I was little. When I came across this recipe I just had to try it. Delicious! The only thing I did differently was toast the almonds and sesame seed on the stovetop in a pan. Didn’t feel like turning the oven on.

This is so tangy and refreshing and such a great side dish. In a pinch one day, I used roasted salted sunflower kernels in place of the almonds and sesame seeds, and threw in a handful of dried cranberries. Now I do it that was all the time!

It was very good!  Ended up making this for my cousin's graduation party, everyone really liked it.  Had a hard time finding Sesame seeds in bulk ( I tripled the recipe)  so I just left them out.  Helpful Hint- leave the ramen noodles/almonds out until you are ready to serve.  I used Ziploc bags and took them with me.

I’ve been making this since 1995, when a coworker gave me the recipe. It calls for sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds. I often add cashews if no almonds on hand. Keeping the ramen noodles in a separate bowl helps eating leftovers, if any, without soggy noodles!

Delicious salad everyone can love.  It works well using rice vinegar substituted for the white wine vinegar.  Sesame oil substituted for part of the vegetable oil is a nice addition, too.

My only change is substituting sunflower seeds for sesame seeds. A reminder not to add the crunchies and dressing until right before you serve this salad or it loses its crunch.

My husband needed a dish to take to a potluck and I was happy to find this recipe.  I used a bag of store brand coleslaw mix .  I also used red wine vinegar because that was all that I had on hand.  I followed the suggestion of using Splenda for my diabetic hubby. (I haven't cooked with Splenda and thought it might be gross, but I was pleasantly surprised.)  I skipped the salt because I know how salty ramen is, and I didn't miss it.  I also found that 5 minutes in the oven was plenty of time for my almonds and sesame seeds to brown.  After reading the reviews, I was concerned that making it ahead would result in a slimy mess.  So, I made one batch for home and one for him to take.  I left the dressing off of his batch so that it could be added just before serving.  On our batch, I added the dressing immediately.  I ate a serving right after and thought it was very good, but after it sat in the fridge for 5-6 hours, I had another serving  and I thought it was even better. Things had softened up, but it was definitely not slimy.  I think having time for all of the flavors to meld together was of benefit . The salad was more flavorful and the texture  was just fine. It wasn't dripping with dressing and it wasn't offensively soft.  I am addicted.

I served this at a family barbecue and  everyone loved it -- even asked for recipe. I took advice of another reviewer and cooked the noodles in a dry pan to keep them as crispy as possible. I put a little dressing on and chilled it, then added the rest upon serving. Definitely will make it again.

Like so many other reviewers, I made some substitutions/additions:
-    Oriental flavor ramen instead of chicken ramen
-    Rice wine vinegar instead of white vinegar
-    Added just under a teaspoon of toasted sesame oil
-    Added julienned carrots and cilantro.  
I also adjusted the sugar to half the amount the recipe called for (I found the dressing far too sweet otherwise).  I've also seen this recipe made with napa cabbage, but it's not always available at my grocery store, so I use a combination of red and green cabbage sliced really thin and it was fine.  This is a tasty salad.  I highly recommend it.  I keep the toasted almonds and ramen in a zip lock bag in the fridge and add it to the slaw right before eating.  I agree with another reviewer - this is pretty addictive.

Flavour was okay, but the Raman noodles were a little strange. A very Asian flavour to it, if that's what you are going for.

Excellent recipe. I used sriracha flavored ramen and substituted white vinegar for apple cider vinegar. Came out great.

May try it again with a few changes that others have listed here.  Mixed reviews in our family---several really liked it...but several did not.  It's healthy, so that might encourage me to try it again.

I cheated making this recipe.  I used a salad express Cole slaw mix from the store.  I didn't need to chop cabbage this way.  I tossed out the dressing packet that came in the mix.  I made the dressing as directed per recipe.  I added chopped Granny Smith apple for tartness, and it made the salad sweet rather than tart.  Served it next to London broil, and it made the meal.  I was afraid to make it, I have an aversion to mayonnaise based foods.

It's a great salad.  I subbed the vegetable oil for sesame oil and it really took it to the next level.  I also didn't have any white wine vinegar or rice vinegar on hand so I used red wine vinegar.  I will be making this again soon.

excellent! I toasted almonds and seeds in a pan as suggested and threw the noodles in at the end.  I mixed it up just before serving it was great.  I did put just a bit of toasted sesame oil in the dressing as well.

One of my fave salads.  I omit the sugar.  The seasoning packet provides enough flavour.   I toast the seeds in a sauté pan but watch it carefully as they burn easily

Really good.  I didn't do the ramen part, but added mandarin oranges and used sesame oil and rice vinegar to give it more of an Asian flavor.  Added some grated carrot and red onion too.

Very tasty. I followed the recipe exactly excited except I toasted the Ramen noodles for about 10 minutes at 350 F before adding them. I think the untrusted ones have no flavor. I made this for a family gathering and it was a big hit.

I always follow directions the first time. So I did this exactly according to the recipe, including toasting the seeds in the oven (I normally do them in a pan on the stove). I really liked the almonds/seeds toasted this way, and I love this recipe. Took it to a picnic -- everyone was thrilled that it doesn't have mayo.

Made some changes for a really big head of napa cabbage. Doubled the dressing ingredients, but replaced 1 tablespoon of the doubled amount of oil with sesame oil. Skipped the salt and pepper. Used olive oil, also, instead of vegetable. 
 Toasted the seeds, almonds, and crushed noodles in a saute pan. Halved the sugar and added a handful of dried cranberries for sweetness and texture. Don't mix the salad dressing or toasted ingredients with the fresh ingredients until just before serving to maintain the textures. It was a hit!

Loved this recipe! I did use sesame oil and rice wine vinegar instead. I also toasted the almonds and sesame seeds together. I doubled the dressing let it sit in the fridge overnight and used a 16 oz of ready made slaw mix. Pulled it together a couple hours before the bbq and it was so good.

Delicious, tasty, simple--this Asian-influenced cole slaw was a great accompaniment to ribs, tonight.  I made this 5/30/16, and I admit, I tweaked only 2 things.  To give it more of an Asian flair, I used sesame oil and rice vinegar.  I love the crunch of the almonds, but 10 minutes at 350 is a bit too long.  My almonds were browned at 6 minutes.  I'm glad I was watching.  Overall this is a solid recipe, and I will likely make again.  Thanks for the idea!

Very light and fresh...pairs nicely with grilled meats or anything that's a little heacy.  I love that it is more food safe to leave out for parties as it contains no mayo.

I skip the almonds due to nut allergies.  Even without them, it is a family favorite.

This is one of my favorite standbys for BBQ's.  I don't like vinegar so I use fresh lemon juice instead (def seems to make a difference to use fresh instead of the bottle for this recipe). I also skip the salt because the ramen seasoning packet is already very salty.  Usually skip the sugar or just add a little bit - definitely doesn't need it at all.  I also add thinly sliced peppers for some color and crunch.  I've made it with the chicken ramen but also with the oriental to make it vegetarian- they are different but both are very good. Echo what others have said- wouldn't mix together ahead or it will get soggy.  Often keep some of the toasted nuts and seeds out to add to leftovers to add some crunch back in.   Didn't mean to upload photo 3 times- didn't think it was working but don't know how to take it down so enjoy it x3 :)

Followed recipe exactly, next time I think I will use half the amount of pepper and add an extra tablespoon of sugar. I love the ramen noodles in this though. Great crunch!

Very tasty and refreshing...perfect for summer.  I did double the liquid ingredients for the dressing, and used 1/2 sesame oil, 1/2 veg. oil and rice vinegar for great flavor!  Used oriental ramem and added no salt.  Used 3 green onions.  Could eliminate the sesame seeds, and added additional almond slivers.  It disappeared!

I love this recipe!! Try mixing it up with packaged coleslaw and broccoli-slaw together! It is great!! I use sunflower seeds instead of sesame seeds,(sesame seeds are awful if you wear dentures)and when in a hurry, I do not toast the almonds, although it is tastier when they are toasted.

I think this recipe is perfect for summer gatherings!  I have passed it on to friends/family and will keep using it.  The only change I made was I bought the pre-shredded cabbage.  That's it.  I do have a few ideas that I might want to incorporate in the recipe, but I love it the way it is.

Loved that I had most of this in my cabinet already. I substituted rice vinegar for the white wine vinegar and sesame oil for the vegetable oil and sesame seeds (out of necessity) and it turned out great.

Prepared as directed, only difference is I used bag of coleslaw.  The dressing was good; needed to perhaps add more of it as the ratio of cabbage vs. dressing was off.  It's a keeper!

Every time I make this cole slaw (my daughter-in-law's favorite) I'm asked for the recipe.  I'd suggest making it 4 - 6 hrs. in advance if you'd like your noodles a bit crunchy, more time if you'd like them softer. Suit to your taste and I guarantee, you'll love it!  It's very forgiving.

I doubled the sauce recipe and used a bag of coleslaw mix from Sam's Club. I also compromised as I didn't have any white wine vinegar, so i used rice wine vinegar plus 2 T of red wine vinegar. I didn't have any sesame seeds or almonds, so I used 1T sesame oil. Fantastic!!!!

Hubby and I both liked this.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and used some sesame oil, rice vinegar, added 2 T. soy sauce (omitted salt) and sautéed the ramen noodles with the almonds and sesame seeds.  I ended up using 10-12 oz of pre-packaged coleslaw mix and I felt that was the perfect amount with the dressing.

Not bad, but nothing great.  Kills my jaw from all the chewing. :0
I did change it just a bit- I added 3 Tbs. sugar, 1/4 c. veg oil, 4 Tbs. rice vinegar, 2 pkgs of ramen & 1/2 c. toasted almonds.
I originally gave this 3 star when the ramen was crunchy- not a fan.  But once it set in the fridge for a day..... yummy and a hit!

Followed instructions exactly and it was so good! Simple but very flavorful dressing. I think it would be delicious to add crispy bacon too. Trying that next time.

I've been using this type of recipe for years, but I've never used the sesame seeds. There was more (olive)oil than (red wine) vinegar and I usually added apples. Ramen noodles were added just before serving, although I've always liked them soggy the next day. I like it best with the Oriental Ramen.

Really tasty, but Did make a few changes.  To make it a bit healthier, I used grape seed oil instead of vegetable oil, substituted Splenda for the sugar, used white wine vinegar, and doubled all the dressing ingredients.  I also added some sunflower seeds since I didn't have sesame seeds on hand.  Everyone loved it.  Even DH, who usually only consumes foods that are good for his body if he is tricked.

This will be going in regular rotation for lunch! I made the following substitutions based on other's reviews:
used half sesame oil,
used rice vinegar,
added some shredded chicken,
asian flavored ramen noodles.

the whole thing came together so quickly, It was a 10-15 minute process. So good!

I used honey, red wine vinegar, and olive oil instead of the sugar, white vinegar and veg. oil. I go along with others in that you need to add the dried fruit, seeds, nuts, Ramen right before serving. I liked the dressing on earlier to flavor the cabbage though.

I've used this dozens of times. You can change up the ingredients and keep the ratios and its always awesome. The home made dressing using the soup mix is a great idea. I've used different mixes and it changes the dressing flavor each time. Red cabbage and olive oil add colour and depth of flavor as substitutes. Great stuff!

This salad is quick, easy,and tasty.  I do change it up a bit either by adding shredded carrots or using a bagged slaw that includes carrots.   We like to add a few drops of sesame oil to the dressing.  Really good if you pour the dressing over cubed cooked chicken or turkey and let it soak a bit before adding it all {dressing and chicken} to the salad.  Toss in a few raisins,sunflower seeds . . .  Have some fun with it!

Absolutely delicious!!  I also roasted the ramen along with the sesame seeds.  It's such a yummy way to eat cabbage, especially since I don't enjoy soggy coleslaws as much.  Yay!

GREAT SALAD!  I broiled the sesame seeds and almonds at different times or else the sesame seeds will burn.  I would added an extra packet of ramen noodles for extra crunch!  Delicious!!!

This stuff is addictive, don't dress to heavily and the noodles wont get soggy, also I did not have any almonds but it was nutty enough with the toasted sesame seeds, thanks for a nice light recipe.

This recipe is great as-is and couldn't be easier. I alter it slightly to suit my taste - Definitely use pre-packaged coleslaw mix, cut the sugar in half and add 2T soy sauce for a more savory flavor. Toast the almonds, sesame seeds, and noodles but reserve the almonds until you are ready to serve. This will keep them nice and crunchy!! Great recipe - always a crowd-pleaser.

This is exactly what I was looking for--thank you!  I added cooked, cubed chicken breast and left out the sesame seeds.  I also used half green and half red cabbage (just to make it pretty).  Very good flavor.

this dish was pretty good even without the nuts would try some fruit with it next time. used the sesame oil and not a whole packet of spice seasoning as suggested by some other reviewers. I liked it the next day too the ramen noodles were not crispy of course but they were just like they are when you cook them. and the flavor of the dressing is better.

This a very simple, nice twist on coleslaw. My family usually does not like it much. But when I saw this, I thought it might work. Everyone enjoyed it. I do believe it needs a bit more seasoning. Perfect to make and take to an outdoor summer gathering.

Easy & yummy way to get in those extra servings of veggies. I added carrots. Next time, I'll probably try it with the new spicy ramen or add some rooster sauce.

Wonderful recipe;  my family loved it because it wasn't sweet.  The toasted nuts and sesame seed really contribute to the overall tastiness.
