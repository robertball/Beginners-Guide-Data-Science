Eight minutes ended up being  a little too long on my steak but other than that this recipe was great! I'm typically not big on ginger dressing but I absolutely loved this one and it was the best I've ever had.

The dressing was too strong and overpowered the steak. I might make a version of this but not with that dressing.

Will definitely make it again. We grilled fresh mushrooms instead of bell pepper. Also added boiled, cooled nugget potatoes to the greens before tossing. Nice Asian flavour but meat-and-potatoes enough for my guys.

Delicious!  I also grilled a zucchini and then sliced it on the salad.  Didn't have any green onions, so I grilled a white onion in a basket on the grill.  Very good!

Followed instructions to the letter. However it did not turn out as described, and found it less exciting than expected. I don't believe it is the recipe that needs work, but my somewhat "burned-out" taste buds. I'm very old and it takes a lot of work to get the taste buds excited.  I'll work with the recipe to make it a 5 star rating.
