Sweetness is a relative thing, so you can cut the agave down by half or more if your general penchant is for lightly sweet, and leave it "as is" if you generally like sweet drinks. This was created for a drinker who doesn't like the dryness of champagne, and relative to using something like cassis in similar proportion is the same, save the agave is lower glycemic, so it tastes a good deal sweeter to the tongue than the actual sugars it has in it.

I'm not a champagne drinker at all, but I'm hooked on this one.  I used a cheap bottle of pink champagne and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by the sweet raspberry taste.

Since the Raspberry liquor was going to be $35 and I wanted to serve this at an afternoon gathering, I was able to replace the liquor with Torani Raspberry syrup. Was very good without the extra alcohol.

I make a version of this drink. It's too sweet with the nectar, so I only use a splash, and I add muddle raspberries, and a little vodka to the mix. It is amazing, but deadly!!!

I don't like champagne at all so when I was gifted a bottle from my co-worker I set out to figure out what I could do with it to make it drinkable.

Answer- this recipe! I tried several but this was the best bar none!

It was so deliciously yummy and as long as it stayed cold it was perfect. It was on the sweet side so if you don't like sickeningly sweet drinks you probably won't like this one.

Requires twice as much champagne as the recipe calls for. Very good with the proper ratio but it's cloyingly sweet as written.

I love champagne, and I even like my champagne on the sweeter side, but overall this recipe was just too sweet.  I even tried adding more champagne to the mix and although it was better (about 6 oz instead of the 4 oz suggested) I didn't really like it.  Better without the nectar and using less Chambord.
