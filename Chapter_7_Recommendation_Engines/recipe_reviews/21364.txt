This is very similar to my stuffing, I’ve been making for 50 years, but I use a bit more butter (1 stick), dry sage and poultry seasoning. I bake it covered, outside the turkey and since there are no juices from the turkey I add turkey broth to moisten the bread (College Inn brand is available Thanksgiving thru Christmas), chicken broth will also work; bouillon is all salt. I also mix in some grated carrot, adds a little color. I cook the vegetables and seasonings in the butter until almost tender, then gently fold into the bread cubes, alternating with broth and bake at 350 degrees until heated thru, about 40 to 45 minutes... YUM!

This is the exact stuffing we have used my whole life ( I am 25).  It will be the stuffing that will be used every Thanksgiving till the day I die.  You may want to add a little poultry seasoning but the sage is fine on its own.  I know it looks too easy to be good.  But trust me, it is awesome.  Much better than stove top.  BTW fun for the kids.  Mom use to have me tear up loaves and loaves of bread for this and put into brown grociery bags.  If you want to give the kids something to do this would be it.  No knives needed.  Oh and recently I discovered Herb Ox chicken boullion which is awesome used as chicken broth.

My Nan's recipe that I make every year is very similar to this but I also use some of the juice from the Turkey and poultry seasoning. What really makes this something special though is using FRESH parsley. If you cut up a few sprigs and add it to your saute mix it gives it that little something extra!! I don't stuff my bird but I do bake the stuffing for a while in the oven.

I like this recipe, It's basically the same recipe I've been using for the past 50 years, it's simple, fast and favorable. A trick I picked up from my daughter is to add a minced clove of garlic (smash first then mince) it's not enough to make it taste garlicky but it adds a certain richness and depth, plus I use a cube of butter to sauté the onions and celery, other than that it is the same recipe.  
I always have a lot of stuffing left over after stuffing the bird so I bake the rest of it in a dish and I add about a half a can of chicken broth so it doesn't dry out (the portion in the bird doesn't dry out). Cover the dish with foil.  A nice thing about this recipe (and most stuffings) is that you can make it up to a week before, don't add any broth to it till later. Freeze it in a couple of large baggies until the day before then thaw it (bread thaws quickly) when it thaws then add your broth. One less thing to have to think about when your fixing several things.

This is almost my Grandmother's stuffing - except hers used a whole stick of butter melted into 2 cups of water (I use vegetable broth) & more like 1/2 bunch celery. It's the only stuffing that my family asks for! I prefer to double the bread cubes and spice mix in my recipe for a drier stuffing - which would make it more comparable to this recipe without the water/broth. My Mom shared our table today and was thrilled that I still use this recipe!

Okay so the verdict is in... it was a hit! It was wonderful even without using the poultry seasoning that I completely forgot about.

I liked the way it turned out, but it seemed to me to be a little too "mushy". This is my first time making homemade stuffing, I have been using the boxed stuffing for my whole life... so is it that it is mushy or is it that I'm just accustomed to the boxed stuffing?

I was looking at the picture that came with this recipe and the bread bits looked kind of "cubed like"... whereas mine kind of lost its shape. 

If anyone has any advice or tips please let me know! 
thank you :)

This is almost exactly the same stuffing my mom makes and now I make every year except we add poultry seasoning and thyme and a bit of salt and pepper. So simple and so amazingly good!!

First ever attempt at stuffing, and everybody at Thanksgiving dinner loved it. I added carrots, and instead of a packet of mixed seasonings I threw in a bunch of my own seasonings (parsley, basil, black pepper, garlic powder, sage). Definitely will be a Thanksgiving staple now.

This recipe is very similar to the stuffing my mother made and that I still make, the only difference is that we add  2 eggs and a small serving of mashed potatoes.  I'm not a fan of instant potatoes but they work well in this recipe and help to bind it all together, and I do stuff my turkey with it and bake the left over in the oven.

This is how my mom made our stuffing on Thanksgiving our whole lives. My sister and I always tore the bread into pieces the night before. Then mom would let the bread dry out over night. I look forward to mom's stuffing every year!

This is the recipe my mom used, but never stuffed the turkey with it.  She would pour some of the juice from the turkey and bake it at 350 degrees for 45-60 minutes, adding turkey juices if it seemed dry.  I really love this dressing!

It's so easy, so good! Essentially, this is my Grandma's recipe. Also works in a glass covered casserole in the oven at 350 for 30-35 mins.

Perfect! Just the kind of stuffing I wanted. I added turkey stock since I wasn’t putting it inside the turkey.

This is a recipe for basic stuffing/dressing passed to me by my grandmother & Mother from the 1930's! Used for inside & out of the bird. Dressing baked separately needs more moisture so we've always used chicken or turkey broth mixed with drippings. Have always used poultry seasoning to taste & fresh sage. Yes, I've grated carrot for a bit of color. Being from the South our family always blended the white bread with cornbread (homemade) but not too much to turn it into a cornbread stuffing. Gives it body & extra flavor. We use lots of pepper since that's our taste. This is a wonderful recipe on it's own that you can tweek without over doing it because our idea of a dressing/stuffing is to be flavorful but not over powering like those with meat, chestnuts, etc.  Thanks for posting!

This is pretty close to my grandmother's recipe.  the only thing it needs is poultry seasoning and the giblets. Cook the giblets and chop them until they a fine.

Great traditional stuffing, I’ve been making it this way for 50 years, I’ve taught my son and daughter and now grandchildren. I had to cans of small olives halved. Watch chicken/ turkey broth if you don’t want mushy. Baking is key, plus it adds a nice crusty surface.

This was freaking amazing... Sage seas? I added my own spices, to taste I cooked some in my bird, some out (See my pic) It helped my turkey hold in more moisture n flavor, but I think we, collectively, liked the crispier not-cooked-in-the-bird dish better Will def try again!!
