The recipe doesn't state how you should cook the potatoes before you prepare them so I cubed them, coated them in a little olive oil and baked them in a 400 degree oven for about 35 minutes...which made them crispy up to that point.  Then I followed the recipe as stated.  They were really good...kind of reminded me of the Schwann's sweet potatoes that I love.

I made this sweet potatoes recipe (for ten) and added marshmallows until golden brown.  Very easy and delicious.  I would definitely make this recipe again.

Amazing! I took the advice of other reviewers and baked them, that little bit of crispness keeps them from falling apart until they get in your mouth ;) Made them for Thanksgiving and was getting compliments on them hours after dinner! FYI this recipe calls for about 1lb of sweet potatoes, adjust accordingly!

This recipe turned out really great. The only thing is that I thought that it went further than 2 servings! Works great as a side dish on Thanksgiving and Christmas!

I had to cook mine a little longer, more like 40 minutes. Not bad, though I have had better.

This is a great recipe to start with, but I doubled the amount of potatoes and kept everything else the same. I felt it would be too sweet if I added so much brown sugar. As I made them, they turned out great, a hint of sweetness but not syrupy. I also didn't know how they were supposed to be cooked, so I cut them into squares and then boiled them for 10 minutes while I made the sauce. Then I put them in a casserole pan, poured the sauce over and waited until it was ready to throw the meal into the oven. Truly awesome!

Made these for Thanksgiving. They were to die for. Scaled the recipe up to 10 and the potatoes barely made it to the table before they were gone. Very sweet! Would make this recipe again for sure!

Oh boy was this a hit!
My guests were from a country that eats sweet potatoes with butter and gravy, and were apprehensive about having them with sugar, especially as part of the main course and not even a dessert, but they all loved it.
After baking it I still had a lot of syrup left which I had to siphon off. 
I forgot the nutmeg/mace but I topped it with marshmallows and it was fine.
I did end up with a lot of leftovers so I will maybe make less when scaling it up next time. I scaled it up to six servings so maybe it becomes less accurate the more you make.

I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes but my boyfriend is & he really liked this recipe. I think my sweet potatoes were too big because it took much longer to cook, but it was a fairly easy recipe to follow. I'll try it again, but with smaller potatoes.

This recipe is pretty good. Plus, it's easy and fast. The person didn't mention how to cook the sweet potatoes, but I knew to wrap them in foil in put them in the oven @ 375 degrees for about an hr.

I topped these with marshmallows, and took another reviewer's advice and sliced them up and cooked them for a half hour before I followed the recipe.  I loved these!  Thanks so much.

My family loved this! I used precooked, presliced sweet potatoes. I made the simple syrup in the microwave. At the end, I added cinnamon. This was quick, easy, and delicious! Thanks!

I served them with sweet peas and the "Best Slow Cooker Chicken" recipe from this site. Yummy!
