Yummy! Two changes- I cooked it in a show cooker instead of the oven and then I sub out the potatoes for cheddar rice.

This was so good. I made it on the grill because my stove is out, but it still worked. Also substituted monk fruit sweetener since I don't use Splenda. I want to drink the glaze straight out of the roasting pan, and the meat is lovely and juicy. Served it with potatoes and cucumbers. Absolutely would make again.
