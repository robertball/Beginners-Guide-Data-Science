I googled the amount of 125 grams of cream cheese, it is a half cup plus one tablespoon. I had exactly 4 ounces of cream cheese to use, this was PERFECT for me. I did not have spinach tortillas, I used regular flour tortillas. The kids and I loved this. I think I would add a little taco seasoning next time I make this, but as is, it was a great way to use odds and ends in my fridge.

Excellent!  We used chipotle black bean salsa and they turned out SO yummy.  They were a big hit at our party!

I made these for a quick snack for my husben and I and two kids  We all loved them they were pretty, easy to prepare, and used up some spinach from my garden! I will make again for some get togethers, partys , and just for fun. I used whole wheat tortillas and white cheese . Thanks again and God bless!!

We made these for our Super Bowl party and they were somewhat of a hit. Most people could only eat 1 or 2 because all of the cream cheese is a little much.

These were good but could use more of the filling.

I made these for a Christmas get together. I thought they were just okay. They certainly were easy to make but I don't think I would bother making them again though.

You can't cut the wrap without the cream cheese all spreading out of it.

Thanks, these were easy to make.  I added some diced green pepper, green onion, and tomato.
