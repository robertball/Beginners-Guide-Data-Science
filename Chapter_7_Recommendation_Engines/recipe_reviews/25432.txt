This will work in the oven - wrap in foil sprayed with cooking spray and place in a baking dish to catch any leaks.  Bake at 350 for about 30 minutes, then open foil and bake an additional 10 minutes to help carmelize the sauce on the meat.  You may have to adjust cooking time depending on the size of the ribs, and you can turn them during the last 10 minutes if you want.  I used this method often when I did not have a grill for ribs and chicken.

Ok, so I have made country ribs many times before, and I've always seasoned them with salt and pepper & boiled them in plain water before grilling them with bbq sauce... and I thought they were pretty good.  Well, let me tell you.  I will never make them that way again!  I am so glad I tried this because the ribs had so much more bbq flavor and they were so tender and moist.  They came out dry sometimes when I did them my old way.  I only made about 1 lb. since it's just me and my hubby, and they were awesome!  Thanks for the recipe!!  It's definitely a keeper!

These were great! I used boneless country style ribs and boiled them up the day before. I boiled the ribs for 40 minutes and then took the ribs out. The sauce was pretty thin so I boiled it more to thicken it. I put the ribs and sauce in a plastic bag and refrigerated them overnight. The next day we just fired up the grill and cooked them about 20 minutes using the thicken sauce to baste. They were very tasty and tender. Our guest asked for the recipe.

O! M! G! THIS WAS SOOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOD!!! I used 1 large bottle of masterpiece bbq sauce, 3/4 cup of sugar, a splash of lemon, and just enough water to cover the ribs. Instead of 40 min, i boiled mine for about an hour and a half...we were waiting for my mother-in-law to get home so decided to just keep boiling them till she was almost home...and it turned out soooo goood! the meat was sooooo tender and juicy! we didn't think we were going to finish all of it but it was gone in no time!!! i also took another reviewers suggestion and let it sit covered for about 10 minutes before eating! thanks for the recipe! will make everytime now!!!

This is a great way to make tender juicy ribs (or chicken).  I use beer instead of water and that really gives it a savory flavor.

Cooking the ribs in BBQ sauce is a great idea.  Thanks.  I cooked them in a slow cooker and they were fall off the bone tender.  The sauce I used needed some kick so I added a little vinegar and hot sauce.  After they cooked, the sauce was so good, I reduced it to use it as a grilling and dipping sauce.  I've made these twice now, and will make them again.

This was a great way to grill.  I have tried other recipes where you boil the ribs then bake them and I was wanting to try one that I could  use the grill.  I decided to try this.  I was skeptical about boiling it with bbq sauce and then using it to baste with.  I figured it would be real runny with the water but everything cooked down and got thickened just like a perfect bbq sauce.  I will use this method again!

These are amazing.  Now this is the only way that I make these.  It makes the meat so tender and it falls right off the bone.  I did take some of the other reviewers advice and add some spices to the water while simmering.  Makes the meat have this wonderful flavor.  We have this great smokehouse restaurant here and these are almost exactly like the ribs I can get there.  Thank you so much for posting.  This is definately a keeper.

Great method for cooking ribs, Tammi. Thanks for sharing.The ribs came out "falling off the bone tender and moist" just the way we like them. But why waste the time and effort with a bottled store bought sauce? I encourage everyone to try the Bourbon Whisky BBQ Sauce by Kevin on this site. You'll be glad you did!

This is a great rib recipe.  I loved pre-cooking the ribs in the oven and just glazing them on the grill.  Less chance for me to burn them.  I ended up cooking my ribs about an hour.  But they were still super tender and tasty.  Make sure you get a good bbq sauce since the extra spice won't really do much if you buy a cheap sauce.

My wife made these, did not like them at all. I could tell that the ribs had been cooked with water, even though I saw her take them off the barbeque. The meat was chewey like eastern style ribs., The sauce overpowered the meat flavor of the ribs. This was definitely not a southwestern recipe from Phoenix. For real bar-b-que flavor. Remember, flames seal in the meat flavor, water boils/steams the meat flavor out.

I was looking for a recipe that I could cook in the stove and this was it.  I boiled (40 min) my ribs in 36 oz of Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce.  2 cups of apple juice and 2 bottles of beer.  So...good.  Then I put them on a lined cookie sheet using aluminum foil.  Covered.  Cooked in over for 30 minutes.  Removed the top cover of foil and broiled for another 10 minutes to make the top just right.  These were so good.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.  (I also added a pinch of pepper and salt)

DELICIOUS!! We followed the recipe exact; however we: 1. Used a 40 oz bottle of BBQ sauce instead of the 36 oz 2. We simmered the BBQ for 1 hour and 15 minutes, not 40 minutes. This made the Ribs extra tender. 3. We added garlic powder in addition to the salt and pepper. Overall, this was a PHENOMENAL recipe, and I cannot wait to make it again. The Ribs were tender, savory, and tangy-- YUM!!

I tried this and was disappointed the first time , based on all the glowing reviews. I used top quality ribs (expensive) and followed the recipe exactly. Did add lemon juice and i can beer. I found it to have a greasy after-taste.I would have given it 2 stars.I used the sauce they were boiled in as the grill marinade. this proved to be a mistake as the fat that had boiled out was slathered back on.-, and sort of clung. I tried them again--this time i tossed the boiled marinade and used full bodied fresh sauce as the grill marinade. Voila-big improvement. Not great-but very good . Will make them again. My choice for sauce is 1 part Sweet Baby Ray's to 1  part Stubb's original for boiling. Good balance. On the grill I used K.C.Masterpiece. As someone else said the sauce is important.I'll tinker some more with these to get to 5 stars. The potential is there.

I have used this recipe quite a few times now, and every time the ribs turn out AWESOME!  I usually use a cheap bbq sauce for boiling, then use Sweet Baby Ray's to baste them in the oven.  Yum!

These were a lot more tender than I expected and very flavorful. I boiled them on the stove for almost 2 hours and then transferred them to the oven (220) for about an hour since it was raining outside. Don't think you could go wrong with these if using your favorite BBQ sauce. Thanks.

Awesome recipe!  Terrific for when you don't have 8 hours to marinate the ribs.  Threw in a whole bunch of garlic cloves instead of using onions and put the ribs in the oven at 375 while reducing the sauce at high heat and frequently basting the ribs with.  The ribs turned out saucy, tender, and so tasty!  Was perfect with steamed mini new potatoes and mixed vegetables.  Even my four year old asked for more!

I took another reviewers suggestion and made the Whiskey BBQ sauce found at the following link on AllRecipes: http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Bourbon-Whiskey-BBQ-Sauce/Detail.aspx  When the BBQ sauce began bubbling, I popped the ribs in. BTW, I used the meatier country cut ribs. I then added 1 beer and water to cover the ribs. (Guess that would make it Boilermaker BBQ Sauce? LOL!) As its cold outside, I didn't grill after simmering, I put them in my roasting pan and popped them in my oven on 350 for about 25 mins. I reserved some of the sauce, removed the fat, and drizzled it on the ribs 2x while baking. They were WONDERFUL!!! Rave reviews from everyone so definitely WILL be making this again!

I am a bbq rib making machine now that I have this fantastic recipe! My kids and husband absolutely love this recipe and they constantly order ribs when we go out.    I do add apple cider vinegar and use an extremely spicy bbq sauce with some Baby Rays in the water.  You won't be sorry you tried this!

I had about 4 lbs of beef boneless chuck "country style" ribs and didn't want to use the grill.  Posted a recipe request on the site and at the suggestion of another member (for some reason I can't locate her recommendation now....maybe they delete them after a period??)  I made a variation of this recipe using her directions. I boiled them for about 3 1/2 hrs or so on stovetop. (Used Kraft BBQ sauce for the boiling step.)  Then pitched boiling liquid, onions, etc. Put ribs in a 13x9 foil-lined pan and poured on Sweet Baby Ray's sauce. Then baked at 350 for 30 mins covered and about 30 mins uncovered.  I did baste a few times during the oven time.  Fork-tender and delicious with a nice carmelization of the sauce.  Thanks!

I tried these ribs as a last resort. If they didn't come out, or we didn't like them..I was done with ribs! They are fantastic! Such a simple recipe, yet the meat was soooo tender. I used boneless ribs and they were moist and flavorful.  I took the other reviewers' comments as well..added a bottle of beer (ale, to be exact), and a huge clove of garlic, sliced really thick.  I also did my onions in thick wedges. Next time I make these, I will only use one bottle of bbq sauce; using two is pretty wasteful considering all that is left over (even with boiling it down and using it to baste the ribs on the grill). I didn't care for taking the time to boil down the liquid.  Next time I will keep the second bottle on hand for basting and using to dip the ribs in (upon serving) if desired.  Again, fantastic recipe and thanks for sharing!

I've made ribs and roasts this way for about 25 years. Just thought it up one day, didn't know anybody else made them like this. Some brands of sauce are better for cooking this way than others. Some have so much sugar in them, that they can burn, so you have to be careful. I use the leftover sauce over noodles, or make barbecue sandwiches and use the sauce over the bread. Friends and family always rave about my ribs and noodles.

This was great.  Took the fear and time consuming prep work out of making great, family pleasing ribs.  I boiled in 1 bottle of BBQ sauce (a great sauce from Trader Joe's) and 1 Budweiser, and otherwise followed the recipe.  Turned out great.  I'll definitely make this again and maybe even for a party.

These were GREAT!  I did just like the recipe except I sprinkled my favorite spices over them just before grilling that way you for sure get the spice taste.  I used K.C. Masterpiece, Hickory flavored BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the recipe!

Loved this! As suggested by others, used a can of beer rather than water to add another layer of flavor. Outstanding flavor all the way through. No more parboiling in water for me - this is my new go-to recipe for country ribs.

This one deserves 10!!!  It was the best country ribs I've had.  I read past reviews and also used a bottle of beer, garlic clove thick sliced and onion wedged.  This is a definite keeper.  Chunks of the ribs were falling off as I was turning them on grill (well george forman b/c I too, like a past review, have no grill)  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL THANKS FOR SHARING THIS ONE!!!

I have made country style ribs for years and they NEVER turned out this moist and juicy!!! I boiled in Guinness, Baby Ray BBQ Sauce, water, some cinnamon and an onion quartered, for an hour and a half. Then I put them on a foiled lined cookie sheet, basted them with new sauce and baked at 350 for 10 minutes, turned and basted again with more sauce for ten minutes!! They were the BEST I've ever made. The kids LOVED them too!!

I have made ribs many ways, with recipes taking anywhere from a few hours to a few days. This by far is the best recipe I have ever done to ribs. Boiling in BBQ sauce adds so much flavor to the meat. I boiled them for an hour and then use the leftover sauce to baste the ribs on the grill every 5 minutes after turning. If the sauce is too thin after your done.boiling the ribs, simply remove the ribs and boil the sauce on high for ten minutes. It will thicken up nicely.

My 1st attempt at ribs.  It was easy and I used Phils BBQ, since they're local, and they turned out great.  Will make them again soon.

Loved it i poured some beer on the ribs when they were half way done cooking on the grill for extra moisture. I also took the whole pot out with me to use the extra sauce to baste the ribs while grilling. Thanks for the tip it was awesome!

Rub ribs with any kind of rub and let sit in fridge for at least a half hour.

Bring salted water to a boil and then add ribs and barbecue sauce and onion.  Then slow boil for 40 minutes. (On my stove slow boil is about 5.)

Sauce is too thin to use for anything else-try less water next time.

Ok this makes seriously good ribs!  I cooked them in the water mix earlier in the day, then cooled & refrigerated until ready to complete cooking.  Placed them in a pan with leftover water, covered, then baked for about another 30 minutes (didn't baste because they were pretty much covered in liquid)  These literally melted in your mouth!  Thank you Phoenix33_64 for a simple but delicious meal!

I used country bone-in ribs...I didn't have onion so didn't add that to the sauce...and this was still a home-run! My ribs were fairly thick, so I was worried that the cooking times would be wrong, but they were right on. This is my husband's favorite food, and I've always been intimidated to try it (because I didn't think I could match his favorite BBQ joint) but no longer! This was a home run!

I love to cook and this has by far been the easiest recipe that I have found for ribs. I did this exact recipe and then instead of putting it on the grill, I put it in the oven on 350 for 25 minutes and it turned out amazing. All of my friends told me this was the best ribs ever, Thanks to PHOENIX33_64 for an amazing recipe. The ribs were full, thick, and VERY VERY MOIST and NOT rubbery at all. I recommend this recipe to anyone looking to make AMAZING RIBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Greatness!!! I made these a couple of times in like a week time frame. The first time I made them, they were not seasoned. The second time they had a deal going on at the grocery store buy one pack of seasoned boneless pork ribs get two free so I used those the second time around and WOW it was like a party in my mouth...lol! I made them the second time for a 4th of July party and received compliments from everyone. The host called the next day and asked for the recipe. There is such a great debate over grilling or boiling well I absolutely see NOTHING wrong with boiling ribs from here on out. The final result is like fall apart tender and juicy piece of meat.

As the author says:  LIGHTLY OIL GRATE.  These ribs stick to the grate, so make sure it's oiled.    (I also chose to use red wine instead of water for the stove-top braise.  Then I reduced it to a sauce).

I love it!! This recipe is so easy. I add 1 or 2 cans of guinness beer to the pot before adding water. Then after removing the ribs I reduce the sauce  to a thicker consistency to baste the ribs on the grill.

I've made this several times and everybody raves about it.  As recommended by others, I only use one bottle of barbeque sauce (whatever is on sale) and then when grilling, I baste with a good quality sauce.  I like Diana's Gourmet.  I also add a bottle of beer and some garlic and then top the pot up with water.  I also find that 45 mins is usually long enough to boil them and I've done this the night before and stored in the fridge.  The next day, this makes one of the quickest weekday meals.  Thanks for the great recipe.  I won't be making ribs any other way.

I only barbecued the ribs the first time I tried this recipe.  After that, I usually boil them for 40 and then bake for 30.  I love the suggestion to boil the ribs in BBQ sauce, though, and that's why I'm giving the 5-star review to this recipe.  I'm making these ribs as I write this review, and I cannot wait to taste them.  This is a great recipe, no matter how you make the ribs.

Realized at the last minute we had no gas left in the grill, so they went into the oven after a half hour on the stove simmering in the sauce.  They stayed in the oven for about 30 minutes and fell off the bones.  My family devoured them!  One of my boys even suggested that I share this recipe with his 'favorite' restaurant in town so other people could eat ribs this good!  Now that was a compliment!!  My only mistake was not making more ribs.

After I boiled the ribs and moved them to the grill, there was at least a quart of water-diluted sauce, not useful for basting.  I see that as a major fault.  Fortunately, I had another sauce available.  I think this preparation is too much work and trouble. I've had just as good ribs by basting them in a pan and baking in the oven for an hour or more.  Sorry, don't mean to be mean.

I've made this several times now and get rave reviews every time I do.  The left-overs make great sandwiches.

These were very tender and delicious.  Probably the best rib recipe I've ever used.  I never did ribs much because they always turned out to tough for my taste, but these were very flavorful and easy to prepare.  Thanks for sharing.

Wonderful recipe. The ribs turned out great. After I boiled them, I put them in the oven at 350 and baked them. My husband loved them!

I just made these ribs tonight and had to come and give my raving reviews..I asked my hubby how he liked them and he said the only thing wrong with them was he wished I had made more..LOL....
I used sweet baby rays bbq sauce, and 2 bottles of beer to boil them in, and I used baby back ribs..They were fall of the bone tender and I boiled the sauce down and brushed it over the ribs while grilling ....I will be making these again!

These were great!  I used a mix of a few barbeque sauces that we had around, added garlic, and replaced the water with beer.  I also dipped the ribs in the sauce each time I turned them on the grill.  Very moist, very flavorful, very easy!!

Decided to try this and it's a great concept for BBQ ribs.  It's quick, and fast, but most of all it's tasty.  I've given it 4 stars only because I altered it in my use.  Instead of water, I used red wine.  Then I boiled it for 1 hour.  After that, I put the ribs(pork) in the oven at 350 for 15 minutes, then dipped them in the sauce they boiled in, instead of basting, then popped the ribs back in the oven for another 15 minutes.  The result was very tender and tasty.  Will make again with chicken next time.

This is the best rib recipe we’ve yet to try.  We omitted the salt, used
Bulls-Eye bbq sauce & added a couple of whole garlic cloves.  We used close to 4lbs. of beef ribs & slow boiled them for approx. 50 minutes.  Instead of grilling, we used the oven (475 – 15 minutes), basted several times & turned the ribs once.  My mouth is actually watering just writing this review!

I've tried recipe after recipe for ribs. They always come out tough and tasteless or overcooked and tasteless. These ribs get a superior rating from everyone in my house. I usually only cook one slab, and we make do. They were on sale so I bought two big slabs and told my husband we'd just be eating the leftovers for several days. HA! ALL GONE! I quartered each slab and put them in my big glass soup pot with two bottles of sauce and enough water to cover. I microwaved them for about an hour on 7, then took them to the grill. One thing I really like about this recipe is nearly all the fat cooked out of them in the water. I did not use the water to baste. I grilled the meaty side first for about 5 minutes, then flipped them meaty side up and sauced them well, closed the grill and turned it as low as possible and let them go about 15 minutes.Then I turned the grill off and left them sitting another 15 minutes to keep warm and to 'set' the sauce.  Delish! I would even serve these for guests!

This is a Great recipe.  I've never made ribs before and this was easy.  I made them for 14 people and everyone loved them.  WILL make again.  I used beef ribs instead of pork but that was the only change.

This was my second try on grilling ribs and it was a success. The first time I ended up basting something similar to leather boots and no one ate them. This time however, people took home the leftovers. I was so proud and the ribs were wonderful. The prep time was so short and simple compared to other recipes and that is just what I needed!!! Great job on this recipe!!!

This was a great recipe. I battled for years trying to find a BBQ sauce that I liked and even tried to find a good recipe, but to no avail.  FINALLY I found a bottled type that was delicious.  Shopping at a warehouse store I saw a huge bottle of Cattlemens. I thought I would try it and LOVED it. I will never use anything else, nothing is better than this.  I tried the recipe useing my fav and it turned out great!! Thanks

These ribs are fabulous!  My husband called them "restaurant ribs".  I used Hunt's BBQ sauce which worked just fine.  This recipe was actually fun to make because my husband did the outdoor grilling after I did the indoor portion on the stove - teamwork!

I've never made ribs before, but I always heard boiling them is the death of a good rib. This recipe was so easy and full of flavor, it was a great starting off point for ribs! Boiled for 45 minutes on medium, then finished them on the grill (grill was SUPER hot, so only about 4 minutes per side) 
They were great!!!!!!

This is pretty much the way I do my country ribs also. We have several family gatherings during the summer and I am the "rib cook". I do up 40lbs in 2 batches in a large pressure cooker @ about 3 min per lb. I use bourbon to thin the barbeque sauce. Use the grill for the grill marks by the time that the meat is well marked it is hot and ready to serve. Left over sauce......I freeze and reuse.

These ribs are out of this world great!  The only thing I changed was to sprinkle on some Pampered Chef Smoky BBQ rub before putting them on the grill.   This gave them some extra flavor and also basted them with leftover sauce - yum!

Having done ribs only a few times in a few different ways, this was the recipe I was looking for. Awesome fall off the bone tenderness and great flavour. The only variation due to unexpected visitors) was that I boiled the ribs for about 1h 20m instead of 40 minutes and grilled for maybe 10m (on high) just to get a nice glaze and grill marks.  My question now is, what to do with the reduction? It has such a great smell and it seems a shame to simply dispose of it. Any ideas anyone?

REALLY good.  I will definitely make this again.  I happened tyo use the recipe for the "A Very Popular BBQ sauce", and that made it a little labour intensive, but it really was a good alternative to some of the other recipes for ribs.  aPPARENTLY making ribs is a rather complicated and involved process, so this recipe using that BBQ recipe, make a very tasty tender bunch of ribs.

So yummy, easy and tender. Added a few things to sauce while it cooked like apples, garlic, and honey to sweeten it up a little but I would totally do this exactly like the recipe if I wasn't feeling creative and KNOW they would still be great ribs!

The ribs were great. I took advice from others and only used one jar of sauce to boil them and a used fresh to bast with. I cooked them in the oven for about 20-25 mins covered then uncovered for 5-10 mins. I just let then set covered until ready to eat. Hubby loved them! Thanks

okay...I have never made ribs before, but my husband said these were the BEST he has ever had. They were awesome. I boiled them for and hour and a half in the BBQ sauce and then broiled them as a grill was not available. I flipped them half way and re-basted them. They were awesome!!!

These were awesome!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's sauce and apple juice instead of water to cover.  My husband was upset that I only made 1 slab, so next time, I have to make 2!

These were nice, but not the best ribs that i have had. They were nice and tender, but still.... After i took the ribs out i let it simmer for at least a half an hour, and it still wasn't thick enough to put on the meat, even with the addition of cornflour. In the end everyone had been waiting so long to eat that i had to just braise them with another bottle of BBQ sauce we had in the cupboard, rather than using the marinade. This was a little dissapointing, as we had already used 2 bottles in the marinade, and it seemed a little wasteful. Overall the taste was good, but i dont think i will make them again.

Excellent!  I have been making a version of this recipe for years in which I boil the ribs in plain water and then soak them overnight in BBQ sauce.  I think this is even better.  Boiling them in the BBQ sauce and onions gives them extra taste.  I boiled them for 1 hour and let them sit in the BBQ sauce that they cooked in overnight.   Everone LOVES my ribs and this just kicked it up a notch!

We do our ribs similar, but the steps are opposite. I grill ours on the BBQ grill or smoke them with charcoal/wood smoke until the color I desire. Then we put them in the oven and cover them with sauce in a lidded pan or roaster at about 275 degrees. An hour to two hours later they are so tender you can remove any bones with your fingers.  Delicious.

We had to do 25 pounds of ribs!  We used 3 bottles of sauce and then filled the pan with water.  Then we boiled them up 5 pounds at a time, taking out one batch and adding aother until they were done.  Although it was a little time comsuming the end product was worth it.  We used a chipotle barbeque sauce and they were finger licking good!

Mmmmm... Yummy!  Ribs had always seemed to complicated, this recipe is easy and delicious.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, it worked great.  Ribs were tender and moist.

If I could give this recipe a "6", I would!!  These were the best ribs ever!  I have never had bones actually falling off of country ribs as I removed them from the grill!!  Actually, we don't have a grill, so they were coming off as they were removed from the George Foreman, but wow oh wow!!  Amazing!!  Hubby LOVED them, as did our 3 year old:)  I will never make ribs any other way!!

Very easy and very yummy!  We added a few garlic cloves to the sauce also.  This was also really convenient since it was a last minute decision to cook ribs on the grill.

These were delicious.  I followed the recipe, however I may have added just a touch too much water.  Next time I may try to add more BBQ sauce or less water.  Still had a good flavor, but I think I would have liked a little more.

Very good.  Our gas grill wasn't working right so I just put them in a sheet pan lined with tin foil and broiled them for a few minutes on each side.  These were very tasty.  I did use the boneless country style ribs and reduced the sauce after boiling/simmering the ribs.  I used the Bourbon Whiskey BBQ sauce recipe by Kevin on this site and it was perfect.  Thanks Phoenix33_64 for posting this method.  I bought some more country ribs to use this recipe again :)

Tremendous considering the simplicity of this meal. I didn't have two bottles of bbq sauce, so I just used one bottle plus a container of mandarin oranges plus the juice. It was so good that even my finicky five-year old loved it. Tender, flavorful, and easy.

The flavors were great.  Extremely tender, but  too dry for my liking.. AND I "boiled" very low.  Perhaps I will use this recipe and braise in the oven, covered. Anyway, served with garlic mashed potatoes and stuffed mushrooms.  Very good.

I love these ribs!  Best I ever made.  You can change it up with diferent spices, maybe some apple cider vinegar if you like, but it's good as is.  And tonight, I used this method with some frozen chicken tenderloins.  Delicious!  Thanks for the recipe.

Wonderful! Boiling in cranberry juice adds a wondeful fruity flavor to the meat. I have made several times since getting this recipe and it has quickly become a family favorite.

Delicious.  I boiled them on low for at least 90 minutes and I finished them in the oven (wrapped in foil for about 30, then uncovered for 10-15).

I followed the recipe exactly and even my husband was floored by how good this was! I used a mixture of bbq sauces I had available in the house (Open Pit Hickory, store brand Honey bbq) and it gave the ribs that much more flavor and personality. I also shared this recipe with my dad, who is a butcher and a cook and he loved it! This is definitely one to keep in your personal cookbook, thank you!

Awesome!  I doubled the cooking time and kept the pot as low as I could.  Grilled just long enough to crisp up the bbq sauce.  Next time I will cook in the crockpot and then grill.  Thanks for an awesome recipe!

A-mazing!!!!  ours were gone in a flash!  The kids loved them.  Tender and so good.  I only had a half bottle of bbq sauce, so I added water to it during the boil.  Once I removed the ribs for grilling, I simmered the sauce way down.  It was so good.  I definately recommend this recipe.

I followed this recipe with no alterations and was absolutely thrilled with the outcome.  My husband was VERY skeptical when he saw me put them in a pot to boil.  He became a convert after the first bite!  These are fantastic!  I had Kraft BBQ sauce on hand, and they were great with that.  I can't wait to try this with Jack Daniels BBQ sauce.  Thanks for the share!

These ribs were the best ribs I've ever prepared, by far. My only issue with them was in the fact that, even though I didn't cook them on a very high heat, because of the sugar in the sauce, the BBQ sauce burned on the bottom of my pan so badly that it took my a day and a half of working on it and soaking to get it off. It still left some black marks on the bottom of my pan. (My mistake was leaving my husband in charge of them while I ran to the store and he didn't smell it burning on the pan.) I think that I would cook the ribs in a crock pot in the sauce and avoid that whole issue.

Very tender and tasty.  This was an easy way to cook ribs, I don't have a lot of experience with it.  I was skeptical about boiling the ribs beforehand, and using bbq sauce, but that's what made it wonderful.  I made the recipe exactly as written, and was impressed.

I  must've done something wrong because according to all the reviews this recipe shouldve been great. Unfortunately, mine were tough and not tender at all. I'll stick to using my slow cooker when I want fall-off-the-bone tender ribs.

I was craving for BBQ ribs and wanted it to be easy.  This recipe was great.  It was quick to prepare and tasted wonderful.  I had family over to try this recipe and everyone agreed that it was like being at a restaurant!  The meat fell off of the bones and the flavor was very good.  I let the ribs boil on the stove for about 1 to 1.5 hours as I prepared other items.  This is the way I plan to prepare ribs from now on.

This is a great recipe, The only changes I made were in adding a few celery stalks, big onion and a bay leaf to the water. It makes the whole house smell good.

Outstanding and very delicious!  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ Sauce and I did have some apple juice that I used instead of water.  I WILL make these again!

This was so easy and SOOO good!  Boiling them with water and BBQ sauce made a huge difference, and it was nice to have a rib recipe where I didn't have to use the oven.  Perfect on a hot day!

Awesome.  Next time I will take someone's suggestion and reduce the sauce after removing the ribs.  The sauce should have been thicker.

I use country style ribs, 2 bottles bbq, onion, 1 beer and the rest water. Boil for 1 1/2 hour - then to the grill....Easy and delicious. Can also boil ahead and then you just have to grill and baste!!

This was a great jumping off recipe!  I rubbed my ribs with a rib rub, put them in the pot, covered with a bottle of Sweet Baby Rays BBQ sauce (our fav), then covered in apple juice (something about cooking/marinating pork in apple juice, it's the bomb) then boiled for about 35-45 min.  Then basted the ribs with a little more BBQ sauce, put em on the grill to get a little crispy on the outside.  OMG!  Ridiculous.  FANTASTIC!  I have to make these at least once a week now or I go through withdrawals.

These were sooo easy and delicious!  As suggested by others I used a bottle of beer in place of water and let them boil for about an hour and a half.  They were sooo tender and flavorful.  I don't have an outdoor grille so after they boiled, I broiled them for about 15 minutes with additional marinade (which I added a little cornstarch to thicken it up).  My boyfriend and I loved it!

Very good! I used country ribs and added one bottle of beer and enough water to cover the ribs.  I also added some additional spices and used Open Pit BBQ sauce.  Have made 3 times now and will make again.

The ribs were tender, but the flavoring was bland.  Pretty ho-hum, as ribs go.

This recipe was SO simple.  I had about 2 lbs of ribs and boiled them in 1 bottle of bbq sauce with 1 bottle of beer as some other reviews sugested. Due to a sudden rain deluge we baked them in the oven at 475, though I would probably back it down to 450 for about 10-15 mins per side. They were great and very easy!

I tried this recipe for the second time today and I have to share that this time I cooked the ribs (frozen) in a crockpot for about 8 hours on low first, and then grilled and they came out great!  The only change was I used a can of beer rather than the water.  If you have the time, I would definitly recommend slow-cooking the ribs first, as they turned out juicier and tastier.  Thanks for sharing!  I will make these many more times!

This was the first time ive ever in my life and im 38yrs old and have been married 18yrs that i have EVER made ribs and these were so good the only tiny change i made was instead of brushing the ribs with the sauce while cooking on the grill i would take the ribs periodically and roll them in the sauce that i had poured from the stock pot into a throwable 13x9 pan worked out excellent i will make sure these are made again and again

I took another posters suggestion and used the bourbon whiskey bbq sauce recipe on this site.  I never cooked my ribs directly in the sauce before.  My family loved the added flavor. Instead of quartering the 1 onion, I halved 4  onions, cooked as directed but I then grilled the onion halves along with the ribs. It was a great combination.  Thanks for the recipe.

Made these ribs this w/end.  Everyone loved them.  I used Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce, and boiled ribs in beer as another reviewer said.  Turned out great.  Nothing like great "American" grillin'. If you make this recipe right, it turns out GREAT!  Thanks for the recipe!!

These are the BEST ribs I have ever had the pleasure of eating. They are so simple to make yet so delicious. My father, who has been eating ribs all over the country for over 40 years, claimed that these were the best ribs he had ever had, better than any restaurant or homemade ribs. I used sweet baby ray's bbq sauce and it couldnt have turned out better.

These ribs were pretty good...I followed the recipe exactly and my DH and I did enjoy them.  In saying that however, we probably won't eat these very often as we found that the use of 2 bottles of BBQ sauce is wasteful.  I also think that this recipe really depends on the kind of BBQ sauce used...choose carefully!

I had never made ribs before, and my husband requested them for his 40th birthday. This recipe was excellent! The only thing I did differently was to use an extra bottle of sauce to grill with instead of the boiling "juice". Everyone was very immpressed!

This was my first time making ribs, and boy, I sure am glad I picked this recipe to follow. They were delicious! What I learned from making them: The recipe says to heat the grill on high. I have a gas grill and put it as high as it goes--400 degrees. That turned out to be a bit too high and charred parts of it. I like my meat well done, so it wasn't a huge problem for me, but I don't think this would be to everyone's liking. Next time, I will set it to medium-high, under 350 and I think that will result in more even cooking.

Between the taste and ease of this recipe this is definitely a five star for my family. Meet was so tender. I did bake the ribs instead of barbecuing (ft and 1/2 of snow outside!) but definitely will barbecue this way also in the future.

I used baby back ribs (always a little easier to find in the market around here). And after boiled it for 40 minutes, I left the ribs in the pot overnight. Grilled the ribs just until there was a good char and served the reduced marinade as a gravy. Great reviews from my guests that night!

OMG, this turned out awesome!!! I only had 1.7 lbs of boneless country ribs, so I just used one bottle (18 oz) of BBQ sauce to boil in , used a whole onion quartered, salt , pepper, a splash of hot sauce, and half a can of beer to cover (instead of the water).  Boiled (almost down to simmer) for 40 minutes, cooked on high grill for 15.  MELT in your mouth goodness!!!

Awesome. I used sweet baby rays and half a bottle of sticky fingers. I then rinsed the ottles out with water, poured in a beer, 1/4 c of ketchup, brown sugar, dark molasses and a couple drops of liquid smoke. I boiled them covered for 40 minutes. Used k.c. Masterpiece mixed with boiled liquid to baste them on the grill. They were so sweet and crispy. OMG! Best ribs I've ever made. The BBQ sauce was great. Wo would have thought to boil them in BBQ sauce. Genius.

Easy and my neighbors said...so tender. I did simmer the ribs for 2 hours on very low, then to the charcoal grill
...and the taste was wonderful! Great recipe! Thanks...
PS I also used beer as I simmered the pork ribs.

I made these today and thought they were excellent.  Instead of basting them with the watered down bbq sauce, we used bbq sauce from the bottle when grilling them.  They  were so tender!

Make sure you have your BBQ mix/ribs on low low. I thought maybe the meat cooked too much too fast. But overall it didn't change the moistness later when grilled.

Definitely 5 stars!!  Very tasty and juicy.  I boiled the ribs for an hour before moving to the oven.  Forty minutes would not have been enough boiling for the ribs.  My family loved it, including my husband who first seemed skeptical since I had meant to do another recipe but bought the wrong cut.  I ended up using this recipe and I am glad that it came out better than I expected.  Will cook this again.

These were absolutely fantastic!  They definitely took the least cooking time of most other recipes I found, so that was really great.  The onions added SO much to the flavor!  My husband was really amazed at how these turned out, as well as myself!  Truly a great recipe!!

This turned out only okay. Made it last night and they were a bit bland and dry but it may have been due to the fact that I didn't constantly baste them while they cooked in the oven!!! I followed the reviewer on cooking them in the oven because I didn't have a grill. Thus, I didn't even give a second thought to adding any more sauce. Silly me! Next time will try adding sauce at the last 15 minutes of cooking time. Hope this helps.

Good recipe for the simple individual.  We used beef ribs instead of those little girl pork ribs and boiled them in Carolina BBQ sauce for 1 hour.  Then when the grill was nice and flaming we put the ribs on.  After about 10 mins they were nice and crispy.  Yum!  We added more BBQ sauce before serving.  Was fingering licking good while watching college ball.

Loved it!  Will use this recipe for all my bbq pork from now on!  Very flavorful and moist.  I did add some Penzey's Spices Pork Chop Seasoning to the boiling mixture but everything else as is.  It was awesome!

This was incredible - my ribs fell off of the bone and even my picky daughter said they were good and she would eat them. I had enough sauce left over that I put it a bowl and used it on chops as a marinade a few days later! Five stars aren't enough! But I do have to admit that I used another raters idea and used beer and added a little bit of sugar. Thanks so much for sharing Phoenix!

This was really good!  My husband preferred to use a new bottle of BBQ sauce to baste, instead of basting with the sauce in the pot since it was so thin...  but other than that we followed the recipe.  It's a keeper!

Yum!  I realized half way through that my grill wasn't working so I ended up broiling them after boiling.  All I had was cheapo barbeque sauce so I doctered it up with some ketchup, mustard, and brown sugar.  DELISH!

These ribs were excellent I will not make any other way again.  I make my own BBQ sauce, watered it down and boiled them. Great method, I used to bake them on low covered for several hours but this is better, could extend the time boiling and still be great.

Great idea, I did not have access to a grill so I browned and seasoned the ribs in the oven for 15 min, then drained the grease out added a full bottle of sweet baby rays barbeque sause, enough to cover the ribs, covered with aluminum foil and cooked for 50 minutes, they fell apart and had so much sweet barbeque flavor.

I'm just giving this 2 stars because it was easy.  I didn't have enought time to use a slow cooker, so I tried this.  Like some other reviewers warned, the meat did come out rather rubbery.  It definitely wasn't the worst I've had, but certainly not the best...

These were quite possibly the best ribs I ever made!  I only used 1 bottle of sauce but I think it would have been thicker with the 2. I also added about 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar & boiled down the sauce after removing the ribs, I basted the ribs liberally while browning them on the grill. They were SO tender & juicy!! Excellent!

My meat-loving husband loves BBQ ribs but as a long-time pescetarian, I have no experience cooking them.  That is, until I tried this recipe. I was pleased with how easy it turned out!  I made one substitution:  instead of using bottled BBQ sauce, I made a batch of homemade. He really enjoyed the ribs.  He suggested that perhaps the boiling step could be reduced by 10min. Other than that, it was a deemed a success. Thank you!

Fantastic and very easy.  I used apple juice and a small amount of water to fill up my pot for the boiling.  Be sure to use Pam or olive oil on grill because the meat will stick and break apart if you don't. Only needed about 12 minutes on the grill rather then the 20 recipe suggests. I put a bowl of the left over sauce on the table so we could spoon onto the meat.  This recipe is great for cooking ahead of time for a large group at a gathering.

O. M. G. !!!  First, the smell of boiling baby back ribs flows through the entire house, then grilling and basting is soooooooo easy.  My daughter and her friends absolutely loved them, and my wife said, "I hope you plan on making these again!"  Tender, juicy, tasty, outstanding!  Sure glad I bought two racks.  We're gonna do it again in a couple of weeks.

This was a excellent method to prepare good, tender ribs.  However, I did not put the BBQ sauce in the pot with the ribs, rather, I just used water to cover, salt, pepper & minced onion to flavor the ribs while simmering/boiling.  Since it was raining, we put the ribs in the oven rather the grill.  That is when I douced the ribs in BBQ sauce and cooked them for 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven.  ~Simple!

I maded these the 1st time according to directions and loved them... today i took some other reviewers advice, and also added a lil something of my own and they are absolutely the best... even better than the 1st time. This time i covered them in apple juice (very nice touch) added garlic, and then for something a little different I added a quarter cup of sliuced jalapenos, and juice.... wow! just the right zest... this will forever be my go to recipe. We had 4 couples over and they were swarming me for the recipe... these are good enough for this years rib cook off!

These are great!  I put mine in the oven as we experienced a lot of rain that day and didn't want to grill.  I think they would've tasted better with that grilled flavor, but they still were wonderful.  Very moist.  I used Famous Dave's Sweet & Saucy BBQ sauce.

I've made ribs a few times but these were delicious!  I actually had four pounds of ribs so I cut them and stacked them in my pan.  I didn't use very much water and my BBQ sauce in the end didn't need very much reducing.  I used a really good bottled BBQ sauce.  Great and easy recipe.

These were great and super easy. I had 3 and 1/2 lbs of ribs so I used a 40 oz. bottle of Kraft hickory smoked bq sauce. Looking forward to eating these again.

These were great - easy to make - and FAST.  no baking in the oven for 2-3 hours and just to get the same result.  Meat was tender and mosist. I will add beer nextime as others have suggested - other than that - DON'T need to change a thing!

These were DELICIOUS! So easy to make, and practically fell off the bone! I did use a foil grill pan to prevent sticking. We made these at a BBQ, so when they were done grilling, we put them back into the BBQ sauce pot to keep warm and  prevent them from drying out. This recipe is a KEEPER!!

this recipe is THE ANSWER when it comes to ribs!  Everyone loved them.  They are perfect!  I added equal parts water and cider vioegar to make enough liquid to cover.  Other than that, didn't change a thing.  Yes, there's a good bit of sauce -- and that's a bad thing??I'll be making these ribs all summer.  Thanks for a great recipe!

This was really good. I think I put too much water into the pot though, but the continuous basting on the grill made it very flavorful. I did simmer the ribs longer on the stove top and the meat was falling off the bone. Excited to try it with country style ribs next time. Also going to try a flavored BBQ sauce. Thanks!

I did not use the onion, and use fresh bbq sauce while grilling. I can't stress enough to let meat sit for 10-15 minutes covered after taking off the grill. My second rib was much juicier than the first one was. I'm not a big rib fan but these were ok.

What a great rib recipe! I made these for our first BBQ of the summer and they were a real hit. We too used some beer in the boiling as some others suggested and they turned out really well. I will be making these again for sure!

Tried these for Easter and they were great. First time ever making ribs and this a great recipe to start with because it's so easy. I didnt however use as much barbecue sauce as is called for and I added a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to the pot as well. They turned out very tender and my 5 year old just cleaned them up

The ribs were ok but they were tough and chewy, not fall off the bone. I’m not sure that the two bottles of bbq sauce is necessary. The flavor did not permeate 
the pork.  Most of the flavor occurred due to basting the ribs while they were on the grill.

I made these just to see how they would turn out. Ok but I could tell they were boiled. I will go back to my method of steaming them. Place seasoned ribs on a rack over an inch of water in a large baking pan. Do not let the racks of ribs touch each other. ( I usually do two racks of baby backs at a time. Make a tent out of foil, making sure not to touch ribs. Cook for exactly 1 hour on 500 degrees. Yes I said 500 degrees. Let cool before removing  foil so the steam doesn’t burn you. You can finish up on the grill with sauce. I also do chicken this way. Usually I use a good rib rub and serve them that way with sauce on the table for those that want it

I ALWAYS look at reviews ( quickly) esp., ribs, because I usually forget how I have made them prior! THIS way was AMAZING! 
OHHH EMMMM GEEEEE, SO Good, TENDER, and ( get this), totally EASY!!!!  We had the Western Style, Pork Ribs, w/ bone. I prefer boneless, but my husband shopped, so I'm no dummy to complain ;-)
** I added about 1/4c. of sugar to my water to sweeten & thicken the sauce. ( Saw that from another review) Trust me, I am NO Betty Crocker! Remember only enough water to cover ribs when cooking. Cooked mine for AT LEAST an hour. 
Finger Lickin Good ! Enjoy.

Don't boil, just bake or smoke them. You boil out the flavor, and you do not need that much BBQ sauce. Just baste as you cook on about 225 degree. Much better!!!!

NEVER, NEVER boil your ribs  Boiling makes them stringy and chewey.  Rub ribs and grill (indirect heat) @'250 degrees for 2 hours.  Baste periodically.  Remove and slice ribs into 3-4 bone sections.  Prepare to wrap each section in foil. While on foil and prior to closing baste heavily.  Wrap ribs and place back on grill (indirect heat) for 1 hour.

Easy and good.  I cooked it a little longer on the stove before moving to the grill and used KC Masterpiece after moving to the grill.  the sauce from the stove was too runny.

I tried this recipe on the very same day that I found it, and my ribs were really good! This is a first for me, as my ribs in the past have been less than stellar :-). I think that parboiling in bbq sauce and using very low heat on the grill are the keys to this recipe. Also, I constantly turned the ribs on the grill (every 5 minutes).

Easy and delicious.  The key is to baste every 5 minutes.  I'm southern, and this reminds me of childhood picnics.

Wonderful recipe!  I was always afraid to try cooking ribs, but recipe is very easy and tastes delicious!  I really like the idea of boiling in the sauce first--that really helps infuse the sauce in the meat.  Thanks for sharing!

Loved how boiling these in the BBQ sauce made them so much more flavorful than the water method.

This is a great way if you want to quickly cook some ribs but boiling them does take away some of the flavour. I use this when I don't have the time to slow cook them in the oven.

This recipe is great, my ribs were so good and fell right off the bone and everybody at the cookout confirmed so. I did take another reviewers suggestion, and added a beer and some brown suger, and I'm sure even if I didn't add those they would of still been just as good. Thanks for the recipe

excellent recipe, I made another 2.5lbs afterward in the same sauce for lunch the next day.  The second set I only barbecued for 15 min because the first set was a touch dry.  The second set was excellent

Phoenix, thank you so much for this recipe.  Absolutely scrumptious!!!  I had two racks of ribs...they both fit perfectly into my electric roaster.  I set it to the highest setting, put the lid on & let it cook for about 4 hours.  We wound up with boneless ribs cuz they all fell out! lol  I poured some of the sauce/water into a saucepan, let it boil for about 20 minutes, hoping that it would thicken up...it did a little bit, but not enough so I added a bottle of sauce to it, basted the ribs & put 'em on the grill to get that bbq flavor.  I will do my ribs this way from now on!!!

It was very good and easy - a little dry, however.  I think you might be better off baking them first instead of boiling.  Still, a very good recipe.

The flavor was great, but the meat was tough. Not sure if the boil time was too long, or if they were grilled too long? I will however, try this again.

I have tried many recipes from allrecipes.com, and so far this has given me the most successful and delicious results! We always make extra for lunches the next day, but the leftovers fell to the power of munchies. Wicked good recipe, sure to please any meat lover. Boiling them in the sauce made all the difference!

Make sure to cook it slow on the bbq pit. We used a small charcoal pit, so it was hard to keep the right balance between heat and flames. But it was great.

Took advice of others and put the boneless country ribs in the slow cooker on low over night. Used 2 jars of BBQ sauce and 1 cup of Hot Garlic Sauce plus the onion to kick it up some. They were absolutely wonderful. No need for salt or pepper.  If you want them brown place them under the broiler for a few but make sure to baste first so they stay moist.

These were Delish! Simple to make. Ribs are the best when off the grill. I brushed mine with bbq sauce while they were on the grill,  rather than the water/bbq mixture!

Easy and awesome! My tip would be to preboil the ribs in water just a bit first to get the initial fat off. I did this and also cooked them in the oven as per the suggestion of another reviewer. Fantastic! I will definitely use this recipe again. Thanks

This was my first attempt at ribs.  My ribs were not falling off the bone as some other reviews said.  But, the method of using the bbq sauce in the boiling water is a good flavorful idea.  If I make ribs again I will try this recipe.

This is a great recipe!  I added beer instead of water and probably boiled them an hour and then put them on the grill on low because I had other stuff on grill for maybe 45 minutes?  I am shocked at how juicy they are.  I have cooked them for 5 hours on low and they are never this good!

AMAZING!! my first attempt at making ribs, and these were beyond restaurant quality! I added a few splashes of vinegar for further tenderizing and the meat fell off the bone...what an excellent recipe! Thank you!

Yummy!  I made as directed with "Bullseye" original bbq sauce and instead of grilling, I baked in a 350 degrees oven, covered, then 15 minutes uncovered.  I skimmed as much fat I could off the top, brought it to a rolling boil, lowered the heat and then took it off the burner to thicken.  I served it next to the ribs.  And next time I'm going to add another onion because my boyfriend liked the carmelized onion!  Thank you for such a good and EASY recipe!

These were the best country ribs that I have ever made!  I've always had a problem with country ribs coming out dry so I decided to try them this way.  I will never go back to the way I used to cook them.  We couldn't eat them up fast enough!  The only thing I did different was rub the ribs with Butt Rub (a bbq seasoning) first before putting them in to cook.

Pretty good the way it stands.  Try boiling the ribs in pineapple juice instead of water.  Yummy.

Excellend, juicy, and will use recipe over and over again. I have used water and beer and the beer gives it a little more distinct flavor (pending on the kind of beer you pour in).   This one will go in the keeper pile of recipes.

These are the best ribs i have ever had!! I did just as the recipe says with the exception of a few additions/omitions. I added 2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 cup of light brown sugar and only used 1 bottle of BBQ sauce. I also reduced the boil down into a mop sauce after I took the ribs out and basted them throughout grilling. These are awesom!!

Really tasty! I only used 1 1/2 bottles of bbq sauce (all I had) but it turned out very good. Only "problem" was the sauce was a little too runny for basting while on the grill. But, I don't think it really needed it. Kids gobbled it up and so did I. Hubby isn't into ribs at all so won't count his vote. ;-)

I gave five stars even though I burnt mine a little, which was probably my fault.  Make sure if the grill is on high heat you don't leave them on one side for too long at all.  The ribs were very tender and good though!  The recipe uses a lot of barbeque sauce which goes to waste...next time I might cut down on how much I put in the pot (maybe 1 bottle total).

WOWEE!!! After I modified it to serve 6, used 5 lbs of pork spareribs and it turned out finger-lickin' good! My husband grilled the ribs BUT did not baste it and it came out very tasty. This recipe is a definite KEEPER for my picky family of 5!

Wow, this is awesome!  I've made this twice and this is now my only recipe for ribs!  Thanks for sharing.

I used one bottle of beer and the rest water to cover.  No salt but added garlic powder.

Cattlemen's BBQ sauce is wonderful in this recipe..

Leftover BBQ sauce is wonderful for BBQ beef sandwiches.

My 1st time trying this recipe, and it is a winner. However, next time I will "tweak" it some and I think I will like it better. Many reviews recommended boiling it longer, but next time I will stick to the 40 minutes, or maybe even go a little less. While I like them to be relatively tender, I also like the dry rub or lightly sauced recipes where they stay attached to the bone. 

I also agree that you need less water, and that some fresh sauce right from the bottle is preferable. Additionally, I added some "ButtRub" to the boil, which is a seasoning that is available at some specialty stores or on line. It is a big winner for ribs- makes a fantastic rub. 

Overall, a very easy and tasty recipe! Thank you!

This was very yummy and easy to make! It actually turned out very tender...easier to cut into than the way we normally make it. The only gripe I have is that the sauce from the pot was not thick enough to baste with. I recommend basting with regular BBQ sauce, and possibly even cutting down the amount of bottles of sauce to simmer the ribs in (1 rather than 2).

These ribs are amazing -- tender and fall of the bone.  I used Baby Back Ribs and also poured in a can of beer.  This is definitely a keeper.  In fact, I'll be making them again this weekend for my parents.

What an easy and great recipe for tender, flavorful country ribs! Everyone in the family loved these. I boiled about 3 1/2 lbs. for about 1 1/2 hrs. Didn't even bother with the grill... the smell was so wonderful we just sat down and ate 'em up!! Thanks so much for a keeper recipe!

This recipe was (finally) what I've been looking for! Even Husband liked the ribs, as did my 5 yr old son. I found that using 1 bottle KC Masterpiece Original and 1 Bottle Sweet Baby Ray's was the perfect blend. Another reviewer pointed out that a lot of the fat was cooked off in the water, this was true, and therefore the only time I've eaten ribs without my stomach giving me grief. I'll make these a lot, thanks!

Thanks for such a great recipe!

These are fabulous.  I will never make ribs any other way.  The first time I made this recipe I used water and the second time I used beer.  Both ways made a wonderful rib. This recipe is more than worth trying.

These turned out just perfectly. I used country style boneless ribs and I boiled them in the sauce for about 40 minutes. I only had to grill them about 10-15 minutes to char them and to add the grilled flavor. They were moist and flavorful. I boiled them in a low sugar BBQ sauce and basted with that sauce so that the sugar in the sauce would not burn on the grill. I served them with a slightly sweeter/different brand BBQ sauce.  They were excellent and I will make this again.

This was a great recipe!  Made it for Memorial Day and the family loved it.  I used genuine spareribs and boiled them for 2 hours and then grilled for 15 minutes.  This will be a favorite.

Excellent!  I usually shy away from ribs as I can never get them quite right.  When I told my teen I was making ribs on the grill tonight he said, "Awwwwww.  Everything always tastes burnt on the grill."  I felt like I was setting myself up for failure before I even began!  This recipe was SO easy and SO quick and SO delicious!  I probably wouldn't use two bottles of sauce next time... but the Sweet Baby Ray's was only 2 for $3 so no big deal.  I used Country style ribs that were on sale for $1.19/lb and I got 4.5 lbs.  Plenty for a family of four!  I usually like my ribs with a thicker, stickier sauce...but these were fantastic!  Thanks!

The best ribs we've ever made - was a big hit on Memorial Day.  Will definitely make these from now on.  Followed the recipe exactly using a combination of Open Pit & Sweet Baby Ray's sauces.  Mmmmmmm good!

I made these yesterday and thought it was very good. Used Sweet Baby Ray's honey barbecue sauce, but I think I might try another flavor. Also, there was so much sauce left over, will probably use only one bottle next time. Very juicy and tender. I added minced garlic and lots of red pepper. Very yummy. Thanks for sharing.

This is the first time I ever had ribs come out perfect! This is the easiest and the only way for me to make ribs from now on. Did as the previous users and added the beer and reduced to 1 bottle of BBQ sauce. Thanks for sharing!

The simplest recipes are the best.  Why complicate greatness?  After cooking over the stove I gave them to my son to baste and turn over the grill.  These came out restaurant quality.  I think extra bbq sauce on the side would've been great, but everyone else devoured them as is.  Thanks for easy tip to grilling an expensive meat that I usually avoid cooking for fear of messing it up!

Great Recipe. The ribs turned out very tender and flavorful. I enjoy garlic so I added a couple to tablespoons of minced garlic into the pot with the other seasoning. Very easy to make. I would note though that using high quality BBQ sauce will probably help enhance the taste further.

YUM! These ribs are so good and so easy to make. I just used water to boil them the second time i made them and they still turned out wonderful. Just one bottle of sauce will work too...then some for dipping! Made twice now and excellent both times! :)

These are just wonderful. Made them several times with rave reviews from friends a family. I Have even taken them straight from the freezer and cooked them on the stove about 2 hours then stuck them in the fridg and finished them off for company the next day. Less stress, more fun at the party!!!!  I also used a can of beer instead of water. YUMMY!

Great idea!  I've cooked country style ribs for 20 years and never thought to par-boil them in bbq sauce.  Instead of water I added a bottle of beer as someone else suggested and took time to reduce the liquid to thicken it for basting.  Excellent!

I made this today for family and everyone loved it. This was my first try at ribs and I would make them again. I used about 5 pounds of ribs but what I think I would try next time would be to buy an additional bottle of the BBQ sauce and baste the ribs with that.  The sauce that we cooked in was very watery and did not cling to the ribs the way I thought they should have.  But the meat just fell off the bones and they were moist and flavorful. 
They had a nice crispy char from the grill.  
I love sharing recipes I've tried and this one I will pass along.   Thanks Tammi for sharing with all of us.

A simple yet wonderful recipe.  My husband liked it as much as the BBQ from his favorite joint.

I used Jack Daniels grilling sauce, our favorite.

I followed the recipe until it said to grill them. Instead of grilling them i put them in the oven & baked them until they reached 190 degrees. They were outstanding. Moist & flavorable. This was my 1st time at cooking ribs. I definitely will try this again. Oh i used country style ribs. I wished i would have remembered to take a picture of the finished  product. I impressed myself for how well they turned.

GREAT recipe to use when cooking country style ribs.  In the past I have had a problem with mine getting too dry.  This recipe is low & slow and there is nothing dry about them.  Also, the last step when saucing and putting back in a low oven gave them the perfect glaze.  This will be my go-to for country style ribs from now on!  Thank you Phoenix33!

I had my doubts, but this worked like a charm.  I used a mix of BBQ Sauce and Mustard for more tang.  Easy and effective.

I have prepared this dish several times. I mainly follow the recipe but have taken to cooking the ribs on my Weber charcoal grill in the cool center with some hardwood chunks in the side charcoal containers.  After 20 minutes in center turning and basting every 5, I move them over the now cooler coals and brown approx. five minutes a side, basting and browning.  My daughter says they're the best ribs she's ever eaten!

Great and simple blueprint for preparing spareribs. I added some other spices and finished them off by baking then in the oven instead of on the grill so I didn't have to go out in the wind and rain. If you need quick and easy this is a good choice!

This recipe was really good. We didn't make ribs a lot because we could never get them to taste as good as when we would order them out in restaurants. Got tired of having the same old thing and though we would give this recipe a try. We will be making these alot more now. We used baby back ribs and only used 1 and 1/2 jars of the barbeque sauce. Next time though I think I'm going to add 5 to 10 minutes to the boiling time. Excellent recipe!

I was at the store and they were running a "buy one get two free" on boneless ribs.  Took out the phone, found this recipe, and picked up the few other ingredients needed to make this dish.

A very nice taste, since you can use any flavor of BBQ sauce. 
A lot easier than my old recipe and took a lot less time. However a little secret. Take the ribs as they are cooking on a medium heat grill, pick up each one and dip it into the pot of sauce they were cooked in every time you turn them over. 
So much easier.

I was really hesitant to boil with the BBQ  sauce but went ahead and tried it for a family gathering.  Everybody went on and on about the great ribs.  Will do this from now on.

These were not the good smokey tasting western style ribs that we're used to. Boiling them in watered down BBQ sauce did nothing at all for them. They lacked much in the way of flavor and were not at all fall off the bone tender. Next time I'll listen to my common sense voice and stick to tried and true.

I have always baked my ribs in a low oven before grilling with so-so results. I would have never considered boiling until I tried this recipe. I halved, added beer, otherwise as written, with a small pack of ribs, and wow! Tender meat with a little char from the grill. So good. This is the way to go for country ribs. Thanks for posting.

Great ribs. I modified the preparation, since I did not want to two bottles of BBQ sauce. Boiled the ribs in water with some sauce, about twenty minutes. Then wrapped in aluminum foil soaked with sauce, and baked for 30 minutes. Grilled for about 15 minutes, basted using sauce in the foil. We will do this one again!

This was DELICIOUS! I will make again. I read thru a lot of reviews mostly positive except bobsarah who complain he could tell the ribs had been cooked in water. I have visited several barbecue places & could tell the meat had been boiled first & it was terrible which almost cause me not try. I did add garlic powder & took suggestions of sugar and splash of lemon juice to water & cooked 1 hour. Don't have a grill so I used oven. Found myself eating some of the meat before it made it oven as it very tender. Could have eaten without doing the last step . THIS RECIPE IS A KEEPER. Thanks for sharing

OMG! Sooooo good! We moved to Florida from New York and are trying new recipes. Actually? This is probably the best recipe for ribs so far! Boiling them first makes a big difference. We will be using this recipe from now on.

I made these for our Labor Day, end of summer holiday, and it was pretty tasty, just not quite as flavorful as I had hoped.  My grocery store was out of my "go-to" BBQ sauce, Jack Daniels original, and may be that  was the issue.  But, it certainly was an easy way to fix ribs.  When my spouse  saw I was boiling the the ribs, she made it known, she didn't want "wet" ribs.  I assured her they wouldn't be, and after we finished eating, all she could say was, "those were delicious!".  As the sauce was reducing during the broiler stage (too hot at 96 degrees to fire up the grill!) I stirred in some Cajun spices into the sauce mix, (Sweet Baby Ray's honey chipotle), and that helped pick it up for me, but it just wasn't five star for me.

Loved these tender, flavorful ribs!  Before final roasting in oven,  I sprinkled both sides with " Big James Pork Rub" since my husband loves his ribs dry. Only took 15 minutes at 350 to crisp them up to perfection!

Delicious. Boiled 40 min. Oven 30 min in foil, open foil and 15 min so that ribs are glazed with sauce. Boiling in the barbecue sauce with just about a cup of water to cover ribs makes all the difference. I think they would also be good finishing on grill instead of oven, but I'll have yo wait for warmer weather:)

Wonderful recipe for camping. The night before our camping trip, I completed step 1. I stored the ribs, still in the sauce, until our supper the next night.  To keep our grill clean, I placed the ribs in foil and cooked them for 20 minute as the recipe suggests. It was terrific and a really easy supper for camping.

I made this with boneless country ribs, the only choice available. I think I would make this again with bone-in ribs (country style). My guests raved about them, but I thought they were a little dry; again, I think because they did not have the extra flavor that bones give to ribs. Otherwise, I made the recipe as is.

It was delicious but I think I boiled it too fast and meat was a tad tough. Will make again and make sure I keep it at a low boil.

Great recipe. I am not a huge meat eater but I like boneless country ribs because they are so lean.  I followed the exact directions and really enjoyed these ribs.My only issue was that I had the grill temperature too high and the ribs dried out, even though I basted them. Operator error! But I will add these to my cooking repertoire. Thanks for sharing this simple and delicious recipe.

We enjoyed these ribs very much!  I had to use boneless country style as that's all I had, but they came out great!  Slow cooking/simmering in a good BBQ sauce is the way to go ( we used Sweet Baby Rays Original).  Thank you for a keeper recipe.....Kim E

This was delicious.  I finished them under the broiler since our grill is out of commission, and they were extremely tasty.  And with pork spareribs on sale at the grocery store it was an inexpensive meal!  Great bang for the buck.

This was very good.  I had used 3 1/2 lbs of country ribs and forgotten to account for it with the barbecue sauce.  If I had done exactly the way the recipe called for, it'd probably be 5 stars!  Even with my error, it was very good and moist.  I will definitely use this again.

Okay so after 30 minutes at a LOW BOIL the meat was cooked all the way. Soooo check your meat! To be honest i just simmered it even, and it still cooked in half an hour, so cooked I couldn't even put it on the grill because any more would have over cooked it.

This was simply an outstanding recipe. I also did the boil/oven combo. 350 degrees in the oven, 15 minutes covered, 15 uncovered. My boyfriend LOVED it.

these were very good, tasty, and not dry at all - but how could they be when spareribs have so much fat!  i gave this only 4 stars because i'd make changes if i made this again...reserve some of the bbq sauce for basting, instead of adding water to cover the ribs add broth, apple juice, pineapple juice, or something besides water.  because of the water it changes the sauce and even thickening it doesnt make it near as good as it originally was.  i did have to bake this in the oven cos of the windstorm we continually have in MN - i put it in a roasting pan, covered it with bbq sauce, covered with the lid, and cooked it at 350 degrees for 30 minutes.  another reason i gave it 4 stars is because i personally prefer the "barbeque ribs" recipe by SEEsign on this website.  dont get me wrong, the ribs were still very good, just not the best.  thanks for the recipe!

Wow is this ever an easy and delicious recipe! I can't believe how simple it is and how great the results. I used spare ribs because that's what I had. I couldn't get to the grill, so I threw them in a pan and let them cook awhile, then broiled them with some more sauce over the top. You just have to make these! I only changed things up due to my circumstances that evening, the results will be fantastic no matter what you do!

Boiled the ribs for aprox. 45 minutes in a pot of 1/2 water & 1/2 beer w/2 cloves of garlic, 1/2 an onion (qtr), salt, pepper & a few dashes of soy sauce.  We then grilled them for an additional 30 minutes, coating heavy with bbq sauce on each turn.  We ended up with very tender ribs that nearly fell into the coals.  They were all totally gone at the end of the meal.

This is a really good recipe. Next time I will add a bit more spicy heat. The ribs were very tender and flavorful. I like this method of preparing the ribs. Will also be trying this with chicken.

I've made these ribs a dozen or so times now and I think I've finally perfected my technique. 1) These ribs are only as good as the BBQ sauce you choose to use. For me up here in Calgary (home of the Stampede... YAHOO), it's got to be Cattle Boyz. 2) I only use about half of the BBQ sauce required to boil. I always found that because the fat rendered down, no amount of boiling after removing the ribs left me with a sauce I'd want to baste with. 3) I let the ribs sit in the other half of the BBQ sauce for at least 30 minutes before grilling and baste & turn often when on the grill. These ribs always get devoured in a hurry with lots of props to the chef ;)

This receipe was GREAT!  I used kc masterpiece added sugar and little lemon juice and boiled the country pork ribs for 40 minutes. After I boiled them I put them in the oven for 30 mins and then under the broiler for 10 mins because it was raining outside and I couldn't get to the BBQ grill, the meat was sooooo tender, I barely had to use a fork and it fell apart.  Will Definitely make this recipe again and again and again!

when the country style pork ribs are on sale at food lion, i stock up for this recipe! i've made these several times...one time, i accidently let them boil in the pot for too long (it was like, a little over an hour) and i worried that i ruined them, but THEY WERE SO TENDER, THEY FELL APART.  Literally, the bones slip right out of them and they shred a little, but we love them that way.  Now i always boil them for a little over an hour.

Also, of course the bbq sauce can make or break this recipe -so far, i like Sweet Baby Ray's the best!

Great simple recipe! It tastes like you've been cooking 'em all day. I've made it a few times now with rave reviews every time. The only thing I do different is add a large bottle of Newcastle Brown Ale. Oh and make sure you use good-quality BBQ sauce - no cheap stuff!

These turned out very nice. I used boneless ribs, and I suspect they spent a bit too long on the grill as they got a bit dry...but the flavor was fabulous!

Wow! These were amazing!! My first time ever making ribs and I don't think I have had better ribs anywhere. Followed recipe exactly except I only had two bottles of sauce and I had 4 lbs. of ribs. Used one bottle while I boiled them and used the other to baste ribs while they were on the grill. Turned out fantastic!!!

Our guests enjoyed their ribs. It was my 1st time using this recipe. I followed some other tips & used only 1 bottle of KC Masterpiece hot & spicy sauce, some beer as well, chopped garlic, added paprika & seasoned salt instead in the bbq broth. Brought the broth to a boil then simmered the ribs for 1 hr. Basted the ribs on the grill for about 15-20 mins.

FANTASTIC!  Memphians are very pickey about their BBQ, we could talk all night about the virtues of dry BBQ over wet ~grin~  We're picky, but these are GREAT! I added a strawberry wine cooler to the mix and boiled for 1 hour.  

In the last 15 minutes I added some Season Salt.  Once I put the ribs in the browning dish for the over, I cooked down the boiling mixture until it was the consistancy of BBQ sauce again...the best BBQ sauce you ever tasted.

The ribs were fall apart tender.  Will definitely make these again.....next week!

Would definately do this way again. I've always boiled ribs before cooking why i never thought to add to the water! I added 1/2 water and 1/2 rib/chicken sauce to the pot. Don't know if it changed the way they came out. But my husband definately enjoyed them.

This was the first time I have ever attempted ribs.  These were so simple and AWESOME!  The meat was very tender - as well as tasty.  They taste like something you would order in a B-Que resturant.

I never could do ribs very well. This recipe is awsome! We were responsible for a meal the 2nd day of  for a Nascar tailgate party and had to cook these up a day ahead.  We left them in the sauce/pot in the fridge for 24 hrs until it was our day to cook.  This meal was a hit of the weekend!  Definitely a KEEPER!!  Thanks for sharing this great recipe!

This is a great recipe for ribs. The ribs are so tasty and fall right off the bone due to boiling w/ bbq sauce before grilling. This will be my top Rib recipe.
I broiled these and they were great too.

I have made this with ribs and with the boneless country style ribs and it was great with either and so easy.  The last time I made it, I discovered I was out of barbeque sauce so I had to improvise my own and it worked just as well.

They were good.  Just nothing spectacular.  Definitely tender though.

Cooked them tonight. They turned out really tender and juicy. Next time will try the maple syrup and mixing different bbq sauces. We used KC Masterpiece original. Will use this recipe again.

Love the idea of braising in BBQ sauce. I do add my own sauces while boiling. Thanks!

awesome! Next time I'll try it with the beer as some others have, but this was so easy and delicious! I used Kraft Honey Barbeque sauce (my daughter's favorite).

I thought the picture looked really good so I decided to try it myself. I normally don't have very good success with meat, but this turned out fabulously! I did add some maple syrup to my BBQ sauce (because I like my ribs sweet) and the ribs turned out juicy and tasty! Definately a keeper!

I had 1.75# of pork steak that I wanted to grill, but it usually turns out tough.  Not this time!  I did use beer & add some garlic powder, but other than that followed the recipe.  Super easy & super good!

WOW what AWESOME ribs!! I usually just marinate my ribs with lime juice and garlic pepper, Never again!! I did as one review stated and used a beer instead of water and Sweet Baby Ray's Bar-b-Que sauce!! I didn't time the cooking on the stove, just took them off when they were done. The meat was tender, juicy and simply awesome. I used fresh sauce to baste in the oven, I can't wait to try these on the grill.

WOW!!! I always have trouble getting ribs tender and this recipe is absolutely perfect for tenderness and outstanding flavor! I boiled em and then threw them on the BBQ for 10-15 after coating and they had the most wonderfull glaze. I used Bullseye honey garlic sauce. Terrific, thank you so much!

Very good recipe.  I think I may have not used the right cut of meat or maybe made too much meat, because my ribs were not "fallin' off the bone" done.  I think I will probably cook the meat a little longer than what the recipe called for too.  The flavor was wonderful and it was very easy to prepare.  I will definitely try again.

boneless western ribs worked well with this recipe. i used "heart & soul's" hot barbeque sauce (be careful, it's wonderful but really hot!) & tossed in a large halved garlic clove. thanks tammi!

This is a quick, no fuss recipe. The ribs turned out so wonderfully tender, and the meat simply fell off the bone. This is a great recipe. Recommend it to anyone.

My guest for dinner this weekend is a very particular eater - only certain foods w/certain spices.  He LOVED these as did I. I didn't have time to boil for 40+ minutes but I did boil for approx. 1/2 hour and the ribs were very moist and quick to crisp on the grill. I used Open Pit BBQ sauce and it tasted great.  I also used garlic cloves and garlic salt instead of onions.

Yum, added lots of flavor! I will add a 2nd bottle of bbq sauce to the pot and a lot more garlic.
