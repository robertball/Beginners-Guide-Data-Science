1.25.18  I think most of us have had versions of this dish known by many different names.  I know I’ve made my own “hot dishes” over the years, and I never thought about cooking the macaroni right in the skillet...saved one dirty pan to wash!  It did get a little thick once the mac was cooked, so I added some extra beef broth, but this certainly was quick and easy.  Also, I think this is one of those recipes that you just have to adjust the seaonings to your taste preferences.  I was looking for a little something different, so I did add more soy sauce and felt it needed more of a kick, so more hot sauce as well.  Not sure that I’d make again, but it was OK.

Yes, I agree, we all have a version of this over the years, but we really liked it.  Made same substitution as someone else and used 14 oz. can of diced tomatoes! I am gluten free and found the Publix brand of penne pasta tasted better than so many other rice noodles I've used.  We couldn't taste any difference!!
Just Perfect for us!!

Great recipe! Needed something easy and good for my kids, and this was perfect.  I used canned diced tomatoes instead of cutting my own, and it worked just as well.  Nice!

This is by far the worst recipe I have ever made. I followed the directions to the letter and have never been so disappointed. My wife and I not only could not finish our portions. We, by the way, are Minnesotans.

Made this tonight and my family loved it! Only thing I did different from this recipe was I didn’t add the beef broth. I didn’t want it to be watery, I like it thicker. Other than that it was perfect!!!! Thanks!

I didn't have any Worcestershire sauce, so I added a little bit of steak sauce and more soy sauce. Instead of 1 cup of beef broth, I used a 14 oz can. So far really good!. I think next time, I am going to put a little douse fo sour cream on the top to bring a little cream to it! So far really good!

This was pretty tasty! When I do it again, I might serve with green onions, or some classic chili toppings.
