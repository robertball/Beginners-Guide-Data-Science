I added some grilled sweet bell peppers to the recipe to make it more veg friendly but mainly because I had some in the frig that needed to be used.   I put them on after the meat sauce and before the pepperoni.

Tasted more like a zucchini lasagna.  I liked it but would prefer a higher veggie to meat ratio (I like my vegetables).  Great recipe though!
