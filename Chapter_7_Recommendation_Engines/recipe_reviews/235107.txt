Loved this! I cut the recipe down and used rotini pasta. I loved how the brie melted into the pasta. The whole family liked this, which was odd b/c I'm the only one that likes brie in the house. I will def be making this again~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

This is so easy to put together and so very tasty!  Leftovers will be wonderful!  My family loves this!  I served this with Crispy and Tender Baked Chicken Thighs tonight for dinner.  Thanks very much, MB.

We love this dish, hot or (even better) as cold leftovers. I use plenty of fresh basil, good tomatoes and brie and freshly grated parm cheese. Extra garlic as well. Fabulous dish and worthy of 5 stars!

I made this tonight, but I added some quartered kalamata olives to make it even more decadent, and it was a massive success! My husband said it was the first pasta salad he has ever liked, he even got seconds! Highly recommended.

We make this all the time with potato gnocchi instead of the pasta and only marinade for 1 hour.  This is comfort food at it's best.....yummy

Delicious and flexible. Probably used half the amount of brie called for, plus fresh mozzarella. Fresh basil would have kicked it up a notch or two, but sadly only had dried. Used shells which held the melted cheese and marinade perfectly.

I made this recipe and was not a fan. I love Brie cheese but the Brie really overpowered the other ingredients. I used half of the recommended amount and it was still too much. In my opinion, fresh mozzarella would be a better choice that would enhance instead of overpower the other flavors.

Tried this for my daughter-in-law's baby shower because I wanted a dish without mayo. It was good, nothing outstanding.  I didn't find it very flavorful.  If I made it again, I would add some spices.
