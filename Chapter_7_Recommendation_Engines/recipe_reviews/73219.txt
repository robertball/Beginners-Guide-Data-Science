Last night I made this to serve with chicken pot stickers.  Since I also made Green Thai Curry, I left out the hot sauce so I didn't have too many hot things on one menu.  I also used Hellman's mayo.  The sauce is fabulous.  People were practically licking it out of the bowls.

This dip tasted terrible, I made it twice in a row and checked the freshness of my ingredients (everything was fresh). I asked others to try it and we all agreed that there was a lingering vile taste. I tried to fix it by adding garlic, more ginger and sour cream... don't waste your time on this recipe. I don't know how it got rated so high!

Thought this was a really tasty dip with fresh veggies.  Next time I might try half mayo and half sour cream.  Yum!

This was fantastic! It's not one to try if you don't like ginger though. I didn't have the sauce so I substituted white pepper instead.

This was a nice dipping sauce for chicken fingers and carrot and celery sticks.  You'll have to adjust the hot sauce to your taste, I added more to give it a little zing.  It has just a hint of Asian flavor from the soy sauce.  It's sort of a multi-purpose dip that would go with many things.  Now that I've made it and tasted it, I could see it as a dip for fried shrimp, but not served as a dip for boiled shrimp.

Big hit at the party on Saturday.  Really did taste great with shrimp and veggies.  I didn't have a couple of the ingredients, so I had to improvise, but it was fabulous.  Everyone wants the recipe.

This is my all-time favorite dip for fresh veggies!  It's particularly delicious with carrots.  I have to say though that I've never had it or made it with any kind of hot sauce, so you could leave that item out and would still taste wonderful!

I also used Hellman’s mayonnaise. I substituted 2 Tbsp of minced ginger for the dry spice. I used 2 tsps of Chili garlic sauce in place of the habanero sauce because I didn’t have any. I served it with roasted asparagus and sugar snap peas. Everyone loved the dip! I love it because it’s easy to make and can be served with veggies and/or chips.

This was a great change from tartar sauce! The only change was instead of using ground ginger I used a tablespoon of fresh grated ginger.

i thought this was very tasty.. i cut down the ginger to 3/4 tsp since i was worried that it may be overpowering, hence the bad review.. i left out the habanero garlic hot pepper sauce as i didn't have any.. and i subbed 3/4 tsp onion powder for the fresh.. out of personal preference i doubled the soy sauce (low sodium) and the vinegar.. can't wait to make this again.. ty for the recipe

This was really tasty. I left out the hot pepper sauce and added 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil.
