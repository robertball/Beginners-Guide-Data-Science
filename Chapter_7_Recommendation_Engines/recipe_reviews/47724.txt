This is the best friggin' granola this side of the country. I didn't add the oil because I didn't want my granola tasting like olives but this recipe still spanked. Also, don't make granola, set your timer (esp. for 1h and 35 mins!)and then go kick the can for a while unless you want to come back and find your kitchen engulfed in flames. Watch it carefully and stir it up every 5 to 8 minutes. Otherwise, happy toasting.

UPDATE: I've made this many times now and always omit the brown sugar and it's sweet enough for me; I omit the raisins too.  11/03/06: I've been making my own granola for years, but decided to try this on the recommendation of a friend.  This is a wonderful granola!  I used light brown sugar, canola oil, real Canadian maple syrup, 1c kosher coconut (it's natural, unsweetened, & tastes closer to fresh), & in addition to the slivered almonds, I added a cup of whole almonds.  Love almonds!  Sometimes also used golden raisins; they seem to be softer, stay fresh longer.  Thanks so much, Jennifer, for sharing your recipe!

Very good granola! My mom made some for Xmas this pasy year (different recipe)and put them in decorated jars and gave as gifts! The jars leftover, she gave to me, which I used for breakfast (with a little milk...hmmm good). Having run out and wanting more, I found this recipe. I used less coconut and in addition to the REAL maple syrup, I added a couple TBLS of honey.  I also assume that the submitted had intended for almonds to be in the ingrediant list so I just added 1/4c almonds, and then another 1/3c of a halved pecan/walnut mix.  Like another reviewer before me - to ensure that this doesn't burn, stir every 8-10 minutes!! When I pulled out of the oven, I added raisins, crasins, and some dried pineapple. GREAT granola! Very versatile to add what nuts and fruits you want and we are very pleased with the result! Mom = this recipe is almost as good as yours!! Thanks Jennifer for posting!

If I could give this 10 stars I would. I used milled flax seed instead of wheat germ, sliced almonds, and after reading What a Dish's review--a 7 oz can of coconut and 4 T of brown sugar, and I used her idea to put into 2 pans in the oven. I will add some whole almonds next time per LadyJayPee's suggestion. I used regular pancake syrup (sorry! didn't have the "real stuff") and a spoonful of cane syrup (like a mild molasses). I left mine in the oven a little too long, because it wasn't getting crisp, before I realized that it crisps up AFTER you take it out of the oven. It is delicious and different than any cereal I've ever had, and I can't stop nibbling on it!

I heard a lot about this granola, and I must say it lived up to the hype!  After reading all the helpful reviews I made a couple of changes to my batch.  I used freshly ground flax seed instead of wheat germ, cut the coconut down to a 7 oz. package, and left out the brown sugar totally.  The brown sugar would have made it cotton candy sweet, in my opinion.  I followed What A Dish's lead and used two baking sheets and, to avoid the burning issue, I nested them on top of an empty sheet before putting them in the oven.  I finished it off with dried cranberries instead of raisins.  This granola is not as oily as some, and I think that is what puts it in the "granola hall of fame".  Thank you, Jennifer (and reviewers), for a recipe my entire family loves.

i have made this a couple times now and absolutly love it! have made it the recipe way then have made it with my own variations. I have added dried cherries, crasins, pumpkin seeds, soy nuts, and  almost any kind of nut thought of. I have used honey instead of the maple syrup. I have put some vanilla and cinnamon in the liquid mixture and heated it along with brown sugar on the stove top and then poured over all the oats and things. Smells absolutly delightful! This is a very versitle recipe and I love it! Thank you for giving me something to run with!

I followed this recipe as written, using dried cherries instead of raisins because I think cherries and almonds are a match made in heaven! - Excellent flavor and very easy to prepare, but only gave 4 stars because there is way too much coconut in this recipe for this self proclaimed coconut lover.  To correct this problem, I made a second batch without any coconut at all, and mixed it together with the overly-coconutty batch which saved the day!  I do like crunchy clumps in my granola, so I loved the suggestion to squeeze together some small clumps before baking.  Be sure to mix this recipe together in a huge bowl (or stock pot).  Also, I baked it in a large (14x17), good quality turkey roaster and stirred every 15-20 minutes.  Next time I'll cut the coconut in half, and I think I'll try adding a touch of vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of cinnamon too (Mmmmmmm I can taste it now).

This is fantastic and so versatile.  I used whole raw almonds because I think slivered would just disappear and I love the bigger crunch of whole almonds.  I also used craisins instead of raisins as a personal preference though I will most likely omit them altogether in the future since the granola is delicious without them.  I and added more wheat germ, and 1/2c. wheat bran for extra fiber and added cinnamon.  I also cut back on coconut and agree with other reviews that it was a good change.  I made this twice in one week and the second time, I used honey in place of the maple syrup.  The taste was very similar and since honey is much less expensive than syrup, I think I will stick to that change in the future.   It is good as a cereal and as a plain snack, but it really shines when eaten with yogurt in my opinion.

This recipe turned out wonderfully for me, though I am still wondering where the almonds are! We toasted in the oven for 45 minutes then stirred gently and returned to oven for another 25 minutes, so not quite as long as recipe recommended. I used only 1/2 a package of coconut in the mix and after toasting added 1/3 cup dried and sweetened cranberries and 1/3 cup of dried banana slices. My daughter is now addicted to this stuff and we plan to try many variations by adding different dried fruit .... next week is tropical granola with dried pineapple and papaya.

I used walnuts and dessicated coconut as that is what I had in the pantry and dried apricots instead of raisins. I didn't bother with the wheatgerm as cooking destroys the nutritional value of it.If you wanted to, you could add the raw wheatgerm at serving time.It was tasty and I will make it again. Thanks

I have been making this granola for a few years now.  My kids LOVE it.  I ALWAYS halve the amount of flaked coconut.   TIP #1: If you don't happen to have sunflower seeds or wheatgerm on hand (I never seem to), don't freak out because seriously...it's great without it.  PLUS it simpler to make and cheaper that way too.  I always double the recipe & put a mixture of corsely chopped almonds (& sometimes hazelnuts) to "my half" (since my kids don't like nuts).   ***TIP #2: I NEVER finger clump the mixture before baking...it doesn't really work that well anyway. I INSTEAD just press the mixture down in the pan with my nands so the whole thing is clumped together!! During the time when you're supposed to turn the mixture over (during baking half-time) I take a spatula & just flip over the "sheet of granola" in sections.  It breaks up on it's own pretty easily and even if there are large chunks at the end of the baking process, oh well...they are easily broken up into smaller pieces if desired ;-)  EVEN BETTER: Store in one of those tupperware-type cereal containers and the big pieces will just break up on their own eventually when you shake out the granola.  **SIDE NOTE:  My friend goes on & on about flax seeds and how good they are for you.  She stayed with me & left a container. I put some in my coffee grinder & used a 1/4 cup in my DOUBLE batch instead of the wheat germ (that I never have anyway!!!!)I can't tell a difference in the taste. So if you're into flax...... :-)  Enjoy

What great granola!  I, too, thought that a whole package of coconut would be way too much, so I put in less than half.  I also just used whole almonds that I roughly chopped.  Used light brown sugar too.  Omitted the raisins.  I used grapeseed oil.  This was a pretty sweet granola, so I may cut back a little on the sugar next time.  I decided to put it on two cookie sheets after about 30 minutes in the oven.  I believe this helped it crisp up and brown just right.  This is so much better than anything store bought!  It's really good with fresh berries and vanilla yogurt.  I would like to try making with apple butter like some other reviewers.

This recipe is a great base for a great granola! Here are the changes I made: Like someone suggested, I added vanilla and cinnamon to the recipe. I also added pecans. Since no one in my family likes raisins, I used dried apples instead. The combination is awesome.

This was my first attempt at making granola and this recipe came out great for me.  I will make some additions to our taste next time.  I was careful not to over bake as other reviews cautioned.  I stired every ten minutes and my granola was perfectly toasted in 60 minutes.

Delicious! I used my own variation of ingredients but the wet ingredients here made for a really nice consistency. I think baking granola so long compromises the texture so I only leave it in the oven for less than an hour.

This was my first try at granola and with a few modifications, I'll keep making it!  I used 1/2 pkg coconut.  I toasted sliced almonds, added walnuts and pecans.  I also added flax seed.  I used apple butter instead of oil.  Next time I will reduce the amount of brown sugar or at least use light brown sugar instead of dark.  Oh yes, I added dried cranberries.  I like my fruit a bit chewy so I added the dried fruit at the beginning.  This recipe is very forgiving of changes.  Thanks for the recipe and for all the other suggestions of the reviewers!

This granola was excellent-but I did/will change a couple of things.  I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut down on the coconut-I used 1 cup and it was fine.  The whole bag would have been way too much!  I also found it to be too sweet for my taste, so will cut down on the brown sugar a bit next time.  I also like my nuts a little more toasted in my granola, and the almonds just didn't toast in this, so next time I will toast them a lightly first.  I also added a little bit of ground flaxseed meal to this near the end.  Also, there is absolutely no issue with burning with the oven set on the directed temperature of 250 degrees-as a matter of fact, at that temperature and stirring every 15 minutes, I had to cook mine an extra 30 minutes to get the granola crisp enough to our liking!  All in all, a great recipe!  Love that maple flavor!

This is a great recipe.  I have made it a couple times and it will become a staple in our house.  If you want it a little clumpier, try adding a small amount of honey.  And Sunmaid's FruitBits are a good substitute if you want more than raisins (amall pieces of apricots, apples, peaches, cherries, raisins, etc.).

I made 1/2 the recipe and used 1 c chopped almonds, which I think was a bit too much, so next time i'll use 3/4 cup. I ommited the coconut and the sunflower seeds because i didn't have any, and also used less oil.
Overall, I think it was yummy; sweet, crunchy and delicious.

This recipe looks fabulous, but I am wondering where the almonds in "Almond Maple Granola" went.  They aren't listed in the ingredients!  I'm bummed!  I'll guess on my own but would love suggestions.

This has a good flavor and is easy to make. I used coconut oil which I think adds depth to the flavor of any granola. This granola didn't really form clusters, though.

Love, Love, Love making my own granola and my recipe is very close to this!  A few additions:  flax seeds, SLIVERED almonds, sesame seeds, and LOTS of cinnamon.  I also add about 1 teaspoon of sea salt and always add my raisins and craisins after I take it out.  Yummo!!  Good in yogurt or with a little milk and heated for a minute in the microwave.

GREAT granola recipe...though, like everyone else, I changed it up a bit. I didn't use coconut or sunflower seeds, cut the total sugar to a little over 1/2 of the recommended amount. I also used 1/3 quick oats and 2/3 old-fashioned oats. To help it get nice and crunchy, I lightly sprinkled the clusters with brown sugar just before baking. 
What a lovely, golden, lightly sweet, and tasty treat!

This was yummy. The kids loved it. The almonds looked a little sparse, so I doubled them. The raisins as well. It could have been cooked longer, I think, and should have been stirred some time in the middle.

I made this recipe using apple sauce instead of oil and added cinnamon.  I also cut the brown sugar down to 2tbsp and used 2tbsp of honey instead of the maple syrup.  I didn't have raisins but i did have a dried fruit mix of cranberries, blueberries and goji berries. i also threw in some chopped dried apricots.  Very good granola!

AWESOME!!!!  I made this last week using the original recipe, but added flax seeds and rice crispies... it was great!  This week I decreased the oil by 1/2 and added  the rest in Honey.  I also added some powdered chai drink mix for flavor(into the maple syrup mixture), and what came out of my oven was YUMMY!!!!  Thanks so much for such a great recipe to build off of!

The first time I made this it I followed the recipe exactly, and it came out WAY too sweet and WAY too crunchy. The second time I made it I used 3/4 cup coconut flakes, cut both the syrup and sugar in half, omitted the salt, and baked it for just 30 mins. I then threw in 1/2 cup of whole almonds along with the raisins. It was PERFECT!!! I've made it many times since and it's a fantastic replacement for store-bought cereal. Highly recommend this recipe!

My family loves this granola.  When I make it, I make a double batch, doubling everything except the coconut.  I also use whole almonds (chopped), walnuts, and sunflower seeds.  For the dried fruit, we like dried cranberries and dried blueberries added to the raisins.  I use unsweetened applesauce in exchange for the oil and have no problems at all with the substitution.  I bake mine in batches in a thin layer on a cookie sheet for about 30 minutes at 350, keeping an eye on it during the last 10 minutes or so.  Once you start eating this, it's hard to stop.  Great!!

This granola is so good! I made it with 1 cup of unsweetened coconut, and substituted some flax seeds for the sunflower seeds. I also used only 2 Tbs. of brown sugar, and it was still nice and sweet! I added 1 tsp. of vanilla for extra flavor as well. This granola was so crunchy, and it had a really yummy flavor! I will be making it often!

This was my first time making granola. It was AMAZING. I halved the recipe because I wanted the granola for parfait topping for just my husband and I. I didn't put the coconut, since my husband doesn't like it. I used 1 TSB less brown sugar required, but added 1/2 TSB of honey. I also added 1/2 tsp of vanilla and sprinkled cinnamon into the mix before baking. It's soooo yummy! Thanks!

I thought this was a great recipe! I did not have wheat germ so did not use it, also deleted sunflower seeds (personal preference). I used about 1/2 the called for brown sugar as other reviews said it was too sweet and it tasted great. I added cinnamon and am now baking a batch with small chunks of Granny Smith apples- yummy!

This recipe is GREAT!  I updated it and don't use raisens (not a fan), but instead use dried cranberries and blueberries.  It makes the granola look beautiful.  I have given it out as gifts on many occasions and every one begs for the recipe.

This is a good recipe and can be easily made with organic ingredients without doing culinary summersaults.  I've made it more than once with good results whether "by the book" or changing it slightly.  Adding vanilla gives it a nice flavor.  Doubling it takes it a bit longer in the oven, but will give the "clumps" that some enjoy. This can easily become "gourmet" muselix by adding rice crispies, corn flakes & bran flakes (which can all be found easily in organic stores) along with the raisins after baking.  It tastes very much like the expensive stuff but at half the cost. Kids enjoy it, hubby liked it once I dropped the sunflower seeds, and our dog waits for the crumbs to fall.  An added joy: my 2- and 4-year-olds enjoy helping mix the dry ingredients with their hands at the kitchen table - all those different textures!

I thought that this was a great granola.....better than most store bought kinds.  I used sliced almonds and light brown sugar, as well as dried cranberries in addition to the rasins and I cut back on the coconut too.  I kept everything else the same.  Next time I will try it with applebutter in place of the oil.  I had never made granola before, thanks What A Dish for the recommendation!

My only criticism is I couldn't get it to clump at all.  Perhaps because I used apple butter instead of oil. I added some dark corn syrup but that didn't help much.  Next time I will bake in a thin layer - I only had a cake pan, but it was too thick and took longer to bake.  Great recipe.

Made a few changes to suit our taste and it was wonderful.  I didn't like making granola with oil so I substituted apple butter.  Worked wonderfully with a flavor that enhanced the nuts and brown sugar.  Only added 1/2 of the coconut and that was plenty.  I had walnuts, but I'm going to use pecans next time.  I did NOT add raisins to the mix as they would get hard - preferred to put them on when we ate it but the recipe really didn't need more.  This needs stirred every 15 min.  Stayed crisp and crunchy in milk.  A keeper!

I love coconut so I loved this recipe.  If you don't love coconut you might want to cut back on the amount in this recipe.  I did add 1/2 cup of slivered almonds since they weren't in the recipe list.  This is great granola and I will make it again!

I omitted the sunflower seeds and I subtracted a teaspoon of water and added a teaspoon of vanilla. Mine took just over an hour to crisp up, stirred every fifteen minutes. I left it out overnight to cool. I did not add raisins, I chose instead to sprinkle chopped strawberries over the top right before serving. We all really loved this granola--it's delicious!

I am a broke college student. Real maple syrup is really expensive, so I made this using 3 cups oats, 6 tablespoons honey, oil, water, salt, almonds. I was so afraid I was going to burn it, that I took it out of the oven every 15 minutes and stirred. When I took it out, while it was still cooling, I tossed in 1 tablespoon of brown sugar....this stuff is great...and super cheap to make. Thank you! :)

I will definitely be making this again! Great with yogurt or milk in the morning! I didn't have sunflower seeds or the full amount of almonds so I did almonds, walnuts and pecans. 

On my second time around, I used coconut oil instead of veggie oil and it was good! And I think much healthier :)

Oh my this is sooo good! It smells heavenly when baking too. Used ground flax seen in place of the wheat bran, decreased the brown sugar to 2 tbsp as suggested by others, next time will omit all together. Also added a tsp of vanilla extract the the liquids. Amazing recipe, thanks:)

i used agave instead of the brown sugar, and used flax instead of wheat germ (ran out of wheat germ).  i used whole almonds, but cut them in half (across the middles, so they were like almond chunks) and also added chopped walnuts.  I also used dried cranberries instead of raisins.
I also added a tablespoon of vanilla.
Excellent recipe, thanks for posting !

I made this recipe as written with the one exception of using ground flax seed instead of wheat germ. It is fantastic as written. I didn't find the amount of coconut, brown sugar, or maple syrup too sweet. I didn't find the amount of oil excessive. However, I will give different variations of this recipe a try, such as the addition of cinnamon & vanilla, as well as the substitution of other dried fruit, such as dried cherries, instead of the raisins. Thanks for the awesome recipe! P.S. This was my first time making granola and this recipe was very easy to make!

Absolutely great.  I used some different nuts and removed the coconut (I hate the stuff).  It was absolutely awesome.

DELICIOUS granola. I will never go back to store bought! This recipe was so easy to make too! I substituted flax seed for the wheat germ, and added in 1 Tbsp cinnamon and 1 tsp vanilla extract.  I also just baked craisins in with the the granola (by accident), but they turned out just fine this way, maybe just  a little chewier. I also chopped my almonds rather than using pre sliced almonds, the small chunks add a good crunch. SO YUMMY!!!

This was the best! My husband wanted granola but the prices in the grocery store were ridiculous.  I used 1/2 coconut, 2 tbsp splenda brown sugar and added 1/4 flax seeds.  Loved it!

This was my first experience making granola, IT was great, I did add more  pecans and walnuts and used sliced almonds.  I also took someone elses advice and cut back on brown sugar to half the amt.and half amt. of coconut.  I did add some cinnamon and vanilla. It was yummie .

Best granola ever.  I used a bit more than a cup total of pecans, walnuts, and almonds and smashed them all up with a hammer in a Ziploc bag.  I also only used a heaping cup of coconut and 2 T of brown sugar.  It really needed no more than that, in fact next time I may only use 1 T of the sugar.  The second time I made it I added some honey to it as well, and lots of cinnamon.  Instead of raisins, I added Craisins in the last 10 min of baking.  Mmmm.  It was absolutely wonderful.  Great in milk.  I will keep this recipe and use it again and again.  Thank you!!

This was good but it wasn't what I had anticipated. I was hoping that I would be able to have clumps, but the mixture wouldn't hold together for me.??

Very good flavor.  I could always use more maple syrup though - I live in New England!  We add it to vanilla yogurt or ice cream now.

I hadn't made granola before and now I am so glad I tried this recipe. My teenage girls and hubby absolutely LOVED it, as did I. I added 1 tsp of cinnamon and left out the wheat germ. I only used 1 cup of the coconut and it was perfect for our tastes. My girls took some to school and it was a big hit in the lunch room. Thanks so much for sharing the recipe!

FANTASTIC!  I love granola and wanted to try this one out and I have to say it's great!  Per some other suggestions, I used all apple butter instead of the oil (great idea and I can't imagine using oil now!), cut down on the brown sugar and coconut by about half and did end up using whole almonds chopped in half.  I also used a combination of sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds - yummy!  This recipe is open to many variations, would be great as well with cranberries instead of raisins.  Great to nibble on or add in yogurt.  Thanks, it's definitely a keeper!

This recipe went over really well with my family when they came to visit for Christmas. Everyone loved it! It's not too sweet and really delicious! I did cut back on the coconut and only used a 7 oz. package, which was still plenty. I wouldn't change anything else. Thanks for a great recipe!

Good stuff!  I Added 1/3 c. milled flax and a 1/4 c more oatmeal.  I also substituted the maple syrup for 3 Tbsp honey and 3 Tbsp sorghum.  Instead of sunflower seeds, I used pecans and walnuts.  Delicious!

So tasty! My family loves it! I only used about a cup of coconut rather than the recommended amount (which would have been waaayy too much). I left out the raisins and sunflower seeds. This didn't clump up but stays crispy in milk. A+++ Update 2/2009: I now add in some rice krispies in place of some of the nuts for a "lighter" version and this is still fantastic cereal : )

I followed the recipe to the letter and while it's very good, I'm only giving it 4 stars because it's more toasted coconut than granola.  It doesn't clump like traditional granola either.  It did, however, taste very good! Thanks for the recipe!

This is so yummy!  I made a few changes:  used apple butter instead of oil, only used 1/2 the coconut, and left out the almonds, replaced with walnuts (was out of almonds.)  I had this for breakfast with skim milk, and it was absolutely delicious!  Thanks for the great recipe.

Fabulous granola!  The changes I made were to use sliced almonds rather than slivered, used only 1/2 the coconut, subbed hazelnuts and walnuts for the sunflower seeds, used light brown rather than dark brown sugar, added vanilla, pumpkie pie spice, and cinnamon, and omitted the raisins.  The granola is plenty sweet.  Next time, I may try a little less sugar.  I layered this granola with a pumpkin cream filling for pumpkin parfaits (divine!), served with soymilk for cereal, and ate all by itself, of course.  I did bake it at the recommended 250 F for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 15 minutes or so.  I'll definitely be making this again!

Very good!  Addicting!  I didn't put as much coconut in and added 1/2 cup sliced almonds and it was delicioso!  I would reccomend it to anyone unless they like chunky granola as I could not get it to stay in chunks at all, but that didn't detract from the excellent flavor!

Excellent granola!! I couldn't get it to squeeze into bigger clumps (I think I overdid the small ingredients, like wheat germ and sesame seeds) but the taste was wonderfully crunchy and just sweet enough.  I mixed every 10-15 minutes and didn't notice any burning.  Excellent with cold milk.

This is the base granola recipe I use, from which I modify it slightly. when I remove a dry ingredient I substitute it with another. I use cashews, and do not use the raisins. I also substitute part of the maple and brown sugar  with agave, and use coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and add wheat germ and or flax. I also substitute some of the oat with steel cut oats.

This is hands down the most delicious granola I've ever tasted. Have made this twice, once w/no oil and second time w/ 1 tab. Great both times. Had no burning issues at all, someone's oven must need calibration. Sweetness level,was perfect. Also, added dried craisins and pepitas.

This is ridiculously delicious! I didn't have wheat germ. I used chia seeds. I didn't have sunflower seeds.  I used pecans.  And dried cranberries instead of raisins.  There is so much you can do with this recipe to

I've made this granola with a few variations, and I and my husband are definitely fans- I added less brown sugar, dried cranberries or cherries instead of raisins, and added flaxseed- it's perfect to eat with yogurt because it's not excessively sweet and it's very nutty. Great recipe!

I made this recipe in the recent past and thought i would never find it again, although i chose to add lots of different nuts, the recipe is a 5 star recipe. Amazing seasoning !

I love the flavor of the maple syrup. I halved the recipe and left out the brown sugar and it was still plenty sweet! Did not add sunflower seeds, coconut or raisins for personal tastes reasons. The only thing I was disappointed about was that it did not form delicious clumps or clusters, which is important to me in a granola!

This really is the best granola I have ever had.  I have paid $9 for a bag about half the size of this recipe at my local market and it wasn't as good as this.  I do not use as much of the brown sugar or syrup as the recipe calls for and I only use about 1/4-1/3 of the coconut and it is amazing!

I didn't use coconut or sunflower seeds because i don't like them. To make a lighter version i used splenda brown sugar, and sugar free syrup and it still tasted super yummy. My first time making granola and it turned out perfect!

I make this recipe all the time and it is wonderful.  I change it up by using sweetened dried cranberries or cherries.  I made a batch last night with the cherries and banana chips.  It was wonderful.  I cut down on the coconut to just one cup.

Terrific recipe.  I haven't made my own before but I intend to from now on.  The taste was very good.  I used only 1 cup of flaked coconut, added some chopped pecans for additional crunchiness and used regular raisins, craisins and golden raisins.

This. Was. Amazing! It was my first ever attempt at making granola and I'm so glad I did! I'll never go back to the lifeless box stuff again! I followed the recipe more or less as printed. I used less coconut, as I only had half a bag anyway (This is a great recipe for using up those leftover nuts, seeds and coconut!) and I substituted pecans for the sunflower seeds. I also added a teaspoon of vanilla and some cinnamon to the wet ingredients. Like other reviewers have noted, it is a bit sweet, so I will most likely adjust the next batch, but it's really awesome as a yogurt mix in. I'm also going to experiment with cutting the recipe with corn or bran flakes to make my own breakfast cereal since DH burns through cereal like there's going to be an embargo.

I've been combing the stores for low sugar granola to no avail. So I decided to make my own. Using this recipe as my base (it's wonderful), I substituted as follows:
Omitted the coconut cause I'm not a fan and added whole almonds
Used sugar-free maple syrup
Substituted Splenda brown sugar blend

I love this! I sprinkle it on my yogurt for breakfast every day and on my ice cream. Yum.

This was good. I doubled the recipe and it made exactly six quart jars full which I gave as Christmas gifts. 

I substituted walnuts for sunflower seeds and added extra raisins plus dried cranberries. 

The wheat germ didn't really blow my skirt up. I think I'll try something more substantial next time. I also just sloshed some vanilla extract in when mixing. Thanks.

Mmmm this is very good granola!  Because I'd never made granola prior to trying this recipe, I tried to approach this cautiously, based largely on various suggestions that other users made: I reduced the coconut to 7 oz., used whole almonds (raw and unsalted) rather than slivered almonds, replaced the wheat germ with ground flax seed, reduced the oil by half, added a tsp vanilla extract, added a dash of cinnamon, and omitted the raisins.  I also used two baking sheets and tried to stir the mixture every 15 minutes or so.  Definitely check it at intervals, as I found out quickly that it's important to check it every so often, because it begins to darken more rapidly after around the first 25 minutes;  I actually only ended cooking the entire thing for maybe 40-45 minutes.  Anyway, thanks for the great recipe!

I liked this recipe but wanted to make it a bit plainer and eat it just with milk as my morning cereal. I eliminated the seeds, wheat germ, coconut and raisins (don't like them - sorry!) and used only 3 tbsp of brown sugar. I didn't even blanch the almonds - just threw them right in. I baked at 350 degrees for an hour, turning every 15 minutes. I make this once a week and I love it. Thanks for the base recipe. It's definitely a keeper.

Yum!  Using suggestions, I used less coconut and honey instead of maple syrup.  I spread the granola out on two trays, and watched it carefully so I wouldn't overcook it.

My husband loved this a lot. I thought there was too much coconut, so I will cut back next time and maybe add a bit more maple syrup. I could not taste the maple because the coconut over powered it. However, it is a very nice granola and I will be making it again. Thanks for sharing a tasty recipe.

This is so good! I have made it twice--I used pancake syrup the 1st time, and real maple syrup the 2nd time. Real maple syrup is much better, although it is still tasty even with pancake syrup. I also added pecans to the recipe and only used a 7 oz bag coconut.

This is great granola. I've made it countless times. It's great with pecans substituted for the slivered almonds. My mom makes it without any sugar or syrup at all and adds extra dried fruit with the raisins. She cooks it an extra half hour to make it nice and crunchy.

A really fantastic recipe for granola.  I used flax meal instead of sunflower seeds.  My 5-year old said, "now I love granola!" and my 2-year old loved it too. Thanks for the recipe, Jennifer!

IT ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
That is from my 11 year old son.  He just wouldn't wait until it was done.  Every time I pulled it out to stir he had his tester spoon ready.  We really like this one--Thanks

Wonderful!  I love this granola, even though I didn't use all the sugar it said to (I only used 1/4 cup for a double recipe) and did not have any coconut.  It turned out great!

I thought, "Even if this recipe is good, I won't review it because there are already so many good reviews on here.  But, after tasting it I am compelled to write that it is the best granola I've ever had.  Like most others, I halved the coconut and only used 2 tbps. brown sugar, which is plenty sweet.  I added cranberries instead of raisins.  It is so very delectable!!!

Very good. Really liked the maple flavor. The best combination for me is 1/2 the required coconut and 1/2 the brown sugar. Still very sweet. Thanks for the recipe.

Oops this is my first review and I messed up the first time. I made 3 batches of granola tonight, and this one was the only one that turned out well. After I dumped in an entire bag of coconut, I thought that was way too much, so I doubled all the other ingredients and added 1-2 cups of crushed pecans (can't remember which one). It was fabulous, just the right sweetness. I will be giving this one away as Christmas gifts. AWESOME recipe, just use half the coconut! Thanks for the help!

I was expecting this to be clumpier, hence the four stars. I did cook it on two pans & I did cut back on the coconut a bit. I also used golden raisins. I made this into a breakfast parfait for my grandson by layering yogurt (that I flavored w/ vanilla & brown sugar), banana slices & this granola...he loved it! And my hubby was so enticed by my grandson's breakfast the he asked me to make him one too. Thansk Jennifer Scharp!

used sweetened coconut instead of plain on accident. used oat bran instead of wheat germ. Mixed this granola (about 1 cup) with 8 oz plain fat free yougurt and about 1/2 cup of thawed stawberries, cut up. SO GOOD!

Here's what I did to this fabulous recipe and it still was delicious! I chopped whole almonds instead of using slivered. I used only about 4 oz of coconut, for the texture. I used light brown instead of dark brown sugar. I followed another review's recommendation and used apple butter instead of vegetable oil. This recipe is delicious, and it will make your home smell like you've been baking all day!

This is the best tasting granola I have ever had.  It beats any store bought granola too.  The only change I made was to add an extra tablespoon each of the pure maple syrup and the brown sugar.  Be sure to use REAL maple syrup.  This is definitely a keeper.  Great on yogurt, on top of oatmeal, ice cream topper or just to munch on.  One suggestion is to try to clump the granola up with your hands otherwise, it's pretty loose granola, but still delicious!

I only had a 7 oz package of coconut so I used that and added about 6 oz of dried fruit (apricots, craisins, cherries and golden raisins). I only had 1/2 a cup of real maple syrup so I made up the rest with regular syrup and used closer to 3/4 a cup of brown sugar since I like my granola more on the sweeter side. I also added a large spoonful of apricot preserves and some vanilla extract to the syrup mixture and heated it in the microwave for about 2 minutes so it would mix in evenly.  I served this over yogurt and enjoyed it very much.  Thanks Jennifer.

This is terribly addicting stuff.  I added wheat germ and flax seed as well.  I've also doubled it.  I just can't get enough of this recipe.  And it lasts for quite a while.  I didn't have the burning problem but I stirred about every 15 minutes or so.  Great recipe!!!

This is the second time I’ve made it. I made a few changes the second time - only one cup of organic unsweetened coconut flakes, I used coconut oil instead of vegetable oil, and used dried cranberries instead of raisins. I think it came out fantastic.

I made lots of changes and it came out GREAT!  I added 2 teaspoons of maple extract for a stronger maple flavor, added pecans, flax seed, 1 teas cinammon, omitted the brown sugar and added 3 Tbs stevia instead, eliminated the raisins.  I also omitted the wheat germ just because I didn't have any.  Add any kind of nuts or dried fruit that you like. YUMMY!

This is excellent and not as hard, so great for sensitive teeth or those with braces!!!  However, I get the magazine and this is where I found the recipe and it is slightly different?!  Magazine uses 1 (7oz) sweetened shredded coconut (about 2 2/3 cups); 1/2 cup maple syrup, 3 tablespoons dark brown sugar.  Since that is how I made it I will continue to go with that.  Awesome recipe!

I took some other reviewers advice-cut the sugar in half, and used half the oil as well. We also only had 1 cup of coconut and honey (no syrup) in the house, so that is what I put in. It is delicious!!! I kind of want to hide it from the kids so it lasts more than a day.

This is so good I can't keep my hands off of it. It's delicious in yogurt or on ice cream or just as breakfast (or in my case, lunch or supper). The only thing I changed was that instead of oil, I substituted apple butter like another reviewer suggested, and added some walnuts.

I changed this recipe a little bit.  I omitted the coconut and sunflower seeds and used flax seed unstead of wheat germ.  A good overall recipe, but not as sweet as I had hoped for.
