Makes a moist chicken and the skin color is superb from the balsamic dressing. I used a six lb bird like the recipe said and needed less celery and carrots to fill the cavity. Using a wooden spoon to loosen the skin was a great tip though. I will make this again but will salt the cavity first.

Simple ingreidents make this recipe easy and delicious. I had left over fresh sage that added to the dressing.

Made this a couple weeks ago, hubby and daughter loved it. We are fixing to have it tonight as well. Gives meat a great taste,and chicken is very fall off the bone tender.
