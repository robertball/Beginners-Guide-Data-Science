Fantastic dish! The aroma from the kitchen while this was baking was incredible. Don't be afraid to use the vinegar--as long as you're using Balsamic, it won't have a "vinegary" taste!! I added an extra clove of garlic (because we LOVE garlic) and didn't use feta since I didn't have any (just added extra mozzarella). Be sure to let the lasagna rest for at least 25 minutes when you take it out of the oven or else you'll end up with a watery mess. Letting it rest allows the cheese to firm up enough to hold the lasagna together, and allows the veggies and pasta to absorb the juices.

This was so so good!  I was really worried about having lots of extra liquid, but that didnt happen at all.  I used about 2 cups of mozzarella cheese and 1 cup of feta.  I seeded the tomatoes before I put them in which might be why I didnt have lots of excess liquid.  Also, don't put the cheese on top of the lasagna right away, but wait until the last ten minutes.  I let it bake for 35 min then added the top cheese layer and left it for 10 more min.

This is amazing!! Really very good! I used a 9 x 13 inch pan and didnt use the full amount of tomatoes b/c someone mentioned it was too much. I ran out of tomatoes after the very first layer =( I noticed that everyone had the problem of the veggies releasing liquid in the oven so i precooked all the veggies except the spinach. I drizzles the tomatoes with olive oil, diced garlic cloves, salt + pepper and stuck them in the oven for 20 mins. The dish was filled with liquid when i took it out i just picked out the tomatoes with tongs. I fried the zucchini and red onion in some veggie oil for a few mins so they didnt release so much liquid while baking. I also added olives and a yellow pepper to the spinach mixture. Also since i ran out of tomatoes, i used spaghetti sauce for the other layers. It was really good. You can just use some spaghetti sauce and it works just as well as tomatoes. i really loved it. im going to make it again today and i just made this yesterday!!!

This a light, nice twist on lasagna. Good taste, definitely add extra mozza and feta! Just one complaint, the vegetables produced too much liquid for the noodles to absorb despite my cooking it for an hour.  I would recommend extra layers of noodles or perhaps a breadcrumb layer to absorb.  My Neanderthal man was a bit leery due to no meat and so many vegetables; making the dish suspiciously "chick food"... but he tried it and went back for seconds.

Thank you SO much Emily B for this recipe!  In general, a wonderful vegetarian dish, to use up and veggies youve got laying around, or from the garden!

I however, did have pasta sauce- I used Classico's Tomato and Basil. I substituted this for the tomatoes, and just made a thin coating of it on top of the noodles, or whenever called for. Other things i changed, just because it was what i had or needed to use up: Frozen spinach instead of fresh (about half a bag), yellow onion instead of red, 1 whole cup (at least) mozzarella inside the dish itself, and more for topping, 1 whole cup feta, dried basil and dried oregano, spoonful of minced garlic, a fat pinch of fresh thyme, 2 shallots,  just one big glug of balsamic (im not a huge fan) and three glugs of olive oil. 

Also, this fit in a 13x9 pan all the way up to the rim, and i had to end up cooking mine probably for 50 minutes. 

The result is fresh, zesty, and generally attractive. I probably wont use the Thyme next time- thought it came out too overpowering, and i might add more feta to it, just because i love feta. A nice medely, even with the sauce instead of tomatoes- I might try it sauce-less next time, just to see how it turnes out. Good way to get your veggies in, and use them up before they go bad.  

Absolutley excellent, easy, versitile, healthy, vegetarian, main dish!

This is FANTASTIC!! I was leary because it seems like a lot of ingredients. I thought it'd be too complicated for a weeknight meal but it went together very quickly.
I doubled the cheeses as well as the garlic (there's no such thing as too much garlic).
My stepson said " I just learned to love vegetables!" After his 3rd serving.
This is a keeper in my file

YUM!!  I added extra spinach and used all fat free cheese, as well as no oil.  I also added a little bit of tomato sauce between the layers.  This was delicious!!  Very fresh!  The fresh basil really makes this recipe, so don't leave that part out!!  Thanks for the great recipe :)  Great way to get a few serving of vegetables in!

Great recipe! I added more cheese (both Feta & Mozzarella) and I think next time I will use regular lasagna noodles.Â  I am not a fan of the no-cook ones.

This recipe is hard to beat.  This recipe also makes a great pasta bake.  I cook up some whole wheat spiral noodles and tossed it with all the ingredients, then topped it off with mozzarella and feta cheese and baked.

I followed the recipe exactly, (used pasta found in the deli section, not no cook pasta in a box). Everyone commented on how flavourful it was; it was a huge hit.  Hubby had 3 large pieces; I know that I will be making this again.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

Excellent flavor!  Everyone enjoyed this at dinner!  Served it casserole-style using 1 lb. cooked penne and increasing the feta to 1c.

I made these with ziti and they were very good and a healthy alternative to the traditional sauces. It's also good without baking it. I put some diced chicken ini t for my husband. I would make again.

Based on all the reviews that claimed that this dish was too watery, I used thawed, frozen spinach which I squeezed dry instead of the fresh spinach.  I had purchased the Roma tomatoes to make this last week, but life got in the way as it tends to do, and I didn't get around to making this as soon as I'd have liked.  Therefore, half of the tomatoes had passed the point of no-return, so I had to use a couple of cans of diced tomatoes in their place.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe except to use more mozzarella and some asparagus that needed to be used up and this came out wonderfully.  It fit perfectly into a 9 by 9 inch pan and the lasagna held together very well.  My husband was amazed that a meatless, sauceless lasagna could taste so good.  Thanks so much for the recipe, your mom, I'll definitely be making this again.

I love the veggies in this!  I cut back on the cheese and oil to cut down on fat and calories, and I added just a small amount of spaghetti sauce.  This was yummy!

Even the guys liked this dish during the Superbowl party! You must use the larger sized pan (9x13) as others suggested. Spread a can of reduced fat celery soup on the bottom of the pan to prevent the crusting so many spoke of because the dish lacked sauce. Diced and chopped the majority of the veggies, added a red pepper and a mild chili pepper to give it just a bit of warmth. Reduced the balsamic vinegar just a bit as it shouldn't be the theme to the dish in flavor, but just an undercurrent of taste you catch here and there. Certainly will serve it again! So EASY to make!

Tastes great, everyone enjoyed it. didn't really change anything except we did add shredded carrots and we didn't measure the spinach or the cheeses. Used a 9x13 pan, worked great. My only complaint is that I couldn't get it out of the pan without it falling apart

This was a great way to use up my veggies from a local farm. And I was expecting it to turn out good but wow it was a great! It's not your usual lasagna so if you're the type who can't try new things and doesn't like veggies this probably isn't for you. I used one large zuchinni, four medium tomatoes (reg/not plum), one 6oz bag baby spinach, two port. mushrooms, four very small baby eggplants, half a red onion and one green pepper. I chopped all the veggies fairly small and they were perfectly cooked. My zuchinni was thick so I quartered and even sixth'd my slices so they were bite size. The tomatoes were deseeded and diced; not sliced. I used one cup feta and a lil over two cups mozzarella (reserving 3/4c to sprinkle over during last 15m baking). Since there was no sauce I made sure to cover all my noodles (which were softened in hot water so they are partially cooked before baking) so there weren't any crunched edges. I had used a 9x13 pyrex and it was piled very high but did cook down some. I think the balsamic was a great addition and added a wonderful flavor but be sure to use quality vinegar. The cheap stuff doesn't produce a good taste. I baked it for 45min and let it rest for at least 15min. It set perfectly and didn't shed a drop of water. I can't wait to make again. While I'm interested in adding just a bit of sauce next time I'd hate to detract from the balsamic...we'll see. This is a great recipe and I'm really looking forward to leftovers tonight.

Perfect!  To solve the moisture problem cited by other reviewers, I skipped the balsamic vinegar (adding just a dash of cider vinegar instead), dry-roasted about half of the vegetables, and patted the tomatoes dry.  In retrospect, I think omitting the vinegar and drying the tomatoes would have been sufficient without roasting the veggies.  I also added broccoli to the mix.

We really enjoyed this recipe.  I used an 11x7 pan to fit the shape and size of my roasted red pepper lasagna noodles, (that I parboiled).  I didn't have enough fresh tomato so I used a small can of diced tomatoes, too.  I didn't have spinach, just added some summer squash instead.  I was skeptical of adding the balsamic vinegar, but it really made this dish!  I recommend only using high quality vinegar.  Great summer meal!

I loved this lasagna! At first I was skeptical without tomato sauce (thought it would be dry), but this was quite successful. Helped with the insane amount of tomatoes from the garden.

Went over well.  I used regular lasagna and boiled it for only 4 minutes. Used a 9 x 13 pan and it was really full.  It had a lot of liquid, but it was good anyway.

This was one of the most disappointing recipes I have made on this site. The vinegar was overpowering, it was watery, if a tiny piece of noodle wasn't covered it was hard as a rock. It was nearly impossible to stuff it all into a 9x9 dish, too. Needless to say I will not be wasting good veggies on this again.

Fabulous!!  I used a touch of pasta sauce (since I didn't use the no boil noodles and felt like I needed more liquid) and it was divine!  I also added in some sun dried tomatoes to the veggie mix and it was a huge hit at home!  Thanks you for posting!

This was great. My carnivorous husband wants it as a staple! I used fat free feta, low fat mozzarella, and tomato & basil sauce instead of the plum tomatoes. I think next time I'll throw in some eggplant too!

This is a good, simple recipe. I used fat free mozzarella and reduced fat feta. I doubled the amount of mushrooms and added extra spinach. The mushrooms provide a lot of flavor, so you really can't have enough. I didn't have fresh basil, so I used dried basil - next time I'll make a point of going out to get fresh basil. I had to bake mine a bit longer than suggested because the vegetables were not yet tender - around 55 minutes I think. I also used regular lasagna noodles and they worked fine. Next time I'll try adding pasta sauce and artichoke hearts. The nice thing about this recipe is you can really play with the amounts and kinds of filling to tailor it to your own tastes.

This had a wonderful flavor and satisfied my veggie-craving perfectly!  The only changes I made were to use brown rice spiral pasta in place of the lasagne noodles, making it more of a "pasta bake" than a lasagne.  I also used Mediterranean-flavored feta-cheese, mixed all the cheese in at once instead of reserving some for sprinkling, and drizzled additional balsalmic vinegar and a few pinches of sea salt over the final layer of tomatoes.  The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was that it wasn't quite good enough to make my husband forget that it was vegetarian; he ate it, but he wasn't nearly as excited about it as I was.  Next time, I might toss in some hot turkey sausage to appease him.

Very very good, and super flexible in allowing you to use up/change up different veggies. That being said, this in no way even comes close to fitting everything into a 9x9 pan. Even mounding it. It all did cook down but not enough to get inside the Pyrex 8x11 pan I was using. Especially considering the tomato slices need to cover every bit of noodle or those exposed bits won't cook at all. I will gladly make again, fitting everything into a 13x9 pan. Thanks for sharing :)

This was an amazing recipe!  Excellent as leftovers as well.  The only shortcut I made was using canned tomatoes (redicut) instead of fresh.  Prep time was longer than stated for me, since I am very slow at chopping things, but well worth it.  You can play around a lot with this repicpe and it should turn out fine.  This is the best recipe I've found on this site so far.

SO good! Made this last night for my boyfriend and I. Followed the recipe exactly except used more cheese and added some italian seasoned ground turkey we found a King Soopers. Didn't come out watery. Healthy AND satisfying. Thanks for the recipe!

I thought this was so great and would even consider making it for guests. The only problem I had was with the noodles. I used the no cook noodles as recommended and they were so hard even after they were completely done. Will use regular noddles next time.

Very tasty and creative.  I replaced the feta with ricotta salatta (the Italian version of Feta) and used a sweet yellow onion.  This recipe is a great way to use up veggies from the garden, and it is a really good dish to serve for meatless Mondays.

yum, yum, yum.  I wanted a good dinner, but a little lighter on carlories.  Had friends for dinner to try this out on.  It was great.  Unfortunately I boiled the noodles which made the lasagne soupy (my fault).  And, of course I did add at least another cup of mozarella (ok, made more fattening).  Seriously, this was easy to make even with the fresh ingredients! Definitely on my go to list

I made this recipe this evening - I had no zucchini so I used Brussels sprouts.  Any of the noodles that are not covered will not cook.  It was very, very good, though... the possibilities varying the vegetables is endless as long has you use lots of tomatoes. I had no feta so I used mozzarella, Parmesan, and jack cheeses.

Great recipe!  We doubled the recipe to feed 9 people.  Took forever to prepare, cutting up everything into small pieces, but well worth it.  We might try adding in some ground turkey next time for protein.  Also, we didn't have a big enough bowl, so we added in the cheese as we were laying instead... probably means we used more cheese than the orginal recipe.

Being half Sicilian, my bar for pasta dishes is set pretty high. More often than not, I find recipes and restaurant meals to be below the standard I would serve - I can always make much better! But this lasagna is insanely delicious!! I've made it several times, the first as written, then with subsequent tries I used different cheeses and veggies. I've served it to guests and it's always a hit!

Good flavor from the veggies & pasta but I think this would be better w/a different pasta than lasagna, maybe penne, & baked as a casserole. There's nothing to "hold" the layers together, so it ends up as individual ingredients all spread out on your plate. Also, this was a HUGE mound in a 9x13 pan-not sure how it could possibly fit in the smaller pan called for in the recipe. I doubled the cheese but still couldn't taste it at all.

Oh my gosh! I am not the biggest fan of lasagna, so this was my first attempt at making one. I am a total cheesehead so of course I used more than called for: 1 whole cup of feta and 2 cups mozzerella. I still used all the tomatoes, but with each layer I added a thin layer of tomato and basil pasta sauce...yum! The nearby grocery store was out of fresh basil so I used dried, although I'm sure it would be much better with fresh...that is a must next time. To cut down on the juices in the dish, I sauteed my spinach and squeezed out the liquid. I also used regular lasagna noodles instead of the no cook type. There was no way I was going to fit this all into a 9x9 dish, and a 9x13 did the trick. Also, for the people that are wary of balsamic vinegar, DON'T BE! It's not overpowering at all and is a nice complement to the other flavors in the dish. This is most definitly a keeper and I am so glad I tried it:) Thanks for a delicious recipe!

I loved this recipe!!! A great use of fresh garden tomatoes and zucchini. I used fat free feta and lowfat mozzarella and a packet of splenda, and based on 6 servings would be about 6 pts on Weight Watchers. Other than that I made it exactly as written! Excellent!

This is such a garden fresh recipe.  Almost all of the ingredients came right out of our garden.  It was really wonderful.  It looked beautiful in the pan, but it was hard to cut pieces without it coming apart.  I think next time I will try it with rotini and mix together as one big caserole with the cheese layer on top.  Can't wait to make it again.

This is AMAZING!  The BEST lasagna I've ever had.  I had some left over vegetable filling and it made a FANTASTIC salad to compliment the lasagna.  I also used 12 small roma tomatoes and it was the perfect amount.  Next time I'll probably let the tomatoes drain before adding them as there was some extra water in the lasagna.  It didn't affect the taste again.  This is how I will make lasagna from now on.  Perfect for fresh summer vegetables.

What a bummer! I was really excited to use up all those garden fresh veggies. Maybe I made some bad choices and that's why it turned out this way. My result was a watery mess that didn't hold together. I pre-cooked my noodles because I didn't have any no-cook ones. However I didn't decide to cook the noodles until after I had the zucchini, cheese,spinach mix all together, so that sat for about 20 minutes. There was a significant amoutn of liquid at the bottom of that bowl, so I was hoping tht mine would not be watery - boy was I wrong! I seriously had 1/2 inch of water on the bottom of my dish. Maybe if I were to sweat out the zucchini, but still there was nothing in this to make the lasagna stick together. All the tomatoes just slide right off the noddles when I served it. The overall taste was good, but way too much work for the end product. Sorry :(

Love it.. I may add more mushrooms and onion, garlic, and just a pinch more herbs next time. I didnt have any problem with too much liquid I let it set for 15 minutes after baking and it was perfect.

This is my recipe. Thanks everyone for trying it out! I use regular lasagna noodles and I do NOT pre cook them. This is to absorb the liquid from the tomatoes. You will have a watery lasagna and extra dirty dishes if you pre cook. Take a chance!

Do NOT use no-cook pasta.  I used more cheese (is there ever enough cheese?), regular tomatoes from my garden and a mix of greens with the spinach (added a little extra sugar to balance it).

Delicious!  I had reservations about using the no boil noodles, but it turned out perfectly.  Everything was full of flavor, and we didn't even miss having a sauce.  I did add more mozzerella than was called for, but I think it would have been just fine with the perscribed amount.

This is absolutely delicious! Next time I'm going to use more cheese to try to hold everything together. I noticed too that there was quite a lot of liquid, but it wasn't a bad thing. I'd also use a little less balsamic vinegar, but that's just me. 
I will most definitely be making this again!! Very tasty!

Very nice summer variation of lasagna.

A word of advice: do not ignore the recommendation to let it stand for a few minutes after it's ready. I take it out of the oven, cover it with foil, then with a towel and leave it for whole 15 minutes. This way it's still hot but without excessive moisture on the bottom. And this way it also slices nicely.

Excellent, with modifications for what I had on hand. Used low-fat mozzarella cheese, low-fat cottage cheese mixed with an egg, instead of feta. Shredded the zucchini. Didn't have spinach or mushrooms (wish I did) so used finely shredded carrots, celery and finely chopped green peppers. Added dry spices: Italian oregano herbs, basil and then topped dish with thinly sliced green onions & Parmesan cheese. Yummy and satisfying.

As is, the recipe needs a lot of tweaking- good for a base of ideas though- lots of possibilities.  Get creative and use this as your base to build off of.

This was really good but not very filling. The vegetable mixture was so good that it would make a great salad on its own. It seems super tall before you bake it but it cooks down. I am going to double the recipe next time.

This was surprisingly delicious! I left out the mushrooms, feta, and balsamic vinegar. I also used regular cooked lasagna noodles. I layered the rest of the ingredients and baked. It's my new favorite lasagne recipe. I will take this to the next potluck I go to.

This was just okay.  I felt like I was eating panzanella salad and I should have known that the ingredients were really similar to panzanella.  My kids liked eating them so it was a huge plus but I prefer eating panzanella salad over this lasagna.  Also, if you are feeding little ones like mine, it's easier to chop up all the vegetables (especially the tomatoes) so they small and easy to eat.

This was tasty.  I did not have Roma tomatoes, just regular from my garden.  I added some ricotta cheese and I added extra mozzerella and I would add more of both next time. I also added a little chopped red bell pepper. It was a little watery, but it wasn't bothersome.  I think this dish could be fine with any type of pasta.  Just mix everything together and mix with cooked al dente pasta and cover with extra cheese and bake.  My boyfriend doesn't like mushrooms, so I'll have to make it without next time.

I had high hopes, using veggies from the farmers market. I just didn't think that the flavor was there. I could taste the feta, but it wasn't a recipe that came together as more than the sum of all of its parts. Edible, but not delicious. I made it as listed, only slight change was dried oregano (less than fresh)- but I did use the fresh basil.

It was good. Everyone that ate it liked it. Loved having all of the vegetables but, had to add a lot more cheese and some beef. Very different, since it was sauceless, probably won't make it again, but interesting idea.

It was tasty but a little dry, but was at least loaded with vegetables. My quest for the perfect veggie lasagna continues. Also maybe I'm a slowpoke, but it took me way more than 20 minutes to prepare - more like a whole hour.

This was totally yummy and I've still got leftovers!  My only complaints are that I used at 9x13 pan, and not only was it completely full up, but I didn't use all the tomatoes or lasagna noodles.  I can't imagine fitting this much food in a 9x9 dish!  Also, the vinegar leaves a really strong aftertaste.  My roommates had no complaints about the vinegar, so I guess that's just a personal taste issue.  Next time I'll use a little less than 1/4 cup.

DELICIOUS! I took the advice of others and precooked most of the veggies to cut down on the liquid. A little extra work... but well worth it because it came out perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

Very good! I omitted the feta cheese and increased the mozzarella cheese. Added 1 yellow squash. Didn't have the roma tomatoes on hand so substituted 1 14 oz can diced tomatoes.  Next time I will add cheese between the layers.

Excellent variation on the usual lasagna. I also like that it's only a 9x9 - great for singles and smaller households. I had no problems with the no-cook noodles. This lasagna was very juicy so I followed the reccommendations of other reviewers and let it sit for 15+ minutes. The balsamic vinegar is great with these ingredients.

I made this yesterday and it was very tasty. There was a significant amount of water that came out of it so I think if I made it again I would pre-cook the spinach mixture and drain it and also seed the tomatoes to cut down on the moisture content.  The flavours were very good though, regardless.

Absolutely fantastic!  It smelled so good while it was in the oven, and tasted even better when it came out.  My kids LOVED it.  The only feta I had on hand was tomato-basil flavored, and I think it made this dish even more delicious!  I used a little mozzerella on top, too.  It was a HUGE hit, the best tasting lasagna I've ever had!!!

Pretty good, I made this with whole wheat noodles and more cheese.  I squeezed the juice out of the tomatoes before slicing and let the layered lasagne sit overnight before baking.  It didn't come out with too much liquid.  I think it needs a little more flavor though.

As I was adding the balsamic vinegar, I kept thinking, "This is so wrong," but it turned out so right. It didn't look great, but once people tried it, they all asked for the recipe because it was so light and different. Don't be afraid. Add vinegar to your lasagna!

This is one of the best dishes that I've made from this site!  My whole family loved it even the meat-loving, veggie-doubting men in the house.  I didn't have tomatoes so I used some Ragu sauce and didn't have basil so I used Pesto sauce instead of the garlic, oil, basil and vinegar that the recipe calls for.  It was easier and cheaper for me to use what I had on hand it turned out great.  I would highly recommend this.

I didn't have fresh basil, so I substituted pesto sauce for the garlic, basil and oil.  The first day the vinegar taste was a little strong, but days 2 and 3 mellowed and was really good.I didn't miss the sauce a bit!

This recipe is a great idea and had a good general taste, but it had some severe downfalls.  First of all, the vinegar taste was too strong.  I love vinegar, so it was OK with me but my boyfriend hated it and now I have to eat all the leftovers.  Secondly, I think I didn't put enough of the vegetable mixture on the top because the top layer of lasagne didn't cook all the way through.  Next time I will make sure to smother it completely with vegetables.

This recipe is awesome!!  So simple, but yet so tasty.  The only changes I made were using canned diced tomatoes instead of fresh and adding the cheese (used a bit more than 1 cup) 15 min's before it finished baking so it wouldn't be so crispy, and it was kraft tex mex cheese I used.  I have made this several times already in the past few weeks.  Thanks Emily!

This was excellent-my family loves it!  My only change would be to cook a little longer because the noodles were a little undone.  Otherwise, very unique, fresh tasting recipe!

really good!! the only thing that I don't get is how to prevent all the water at the end, very watery. Other than that, I will for sure make this again!

Very vegetable-y. Good if you are a big fan of vegetables. My suggestion if I were to make it again would be use all of the noodles and a little less spinach. Husband didn't care for it, but it was worth a try.

Amazing.  It's so nice that it's a bit healthier, but I did have the urge to eat the whole pan.  Added a bit of spice for the husband

I had to take a hot dish to my daughter's soccer banquet and wanted to take something different.  It was also 95 degrees so I didn't want to take anything too "heavy".  This recipe was perfect and I received rave reviews!  Even the meat loving coach (who took a piece thinking there was meat in it) commented on how good it was!

I really liked this recipe, but my kids did not. I left out the mushrooms (personal preference) and added half a red pepper, chopped. I didn't measure the feta, so I think I added more than 1/2 cup. I used four fairly large roma tomatoes and it was plenty; but for the last layer, make sure that the edges of the pasta arae covered by either tomato or the vegetable mixture so that the pasta doesn't get dried out o the edges.

The flavor was great, but the presentation wasn't so good. There was a ton of liquid in the bottom of the pan. I also had to use a 9x13 dish, as there was no way that it would have fit into a 9x9. I will keep trying to make adjustments to make it work.

I used what I had on hand and it was delicious. I ommitted the oil, sugar, tomato and balsamic since I didnt have them. I used a small amount of pasta sauce and fat free cheese. This was amazing and it will be part of my rotation.

Incredibly delicious and nutritious. I added 1 cup more mozzarella cheese to make it hold together better, and it turned out great, not too cheesy.

Amazing recipe. Was so delicious...even my picky boyfriend loved it, although he said it would be amazing with meat in it. *Sigh* I tried.  I also increased a little bit of everything - especially the cheese, garlic. I would add a little more feta next time as well, even though I doubled to one cup. I didn't have any trouble with the cookless lasagna noodles, but next time I'll try whole wheat.

Made as written. This smelled so good while cooking and it tasted great. I wish it wouldn't have fallen apart when it was dished out, we had to use bowls. Took me longer to chop and prepare everything but I'm a novice! Overall, a great recipe.

Excellent and easy to make!  After reading some of the other reviews, I sauteed most of my veggies beforehand and squeezed the seeds out of my tomatoes before slicing to cut down on liquid.  I used ricotta instead of feta and added diced red peppers, and of course added more cheese.  I think you could really change up the veggies or cheese any way you like, and it would be hard to mess this one up.  It's great!

I know this is supposed to be meatless but I added a pound of diced chicken and it was fantastic! I think it might have helped with the liquid to because we had no problem with there being too much. Thank you!

I served this at a luncheon with coworkers and they loved it!  It is the balsamic vinegar that is "the" flavor! It freezes well too!  I did, however, modify the recipe to eliminate the mushrooms (because of a coworker) and added summer squash instead.

Not so good.  It was definitely edible, and I liked the idea, but something went wrong here- maybe it was the zucchini.  Waaay too much liquid- we were pressing towels into it every time we cut a slice.  I think if I felt like trying it again I would do without it.

This recipe was AWESOME!  My friends loved it and asked for the recipe.  The only thing I did different was I did not use the vinegar and sugar b/c I don't like vinegar.  Great recipe and will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing.

Thank you so much for a healthy guilt-free lasagna!!  This was absolutely perfect and delicious.  I cheated a little and use a thing layer of homemade marinara sauce instead of the tomatoes.  I did add a layer of sliced fresh roma tomatoes on top though.   I also used my favorite fat-free feta cheese and a reduced fat 4 cheese Italian blend in place of the mozzarella.  For the vegetable mixture I followed the recipe exactly and it was wonderful.  The flavors and texture was just incredible!

this dish is really good. very nice texture and blend of flavors. the aroma was wonderful!!! i am starting to be a vegetarian and this dish is such a turn on. my husband hates zucchini but he loved it in this dish. i did not have real basil on hand but i did have crushed basil- powdered basil. so i used that, and i added more cheese and feta cheese to it. evenif id idnt this dish would still be great, i just like lots of cheese!!! i also used minced garlic in the jar not cloved. i was thkn it woul dbe easier fo rme to prepare it since i have a baby that in any time start crying. i cut my spinach up not to fineley and almost for every spice i just tipped in a little more just because that is what i do to every dish. i didnt use olive oil none on hand so i used veggie oil. lool and i didnt use plum tomatoes i used ripe vined one and hydro ones. they were on hand and needed tobe eatened up! 

this recipe is very very good. it willbe added to the best of dishes i like to make. :-)

This was outstanding! I made everything and put it all together the night before. I ended up putting just a little bit of sauce on the bottom of the dish because I was nervous about it sitting over night. Cooked it up the next night and it was great!

I thought it was a good recipe, but a lot of prep work. I did make a couple of changes though, which is why I rated it 4 stars instead of 5. I used regular lasagna noodles, as I do not like the no-boil ones (personal preference). I also did not have feta or balsamic, so I left them out. Only other thing I did a bit different was to saute the veggies (except tomatoes) a few minutes to help them start cooking, and blitzed 3 of the roma tomatoes in my food processor for the top. I also have no idea how that would fit in a 9x9 pan as I used a 9x13 and it was very full. Overall it is a great dish that could be made with a limitless variety of veggies.

I had to make changes due to no lasagna noodles or onion but had macaroni...I didn't precook the mac; just mixed the noodles in with the veggies and cheese. I didn't layer either, so it was more like a veggie bake. I'm not much for noodles but this was way outstanding. My Mom even called to tell me how much she enjoyed it and that is a first (: Oh, and I decided to cook it in a crock-pot

This is one of my Sunday-cook-for-the-week favorites now! The only thing I change is adding more spinach.

One of my favorite recipes and a family favorite. I always add summer squash and some other veggies to really fill it out. Great recipe!

Due to a restrictive diet, I made this recipe without onion, garlic, mushrooms, or the lasagna noodles. Instead, I used the zucchini (sliced thin) as the noodle layers. I must say it came out surprisingly delicious! I cooked mine a little too long and should have removed it from the oven after 30-35 minutes. My dish ended up with too much liquid, but I can only imagine how delicious it would have tasted with the lasagna noodles as the liquid would have soaked into the noodles during cooking (if using no boil or par boiling lasagna noodles). I cannot wait to try this recipe again once I can start eating the ingredients I had to omit!

I didn't follow directions, my mistake. I overcooked the veggies.  I even added extra garlic for my taste and still was just gross.  I usually like balsamic vinegar, but not in this recipe.  
I doubt I will remake this recipe according to directions. No oh well.

Loved this  and had NO spare liquid! Placed thin zucchini slices out on paper towels, used can of garlic, basil, oregano diced tomatoes (draining about 1/2 the juice), omitted mushrooms (not to my liking) and feta (none on hand-substituted shaved Parmesan), everything else the same and it was FANTASTIC!! I served it to surprise company and one raved that he rarely eats vegetables and hated spinach, said he'd eat whatever was left, it was WONDERFUL! Thank YOU!

We loved it!!!  I needed a few extra tomatoes to cover the noodles and skipped the mushrooms since I'm not a big fan.  I used extra zucchini, garlic and cheese since we are BIG fans of these!  Whoever said not to be afraid of the balsamic was right--it didn't make it vinegary, but added a good, subtle flavor that we really enjoyed.  Also, to prevent it from being too liquid-y, I let the tomatoes and zucchini rest on paper towels for a while after slicing and de-seeding the tomatoes.  I also let it rest about 30 minutes before cutting.  A great summertime (or anytime!) dish!

Excellent light lasagna. I followed other reviewers' advice, seeded the tomatoes and added the mozzarella on top 10 minutes before taking it out of the oven. I used a 9x13 dish,  subbed dried herbs for fresh and extra mozzarella for feta based on what I had on hand. Next time I'll be sure to save enough tomatoes for the fourth and final layer, as I ran out too soon and ended up with a slightly crunchy top!

This is so good! I followed the recipe other then adding more onion and garlic and presoaking my noodles for a little while in hot water. The flavor was so good I didn't want to stop eating it.  I let it rest for about 15 minutes after taking  it out of the oven and it sliced up nicely and held together. Thanks for a wonderful recipe!

This is absolutely delicious!! I cut the recipe in half and used a 9X9 glass baking dish. Don't like mushrooms so left them out. I also underestimated the amount of tomato slices I would need and had to cover some of the noodles on the top with a little pasta sauce I had. That is the only thing I changed and it was perfect!! It was a little watery, but it didn't bother me since I left the excess juice behind when I served it. Going to become a regular meal for sure!

This dish smelled and tasted delicious!  I used grape tomatoes rather than roma and mixed them in with the spinach, etc.  However, even after letting it sit for 20 minutes, there was at least a half-inch of liquid in the bottom of the dish (I did use regular lasagna noodles, which may have been part of the problem, but only cooked them partway to begin with).  The exposed noodle edges browned too much and turned rock-hard (and were fed to the dog).  It completely fell apart upon serving, which makes me wonder why it should be made as lasagna.  If I try it again, I'd do as another reviewer suggested and use penne or rotini and serve it as a side dish; it was too light to be a main dish and only made me hungrier.

This recipe was so delicious and refreshing! I halved the amount and only used about 3 ounces of mozzarella at most (didn't have any feta) since my mom isn't a big fan of cheese. I also used dry basil and oregano since I didn't have any fresh. I used the original amount of garlic and zucchini and one big tomato. There was a considerable amount of liquid in the dish even after deseeding the tomatoes and sitting for 25 minutes after it came out of the oven. The liquid really didn't bother me, and I am too lazy to sautee the veggies first next time to remove some of the liquid. The flavor of the balsamic vinegar really brought everything together. I am a fairly petite girl, and I ate half of this lasagna!!! Can't wait to make this again!! Btw, I was able to perfectly fit my half of this recipe into a 7x11 dish.

Amazing. I was afriad of an abundance of liquid and patted my tomatoes with a paper towel before adding them. It came out fantastic. What great flavors! My husband is such a picky eater and I still can't believe we ate the entire dish of lasagna in one sitting!!!! I also added chopped asparagus and it came out absolutely PERFECT!!!! Great recipe!

I loved this recipe. Other than the 'oven ready' noodles not being done at the end (which NEVER are for me!!) it was fantastic. If the noodle thing happens to you, do what I did - add 1/4 cup water, cover with foil and cook another 10-15 minutes.  Thanks!

I love this lasagna! I've made it three times already. Since we don't like cheese, I've left out the feta and only covered the top with mozzarella and it's still great. I also left out balsamic vinegar because I had none and added green peppers and carrots. Delicious!

Great flavor! It was a little wet though. I've never used no bake noodles. They were a little thin to stand up to the weight of the veggies. I may try a double layer next time. But still an AWESOME lasagna!

My husband and I loved it so much we are going to serve it at for dinner club at our house!!  Nice change to typical meat, sauce, etc lasagna.  I followed some of the advice and added a little sauce and added more cheese.  I also learned that next time I need to make more of the spinach mixture if I want to put it in a 9x13 pan.  The top of my lasagna was a little burnt ... anyone know how to avoid that?

After reading the reviews I did add extra cheese which helped with the extra fluid and letting it sit 15 minutes gave it some time to soak the juices back up.  I did double the garlic (yummy) and added some leek to it as well.  This was awesome and my son who is a true meat eater thought it was the best!!  Also I used frozen spinach which worked great, but is different than the recipe and I cooked my noodles to make sure they werent too crunchy.

I liked this a lot.  Unfortunately, I had technical difficulties as this was my first foray into lasagna.  My no-cook noodles came out crispy around the edges!  I attribute that to my own error, though.  Maybe pan size, which was too large.  The taste is fantastic!!  I upped the oregano and garlic a bit with good results.  On top, I put slices of muenster, which melts and bubbles beautifully, but much more quickly than the rest!  So I had to pull off the top layer and let the rest bake.  What a mess :)  I hope your batch goes better than mine did; this one is quite delicious.

Excellent recipe.  I did make a few changes.  I added peppers, for some nice texture.  I substituted a low-fat ricotta for the feta--used about 16oz, and could have used more.  I also substituted a thin layer of crushed tomatoes for the plum tomatoes and was very glad I did because I didn't think the recipe was any too moist.  I had no problem with it being watery.  Finally, I had a dish of extra sauce available on the side, and that came in handy.  I made a 9x13 dish, and found the recipe pretty easy to expand.

This receipe was excellent!  I added about 8 oz of small curd cottage cheese to my cheese mixture, simply because my husband and I love cottage cheese.  I also added 1 sliced squash, which gave it more color and a great taste.  I also added a tbsp of Greek seasoning which really made the vegetables taste even better!  This is in my most favorite recipe box!!! Thank you!

We loved this lasagna.  I have to admit that I did not want to put in the balsamic, but I did anyway and what a fantastic taste.  Like another reviewer said, it really sits lightly in the stomach rather weighing you down like most lasagna dinners.  Thanks for passing this one along.  I think this one will be a frequent meal at our house.

I would agree that extra sauce or additional tomatoes were necessary. The taste itself was wonderful and I can see how there would be a ton of varriations depending on your taste. Will definately make this one again once it starts to cool off this summer. :)

This recipe was amazing! But next time I will definitely add more cheese. As far as lasagnas go, it is a little different from the traditional meat and cheese variety. Because the vegetables were so dominant I might consider using it as a topping for fettucini. Also, the recipe calls for way too many tomatoes.

Pretty good.  I added pesto sauce and spagetti sauce and left out the tomatoes, olive oil, and vinegar.  I'm sorry but, vinegar in lasagna just seems wrong and I was afraid it would turn out awful.  So I chickened out!  Anyway, I wasn't real fond of the no-cook noodles, but my husband and kids ate this up; Hubby says probably the best I ever made.  I think it was the pesto sauce and feta cheese that made this dish.

YUM!  I'm eating this leftover at lunch as I type!  I used whole wheat noodles and halfed the recipe.  It smells (and tastes) soooo good!

I absolutely loved this dish (although I used pasta sauce instead of tomatoes to save money).  The men of the house thought the veggie to noodle ratio was too high, but I disagree.

Really good. Served this for a whole group, and everyone enjoyed it.  I followed what someone else mentioned about using diced tomatos and that was good. Also, if you scale the recipe you don't need "that many" extra noodles, its so full of stuff, it doesn't have more layers.
