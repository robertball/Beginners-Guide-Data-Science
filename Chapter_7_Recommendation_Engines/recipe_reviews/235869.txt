The butter and sugar separated after 10 minutes of stirring. All was going well, it was looking syrup-like ... I turned it down a tiny bit (0.5) and - boom - separated into sludge and melted butter. I am going to try this again and I may revise my rating. I would really like to make roca that uses butter instead of corn syrup so it is worth an experiment or two. With corn syrup, when the sugar mixture is the colour of a brown paper bag, then it is ready. I don't have a candy thermometer to know if it is ready at 350 or to know if it gets there. Round two!.......................When you do it right, this recipe is amazing! So, I learned that butter and sugar can be finicky. The butter should be melted at low heat first. Then add the sugar. Stir it constantly - for realsies - constantly. If your mixture separates, you may be able to save it by taking it off the heat and mixing. If that doesn't work - try adding a spoonful or two of cold water and mixing it to get them to go back together and then gradually adding it back to the heat...............When I did it right, it was so delicious I had to make more because I ate most of it myself. I bought tons of butter and chocolate chips when they were on sale at Thanksgiving, so I am making this for Christmas - a lost batch did not empty my pockets and I felt free to try it out in different ways. The aluminum foil is a great addition and really reduces clean up tremendously. So tasty!

This us the same recipe I make every year for Christmas.   The only thing I do differently is use milk chocolate chip and put about a 1/4 cup of chop almond in the butter and sugar just before I pour it over the chocolate.   My family loves this so I have to make it.

I love to bake. I do it a ton. But trying to get this to the right temperature only lead to it separating very badly. Such a waste for such expensive ingredients :(

This did not turn out for me at all.The butter seperated. The ingredients are too expensive to take a chance on and waste. Not recommended.

Delicious and simple.  I use 12 ounces of good dark chocolate. I also sprinkle on smoked salt. That takes it to a whole 'nother place.

I would make this again. I added 2 tablespoons of light maple syrup and cooked it only to 290 degrees and it turned out beautiful. Very good recipe. I liked the idea of aluminum foil lining the cookie sheet. I sprayed the foil with non stick spray before adding the almond and chocolate...clean up was a breeze!!!

The problem with this recipe is that you can't get to 315f it's to high and seprates or burns.

I had a total fail the first attempt but tried again and reduced the final temp to 294d as recommended by some videos online. I added a 1/2 cup of the almond bits just before reaching temp so they were throughout the toffee. I also used brown sugar for a deeper toffee taste and color ... Delish!
