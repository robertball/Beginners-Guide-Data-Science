I've made this recipe for years but instead of putting salsa I usually use the jalapeño juice from the can and I also cut some jalapeños and toss them in....it's fabulous and very easy to make!

This was really disappointing. I thought the flavours would be great together, but they weren't. I can't quite put my finger on what was wrong though.

Got mixed reviews on this one.  My sis in law loved the creaminess, the rest my sister found it so so.  Not likely to prepare it again, not much of a tune dip fan.

I love this simple and tasty tuna dip! It goes well with pretzels, buttery crackers, pita chips, or you can top thin slices of french bread with it and throw on a slice of cucumber! :) Make sure you use a saucy salsa that you love. We use a chunky hot salsa w/ plenty of tomato sauciness to it. This is one of my go-to quick snack recipes since we always have the ingredients on hand. Sometimes, I'll toss in minced onion or parsley flakes or fresh minced red onion to change it up. Thanks for this delightful dip! :)

Thanks Joanne! I used to order an appetizer similar to this at a restaurant where I used to live. I moved two years ago and have not seen it since. I have tried half a dozen times to make it with no success. I was so thrilled to find this recipe, I made it and it was yummy! I love spicy food so next time I make it I will use HOT salsa.

I made this recipe but omitted the salsa. Tastes really good with just the tuna and cream cheese.

This dip was awful. No one in my house is a picky eater and it still wasn't eaten. Waste of a can of tuna and a whole block of cream cheese. The tuna and salsa is just NOT a good flavor combination.

This just wasn't that great. I have had way better tuna dips. Maybe I needed to make some changes, but i didn't really like it. It needed to be thicker, like a cheese ball.

Edible but weird.  I thought because of the great reviews that these flavors would match a lot better.  Nope.... tastes like it sounds.  Tuna?  Try again  :(

I hate tuna, but I made this dip for work. I gave it a try and was impressed. Thanks to this dip, I may have given tuna a second chance. Great recipe.

I tried this recipe and Wow.. So easy and fast.. And taste fabulous. I added a can of drained diced tomatoes to put around the tuna on the serving dish. I used the scoopable tortilla chips and it was great. Next time I will use fresh bakery bread sliced and lightly toasted.. It's more filling.
