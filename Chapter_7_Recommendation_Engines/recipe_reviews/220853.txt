Makes perfect mashed potatoes. I have a cuisinart electric pressure cooker and it only takes 5 minutes on high pressure to get the potatoes soft. I used half the salt, a little more cream, and no pepper. Excellent recipe!

These are very good potatoes although the secret is in the mashing and not the cooking.  I am concerned that the potatoes could easily be over cooked, as you can't check them in the pressure cooker.

Works like a charm.  I used purple potatoes.  They were quite small so I cooked them whole (all about the same size), peeled then mashed.  It is indeed technique and method more than ingredients.  The warm butter and milk are important.  I made half the recipe amount so with my pressure cooker I only needed only 5 minutes from the time I closed it (water already boiling).  I think times vary between cookers.  Thanks for the recipe and tips!

I am not sure if my pressure cooker is different but 30 minutes would cook 3/4" sliced potatoes into oblivion in my cooker... 15 minutes would be more than long enough... I normally quarter my potatoes and they cook through in less than 10 minutes. I'm at high altitude which may make a small difference!

I was a bit rushed when I made these in my Instant Pot. I brought the water to a simmer, rather than a full boil, before adding potatoes and cooked at high pressure for 4 minutes. I had to do a 10 minute natural release instead of a quick release because some of the water started to come out when I tried the quick release. I just waited about 10 minutes and then released the rest of the pressure. Nice fluffy potatoes! Thanks for a great recipe! :)

I made this tonight with red skinned potatoes and they were AWESOME! I didn't add the milk just the butter and only used 2lb sliced but they were great.  Only took 5 minutes and done!

This recipe is great but I can't imagine what 30 minutes of cooking time would do.  That is crazy!  I just made this ith a stove top pressure cooker, .  I set the timer for 5 minutes when the steam was flowing steadily.  I did the rapid release to reduce pressure.  I think I cooked it for at least one minute too long (if not more).  After draining the potatoes, I had to stir back into the hot pot to get the liquid (from overcooking) to evaporate before I could finish the recipe.  Maybe 30 is a typo!  I bet 3 minutes is right.

Agree with Dale and Alice. Thirty minutes was way too long for my pressure cooker. Tried 15 minutes and will go down to 12 for next round. However, I must say, that even at 15 minutes, these were the best mashed potatoes I ever had. I used a can of chicken broth in the bottom of the cooker. Delish and so easy to mash with a fork! Will keep trying until I get time exactly right.

I have to adjust for my own cooker...they were a bit soupy but GOOD.  Less water next time or more potatoes and only 8 minutes in my Gourmia Pressure Cooker. Thank You for this recipe. A favorite for sure.

Good recipe, but for my Fissler pressure cooker, cook time is way too long.  I shortened to 15 min and it was plenty long.  Will try 5 minutes next time and see how that goes.

30 MINUTES MY POTATOES WERE MUCH.  THE 8 MINUTE ON HIGH WORKS PERFECT.  THIS SUCKED, TRIED TO SALVAGE THEM BY ADDING 3 MORE POTATOES...DIDN'T WORK.

I cooked 5# of peeled potatoes for 5 minutes in my pressure  cooker,  and they were perfectly done.  I then drained them and followed one of the crockpot mashed pota to recipes.  They were very good and  hot for our Thanksgiving meal.

These worked beautifully!   Fluffy buttery, and delicious!  I can see adding in some other things to take it to another level, but for mashed potatoes; as is AWESOME!  I love them!
