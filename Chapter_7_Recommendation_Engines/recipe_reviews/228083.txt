I like the recipe but loved it with a few tweaks. I used grapeseed oil instead of olive oil. It's light flavor really made it more light & fluffy & bright white like real mayo. I also added the white pepper, a pinch of sea salt, & a little ground garlic!!! Now this is wonderful & we will make this again!!

I made this for the first time ever making mayonnaise today.  My son and grandson are doing a 60 day Paleo style challenge though the cross-fit gym my son teaches at. I made it for the express reason of using in deviled eggs for Easter lunch.  After tasting it and although good I felt it could be made better so I added a little salt, granulated garlic and optional white pepper.  Just what it needed  to compliment the deviled egg mixture for piping into the egg whites.  My son is going to use the balance to make tuna salad lettuce wraps for my grandsons school lunch. Think of it as a Garlic Aioli spread.  I would make again for sure.

I have made mayonnaise multiple times over the past year, and only with Free Range Eggs. It's the closest thing flavor-wise to the Best Foods (Helmans) mayonnaise out there.  I make this mayo with Avocado oil because I don't care for the green color or intense flavor of the EVOO.  It's very important to have all ingredients at room temperature. First drop a Free Range egg yolk or 2 into an Immersion Blender container and add 1/2 tsp salt to the yolk(s). Just let it sit while you prepare the other ingredients. It works better using just the yolk.  Freeze the whites for other uses.  

An Immersion blender makes the whole process run smoother. In a small bowl/custard cup, combine 1Tbsp fresh lemon juice and 1Tbsp very warm water with 1 tsp Trader Joe's Dijon mustard - it really is the best, (Not dry mustard). Pour onto the egg yolk(s)/salt in container. Blend lightly. Now with Immersion Blender on low slowly add the 1 cup of Avocado oil to container making sure the blades are fully immersed in ingredients. Blend now with high speed spurts till mayo forms - less than 10 seconds. With two egg yolks used and salt added right at the beginning it works 9/10 times.  Julia Childs stressed the importance of the salt and room temps to make everything work.  If it fails, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt and the following spices and make it into a salad dressing: 1/2 tsp dried chives, 1/2 tsp dried parsley, 1/2 tsp dried dill, 1/4 tsp garlic powder, 1/4 tsp onion powder, 1/8 tsp salt

I made it as is except I'm out of dry mustard so I used a splash of prepared brown spicy mustard.  I think the lemon juice was a typo(?) as it tasted like lemon.  Maybe should be 1&1/2 tsp not tablespoons?  I actually saw it as tsp and then added more when I saw tbsp but really thought it was too much (should have followed my instinct).  However, I still gave 4 stars as it was a great texture and didn't mind the extra lemon flavor for my tuna salad since I always add a little lemon juice to that.  Next time I will use 1&1/2 or 2 tsps and I'm sure it will be perfect.  I used an immersion blender instead of my vitamix which I usually use for spreads and dips.  This was much easier than scraping it out of the blender/processor blades when done.  Just tapped it on the side of the bowl a few times and was good to go.

This came out fantastic! My young sons are now in love with it! Thank you so much for this super yummy recipe!

And to the reviewer who had issues with emulsification: try doing it with all the ingredients at room temp. I had similar issues when I first started making my own mayo and that rectified the issue.

I'm allergic to eggs, but I'm also the home cook, so according to my test bunnies, this is pretty good.  Not as salty as commercial mayo, and maybe more lemony, but yummy still.  I just used straight olive oil.  Next time, I'll put 1/2 olive and 1/2 canola oil to lighten it up, and spend the money on real dry mustard instead of ground mustard.  Used farm fresh organic brown egg, so it's nice and rich!

Just starting my second week on the Paleo plan, and wanted to make my own Paleo-friendly mayo (as it is difficult to find and also tres expensive). This is amazing, delicious and versatile! Thank you so much for creating this and also to the first two reviewers for their helpful suggestions!

I followed the recipe exactly and it was great. I like my avacado on the spicy side, so I added some chile lime seasoning and garlic powder. I love this mayo with tuna.
