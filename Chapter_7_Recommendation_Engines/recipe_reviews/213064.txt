I love this recipe!! And, I always add some red wine vinegar (like 1/4 cup). It makes the pepper a little bit more sour which helps to bring up the appetite and acts as a great appetizer.

Just like my nonna and mother made, fresh from their gardens, often served at the table as part of the meal.  As did the submitterâ€™s arugula and beans dish, this evoked fond and special memories.  Consider that high praise.

Fabulous recipe! I can't think of one thing to change! (oops, I did leave out the salt and pepper), really saw no need for those.

YUM!  I had an abundance of peppers and more than enough stuffed peppers in the freezer so I tried this recipe.  It was a first for me and so easy to do.  I loved the way they swelled and peeled.  I can't wait to have them on pizza.  Thank you KIMSCOOKINGNOW for sharing your recipe!

These peppers roasted up beautifully. Used only red peppers. Substituted dried basil for fresh. Popped them in a paper bag which for me worked just as well. The skins peeled away nicely leaving just the lovely flesh. Used them on pizza and in fajitas. Thanks Kim~

A classic dish my Italian MIL taught me to make- just this way.  I used fresh and dry herbs, a little parsley and only red peppers like my MIL did.  I did use less olive oil than suggested.  I roasted the pepper right on my gas range but be sure to line the stove top around the burners if you do - I have those little foil burner pans just for this puropse.  So delicious on a roast pork or chicken cuttlet sandwich. Thanks for posting your recipe!

All guests I serve this to ask for the recipe.   I found they last more than 5 days in the fridge.  Great to have with BBQ

This is exactly how my Nana made peppers. Loved the sandwiches. Now I buy a bushel of multi colored peppers (when on sale) and do them when we are camping. I ration them so I can enjoy a few thru the entire winter... and remember my Nana.

had a few leftover peppers so decided to roast them.  roasted them on the gas grill then let the  cool in a paper bag.  just put the herbs on top of the same
peeled and sliced peppers then added olive oil.  used my hands to mix thoroughly.  the only thin I added was some grated orange peel.  this really added to the flavor.
