This was a decent-tasting soft and chewy chocolate chip cookie, but I was disappointed that the coffee flavor did not come through.

These were really good!  I didn't have coffee liqueur, so I used some really strong coffee left over from breakfast.  Also, I used semi-sweet chocolate chips, and I left out the cinnamon.  Good flavor and texture.

A good cookie but not my favorite.  The coffee liguor adds a change to the cookie when I want something a little different than the same ole chocolate chip cookie.  I did add a few more tablespoons of the liquor as I didn't think 2-3 TB would be enough.

A soft dough produced a soft and chewy cookie.  From other reviews it seemed the coffee liqueur wasn't apparent anyway, so I thought I'd try another liqueur I don't use often - Tres Leches.  Frankly, I don't know if it would make any difference to the cookie whether you used your liqueur of choice (Frangelico, Amaretto or Bailey's maybe?) or even just milk - or no liquid at all, for that matter, which would result in a sturdier dough.  While maybe not my favorite, it is nonetheless a respectable chocolate chip cookie.

This was a pretty yummy cookie. I took some of the other's advice and increased the amount of coffee/liquor. I actually used 2TBLS strong coffee and 2TBLS Kahlua(didn't have coffee liqour). I also used semi-sweet choc chips, and it was fine, but would use milk choc. chips next time. The subtle coffee and cinnamon flavors were a nice twist on the traditional choc. chip cookie!

I made some minor changes.  Instead of liqueur, I took two tablespoons of freshly, finely ground Ethiopian coffee and mixed it into 2 tablespoons of very hot water and let stand for a few minutes before adding to the batter mix, to bring out more of the coffee taste.  I also supplemented the standard semi-sweet baking chocolate chips (not milk chocolate) with Ghirardelli's 60% Cacao baking chips but only used 2 cups of chips total.  To my taste, this combination provided plenty of coffee as well as deep, chocolate flavor.  I have taste-tested the results on three people so far and the results have been very flavorable.  ;-)  Will definitely make them again with different combinations of coffee and chocolate.

By far, the BEST chocolate chip cookies I've ever made. I never would have thought to add cinnamon, but it's delicious. I barely noticed the coffee flavor, but still really enjoyed these. I'm thinking of adding walnuts next time. I upped the amount of liqueur by a tablespoon (for a total of four) and added a smidgen more flour to compensate for the extra moisture. Can't wait to make these again and experiment with different flavorings! UPDATE: I made these again and halved the cinnamon, which we enjoyed more than with the suggested amount.

My husband says these are the best chocolate chip cookies he has eaten.  He no longer asks for his mother's recipe.  I have used Kahlua and Starbuck's liqueur.  I prefer the Starbuck's.  It tastes richer in this.  I also used a Bourbon-infused vanilla.  I added Hershey's Special Dark Chips and I sub 1/2 wheat flour.

My teenage daughter who has friends who tell her to text them when I bake these.  For real.

Absolutely love these, made almost exactly as written except I only had 2 1/2 cups of milk chocolate chips on hand so I tossed in about a 1/2 cup of left over vanilla chips I also had on hand...tasted wonderful and cleaned out my pantry.  I used Starbucks Creamed Coffee Liquor and it was absolutely heavenly...and I think the creamed coffee went very well wiht the vanilla chips I put in.  Thanks for an awesome recipe, I'll be using this often.

I made these just as written with only one exception. I used expresso flavored chips, rather than chocolate. This is the first year I’ve seen them-made by a company called REX. Everyone loves them-even my mother in law-which is highly unusual!

Really like the idea of a bit of coffee with chocolate chips for slight change of pace.  After reading all the reviews about lack of coffee flavor I dissolved one single serve packet of instant coffee into the coffee liqueur and that was just the right amount for us.

I'd been looking for a good coffee flavored cookie that wasn't chocolate and I think this is it. Soft and chewy, nice flavor, and easy. 

Like most people I made a few changes. I had forgotten my butter was frozen so I ended up melting most of it instead of just softening it. I used leftover brewed coffee from that morning instead of coffee liqueur, and free poured it. I don't know exactly how much I used but I am sure it was more than the recipe called for. Then I added more flour to make up for the extra liquid. I also didn't have many chocolate chips on hand so I added some butterscotch chips too. 

The result was a very cake like cookie. It was a little sweeter than I would like. That may be due to the butterscotch chips. Next time I will do only chocolate chips, and possibly decrease the white sugar a little. 

Overal this was a good cookie for when I have a craving for something coffee flavored or just a little bit different.

Love this recipe! All the people I've given the cookies to absolutely love them. Upon reading some of the comments, I added one extra tablespoon of the coffee liqueur and a bit more flour to the mix and that perfected it.

Great recipe! I didnt have the coffee liquor so i used 2 tablespoons of instant coffee in 1 tablespoon of water. I scooped my cookie dough into 3 tablespoon (each) balls and baked at 325 degrees for 18 minutes. Tip: Try too cook them all in once batch (if u can) cause I notice that the dough dries pretty quick which will produce a cookie ball instead of a flatter cookie.

EDIT: I forgot to add that I used all whole wheat flour. But next time I make this I will use 2 cups whole wheat and 1 cup AP flour. Just cause I hate the taste of whole wheat and I could slightly taste the whole wheat so maybe with the 1 cup of AP flour I wont taste it at all.

tried this recipe out tonight. I used about two cups of semi sweet choc chips and only 1/2 cup of white sugar, as i dont like my cookies overly sweet. also i mixed in a tablespoon of instant coffee with eggs while beating and it gave a nice hint of coffee to compliment the chocolate flavor. next time i might add two tablespoons of instant coffee if i want a more pronounced flavor. will be making these again. I let them cook for 15 mins on convection and they were still tender and moist.

The cookies were awesome.  We made a little twist to the recipe.  At the very end, I added a 1/2 baking cocoa.  Wow!  My three kids, ages 25, 23, & 17 went crazy over them.  Needless to say, I'm now baking my third batch in two weeks.

Lovely. We added coffee instead of liquor and would probably add half the sugar next time as these are very sweet. But they are very nice easy cookies.

I was hoping that these cookies tasted just like Kahlua (used 6 Tbsp.), but I give it 5***** because of the little different flavor it gives compared to regular chocolate chip cookies. I actually like these better. Besides increasing the Kahlua, I also added nuts. Recipe is a keeper.

I took the advice of others and added probably double the amount coffee flavored liquer flavoring. I did not measure chocolate chips because I never do, but is certainly seems like the recipe calls for too many chips. They are very good warm - VERY GOOD. After they cool, they seem to require a hot drink like coffee or tea to really taste wonderful. They are a soft cookie with no crunch so if you want crunch, keep looking!
