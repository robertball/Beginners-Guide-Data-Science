This was an ok potato dish, but not one I can see myself making again.  I used fresh baby bella mushrooms because I'm not a fan of cans, but other than that followed the recipe (sans the green onion; I couldn't see buying them for such a scant amount).  The end result was quite watery (the tomatoes?) and the potatoes weren't quite done, despite a very thin cut.  Mr. LTH thought it was "fine", but I found myself picking out the mozzarella!  THANKS for the recipe!

Take this rating with a grain of salt because I made a lot of changes. I boiled the potatoes in very salty water until al dente before adding to the casserole dish, subbed bacon for prosciutto, used regular onion instead of green, saut√©ed the onion in the bacon grease, and omitted mushrooms. I am glad I boiled the potatoes first. I think this is a nice base recipe that you can change up any way you like. I recommend a lot more seasoning.
