Yummy! I took the advice of some previous reviews and made a few changes...three cloves of garlic, 2 carrots, 2 cans of chicken broth, 2 cans of white beans, 1 box of frozen chopped spinach, no summer savory. Didn't want to buy summer savory for only this recipe so skipped it.  Not sure what I might be missing with skipping that - oh well. I cut up two Roma tomatoes and that wasn't quite enough. Will do 4 next time.  Used had blender to thicken right in the pot so could skip the cooling off step - LOVE the hand blender!! Will definitely make again.  Thanks for the great recipe! And a wonderful web site :)

I just prepared this soup and it was a real hit!  I made the following adjustments: I added 2 chopped red potatoes as well as a can of chopped spinach, as suggested by previous reviewers.  I also added a few shallots to the onion and garlic mixture.  Additionally, I substituted veggie broth (I am a vegetarian).  My husband and I found the flavor and consistency to be excellent.  He asked me specifically to add this to my 'rotation.'  Plus- it's great for those of us with the infamous "I will lose weight" New Year's resolution.  Try it with a crusty multigrain bread- DELICIOUS!

I made a few changes in the recipe since my wife is not a garlic lover.  Since chicken stock comes 4 cips to the container, I used 4 cups of stock, 1/2 half an onion.  I also added an additional can of beans. ( for additional bean taste) and added kale ( just because I had some) instead of savory.  and I dropped the corn.  This made an excellent soup.  I used a hand blender to blend some of the beans and it came out just the right consistency.  This is definitely a top drawer add on to any meal.  Very easy to make and very healthy eating.  I highly recommend.

My husband (who is difficult to impress when it comes to cooking) said this was one of the best dishes I've ever made, so it's prompted me to write my very first review.  I made a bunch of small modifications: - threw in a good handful of fresh thyme (3 whole sprigs and the leaves off of about another 4-5 springs) - used fresh parsley - used a can of white beans and a can of white kidney beans.  I left a little of the juice in the kidney bean can and all the juice in the white bean can - added a can of hominy (no juice) - cut down on the chicken broth to 2 cans (4 cups) since I had the bean juice - used 8 large grape/very small roma tomatoes - added juice from 1/2 lemon at the end It was so flavorful, had lots of healthy veggies and just the right amount of broth!  Perfect for a cold evening. Will definitely make again!

This is tasty, but not quite as satisfying as I had hoped. I doubled the amount of beans as others suggested, but the soup was still rather watery. I like the addition of the tomatoes, but will definatly reduce the amount of liquid in the future.

This soup is AWESOME.  We threw in a handful of barley and a little extra garlic (garlic lovers) but aside from that, it will remain in our family recipes forever and ever.  It is so healthy and so, so delicious. Make it at Christmas!

This is a really tasty soup! It's very fast (as far as soups go) and easy to make. Next time I will use more beans though. I only had 3 cups of chicken broth and so I used 3 cups broth and 1 cup water instead of the 5 cups broth and it was still really good. This would be good with ham or bacon too, if you wanted to add a meat! Will definitely be making this again!

We really enjoyed this soup. I followed some of the other suggestions, added spinach and some potatoes. I also did not add half of the soup to the food processor, I just left it all un-processed. Also added were some butter beans and white kidney beans. Very tasty.

Tasty but it was too watery. Next time I would only blend 1/4 of the soup instead of half. I added a bunch of torn up wheat bread to my bowl to make it thicker. Otherwise pretty tasty.

Really Good!  I took the suggestions of others and used vegitable broth, added more beans (and I mixed it up, northern beans, white kidney and garbanzo beans), potatoes, spinach and extra garlic.  Very good!

AH-MAZ-ING!! I took some tips from other reviewers... 2 cans of beans, 2 carrots, 4 cloves of garlic, subbed vegetable broth, no summer savory but added 3 med. potatoes cubed. I used the hand blender to puree right in the pot, then wen I found it was a bit thin as others mentioned, I added a small spoonful of flour to thicken it up a bit. It was PERFECT! YUM! I will definitely be serving this one again!!

Just made this soup and was very pleased with the outcome!  I didn't let it cook for 2 hours, just boiled on high for about 20 min....long enough to make the veggies tender but still a little crunchy.  I also added sliced kielbasa sausage and a few chopped celery stalks.  My whole family (1 1/2 yr old included) loved it!

Nice hearty soup.  As others suggested, I used 2 carrots and 2 cans of beans.  I used italian seasoning instead of thyme/savory/parsley and 4 cups homemade chicken broth with 2 cups water.  It was bland as written, but after adding salt, black pepper, cumin, and paprika, it turned out good.  I also added a handful of wheat rotini towards the end to make it a little heartier.

For fear of the soup being too sweet, I used only half the amount of corn. I used dry white beans because the can ones in the store had sugar in them. I baked a chichen and had a great meal. for leftovers I added the rest of the chicken into the remaining and served it with french bread, YUMMY!

I loved the blender idea.  I never knew how to get that consistency in my soups.  I used different ingredients and also followed another review and blended only about 1/4 of the soup.  Turned out great.  Thanks.

Great start, though I admit I modified this recipe so much I might as well call it my own now. I sauted 1/2 a white onion, garlic cloves and a tsp of basil in the olive oil. Then added 2 carrots chopped (no corn), then 2 cans of beans, 1 14.5 oz can of no salt diced tomatoes, 4 c of chicken broth and some other spice blends I thought sounded good. Simmered for an hour, pureed and yum! Healthy and easy. Great with grilled cheese

Came out wonderful.  Better the second day.  I didn't have fresh tomatoes so I used a can of crushed tomatoes instead.  Also omitted the corn, two cans of beans not really drained, and added zucchini. Didn't blend but still came out thick.  Served with salad and fresh bread with butter.  Will make this again!

This recipe was very flexible, allowing me to adapt it to what I had on hand: oil/butter, frozen diced peas and carrot, ham, garlic, chicken broth, white beans, orzo pasta, frozen whole tomatoes from our summer garden, thyme, and parsley. I added a little bit more butter for seasoning and it was awesome!

I really LOVED this soup but also made a few changes and followed what a few others have done. Used 3 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 1/2 cps fresh spinach, 2 carrots, used canned whole peeled tomatoes and quartered them, definitely needs 2 cans of white beans. I also used 5 strips of morning star bacon (vegetarian bacon) which really gave it the bacon flavor but still healthy without the grease. I also used hand electric blender only because we were very impatient and didn't want to wait for soup. It turned out absolutely perfect and I think I may puree the rest tomorrow to see how that does. (My daughter loves it that way) Easy, tasty and healthy!

This recipe was wonderful. I did make a few changes. I used a can of seasoned tomatoes, 2 cans of vegetarian broth, 2 cans of white beans, and 4 small cut up red potatoes. After it cooked and I blended half of the soup, I heated it up and added fresh spinach until it wilted. The flavor and consistency was perfect and I will definitely make again.

This was good. Made some changes: add extra can of beans- both cans washed and drained beans first. Lots of extra garlic. Added 28oz can and its juices of diced tomatoes. Half a box chopped spinach. And used only 2 14oz cans of chicken broth. After using a hand blender to puree to thicker consisteny but left some broth I added about 1/2c dry alphabet pasta for the kids. Added a bit o fresh lemon right before serving. Topped with Parmesan cheese in each bowl. Served with fresh bread for dinner. Yum!

Pretty good, particularly for a quick prep soup.  It's a good base and you can take it in so many directions.  I took it into a bit of a spicier direction.  I used homemade chicken stock, added 1 can of white hominy, 1 can of tomatoes, 1 can of white northern beans, 1 can of red kidney beans that were seasoned with cumin and lime, and added a tablespoon of the liquid from canned chipolte peppers with adobo sauce.  Served it with a salad and crusty bread.  Stay cozy!

Great recipe! I add potatoes, kale and substituted the carrots one night with sweet potato. You can really add what you want to it. I make this weekly, my husband loves it and he doesn't eat white beans ever!

5 of the 6 in my family loved this.  Rarely gets better than that!!  Nice switch from chili...nearly all different ingredients, but still a nice, hearty soup.  Since some of my family don't like tomatoes, I used a small can of tomato sauce.

This was very tasty and by blending half of the ingredients, it played a little trick on my mind, making it feel even more filling.

Nummy soup! I loved the extra flavor that the corn brought a nice extra flavor. I followed the recipe exactly and I'm glad I did.

I love this recipe--I make it all the time and freeze the extra.  It's a perfect lunch with a slice of good toast.  I use veggie stock instead of chicken, making it vegetarian, and frozen corn instead of canned (which I think is healthier). I also sometimes used canned diced tomatoes if I don't have fresh, and I never have savory, so I use whatever herbs I have on hand--usually thyme, sage, and/or oregano.  This is very tasty and satisfying, and also low calorie and healthful.

Meh. Don't add corn or carrots if you're someone who likes the flavor of white beans. They distract. Maybe I'm a white bean purist. I like my white bean soup beany and this was not it. I'll not make it again.

on real cold winter days I'd probably add some bacon with the garlic and onions in the beginning.

Just made this baby today! I have a new favorite soup now!  I read the reviews and made some tweaks to the original: 2 cans of beans, 2 carrots, added about 5 ounces of raw baby spinach about 10 minutes before it was done, and the juice of about half a lemon at the end. I also switched out the summer savory (didn't have any in the house) for sage.  Not sure about the comments about it being too thin. I used the called for 5 cups and if it had been any thicker, it could qualify as stew! lol  I also used the immersion mixer but, may have used it a bit too long. No matter, it tastes wonderful!

Used three garlic cloves rather than two, added a celery rib and a red bell pepper to the sauteed vegetables. used herbs de provence (1/2 t) instead of savory since I didn't have it on hand and reduce thyme to 1/2 t since I am not a fan. Used 5 roma tomatoes bc I had them getting old anyway (would likely sub canned tomatoes in future just for convenience). I cooked 1 cup of white beans from dry and used that with a little of the juice. Might ry with added hominy or barley as some reviews stated. I agree that it is too thin so would add less broth.

Did adjust the recipe a little bit - used twice as many beans, didn't add the tomatoes, and didn't do the blending bit at the the end and it turned out great! Next time, I think I would add some ham as well.

Wonderful soup! I didn't have fresh tomatoes so added a can of petite diced tomatoes, some diced potato along with the corn. I used my stick blender just for a few seconds to thicken and smooth. Added some cumin and nutritional yeast. Yummy!

Family loved this! Really easy recipe,nutritious and delicious.I used giant lima beans(I soaked and precooked a bit),red kidney beans and instead of thyme I added Italian seasoning.Threw in some spinach and frozen corn,and used a can of  tomatoes instead of fresh.Topped each bowl with a sprinkle of grated asiago cheese.It's a recipe that you can adapt to suit whatever you have on hand.The summer savory in it is a nice touch.My hubby raved about how good it was.Will make it every week in the winter I think.

Delicious!  I doubled this recipe for our large family of 7 - and added an extra 2 cups of  beans.  Did not purée it, we like it chunky!  Yum!!

This was great! Flavorful, hearty, nutritious, and great for a winter meal! I would love to make this again! Might I add a few suggestions?
First, double everything except the broth. You'd have it way thicker and more flavorful. I would also add some onion powder and chopped green onion.
Next, it would be useful to cook the carrots first, as they take awhile to soften--otherwise you get a surprise crunch in your spoonful. You might want to fully boil the soup before letting it simmer.
Lastly, instead of pureeing just half of the soup, puree ALL of it. It's thicker and you don't have to worry about evenly separating the batch. It's also useful if you have family members or friends who aren't partial to beans or certain vegetables--now they can't see what's in this delicious soup!

I love this but there's not a lot of flavor to the broth, it's mild.  I didn't have summer savory so maybe that would have made a difference.  I fade extra beans, tomatoes, chopped spinach, celery & potatoes.  It's warm, filling, guilt free!

I only gave this a 4, because I changed it to suit our tastes the second time around. Changes: 2 carrots, 1/2 tsp. savory, 4 c. chicken broth and 2 cans white beans. Also good with zuchinni added.
