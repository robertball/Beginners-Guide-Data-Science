I LOVE garlic scape pesto. So much, that this is my first reveiw!  I made this recipe, though I was not exact about the measurements, as I just used all the garlic scapes I had.  I don't think you can go wrong--but it's spicy, in the garlicky way!  If it's to spicy for you, you can blanch the garlic scapes first.  Also, this keeps in the freezer.  I put it in 8 oz canning jars, filled 1/2 from top and freeze...

Garlic lovers, this is the recipe  for you!  Follow it exactly as it is written.  We have always made the traditional pesto with basil, parsley and pinenuts; we won't be making that anymore.  This recipe far surpasses any pesto we have ever had.  We had enough scapes to make 2 1/2 batches and all are tucked away in the freezer where many will be given as Christmas gifts. We used fresh lemon juice as some people are allergic to sulfites that are contained in bottled juice; and a lovely black Malabar pepper. Thanks to whomever came up with this recipe.   June 2014; a year later. Just cut the scapes and starting this pesto.  I froze what we didnt use last  summer in cute little jars and gave them as Christmas presents and birthday gifts throughout the year.  Everyone  has requested that they be repeated this year. Guess we will have to grow more garlic to satisfy everyone. 2016 - grew MORE garlic; might need to go into business. Great stuff!   2019 giving scapes away;  over 600 garlic bulbs. Have shared scapes and this recipe numerous times.

I agree that it has a different texture than basil pesto.  It was good on pasta and I also mixed a little into some chicken salad.  It kept covered in the fridge for several days.

I have to admit, this recipe wasn't my favorite.  I had never used garlic scapes before, and I doubt I will again.  Scapes are quite tough and the resulting pur√©e remained slightly chunky, even with additional olive oil.  I served the pesto over spaghetti and had to eat some of it on toasted baguette to cut the intensity.  It's REALLY garlicky and super strong.  I think it might be good if you turned it into a cream sauce or added it to other dishes as a garlic replacement, but as a straight-up pesto, I'm not a fan.

It's very good but I would suggest the following:
Make half the recipe to start. The sharpness of garlic scapes is not for everyone.
Add 1/2 cup walnuts to the full recipe, 1/4 to half recipe. This will help mellow the sharpness.
If you have ample scapes, use just the most tender parts of the garlic scape from the tip to just below the flower bud.
Cut the scapes into 1/2 inch pieces; the scapes are very stringy and will otherwise get caught in the processor blades. Add cut scapes to the processor gradually rather than all at once.

That said, the recipe worked for me!

Incredible pesto--I made several large batches and froze them--they thaw just beautifully. GREAT for having with pasta dishes or just spread on fresh, warm bread in the winter!

This was very good and a very easy way to use up the garlic scapes from my CSA.  I added sunflower seeds b/c I like the pine nuts in my usual basil pesto and wanted something similar in this.  It came out delicious, was easy to make, and went very well over whole wheat pasta with some turkey meatballs.

This is incredibly easy and so delicious. Great as a dip. Though I can't wait to serve it on grilled pork loin chops. So fresh tasting.

Fantastic.  Completely subbed as a lower fat, much more flavor substitute for mayo on sandwiches.  Great with pasta.  I only wish I had made more than a pint.  Next season, I will definitely make much more and freeze.

Delicious!  I would grow garlic just for the scapes!  Like others, I added walnuts. I freeze in 4 ounce containers to eat in the winter.  I searched all the local farm markets for scapes!

I made this garlic scape pesto the first time exactly as described (delicious, but lots of garlic) and so the second time I blanched the garlic scapes before adding them and I love it even more! Blanching seems to cut the harshness of the garlic just enough and it makes the pesto texture resemble a more traditional basil pesto. Yum!

Great recipe, make a great dip by mixing this with cream cheese - lovely color, and the cream cheese cuts a bit of the intensity of the garlic. Yummy on pita chips, veggies, spread on crusty warm bread - pretty much anything savory!

My 15-yr old said this was his favorite homemade pasta dish he had every eaten. I did modify it because I was worried the raw scapes would be too garlicky. 

Here's what I did:

First, I trimmed off the flowers and blanched the scapes in a big pot of boiling water. 

Then, I strained the scapes and blended them as directed but added 1/4 cup pine nuts (for a half recipe, double for full). 

I reused the boiling water to make the pasta. 

Finally, freshly shaved parmesan on top.

Everyone ate it up, even my 10-yr old. Better than basil pesto in my son's opinion!

Very Very garlicky, added sum dried tomatoes. Heard you can blanch the scapes for a less garlicky taste. Freezes well.Yes, blanching decreases that strong garlic flavor, also add some basil , roasted almonds and parmesan (lufa recipe) yum, yum.

I will  make it again! I wish I had  found this recipe before I tried what the Farmers Market lady told me as it took over 30 minutes to prepare, pieces were larger and made 2x the quantity I was looking for. Happy to have friends who enjoy pesto. This is 1st time I have tried garlic pesto but it will be awhile before I use it all up, next time I will look at this recipe BEFORE I start

I am not a big steak fan, but my husband is.  When I found myself with garlic scapes in a CSA box in 2017, I tried this recipe.  I liked it so much, I bought bunches of scapes, made several batches and froze it in individual servings to use the rest of the summer and fall.  So good and flavorful.  Somehow one batch ended up very peppery, so I needed  to watch it carefully when  I made the 2018 supply.

This was great!  I halved the ingredients as I only had abt 10 oz. of scapes.  Next time I would use a little more care to not add the tougher part of the scape as the texture was a little firmer than regular pesto and I would definitely add toasted slivered almonds, walnuts or pine nuts! 

I‚Äôve always grown a lot of basil and I‚Äôve been intimidated to make pesto.  This was my first try and I would easily and confidently use this as a basic recipe for basil pesto it turned out so well!

I loved this!  We spread it on bagel chips and topped it with smoked salmon.  It was a hit at the party we went to, and I'll make it again for sure!  The scapes need to be chopped finely before being put into the food processor.  I cut them into 2" pieces, but should have chopped them much more. I added the juice of a whole lemon. To make the pesto more smooth I ended up scraping the batch into my blender.

This was a good jumping off place for garlic scapes I received in CSA since I never used them before.  I added some pine nuts and feel like it needed a little salt.  I winged the amounts of the ingredients and ended up with 3 cups of pesto.  Thanks!!

Yum! Wow. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever used garlic scapes, and this is the perfect recipe to use to be able to fully appreciate their flavor. I got them in a mixed box of produce, and I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with them. The simplicity of this recipe won me over, and the flavor is outstanding!

My boyfriend was at the neighbor‚Äôs house and told him how much I enjoy cooking, so he sent a box full of scapes over. Today is my first official day of summer vacation, so what better places to be than outside in the garden and then in the kitchen! Although I‚Äôd never done anything with scapes before, I am always up for trying something new and I sure do love garlic and pesto! I am very happy with this simple, yet delicious, recipe! Thanks for sharing.

Great, easy recipe.   When I used some Asiago to supplement the Parmesan, the pesto needed some salt.   I added a teaspoon of miso and...Wow, fantastic!

Freshly picked, young scapes are tender. If they are tough than they were not picked at the right time, or they sat around too long! I personally like to add fresh herbs to this but this is a good basic recipe.

Amazing stuff! It almost blew my head off! I mixed it with a bit of mayo and that smoothed it out...a little! Then I added it to linguini and it was fabulous! The heat had disparate and it was easy to take.

I made this last year with a different recipe and it didn't turn out as well.  This is a super easy recipe and turns out fantastic.  I did blanch the scapes last night to make it less "stringy" and that helped a lot.  If you have friends or family with garlic make sure to snap those tops off and use them.  Can't wait to use this tonight as a simple pesto sauce on pasta.

First time I bought a bunch of garlic scrapes.  Yum!  I halved the recipe as there was only one bunch.  It mad two 1/2 cup containers.  One I froze, the other I will bring to serve with pita chips as an appetizer for a party.

I have now tasted it and its not bad. Its just that my spices were overdone waiting for it to thicken which it didn't even a little bit. Not sure why. Ill always use lemon and butter for fish but I don't think this works so well and needs tweaking. Thank you.

Whatever you do, don't blanch the scapes! I tried it and it killed the garlic flavor. I made another batch, following the recipe. Much better!  It really does need salt though.

Very good way to use the few scapes I get each year. I use it on pasta as well as a condiment on sandwiches.

My sister and I look forward to mid-June in Maryland 
every year when we can harvest or purchase scapes.  I used fresh large flakes of parmesan, pine nuts (1/4 cup) and plenty of salt and an extra 1/2 cup olive oil (in addition to the recipe).  To make the scapes more tender for chopping in the blender, I blanched them - bring a large pot of water to boil, dump in scapes and let sit for 4 minutes or so.  Drain and dunk them in water with lots of ice cubes.  Drain after about 2 minutes.  The scapes will be lots easier to chop and process.  Yum!

This is a great basic recipe for scape pesto. I've made it as is and sometimes added pine nuts or walnuts and sometimes added basil to the recipe.

Excellent and simple recipe. I had about half the amount of garlic scapes so I reduced the recipe such. Came out perfectly. Now I want to put it on everything even though it'll give you some garlic breath. :-). This is a keeper!

This was delicious and easy.  I left out the lemon juice and took someone else's idea and added sundried tomatoes.  Great use of the scapes!

Like others I was looking for a recipe to use garlic scapes from our summer CSA.  This was a real hit with my two year old and I.  My husband felt it was a little bland (what?).  I did cut the flower tops off the scapes and only used the greens.  I followed the recipe as stated.  I served over penne pasta and cut up chicken breast.  Seemed to yield about three cups.  I only used one with one pound of pasta.  I divided the remaining pesto into one cup servings and froze.  I will definitely make again!

I hate to be a party pooper, but I just did not care for this. I LOVE basil pesto, and I doctored the garlic scapes up the same way with pine nuts, and added some cream to take some of the "bite" out of the scapes, but the texture, taste, and look of it was unappealing to me.
