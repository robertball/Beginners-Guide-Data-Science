I made this for the family last night and we all loved it! The only change I made was to some garlic to the sauce and doubled the recipe. Delicious!

I have worked in the restaurant industry all my life and have to say this recipe is restaurant quality, I made a couple of subtle changes, using maple syrup instead of half of the sugar and a dash of tobasco sauce.

Loved this so simple to make, I cooked it two different ways, the first I put 5 drumsticks on a indoor grill crisped them, than went 25 min in oven at 400, the other I made 6 ds like the recipe enough sauce for  total of 11 drumsticks, both tasty and delicious, one was crispy the other was more moist.

Having been Chicago residents for a long time (my husband is a lifer, I'm going on 25 years) we are loyal to the local sauce that first made it's debut at the Taste of Chicago about 25 years ago, Sweet Baby Ray's. So neither of us are big fans of the thinner vinegar-heavy sauces. Correction -- neither of us were big fans, until now. I had to make a few alterations based on what was in the pantry, but still an outstanding sauce! Also, since I had 12 drumsticks (lunch leftovers!) I doubled the recipe. I omitted the chili powder (was out), I used apple cider vinegar in place of white vinegar and prepared mustard instead of dry. (and I added 1 tsp of garlic powder and 1/2 tsp of onion powder and didn't cover with foil so it would thicken better) In the last 10 minutes (baked for an hour and 10) I poured the sauce from the pan into a small saucepan and reduced it on medium to thicken it up while the chicken got a little crisp on the top. (this also gets rid of the extra water if it's too thin for you) Then I poured the sauce over the finished chicken. It wasn't sticky thick, but it wasn't watery either. It was perfect. And I'm picky about sauces. Reducing not only thickened the sauce, it intensified the flavor so I'd still do it that way again. My husband loved it! It didn't have a spicy kick but still amazing. Tomorrow I'm tripling the sauce recipe and reducing on the stove to jar it for our BBQ on the 4th. This will be outstanding brushed on grilled shrimp, salmon or pork. LOVE.

Husband and his friends said it was "delicious."  Made for the first time, only thing I changed was not to add the water.  Put half the sauce on for first 30 min & then turned the chicken & added the rest of the sauce.  Also, I never covered it.  Turned out great and ingredients are those that you would always have on hand.  Very good.

I don't understand getting a 'mixture' when your adding so much liquid to the recipe. I pretty much had a sauce after I combined all the ingredients. The water definitely didn't help.

Just tried this tonight and it was great. I changed up the cooking process though due to time. I pan-fried the chicken drumsticks in garlic and onion for 15 minutes, then poured the sauce into the skillet, put on the lid, and cooked on high for 20 minutes. Then I lowered the heat for another 10 minutes and dinner was ready!

The sauce is not a sauce after you add the water.  The water is not necessary and actually thins the sauce to a broth.  My instinct said to omit it.  Wish I had listened to my instinct!  It will not thicken when covered by the foil.  You will have to remove the foil if you want the sauce to thicken.

Awesome recipe! I did uncover the chicken half way just to allow the sauce to evaporate/thicken a little but it was fantastic. The meat was falling off the bone. So tender. This will be a regular dinner staple in our home from now on.

I uncovered it for the last 20 minutes of baking, hoping to thicken the sauce a little.  When I noticed it was still quite runny, I removed 1/2 cup of the sauce, threw two ice cubes in to cool it quickly, stirred in 1 tablespoon of cornstarch, then added this mixture to the rest of the dish.  I popped it back in the hot oven for a few minutes until it bubbled enough to cook the cornstarch.  It was delicious with mashed potatoes and green beans!

This was easy to make & tasted wonderful. Added cayenne, which gave it a nice kick. I baked the drumsticks in a metal pan. After baking an hour, I removed the foil. Then broiled the chicken until it was nicely browned.  I removed the drumsticks, turned the oven back to 400 and let the sauce bake until it thickened. The sauce was then poured over the drumsticks before serving. Next time I'm leaving out the water, as others have suggested.

I followed another reviewer's method of doing this on the stove top.  Omitted the water, because some reviewers said it made the sauce too soupy.  Next time  will omit the salt. There is enough salt in the sauce from the catsup and Wocestershire sauce.

I doubled the recipe except used only 1/2 the water. I cooked it an extra 15 min. The sauce was super runny. I was hoping for a nice thick bbq sauce. Also it was way too greasy. i won't make this again.

Very delicious sauce - Only adjustment I made was adding some minced garlic.  Got my very fussy 1 and 3 year old eating it!  I also drizzled the sauce over the mashed potatoes....DIVINE!!!

Don't add the water or salt and use less sugar.  This went over well.  Will be making it again.  Thank you.

WOW! Just made this, family is raving about it with every bite! Only thing I did different --- I made a batch x 3, left the foil off, let the skin brown a bit, and then turned them and let them brown again. Fall off the bone, finger licking good amazingness!!! Thank you for sharing! Will definitely make this again, and have added to my Recipe Box!

My family and I quite liked this recipe, but changed a few things... None of us like sweet meals, so I omitted the brown sugar, use tomato paste instead of ketchup, chop in some onion, cayenne pepper... In other words, I improvise every time to make the dish a bit spicier and less sweet. And while baking, I never cover it with foil, because my family loves their chicken crispy :)

Followed recipe exact- just doubled sauce per another review.  Delicious and so easy.  Kids ate every bit!!  Not sure if the water is needed- I think it would be fine without.  Definitely will put in the rotation!!

Falling-off-the-bone tasty. As others have said, the sauce can be a bit thin. Tips: skip the water, and don't cover it at all. You don't really need the water since you're adding so much vinegar. I omitted the water and uncovered it halfway through (when I turned the chicken), and the uncovered side got so nice and tan with a little crisp to it. Plus, the sauce was still pretty watery when I pulled it out at the end of the hour. So I bet keeping it uncovered throughout will let that sauce thicken up nicely. 

Served with oven roasted red potatoes and a Caesar salad.

My husband kept repeating this, like a man gone crazy..  "this is so good!" Just over and over.  For the kids I left out the chili powder.  I liked what another reviewer said, it's definitely restaurant quality.  We will be keeping this recipe close at hand.

This recipe is SO DELICIOUS. I added onions and half a bell pepper in the baking dish for health and flavor. I made it with buttered rice and drizzled the sauce on top. Amazing!!

I generally don't work with bone-in chicken pieces because I'm paranoid about it being cooked thoroughly, but drumsticks were on sale and I'm on a grocery budget. This was fool-proof and delicious! I'm careful with my 5 star ratings but this one deserves it. NOTE: I doubled the recipe and wasn't thinking logically and also doubled the sauce. It ended up being way too much sauce, duh. So far I've made these twice and the amt. of sauce is plenty even when the chicken is doubled.

Very good! Per the reviews I omitted the water, which was a good decision. Due to what I had on hand, I also used apple cider vinegar instead of white, one tablespoon of dijon instead of dry mustard, and just because I like bbq to be sweet I added a bit of pure maple syrup. I'll definitely be making this one again!

So, so good. I am not the best cook but was told once if you can read, you can cook. My advice if your're like me, always read the reviews, they are very helpful. A review of this recipe said no water and don't cover. Yummie! Also for you newbies, if you need a conversion like dry mustard to prepared or garlic cloves to minced....google it if not on this site. Thanks all recipes.com, I can't wait to cook something else.

I read most of the reviews before I made this and took into account the comments about the water and taking the foil off for the last 20 minutes. I had 4 chicken marylands and everything else in my cupboard except the mustard powder but I had honey seeded mustard in the fridge so used that instead and reduced the water by half I also took the skin off the chicken, turned them at 30 minutes cooked for another 20 and took the foil off for another 20. The sauce did not thicken it was very runny, but I found taking the skin off helped the flavour develop on the chicken so it was really nice. I would cook it again but I think it still needs some tweeking I will stick with the honey seeded mustard I think it gave it a nice sweetness

It turned out pretty darn tasty and was totally easy!  I followed the advice of another reviewer and pan seared the legs first to cut cooking time.  Also, added very little water but the sauce was thinner than I’d prefer.  So I poured the sauce off and used xanthan gum to thicken it to use as a glaze. Glazed them, turned oven to broil (be careful with broiling and sugar!!) and less 2 minutes later it was gorgeous perfection.  It was a couple more steps but worth it.

I too omitted the water. Doubled the recipe and added fresh garlic. When done, I removed the chicken and reduced the sauce on the stovetop to thicken. Delicious!!

I made this once exactly as the recipe states except I cut the salt in half. I cannot figure out why this gets so many good ratings.  It is drumsticks cooked in a BBQ broth, not a sauce.  The second time I made it, I left the water out completely.  It really didn't change much.  I baked it an extra half hour and it was still drumsticks stewed in a soupy mixture.  I think I could have baked it for three hours and it never would have thickened up.I won't be making it again, even though it is a cheap dish to make.  It requires too much tweaking.

This recipe is fantastic. For all those complaining about the water, you need that so there is enough sauce to BRAISE the chicken a little bit. Just let thin out at the end, or transfer the sauce to a saucepan for a few minutes and voila.

Great basic recipe.  I didn't add the water to the sauce based on other reviews.  Very tasty - but could use a bit more spice in my opinion.  Perfect recipe to put add-ins.  I also intend on adding some chopped onion and potatoes to the drumsticks while they are cooking next time for a twist.

This was a tasty meal, I enjoyed it. Adding the vinegar was unique, and I liked a light vinegary flavor. As many reviewers mentioned, I omitted the water as the juice from the chicken was indeed plenty, and I didn't want to thin the sauce anymore. Also I agreed that it didn't need to be covered with foil, that way, the sauce became thickened like the typical BBQ chicken appearance. Took a bit longer than 60 min, more like 80 min. The other side would stay moistened because of the juice, but I was ok with it.

Three quarters of the way in the cooking we poured the sauce and juices out then returned them to the top of the meat, uncovered, to brown.  Didn't need the water. This is a really great recipe and the finished product has a beautiful glossy finish.  (Just a note the last time we made this we were out of ketchup and substituted thick salsa, extra brown sugar, and 1/4 tsp allspice...)

Really simple and delicious to make!  Followed the directions exactly as above this first time, but thinking of either cutting back on the water or adding cornstarch to the sauce next time since it was a bit watery.  Thanks!

Just made this last night for dinner...didn't really follow exact ingredients, but came close =)
white vinegar -> apple cider vinegar (what's the difference!?)
brown sugar -> organic brown sugar
dry mustard -> is that the same as mustard powder?
soy sauce instead of Worcestershire sauce 
butter -> can't believe its not butter?! i guess its not the usual, regular butter.

Overall, it was delicious. Sauce was perfect, not watery at all. Thickened well but baked for 1 hr 30 min at 375 degrees.. Loved it, I would definitely make it again =)
3.5 Stars!

This is a great bbq sauce when you eliminate the salt and the water.  Chicken cooked in 35 to 40 minutes, not an hour and have made it twice... the first time nobody could eat it...was too salty... Thanks.

I didn't care for this recipe. Too much water and/or it should not be covered with foil. After my chicken was overcooked I had to remove the chicken and keep roasting the sauce - with the door open to allow evaporation - for another half hour before the sauce was even remotely thick. Then poured it over the overcooked chicken. Tasted okay i suppose.

I made this tonight and everyone loved it, including 2 grandchildren, 8 and 12. I did not use the water and it was fine, just enough for 8 large chicken legs (no thighs). I took the foil off the last 15  minutes and the sauce thickened nicely. Next time I would use less dry mustard, 2 tsp as it was a bit hot. I did use only 1 tsp chilli powder as I only had chipotle and it seemed strong enough. Otherwise, great!

This is the second time I've made this recipe.  The sauce is a little runny and doesn't coat the chicken, but if you marinade the chicken in the sauce for an hour or so you still get the great flavors and can use the sauce to pour over rice.  Spices were spot on and I didn't change a thing.

Made this last night... I absolutely agree ... The water makes the sauce toooo thin... I had to pour it out and put store bought BBQ sauce... I gave it 4 stars because the "sauce" served as a good marinade and gave the chicken a good flavor while it cooked... But I would skip the water and I also cooked it uncovered. ...

Like others, I made a few tweaks.  Added garlic powder, paprika, chili pepper flakes, and deleted the water.  Also, this time I used skinless chicken thighs, cooked it half way uncovered, flipped them over and then covered with foil. The sauce was fairly thick....and yummy!

I had 12 chicken legs so I doubled the recipe and it didn't cook down at all. Chicken was billed essentially. Don't double the recipe even if you have more chicken.

Followed the recipe, but I removed the cover after about 20 mins and cooked for another 50 mins uncovered. Came out perfect, black sticky bits, no sauce left in the pan, moist meat. My oven is basic, hot, and heats from the bottom, and I used a cast iron baking dish. This is a great recipe, it needs cooking times and method to be adjusted to your oven, it needs HEAT.

This recipe was easy to prepare. I did not add water and only used half the vinegar. The sauce was very liquid & the chicken did not look anything like the picture. I ended up removing the foil, putting it under the broiler and adding BBQ sauce. There was way too much fluid in bottom of pan! Had good flavor & moistness, but next time will remove skin and baste with sauce not drown it in a flavored fluid.

I read the reviews and tried it anyway.  I will not be making this one again. The chicken had flavor but the sauce was disappointing, it really needs to be thicker.

Made it as is. Everybody loved the taste of it sadly, the sauce never thickened. I'll be making it again but will use others recommendations for the sauce.

Hubby and I enjoyed it! The only ingredient I didn't include was water. It still tasted so good. I will definitely cook this again.

I thought this was good! The chicken was a little bland  hut the sauce was good. Next time I will either season the chicken or let it marinate in the sauce before cook it.

I did not enjoy this. I was hoping for a sweeter sauce and the sauce was so watery-I even cooked it an extra 10mins without the foil and another 5mns in broiler--sauce was watery. Maybe a little cornstarch to thicken it up. I followed the recipe to a T but did double it for 12 legs. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because my hubby and one of my sons said it was "pretty good". So maybe it was just me but I was disappointed. Thanks for sharing your recipe though and have a great night! Still looking for a great barbeque sauce that I can make at home :)

This is a delicious recipe! I substituted smoked paprika for part of the chili powder which gave it a very nice flavor. The sauce is a little thin so next time I will uncover part way through the cooking time.

This was soooooo easy.  I doubled the sauce, and added garlic.  I turned my drumsticks every 15 minutes, and moved them around a little, but that was mostly because my oven cooks unevenly so I have to constantly check things and rotate stuff.  I also took the foil off for 10-15 minutes (after an hour) to thicken the sauce, which did not really make that much off a difference.  

The water I thought was definitely unnecessary, and I think the next time I make it, I will double everything but the water, and then, try it without any water at all the third time.  Even if made exactly as is, it was still really good.

Great easy recipe to make it your own. My contributions are to add chili powder to the seasoning mix. I also made a nice chicken gravy with the dripping and used to complement the loaded mashed potatoes I made with this dish. I also make sweet corn and garlic bread. Was a tasty dinner that was easy and delicious. Enjoy this one!

My son made this chicken for supper tonight. Noticed the sauce was thin when he took out of oven so I put chicken and sauce in pot. Then shook corn starch and water mixture in a jar. Heated pot with chicken and sauce medium heat and added corn starch/water mixture, it thickens upon heating/light boil.  Voila, it was delicious! We definitely make this again.

Tasty and simple.
Add a splash of fish sauce, fresh chopped chilies, and some coriander to garnish and you get a nice Thai flavour.

Used apple cider vinegar & cut back the brown sugar.  Made extra sauce used only half the sauce in the baking dish.  Thicken the other sauce on the stovetop.  I add all the water it made the chicken cook in the thin sauce & soak in the flavor better.  After baking added remaining baking pan sauce to stovetop to reduce with the rest of sauce.  Wow tasted wonderful the drumsticks & sauce. Goes great with mashed potatoes.  It's on my favorite list from now on.

It came out delicious! A little change I would do is add less salt or no salt at all. With all the spices added it didn't need it. It was great overall though.

Good solid recipe, I will make this again.  I tweaked the recipe based on the comments of others:  added garlic, used only 1 tsp of chili powder, used apple cider vinegar instead of white vinegar and added no water.  I baked it uncovered for 1 hour, turning pieces halfway through per the recipe and basting 3 times with the sauce in the pan.  It was moist enough even being baked without being covered.  My husband and I both enjoyed this recipe and I will use this recipe again.  I liked the balance of flavors.  Much better than when I have baked chicken and used bottled bbq sauce.

After cooking chicken for an hour (turning chicken after 30 minutes), I transferred sauce to pot.  Put chicken back in over uncovered for another 15 minutes. Simmer sauce and add 2 Tbsp cornstarch mixed with 2 Tbsp cold water to thicken BBQ sauce.  Sauce is great over mashed potatoes.

Very nice and tender.  The sauce was also good.  I didn't have dry mustard so I substituted yellow mustard (2 tbs versus 2 tsp of the dry).  I followed others' advice to omit the water.   Basted the legs periodically and left it uncovered for the last 10 minutes.  Will definitely make this again.

It was a very good recipe. Quite flavorful.  The sauce is a little watery for my liking...but it maybe helped marinate the chicken more.  
Very inexpensive way to feed a lot of people. Quick and easy to prepare. 
If you want to create a thicker sauce, use half the amount of water. 
Added 2 cloves of fresh garlic to the recipe; would do again.

Cook it an extra 20 minutes and keep the foil on top. The chicken comes out super tender. 
I used a BBQ rub on the chicken first; makes the flavor pop.

This is so good and will make it again. The whole family loved the flavor and the chicken came out, fall off the bone, which everyone enjoyed. It was probably due to the size of my drumsticks, somewhere small and medium, but this only took around 35-40 minutes to bake before they hit that sweet 165. I added some garlic since I'm one of those people that puts garlic in almost everything. 
I am a noobie cook and had no problems, very easy to do. Always looking for simple recipes like this.
This could do with very little water and you'll get a BBQ sauce however I added the amount given and it added for some very juicy and delicious chicken.

The sauce was so runny and flavorless, even  after cutting the water and vinegar by half !
I had to reduce the sauce in a pan. on the stove and pour it back, over the drumstick before serving. 
If I make again, I will omit the water all together and reduce the vinegar to couple of spoons or else the sauce would be too acidic.

These turned out delicious. I blasted them a couple of times while cooking and they would have been fine as is. When done, we did spread a bit of Sweet Baby Rays on them and let them cook for a few

DO NOT ADD THE WATER, it will come out extremely watery. Luckily I read the other reviews and have not cooked it with water, but judging from how runny it already is without water I can't even imagine using water... Other than that this chicken is bomb!

This was a simple recipe to follow. I felt this was a great deal of wet ingredients therefore my sauce was a mixture. I seasoned the drumsticks as I normally would. I added minced garlic to the mixture before placing in the oven. I let it sit for about 10 minutes to see if it would thicken and it did not. The drumsticks had a great deal of flavor which was awesome. I just wish the sauce had thickened.
In the video water was excluded. I should have watched the video first. I would probably try this again.

I always look at a recipe and then do a little bit of improvising. I added more garlic, I added more chili powder. I baked them for about 20 minutes longer and turned them twice, basting them very often, and the taste is absolutely amazing.

I didn't add the butter; seemed unnecessary and I didn't miss the extra calories either. My sauce wasn't thick at all so I kept basting it as it cooked. I should have used a smaller pan so the juice didn't run off and get burnt. I would use a pan that keeps the drumsticks closer together next time.  Sauce seemed a bit heavy on the vinegar so I added a bit more sugar and ketchup.

I thought this was a fantastic recipe, the sauce tasted like proper bbq sauce but I doubled the recipe. It was way too much sauce I imagine I could have doubled it and still used the same amount of sauce. I saw some of the photos where the sauce didnt really color the chicken or make that proper grilled bbq look and that's how mine looked after 1 hr of baking with foil on so I left it for another 30 or so with the foil off and it really took nicely and really flavored the meat and evaporated a bit of the sauce and made it like proper bbq sauce instead of the liquid it started out as. I forgot to add the butter but it didnt matter, it still tasted amazing. THANKS FOR THE RECIPE! Well done. Will use this again...

I changed the recipe up just a bit. Firstly, I followed the recipe but only put the food in for 45 minutes. Secondly, after the 45 minutes were up I took it out and drained the extra juice, added 2 coats of bbq sauce, and then put it back in the oven for 30 minutes. Thirdly after those 30 minutes were up, I took the chicken out and added 2 more coats of bbq, I then stuck it back in the oven for another 30 minutes. Once I took it out it was ready to eat, the chicken fell right off the bone :).

A well-balanced sauce pairs well with the drumsticks that stay juicy and tender, and works with other bits of chicken as well.  The only downside is I never have any leftovers for my lunch the next day!

I followed a few other comments and omitted adding water.  Thankfully I did this, it would have been way too much liquid. Next time I will grill the chicken for a bit first to crisp the skin a bit then bake it with the sauce.

This was really easy to make. I had everything I needed so it went pretty fast. We were out of potatoes so we paired it with rice. Not bad but would definitely be better with mashed potatoes.

Fantastic!! The sauce is so, so great and the chicken comes out nice and juicy. I made a couple edits to the original... used prepared yellow mustard instead of powder because that’s what I had on had. Followed the advice of another reviewer and added a little garlic and onion powder. When the chicken was cooked I let the sauce simmer on the stove for about 15 min to thicken. Try this recipe, you won’t be disappointed!!

I had to try again without the foil. Without it, the sauce actually changed and made a better result. That said, avoid using foil at all costs!

The family loved this recipe!  After reading the other reviews, I left out the water in the sauce, it really was enough without it.  I doubled the sauce ingredients and used probably 15 or 20 drumsticks. I baked the chicken in the sauce at the lower temp for about 2 hours, and then uncovered the chicken.  I then poured off the pan juices and sauce and reduced it on the stove to a thick tangy sauce while I continued to bake the chicken uncovered at 400 degrees for 20 or 30 minutes to dry out the skin a little.  It was ‘falling off the bone’ delicious!  Will make again tomorrow another family group. Thanks for the great recipe!

I also did not add the water. Used maple syrup instead of the sugar. Enough sauce for a dozen chicken legs. The sauce is lovely and does thicken up even more when cooling. Very tasty. A keeper. I don’t understand how some people can screw up this recipe.

I believe the first time I made this dish I had to fudge a little with the mustard ingredient but it still turned out amazing. I've made this dish a few times now (and I'm about to make it again) and still love it time after time. After that first time I've made it with all the listed ingredients and their given amounts (though I usually make a much bigger batch than this recipe is made for so I'll usually double all the ingredients when making more chicken than it calls for). Honestly I usually way over-cook chicken so badly, but with this recipe the chicken always turns out so perfect, not my usual chicken turnout. Anyways any time I have/get drumsticks this is the recipe I go to, every time.

Turned out good.  My children were confused because, though it looked and tasted grilled (in the BBQ), they had seen me take it out of the oven.  I did not add the water (as suggested in video).  I suggest that after turning the chicken over (half-way through cooking), leave it uncovered until cooked. Doing so will allow the sauce to thicken.

I made this today and it was delicious. I followed everything except I didn't add any water but I did add a splash of chicken broth since it was already a little thick. Once I made the sauce I used a syringe and injected the sauce into the drumsticks and then poured the rest of the sauce on top of the chicken. Will definitely make this again. Thanks!

Excellent!  A good dinner to make for everyone.  Didn't put any chili powder because it was being served to a toddler.  Going to put this in the family rotation.

Really delicious! Not usually a big drumstick fan but that’s what I had so I used it. They came out so amazingly tender! My family really loved it. I didn’t leave out the water. Wish I had. Almost a five star. Great recipe. Thanks! I’ll definitely be reusing this one. Going in my favorites!

very good.  I omitted the water like some other people said.  I think it just makes it to watery.  I like the sauce thick.  I browned the chicken in the frying pan with a little olive oil first to cut down on cooking time.  And I uncovered it near the end of baking time as well.  Very tasty, I will make it again.

Amateur cook over here. I really enjoyed these drumsticks. Will likely make again. Made for a team potluck and weekly meal prep. Made two batches of 16 drumsticks each and modified the recipe each time in a different way. The second batch was the one I liked better. Here's how I modified that batch:
1. not adding any water (recommended by a lot of reviewers)
2. liberally applying finely chopped garlic
3. adding salt, pepper, cayenne, onion powder
4. substituting 1/4 of the dry mustard with S&B oriental mustard to add a little heat
Cooking: 
Baked for 35 minutes covered.
Remove foil and cook 15 minutes uncovered with sauce.
Separate sauce and chicken (I found it easier to move chicken to a different dish).
Bake chicken uncovered and without sauce for 10 minutes on each side (20 min total).
Meanwhile, put sauce on stovetop on low heat to reduce a bit.

Closing thoughts:
The drumsticks could have used less cook time overall. Wasn't dry per se, but wasn't as moist as it could/should have been.
I liked the flavor added by the spice, but wanted more heat (I like spicy)-- might try increasing the proportion of S&B mustard to regular mustard and increase the chili powder and cayenne as well.
I want to dry rub the chicken before hand and let it sit in the flavors for a bit before cooking. The first batch I made had a very flavorful sauce but the chicken didn't really soak the flavors up in the time it took to cook. That's fine if you eat the chicken in the sauce, but some folks prefer

This was awful, why didn't I trust my instinct that there is zero reason to add water to a bbq sauce?  I ended up with boiling steamed bbq scented chicken, it was awful.  DON"T MAKE THIS!!

My chicken legs are in the oven right now.  I am now reading some reviews ...  Update:  I had used my CorningWare dish with the glass lid.  I'm thinking that this kept all of the heat in and it was really hot.  When my chicken legs were done, after turning them at half time and taking the dish out of the oven after an hour, the water & spices had reduced to a thick sauce that was just enough for the 4 chicken legs that I was cooking.  I wished I had cooked the other 4 I had and doubled the sauce.  For all the reviewers that said the sauce was just like water when it was done, I suspect that their pane wasn't air-tight enough to keep the heat in to reduce the sauce.  The chicken legs came out so tender and juicy and falling off the bone.  Wonderful flavor!  I'll definitely use this recipe in future for chicken legs!  For a football game, I'll cook up a whole bunch of them to munch on.  I would make sure there is lots of sauce and after the hour I would lay them under the broiler after spooning the sauce onto the top of them!  The spices were all perfect, except I did use a wee bit less of the chili powder than it said...all the flavors came together to create a wonderful, flavorful dish!

This was really good but as other reviewers before me mentioned the sauce was too thin. I followed the instructions and hoped for the best. You could probably skip the water, but I just removed some sauce before they were done and thickened it with flour.  The flavor is spot on and the legs were moist and delicious. I will definitely make this again.  I think next time I will remove the skins and use Apple juice instead of water. Thanks for the recipe Nicole!

For those of us who are a bit lazy and would prefer not to make our own sauce, a bottle of Kraft Bbq sauce does the trick and it tastes better than a lot of the chicken I’ve had at bbq restaurants.

I made this and it was so good! The only changes i made was i didn’t add ANY water and added a little garlic. I put the sauce on one side, then cooked for 30 min, then took them out and put sauce on the other side back in for the other 30 min. Came out great!

You couldn't ask for an easier recipe than this! The only thing I adjusted was removing the foil and letting it bake a little longer so the sauce could thicken. It still didn't thicken quite enough for my taste but it was very flavorful either way. I may try broiling for a few minutes at the end next time to try and get a little crispness.

I omitted the water from the recipe. I baked the covered chicken 45 minutes, then turned them over and baked for 20 minutes. I uncovered the chicken and baked for another 25 minutes. I used parchment paper for the bottom lining for easy clean up.

I did not care for this at all! There's way too much liquid in the sauce, it's like water. Covering the chicken makes the chicken pale, colorless and unappetizing. Had to completely change/doctor up the recipe to make it edible.

Added a clove of garlic to the sauce and omitted the chili powder as we don't do spicy. Was fantastic!
Also, NO foul! Makes the sauce thicker and much better to us.

I didn’t take a picture because yours was prettier than mine. It must have been pretty good because it was gone before I got thru the line.   I did modify the sauce, it tasted like ketchup.  I added molasses,Claud’s marinade, cumin, New Mexico chili powder, smoked paprika and cayenne. Sorry New York City. My sauce didn’t thicken like I would have liked.  I should have reduced it, but time was pushing me out the door.

Great technique.  400 degrees for an hour is on the mark.  I used a rub for about half the time and then topped with a sauce.  Tender and tasty!

I will decrease the dry mustard the next time I make it. Personal taste preference is all. Both my DH and I thought it was very tasty though.

I omitted the sugar. I uncovered and broiled for about 5 min at the end, to give the charred look and make a bit crispier.
Yum!

2 tsp. Of salt is way too much.  I used 1 tsp.  and still found it too salt.  Will omit salt next time.  Also could use a thickening  agent.  Will add 1 tsp of cornstarch next time

This was a hit! I smoked the legs with apple wood, about one hour at around 140, before baking. The sauce was pretty thin, but delicious. This would probably make a good injected marinade. I think I will cook uncovered, or add a little corn starch, the next time I make this. And yes, it is delicious poured over potatoes! We made potato cakes and poured some of the sauce over them. It'll make your tongue slap your brains out!

It was less interesting than I anticipated with the ingredients, compared to my usual sweet and sour sauce.  I saw another poster added garlic, which I'll do next time.  I'd also thicken it.

I added 1 tsp of garlic powder to the sauce and skipped the chili powder and water. I also lightly seasoned the chicken with seasoning salt and black pepper before adding sauce. Delicious! Will make again.

I made this the other day, followed the directions exactly and although they tasted ok, they didn't have much barbecue flavor or color, I wonder what  went wrong.  I probably won't make them again.

My husband and I liked this recipe vey much . I used chicken pieces instead of chicken legs. I uncovered after 30 minutes instead of 1 hr to allow the sauce to thicken . Other than that no changes. Very good

The sauce has a very good flavor. I love the hint of the vinegar on my palate. I cooked the dish in a cooking bag to prevent the chicken from tasting dry. The sauce never thickened but the bag may have something to do with that. I didn't have any butter on hand, so I left this ingredient out of the recipe. Honestly I didn't miss it. Also I used 1/2 teaspoon of salt. I don't like much salt.

Super easy to make. Other than buying the chicken legs the ingredients are stuff I already had in the cabinet. Some people have stated that its watery and that's correct. But if you let a cool down it will thicken. I learned that after I had served them with the watery sauce. Either way they are delicious. I will definitely make this again. I just added one thing and that was I sliced red potatoes and put them with the chicken. So the potatoes come out great with that sauce. This is a winner!!!!! I'm enjoying trying out these different recipes.  Going by the pictures and ratings and so far each recipe I have tried has been good. So if your reading this You Gotta try this one. My family and I loved it.

Definitely a vinegar based recipe that can do without the water (to much liquid). I used chili paste sauce instead of powder and I used half the volume. I did not cover my chicken or pour all the BBQ sauce over legs. I reserved BBQ sauce because at intervals in time I drained liquid from dish and painted more sauce on. I put the chicken under the broiler at the end to crisp up the skin.

The whole family thought this dish was a hit.  The sauce wiped up in a flash, the kids (13,7, and 4) love it.  I used leg quarters. I will make this again.

Great meal. Used white wine vinegar instead and 3tsp of Dijon because I didn't have the right stuff. Also added garlic and cornstarch to sauce as it was way too thin. Leave out the water. Great chicken

Good flavor will omit the water next time and maybe cut back in the vinegar so that the sauce thickens...will try again next time

So I followed the recipe exactly minus the water and only did 1 t. Salt instead of 2. I also had a pack of 8 drumsticks vs. 6. I did cover it with foil and I cooked it for 1 hr. 5 min. Then upped the temp the last 4-5 min to crisp the skin on the chicken. It was delicious. My husband loved it. It was slightly spicy but just slightly.

Had to make a couple of changes,  I didn't have quite enough brown sugar, so I added about 1 tablespoon of honey, I didn't have dry mustard, so I substituted 1 teaspoon of dijon mustard.  I also had no chili powder, and no substitute.  
As others suggested, I didn't use any water.
This is so different from any bottled BBQ sauce.  Will make it again, but definitely get some chili powder.

This was very easy and tasty. Kid friendly, both  my kids (7&11) gobbled it up. I thought I pulled out drumstick but they were  thighs, and they worked just perfect. I did season them first with garlic, onion powder and fresh  grind peppercorn. I also was out of chili powder so used paprika season in its place.   Next time i’ll have to make double. kids eat most. Great winter meal for a summer taste! pairs well with rice, mash taters or mac  and cheese and salad!

Really good flavor. Only thing I would change is DON'T ADD THE WATER until you have everything else mixed. I threw everything together and came out with a much too thin sauce. Mix everything and then if needed add water. Otherwise it was great!

Doubled the recipe to make 12 drumsticks and it was like watery soup
If your planning on doubling the recipe I would suggest not to add a full cup of water but just double the other ingredients. 
Moist but SO bland :(

Came out pretty good. I followed the directions exactly aside from adding water because other reviews complained of it being too soupy. And it would have been. Might tweak the next time to make thicker.

Excellent sauce. I could have eaten the sauce  alone with a spoon! I doubled the sauce and used it with a large pkg of chicken legs.  So good.  It’s on my list of regular dinners now.

Loved it!  I went heavy on the butter by accident (misread teaspoon for tablespoon) and used chicken broth in place of water.  Reminded  me of my mother's southern bbq country ribs sauce.

So so easy and everyone in my family loved it. I made it exactly as it is shown. With the water, it ended up being a bbq glaze instead of a sauce but I didn't mind. The flavor was delicious and the meat was so moist and tender!

I made this last night and it was a hit! I followed someone's else's suggestions: omitted water, poured on half of sauce and baked for 30 minutes, then turned chicken over and baked for another 30 minutes. I also didn't have dry mustard so substituted with yellow mustard and it was fine. I didn't cover or use foil--I baked chicken in clear glass pan. The chicken was super tender and flavorful! I will be keeping this recipe in regular rotation!

Very easy and moist. I did follow someones suggestion and added 2 tsp garlic powder to the mix. I also used 2 tsp of spicy brown mustard not the dry in the recipe and it gave the sauce a little kick. Loved it. Aluminium on top and bottom made clean up easy.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was delicious! I was a little worried at first because some people were questioning the water but i cooked it for an extra 15 minutes and the sauce definitely thickened and the chicken was still juicy! I did add some garlic powder to the mixture but overall great flavor. Will definitely make again!

The cooking time for the chicken was ample, and the sauce components were really good.

However, the water really does make a mess of the sauce and causes unnecessary additional cooking time. 

Instead, either half the water used or remove completely for a thicker sauce and apply later in the cooking process for a delicious fix.

I followed the recipe exactly. Except I forgot to baste as the chicken baked and my end chicken looked nothing like the photo. So I poured the sauce into a sauce pan and added the drumsticks and simmered on high for about 20 minutes until the sauce thickened and I basted while

I used Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce Ketchup instead of regular ketchup and skipped out on the chili powder, came out excellent...it was flavorful and succulent.

I had to triple the recipe due to having more chicken. I ended up cooking the chicken for about 30 mins longer. It really wasn't a BBQ chicken but it came out good, my family enjoyed it. Maybe omitting the water as others recommended would have done the trick in making the sauce a bit thicker and stickier. Also only covered it for 30 mins. Might try again on chicken thighs

Delicious! My 5yo declared it "better than gooder" which is 2 thumbs up for her ;) I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I followed other reviewers suggestions and omitted the water completely, then as it was halfway through cooking I realized I forgot to add the butter, but it was very tasty without it. I should have let it cook a little longer than an hour just so the sauce could caramelize, next time I'll do that and dip the chicken in the sauce as i eat it as well. Overall, a great recipe with the changes made!

I loved this! Wish I had made more! My husband & I had to give half of our chicken to our kids (ages 5 & 4) because they ate theirs and most of ours. I added 1/2 tsp. of the chili powder and used chicken quarters instead of all legs. I made the sauce per directed and poured half on before cooking then the rest on after an hour, uncovered the baking dish and baked it again for another 10 minutes. The sauce was thick & delicious. I took the writers suggestion & served it with mashed potatoes & a salad. Finger licking good!

I always read reviews beforehand but knew when I read this recipe I would not be adding any water.  Also realized I was out of brown sugar so I substituted with honey.  Added 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.  This dish was amazing.  Loved it with my changes

Flavor was nice, but the sauce is too thin even omitting the water. I recommend using no water and adding 1-2tbsp corn starch, thickening over heat before putting it on the chicken.

Maybe I did this totally wrong, although I was careful to follow directions.  But the result was not great.  The chicken drumsticks tasted boiled because of the amount of sauce and instead of having a good barbecue flavor, they had a strong vinegar flavor which was not good.

Won't make this one again.

I did not add water or vinegar to my mixture. It turned out really tasty and my family LOVED it.  I will make this again! P.S. For an "easier clean up", I placed the chicken on baking parchment paper. It was easier than aluminum foil.

This was amazing!!!  like other comments I omitted the water (thankfully) and added some fresh garlic. 
Covered for half the time and let the sauce thicken the last half.

It should be called "BBQ Chicken Soup." The sauce turns out like broth unless you take out the water and take off the foil half way through. In my opinion, if you have to change half the recipe for it to work, like most cooks did here, it gets a one star in my book. The ONLY way I'd make this again is with all the changes to the sauce.

this was a great recipe. family enjoyed it. I mad a few small adjustments, first I added a little brown sugar to the sauce mix. Second, it was pouring outside, so I ended up putting the chicken in a pyrex, pouring all the sauce on it.. and baking it for about 35 minutes, then broiling to crisp up the chicken.. it turned out great.  I used only drumsticks, which made this a verrrry economical weeknight dinner. will do again, on the grille.

Excellent as written, but uncovering it about halfway through thickens up the sauce and gives it  a more grilled look and taste.

This is one of the best chicken recipes, I've ever made!  I didn't put the chilli pepper in, because I don't like anything "hot"!  Every recipe that I've made from "All Recipes", has been excellent!  Without fail!  (I've made many things from this site).   It was very simple to make and I look forward to making it, time and time again!

I made this for my husband and he really enjoyed it. He thought it was tender and flavorful. The only negative feedback was the lack of thick barbecue sauce. I think next time I'll just exclude the water.

I usually research a recipe but sometimes I don't. This was good but it  didn't thicken with or without the aluminum foil cover. I even cooked it longer as suggested still didn't thicken. So I agree with others don't add the water.  The chicken was great the flavor was great.

Taste was there, chicken absorbed it well. Finished product was very watery. Next time I'll leave out the water. Broiled 4 minutes on each side after removing foil.

Best BBQ sauce I've ever had! Like others have said, it was thin but I added a tbls of cornstarch, boiled for 10 minutes and then dipped the drumsticks. Paired with roasted Yukon golds. So good!

The recipe has absolutely too much liquid. This is probably one of the worst recipes I have ever come across and tried. the "sauce" was more like a bath rather than a sauce. There was very little "sauce" flavor with the chicken. The meal would have been better if bathed in chicken broth rather than this so-called sauce. One star is a gift for this one.

I gave this 4 stars because using the 1/2 cup water would have made this into a soup!  I took the advice of other reviewers - and used 1/4 cup brown sugar and 1/4 cup maple syrup (I doubled the recipe - since I had 12 drumsticks!).  After they were done - I uncovered them and broiled for a bit to make the skin crispy.  I'd like to  find a recipe where the sauce is "stickier" than this one - but the sauce was nice.

Followed suit to other reviews and omitted water. Actually forgot to cover until the last fifteen minutes. Turned out just fine. Will line my pan with tin foil next time because the sauce burns a bit at the edges. Will add lemon squeeze to it all next time too. Served with roasted potatoes and green beans. A+

This was totally delicious!  I did make two simple changes.... I omitted the water and used garlic powder instead of chilli!  A definite repeat and in my recipe file!

Made this for the family tonight, I only used 1tsp Chilli, it still had a little bite, a good bite ?? Also used 10 drumsticks instead of six Anwar still mixture.  I ended up finishing off the drumsticks in an oven try with the sauce poured over them, just kept basting them.
Just delicious

Halfway through the baking process, I was shocked to discover a pan full of chicken *swimming* in liquid. I wish I'd read some of the other reviews before attempting this recipe. Will not make again.

Served as main dish at potluck I hosted. Chicken is tasty, inexpensive $13 for 20 legs. Simple to prepare by just baking in the oven. Got rave reviews and handed out lots of copies of the recipe. Great for potluck, others bring salads for a diverse and filing meal.

Made no changes ingredient wise, I did uncover the last 30 minutes and use a silicone spoon to dip the sauce and pour over every 5 minutes. The sauce is a bit runny but thickens a tad, you can also pour it in a pan and add cornstarch to thicken but I just used it as is. Recipe is simple and uses everyday items nothing funky or hard to find. Mix and bake and done. Turns out perfect and looks and taste amazing.

I made this recipe using the changes suggested in the video and by many reviewers -- I omitted the 1/2 c water and I left the foil off for the second half of cooking. I made 7 drumsticks instead of 6 (but only because that was half of a family package), and there was plenty of sauce. The chicken was very good, though the BBQ sauce wasn't a unanimous hit among my kids. I liked it myself, but if I make this again (likely!) I will probably cut the added salt in half. Definitely a decent indoor substitute for BBQ.

I coated the drumsticks with flour and fried them in olive oil before baking them ..  I also  added some garlic to the sauce  and it is very good.  I doubled the sauce recipe and did not have to.  I will make this again

Amazing dish, used half the water and added chilli flakes as we like a little extra spice.  Cooked for 50 mins then removed foil and cooked for another 25 minutes.  hubby hates anything that's not a boneless breast and even asked me to make it again!

Fantastic. Did them in an electric frypan. Cooked at 350 for about 15 minutes and then at 200-250 for another hour or so. The liquid had steamed off and left a lovely thick sticky sauce.
Definitely a keeper....

This recipe is absolutely fantastic. I read a few comments about there being too much water, so I only added just a splash to make it slightly less thick. It tastes incredible. I made this last night, and it's so good I'm making it again tonight.

I often don't like BBQ sauce because it tends to be too sweet but not this one! I found it has a perfect balance of ingredients, except that, as mentioned in other reviews the water is not needed. 
I cooked it as directed for an hour but the chicken was not crispy and the sauce was still too runny, so I uncovered it and continued cooking for an additional 15 min and turned out better.

I actually did this a little different. I turned the dial to 400 degrees but did not turn the bake dial. I then took my chicken thighs and legs and scored each one three times and then put them in a glass loaf dish (I only cooked 2 thighs and 2 legs)and covered completely with a thick coating of Kraft BBQ sauce. I then covered them with foil. I placed them in the oven until I was ready to cook them. I actually was not home the first time so I had my boyfriend turn them on when I was about 30 minutes away from home and then I turned them over and finished the cooking for another 30 minutes. They turned out very tender (falling apart) and juicy.  This is added to my favorite recipes collection.

Very tender and delicious. My exceptions to recipe was double chili powder and Worcestershire sauce. Then with 10 minutes left to cook I removed the liquid and boiled it down to a thick glaze and applied to legs. Then back in the oven for the final 10 minutes uncovered. Will make again. Water could be reduced but I think it makes for a more tender leg initially.

Great recipe. As written the sauce is thin, which works fine, but I prefer it a little thicker so it sticks to the chicken better. Second time around I left out the water and heated the sauce ingredients in a saucepan to thicken. This helped a lot.

Made this for dinner tonight, and it was delicious! I didn't add the water to the sauce, but I did add a tsp of garlic powder, a tsp of onion powder, and a dash of cayenne for a little kick, and topped the legs with thin lemon slices before baking.
Served with baked potatoes and sweet corn on the cob for a great summer meal.

I made it exactly---w/1 exception mentioned below---as the instructions stated & served with jasmine rice & mixed veggies. My husband didn't like the taste of the vinegar & I used the milder cider vinegar rather than the harsh white. Other than that, it was enjoyed by all. It was especially liked that there was so much sauce to pour over rice. I'll definitely make again w/some tweeks:-)

I should have followed other's reviews and left out the water.  Definitely to much liquid to adhere to the chicken.  I may try one more time and leave out the water and add garlic.

I made this recipe for my 3 1/2 year old son and I and it turned out great. I added some syrup to sweeten his and have mine a kick with some chili powder and a bit of cayenne. His sauce didn't thicken up as much as mine did because I put his in foil in the pan so the sauces wouldn't mix. Next time, I'll just use separate dishes, but I will definitely make this again!

There was too much liquid halfway through baking.  I removed the foil to boil off  some of the excess.  Everything turnout to be delicious in the end.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very tasty, I put the whole shebang in the slow cooker instead of the oven - also added 1/3 cup of Cattleboys BBQ sauce to the mix - was fantastic!

I made this multiple times, omitting the water. I also use only 1 tsp of chili powder for my taste. I put half the sauce on at the beginning, and halfway through the cooking time, I turn the chicken, and put  on the remaining sauce. I leave it uncovered from then on. Delicious, tender, juicy chicken is the result!

Do not add water!!! I did but I managed to save the sauce by pouring the final juices in a saucepan with 2Tbps flour and brought to a boil for 1 minute while stirring, then cooled. Next time will try without water.

It was good.  Except there was a lot of juice. I did bake it for 10 minutes longer to thicken the sauce but it didn't help.  Other than that the taste was pretty good.

I used less water (as other reviews said it was to wet) and my sauce was sticky.  I will follow the recipe fully next time.  It was flavorful,  delicious and easy to make . Always looking for new recipes. This was a good one, thanks for sharing.

Made a few substitutions and  added some other flavors.   The basic recipe was fantastic as it covered and stuck to the chicken!!   I froze the leftover sauce to use later!!

No changes.  The sauce was very thin.  I think there was too much water.  I'll try again following other reviewers ideas.  Maybe Sweet Baby Ray or other BBQ sauce instead of Ketchup and less water.  Also removing the cover and cooking longer to thicken the sauce.
I like the idea and appreciate the recipe.

I made this and it is very good. I followed instructions exactly except I doubled the sauce. The sauce was too thin just like others said it would be even after following instructions and cooking, uncovered, for an extra 15 minutes. So I mixed two table spoons of corn starch with two table spoons of cold water and mixed it into the sauce and baked that an extra 15 minutes to thicken it up. I could have done this in a sauce pan on the stove top as well.

The hubster and I enjoyed them. I followed Dar's recommendation to put half the sauce on and then the rest after a half an hour. I eventually did double the sauce recipe and baked the wings uncovered for an extra 15 mins as the 'cook notes' to get that baked on bbq look.

I left out the water as many others here suggested, and used apple cider vinegar plus a couple of shakes of onion powder. This was an excellent base, not very sweet at all and my wife didn't complain about the vinegar which she hates. It was a bit mild for me so next time I'll add some fire.

A really easy to prepare dish and incredibly tasty. However, because there was that much liquid to the dish, the chicken was swimming in liquid, which likely kept it very moist. Next time, I will halve the liquid so that the chicken will brown more completely.

I came across this last night and had all the ingredients so I figured i'd try it out......BEST OVEN BBQ EVER! I added onion and garlic powder to the mixture. My family loved it AND I'll never buy bbq sauce again. I plan to make this mixture , reduce it down in a pot and tuck it in the fridge. DELICIOUS!!!!!!

I actually made up this sauce and threw it all in my slow cooker because I didn't have an hour in the evening to wait for it to cook. Once we got home I took them out, placed them in a baking dish and basted them a few times while broiling to crisp up the skin and it was delicious!

Just made this, was delicious! After reading comments, I used less water, used skinless drum sticks, added whole cloves of garlic split in two, baby potatoes cut in two, baby onions cut in two. Used less brown sugar and added maple syrup, with saracha hot sauce and cayenne pepper for some kick.  I took the remaining sauce and boiled it down on stove top for a dipping sauce.   Will definelty be doing this again.

I think the key here is to omit the water and reduce the vinegar to 1/4 cup.  I  just baste the chicken legs and cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes then removeed the foil and pour the remaining sauce over the chicken legs.  I baste every 10 minutes and I even turned the chicken at this point and the sauce becomes thicker and thicker.  This chicken was delish.  Promise.

Made this with my wife last week and we have another batch in the oven as I write this. Absolutely amazing taste but we did skip the water in the recipe.

The other modification we did is that we had it covered for first 30 mins but uncovered for the remainder. We also kept baisting the drumsticks with sauce every 10 mins or so.

Will definitely do this on more occasions and even use the sauce for wings.

5 stars!

Good recipe.  Next time I'd eliminate or cut down the amount of water.  I ended up basting them a few times as they were cooking to try to get more of the sauce to stick to the chicken.  Also, I spaced it (not my best day in the kitchen) and forgot to add the dry mustard and chili powder to the sauce so I sprinkled it on the chicken and again after turning them over half way thru the cooking time.  The aroma that filled the house as these were baking was amazing!  I will make this again.  Might put under the broiler at the end to crisp them up a bit.

I did not have dry mustard so I did omit it, I did however have liquid alder smoke on hand and added 6 drops, I also added two teaspoons of Sambal Oelek and a quarter yellow onion. I mixed it all up in the ninja mixer with the rest of the suggested ingredients which purified the onion into the sauce. After laying out the 12 drumsticks in the pan I sprinkled two of drops of Franks Red Hot Sauce on each drum. It wasn't really all that spicy but had a subtly warmth, tasted fantastic. I have now been requested to cook this again, so the review is due to the demand for repetition.

Delicious flavor! Kids loved it, and so did the kitten who pilfered and demolished a drumstick larger than herself, followed by a nice long nap. There is really no reason to add so much water. I will definitely make this sauce again without the added water, and will reduce the salt a bit since there will be no dilution.

This was really, really easy and quite tasty.  We did not find it sweet at all.  I followed the recipe, but omitted the water as other reviewers suggested.  I also threw in a clove of garlic.  I did cover the chicken for 45 minutes and then left it uncovered for another half hour.  The chicken was still tender, definitely cooked all the way through, and the sauce was thick.  This is going to be a regular at our house.

The whole family enjoyed the drumsticks - that doesn't always happen!!  After I baked them for an hour under the foil they weren't charred at all so I took the foil off and baked them for about 10-15 mins more.  I wanted to get them even crispier so I broiled them for a few minutes each side until they got charred a little bit more.  I also only used half the chili powder next time I'll use the entire amount to give it some zest.  

Definitely worth trying again.

A very easy and tasty dish when grilling isn't an option. I used 10 chicken legs, omitted the water and used white wine vinegar. I also chose to remove the foil after 30 minutes of cooking to thicken the sauce and brown the chicken a bit more. I basted the chicken with a spoon when I removed the foil and once more during the last 30 minutes of cooking. I also let the dish sit in the oven an extra 10 minutes with the oven off. The chicken was very moist and tender. I  will definitely make this again.

This has become an easy go to for dinner. I made the sauce a few times, but we like Head Country better on the legs. It also works just as well on wings and they tend to cook faster.

I made these yesterday, and followed a few reviewers' suggestions. They came out great! Most importantly, I did not add the water and I did not cover the chicken with foil. I only used half of the amount of brown sugar called for (so I only used 2 Tablespoons of brown sugar) and I added 2 Tablespoons of honey. I also added a dash of tobasco sauce. The chicken came out delicious and moist - and the sauce came out super sticky and flavorful (just how we like it).

This was great. A very simple way to make a lot of BBQ chicken and not have to watch it. I made 12-14 drumsticks so I doubled the sauce recipe except for the salt. There's plenty of salt in ketchup. I also did include the water although the video mentioned they did not. The sauce was perfect. The only recipe change I made was to sprinkle poultry seasoning on the chicken before I added the sauce. We personally do not like super thick BBQ sauce. I always add about 1 Tbl. or more of water to bottles of store bought sauce. It thickened up just right til the chicken was done. Also a great way to make larger batches of chicken for parties. You can always throw it on the grill for a few minutes just before serving. We will definitely make this again and again.

This is one of the best recipes that I've tried in awhile. My husband was so impressed with this dinner and my toddler ate two pieces of chicken (that means a lot)! 
The only small changes that I made was that I used chicken thighs. I split them in two and had drumsticks and thighs as my cuts of meats. I liked this a lot more than just using drumsticks.
I also added freshly chopped garlic to the sauce because we love garlic around here! I covered the chicken with the tinfoil for half the cooking time and then removed the foil for the other half, allowing the chicken to crisp up and the sauce to thicken. 
The sauce tasted delicious on the rice that I served it with. A side of broccoli rounded the whole thing out and we really enjoyed it. My toddler loved the sauce, even with the spicy kick to it.
My husband demanded that I add this recipe into our every day dinner rotation! I didn't disagree!

I'm not sure what I did wrong but I really didn't care for this recipe. I thought it was bland and also thought the chicken was tough. I followed the advice of others and didn't add the water either.

This was absolutely delicious! I didn't have dry mustard on hand so I used a couple of squirts of regular mustard and it was still very good. I will be making this again!

Loved this. Was fast and easy to make, with cheap ingredients that I already had. I did cook for the extra 10-20 min as suggested, and it was falling off the bone good. The sauce was thin, but I used it as gravy on mashed potatoes, and then saved it and added it to a rice dish I made the next day. Omg good!! Also as suggested I did throw a spoonful of minced garlic in there, but otherwise followed exact recipe.

I didn't have worc.  sauce so I substituted with steak sauce. I also substituted the dry mustard with yellow, squeeze mustard. I also cooked uncovered in the broiler 25 min. per side and then cooked covered  for 10 more minutes. My chicken came out just like the photo in the recipe.

Gave three stars since I did not follow the recipe exactly. Made with honey instead of brown sugar and did not add water. Also, I did not cover the chicken so the sauce caramelized the skin! Delicious and easy.

This was very tasty.  I've made it twice. The first time just as the recipe instructed.  The 2nd time with tomato paste instead of ketchup since I was out of ketchup.  Both ways turned out tasty and the paste made it thicker.  It is true that it is more of a broth style sauce, but know that going in and you won't be disappointed.  The flavor is delish and I added it to my recipe box.

These are very flavorful! My family loved it. I added three cloves of garlic to the sauce. The sauce is more like a broth though so I just made some of the BBQ sauce on the side omitting the water and brushed it on after cooking. Very delicious! :)

Tangy and tasty. But do NOT add the water. Without the water it's the perfect consistency; with it, it will not stick on the chicken. I added a clove a crushed garlic which was a nice addition. Mine wasn't cooked in an hour. I cooked an hour, and then uncovered and cooked for an additional half an hour.

Waaaaay too much water! After cooking, the drums are swimming in what looks like broth -- no consistency whatsoever. The "sauce" isn't even that flavorful. I fixed it by brushing it with Sweet Baby Ray's and putting it back in for another 10 minutes. Cooking time seemed to be pretty accurate though.

cooked like 16 wings so I added more water which resulted in less thick sauce; my girl & I poured some of the sauce out and added barbecue sauce to the recipe to thicken it...returned a small portion to the dish to cook the chicken off and it came out pretty good.  next time I'll follow recipe to a T or add barbecue sauce

We liked the recipe. It's easy and tasty, but I don't think it needed the 1/2 c of water, as the sauce was quite thin.  Also, the next time I make it, I'll only add 1/8 brown sugar, as it was a bit too sweet for us.

The recipe was delicious! I do have to agree that the sauce turned out quite watery. I also decided to scale back on the suggested amount of butter and sugar and it still turned out to be a crowd pleaser. I will definitely make this again with less water and removing the foil half-way through. Thank you!

My family loved this, my son said " save that recipe Mom" My only additions were 2 tsp. Garlic salt, and 4 dashes of Texas Pete. I removed the foil after 30 minutes, & cooked an additional 45 minutes. I let cool for about 15 minutes to thicken sauce. Um yum this is good .

don't add water to this recipe, for the chicken you bought at the store has enough in it already. the author probably used free range chicken, that wasn't injected with water. stores do this to make the chicken weigh more which means you pay more. so don't blame the author or anyone else because you didn't think before rating this recipe.

Wonderful flavor and so easy. I followed the advice of other reviewers: omitted the water and didn't cover. I also added a little liquid smoke flavor. I'll be making this often!

Disappointed I read several reviews before preparing this today and decided to omit the water like others stated. Also uncovered halfway in and let cook an extra 10 minutes, but the sauce never thickened. Consistency of water. I wish I had added cornstarch but the sauce did have a thickness to it before baking so I decided not to. Wish it had worked out, because the sauce DID smell and taste very good, just didnt stay on the meat.

Delicious. I read the other comments  most didn't use the water I did and I didn't cover it either. I put half of the sauce first cooked it for 30 min and flipped it and put the rest of the sauce after poking  holes in the chicken cooked it for an extra hour flipping it every 30 min the sauce was nice and thick the chicken was nice and tender and the family was happy. I will never use bbq sauce out the bottle again loved it

Just made this for supper and it was a huge hit, even with my fussy four and two year olds.  I did add the water to the sauce but omitted the butter and salt.  Also left the cover off for the entire cooking time.  Perfect!  The sauce thickened up and was excellent over mashed potatoes.  The chicken was crispy, moist and fell off the bone.  The best part was it was so EASY.  Just whisk a few things together, pour over chicken and stick in the oven.  Couldn't ask for anything better.

Wow! How easy is this! I followed the recipe exactly as written, and then followed the suggestions that were listed in the reviews (to take the foil off at the half-way point, and to cook 10-15 minutes extra. The liquidy sauce (which I was concerned about) thickened up right at the end, and the chicken came right off the bone. A keeper.

We tripled the recipe and only used 1/2 cup of water.  When we baked it we baked for 30 mins covered and then we broiled for 5 minutes.  Also, we used half the sauce when we baked it then the other half when we broiled it.

I loved these drumsticks! They are so good and succulent and the sauce is thick and sticky. My family wants to keep this recipe. Served it over rice and had some chili beans on the side. Thank you for the recipe!

While I normally prefer a thicker, tangier and spicier sauce on my bird, this was a good tasting recipe and a total hit in the household! I tweaked mine with garlic salt and extra "scorch" -- it was licious-de! Recommended.

I've made this twice: once in the oven and once in the crock pot. Both times were amazing for different reasons. In the oven, they came out perfect moist and delicious, but in the crock pot it was literally falling off the bones! Which was fine but kind of defeats the purpose of drumsticks haha

Even my picky Eater ate it! Definitely in the running!   I liked tthat the sauce was not thick.  Non-BBQ sauce  and BBQ sauce eaters alike loved it!  If you want it thick cut out the water!  I made it as is(except only half the chilli powder KIDS) and it was great!

I made this tonight and we loved it. I did add a bit of minced garlic to my mixture and omitted the water(suggested by other reviewers). The sauce thickened and was very flavorful. Thank You!

After reading other reviews I omitted the water completely.  I did not have Worcestershire sauce so I just added some onion powder, garlic powder and pepper. I also added some cayenne.  I baked for 30 minutes covered, flipped and ladled sauce onto of chicken and then 30 minutes uncovered. The sauce never thickened up and was very soupy. Before serving I ladled more sauce on top of drumsticks. My family loved the chicken  and it was very moist and juicy/ fall off the bone. Just wish the sauce would have thickened up.

I agree with leaving out the water.    The sauce was O.K.   My kids didn't really like it.   Said it would be better to use a bottled sauce.   I followed the recipe exactly, except for leaving out the water.

The liquid had a nice flavor, but TOO MUCH WATER! With all of that water then covering to bake, it just boiled the chicken. If you're going to make this, leave the water out, maybe add a tablespoon or two if you need to and I wouldn't leave it covered all throughout the cooking. I left mine uncovered for the last 30 minutes and the only bits that had some half decent flavor were the ones that weren't touching the boiling liquid.

My husband and friends thought these came out delicious! I only added about half the water, and poured all the sauce over the chicken. I cooked uncovered, flipped the chicken half way, and then broiled on high for the last 10 minutes to crisp up the skin. The sauce thickened just fine and came out really tasty. They didn't come off the bone as easily as I would have liked though, they could have used about 15 more minutes in the oven.

Good recipe with some minor tweaks.  I cut the brown sugar down to 2T and the salt to 1 tsp.  I omitted the water, but added a splash of low sodium chicken broth to the sauce to thin it out slightly right before coating the chicken.  I also heeded the advice of other reviewers and cooked it 30 minutes covered and then 45 minutes uncovered.  I flipped the chicken twice while it was uncovered.  The drumsticks came out really juicy and flavorful.  I think next time though I will leave out the salt altogether.  This is a great recipe when you need to put something together quickly as I had all the sauce ingredients on hand already.

The sauce was way too runny. However, my little brother liked it. I believe in second chances, so I may alter the recipe next time. ------- Next Time: This was amazing! I just cut down a little on the water and the vinegar, and used regular mustard instead of the powder, and the sauce didn't turn out too runny.

This was an absolutely fantastic meal!!  Usually I do not rate recipes but this one deserved it!  I did not use water as it would have been way too thin!  I did add a tsp of garlic because my family loves garlic.  Other than those two tiny changes, we left the recipe as is and followed all directions to a tee!  We will definitely be doing this again!!!

Don't let the 3 stars fool you. This is a great meal. I honestly didn't make the sauce that they made for theirs. I substituted it with a BBQ sauce that I already know I like. It still cooked great and tasted amazing. I'm giving it a 3/5 because the sauce recipe can be difficult if you are new to cooking (like myself). If you know you wont mess up then that's great. If you're unsure like me then substitute your own already made sauce from the store.

These fell right off the bone but only because I cooked them for 1.5 hrs.  The last five minutes I removed the cover.  To the mixture I added, 1 fresh chopped green pepper, fresh garlic, ground pepper and onion powder.  Also used Whole Foods chicken legs and was totally able to tell the difference from Perdue and all others.  These were delicious!!!!!

Not a bad mix for a sauce (though the water is not needed as other commenters mentioned). I had to bake the chicken for about 20min longer after uncovering to brown. 
This recipe is a good template. Next time I'll use my imagination more, probably switch out honey for the sugar, add more pepper, a splash of soy sauce.

Really liked this recipe.  I didn't put water in it and should have used at least 1/4 cup, but loved the flavors, added a little granulated garlic.  Will probably double the sauce recipe next time.  May also use half splenda brown sugar and reg brown sugar to help with calories.  Thank you!  It's a keeper!!!

I LOVED this!  The only change I made to the original recipe was I left out the water (based on the reviews I read).  Also, i didn't have dry mustard on hand so I substituted it with regular mustard (1 tsp dry mustard equals 1 TBSP prepared mustard).  DELICIOUS.  Thank you for sharing!

I removed the skin from the drumsticks and omitted the salt and the butter.  I uncovered halfway through the cooking time.  I thought the sauce was fantastic, though thin.  Next time I'll cut the water to 1/4 cup.

Horrible! If I could have given this 0 stars I would have. I made this recipe as written and I should have gone with other reviewers and not used any water. I ended up with broth instead of sauce even with taking the foil off half way through the cooking time to try to thicken up the sauce. Won't be making this again.

It works wonderfully as written and we often do it precisely as described. However, for extra kick I put four partly mashed garlic cloves in the bowl and sprinkle chicken with either chilli powder or tabasco before covering with foil.

This was a hit with my family, including the three- and five-year-old. There was quite a lot of sauce, so I added two cans of white beans on a whim during the last 15 minutes, and it came out quite well! Next time I may try adding soaked dry beans at the beginning and cooking everything together, maybe with a bit more water.

I made this tonight and it went over very well with my kids and husband.  I didn't add the water and it didn't need it.  I added 1tsp chili powder.  Great recipe, will make again, thanks!
