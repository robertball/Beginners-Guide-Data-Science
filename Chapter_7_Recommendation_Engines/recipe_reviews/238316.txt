First off, I don't use unfermented soy products due to the estrogen content in soy. I used a can of Trader Joe's light coconut milk in place of the soy milk, used Fage plain Greek yogurt in place of the tofu, juiced 2 cups each of pineapple and cantaloupe, juiced 1/2 a lime and substituted organic agave syrup for the coconut flavoring because I used coconut milk. I blended all ingredients in a pitcher and poured into a dozen large Popsicle molds for "juice bars". Oh, my goodness- this has become my favorite way to get cantaloupe into my diet! Such a delicious tropical frozen treat for hot summer days! My 14-year-old (who hates coconut ANYTHING) said these were her favorite Popsicles I've made and requested more!

5.14.16   Added some crushed ice, since we like our smoothies thicker.  Next time, I'll also freeze the cantaloupe.  The combination of fresh pineapple, lime juice, cantaloupe, and the coconut extract is an awesome combination.  Don't skip the coconut extract, IMO that's what really gives this smoothie that "tropical" flavor.
