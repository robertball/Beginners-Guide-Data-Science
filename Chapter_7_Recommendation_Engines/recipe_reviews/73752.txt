Seven or eight stars!  The best yellow squash recipe EVER.  I didn't have the jalapeno peppers, but I added a green bell pepper instead.  Both me and my husband went over the moon!  Thnk you, 
Ann Girl!

This is a good recipe, however, I prefer it with garlic added and without the soy sauce and jalapenos.

Loved this squash.  Just different enough from our usual, but will go with so many dishes.  I used poblano instead of jalapenos since we're a little wimpy about too much heat.  Thanks, Ann.

Prepared this as written, including the unusual addition (at least for me) of the fresh, chopped jalapenos - but I couldn't resist adding some fresh, minced garlic too. Colorful and delicious, even though the soy sauce kind of dulled the vibrant, fresh yellow color of the squash. The taste by adding it, however, made up for its somewhat compromised appearance. Loved the addition of the jalapenos, which provided a splash of color and interest more than it did taste. And, as is usually the case, bacon makes it even better! Nice, creative twist on the same ol' squash.

Just made this dish, and I love it!  Hubby tried it, and liked it also, but not one of his faves.  I tweeked it a little, adding some garlic salt and onion powder, also replaced jalapeno with a small cayenne pepper minced up.  All in all, very good side dish, will probably make it again :)

I have to give this recipe 4 stars only because I made modifications.  I sauteed onions, yellow squash, and zucchini in bacon drippings.  Then I seasoned it with Mrs. Dash seasoning spice and a dash of salt.  I'll try the original recipe soon.

My husband, the veggie hater, asked me to make this again - a miracle! I loved it, too. I did add three cloves of garlic, used turkey bacon and a bit of sesame oil and used salt and pepper rather than soy sauce. Delicious.

I liked this one a lot.  It was nice to have a new way to cook squash.  I didn't have any bacon, but I used salt pork in my skillet with a little olive oil.  I think the final result was pretty close.  I didn't add any soy sauce because it tasted so good without it.  I loved the extra spice the jalapeno gave it, but didn't make it too spicy.

I thought this was delicious.  I used a serrano pepper instead of jalapeno because I had an abundance of them and I did add some minced garlic.

Simply wonderful. "Thinly sliced" is the message here; something like 1/8-inch is ideal, no thicker, please. Not to worry, the drippings from 2 slices of bacon is not too much fat. You may prefer, as do I, to fry your bacon over moderate heat, but high heat works best for the vegetables. Cook just until you sure the squash is tender but not wilted. I had some ends of yellow and red bell peppers, which I also "thinly sliced," and they may an easy addition without upsetting the recipe and iota. I'll do this again. Thanks!

Very good!  Made as written, without jalapeño.  Cannot wait to make this again with jalapeños from the garden, maybe some more bacon and soy sauce too.

I love when I come upon a recipe and try it even though my first reaction is, "What the HECK?!"  I never would have thought to combine these ingredients.  But I had a squash that needed to get used and I apparently was feeling adventuresome.  SO GLAD!  This is definitely one of my all-time favorite vegetable dishes.  The combination of jalapeno and bacon, as well as the splash of soy combine to make something very tasty and unique.  Thanks to Ann_Girl for sharing!

Yummy! Great change from just basic fried squash. I used a light green summer squash and 1 small red hot pepper and 1/2 of an aneheim.

This was a great way to cook squash. A huge change from the usual way it gets prepared (butter and brown sugar). I am not sure if the recipe needs a little tweaking to add more flavor or if our squash was just totally flavorless (hard to tell since I usually avoid squash). I did notice the soy sauce had gotten a stronger taste from the portion that was not served out of the pan. I may prep this first and let it sit on a warm burner so it can soak in a little more next time.

This was much better than I expected.  I substituted turkey bacon fried in a tablespoon of canola oil, lite soy sauce and lemon pepper.  Will definitely cook again.

Delicious and a good way to use up summer squash. I left out the bacon, but used lots of jalepenos and onions. Very popular at the family BBQ!

I used 4 slices of center cut bacon (more bacon, less fat).  I added 1 clove of garlic and sauted the onion and garlic first in the bacon grease, and then added a medium squash (seeded), a medium zucchini (seeded), 1/4 of a jalapeno chopped fine and 4 oz. of baby portabella mushrooms.  After sauting for 8-10 minutes, I added a little chicken broth and covered it until the veggies were just tender.  I removed the cover, drained the liquid and stirred in the bacon.  I put cheddar cheese on top and covered until it melted.  We all really liked it, even my kids!

Super yummy!  The yellow squash (and everything else) from my garden is starting to come in now, and we just came home from a week at camp to find tons of it!  So this fit the bill as an awesome side dish with pesto pasta for dinner.  The only change I made was adding a little of my cilantro also.

DEFINITELY going to be a a new regular dish in our home! I substituted for turkey bacon, but next time I won't. Good stuff, easy..I had a lot of uncooked squash and onions, so I bagged it and will toss it into the pan and make it happen when I'm ready to

I've been making something similar to this for years. I fry the bacon, remove, then add the squash and onions and cook till everything is tender. Then I add fresh spinach and roasted garlic..out of this world!  Even thought about adding fresh green chile, but passed, maybe next time.

omitted the pepper and soy.  Pretty much used this recipe to build on.  cooked 4 strips of bacon not too crisp, removed excess bacon grease, cooked 1/2 red onion diced, six sweet peppers, 1/2 bag of mixed squash trimmed until soft but still firm, then cut up the bacon and cooked another minute to mix flavors and rewarm the bacon.  Did not add soy, salt or pepper.  The serving bowl was scrapped clean, says it all.

This was good, but WAY too hot. I don't know if I just got a really hot jalapeno or what, but it was spicy! Also I feel that the recipe should warn people to wear gloves when chopping fresh jalapeno. I've never done it before and my hands (and face unfortunately) were burning all night, even though I washed my hands right after chopping. Again, really hot jalapeno. I will definitely be making this again, but maybe with pickled jalapeno instead or half a jalapeno.

This was great!  I followed the recipe exactly as written and it turned out fantastic!  We grew the squash in our garden and used 2 good sized specimens.  The rest came from Kroger.  I did use Marzetta jalapenos, 2 tablespoons or so because they didn't have fresh peppers when I was there.  Even my husband, who has always said he hated yellow squash ate this up!  We will definitely try it again!  Thanks!

I made this just as directed and we grown-ups really liked it! The kids hated it, but after some discussion, we think that they didn't like the texture, but thought the flavor was fine. I will make this again, but I think I'll leave out the bacon and try tossing the squash in with a tiny bit of olive oil and try to make it a little crispier.

My 6 year old and I love these! The tric is to cook them until they're not crunchy but aren't yet mush.  I put them in for ~10 minutes or when the cheese is just starting to brown a little.

This was really delicious and a great way to use up my yellow squash from the garden.  I used minced red onion and cut back on the jalapenos (personal preference).  Super fast side dish!

This turned out well.  We ate some using the recipe given, then decided to add some cheese to it.  (Grated mexican blend.)  We loved it with the added cheese.  Will make again.

Holy cow, this was good! And I'm not a big fan of squash, either! We did tweak it a little. We added some butter to the bacon drippings, some garlic powder and we used teriyaki sauce instead of soy sauce (just a little sweeter). Plus, we used probably 3 to 4 times the amount of teriyaki (soy) that the recipe called for. I COULD NOT STOP eating it! Making it again tonight. Folks, this is "restaurant" good!

This was really good! I didn't add jalapenos because my main dish had them, but I did add some minced garlic and did everything else as written. Even my husband, who does not normally like squash, said it wasn't that bad :)

I used turkey bacon, 3 md squash, 1 md onion, s&p and basil. I didn't use a jalapeno or soy sauce and it tasted great!!!!   I made sure those onions are caramelized then added the squash and covered for about 15 minutes. Then re-added bacon basil and s&p.

I made one serving and had this all to myself for dinner last night.  It didn't look pretty (I don't know how they get those great photos), but it tasted great.  I skipped the jalepeno, but did do the soy sauce.  I also added some garlic in with with the squash and a little Mrs. Dash for some more spice.  It made a great, light, dinner.

I used 1/2 of the jalapeno & doubled the bacon. Very good altho I can't taste the soy sauce at all so I'm not sure what that adds. Regardless, we liked it very much.

Wow, so good that you know all that bacon grease must be bad for you.  Remind me next time to take about half the fat out before adding veggies. Did not have a jalapeno or soy sauce, but salt and pepper did just fine.

this was so great! it is amazing how far a little soy sauce can go in terms of flavoring! i didn't have a jalapeno so i left it out, and i used a shallot instead of a regular onion. i will definitely make this again sometime this summer, probably with the jalapeno pepper to give it some "kick."

This tasted great but I added some things and omitted others. I used REAL BACON pieces in a pouch, just heated it up in oil to get bacon flavor. I cubed squash and added shredded carrots. I used onions like the recipe called for. I omitted soy sauce b/c it smelled delicious without it. Would definitely make again. I also used this stuff called  JANES CRAZY mixed up salt for extra flavor!

This is a very easy and tasty way to prepare squash.  My kids seem to eat anything with bacon.  I drained most of the bacon grease out of the pan and omitted the salt.

I cooked this one with a salmon recipe for my 3 1/2 yr old son, husband and a houseguest. (Even our picky son ate it!) It was really easy and we all loved it! I also substituted green pepper because jalepeno's weren't readily available. Many rave reviews!

I'm allergic to bell peppers so I did not use bell peppers but just the bacon in the squash and I added diced onion with a little salt and pepper it turned out really soggy on The Middle and quite chewy on the outside like it wasn't cooked but it also was very greasy and unfortunately even with the bacon it did not have much of a taste to I plan on giving it a try again but probably not immediately

We love this recipe. I think it is the touch of soy sauce at the end that makes it great! You can adjust it to your liking. I didn’t have bacon so substituted with butter. Mushrooms and garlic are a nice addition. The  jalapeño pepper provided the right amount of spice. I have made this recipe three times in the last week.

Less bacon would have suited us better.  It was overbearing to the squash and onions.

Very good!  I used zucchini and yellow squash together and no type of pepper.  Will definitely make again.

Fantastic dish! I doubled the bacon though and it was incredible! I also added a dash of  olive oil with the soy. My husband loved it as well!

Disappointed.  Not the flavors that I expected.  Too bland for me.  Nice texture and presentation.  Will be experimenting with this dish because I do see potential for veggie lovers.

Really loved this but I changed it around a little. I left out the soy sauce and Jalapeno and added Banana peppers instead and it turned out great.

I thought this was delicious and my husband liked it but still prefers my old recipe!  I did not have soy sauce nor jalapeños although I improvised with only 3-4 chopped slices from the jar!  I would definitely make this again!  Next time I might try adding some garlic as a couple of reviewers suggested!

I’m eating this dish now and it’s really good! I’m giving 5 stars because I didn’t make it exact, and that’s not fair. I only had a little bacon, and I eat most of it while it cooks haha. The squash cooks down so don’t hesitate to fill the skillet! I used jalapeños from a jar and diced them. I sprinkled sharp cheddar on top when I plated it. Thanks for a good dish!

I liked it. i used the whole onion and let it sweat a bit before I added squash. I used one green zucchini for added color and used a poblano pepper because jalapenos are a bit too spicy for me.

This was a very good recipe, however I did not have jalapenos to add to this dish. I imagine it would be very tasty with them. Just be careful - this dish can be EXTREMELY salty (soy sauce, bacon, salt to taste...). Next time I make it I will not add any more salt.

This is a really tasty recipe for a bland veggie, which is in abundance right now. It was quick & easy. I substituted with pickled jalapeno & teriyaki, which was what I had available tonight, and I'm sure it had little effect on the already flavorful recipe.  I did seed the jalapeno, which you might want to do, so it won't overwhelm the other flavors. I'll be making this often. Thank you Ann!

We liked it at our house and will no doubt be using again as the squash is coming in fast. Next time though, I will put the squash in after the onions and pepper is about right so squash doesn't get too soft!

Great recipe. Instead of the jalapeño peppers I used green bell pepper. And disregarded the soy sauce. Adding the crumbled bacon was delicious. This is now my go to squash recipe. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is Delicious! I love squash anyway but the bacon made it awesome. I removed most of the bacon drippings and used a little bit of olive oil.

Really really enjoy this quick and easy dish!  I made this with turkey bacon, adding 4 slices instead of 2.  In keeping this light I ate this as a main dish with a couple slices of the turkey bacon with it.  the soy just gives it a hint of different flavor and was very tasty. added garlic as others suggested and omitted jalapenos I did not have any.  will surely make again!  thanks!

You cannot make yellow squash any better than this! My wife and I loved it. I added the chopped jalapeño. It was so great. Just remember you are cutting it thin, so it only needs to be on the skillet (I used cast iron) for 10-15 mins max.

I made this tonight. It is portent to watch the time on the squash--mushy is just a minute past tender-crisp. Three of the four of us enjoyed it, with the 12-year-old saying he likes it grilled better.

Wow! I normally don't even like yellow squash, and this was awesome! We had a homegrown jalapeno to use, so it was a perfect recipe to try. I cut the bacon up and left it in the recipe, and my husband loved it. This is going to be my go-to dish when I have fresh squash around, and it's in season at the same time as the jalapenos here where I live. Thank you, Ann_Girl, for this wonderful side dish.

I loved this recipe as a quick go-to for home grown winter squash! I also incorporated home-grown Jalapeños! 
The soy sauce added just enough of salt and and element of stir-fry that  created a basic, yet incorporated side. 
As for the "Most Helpful Critical Review" - if you happen to have bacon grease around from breakfast burritos or whatnot, recycling the bacon in use with vegetable as a side dish on a HEALTHY main plate - this is the recipe. 
I personally used a lean bacon that I found at Whole Foods (no unnecessary additives , or hormones) and it felt balanced with a whole grain, and grilled meat - clean eating at its finest!

My wife and I really enjoyed this recipe but... removed seeds from jalapeno and added jalapeno Tabasco for intense jalapeno flavor without the heat. Also added a lot more soy sauce which really kicked up the flavor. Love the base ingredients for this dish. Will make again and again. Thanks! July 24,2014

I made this exactly by the recipe and, to be honest, we weren't that crazy about it. My husband didn't like the jalapeno in it...he said it was too hot, and didn't belong in a squash recipe. I think we both would just prefer regular fried yellow squash over this.

I needed to use up some squash and saw this recipe.  I omitted the bacon and added freshly, sliced garlic (5 cloves), 1/2t of oregano,1t of of agave, and a can of diced tomatoes.  After stir-frying, I mixed this with some quinoa and served with a salad.  Delish!

This is a simple and tasty side dish. I left out the jalapeno since I don't like them, but otherwise I followed the recipe exactly. As someone else pointed out, the grease of 2 slices of bacon is nothing to be concerned about. It is really very little grease but adds flavor. I will be doing this again.

I just made this last night and it was delicious. I did not add the jalapeno pepper.  I used teriyaki marinade & sauce instead of soy sauce.  I seasoned with garlic pepper.  My family really loved it. I will definitely be using this recipe in the future.

Cooked this tonight for a church potluck tomorrow. I had frozen sliced squash rather than fresh, and jumped the gun a little by adding the 3 bags to the pot all at once.  Result was so much water cooked out of squash and onions, that they weren't firm at all by the time they were done.  Ended up adding extra s&p, soy sauce, and some Slap Ya Mama seasoning.  I think they were good, and hope next time they come out a little more firm.  I'm sure it was user error this time, as I don't cook squash often. Still good though!

So good! I had never cooked squash before, and this was simple and tasty. I used turkey bacon and butter flavored non-stick spray. I also used jarred jalapenos because I didn't have fresh. The squash turned out spicy and delicious! This will be my go-to recipe for cooking squash!

easy and tasty -- added pablona pepper since I didn't have jalapeno (mainly just added color)...  my hubby and i really liked the bacon and onion flavor....didn't really taste the soy sauce and I did put 2 pretty decent spashes.  I think I'll add a little garlic next time like others suggested.

Awesome with a few additions. I cooked as recommended. I also added garlic, and  1/2 beef bullion cube. The bullion cube beefed up the taste! Definitely will make again and again. I gave it four stars because I had to add a few items to make it delicious.

This was good, but really lacked something.  I didn’t think of it at the time, but in hind sight I think Parmesan cheese would have given this the added zip it needed.  I did skip the “dash” of soy sauce because I really didn’t think it would add much to this.  Very colorful, especially since I used a red jalapeno pepper, which really made for a nice contrast.

This was really good! A nice twist on plain old yellow squash. I would suggest that if you do not like things spicy, do not add the jalapeno. I love spiciness but it really adds a lot of heat and distracts from the rest of the flavors. The combination of the squash, bacon and onion was very tasty on its own without the jalapeno. Will definitely be making this again. Thanks for sharing.

This recipe is really yummy. I didn't have any jalapeno so used a dash of hot pepper flakes. I'll try it again sometime with the jalapeno. I did add some garlic and just served the soy sauce on the side which I didn't put on mine as I didn't need the additional sodium. I'll try it again sometime as printed.
