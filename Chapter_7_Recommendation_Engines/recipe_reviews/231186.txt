I made this as directed with all the ingredients as listed. I, too, felt adding the ketchup after everything else was blended helped. The red pepper was a bit too spicy for me but exactly right for the hubby. Will definitely make this again and will half the red chile pepper.

I enjoyed this recipe.   I think the most important part is the simmering before adding the ketchup.  That really helped the flavors.   I will do that again.   I do like the heat and smokiness of a chipotle or chipotle sauce in BBQ so I may exchange the liquid smoke next time.  This is a good starting point and excellent method.

This sauce had all the ingredients I look for in a good bbq sauce, but this didn't quite do it for us.  We found it a bit heavy on the smoke factor as written, but really the problem for us was the large amount of powdered spices which left the sauce with a grainy texture and sort of pastey mouth feel.

Best BBQ sauce I ever made, I did replace some chile powder by paprika so it was not as hot, still awesome recipe!

I cut the pepper in half and omitted the red pepper as some in the household don't like the heat.Good easy recipe to prepare.  Served it chicken pieces today.

average.  too much pepper (both black and red).  Needs more smoke flavoring.  added more honey and still too spicy.  I like spice but that recipe as written will take any carefully crafted or prepared meat will be lost.

As I was out of molasses, I omitted it. I used dark brown sugar with a couple extra tblsp, instead. I also subbed Jack Daniel's for the rum, as a personal taste preference. The liquid smoke may be a little heavy for some tastes. Overall the sauce was fantastic with my homemade pulled pork butt.

Doubled the recipe.  Cut back on the red chili.  Only used 1 TBS.  Great recipe.  Let it simmer till thickened.

Perfect for ribs.  Not at all acrid after cooking which I find many bbq sauces to be.

We really liked this sauce recipe, it's very smooth, rich and has nice heat and tang.  I prepared exactly as published but halved, and did add a tablespoon of onion powder and several teaspoons of kosher salt.  I found it did not need the 30 minute cooking time, it was already very thick, so I just let it bubble a few minutes, cooled and jarred.  After 36 hours in the fridge this was delicious on grilled chicken.  Thanks for sharing your recipe with AR!

I've only just begun to try out BBQ sauce recipes.  I'm from the western piedmont/foothills area of NC so I'm used to a smoky, sweet, red BBQ sauce.  This recipe is a great place to start.  As you make it, experiment with how much spice or sweetness you prefer.  I plan to make this recipe and then divide it in half and then make one more spicy and the other one more sweet for my family who has differing tastes!

As is, this sauce is way too acidic. I had to add a ton of extra brown sugar to make it palatable. After that, however, it was great!

I've made this twice in the last two weeks and we absolutely love it!  All those various ingredients create an incredible flavor.  It's not as sweet as so many BBQ sauces are, just a very rich taste.  The red chili pepper flavor mellows over time, and although it was not too strong for us to begin with, it was much less noticeable the second day.  It is very easy to make and will be my new go to recipe for BBQ sauce.  I used about a cup to cook a pork shoulder roast in the crock pot, along with a sliced onion and diluted orange juice, and then topped the pork with the sauce when served. Yummy!  Looking forward to trying it with chicken and so many other dishes.
