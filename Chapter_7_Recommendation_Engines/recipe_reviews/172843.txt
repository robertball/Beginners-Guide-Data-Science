This is very tasty and simple to make. I have an indoor grill which worked fine for the green onions. I served this on Turkey, Bacon, and Ranch Burgers (personal recipe by Stacey) and it was delicious!

this mayo was great. at first, I was skeptical because it called for cinnamon but once made, it was great and the cinnamon added a kick of flavour. would recommend this recipe
