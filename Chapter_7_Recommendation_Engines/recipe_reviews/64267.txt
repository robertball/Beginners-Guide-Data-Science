This recipe was easy to make, but the tex-mex twist on macaroni and cheese was just too much for my husband and I.  If you like Mexican food, you might want to try it!

This was average. I doubled the wet ingredients as suggested but my kids refused to eat it.

Good taste, but nowhere near enough sauce. Dry!  But double the sauce part and you've got an easy, spicy meal without meat if you just make a nice tossed salad to go along with it.
