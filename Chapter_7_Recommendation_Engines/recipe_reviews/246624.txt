Amazing! Light & fluffy. It made 52 mini muffins. I followed others' advice and I added 1/4 c. cream, 1/2 t. salt, 1 t. vanilla, & 1/4 t. nutmeg (Next time I will change to 1/8 t...it was a bit strong, but the taste is still great!). Bake time only 11 minutes for mini muffins. I give this five stars because  it is an amazing base recipe!

These were really good.  I thought they were going to be too sweet b/c my bananas were very ripe, and the batter was sweet, but the finished product was fine.  I gave it 4 stars b/c I decided to add a tsp of vanilla and a bit of cinnamon to make it tastier.  I only cooked mine 10 min and they were perfect.

Followed recipe AND added: 1/4 cup Organic Valley Heavy Whipping Cream, 1 tsp. Nutmeg, 1 tsp.  Vanilla. Served with homemade honey-cream cheese. Huge hit, everyone LOVED them!! (Heavy cream contributed to a less dense much softer, lighter muffin; clearly, not calorie lighter!)

3.26.16   I prepared this recipe exactly as written BUT did add a couple things.  We like our banana bread with nuts, so I added some chopped walnuts.  And I had some fresh blueberries in the fridge, so I dusted them with flour and added them to a dozen of the mini muffins. And finally, I did substitute the sugar with Truvia® Baking Blend.  This is as good as any banana bread I’ve ever made, and I can see these disappearing quickly on a brunch table (well, any table really). The muffins were perfectly baked at 13 minutes, they're tender, moist and loaded with banana flavor.   cathy, thanks for sharing your recipe, it’s a winner in this house.

Absolutely delicious!!! I added cinnamon and a dash of salt. Plus used applesauce instead of eggs, and stevia instead of sugar. So yummy!! Only took 10mins.

Easy! I subbed the butter for applesauce and did a "flax-egg". I did need to add just a bit of soymilk - only because it was a little thick - which could have been due to my 2 swaps or maybe I had smallish bananas.  Who knows - I liked it & my family approved too.  It gave us 24 giant(very plump) mini-muffins.  The bake time was accurate for our oven.

Nice mini muffins. I used about ½ the amount of sugar, added a teaspoon of vanilla bean paste and some fresh blueberries.

5 stars with additions, four without.

I added 1/4 cup whole milk, 1 tsp vanilla, a slightly rounded 1/8 tsp cinnamon, a literal dash of nutmeg (strong stuff), and 1/2 tsp salt  - in short, what's recommended in the top review but with cinnamon and a little tweaking.  It's not enough to detract from the banana. Just adds some depth.

Excellent. I followed other reviewers (the cream, some salt and vanilla) and it needed 12 minutes. Stuck one big blueberry in the middle of each. Made about 36 mini muffins for me. Excellent, tasty, fluffy, and the kids loved them.

I scaled the recipe for 2 bananas.  Substituted 1 c flour with 1/3 cup each of all purpose white, whole wheat and whey isolate.  Added the cream, vanilla and cinnamon, as suggested.  Also added chopped walnuts and 1/4 tsp salt.   Baked for 12-13 minutes.  Moist, fluffy and flavourful.  Will definitely make again.

A few tweaks. 375 convection oven for 8 mins. I’m just over 2800 ft above sea level for reference. I added 1/2 tsp of cinnamon to the dry mixture. I also realized that I added 1/2 cup of melted butter instead of 1/3 cup. Delish!

Now that I have made these, only making adjustments for living at 7,000',  I adore them! Absolutely the right texture, and very moist. I think the next time I will add chopped nuts and cinnamon. Thank you for this recipe - it's a keeper.

My teenage granddaughters and their friend are absolutely in love with these  muffins.  I add chocolate chips and sometimes blueberries to the recipe.  Their last request was to make several batches so they could share them with their field hockey team.

I added chopped walnuts and a bit of nutmeg and cinnamon!

A little dry.  Bake 15 minutes would have been better

I followed some suggestions, adding nutmeg and cinnamon, and 1 tsp of vanilla. I didn't have heavy cream, so I added 1/4 C of greek yoghurt which worked well. I also substituted 3/4 C of maple syrup instead of the sugar.  These were really light and fluffy  - a wonderful texture! However, I found the baking powder taste a little strong and will try a little less next time. A good recipe.

Wow, these are great! Followed other suggestions and added cinnamon and nutmeg. 10 minutes in the oven, perfect time.

I only used 1/2 cup sugar and put in butterscotch chips. Delicious!

Amazing how good and moist these muffins are, despite the simplicity of the recipe. Even after them being left in the tin and on the countertop overnight, they were moist! No problem cooking evenly at all. I added a pinch of salt and a dash of whole milk.

I am not a fan of banana, but  I decided to make these for a work breakfast potluck. I have to say, the muffins were a hit with my son and I found them to be tasty as well.

These are super easy to make and was delicious! I added some fresh berries in the middle of each one.  I used blueberries, raspberries and cut up strawberries.
Will definitely make these again! Thanks for sharing ;)
