This recipe was delicious and with a small edit to the directions, it would be five stars for sure!  The cheeses work well together and the sausage is very flavorful (especially Johnsonville's hot Italian links which I used). The only trouble I had was that the recipe doesn't mention what to do with the 2T of oil.  This should be added in when stirring the yeast mixture into the flour mixture.  If not, you will probably have a dry crust.  This is the only necessary change to the recipe.  Also, a nice addition is to brush the outside of your crust with extra virgin olive oil mixed with dried herbs (basil, oregano, parsley, & onion powder) and add minced garlic to the sausage when cooking for extra flavor.  And I would just like to pass on a little tip on removing sausage casings: cut 3/4 of the way down lengthwise into the link and pull the casing off.  Overall, my family and I really enjoyed this, and I cannot wait to make it again!  Thanks, Johnsonville!

This is one of our favorite homemade pizza recipes.  I made a spelt flatbread crust and loved how the sausage stood out nicely with the blend of cheeses.

Directions are not clear for this recipe and many important details are left out. I have made dough using another recipe and never have an issue. With this one I left the dough for 2 hours and it did not rise at all. Had to start from scratch with my old recipe. Big waste of time!
