I am currently stuffed to the gills and I STILL want to go sneak a few more forkfuls of this.  Despite the fact it's got my dreaded "casserole" in its name, I really liked this!  Both Mr. LTH and I thoroughly enjoyed this.  It's not the most *healthy* veggie side, so I can't say for sure I'll make it often, but I do see myself making it again.  I prepped it the evening before for next day baking.  I'd fully intended to toast the bread crumbs before baking, but then i remembered I'm lazy, so I didn't (I did broil for minute at the end of baking to toast them).  THANKS for the recipe!

I love this first and foremost becaue it tastes great but also because it doesn't use canned soup, so you can control the sodium levels.  I also love how it is built in one pot.  How easy is that.

oh man, I love the combo of broccoli and cheddar, but I did not care for the sweetness of the evaporated milk, the weird texture... I added rotini pasta but aside from that, stuck to the recipe. I won't be making this one again.

It is good but nothing special. Its pretty plain. Maybe if I fried the onions in butter first before adding it would have turned out better.

This was something I might make again but not often unless I tweak a bit.  The best part was the butter toasted bread crumbs on top.  I'm thinking bacon...or serve over rice...or find the perfect spice to add.   Thank you for sharing.

I have done this with broccoli and  it is great! BUT this time I used  brussel  sprouts  and it was fantastic also. just halve or quarter the sprouts and follow  the rest of the regular directions. Yummy

Not a bad creamy broccoli casserole but it didn't really wow me  . . .it is hard to do so with this kind of casserole though as I'm not the biggest fan of creamy stuff.  About half got eaten at Christmas dinner, but we did have a ton of food, and people seemed to like it.  My biggest concern is with the method; next time, I think I'd make an actual roux as the flour and milk mixture clumped up while making it.  During baking and cooling it did thicken, but I prefer the roux method even if it dirties another pot.  Thanks for the recipe!

Praise, accolades, & recognition is what I received from my husband after making this tonight for the first time. I used less evaporated milk, added fresh garlic and some fresh jalape√±o too. Oh--I had no bread crumbs in the house, but I did have some  French Fried Onions ( like the kind you use on green been casserole). I don't even like broccoli really and even I had seconds! This will be on our dinner table again.

We really enjoyed this recipe for Christmas Dinner. My daughter is not a fan of vegetables and the cheese helped her eat "some" vegetables with her huge turkey leg this year! The rest of the family had seconds. I needed a change from the traditional string bean casserole and this was a great way to mix it up. My only issue is that the recipe called for 14 oz of evap milk and of course the cans come in 12 oz. Worked fine since I added extra broccoli anyway. Also, I doubled the bread crumb mixture, definitely not enough! :) Definitely a great recipe to try at least once to see if you like it.

Good and easy. I added cooked pasta which turned it into an excellent mac and cheese type dish.

I loved this recipe. However, I added 1 1/2 cups of cheese and salt and pepper. Delicious.

skipped cooking the bread crumbs in butter and just topped it with crumbled Ritz crackers! also used dried minced onion instead of a chopped one, it turned out absolutely delicious! one other thing I did was add an additional layer of cheese on top along with extra cracker crumbs. it was a big hit!

I have never made broccoli cheese casserole but needed to for a dinner today. I had frozen broccoli and used that instead of fresh. This was delicious! My family loved it and are requesting it to be made more! Thank you so much for this recipe!

Very easy recipe to follow. Seeing when your water boils w/the broccoli was a little hard, just keep a close eye. Otherwise very tasty and had zero leftovers.

The 12 oz can of evaporated milk is quite enough, maybe too much. It came out extra creamy and delicious. I added diced tomatoes, and next time will add some pasta, more broccoli, and more black pepper with some cayenne. Thank you for the recepie!!

This was kind of a disappointment for us. First of all the 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs was not enough to cover a casserole... so I tripled it and it kind of covered it but not completely still. It's a personal preference but my family wasn't a fan.  It was not only a taste preference but also a texture preference.
