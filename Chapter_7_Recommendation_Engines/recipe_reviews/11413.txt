Oh my goodness are these delicious!  They are also very easy to make and no baking required.  I made exactly as written - but note the 16 ounces of graham crackers.  A box is 14.5 oz.  I added 4 full crackers from another package.  These are very rich and a 13 x 9 pan makes for a thick, rich and sweet treat.  The next time I'm going to use a bigger pan and have them not so thick.  Be sure to grease your pan well and press the mixture in the pan so that it will meld together.  I waited the 4 hours to cut them, the chocolate cut nice when it was cold and the sweetened condensed milk soften the hardness of the chips.  Thanks mom2frankandy for sharing your recipe.  I made these for a Girls Night Out and they were very well received.  It will be made again.

Love, Love, LOVE this recipe.  This is the easiest thing I have ever made in my life and they are delicious.  I am planning to give these out as a gift for the holidays.  I didn't have enough peanut butter on hand...was just a little shy...so I added some Nutella.  I love these.  Will go into my keep box and be used many times more.  Thanks for the post.

Very yummy! I really like the texture the graham crackers crumbs  bring to the crust. The only change I made was to reduce the butter to 3/4 of a cup and add a couple of tablespoons of PB to compensate. I'll make these again for sure.

Very easy and tasty.  I used graham cracker crumbs (weighed the appropriate amount on a food scale) instead of whole graham crackers.  The bars are very rich and you could probably half the recipe and use an 8x8 pan and still have a decent amount of servings.  Got great reviews from the cookout I took them to.  Will make again.

Very sweet and nice, but not quite a good flavor.  Slightly too much sugar, I think.  I have another recipe that's similar and better, using no graham crackers.

My Husband Loves peanut butter/chocolate bars and after reading the reviews thought this would be a hit. However it was not, the peanut butter part was way to much and the overall dish was extremely rich. One small bar 1"x1" was all anyone would eat.

I halved the recipe but still used a 9x13 pan.  They were plenty thick.  These remind us of peanut butter balls, but quicker to make.  Yum!

Delicious.  I used a little less powdered sugar because I only had a partial bag.   I think you could get by with 14 to 16 oz. of the graham crackers.  I used the full box (16 oz) and my crust was a bit crumbly and dry in a couple spots.  No big deal.   These are really, really tasty but very rich.  Cut into small squares with a very sharp knife.

These are very good but I think they need salt to give them that flavor "punch".

Okay, this is delicious & easy.  Hard to estimate the crackers because the boxes are 14.5 oz now.  I used 2 sleeves & a couple extra.  I made these this morning and messed up by adding the condensed milk to the graham cracker mixture.  Oops...I put them in the refrigerator anyway and hoped for the best.  They turned out great.  I made a simple ganache (1/2c cream, 1/2c butter & 1 c choc chips) to top.  I may make it like this from now on because I'm definitely making these again.

This recipe was a favorite with our five kids.  Chilled for about a half hour and then cut because I wasn't sure how hard they were going to set.  It worked out perfectly.  next time I will try using a little less crumbs so the mixure for the bottom will be a little creamier. Also used milk choco chips.  Will make again.  Easy, quick finger food.

I made this for work, but the graham cracker mixture was too crumbly and didn't hold a bar shape. Next time will reduce the amount of sugar, and add more PB. It tastes great, just not happy with the thickness of the bar portion.

After reading the reviews, I was hoping for amazing, they were okay. However I cut the recipe in half and they still made a TON. Going to give away the rest.. don't think that anyone will ask for the recipe, however that being said, if you have a sweet tooth and nothing else in the house.. they will work.

Yummy! My friends called it "chocolate peanut butter fudge" and it sure does have that consistency. I reduced the sugar, just because I don't need so much in my life :) Thank you!

Update: My husband asked for a birthday treat along the lines of a Reese's cup. I used cupcake liners and scooped a little ball of the peanut butter mixture for the center and then coated them on top and the sides with the chocolate mixture. Yummy! Very rich and possibly too big, depending on your sweetness level - but fun for sharing.

I substituted Caramel condensed milk by Eagle Brand and did 1/2 mixture of peanut butter chips and chocolate chips.  Also added 1/4 tsp espresso powder into chocolate mixture.  Also sprinkled coarse sea salt onto top of bars and then placed in refrigerator....hmmmm...so good....Mary

OMG!  Made these twice in the past two weeks and they disappeared before any other dessert on the table.  My boyfriend says they taste more like butterfingers.  I think so too, but they are soooo good and soooo easy to make.  Do you know of a way to keep the chocolate from coming off?

Very good.  A big hit with adults and kids.  Peanut butter part was a little crumbley the next day. I might add something next time to make it hold together better.

Awesome dessert snack made without baking necessary. I used 3/4 cup butter. I substituted 1/2 of the graham crackers with salted pretzels because I didn't have enough graham crackers. The saltiness tempered the sweetness. I followed some of the other suggestions by using a larger jelly tool pan, instead of a 9 x 13 cake pan.

Fabulous!  If you like peanut butter and chocolate together, give this a try, I think you will be in dream land.  I did use my kitchen scale to make sure I had the right amount of graham cracker.

Thank you for sharing this recipe.

Oh my gosh this recipe is good and so easy to make!  I took this on a girls trip last weekend, and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.  It was such a hit. I followed the recipe exactly, and made no modifications.  I did note one raters point however, that 1 box of graham crackers is only 14.5 oz, and used 4 full crackers from a second box. Thanks to mom2frankandy for submitting this.

This recipe was amazing! The mixture of graham crackers and peanut butter was unbelievably yummy. Super easy to make and can't wait for another excuse to make them. The only slight change I made was adding about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar to the chocolate chips after melting to make the chocolate a little sweeter. I've never had a Clark bar but these were similar to reeses cups

These are very good.  Very easy to make although I did end up having to crush the graham crackers myself.  I ended up using natural peanut butter and the sweetness was pretty much perfect so if I was using regular peanut butter I might decrease the sugar by half a cup.  With the natural peanut butter I had to refrigerate it for half an hour so it would set enough for the chocolate to be spread on top.  I poured it in the pan as opposed to pressing it.  I also used a mix of chipits and that was nice but if you don't have as much of a sweet tooth I could definitely see using a less sweet chocolate.  They did taste quite a bit like a reeses peanut butter cup which is also very sweet and about a 1" x 1" bite.  I am keeping this as an easy low mess prep.  Definitely needs the time in refrigeration though so not one to do just before heading out somewhere.

My father-in-law first made these for my son, so of course, I had to try them too.  They are easy and very good.  They don't last long in my home.

Holy Moly are these good! I followed the recipe as written. These taste similar to a peanut butter cup. Just be aware that they are very rich so small portion sizes are a must.

Made these as written.  Delicious.  The only problem is that they're VERY rich and as a single woman, they make far too many! :-D  I took most of the batch in to my doctor's office as part of my "share the calories" program.  I may get free medical service for life after sharing these...

They were a hit at the bbq yesterday!  I took some of the suggestions and and used less powdered sugar...cut it down to 2 c only.  Instead of semi sweet chocolate I used dark chocolate chips.
