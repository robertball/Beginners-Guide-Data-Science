Very good and easy to prepare. I made it in a large pitcher (10 servings) but left out the vodka so my guests could could add their own to suit their tastes. I frequently entertain and have learned that self-serve cocktails are the way to go! This method also respects the under-aged and non-alcohol drinking guests by offering the same "special" drinks to everyone.

Second time used lemon-flavored vodka instead of the lemon, diet cranberry and diet ginger ale.  Reduced the carbs enough for my diabetic friend to also enjoy.

This is absolutely wonderful! I made it for an afternoon bridal shower/bacholerette party, as a departure from the traditional "punch" beverage. I was at first concerned about the peculiar mixture of tastes, but all for nothing, as it ended up being delicious. Would definitely make again (and again).

Yummy! Except my ginger ale exploded all over the kitchen, because I guess it got shaken up on the way home. I had to add extra vodka just because of that. ;)

Very good drink. I adjust the servings and make a pitcher of this for parties. It is fairly cheap to make and people always finish it off. Its not too sweet either.

We didn't have ginger-ale but tonic water worked just fine. Make with fresh lemon juice for a nice thirst quenching drink.

I did use cranberry tea instead of cranberry juice which has too many carbs. Also used diet ginger ale. So a lower carb/calorie drink and it turned out very nice. I had two!

I'm sippin' on one of these right now and doin' the happy, happy, joy, joy dance because it's Monday and dance classes and work are over for the summer! Yahoo! Tomorrow night I'll be celebrating once again! Good, really good drink which I'm totally and completely enjoying. Leftovers are in order for dinner, so I can even indulge in another! (Shhh, I added a lot more vodka) Thanks Pokey!

This is delicious, but it doesn't scale up well.  I made a big batch  (30x) of this for a party and the lemon juice was overpowering.  I had to add more ginger ale (and then more vodka) to sweeten it up and fix the acidic ratio.

It's fun to make a big batch to go.  Just mix it up in a large stock pot and then funnel it into 2-liter bottles.  My 30x recipe filled five bottles.

Very refreshing! I tried it two ways and I think it works best with orange or clementine flavored vodka. I used this for a Christmas party, so I floated some fresh cranberries on top to be festive!

Tastey but I will use less lemon juice next time.  I doubled the recipe for my husbands and my drink and did the 2 oz of lemon, next round I will make with 1 1/2 oz of lemon.

This is pretty good, but the second time I cut the lemon juice in half since it seemed to overpower the other flavors a little.  Will make again.

I made this for the first time on Memorial Day, when I find a new recipe I always invite my neighbors over to be the guinea pigs. I almost bought cranberry juice but opted for cherry juice instead. We all loved the recipe because it is does not have a sweet syrup taste. Thanks for sharing your recipe. This is a keeper.

I used vanilla vodka because that's all I had on hand and I thought it made the drink taste like cake batter which for my taste, made it too sweet. My mother in law loved the vanilla vodka though...she thought it cut the tartness of the drink. Ha ha....one more thing for us to debate/disagree on ;) It is a good drink though....nice and refreshing.
