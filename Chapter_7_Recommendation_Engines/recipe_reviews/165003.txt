These were pretty good. Not exactly what I would call spicy but still good. I did not use the Mission salsa but our preferred instead and I used imitation crab because I cannot justify the expensive of real for an everyday type of meal. Other than that, I followed the recipe exactly and it was a nice change from your ordinary tostadas. Then end result was also very colorful which made for a pretty meal.

I did it a little different. I used large (burrito style) flour tortillas. I used a pan to fry them to desired doneness. I used imitation crab meat that I had bought for salads. The rest, I follwed the recipe except for adding a small can of diced green chiles while cooking the mixture. Imitation crab is great for this, gives the tostada a sweetness.  DELICIOUS

This recipe was a nice start. I left off the olives because I don't care for them, added fat free sour cream and used a pineapple salsa. This was tasty but the crab mixture needs some heat. I have leftovers for later this week so I plan on adding a few dashes of tabasco to the crab mxture and mabe some cumin or chili powder

This sounded good in theory, but the overall outcome was disappointing. It needed some pizazz, and I couldn't figure out what it was missing. Maybe some mango and fresh jalapenos? But I don't think I'll try and find out :(

I made these following the recipe exactly as written and they weren't bad, but we didn't think they were spectacular either.  It would certainly be easier to just buy tostadas and skip the step for baking the tortillas.

I made this for my boyfriend and he loved it.  I added a little seasoning salt for an extra kick.  Definitely will make again.
