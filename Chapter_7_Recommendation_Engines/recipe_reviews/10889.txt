These are great! I love the crispy crumbly texture. I used margarine but otherwise followed the recipe. Cookies have a lovely light flavor thanks for this easy recipe!

Although these can't be classified as 'terrible' I still found that I needed to add a lot of additional ingrediants to the mix in order for it to be enjoyable. For a higher star rating I reccomend that you add some cinnamon nutmeg coconut flakes small ammount of cocoa & a smidge of brown sugar.

These cookies are great! They're unbelievably simple to make (well...simple enough for a 15-year-old with no baking experience whatsoever) and very tasty. The only thing I changed in the recipe was the vanilla extract - I put a teaspoon of maple syrup instead.  Highly recommended!

I like these cookies. My mom used to make them while growing up. They are very crumbly but are very good!

These were good. I did change the recipe a little by adding 1/2 c peanut butter and 1/2 c chopped peanuts in place of the walnuts. They are crumbly however.

I'd tried this recipe in the past and felt there was just something missing so this time I tweaked it a bit. Instead of walnuts I used pistachios I de-shelled and crushed. Also I added 1 tbs of cinnemon and 1tbs of brown sugar. They came out tasting incredible!

Really good tasting cookie but dry. Crumbles very easily so not good for mailing or handling very much. Definitely a cookie to eat with a beverage!
