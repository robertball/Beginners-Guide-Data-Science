The recipe was terrific.  The key is to be careful not to burn the ginger and scallions.  You should heat the vegetable oil first and then add the ginger and scallions for only 30 seconds to a minute.  You will see the ginger bubble and the scallion will become bright green.  Smell the aroma.  If you can smell it, then turn it off.  If you don't, then the ginger and scallion will burn shortly thereafter.

We've never had rockfish before and I'm not sure I'll have it again. The smell of the fish is intense and leaves quite a linger in the house. The recipe or treatment of the rockfish was quite good (no changes) but I'll use this with another less intense smelling fish like tilapia or red snapper.

4 stars for me because it was an easy prep. I used a whole tilapia and it was awesome. I would add some ginger and scallions in the cavity of the fish to make the flavor really seep inside.  Will certainly be making this again.

My mother has taught me loosely the same recipe. Other white fishes that are not too rough can definitely be substituted. Be sure not to lift the lid as suggested.
