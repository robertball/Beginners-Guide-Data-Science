I've been making these forever. I usually use large red potatoes, [unless company is coming] and quarter them. I boil them in chicken stock, or half chicken stock, half water with a couple of chicken boullion cubes. Peel a whole onion cut it in half and put it in the water while the potatoes are boiling. When everything is done you can scoop the onion out with a slotted spoon. Just another layer of flavor. These are a staple in my house, right with mashed,and baked potatoes.

Everyone liked this -- even my most selective eater.  I used olive oil instead of butter.  Fresh parsley really makes a difference.  I put it all in a casserole dish in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes before serving.  Really great with steak and Green Beans with Almonds!

These potatoes were so easy and very tasty.  This is like a restaurant quality side dish, went perfect with my roast. Used olive oil instead of butter and salt/pepper to taste.

Simplicity at its best. I have found that people use garlic like its going to be bad fashion in a week. GARLIC ISNT USED FOR EVERYTHING. 
This recipe is delicious and younger children like to eat simple things.

Easy and delicious! I prepared this using all the red potatoes with the skins on and cut in half. Leaving the red skins on adds more nutrition and color to the side dish. I boiled them in chicken stock with a piece of garlic, mashed, and a little hawaiian sea salt. The potatoes were tasty and lightly buttered. I cooked the potatoes until they were fork tender which is how I like my potatoes. The sprinkles of fresh green parsley over the potatoes makes this look especially appealing. My family commented that the potatoes look like something you would order from a restaurant. This lovely side dish was served with, "Portuguese Pork with Red Peppers," "Sauteed Cherry Tomatoes with Garlic and Basil," and "Lemon-Sesame Asparagus," all from this website.

These are tasty and good for you - just use olive oil instead of butter! Nice side dish too and looks great with more fresh parsley sprinkled on top!

A lil too much butter. All I had was regular red potatoes, not the smaller new potatoes. I just quartered mine and cooked them the same way. Everyone in the house dug it!

I thought these were absolutely great and so easy to prepare. I did microwave for 10 minutes first and then baked for 35-40 minutes (serving 4 people). Flavor and texture were just great & my family loved them!

These were delicious and so easy to make! I quartered my red potatoes because they were kind of large and I didn't want them to take forever to cook. My mom said my grandma used to make parlsey potatoes when she was growing up, but she would boil them then fry them in butter in her cast iron skillet. That sounds so yummy too, but I was in a hurry so I jsut followed this recipe and melted the butter and seasonings on after draining the water. My daughter never eats, and she asked for thirds!

Delicious "starter" recipe.  I added rosemary and these were delicious and went great with the grilled pork loin we served.  I did cook all ingredients in a slow cooker on low for 4 hours and then drained.  I had to travel so I reheated in the microwave to warm through.

Quick, easy, and tasty! I used half butter and half olive oil, and added another dash of salt after the potatoes were coated, since it had been drained away with the water and they needed a little boost.

This is an easy staple and not really boring. Boring is a buttered baked potato. Anyway- we add some garlic and Vidalia's or Red Pepper. Awesome dish and easily altered to taste.

Good! Added minced garlic while cooking, combo of olive oil and butter, fresh italian parsley. Quartered larger red potatoes, but cooked them too long.

Very nice, simple recipe.  I used larger red potatoes and quartered them.  This went well with the Jagerschnitzel and German Red Cabbage (both from this site) I served for dinner last night.

This recipe is great i also read some reviews and i boiled the potatoes in chicken broth and chopped an onion really fine and left it in the potatoes which i thought gave it a real nice flavor. We love onions in my house. Added the Parsley and butter at the end. Very easy and delicious recipe. I would say it would be a great recipe for a holiday or for company.

I wanted something easy and simple to go with a spicy roast beef, and this definitely fit the bill. I followed the recipe exactly, and it was good, but I think I will cut down on the butter next time, as well as add a tiny bit more salt and a dash of pepper at the end.

So easy and sooooo good!  Agree that sometimes we become garlic obsessed (I am 100% guilty as charged : ). So these were a nice change...I had a bag of Fingerlings I wanted to use up...cut them in 1/2,boiled and prepared as directed....fabulous!!

Try browning the butter for a delicious, nutty flavor. My wonderful grandmother used to do this. (Brown butter is also simple and tasty on steamed cauliflower and/or broccoli.)

Be sure not to overcook them, or you get squished red potatoes :=) I will not be posting a pic of this recipe for that very reason -- but it was tasty!

I just made these recently with Baked Halibut, I did a slight change to them. Now I only used 6 red potatoes, they were larger than the typical small ones. I chopped the red potatoes into pieces before I boiled them, and added an entire stick of butter, parsley, and a little black pepper and adobe seasoning with pepper. Instead of tossing the potatoes, because they were not whole anymore, I took a wooden spoon and started to stir them. Because they were nice and soft, they started to mash together a little and the some skins also separated and mixed in. Me and my husband loved them and will definitely be making them again.

Yummy, easy potatoes -- would be great to cook for a crowd!  To reheat for leftofters, I browned them in a pan sprayed with Pam.  Next time I'll throw some diced onion in the pan as well . . .

These were a nice side dish with our chicken. They are rather bland though and would pretty much go with anything because of that. I microwaved mine on the potato setting in a covered dish and they turned out fine. My husband didn't understand the "green stuff" on his potatoes though so there was a little complaint about that.

These are always good and very simple.  Red potatoes are definitely best with the skins on, but they go with just about anything.    Simple can be good too!!!

I made these today and thought I would like them much more than I did. Only change I made was making 1/2 recipe and I used half butter and half lite margarine. That is normally not a problem. I just thought they kind of tasted like boiled potatoes. Mine also weren't as pretty. Some of the extra peeling came off. I suppose the picture is of the most kept together potatoes. When I sliced them the centers had even less flavor. I found that if I sprinkled garlic salt on them, then they were much better. I ate them with grilled chicken for a heavy lunch today.

I put this recipe as just okay because I guess my red potatoes were just too large for this recipe. If you use new potatoes, I'm sure it would be better.

These are also great on the grill. Just wrap them in foil with the butter and parsley and set them to the side. They go with everything, easy and taste wonderful.

We eat these when there are only little potatoes left in bag after picking through for baked size.  I cut them in 1/4's or 1/2's depending on size.  You don't need new potatoes for this.

Parsley Buttered Potatoes has long been a family favorite - three generations now.  Especially good with the Italian flat leaf parsley we have in the yard.

One of those very easy, simple dishes that you can really taste the ingredients because of it' simplicity

Don't have to use just red potato - idaho is good to albeit starchier

Too easy to be this good.  What a great alternative to mashed or fried potatoes.  
Makes a nice, attractive, and tasty side to almost anything.

i really love this recipe, whenever i come home my mom asks me to make this :) a good tip is to boil the red potatoes in an iron skillet if u have one, it takes more time, but somehow it makes them taste so much more tender and delicious!

Simple and delicious!  I cooked the potatoes in chicken broth and didn't add the salt at that time.  I did mix in a small amount of salt when adding the parsley and butter.

These are great all the men came back for more. I like to boil with a couple chicken bullion cubes and throw in some garlic while they are cooking. Also I always quarter mine they are easier to eat that way.

WONDERFUL!  I tried olive oil & cut the potatoes in wedges (because my potatoes were bigger) & put chicken bouillon in the water.  My hubby LOVED them.  I didn't put all the salt in because of the bouillon but next time - less bouillon, more sea salt.  Maybe I'll try the butter too.

Simple yet yummy! I did change the cooking method and added fresh minced garlic.  I quartered my potatoes added 1 TBSP water, covered, and microwaved for 7 minutes.  I drained off the water, covered and allowed to set for 5 minutes.  I cut 1 TBSP cold butter into small pieces and spinkled evenly over the potatoes along with the parsley, garlic, and salt/pepper; giving a toss before covering.  I let them sit for several hours to let the flavors mingle.  I baked them in a 350 degree oven, uncovered for 30 minutes.

I was looking for a recipe that was the same as my dad makes. I'm happy I found it!  These are simple, delicious, and not to mention affordable. I always have seconds!

These were lacking something. Nothing that more salt couldn't fix though.

Didn't have fresh parsley, so used dried. Used a whole stick of butter because I used a whole bag of baby reds. Overcooked just a bit; added to the texture a bit. Fried up the leftovers the next morning for breakfast - mmmmmm!

very good very simple, I did cook  for about 25 min, but only b/c it is easier for my 3 year old to eat them when they are more soft. Very simple side dish for the times when you have a more detailed main dish.

This recipe is a good basic recipe.  Exactly what I was looking for.  NativeGoddess, please don't tell my hubby or grandmother that garlic doesn't go on everything.  It would break their hearts!  ;)
