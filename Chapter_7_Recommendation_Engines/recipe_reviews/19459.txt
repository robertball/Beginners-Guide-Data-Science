After I made this pie, I spoke w/ a friend who grew up in Key West...This is the same recipe her grandmother taught her!!  Delicious!!  I used the full 1/2 cup (w/ fresh limes we brought back from vacation) and it set up perfectly.  I had my in-laws over for dinner for the first time since the wedding and served this for dessert...big hit!  So good, and so easy... I'll be bringing this to a lot of potlucks/holiday dinners/office parties!!

It was wonderful!  It doesn't set very well.  I made it again with 1/3 lime juice, and was a lot firmer.  WONDERFUL RECIPE!!  It's gone quick!!

I liked this pie!  So did my BBQ guests... Got many compliments!  I read the reviews for this recipe before trying it and I was glad I did.  I used Graham Cracker Crust III from this site as the crust, and then chilled it in the freezer after baking it.  To prevent runny or juicy filling, I chilled the lime juice, condensed milk and eggs, so my lime mixture was cold, and poured into the cold piecrust, then put in the fridge.  It set up very well after about one hour, but I let it chill for about 3 hours before making the meringe.  (I like HIGH meringe, so I used seven egg whites.) After baking the meringe, I again chilled the pie for two hours.  When sliced, it was very firm and well set. Pie was delicious!  I would have liked it a little more tart lime flavored, I could taste the sweet condensed milk.  But I will make this again!

This was a wonderful recipe. The first time I tried it, it didn't set very well at first. However, after being in the refrigerator all night, it held up well. The next time, I used only 1/3 cup of lime juice, and my husband said he liked it with more lime juice. Next time, we will up the lime juice and just let it set in the fridge for longer. The meringue recipe listed here did not work very well for me, so I used Meringue II from this site, which came out beautifully. Will definitely make this pie again using the meringue II recipe.

It is simply fantastic!!! The best I had. Whipped cream topping is also splendid with a little lime zest on top to garnish.

This was a really delicious pie.  It didn't set quite as firm as I'd hoped, I might cut the lime juice to 1/3 cup next time.

I read the reviews and used less lime juice. It was great, but i suggest you let pie cool for about 2-3 hours before making the meringue and then cool overnight. That is the best way to get the pie to gel completely. Overall, great recipe.

This is an extremely flavourful pie! I used the full amount of lime juice called for and it set up beatifully in about an hour in the fridge.  I didn't like the yellow-ish colour of the pie due to the eggs so I added a couple teeny drops of green food colouring to get the desired mint green shade (see my photo), I also used an OREO Cookie Crumb crust and although you would think an odd combination - it tasted fantastic! Citrus and Chocolate do go well together! Definitely a keeper of a recipe! I also only used 2 egg whites for the merengue as I don't like a ton of the stuff on my pies, I left a border of about an inch all the way around so you could see the pretty green colour contrasting with the Oreo Cookie crust. Thanks for the recipe! :) Very east to do and very pretty to look at!

This was a GREAT recipe.  I cut back on the lime juice to 1/3 cup.  My only suggestion is to let it cool after cooking for at least 3 hours.  This will let it really set up well, and give it enough time to chill all the way through.  I served it a little prematurely, and it got runnier faster.  It was even better the second day.  Everyone thought I was a master chef!

First, this is KEY LIME pie. KEY LIMES are critical to making it authentic (not regular limes, lemons, or calamansi). This recipe works perfectly for anyone with moderate baking skills. Just be sure to blend the ingredients sufficiently and it should work like a charm.

I do use an extra egg white or two (depending on size) plus 1/2 tsp of cream of tartar for a higher, stiffer meringue, but that is just my preference.

For those who have had trouble with setting, try cooking the pie for 15 minutes prior to adding meringue OR add 1/2 to 1 tsp of corn starch to the mixture.

I'd also only recommend a homemade graham cracker crust or thin, flaky pastry shell (pre-baked 20 minutes with foil around edges). It seems worth the effort for the authentic, homemade taste.

I've had nothing but compliments and requests for the recipe whenever anyone has tasted it. If anyone doesn't like the tartness or sweetness, this pie may just not be for you. It IS the real deal and should not be altered.

This pie is delicious.  I'm in agreement with the other reviewers who recommend slightly reducing the amount of lime juice to firm up the filling and reduce the amount of juice that leaks out when you slice the pie.  I also recommend chilling the pie overnight--the flavors were better the second day.  One more change, suggested by another reviewer--I used the Meringue II recipe on this website for the meringue portion of the recipe-probably the most fool-proof meringue recipe out there!

I followed the recipe very closely and it tasted good, but the meringue broke up a little bit and there was still liquid comming out of the filling when I cut it after chilled overnight. I am affraid even the 20 minutes I baked it is a short time. Maybe I can do it better next time.

I was devastated when I lost my recipe for key lime because I never thought I would find one the same, turns out I could. Very good, very traditional.

Great recipe, i was looking for a more tart one and this is it.  I don't want a rich overly sweet key lime pie.  The meringue was easy--- i used egg whites at room temp with a mixer and a 1/2 teaspoon of white vinegar in place of cream of tartar (internet recommendation), got good peaks, came out great.  thanks!

Wow...really simple to make and so delicious!  The sweet and sour flavors are well balanced and the light merengue on top is the best!!  I made mine with a homemade, flaky crust since I didn't have graham crackers and it's still delicious.  Will be making again and again!

Excellant flavor and consistency. Not too tart and not too sweet. I made a 9" pie without the meringue. I used 3 egg yolks instead of 2 yolks and a whole egg. I may double the filling next time to get a thicker higher pie since I do not make the meringue. Hubby loved it too!

I made the pie exactly according to the recipe.  Lime filling was completely runny and bitter.  There was so much liquid that the crust dissolved completely.  What a bummer.

I followed the recipe as directed, except I made a meringue with three vs. two egg whites for a fluffier topping. I refrigerated the pie for 90 minutes before baking, then let stand overnight before cutting, and had no issues with it being runny. There was a little bit of juice at the bottom when I cut into each piece of the pie, but it's a homemade pie, and it didn't detract at all; I think it's probably supposed to be like that. The combination of 1/2 c. lime juice and sweetened milk was perfect. This pie was so easy, and even with just a prepared graham cracker crust, it was truly delicious.

This pie works beautifully exactly as written IF you give it ample time to chill before serving.  I make my own pie crust, 1 1/2 recipes of graham cracker crust to make the crust a little more substantial and to make the flavor hold up against the strong lime flavor.  PERFECTION!

I used 1/3 cup key lime juice, and 3 tbsp sugar for the meringue. It didn't set after 15 min at 350 degrees so I decided to bake it for another half hour at 250 degrees. It turned out to be nice!

This was delicious!  I read the other reviews and found that many stated the pie did not set enough.  So when I made it I added 1/2 an envelope of vanilla instant pudding (small box) to the mix and it came out perfect!

FANTASTIC!  My husband loved The Blonde Giraffe's key lime pie in Key West so I wanted to surprise him with a homemade one.  I followed the recipe exactly and it was divine!  I made a homemade graham cracker crust because I think they are better.  I also doubled the meringue topping because I LOVE MERINGUE.  Make this pie...you don't be disappointed!  It tasted just like the real thing in Key West.  :)

Definitely let the pie set up overnight, and do not use less lime juice. Excellent pie!

This pie was very quick and easy to make, but guests and I found it to be a bit too bitter.  The zest gave just a little too much bite.  I would make it again, but decrease the amount of lime zest used.

Amazing key lime pie! The consistency and flavor was dead on! I did make some adjustments to the cooling time. I let it sit in the fridge for 2 hours before I added the merengue and baked it. Then I let it sit overnight in the fridge before it was served. The lime filling was not runny at all, and it was the perfect consistency! I also made my own pie crust. Just followed the instructions on the back of the Honey Maid Graham Cracker Crumbs box and let the crust cool in the fridge for about a half hour before I filled it. It was DELICIOUS!

This is one of the best recipes I have found.  I do change it by using Lemon Juice and Lemon Zest, and by adding 1 t. of cream of tarter to the meringue.  Excellent!!!  Extremely Rich!

I made one change, using ginger biscuits in the base instead of Graham crackers, ginger goes really well with lime. The lime layer set really well and the topping loked so good my husband thought it was shop bought.

Great Key Lime flavor and very easy to make.  I used 3 egg whites for my meringue because 2 just didn't seem like enough.

I have low baking and cooking skills. I am very pleased, no...tickled with how my pie turned out! I will make it again, and again as key lime pie is my absolute favorite! 

I will say that next time I will skip the meringue altogether; I'm just not a fan of meringue. I allowed the pie to chill for 3 to 5 hours before baking it with the meringue and then another 3 to 5 before eating it. Cutting it straight from the fridge, it was a tad running. I think it may set better overnight.

It really is restaurant quality!  I've been wanting a real key lime pie for ages and this was perfect!  Juicing the individual limes was a pain, next time I'll just buy the bottle of key lime juice!

For my first time making key lime pie, this recipe worked great! I doubled the recipe because I used 2 frozen pie crusts vs. the graham cracker crust. I blind baked each crust for 12 minutes and sprinkled them with cinnamon sugar mixture while they were cooling which really made a difference. One hour was not long enough to set the filling. Next time, I'll let it set in the fridge for at least 2 hours before adding the meringue and baking. I was afraid my meringue would burn so I baked uncovered for 5 min., tented with a foil dome for 20 min. and finished uncovered for 6 minutes. I allowed it to cool on the counter for 30min. then placed in fridge overnight. I took the pie to work the next day and my coworkers and I really enjoyed it! The filling had great flavor, not too tart, not too sweet!

I was a little nervous about trying this recipe because some people were having problems getting it to set.  I made the filling and then let it set in the fridge for about two hours before doing the meringue.  The only things I changed in the recipe was doubling the amount of lime zest and doing 4 egg whites instead of two for the meringue.  Turned out really well.  I will definitely make this again.

This was very good.  It set fine for me, but I cooked it a little longer than suggested and let it refrigerate for a few hours before I cut it.  Next time I would use a little less juice.  It was a little tart for my taste, but otherwise very good.

I had never had Key Lime Pie before. Then I went to Key West and everyone said to get some real Key Lime juice. So I did. Everyone bugged me to make the pies when I got home and I did. I tasted it and decided that I do not like Key Lime Pie that much. It's just not for me. However, I gave this recipe 5 stars because everyone else loved it. They raved about it. They said it was the best Key Lime Pie they ever had. So it must be pretty darn good to Key Lime Pie lovers.

This is now my staple Key Lime Pie recipe.  It is SO good!  I made it to bring to a dinner party and it was a huge hit.  In order to cover the top of the pie, I ended up having to double the amount of meringue.  I also let it set in the fridge for 2 hours instead of just 1 and didn't have any trouble with it being too runny.  It is fantastic!

Well, i cut a piece out to try and make all the juice come out and now i have a pie tin full of juice!! The pie is a little firmer, but it's all juicy! It still tastes delicious, but i think i may have to use only 1/3 cup juice next time. I don't want to skimp on the lime flavor so i think i may double the lime zest. I don't know if i did anything wrong with this recipe but i followed all of the directions! It looks like other people are having the same problems with this recipe. Still yummy though!

Spectacular recipe, one of the best I've tried!

As for not setting firmly ^, I suggest leaving it in the freezer for 30 minutes-1 hour before serving. Cutting the lime juice is the obvious solution, but in my experience it comes out with too little lime flavor and simply tastes bad.

Firstly, I made it with the full half cup of key lime juice.  It set beautifully.  Though it did not have a strong tangy taste like I would have liked (too sweet), next time I will add more zest.  I did not make the meringue and instead covered it with fresh whipped cream (not the cool whip stuff) mixed with more zest.

This was the perfect key lime pie! My DH raved about this and gave it 5 stars. He said this was just like the key lime pie his mom used to make for him growing up in St Croix. I used Mexican key limes for this and doubled the filling, so I used about 2/3 a small bag of limes. It was a little tedious juicing all those itty bitty limes by hand, but oh, this was so worth it. To hear my DH and son rave about this was worth it. It was the perfect blend of tart and sweet, not one or the other. I used dried lemon peel in the spice jar instead of lime peel. ( A lot easier and you couldn't even tell it was there) I did cook this for approx. 25 minutes (until it was set) at 325 F. Thanks, Barbara, in my husbands words, this pie is awesome! I think he said that about 7 times while eating it.

The only recipe I’ve ever tried and couldn’t salvage. The filling never set, even left overnight before topped. The meringue won’t peak in a humid environment... unsure why this recipe doesn’t call for cream of tartar. Total waste of time and groceries.

Had bought a bag of 20 limes for $3. After enough mojitos, I decided to try my 1st attempt at key lime pie. Even though I only had regular limes., it turned out great. Delicious and Limey, but not too tart. Could use a little more meringue.

This recipe is fool proof and to die for, and I'm a citrus fanatic.  I used this recipe to make 2 pans of mini tarts for Easter brunch instead of a large pie. I made a simple graham cracker crust (1 2/ cups of graham crackers, 6 Tbsps. butter, 1/4 cup sugar) and pressed a spoon full each into non stick mini muffin tins. I followed this recipe exactly with one exception, I used three yolks from Omega eggs instead of two yolks and one whole egg. I placed a tablespoon of key lime custard on top of the crust and then baked them at 350 degrees for 12 minutes exactly. I let them cool and then covered and put them in the fridge overnight. They were tricky and sticky to get out the next day, but I found a sharp knife dipped in boiling water popped them right out. I dusted them with power sugar to cover slight imperfections and served with fresh fruit and real whipped cream. The taste packs a real lime wallop, JUST what I was looking for. This is critical, be SURE to use REAL Florida "Key Lime" juice. It cannot be just any old lime juice, it must be Key Lime specifically. I got mine bottled off Amazon and it's the real deal.

Awesome pie! I followed the recipe using the full 1/2 cup of key lime juice and had no problems with it being runny. Maybe the difference is that I used freshly squeezed key lime juice, but I also left in the fridge for almost three hours prior to adding the meringue and baking. After baking, I placed it back into the fridge overnight before eating. I think that's the trick is to chill over night prior to eating. I did use the recommended meringue II recipe and it was the perfect balance of sweet to the tart/tangy of the pie.

Use 1/3 cup lime juice, and never cover the pie. I had a perfectly firm pie turn into mush because someone covered it with cling wrap.  I double everything and skip the merengue usually while garnishing with raspberry sauce.

This gets a 5 for flavor, but a 2 for presentation.  It is very difficult to get a "piece" of pie out since the filling doesn't really set.  It just becomes a soupy mess.  I followed the directions to the letter - using the exact ingredients, chilling, and baking for the time called.  The filling seemed very set when I put the meringue on, so I think that the baking is what affects the consistency when serving.  I do like the idea of the meringue on top.  I may try to do this again with lime juice, but follow a lemon meringue pie recipe, or do my regular lime pie recipe, and top that with a meringue.  We did end up eating this - my husband says it doesn't matter what it looks like, only what it tastes like.

Loved this recipe and will make it again. I added lime zest in the crust to give it a bit more punch and a tad more zest to the pie itself. I put it in the prebaked crust and baked it for 25 minutes instead of putting it in the refrigerator for a hour. It's consistency was like that of a semi-firm cheese cake but held its shape very easily. Very good tasting pie! The 9 year old even wanted a second piece even after having eaten a huge lunch.

Very good!   I cant compare it because this was the first time making and tasting Keylime pie. I did take other reviewers advice and only use 1/3 lime juice and left in the fridge for over 3hrs before putting it in the oven and waited till the next day before cutting it and it help very well.  Thanks, will make again!

This was my first key lime pie and it was absolutely amazing. The graham cracker crust was so easy. I did as the other reviewers suggested and let the lime filling set for 24 hours in the fridge- WOW was it worth it. Astounding flavour for almost no work at all!

Wonderful! I used a little more lime juice and made sure it was in refrigerator well before serving so it had time to set. Zest made it pretty and taste better. Used 5 egg whites.

This pie was easy to make and came out great.  I used fresh key limes that I squeezed the juice from but had to use a little lemon juice to get 1/2 cup of juice.  It was a little sweet but was still good.  I will make this again.

this was very easy to make and the whole pie was served immediately.  the only problem i had with it was the sweetness was powerful, but the positive side was the lime flavour was fantastice not to tart.  highly recommened for those who love very sweet and little tart pies.

Better than the recipe from the back of a Key West Key Lime Pie Co. lime juice bottle I bought in, you guessed it, Key West.  But still wasn't as good as the pie I had there... Anyways, I added some zest to make it less sweet but my husband said it made it a little bitter.  Just a preference thing, I guess.

I first tried key lime pie two months ago in Honolulu and loved it.  I saw this recipe while we in Honolulu and purchased the Graham crackers and the key lime juice.

I made this key lime pie yesterday for guests.  As suggested by a few of the other reviewers, I reduced the key lime juice to 1/3 of a cup.  The pie turned out really well and was a big hit last night.  The recipe was simple to follow and the pie looked and tasted great.

I made this recipe for my neighbor and he shared it with a friend.  The friend actually bought the ingredients for me to make one for him.  I did adjust the lime juice a little.

a little runny  I put it in the freezer though for an hour or two after cutting a slice out.. The extra juice came out onto the pan and it became stiff afterwards.  made it with lime and lemon juice which were great together.

Mine also didn't set very well.  Wish I had read the reviews and reduced the lime juice.
