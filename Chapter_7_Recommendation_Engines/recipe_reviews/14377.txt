This is a really good potato salad.  I went through the reviews and so many people added a bunch of stuff to this like bacon, eggs, cheese.  It's a totally different salad at that point.  This is meant to be light!  I added a little more chives and let it sit overnight.  The flavor of the chives really came through.  I added a little Miracle Whip for some added zip - not much, just a couple of tablespoons.

Really good.  The fresh chives really add to the dish.  Added more than called for though.  I don't like mayonaisse based potato salad and this was perfect.  I liked the creamy taste and the sour cream and yogurt match well together.

Added dill, a tbsp or so of red wine vinegar and substituted garlic salt for regular.  A great healthier recipe for potato salad!  Everyone liked it!

I was very tired when I made this salad and accidentally used mayonnaise instead of sour cream and it was still very good.  I'm going to try it next time using the sour cream as stated in the recipe.  I also threw in some celery to add some extra veggies.  I think I'll also add some hard boiled eggs next time also.

Very good salad! Easy and quick. I added a little dill pickle juice to or you could use fresh dill or dill seed. It gave it just a little kick.

I loved this recipe.  Lighter than your standard potato salad with loads of mayonnaise or miracle whip.  I used a little more dill (didn't really measure it) and freeze dried chives, which I thought worked well.  I think garlic salt in place of regular salt would add even more flavor.

This was a very bland salad.  I added a generous amount of dill weed and some bacon and it just didn't help.  Sorry, I won't make it again.

Love this potato salad! Make sure youre not shy with the salt after the it sits in the fridge over night or for a couple hours, also I added some white pepper, it had such a great creaminess. Everyone loved it a our work picnic! no one could tell that it was low fat, they appreciated that it wasnt super heavy like most mayo salads are!... I even used low fat plain yogurt!!

I hate mayo (and Miracle Whip) and eggs so this was perfect! 
The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I thought it was a little bland as is. I added more chives, dill, a little mustard, and some pickle relish and it was great! I keep going back for bites. 
Husband liked it too. He said it was good but I think he misses the mayo and eggs...too bad! :)

Quite tasty on its own, but I found that it needed just a little something, so I added ~2T dijon mustard and ~1/4C finely chopped onions after the fact. I also used lowfat sour cream and lowfat greek yogurt. I was really shocked at how good it was given how much healthier it is than your standard potato salad. I think some hard cooked egg whites would also be a welcome addition--and maybe some celery, too--if you're looking to make it more "traditional" in texture and content. I'm going to try that next time!

Very nice change from mayo-based potato salad.  I followed the recipe, but did add extra chives (another 1/8 cup),  1/8 c chopped fresh dill,   a few tbs chopped fresh parsley and tbs very finely chopped rosemary, and combined the dressing ahead of time to let the flavors blend while the potatoes were cooking & chilling.  Took to a potluck & was very good.   Has the flavor profile of a good sour cream/chive baked potato, in handy salad form.  Will make this one again!

Not bad but needs some bacon flavoring in it. I needed my potatoes to be a bit softer than normal so the flavors mixed more together

I like the yogurt and sour cream mixture, but it was a little bland even after I added some dried dill.  Next time I will increase the amount of salt and pepper.  Thanks for sharing!

Great base recipe I could bend and make more personal by adding our family's favorite potato salad ingredients. To make a baked potato salad, I added in crumbled bacon, chopped green onions, shredded sharp cheddar and a few spices. I also used reduced fat sour cream. Very simple.

Very good, although I have to admit I did change the recipe a bit.  The recipe itself was a great start, and by implementing suggestions from other reviewers, it was outstanding!  I realized (after cooking the potatoes) that I didn't have any sour cream, so I softened about 1/3 block of cream cheese and added a few tablespoons of ranch dressing to it.  I didn't use the yogurt, either, but I added a tablespoon or so of light mayo, in addition to chives, sea salt, shredded cheese and bacon bits.  I served it at room temperature, and my whole family loved it!

My family thought this had too little flavor.  The bland potatoes need more of a punch than sourcream and chives for potato salad.

I thought this was good BUT it certainly doesn't replace the traditional taste of potato salad for me.  This recipe was a little dry until I "doctored" it with other ingredients.  I still prefer the traditional taste of potato salad.  My husband wasn't impressed, mostly since he doesn't like sour cream that much.

I added crumbed bacon and shredded cheddar cheese.  The sauce needed more "zip", so I added part of a packet of Hidden Valley Ranch dip mix. Also, no yogurt on hand, so I used light sour cream.  Turned out great.  Best made the night before serving or at least several hours before serving.

This was pretty good, though not outstanding, as written. I followed the recipe exactly, and at the end was left with something that was significantly lighter than a traditional mayo-based potato salad, but also much more bland. I helped the flavor by adding another clump of chives from the garden (an additional 50% of what the recipe called for, I think), a bunch of salt, pepper, and garlic powder. By the time I was done I probably would have rated it a 4, but only a 3 as written. It's a great idea and it went over well at the party I was at, so I might experiment with it to find a better balance of flavors, but I probably won't make again as written.

I used this recipe as a base for my potato salad. I was looking for something that didn't have mayo in it. I used less yogurt and more sour cream (i used greek yogurt) I also added vidalia onions, hard boiled eggs, extra scallions and celery (if you just mix the onions, yogurt, sour cream celery, s/p and scallions together it makes a great dip) all in all it came out great...hubby loved it..i recommend letting it sit over night.

It was a little bland, so I added a pound of crumbled bacon and a few shakes of red pepper flakes.  It added some kick without being too hot.  I would prefer it a little creamier next time.  It tasted like a loaded baked potato.  It was good.  Had lots of compliments with my alterations.

I am glad I tasted this before serving because it was VERY bland.  I ended up adding boiled eggs, crumbled bacon, about 1 teaspoon of garlic powder, more chives, and some mayonnaise.

I was looking for something new to do with red potatoes and WOW this is great! I used fewer potatoes than called for so it was REALLY creamy and I also used dried chives. Next time I plan to try fresh. I've already passed the recipe on to my mom. I will definitely make it again!

This was very different from the usually recipe with eggs, relish, etc., and was surprisingly light. The fact that it was so uncomplicated was what made it so delicious. I loved it!!

I thought this recipe was extremely bland.  I liked it as a base recipe and then I added my own pizzazz.  I added whole grain mustard, celery, garlic salt, & bacon.  The mustard gave it a little spice.

This is a simple and plain potato salad but I really liked it.I do think the chives give it flavor, and I like its creaminess. I'm not a big mayo fan, so I liked this better than potato salads made with mayonnaise. It's easy to make and doesn't take much time, either. I do think it would be good with some things added to it, as well.

It was a good starting point. I dislike mayonnaise, so having a potato salad recipe that did not include mayonnaise was nice. However, as is it is fairly bland. I doubled the chives, added half a cup of thinly sliced red onion, and half a packet of ranch dressing mix. This gave a light a flavorful potato salad that I got lots of compliments on.

This was good, but just a bit tart for my taste. If I were to make it again, I would probably use some lite mayo instead of some of the sour cream and yog. Also, you can't beat a little dry Ranch dressing mix in the dressing.

Made this and brought it to a party and got rave reviews! Had to send the recipe to lots of my friends afterwards. It was so easy to make. I added a few spices (but still kept it low fat): 1 Tablespoon of red wine vinegar, 2 chopped up hard boiled eggs, 2 chopped stalks of celery, shake of celery salt, onion powder, salt & pepper. I might even add some dijon mustard next time. Loved not having mayonnaise in it!! So much healthier with the yogurt. This is a keeper!

This salad was great.  I made a few minor changes, I used greek yogurt because it's thicker and creamer.  Added fresh dill, increased the chives and added crumbled bacon.  My husband does not like potatoes but he loved this salad.

I really like the addition of sourcream to the potato salad however, I substituted mayo for the yogurt as I didn't have any.  I have to agree with several others that this recipe is incredibly bland..this is a problem that can be solved very easily though, I added chopped red oniion, parsley, and a little dill to spice it up.  Everyone really liked this a lot and it was eaten very quickly.

I had a sour cream-based potato salad at IKEA, and loved it. If you are a mayo-based salad fan, this may not be for you. However, if you are looking for something lighter, with brighter flavors, this is a winner! 

Use FRESH chives, and be generous with them. I also subbed garlic salt for the salt, and threw in a touch of onion powder that was sitting out. If you can't get fresh chives all the time, chop them up, coat them in hot butter or coconut oil, and then freeze them in ice cube trays to use year-round. The bonus is you get preserved chives in lovely green chive oil when the cubes are melted.

Since the chives in the store here looked like poop, I used a mix of melted chive cubes and freeze-dried chives. It tastes pretty awesome. So much so that I had to hide the chive/sour cream/yogurt mix in the fridge while the potatoes cook so my partner and I don't eat all the dressing.

Also, I used light sour cream and 2% greek yogurt and didn't notice any loss of quality.

I liked this a lot...it's a great low cal/fat potato salad.  I must admit though, that I did change the recipe a little. I added grated carrot and I omitted the yogurt (a yogurt hater was eating the salad) and sub'd in light miracle whip.  It was great....we'll definitely make again.

This is a great alternative for those who hate mayo.  My husband, who will eat no form of potato salad, even liked it!  Also a great way to use the chives in your garden!  Next time I will try bacon bits too.

Made this for my moms 80th Birthday party, everyone is asking for the recipe! They loved it!
I did add bacon, green onion, shredded cheddar & miracle whip instead of yogurt. Salt & pepper to taste.

I had a similar recipe years ago and was pleased to find this here. About the only thing I did differently was add salt to the cooking water and then toss the potatoes in a bit of vinegar after boiling them. I do this with any potatoes for cold dishes—it cuts the need for added salt in the finished product.

I liked this, but I found it a little bland as is, so I added some bits of bacon and shredded sharp cheddar cheese, and it was perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

I love potato salad, especially with red potatoes, but I hate mayonnaise, so I wanted to try making one without the mayo. This recipe worked great, using a 1:1 sour cream to plain yogurt ratio. I used plain Greek yogurt, since that is what I had on hand, so I added a little milk to thin out the mixture a tad. I also used green onions instead of chives because I had them. For flavoring, I used ranch seasoning and a little salt and pepper. If I'd had bacon, I would have added that as well. This is really good potato salad.

I found this to be pretty tasteless.  After adding some dill and a squirt of mustard, it was better, but it's still not my favorite thing.
Edit:  I had to up my rating from three to four stars because my husband said he really liked this exactly as the recipe was written.  I guess it is a matter of taste.

This is a summer "must make" and a favorite in our house. It is simple, wonderful with fresh fixin's from the garden (or the store,) and a compliment to any meal. We have made this recipe as is and loved it, but also found it is great with extras added, like bacon, chopped peppers, even the snappy crunch of chopped radishes. A real keeper.

Excellent basic recipe, which also leaves a lot of room to add and/or delete different spices, herbs, etc. to punch it up. I followed it as written and was fine with the result. However, for a little more flavor I added some capers to taste. You can also replace the chives with fresh dill, and even throw in a shot of brandy. Sounds weird but it gives it a nice little aftertaste.

I think this is a good, basic recipe. Some tips for those looking to add flavor: salt the cooking water for your potatoes. Like salting pasta water, it can give the potatoes some seasoning. I used fat free plain greek yogurt and full fat sour cream for the dressing. I also added the juice of half a lemon (1 tbsp) to the dressing to add some brightness and to loosen it up--my mix had the consistency of a dip before I added the juice. I also looked at the other reviews and added some fresh dill and 1 tbsp Dijon mustard (although I think regular would work as well). It made a very good, light, and flavorful vegetarian side dish. I might add in more mustard and some homemade bacon bits the next time I make it and eat it as a cool summer main dish.

Needs more salt and herbs. Definitely better after it sits overnight.

We didn't have the full amount of chives, but it was still tasty the yogurt gives a nice tang.  We used a seasoned salt and a little parsley too.  I think anything that tastes good on a baked potato would taste good added to this salad.  Especially good salad for those that don't like mayo.

This was good, added the fresh dill, half cup of celery and sweet onions.
1 teaspoon garlic powder and also a dash of season salt. 
We are trying to limit salt intake so people can salt to taste.
It is really good and I also am not a mayo guy, to satisfy the boss it also got a tablespoon of mayo but it is just creamy and tangy and not too sweet.

I liked this potato salad but it still lacked flavor.  I added crumbled crisp bacon and it gave it a boost.  Yummy!

The consistency of this potato salad was good, but I agree with another in that one must make so many changes to it, that you end up with a completely different recipe.  The recipe as written is extremely bland!  It was a neat idea, kind of like a sour cream and chives baked potato, but the great chives flavor is just overpowered by all of the potato starch and sour cream.  I would substitute a flavorful salad dressing such as Miracle Whip for some of the sour cream, and even some sweet pickle relish and yellow mustard to give it a little more flavor.  Even with the additions, we had a ton of it leftover, which was then fed to our garbage disposal!

I agree with several other posters.  This is really rather bland.  I had to add so many things to this to get my family to eat it, that it created an entirely new recipe.  Thanks for the base, but I certainly wouldn't leave it as-is.

This was very bland.  Bacon, onions and cheese would have added a lot.
