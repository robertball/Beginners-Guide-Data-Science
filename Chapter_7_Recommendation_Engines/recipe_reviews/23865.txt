Incredible soup!  My husband is a vegetarian, so I substituted vegetable stock (Wolfgang Puck brand) for the chicken broth and used vegetable bullion cubes.  I actually ended up using 1 ½  32 oz. boxes of the vegetable stock (48 oz. total), which is a bit more than the recipe calls for, and the soup still came out with a great creamy consistency – not too thick and not too thin.  Some enhancements I made to the recipe in addition to making it veggie-friendly were to add an extra ¾ C. diced potatoes, 1 can of corn, 3 cloves garlic, some shredded carrot, & substituted a large leek for the onion, which were all great flavor compliments to the potato.  I sautéed the celery, shredded carrot, pressed garlic, and the diced leek in a saucepan with some olive oil before adding it to the boiling potato / broth mixture, then followed the recipe from there, adding the canned corn at the end.  I served the soup with a nice green salad and a French baguette.  What a wonderful meal for a cozy night in with my family.  Note:  This would be AMAZING with some dungeness crab meat added - YUM!

Absolutely delicious, the first time I made it exactly by the recipe and it was great. Now, I use skim milk instead of half and half, and puree about half of it when it's finished cooking to thicken it up.  It's just as good to us.

It's cold & windy today, perfect for a delicous soup! I like carrots in my potato soup so I left out the celery. Used whole milk. Added lots of garlic. Only used 1 can of chicken broth & no bouillon (family doesn't care for salt very much). It's perfect!

This recipe was pretty good, but I found that it wasn't nearly as thick as I'd like.  I think next time I won't add as much chicken broth and that should do the trick.  I may also add a little more potato, but otherwise it was tasty and a good recipe to start with.

Great hearty meal!
I added Soy milk instead, because my wife can't have milk. It turned out Great, didn't notice any difference and added great body to the soup. Also added carrots from the garden.
We used 2 cans of chicken stock and 1 box of vegetable stock. We then cooked 2 chicken breasts on the bone in water with salt, pepper, parsley, tarragon, and some lowerys season salt. Boiled on med heat 30-45 mins, let cool and removed from liquid and cooled on plate. I strained out the cooked chicken broth and added broth from cooking potato/veg stock. Into this I added the melted butter and flower. And heated on med. While this heated I removed the skin and bone from chicken breast and set aside and I then shredded the the breast meat. I added the thickened stock into the main pot and added the shredded chicken. I let it on med low heat for 25 more mins. I then let this cool and put in in the fridge for lunch and perhaps supper the next day. It turned out great. I tasted a cup and it would be ready to serve hot or prepare ahead of time and serve later. I nice sour dough loaf or like bread would go well with this meal!

Very good.  To make this vegetarian, I used vegetable broth and some Better Than Boullion "No-Chicken Base" (boullion paste that tastes like chicken, with no animal products).  Worked great!  I also used fat-free half and half to make it lower in fat and calories.  Will make again.

This soup turned out wonderful.  I used a low sodium broth because I figured with the buillion and salt I could have a little more control over the amount of salt.  I read the recipe wrong and thought it said 3 cups chicken broth but I poured in a whole box (4 cups) and then caught my mistake.  Either way, by the time the potatoes cooked, there wasn't much broth left.  I added the half and half to it and the flour/butter mixture as the recipe stated and it turned out perfectly.  I didn't even add anymore broth to it.  To finish it off, I did use a potato masher in the soup to help break some of the potatoes up and leave some whole and that worked great.  Wonderful recipe and I will make this again.

Great recipe, tastes very creamy and nice but just a suggestion - saute your onions and celery lightly in a little butter before putting them in with the potatoes. It will give the soup an even better flavour.

Living in Northern Maine, soups, stews and chowders are a staple. This recipe was excellent with full flavor and a rich creamy texture. I did make a number of changes. I dug 8 good size potatoes from the garden. I added 4 cloves of freshly grated garlic and one fresh garden carrot, (grated) to the boiling potato pot. I strained the potatoes & veggies and let them "rest", for 2 hours. I then took the broth that the potatoes had cooked in and added the rest of the chicken broth. I used whole milk instead of the half and half. I took 2 cups of the potatos and veggies and used a potato masher and mashed them into the broth mixture. I simmered and then added the rest of the potatoes. Instead of flour, I simply slowly added "Wondra, to get the right consistancey. When piping hot, I added fresh cut basil and parlsey. This was an excellent recipe. Thank you

Maybe I did something wrong, but I thought this was bland and boring. Also, the half & half made it too rich and kind of sickening. Gonna throw it out. Sorry, I really wanted to love it.

-Great flavor!!  Not as robust a flavor as some potato soups, but this has a beautiful flavor in its own right.  This soup will go on the list of my very best soup recipes.
-You will need to add a great deal more broth to the pot on step 1.  (It's pretty hard to boil seven plus cups of vegetables in just two cups of broth!)  However, you can just use some of the rest of the broth the recipe already calls for, so no big deal.
-Using homemade chicken stock instead of canned broth and bouillon definitely gives the soup a richer flavor.  Also, make sure you've added enough salt if using homemade stock.  The soup will be somewhat bland if under-salted.  You may wish to add a bit of salt even if using commercial broth and bouillon; enough salt makes all the difference in the flavor for this soup.
-Finally, if you are worried about the soup being too thin, cook and stir the white sauce longer in step two.  It will continue to thicken more the longer you cook and stir it.
-If you want to make sure the celery and onion are as soft as the potatoes, boil them first for about 5 minutes before adding the potatoes.
-To quote Lewis Carroll, "Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!"

Great recipe! I made this for the first time for my husband and his friend who re-roofed our house. It was chilly that day and they ate the soup up and each had thirds! Delicious! The only thing I changed was I left out the celery and added about 2 cups of frozen corn. Instead of the half and half I used skim milk and thickened the soup with cornstarch to make it a little healthier.  Anyway yummy recipe! I will make this again and again!

I really liked the flavor of this soup.  Just potato soup without any "cream of" flavoring or sour cream or all those other add-ins.  Because of so many "too salty" comments, I only added 2 tsp. of chicken flavored Better than Bouillon.  It was perfect for me, but my husband still added salt to his. I used fat-free half and half, and it turned out fine. The only issue I had was way too much liquid for the potatoes.  I just spooned potatoes in the bowl and then added liquid. So problem solved.  Now I have a lot of liquid to which I am adding more boiled potatoes and onions to make another meal of this delicious soup.

I have tweaked this recipe to make it vegetarian for the hubby, but it is amazing as it is too. I love using the baby dutch yellow potatoes best. I tried using 1% milk to make it healthier and I could hardly tell a difference

My version was NOT weight watchers friendly.  I added nearly a pound of bacon.  Precooked the potato's, onion, and some garlic in half of the remaining bacon grease.  did everything the same except the bullion, and minus celery.  Did'nt want to mess up the artery clogging process.

I am  giving this 4 stars because I reserve 5 for really outstanding.  This soup was very good and easy to add ingredients or amend if you were locked in due to bad weather as I was yesterday, no meat thawed and could not get to the grocery.  I used flour to thicken as the recipe called for but I did not have chicken broth so I as improvising and added to much liquid.  Also only had 2% milk so to thicken the soup, I added instant potatoes, and that really enhanced the flavor.  I do not usually have instant potatoes  on hand but I had seen another recipe for potato soup that called for them so had bought, just in case.  I probably had more than one cup of onions but we enjoyed the flavor as we like onions.  Again, use this recipe to add the seasonings you like or eliminate the ones you do not.  Basic recipe is very good and EASY.  My husband added cheese and bacon bits to the top of his but I did not because I just wanted the potato soup comfort.

with additional veggies, like carrots and maybe corn, the recipe will have a more full flavor. It is a very good start. make sure to chop veggies into very small pieces.

I made this last night for a youth group gathering.  I actually decided to make it an hour before it was served.  It was quick, easy, and delicious!  I also served another soup and of the two, this one was gone by the end of the night.  I love it when people rave about the food I serve!  This one's a keeper.

My family really enjoyed this soup!  You may have to adjust the thickness by adding milk to thin.My husband suggested the addition of some diced, smokey ham, but it is certainly a meal in itself without the meat.  I served with asiago cheese bread and it was a great choice.

This is the first time I have ever made potato soup and it turned out great! I made it for my roomates and it was gone in no time with no leftovers! It was very easy to follow and most of all tasted great!

This is WONDERFUL!!! I accidentally bought a small container of half and half, so it was about 1.5 cups half and half and then 1.5 cups of 2% milk. I was short a cup of liquid, but it didn't matter! Such a good base.

Omg, this is the best recipe! If sauce to thin just take some liquid soup in a bowl mix with more flour and return to pot. I added 1/2 lb of crushed fried bacon and the dripping, fantastic! You can add at least 2 cups more potatoes if you like it really chunky as I did.

I followed the recipe as written with the exception of using 1% milk instead of half-and-half.  I also mashed up a few of the potatoes to thicken a bit.  It was stupendous!  Great recipe!!

Perfect recipie as it is but I have a potato fettish as do my daughters. My husband has to have some meat. As such I added in a few chopped strips of cooked bacon for him and added in more potato. After all the designated cook time was over I added in a couple handfulls of shreadded cheese and cooked for about 5 additional minutes before serving.    As such it turned out with a bit more flavor and was like eating the worlds best stuffed potato only in a soup style.

I love this recipe!  We use leeks instead of onion and add some bacon, but this recipe is excellent!! I have a hard time getting the soup to thicken, but always end up dumping in some extra flour or cornstarch if we get desperate. Perfect every time! (No matter how I mess it up)

This soup is easy to throw together.  It is very creamy and tasty.  I made a few changes: I didn't have any celery so I added one can of cream of celery soup.  I also added 1/2 tsp. salt.  Delicious on a cold night!

Very good.  I took the advice of others and blended a portion of the cooked vegetables to make it creamier.  A lot of people complained about it being salty.  I didn't think it was salty at all.

I've made this recipe as written and it was definitely worth 5 stars.  The flavor was perfect.  This time, I added a couple items, looking for more of a 'Baked Potato' soup.  I fried about 12 strips of really meaty bacon until they were very crisp, and then cut them up to add when I put the vegies back in the pot.  I also added 8 oz. of Smoked Black Pepper White Cheddar Cheese cubes to the sauce as it was thickening.  To make sure it wasn't too salty with the addition of bacon and cheese, I used a low fat/low sodium chicken broth.  It came out just right and had a very creamy texture.  It was a hit at my house!  Thanks for a wonderful recipe.

I adjusted this recipe a bit to our taste, and it turned out well. I added an extra potato, and pureed about 2/3 of the potatoes to make for a thicker base, and left 1/3 chunky to give the soup some depth. I also added green onions and some cheese. I used a bit too much broth, but that was fine since I just added more milk (ran out of half-and-half). Overall, we would make this again, thanks!.

I was having my family over for dinner and needed a soup course. This soup was amazing! I added a tablespoon of garlic powder, an extra 1/4 teaspoon of blk pepper (luv fresh ground pepper) and 2 chopped green onions. They all loved it! Even my picky brother! They've already asked that I make this soup again next weekend. This recipe is a keeper!

Superb soup!  I added my own touches adapted from another favorite potato soup recipe--2 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce and 1 tsp. dry mustard.  These additions made it even more flavorful.  I like lots of potatoes in my soup, so I used two extra cups of chopped potatoes.  Incidentally, after cooking the vegetables for 15 minutes in the two cups chicken broth, there wasn't a whole lot to drain--the potatoes soaked up most of it.  After thoroughly mixing the flour/butter mixture into the half & half, I added the remaining chicken broth and the seasonings, made sure it was mixed until smooth, then added the vegetables and finished heating.  I also used 4 tsps. chicken boullion granules instead of chicken boullion cubes.  This is definitely a recipe I will keep on hand.

We LOVE this potato soup!  I've made it a couple times now and it's always a big hit.  I add about 3 extra potatoes to have it be a bit more chunky.  We top it with crumbled bacon and shredded cheese.

Yummy!  A great recipe that you can either add to, or leave alone!  I've made it with the addition of sauted garlic and bacon, which was good.

The family likes it best when I run the whole mess through the blender

For those who want this recipe to end up thicker, I recommend making a roux out of the butter and flour before adding the (cold) chicken broth to the pot.  This will result in a thicker soup.

When I made this, I cooked the potatoes (about 8 medium) in a pot with their skins until they were soft.  While those were cooking, I cut up the onion, celery, and about a half a bag of baby carrots, which I then sautéed in the 6 TBSP of butter.  Once the onions were starting to look clear, I added the flour and created a roux, which thickened up my soup when I added the water and chicken bouillon cubes (this recipe does not need actual chicken broth to be successful).  As the broth mixture got warmer and started to thicken, I added a cup and a half of chopped ham into the soup, along with the drained potatoes and the half and half.  After cooking it for a while, I also added a cup of Velveeta cheese, cubed to give the soup more flavor.  This turned out wonderfully, just like the soup I grew up eating at my mom's house.  I will definitely make this again-it was so good!

I tried this recipe & as Thumper mentioned found it very salty. 
I began adapting & came up with a potato soup, while quite different, but I thought worth a mention. I used a cup more potatoes than the recipe called for(we like ours more chunky so they were cut into about 1/2"chunks. I put a pound of baby carrots to simmer in a pot filled with chicken stock (stock is a personal preference). Added a corn cob (The cob gives the most amazing flavor to any soup or stew).(cut the kernels off the cob & save the cobs in the freezer). I decided to use bacon & a spicy link sausage (cut into think bite size rounds) and put those together to sauté in a skillet. When finished I drained the bacon and sausage & set aside. In the same skillet I added a little butter & sautéed onion, celery, garlic & cracked pepper then added those to the pot with the carrots. At that point I added 2 small drained cans of chopped green chilis I had on hand. My soup was growing but smelled amazing. I dug in my refrigerator and found part of a head of cabbage. Washed and chopped into fair size chunks, it was destined for my soup. At this point I added the potatoes but kept aside a cup to cook alone (mash & add to thicken). About 10 minutes before the potatoes were cooked I added the bacon, Sausage, Milk & cabbage. When that was done I added the mashed potatoes & shredded cheddar cheese. Then salt and pepper to taste.

I found this recipe when looking for a way to use up a lot of half and half.  There was very nice flavor to this soup, but it was a little thin for our preference.  I made it as written and I would make it again, but next time I would thicken it a little more and up the pepper to 1 teaspoon.

I too am in love with this soups taste. I do put it in crockpot then later add canned milk, butter and flour for help to thicken along with mashing it all a bit. I also like to add pieces of   homemade noodles broke in bits.Thank you Thumper

Great flavor!  I used whole milk instead of half and half to cut down on fat and it turned out wonderful.  I added chopped green onion as a garnish, which added even more flavor.  My only suggestion would be to use more potatoes...we had a lot of the soup left over but not many potatoes in it.

Easy to make.  It was really, really salty, though, and I even cut down on the boullion cubes AND cut out the bacon entirely.  Next time I'll use less boullion.

It tastes even better reheated the next day!

Very good and I love that everything cooks in one pot.  Next time I will add bacon or ham because I think it needed a little salty on top.  Very good recipe overall, will definitely make again.

This soup is awesome. I used chicken stock instead of boullion and also added fresh bacon bits and parsley for flavor. The soup was so delicious, it didn't last very long although it was a very large batch. Yummmm!

Amazing is the only word I have for this soup!
My Mum couldn't stop saying Mmm!
My Father is a picky eater and even he liked it!
I didn't change much except I used all the broth to cover the taters 'cause I used a very large pot.
I made some Irish soda bread with it the first time. (recipe by irishfishstick ) We finished the leftovers last night with the chapati bread recipe by INSHA87! You have got to try this soup!
I would suggest the low sodium broths and the called for amount bouillon cubes for the perfect saltiness!

I have been sick, so have just been eating soups. Thought of Potato Soup, and came by to see what I could find. 

This Potato Soup is the best I have ever made.  Even the potato soup my Mother made was no compairison to this.  And so I gave it a 5 star rating

Would be 5 stars, but a little too bland for our tastes as written.  After simmering for a few hours hubs said, "You better taste this-it needs something."  I added some cajun seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, thyme and a little dill.  Tasted again, and added salt and a little tabasco.  Towards the end I put probably 2 cup shredded cheddar cheese in as I had used regular milk instead of the half-half.  We topped ours with some bacon bits and more cheese.  Pretty good, but I have other potato soups I prefer.  Thanks anyway Thumper.

This soup was amazing!  I halved it 'cause we have small children who aren't big eaters - but now I wish we had had leftovers!!!  Instead of using butter, I used coconut oil which worked just as well for thickening and the flavour was excellent!  I made it into a "cream of potato" by using my hand blender,  mostly for the kids sake as they are not aware of the fact that they are eating ONIONS when I do that!! haha....I had half and half this time in my fridge, so I used it, next time will use milk as we found it a teeny tiny bit rich.  We all really enjoyed it as a creamy soup!

This soup is totally easy to make and my whole family is obsessed with it.  I substitute a few shallots for onions because I prefer the flavor and I've even tried making it with fat-free half and half.  Still delicious.    Add a few handfuls of shredded cheese to it just before it's finished cooking and it gets a little gooey-er.  Delicious.  Our go-to Sunday football watching soup (c:

Wonderful soup. I did add other veges that I wanted to use up and it handled the additions just fine. I threw in 6 spears asparagus, 1/2 head cabbage, 6 carrots; all diced bite size. Could have used more asparagus but I was just using up what I had left over. It cooked down and was perfect without adding any additional liquid. Everyone loved it.

I love comfort food!  I made a few changes, not because I don't trust the submitters recipe but because I'm broke!  I used chicken boullion instead of canned chicken broth and low fat milk instead of cream.  It was still bomb diggity.

Seems too easy!  We have potato soup every Cmas even and we always argue about it.  This was the first year we didn't argue!    We added carrots and bacon.  Get the potatoes to the desired tenderness and texture.  Had with Chardonnay, it was fabulous!

Very good start!  My grandmother used to make an amazing potato soup and this was a great start!  I added 1c sour cream, 3t paprika and more black pepper.  It was perfect!

I am not a big potatoe soup fan, but I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was a quick, easy, flavorful answer to a chilly day.  I halfed the recipes and it actually feed three comfortably.  I did add diced carrots for color and flavor.  A time saver was I used the diced potatoes that come in a can.  Already peeled and the perfect, uniform size for this recipe and I didn't have to worry whether the potatoes were cooked to the right texture.  Fantastic.  Thanks.

This reminds me of the soup we had as a kid!! I loved it. The only thing I will do differently is put less celery in it.

Excellent recipe as written. Although the picture shows orange bits which are not included in the recipe. Just curious what they are.

This soup was wonderful!! Everyone loved this soup, I followed the recipe pretty closely but used skim milk instead of half and half. It was still amazing!

This is a good potato soup.  I added chopped carrots,1 c.chopped ham & 2 cloves garlic to the potato mixture.  The step of separating the broth that the potatoes are cooked in was really unnecessary.  I used one whole box of the chicken broth..32 oz. I think which ended up being less than the 3 cans.  I did not use the chicken boullion--don't like the stuff & I think it worked well without it.  I will keep this one with the changes I made.

This is buy far the best potato soup I have ever made! My husband and I both loved it and it was great for left overs the next day too! I cut the recipe in half, but the broth part I only cut by about 1/4th. I think it needed it for boiling in the begining. Will make as often as possible!

My little brother was wary when he saw the recipe name was for the "ultimate" potato soup but after he had it he couldn't deny it was pretty much the ultimate soup. Makes a ton of soup. I added some cooked bacon to the soup and left some over to top off the soup with cheese. have made it at least 5 times already :-)

My family loves this soup! My husband requests it every week during the winter. The only change that I made was that I only used 2 cans of chicken broth, I like my potato soup a little thicker. I served it with a crusty french bread that was great for dipping. This is a keeper!

I couldn't bring myself to put the onion and celery in the broth to boil without first sauteeing them, so I cooked them in the butter first, which meant I needed to put the soup together in slightly different order. I cooked the potatoes in the broth, added the flour to the sauteed vegetables and butter and then added that roux to the cooked potatoes and broth and simmered until thickened, then added the cream. I found the soup was a little thicker than I'd like and could use a few more potatoes, but the flavor was good. I served topped with bacon. It's very chowder-like and you could probably add some clams and clam broth and have a great clam chowder.

This soup is soooo good.  I made 1/2 of a batch with 2% milk cause I didn't have 1/2 n 1/2.I added a little bacon for flavor also. Still turned out creamy and delicious. I served it in bread bowls the kids loved it and my husband told me to add it to my recipe book which means he really liked it!  Will be making this again soon!

What a wonderful recipe!  I made it for the first time as the recipe says, changing only that I sauteed the veggies first, used veggie broth and boullion cubes, and for the most part used organic products.  I thought it was too creamy, and half and half is about 4x as much $ as milk, so the next time I used whole milk, increasing the amount of butter and corn starch 2tbs each.  I kept the milk/broth mixture over med-low heat, stirring with a whisk until it was thick.  I also made this one time by blending part of the soup to make it thicker, but the texture was far too grainy for my taste.  I thought it turned out much better with the extra butter and cornstarch, and this time I added an extra cup of milk because I put extra veggies in.  One time I also put a Parmigiano Reggiano rind in the mix, and left it in for the life of the soup.  It added a terrific zing to the body of the soup.  I like this recipe because you can add extra celery, potatoes, (and carrots) without doing major adjusting to the recipe.

Amazing soup, followed the recipe exactly and this soup was to die for!!  Next time I think I will had the same amount of celery as potatos and a little bit more onions to give it a little diversity.  Again, great recipe!

Tasty. Recommend topping with cheese, scallions and bacon as others suggested! Did notice the recipe was a bit overstated when it said it would serve 12. I would say it serves 6-8 at best. Thanks for the recipe!

It was so delicious!  I can't say enough about this.  I did use unsalted butter since it was known to be salty.  I also added bacon and sharp cheddar on top of each serving. Great recipe..I will definitely be using it time and time again and I plan on passing it on also!  Thanks!

This was good soup.  I made it exactly as the recipe shows, but next time I will definately be switching a few things. For one, use 2% instead of half and half. If you let the entire soup simmer on LOW/MEDIUM, it WILL thicken, just be patient. You can definately cut down on the bullion.  Also, I thought it was missing something....ham or bacon.  I added it after and it's great! Just throw some cheddar cheese on top, and it's fabulous!!

My family considers themselves true soup 
lovers so after our last trip to New Orleans, my 9 year old daughter who is a Food Network junkie begged me to try and recreate the potatoe soup we had there for lunch..We searched recipes and this one seemed good.The recipe is great but we kicked it up a notch.We added another 1/2 tsp of ground pepper,aprox 3 tbsp of bacon greese (it is so bad for you, but tastes oh soo good!)I substituted 1 cup of half and half for 1 cup of heavy whipping cream,and we added chopped carrots and sweet corn.I also added 1 tsp of garlic salt.Lastly we topped each bowl of soup with fresshly grated sharp cheddar cheese,scallions,and fresh bacon pieces.
These added ingredients do not make it healthier but it was hearty and very tastey.Everyone asked for seconds.

I too trimmed the fat and salt in this one - I used 2% milk and pureed about half the soup to make it really thick and creamy. I also used homemade chicken stock, so no salt to worry about from the bullion.

So, I made this a little different. I used a pint of heavy whipping cream plus a half a pint of water, chicken stock. Instead of making them separate, I went ahead and stirred in the cream into the potatoes and veggies. I sauteed the onions and celery with about 3 cloves of minced garlic and 2 tbsp of butter, in addition to the 6 tbsp. I will probably add more potatoes and smash them a little, and some sort of bacon or something. It was VERY good. Thanks!

Yummy!  Perfect family meal with a loaf of fresh home made bread.  (Well, in my case defrosted, premade dough -- but it was warm!)  Excellent recipe, thanks!

Fantastic recipe!  It is absolutely wonderful.  I made a few slight changes to suit my tastes, but I'm sure it's great as is.  I added in three or four large garlic cloves, crushed, with the onion mixture after boiling, and used a bit of garlic salt instead of regular salt.  I substituted two cups of the half and half with heavy whipping cream (which will make anything taste good).  I also substituted two cans of sweet corn in for the celery.  Voila!  My new favorite potato soup recipe.  Thanks!

I LOVE this recipe.  I have made it twice in the last month.  I have used whole milk both times instead of half and half, and I used only 1-2 boullion cubes to cut down on the salt.  The second time I added carrots, and that made it even better.

The chicken broth is the key here! It adds great flavor to the veggies. Cheated for convenience and just cooked potatoes, carrots, onions (added chopped garlic), then when all tender, just added a little half & half & milk, heated through & added salt & pepper, skipped the other steps etc.  Turned out fabulous, didn't use flour or anything else. Thanks for the chicken broth idea!

What a great recipe. My family doesn't care for cooked celery, so I used carrots instead. Then I added some ham during the cooking. Afterward, we topped with fresh chopped green onion and cheese!!

Great recipe. I followed the advice of other postings and used skim milk instead of half and half. I also added about 3 cups of chopped broccoli florets and 10 or so slices american cheese which added great flavor!

This is the best!  You can use whole milk instead of half & half and it's just as good.  The key to thickening the soup is allowing it to simmer after adding the flour mixture.  If you're patient, it will thicken.  I've even used 1% milk and it worked.  Served with bacon bits, grated cheese & chives, this is as good as any restaurant!

This was wonderful. We thoroughly enjoyed this soup.  I added some carrots as suggested and also sauteed all the veggies before adding the stock to boil for a little extra flavor. Topped with a little cheddar cheese it made a great meal.  Dished up the leftovers and froze to bring to some sweet old ladies at church.

I followed the recipe as close as I could, but I added bacon, halved the bullion, and used whole milk (what I had) and thickened it up with 1 tbsp. of cornstarch & milk...  I halved the recipe, but wish I had made the 12 servings instead!

A nice creamy soup.  I omitted the celery and bullion (because i didn't have any).    I also added a few more cups of potatoes and a bit more onion. I just added a bit of salt and pepper to taste.  I also didn't add extra broth since I thought it was the perfect thickness already. It was still very very delicious.  I think next time I will do it the same and add some garlic and parsley.

AWESOME!!! MY PICKY BROTHER LOVED IT!  Like other posters I used only chicken broth instead of water.  I also added 1 tbs of galic and parsley flakes and extra potatoes. YUMMY!

I have made this soup too many times to count, everyone loves it.  To add a bit of a twist to this soup, I add cooked Turkey Sausage to the soup in the last 10 minutes of cooking.  I also garnish with fresh kale and bacon.  The outcome is a soup very much like  Zuppa Toscana soup from the Olive Garden.

This is a good recipe.  I used red potatoes and substituted minced scallions for the chopped onion.  I upped the pepper to 1 tsp. (we love pepper) and will most likely add more next time.  I also added 2 cloves of minced garlic, about 2 oz. of minced pimento and a dash of cayenne.  I also took other reviewers suggestion and lightened it up (but not too much) by using only 2 c. half and half and 2 c. lowfat milk.  Next time I will probably use milk only as it was still very rich and I don't think that we would miss those extra calories.  Thanks Chrisee!

This was REALLY good!  Very creamy and full of flavor.  Not too salty for us, just right!  I would add more of the broth for cooking the potatoes/onions/celery though.  My family really enjoyed it.

I made this recipe tonight for the first time.  I have never made potato soup before and it came out great.  It had alot of flavor and my whole family loved.  I have never left a review before but this went over so well I decided I would leave a review.  I did add a little extra flour to thicken.  We added bacon and cheese at the table and we ate it in bread bowls.  It was a great dinner.

Excellent!!  Everyone really liked this.  I did alter the recipe to what I had on hand.  I used a can of evaporated milk with skim milk to make the amount of half-half.  I also added a lb of smoked sausage to the boiling vegetables.  This turned out great ,  for added thickness I stired in some cornstarch.  Thanks for the recipe.

Yes this is a winner--will make again.  I added some carrot chunks with the potatoes, used 2 c. heavy cream and 2 c. 1% milk, added some fresh spinach when heating at the end just because we had some.   Added about a fourth of the vegetables to the hot milk and broth mixture and blended it with the stick blender!  Pour it all together and heated!
Served with crumbled bacon!

I made so many changes but it still turned out to be delicious!  Didn’t have cream so I used low fat milk plus half a can of coconut milk.  I am a vegetarian so I left out the bacon and used 1/4 cup of EVOO instead and I used whole wheat for the flour. This recipe is indestructible!

Love this soup and followed the recipe except I substituted milnot for the half and half and I added some celery seed. I also use a potato masher in the soup to make it a little thicker. Everyone said it was the best potato soup ever.

Delicious potato soup recipe!  I would say that it is on the salty side (even for me and I love salt!), so I think you could probably skip the bouillon cubes at the end and it would still taste great.  I top with bacon (baked in the oven) and cheddar cheese and either scallions or chives, depending on what I have around.  It is very flavorful and yummy!

I've been searching for a good potato soup and I finally decided to give this a shot. It turned out great and as a bonus my kids thought it was better than what we had at our local Chilis Restaurant. They are the pickiest kids ever so that's got to mean something. The only downside is that I had a little leftover but after sitting in the fridge overnight it got really thick. Not necessarily a bad thing but something to think about. I may use a little less flour (or none at all) than called for next time.

I made this soup and loved it! I made 2 small modifications to it though. First I added some celery salt as it was just missing something. The second thing I did was add 2 cups of Colby Jack cheese to it. Being born and raised in Wisconsin it was not completed until it has the cheese. Once I made those adjustments it was perfect. I will definitely be making this again.

ok I have made this 4 times now and its wonderful. You can make this with chicken broth or even vegetable broth. I add carrots to it as well. Plus if you want it thicker I would add mozzarella cheese. I put one whole bag, but if you have another one open I would also add that to the bunch. My father in law even said him self "I'm almost 55 years old and this is the best potato soup I ever had in my whole entire life." well happy eating everyone

Great basic recipe, didn't have half n half so used a can of evaporated milk and the 2% milk on hand, mashed some of the potatos with the spoon to thicken a bit more. As I was cooking the celery taste was a bit strong so I picked about half of it out.  Also used granulated garlic and topped it off with green onion when almost done! 
Thanks!

I have made this three times now and it's been a hit each time. I usually add about 1/2 pound of cooked ham chopped into small cubes and cook it about 1/2 hour or so just to blend things together nicely. Great potato soup loved by everyone I've served it to.

Pretty good soup but to avoid the saltiness of that many boullion cubes use a quality chicken base and go easy.  Season and flavor as you go so to speak.  Also ditch the combining of reserved liquid and half and half.  Instead make a roux with flour and butter then slowly add your reserved liquid and thicken slowly until you reach your individual favorite level of thick soup.  Add back the solids and bring to proper temperature.  Finish with the half and half slowly.  Or even better scald milk in a separate pan, add to your soup and finish with cream....it's still a really easy recipe!  Besides half and half is really only for your coffee.  

Part 2:  I initially had reservations about the "boiling" of the almost mirepoix....btw I added finely diced carrot...since the liquids were saved the flavor of the onion, celery and carrot essence weren't wasted and anyway, I drained the solids and did the sauce thing....I've spent the last two hours turning this simple soup into a masterpiece.  If you want it to be a bit thinner don't add chicken stock...lightly add 2% milk....this is goodness.

I made this last night for dinner.  My husband said it was the best potato soup I've ever made.  However, I changed some things. I used 1 c half and half and 3 c 1% milk since I added 8 slices of crispy pieces of bacon at the end and didn't need any more fat in it. I didn't see the need to drain and reserve broth if you are adding it back in and also substituted 1 heaping teaspoon of chicken base for the boiuillon.  I made a roux with the butter in a separate pan, then gradually added milk/ cream to thicken. Then added to the potatoes, veggies mixture. I added some more of the chicken broth(low sodium), but only enough to get to the thick consistency I like.  I added the crispy bacon and threw in about a cup or so of Kraft shredded sharp cheese with Philly. Last minute thought and it made it absolutely  perfect and creamy.  Potato soup always thickens in the frig, so when we eat the leftovers, I will thin it with some of the chicken broth that was leftover from the qt.  Sorry this is so far removed from the recipe, but I got carried away with my own way to do it.  It's what cooking is about.

I made all in one pot. Potatoes, celery, onion, butter, and 6 coves of garlic. Browned a little all together... added flour then chicken stock, chicken stock powder, cream and milk. Added pepper to taste. I then added a bag of sweet white corn frozen. Cooked until potatoes were soft. Cooked chopped bacon ends for garnish along with shredded cheddar cheese.  Was AWESOME

Easy, forgiving and tasty. I used whatever I had in the pantry and fridge. To the cooking veggies I added 2 handfuls chopped carrots, 1/2 fresh jalapeno (diced and seeded), 2 cloves fresh pressed garlic, 1 peeled and chopped apple.  At the end, I substituted 2 packets Herbox sodium-free chicken boullion for the cubes, and added 1 can drained corn, 1 large can undrained chunk chicken, and leftover rotisserie chicken. I topped with cooked crisp bacon and shredded Mexican cheese blend.

I made the recipe pretty much as written. I did use 2% milk instead of  half & half. I blended about one fourth at the end then added it back to the pan. My grandchildren and picky son came back for seconds. It is a good basic potato soup and people can adjust to suit family taste buds easily. Thank you for posting

I made this recipe and added some extras to personalize it. I have made it once with carrots and shrimp and a few dashes of cayenne pepper to give a spicy bite. But my fiance is allergic to seafood so I added cubed chicken breast instead. He loves it so much that he insists I make a weeks supply at a time.

WONDERFUL potato soup - fantastic on its own or as a solid base for many variations!  The exact recipe is excellent but a little too salty for my taste, even when cutting the bouillon in half.

I made some minor modifications to better use what I had on hand and to reduce the sodium level.  
(A) 36 oz (3 12 oz cans) of evaporated milk instead of half and half to reduce the fat and because it's easier to have on hand during recent snow storms that made grocery store trips difficult
(B) a 32 oz unsalted chicken broth/stock
(C) 1 tbsp L B Jamison's sodium free chicken flavored soup base instead of bouillon cubes (you can use this stuff to make the chicken stock - 5 tsp per quart of boiling water)
(D) 1 tsp of salt when using this base as "the" soup because I had removed other major sodium sources (now I know of and control how much salt)

I open my chicken stock and just poured enough over the potatoes, onions, and celery to cover them for simmering about 15 minutes.  In a separate bowl, I melt the butter, whisk in the flour, salt and pepper and then the milk before stirring into the pot with the cooked potato mix and adding the remaining chicken stock.  Cook on a low simmer for 5-10 minutes and it's done!

I often leave that tsp of salt out when I use this as a base and add some other things for flavors that bring their own salt along like bacon bits, cheddar cheese, cubed ham.  My family loves this with soup with a cup of cheddar cheese melted in.  Toss in leftover chicken, ro

I have made many potato soups over the years. I made this for New Years day for a crowd. I did not want anything too rich as we can add condiments and having other rich foods. I am very happy with the results. The only changes I made were to eliminate the flour and simply pureed half the potatoes. I added 9 slices of crumbled bacon I happened to have. I also felt my onions were not very strong ( sweet onions so I added a few dehydrated onion flakes) a dash of celery salt and pepper. The family really loves it! Addendum: I served this not just for family today but for a crowd w green onions bacon bits and shredded sharp cheddar . It was gone in a flash! Thank goodness I had other tasty food. A six quart crock pot was barely enough.

I've made this soup recipe several times now, and I love it! I add sliced carrots, to add color and extra flavor. Otherwise, I follow the recipe as written.

This was very good. I changed it slightly by adding carrots along with the celery. I also mashed some of the potatoes

Love this potato soup. I use chicken base instead of bullion. I also add some of the bacon and drippings to the soup while it's cooking.

This soup was great! The only reason why I knock off a star is because I felt it was needing something a little extra, so I added nutmeg and it pulled it together perfectly! Family went nuts over it and we served t in bread bowls. Total hit!

Everyone in my family loved this soup! We all went back for seconds! I added some turkey sausage to it to make it a complete meal. And like some of the others said,  I used milk instead of half and half. So wonderful! I'll definitely be making this one a lot in the winter months.

I love this recipie! I did 2 things differently. First off, everything is better with bacon, so I cooked some bacon in the pot first, set aside the finished bacon to add later, and left the grease in the pot for more flavour. WOW. Second, I poured about half of it into a blender to make it just a little bit more creamy! Great recipie!

I liked this recipe but had to modify it for what I had on hand. I also halved the recipe. I added a few carrots based on one of the other reviews and kept the celery. I cut the liquid down some for a thicker soup. I also added a little turkey bacon and used low sodium chicken base instead of the bouillon cubes. We thought the it was really good on it's own, but we added "Alabama Fire Crackers" (from this website) to the soup and it was amazing.

A most excellent potato soup! I've used the same basic recipe with several different vegetables to make different cream soups and found it to be most versatile, as well.  I've also tossed in a bit of ham or ham and cheese and had great results.  My partner loves it.

I made this exactly as written and wish I had read reviews first. Definitely would not use half and half and would put celery in food processor. It was still a harder texture than everything else. It was ok, but added a little cheese to add some flavor.

Really good. Only thing I did differently was to carmelize the onions. Topped with cheddar cheese. Bacon would have been nice but I didn't have any.

Best potato soup I have ever had! The only thing I did different was added 1 can of cream of celery to the half and half mixture for a little added thickness. My husband loves this and he even adds a little crumbled bacon and cheese to his. Thanks for sharing!!

Delicious. I streamlined this recipe by cooking the potatoes, celery and onions in all the broth. Slowly added in the half and half when it was finished cooking and then whisked in the melted butter/flour mixture. to add the smokiness of bacon (which I did NOT add cause this soup is fat enuf) I added 1/2 tsp of smoky paprika. Worked like a charm!!! I cut down the half and half by about 1/2 a cup. All those other steps unnecessary!

I made this for a family get together.  I added carrots only because I had some that needed to be eaten.  I also added 1/4 cup of Velveeta cheese and 1 can of cream of mushroom with garlic. This soup is the best I've ever had !and the compliments just keep coming! I've made it twice since then.  My girls keep asking for it in the dinner rotation.

Really good with a few additives.  I used more potatoes.  I put in more potatoes and a carrot.  a teaspoon of thyme makes a big difference.  I put a dollop of sour cream on top of each bowl.

I followed the recipe exactly as written the first time and we really enjoyed it. The next time I added diced ham into the soup, when I served it I put chopped green onions and shredded cheese on top of the soup and  buttered Italian bread on the side. It was really delicious!

I wasnt impressed.  I made the recipe as is but found it a bit bland, tasted like flour to me.  I was able to doctor it up with some garlic powder, black pepper and about two cups of shredded cheddar jack cheese.  I think Ill keep looking for my Go-To Potato soup recipe

Although it took a little work to thicken, due to my inexperience with soup making, it tasted fantastic! My boyfriend had two bowls for dinner and one for breakfast, he loved it too!

I took the advice of others and sautéed up some garlic, onion,celery, carrot and mushroom and then added that with the potatoes. Also seasoned it with Old Bay and it was such a nice taste. Could easily add some clams and mussels to leftovers(if there are any!) to make this a nice seafood chowder.

It was great!!.  The kids and I loved it.  Great for a chilly afternoon dinner.  I used some dill weed, thyme, bacon and more potatoes in it to season to taste.

This was an excellent soup.  I didnt have celery on hand so I chopped 4 carrots and added a cup of frozen peas. I added one cow brand cheese to the sauce. I didnt puree as stated in the recipe and it came out nice a creamy.  Next time I will try and make it with less fat. This would make a great clam chowder.

It says a lot when my father in law asked me for this recipe!  We served everything bagels along with this soup as it's a nice addition.  I do use a potato masher at the end just a few times to break up the big chunks and make it creamier.

I whipped this baby up in about 1/2 an hour this afternoon, by creatively combining steps while maintaining the basic ingredients, if not exact proportions.  And it turned out FAB-U-LOUS! I hard boiled 8 c of water, 3 TBSP chicken bouillon, 1 1/2 tsp (ish) of pepper, 4 minced cloves of garlic, 1 chopped onion, 1 1/2 to 2 tsp of celery seed, 8 peeled, chopped medium sized spuds and a cube of real butter, til the potatoes were mush.  I separated out 1 c of liquid, then used a potato masher to mash up everything else in the pot.  I added 3 c of cream to the 1 c of liquid, then slowly added the potato soup mixture to the cream mixture, 1 c at a time, stirring a bit between.  I let it set while hubby made french bread garlic cheese toast.  It was amazing to see all 4 of my picky kids snork down on it.  Won't make it too often because of the high fat content, but it's a lovely treat for a cold, rainy day!

Wow this was great, followed this recipe, however just love bacon, so while potatoes, celery and onion were boiling in (my homemade chicken broth) I cut up 1/2 pound bacon and cooked until crisp then drained out bacon renderings (instead of butter) and mixed with the flour and pepper to make the rue and then added more chicken broth and half and half.  It turned out exceptional and served with homemade wholegrain croutons.  Thanks, this recipe is awesome, will definately intend to make over and over again.  Yes it was our St. Patty's Day treat!

Awesome recipe- very yummy!  I tweeked a little-  I only used 2 cans of chicken broth, used 3/4 of a small onion and also sauteed the onion and celery first.  I had to add a little water when cooking potatoes because 2 cups broth wasn't enough to cover potatoes to cook.  Also only used 2 chicken bouillon cubes, added salt and 1 tablespoon butter towards end of cooking.  Only had enough half and half for 3 1/2 cups but it was enough.  When plating I added some parsley and a little shredded white cheddar.  Very good recipe.  Next time will try it with bacon- This is a keeper!

Really enjoyed this soup - was rich but not over the top.  I didn't have bouillon so used this instead (http://www.knorr.com/product/detail/245812/chicken-stock)...have been using that alot in soups/sauces as it doesn't have the bouillon chemical taste.  Oh, also, I was going to throw in some bacon but didn't have any so I put some leftover summer sausage...everyone loved it.  Will keep this in mind next time I buy potatoes.

A good base.  I halved all the ingredients except potatoes.  I cubed up a few more than half.  I also added 1/4 teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 teaspoon sweet Hungarian paprika, 1 tablespoon dried parsley flakes and 1/2 teaspoon Old Bay seasoning.  To give it a bit of sparkle I put in about 12 drops of Louisiana hot sauce.  This does not add heat, but brings out the other flavors.  I believe without my additions it would have been too bland for my taste.

I am in the process of making this right now. :) I first came across this because my grandmother used to make some Potato soup for me when i was a kid. When she passed no one could find the recipe. So i came here in hopes to find something similar! This is the closest i could find and i am ecstatic! The only thing i did was added 2 small potatoes and 1 bouillon cube and about 1 cup of Cheddar Cheese. It is SO good!Thank you Thumper74137!

This is a good potato soup. I left out the celery and used a large yellow onion, chopped. Instead of using cans of chicken broth and bouillon I just used water and boullion granules. I didn't need the flour, I kind of forgot. This was great. I added some creole type seasoning on top. I used two cups milk/2 cups half and half.

This was a really good base. I added italian sausage, used 1 % milk, and cut back on the boullion, and it was really good.  I will definitely make again!

This soup was pretty good.  I would have liked for it to be a little thicker.

This soup was easy to make and tasted very good.  It made a lot for my small family of 3, so I froze some.   I used all reduced sodium products and it could have used some kick.  I think I'll put some bacon in it when I heat it up next time.

This is a wonderful and filling soup.  Perfect with some french bread or a side salad for supper.  I added in some sliced carrots and a can of corn.  Delicious!

I only had skim milk on hand, so mine turned out more runny than it was intended, but it still tasted great! It was also really easy to make, so I will definitely be making it again. I added some garlic and parsley for some added flavor since I didn't have any bouillon cubes.

Loved it.  I used a little corn starch to thicken rather than flour but other than that made exactly as directed.  It's a keeper.

Really great recipe!  My husband loved it, but asked for more veggies.  Next time I'll add 1 1/2 what is asks for in veggies.  We also added about a teaspoon of salt and pepper to our individual servings, so next time I'll also add in some to the soup itself to heighten the flavors!  Super great other wise!!  Will make again for sure!

I reduced the half and half to three cups and left out the bullion but it came out great. Next time I would use more potatoes and if I do, four cups of half and half would be perfect.

Delicious! I'm a vegetarian so I substituted the chicken broth for veggie stock. I couldn't find veggie bouillon so I just left it out (needed want the extra salt anyway). I also added shredded cheddar cheese to the top after it was in the bowl. I am by no means a good chef =) and this recipe was also very easy for me, and my first try at homemade potato soup. Kids loved it too.

Delicious!  I cut it in half and got around 4 large bowls.  I can't have dairy, so I substituted rice milk for the cream and added an extra T. of flour and butter, but then it actually ended up being too thick so I added some more broth.  I also added some bacon and diced carrots. Turned out great!

1/6/2010:  made this again tonight, and each time i make this, I like it more.  I didn't have any half and half so I used 2 cups whole milk and 2 cups of 2% milk.  It was still fabulous, and I'm guessing a lot kinder on the calories.  Sprinkle a little cheese on the top, served with garlic toast and this is one perfect winter meal!!!!

This was the best soup ever.  Like everyone else, I made a few changes, but stayed with the basic recipe given.  I added in some bacon and garnished with garlic croutons.  Everyone had seconds.  A "keeper" as my nine year old told me.

I cut back on the chicken broth (2-14 oz cans) and the butter I used 1 stick    (4 Tab)turned out great. My son said it looked like New Eangland clam chowder so I added 2-6.5oz cans of minced clams juice from 1 and just the clams from 2nd can you could add juice from booth depending on how strong you like it.

My family had this soup for dinner tonight.  No one was crazy about it mainly because it's not very hearty.  It would make a good soup course if a main entree followed it.  It is flavorful, but just not filling enough.

Simple and delicious! USE A WHISK to combine the flour/butter mixture, and then again when adding it to the broth, and it will come out nice and creamy, even when using skim milk.

Yummy! I followed the recipe exactly, and my husband was asking when I'd make it next! I think I'll add some carrots next time.

This soup was the best!  It tastes so good on a cold day.  I did add carrots and I also used skim milk instead of half and half.  The most important thing about the soup is the roux and making sure you season the roux.  This is a great soup.

Really good! I halved the recipe but used 4 potatoes instead of 3 since some folks said the broth was a little thin, and it turned out pleasantly thick. I also added 2 carrots.

This was a great recipe! Very easy to make, I added ground italian sausage and kale to soup and it turned out wonderful.
My 4 year old really liked it and wanted to make it again the following day.

Absolutely DELICIOUS!!

My husband and I tried potato soup for the first time in a restaurant recently and loved it - I was hoping to recreate it at home and this recipe tasted just like it!

I added some bacon to it at the end and topped each bowl of soup with shredded cheddar cheese. I also served it with toasted cheese buns. A huge hit!

wonderful! i substituted the half and half for 3:1 rice milk: heavy cream. the rice milk may have given it a sweeter taste, but it was delicious! the celery adds a nice touch. i also added garlic. i made supper for my community group and everyone wanted this recipe.

my dumb butt didn't change the servings and made the 12 when i really only needed for 3 people...lol..but it's ok, at least i have homemade soup for the next couple of days...pretty easy...but didn't turn out as thick as i would have really hoped for...and i didn't even use all the liquids...really salty @ first because of the butter...but now i know...cut down on the butter, and cut down even MORE on the liquids...added carrots, peas and couple of dashes of hot sauce in my bowl...nice kick..

This soup is very good.  I used 1% milk instead of half and half, and a little salt in place of the chicken bouillon.  Served with shredded cheddar, bacon bits and green onions.

Very good! I did not realize that it made 12 servings until i finished cutting the 6 cups of potatoes. I wasnt as creamy as i thought it would be but it was still very good. The half and half made it not so healthy, but it gave the potatoe soup a wonderful flavor!

I am rating this a five star even though i didn't try any. I made this soup for a teacher appreciation day at our school. Parents can bring in a soup and a baked good and the teachers get to spend the afternoon eating it. This soup supposively was the first to be eaten all up and the following day I had to bring in the recipe because all the teachers really enjoyed it. So they say thank you to the creqator of this recipe, it will be enjoyed by many families.

Wonderful soup!  I added cornstarch, more potatoes, and used less milk/half-and-half.  I also left skins on the diced potatoes and  just mashed them a little in the pan before serving--instead of pureeing.  It turned out perfect--thick, chunky, and delicious!

We topped it with cheese, sour cream, bacon bits, and sliced green onions, and served it with a warm baguette piece.  The green onions really added a lot to the final flavor, I think.  Yum.  Make this recipe!!

I wasn't that impressed with this recipe.  It was not creamy enough (it called for way too much broth.  I would use about half the broth called for in the recipe.)  Also, I skipped the buillon cubes (too salty) and added 1 teaspoon dried tarragon for flavor. It wasn't bad, but I believe that the Cold Stone Creek dried potato soup mix tastes better than this homemade version. If I make potato soup again I think I will try the "Absolutely Ultimate Potato Soup" recipe instead.

This is a great potato soup.  I like to add  a few strips of bacon (about 1/2 pound per 4 servings, cooked crisp then crumbled) and  about 3oz of cheddar per 4 servings.  Another interesting variation I tried is to substitute vegetable bouillon instead of chicken bouillon and broth for a vegetarian in the house.  Turned out just as good as the "normal" version.

FANTASTIC!!! This recipe was wonderful. I did add extra broth when boiling my potatoes so I could cook them a little longer.  Also, I added a touch of corn starch to make it a little thicker (for personal preference only).  It was great before adding the corn starch. 
I have definately added this one to the family favorites!

This recipe was really good. I had to change a couple of things because of what I had on hand. I didn't have half-and-half so I used milk and then pureed about 1/4 of the reserved potatoes to thicken the soup. I also didn't have any celery so I added broccoli pieces near the end of cooking and it turned out fabulous. Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent, I even messed up the order in which you make this but it still turned out great, I only had 3 1/2 cups of half and half but  wow, creamy and good, my 7 year old daughter loved it as well.  It is a recipe that I intend to KEEP!

I made this recipe and it is great. My dh is on a low salt diet, so I bought organic low chix broth, and did not add bouillon at all, used all broth instead. I did add a carrot as other reviews had mentioned, garlic and more onion also. I did drain the veges and put half of them thru the blender as has mentioned, and used a bit more thickener as we like thick soups in winter. This was wonderful and low sodium, but not low in flavor-Yum!

I served this recipe to 16 guests in my home last night.  I got great responses, although I myself felt that it is a bit heavy; you could rename it "mashed potato soup", since it is basically a white sauce with broth, potatoes and veggies added.  It's good, though!  I altered it only by substituting the half and half with evaporated milk and water.  The bullion cubes really make the flavor nice.

This soup was good, but I had to add a few things.  I'll be using more potatoes next time.  Also something should be added to thicken the soup next time because it was quite runny.  I put celery salt in it too.  I'll try again and see how it turns out.

This potato soup has the correct name. "Ultimate"!!  The  flavors blended so well that when I heated it up the second day, It was just as good if not better.  The only problem I had was after the potatos and vegatables were done, I didn't have very much broth left.  In the instructions, it didn't say how much or how little you would have left for reserve.  I had maybe 1/3 cup.  I don't know  if that is right but it still turned out GREAT!!!!

Yummo!!!  My daughter and I made this as an appetizer on Thanksgiving.  We blended it together and it came out thick and rich and could have been a meal all by itself!  We used a tip from another rater and used the Hormel pre cooked bacon; that made it super easy. Next time, I think we will serve the bacon on the side as well as the shredded cheese and that will give it a little bit of a crunch and give the vegetarians more options. A perfect meal for a cold winters night!

The real deal... I added light turkey kielbasa at the end. Skim milk worked fine to save some fat but next time I may try FF half and half to give it better color. Very good recipe!
