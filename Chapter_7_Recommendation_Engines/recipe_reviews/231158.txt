Minor tweaking for perfect cornbread.  I'm a transplant to the south and understand cornbread is NOT supposed to be sweet but I snuck two tablespoons of sugar and used bacon grease (yes I did) for the vegetable oil.  It came out PERFECT with the expected crisp bottom!  Our friends father in Alabama made it that way for decades so I followed his lead and it is wonderful!  Saving this to my recipe box!

I am not expert on cornbread, but I thought this was good.  It doesn't crumble in your hand and it isn't sweet, both pluses to me.  Thanks for sharing.

Perfect basic cornbread recipe that you can as a base recipe that is good as is, but if you like to "doctor up" recipes, this is the perfect base.  

If you want sweet corn bread just add sugar -- up to 1/4 cup.  If you want buttermilk cornbread use buttermilk and substitute 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda for the baking powder.  Add creamed corn if you want creamy corn cornbread.  

This is a GREAT base recipe to keep -- no need for 3 cornbread recipes.  Just add want you want to this one.

Tips:  You can melt the butter in the skillet, then pour it into the batter.  No need for another pan.  There'll be a little butter left in the pan, so you won't need the oil. Do NOT overmix.  Mix all the dry ingredients together separately then use a large spoon or spatula to fold the wet and dry together.

Description says it's slightly sweet, and it's not at all. Bland.

Excellent bread with the addition of 1/2 cup sugar.  My husband doesn't normally care for corn bread, but ate this up, as did my 2 year old.  I coated the pan with oil before preheating it and the bread slid right out of the pan after cooling for a bit.  The bread came out crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and minimally crumbly.  This is my new recipe for cornbread!

My family loves this recipe.  I've made it twice and the first time I made it exactly as the recipe detailed and it was a hit (especially with the honey butter I made to accompany it).  The second time I added 1/4 cup honey to the recipe just to lighten it up a bit.  It was still fantastic.  This is my go-to corn bread recipe now.

Final product came out bland and slightly bitter. The actual recipe was easy to prepare but needs some tweaking.

oh, this was good. I didn't make it exactly like it said, I added 1/4 cup of sugar for just a little sweetness. And used 1/3 cup corn flour, 2/3 cup medium grind cornmeal (that was an "oops" on my part, but I went with it). I baked it for 20 minutes and it was perfect. It was a little crumbly but seemed to firm up after it cooled more. Perhaps that is normal, I am pretty much a beginner cook.

Very good recipe. I doubled the recipe, and added one extra egg and a bit of sugar and then made fried corn pancakes. Yummy.

My husband and I loved this! I think it was the butter and "fried" bottom crust that we liked the most.  I didn't soak the cornmeal (forgot!), but prepared as usual... mixed dry together, added wet....I  have an 8-inch pan and baked  it for 18 minutes... It did fine.. I like that it is not sweet, but paired nicely with honey butter. I think next time I will try butter in the pan instead of oil... :-)

All in all this is a great cornbread. I would make it again. It is tender and has a good flavor. It holds together, not crumbling like some skillet recipes. The only thing I would change is to take advise of another reviewer and add some sugar. It just needs a touch of sweetness. I will definitely make these again.

I have rarely eaten cornbread, but I knew hubby liked it so I've tried a couple recipes over the years. And I think this one is my personal favourite so far. I followed some other advice and added more sugar than what was called for (as well as garlic powder) and used bacon fat in the cast iron instead of oil. It gave the edges some nice crispiness. Overall, I loved it, and will use this one again.

Texture was great. Nice and moist. However, it tasted odd. Four teaspoons seems like too much baking powder. Will try again but with 1/2 or 1 teaspoon. Perhaps will try  a little sugar, too.

This is my go-to recipe. I like it a bit crumbly (I serve it under beans) so I modify the recipe a bit by letting the batter sit five minutes after the final mixing, rather than pour it into the skillet right away. That makes it fluffier when you pour it, and crumbly at the finish. Oh, and I use butter or bacon grease instead of oil in the skillet. So easy and yummy.

This is a simple and easy dish to make so it’s  my new default recipe for cornbread.  I did a minor bit of tweaking including using part buttermilk and part milk.  I also added a dash of  ground chipotle  pepper to give it a subtle zing.  I’d probably be a bit more adventurous and generous with the chipotles next time.  It disappeared quickly, so In our household, that signifies a winner.

I wanted a loaf style cornbread I could slice and eat with coffee in the mornings. So I doubled the ingredients except for salt which I did 1.5x. Taste and eat just as nice as a regular loaf of bread. Very tasty and the texture is perfectly great. Loving it, thank you for the recipe.

This recipe makes wonderful corn bread.  Just like you'd expect from cast iron.  The only things I added was 1/2 cup sugar to the flour mixture,  and fresh corn cut right off the cob from 1 ear of corn.  Delicious.  I've made it several times and it's always a winner!

Made this and followed the advice of a couple different reviewers.  I placed the oil in the skillet while it heated up in the oven.  I also added approximately 1/3 cup Turbinado sugar (what I had on hand).  Otherwise followed the recipe as is.  It has got to be some  of the best cornbread we have had both at a restaurant and/or homemade.

I made changes based on the comments of others and I loved it.  I used about 1 1/2 tsp salt, and added 1/4 cup brown sugar, green onions, frozen corn kernels and some cheese (didn't measure them).  It turned out great.  Good texture and it cooked so evenly in the cast iron skillet.  I was really impressed with that  and remembered that that is one of the features of cooking in a cast iron pan is the even heat.  It made me think of trying other quick breads that way too.  It also had a nice crusty bottom.  I cooked for about 25 min.  I would make it again with the changes I made to it as the basic batter is  very good in terms of lightness and consistency.

I'd add a little sugar next time probably just a couple tablespoons.  Other than that great recipe.  Stayed together without crumbling.

Made this last night and it was perfect. I like sweeter cornbread, so I added 1/2 cup sugar like some reviewers, and it was just right for me. I didn't soak the cornmeal; I just mixed the ingredients together. Only other change I made was to sub 1/4 cup buttermilk for part of the milk.  Texture was great - only slightly crumbly and nice and airy. I didn't have a 9" iron skillet, so I used a 8x8 Pyrex baking dish wiped inside with Crisco shortening. It was not preheated, so it took about 25 minutes before it was done. Reheated a piece in a 350F oven for 5-6 minutes this morning for breakfast. Will definitely make this again. I'm going to buy a cast-iron muffin pan to make this in for future meals.

This was really good. It did not crumble, had great taste (I added 1/4 cup of sugar but next time I will only add 1/8) and had great color. Was very easy to make and I loved how you could just stick it in the oven. It also had a very easy clean up. It goes good with about everything!!!!

Three-star as written--to bland.  After trying it and being meh about it, decided to try other reviewers suggestions and adding sugar.  Decided to average it between the suggested 1/4 and 1/2--so went for 1/3.  Four star after that.  Loved using my cast iron skillet to make this to go with our cold winter's day five bean soup which had simmered all day.

I added 1/4 cup of sugar and 1/2 a can of creamed corn to the batter, towards the end I put butter and honey over the top for a nice golden brown color and sweet pop.

For a sweeter amazing cornbread, add a tbsp of vanilla extract and brush the crust with melted butter upon removal from the oven. Insanely good!!!!

I tried both soaking the corn meal and not soaking. We preferred not soaking.  I also added a touch of sugar. This is an awesome corn bread recipe.

I made this a couple times by the recipe and it was decent. I pre-mixed all the dry ingredients one night to make at a friends house and added all the wet at one time and let it sit for 10 minutes before cooking. I also threw in a cup of sugar to sweeten the bread. Turned out amazing. Made it for my dad (a southerner who loves his corn bread) a few days later. He ate it without butter and said its the best cornbread he's had in ages. This is a good base recipe to work with. I tried to give it four stars but Allrecipes would only let me choose three or five. Weird.

Five stars for simplicity, everything came out great. I did make some substitutions: grits for cornmeal and buttermilk for milk, as I had both of those and wanted to use them. The grits aren't great at first but they get tender over time, otherwise all was good... though I think I would prefer it sweetened up. I'm a bad person.

I followed the recipe for the most part - I omitted the kosher salt - and, it was bland. Nevertheless, I doubled the recipe and made enough for 2 8inch and 12inch skillets of cornbread. My guest loved it.

Delicious ??Made it last night.

 I added 1/4 to 1/3 of a cup of light brown sugar ( I prefer brown to white sugar). And prefer sweetcorn bread. 

This will be my go to recipe should another one come along (I'm doubtful thou).

Its that good. 

I also cooked it for 30 minutes at 400' the center slightly collapsed making it another wonderful part of this side dish!!!

I mixed 1 tsp. of honey and 3/4 stick unsalted butter and whipped it to a fluffy consistency.

Making another batch this morning last nights didn't last the night

I have made this recipe several times to go with chili. I had to quit using the box mixes ( got to where I could not keep it from crumbling) this one has never done that.So so good!! Always turns out right. I will continue to use this recipe.

My first time making skillet cornbread from scratch. This was a quick and easy recipe to follow. There were no modifications made to the recipe however I did spread a stick of butter across the top with five minutes remaining to cook to give the cornbread a golden brown top. I also cut the cornbread into four large triangles and immediately removed it from the skillet. Someone else had recommended removing it right away to keep the corn bread from crumbling and drying out. I made this corn bread to eat with red beans and rice, so the recipe was perfect for that however if I were to make again For another dish I probably will add sugar to sweeten it a bit.

I liked this cornbread, but it was a little bit drier than I like. Loved cooking it in the cast iron skillet. The hot pan made a nice crispy bottom crust. I would make it again with perhaps a bit more liquid.

I like this recipe. I will now use it whenever I make cast iron skillet cornbread. I see some reviewers suggested adding sugar, but it really depends how you want your cornbread to taste. I do not like sugar in my cornbread.  I loved the natural flavor as it is. I used 2% milk and my skillet was in the oven from preheat right up to swishing the oil and adding the batter. It turned out well. Good recipe.

I made a few alterations to the recipe: I added 1 tablespoon of buttermilk powder, and 3 tablespoons of sugar. I greased the pan with butter instead of oil, and brushed the top of the baked bread with honey butter.

I would make this again, but I would add more sugar (controversial, I know) and more salt. The top browned more than I was expecting, possibly due to sugar content, the positioning in my oven, or the additional butter.  I'm not bothered by that, however. I just found it bland. 

Even if you prefer your cornbread to be savory rather than sweet, I would add about twice as much kosher salt, possibly more.

I also added 2 T of sugar (I know, I'm a northerner), which I think was a good decision. I was very happy with it for being my first ever skillet cornbread. Perfectly cooked, but I think it could use more flavor. More salt? More cornmeal? I'm not sure.

So good and it was a breeze to make. I followed a few of the comment edits like placing the oil in the pan while it was preheating for a crisp bottom and adding a little bit of honey. Only reason I gave this four stars is because it is not sweet like the recipe says. I’ll definitely make this again and be sure to add a bit more honey because I like my cornbread on the sweeter side. Otherwise, great recipe!

Simple to make plain cornbread.  Use bacon grease instead of oil.  I used cornmeal mix and omitted the baking powder.

Almost as good as our standard family recipe. I used buttermilk instead of whole and it was light and delicious!!  Like my other Southern reviewer, I added about 1 1/2 Tbsp sugar to make it less “corny”. Will def make this again!

I started my search for a cornbread recipe that didn't need buttermilk since I didn't have any, and don't love the substitution of milk + lemon juice. I agree with many reviewers who state that A) southern cornbread should not be sweet but also B) cornbread with zero sugar in it can be bland. So I followed the advice on another review and added 2 Tablespoons of sugar. I also cooked it in bacon grease because I had some from another recipe I had just made. This went together like a dream and baked up beautifully. Thanks for a great recipe!

From the ‘Dirty’ South!  I don’t always cook with, but I Definitely used bacon drippings instead of vegetable oil!  I also added 1/3 cup whole kernel corn to add a ‘pop’ to the texture.

This was an okay corn bread. I like the idea of using the cast iron skillet. As written the cornbread is bland and not very  sweet. I would definitely suggest adding 2 tablespoons of sugar or honey and instead of using oil in the cast iron I like to use butter. The butter creates a crispy on the edges of the corn bread.

Like most reviewers, I add sugar.  I do more than a 1/3 cup, less than a 1/2 cup.  It's very good.  Not crumbly at all like many corn breads.  I don't have a skillet so I cook in a pyrex pie dish.

This is a great recipe, I reduce the baking powder to 2 tsp. and add 1 1/4 C. Vanilla pudding (instant is fine), this makes it more dense and cake like but does not make it sweeter. Cooking time increases by about 15 minutes.

It was ok. Edible. I added a tablespoon of sugar and still found it really bland. It worked for the night to compliment my Chili but will look for a more flavorful recipe next time. 

What is nice about it, and why I made this version is that it has a very simple and common list of ingredients so I didn't need to run to the store. So from that perspective it's nice if you need it last minute. 

Next time though I will plan ahead and get a richer version made. 

Thanks.

I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time, I added 2Tbs sugar for a touch of sweetness.  The second time, I made it as is without sugar.  I loved it both ways.  The cornbread is tender, and I really like having a recipe on hand that uses regular milk for when I am out of buttermilk.  I use a tablespoon of bacon grease in the cast iron skillet and heat that in the oven while I am prepping the batter.

I don't like writing critical reviews -- however I was not a huge fan of this recipe. Yes, I made one adaptation but that was only to add 4 tsp of sugar to the batter because I prefer sweeter cornbread. Other than that, I felt the cornbread came out a bit crumbly and "sticky." Overall, it was okay and I can't complain too much but it wasn't the best cornbread I've ever had.

I chose this after searching for a low-sugar recipe, because my usual recipe is super-sweet and I wanted to add green onion and shredded cheddar. It was surprisingly moist! My kids found this to be bland and dry but they are used to what I find to be an overly sweet recipe. I did add two tablespoons of sugar and my daughter thought the batter tasted "too floury," so I added two more tablespoons. I only added cheese and onion to half, and my son preferred the plain half. I also added a bit of cider vinegar to the milk out of habit (I never have buttermilk on hand). Don't be afraid to add the full 4 teaspoons of baking powder. I couldn't taste it (or maybe the vinegar neutralized any baking soda taste).

Didn't have a cast iron skillet (sigh), but I preheated a heavy stainless skillet in the oven and got a pretty good crust anyway. I used white cornmeal since it was on hand. I'd never seen the soaking technique for the cornmeal (and I'm a Southerner from a huge family of great cooks). I think this made the result exceedingly moist and tender. This is one of the richest-tasting cornbreads to ever cross my palate. Looking forward to  tinkering with additional ingredients using this as a base. Might increase oven temp to 450 next time for a little darker side crust and top browning.  This is my new go-to for cornbread.

I used as a base recipe for my own at home were I at honey to add sweetness to it and it crumbles like my moms cornbread and to add to it I use a iron skillet from the civil war and yes I have had it tested to make sure it was safe and it is. Make sure your cast iron is always seasoned well and oiled cleaned never use soap you will ruin it. If any one wants to know my version let me know

Excellent in taste and texture; adequately moist. I added jalapenos just because my husband and I like the zing.

Very good. The only change I made was to use buttermilk.

Excellent corn bread. However, it is NOT sweet.

As written, the recipe is bland and slightly bitter.  Adding sugar would probably help.

This is a good base recipe for cornbread. I made it to put into cornbread stuffing so I really didn't care if it was bland. If I were making it as a stand alone dish I would add around 1/4th c. brown sugar and 1/2 c. frozen corn. You can also always add things like cheese and peppers or even cooked breakfast sausage. Again, this is a good base recipe, meaning that it is a great start and then add your creativity.

I followed the recipe with a couple of additions. I like a sweeter cornbread, so I added 2 teaspoons of sugar to the batter. I also like corn kernels in my cornbread so I cut the corn off the cobs of  two ears of corn and added to the mixture. Delicious!!!

I added 2 tbl sugar, didn't soak corn meal, turned out great! Will use again. Used polenta corn meal, what I had.

Turned out very light and fluffy - I liked it very much, but I can see how some people might like a little sugar or honey added.

I followed the recipe - it came out quite crumbly and the mixture was fairly dry (it wouldn't 'pour' like the recipe suggests). But it still tasted good and I will definitely make it again (maybe with a little more milk).
