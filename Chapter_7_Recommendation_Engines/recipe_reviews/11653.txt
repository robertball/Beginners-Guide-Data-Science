This is an extremely simple recipe to make, and it tastes great!  In my opinion it has more of a subtle peanut butter taste with the chocolate, but it was still gone with in 4 hours of me making it.  Great for beginner bakers!

I've never made fudge before, so I wanted an easy recipe, that would also be good.  Boy, this was it!  It was as easy as heating a can of soup!  I brought some to work, and my co-workers love it too!  I made it using 2 cups of chocolate chips, and one cup of peanut butter chips, as that's all I had.  I can't wait to try it using the 2 cups of peanut butter chips.  I wonder how it would taste with butterscotch chips?  And maybe with some nuts added!  I'll be making more soon!

Am I the only one confused?  The recipe calls for peanut butter CHIPS, yet a couple of the reviews talk about crunchy versus smooth peanut butter.

I made this fudge following the recipe exactly. It was not only easy but delicious. What I dont quite understand is that people rate a recipe after either not following directions or changing it up. Where in the recipe does it say Peanut butter?? It says PB chips. And then you say it doesnt set? If your not gonna follow the recipe exactly then dont rate it. This was easy and very good.

I made this fudge today for the holidays.  I had looked through several recipes on this site, and this was the only that contained all the ingredients I had on hand.

I only had about a cup and a half of chocolate chips, but other than that followed the recipe precisely.  It turned out excellent, and very peanut butter-y...but maybe more than other's because I had less chocolate.  I also used crunchy peanut butter, which I like better than smooth.  

Fantastic (and way, way to easy) recipe!

This tastes great but I had trouble with the consistency.  It never really hardened.

I am not a big fan of peanut butter but I thought this was good because of the light peanut butter taste.  My family hesitated in trying it because they thought that it was chocolate fudge because of the color. It is good and very easy to make, which makes it.......a keeper!

This is incredibly easy to make. No sugar thermometer needed. It makes a rich, soft fudge, which is the kind I happen to prefer. I meant to buy smooth peanut butter but only when opening the jar did I notice I'd got crunchy by mistake. No matter, the bits look attractive in the fudge.  I could only manage to eat two pieces of fudge it was so rich...just as well or my waistline wouldn't thank me!

I give it two because it can be made without peanut butter replaced with chocolate chips. She didn't say so. Also she also didn't say if her sister law gave her permission to share the recipe. Lisa makes it appear she wore down her sister in law then gave it out to everyone. I don't think that is nice if it happened that way. So I think Lisa needs to let us know that it was alright for her to share with the world. I wouldn't be to happy if I shared a recipe with a family member or friend and they passed it on without asking. Still thank you it is a great fudge that you can add chopped walnuts and change the peanut butter to chocolate or butterscotch chips. They do have different flavored chips that are like the chocolate chips.

This came together in less than 3 minutes ( I'm allowing some time for the burner to reach the proper temp)  It's pretty, and tastes wonderful.  I've never made fudge that was so easy to make.  It's a keeper for me.

This was soooooooo yummy and easy to make. I ended up having to add a little bit of real peanut butter to the recipe though, because I only bought 1 bag of peanut butter chips (FYI that is not quite 2 cups). It still turned out delicious and it was gone super fast.

Super easy and yummy. My boys loved it. From the other reviews it sounds like some people have been misreading the recipe and using peanut butter instead of peanut butter chips. That might be why some have said it didn't set for them. I have made it twice, so far, and it has set up both times for me. The first time I made it with all dark chocolate chips and it was good. The second time I used pb chips and dark choc. chips. For more peanut butter flavor I threw in a large scoop of crunchy peanut butter (no it's not in the recipe) and about a tsp. of vanilla. My sons said it reminded them of no bake cookies, without the oatmeal. Yum!! Will make it again and again and will continue to try some other variations. Thanks!

Not sure what I did wrong, but I followed the recipe exactly & couldn't wait to taste it once it hardened...but I was soo disappointed! It had no flavor/taste at all - reminded me of wax! I hated to throw it away, given all the ingredients, but I certainly couldn't gift this.  Back to the drawing board...:-(
