Made this for a party. Everyone thought the dip was fantastic and asked for the recipe. Will definitely be making this again.

I made this dip thinking  it'd taste like a spinach artichoke dip from a restaurant. I was dead wrong.  The dip was too thin, and there is too much mayo. That's almost all I could taste. Definitely don't make this if you're expecting a recipe from a restaurant.

When I read the review about this being runny, i was extra careful to get all of the water out of my spinach before adding it to the recipe.  That did the trick...this was really good and perfect consistency.

As is I only give this a 3 because I don't prefer the mayonnaise taste.  I modified the 2nd time we made it and used a box of cream cheese and about 3/4 cup heavy cream instead of the Alfredo Sauce.

I made this great recipe this past weekend - it was absolutely fantastic.  Doubled the recipe because I didn't have use for a 1/2 full jar of alfredo sauce.  I added 1T. of garlic powder and 2T. Louisiana hot sauce.  It was awesome.  Thinking about cooking up a chicken breast and pouring some of the leftover dip on top.  Very versatile recipe.

We're trying to save money and cut back on eating out so I've been trying my hand at matching some of our favorite menu items. I was leary of this at first because of the ingredients. My family thought it was great! (I did too) and scarfed it down in just a couple days. I was worried I'd end up throwing it away. My 11 year old son said he likes this even better than the restaurant's we usually get it from and has requested it. I'm just glad to finally find a least one way to get him to eat a couple veggies. :)

This was ok. I love spinach artichoke dip, but honestly with this one I didn't really dig the alfredo sauce.

If this dip is too thin for you, you have not properly drained your spinach.  Make sure to actually squeeze out the liquid.  I have made this dip several times and have adapted it to my preferences and it is pretty close to what I like at a restraunt.  Here it is:  Reduce the amount of spinach by about 3 or 4 oz.  Add 1 TBS minced garlic.  Increase cheese by 1/2 cup.  Sprinkle additional cheese and grated parmesan on top before baking.  If you like a kick and little color, sprinkle a bit of cayenne on top as well.  
This recipe is sooo much better than the cream cheese based ones out there.

Excellent! I doubled the batch before a party and it was gone in no time. So many people asked for the recipe. I added about 6 chopped scallions and a couple tablespoons of minced jarred garlic. I'm sure it'd be awesome without too.

I have been making this at least once a year (for my Oscar's party) for the better part of a decade. Everyone raves and it is so easy. I throw in some extra seasoning and it is irresistible!
