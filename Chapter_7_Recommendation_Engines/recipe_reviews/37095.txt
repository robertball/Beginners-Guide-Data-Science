I had a parfait like this at a hotel once and have made them at home ever since.  Try a mix of blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries on the bottom, a cup of plain lowfat yogurt, a handful of golden raisins, and top with granola.  A great way to start the day!

I used Dee's Dark Chocolate Granola in this recipe and sliced bananas tossed with last summer's frozen blackberries. My kids thought this was the best, like getting dessert for breakfast. Happy kids=happy Mom.

My grandson loved thsi for breakfast! I did parfait this & I just had plain yogurt so I added a  tsp of vanilla to it.  Almond Maple Granola (from this site) worked perfectly in this recipe. I used thawed, frozen raspberries (I too sprinkled them w/ a little sugar) & I sprinkled just a little raw sugar on top to add some sparkle. Thansk Natalie!

Honey bunches of oats crushed make good granola topping for this awesome snack.  That's what we already had on hand.

Even though this was an over all good dish, I really have a problem with the ingredient amounts. 2 cups of yogurt was way too much for one serving and having only 8 blackberries was not enough. I also used berry flavored granola so that added a bit more depth of flavor that I don't think it would have other wise.

I make something like this all the time- only I used 1.5 cups of fresh blueberries, 6 oz. of lowfat vanilla yogurt, and only 1/2 cup of granola.  I'll also sometimes sprinkle ground flax seeds on the granola.

I've made this before using different fruits (my favorite is sliced strawberries) and fat-free vanilla yogurt.  I suggest crumbling a granola bar, which can be low fat and any flavor (I use chocolate chip low fat granola bars), for the granola layer.  This will help keep your ice cream cravings under control!!

I used plain greek strained yogurt and homemade almond maple granola from this site.  Since the yogurt was unsweetened I thought it might need a bit of honey, but it was fine as it was.  Delicious!

So good Natalie! To cut down on calories, I used fat free/sugar free yogurt and only one cup instead of the two.  Any fruit you choose to build your parfait will taste great. This makes a terrific breakfast or dessert!

Who thought something so simple could taste this good...  The perfect summer breakfast.  I used Honey bunches of oats, just bunches and small chunks of apple.  The variations are endless with this recipe.  Thank you for sharing...

This is what I use and EVERYONE in the family eats it! 
Yoplait creamy vanilla yogurt 
BareNaked fruit and nut granola
Local honey
Sugar
Variety of berries

Put the yogurt first, then berries, then granola, drizzle just a bit of honey (good for allergies!) and sprinkle just a bit of sugar. Enjoy. Simple as that!

Great, I used many different berries (strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, blueberries). I also used Kashi granola. I served in a margarita glass and garnished with a sprig of mint. The ladies at the brunch thought they were in a top notch restaurant.

I've made this for years. Except mine is vegan (dairy free). I use homemade granola and also add frozen blueberries or frozen bananas. It's always a go-to for breakfast or when I get a sweet tooth. Love it! Oh almost forgot, add some ground flaxseed, wheat germ or wheat bran for added nutrition.

I did a blend of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.  I macerated them first in 2 Tbsp sugar, before assembling the parfaits.  I used the Bear Naked brand of granola.
These were simple to fix and yummy!

Yum, I loved this - Had microwave granola, used an apple & mandarin oranges. Plain yogurt with vanilla & a little honey. It was so good - I had 2.

My kids love love love yogurt. And feeding something of this nature...is the way to go for a morning treat for them. Using a low-fat yogurt as close as I can get and an all natural granola that has a variety of nuts in it with berries is splended. That you. This is always something I enjoy as well.

A quick and easy breakfast. I used strawberries in place of the blackberries, but frankly, you could use any fruit. Since I didn't have any granola, I made Stovetop Granola from this site.

This was simple and good.  I used the 'Honey Lime Granola' recipe from this site which added amazing flavor. I found the 2 cups of yogurt and one cup of granola to be too much for one serving, but divided into two servings, with increased fruit, it was perfect. Nice light snack or breakfast. I used strawberries, banana and mango.

Great quick dessert! My blackberries were a bit tart so this was a good way to sweeten them up without a bunch of sugar. All I had was strawberry yogurt so that is what I used. The hungry teen devoured this in a couple of bites and wanted more, too bad I was out of berries.

I used this recipe for a cooking activity with middle school kids.  We used strawberries for the fruit instead and still included the granola with vanilla yogurt.  The kids loved it!  Several kids had three servings!  They had fun making their own berry yogurt parfaits.

I used blackberries, blueberries, vanilla low fat yogurt and instead of granola I added Kashi Crunch Cereal.

This is a great breakfast or anytime snack.  I use a cup of yogurt, only 1/4 cof homemade granola and any kind of fresh berries I have on hand.  If I use plain yogurt I sometimes drizzle honey on top.  Yummy and healthy....thanks!!

This has become one of my favorite breakfast treats.  I use whatever fruit I have on hand and use different flavors of granola.  It's quick and easy...great for those rushed mornings.  Thanks Natalie.

This is a great recipe for a healthy snack or small meal. I like to put in cantelope and honey dew melon along with the basic ingredients. YUM!

I make these all the time for packed lunches. The serving size is a little large in this recipe. I fit everything in a 1 cup container with ease. Any fruit, blueberries, strawberries, peaches, etc can be used. I make my own granola. Tends to be healthier, than store bought, and  less sweet. I dont always have vanilla yogurt. When not, nonfat plain Greek yogurt works great drizzled with a little honey.

I made this for the kids after school snack. Yogurt parfaits are always a hit around here. I used strawberries, blueberries and blackberries. Delicious!

Good, but too much and too high in fat/calories!  I prefer adding to the bottom of a small cup 3-4 blackberries, one frozen strawberry, a couple frozen rasperries (I usually have them in the freezer and this is a good way to use them).  Then add 1 serving of vanilla yogurt (about 3/4 cup - those little prepackaged containers of 100 cal), a couple of pieces of chopped walnuts (love the crunch but only a few as walnuts are high in fat) and then a couple tablespoons of homemade granola.  So yummy, low cal/fat and feels like I'm cheating...great for dessert but equally yummy for breakfast.  Just make a whole bunch the night before and they're ready for breakfast the next morning to just grab & go!

Nice, healthy snack, and good too. I used some honey granola cereal I had along with blueberries and sliced strawberries. Just about any kind of fruit would probably do well in this.

Simple to prepare. Used bluberries instead of blackberries and reduced the amounts of everything. You could use any kind of fruit.
