I am giving this a five due to the creativity, the uniqueness of it, the overall easy preperation, and the wonderful flavor combination that made it have its own exotic taste. I did change of a few things yes but with the exception of the 4 tsps. of onion salt, I think the recipe would be very tasty as written. I boiled some peeled diced potatoes in chicken stock as I browned about a half of pound of ground beef and then later added both to the soup ( I like a more hearty soup). I used more pickles and juice and even left some of my pickles in bigger hunks because I really wanted to taste the pickles. VERY good and very unique and even though this is not a soup I would want on a weekly basis, I will be making it over and over throughout the years. Oh, also thought I'd mention that for me 2 tablespoons of butter was not enough to whisk a 1/2 cup of flour but that might have just been me. Pretty simple fix to just keep adding butter until you get your flour smooth but thought I'd mention it in case anyone had any troubles there. Thank you for the most unusual soup this soup loving gal has ever tried!*****update*****I have made this soup 3 times now and it turns out a little different each time but always good. I used pickles with tobasco sauce this go around and that added a nice kick. I do think potatoes are a must and I left out the ground beef this time but will be adding it back next go around. This one has become a favorite in my house. Thanks again!

This soup was delicious. My only change was to add a small onion to the butter in the beginning, because I don't like onion salt. Surprisingly the pickles, juice, milk and curry powder worked.
UPDATE: I've made this one several times in the past few months.  Everybody, including those who don't like pickles says this is the best soup they're ever had. At first I started adding onions to the beginning of the soup.  I now use a bunch of leeks, sliced thinly and washed instead of the onions at the beginning of making the soup.  The leeks add to the creaminess, and they're an amazing mild compliment to the strong pickled dills.

Yes, I did submit this, but I thought I'd review it as well.  It's one of my favorites!  It doesn't have a strong pickle flavor, but rather all the spices combine to give it a very unique taste.  I found a similar recipe a long time ago and have modified it by my tastes to what you see posted here.  I love it.  I hope you enjoy it too!

I was surprised by this soup.  I expected it to taste a lot like pickles, but the other seasonings really melded well.  I might try to decrease the salt next time, though.

I made this for company but wouldn't tell anyone the name of this soup until they tasted it.  Everyone LOVED this soup, even my mom who doesn't like dill pickles.  It was a big hit & I will be making it again!

This is a real sleeper. Do not let the name fool you. Simple and easy to make. Spicy not for the faint of heart.If the name had a fancy name it would be a money maker in top restaurants.

Great recipe! I did take the advice of 1 comment though, sauteed some leeks in the butter at the beginning and used 2 tsp salt instead of 4 tsp onion salt. (cutting back on sodium in my diet). Also only had 5% cream in the house and it was great. My only change I might make, (my wife disagrees but she did not make the soup...LOL) i might increase either the pickles or the dill weed, found curry as the prominent flavor, although I like curry so I would not decrease it.
Thanks for a great soup!

Awesome combination of flavors!  I took the suggestions of adding real onions to the butter and sauteeing before creating the roux, added diced, peeled potatoes to the broth before the pickles, and used more pickles than called for because I love pickles.  I have made this recipe dozens of times since I first tried it and it never fails to please.  It is so quick and easy too!

This soup is so smooth and buttery.  I followed the recipe exactly as written and would not change a thing.  Serving with ham and grilled cheese for a quick dinner bc my oldest son has a football game. Satisfying enough to fill but not too much to weigh him down.  Will def use a lot this fall and winter.

a very light soup. I used organic pickles, which have a slightly different taste... I always interrogate hubby about any new recipe I make, and he said he "wouldn't change a thing" (unusual for him). I do agree, it would be really good with rice... mmmm... doesn't really taste of pickles.. Naan would be terrific with this... well, the addition of Naan makes everything better... thanks for a keeper!

This was just ok for me.  I love love love dill and dill pickles so I was really looking forward to this.  Something just didn't quite work for me; I think it was the texture.  I liked the taste, but the texture was just a bit off for me.  It's def worth trying; it just wasn't my favorite.  Thanks for a nice change of pace soup!

This was really good pickle soup, although the flavor was more curryish than pickly. It didn't taste like I expected, but I'm still going to give it five stars because it was stellar. A very very good, creamy, buttery, sort of exotic tasting soup that was freaking fabulous with grilled cheese sandwiches. This might be an even better dipper than the classic tomato soup. My husband and I ate the whole batch in one day. I wish I had some right now. I used fresh and dry dill, and increased the pickle juice just by a couple of tablespoons. I feel like I left the pickle chunks too big so I will be sure to chop them finer next time. Thank you for the recipe!

It was a bit salty.  We didnt have onion salt so I used regular salt, but I reduced the salt to 3 tsp instead of the 4 it calls for.  Still, I think it was a bit too salty.

Love this soup. Preferably, a few boiled potatoes (cubed) gives some substance and makes tastier. An unexpected and unique flavor combination. This is a true gourmet recipe.

Really good.  I followed other reviewers suggestions by sauteeing finely chopped onion in the butter, halved the salt, and added chopped potatoes with the broth.  Yummy... and different!

This soup is great - I like how the curry adds a little kick - only difference is I used 1/2 and 1/2 instead of milk.

Making it again this weekend for a football party.

Love this! Like everyone else, I was skeptical-- definitely give this a try! A few small changes made this a hit in my house: sautéed 1/2 chopped vidalia onion and the garlic in the butter. Raw garlic is not my thing. I needed about 5T of butter to be able to whisk the flour in, but I was also using a stockpot. Skipped the onion salt, and added about a 1t of kosher salt instead, a few dashes of cayenne, and a few grinds of black pepper. I also chopped up 2 medium red-skinned potatoes: added one with the spices & pickles, and simmered. Then used my stick blender to puree before adding the milk (I actually used 1/2 and 1/2 as that's all we had). Added the other chopped potato pieces and simmered until tender before stirring in the milk. The result was a creamy texture with perfectly balanced flavors. Will be making this again very soon!

I have make this soup several times over the years and it is always for time and time again. I have never changed anything, but after reading the reviews the hamburger and leeks would make for a nice addition once and awhile. And a note to SOUP LOVING NICOLE, you want the butter/flour to be crumbly so it can brown, not liquidy. I start all my gravies that way too. Anyway, thanks for an outstanding soup that is quick to make.

Loved this recipe!  I added onions to the butter at the beginning and also added baby potatoes (with skin on) and shredded carrots after the broth was added.  I have had dill pickles soup in restaurants and these had potatoes and carrots in them.  Also omitted the onion salt as I used real onions.  In place of all of the milk, I used 1/2 cup of half and half and 1 and 1/2 cups milk and added it as it was still cooking so that it was piping hot.  Plus added tons of extra dill.  Next time I am going to omit the 2 tbsp. of sugar...I think I would like more zip.... Delicious!

I needed a recipe to take care of all the extra dill pickles from Christmas and this soup fit the bill.  It was surprisingly delicious & didn't taste at all like a dill pickle!

The flour/butter ratio for the roux is very off, as one reviewer mentioned. I trusted the recipe, even though I thought it was off and ended up having to fish chunks of flour out. I thickened it with a cornstarch slurry, so it turned out fine, but just make sure you have enough butter to make your flour smooth before adding the broth. The soup is very unique. I like it but would add more pickles and less curry for my own preferences. I don't think it is spicy unless you are sensitive to spicy foods, and though it is good I probably would not recommend for people you don't know, serve it to people when you know their tastes. If they are picky or don't have an adventurous palate they may not like it. Definitely probably not one for kids. If you're not sure, make a small batch for yourself, which is what I did. It's easy and good and if you like pickles/curry you will like it. Also, it is good both before and after adding the milk, so if you like a brothy soup you could probably omit the milk altogether (although that would reduce the portions!).

Followed the recipe exactly as written.  I thought it was an interesting combination of spices but was thinking 4 teaspoons of onion salt sounded like a lot.  All I could taste was salt.

This soup blew my mind. I served it to my roommates and they agree-- it's incredible. I didn't use dill weed or bay leaves, but it tasted fantastic all the same.

Delicious and very warming on a cold spring day that feels like winter! I made half a recipe but kept the amounts of pickles and juice as for a whole recipe. I liked the pickle flavor this way, and I think it would have been a little bland if I lowered those amounts, too. Per other reviewers suggestions, I added three small chopped, cooked potatoes at the end, and this was a very good call. I also added onion powder and salt. Had some half-n-half that needed to be used so I added that until I got the color and flavor I liked, leaving out about 1/4 cup. Thanks Heather K. for the different and tasty soup recipe!

Well that was interesting and fun. I told my 17 year old granddaughter that I had a new soup for her to try. She loves my homemade soups I told her I made dill pickle soup and said "yuk". She tried it though and then had another bowl. LOL

To me, this had a very strong dill flavor which I particularly enjoy a lot. This is my first Dill soup that I have ever tried and have to say that I did enjoy it. I think I will mess around with the recipe and try out different flavor combinations. Thanks for the recipe!

I added carrots and potatoes, and reduced the onion salt to about 2.75 teaspoons. This was absolutely delicious and I will certainly make it again. Very well seasoned with the perfect amount of pickle flavor. Thanks for sharing!

Wow and wow and wow!  We love this soup!
We had this soup st an Octoberfest and thought we want to make this. I am going to say that this recipe was wayyyyy better than the one we had from a German deli.  We used our own homemade pickles and the juice feom them.  We crave this soup. Making it soon now that our pickles are ready.  
Love this!!!!

This soup is simply Amazing! I added cooked diced potatoes and I also Cut up bacon and fried it and set those aside. I added all the ingredients and simmer them together before making the flour mixture. I did add extra pickle juice and extra curry. Also after it was all done I added a little sickening to make it a little creamier. By far one of the best recipes I’ve tried! The seasonings or perfect! Thanks so much for sharing this recipe! ????

Giving this a five more the options you can choose to add.  My husband works with a polish gentleman who told him in Poland they add potato’s.  We added the potato's then the next time we added carrots along with the potato’s and 1/4 cup of half and half.  Yummy!

Great dill pickle soup! I followed the recipe but made a few changes..... and next time would leave out the curry powder as it tasted more curry than dill. Also I used 35% cream instead of milk.  Made it thicker and was better ! I'll make next time with no curry powder and add more pickle juice and dill.

Delicious! Mine turned out restaurant quality. I didn't have onion salt so I used onion powder and I'm glad I did. I think it would have been far too salty. I added potatoes too because I had some leftover from dinner the night before. Will certainly make again.

It was okay.  I have had better.  i don't think you need the sugar and less of the pickle juice.  Over all, not as good as I have had in the past.

I made this because of the many good reviews.  It tasted great!  And my husband thought so too.  I too added onion (and deleted the onion salt)as well as some celery and red pepper.  I mistakenly chopped up a cup of pickles so I added twice the amount.  It was a wonderful vegetable soup - and one that I plan on making again.

Only 4 stars cause I did not make it as written. We just moved and so I was working with what boxes were around; but I used this as a template and it turned out awesome. We didn't have chicken stock, just a can of cream of chicken. So I mixed that with 5 cups of water, added salt and went with that as my base. I didn't have curry or Worcestershire , or anything onion. I used a small amount of cream instead of milk. Total hit with family. We will make this again, as written. I definitely like the idea of using leeks for the onion flavor as well as texture. I was skeptical, but not now.

Surprisingly satisfying, Definitely one of my new comfort foods on a chilly night, and pretty good served chilled as well for those hot summer nights.

This soup was delicious. The pickles remain crunchy even after they've cooked a while and act more like a garnish than an ingredient. I didn't have onion salt so I used half onion powder and half table salt. It was almost too salty, so watch your sodium if you make this substitution. Next time I will add more curry. Some Thai yellow curry paste in it would be really good. Maybe coconut milk instead of regular milk.

I thought it was very good. Did not make any changes, even though I am not crazy about curry, but it was not overpowering.  I would make it again.

Delicious, however, I did add onion and a precooked potatoes.  I didn't  have any curryy, so I don't know what I was missing.  I will definitely make it again!

Loved it.  I added shredded sweet potato for more ompf and used a shallot in place of the garlic and onion powder.  What an easy and elegant soup.

I'd never heard of this dish and tried it because just the idea struck me as so odd. The first time I made it, I followed the recipe exactly except for substituting diced onion for the onion powder. That was a 5-star recipe on its own, but the second time (only 2 days later), I added cubed potatoes and  fried about 6 slices of bacon to crumble on top. We like a thicker gravy with our soup, so I used cornstarch at the end. I think it would be great with green onions sprinkled on top, too. For a side dish, I'll leave the potatoes and bacon out (we had it  with grilled cheese sandwiches, and they were perfect together), but with those 2 ingredients, it makes a meal in itself. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This is AMAZING. Only changes I made were the sautéed leeks as someone mentioned, used regular salt instead of onion salt and only used 2 tsp, and doubled the dill weed. I think I’ll try adding some cubed potatoes and ground lamb next time. Which will probably be tomorrow because I may eat this whole batch! :)

It was wonderful!  My husband would have preferred to have pickles grated than chopped. Previous comments mentioned the curry made the the broth great and they were right!  I followed the recipe as written and was happy with the results.

SO GOOD. I didn't have that much curry powder, so I threw in some turmeric. Wonderful. I think when I make it again, I will add twice as much liquid from the dill pickle jar. And when I served it, I sprinkled some cayenne pepper, which took the soup over the top!!!!

I'm not sure how this received such high reviews as I followed the directions exactly as written and it had a very weak pickle flavor. I added an additional 1/2 cup pickles and 2 TB pickle juice with flour to thicken and simmered an additional 20 minutes. It still had little pickle flavor and was disappointing. I wouldn't make this one again without decreasing the broth by about 2 cups and doubling the pickles and pickle juice the recipe calls for.

After shoveling the driveway on this cold winter morning I decided to make some soup. I have always been interested in dill pickle soup so searched and found this recipe.  I had the ingredients so I was good to go!
As someone else suggested, I sauteed onions with the butter before making the roux.  I eyeballed the measurements for the roux as I am used to making my roux without measuring and it was perfect for the soup if I do say so myself! I also chopped up a carrot and sauteed this along with the onion.  I omitted the onion salt - never use onion salt or garlic salt -- and did not add any additional salt as the pickles and pickle juice are salt enough. I also used reduced sodium chicken broth.  I added more pickles than required and and a little more pickle juice. I halved the recipe as I did not want too big a pot of soup.  I used red curry paste as that is what I had on hand and I much prefer curry paste to curry powder.  The flavours melded nicely together and I am now enjoying a fresh bowl of hot, steaming soup.  Next time, I will cut down on the pickles a bit and add a potato, or sweet potato.

Delicious!! A little salty as is. So next time I'd try to adjust the amount of sodium in it. Maybe used reduced sodium broth for example.

This was ok. Not to much flavor and sort of bland. I love dill pickles. Love them. Eat them on everything and this was just not a tasty soup. I added some pepper to it and a little bit of cheese to try to kick up the flavor and it was still just a bland soup. Thanks for the recipe and I guess just not a soup for me.

I was so looking forward to making this, but so disappointed with the outcome. Compared to the yummy dill pickle soup made by Polish grandmas at family cafes in the Polish enclave of Hamtramk, Mich., this was thin and underspiced. I prepared it as written. It was meh, so to try to replicate the version I love, I made a separate roux to thicken it, added a large, boiled and diced potato, sweated a diced onion and tripled the dill. I did, however, like the curry. That was a nice touch that I don't think was in dill pickle soup that I have had before.

Was looking for a recipe I'd made in the past. This wasn't it, so I'll keep looking. I think the sugar stood out too much for me, If I make this recipe again, I'll scale the sugar way back

I added a can of diced new potatoes and substituted the onion salt for onion powder after reading other reviews. I also used homemade dill pickles out of our garden and put 1 cup of milk and 1 cup of half/half since I had it on hand and it needed to be used up. My family loved it!!! I think next time I make it, I will add diced carrots & possibly some leeks too, just to make it heartier.

I have never heard of this soup before, until I tried it in our local coffee shop.  Rushed home and found this recipe, not quite the same as the one I had ( there's was a bit thicker)  but this is  really good and easy.  The only thing I changed was I used 3 tbls butter instead of 2 .  Thanks for sharing this is a keeper.

Cannot believe how good this is! Husband and I absolutely loved it! Followed the advice of many: browned onions with ground turkey (because beef was $7 a pound!), boiled two diced potatoes in the chicken broth, and omitted the onion salt. Make this--you will be surprised!

Really good soup. We had it on St. Patrick's day for something green.  I went a little light on the curry powder because I wanted more of a pickle flavor, but followed recipe as directed otherwise.

Unusual and delicious!  It's not a soup that I would want regularly,however,  it's a great soup to mix up the routine and have occasionally. 

I used skim milk instead of whole and didn't use the curry.  I didn't have onion salt on hand so I used 2 tsp of Onion onion from Simply Delicious. Agree w the other reviewers that 4 tsp of salt would be too much.

I did as others suggested by doubling the kosher sour pickles and brine .I also added diced sautéed onions and reduced the sugar by half. I subbed sour  cream for the milk , and onion  powder for the salt. I served the soup in toasted bread bowls garnished with fresh dill. Super yummy on a cold day!

This soup to me was more of a novelty than something I would want to eat on a regular basis.  A bit of a surprise in making this was when I browned the flour in the butter and then added the chicken stock, I ended up with a lot of lumps that just wouldn't smooth out.  So, I had to pull out my immersion blender to whisk it smooth.  Overall, the taste was just ok.

Great recipe, even for someone who is not a big dill pickle fan.  I followed the recipe exactly except for the addition of two fairly large potatoes.  Was happy I had done this as we found t was plenty salty.  
Will definitely be making this again soon!

This is one fantastic soup!  I love dill pickles and had just made a new batch last week, so decided to try this unusual soup.  My husband (not a pickle lover) went back for seconds and asked me to make it again the next day.  Talk about a hit!!  The only thing I changed was to add a bit more butter as the two Tbs. to 1/4 cup flour was a bit dry.  Adding another Tbs. more butter made it more of a roux consistency.  Thank you Heather K, for this truly different recipe!

Added minced onion to the butter, did not use onion salt - per all the "too salty" reviews.  It oddly doesn't taste like pickles, mostly just curry.

I just made this recipe and it is a good basic recipe but like some of the others, I did not think the curry added much other than a heat to the background.  I used sodium free broth, so I did have to adjust the saltiness upward, but I always prefer to do that rather than have something too salty.  I will look for the marinated garlic from the bottle of a pickle jar for use in this recipe, because that would be a match made in heaven.  I had had a dill pickle soup in our Polish area of my city, so by comparison, the two had different "backgrounds" with the addition of the curry since I don't recall Polish recipes with curry very often.  If I put curry in again, it will be 1/2 because I do love and crave curry at times, but the recipe as it stands was too much for my tastes.  Potato is a great addition to this and I did up the pickle juice as well.
For the person with "clumping" trouble with the flour roux, Wondra makes a great flour to prevent that. It's for gravy but the same idea that it is non-clumping.

This is one of the strangest soups I've ever tasted. I doubt I will ever make this recipe again as I'm not exactly looking forward to the leftovers. Both the dill and curry powder are very strong.

I am not overly keen on pickles in general but my daughter and husband love them. So I decided to give this recipe a try and I have to admit that I love it! 
I was pleased with how quick and easy it is to make and that I had all the Ingredients already on hand.

I have used this site for years and this so far is my favorite recipe on the entire site.  YUM!  I like that soup is good served at any temperature.  I can't make it too often because I will eat the entire batch alone.  Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

We made this pretty closely to the directions, but finely minced  half a small onion and used about  1/2 tsp of salt instead of using the onion salt.  We added one potato diced to about  1/2".  I used some Claussen pickle and a small McClure spicy pickle.  It added just a little zip.  We will definitely make again and share with the rest of our family.

I had 3 cartons, (12cups) of chicken broth so I nearly doubled the recipe. It was brothy. Not sure if it was suppose to be thicker. I added extra flour to while it was boiling. I took a bit of the broth and mixed it with the flour before dumping it in so it wouldn't clump. Still was brothy. But I tried it and loved it! I will make it for my friends when we go up north in the Michigan tundra. Live the kick to it because of the curry.

I love dill pickles, so this was a "no-brainer" for me. However, even after doubling the pickles & juice, I wanted more of the dill flavor. I will make this again with 4x those 2 items, and maybe add a bit of sour cream to thicken it more.

Delicious with a few tweaks.  I added one medium potato, peeled and cubed and half a medium onion diced to the broth in place of onion salt.  I made it vegetarian and used vegetarian stock plus added salt to taste.  The margarine wasn't enough so I doubled it, still using 1/2 cup of flour.  I really love the dill pickle taste so I also doubled the pickles and juice.  Delicious!

I really enjoyed this soup but I don't think it's something you could have very often.  The flavor of this soup is very strong.  To give it a little more fullness I added a half cup of cooked rice to each bowl before pouring the soup on top.  It worked out great.  My sister actually made the suggestion that you could free it in smaller containers and use it to flavor rice in the future. Overall, a great recipe if your looking for something flavorful and different.

I wasn't overly crazy about this. It had an ok flavor, not very pickle-y. My husband and 7 year old son thought it was really good, I thought it was "ok."

I first had this soup at a Polish restaurant years ago, and this recipe is right up there with it.  So savory and easy to make, and the leftovers are even better.

Fantastic! This soup was wonderful with our mini burgers. I did add a little extra pickle and juice, because I looove dill pickles.

This was so good and creamy! I used soy milk, which I think made it a bit too sweet, so I would use regular milk next time. Thanks for the great recipe!
