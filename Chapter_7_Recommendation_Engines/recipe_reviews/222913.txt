The recipe said Curry but there was no curry paste or powder called for in the directions. So I added it. It tasted very good

Yum!  Even my picky husband liked this. I only had one can of chickpeas, so added some carrot chunks that I had lightly steamed. I also followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a teaspoon of red curry powder. Served with brown rice. Will definitely make this again.

I changed the recipe to what I had on hand.  I used soy milk, but added coconut, and used crushed tomatoes.  This was delicious!  I'll be making it again.  Hopefully next time, I'll be able to use diced tomatoes!

I found it interesting that it's called a curry dish, but had no curry in it, so I added two teaspoons to this recipe. I also found it a bit bland, so I tripled the amount of cayenne pepper. The result? A curry dish that tasted legit!

I loved this recipe.  It is my very favorite vegan meal since I started eating vegan 8 weeks ago.  I only had one can chickpeas, so I cubed some yellow squash and it was very good.  My husband suggested potatoes, too.  I did use 2 cups coconut milk and a heaping 1/3 c peanut butter and still would have liked it to be a little more saucy, but I will definitely make this many more times.  Even my pickiest eater liked it.

This was pretty good. I increased the ginger and cayenne a bit, and added another 1-2T of peanut butter because we're peanut butter fiends. I love any recipe where the rice is the longest step. Saving this for busy weeknights in the future.

Delicious and very quick! OK, I already had the rice made.  
I was a little heavy-handed with the peanut butter because we like it.  I added a scant teaspoon of curry and a quarter teaspoon of smoked chipotle.  Served over brown rice.

suggestion for planned-overs: Had 3/4 cup left over - put in a reheatable container, added 1/3 c of rice, 1/3 c of coconut milk, mixed well and put in fridge for tomorrow's lunch.  Made a really thick soup.

Really delicious.  I only use about half of the coconut milk (lite version) and half of the tomatoes and it comes out great. Sometimes I add slices of smoked tofu. Yum.

I added 4 potatoes, curry powder, ~1/3c PB, and a generous splash of 2% milk because it got too thick and I didn't have more coconut milk. It took longer than the recipe said because I wanted to soften the potatoes and beans. All 5 loved this one!

I made it as written, and it's really pretty good on it's own. But I felt like it could use a little something. So sauteed garlic and onions, a little molasses, some paprika, and some chili powder really added an "oomph" to it. Really enjoyed this a lot! Makes for a really quick and easy dinner too! Thanks for the recipe!

I substituted grated fresh ginger instead of powder. I also added chopped peanuts. I cooked garbanzos from dry beans instead of canned.

I've made this over and over, and it's a staple in my plant-based diet.  Folks need to understand that curry is the name of any dish with a blend of spices and a creamy sauce originating in the Indian subcontinent.  They don't even use what we call curry spice there, and the dish has nothing to do with the curry spice we use.  However, feel free to add it--I like it either way.

Great vegetarian meal. I think I would like it better if I used tomatoes & not mild salsa.

I definitely agree with the review suggesting to add curry powder. Other than that, the amounts of ingredients taste right -- although I just ballpark it. It was a hit with friends at my 1st annual vegan feast, and I'm making a batch right now for a potluck at work tomorrow. Super easy to make!

This recipe is AWESOME. It tastes so good. But be careful, it can be a little salty. We checked our garbanzo beans and our tomatoes and they had salt, so we'll probably cut the additional salt. We like Indian food, so we added a nice amount of curry, and like another reviewer, we once made it with yellow squash. Bravo! Even our pickiest eater (ME) loves it.

This is a great recipe. It's very easy and tastes great except that I'd like a bit more heat which is easy to remedy.  I made this for a work pot luck and it got raves. I followed the recipe except that I toasted the spices in a bit of grapeseed oil before adding them to the coconut sauce. I also added some curry and some garam masala as others had suggested.  Oh, and I used lite coconut milk. Next time I will increase the spices and also either add more cayenne pepper or a dried thai chili.  I might also try using extra chunky peanut butter to add a bit of crunch to the it.  I'll definitely make this again.

My husband and I are not big chickpea fans (except hummus) so we didn't hold out much hope for enjoying this recipe. But it was surprisingly good. I boiled the chickpeas for 15 minutes to help soften them up. I'm not sure this helped, but it turned out great!

We enjoyed this very much but like another reviewer, I don't know why it has a curry name - I added a little curry powder for 'kick'.  We aren't vegan so 2 cans of chick peas was too much for us - I substituted 3 doz medium shrimp for one can of the peas. Quick & easy. Will make again.
