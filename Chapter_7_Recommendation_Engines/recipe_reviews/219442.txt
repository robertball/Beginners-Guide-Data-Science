This is absolutely delicious. Hard to believe it is low fat. I followed recipe as is except added about 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon and tempered the egg. For anyone who doesn't know how to temper an egg (like me when read recommendation) u just take last 1/2 cup of milk heat to a boil then slowly add to your egg that you have previously beaten. Once two are combined add to rice mix and bam the best rice pudding

I loved this recipe. I changed it a bit. I used unsweetened almond milk instead of cow's milk, omitted the butter entirely, and only used 1/4 cup of sugar, which was more than enough. I also left out raisins because I don't like them, and like other reviewers, I tempered the egg first with the last 1/2 cup of milk. This recipe turned out great and everyone in the house loved it. Next time I will have to double the recipe!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I made it yesterday morning with left-over b rice.  I used 1% milk, was short of raisins so added dried cranberries to make the right amount and added a couple of shakes of cinnamon .. just like Mom used to make!  Very creamy and yummy!

Very surprised this turned out great as I usually have trouble with brown rice turning out crunchy.  I think maybe the key is instead of simmering the rice like I usually do that I followed this recipe and cooked on medium-low.  VERY good.  I added cinnamon.

Using up leftover cooked brown rice, so I had to remind myself how much cooked rice to substitute for uncooked. (Basically cooked is about 3x the volume of uncooked rice.)  Had enough leftovers to nearly doubled this dish ( just over 4 cups of cooked brown rice), and doubled every other ingredient except sugar.  I used 1/4 cup sugar and 1/4 cup granulated Splenda.  It was sweet enough for my family's tastes.  Also, I followed advice of other reviewers & tempered the egg & added 1 tsp of cinnamon (for my double batch).  Very satisfied with the the end result!

I love this recipe! It's a healthier version of one of my favorite foods. I double the recipe and I do double the amount of vanilla and add 1/2 Tbsp of Cinnamon and 1/2 tsp of Nutmeg. I also cut down the amount of suger to 1/2 cup (1/4 cup if making the recipe as stated) and found that it was sweet enough without being 'sugary'. I have found that once it's refridgerated that it tends to thicken quite considerably so I need to add a few tablespoons of milk before I reheat. But it's so wonderful I don't care! Also, try adding the seeds from 1/2 a vanilla pod instead of the spices above. Yummy!

I give this about 3.5 stars. It was honestly, just way too sweet for my taste. After making this, I believe I had made the original recipe for this rice pudding and thought exactly the same. I only had 1/2 cup of raisins, so I used that much. I still thought there were too many raisins. I was surprised the recipe did not say to temper the eggs. I decided to follow the recipe as written, and learned I was right about that. I ended up with a few egg white bits in the pudding. I also thought the pudding was slightly too thin, but thickened after it cooled. I added some cinnamon in my serving bowl and it did cut through the sweetness a tad. I guess, I will keep looking for a good but slightly healthy recipe that has the right balance of creaminess to sweetness.

This turned out great for me and I love that it's made using brown rice. I had currants on hand, so I used them instead of raisens. Although I think it would even be good on it's own without the fruit (if you happen to not have any and still want to make this). I also used slightly less sugar, only because I'm not big on sweet, and a dash of cinnamin and nutmeg on each serving. Delicious!

I made this today and LOVED IT.  I left out the butter, cut raisins back to 3 T, and also tempered the egg before adding it into the pot so as not to have scrambled egg bits.  Also, I used soy milk and cooked brown rice.  Per other comments, I cut back on the sugar too.  I added 2 Truvia packets instead of sugar, and found the pudding plenty sweet.  A dish a cinnamon, and all was fantastic!

Super easy recipe, I've attempted other rice pudding recipes twice and they were too watery. I'm so happy this came out great! Too bad I'm no longer with my ex, bc he's the reason why I attempted rice pudding in the first place! Now I don't have to share :)

Wow, this is the ultimate comfort food!  I had leftover brown rice from a family dinner and decided to use that to make this delicious pudding.  I followed the recipe but did half Splenda and half sugar plus a sprinkle of cinnamon.  It was so delicious and creamy.  Definitely will be making this again!

I followed the cooking instructions on my rice box.  Once rice was cooked, I added the first portion of  milk and the raisins on top of the rice.  
Followed the balance of the recipe except for omitting the butter. 
Very good recipe!

The flavour of this pudding was really wonderfully tasty. The rice was undercooked though, and continued to absorb the milk which resulted in not much creaminess to the pudding. To fix this, I added a few tablespoons of milk just on top, microwaved the individual puddings, and sprinkled cinnamon on top. I'll definitely make this pudding again, remembering to cook the rice 10-15 minutes longer.

I used maple syrup instead of sugar and boiled the rice and a cinnamon stick in extra water then drained it - only took 30 minutes to cook the rice, and it was infused with cinnamon. Very pleased to find this delicious recipe - I made it for breakfast, and next time I'll cut down on the sweetness. Love whole grains!

Oops. I made a pot late Thursday night and I ate it all. Had to make another pot on Sunday morning! Even though it is a "healthier" version, you would NEVER know - it has all the taste and features you are looking for out of the regular version. Made with organic long grain brown rice,  lactose-free milk and 1 tsp cinnamon thrown in, this recipe was everything I had hoped it would be and more. Super creamy. Sweet. Cinamonny. For the 1/3 cup sugar, I mixed half sugar and half Splenda and it was the perfect sweetness for me (I like it fairly sweet). In Canada, it's traditional to put maple syrup on top of rice pudding, so I added some no-sugar-added maple syrup and it even took this awesome rice pudding to the next level. Yum. Yum. Yum. I will keep this recipe and make it many times in the future. Because I need to try and maximize protein in my diet, I even added a scoop of vanilla brown rice protein (an extra 18g protein) to the just-cooked pudding - it didn't really alter the flavor at all, just the texture very slightly but I don't think it will even be noticeable after the pudding has had time to cool. Thanks so much for this recipe!

This is probably the third or fourth rice pudding recipe I've tried and was definitely the best. Made it with white rice, not brown and 1% milk and no butter.  Sprinkled in some cinnamon and grated in a small bit of tangerine rind at the end.  And, yes, definitely temper the egg before adding it. My mother-in-law's rice pudding has always been the gold standard in our house, but no longer!

Creamy and yummy. Simple ingredients that I had on hand- this was just the recipe I was looking for. I almost didn't find it, though, because of the word "healthy." I was looking for brown rice pudding, not necessarily healthy rice pudding! By the way, I recommend tempering the egg before adding it to the hot pudding- otherwise, you'll get scrambled egg bits in your pudding, of course.

FANTASTIC!  We had a cup left of unsweetened coconut milk, so we used that in combination with almond milk.  Plus, we already had three cups of brown rice left over.  This was a wonderful dessert and a great way to use up any left over brown rice.  DELICIOUS!

I love rice pudding so was excited to try this with brown rice.  The rice pudding tasted much better after it cooled for about an hour.  I had to add another cup of water during the first 45min.  Will probably be making this again!!

Delicious! Doubled the recipe, and substituted  honey and agave in place of the white sugar, simmered with 2 cinnamon sticks, instead of cinnamon, and added a little bit more butter, and this recipe is a winner! Sooooooo good, and eating it warm on a cold, snowy night is so comforting.

It's a big bowl of creamy goodness!  I follow the recipe (I add a 1/4 tsp cinnamon) for my family.   I am vegan, so I use unsweetened almond milk and leave out egg and butter...still creamy goodness.  Great either way.

I used already cooked rice, added thick cream & a half cup of whole milk instead. Came out really delicious with the changes.

This was very good, but a little too sweet for my taste.  Next time I'll cut the sugar to three T.  I did add a bit of cinnamon, which was good an comforting at the same time, and may add just a shake or two of cayenne next time, too!

I would make again.  Easy enough, normal ingredients.   I used original almond milk but everything else the same.  Might reduce sugar next time but I was told it was good the it is.  I never had rice pudding before and I thought it was good.

Very quick compared to other rice pudding recipes and so easy to make. I did temper my egg, added to pre-boiled milk and added cinnamon to finish. Will make again for sure. Love that it is a healthier but still tasty version.

If I could add a sixth star I would do so. This is oh soooo yummy. I did use white rice as my brown rice had a funny smell to it.
I have been trying different recipes for rice pudding and this is the CLOSEST I have ever come to the rice pudding found in diners. Oh my. I also topped it with cinnamon. Oh so yummy. next time I will try the Splenda.
A real diet buster....

I didn't make this recipe, but when comparing the nutritional information to the original, it only has 3 fewer calories and .5g less fat. I am sure it is more nutritious considering the brown rice, but I wouldn't consider this a low fat/low calorie recipe as others have mentioned in their reviews. Just a thought.

Excellent. Had not had rice pudding in quite awhile and last time we made it with white rice. This is better. Added a bit of extra vanilla as I do in most recipes.

For people who thought this was too sweet, definitely cut the sugar and know that the raisins will also make it sweeter.  Rice is known to be contaminated with arsenic.  Rinse your rice well in a small strainer and then cook it in a lot of water (about 6 cups) and strain and rinse it again when done.  Can use non-dairy milk (I like almond) to make it vegan.  Also, needs warming spices (I use apple pie spice or just cinnamon).  Thanks for a great recipe!

The only changes I made was using Unsweetened Coconut Milk, Stevia as the sweetener, and Currants instead of Raisins...plus I sprinkled a little cinnamon on top of each of the 4 servings.

Ok, this is The creamiest rice dessert ever!  It's Nothing like the old fashioned baked rice pudding, but it's really really yummy, Very creamy, and, easy to make!!  I used leftover brown coconut rice that didn't really turn out the night before, didn't serve it (1 c brown rice, 1-13.5 can of coconut milk, 7 oz water, a little salt), so it kind of modified this recipe right off the bat (I realize I'm rating a recipe that I didn't follow to a T, a big pet peeve of mine.  Sorry folks!)  I was looking for a way to salvage it and found this recipe.
So I heated it back up on the stove, added a 1/2 c unsweetened cashew milk and half the sugar, a little salt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon.  Once thoroughly heated through while constantly stirring, I added a 1/4 c more of the nut milk, a 1/4 c half & half, and 1 more teaspoon of sugar.  Once that was heated through again, I tempered a little of the hot rice mixture into the beaten egg, then added it into the entire mix.   After a few minutes of again stirring constantly over the heat, I removed it from the heat and added the vanilla and butter.  Served it with more cinnamon.  Yumm-ee!  So happy I made it :)

Gorgeous recipe!!  Based on other reviews, I cut down the sugar to 1 TB brown sugar and 1 TB honey. I omitted the butter and extra milk, and had fun with the toppings. Definitely a keeper recipe!

I took the advice of another rating and reduce the sugar to 1/2 cup, the raisins add a lot of sweetness too so there is no need 1/3 of a cup of sugar. I beat the egg in with the last 1/2 cup of milk and added 1 tsp of cinnamon. That's how rice pudding is made!

A m a z i n g! It's delicious and tastes real. I used maple syrup instead of sugar and it made it even healthier! Only thing is some of the egg got cooked. That's why I didn't rate it 5 stars. But, I'm going to try mixing the egg into the milk before pouring into the hot mixture and seeing if that fixes it. But I'll be making this again! I skipped out on the raisins and topped it with raspberries instead. 10/10.

I only had quick brown rice but it was still really good. My guess is it would be a little better with normal brown rice. I toned back the butter a tad and the raisins a little as well. Using only 1/2 cup of raisins was plenty for us (still get about 3 raisins per bite). Thanks for the recipe!

Made this recipe twice. The first time I cut the extra milk so it was creamier, but it was way too sweet. So the sexond time I cut the extra milk and halved the sugar. It worked well. The raisins give it the necessary sweetness.

 A tip. During the boiling of the brown rice I drained and replaced the water half way through. I felt that the water was to thick and discoloured, and that fresh water would aid the softening process, and also reduce the strong nutty flavour. Just remember to add extra time to allow for the water to reboil, or useboiling water as the replacement.

Made a double batch as we love this recipe! Used white rice and add spices to taste - cinnamon (a fair bit), cardamon (less than the cinnamon as its quite strong), and nutmeg (just a pinch) oh and I like less raisins. I used about 1/2 cup and cooked them a little first in water in the microwave to plump them up a bit.

Ok, first I subbed Truvia baking blend, using half of the amount needed for sugar. It wasn't too sweet at all! In fact I put a little maple syrup on top to sweetened it a bit more. I used condensed fat free milk and let it cook for a while longer than stated and added water as needed. Always temper eggs before you put them in anything hot. Add a little cinnamon and it's delicious! Also, I just added raisins until I thought there was enough.

This is a great recipe. I made this and everyone loved it. This was my first time making rice pudding even tho we all love it. I followed the recipe except for the amount of sugar. I used less than a 1/4 cup and it was sweet enough for us. I found that the water was absorbed by the rice after about 20 minutes. I might have been cooking it too fast. I will definitely make this again  I used long grain brown rice, that's all I had in the pantry.  Glorious rice pudding!!!   Trixie

Very Nice... thanks!  Subbed for 1/4 cup brown sugar and added a cinammon stick to milk for flavour.

I love the idea of brown rice.   It is really good and I will make it again.  I used a dried fruit mix because surprise - I didn't have any raisins.  Added half a tsp of cinnamon and quarter tsp nutmeg along with the milk and salt.  Didn't use the butter.

I made this for my boys this morning as an alternative to processed desserts. It was really tasty and you can barely tell it's brown rice...in fact I think it works better than white as it seems heartier. Next time I might cut the amount of sugar in half as it's pretty sweet but overall it's a great recipe :)

If you omit the raisin make sure you cook 1 cup rice, not 3/4. I will most likely cook this again, with my changes. Or maybe try dates, I dont like the taste of raisins re-plumped, might feel the same about dates or any other fruits I could add.

Almost as bad as cooked buckwheat porridge.
Disgusting vanilla mush. Doesn't harden properly in the fridge either.
And i did this with low fat buttermilk? wow people actually eat this .

Spare this  recipe and either go with http://allrecipes.com/recipe/creamy-brown-rice-pudding/
Which uses evapourated milk to get it to a true pudding texture and uses nutty flavor rather than vanilla.
Or just go to your local deli and buy eastern European hazelnut pudding and use low fat milk top it with some nutella and ground hazelnuts/almond meal.
Not recommended and this is coming from someone who makes a new pudding each week.

Tried this just now, on the spur of the moment.  Had all the ingredients except raisins.  It is very easy to make and absolutely delicious!  Unfortunately, it's so delicious, I ate the entire pan myself.  Oops.

Excellent! I used 2 packets of stevia instead is sugar and a little less milk. Used unsweetened almond milk and no butter. Use only 1/2 raisins

I don't know what happened. Apparently I'm the only one who didn't like it. It just never got creamy, it never thickened. It was like milk soup with rice. It was very sweet too, but that wasn't the main issue I had with this. I really wanted to like this, as I love rice pudding and a healthier version would have been great. But I guess I'll stick with my usual recipe.

I made this rice pudding while waiting for my dinner to cook, that's how quick and easy it is. 
I did not have brown rice so I used jasmine and it still turned out great. 
Other then the rice I did not substitute or change the recipe at all but I found the cooking times to be a lot less than the recipe stated which could just be due to my stove top temp. 
I have eaten it warm and cold and I love it both ways! 
Definitely a keeper :)
