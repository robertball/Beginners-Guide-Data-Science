These were tasty. My husband really liked them. I do have a suggestion if anyone would like to try it and that's add half oil and half butter and about 1/4 cup parm cheese. Place marinade in blender then marinate. The butter mixture will cling to the shrimp and give it more flavor while its cooking.

A definite favorite!!  The marinade is so easy to prepare and can be done ahead of time.  Instead of making kabobs, we used a grilling basket and cooked shrimp on the grill til it turned pink.  Served over linguini with the following sauce:  Saute together 1 stick butter, juice of 1 lemon, 1 T minced garlic, 1/4 cup vegetable oil, 1 T (or more to taste) red pepper flakes and a spash of white wine.  Simply delicious!!!!!

My family absolutley goes crazy when I make this recipe. I follow the recipe exactly and it turns out incredible. I serve the shrimp with pasta that I toss with olive oil, garlic, salt, parmesan, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. It is delicious :)

Great recipe!!  Just tried a few changes - instead of marinating seperately first skewer - try adding mushrooms and scallops - add to a large ziploc freezer bag (just remember to cut the sharp tips off the skewers).  Then add marinade to ziploc bag. Try rolling in a mixture of italian bread crumbs and parmasan cheese(50/50 mix) then grill on a George Forman grill.Then drizzle with garlic butter(it just melted in your mouth).  The mushrooms are awesome and makes the kabobs look bigger.  Makes the shrimp and scallops go further. If the mushrooms are large, cut in half.

Since there was only the two of us, hubby just stuck these under the broiler.  Delicately seasoned, light, fresh and flavorful. So refreshing to find a shrimp dish not heavily sauced or seasoned.  Perfect.

My husband couldn't get enough of this dish! I made a double batch of the marinade and set aside half to coat the pasta; I then marinated pre-cooked shrimp using my FoodSaver for about 45 minutes. I grilled the shrimp on the Foreman grill (lined with foil for easy clean-up) and tossed the shrimp and marinade together with whole-wheat linguine. The family loved it (although the kids didn't care for the red pepper flakes) and husband commented that it was the best shrimp & pasta he'd ever had.

I really can't rave enough about how good this was. Easy too! I only had frozen precooked jumbo shrimp. I defrosted it, marinated it and then grilled it for just a couple of minutes on each side. This was so good that even my husband (the cocktail sauce guy) ate it without sauce. I highly recommend this one if you're looking for something simple, different and tasty to grill.

Divine! Only my most favorite recipes get 5 stars! This was so good. I made two batches of the marinade, one batch for the shrimp and another batch to marinate boneless skinless chicken breasts. In the batch of marinade for the shrimp I used 4 tablespoons of butter. I only had dry parsely flakes. The red pepper flakes give it just the right "snap". I also pan fried both. It was great on both the chicken and shrimp. I  served my surf and turf with fresh sweet corn.

Thank you for this perfect light summer fare.  I served with pasta that was lightly tossed with some of the marinade I kept separate- just added a little fresh lemon and some grated parmesan when plated- Yum Yum.

The shrimp was good.......but, making a sauce made this a 5 star....so good!   Sauce:  Saute 1 stick butter, juice of 1 lemon, 1 T miniced garlic, 1/4 cup veg. oil, 1/2 t. red pepper flakes, and a splash of white wine.  Add grilled shrimp and top over pasta.  EXCELLENT!!!!

Excellent scampi.  I did not discard the marinade.  Instead I cooked it in a pot till boiling, then reduced to simmer until the the shrimp was done on the grill.  I layed the shrimp on a bed of whole wheat spaghetti, and drizzled with the heated marinade.  Delicious.  Thank you for sharing.

The marindate was excellent but I didn't grill the shrimp, I made the traditional scampi dish with angel hair pasta.  I used cooked frozen shrimp that were almost thawed and kept them in the marindate for about an hour in the fridge.  To make a sauce, I melted a stick of butter, with some pepper, dried parsley, minced garlic (about 5 large cloves), chopped shallots (3) , 1/2 cup chardonnay, squeezed 1.5 lemon juice and added a touch of saffron. I added the shrimp to the sauce until the shrimp were hot (about 5 minutes - careful not to overheat). I also tossed in some steamed broccoli & mushrooms that I cooked separately.  Delicious!

This was a fabulous, quick meal for any weekday night, but could also be glammed up as a weekend dinner for guests.  I actually had pre-cooked fresh shrimp, so I opted to marinate as written, and place on the grill for a very short amount of time (just to heat and char slightly).  Worked like a charm....served with  buttered tagliolini pasta for a real treat.

So simple and amazing! I cooked it in a pan for 4 minutes, then poured the shrimp and the sauce over angel hair pasta. This is my husbands new favorite dish! Served with some grilled asparagus, easy, cheap, delicious!!

This recipe was really good the first time I made it.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The second time I made it I added 1/3 c. melted butter and 1/4 cup white wine to the  marinade.  I cooked the shrimp in the marinade on the stove.  It was awesome!  Had rice with it and used the marinade over the rice.  YUM!!!

I have made this several times now and it is delicious.  Due to a shellfish allergy I've only actually tried one shrimp the first time I made it (any more than 5 shrimp and that's it for me), but everyone else loved it!

I tried this tonight for dinner and everyone in my family really liked it.  Of course, I can't leave a recipe alone so I did add 1 T. of melted butter and a pinch of sea salt to the marinade.  I think the butter helped keep it moist during grilling.  A really great way to BBQ larger shrimp.  We served it with the Basil Parmesan Orzo (from this site) and a green salad.

Loved this recipe, however, I did make some changes, since its the middle of winter here I just sauteed the shrimp in the marinade, took shrimp out and added half a stick of butter, some garlic and a splash of white wine. Served over spaghetti and added some parmesan cheese to top it off. Wonderful!

Very good! I made this in a hurry and probably only marinated it for 20 minutes. Wished I could have done it for the whole 30. I also grilled them on my George Forman because it's cold here and didnt wanna get my butt in the cold weather.

Excellent dish.  Our grill was out of gas, so I broiled the fish after marinating for a few hours.  I forgot to add the red pepper, but that probably would have made it even better.  I also added 1/4 c of parmesan cheese, as suggested by others.

Excellent Shrimp! We could not have been happier. Followed the recipe and would not change a thing. Great flavor and the grilling time was right on. Served these with steak for a "surf and turf" yesterday to a very large crowd and everyone loved these. I was so surprised that a 30 min marinade could produce so much flavor. I'm sure we will make these again very soon.  Thanks for sharing!

This was great!  Fast and easy.  I added about 3x the garlic and used less olive oil.  Will make again for a week night meal.

Awesome! We added melted butter. If using scallops, don't marinate longer than about 15 minutes or they'll get too mushy.  The shrimp was deeeeelicious! Don't put scallops and shrimp on the same skewer as the shrimp cook more quickly, and you don't want to over cook them. GREAT!!!!!!

My roomate and I crave this recipe.  I always serve the shrimp with pasta with olive oil, garlic, salt, parmesan, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. This is the best recipe on here as far as I'm concerned :)

Great nomminess - though I did cheat and follow the suggestion of half oil/butter and tossing in Parmesan.

Excellent dish, although we added a little more pepper and garlic. I found that when it is prepared with the small shrimp, the marinade is more than enough for a full 2 pounds. Delicious!

Overall, it was a pretty good recipe, but I would not put that much lemon juice again, as it was just too overpowering, even with the addition of some grated parmesan cheese to the mixture.  Next time, I'll cut the lemon juice in half and see what that does.

Oh wow! This was fantastic! I tried the suggestion of another reviewer and cut the olive oil in 1/2 and added 2 tablespoons of melted butter along with 1/4 cup of parmesan cheese - the marinade really stuck to the shrimp this way. I can't wait to serve this to company!

This is going to become a weekly dish in my household.  This was excellent.  Fresh parsley is not needed, I used dried and it was great.  I didn't use the crushed red pepper, but that was just personal preference.  Definintely a winner.

Absolutely wonderful! I had to double the recipe to satisfy the crowd.My family absolutley goes crazy when I make this recipe. I follow the recipe exactly  as is! Serve the shrimp with pasta tossed with olive oil, garlic, salt, parmesan, italian seasoning and red pepper flakes. Nice time, I might add some satueed vegetables (such as mushrooms, red & green bell peppers) with the pasta for a complete meal.

This is a great recipe for shrimp!  Although I did kick up the amount of garlic to 4 Tablespoons, because the hubby is a garlic nut!  And I added 1 1/2 tsp of cayenne pepper to bring the temp up.  Great, great, great recipe, thanks for posting!

Absolutely great shrimp marinade!  I added several cloves of minced garlic.  My two guests, four children and I devoured the entire recipe in minutes - wish I'd doubled! or tripled!  The secret with grilled shrimp is to use FRESH shrimp and not to overcook - two/three minutes per side is plenty as long as you don't cram them too tightly on your skewers.  To the reviewer who used cooked shrimp then complained that the shrimp were tough, you can't recook cooked shrimp without them losing their texture!  You'll have better luck with raw shrimp, or use cooked but just put them on the hot grill for a couple of seconds per side to get the grill marks.  Try this one - super fresh taste!

This is an excellent Scampi recipe. I made a few minute changes. Used 1/4 cup of olive oil (don't really need 1/2 cup)and a little less lemon; then took the leftover marinade, sauteed it in a pan, added about 1/2 cup chicken boullion and a little thickener. Served over Dreamfield's pasta (low carb, high fiber brand that tastes great) and it came out perfect. Great grill flavor comes through and it is wonderful. Will definitely make again. Thanks for the recipe!!

Really yummy! I omitted the crushed red pepper and used black pepper instead. I also use fresh lemon juice. Just make sure and soak those skewers for a few hours!

This is without a doubt the BEST shrimp that I have EVER eaten, bar none.  I continued to marinate while they were cooking and tried to get all the garlic on them.  I didn't use the red pepper flakes used a sprinkle of powdered cayenne and it was amazing.  I'm gushing over with praise for this recipe.  Try it, you will be happy you did!

I made this intending to put it on the grill, but then I decided to put in some baby portabella mushrooms and diced some green onions and just stir fried over the stove for about six minutes just until the shrimp was pink. I did add some fresh Parmesan cheese and a splash of Chardonnay wine. We served over rice. It was a big hit with the whole family.

This was wonderul! I've used this marinade on the grill and on the stovetop. I love the red pepper (and have finally found a use for all of my accumulated red pepper packets from pizza!) In my experience, corn oil works just as well as olive oil (slightly different flavor), and an extra dash of rosemary is wonderful.

We thought this was fantastic!  I've never been a fan of Scampi because of the whole "drowning in butter" thing but this had great flavor!  Very easy and beautiful over brown rice.  I used dried parsley because that's what I had but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  There was not one shrimp leftover!

I had my inlaws over for dinner and had never made scampi before, so I was nervous about this, but they loved it!
They thought it was better than red lobster.  I served it with pasta tossed with olive oil, minced garlic and roasted green peppers, onions and carrots.  I am saving this recipe for sure.

Excellent recipe for both the outdoor grill and indoor skillet.  For the latter, reduce the olive oil by a third to 1/6 cup, and the lemon juice to that of a half lemon, adding the rest up to 1/6 cup in orange juice or other less-sour citrus.  It also helps for garlic lovers to roast the garlic beforehand and use the garlic oil towards the olive oil quota.

This recipe is wonderful both girls and hubby love this along with a grilled steak, bakers and salad adding fresh mushrooms stretches the kabobs better and gives shrimp a nice flavor try adding a pinch of parsley flakes along with marinade also if you dont have olive oil try using 3 tbs of vegetable oil turns out just as well..I also add a dash of nortons nature seasoning to the marinade..thankyou for the wonderful recipe been using it for months now just never got around to the review definately a keeper

OK, this recipe is so simple even a camper can do it!  Yes, it's a GREAT RV recipe IMHO.  I cleaned/deveined medium shrimp and soaked in a bowl w/1 tsp. baking soda for 1/2 an hour.  Drained and rinsed well, dried and put into the marinade and then cooked over grill on skewers.   PERFECT as is and many THANK YOU's for posting this!  It's a real keeper.

WOW! Shrimp, garlic, and lemon! Loved this dish and its simple, light ingredients for an easy marinade. I used extra large shrimp, stuck it in the oven. In the end I did sprinkle a little parmesan cheese over the shrimp. Thou I wished I had reserved a little marinade to put over the shrimp. I made just enough to serve two people. This went perfectly with, "Orzo with Parmesan and Basil", from this website. With these two complementing each other I was in heaven!!!

I used already cooked shrimp and only cooked, maybe 5 min.  I used a griddle.  I also only had lime juice on hand.  I also added the crushed red pepper.  Next time I'll use raw shrimp, as called for, and maybe even a litte more garlic.  This recipe is repeatable:)

I am not a shrimp lover at all, but this was awesome I ate 12 w/o even thinking about it.  My husband said it was the best he's ever had.  I made this with pasta on the side.  Although for kids I would make some w/o the red pepper.  For adults who like a kick, the red pepper is a must!

I have made this numerous times and it always meets with high praise - very easy and incredibly delicious - instead of a bowl, I always use a ziploc - and I almost always marinate for more like an hour.  I usually don't have freash parsley, but dried works well too - highly recommeded.

Good recipe but way too lemony.  My husband didn't care for it at all due to the overwhelming lemon taste. I think next time I will cut the lemon juice in half.  Other than that, it was easy to fix and pretty tasty.

My husband is not a big fan of shrimp, but when I asked him how this was after a few bites, he said,"Excellent!"  I wrapped these in bacon and ended up broiling them.  I agree that some of the flavor disappeared, and I marinated them for almost an hour.  This recipe is a definite keeper.

Yumm! I would marinate for up to 2-3 hours rather than 30 minutes. And serve with a saucer with warm butter! Delicious. Goes great with anything.

This is a very delicious shrimp recipe, and I rated it a 5 even though I kinda messed it up (I will make again).
What I did wrong:  After marinating, I skewered  alternating shrimp with onion, bell pepper, and mushrooms.  Adding veggies to the kabobs is where I messed up because it caused the shrimp not to lay flat on the surface of the grill and it cooked unevenly.  As a result, I had to cook the kabobs longer for total doneness, so some of the shrimp were tough and overcooked, whereas others were undercooked.
Next time, I will skewer shrimp on their own skewers.  The veggies were a hit, so they'll get their own skewers, too.

This turned out so good.  I added about 2-3 tbsp. of softened butter to the marinade and a bit of paprika for color.  I reserved a little of it in a separate container before adding the shrimp.  Cover and refrigerate the reserved marinade and after grilling the shrimp, microwave the reserved marinade for a minute and drizzle over the grilled shrimp.  Fantastic.  Just like scampi.

I give this recipe five stars and I haven't even tried it yet.  Sounds absolutely great, but I read all the reviews hoping to find the answer to a question I have.  Are the shrimp peeled or marinated in the shell? Please help - I want to try this for company this weekend.  Thanks

This was the best scampi I have ever had! I doubled the recipe and I followed the recipe as is except for I used half olive oil and half butter. I made the scampi over rice pasta and to dress the pasta, I basically reserved half of the marinade and sauteed the marinade until the garlic was cooked and then I added the cooked pasta into it.  Afterwards, I tossed in the grilled shrimp that were still a little under cooked and tossed in the pan, until it all cooked thoroughly.  I just topped it with crushed red pepper.  Tasted amazing! This recipe will definitely become a staple in my kitchen!

This is a staple in our family during the summer.  We throw them on the grill and enjoy with a nice glass of white wine.  I do like to add some fresh basil and a splash of white wine with the other ingredients.  Perfect!

I made this recipe as instructed, except I used large (16-20/lb.) fresh Gulf shrimp and it turned out perfectly.  Superb.  I served a side dish of angel hair pasta with a light olive oil/garlic sauce on it, to which I had added a bit of lemon zest and about a teaspoon of fresh lemon juice.  It truly complimented the scampi nicely.  An excellent meal!

This was so good the first time, that I made it again the next evening.  I was too lazy to fire up the grill considering how quick the shrimp would cook up, it didn't seem worth it, so I just put in a pan on the stove top.  Very fresh tasting.  Loved it!

I live in Phoenix and during the summer the oven is off limits, so I was super excited to try this out.  This was SOOO good!  I reserved some of the marinade and tossed it in some angel hair pasta with some parm cheese.  The starch thickened it into a nice sauce.  With some steamed broccoli this was an super dinner.  Inexpensive, way easy, and gourmet!  A favorite in my house for sure.

Very moist & flavorful.  I'd use the largest size shrimp available since the shrimp does shrink significantly.

I thought this recipe was AWESOME!!!! I love shrimp and is always looking for a new way to cook them this was an great one. I did take the advice of one of the readers which was to add 1/2 cup of butter and 1/4 of olive oil to the mixture. The butter stuck to the shrimp perfectly. my family and my boyfriend loved them. This a new favorite and will surely make this again!!!!!

THE BEST!!!!!!!!!! Super easy and super tasty. I combined butter and olive oil instead of straight olive oil, added a handful of fresh Parmesan cheese then blended. I also used dried parsley flakes because I didn't have fresh ones, still turned out AMAZING!!!

I've made this fantastic scampi many times, adding some butter to the marinade. I sautée the shrimp until not quite done. This is important so they don't get overcooked when finishing the dish. The red pepper is a great addition. Heat the leftover marinade, toss into al denté linguini with grated reggiano and black pepper. Lastly add shrimp and toss at the end just to heat up.  Add some lemon, black pepper and cheese to taste, garnish with fresh parsley and watch them devour it. again 12/2010!!!!!

You can't go wrong with this recipe.  I love garlic and lemon with my shrimp.  I recently got the brand new Pampered Chef BBQ Grill Basket and used it for this recipe.  Works great!  You can find the basket at www.pamperedchef.biz/DanielleFL

This is more of an observation.  If you marinade any meat in lemon juice, the cooking process will began, so I would add the lemon juice right before cooking and only add 1 tblsp.

Tasty! I'd suggest adding chili powder instead of red pepper flakes, but i like shrimp scampi a little spicy...

If you use cooked shrimp from the grocery store, all you need to do is saute after you marinate, just as good...

when the shrimp curl up a little tighter into balls theyre done...

great recipe, thanks!

Absolutely delish!  It was pouring rain out, so I stuck the skewers under the broiler in the oven for 4 minutes or so - fabulous!

This was SOOOOOO good!  I followed the recipe exactly, but did not use the crushed red pepper flakes.  I served over pasta and next time will follow the other reviewers suggestion to make extra marinade to toss in the pasta.  I am not a lemon fan and was afraid the shrimp would have too much lemon flavor, but I was pleasantly surprised that it did not.  This one is most definitely a keeper!

This was very good but we prefer white wine instead of lemon juice.  Think next time I will leave out the crushed red pepper and add a bit of Cajun Blackening Seasoning for that bit of a kick.

I used butter, and added parsley, thyme and oregano to the mix.  These are the best grilled shrimp ever!  My husband, who hasn't enjoyed shrimp in 20 years, loved them!  A serious winner!

I also followed the suggestion half oil and half butter. I think it worked a little better but either way is excellent as long as you don't overcook the shrimp.

We ate it, but there was very little flavor. I think it needs wine or something. I used grapeseed oil instead, it was all I had, and I sauteed the shrimp on the stove for 3-4 minutes instead. I have done shrimp this way before with just garlic and butter and white wine and it turns out wonderful, but the parsely and oil did nothing for the flavor. I had to add alot of butter to the noodles and garlic and salt and pepper.  I will not make this again.  For $12.99 a pound of shrimp, it was too expensive to try.

Even after marinading for two hours, it still came out kinda bland.  At least the shrip tasted fresh and sweet, otherwise it would've been a total waste.

I loved the recipe! It was quick and delicious! I however replaced the lemon juice with white wine -- instead of grillling -- I simply did a shrimp-saute on top of the stove and it was FANTASTIC!

excellent marinade if you want the fresh flavor of the shrimp to predominate.  I've used this as a pasta sauce with the addition of a little white wine and freshly grated parmesan cheese.  just quick saute the shrimp in the flavored oil, add the liquid ingredients and serve over hot pasta.

Yum!  I couldn't find my skewers and didn't really want to heat up the big grill so I placed the shrimp directly on my little George Forman.  It worked great and they tasted wonderful.  Thank you for an easy scampi recipe.

This was awesome.  I doubled the marinade and make sure you don't overcook.  Big hit.  Next time I will probably add some veggies to skewers too.

One Great Recipe!  I made this with 2" grilled beef tenderloin steaks.  The shrimp was a bigger hit!  I will definitely make this part of my summer (spring and fall) menu! For the reviwer who complained that the shrimp was not flavorful enough, did you peel and devein your shrimp before marinating?

Now that it is winter in Maryland (boo-hoo), I saute (with marinade)on the stove top until shrimp are pink. serve over pasta. I have also tried adding some dry jerk seasoning. Very tasty!!!  Thank you Holly!!!

Loved this. I used jumbo shrimp and scallops to make kebabs. (TIP: if you're using bamboo skewers, soak them in water for an hour or two before grilling to keep them from burning.)Nice flavors---the crushed red pepper adds just the right sweet/spicy touch. I'll be making this one again...and again...and again......

This was the most delicious recipe!!  I made this for an anniversary dinner as an appetizer.  I wish I had bought more shrimp to make this just our meal because it tasted so good!!  Make sure you don't leave it on the grill too long, or it will dry out real quick.  Absoulutely LOVE this one, better than the restaurants!!!!

Would just like to give everyone a lil secrete for deveining shrimp.  If you take a fork and put one tine just under the shell at the head end and hold the tail and "PUSH" the fork all the way to the tail end it will take the shell off and devein it at the same time.  No fuss.

Great recipe!!  I did follow BajaValle's suggestion and added butter and parmesan cheese to the marinade.  Marinaded for an hour and grilled as recommended.  The additional cheese added a little crust to the shrimp and it turned out tasting incredible.  All of my family ooh'd and aah'd over it and told me to add this to their favorites as well.  Definitely will make again!!

My husband and I really enjoyed these alongside our tenderloin steaks.  No changes needed at all.  So easy and delicious!  Even easier because i grilled them loose in a grill pan instead of skewering them.

I make this for every bbq at my house and it's always a big hit! I make it in 4lb batches (Costco 4lb bag) and make it w/1 C lemon and a whole head of parsley.  It can be made a day ahead less the lemon.  Add the lemon 1/2 hr before cooking as instructed.  Great recipe! Thanks Holly!

Very, very good! Didn't use black pepper, just a little extra chipotle pepper flakes instead and served with spaghetti squash. This met my Paleo diet 100%!

This was really good! I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great! (Note to self: next time save yourself a ton of work and buy the shrimp that is already peeled and de-veined!) :)

Followed recipe as shown but added 2 TBSP of butter to the ingredients (suggested from another viewer) to help make everything stick to the shrimp when grilling.  Two thumbs up!!!!!  I would continue sticking to the recipe for sure...

Loved this! Served it with Parmesan Basil Orzo from this site. I did use 1/2 EVOO and 1/2 butter vs all olive oil. Scampi has butter in it, but by using 1/2 in this recipe it lightens the fat and you still get the butter taste. Added 1/4 c grated parm as other reviewer suggested. I added a few small pieces sweet red bell peppers and grape tomatoes to each skewer, spooned the left over marinade over the skewers while grilling. Fabulous an impressive served with the orzo!

I had to use dried parsley and my grill ran out of fuel a quarter of the way through and I finished cooking the shrimp on a stovetop grill pan.  This was still AWESOME!  A little subtle smoke flavor from the grill was a nice touch.  I cooked the marinade after I put the shrimp on the grill and tossed the cooked shrimp back into the "sauce" to serve.  Make rice or bread to sop up all the delicious juices.

This is a GREAT recipe. I've been looking for a good shrimp scampi recipe. I actually did this recipe in a sauté version and added Parm cheese in the marinade and served over pasta. YUMM!

This is an absolute favorite of my wife and myself. Its simple to make and always comes out good. My wife can't handle anything even slightly hot so I leave out the pepper (sometimes I mix two separate batches and put pepper in mine). Whenever the local supermarkets have uncooked shrimp on sale I stock up. We make this about every couple of weeks and never tire of it! Thanks for this fantastic yet simple recipe.

This is beyond amazing!  I did use half butter/half olive oil.  Dried parsley.  Fresh garlic in a tube (Gourmet Gardens brand).  We had those frozen gigunda shrimp from Sam's.  They are like small lobster tails.  My husband's birthday dinner rocked!!!

So simple, and yet so delicious!  I skewered the shrimp  and then put under the broiler for a couple minutes on each side.  Served with Spinach Rice Casserole.

WOW. I admit I included many of the suggestions in the top-rated reviews. I also kept bumping the garlic until it matched our palates (1/4 C in the marinade for 2 lb of raw shrimp in the shell). One review suggested cooking these in a basket - DON'T. I did it half & half. The ones on skewers had 5x the flavor of their cousins in the basket. Served on fettuccine  with a garlic (another 1/4 C) - Parm butter sauce rich with herbs . . . OMG.

These shrimp were very good.  I did make a couple of changes.  I added 2 Tbsp butter and 3 Tbsp olive oil because we like that butter flavor.  I also added some grated parmesan, probably about 3 Tbsp or so.  I marinated the shrimp for about 45 minutes and then brushed marinade while they grilled.  Very good flavor!

I have made this twice, both times exactly as written, including the red pepper flakes. The first time I broiled the shrimp & served them over linguine with garlic butter sauce; the second I used my Geo. Foreman grill & threw them into a hearty tossed salad. The hardest part was keeping people from stealing them off the skewers before I could add them to the dish!

This was some of the best shrimp I have had in a long time - absolutly wonderful!  I followed the recipe exactly except doubled it, and reduced the olive oil to two tablespoons (watching fat intake).  After marinating the shrimp, I placed the remaining marinade in a sauce pan and boiled it.  I then removed it from the heat, added about 3 tbsp cold butter (for my family's sake), and served the sauce over linguine, and as a dip for the shrimp.  Wonderful dish and I will make it many, many times!!

Excellent Dish!  Very good marinade.  Just the right amount of garlic, wish I had added more lemon juice though.  It got windy and cold, so I broiled them in the middle rack along with the Grilled rock lobster from this site.

This was okay. It's missing some kinda wow factor. I tossed the shrimp with linguine coated in the same sauce (I doubled the recipe and set some aside just for the pasta, as another suggested). I probably won't make this again.

I followed the directions for this recipe to a T and it was just so so, nothing wrong with the flavor at all, just wasn't the best thing I've ever tasted. I was out of parmesan cheese but I wished I had had some to add to the flavor, I think that would've added the right touch. Good for dinner, but nothing special.

Substituted butter for half the olive oil and sauteed it in the marinade.  Wonderful!

Second time:  Used all olive oil and grilled as stated.  So good!  Great flavor.

I love scampi and was so excited for this recipe but it didn't quite live up to my expectations. It just wasn't all that flavorful. I will try the recipe again but will add more garlic and spices and see how it goes.

This fell a bit on the "OK" side for us.  While not bad at all, I think it needed a bit more garlic, and maybe some Dijon mustard.

There just wasn't enough flavor on it's own to "wow" us.

This is a 5 star recipe as is.  Hubby and I both agreed we did NOT like it with pasta as the other reviewers suggested.  We also do NOT double the sauce. I'll make it again (and try with scallops) for an appetizer or a main dish.  Try this with Orzo with Parmesan and Basil.  Thanks Holly!

I think I expected a little more 'scampi' flavor (garlic / butter) but overall was a good recipe.  Don't overcook shrimp or it will turn out rubbery!  (which is why you want to start with raw shrimp when grilling)

This was fabulous! I grilled the shrimp in a grill basket and then served over linguini. I made a triple batch of the marinade and poured that over the pasta. It was almost even better the next day after all of the flavors soaked in. I highly recommend this one!

This was excellent.  I added a little extra of the minced garlic, and it was "to die for".  Will make again soon!  In fact, I may make it tonight!

This recipe is simple and fabulous!  I serve it several ways, as an appetizer, with steaks and over rice.  Everyone who I served it to loves it.

Enjoyed it.  Did not have the red pepper so will try again to see if I can give it 5 stars instead of only 4.  Cooked them on a Webber grill while at the community pool which caused a bit of a stir.  Others seemed to like it too.

I made these for a 12 person dinner party, and it turned out to be a great decision because most of the preparation can be done ahead of time (a big plus for me).  I just stuck them on the grill right before serving.  Great flavor.

We added salt to the marinade, added no red pepper, and used extra jumbo shrimp. We cooked it with some T-bones for a Mother's Day meal we shared with another couple. All four of us were in ecstacy during dinner!

I have actually made this several times and my daughter & I love it (the rest of my family are strange and don't like shrimp). I usually put all the shrimp along with the marinade in a foil packet on the grill but have done it the way the recipe is written as well.

I loved this recipe!!  I made it on a stove-top grill and I didn't use fresh parsley (I used the one that comes dried in a bottle)  but it still was amazing.  I did, however, forget to buy skewers so it took me a while to flip each shrimp over.  I also added a little bit of garlic powder to the marinade.  I loved it but some of my family members thought it was a little too much garlic.  Either way, I loved it and plan on making it again.  I would recommend using jumbo shrimp because they get a little smaller while they are cooking so regular sized shrimp will shrink too much.

Hubby used pre-cooked frozen shrimp and sauteed these stovetop. Served over angel hair pasta with sprinkle of shredded parmesan. They ate all of this, there were no leftovers! I expect these will be as wonderful on the grill too.

My 2nd time making this in about 2 weeks!  So easy - I didn't mess with the grill last time, so just quickly sauteed in my big black skillet.  Serve w/ stir fry veggies and whole grain rice and you have a yummy, healthy, fast meal.  Thank you!

Fantastic!  I didn't change a thing, except I cooked outside on the BBQ.  I served the skewers with a green salad and French bread and glass of white wine.  Everyone loved, I will be making this over and over again!

Simple yet amazing recipe.  It was our first ime grilling shrimp but it will not be our last.  I marinated the shrimp for a couple of hours and it was perfect.  So perfect, I really did not want to share.

This is wonderful.  So easy, so delicious!  I took another reviewers suggestion by changing it to half oil, half butter.  The butter definitely added to the flavor.  This is going on my "make for parties" list.

Instead of marinating and grilling the shrimp according to the recipe, I sauted the shrimp in the sauce then added a little cornstarch to thicken. Turned out great, will make again!

I was looking for a quick shrimp scampi to serve over pasta and this looked nice and easy.  I doubled the garlic and let marinate for the 15 minutes while my pasta boiled but instead of grilling, I sauteed it and finished it off with a 1/4 cup of butter and a tsp of kosher salt.  Thought it might be too much lemon but it was great, nice and garlic-y!!!!

This was good, but nothing special.  I made this recipe and the recipe for Grilled Marinated Shrimp on this website (the one that uses tomato sauce) and the Grilled Marinated Shrimp recipe was by far the favorite.

I didn't have skewers on hand so I just cooked it all in a  frying pan on the stove and served it over linguine.  It came out great. It may have needed a little more lemon juice and/or a touch of salt, but that's just something to play around with next time. Overall, very good.

This recipe is great. I marinated the shrimp for about one hour. I did make a couple of changes to marinade - left out the red pepper flakes (not into spicy) and added some fresh basil. Threaded onto skewers alternating with onion, red bell pepper, baby bellas and grape tomatoes. My husband said it was better than a restaurant meal. I'm going to try scallops next time! Thanx for a winning recipe.

This was wonderful!  I did add extra garlic, butter, and white wine to the marinade and also, instead of crushed red pepper flakes, I added 1/4 teaspoon of hot pepper (Tobasco) sauce.  It was super easy to make and guests loved them!

My family loved this recipe....I basted the shrimp several times with the juice/marinade as it was grilling!!! Also, I served over linguine, olive oil, parsley and red pepper flakes as suggested by another reviewer and WQW! My husband said this was as good as any restaurant version he had ever tried. Repeat recipe!

Great shrimp.  I add some white wine and Old Bay to the marinade.  Be sure to use the red pepper flakes.  I've grilled these in my George Forman and they are great.  Try them on top of a Caesar Salad---Yum!

After making the first batch of these and finding them to be lacking in flavor, we added some Zatarain's cajun/creole seasoning to the next batch - big improvement. The recipe as is just tasted too bland to us. Next time we'll use larger shrimp as well, the medium ones really shrank up on the grill.

A real winner!  I added a little cajun seasoning and seasoning salt, then sauted them in a skillet on my cooktop for 2-3 minutes, turning once.  Served them with roasted corn and a green salad,

Fabulous!  After I made this the first time, 'popular demand' forced me to make it again two nights later.  I added extra garlic and a splash or two of white wine to the marinade.

We love this recipe.  I cooked the shrimp on a grill type pan on the stove and it turned out great.  My son, who never eats shrimp, scarfed it down.  We are looking forward to the next time already.

Loved this shrimp and will definitely make it again.  I added a dash of worschestershire and Old Bay, and grilled them outdoors on skewers. 
Thanks Holly!

I made this recipe for a dinner party of twelve along with steak shish kabobs.  I used the recipe as written except I quadrupled it.  The shrimp were delicious.  We grilled them and served them with vegetables and rice.  Everyone loved them!  Will definitely make this recipe again.

i made this last week, of course i needed someone to rate it, my better half. loved it BUT i made not the scampi, i used this recipe to Marinade my Shrimp only, and put them on Skewers, yummy! So this week we are going to a party, i have 44 shrimp, just made the same, but i tweaked it, i put cilantro rather than parsley, and added Parsley flakes... ;o) try this, delicious!

These were tasty, a keeper for sure. 1.5 lbs isn't enough shrimp for 6 people, though. Bumped it up to 2, and added a little salt to the marinade, too. When they came off the grill (we used a flat grill pan instead of skewers) we tossed them in a bowl with a pat of butter

This summer main dish couldn't be easier to make.  Marinating it for a half hour really is long enough to impart flavor to the shrimp.  My guests raved and claimed they had never had better grilled shrimp in any restaurant.  My husband wants this on a weekly basis now.  Wonderful!

Absolutely delicious. I used half olive oil and half butter; marinated the shrimp in half the sauce and heated the rest to spoon over the cooked shrimp and brown rice. So easy and yummy!

Very easy marinade to prepare.  Shrimp were very good. Instead of using skewers I used a grill pan to cook the shrimp. Otherwise followed the recipe as written. I servered these over parmigiana butter garlic pasta. Definitely will be making these again!

I disliked the flavor because it held too much pepper what I would recommend is leaving the red pepper flakes out and adding Parmesan Cheese to give it a lighter more airy flavor instead of it being a very hot harsh flavor but other wise I enjoined it  very much

Delicious!  Would recommend buying the largest shrimp you can afford, so you have less to skewer and because it's so yummy.  Served with linguine noodles tossed with (per another reviewer) olive oil, crushed red pepper flakes, italian seasoning, S&P, and parm.  This is a keeper!

easy, simple shrimp recipe- which for seafood should always be.  don't forget to salt the shrimp before marinate, otherwise bland if made according to recipe. we also added chopped parsley at end for freshness and color.

This was really delicious!  I used pre-cooked shrimp to save time and marinated for onl 30 minutes then broiled it.  Savory yet light.  It is now my go to shrimp recipe.

Exceptional flavor, considering there's no butter which is why I tried them this way.  I marinated the shrimp in a ziplock bag, holding off on the lemon juice just before I skewered them and got the grill ready.  Don't skimp on the garlic.  That's what makes these soooo good.  I had a lemon pepper seasoning that I doused them with before they went on the grill.  Served on a bed of rice pilaf with peas, these were superb!

It started to rain, so we gave up on the grilling idea - but these shrimp turned out great on the stovetop too! I cooked the shrimp and all the marinade together in the pan, giving us a ready-to-go sauce to drizzle over pasta.

I love shrimp scampi, but never tried to make it.  Always bought the frozen stuff in the grocery store.  After trying this recipe, I will never buy it in frozen foods again!  This was very easy.  I didn't grill, instead, I stir fried in electric skillet.  Used parsley herb instead of fresh, works just as well, but use less.  Tried substituting fresh cilantro for the parsley, EVEN BETTER!

Very easy and delicious! I added 1/2 tbsp dry white wine, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly. The mustard was not at all overwhelming. Great recipe. Makes a lot of shrimp.

Excellent and easy.  I broiled shrimp for about 4 minutes and then added to a sauce made from a medium diced fresh tomato, 1/4 C melted butter, 3 T. lemon juice, 2 cloves of fresh grated garlic, 1/4 C. Chardonnay,1/4 tsp. cayenne, 1 T. dried Parsley and a bit of Lemon Zest,sauteed for about 5 minutes and poured over spaghetti noodles.  I was out of Angel Hair which might have been a bit lighter. Will definitely make again.

My husband loved this!  I stay away from seafood and meat but he really enjoyed...he's a spice-a-holic lol so upped the red pepper flakes, and I broiled for 3 minutes per side since I don't have a bbq grill. Hubby loved the taste and I loved the simple method. Thanks for sharing!

Oh this was so good. I left out parsley only because we didn't have any. We marinated these all day in the fridge and grilled them tonight. My husband basted them with butter while grilling. We ate them all no leftovers!  Will make them again and again.

This was SO good.  My 6 year old ate it and he doesn't even like shrimp.  The only thing I did different was added about a tablespoon of honey to the marinade.  This is a keeper!

These were delicious - I also used 1/2 butter and 1/2 olive oil, added some parmesan cheese to the marinade and processed till blended. I added the shrimp to the Tortellini Steak Caesar salad on this website and it was wonderful. Next time I will use larger shrimp.

Wow!  This was wonderful!  I bought the shrimp already on the skewers (on sale, yay!).  Just added the marinade, grilled to perfection and the family of 5 LOVED IT!!!! I served it over yellow, saffron rice and some fresh broccoli...I added a few lime wedges on the side for those of us who enjoy lots of citrus!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe!  :-)

I didn't use this as a marinade since I didn't have enough time. So I just melted 1 Tbls. of unsalted butter with 1 Tbls. and once the butter was melted I added the uncooked shrimp to the pan and poured the marinade over the shrimp. I cooked the shrimp for approx. 5 minutes (until they were completely pink). I used the marinade as a sauce and served it over whole grain linguine. It was AMAZING!!!

The sauce really did not have much flavor, unfortunately.  Butter probably would have been better, though more unhealthy.

I don't like shrimp but I made this for my hubby and he said it was good!  I only made 6 jumbo shrimp so I had to scale the ingredients back, and per his request I am going to add a bit more garic next time.

Absolutely delicious!  Next time I will save some of the marinade (since I used cooked shrimp anyway) for the rice we made on the side.

Great shrimp marinade! I changed it a little by adding Old Bay seasoning to the shrimp before I put them in the marinade. I also left them in their deveined shells and seasoned them with Old Bay once more after they were skewered. Simply awesome!

This is an amazing recipe. I followed it as written but then I added a few things. First I added some veggies like peppers, mushrooms, tomatoes and zuchinni. Then I added some parmasan cheese and butter as suggested by another reviewer. I also doubled the recipe because of all of the veggies. I then let it marinate in the fridge for a few hours. I put most of the Ingredients on the skewers but since I only have 8 skewers I had some left over that I put in a pan an cooked on the stove. I loved it on the grill and out of the pan either way it was delicious. I plan to make this again and hopfully soon. Thanks soo much for this great recipe.

OMG! This shrimp was AWESOME!  I made it for my mom's birthday today and it was my first time peeling and deveining and cooking shrimp.  I used the juice and zest from real lemons, and only had dried parsley, and it was still great!  I would recomend this any time.

This is a great, yet simple recipie.  I have to admit with what went into it and the way it looked as I let it marinade I didn't think it was gonig to be all that great...I was wrong.  Thanks for the contribution, this is a must try recipie, I'll certainly do it again.

Fantastic recipe Holly! I made a huge dinner Saturday night and two hours after dinner was over and dessert was eaten, out came the leftover shrimp and it was gone in a flash! Everyone raved over this and the smokey flavor from the grill gave the shrimp that extra YUM factor. Thank you!

Easy and delicious; what could be better? I used both shrimp and sea scallops; we all thought that both were wonderful.

I followed this recipe very closely, the only substitute was cilantro for parsley since I didn't have parsley.  The recipe is very easy but the marinade was bland.  I will try another recipe next time.

So good and easy! We needed a quick and easy meal to keep us from ordering pizza and this did the trick!   I pretty much followed the recipe exactly; the only things different were that I didn't have fresh parsley, so I used dry, and we cooked them up in a pan. Again so easy! Boiled up a little linguine pasta, mixed it up in the pan with the cooked shrimp and marinade, added a little butter and parm....YUM!! I will def be making this recipe again!

Best shrimp scampi i have ever had!
I ended up making this before i went to work and let it marinate in the fridge for around 6 hours, it was so flavorful everyone loved it! Isuggest you let it marinate for more than 30min.

This was perfect. I wanted garlicy shrimp, but not a messy grill or pasta. I subbed 3tsp dried parsley for 3tbs fresh, and I added garlic powder in addition to minced garlic. Be sure not to marinate too long, or the lemon juice will start cooking your shrimp. We'll be eating this again for sure!

I'm a non-drinker so it's great to find a shrimp scampi recipe that doesn't call for white wine! And I think this turned out better than any scampi I've had. The only thing I changed was that I omitted the parsley as I didn't have any and I used a pan (no skewers) as I don't have a grill either. I think it worked out better this way. After I cooked the shrimp, I deglazed the pan and ended up with a nice sauce to coat some pasta with. Perfect!

This recipe was so easy and oh so tasty! We LOVED it. I used dried parsley as I didn't have any fresh and I also used the red pepper flakes as suggested. I loved the spice and I will continue to use the red pepper flakes for added heat! I also used a bit more lemon juice than called for. This recipe was so good I'm making it again tomorrow!!!

This recipe is super easy with lots of flavor. I actually didn't have parsley on hand so I substituted basil for the parsley and it turned out fantastic. This is better than any shrimp you will find in a restaurant!

I made this last night and everyone loved it.  I added 3 lg. garlic cloves and served with orzo with lemon zest and green peas.  I used extra light virgin olive oil which made it a healthy dish.  Served with the orange, walnut, gorgonzola and mixed green salad with fresh citrus vinaigrette from this site for a wonderful light meal.

This is amazing. I make this all the time but I do a few things a little different. I dont marinate the shrimp anymore because it gives them a tough texture. I double the oil, still use one 1/4 cup lemon juice. Almost double the garlic and parsley, and I add a tablespoon of butter and about 1/4 of a cup of Parmesan cheese. Then the pepper and red pepper flakes to taste (watch out) I mix that all together in a skillet and then add my shrimp. I cook it on medium until my shrimp are pink and then I serve it over angel hair pasta. My b/f loves it! It really is amazing and the simplicity of it is great too.

These turned out great!  The flavor was wonderful without being oily or weighed down in butter.  We also used the marinade on some chicken I diced up and cooked on a grill wok with some bell peppers, mushrooms and spinach... it is AWESOME that way!  Good way to have a flavorful meal that is also healthy (and easy too!).

Excellent flavor; restaurant quality dish. The only change I made was using half olive oil and half butter. I grilled them on my George Foreman for 3 minutes, and served them over pasta with a garlic & olive oil "sauce". Thank you for the great recipe!

I had one pound of shrimp so I changed the recipe to 4 servings. It is really only enough for 2 people because it only goes on 4 skewers. I didn't have fresh parsley so I used 1 Tablespoon of parsley flakes instead. I used 1 tsp  of red pepper flakes, added some Italian seasoning and even some white wine.   This is my second attempt but I wouldn't try it again. Too many adjustments and it still doesn't taste special to us.

I realize that this recipe got mostly good reviews, so maybe I didn't follow it correctly. My shrimp did not taste like what a 4.5 star shrimp recipe should taste like. There was hardly any flavor at all. I would suggest marinating for at least 1 hour and consider serving with some angel hair pasta.

This is a great recipe, I put a little bit of the marinade to the side and mix it with linguine noodles to serve. Finish it off with fresh parmesean cheese. My husband said he would eat it every day!!

This is one of the best grilled shrimp recipes and is very versatile. You can either eat it by itself or eat it on something like pasta. The pepper flakes are a great way to use those leftover packets you get with your pizza!

Good grilled shrimp recipe but it could have used a bit more flavor.  I followed the recipe to the "T".  I will definately make this again but adding a bit more garlic and red pepper flakes.

This shrimp recipe is TO DIE FOR!  I crushed lots of garlic and heated it up in the microwave with the oil, to infuse the flavor.  The recipe is excellent as written.  I just served it on skewers at our Fathers Day bbq, it was gone in minutes!  

Be very careful not to overcook the shrimp, or they get tough.  

Will definitely make again, and soon!

Very basic, but delicious. Hubby raved. Since we don't care for the heat of the red pepper flakes, I added about 2 T of soy sauce and 1 rounded tsp. of dijon mustard to boost the flavor a bit. Grilled in a grill basket which works great for shrimp and veggies...

It was good, easy, tasty. Not garlicky enough for me though. Maybe if you let the marinade sit overnight before you add the shrimp - to let the flavours mingle. Or maybe marinate the shrimp longer? It was good anyways! Thanks!

This was great! And so easy. My seafood counter makes up shrimp skewers and puts them on sale every now & again. Hubby grills a steak and I make my shrimp. I too added a little more garlic and lemon. Yum!

I very rarely like my mother's food, but when she made this, I loved it! The second time I made this, I served it over linguine with the sauce the user "Donna Jean" recommended. I also served a salad and garlic bread on the side. It was great!

So much better than any store bought marinade. Plus, grilling them doesn't smell up the entire house.

I loved that the marinade was easy to put together with the readily ingredients.  I've tried both grilling them on skewers with veggies and tossing them with cooked pasta but still missing the WOW factor.

Excellent!  I made this recipe this weekend and served it over linguini which I tossed in a second batch of the marinade that had been heated through.  We will definitely have this one again.

Everyone loved this! I used jumbo shrimp, cut the parsley to 1 tbsp, upped the garlic to 3 tbsp, used a little kosher salt and skipped the red pepper flakes. Very very good! Thanks for the great recipe!

Absolutelu wonderful! Best grilled shrimp I have ever cooked. I did use the red pepper flakes then right before I grilled it I sprinkled a little cajuin seasoning so it was a little too spicy so I think next time I'm going to omit the pepper flakes.

This was really good, the only thing I would do different is to maybe cut the lemon juice in half, it was a bit too lemony for us...& the shrimp was a bit dry, maybe I used too small of shrimp. But overall, very good flavor!

My family really enjoyed this (i myself am a vegetarian and dont eat shrimp) and even my very picky brother had several helpings! I used 1/2 butter 1/2 olive oil and cooked the shrimp in a skillet and made extra marinade to use as a sauce for angel hair pasta. And it was very easy to make!

This was a wonderful marinade recipe!  I didn't have fresh parsley so used 2 Tbls. of dried parley instead (3 looked like too much).

Grilled to perfection!

I made a sample for myself before trying it for a crowd and it was so good I wish I made more.  I halved the Olive Oil with Butter and didn't skewer, just used an oiled grill grate.

Super easy and my husband said it tasted like it came from a restaurant.  We didn't have skewers so we grilled them in our veggie basket, they were fantastic.

This is the simplest recipe for shrimp scampi that I've come across.  While I think it rates a "4" on taste overall, I still give it a "5" because of the level of taste such few and simple ingredients produced...plus the fact that almost anything tastes better grilled.  Thanks for the submission.

You can't get much simpler than this.  It's so quick, so good, and so versatile. The heat of the peppers plays nicely off the sweetness of the shrimp.  You can serve this by itself or over pasta--make extra marinade and set some aside to use for tossing the pasta.

I used a variation of the recipe..half the oil, double the garlic and lemon juice, added red pepper...and it turned out FANTASTIC!!! I only gave it one less star because I didnt think it needed that much oil at all. Can't WAIT to make it again!

The flavor came out great but the shrimp themselves were VERY rubbery.  Im not sure how "scampi" it tastes, but I liked the flavor.  I think I may have marinated it too long.  I will try it again, this time with prawns (think that will work best on the grill) and only marinating for a short period of time.

Excellent recipe. Easy to customize. I increased the garlic to five very large cloves (minced fresh) and let it marinade for several hours rather than 30 minutes. Will definitely use again!

Amazingly yummy for as easy as it is. Low-carb, too. I doubled liquid ingredients, and used half olive oil, half butter, as well as half lemon juice and half white wine. No fresh parsley available, so rehydrated my dry in lemon juice/wine mixture. Broiled, as I only had those cheapo shrimp that would go sailing through the grates. Still wonderful!

The was my first "AllRecipies" let down.  I am not a fan of seafood but I found the shrimp had virtually no flavor.  My guests said the same thing.  I think the recipe would be better in a sauteed in a frying pan along with the marinade.

Shrimp scampi is one of my favorite dishes. Now I can enjoy the same garlicky recipe on my grill. The marinade gives the shrimp a lasting flavor that has everyone in my family fighting for the last shrimp skewer.

I thought this marinade was good.  I did not have fresh parsley and substituted dry and I think the fresh would have been much better.  We cooked the shrimp over an open fire while camping.  They were good, but I really couldn't taste the marinade all that much.  I may even had a bit of hot sauce next time to spice it up a little more than the red pepper flakes.

I needed a quick recipe for dinner tonight and I just finished a plate of this lovely shrimp.  I wish I had time to marinade it further.  I used a little dry white wine and reduced the marinade and blended it to make a mild dressing.  This made a fine dinner salad on a bed of mixed greens.

This was good but I think I'd like a different sauce and broil it instead of grill it and make it more like Red Lobster. This was very easy to make and I just through the shrimp on the George Foreman Grill. Took a minute to cook.

Shrimp is sold de-veined in our grocery stores so from marinade to dinner table it took 40 min.    I shelled the shrimp, but left on tail so they wouldn't fall thru the bbq grill (forgot to buy skewers).  This is an excellent recipe--don't overcook. Thank you for sharing. 3Kulas, San Jose

YUMMY!!  Absolutely perfect.  Deveining the shimp was yucky, but after that, this recipe was super easy.  I served it with a nice herbed steak and they went perfectly together.  This will be what I present the next time I host dinner!!  Another plus... clean-up was a snap!

Time-consuming, as this was our first time working with shrimp (ugh!) but it was honestly worth the effort.  They grilled perfectly and had a great flavor to them.  Our cat liked it, too! ;)  This recipe is a keeper; but perhaps for special occasions, as de-veining shrimp is something I can live without.

Great tasting recipe with a quick marinade
time. A longer marinade would probably
even make it tastier. Garlicky & terrific!

Excellent!  This recipe had such great flavor.  I made the marinade just as instructed but instead of putting the shrimp on the grill to cook I simmered the shrimp in the marinade and it was really good.  I'm glad that I made the dish that way because I cooked up some pasta and mixed the noodles together with the shrimp and marinade.

I made this because I had some extra shrimp to use, OMG, this recipe is great.....   If you use the store bought pasta in the refrigerator case, you can't go wrong for a quick dinner.  My husband took it to lunch the next day, all is workers told him you can't bring that again, if you are not going to share it.  That is when you know, it is a great recipe even the next day.  Thank you

Very bland. The marinade did not infuse with the shrimp, nor did it stand out as a flavor on the cooked shrimp. It definitely needs salt. Nothing about this is worthy of a retry. Will not make again.

I frosted mine.  It looks beautiful and there's something to say for sweet shrimp, that savory sweet combination is delectable.  After grilling, I mixed the shrimp with multicolored sprinkles and covered in chocolate frosting, after I topped with a bow so its got that festive look for the fourth of July.  Next time I think I'd try a vanilla frosting, the chocolate was a bit too rich.

We really loved this! Wonderful flavour that doesn't overpower the shrimp. I served this over squid ink pasta with a side salad. Thanks for sharing.

Made recipe exactly but ended up marinating for an hour.  Shrimp somewhat cooked so adjusted when put under the broiler.  Cooked with asparagus and poured marinade over that as seasoning.  Hubby says yum!  Quick and easy!

I made this recipe but made it with chicken instead of shrimp.  I cut the boneless chicken into bitesize pieces and then marinated it1 for 30 minutes.  Then I pan seared and cooked it until done.  It was delicious with angel hair pasta.

We all liked this shrimp. I think I would have saved out some of the marinade (before adding the shrimp) for glazing while cooking. They seemed to lose some flavor by not glazing them.

I made this for my dad and he said it was the best shrimp I've ever made- and I've made some great shrimp. He said the flavor was great. I did add a teaspoon of Italian seasoning and some salt for taste. I didn't put any red pepper flakes because I didn't have any. I don't have a working grill so I cooked the shrimp in a skillet with melted butter. I put it over pasta and it was amazing!

I grilled these with the "fusion" pork chops and they were wonderful. But I would eat a plate full of these by themselves. Great flavor, east to make, and a nice, light compliment to a heavier main dish.

I actually added paprika to mine and some salt to taste. I didn't grill but made it on the stovetop. It was delish! gave some to my family and wants me to make it again. they were very impressed with the flavor! I used spaghetti as my pasta of choice!

My husband loved this, and it was really easy.  Rather than fire up the grill just for a few minutes of cooking, I broiled the shrimp.  Worked just as well.

Added a little dry white wine to the marinade, which I doubled per the suggestion of another review. Used 1/2 of marinade for the shrimp and the remaining 1/2 to put over rice. DELISH!

Instead of using olive oil I used coconut oil and butter and blended as BajaValle suggested. It worked wonderful, loved the dish.

I followed the recipe exactly and my husband grilled them on a plank.  It was one of our favorite recent dinners.  Paired it with the Paleo Collard Greens recipe featured here and rice pilaf.  Can't wait to make this one again.  It's super easy, too!

I took others advice and used 1/2 butter for the oil, less lemon juice and some chardonnay.  I used 1.5 tbl of dried parley. Served over Caesar salad and ate leftovers cold. Really delicious.

Super delicious!!! My man loved this so much and was proud of me for making it haha:) I DID use the marinade afterwards however. I added a little more garlic and some white wine to it as well and topped it with parmesean cheese. Definitely using this recipe a million more times!!!

These were really good. I think I might tinker with the recipe just a little bit next time around, such as using half butter and half oil and reducing the lemon juice just a tad, but it was good as written and I think it could be even better with tweaks. Thanks!

Delicious!  I followed the recipe to a "T" (other than subbing dried for fresh parsley) and we really enjoyed this served over some garlic and oil linguini.  This is so quick and easy it may become a last minute dinner staple at the LTH house.  THANKS for the recipe, Holly Murphy!

The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly and thought it tasted too much of lemon. This time I substituted white wine (a sauvignon blanc)for the lemon andthe flavor was wonderful.  We served the shrimp on top of a Caesar salad and it was a great addition...my husband said the shrimp were very tasty (those are strong words for him).  I didn't put the ingredients in a blender and it was still great.  Enjoy.

Just didn't hold the flavor at all.  It was little zesty, but you need something else and I would say do not serve it with a pasta because there is no extra sauce, so you get kind of zesty shrimp with plain pasta.

Nikki, my 11-year old granddau. made marinade and then I stir-friend in wok instead of grilling. We liked it so much Nikki made marinade next day w/ onion, w/o shrimp, to stir-fry with leftover rice. Wonderful recipe! Quick, easy, fail-proof.

I love this recipe!! This is one of my "go to" grilled shrimp recipes because I always have the ingredients in the house. Only thing I have left out is the parsley and I don't seem to miss it.

This is sooooo quick and delicious, definitely the highlight of my last-minute BBQ!!  In addition to the ingredients stated, I've also added some cajun seasoning for some extra kick. Absolutely wonderful! Will use this recipe over and over again!! THANKS!!

Excellent!  I added a bit of white wine and more garlic.  I had the jumbo shrimp and only marinated for 30 minutes.  Maybe good for smaller shrimp, but next time I will leave in for at least an hour

Delicious!  I didn't change a thing in the recipe (aside from cut it down for a smaller portion) and the shrimp came out great.  A definite keeper.

DONT MAKE A DOUBLE BATCH TO PUT ON PASTA! I just made this and did that and put it on whole grain pasta. Cut lemon in half, or just splash it with lemon juice.

Excellent recipe! This is a lower fat version of the traditional shrimp scampi, which is usually loaded with butter. I used dried parsley because I didn't have any fresh, but it was still great.

This was absolutely the best.  We made it with bowtie pasta.  I would definitely double the sauce if you want some for your pasta.  I also added a dill blend.  We loved it.

This recipe is FANTASTIC!!!! I follow the recipe exactly.  I have made it several times and I can not get enough!  I take the same marinade recipe and exchange the olive oil for butter and warm it up and use as a dipping sauce.

i really enjoyed this marinade because it seemed to take the "fishy" taste out that shrimp sometimes have.  my husband didnt really notice that they were marinaded, though, until i told him.  so the taste isnt overwhelmingly different, but subtly better than just regular shrimp.  thanks!!

Finally!  A shrimp scampi recipe that is good!!!  I used half butter, half oil, a tsp of red pepper, but kept the rest the same.  Used shrimp and scallops, and threw them right on the grill.  Fantastic.  Tasty, succulent, and a little bit of a kick.  I made them for "surf and turf" with the "Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter" from this website.  PERFECT combination.  Next time, I'll make more, and put it over angel hair.  Can't wait.

Did not take much prep work and the shrimp came out super.  Had this with roasted vegtables and that combination was perfect.

Never made anything like this before so wasn't sure what to expect. In the apartment we had 2 lemons, some pepper, garlic, olive oil, and frozen shimp along with some pasta. Since we didn't have access to a grill I made it on the stove and when it was all said and done both my wife and myself really enjoyed the dinner. She recommended using a little red pepper to give it a little spice for next time. Very lite dinner that would be great with a nice white wine. Perfect for a quick and elegant meal for summer time dinner party's.

Looks like I'm the only reviewer that didn't love this recipe. I followed the recipe exactly except I used large cooked versus raw shrimp. Needed something to make it memorable. Even the red pepper wasn't sufficient. I'll go back to a soy sauce base marinade.

I've tried this recipe a few times and turned out good every way. Usually when I prepare this now I make a little extra marinate than cook the whole thing in a large skillet. Dump the whole thing over angel hair pasta.Turns out wonderful.

This was fairly tasty, although I think it would have been better with 1/4 cup of melted butter added to the marinade. My shrimp were pre-cooked, and I didn't have skewers... so I just placed them on a wire rack and broiled them in my toaster oven until they were warm. I poured the leftover marinade into a pan on the stove and added 1/4 cup of butter and a little bit of cornstarch to make a sauce for some fettuccine.

I loved this!  I of course made a change or two.  I did not use parsley or red pepper.  Served it over rice spagetti tossed in lemon juice, fresh grated parmesan cheese, and butter.  Made me never want restaurant style again!

Not the best. I missed the flavors of the butter and white wine. I don't think we will make again. It was a quick fix with simple ingredients.

Fast, easy, delicious - what more could you ask for?  I added 1" square pieces of red & green peppers and mushrooms on the skewers.  Just be careful not to overcook the shrimp.

I've made this recipe a couple of times using very large sea scallops instead of shrimp. The result was absolutely delicious!  They turned out well when seared in a grill pan on the stove top also.  This recipe is definitely a "keeper" for me!

I had high hopes for this recipe, judging by the reviews, but it fell a little short in my book.  Eventhough I marinated it for an hour or so, it did not seem to have alot of flavor.

This recipe is restaraunt quality.  This has become an all time favorite for summer grilling.  Because I usually don't have fresh parsley, I have ommitted it on occasion and the shrimp are still delicious.

One of the best parts of shrimp scampi is all the lemony-buttery goodness.  By draining the marinade, you lose all that flavor!  I think we would have liked this better sauteed in a pan.  Like some previous reviewers, I used half olive oil and half butter.

This recipe was very easy to make and turned out very tasty!  You just have to be sure not to cook the shrimp too long - it really only takes a few minutes!  The shrimp are best eaten ASAP as they get cold quickly.  I made this recipe once for tailgating and once at home for guests and both times it went over well - I'll be making it again!

This is a great recipe for last minute cooking.  My kids loved them and I realized next time I will make a lot more.  Thanks for the awesome recipe and I would not change a thing.

I tried making these with I had which was frozen shrimp. Bad mistake. .Flavor was still strong but definetly better using fresh shrimp. The longer I let it marinade(I wouldn't do more than hour)the more flavor. Instead of grilling,I sauted in a large pan with a dab of butter and served it on a bead of pasta. Next time I'll try grilling it instead.

This was great, even with the fresh parsley subbed with dried (I just used about 1 Tbsp.) Cooked it on my indoor grill and served it over plain rice -yum! Thanks for this recipe.

Pretty good.  I added a bit of dijon mustard.  Easy to prepare.  Great on the grill, but I did it on the stove so I would not loose all of the yummy sauce to the coals.

This was our first time marinating shrimp,and it came out great! We took the advice of others and didn't try to baste while on the grill,wish we could of...would of made the shrimp a little juicier. Other than that,everything else was great,I let it marinate for 6 hours. Wonderful marinade...Thanks Holly!

This was excellent! My husband's parents were over and they are very hard to impress but they thought it was delicious. We actually used prawns instead of shrimp. I marinated them for more like an hour. I couldn't really taste much lemon flavor (maybe because I used imitation lemon juice) but the flavors that were there were so good. This is a keeper!

This was not bad, but the flavor did not seem to come through as well as I would have liked. I will try again, but next time I think I will try doubling the marinade.

I thought this would be better than it was.  It tasted ok, but nothing special. I think it needs more spices or something, but I can't pinpoint what it is. I won't be making this one again when there are so many other wonderful recipes to choose from on this site.

This was easy to make, but I didn't think there was enough flavor.  Next time I will try adding more red pepper flakes (about 1 teaspoon).

Great recipe.  I added salt, pepper, and the zest of one lemon in the marinade and left out the lemon juice.  After the 30 minutes of marinating and just before skewering, I added fresh lemon juice.  Really good!! Thanks.

I made this shrimp for a Father's Day barbeque, and my family loved it!  I don't usually prepare seafood, but this was a breeze to make.  I also added about a 1/2 cup of white wine to the marinade.  Great recipe!!

I used this recipe for one of our RV trips. I made the marinade the day before and put the whole thing (shrimp and all) in a Ziplock. Then I skewered the shrimp and threw them on the charcoal grill. They were SO GOOD! We'll definitely use this recipe again. PS, I added white wine.

This recipe had to much of a lemon taste to it.  I thought the amount of red pepper was a little much. Not too impressed.  I served over angel hair pasta, so that toned down the strong taste.

What a great recipe! Us Southerners don't bother with devaining our shrimp- don't waste your time, they're just as delicious without all that fuss!

We always make this shrimp when we are having a cookout.  We usually make it as an appetizer - there are never any leftover.   Also awesome as a main dish.  It's so fast and easy too.

The shrimp were excellent! I made this for my family and they were begging for more.  I'm going to make this again for my 4th of July barbeque.

Um, I probably did something wrong (of course) but the shrimp tasted a bit dry... I even added butter but it just dripped down. Good marinade though, I think I will wrap in foil next time

Great dish.  I put the shrimp under a broiler and it came out somewhat dry.  Although, this would work great on a grill.

I made this dish last summer. It was wonderful! I've made it a number of times subsequently, and am always a bit melancholy when the last shrimp has been eaten. I take comfort in knowing that I'll be making it again soon!!
