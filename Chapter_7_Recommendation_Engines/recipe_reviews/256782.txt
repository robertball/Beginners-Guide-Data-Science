This was by far the best onion dip we've ever had! Very easy to make! Great for snacking and having people over, will be making this from now on!

I love bourbon. I love dips. You can see where I'm going with this...  this was super easy to prepare and amazing to consume.   The most difficult part of making this was stopping at the liquor store to pick up cheap bourbon I would be willing to part with in a dip. I served this with crackers and sourdough toast points and we found we enjoyed the toast points most. I was hoping for leftovers I could use to make a banging grilled cheese, but our guests saw to it that that didn't happen. This will be an entertaining staple at the LTH house (you have to use up cheap bourbon somehow...). THANKS for the recipe, McCormicks!

I think I would have liked more bourbon flavor, but then again, we're bourbon fiends in this house. As written, it's a really tasty onion dip. I think I might try making it again with the amounts of water and bourbon swapped and see if that gets me the flavor I'm wanting.
