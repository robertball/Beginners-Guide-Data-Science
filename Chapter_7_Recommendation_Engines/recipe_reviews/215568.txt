This is the first recipe I've felt compelled to review.  It is wonderful! I doubled the recipe to use up a watermelon that was past it's prime.  The whole family has really loved this.  I made it without using an ice cream maker.  I just poured the mixture into a metal bowl and popped it into the freezer.  Every couple of hours I whisked it until it was an even texture.  When it reached soft serve consistency, I put it into a a covered container and stored it back in the freezer.  We'll use this recipe as a jumping pad for other fruit sorbets for sure.  I'm envisioning pineapple-coconut, cantaloupe-mint, whatever happens to be in season!  Thanks Terry Wilson for sharing!

I was scared to try this for my daughters first birthday - a watermelon party - because of the lack of ratings. It was fabulous! I was afraid it would be too sweet, but I made it just as suggested and it came out perfect. It's more like sorbet or gelato than ice cream.  Very refreshing! I gave the recipe to several people that requested it.

Great sherbet! I used sugar free raspberry jello and 1/2 c sugar. Also added a tbs vanilla and fat free milk instead of cream to lighten it up. Kids gobbled it up!!!

I was looking for a recipe to use my over ripe watermelon in so I didn't have to waste it, I came across this, it looked simple and the couple reviews it did have were good so I thought why not! So happy I did, this sherbet is amazing! Not only does it taste good but its super simple and quick! My husband who isn't a fan of watermelon also LOVED it! It didn't last long in our house! I have never left a review before but this was too good not to 5stars for sure!!

My husband was given a watermelon however we have no watermelon lovers in our family so it sat on the counter for a few days before I thought...what could I make with it that they might like, so I tried this!  I mixed it all together with an emulsion blender & I did not have an ice cream maker so I put in a metal bowl (like another reviewer) and stirred it once before going to bed.  This afternoon I pulled it out to try not expecting much since I didn't have an ice cream maker and I'm not much of a watermelon lover but OMG this is really good!!! Better than sherbert!

Watermelon is one of my very favorites and this sherbet was great!  The only problem was that it did not freeze well in my ice cream freezer.

Lightened it up by reducing the sugar to 1/2 cup and using half & half in place of heavy cream.  It was still SO GOOD.

YUMMY!  Just made this.  It's still setting in the freezer.  Tasted it after I ran it in the ice cream machine.  Very creamy and very yummy.  I double the recipe except for the sugar.  (I thought two cups was way too much)  Turned out perfect.  Will definitely make this again.

There was a very large watermelon left on my doorstep and I was looking for unique ideas to use it all up. I purchased all ingredients for this recipe and followed the recipes exactly, except I doubled everything. There may have been too much lemon; however, the sherbert was not sour. My kids loved the watermelon, but we did not like the sherbert as well as I hoped we would. It did have a wonderful texture, but I wouldn't know how to change this enough to be comfortable trying it again.

This has such a lovely creamy texture and strong watermelon flavor.

I made a couple of very small changes.  
First, I left the the watermelon, sugar, lemon juice combo sit overnight.  Just because I ran out of time.
Second, because my "seedless" watermelon still had small brown seeds, after I blended it, I ran it through a fine sieve.  
Thirdly, because I just happened to have it, I dissolved the gelatin into 1/4 cup cold pressed watermelon juice, just because I happen to have it on hand.
The results were amazing.

Love this recipe very simple, do not let not having a ice cream maker discourage you from making it. There are many other ways to make it with out one of those. It will just require more work to make it.

I thought it was really good and easy to make!  When I wanted some, I had to let it sit out for a bit, to let it soften.  Being a sherbet it wasn't as creamy as ice cream, but it was delicious and refreshing!

I joined this site just to rate this recipe. It was THAT good.  I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. I was concerned because my watermelon didn't seem that tasty but after the sugar etc, it tasted great. The ingredients really bring out the watermelon taste.  I have a 1.5 quart ice cream maker. I spilled my bowl after beating it and lost some but it didn't matter because this almost overflowed the maker.

this was very good. I think I should have used my food processor to break up the watermelon a bit more - it was a little on the chunky side!
but otherwise a good way to use up the over ripe watermelon.  also when beating with hand mixer it came more frothy than fluffy. this may have been due to the excess juice coming off the watermelon.

I made an account just to review this recipe! It is amazing! I already love watermelon, and we had 4 or 5 sitting around from our garden this year, and I decided to try and make some ice cream out of one of them. I am cooking challenged and it was super easy to make! I LOVE the flavor, it's not too sweet or overwhelming. I double the recipe and even so, it was perfect. I will be making it again and again! I am letting it chill in the freezer after it was in the ice cream maker, but just because i like my ice cream to be a little harder than soft serve. If you like soft serve, it should be perfect right out of the ice cream maker!!

I made it without an ice cream machine. It was great, I stirred it after 45 minutes, than 30 and 30. My only comment beside that it tasted great is that it's a bit on the sweet side, did it like the recipe with cream and 1 cup of sugar. Will reduce the sugar next time....and might add a bit of lemon zest....

I made this yesterday and doubled it because I had a pretty big watermelon. After blending the watermelon, sugar, lemon juice and salt, I strained it through a fine strainer to get any remaining seeds or impurities out. I mixed it well with my hand mixer and since I don't have an ice cream maker, I took it out of the freezer, every 30 to 45 minutes, 5 times and mashed it up. The last time I put it back through my blender and then froze it over night in a covered glass baking dish. This recipe came out perfect!

I used half a watermelon and doubled the recipe. I used powdered dehydrated lime packets instead of lemon juice and used xylitol as the sweetener. Came out great. Delicious.

I followed this recipe to the letter and unfortunately while the flavor was lovely the consistency was not.  It froze very, very hard once it was in the freezer- to the point where I had to stick it in the microwave for a full 90 seconds before I could get a scoop out of the container.  It was not creamy at all.

Fantastic! The watermelon flavor comes though with flying colors! I try to make recipes as presented before any changes and this one is pretty solid. I do agree  with some other reviews the sugar could be cut back  to 1/2 a cup  without hurting anything.

I really liked this but was not sure how to get the mixture "fluffy".  The cream was poured into it straight from the carton.  I wonder if I was supposed to whip that first and then add it.  Oh well, we are enjoying it for an after dinner treat!

With an abundance of watermelons in our garden this year I was scrambling to find a use, or give them away. This fit the bill, now we can enjoy  a very  refreshing treat all year long.  Easy to make and delicious .  Great post!

Thanks for sharing this!  It is lovely, with such a wonderful texture ... pure summer bliss.  This is the best stuff I've gotten out of my ice cream maker without going through the work of cooking a custard and separating eggs, etc. THANK YOU, TerryWilson!  (To another reviewer who didn't like the seeds:  You CAN sieve the original mixture to remove them.  If you rub the sieve or strainer with a wooden spoon/spatula, you'll still get most of the pulp.)

Wow, was this good! It had a ton of watermelon flavor and the lemon gave it a nice tartness. Very refreshing on a hot summer evening. It filled my 1.5 quart ice cream freezer to the brim.

This was amazing!  I have made a few real flops in my icecream maker but this one turned out just as I had hoped.

I made this without an ice cream maker, following another user's suggestion that you whisk it every hour or so while it's in the freezer. That did NOT work for me. The flavor of this sherbet was FANTASTIC, but the texture was horrible - which has to do with not having an ice cream maker. Still, if I had an ice cream maker, I'd definitely make this again.

This is pretty good!  Nice, refreshing, and lighter than ice cream!  My only issue is even our seedless watermelon left small little brownish immature seeds that were barely noticable to the eye but the texture was noticable in the mouth.  We tried to pick them out before blending but it was very tedious.  Can't strain after blending or you'll lose wonderful watermelon pulp. Still very good and worth making! After the spin through the ice cream machine, we put it in the freezer for 2 hours and the consistancy was perfect.
