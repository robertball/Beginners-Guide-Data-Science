These were great!  A nice change from the ordinary.  The only changes I made were cooking my potato cubes in water with chicken base (similar to boullion but in a loose powder).  I did not even add any butter and they didn't need it.  I taste-tested at the end to check for any salt addition, as I had the boullion and ranch mix with salt already in there; they only needed a sprinkle.  They were so whippy light and thank goodness my electric mixer didn't give out until the very end!UPDATE:1/22/06...Since I love the flavor of these I wanted to make again and didn't have sour cream...no problem!  I just omitted it, again did not add any butter and just used the cream cheese and broth liquid from cooking potatoes in.  I grated some fresh romano cheese on top and into the oven...mmmmm, sooo good!  Texture and everything was still superb!

This has been a family favorite for years! Thicker, richer and more flavorful than tradional mashed potatoes,there is no need to measure the ingredients exactly--just add to suit your taste and desired consistency. However, I always use the entire package of the ranch dressing and don't bother with the last step of baking, and it is always perfect.

I wanted to cut back on the carbs a bit and add some veggies, so I did half potatoes and half cauliflower. After I mashed them, I added homemade dry ranch seasoning and 1/4 c. of grated parmesan cheese. This was a hit with everyone, and noone could tell there was cauliflower in it. This dish went really well with my father in law's roast. A+!

I added more of the sour cream and ranch than called for. It was great. I might try just adding premade ranch next time.

Creamy, flavorful mashed potatoes.  I made ahead the day before and added chicken broth because I knew baking would reduce the moisture.  I added cheese the last 10 minutes of baking.  Comfort food!

MMMMMMM...So good! These are definately a comfort food.  I halved the recipe but used double the ranch 1/2 C, and it was just right.  I also skipped the baking and they were still delicious.

This was really good. The only thing off for me was how thick it was. I used 8 oz cream cheese, 8 oz sour cream and about 4 - 8 oz ranch sauce along with 1/3 cup butter AND about 1/4 - 1/2 cup half/half. And I topped it with about a cup of mozzeralla cheese before I baked it. Only after ALL those additions was it a good texture for me. My husband LOVED it and so did I with the changes. Next time, in addition to the ranch dressng I will use a packet of the ranch.

They were the hit at Thansgiving. I did make a couple of changes, I used Red potatoes, I added 2 crushed chicken bouillon cubes and a clove of sauted garlic.

Decadent! Both kids and adults gobbled this up. I didn't have Ranch dressing mix so I just used 1/2 t. each of salt, chives, parsley, dill, pepper, garlic powder and onion powder. I also cut the butter in half. YUM!

I followed this recipe except I substituted 1 1/2 TBS Wildtree Garlic Galore(all natural seasoning with no preseratives, additives, silicone dioxide, etc), rather then the Ranch package.

Delish!, we are not fan of the Ranch dressing mix, therefore was not added to the recipe and turned out pretty good.

Delicious! I've always required gravy for my mashed potatoes, but this recipe was perfect by itself. Omitted the browning, and just served from stovetop.

Absolutely delicious!  I skipped baking these, used an entire package of ranch seasoning and a bit more butter. These go very well with ham, and I'm sure just about any other meats as well. I will use this recipe again. If you love ranch, you must try these :)

These were tasty, but not my most favorite.  They did not have a lot of flavor, despite all the butter, sour cream, cream cheese, and ranch.  How is that even possible???  I added the whole packet of ranch dressing too.  Overall, not bad but not "the" mashed potato recipe worth saving.

I made this recipe Thanksgiving morning to take to our family get together. I used 1 pkg of dry buttermilk ranch and added 1cup of liquid ranch dressing, sprinkled shredded sharp cheddar lightly over the top after putting potato mixture in a 13x9 ceramic baking dish.  Microwaved a whole package of Tyson thick bacon until crisp, crumbled when cooled and sprinkled over entire dish.  No salt or pepper needed.  Family said they knew it was going to be delicious before they even tasted it because you can't go wrong with bacon. Also, I used a potato masher-did not use a mixer at all.  So flavorful, gravy was not a thought!

These were really easy and good.  I made them in the morning and kept them in the fridge until I was ready to put them in the oven for supper. I let them bake about an hour, covered and then topped them with cheddar cheese and baked uncovered another 10 minutes.

I'm thinking that perhaps all the high reviews on this dish are from people who don't regularly make homemade mashed potatoes.  I found these to be way too thick, and not nearly seasoned enough.  I added twice the amount of ranch dressing mix and still the finished dish was way to bland.  I also thought there was too much sour cream resulting in a too sour taste.  I did add cheese on top and would do that again.  I also added *a lot* of milk to get the proper consistency.  Next time I'd either go for triple the ranch dressing, or just add more salt and pepper.  But really, I think next time I'll just make standard homemade mashed potatoes...the ultimate comfort food.

So yummy!  I also added more of the cream cheese and the ranch seasoning.  And I topped the mashed potatoes with pepper jack cheese before putting them in the oven.  My family loved them!

Thanks for this easy, delicious recipe. Per other's suggestions, I also used a full package of ranch dressing and did not bake in the oven.  They were the hit of Thanksgiving dinner!!

I am not sure if the measurements are proportionate per potatoes. I added a little more, plus more butter, some milk, salt & pepper. However, just add ingredients to your taste. My mashed potatoes came out great!

I used this recipe as a base...I dumped butter, cream cheese, sour cream (and then later more sour cream) and ranch salad dressing (in liquid form, not dry mix) in with the potatoes...I ended up dumping some Italian seasoning (dry mix) in as well because I felt it needed more flavour. It did the trick! I mashed with a masher and then used a beater/mixer...it was delicious! No need to really measure as I went by taste.

Normally I do not review recipes, but this is my first.  I used red potatoes and ommitted the sour cream and instead used the leftover broth from using bullion cubes while boiling the potatoes.  Used a artisan mixer by using the flat blade and then switching over to the whisk.  Turned out really fluffy and a great flavor.  I am a red potato fan but this probably tastes great with almost any potato.

These were good but not "incredible". I made them with Lemon soy chops, another recipe from this site and the gravy from that recipe mixed with these potatoes was top-notch! Next time I'll also have to make way less because we hardly made a dent in the bowl it made so much.

These turned out so smooth and creamy. I added 1 cup of pureed cauliflower to about 4 medium sized potatos. Very very good with steaks or chicken.

I opted for a low fat version and used 1/3 less fat cream cheese, light sour cream and I can't bleieve it's not butter light. I also threw 3 garlic cloves in the water with the potatoes and used prepared ranch dressing (probably added all that fat back in - oops). I used the Hidden Valley Spicy Ranch and it came out great. I'll soooo make this again.

Hands down, the best mashed potatoes I've ever eaten. Smooth, light, airy, creamy, and SO flavorful. Don't skip the oven step, whatever you do! It's worth the wait and that's what makes these so fabulous. I followed the recipe exactly to a "T" and I'm glad I did because they were just perfect.

These were absolutely delicious!  I didn’t use the ranch dressing because I didn’t want to compete the the pork loin marinade I used.  I used very little butter and added sea salt because it wasn’t needed.

I just made this recipe for Christmas dinner earlier. It was awesome Amanda! I did tweak it a bit by adding 1 1/2 packages in total of the dry ranch seasoning, adding a touch of salt & pepper, and parsley flakes. I did not bake it. I left it free-standing like normal. I look forward to many more recipes of yours Amanda :).

I was making mashed potatoes the way I saw someone else do it and it never had any flavor it was so bland. This recipe was simple and quick and had a lot of flavor. I skipped baking at the end but used the ingredients mentioned and didn't really measure. It came out great!!! Definitely a keeper!!!

I'm not allowed to use any other recipe. I agree with the other review about eyeballing measurements. A good recipe allows for that and makes it stress-free.

My husband and sons loved this with cheese and bacon bits baked on top!  I forgot to add the ranch dressing seasoning so I'm looking forward to trying it again soon to see which one they like best!

Best potatoes I've had in a long time! I started eating them right out of the bowl before even putting them in the oven.  Even better after they baked.

My family and I really enjoyed this dish. I did use 8oz of cream cheese and a whole packet of ranch seasoning since I used more potatoes. The seasoning was spot on for us. I also added garlic and topped with crumbled bacon and cheese before I put it in the oven. Making them for a barbecue today!!!!

Best mashed potatoes EVER (sorry mom)!! I only did a few edits... I boiled the potatoes in chicken broth and garlic. Used light sour cream and fat free cream cheese. They were still very rich and creamy. We like mashed potatoes lumpy, so I didn't mash it too much. Ranch mix was a good amount and add a little "umph" to the dish. I will be making this for Thanksgiving this year!

I have now made this for the holidays the past 2 years and every time I make them they turn out amazing! I never have a complaint (or leftovers) when I take these anywhere. I've even had many people ask for the recipe. The only thing I change is sometimes I add a little more of the dry ranch but they are always very flavorful and delicious!

I used this recipe to make my first ever batch of mashed potatoes and they we AMAZING.  I read all the reviews first and did a few tricks from all of them.  I used chicken broth to make the potatoes less thick, 2 packs of ranch seasoning.  I also added minced garlic, mozzarella cheese, and boiled the potatoes with 2 chicken bouillon cubes.  My husband has asked me to make them several times now and they may be at this years Thanksgiving!

This was super easy to make and my girlfriend who is a good and better cook than me was over and she was raving about how good it tasted!  I gave it to my six year old niece too and she loved it too!  The only thing I added different was I crumbled potato rippled chips on top to give a ting of salt flavour and crispy texture - everybody loved it!

These were easy to make and tasty - I'll still probably look around for a "restaurant-quality" mashed potato recipe, but for a quick, easy side, these are great.  Also, I would definitely add salt and pepper to taste - even with the ranch, these lack some of the flavor I associate with the best mashed potatoes.

This is Perfect! I've made my own variation of this recipe many times. I would just guess on the amounts / measurments of ingredients. This is perfect. Just the right amount of each flavor. I will always use this recipe from now on. Thanks!

My husband and I loved these potatos. I didnt have ranch dressing mix, so I just used a little of the bottled, and I also didn't have cream cheese so I added milk. I used mozzarella and cheddar cheese. Very good!

Was a great change of pace from regualr mashed potatos. Kids thought they wereok though, otherise would have been 5 stars.Will probably make again. I also added shedded sharp cheddar on top in the last 10 minutes of baking, that really added to flavor.

These potatoes were very good.  The ranch seasoning added a lot to the traditional "twice baked potatoes" recipe.  Like other users recommended, I sprinkled cheese on top during the last 10 minutes of oven baking.

This is my new favorite mashed potatoes recipe! The potatoes had just the right amount of zing. I added about 1-2 teaspoons of boullion granules to the potatoe cooking water. The rest of the recipe, I followed exactly.

These potatoes are great and really easy to make,  even for an unexperienced cook like myself. I added some shredded cheese after about 25 min of baking, it was a tasty addition.

Oh My, these were sooo good. My husband, who will eat anything with ranch dressing on it, loved them too. (Why Didn't I Think Of That?!)Some other recipes are similar except that they call for them being baked after everything is blended together but I just served them as is. The only thing I did diffrent was I added a 1/2 tbsp of chopped parsley (for looks) and mixed that in with everything else. I'd definately make these again. They may even be on my table for the holidays! Loved them, Thank You for the post!

These potatoes were sooo good!  Everyone loved them, even my husband who is not too keen on the ranch flavor.  Not much left over since the kids really loved them.  These will surely be made again!
