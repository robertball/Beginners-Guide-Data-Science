I normally love blue cheese but this recipe was not good at all.  Both my husband and I could not eat more than one bite.  Sorry.

Revised the amount of blue cheese from 1.5 cups to 1/2 cup per the request of the submitter. Also included a note with tips for using different types of grits.

I made this for a dinner party and the first batch was so bad that I threw it out and made another batch with only 1/2 cup blue cheese and 3 cups of liquid, thinking that should be better.  The taste was terrible and I couldn't serve them. Will not try this combination again.

I like blue cheese so I liked them.  I did cut the blue cheese back.  My husband did not like them for a dish but said they tasted like salad dressing.

These are good.  I served them with some stuffed bell peppers and it worked well.

Delicious! I did add a couple of TBS of unsalted butter at the end & it mellowed the sharp cheese flavor. I think Iâ€™ll try fresh crushed garlic next time. A keeper!

I should have cooked my grits a little longer (maybe), they weren't as creamy as I like.  Other than user error they were DELICIOUS!  Went great with my ribeyes off the grill!

I used organic chicken broth to cook polenta then added coconut milk. Also made a few changes since I'm not a fan of Bleu Cheese. My husband who is didn't like the taste when warmed with the warm polenta. I used asiago instead and plenty of it but as a topping.  I also topped it with Argentinian shrimp in a garlic and olive oil/ coconut oil.  Used about 6 large cloves of garlic through a press and a few sprinkles of Paprika. Yum!!
