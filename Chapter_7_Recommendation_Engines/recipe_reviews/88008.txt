These did take a little time to prepare, but since most of the work is done the night before it takes very little time to get them going in the morning. I had the batter ready and had to wait for the griddle to finish heating.
The batter did come out a little thin. I cooked them that way and they turned out fine, if just a little flat. Next time I will start with more cornmeal, probably a quarter cup or more extra.
The cooking time seemed to need to be a little longer than regular pancakes. The first two I made turned out a little doughy. I started leaving them on the griddle for a few extra minutes after they looked done and the rest all came out perfect.
The taste was very good, but I was hoping it would taste a little more like corn bread. The corn flavor was definitely there, but was a little more subtle than I would have liked. This is something that the extra cornmeal will hopefully also help with.

The batter was thin ~ I added an extra 1/4 cup all purpose flour to the batter.  I also decreased the yeast by 1/2 teaspoon.  The overall flavor was bland - even though I added an extra tablespoon of sugar.  I don't think I'll be making these again.

Intriguing taste and texture.  Needed more cornmeal and I liked to top the finished cakes with lots of butter.

This recipe just did not work for me. It includes a two-step preparation, the first of which was straight forward.  I had difficulty correctly executing the second step because the batter was so runny.  The recipe suggests adding more flour to correct any runniness; but my batter required so much flour that resulting pancakes were tasteless.  I love both cornmeal pancakes and yeast-raised pancakes, but this recipe (in my hands) did not successfully meld the two.

Not bad! Definately not your typical box mix. At first the kitchen smelled like a brewery, and then like baking bread.  The 'cakes were filling and had a tiny bit of "mush" inside which was fun.  
We made the batter as directed and needed nothing extra to thicken it. We cooked them on medium heat for less than 8 minutes; I liked them golden brown and they tasted a little burnt when they were dark brown.  Note: When it says let rise in FRIDGE overnight, don't try to leave it on the counter or you will have a mess (we didn't lose much).  Great with maple syrup and/or peanut butter. The dog was begging for more.

Bacon grease! Mom and Nana used to save bacon grease for cooking other things. The combo of these cakes, maple syrup, and bacon grease is heavenly. And it's an excuse to fry up some bacon.

My husband and I loved this recipe, I did alter it a bit based on previous reviews. I decreased the milk to 1.5 cups, I increased the brown sugar to 1/4 cup. In the morning i added a tsp of  vanilla along with other ingredients.
