Okay, does no one else think that 3 cans of diced chile peppers makes this soup waaay too hot?!?!  And I thought I liked my food spicy...apparently not!  Other than that, we really like this recipe.  My changes:  cut down on cumin (to 2 tsps.), added the can of black beans for protein, drained the corn, used 3 8oz. boxes of veggie broth  and 2 cups of water (makes it cheaper to make and you don't notice the difference!).  We also added a squeeze of lemon juice at the end (didn't have any lime), but I will definitely add more lime juice (1/3 cup of fresh squeezed) next time along with less chile peppers!  This has the potential to be a great recipe, though, so I gave it 4 stars.  Loved using the frozen peppers/onions...didn't know that product existed until this recipe!  PS--I made it again using the lime juice and it was great!  Also, substituted 28 oz. can of petite diced tomatoes for the crushed ones and we liked that better, too.  I think we have finally found our veggie tortilla soup recipe!

Love it!  I used 2 T. of cumin, 2 cans of chopped green chiles, 2 14.5 oz. cans of diced tomatoes (one plain, one with sweet onion), a 32 oz. container of organic vegetable broth and 14 oz. of water with 2 vegetable bouillon cubes, one can of black beans, and about 1/4 of a bag of frozen Trader Joe's roasted corn.  Everyone loved it and my husband had some at 10 pm because he couldn't get the taste out of his head.  Great as is, but when you serve it with Chile Lime Tortilla Chips and the avocado and cheese, it takes it to a whole new level.  Thanks for a great recipe!

(*UPDATED 11/26/11*: This is by far the best recipe I've ever made. It continues to be my most popular recipe and receives raves from all who try it, and is my standby for pot luck suppers and dinner parties. It is incredibly forgiving and always scrumptious!) I've been craving vegetarian tortilla soup for almost a year now....and I found it! The soup really is so simple and DELICIOUS! The cumin is key to the authentic tortilla soup flavor. I added some chopped fresh mushrooms (just because) at the last five minutes with the corn, and I added a rinsed & drained can of black beans as well. I also topped it with a healthy squeeze of lime and some chopped fresh cilantro before serving. Thanks for the recipe!

I love this recipe and have made (and frozen) it several times. I use vegetarian chicken stock for a little more flavor and saut√© up fresh bell peppers (usually 2 reds and one orange) along with onions, instead of using the frozen stir fry mix. I always top with chopped avocado, fresh cilantro and a squeeze of lime.

It freezes so well and the flavor is even better reheated.

This was fantastic! A very forgiving and versatile recipe. I used fresh peppers and onions instead of frozen, and substituted frozen corn for canned, tomato sauce for the crushed tomatoes.  I also added black beans and a little cayenne. I used an immersion blender to puree some of the soup, leaving a few chunks, and added about 1/4 cup of fresh lime juice at the end.  Next time I may throw in some diced zucchini and tofu as well.

We liked this soup alot. I do reccomend using less cumin though - we used half as much and it was plenty I think more might have blotted out the flavors of everything else. We also used only 1 can of peppers - 2 might have been ok but again I think three would have been too much. I like that this is a very quick meal and it tastes wonderful. Next time I'm going to try using pan toasted tortillas  - instead of chips - to cut down on the salt and fat. Will also add black beans next time and maybe some chicken for the non-vegetarian in the household.

YUM!  This soup is so good!  I used fire roasted green chilies and added a can of black beans.  I topped it with cheese, tortilla chips, avocado, green onions and a squeeze of lime. 

Definitely a keeper!

This is one of those perfect recipes-  You don't have to follow it exactly and you can do lots of different things with it- and it will still satisfy you and everyone who came over to eat Tortilla soup.

I made this for a Friday night soup dinner during Lent.  It was a hit!  Not a drop left, and I was asked for the recipe by all who tried it.  I followed recipe exactly adding only rosemary, oregano, a dash of hot sauce, and a half stick of butter.  Delicious! Will definitely make again!

Changes I made: Cut back cumin to 1 tbsp, cut back green chiles to 2 cans.  Substituted diced tomatoes instead of crushed, substituted Mexican cheese blend (Kraft's Mexican blend with cheddar, monterery Jack, asadero and queso blanco cheese) instead of plain cheddar, also had torilla chips served on top of the soup instead. Added 1 can black beans (partially drained), added 1/2 cup lime juice, and added 1/3 cup of chopped fresh cilantro  just before serving, and had guests top their bowls with a dollop of sour cream. It was sooo delicious! I loved the blend of flavors, especially the crunchiness of the chips, with the smoothness of the avocado. Served at a soup party where everyone brought their own homemade soup, and this soup got the most compliments and recipe requests. Can't wait to have the leftovers tonight!

I made this soup vegan and while it is good it seemed to be lacking something.  I used fresh peppers, two red and one orange, and a fresh onion.  I think I may try roasting the peppers and maybe adding a little chili powder.  I'm thinking stewed Mexican tomatoes blended up would be better than crushed tomatoes.  I also put in one can of black beans, it would even be good with two.  So its definitely worth your time to make (its very simple) and then you can modify to your tastes.

I've come back two days later to add to my review.  This soup definitely tasted better the next day, and I also pureed the rest in the blender and liked it even better!  I ate without any tortilla's and it was delicious!

First off, I didn't use this recipe as a guide because I was necessarily looking for a vegetarian dish... I was looking for ingredients I preferred, and this one happened to fit the bill! I kept hte recipe very close, and used only basic substitutions- such as: subbed chicken stock for the veggie stock, used fresh veggies instead of frozen, used petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed... basic stuff. I did add a can of black beans for Protein, 2 more cloves of garlic, and I added a good bit of dried cilantro, because I love the flavor. I kept the Cumin amount the same, and did not find the Cumin to be too much. Alot of reviewers also mentioned the green chilies being too much, and that they cut back in fear of it being too spicy or overwhelming. I disagree, and am SO glad I did not cut the amount of green chilies. It's where the bulk of the flavor comes from, and it was not too spicy in my opinion. My 3 year old daughter even ate every bite, with no complaint about being spicy. Just make sure you are using the 3 TINY cans at 4 oz each or equivalent. I did bake my own tortilla strips in my oven with salt and cilantro intead of store bought chips for the top, and topped it with Cheese and Avocado slices. It was really good, really easy, and makes a ton! Will definitely be making this again the same way!

This is one of my favorite quick soups. I use organic vegetable broth, add in more garlic and I'll usually throw in some chopped peppers. I also throw in some ground coriander, dried mexican oregano and some red pepper flake for more "oomph". NOTE: I do NOT use three cans of mild green chilies--one is plenty.

Absolutely DELICIOUS for both vegetarians and non!  When I changed my diet to vegetarian, there were a few things I thought I'd miss and one of them is a chicken tortilla soup from this site.  NOT anymore!  In fact, this is BETTER than the 'other' soup!  Don't skip the avocado - the creamy coolness of it in the hot soup is awesome!  I too added black beans and made this with fresh onions.  This was also very easy to adapt for the slowcooker - throw it all in and cook on low all day!  YUM!

The toppings really make this soup!  

I used fresh onion and red bell pepper.  I used only 3/4 of the called for vegetable broth and added 28 oz of spicy enchilada sauce.  That was an awesome addition and it really thickened it up!  Because I did that, I only used 1 tbsp of cumin.  I also added a can of black beans.

For toppings, you HAVE to squeeze a lime wedge into each bowl, it totally changes the flavor in a great way!  Then I added avocado, fresh chopped cilantro, cheese, and sour cream.  I used organic blue corn tortilla chips.  Like I said, the toppings are what really made this a standout dish.

I definitely played with the recipe and I would highly suggest you do the same!  Overall, this was a great base recipe for me to work with.

We love this soup.  We enjoy all kinds of Mexican, spicy food.  I made this on Christmas day as our vegetarian contribution after a day of cross country skiing in Montana - I used fresh chopped onions and peppers, NSA chopped tomatoes, and a combination of low or reduced sodium veggie broth and some homemade broth.  I added no extra salt - the blue chips on the bottom and the cheese were plenty.  A freshly chopped ripe avocado on top was the sweet, smooth touch we all enjoyed!  Yummy!  Thanks so much for the recipe!  We didn't have margaritas that night, but what a wonderful addition they or some Mexican beers would be!  Enjoy!

Great recipe!  Added drained black beans, used only 2 cans of chiles and served over brown rice topped with a squeeze of lime and quacamole and it is just like Qdoba's gumbo!  Excellent and good protein for vegetarian's

Oh my word - this soup was really amazing.  Based on comments, I did cut the number of cans of chiles to 2.  But the chiles were a wonderful and important part of the flavor - I wouldn't cut it any more than that.  With a bit of cheddar cheese, tortilla chips, and a generous sprinkling of avocado, this soup was a vegetarian dream.

We made a few modifications

We used fresh onions (1) and peppers (2 red, 1 orange), fresh chile peppers (1 red, 1 green), and fresh tomatoes (3) rather than the canned/frozen ingredients listed. We also added a little cayenne. 

Excellent!

Absolutely delicious! After reading the other reviews, I came up with the following: cut down to 2 tablespoons cumin (also added a heaping 1/4 tsp of chili powder and paprika), cut down to 2 cans green chili peppers, substituted frozen corn, added a can of drained and rinsed black beans and some finely chopped tofu for protein and, finally, additionaly topped with squeeze of lime and fresh cilantro. Seriously good - and a huge crowd pleaser - non-vegetarians didn't even notice the lack of meat.

Tweaked this recipe a lot, but took the basic idea. It was awesome! I used dry pintos soaked overnight, 1/4 cup of taco seasoning in place of most of the spices, a tablespoon each of dried oregano and dried parsley, 5/6 cloves of garlic instead of 2, chopped jalapenos instead of green chilies, water with buillon cubes instead of broth, fresh chopped green pepper, and a little frozen mexi-mix of veggies with broccoli. I slow cooked this for ~3.5 hours on high and then set up a kind of taco bar for everyone with bowls of sour cream, cheddar cheese, home-baked tortilla chips, mexican style rice, sweet onions, cubed avocado with lemon juice, salsa, and browned ground beef for the meat-lovers. I managed to feed 15 people with the ingredients I had on hand. I will definitely make this again when I need to get rid of ingredients. I will definitely give props to this recipe for the idea and the mode of execution, as well as all the helpful reviews. It was quite delicious!

Great soup!  I made it with the chips, and it was good, but I also made it with dumplings, and it was better!

mexican dumplings:
1/3 cup mesa harina
3.5 tbsp water
a tsp of olive oil
salt and pepper
mix till it binds to a dry soft dough ball, break into ~25 marble sized dumplings and add at the same time as the corn.  

I also added some carrot and celery to the onion/pepper, and garbanzo beans to the corn and it was great!

i made this recipe for a going away party and it was a hit!  I put blue corn chips in the bottom of the bowl, then ladled on the soup, then topped with grated cheddar cheese and sour cream.  Delicious!  Easy to prepare and easy to shop for!  I will make this again.. probably next time frying up my own tortilla crisps since also are quite easy.  yum!

This recipe is great!  I did make changes...I used all vegies called for fresh and not frozen or canned, threw in about a cup of fresh salsa, omitted corn and added a can of black beans.  I also reduced cumin to two tablespoons.  Instead of waiting until the end to garnish soup with tortilla chips, I added them at the begining of cooking as the chips will break down and thicken the soup.  After ladeling my vegetarian portions out, I added some cooked cubed chicken for meat eating family.

I don't usually rate recipes, but this seriously was SUPERB. As with a few others, I sauted fresh bell peppers and onions rather than using frozen and added a can of black beans. I bought some corn tortillas and fried them quick in oil (yea, not so healthy, but sooo good) and I grow cilantro so tossed that, the toasted corn tortilla slices and some sour cream on top and it was delish. The only thing I may change next time is to add some water, maybe 3 cans veggie broth, 1 can water as it was a little tiny bit salty, but not overly salty (for me at least, but I like salt) So, all in all, great recipe! Thank you!!!! :)

This was so good!  I recently became a vegetarian, and I was craving tortilla soup that didn't have chicken in it and so I thought I would try this recipe.  Like others, I used only 2T of cumin.  Instead of the 3 cans of chili peppers, I used two cans of rotel with lime and cilantro.  I also added a can of black beans along with the corn to add some protein.  It came out a little spicy-hot with the two cans of rotel, so maybe one would be better for people who don't want it so hot.  We loved it though, and I'll definitely be making this again and again.  Thanks for posting this!

Great Soup! I use one onion and one pepper in place of the stir-fry mix -  makes the vegetables less mushy.

This recipe was awesome, very flavorful.  I didn't have the canned chilies so I substituted 2 seeded and chopped Anaheim chilies (fresh)and instead of the 28 oz can of tomatoes, I used one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and 1 can of Rotel.  I used a quart carton of vegetable broth and and a couple of cups of water.  Also threw in two veggie boullion cubes

I also used two large fresh onions and about a cup and a half of chopped fresh red and green bell pepper instead of the frozen mix.  I bought a bag of that frozen stuff once and it seemed to leavea bland taste to the dishes I made with it.  

I cut the cumin in half and was plenty of flavor, but I also added a teaspoon of ancho powder.  I used some fresh corn that I had in the fridge and needed to use up. Instead of bagged tortilla chips, which I didn't have on hand at the time, I cut some corn tortillas into 1/4" wide strips and deep fried.  I topped with quacamole, a bit of cilantro and squeezed a bit of lime and it was really good.
Next time I am going to try adding hominy (pazole) instead of corn and see how that works.  I am vegan so I of course omitted the cheese.  Was great without it.

Made my own version of Qdoba's gumbo.  Some brown rice, topped with black beans and the soup over that.  Topped with the fried tortilla strips and quacamole.  Vegan comfort food!!

I liked the idea of this recipe, but it definitely needed some tweeking.  Originally I was going to follow the recipe exactly as it was, but then decided to cut back on the cumin and add more garlic.  I gave it a taste and it was pretty bland, so I added cilantro, paprika, chili powder, garlic powder and a few dashes of hot sauce.  I also decided to add in some cooked spanish rice at the last minute.  I ladeled it into bowls, stirred in sour cream and topped with cheddar cheese.  I added broken up lime flavored tortilla chips as needed so they wouldn't get soggy.  My boyfriend an I both thought the soup turned out great and will probably make it again.  I would give the recipe 4 stars with the adjustments I made.

This is really good, but lacks protein. The main flavor comes from the extras that are added to the soup as toppings.

Loved, loved, loved this soup. It was a hit with myself, my husband and our 3 boys. I planned on only using 1 can of of the chile peppers, but accidentally bought diced jalapenos. The 1 can of diced jalapenos was plenty spicy for my crew. I plan on making it with the chile peppers next time. I also followed some other reviewers advice and cut down on the cumin; only used 2 tsp. We garnished ours with the avocado and cheddar cheese as the recipe suggested, but we also added some fresh squeezed lime juice, cilantro and sour cream. So yummy!! This is one of the best soups I've ever had.

Very Excellent Recipe it is a keeper. I love spicy food so I added a can of diced tomatoes with habaneros in addition to the crushed tomatoes. I also added another can of corn (drained) and Morning Star Veggie Chicken Strips. The kids loved it. I topped mine with cilantro and lime in addition to the other ingredients.

Very good.  Very easy.  

I'm a vegetarian and find that Tortilla Soup is always made with chicken.  I was really pleased to find this recipe.

I've recently discovered Qdoba.  They have a "mexican gumbo" that's made with Tortilla Soup.  It's fabulous.

So I made the recipe here and then assembled it as they do:

- scoop of cooked rice
- scoop of black beans
- scoop of tortilla soup
- top with cheese, cilantro and sour cream

Really Good!  Thanks so much for the recipe.

Modifications:  I used fresh onion (1 large onion) and bell pepper (1-1/2 peppers), 2 cans of broth with 3 c. water and Knorr Veggie Boullion.

This soup was very good. I added meat because it was the main dish and a can of hot chile beans. I also added chile powder and backed off on the cumin to 2 tsp.

So easy, and yet sooooo tasty! Wow! This is one of those recipes you can just keep the ingredients on hand in case company unexpectedly drops by...delicious, impressive dinner in about an hour! I omitted the corn (don't like the texture) and added cayenne pepper (we like it spicy!). In fact, our company gobbled it up last night, and we wanted leftovers, so batch number 2 is on the stove now! This will be a regular in our kitchen!

This soup is excellent. I added black beans and sliced olives. Make sure to use the juice from the corn. I didnt use it all because I thought it would be to brothy, but it wasnt. This is a great soup!!

Thanks for this recipe.  This turned out great!  I too made a few modifications: used fresh vegetables, added a jalepeno, used extra garlic, added a pinch each of cayenne and paprika, and used jack cheese.  I have never made this type of soup before and I was really impressed. The avocados make a perfect addition.  Thanks again!

I have never eaten any version of Tortilla Soup. I made it tonight for my Mom, brother and future sis-in-law. The recipe makes 12 servings, but after all the second helpings, there were only a few small servings left. You have to try this! LOVED the recipe. Mom and I need protein in each meal so I did add rinsed black beans.

My husband and I recently started to eat more vegetarian meals and after running accross this I thought I would give it a try. After loving chicken tortilla soup for years I was not too sure about this one. We loved it! I added black beans, only used 1 TBS of cumin and added a 1 TBS of Ancho Chili spice instead. I used it as a crock pot meal and was able to omit the oil. Also, we added fresh cilantro and lime in addition to the avacado at the end. Already making it for a second time tonight!

We thought this was delicious. I changed it a bit just because I can tell it could be salty, so my changes are as follows.
1 14 oz can of diced tomatos (no salt)
1 14 oz can of diced tomatoes with chilies
2 4 oz chopped green chile peppers
1 vegetable broth cube which is the equal to 2 cups of soup
no added salt and pepper to taste-I wouldn't add salt and pepper until the soup is almost done anyway and we didn't need it.
mexicali corn
Black Beans rinsed
Quorn chicken tenders (not vegan but vegetarian)
We used Snyders tortilla chips because they are lower in fat and low fat cheese.  It really was flavored perfectly this way.

This soup will be in my rotation of favorite recipes. It's very simple and tastes fabulous. A few alterations are necessary to make this five stars, however. Like many have mentioned, adding black beans for some protein is delicious and nutritious. I preferred using a fresh red onion and fresh red and yellow bell pepper for a nice splash of color opposed to frozen stir fry package. Reduce the amount of cumin (only 2 tablespoons at the most) and one or 2 more cloves of garlic. When you add the cheese and avocado it is a nice burst of flavor to add some fresh, chopped cilantro as well as fresh squeezed lime juice. A very flavorful and filling dish, everyone enjoyed thoroughly!

Liked this recipe a lot. Even my 3 year old liked it. I did cut down on the cumin (2 Tbsp.) and used an immersion blender to make it smoother. I also added a cup of sour cream with the corn. Then just a splash of fresh lime juice. Simply lovely. Reheats well too!

This soup is so good. I made half the recipe and only used 1tbls cumin and 1 can of chile peppers. I also browned some fake chicken to throw in it. It was fantastic. I am freezing the rest to eat later and I already look forward to it

Yummy Soup!  Even the kids loved it.  I did read reviews and made a few changes.  The next day, I got a rotisserie chicken from the market and added chicken pieces....even better!!  Thank you!

Great versatile recipe - will take whatever leftover veggies you have on hand. I like to add beans and either collards or spinach to boost the nutrition and get more servings out of the pot. You can do half stock half water and not notice a difference, and the soup stands up well without the high calorie toppings.

This was perfect for a cold evening meal. I made this soup on Halloween night not only because of our long going family tradition of " Meatless Monday" but I needed something quick before sending my little monster out to trick or treat. I used fresh bell peppers and onions rather then the frozen that was recommended and some finely chopped garlic. I didn't have any vegetable broth on hand, but I did have vegetable bullion cubes that I dissolved in hot water and I used one 7oz can of the green chilies instead of the 3- 4oz cans in the recipe.  Rather then using store bought chips, I had some tortillas on hand, cut them into strips and fried in canola oil serving them on the side with the diced avocado and some sour cream. Plan on making again in the future, but with other changes, such as canned veggie broth or homemade and will puree some of the soup to make slightly thicker

Wonderful taste. I sauteed fresh bell peppers, garlic and onion rather than using frozen and as others did, added two cans of black beans. I also used a can of Rotel Diced Tomato With Green chilies instead of the plain crushed tomatoes and then added an additional can (or two depending on your liking) of green chilies. I have made it a couple times and the last time I made it I added a new twist. I cooked a package of Vigo brand Mexican rice and at the time I added the corn I also added the rice. It's a nice little change and makes it more into a one dish dinner rather than a soup. All in all; I love the base recipe and love that you can play around with it and it always turns out leaving little to no left overs.

This soup is a fantastic vegetarian option that meat eaters will love too. We ate it everyday until it was gone, sometimes multiple times a day because it's so good. All the flavors just come together beautifully, and when you add the taco chips, cheese and avocado to the very tasty soup base, it's simply wonderful. Highly recommended!

I found it too hot--add canned chilis slowly!
I used canned petitie tomatoes with green chilis added, and didn't add any additional chilis.
Fresh veggies a better choice than frozen.
Tasty!!

Delicious! I used fresh peppers and onions, frozen corn, and added a can of black beans, and used one can of diced tomatoes with chiles instead of the three cans of chile peppers. It was so good and I'll definitely make it again!

This was great! It was a little watery for me so I pureed it right before it came time to serve. Also, I couldn't find that onion/pepper stir fry mix so I just sauteed chopped onions and bell peppers, and it was still great. I loved it and can't wait to try it again with a few different ingredients.

SOOO good! I would have given it the full 5 stars but it was way too spicy (and I only added a 7 ounce can of green chilis). I would recommend one 4 ounce can of green chilis and about 2 -2 1/2 T of cumin. I also crushed up some tortilla chips and added them at the very end because I like my tortilla soup to be thick. I topped it with lime, cheese and sour cream (to help with the spiciness).

This one is definitely a keeper!  Being the only vegetarian in the family  it is very difficult to find recipes that my husband and I both love, but this one accomplished that.  Very hearty meal.  I did add a can of black beans.

Wow! This is a hit and I take it everywhere. Some healthy and lower grain/higher protein options that I have used very successfully include substituting two cans of black or pinto beans for the corn, or a lb of ground turkey; both very tasty. I have also boosted the veggie content by adding finely chopped greens (you can add a ton, they cook down to almost nothing), or finely chopped cabbage ~10 min before serving. This is a great way to get in leafy greens if you don't especially like them- you can't even taste them.

This recipe is great!  The only thing that I changed is that I added 28 oz. kidney beans (drained).  My company tonight loved it and asked for the recipe.  It wasn't too spicy---just the right ingredients.

Making and eating this soup was a religious experience. Seriously. I made it for about a hundred people (set the recipe to 60) at a church potluck and got rave reviews. I didn't use any green chile, though. However, I did add a couple fresh chopped jalepenoes and chopped cilantro. Absol

I did what other suggested: Used fresh peppers and onions instead of frozen, used 2 TBS of cumin, used fresh corn kernals off the cob, added 1 can of black beans, used ALymer's diced tomato with spices instead of using canned greened chilies.  I also added chili and lime tortilla chips, 1 Tbs fresh lime juice and 1 tsp chopped cilantro to each bowl, when serving.  Thanks for a delicious and simple recipe!

With a few modifications this soup turned out FANTASTIC!  I made the soup for a group of 50, following the directions exactly until the end when I adjusted it to taste the way I wanted it to. I ended up removing it from heat and pureeing in batches in a food processor.  I return to the pot and added tomato paste until it was as thick as I wanted. Then I let it simmer for another 30 minutes.  I also increased the cumin by almost 50%.  SO GOOD!

I only made half a batch, and now I wish I'd made the whole batch.... there was a small fight about who got the one leftover serving.  I didn't add the broth, but put in a extra can of diced tomatoes and some water.  I also used fresh onions and peppers and frozen corn, and used Fritos corn chips. Next time, I'll probably add black beans.  Thanks for the great recipe!

Very good soup! I added black beans, too. Also added some jalapenos and lots of additional spices (onion powder, garlic powder, paprika, chili powder & cayenne). Followed the other ratings & added cilantro as well. Topped with sliced avocado as well as the cheese & chips. The end result was WOW!

i absolutely love this recipe!
However, I do a couple slight variations that make this soup taste just as wonderful.
Instead of using diced or crushed tomatoes, I use a 15 oz. can of tomato sauce.  I also omit the avacado at the end and add a dollop of sour cream on top before serving.  Delish!!

Good soup to start with, and much better after it had been left to sit in the freezer for a couple days.  We reheated and had some just today.  I added a can of black beans as other reviewers had suggested, and just today put in additional pinto beans that were on hand.  We also prefer putting tortilla chips on the top and whilst eating, so that you get the added crunchiness in additional to the tortilla taste.

This was delicious. I changed a few things around: I used a large fresh onion and added 2 roasted red pepppers, used 2 Tb. of chili powder, 4 cloves of garlic, a can of black beans, and instead of diced tomatoes I used stewed Mexican tomatoes. This upped the punch just enough to make this a new standard of mine! The roasted peppers especially provide more depth of flavor.

Delicious! Served it for guests and it got rave reviews! I added a can of black beans for some substance. The avocado is so delicious as a garnish!

I added a can of black beans to this as one of the other reviewers suggested.  I also have a picky 6 year old who does not like vegetables.  When I saw how chunky it was I decided to try blending smooth.  It was actually delicious that way and he had no clue that it was all veggies!  My whole family loved it.

We served this soup at our church's soup supper.  Everyone loved it and asked for the recipe (always a good sign!).  It was very easy to make, too!

This was pretty good - but I made lots of substitutions as I didn't have everything on hand - used 3 diced onions, 2 diced red peppers and 2 diced yellow peppers instead of frozen mix, added 1 tbsp paprika as others suggested, added hot pepper sauce, juice of 3 limes (stirred in at end) and a can of black beans added same time as corn.  Really enjoyed it.

Very nice.  I added a bit of paprika and cayenne, like a previous reviewer.  The only thing I wish I had done differently is to break apart the tortilla chips (or use tortilla strips) .

i'd never been able to find a vegetarian tortilla soup recipe before - this was great! i was going to use fresh vegetables, but because peppers are so expensive right now, i used the frozen ones as in the recipe and it was still delicious! i added a jalapeno with the garlic and put fresh cilantro, sour cream, a little lime, and jack cheese on top in addition to the avacado. my husband and i both loved it.

Seriously good!    How can you argue with over 500 reviews (mostly good).  Seriously forgiving recipe.   Like all recipes, some will not like it.  
I made some small changes to tailor it to my taste.  I love the coolness of the avocado playing off the spiciness of the soup. 
I did add some vegetarian "chicken" to a serving on the second day and it was pretty good,  but I prefer it without.   
My carnivore hubby liked it too,  but he's pretty easy.

With a few changes I thought this was absolutely delicious! I used fresh bell peppers, Serrano peppers and onion instead of frozen. I cut down the cumin to about a teaspoon. Added black beans and cilantro and topped with mozzarella instead of cheddar. I also liked that you don't have to be so exact on the measurements. Just tweaked it to taste and it came out wonderfully and it was really easy to make. Will def make this again.

Delicious and a hit with my picky meat eating husband. We ate it 2 night in a row but definitely modified to the recommendations of diva mommy. 
We topped it with lime tortilla chips sour cream cheddar cheese and avocado

Yum Yum Yummy!  I didn't intend to make changes but my pantry wasn't as stocked as I thought.  I used Mexican style Diced Tomatoes with Chiles since I was out of diced chiles.  I used some frozen green pepper as my fresh green pepper was spoiled when I took it out of the vegetable bin.  I used half of bag of frozen corn since I don't care for canned and last but not least, I used 2 TBS of Better than Bouillon Vegetable base instead of the Vegetable broth.  Even with all the changes, this was fab-u-lous!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I didn't find any vegetable stock in my local stores, so I made my own by boiling one stalk of celery with two carrots and any other fresh veggies I had in the frig, adding salt and pepper. It was amazing! Better than the Crock Pot Chicken Tortilla soup I had been making. I have also combined the recipes and again amazing! To accommodate my friends who are Vegan I simply cooked the chicken separately in some enchilada sauce and added it to individual bowls. It's so easy to make and delicious.

Remember to pour the soup over the top of the tortilla chips - YUM!  We served with a dollop of non-fat Greek yogurt to add a bit of protein as well as a creamy consistency.  Delicious!

This soup was delicious. I made it very similar to the actual recipe, the only change I made was that I only added 12oz of the green chilis. Three giant cans was way too much, my stomach cannot handle too spicy of foods. It was very tastly, and easy to make.

Very tasty but calls for a bit much cumin. I think I'll cut that by at least a 3rd next time. It did mellow over the few days I had it in the fridge, but the first serving was a bit YOWZA!

I made this over the weekend and it was great! I had fresh bell peppers and onions, so I used those. I only put in two cans of green chilies and two tbs of cumin and also added two cans of black beans. But I knew I needed to hide the peppers from my kids, so towards the end, before adding the corn and black beans, I scooped out the peppers and a bit of the soup and blended them in the blender with a handful or two of tortilla chips to thicken it a little. I stirred that back into the rest of the soup and everyone loved it! Thanks for the recipe and reviews.

Very good recipe! I did make a couple changes. I added one can of rinsed black beans, used only one can of green chilies and two cans of crushed tomatoes. Loved the idea of using frozen pepper and onion stir fry! Took no time to put together....easy and quick meal when pressed for time! Yummy! Will make again and again.

Absolutely loved this!!  Was very easy to follow, we thought it was extremely flavorful & delicious & a cozy treat for these cold snowy days!  The first time I made this I followed the recipe exactly & it was perfect! The second time just for fun though I did add two cans of drained and rinsed black beans for extra fiber and protein, also added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes and used diced fire-roasted green chillies instead of the plain ones. This recipe allows you to get creative if you choose though if you stick to the original you will also be very pleased indeed, it is foolproof! So easy to make and filled the house with the most heavenly aroma, I loved the fresh avocado added when serving, though my husband skipped that part and still raved about it!  Definitely a keeper and I look forward to sharing it with others & making it often!  A+ Gold Star!!! Thank you so much!!

I LOVED this soup. It was tortally good-- get it? No? Okay... well, I added some black beans for some extra protein and flavor, since this was the main course. I love this dish! The leftovers tasted even better the next day, too.

Holy moly! This soup was AMAZIN! and it served my husband and I dinner and lunch for 2 days!  I cut the cumin in 1/2 and used fresh veggies and two cartons of chicken stock.  I turned out perfect! I also added some sour cream on top! Still made it somewhat low calori!

This soup is the best! Everyone I serve it to Loves it and it's an easy soup to assemble. I use 2 cans of chiles and add some fresh saut√©ed onion. I don't think 3 tbsp of cumin is too much- taste is good that way! Don't skip the avocado either- it's worth it!

Really good, although I had to make adjustments for the ingredients I had on hand. I didn't have the pepper and onion mix, so instead I sliced up carrots and chopped a tiny bit of onion I had leftover. Instead of chile peppers, I added banana pepper rings, and a generous serving of hot sauce. I omitted the corn (don't like it) and the salt. The end result was sooo tasty! Mine came out rather thick for some reason (like a stew consistency), but it was still great. Thanks for the recipe!

This is excellent.  I added one zucchini, only 2 jars of chilis, 2 cans of vegetable broth and 1 can of water and then frozen corn.  When serving I added a little lime juice, chopped avocado and lime flavored tortilla chips

This was very easy and tasty; I cut the recipe in half and followed other reviewers' suggestions and added a can of rinsed and drained black beans, and used Trader Joe's frozen roasted corn. The next time I make it I will add more garlic and some chili powder, and float the tortillas on top then sprinkle with cheese like restaurants do to avoid the 'cheese glue' effect I got.

Delicious.  I added a can of black beans with the juice and omitted one cup of vegetable broth to make it more like a stew.  I also used two cans of hot rotel tomatoes and omitted the green chile peppers.  Actually, I forgot to buy them, so I improvised.

Excellent Soup. As many reviewers have said,cut down on the cumin and green chillies and add corn, black beans and fake chicken pieces. Very tasty

Love the soup.  I added a can of black beans and an additional 15 oz. can of crushed tomatoes.  Made the soup more filling.

flavor was pretty good, I added some hot sauce and extra seasonings to give it a bit more flavor. I didn't like the frozen vegetable at all. :-( Next time I'll have to use fresh ones. Otherwise I think it would be a great recipe!

I love this recipe...no one ever really realizes that it is vegetarian. I don't do the stir fried frozen pepper part, instead I roast 3 yellow, red, or green bell peppers and then puree them.  We like it pretty spicy, so I puree a 7 oz can of jalepenos and a 4 oz. can of green chiles. I add one can of drained rinsed black beans and one of pinto beans. I use about 1/2 tsp. of hot mexican chili powder and a 1/2 tsp of cumin in place of the 3 Tbls. of cumin, and I put 3 corn tortillas in it. I put it all in the crock pot and let it slow cook all day.

I added 1 can of black beans, decreased chili peppers to 2 cans and decreased cumin to 2 T.  After it was all cooked and I ate one bowl of soup, I remembered that I wanted to add the lime juice like a lot of reviewers recommended (1/3-1/2 cup).  That first bowl of soup was good/great.  I added 1/3 cup of lime juice to the rest of the soup and mixed it in.  Way too much lime and it ruined the soup!  I'm cooking the soup again to see if it helps decrease the lime taste.

Holy cow, great soup.  I stayed true to the original recipe, and added one can of black beans, drained.  This recipe is simply outstanding.

I absolutely LOVE this recipe! I did some minor changes however... I added 1 chopped zucchini, 1 chopped yellow squash, and a can (drained) of pinto beans. 

I made Lipton's Spanish Rice to add to the soup and topped it with tortilla chips, fresh avocado, and shredded cheese. Muy Bueno!

I was a little skeptical about this recipe as it sounded a bit unusual to me, but I was pleasantly surprised!  I made a few substitutions based on what I had in my kitchen; first I used fresh onion and green peppers, I reduced the cumin to 2 tablespoons based on the suggestions here, I didn't have any cans of green chilies so I used chili style canned tomatoes and I substituted chicken broth for the vegetable.  I added black beans and served the toppings on the side.  I am not able to eat cheese, but my family is.  Even without the cheese it was delicious!  I added a dollop of sour cream on my serving and it was excellent.  Even the kids loved it.  This is a recipe for the recipe box for sure!

Really really good! I thought the frozen vegetables would lower the quality of the soup, but not so! I halved the recipe and made a few changes to make it a bit healthier/tastier: I used a non-stick pan so no oil was needed. I added a can of petite diced tomatoes with chilies/lime instead of crushed. Like some other reviews suggested, I squeezed lime juice into the soup. I left out the cheese. Frozen sweet corn was used instead of canned. Also, I added a diced jalapeno and some cayenne pepper for a kick. Oh, and at the very end, I put a dollop of plain yogurt on each bowl and stirred it in - that gives it a great flavor! This was a winner, I already added the recipe to my permanent collection.

This was delicious. I did some of my own revisions. I diced one onion, 1/2 each of a red & green bell pepper and sauted that in olive oil with the garlic and seasonings. I like mine mild, so I reduced the cumin to 1 tsp. I also added 1 tsp each of garlic & onion powder, coriander and a 1/2 tsp oregano. I omited the chile peppers and used no pepper. I used vegetarian chicken broth and 2 - 14 oz can fire roasted tomatoes. I added a can of red kidney beans; rinsed & drained. I made my own tortilla strips from the baked tortilla chips from this site (didn't have time to use the chili and lime). Additional garnishes included fresh chopped cilantro, lime wedges and r/f sour cream. Took it to my son's church choir practice and everyone loved it, including my son. Will be making again. Thank you for the recipe, it is a good base.

I followed this recipe and in addition, I added a can of drained, rinsed black beans and about 1/2 cup of leftover cooked brown rice.  I topped it with fresh cilantro, avocado slices, and Texas Toast brand Chili Lime Tortilla Strips.  My husband an I each ate two full bowls.  This recipe is a keeper and I can't wait to make it for my adult sons. .

I used frozen corn instead of canned and added a can of black beans.  I also used about 1/2 of the broth called for.  I left out the salt because there was plenty in the canned tomatoes and beans.  Delicious and easy!

I gave this four stars because I prefer this more as a nacho-type meal, rather than soup. I felt the soup was too "tomato-y", but after draining some of the liquid, it is a very good topping or dip for chips.

Fast, easy, tasty & healthy (especially if you substitute fresh ingredients for the canned ones). One absolute MUST add is fresh cilantro.  It's not tortilla soup without it.

Of course I change everything but I lkept the heart of the recipe. This soup was delicious and hearty. I just chopped a red and green bell pepper, onion, added a can of drained black beans, and a packet of sazon. I also used have a can of Rotel's tomatoes and green chiles. I seasoned everything to taste. The avocados really mellow out the flavor nicely and add creamy goodness. Will absolutely make again.

This was a fabulous soup! I did add a can of black beans (well rinsed) for protein- and it was great. my husband had never had tortilla soup and my parents are very big meat eaters-- and this soup satisfied everyone when I cooked it for a family night dinner! I heavily recommend you try it.

Made some adjustments: added yellow and green squash, black beans, corn; left out the frozen onion and pepper mix- added our own fresh red pepper and onions. We used less stock, more spices. We also cooked chicken on the side for the meat-eaters. We boiled chicken breasts in orange juice with garlic, and then shredded it and had it under the soup. We also used a lot more avocado and cheese!

The soup isn't finished and already I've burned my tongue from sneaking so many tastes.  This is a really wonderful recipe.  It's very user friendly and still tastes authentic.  I added a can of jalepenos for an extra kick because we like to burn our tastebuds off in this family.  My other addition was a jar of Goya brand Recaito which is a cilantro cooking base.  Try adding some cilantro to this recipe--it brightens it up and balances the cumin.  Can't wait to share this with my friends and family!

This was SOOO good!  As suggested by others, I added a can of black beans, cut down the cumin to about 1.5T and only had one can of peppers on hand, so that's what I added.  The only suggestions I have is that it needs more veggies (celery, carrots maybe?) and the tortillas chips are much better on top of the soup than underneath the soup.  It's good stuff!

So good and authentic. I also added black beans and cilantro and used fresh onion, peppers and corn. Easy and delish.

This is surprisingly flavorful.  A very different kind of soup.  My family says it tastes like a taco in a bowl.

I adore this soup!!  I make a huge batch of it about every week and a half (and there's only 2 of us who eat it).  I do add pinto or black beans, as well as 1/4 cup lime juice, and the latter really makes the soup exceptional.  If I got this at a restaurant, I would go back again and again.

Love, love, love this soup!   I change it up a little bit (not vegetarian), I add chicken to make it more filling (cook it before adding the peppers and onions) and I use fresh peppers and onions instead of frozen.  Also I use OXO chicken bouillion powder dissolved in water for the broth, and diced tomatoes instead of crushed.  And instead of the green chilies, I use dried red chili peppers.  I top it with cheese, sour cream, and green onions.  Love the idea of avocados, but just haven't had them on hand.

So easy, delicious and healthy! I made this for New Year's Eve to accompany the tacos we had at a friend's house.  Everyone gobbled it up and complimented it - even the colorful presentation with the avocado and cheese on top. I stuck to the recipe except used a fresh onion and frozen corn since that's what I could find in the store. I wouldn't change a thing, but can see how flexible the recipe would be to substitutions or additions. My husband already wants us to make it again and we definitely will!

This recipe was amazing. After reading several comments I chose to add black beans. Other than that I followed the recipe exactly and it turned out wonderful. My husband even made sure it got put in the refrigerator as soon as he was done eating so he could have leftovers!

This was my first time tasting tortilla soup. I've always longed to order a bowl at Mexican restaurants, but I was never able to find a meatless soup. This was worth the wait! The lime really livened up the soup, and the avocado added an unexpected creaminess. This soup has such a variety of tastes and textures, it really was a treat. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great soup but was way too spicy for me!  I doubled the broth and tomatoes and that really helped.  I also only used one can of chilies.

Three tablespoons of cumin was way too much for our taste but will make again with 1 teaspoon of cumin and 1 tablespoon of chili powder, use fresh peppers/onions and add a can of rinsed black beans hoping to fit our taste buds a little better.

I substituted the cans of vegetable broth for veggie stock/broth cubes. They are cheaper. They worked great. I used 4 with a little over 4 cups of water. I used fresh jalapeno peppers instead of chillies from the can, also cheaper. This soup tastes just like what you get in the Mexican restaurant. Don't skip the avocado!

The recipe came out okay. A little bit too bland, watery. I recommend not using oily chips as they seem to disintegrate a bit differently. Also go easy on the cheese and add in some black beans, other veggies.
**As an aside, and I'd like to hear differently if this is not the case, this recipe did not taste very authentic. I have eaten the soup in Mexico and New Mexico. Both were very different.

Love this recipe! The flavor is wonderful. I have made it twice within the past month. I made a few additions and adjustments. I added 1 can each of pinto and black beans. I also used 2T. cumin and 1 can diced green chiles and 1 can jalapenos. I also added juice from 1 whole squeezed lime. YUMMMMM!!!!

This soup is delicious and much better than other tortilla soups I have made in the past.  It tastes just like a soup that I have had at a Mexican restaurant chain in the Bay Area, where I live. I love the broth and the fresh vegetables, particularly the avocado (which is essential for this soup).  I have made this soup numerous times, following it almost completely as written, except I put less chile peppers in (it was a little spicy for my taste)--one can instead of three.  In addition, I use frozen corn instead of canned, and stewed tomatoes instead of crushed (it was too tomato-tasting with the crushed and took over the broth).  This recipe will be in my favorite recipe file!

I was craving tortilla soup but didn't have any chicken defrosted... so I thought I'd give this one a try.  Yum!  I used fresh onion and a yellow pepper and added leftover take-out salsa instead of one of the cans of green chilies.  Makes tons!  Love the avocado.

This recipe for this soup is ***SOOO ABSOLUTLEY DELICIOUS!!!**** Major, major yyuuuummmm! I could eat this numerous times every week. I crumble the grated cheese and tortilla chips into the soup while it's still hot so they can melt into it all very nicely! I haven't put the hot peppers into the soup as of yet simply b/c I really don't like very spicey foods. But everything else is A+ delicious! I made it both for my husband one night during the week as well as for my family at Christmas and it was a hit both times!

I've made this recipe several times and it consistently gets rave reviews and requests for the recipe.  I've made a couple modifications. I use fresh bell peppers and onions instead of the frozen mix.  I find it doesn't take long to cut up and you can't beat the taste of fresh vegetables.  I also add a can of whole black beans about half-way through the cooking time to add some protein.  They pair well with the recipe.  I also recommend adding some chopped green onions and a dollop of sour cream on at the end depending on your preference.  Lastly, don't forget to squeeze some fresh lime juice on right before you serve it. Thanks for the wonderful recipe!

Yummy!  I used 2 tablespoons of cumin as recommended by others and added a little ground coriander.  I couldn't find the pepper/onion mix so I just chopped my own.  Next time I think I'll try roasted the vegetables.  Thanks for the great recipe!!

AWESOME SOUP!! It is so hard to find easy, delicious vegetarian dishes.  This has great flavor, and does not rely on heavily processed fake meats or tofu.  My 6 year old asked me to make it again, and that is pretty rare.  Instead of bagged veggies, I sliced up fresh, organic peppers and onions, and only used about 1/2 the cumin, and it turned out really well.  Also, I heated up fresh tortillas instead of the chips, and those were great.  Thank you so much for sharing this recipe!!

This recipe is too heavy on the cumin and light on other spices. It also lacks the authentic corn taste of a true tortilla soup.

I'd cut the cumin to 2 tablespoons, incease garlic to 3 cloves, cut green chilies to 2 cans, add a dash of cayenne pepper, a dash of chili powder.

Also, puree a couple of cups of the broth with 5 - 6 hot, softened corn tortillas, then add back to the soup.

Add fresh cilantro when served.

Wow, this recipe is delicious! Like other reviewers, I made some alterations- my grocery store didn't carry frozen peppers & onion mix, so I picked up a frozen pack of mexican veggies (corn, green peppers, onions, and black beans.) So I left out the canned corn. I didn't feel that the chili peppers were too spicy, as I like spicy things, so I added all three cans, plus additional cayenne and chili powder. The sour cream and avocado really made the dish. The soup was flavorful and very hearty. Thanks!

My whole hard-to-please, meat-eating family loved this! The avocado on top was definitely a good touch, we had chips and salsa with it but I think cornbread would be yummy as well. Thanks for this great recipe!

This is a great recipe - I only made a couple of changes. First, I used fresh peppers (red, yellow, and green) and onions. Second, I added black beans and used an immersion blender at  the end, I kept it a little chunky though. It was an enormous dinner hit at a dinner party - I served it with the Pancho Villa Tilapia also on this site.

I too added a can of black beans, some chili powder, and some taco seasoning.  It turned out terrific!  My 3 and 1 year olds even licked their bowls clean and my husband who dislikes peppers ate 2 bowls.

This is one of my absolute favorite soup recipes! The avocado and a bit of cheese are a must for the most flavor! Great to take to work with you for a quick meal.

I loved this recipe.  I only would reccommend adding a bunch of cilantro.  Be sure to add the chips immediately before eating 'cause they get soggy fast.  It was even better the second day.

Really yum!  This soup is so good I eat it at 2:00 AM for a snack.  Like some reviewers I added some black beans, like 1/2 - 1 cup.  Delish!

Wow! This is an excellent and very easy recipe.  I'll definitely keep the ingredients on hand for this one! I did add a can of black beans for extra protien and some cayenne for an added kick.  I tasted it before, though, and it was wonderful to begin with.  Thanks for the great recipe.

Love this soup! Made a few modifications to suit our taste.   Most were a reduction of ingredients.  Used 1 can of petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed tomatoes.  Used 1 tsp of cumin instead of 3 tbps.  Used 1 can of mild green chile peppers instead of 3.  Used 1 cup of White Shoepeg Corn. Used 2 cans of College Inn Vegetable broth, which is a little less than the recipe calls for.  Added a can of rinsed black beans for protein.   This is quick and easy to make, and is very tasty!

This soup was amazing! I followed the recipe closely with a few minor changes: I topped the soup with some fresh cilantro at the end, used fresh yellow and red bell peppers and onions rather than frozen and used slightly more broth than called for. I used a 10 oz. jar of chili peppers and while the soup had a good heat, next time I may add a little additional hot sauce as well. While the soup was simmering I couldn't imagine it as 12 servings, but when served over chips a little soup goes a long way! I also topped with some dehydrated and marinated zucchini but fresh would also have been delicious. Thanks for the recipe!

Made this soup today and it was fantastic! I followed others suggestions and only used two cans of chilies and only two tablespoons of cumin. I also added a can of black beans and garnished with cheese and homemade guacamole. Definitely a keeper!

I've never reviewed a recipe before as I am not much of a cook. However,  this given me some cooking confidence!. Great for parties (transfer to a slow cooker) or a nice dinner with some bread. I use fresh peppers and onions and frozen green chile instead of canned. I also add a can of rinsed white navy beans and some imitation chicken to add protein for my vegetarian family. As others said, I reduced the cumin by about a 3rd.  You can also toss the corn in when you cook it, no real need to do it after. Very forgiving recipe.

Instant hit! I did make revisions however. I used 3 cans of Rotel which includes both the tomatoes and peppers. The kids loved it!I added cilantro, a can of black beans, drained and cut the cumin in 1/2. Yummy!

So if you don't have/want chili peppers in this, some cayenne pepper and lime juice make an excellent substitute. The broth def needed a little kick and once I added the lime juice it blended wonderfully. Def a must. Wonderful recipe, my boyfriends coworkers were asking him for the recipe!

I rated this recipe based on the actual recipe given.  Overall, with 3 cans of green chiles, we found it WAY too spicy.  (And, I love spicy food.)  Aside from that, it was good.

The 2nd time I made it, I cut the green chiles back to 1 can.  I added 1 can of drained and rinsed garbanzo beans (or black beans).  

Excellent!  Thanks!

OMG...seriously did not expect to get this much flavor with just these ingredients.  So yummy!!!  The flavor definitely comes from the cumin and the canned green chili so cutting back on these also cuts back on the BAM of flavor you'll get, but everyone has a different flavor profile they like.  I added 2 cans of the mild green chilies and one of the hot chopped green chilies.  I also added some tomatillos...just because I had them and they needed to be used.  Added some beans and some chopped kale as well.  This makes a LOT of soup but once my family eats it I don't think it's going to last. and it probably freezes well too.  Great for a cold winters night!!

Fabulous recipe and so easy to make - I add some red pepper flakes and whatever type of canned bean I have on hand to bulk it up a little. Frozen corn works just as well as canned.

I halved this recipe since I was just making it for three people, but honestly I wish I hadn't! It was one of the rare dishes that we ran out of mid-meal and wanted more! 

I made alterations though: 1 can of chilies (for a half recipe, rather than 1.5 cans), a 1/2 cup of Nutritional Yeast, 1 extra cup of vegetable broth, half a can of medium enchilada sauce, and 3 - 4 tbsp of balsamic vinegar. It was so good! I plan on making this again very soon (: 

Oh! And I also threw in some leftover taco fixins to use them up, there was TVP taco filler, refried beans, fresh onions, tomato and cilantro, about 1 cup total. The cilantro added a great flavor!!

oh my this was HOT!  I didn't get the chopped chilli peppers but the whole ones, I chopped up 2 peppers and man it was hot.  We don't like spicy so not sure what I'm going to do with this soup.  I may add some more water/broth as I didn't use the full amount recommended.  If I do this again there will be no chillies added.

DELISH!! I did use fresh vs frozen like others recommended. Also did about 2 tbsp cumin, and 1 tbsp of cayenne and chili powder each. I did the black beans as well, and about a cup of quinoa for some extra protein. It was SO good, esp with the fresh avocado on top.

I made this for a soup competition, and won first place in the vegetarian division!  I made mine a bit spicier with more cumin and some chili powder, but it's a matter of taste.

I love making this soup. It's easy. It's simple. Everyone I make it for loves it. I don't like cumin so I leave it out and it's still fantastic.

At first I didn‚Äôt expect much from this recipe but it turned out to be amazing! It was a simple recipe, easy to prepare, and super flavorful. Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have the canned chopped green chili peppers so I substituted freshly diced jalape√±o. This added a comforting warmness to the soup. The other thing I did differently is to use freshly cut peppers and onions as opposed to frozen. I decided to use freshly fried corn tortilla strips as garnish instead of topping them with the soup as the recipe suggested. This is because of a textural preference I have. I want to feel the crispiness of the tortilla instead of sogginess. Overall, this was a really good recipe. I recommend it.

One of the best soups that I have ever had. Literally!!!! It's delicious, satisfying and flavorful. Vegetarians and non veggies finally have something to savor together!!!! Try it and you won't be sorry! 

My way: I used one fresh chopped onion and one fresh chopped red bell pepper (I find it odd that I couldn't find the frozen mix in stores... but chopping these items myself made it more satisfying!) and I omitted cheese (I'm trying to stay away from dairy). 

I froze leftovers in individual portion containers (omitting the tortilla chips and avocado) to take to work and had many people asking for the recipe!

I made this recipe last night and absolutely loved it! My boyfriend was full but had seconds because he liked it so much! I altered the recipe only a little bit. I used fresh bell peppers and onions, 3 cloves of garlic (I love garlic!), I used a 42oz. box of vegetable broth and then added a vegetable bouillon cube and 2 cups of water, added 1 can of drained black beans, and we used a Mexican blend cheese mix. Easy recipe and plenty of leftovers for the 2 of us!

yuuuup, this is it, folks. great recipe for a filling, healthy, spicy meal. and guess what folks, it comes with kale! that's right folks, you heard right: Kale. yes, if you add Kale to this simple recipe (and super chopped carrots for that matter) you'll make this awesome recipe even healthier and more filling! But wait: there's more! Add a jalapeno and there will be a nice spicy zing to this delicious meal. Order now and you'll receive 14 oz of veggie broth in 1 cube of bullion! Seriously,  make this. Its easy to modify and delicious to consume.

This recipe is great! I changed a couple of things. I added fresh bell peppers and onion. To replace the crushed tomatoes and green peppers, I added 1 can of rotel. I only put 1 tbsp of cumin, 3 would have been too much. I also added 1/4 cup of fresh lime juice.

Delicious!! I used 2 fresh green peppers and one small red one, and one large onion.  Used 4-5 garlic cloves.  Used way less chilis and it was hot, but delicious!  I added a can of black beans at the end and topped with lime juice and cilantro.

Hmmm.... I hate to be a downer, but this didn't suit me or my hubs at all (sorry!). My hubs didn't think this was thick enough to stand up to the tortilla chips we garnished our bowls with (his turned to mush). I didn't care for the texture (I guess I don't like mushy veggies) and thought the taste was just so-so. I must say, I never thought to use a stir-fry veggie blend in tortilla soup and that is the very thing that drew me to this recipe to begin with. The fact that you can prep this in under an hour using convenience items was another HUGE factor in my decision to give this a try. NOTE: Birds Eye brand sells a tri-colored bell pepper and onion stir-fry mix. This is the only one I could find and had to scour two stores for it. :) I really wish we enjoyed this enough to add to our regular menu rotation, but it just fell short for us. I'll stick with our favorite chicken tortilla soup instead. Thanks anyways, DSYLVAN. :-)

the soup is really good.  The key is the cumin.  I probably added more than three tablespoons.  I used two less cans of broth (so that it was heartier).  When soup was done I split it into two bowls, added chicken for my husband and tofu for myself.  I also added extra corn and black beans, I put a bit of cheese on top and crunched up some tortilla chips on top.

My wife raved about this soup!  The cumin and garlic gave it excellent flavor.  Next time, I will halve the recipe, this time we (3) had plenty of leftovers that just get better with more time for the flavors to meld.

I had to make some changes to this as I didn't have all the ingredients but it came out sooo good. I used a whole fresh red pepper, one large onion and cooked them in the garlic. Added the cumin and some black pepper. Then I added 1 can crushed tomatoes, 1 can mexican seasoned tomatoes, 2 cans water with some bullion. I also added 4 dashes of Tapatilo, a can of black beans, and a can of kidney beans. 

Very easy to add on and make subsitutions.

This recipe was very simple and incredibly tasty! I held back on the amount of cumin as well as the amount of green chilis (our 13 year couldn't take the spice) and it turned out really well. I also added a spoonful of sour cream to each bowl to ease the spice. I will make this again!

Very tasty veggie dish.  Used a bag of caldo veggies to add a bit more substance and turned out wonderful.  Also added a bit more cayenne for kick (but I really enjoy spicy food).

This is very good! Don't over cook the peppers/onions at the beginning- I did and I think they would've been better if I hadn't. I didn't do 3 Tbsp cumin- I love cumin, but that seemed to be too much- 2 Tbsp was right for me. I also added a can of drained garbanzo beans- yum!

The soup was great. I made a couple of alterations: one medium onion and one medium bell pepper instead of frozen stir fry mix, I added 1 can of black beans, 3 instead of 2 cloves of garlic, 2 instead of 3 Tbsp of cumin, only 2 cans of chile peppers, frozen corn instead of canned, I added 1 tsp of Italian spice, 1/4 cayenne pepper and 1 tsp of paprika. Everybody liked it and there was no leftovers;) Thanks for posting the recipe!

This is very good. Coming from the south, I don't think three cans of chilis are too many. I did add 2 cans of drained and rinsed black beans along with 1 cup of instant brown rice and a tbsp of cilantro.

I absolutely love this soup. I used half veggie stock and half chicken stock, added rinsed, canned black beans (as recommended in another review), and squeezed fresh lime juice into the finished soup. I wasn't able to get the peppers & onions together in frozen form, so just used fresh onion. I did add some garlic powder & onion powder as well. I will be making this again and again!

It was.ok. based off all the great reviews I must have done something wrong. I only added 2tbls off cumin. And 2 cans off pepper  and was way too hot for me to.eat. I gave it 2 stars only because. My husband was able to eat it. Said it was ok but wouldn't be upset if I never made it again.

Very good! I added 2 cans of black beans for additional fiber and protein, and reduced the cumin to 2 tablespoons, because it started to get a little spicy for my taste. I'm also a huge avocado fan, so I'll probably add more next time - it also helps to cut the spiciness.

Awesome Soup! A few changes I made was I did 28oz of veg broth, and the remaining just water. Added about 2T of beef buoillion sprinkles also. Also added 1 jalapeno pepper to add some extra spice. Topped with green onions, avocado, tortilla strips, sour cream.

So delicious! I also added chili powder and red pepper flakes. In the last 10 minutes I added mushrooms and the last 5 minutes I added red beans along with the corn.

Wonderful!  I follow the same basic recipe (but I cut my own pepper and onion mix) but add 3/4 of a can of black beans, 1 whole can of whole kernel corn, and some Hot Taco Bell Sauce.  The sauce is the same as the sauce that what you get at Taco Bell in the packet except its in a small glass bottle.  I also add a little sour cream to mine (along with cheese, chips, and avocado) and it's amazing.  My boyfriend doesn't like sour cream but he thinks that his bowl is amazing too!  This is amazing every time that we make it!  Thanks so much!

Fabulous...served it to a group of friends who raved about it.  Gets 5 stars from us.  I did take the cumin to 2 Tbsp as suggested in another review ( but 3 might be fine), and added a can of rinsed black beans, also suggested in a review.

use a can of diced tomatoes instead of whole tomatoes.  add a can of black beans.  use 3T taco seasoning instead of 3T cumin.  Cut up whole wheat torillas and throw in soup instead of serving of corn chips.

Made this last soup last week and everyone loved it, including my husband who is not a vegetarian and he kept asking for more.  I followed others' advice and added one rinsed, drained can of black beans.  I used 3 TBSP of cumin as the recipe called for but only had 2 cans of chile peppers on hand.  I also used a 32oz box of vege stock and the rest water.  This will be a regular in my household.

I love this recipe. I had never had tortilla soup before and I decided to try this out. It was great. I changed it up quite a bit, though. Instead of frozen vegetables, I used a green bell, a yellow pepper, a red pepper, and I added some cilantro and black beans. This is easy to make, and it calls for a lot of ingredients that i usually keep in the fridge anyway. I noticed some people say that it was too spicy with the three cans of green chiles, but this works for me, so if you like it spicy I'd say go for it.

I will admit I'm not a huge fan of cumin so I substituted with my own spices with kick . . . I also added a can of black beans to add some color and protein. This recipe was FANTASTIC! And so easy! I will definitely make it again!

After reading some reviews I did a little tweaking myself.  I added a can of drained and rinsed black beans.  This soup was okay.  The easiness factor gave it the extra star in my opinion.  I made this along side dinner.  Now I have lunch for the week as well!  The avocados are what brings this soup alive for me - DON'T SKIP THEM!

This is a great soup that can be tweaked based on individual tastes.  I increased the cumin and used fresh peppers/onions rather than frozen.  Other than that I followed the recipe and I think it's 5 stars as written.  What I really like is that I can add beans and other veggies to make it a heartier soup if I want to. Thanks for the recipe :)

I loved this soup...I loved it so much that I ate it until I got sick! It was that good. I substituted the frozen and canned tomatoes with fresh and topped it with sour cream since I'm from  Wisconsin and we find a way to put dairy on everything. I have to say, the best part about this soup was setting up a "customize your soup" area on my countertop when I served it. Fun to make, fun to eat.

We go vegetarian every Lent and this was a staple throughout this year.  It is a great base soup that is made even better with your chosen condiments.  You don't miss the meat!

Made some small changes, I could not find the frozen stir fry mixture so I used 2 green peppers sliced thinly and a large onion, 2 tablespoons of cumin, 3 jalepeno peppers in place of the canned peppers, I used chicken broth in place of the vegetable broth,  and frozen corn instead of canned. Used lower fat chips and cheese. So easy to make and we really enjoyed it, only other thing I would do differently is break the chips up a bit before putting them in the bowl.

Easy to make and delicious indeed.  I used frozen corn and half chicken broth (only because I ran out of veg), the entire listed amount of cumin and the entire listed amount of green chilis - it was perfect.  DSylvan knew what they were doing.  I admit that I looked at the measured 3 tablespoons of cumin and thought, "Wow, that's a lot of cumin," but it wasn't nearly as assertive as I thought it would be, and it added a wonderful rich smokiness.  Canned green chilis are about the mildest thing this side of marshmallows, so there's no need to be afraid of them, either.  Again, they just add body and deliciousness.  I served it over tortilla chips, with avocado, lime wedges, hot sauce and a mexican cheese mix.  Delicious!  Thanks so much.

1st try as written 2-3 stars due to lack of heat intensity and overpowering green chile flavor.  I like mexican food to wow my mouth with layers of flavor and some heat.  For attempt #2, I used rotel tomatoes, only 1 can green chiles,  1/2 tbsp chicken base, fire roasted corn with black beans frozen mixture, small can tomato sauce,  1/2 tsp Penzeys Southwestern Spice.  Topped with dolop of sour cream, chopped cilantro, few dashes Cholula. Cheese, avocado and chips as written, but cheese was a mix of pepperjack and colby. Not truly vegetarian with chicken base, sour cream and dairy cheese though.  All in all, as written, this is a great base recipe.

delicious! Per other reviews, we used fresh peppers and onions instead of frozen, diced tomatoes instead of crushed, frozen corn instead of canned, added a can of black beans and added a splash of lime and a dollop of sour cream to the toppings.. the combo of chips, soup, cheese, avocado and sour cream was amazing! a new favorite in our house!

Amazing soup!  I did substitute fresh onion & peppers for the frozen, petite diced tomatoes for crushed, and I added a can of black beans, and served it over a shallow bed of brown rice.  This was amazing.  I didn't have cheese, so we just added a dollop of sour cream on top.  My husband is eating low sodium, so I cut some corn tortillas into strips and baked them on a baking sheet in the toaster oven.  My husband was thrilled.  He thought low fat/low sodium eating would be bland.  It's anything but.  Will definitely make this again.

As did another reviewer, I used fresh peppers, onions, and tomatoes, and half the cumin.  I also omitted the oil, using broth instead.  My family LOVED this...and it's all veggies and spices.  Thanks for sharing a great recipe!

This is the most amazing soup!  I added shredded chicken breast and chicken broth and my husband said this is the best soup he's ever had.  It will definately be a regular in our house!  I also added chopped cilantro along with the avacado and it was GOOD!

This is the easiest thing I make, and it's so delicious and healthy. Watch the chili peppers if you don't like heat! I do, so I use fresh jalapenos :)  And can I just say, the frozen pepper and onion mix is a LIFESAVER and because it's in a soup it doesn't seem any less fresh. You absolutely must try this recipe!

loved this soup! took other suggestions to make it out of this world:  a. 2 tablespoon of cumin (instead of 3)  b. 3 cups of vegetable stock & 2 of water (instead of 5 stock)   c. 1.5 fresh red peper & 1 orange peper &  1 onion (instead of frozen type)   d. 1/3 cup of fresh lime  e. one can of black beans (drained) added when I added the corn  f. hint of lime white corn tortilla chips    The advocado didn't do much in my opinion, but the cheese did, which was suprising because it was already fabulous.  Thank you for this recipe. Makes large quantity !!

This is a GREAT soup! I just saw this recipe this morning and knew I had to make it! It's awesome! I was wondering if it would be too much broth with 4 cans of veggie broth but no. Even if you didn't want this to be veggie, just make the soup as is and put in chicken or shrimp ( which I thought about doing but I'm not)

One of the best soups I have ever made.  I live in New Mexico so the amount of chiles is just right.  I prefer to use fresh peppers and onions over the frozen.

I thought this soup was REALLY good. I followed the suggestion of less chilies, but found that it wasn't enough heat for me. I added 4 cloves of garlic, used fresh green pepper and yellow onion (garlic pepper, and onion sauteed lightly before being added). I also added a can of black beans for protien, and instead of corn I used hominy, 2 cans (because it's what's used in posole). And instead of crushed tomatoes, I used stewed. The next time i think I might try to blend a bit of the soup and add it back in so it's not as chunky, but it's still delicious. I'm having it for lunch today!

This was a great recipe for tortilla soup.  I've never made it before and this tasted EXACTLY like what I'm used to.  I didn't buy the pepper onion stir-fry mix so I just saute√©d the onion, pepper, garlic and cumin together.  I used chicken broth (because I didn't have vegetable).  I used a can of fire-roasted tomatoes and 4 fresh tomatoes that I cut up.  The corn was so-called "Mexican corn" because it was corn mixed with red and green peppers.   To serve, I topped it with chopped cilantro, fresh squeezed lime and lemon juice, avocado and cheese.  The avocado really makes the difference - I'd never had avocado in the soup before and I'm never going back!   I didn't add too much salt and no pepper; there was enough spice with the green chilies and cumin.   All in all, this will be a keeper in my recipe book for years to come. Thanks so much for posting! (I gave this 4 stars because the husband only reserves the 5 stars for those rare meals that come around once a century! If it was up to me, it'd be a 5, but I make the meals and he rates them - it's our deal.)

Really good tortilla soup!  We loved this one, and have been eating it all week.  I made a couple simple changes - only 2 cans of green chilies and added some crushed red pepper.  I also added about 1/3 of a cup of lime juice.  Right before serving when I added the avo and cheese, I also put in some fresh cilantro.  The combination of flavors made this soup truly amazing.

This was delicious! I couldn't find the pepper and onion mix at the store, so I just put in fresh onions and peppers, which I think is probably better anyways. I also added a bit of salsa and some taco seasoning mix. Otherwise everything else was perfect! I strongly recommend putting in sour cream and avacado, it is delicious!

I made this for a family gathering, it was really hearty and filling without the tortilla chips (my parents aren't into "chips").  This will be added to the soup repertoire this fall and winter.

I just made this soup tonight and it was delicious. I used fresh yellow, green and red peppers and onion. I also added some cilantro. Everything else was the same. It is right up there with the soup at Qdoba which I love. Thanks for a great recipe.

This is one of my families FAVORITE recipes! I am vegetarian and picky, so there is very few dinners we can eat together, but this is one of them, thank you. However, they are not accustomed to such spicy food, so we adjusted it a bit.  We: added beans, took out the chile peppers, added fresh instead of  frozen peppers, added corn, and we added less cumin. (again them,  not me). Thanks again.

I have made this for years, so I figured it was time to rate it. :) I always get rave reviews. I throw some sliced up flour tortillas in the oven at about 400 for a few mintues to serve with the soup. Delicious.

It's the best tortilla soup recipe I've found. I used fresh veggies instead of frozen, and added a little extra vegetable bouillon and red pepper for flavor. I'm making it tonight for the third time. It's even better left over for lunch the next day!

I loved this recipe. I used fresh onion and red pepper because that is what I had on hand. I also added some red pepper flake because I love HOT food. And I added Black beans for some protein. Very flavorful and healthy. LOVED IT.  PS: I think if you didn't add the broth this would make an awesome corn and black bean salsa. I am gonna try it.

So delicious. I used an immersion blender so it wouldn't be so chunky. Add black beans and rice and it tastes just like the Mexican gumbo from Qdoba.

Very delicious soup. A definite keeper. I substituted Rotel diced tomatoes with lime juice and cilantro for the tomatoes and green chile peppers. I also added black beens and kidney beans to make the soup a little heartier. Nice additions. My wife loved this soup.

Just a few shortcuts to share that helped shorten the grocery list for this soup.  Rather than 3 cans of chiles, I bought one.  I found a few brands (Ro-Tel & Red Gold) that make diced tomats w/the green chiles.  The Red Gold is hot, Ro-Tel was mild (saving Ro-Tel for another use).  I also wanted some fresh cilantro and tomats, so I bought a fresh salsa.  There was one w/black beans and corn.  I still bought a can of black beans and frozen corn, b/c I was using this as a supper soup.  But for use as a first course, the beans and corn in the salsa was plenty.  I keep veggie stock in the paper cartons on hand, so I used one of those and rinsed the salsa container w/fresh water and added that to the pot.  Other changes I made were small, but the next time I make this I will probably use fresh onions and peppers.  But for the sake of time and convenience, they will do.  Good soup, I'd serve this at a dinner party (w/fresh peppers and onions).

Extremely good soup.  I followed some of the changes others suggested, like adding kidney beans.  Instead of the chiles, I used half of a fresh jalepeno, which was a perfect medium for my spicy taste and my husband's more sensitive preference. I also cut the cumin in half as he's not crazy about it, but sprinkled in some garlic powder, basil and parsley.

This soup was fantastic.  I boiled two chicken breast for a chicken broth, then cubed the chicken and added it to the soup.  I also omitted bagged veggies, but added diced carrots, celery, onion, red pepper, and green pepper.  I used one 7oz can of green chiles and 1 can of rotel tomatoes and green chiles, and another 14ox can of italian diced tomatoes (garlic, basil & oregano).  This added to the great flavor.  Everyone loved it.  Oh yeah, I made my own baked tortilla strips(less fat) and served with cilantro, avocado & cheese.

YUM! I didn't have the frozen pepper/onion stir fry, so I just added an onion and the red pepper that I had on hand. It was delicious! The kids really liked this one and were so excited to actually eat CHIPS for dinner!

We make this soup alll the time. It's great for casual guests and reheats well for a lunch that will make your coworkers jealous. 

We do tend to use a bit less broth and a bit more of the 'chunky' stuff. Add in some chopped fresh tomatoes from the garden if you have any- they're great!

AMAZING!!! I ate every single bite. i only made slight adjustments. I added a can of black beans, and I used 1 7oz can of chiles and added a couple sliced chipotle peppers in adobo. It added the right amount of kick for my taste! Excellent recipe!!!!

This recipe is sooo good. We love it. I followed it to a T the first time. After that, I cut up my own onions and peppers (cheaper). I used less cumin because I ran out. I definitely recommend using the full amount, or almost the full amount of cumin. It tastes so good. Love it!

I really liked this recipe- I only became a total vegetarian this year and I've had trouble finding a non-chicken stock based tortilla soup! It had nice flavors, and it was easy to customize to my personal tastes. Instead of crushed tomatoes, I used tomato paste and I added paprika & a little bit of oregano. Based on previous reviewers' comments, I added a squirt/squeeze of lime juice & lemon juice and that added a really nice zing to it. Definitely going to repeat this recipe!

My new husband is vegetarian, so in trying to "get with plan!", I discovered this recipe; it was soooooo delicious!  I live in a small town & was unable to find the pepper/onion stir fry, but I found a veggie stir fry- similar to it and just removed the broccoli!  He loved it and I loved it!  I've already shared it with my VERY meat lover family & they are looking forward to making it :)

Very easy to make! I would suggest using some fresh veggies instead of the frozen package of peppers and onions. And to cut down on the sodium use an unsalted can of corn.  Overall this is a great complement to any main dish.

This is the first time I have rated a recipe five stars.  I've made the soup a few times now and do make some changes.  

First off, I use three fresh bell peppers julienned with one fresh sliced white onion.  Instead of 3 teaspoons of cumin I use 1 1/2 teaspoon cumin and 1 1/2 teaspoon Bill Echol's Taco Seasoning I (which can also be found on this site).  For the broth I used 8 cups of homemade Basic Vegetable Stock (which can also be found on this site), and I use 1 can of hot chilies and two cans of mild.  Top with fresh avocado, cheddar, and monterrey jack cheese.  

My Dad (who hates vegetarian food) said it was the best soup he's ever had in his life.  THANKS!

I made this for Memorial Day.  Rain was predicted, so I didn't want to chance planning a cookout.  It was fantastic!  To go with it, we had Red Pepper and Corn Relish, and Addictive Sweet Potato Burritos,(both from this site).  I will make this soup again, and not change a thing!

This soup is the best!!  I put a little extra cumin and some chili powder in it to give it a little extra kick.  I also used the full amount of canned green chiles (they are not that hot).  Everybody thought this soup was wonderful!!!

Very good.  Used 2 cans chiles.  Used immersion blender after adding tomatoes.  Added a rinsed can of black beans before the corn.  Tasted good over lime tortilla chips with a dollop of sour cream and some cheese on top.

I really liked this recipe. Although I didn't agree with the member who said that it was too spicy. I thought that it was just perfect, I actually would have enjoyed it with a little more spice. I also added black beans and a little extra corn. The hint of lime tortilla chips were delicious. If your not sure just try it. I thought it was great. I even cooked it overnight in the crock pot so it was super easy.

This soup was good, but I recommend decreasing the amount of cumin. I would only put in half the amount next time, it really overpowered the soup.
The avacado is such a nice touch!

This is going into the dinner rotation!  Cheap, easy to make AND my kids loved it.  I used the "boat moter" at the end to puree it a bit because I am not a fan of peppers and wouldn't like biting a big chunk and then added corn and a can of black beans.  I was out of Cumin so I only used 2 T and it was great.

This was the best soup I have ever made! My family loved it! I cut down on the diced green chili and used fresh peppers and onions. I also added a can of black beans and a can of pinto beans. It made it very hearty and we were stuffed! I'm making it again tonight because we have all been craving it sonce the first time I made it!

I used a fresh onion and pepper added a can of drained and rinsed black beans, and made tortilla chips by baking corn tortillas in a 350-degree oven for 12 minutes. With the rich taste of the chopped avocado and chips, it was divine. I blended part of the soup towards the end; next time, I might blend it before putting in the beans and corn (so the veggies get blended, but not the more hearty elements).

Yummy!!!  I thoroughly enjoyed this recipe and will be making it over and over.  It's so easy and so flavorful.  I added a can of black beans and extra spices (chili powder, garlic powder) and served it with low-fat yogurt instead of sour cream.  Otherwise I followed this wonderful recipe.  Thank you!!

This is awesome tortilla soup!  I followed the recipe exactly except I added 2 Quorn meatless chicken cutlets diced up to the soup!  Also might try with black beans sometime.  If it is too hot--you probably used jalapeno peppers instead of green chiles, because as is, this soup is NOT spicy, IMO!  If you think its bland, then add a little hot sauce or salsa to your serving.  We thought it was absolutely perfect--I wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks for the recipe!!!

I am literally sitting here with my belly poked out, I ate so much. This recipe was absolutely delicious. Even my picky toddler asked for more. She loved the idea of eating "chips" in a meal. I took the advice of others and added black beans, cilantro, and less cumin. We are new to the "meatless world" and this was an amazing way to start. Bravo/brava to the recipe's creator (even if it is your fault I just gained 5 lbs!).

This is an excellent recipe. It's easy and quick to prepare and it made enough for our dinner tonight plus leftovers for the freezer! The only thing I changed was adding some black beans to make it a little more substantial for my husband. Love this recipe and I will definitely make it again.

This soup is soooo good!  It is very filling and is a must for the fall. While you could eat it without the tortilla chips and avocado, you shouldn't, because they are like the icing on the cake. Ohh Soo Good!

Update:  Ten years later and this is my go-to recipe for tortilla soup!  I do use chicken and chicken broth, but I am glad to have this recipe base to work from.  It's easy to adjust for what is on hand.

[Original review: I appreciated the ease of making this, and all of the veggies! But I did miss the chicken flavor, as I am not a vegetarian, and I do not have a favorite vegetable broth.  I think I will make this again, but use chicken broth, and possibly add chicken.]

Excellent recipe!!! Everyone that has tried this has just loved the soup. I just used 2 cans of chilies instead of 3 and the kids were able to eat it with some sour cream.

O..M...G... I'm not a huge fan of cumin, so I was a little apprehensive, but this recipe is absolutely incredible! I was very pleasantly surprised. Once it's done and you put the avacados and cheese on top... let your bowl sit for a few minutes so the flavors can all meld together... so delicious!

Very good!!  I didn't have the frozen pepper/onion mix, so I used a green bell pepper and a yellow onion.  Turned out great!  I will definitely make again!

This was AWESOME! And super easy... I got a craving for tortilla soup this afternoon but I've only had it once before and had no idea how to make it. This was perfect and my boyfriend also loved it. I followed the ingredient list but added my own amounts of everything, and I substituted jalepenos for the green chilies and it made it nice and spicy! Yay for leftovers.

This was just as good as the chicken Tortilla Soup I use to eat when I wasn't vegetarian. I used Quorn Chicken Strips and added fresh chopped cilantro. It stores very well too!

This was very good. It is just me and my husband so my mom got a night off cooking for her husband as there was plenty of left overs. She was pretty excited. Anyways, I only put 1 can of chili peppers in it and it was mild so if you like mild, then 1 can would be great. Thanks for the great recipe. 

I am a vegetarian and got my entire meat eating family to eat a delicious meatless meal. Yeah.

I thought it was great! My husband and son didn't care for it because there were no dead animals in it. I only had 1 can of green chiles so I threw in 3 fresh jalapeno peppers. That probably made it more spicy, but I thought it was perfect

Very filling! And very tasty! I added black beans and topped it off with lime tortilla chips, avocado, a dollop of sour cream, and shredded cheddar... then squeezed a little lime juice on top. So very good! My youngest son refilled his bowl twice!

I substituted chicken broth for vegetable broth. Incredible depth of flavor!  And super easy to make. I made it a day ahead to let the flavors develop and meld. Crowd favorite!

This has been a favorite of ours since like 2006 or so. We make it a little differently, but the "base" is the same. I add a can of black beans and use an immersion blender to mix everything together. Then we add corn at the very end if we have it on hand. I probably use a little less broth too. But this has been on our regular rotation for probably 13 years now. So good!

I made for a gathering and didn‚Äôt expect to like it- it was very good! Wow! I added the can of drained black beans after reading others thoughts, did only 1tablespoon cumin only because I ran out, 2 cans mild chiles, frozen corn instead of canned, and added 1/4 cup lime juice at the end. I offered plain and lime tortilla chips, oyster crackers, Mexican shredded cheese, sour cream. Everyone seemed to love it- including me!

Absolutely delicious.  We added black beans. For toppings we accidentally left off the cheese on first servings, but when I offered it for seconds, no one took it up. Instead, we used avocado, sour cream and lime juice...some folks added jalape√±o.  We will make this again.

I added black beans and red pepper flakes and used fresh peppers (red/yellow) and onion. I used the colored tortilla strips I put some on the bottom and on top. Substituted vegetable oil for olive oil. Everyone loved it! Will save this receipt for later.  Secret addition: Taj√≠n it wakes this dish all the way up!

I have made this several times. I don't change much, simmer longer and add more cumin,  throw in chopped jalapeno with the fresh onion and bell. I like to roast fresh corn vs frozen too. Black beans are great or pinto...just whatever. I'm not crazy for cheese in soups because it just becomes a stringy mess. I top with avo, cilantro, and things like that...I will make this several more times! Thank you for sharing!!!

This is a great recipe! We add corn and/or black beans to make it heftier. Freezes great and works for vegans and vegetarians depending on the toppings.

I made absolutely no changes to the recipe! My meat-loving husband was disappointed at first when I told him that there wasn‚Äôt any chicken in it. However, he quickly forgot when he tasted how good it was! I doubled the recipe for the two of us so we would have enough to freeze and enough for lunches throughout the week! It‚Äôs also fairly inexpensive since everything is mostly cans. I will definitely be making this recipe again!

We made this soup for eight of us and it was awesome! I followed other people‚Äôs advice and used just two tablespoons of cumin, and two cans of jalape√±os. I did add a can of drained black beans and then served it with some fresh lime juice and two avocados. Everyone raved about it and we will definitely be making it again. Wonderful and easy!

*** second review/attempt

1/3 toms and added two  zuchs. Family loved! Thank you!

TRIED TO FOLLOW RECIPE EXACTLY

Family was not impressed with how heavily tomato flavored this was. The photos look so differently then how mine turned out so I am not sure if it was user error.

I really liked this recipe, so easy.   I put everything, except corn, in the crockpot on low and we ate it 8 hours later.  LIke others i added a can of black beans.  I also used Trader Joe's Fire Roasted frozen peppers and onions.  At the end I split the soup into two parts and added shredded rotisserie chicken to one of the pots for the carnivores in the family.  Served it with cornbread and a salad.  Very easy way to feed a group of people on a busy weekend.

Made some changes but it's a good base. I used a can of diced tomatoes, fresh onions, and fresh bell peppers. I put the soup in my crockpot for about five hours on low instead of the 30 minutes.

Delicious soup! I did, however, make some changes. First, I cooked mine in a slow cooker.  I used three fresh bell peppers and one fresh onion. I cooked them a bit before adding them to the slow cooker. I only used two cans of chile peppers and substituted chili powder for the cumin. I added some black beans and shredded chicken. It cooked overnight and was so so good! I think it is the best tortilla soup i've ever made! LOVED IT!

This is amazing with the following alterations for extra deliciousness and veganness:
1) add 1-2 yukon gold potatoes (works well to cut them into small pieces and cook until soft in the pot before adding the other ingredients.
2) Instead of plain green chiles, use 1 jar of 505 green chile salsa
2.5) Since the salsa contains tomatoes, use a 15oz instead of 28oz can of additional tomatoes
3) Skip the onions (if you're like me and avoiding high FODMAP ingredients)
4) Skip the cheese (unnecessary calories IMHO, even if I were not a vegan)
5) Pan fry Beyond Meat chicken strips in soy sauce and lime juice until delicious. Cut up and add to the soup about 10 minutes before taking it off the heat.

Yummy hot filling soup! Feeling a little under the weather so I tried this dish. I used a fresh red pepper, and onion, 1 can of green chilies, fire roasted tomatoes, a can of rinsed black beans and a  habanero spice blend, topped with avocado.  No cheese so as to keep it vegan. Was really good and I'll  definitely make it again!

I tried this recipe for a soup potluck knowing we had a vegetarian attending. Everyone loved it. I added ground chipotle (1 tsp) for more flavor. Would definitely make again.

This soup was very good!  Based on some of the reviews complaining  a little about the kick this soup brings, I decided to use less of the green chiles.  While my wife loved the soup, I think I would make the soup again with the exact recipe because it turned out a little too bland with less of the green chilies.  Very easy recipe that I will keep in rotation!

I stayed true to the recipe for the most part. I added a can of black beans and I used fresh peppers and onions instead of frozen.   The 3 cans of green chile was perfect. I forgot to get the avocado and had to skip that.  I will add that next time.  I used fiesta blend cheese, tortilla chips, fresh squeezed lime juice, fresh cilantro, and sour cream for the topping. The lime juice and cilantro took it to a whole new dimension of flavor. I will definitely use this recipe again and play around with other ingredients. My daughter wanted the 'grilled cheese and tomato soup' effect so she did a grilled fresh mozzarella cheese sandwich on Ciabatta rolls.

VERY delicious!!!
Use one or two cans green chilies, it'll definitely be PLENTY spicey hot!
I simply put a handful of tortilla chips in the bottom of your bowl/cup & pour soup over rather than put chips into the soup itself.
(**I added a can of white hominy, as well, to give it a little "bite"and a generous handful of chopped cilantro for additional color & flavor)
Great recipe!!!

I made this when my son and his vegetarian girlfriend came to visit. It is absolutely delicious. My non-vegetarian husband even loved it, which was a shocker. I added fresh bell peppers (red and green), used fresh onions, one can of mild green chiles, and subbed in some green enchilada sauce.  Yum.

This soup was quite bland. The substitutions I made were adding 1 lb of zucchini, frozen corn rather than canned, and adding a can of black beans. The result was too much liquid and more like a light vegetable soup.

loved it! i did adjust a few things based on my own preference though. I omitted bell peppers (hate them) and used fresh onion opposed to the frozen pepper and onion mix because that's what I had on hand. I also added black beans for protein, used vegan cheese and made my own tortilla chips by frying corn tortillas in oil. Absolutely delicious

I read several of the reviews before making this recipe and adjusted it based on comments.  This soup was served alongside chicken tortilla soup for a Cindo de Mayo lunch put on by our school's PTA for the staff during Teacher Appreciation Week.  The staff loved it and vegetarians and vegans appreciated having a meatless option.  I used 1 large white onion, 4 cloves of garlic, 3 bell peppers (red, yellow and orange), 2 7-oz cans of mild fire roasted chiles, a can of corn, a can of beans, a 28-oz can of crushed tomatoes, 64 oz of vegetable stock, and 3 T of cumin.  Yum!  Next time, if making it for my family, I would add a 2nd can of beans to give it a heartier texture as we enjoy more stewish consistency than brothy soup.  This is in between.

It was good!  I didn't have the cans of green chile peppers so I added 3/4 of one to the soup (I needed the last 1/4 for refried beans that I'm making).  I also added the corn into the soup and pureed it because that's my personal preference.  I served it over tortilla chips and topped it with green onion and cheddar cheese.  It could use some sour cream I think I'll add that next time I eat it.  Good soup!

Very yummy soup. It was easy to make with a little chopping and a good deal of can opening. I made a number of small modifications after reading some of the reviews and it turned out very flavorful.

Here are the alterations: I did not use the frozen peppers and onions. Instead, I used 2 saut√©ed white onions and 1 roasted green pepper along with a roasted poblano pepper. I added coriander to the spice roster. I used an ear of fresh corn, added a can of black beans, and also added the juice of a lime once it came to a boil. I used one 14oz can of crushed tomatoes and one 14oz can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes.

Once the soup was ready, I added crumbled Oaxacan cheese.

Soup's on!

I'm not sure what happened with this recipe. I usually love soups, and I usually eat vegetarian. It just didn't have flavor! I used plenty of salt, and I even added extra spices. It was watery and too plain.

I really do like the taste of the base but added a lot more to it to make it more hearty. I cooked the recipe as it said except for adding chiles (due to having young children ). I then added one can of black beans, half a bag of Morningstar Farms burger crumbles, one can or cream of corn, and some cooked rice. I also baked my own tortilla strips that were crunchy and made the soup more yummy. For garnish and taste, I added Cotija cheese sprinkled in. We throughly enjoyed this wholesome, hearty doctored up soup!

Loved this soup recipe and recommend it!  I substituted fresh peppers (green, yellow, orange, and red) in lieu of frozen vegetables  and homemade guacamole in lieu of chopped avocado, but otherwise I stayed true to the recipe. Next time I plan to add black beans.

Perfect as is, no changes made. This is one of our most favorite soups and I make it often. A must try! 

Quick update: I made this again today but I used a fresh yellow onion and a fresh green pepper instead of the frozen. I then threw all the ingredients (except the corn and no oil needed) in my slow cooker and cooked on high for about 4 hours. I then added the corn and cooked another hour.  Served with our favorite tortilla chips, cheddar cheese, avocado and a dollop of sour cream.  Super easy!  Thanks so much for a wonderful recipe!

This is one of my favorite recipes. However, I use fresh green pepper and onion and copious amounts of cumin, I love cumin! I used FIRE ROASTED TOMATOES and it makes this soup even tastier. I also like to add black beans along with the broth and only use 1 can of green chile.

I used this as a base...then added a can of stagg 4-bean chili and a few corn tortillas.....   They add a wonderful flavor and also thicken the broth.   I also add corn tortillas to my chilli...brings the flavor to a whole new level.

My kids loved this!  I did a fresh onion and organic frozen bell pepper strips as well as frozen corn vs canned.   I also added pinto beans. My daughter is allergic to dairy so we left off the cheese. We topped it with crushed blue tortilla chips and lots of fresh avocado.  Delicious!

You can also add Beans at the end and Oregano, I also top mine not only with the avocado but also shredded lettuce and diced radishes and Sour Cream.

I didn't have everything that the recipe called for, but it was a great last-minute dinner even without the full amount of peppers, green chiles and avocado. I would love to try it next time with the right proportions and the additions that some reviewers have made: 2 cans of black beans, some lime juice, cilantro, and maybe some sour cream (and I added about a 1/3 c. beer, which was lovely!)

I really liked this recipe. I took frozen I onion and bell pepper mix and saut√©ed them with 3 tsp garlic. While cooking I put a can of diced tomatoes, rotel and vegetable broth 8th a small crock pot and turned on medium heat. I added a cup of minced onion, celery, peppers and parley to the saut√©ed onion mix and let that cook. I added an addition 31st of garlic and a can of green chilis. I added the saut√©ed veggies to the crock pot and cooked for 2 hours. I spooned the some veggies from the crock pot into the food processor and blended. Added back to crock pot and cooked for an additional hour.  Took out more veggies into processor with tbsp of flour. Added back to crock pot with half bag of frozen southwest mix of corn, black beans and jalape√±os.  Delicious! !!!!!

This is a great simple recipe but it really needed black beans or some type of beans to fill it out. It was a bit watery for me before I added beans. And I also added some rice. I guess I just like a more hearty soup.

I made this for the first time tonight and it was a great base for tortilla soup.  I did make a few modifications starting with reducing the recipe for 3 servings.  I used fresh onions and peppers and added some cayenne pepper during the saut√© process.  I also added a can of rinsed black beans and I used frozen corn instead of canned corn.  I did use a little more broth as well.  After simmering, I took half of the soup and put it in my vitamix and did a 1/2 blend so it wasn't completely pureed but it was slightly chunky.  I then added it back to the pot and mixed well.  I topped the soup with Lime juice, cheddar cheese, avocado and a small little dollop of greek yogurt (instead of sour cream).  

Next time, I will probably add more corn and more cayenne for more of a kick.  I can definitely see myself going back to the recipe again and again.  It's a quick and easy weeknight meal.

Super good! I added black beans. I didn't think it was too spicy with the peppers. I think it had the perfect amount spice, even on the mild side. Maybe I'll add some red pepper flakes next time.

Awesome recipe. I threw in some liquid smoke, chili powder, paprika, a bay leaf, cinnamon, dried cilantro, and extra cumin/cayenne (but I love cumin a little too much I think). I also used fresh onion and pepper, and put some broccoli in as I had some extra from last nights meal. Had a nice smokey burn that grew slowly after the bowl was gone.

OUTSTANDING!!!! Fresh cilantro and lime were a great compliment. I whipped this up for my my dad, who is a tortilla soup aficionado, on a football Sunday and he loved it. Great recipe. I have already made this 3 more time and probably will about 30 times more next year.

I think this recipe was delicious. I did make some changes after reading other people's reviews. I added 2 cans of black beans, a tablespoon of chili powder and I used the petite diced tomatoes instead of crushed. I used 1 box of vegetable broth and added 3 cups of water and 1 1/2 vegetable bouillon cubes. I also only used 2 cans of chilis instead of 3  by suggestion of others because it would be too spicy. If you like spicy food, don't listen to these people. It was not spicy at ALL! Stick with 3 if you want some spice. But I will definitely be making this again!

I really love this recipe! As most of the reviews state, it is very forgiving. I changed up quite a few things, mostly because I didn't have some of them. I added some stir fry veggies because I love them, less cumin, Ortega chilies, a little less vegetable broth, stuff like that. But this is really easy and very delicious!

My husband and I are NOT vegetarians, but we still thought this was delicious. I used chicken broth instead of vegetable broth, because that was what I had on hand. I also reduced the green chiles to two cans, which was just right for us. Next time I would take others advice and add a can of black beans. Also, instead of corn chips, I think I would use corn tortillas, slice into quarters and baked until crispy, just to reduce the fat from the fried chips. I think I will also double this recipe and freeze half next time, just because it was that good!

This was delicious and very easy to make. I used only 1 1/2 tbsp. of cumin, 1 can of green chiles, and only about half the corn. The corn change was unintentional. I thought I had more than I did. I used frozen, not canned corn, as I don't like canned corn. I added a can of rinsed and drained black beans. Served with toppings for each person to add as desired - sour cream, grated Monterey jack, chopped avocado and baked tortilla chips. I forgot the lime, but will be sure to add it for leftovers. Thanks!

Delicious! I roasted fresh peppers in the oven. I used 2 cans of diced tomatoes (one with chiles) instead of crushed tomatoes. I added a bag of frozen corn and one can of rinsed black beans. I also added chopped cilantro (2 Tbs) and half of a lime. After cooking, I pureed half of the soup in a blender and then added it back to the remaining soup in the pot. This made the consistency of the soup perfect.

I got "mild" chilis. This was soooooo good & we didn't even have cheese! I bet it's even better with cheese & maybe sour cream (or plain--not vanilla--Greek yogurt)!

I thought this was okay. I didn't think it had enough oomph to it. I added a can of drained black beans. I did one can of green chiles (because we had a guest over who doesn't like overly spicy food) - but to compensate for my own serving, I added sliced jalapenos. The soup was made much better by the toppings (cheese, sour cream, avocados, jalapenos and cilantro), but I gave it three stars because I like my soup to be enhanced by toppings, but also able to be served on its own. Thanks for sharing!

I added a few touches of my own-mainly all organic.  Instead of 3 tbsp of cumin; I did 1.5tbsp cumin and 1.5tbsp chili powder. I added one can 14.5oz of diced tomatoes with no salt added and 14.5oz can of diced tomatoes with chile peppers. One can of diced jalape√±os and one can of chile peppers. More veggie broth. 2 cans of corn. 1 can of pinto beans. 1 can of black beans. This was my first time making kit and if you like spice (to clear your sinuses), you'll love this! I topped it with guacamole and sour cream. Great vegetarian soup! :)

I have made this several times now, and it is excellent every single time. I garnish with fresh cilantro and lime along with the cheese and tortilla chips. This is truly one of my favorite meals, and is incredibly easy to make. 

I am NOT a vegetarian nor am I vegan--this recipe is absolutely wonderful, and if you have a family member who needs to have a meat element, toss in some already-cooked chicken.

This was delicious! I halved this recipe because its way too much for just me and my husband and we still had leftovers. Served with tortilla chips and sour cream and it was super yummy! I would go easy on the cumin and green chiles unless you like a lot of spice.

This is delicious. I made the following changes.  I replaced the can green chiles w one poblano pepper ( roasted & diced). Added one small bag of sweet corn at the end when soup was done. Dash of mexican oregano. 2 cans of black beans rinsed. 1 whole dry ancho chile just threw it in. More garlic than it called for. Diced tomatoes ( Muir Glenn roasted tomatoes)  instead of crushed. Cook until ancho chile starts to fall apart. Cooked for abt 45 minutes.   Have made this several times. It's one of our favorites. Thank you for the recipe.

Awesome! Chopped a raw onion and I roasted a red & green pepper instead of using the frozen stir fry mix. Can't wait to try it reheated tomorrow!

This was amazing! My modifications: I used 1/2 large onion, 2 fresh red bell peppers, 2 roasted poblano peppers, and one 14.5 oz can of tomatoes, and used "Better than bouillon" vegetable base, added one can of black beans, and cut corn from 2 ears. My husband and I loved it very much. It is definitely something that I could take to get togethers, etc. I can't wait to make it again!

Yippee, I get to eat tortilla soup again! Not many chicken dishes I still craved after I stopped eating meat few years ago, but I would fondly look at chicken tortilla soup on Mexican menus. Mmm. This veg version hits the spot! The 1st time I made it, I didn't realize I was almost out of cumin so I only added 1T, plus 1t of chili powder. Delicious but felt it could use a bit more kick. The next week I made another batch, and I added 2T cumin (since reviewers thought 3T too much) plus the chili powder. Too much cumin. Next time I'll stick to just 1T cumin and kick up the chili powder to 1T. Both times used 3 cans of green chilis. It adds good flavor but not too much heat (I like my spice "medium"). Also, I'm not usually a garnish girl but def add the squeeze of lime (fresh, not bottled if have it) and the chips. Think of them as ingredients, necessary to the flavor! I also added avocado and will start adding beans. As is recipe is 4 stars but with a few tweaks, I'll make it regularly!

I tweaked it to my tastes, but is a great start. Before my mods of adding heat, I could serve to my parents and other who aren't as wild for spicy. I made half batch, added can of black beans, used fire roasted diced tomatoes & processed them first and even added a little brown rice. Sprinkled red pepper flakes and cilantro before brought to boil because I like more heat.

This recipe is awesome, quick and easy. I used frozen corn instead, fire roasted diced tomatoes and added black beans,   chili powder, cayenne pepper and a little chicken this time since I'm sure my boyfriend gets sick of veggie food. It's great either way and very easy to tweak to your likings. The cheese, sour cream and avocado compliment the soup perfectly.

Great recipe.  I stuck with the listed ingredients but couldn't find the frozen pepper and onion combo so I used fresh.  I also put in 1 less can of chillies but added a fresh jalapeno, okra and black beans and that's just because I had them.  Since I am a vegetarian I try and add protein wherever I can and this soup turned out fantastic.  I absolutely loved it and will be making more. Thank you for the recipe, it is a keeper

Pretty good recipe!  Next time for my family's tastes I will reduce the amount of cumin.  I used fresh peppers & onions rather than frozen.  I also left out the corn and added black beans.

I really liked it. The only changes I made were adding a couple of shakes of chili powder as it was simmering, and adding a tbsp of lime juice at the end. Though I did like the convenience of the frozen peppers and onions, I think I might use fresh next time I make it.

This recipe was a great starting point for tortilla soup. I followed the advice of previous reviewers and used 2 cans diced tomatoes (one was mexican style fire roasted and one regular) instead of crushed tomato and used only about 16 oz of vegetable broth, as we prefer thicker soups. Since I reduced my overall volume, I added only 8 oz of green chiles but threw in about 1-1.5 tsp of fresh diced jalapeno. I also added about half a can of black beans and only 1 tbsp or so of cumin. There was plenty of delicious flavors, and we topped each bowl with some shredded cheese, tortilla chips, and avocado. My non-vegetarian husband said it was the best tortilla soup he's ever had! This recipe it definitely a keeper!

this soup was a hit with our guests and kids. followed reviewers' recommendations and reduced recipe to 2 cans green chiles and 2 tbsp cumin. added two cans black beans for some heft, and used fresh peppers and onion. i will add the cumin and chiles back in for my next batch because we all ended up adding tobasco to spice things up. used two boxes veggie broth which resulted in a bit more liquid, but it was tasty. served some shredded chicken breast on the side for my meat-eaters to add, and they said that worked out fine. on the whole it was easy to make and fun to eat and we'll be having this again soon! thanks for the awesome recipe and all the helpful advice.

Loved it. Although I agree three cans of chiles would be too spicy for my taste so I used two cans of tomatoes with chiles already in them. Definitely add black beans to it to make it heartier.

I love this recipe.  It works great in the crock pot as well.  I did decrease the green chiles and used 2 cans and less cumin.  I also used frozen corn and fresh peppers and onions.  I add soaked black beans in the crock pot so they cook all day.  It adds a bit of protein.  I am vegan so no cheese but I love this!  It is very popular with friends and family!

Family of 6 (including a vegan) tore this up for dinner!  I made the following changes due to what I had: 2 14 oz cans of diced tomatoes (vs large cann of crushed), 2 4 oz cans of chiles (vs 3), 1 tablespoon (vs 3) of cumin, 1 can of black beans & 1 can of corn (added them with the broth/stock), 1 32 oz vegetable stock & 1 32 oz of vegetable broth (only because that is what I had).

We poured the soup over the tortilla chips and garnished with shredded Mexican-blend cheese, sour cream, avocadoes & hot sauce.  My daughter used vegan equivalent for the cheeses & sour cream. Cilantro would have looked & tasted great, but I didn't have any.

Perfecto!

We thought this was pretty good.  We will probably make it again, but not very frequently.  Followed the directions, but substituted some fresh ingredients from our garden rather than use the canned tomatoes and chili peppers.  It was spicy, but we like spicy.

I like adding hot sauce or tobasco to raise the heat. Also extra cayenne pepper and cumin.

This recipe was DELICIOUS! I made a few changes: used 1 can of black beans, added some cayenne pepper to give it a kick, I didn't have enough vegetable broth so I just substituted water and it tasted fine (I added the water from the canned beans and corn). I also topped with a tablespoon of light Sour Cream and it was SO good! It's all I've been eating since I made it! I'd like to try lime juice next time but I enjoyed this recipe VERY much! Thank you!

This was a hit with my family, even my 5 yr old!  I didn't add as much green chilies and I did add chicken (yes I know that it's not vegetarian then!) but it was a great start!

Oh yes, we love this recipe. My roommates and I weigh in at two vegetarians and three omnivores. Everyone eats this- and eats it for consecutive meals til it's gone. Some like to put the chips in the bottom of the bowl (as recommended), others like them on top. Everyone likes having a large bag of tortilla chips we munch on once our bowls are empty.

I only used 1 hot pepper and it was more than enough. Wonderful! Add some pinto beans for protein and you're set. I used as many fresh vegetables as possible too.

This is one of our favorite rainy day recipes.    The only variation we made is to add taco seasoning before you bring it to a boil.  About 1 tablespoon.

Super easy and super yummy. I omitted the avocado and added some chili powder to give it a little smokiness. Will definitely be making this again soon!

I loved this soup!!  I did alter it a little:  I used 1 green bell pepper and 1 medium onion, 1 clove of garlic, 2 cans of chile peppers, 3 cans of vegetable broth and 1 cup water, and added a can of drained/rinsed black beans.  I tried it with the avacado and wasn't a fan so I'll leave that out next time.  I will be making this soup again (and again).  Thanks!

SIMPLY DELICIOUS!  Such a beautiful mix of flavors and so savory.  To make it a meal I added a can of black beans and since cilantro is always used in this house it was thrown on top too :)  Thanks for the great recipe!

I tried this soup tonight and it's pretty good. I used chilli ready tomatoes because I didn't have any cans of green chilli peppers. I also added some black beans.  It was easy to make and tasted great ... definitely making this one again!

My family loves this soup. I have made it several times with fresh peppers and onions. I use a little less cumin and add chili powder and garlic pepper. I also add mushrooms and black beans. I recommend a little less green chile peppers so it is not too spicy.

This is a great soup!  I used fresh peppers and onion, I also added a can of black beans for protein.  I liked the suggestions for a splash of lime, so I did that too.  I cut down the amount of canned chiles to 1, but it would be good probably with a second can.  My meat-loving partner (who ranches part-time) absolutely raves about this vegetarian recipe!

Made the recipe as written but only used 2 cans of chilis based on reviews.  Next time I will use all 3 as it needed a little more spice.  I ended up adding some chipotle powder to make up for the lack of chilis and it was a very tasty addition.  A squeeze of fresh lime juice and a dollop of sour cream completed this tasty tasty soup!

This was great!  I used olive oil, diced a zucchini, onion, red and yellow pepper, yellow squash, used one can Chicken broth and three veggies, added a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes as well as the crushed, two cans green chiles, one can black beans.  It was awesome and I got rave reviews for it, I think you could do just about anything with this recipe as the base and it would be great, thanks for sharing!!

For what it is, this is pretty good! I think I would have liked it even more if I had used a medium salsa, but I stuck with mild for the kids. We love chicken so would probably add chicken the next round, but for vegetarian this had lots of flavor and was really easy to make!

This is an amazing soup!  My husband and I both loved it.  The only thing I did differently was making half the recipe (big mistake...we fought over who got to bring the leftovers for lunch the next day.)  I totally agree with the reviewer who suggested using the "Hint of Lime" tortilla chips.  Also, I used "mild" canned chilis and I could have used a bit more spice.

I love tortilla soup, and was so pleased to find this recipe for a veggie version. I followed most of the recipe, however I think it would be much better if you use fake chicken broth that can be found in the kosher food section of the grocery store. I had to add more hot sauce, and I also added a 14 oz can of black beans. Finally, I topped it off with sour cream and scallions.

This is the easiest and best tasting soup that I have made!  Like others, I used only one can of the green chilies and that was plenty.  I also added a generous handful of fresh cilantro roughly chopped right before serving.  I used fresh peppers and onions and cooked them only a short while so that when I served the soup they still had some bite to them.  Also, to decrease the fat and salt content, I used a pizza cutter to slice some soft flour tortillas into strips, put them on a baking sheet and sprayed them with Pam.  I then sprinkled some garlic powder on them and baked them at 450 for about 5 minutes or until crispy.  Everyone in the family enjoyed this!

This is an excellent, simple, delicious recipe!  I followed the recipe exactly except I used 1 each fresh red and green bell peppers instead of frozen, and I used Trader Joe's grilled frozen corn instead of canned.  It was outstanding!!!  I thought the 3 tablespoons of cumin was going to be too much, but I think it's the cumin that gives this soup its rich flavor.  Next time I make it I will probably add a chopped jalapeno (my family likes spicy), and maybe a pound of ground turkey since we aren't vegetarians.  Thank You for sharing this recipe.   Vicki

I'm not one to change around recipes, but I thought this might be too bland if I made it as is.  I diced up and added 2 jalapenos for more heat and also added a 10 oz can of red enchilada sauce.  I agree with most of the other reviews and this had too much cumin in it.  I think 1 1/2 tablespoons would have been plenty.  I also left out one can of green chilis and that seemed perfect.  Lastly, I put about half the soup in the blender to give it a thicker consistency.  The flavor was great, but I'm not sure if it would have been as good without the changes.  Very easy to make and this recipe can be tweaked to your personal taste.

Delicious tortilla soup - definitely a keeper and I've been looking for one forever.  I substituted 1 T coriander for one of the cumin teaspoons, used mild fire-roasted green chiles, and left out the corn.  I blended the soup in batches to make it smooth, then added home-baked corn tortilla strips plus diced avocado & cheese for garnish.  YUM - a big hit with the whole family.

I thought the soup was very good.  I think that you need the 3 cans of green chile peppers to give it some kick.  I also added cilantro just before serving.

I though it was a 5 star with the changes i made. I used  1T Cumin, 8 oz of green chile, 32 oz of vegetable broth, frozen corn, and a can of black bean!!! And it was great!!! and it was super easy!

Delicious!!! This is my new favorite soup! My family loved it (everyone- 13 people in all- 7 of them children)! Very quick and easy to make, too. I added a pound of groud turkey for protein (I browned it at the beginning then added garlic and onions and peppers), used a bag of frozen corn instead of canned, and I squeezed some lime and sprinkled some chopped cilantro as a garnish when I served it. I loved the chopped avacado, too!

This came out great.  Used fresh peppers and onions and saut√©d em for a while.  Used frozen corn so i added it earlier than recommended and let it cook with the other ingredients for the majority of the cook time.  I don't think the cheese added a lot (especially as i prefer vegan-friendly recipes).  Avocado is a MUST!  Try adding some Cholula (or other) hot sauce if u likey it HOT!

Fantastic flavor. I did sub. 1 large diced onion + 1/2 diced peppers. Used 1/2 jr. of green salsa instead of chile peppers.  Added one can black beans. Only had a little over 2 T cumin on hand. Delish!!!! Even my 4 yr olds liked it with extra beans, cheese, chips of course.

I added some things to this soup that i thought would give it more texture. I added fake ground meat as well as a fiesta mixed bean mix. I felt this gave it a great bite, however it didn't turn into a chili. I put it over tortilla chips with some cheese and sour cream on top..YUM!

My whole family loved this recipe.  It was so easy to make.  I followed others and only added 2 cans of the green chilis and also used fresh peppers and onions.  Super tasty and will definitely be making it again:)

Great flavor but the tortilla chips were soggy and not so appealing.  I used a fresh onion, green pepper and tomato instead of the frozen package and can that was called for.

This was very good.  I also only used 2 cans of chilis and added black beans to the recipe.  I was unable to find frozen onions and peppers, so I found the corn in the freezer section w/ those included and added them at the end.  It worked perfect.

Love this soup!!! You can easily add other ingredients you like. Our family likes to add black beans. For a non vegetarian version add meat and it works great too. This has become a family favorite.

Very good, I only used 1 tablespoon of cumin and 1 can of green peppers and the flavor was just right.  I also used about 16 oz of broth but would probably use 20 next time and skip the corn.  I like tortilla soup to have more of a broth consistancy like it does in Mexico.

Tasty soup.  It is hearty and easy to make. Very nice on a cold night. I did add torn 2 corn tortillas when I sauteed the pepper and onion to make it thicker.  I served it with the flautas recipe from allrecipes.  Good meal.

This was really tasty! I also made a few changes like some of the other reviews suggested. I added a can of drained and rinsed seasoned black beans and 3 cans of veg broth and 1 can of chicken. The recipe called for 3 tablespoons of cumin but I added only about 2 1/2 teaspoons of it. Maybe the 'tablespoon' bit is a typo? It just seems like that would be way to much but maybe I'm just missing out on something! Tasted fresh and hearty at the same time. Will definitely do again.

This soup is fabulous if you make it exactly as the recipe states! Usually I am only a good cook if I am following exact steps and ingredients. But this soup is one thing that I can also play with, adding or subtracting things and it always comes out amazing.

Cooked this for a party - people got 2nds and 3rds until it was completely gone. It made my Mexican friend homesick though because it was similar but not quite like home-style due to ingredients not available in the US.

This is absolutely the best soup I've ever had. My entire family loves it! I make a few enhancements as noted by previous cooks...I add: one or two cans of black beans, 2 T. cumin, fresh pepper and onion instead of frozen, two veggie cubes (Knorr), fresh cilantro, the juice from one lime, and (only) ONE chipotle pepper from a can.  I puree the soup somewhat before adding corn and black beans.

This has practically become a staple in our home.  The kids love it right along with me.  I use fresh onions and Trader Joe's frozen tri-color pepper strips (I chop them up a bit); I add a can of rinsed black beans. And I also use the Trader Joes frozen roasted corn - very yummy.  Last time I made it I tried using Rotel tomatoes with chilis (and omitted the 3 cans of chilis) which I pureed first; it made the soup spicier - good for me, not for the faint of heart.

I made this according to recipe, and everybody at my art group LOVED it :) It was delicious and every bit as good, if not better, than chicken tortilla soups I've had in the past - The avocado is HIGHLY recommended, as is lots of cheese if you aren't vegan - keeps in the fridge really well too :) Thanks!

This recipe is easy to make and it's yummy!  I followed some suggestions listed below....used diced canned tomatoes, added black beans, and provided lots of choices for toppings.  Topping choices:  sour cream, shredded mexican cheese mix, avocado, chopped cilantro, lime, and tabasco. Since I wanted to keep it vegetarian, there was also chopped chicken and meatless chicken.

This is such a great recipe!! I find myself making it almost weekly! My boyfriend is vegetarian, and has been looking for an alternative to chicken tortilla soup - this one is it! I have to say it is very hearty and filling, and if you have to have meat in this, it's pretty easy to toss some in :-)
Definitely like it best with soem kind of beans or tempeh.

This was easy to prepare, healthy and delicious.  I added a little cayenne pepper and and squeezed a little lime juice - two of my favorite flavors.

I followed the directions and it came out perfect! The second time I made it I added zuchini, and I will do this from now on. It made it a bit chunkier. Best soup recipe I have ever made!

This was a great soup.  Very easy and healthy.  I followed the recipe exactly except added a squeeze of lime juice into each persons serving.  I ate the leftovers for days.

This soup was so good to my surprise. I didn't have corn so used black beans instead and they worked very well, also added some fresh chopped jalapeno peppers. I wasn't too sure about serving over tortilla chips, so added a few crushed on top and boy to they ever make the soup taste so good.

I followed the advice of some of the other reviewers and cut back on the cumin. I only used 1 tsp. and it was very flavorful, but not spicy. I used frozen corn instead of canned to reduce the sodium content and I didn't bother with the avocado or cheese because it tasted terrific without it.

This was ok, not a vegetarian, maybe that makes a difference?  I prefer the skinny tortilla soup from Light & Tasty (which can be made vegetarian).

This soup KNOCKED MY SOCKS OFF!  My girls even begged me to make it once a week!  I read the reviews...cut down the cumin to 2T, used fresh green peppers & onion flakes, no fresh avocado so we each had a dollop of guacamole on top of the soup with a sprinkling of cheddar cheese!  Also used only one can of chiles, and used Lay's Baked Tortillas.

I'm on Weight Watchers, and the soup (with guac, cheese & chips) only came to three points!  And that was SUPPER!  And Lord, I was so full.  LOL!

This is earmarked to become a forever family favourite!

This soup is a rager. It would probably
hold up as a cold soup sans chips. We
made it w/ olive oil and 3 medium 
chopped onions (she doesn't do peppers).
We cut up corn tortillas, sprayed them 
w/ some olive oil and put them in a 400¬∫
oven. Even making it as low-sodium and
low fat (no cheese) as possible it was
completely awesome and we ate way too
much. You really can't go wrong w/ this.
I read one reviewer who thought it was
too hot, the only thing I can think of
is make sure you're using canned chilis
and not canned jalepe√±os.
Cheers.
-Steve

Very delicious.  I added a little chili powder and more cumin than called for, and about a tablespoon of crushed cilantro.  I also added a little more of the crushed tomatoes and black beans for protein.  A dollop of sour cream on top, and it's perfect!

This was a wonderful soup.  I cut the recipe in half, added a can of drained black beans and 2 tsp of cumin.  I also used chopped onions in place of the onion/pepper stir fry mix.  I would make again...mmmm...mmmm.

This recipe was a little disappointing to me.  It was okay, but it tasted a like a good-quality canned soup, not a homemade soup.  I think this happened because there are so many canned ingredients and the peppers and onions are frozen.  Next time I will use fresh onions and peppers instead of the stir-fry mix.  It definitely has potential, but needs some tweeking.

I love, love, love this recipe!! I sautee chopped zucchini and sqaush with the onion and bell pepper, for a heartier soup. Also, I like to use half diced tomato and half puree (or crushed). It's really tasty if you garnish it with cilantro and lime juice. So good, definitely a keeper.
