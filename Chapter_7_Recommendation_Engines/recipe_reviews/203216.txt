Really good tasting muffin!  I used WW flour instead of AP flour.  The blueberries really made these muffins moist and for my taste I think it had too many blueberries as it went mushy.  So, next time I will decrease the berries.  The orange flavour was really nice and delicate, it didn't overpower the  bran muffin. We really liked this muffin.  Thx.

I did not have sour cream so I substituted blueberry yogurt.  Tasted great.  I agree with the review that said to add less blueberries.  2/3 of a cup is great.  Also when I used medium muffin liners I was able to get 12 muffins.  
You could exchange the fruit also.  Ive made it with raspberries and cranberries as well.

These muffins came out wonderful.  The only change I had to make was to sub wheat bran for the oat bran.  For the life of me, I couldn't find any oat bran, except Kellogg's Cracklin Oat Bran, but that had cinnamon and nutmeg in it, plus it would have had to be crushed.  For her Christmas present, I gave my daughter a "snack of the month".  This month's theme was Bran, and these went into that package.  I had to bake them 18 minutes.  I used a large navel orange.  You can really taste the orange in them.  I used frozen blueberries, and did not thaw them before adding them to the flour.  These muffins really are good.  I recommend them.

I love these! I did have to sub a bit. My husband is diabetic so I used WW Pastry Flour instead of AP. I thought I had blueberries, but only had blackberries. Luckily, they were really sweet. I cut them in half. My middle son also ate my last orange, so I had to sub a sweet grapefruit. I only used 1/3 cup of brown sugar & added 1/3 a cup of Splenda. They are nutty, moist & flavorful. This will be my go to healthy muffin from now on. Endless possibilities. Thanks for sharing!

I appreciate so much a healthy, but still very delicious, recipe. Like this one! It is light, moist, and full of flavor. I used dried wild blueberries rather than fresh, but otherwise followed the recipe. I'll be making these often.

Good.  Kinda mushy.  I don't think it's the blueberries, since for me a cup didn't overwhelm; I think it's the bran.  It's just not going to absorb liquid the way flour does.  (Also, I used coconut oil, which is a soft solid at room temp, so that might have affected the texture, too.)  Still, the flavors are nice, and they're relatively healthy!  Thanks!

Great recipe! But, I made quite a few changes:
2/3 cup blueberries (frozen) 
splenda instead of sugar
2 Tbsp oil
2 Tbsp applesauce
yogurt instead of sour cream
1 whole orange (blended)
1 1/2 cups wheat bran, no oat bran

Delicious and healthy :) They are quite moist, so make sure you don't under cook them.

We LOVED this! I added a splash of vanilla extract, used 1 cup crushed bran flakes instead of wheat bran (b/c that's what I had), white whole wheat flour, and a combo of honey and brown sugar.  They are very sweet! This is great.  You definitely need to follow the instructions on letting the batter sit for 10 min.  This will let the oat and wheat bran absorb into the liquid and will prevent the sogginess some people had trouble with.

I made these for the first time...they are DELICIOUS!  My 4.5 year old son and husband RAVED!  I used 1.5 cups of frozen wild blueberries as fresh is not an option yet!  Very good, I will make these again for sure.

These were very good.  I only had 3/4 cup of white flour left so I topped it up with 1/4 cup of whole wheat flour.  Would make again.

DELICIOUS.  I didn't have sour cream so I used blueberry yogurt, as one reviewer suggested, and I didn't have fresh blueberries so used 1/2 cup frozen.  Even my super-picky 2-year-old loved them.

Very good. I ground down some Quick oats instead of using oat bran and it worked great. I think these will make a yummy breakfast with yogurt.

These muffins are delicious.  I followed the recipe exactly, and maybe it was just my oven, but I had to bake them about 5 minutes longer.  They are not too sweet and make a wonderful morning breakfast.  They reheat really well too.  I give them 5 stars!

I make these regularly, using the wheat bran leftover from sifting my freshly ground wheat. I use freshly ground white whole wheat flour (not sifted), and yogurt in place of the sour cream. Occasionally I need a little extra yogurt, since the WW flour is more dense, but they always turn out great! A full cup of blueberries is a bit too much for us -- 2/3 cup is plenty.

Fabulous healthy muffin! Moist, great texture and perfectly sweetend. I made a few adjustments ... used All-Bran cereal for the wheat bran (just let it soak longer)... and only had two measly tangerines for juice, so I added a heaping tablespoon on orange marmalade. Used apple butter for half of the oil to cut down on the fat. Great! Will definately make again. Even my kids loved it!

These were the best bran muffins I've ever made.  Soaking the bran in the sour cream & milk must have really moistened up the batter so they were not dry like all other bran muffins I have made.  I did have to add about 1/4 or 1/3 c. of flour to thicken the batter up a little;  otherwise it was more like pancake batter.  That's probably because I had just washed and drained the blueberries so they were very wet.  But my family is raving about these and wants more.  Thanks so much!

These were truly delicious! Not mushy at all as others have suggested. I had to make some changes only because of what I had available, but I think I would make the exact same changes next time! 1. Used vanilla Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. 2. Used lemon juice/zest instead or orange (only about half a lemon juice because I was afraid of the mush factor) 3. Did not have oat bran so I ground up quick oats in the food processor and it worked great! 4. Added some chia seeds. 5. Also added a strussel topping (2tbs butter, 1/3 c brown sugar, 1/4c flour, 1 tbs cinnamon).  Seriously so good. My 6 and 3 year olds loved them too!

This is a very tasty muffin. I made it as stated and it was great.  The second time I made it I followed some of the other suggestions and I used Whole Wheat flour instead of all purpose flour, 3/4 cup blueberries and only half of a navel orange for the juice and zest. With these changes it made them fantastic. I think I might try clementines next time. I now make this once a week instead of my banana muffins.

This is a great recipe.  I had to make some alterations out of necessity.  I didn't feel like driving across town for the oat and wheat bran... so I used All Bran cereal.  I did double the recipe and they turned out great.  I also substituted buttermilk for the sour cream & milk... which turns out to be essentially the same ingredient.  I also added blueberries (fresh)... and did use the orange zest and juice (fresh)... DELISH!

these are delicious.  made it with applesauce instead of the oil, fat free sour cream and skim milk.  it was perfect.  you need to let it sit the 10 minutes so the brans absorb the liquid.  will make again- may add mashed bananas next time.

Substituted chopped dates for the blueberries - delicious! I like the subtle orange flavouring. Found they were moist but not too mushy, although they needed the full 20min baking time.

Reduced blueberries to 1/2 cup and used gluten-free flour.  My four neighbors (&I) loved them.  Next time, I will add chopped nuts & dried cranberries.

Have made this a number of times. They are always moist and delicious.  I puree a whole cara cara orange (including peel) and sometimes add a little bit of orange juice so consistency is just a little bit thinner than a milkshake.

I made the recipe as listed.   It was delicious,  nice and moist.   I loved the hint of orange.   The family also loved them.

Just took these out of the oven and they are delicious!   I followed the recipe as it is written except I may have added an extra tablespoon of oat bran because that's how much I had.  So glad I doubled the batch.  A little bit of a pain to make but totally worth it!

The only change I made was to use vanilla Greek yogurt in place of the sour cream, because that's what I had.  The muffins were absolutely delicious, and I will definitely be making them again.

These were awesome! My 3 year old daughter helped me make these, she was so eager to help, that I think some of the ingredients were a little off, and even then they turned out delicious! I did add 1 tablespoon of cinnamon, because I love it, and added about 8 more minutes to baking time. Will be making these often, as both my hubby and daughter loved them! Thank you!!

Really good recipe. The only change I made was to use applesauce instead of oil. They turned out really great! I can't wait to make them again!

I used 1 c. bran and 1 1/2 c. flour, and melted butter instead of oil (I try to avoid refined oils).  I also had to add more milk, but I live at a high altitude and often adjust by increasing the liquid.  They turned out moist, delicious, and not mushy.

These are the best bran muffins, and I've tried a lot of recipes. I do make a few alterations, but they are very tasty either with or without the alterations. I use 1 1/2 cups wheat bran and omit the oat bran (it's just easier to find in the store). I also sub whole wheat flour for the all purpose flour. Last, I add 2 TBSP of flax meal to the wheat bran. If you can find boreal blueberries (I buy them frozen at Trader Joes), they are perfect for this recipe. They are a smaller blueberry and work well in muffins.

You NEED to let these sit at least 8 hours before taking a bite, trust me on this. Although they smell wonderful right out of the oven, they won't taste good until they have had time to sit and let the flavors meld. 

These muffins freeze very well. Just pull one out of the freezer at night and let thaw in the fridge or counter and they are perfect for breakfast the next day.
