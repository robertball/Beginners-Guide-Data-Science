I have taken the time to make this recipe and can honestly say it was worth it! The different flavors of the vegetables and herbs mixed with my favorite fruit, mango, really makes this salsa come together. It's the best I have ever had. My family is consists of picky eaters and I'm already requested to make more. :)
