This is my first experience with a turkey rueben.  I LOVE traditional ruebens and was always turned off by a turkey/slaw version...until now!  These are fantastic!

Super easy and absolutely delicious and refreshing.  I make my own thousand island dressing.  DH says it doesn't really taste like a true rueben but he loved it anyway.  thanks for sharing.

I tried these as wraps and they worked well, but I much prefer using all of the ingredients but using Rye bread and grilling it like a traditional Reuben. Grilled rye bread is a unique flavor that can't be substituted. I love the Cole Slaw in this recipe and have made it a bunch of times!

these are really good, but I didn't think they worked well to make ahead.  By the time lunch came around they were pretty soggy and drippy.  But I did like the flavor and the crunch.

These are a great summer lunch or dinner for my family. They're a jazzed up version of a standard turkey wrap, which my kids can get tired of. The coleslaw provides a nice crispy texture. Would I call these Reubens/Rachels? No. But they're tasty and we eat them every other week in the summer. I've only ever made them an hour or two ahead of time, so I can't say whether or not they'd be good after several hours.

I wouldn't necessarily call this a rueben. It IS a delicious sandwich though. The coleslaw is the bomb!  In fact, my hubby couldn't keep his fork out of the bowl. I will be making the coleslaw as a side by itself for sure. 
This sandwich reminded me of a Pittsburgh original sandwich from the restaurant, Primanti Brothers. This one doesn't have french fries, but i didnt miss them. Eat n Park restaurants in our area make a Pittsburgh sandwich that is very much like this. I always wondered why their special slaw was salmon colored and so delish....now i know!

I served ours on  toasted bread with a slice of bacon and avocado.....like a club sandwich. 

Enjoy!!!!
