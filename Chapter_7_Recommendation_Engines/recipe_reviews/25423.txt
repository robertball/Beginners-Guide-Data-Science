I've cooked this dish twice and I also doubled the rice each time.  The first time I cooked it, my family liked it but I thought it needed more flavor. The second time I cooked it, it was Christmas dinner for fourteen people so I made some modifications.  I doubled the rice, left out the celery and mushrooms, used 2 cans of chicken broth,instead of three;I used two cans of cream of celery, two cans cream of mushroom, one can cream of chicken. I also added a dash of cayenne pepper. Since I don't like chicken breast, I boiled,deboned and cut up six drumsticks and threw it in. Everyone loved it including my finicky 18-year-old nephew who even asked to take some home!

After reading one of the other reviews I decided to double the rice which did give it more of a casserole consistancy.  I also tripled the chicken. There is no way these perportions yield 8 servings.  the flavor, however, was very nice.  I served it to a party of 6 adults and 5 small children and everyone enjoyued it; even the kiddies.

so easy and comforting. Used 2 cups of the rice and 900ml of chicken stock, and no soup. Added black pepper, paprika and thyme. Added carrots, mushrooms and spinach - would definately add lots of veg. grated a little bit of parm and moz cheese on top. took exactly 1.5 hours to cook, covered.

This was good. I added some pork lion in mines also, only because I thought it was chicken I was thawing out. So I had chicken, sausage, and pork lion. I also added seasons. Was very imperessed.

I modified this a bit based on the ingredients I had. I used ground chicken only vs. both chicken breast AND pork. I used Health Requests Creams of Mushroom, Chicken and Celery. I did not have celery. I also used regular rice vs. wild rice. This is a great, easy, low cost recipe that is very filling and can be easily modified.

I made it exactly like to recipe except I used two boxes of rice mix and added the seasoning packets that came with the rice mix.  It was pretty salty.  Next time I will leave out one or both of the seasoning packets.

A great casserole.  I had a 1.5lb of ground pork (no way was I leaving .5lb of meat to sit in my freezer) so I used that and per other reviews, used 2 6oz pkgs of long grain and wild rice.  Other than those two changes, I left all the same. I stirred occasionally while baking and this turned out great! Very filling and good. Thanks Kathleen! I will make this again!

This is my new favorite.  Although there is a little prep time, it is well worth it.  I've served appox. 12 people and only had good responses.

WOW this is scrumptious, according to my DH. He LOVED it!!!! I added 2 packages of rice to it, as other other readers suggested, and left out the almonds. but other than that, it is great. I cooked it for 1 1/2 hours and it was perfect!!! Soooo good... thanks for the recipe... Updated 3/31/08, just to add, this was salty, probably too much so, but I think that could be taken care of by adding just one of the packets of the seasoning mixes that comes with the rice, instead of adding two. Just a thought - I will do that next time I make this, and there WILL be a next time!!!

This was pretty good. A nice, hot, filling meal. I doubled the amount of rice like suggested(I think it is necessary) and added fresh chopped mushrooms since I didn't have any canned.I also added some red pepper flakes to the sausage as mine didn't have any spice to it. Overall, a great weekday meal.

This was not a casserole. It was more of a rich, soup consistancy. Although my son liked it, the rest of us thought it should be renamed "Chicken Sausage Barforama"!

I halved the recipe as there are only 2 of us. I did use the whole 6 oz box of rice, as other suggested doubling the rice, and I think it was a good ratio. (I wasn't sure whether to use the rice seasoning packet or not-- so I used 1/2 of it.) I also used probably 1 1/2 chicken breast halves, which turned out very moist. I used linguica sausage (instead of the pork sausage) and used fresh mushrooms (rather than canned) as I happened to have these on hand.   Overall very good, we kept going back for more.  Definitely a keeper.  I served green beans as a side dish, next time I might try putting them in the casserole for some color as well.

This was great. I only had regular sausage so I chopped it up and used it instead, I didn't even have to double the rice like some others suggested.

I also cut down on the ammount of chicken broth(used about 2 1/2 cups). I added some fennel seed, since it was not in my sausage, red pepper flakes as suggested and since I did not have mushrooms; I added a can of sliced water chestnuts. It as a real suprise when you found the cruchy pieces. My husband said this is a keeper. Thanks for the recipe

An excellent chicken casserole! Like others I used three chicken breasts and added 1tsp herb d' provence. I used two boxes of UB wild rice with the seasoning packets. Instead of using almonds I covered the top with Frenches fried onions for the last five minutes to brown them. Thanks Kathleen!

Turned out great - big hit.
I did make the following substitutions:
1 lb spicy smoked sausage instead of ground sausage.  I just sliced it up and added it to the chicken & vegetables after they had been cooking for a while in the skillet.
used 2 cans of cream of mushroom (didn't have cream of chicken on hand).
Also doubled the rice amount - I had one 6 oz pkg of UB then doubled that with some brown rice.
As I said - turned out great.  I'll make this again!

I gave this four stars even though it was practically inedible because I used 2 boxes of UB wild rice as recommended but I also used both seasoning packets which was a giant mistake. The dish was SO SALTY I couldn't eat it. But others liked it, so go figure. I would use only 1 or none of the seasoning packets as the condensed soup should add plenty of flavor.

Also, I used a 9x9 baking pan, and just continued to simmer the rest on the stove and both turned out the same. I liked the consistency and texture, just not the saltiness :p

This was excellent!!! I made this for a dinner party and it was a huge hit. I used two boxes of the rice mixture, used three chicken breasts, used 1 1/2 pounds of sausage, and used two cans of chicken broth, just under three cups. It turned out perfect.  Even the pickiest eaters loved this casserole. I will definately be making this on a regular basis from now on.

I enjoyed this recipe with a few modifications. I used two boxes of Uncle Ben's Wild Rice (4 oz size) and used the flavor packets also. I used 3 chicken breast halves instead of two. I added some seasoned bread crumbs to the top also. Yum!! This is a definite keeper!

This was great.  I too doubled the rice and instead of almonds I sprinkled cheese on top after it was done and put it back in the oven for a few minutes.  I was surprised at how the flavors really mixed together.  Next time I might add a little bit more sausage too.

I added a little more rice like suggested by the reviews and it was scrumptious!  Tons of taste and very little effort.  This is a good weeknight recipe for busy moms.

Too salty for my taste.  This recipe would be so much better with low sodium soup and broth. The sausage and chicken made a good combo,  but it wasn't enough to make me make this recipe again.

I used "hot" pork sausage and two packages of rice.  Very tasty, but made a lot more than eight servings!  We'll be eating it for a while, but definitely a recipe worth repeating.

GREAT SUPRISE! My Wife and I love it.  2 boxes of UB wild rice was a good recommendation.  Also we did 1/2 shoestring potatoes (from recommendation) and 1/2 almonds.  They both were nice.  I liked the almonds myself.  Try this one!

This was good!  I used two 6 oz boxes of uncle Ben's wild rice (without the seasonings) and Jimmy Dean country-mild sausage, added some Tony's, left out the celery, chopped up the mushrooms a bit more.  The sliced almonds on top gave it a nice look, and went well with the flavor of the wild rice, I thought.

Basically followed the recipe but using leftover stuff! Didn't have cream soup, so made some cream of chicken from scratch..used leftover baked chicken thighs chopped, used leftover Spanish rice,  leftover ground pork sausage, threw in some steamed broccoli leftover..no extra liquid because why?.....mixed that all up in a 9x9. Baked for 30 min then topped with buttery crackers mixed with hot sauce for another 30. Pretty good casserole for using up food!

Taste was wonderful - only left celery out because I don't like the taste. The picture is deceiving. If you want it to be a more dry casserole, then yes, double the rice at a minimum. However, we ended up treating it like a soup and didn't change the rice portion. We served in bowls and ate with a spoon and really, really enjoyed it. It was a great fall dish - nice and warm, hearty.

I made this for my husbands supper.  We had a lot of wild rice that I made from scratch using a recipe on this site.  Wanting to use it all I searched for recipe to do so.  If there is a next time I would probably use Italian sausage.  MDH said he could not even taste any sausage in the dish.  I crushed canned onion rings to sprinkle on top after it had heated well for 25 minutes, leaving the almonds off as I didn't have any.

I had some wild rice I had cooked up last week. I can not Imagine why this recipe doe not have a face after 62 reviews! Well, I'm 63 with a Face for it! This was good, I dug through the fridge and completed this dish in 15 minutes flat! I by passed the cream of mushroom soup and just added flour to my sausage, onion & Fresh mushroom saute along with a bit of water, add the rice, heated it up and dinner was Done!

One of the favorite dishes my Mom made was Wild Rice Hotdish (that's the Midwest for you!)  I unfortunately do not have her recipe, so I was looking for one that seemed to be similar to hers.  This recipe fit the bill.

I did make a few changes to this recipe.  I LOVE wild rice, and it is a Minnesota specialty, so I cooked four ounces of wild rice and added it before mixing all the ingredients together.  I simmered it for an hour with a cover on the saucepan, and it still wasn't fully cooked.  However, adding it to the above recipe at this point worked perfectly since it was going to go into the oven for an hour and a half.

I used the above 4 ounces (before cooking) of wild rice and one six ounce package of long grain and wild rice.  It worked out perfectly with amount of liquid in this recipe.

I happened to have chicken thighs on hand instead of chicken breasts, so I deboned them and took the skin off and used those instead of the chicken breasts.

My frying pan isn't that big, so I first fried the sausage and then dumped it into a 5 quart stock pot.  Next I browned the chicken and added that to the stock pot.  I then sauteed the onions, garlic and celery, and added an 8 ounce package of fresh mushrooms instead of those rubbery canned mushrooms.  After sauteing those were thrown into the stock pot.  I then added all the rest of the ingredients, stirred it all up, and divided it between a 3 quart and a 2 quart casserole with lids.  It turned out perfectly!  NUM NUM!

I'm giving this a full 5 stars because it was THAT good! Fortunately, I read the reviews and realized I was going to have to make some changes, otherwise, I think I would have been terribly embarrassed in front of my company tonight! 
I used sweet Italian sausage because I just prefer it. Removed from casings, fried & crumbled. Five chicken breasts, cooked in the grease from the sausage, removed to plate with sausage. Add olive oil to pan drippings and fry chopped onion with sliced bella mushrooms(not canned!),adding garlic towards the end. I then added 1 can of golden mushroom soup,1 can of cream of chicken soup, at least 3 cups of fat free, low sodium chicken broth, 2 boxes of long grain & wild rice with both seasoning packets. I mixed in the meat after the other ingredients were well combined. I added the slivered almonds to the mixture instead of on top, spooned all into a large casserole & refrigerated overnight. The next day, I let casserole warm as the oven came to 350 degrees & let cook covered for about 1 1/2 hrs. An extra person showed up for dinner so I microwaved some brown rice and stirred it in. Then I topped with french fried onions & browned uncovered for about 15 minutes. I got rave reviews! Dish was nearly licked clean!
I don't see how the original recipe could feed 8 people! I had 9 with nearly nothing left. Next time I think I will add another box of rice. Some reviewers thought this dish too salty but I did not think it was at all.

I read and followed the suggestions of the other reviewers before making this.  I doubled the rice- and the rice that I bought came with seasoning packets (uncle ben's), so I added those and had plenty of flavor.  I also used 2 cans cream of mushroom and two cans cream of celery.  It turned out really good!

My husband liked it more than I did.  If I made it again, (which I won't) I would use french fried onions or ritz crackers in place of the almonds.

Also, per other reviewers, I reduced the amount of broth and cream-of-whatever and it turned out pretty dry.  I would follow the recipe more closely next time.

Excellent recipe - I made as stated, except omitted the sausage and celery.  I took the cover off about halfway through and had to cook a bit longer for it to thicken, but it sure did.  My husband was wary, but LOVED it.  Thank you for this keeper!

This was pretty good. I used 2 packages of rice as others suggested, and that was perfect. I will make again, but probably won't bother with the sausage, or make it without meat. My fairly easy to please husband said it was "ok". All those ingredients are costly for just "ok" if you don't have them on hand. Maybe a simpler version as a sidedish next time.

This dish baked beautifully!  I used spicy sausage and cubed chicken and sprinkled french onions on top.  Very filling on a cold winter's night.  And my husband loved it!

Fabulous!  I tried this recipe a few months ago, and it's become a favorite in our household.  I always stick to the recipe and it never fails to please.

This one's a keeper!  Husband loved it!  I used a can of fried onions on tope instead of almonds (don't like).  I also cut the broth down to 2 cups and added 1/4 C of white wine.  Would still cut back to 2 cups total liquid.

This dish is so flavorful and filling. I decided to use spicy sausage instead of regular and it really added a kick!

I would give this 3 1/2 stars.  I used plain ground pork instead of pork sausage but it didn't turn out as well.  I think next time I would use italian sausage for some more flavour.  Other than that, I doubled the rice as recommended and just added in some extra chicken broth near the end of cooking.  I skipped the almonds.  My husband liked it quite a bit.  He likes anything with more than one kind of meat in it!  I would make this again, I just couldn't put it on par with some of the other recipes that I liked more than this and rated them 4 stars.
