This recipe was great!  I couldn't find any bacon cheese spread, so I ended up getting a garlic and herbs cheese spread.  I probably used a little more of that than the recipe calls for, but my family likes rich, cheesy food.  Everyone said they loved this dish.  My husband, said out of everything we had, this was his favorite dish.  (and we had plenty of good eats!)  I will definitely use this as my green bean casserole recipe from now on.

I have made the traditional green been casserole before but when I got married I stopped as to my dismay my husband HATES green veggies....decided to try this recipe as I was craving the casserole and I LOVED IT!  Sorry, but my husband still wouldn't try it, but I think if he did he'd like it!  I used fresh green beans and blanched them - don't cook them too much if you like them with a little more bite (as I do - I hate mushy green beans) b/c they'll further cook in the oven in the soup mixture.  I couldn't find BACON cheese spread, but mixed crumbled bacon into regular cheese spread and spooned that on top.  It was so good!  I am not a processed cheese devotee but once in a while it's yummy - in this especially!  I'll make this again.

I just made this for tomorrow's office Christmas luncheon.  Took a taste test and it was outstanding!  I couldn't find bacon cheese spread, so I bought Old English brand and added some garlic powder for extra flavor.  So easy, creamy, and tasty!  Loved it!  Thank you!

Layered the green been with shredded cheese is the only thing I did differently!

Made this for Xmas dinner.  Couldn't find the spread  so used a regular garlic and herb spread.  Also added in some Asiago and Parmesan  shaved cheeses.  Was a big hit and I'll definitely  be making it again.

Delicious! We don't like mushrooms so we substituted the mushroom soup for cream of cheddar cheese soup. It was fantastic! The entire dish was devoured.
