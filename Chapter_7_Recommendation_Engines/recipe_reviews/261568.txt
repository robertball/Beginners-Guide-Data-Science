This is absolutely delicious. You might be tempted to add seasonings or spices to the flour mixture but trust me, it’s wonderful as written. Thank you for the recipe.

Guess we just aren't eggplant fans.  While this was an easy enough recipe, none of us were overwhelmed.  It was made following the recipe exactly.

Best eggplant I’ve made. My family loved it. I followed recipe and topped slices  with Parmesan and pine nuts on the plates.
