We made these for a New Years party.  They were a big hit with the party goers and super easy to make.  We used mascarpone cheese instead since we had it in the fridge but I'm sure it would be great with cream cheese.

Very good and so easy! I used 2 basil leaves per bread slice and served them with sliced cantaloupe. Thanks for the recipe!

Easy, easy and my guests cleaned the plate. I did half capicola and half sopressato.  Sopressato went first. Took another's advice, 2 basil leaves (one is too subtle) and served with melon slices. I gave 5 stars for the quick easy and relatively inexpensive idea.

Easy & tasty!  My deli was out of Capicola (seriously), so I had to use Pastrami, but it was still awesome.  Other than that, made the recipe exactly as indicated.  Took these bad boys to a wine tasting event & not only did I not come home with a single one, but I also didn't even get to try one at the winery (thankfully I snuck one beforehand, lol)!

I made this for a girls' gathering recently and it was a real winner!  I did not have Capicola but used Italian Sopressata instead.  I will do as the other reviewer and use both next time.  Make sure you use a generous spread of cream cheese and large leaves of basil.  Simple, fast and delicious for any get-together.

I have made these several times & they always disappear!  Definitely let them come up to room temperature before your guests arrive - so much more flavorful.  I've been known to spread cream cheese on a roll and stuff it with capicola  & fresh basil leaves & eat it as a sandwich - inspired by this recipe!

This recipe is fantastic!  I took it to a dinner party for 8 and we cleaned the plate!  Highly recommended.
