This was my first attempt at candy making and I think it turned out very well. This was a good first recipe -- not too complicated. The directions here need some clarification. I deduced, by reading to cut the candies into 1" squares and putting that together with the 64 servings, that we needed an 8x8 dish. (8x8=64) The recipe should have specified. I also deduced, by reading through twice, that I needed to line that 8x8 dish with aluminum foil. Once again, it didn't specify. I chose to spray my foil with pan so it wouldn't stick...don't know if I was supposed to or not but it turned out well and did not stick, so I think I'll do that again. Once I finished reading in between the lines of the recipe and actually made it, it was very simple and turned out well. I went ahead and did as a previous reviewer suggested and only heated to 243 degrees because I like a softer caramel. The texture was perfect and the taste was great -- subtle chocolate flavor.

Very tasty caramels!! The ONLY tiny thing I'd recommend is maybe letting your candy thermometer only get to 243-244 degrees, instead of 245. They turned out just a little more firm than I'd like but are still FABULOUS!!

I haven't made this recipe, however, I was going to; had all the ingredients ready. The recipe says to pour into prepared pan. No where does it say how to prepare the pan or what size, etc. #2 instruction says to LIFT from pan; remove foil. Hmmm.

Not good.  Not good at all.  Some fault is my own - I recommend using an 8x8 or 9x9 pan instead of a jelly roll pan (my attempt - the recipe doesn't specify) to make the caramels thick.  But also, the recipe turned out very buttery - too much so in my family's opinion.
