I thought this was very good and would definitely make it again. They only change I would make is to use a little less brown sugar. I definitely could taste the brown sugar. Otherwise, for a quick and easy baked French toast, this one's hard to beat!

Really liked this recipe but next time will add 1/2 tsp real vanilla to the egg/milk mixture.

Only thing I had to do differently was increase the amount of milk/egg/salt combo - I ended up doing it with 5 eggs, 1.5 cups milk and 3/4 teaspoon of salt.  Additionally, I baked it for about 38 minutes and sprinkled powdered sugar on top just before serving.  We served with syrup and butter, but honestly didn't need it.  This tastes wonderful and only takes about 5-10 minutes to throw together.

After eating the most amazing trench toast during brunch at the New Silver Slipper I came directly home in search of it. I believe this is the same recipe. It was great. I did however have to substitute heavy whipping cream for the milk because I was running low on milk. On a different day I also tried this recipe with diced pecans on the layer with the brown sugar. It did not come out right may try again with pecans on the top. I have also made this with vanilla added because I like that flavor in my french toast. My additions of heavy whipping cream instead of milk and vanilla brought the flavor over the top.
I have never made french toast on the stove again after finding this recipe.

My family and I love this recipe!! It was on the crispy side which is just how we love it. We don't care for it soft/mushy/soggy. This was perfect. Made two pans of it. Froze the extras. Reheated them in the toaster oven and was just as yummy as the day I made them

Quick and easy and LOVED that we had 16 sliced all ready at the same time! We did up the egg/milk mixture as other reviews suggested and sprinkled with powdered sugar before serving and found it sweet enough to not need to add syrup. DELICIOUS!!! Increasing the oven temp to 375 helped with the final texture go from a bit mushy to nicely toasted. We may even add some banana slices between the brown sugar and bread layers next time for a twist.

Excellent, quick breakfast bake.  Loved the ease of preparation without having to make it the night before it's needed.  As other reviewers have stated, I also needed to increase the egg, milk mixture (5 eggs and 1-1/2 cups milk).  I added 1 tsp. vanilla to the egg mixture, and cut back on the brown sugar. (Also increased bake time) This is so much better than I expected.  Will definitely make this again and again!  Thanks for sharing!

It is rare when we don't have a loaf of French Bread lurking around so this is right up my alley.  It was just a bit stale...perfect!  Turned out firm but nice and moist inside.  I would not change a thing, the sugar coated side is almost carmelised and we just topped it with a bit of powdered sugar.  This is now my go to recipe for French toast for brunches...so, so easy and so, so perfect.

Made this French Toast this morning for a family brunch.......we all loved it!  I made a few changes based on other reviews, but I have no doubt that it would be equally good as written.  I had to triple it, so I tripled the eggs, and liquid.  However, on the liquid I used 1 cup each of whole milk, half & half and whipping cream.  As for the butter, salt, cinnamon and brown sugar, I only doubled those......cutting back :-).  Baked it for about 40 minutes, no syrup or powdered sugar needed!  Also served a bowl of honey roasted chopped pecans along side for those who wanted to make this even more fattening!  It was awesome, and it's not like we eat this way often, so who cares about the calories!  No one in our family cared.....they just devoured the entire tray!  Thanks for such a yummy recipe!  It will definitely replace my previous french toast recipe!

I really liked this recipe and will definitely do french toast like this again.  Saves the time of cooking them up individually for sure.  I did use 5 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of milk and added some vanilla to that.  I do personally think it needed this extra as other reviewers had suggested.  I did have to bake it longer to get it a little crisp on top but that could be due to the added milk and eggs.  Also the only thing I would change otherwise is decreasing the brown sugar and possibly the butter as it was very sweet on it's own and I would prefer to add some maple syrup on the plate and it was too sweet already to do that.  A very easy and decadent french toast though!

Absolutely positively amazing!
Made it for Christmas morning breakfast...everyone loved it.
Only thing I added was drizzled pure maple syrup on bread after it was out of the oven. 
Thank you SO MUCH for sharing this recipe :)

I LOVE that you don't have to let it sit overnight. I mostly followed the recipe (except that I only had 11 oz of French bread on hand-- agree with others that more milk and egg would be needed if you used the amount of bread called for. I also added vanilla to the mix).
It turned out to be a fabulous quick and easy breakfast-for-dinner recipe. It would be a cinch to mix it up a little, like adding some orange zest or topping it with nuts. Anyway, my family loved it and it was great that all of us had French toast ready to eat at the same time.

Ended up using brioche bread and tripling the recipe due to the large group we were having for lunch. Because of that we had to improvise and ended up having to layer the bread and sprinkle cinnamon and sugar in between. We also grated a little nutmeg between the layers too. It took longer to cook because of the layering, so we cooked it covered in foil and took the foil off for the last 5-10 minutes. It was delicious! Everyone raved about it. Would also be great with chopped pecans sprinkled in the layers. Planning on making it again for special occasions.

Exactly what I'd hoped it would be:  a cheap and easy way to make a lot of french toast for a group of teenage girls at a slumber party.  In a pinch, I  was happy I'd had the ingredients on hand!

Tastes amazing!  I used Texas Toast, doubled the recipe for an entire loaf, and added 1 tsp. vanilla to the egg mixture.  The kids and husband loved it!  Will definitely be adding this frequently to my breakfast rotation.

Only had thin-sliced Italian bread and not much butter, but I liked it!  Super easy and convenient; was able to cook bacon in oven at same time in Pampered Chef stoneware bar pan.  Was only able to fit 6 slices of French toast in my 8x13 pan, will use two cookie sheets next time.  Will try again as written, and will update review then.

My new favorite french toast recipe! This was super easy to prepare and I;m looking forward to enjoying the few leftovers that we had. 
I used 5 eggs and 1.5 c milk with 1 3/4 of french bread. Make sure you have a big casserole dish for this one! Yummy! Thanks for a great recipe.

I actually made this with gourmet hot dog buns we had left over... added 1 tsp. of vanilla extract to the egg mixture and baked it for the full 30 minutes.  It was DELICIOUS and my fiancee and his son ate it all!  It is definitely a keeper.  The top was a little crunchy, which we liked, and the rest was not soggy but a perfect combo for french toast.  I think there may have been a bit too much butter for my liking so I'll reduce that a bit next time.  We baked it in a 9 X 13 glass baking dish.  Yum!

This french toast doesn't really need syrup- the caramelized effect from the butter & brown sugar is delicious! We used thick multi-grain bread and cinnamon sugar for the top. It worked beautifully and we can't wait to make it again!

This turned out great. I will let you know that I just eyeballed the ingredients and didn't measure and it still turned out great.  Like other reviewers, I increased the amount of egg.

All three of my small children liked it too!

This tasted very good. The only problem I had was that there was not enough egg/milk mixture to saturate the bread, so after I baked it, it was kind of crunchy.  It seemed like there was way too much bread and not enough milk/egg to coat it.  Maybe I bought the wrong kind of bread or didn't cut it thin enough.  I don't know.  I would make this again, but I think I would double the number of eggs and the amount of milk.

Easy and delicious! I used some leftover sourdough bread and added a dash of vanilla. Added a little less brown sugar and used cinnamon sugar on the top. Broiled it at the end for a few minutes just to get the tops a little crispy. This is not a fussy recipe and you could do it so many ways!

I use quartered bagels for this, many kinds, and it has become known far and wide as (full title) "Oh my gosh, yes, bring that bagel French toast thing!!!!" This is the full title because those exact words are always used together in that exact order. I think the only changes besides using bagels are that I add a bit of vanilla to the egg mixture, and I don't always measure the brown sugar and cinnamon; I just sprinkle them until they cover the cookie sheet. mmmmmmm!!!! If you need to make friends and influence people, this is the way to do so.

With the recommended changes, more milk, eggs, salt and vanilla, it was very good. We will definitely make it again.

Fabulous!  Easy and delicious.  Don't change the recipe, it's perfect as it was submitted.  I used day-old Portuguese sweet bread and that just added great flavor and substance.  So I would change the name of the dish to Brunch Baked Portuguese Sweet Bread Toast!  Made it for company, and it was devoured and there were no leftovers.  It was so good.

This was INCREDIBLE!  The brown sugar carmelizes and makes this dish so much better then pan fried french toast. I liked that I didnt have to prepare it the night before like so many of the other recipes. (Although i love that when i have the time). Only things I did differently...I added a little bit of cracked nutmeg and sime pumpkin pie spice.  Really jazzed it up and smelled so good as it was baking!

I did quick look at recipe before starting and made some unintentional changes but tasted great. Buttered dish  (used about 2 Tbl softened butter) then sprinkled cinn sugar on bottom. Put bread in smaller pan 9x12 then spread fresh ground cinn and drizzled with honey. Then made mix with 4 eggs salt and 1 1/4 cup milk. Then poured over dry bread in pan. Realized I should have soaked bread first so let it sit a few min. Then flipped and did cinn and honey drizzle again. Baked 25 min and super moist with slight crisp on top

Absolutely delicious. I added a teaspoon of vanilla to the 3 eggs/1 cup milk mixture and halved the butter and brown sugar. It was the perfect amount for 8 one inch slices of bread. I baked for 30 minutes at 350. Yum!

I loved this process so much more than others. Quick, hands soon free to cut fruit and make coffee, no waiting over night, and the texture of the brown sugar side was awesome. Thanks!

I made recipe as is. Thats important the 1st time.  Ive made this for several yrs now, and its always a hit with my family, as we dont care for the soft french toast. I make it “over night.” I then in the morning flip the french toast before baking it. That seems to distribute the  sugar and butter better and aids to the crispiness. A big favorite among my adults and kids alike.

Great!  I was having brunch for a few folks and wanted French toast, but wanted to be able to serve everyone at once without the hassle of making a few pieces at a time and then trying to keep everything warm.  The casserole option might be good, but I wanted real French toast.  This did it.  I agree with others that more eggs and milk are needed.  I cut the brown sugar by ~1/3, sprinkled the pan with cinnamon added vanilla to the milk.  Saved and will make again.

Made this on Christmas morning! I absolutely love this, a great rendition to traditional french toast. My father and boyfriend who both HATE bread because of the carbs, ate this up!!! Super tasty, with powdered sugar, butter, syrup, or nothing it all! Super flavorful!

Served twice at  a church supper with sausage links and doing it again by request.  Loved by all.  Accidentally made a version with dark brown sugar the second time  - the taste was a bit less sweet and more molasses-y - which many enjoyed more.

I made RBI’s today for Christmas brunch and it was a complete hint! Since I was cooking for a large crowd, I did take one reviewers idea and did 5 eggs and 1.5 cups of milk. I also added cinnamon, nutmeg and vanilla to the egg/milk mixture. It was absolutely delicious and easy

Wonderful! I made this exactly as directed and it was fantastic. My family raved. I like that this makes the French toast crunchy and not soggy. You can actually pick it up and eat it like a piece of toast. No syrup needed. So much easier to not have to stand at the stove to make it.  I will be making this again

I would add 4 - 6 eggs for more batter! I also only used extra
 granulated sugar with cinnamon for sweetness.  It turned out Great!! Just make sure to generously line or spray  the pan with cooking oil to help with sticky sugary coating.

Baked french toast solves the problem of food not being ready to serve at the same time. The baking also helps it rise and fluff. I always add vanilla. Lining the bottom of the pan with sugar is a new tip.

My kids loved this! I loved the cooking method for French toast and will definitely make this again. I did not use the butter instead I just sprayed the pan with butter spray placed my bread into the pan and poured the egg mixture on top. I let that sit about 10-15 minutes, flipped the bread and then topped it with a cinnamon/ sugar mix (1 tablespoons of each). In the future if you made a Carmel sauce out of the butter & sugar put that on the pan then your egg soaked bread I’m sure that would be a delicious breakfast!

This was very easy and had great flavor. I love how the bread just soaked up the butter and then the brown sugar crusted the bottom. Why three starts then? I made this 100% for my 3 boys ages 9, 6, and 3. None of them loved it. I think it might have been too sweet. That can obviously be modified by adding less brown sugar but I’m rating the recipe as is. Who knows why kids like what they do but something about this didn’t go over as well as I hoped. User error could have definitely played a part as well!

Easy to make and very tasty. I made a blueberry compote sauce to go along with it. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because the bread did turn out a bit too crispy, making it difficult to bite and chew.

I just made this & it is delicious!  I lined my jelly roll pan with non stick aluminum foil.  I sprinkled the butter with granulated brown sugar (because it had previously been bought by mistake & I wanted to use it up) & then regular brown sugar.  I did not measure, used just enough of each to cover the tray.  I used 4 large eggs & 1 1/2 cups of milk.  It was the perfect amount for 12 slices of french bread cut on a diagonal.  12 slices fit on the tray.  I sprinkled 4 slices with cinnamon, 4 with grated nutmeg & left 4 plain because of my family's tastes.  Everyone loved it!

Very good AND easy!
Loved that this didn't have to sit overnight and was easy to put together, which wouldn't have mattered if it wasn't also delicious.

I made this using home made French bread that was a couple of days old. I cut the brown sugar down to just sprinkling it on the bread. I baked this in the oven according to the recipe and flipped the bread halfway through. I served this with maple syrup. This is easy to make and I will definitely make it again.

Fantastic recipe, and it scales very easily for larger groups. I often use blueberry bagels, sliced in half (well, quarters, really) for the bread. I also highly recommend lining the baking pan with quick release foil. Makes for very easy serving and cleanup.

Have made this about 4 times already.  Used vanilla instead of cinnamon and only a sprinkling of white sugar not brown.  I made it last week for overnight guests and they loved it.  I had it all in the oven and was spending time with them instead of over the stove.

Turned out great! Only 4 stars because I adjusted the recipe- 5 eggs and add vanilla. I used regular white sugar because I was out of brown and it worked just as well. The only way I'll make French toast from now on.

What a simple, tasty recipe. I will definitely make this again. I'm trying to figure out how to make it more "safe" for my diabetic husband by using a different, more whole grain bread and by using equal amounts of Stevia and brown sugar.

Super awesome exactly as written! I was really nervous about totally soaking the bread in the egg, so I did half the pan per directions and just coated the other half. Have faith and go for the soaking...turns out great! The non-soaked were too dry. Oh....and I used some pretty stale baked bread.

I doubled this recipe using (expensive) brioche bread. I melted the butter in the pan in the oven, and maybe that was where my issue was? Then sprinkled the brown sugar over the butter. It seemed like a ton of butter, and a ton of brown sugar. I actually cut the brown sugar in half, and there was a good puddle of melted butter sloshing around on the bottom of my pan. I used the jelly roll pan liked it called for, had a little extra bread and used a large pyrex casserole dish. Because I had two pans, I put one on the bottom and one on the top rack in the oven. Followed everything else in the recipe, oven was at 350, and after maybe 15 minutes in the oven, smoke was pouring out of all 4 burners on my stove. I opened the oven and had to pull out the jelly roll pan which was completely charred on the bottom. The butter and sugar carmelized, then burnt to a crisp, along with the underside of the french toast. The upper glass dish of french toast didn't really cook very well after being in the oven for a while longer, so we just threw it on the electric griddle and it got nice and crispy. I wouldn't have been so upset if I didn't spend $12 on two loaves of bread that I had to toss, and also it was New Year's day, making breakfast for 6 other people! Won't be making this one again.

This was the best French toast I've ever made/had! Everyone loved it. I did add the vanilla as another reviewer mentioned and used sour dough bread.

This was so good!!  Easy to feed a crowd with this recipe.  I did cut back on the brown sugar as others had mentioned.  I put the cookie sheet with the butter and brown sugar in the oven for a few minutes to melt them together.  Flipped the bread over about half way through and both sides were nice and crunchy but still moist.  Serve with some fresh strawberries or blueberries and it cuts the sweetness, if it's too sweet. Thank you for a great recipe!!!

Excellent, easy recipe. I added a dash of vanilla, 2 extra eggs, and 1/2 cup extra milk. The French toast was moist and delicious. I will definitely make this recipe again.

amazing! i upped the eggs since other people said to, and ended up not using all of them, so next time i'll leave the eggs as is, but this was made for 12 people the other day and everyone LOVED it. no need for syrup, it was amazing on it's own.

Very good as unofficially rated by two fussy teenagers. Perhaps because of this  it deserves a five star rating. I gave it four stars because it needed vanilla and less brown sugar.  For those trying I think this is a go to recipe.

This was great. None of us really loved French toast until now! Cut the butter and brown sugar in half to see if I could save a few calories and it still came out with a nice carmelized bottom.

PERFECT!  Pre-sliced bread and let sit overnight in oven.  Added 1/2 tsp vanilla to egg mixture. Used 2 eggs and 2 egg whites. Didnt measure butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon, just rubbed a thick layer over a Silpat liner on a cookie sheet and sprinkled sugar and cin on top. When done, cut banana slices on top, added a little bit of syrup, and dusted with powdered sugar.

Went over well, used just sliced bread (already had it, no special trip).  I did have to add vanilla to my egg/milk  mixture but that was the only change I made.

Will make it again, think with a little less brown sugar.

Quick, easy & really good. Love that it comes out more "crunchy" than soggy. I did cut back on the butter a bit and only used 1/3c brown sugar and still was great.

This is now a Christmas specialty and everyone loves it. I also increase the milk/egg combo but the biggest thing I change is that I substitute about 2/3 of the milk with egg nog. So 2/3 cup egg nog, 1/3 milk and it is seriously amazing. I make about 4-5 baguettes at a time to serve my big family and have leftovers, which I freeze and toast for yummy breakfasts for weeks. Powdered sugar and berries are delicious on top. Thanks for this awesome recipe!

Made this for breakfast for a dozen people and it was absolutely scrumptious. The butter and brown sugar make a caramel crust on the button and it made a crunchy top when you take it out and flip it over to put on the plate. I didn't change a thing.

This was way too sweet for our tastes. But it was a perfect balance of moisture and crunch...as a point of reference we do not like soggy French toast. I will try to make again using a lot less

Great recipe, great use of the leftover french loaves. I had a loaf and a half, so I doubled the egg mixture and added vanilla and that worked well.  Very simple to make in the morning!

I can't legitimize cooking one piece of bread that I had a time so when I found this recipe I had to try it. After doing so, it is absolutely worth trying if you want a French toast recipe that you can make one afternoon when you aren't in the mood to spend all day cooking.

I loved the recipe. I wouldn't add the salt next time. The butter that it is baked in adds just enough salt. Loved having the entire family be able to eat at the same time.

I used a loaf that produced 20, 1" slices-  I added 3 extra eggs and a bit more milk.  This recipe was great!  Next time I will make a double recipe.  I underestimated how much people would want to eat of this!  New family fav!  So simple, yummy and quick.

Fabulous recipe, my whole family scarfed it down.  The only thing I did was add a little vanilla to the milk/egg mixture.  We will make it again!

YUM. Love that I can make it all ready at once.  Bottom caramelizes so it doesn't even need syrup.  And crunchy on top.  Win win win.

Love it! Only thing that I add is some vanilla extract. You will find this recipe very versatile. I've used white sugar when I was out of brown. It doesn't have the delicious syrupiness that you get with brown, but when you have a craving for French Toast, it works. I've tried it with French bread, Italian, Cinnamon & Raisin Bread, whole wheat, it never fails to please.  I make sure to whip up some Cinnamon Butter and have that on the table, & the combination is fabulous. This dish pairs well with seasonal fruit on the side (bananas, oranges, any kind of berry - yum!).

I loved this recipe!  I wanted to make french toast for a crowd, and this recipe was perfect.  I doubled the recipe and I made sure to let the bread soak up plenty of egg & milk before placing it on the butter and brown sugar.  I ended up with a moist, (not too) eggy, wonderful french toast with an amazing buttery-caramel sauce on top! (no butter and syrup needed!)  Super easy to make, absolutely delicious, convenient and great for serving a crowd.  I will make this again and again.

This is how I will make French toast from now on! It's so much easier to bake multiple at a time than it would be to make one at a time on a frying pan. Plus, it basically makes its own syrup with the brown sugar.

I prepared this recipe and the result was excellent! It was easy, fast, and most importantly,  these french toast are delicious. 
The only things I modified are that I used an extra egg, I added vanilla extract to the egg mixture and additionally to the cinnamon I sprinkled a little bit of dried ground orange rind, which gave it a subtle orangy flavor.
I'm not going to look for more french toast recipes. I found the perfect one for me.

Always delicious. Turns out to have a custard texture. My family loves it. There are many tweaks you can do to make it your own.

I decided to make it because I wanted all the people to eat at the same time and not have to keep pieces warm in the oven as I made them.  I didn't care for this, too crunchy on the bottom after baking for 25 minutes.

Great as it is!  Would be good to add apples or other fruit too.  It is very sweet, more like a dessert/donut.  My Daughter's friend said it was the best french toast she's ever had!  We also tried some with strawberry sauce on top, wonderful!

Five stars all day. I added almond extract to the mixture, and these were the best French toast my wife and I have ever eaten. I won't make normal French toast ever again. Just awesome!

I've made this three times now.  The first and times, I followed the directions except I added the cinnamon to the milk mixture.  The third time, I used coconut milk, and I added pecans to the bottom layer.  YUMMY!!!!
