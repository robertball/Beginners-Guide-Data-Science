This was delicious. The only changes I made were to use 1/2 whole eggs and 1/2 egg whites and the bread I used was rosemary olive oil bread. I think this could use a little more "stuff" in it so next time, I'll add some diced meat and maybe a little broccoli. I had this for dinner and really enjoyed it

I made it exactly as stated and my family and I really didn't like this.  The thyme was over powering in my opinion and I like thyme. The top was nice and crunchy, but the inside was kinda like eating a sponge.  Sorry.

This egg bake is delish! I do not add the bread as I feel it doesn’t need it. I’ve made this about 10 times and at first I did add the bread, but I stopped using it. Without the bread it is also low carb. I use fresh tomatoes often in here instead what the recipe calls for. I also use one cup of half and half and one cup of unsweetened almond milk or whatever milk you have on hand. The half and half adds extra flavor. I’d cut the salt back to 1 tsp. But with those changes, I’ve had rave reviews at brunches and when I made this at family gatherings.

My husband and I enjoyed this baked omelette since we  are feta cheese fans. I cut the recipe in half since it was just for the two of us. I used diced fresh tomato instead of canned tomatoes. I used garlic feta cheese instead of the basil since that is what I had on hand. But I would like to try this with various types of feta for variety. The texture was a little quiche-like with the bread on top and was light and airy  which we like (but some may refer to it as spongy and may not like it). The type of bread does make a difference in the texture since part of it sinks down into the egg mixture instead of floating on top. Herbs such as the thyme  makes this a different type of Omelette which we liked for a change.  We had bacon strips along side it and my husband had seconds.

I had to make some substitutions and it ended up being pretty darn delicious.  Instead of the tomato I had a can of light tuna with roasted tomatoes and basil lying around.  So I thew that in.  Did not have Italian bread so I just cut up some plain white bread in one ich squares.  I added a little Italian seasoning and my husband and daughter said it was the best omelette they every had.

This is an awesome recipe!   You can adjust it to your own serving size then follow it as exactly written.  OR ....., you can add your own special touches if you are comfortable with cooking.  They can be as simple as changing up the spices to your taste or changing the type of cheese  to one you prefer to use or adding onions, garlic or fresh tomatoesinstead of cannned.  That is the beauty of cooking is you can find inspiration from a recipe like this and keep it the same or adapt to your families’ taste.   For me, I wanted to experience a fresh tomato flavour, by using fresh tomatoes, I added some green onions, like a quarter cup,  but I went with spices I love like fresh dill and a teeny bit of oregano.  The other CRAZY thing I did was toss my bread cubes in some melted butter before putting them on top!  I dunno why, just my indulgent side I guess.  For some buttery richness! 
So, Some May say I butchered this recipe, but it was the best inspiration for my dinner tonight.  I am grateful it was online and I that was able to customize it to MY flavour preferences.   That’s what the love of cooking is ALL about!   If you are new to cooking, I would follow the directions, if you are experienced, you know where you can tweak it!  Happy cooking!

My only problem was that it seemed a bit too liquid. The diced  tomatoes,  although drained, create their own liquid. Maybe add less milk? I also added chopped onion and it was quite tasty.
