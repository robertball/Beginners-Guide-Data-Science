I used light cream cheese, lite sour cream and an egg substitute in this recipe.  I also used the reduced fat graham cracker crust.  I cooked it for 1 hour and this turned out wonderful!  Hubby had 3 helpings!!!  I saved myself 200 calories and it tasted very rich and yummy!  This is going to be a favorite around my house during the holidays!

This is oh-so-yummy.  I love cheese cake and my husband loves pumpkin pie (and he didn't even notice that fact that it was cheesecake or the other changes I made :) tehehe).   You definitely have to wait for it to cool and refrigerate before eating though, otherwise it tastes heavily of egg.  The next day I heated it up in the microwave and topped it with some vanilla ice cream.    I did make some changes to make it a little less of a guilty pleasure ...  I used lite cream cheese, lite sour cream, Splenda blend sugar (half real-half not), egg white substitute (1/4 c per egg), a Heartland granola pie crust, and made my own pumpkin pie spice (1/2 t cinnamon, 1/4 t ginger, 1/8 t allspice/cloves, and 1/8 t nutmeg ... per every 1 t of pumpkin pie spice needed).

I had never made cheesecake before and made this recipe with some lower fat and lower sugar substitutions. It came out so well--the flavor was creamy and mild and just great! 45 minutes was the perfect cooking time for the pie.

This was AMAZING! I took it to Christmas dinner and it was a huge success, even with the people who said they weren't crazy about pumpkin. Just perfect in both texture and flavor. Thanks so much!

This recipe was so easy and definitely satisfies my cheesecake craving.  It was rich yet light in texture.  It doesn't sit heavy in your stomach like regular cheesecake.  The prepared graham cracker crusts were the best part- except when they get soggy a few days after it's baked. It's best served the day it's baked.

We didn't really care for this recipe.  It was too much cream cheese and not enough pumpkin.

I really like this recipe because it is so easy.  I've baked it a few times for parties, and people always enjoy it.  It's not very showy,  but still a crowd-pleaser

This recipe turned out so lovely. I added a little bit more pumpkin puree as a personal preference, as well as some more spice to even it out. I used neufchatel in place of cream cheese and fat free sour cream to reduce the heaviness of the dish and it still turned out rich and creamy! The only complaint I have is that the given recipe makes so much pie filling that I had to put some of it in a third (albeit much more shallow) pie! Overall I loved the simplicity of the dish, and the hubby loved it too!

This pumpkin cheesecake was absolutely fantastic! The graham crust (I used a recipe from this site) with the subtle pumpkin flavor (I did use a bit more pumpkin than called for) and cheesecakey goodness... seriously, go and make this recipes right now!
