I make a ginger roll cake very similar to this one - but this recipe has way better cake! It's easier to roll the cake up in the parchment paper/towel while hot, then allow to cool. Unroll to ice and it rolls back up in a snap without breaking :-) I also use a honey cream icing sometimes instead of whipped cream (2tbsp honey, 8oz unsalted butter and 1/3 cup icing sugar blended). Yum!
