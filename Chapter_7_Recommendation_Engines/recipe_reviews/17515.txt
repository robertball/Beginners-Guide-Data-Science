GREAT recipe!  I made a few changes... I was scared by the comments about the quiche being too runny, so I used 1 1/2 cups whipping cream instead.  I hand-measured the salt and pepper - using a mixture of black and white pepper instead of cayene. I also used 1 cup of swiss and 1/2 cup of grated guyere.  Added spinach instead of onions.  It turned out gorgeous (for some reason I had doubts it would!).  I did cover the edges with aluminum foil 25-minutes into baking to prevent it getting too dark.

This turned out BEAUTIFULLY! I made the following alterations: I used 5 eggs in all, 1/3 c. heavy cream plus 1 c. 1% milk instead of 2 cups cream, I saute'd the onion and 1 clove garlic in the bacon grease, then pressed and blotted to drain grease in fine-mesh strainer. I mixed the onion/garlic with the bacon and, on top of that, layered 5 oz. frozen chopped spinach (which I nuked for 2.5 minutes, then pressed to drain the water). I topped that with the 1 c. Swiss and, finally, the egg mixture. Oh, and my store-bought crust fell out of the freezer and cracked on the floor, so I found a recipe online for a wheat crust. It turned out pretty and DELICIOUS... better than I'd hoped. Thanks for a GREAT recipe.

This was pretty good.  I used a regular store bought pie shell and used only 1 1/2 cups cream, but it was still too much and I had to throw out some of the mixture.  I would suggest using only 1 cup cream, because after cooking for an extra 15 minutes it was still very softish.  I sauted my onions in my bacon grease, because they are better put in cooked than raw.  Other than that I followed the recipe.  Definately let it cool for 10 minutes or longer before cutting it.

This was the third type of quiche I made for a PTA brunch I catered last week.  This recipe is pretty traditional, but I loved the onions and the cayenne pepper.  I sauted the onions in a little butter first.  I also reduced the amount of salt based on previous suggestions.  One of the guests at the brunch said she had been making Quiche Lorraine for over 20 years and she liked this quiche better than her own!  She asked for the recipe too.  I would definitely make again, but would like to experiment with the addition of vegetables.  Very yummy.  Thanks for the recipe!

a bit runny, so will add a bit less half and half. added mushrooms and frozen spinach, used 'real' bacon bits, and sauted the onions first. Yum!

This recipe is flawed. You can not fit 2 cups of cream, 4 eggs, 1 cup of cheese, and essentially 1 cup of bacon plus the other ingredients into one 9 inch pan. It is almost a perfect fit for 2 pans.

Very good, basic quiche recipe.  Like previous reviewers, I found that the quiche was not done after the recommended cooking time.  I had to cook mine an additional 8 minutes in order for it to be set in the center, which is when I consider a quiche to be done.  This is also an excellent "base" recipe to use with other veggies, cheeses, etc.

This had the flavor of the quiche that I remember but next time I will saute the onions before putting them in.  They were too crunchy and a little too overwhelming when put in raw.  Otherwise, it's a perfect quiche recipe.

Good quiche, Jennifer. My family prefers quiche to be a little firmer in texture. In reviewing some of the comments, I decided to cut the whipping cream to 1 1/2 cups and add 1/2c of Gruyere cheese with the 1 cup of swiss. I omitted the sugar and salt also. Purrrrfect! Thanks so much.

I have been making this type of quiche for years.  Here is what will take it OVER THE TOP! -  first, saute the onion IN the bacon grease.  After the onion is well carmelized, remove it all from the grease and drain on paper towels so you're not getting all that grease in the finished quiche, but you HAVE gotten a wonderful flavor to the onions! Another tip - I prebake my pie crust for about 6 minutes, and then, before putting any of the filling ingredients into the crust, I use a pastry brush to brush some dijon mustard all over the bottom of the crust.  Gives an amazing flavor! I hope you give these tips a try!

This quiche was the best! And so easy to make! Even the most finicky of eaters at my house asked for seconds. I served it with the "Spring Strawberry Spinach Salad" also from this site and it was a HUGE HIT! Thanks for a great recipe, Jennifer!

Made this quiche for a baby shower I was hosting.  The Mama-to-Be just emailed me asking for the recipe because she just loved it so much!!!  I followed the recipe exactly and had no problems.  I would wait for it to cool completely before slicing though.

Evening All!  I made this last night and used a combo of suggestions gleaned from previous reviews. It came out PERFECTLY and was the hit of the evening. Do the following and it will be superb: 1. Decrease cream to one (1) cup 2. Add 1/2 cup grated Guyere Cheese in addition to the Swiss. 3. Cook the grated onion in the bacon grease before adding it to the pie shell 4. Finally, use one of the "unroll it yourself" pie shells that are in the refrigerated section at your grocery (usually with the canned biscuits, etc).  Otherwise, follow the recipe as shown. Serve this with a green salad as the first course for an easy and delightful meal on a cold evening!

This recipe is excellent! Moreover, it can be adapted for any ingredient your imagination can come up with! It shouldn't come out runny if you cook it long enough an allow it to set. Quick and easy!

This was my first-ever attempt at making quiche.  I was pleasantly surprised at just HOW GOOOOD this was!  I used one of those premade frozen deep dish pie crusts from the supermarket (out of pure laziness LOL), used 6 eggs to fill the entire crust, sauteed the onions in some reserved bacon grease, and added about 1/2 c of shredded parmesan cheese to the egg mixture.  One bite and I was in Heaven.  I will definitely be making this again and again :~)

Great recipe!  The comments about it being runny are accurate and there are a couple ways to get around that.  You can try changing the cream to egg ratio as mentioned in other comments or what I do is coat all my meat/veggies in corn starch.  That firms it up very nicely.  It also helps reduce any greasiness from meats like bacon, ham or sausage.

This was soooo good! I made some changes though to make it my own. I added cubes of portabello mushrooms, spinach (the frozen works fine, no need to pay more for fresh), less bacon (about 7 pieces is more than enough), added garlic when I sauteed the mushrooms and onion in the leftover bacon grease, used FIVE eggs, and ONE cup of cream. It was perfect. My boyfriend and I ate it for dinner, for breakfast, and lunch the next day! Couldn't get enough!!

Nice creamy quiche.  I found that the recipe made enough to fill two deep dish 9-inch crusts.

Delicious. I used half the bacon amount, all the rest as recipe called for. Baking took about 10 minutes extra and still a bit too much liquid. Next time I'll still use  half the bacon, higher quality Swiss cheese and 1 cup heavy cream, 1 cup half and half.

I love this recipe.   However, there are some things you must do.  The absolutely most important thing is to buy a DEEP DISH shell, not the regular one.   And different brands have different sizes.  I do the deepest one I can find.  I use four large organic brown free range eggs.  I use as much bacon as I want, this time one half pound.  I use one 8 ounce package of whatever cheese I feel like at the moment or what is on sale.   I ALWAYS saute the onions.  Now I stack it, first half the cheese at the bottom, then the bacon, then the sauteed onions, then the rest of the cheese.  Then the four eggs and I use one and 3/4 cups of half and half.  In that mixture, I put some hot sauce (few drops) pinch of salt, pepper, dried parsley and some nutmeg.  And the 425 degrees down to 300 degrees is essential after 15 minutes.  It always comes out perfect but you have to forget what time it says and just watch it until the center pops back when you push it in with your finger.  All stoves are different.  Love love love this wonderful recipe.

Delicious! I usually don't write reviews but this was so good I had to! I did make a few changes. I used 1 cup of 2% milk, a box of frozen spinach which I sauteed in some olive oil with the onions and a little minced garlic, and sharp cheddar cheese instead of the swiss. I also used pre-cooked bacon from oscar meyer and a store bought pie crust. I'm finishing up the leftovers for breakfast right now!

This was yummy - cut back on whipping cream by about half cup - no need to add full amount of salt.  Try baking the crust a bit before adding filling then baking as instructed.  This will make it better as the crust won't be too soggy on the bottom.

Holy cow, this was phenomenal.  I love quiche but have never attempted to make one myself.  For this Father's Day, I decided to finally give it a shot.  I followed the recipe exactly except for using scallions instead of onion and I changed the cream to decrease the calories; I used 1/2 cup cream and 1 cup half & half.  Other than that it is exactly as Jennifer described.

All of my family - including my 7 year old son - RAVED about this quiche and I couldn't agree more.  I actually made two of them with slightly different fillings.  They both got the swiss cheese and scallions, and then I layered one with bacon and the other with 1/2 cup diced ham and 1/2 cup spinach.  Then I poured the egg/cream/salt/sugar/pepper mix in to the pie pan and baked them.  50 minutes later it was all cooked and shortly after that it was devoured :o)

Yum! Made it for an easy brunch dish. Doesn't take too much work, and has a great result. Creamier than your average quiche, so when you serve it don't be alarmed if it seems soft--the eggs will cook, but all that cream makes it stay soft!

There are so many things wrong here. It won't set because of that much liquid (it won't even fit in the crust), the onion remains raw in the end, and there's far too much salt. I used 1.5 cups light cream and it's still too loose -- and I'm not even very picky about that. It's very pretty though, and we probably WILL eat it. Thank you for sharing.

This was my first time making a quiche and it turned out perfect with some modifications based on the reviews!  This was very easy and quick.  The modifications I made - I used 2/3 cup heavy cream and 1/3 cup 1% milk instead of 2 cups light cream.  I also added used about 2/3 cup swiss and 1/2 cup cheddar gruyere.  I used dried minced onions instead of fresh, which worked very well.  I also used 1 tblsp of ranch dressing powder instead of the salt.  I can't wait to make it again!

I altered the recipe to reduce the fat content for my family.  Twelve slices of bacon, cream, and cheese....I just could not do it, although it sounded good. Anyway...I used twelve slices of turkey bacon, fat free half and half, five eggs, half cup of minced onion with one clove of garlic, seasonings, and reduced fat Jarlsberg lite swiss cheese.  I prepared the ingredients as directed, dividing everything between two pre-baked frozen  pie shells ( I baked the pie shells for 12 minutes so that the bottom would be done/flaky) and baked as directed. The results were fabulous!  My husband could not get enough of the quiche.  He admitted that he did not think he'd like the dish, but was very pleasantly surprised.  My six year old daughter loved it too.  I'll be making this recipe again and again.  I'm very pleased that it turned out so well after converting the recipe to a lighter version.

Yes I give this 5 stars but its because I tweaked the recipe.  I used thick cut bacon cooked in the oven and drained grease.  Sauteed the onions so they were nice and soft.  Didnt use the salt because there is enough in the bacon and cheese.  Used 1.5 cups of whipping cream and skipped the pepper and sugar.  My husband doesnt like pie crust so I used Pillsbury Crescent rolls for the crust.  We both loved it!  I also made one without a crust and that was even better, served with toast or english muffin.  The quiche was nice and creamy yet light at the same time.  Will def make this one again.

This was really good, everyone ate it up. I only made a few minor tweaks, I sauteed the onions and only used 1 1/2 cups of whipping cream. I used a store bought frozen crust which made this super easy. I also grated the cheese, cooked the bacon and chopped the onion the day before for easy prep in the morning. I did have to bake for 10 minutes longer then the original recipe called for.

This is a delicious recipe.  Even though I didn't have cream, I was able to use whole milk and still have it come out very yummy.  I listened to the other reviewers and reduced the milk to 1 1/2 cups.  I will definitely make this again.

Ive been using this recipe for years using whipping cream and its always a hit. (i got the recipe from my old Betty Crocker cookbook) Very rich but also very delicious and simple to prepare. I wanted to prepare it today with the light cream as this recipe calls for but my husband wouldn't hear of it. Change is hard for some people! I always make quiche without a crust. My family prefers it that way.

This is a Birthday Breakfast Tradition in our home and so far there's six of us.  It is sooo savory & delicious. I love making and eating this recipe.  My tip: Put it together the night before, cover, and refrigerate.  In the morning, take it out of the frige for about 20 minutes before baking to remove some of the chill, then bake.

This quiche was out of this world! I did make a few changes per other reviewers suggestions. I reduced the cream by 1 cup and incresed the eggs to 5. I baked the quiche for 15 min @ 425 and then reduced the oven to 300 and baked for another 30 - 35 min. I also blind baked the pie crust first. The quiche came out excellent. Will make again and again.

Excellent recipe!  Made it for mother's day this past weekend and it was a hit.  I did change it a bit, I sauteed onion in the bacon grease, used half and half (1 to 1.5 cups) and added an extra egg.  Will definitely make this again for special brunches!

This is good, but I used 6 eggs and only one cup of half & half. 2 cups would totally overflow the pie crust. I also needed to increase my cooking time, and I also fried the onions in some of the bacon grease before adding to the quiche. Yummy!

DELICIOUS!  There is no other way to describe this recipe. I made a few adjustments to make it my own. I took some of the advice of the other reviewers: I used 5 eggs, used only 1 1/2 cups of cream, used Hormel "real" crumbled bacon (enough to cover the bottom of the dish) and used 1 1/2 cups of shredded Swiss. Now, the things that I did change:  I used a Puff Pastry instead of pie crust. I added a 6oz jar of sliced mushrooms (drained and washed) and an onion "mixture" which consisted on onions, red peppers, green peppers and parsley (which can be found in the freezer section) and I omitted the salt (the bacon was salty enough).  I used 1/2 cup of the cheese as a topper. I did bake it an additional 20mins. due to the extra ingredients and then set it under the broiler to brown the top.  This was my FIRST attempt at making a quiche.  My partner and I were simply amazed at the taste and texture of this dish.  I would HIGHLY recommend this recipe to anyone, with or with out the changes.  Thank you Laundrie for submitting this recipe.

This was a great recipe!  Probably the best quiche I've ever made.  The only alterations I made were leaving out the sugar and using 1 1/2 cups Swiss cheese, because that's what was in the package, already shredded.  As many others did, I also sauteed the onions in some of the bacon fat.  I did not put foil on the edges of the crust and it was fine.  The inside was firm and not runny, and I cooked it exactly as instructed.  Also the eggs were very light and fluffy.  I would definitely make this quiche again!

I prepared this for dinner and it was gobbled in a few minutes. I made a few changes, though. I used 3 eggs and only 1 cup of heavy cream. No sugar, no onion. Next time I will have a prebaked crust pie, because my quiche came out a little bit soggy.

Because I baked mine in a deep 9-in pie dish, I added 3 eggs.  I have to echo others' suggestions of cutting the cream back by half a cup, and adding 1/2 c of cheese.  I sauteed the onion (& 3 cloves of garlic) in the bacon grease.  It took an extra 12 min to bake, likely b/c of my large dish.  Very tasty and great texture.

I've made this 3 times. First time as written, thus 4 stars for original. Too much 1/2 and 1/2, onions crunchy, a little bland. 5 stars using 1 1/2 cups of 1/2 and 1/2, saute onions with garlic. Prebake pie shell 6 min at 400. Seasoned one time substituting 1 tsp nutmeg for red pepper, the next time omitted sugar doubled red pepper and added 4 drops Tabasco. 2nd and 3rd times were perfectly delicious!

If you are using a store bought pie crust, you must buy an extra deep one or else all of the ingredients won't fit in and it will be very unattractive.

This was great. I had to leave before it was finished cooking, and by the time I got home my Dad and brother had eaten all but 3 pieces! I chopped the bacon before sauteeing it, and then also sauteed the onion in the bacon grease. I'll definitely make this again.

Real men will eat this quiche. I make it for my friends and I eat it. This is a 
great recipe. I sort of doubled the recipe and filled 3 9-inch shells (I like to add 
bacon, ground beef, & veggies)

Suggestion: rather than wisk the milk and eggs, put it in a blender. Easier to 
mix, easier to pour.

I doubled this and made it this morning and got nothing but raves.  It was my first quiche ever, and it was so simple.  A little tip: the marie callendar's deep dish crusts are wonderful, but don't quite hold all the filling!

This recipe was OK, definitely not as good as I was expecting.  My husband didn't really like it at all and only picked at it.  When I looked in the oven when there where ten minutes remaining in the the bake time, I knew there was no way it would be done in time, so I returned the temperature to 425 and it was done in only five additional minutes, so perhaps you would keep it at the higher temperature for ten or so additional minutes in the beginning of baking.  I also added extra cheese to it, and used cheddar as well as swiss.  I gave the leftovers to my brother and he loved it, but since hubby and I weren't that fond of it, I probably won't make it again.

Usually bake this for breakfast without pie dough, in frying pan.  Like others, cut back on the cream, pre-cooked onions(until translucent) with mushrooms and added secret ingredients-dash of nutmeg and freeze-dried chives.  Make sure you prick pie dough and cover with edges with foil.  Thanks for the recipe.

this was excellent, but i halved the bacon and doubled the cheese, eliminated the sugar (1/4 tsp. in a quiche? who would even know it was there?), and used white pepper instead of cayenne.

This was my first attempt at a quiche. GREAT flavor, but WAY too much cream for my taste causing it to be wetter than I like.  Next time will try to about half the cream as I'm looking more like the quiche at La Madeleine.  But thank you for the starting point!!

Good basic recipe that is easy to customize. I recomend pre-cooking your pie crust (weigh down using pie weights/rice/beans etc) to prevent it from puffing up. The warm crust will help with even cooking helping to solve the problem of runny quiche others have complained of. Cut back on the cream as well. I added a clove of garlic when sauteeing the onions and sliced mushrooms as well. You could easily use cooked asparagus, broccoli, spinach etc.

I made this recipe exactly as prescribed and it was excellent.  I didn't have too much at all.  The best quiche I've ever had.

Delicious!  Added a pinch of nutmeg, used scallions instead of an onion, and used heavy cream diluted with water instead of light cream (that's what I had on hand).  I also prefer to bake bacon rather than pan fry it. Turned out great!

This was very good.  I used just short of 2 cups of Half and Half and the texture was perfect.  I also made crustless (I know, that takes all the fun out of it). :)  I also added sauted mushrooms and onion and a little more than 1 cup of Swiss cheese.  Will definitely keep this recipe.  Thanks!

Used 1 c milk with 1/3 c heavy cream the first time I made this. Also used ham instead of bacon and some nutmeg instead of cayenne pepper. I am making it again tonight with just milk. Both times I made this recipe I used 6 eggs. I would highly recommend sauteing the onion in some butter before adding to mixture. Cover the edges of the crust until the end of bake time.  Delicious and easy to adapt - you can really add anything you like!

This is a classic recipe that is so easy and delicious! I sautee the onions with some garlic, and add asparagus or spinach some times. I use a little less cream than what this recipe calls for. It is great for dinner or brunch with a tossed salad and fruit.

I made this for a Christmas luncheon for 12 elderly ladies.  Normally, these ladies don't eat a whole lot.  But let me tell you, they polished off 3 complete quiches, and probably could have eaten more.  I made one exactly like the recipe, a second with cooked chicken breast, green onion and cheddar cheese and a third with crab, shrimp, tomato and swiss cheese.  All were wonderful!

I don't know what I did wrong to make this well liked quiche turn out SO BAD but I had WAY too much liquid! Only half of the egg/cream mixture would fit. Came out too mushy and I let it cook an extra 10 minutes. Sorry!

Very good! I used 1-1/2 cups half and half instead of cream and baked for about 5 minutes longer but other than that this recipe is PERFECT! I had tried the carnation version and it tasted too milky, the evaporated milk was overpowering.

This was a really good recipe, although I did change a few things.  I added two extra eggs and reduced the amount of cream used to 1.5 cups.  As well, instead of using swiss cheese, I added some extra old white cheddar and chopped fresh Italian parsley.  I got rave reviews from everyone...this one is a keeper!

DEE-LISH!! The only thing I would do different is to lessen the amount of cream like some of the other reviewers suggested and maybe add some spinach and mushrooms for variety next time. Other than that this was perfecto! Thanks.

This was a great recipe, however, I did make some changes and it came out perfectly and so delicious! I used extra sharp cheddar instead of swiss and I only used 1 cup of light cream, so I did not have to worry about it being too loose and runny like a lot of people had issues with.  Following the lead of another reviewer, I also sauteed the onions in the bacon fat and then drained them.  I also just placed a sheet of tinfoil over the quiche (just placed it right on top, didn't wrap it) after turning the heat down to 300 so that the outer crust did not burn.

After the tragic loss of my favorite quiche recipe, :) I came across this highly rated favorite on Allrecipes. I'm always frustrated at the reviewers drastically changing the recipe, THEN rating it highly, so I was careful to look at reviews. 
Sure enough - 1 1/2 cups cream - NOT 2! produced a very silky quiche. I can't imagine 2 cups. Not to even mention that I made a 9" pate brisee crust, in a normal quiche dish and the 1 1/2 c filled the dish to the brim. 2 cups would have meant pouring filling down the drain. BEWARE. If you do 2 cups, scale everything up a bit and be prepared to use a deep dish!

This may have been for a 9" pie, but if so, it was a deep dish.  I added an extra egg to offset the extra liquid and eliminated the salt and sugar (the bacon and cheese has plenty of salt).  I had to bake my pie for nearly an extra 45 minutes at 300.  Actually increased the temp to 325 and still it  took that much extra time.  The flavor, however, was wonderful.  So, if I make this again, I  have to adjust the liquids down to 1 1/2 cups or maybe even 1 1/4 cups light cream in order to follow the baking temps and times in the recipe.  When it was finally done, everyone loved it.  What more can I  say.

I love this quiche; it is simple yet delicious.  I reduced the cream to 1.5 cups, added some spinach, subbed out the cayenne pepper for 1/4 tsp. black pepper, and omitted the sugar altogether.  I also cooked the onions just a bit, and added about a teaspoon of minced garlic.

Perfect!  I used Half & Half and added mushrooms, sweet bell pepper,fresh dill, a pinch of garlic powder.  I didn't saute the onions first and the quiche was delicious, but next time I will since many of the reviewers liked it that way.  I also used a bag of star-bought real bacon bits.

This recipe was a hit!  I accidentally bought half and half, but it worked very well and cooked well.  I used 1.5 cups of half and half, no onions ( I threw in some onion powder into the egg mixture) and I used a Pillsbury pie shell which you have to bake first, but makes for a fresh, delicious, easy crust!  I only used 8 slices of extra thick Oscar Meyer bacon and didn't add the cayenne pepper.  This was my first ever quiche and I will use this recipe again.

Just made this for a brunch and got nothing but rave reviews! I followed the recipe pretty closely but did omit the cayenne and forgot the add the sugar (what does 1/4 t do for a quiche anyways, right?) Be careful how much salt you add, the bacon is salty as is! I did saute the onions in about a T of the bacon grease which makes the onions a little less potent. Next time I'm going to try a Gruyere instead of the cheap supermarket swiss I used. Not sure why people were getting runny quiches. Mine was perfect and I used all 2 cups of cream. -which does make it very creamy/custardy which yes, may not be the healthiest, but is the most tasty! ;) Make this today, you won't regret it!

Next time I'll decrease the cream because it was a little loose. As far as flavor, it rates a 10+. I didn't use a crust(wanted it crustless)and next time I'm going to use a muffin tin and see how that works.

This is a great recipe for a basic quiche. I use Norwegian jalsberg instead of the swiss, adds a bit more taste. Also, you do not need 2 cups of light cream, 1 cup is more than plenty.

Loved the flavors of this - the cayenne really added some nice spice although I didn't measure and probably got a bit more than called for.  Per previous reviews, I used about 1/3C heavy cream and 1C milk with the 4 eggs and was pleased with the consistency.  Also caramelized the onions first.  The only change I will make next time is to pre-bake the crust a bit before filling.

Fabulous!  Thanks for the recipe.  This has become a Christmas morning tradition at our house and everyone loves it.  I forgot the swiss and used shredded Jarlesburg this year and oh my, what a difference.  It was the best ever and it just made the quiche even better.  I also suggest either a bigger pie crust or a 3rd one because there is always extra egg mixture.

Pretty good, easy recipe for quiche lorraine.  However, for the purists out there, a real quiche lorraine should use lardons instead of bacon (although I often use left-over ham, including deli ham approaching its best before date that we just toss in the freezer until next time we make quiche). More importantly, and perhaps this would help those reviewers who found it a bit bland, a quiche lorraine should also have a bit of nutmeg in the egg/cream mixture.  My husband is French Canadian so I learned to make the real thing quickly! :-)

This is the first time I've made or had a quiche, and to be honest, I think I've discovered I'm not much of a quiche person.  But I'm giving the recipe five stars to be fair, because my mother and even my picky sister said it was delicious.  Like many other reviewers, I decreased the liquid (1 cup half and half and a half cup milk) and cooked the onions beforehand.  I made this with a homemade crust and if I were to make this again, I would blind-bake that for ten minutes or so; the bottom came out a little soggy.  I had to cook for an additional 10 minutes before I thought it was firm enough.

I made this on a Saturday morning and it was gone by dinner! Had to make another one on Sunday!  My picky 3 year old boy liked it so much he ate it for breakfast, lunch and dinner! My seven year old daughter loved it also!  The first day I used 1.5 cups of half n half and 5 eggs.  The second day I used 2 cups of half n half and 5 eggs.  We like the second one better.  Will definately make this again!

This was a really good quiche recipe.  I did have to cook it a little bit longer than the recipe called for, until it set up.  Nice texture and flavor.  Next time I might put a little more cayenne.

Made this for a luncheon and it was a smash hit!  Seconds were requested! I used a deep dish pie crust and Baby Swiss cheese that I shredded myself.  Also used 1/2 and 1/2, as light cream was not available at my store.  MMMMMMM-Good!!  Can't wait to make it again...

This was a fairly simple recipe and my family loved it.  I put a little cheddar cheese and added a little more cheese that called for, by doing this I could have actually made two pies.  A cheese lovers delight.

Come on folks - over 75 grams of fat?  817 calories?  I'm not saying it needs to be healthy but seriously, nothing should ever approach THREE BIG MACS worth of fat.  No wonder everyone thought it was so tasty.

First time I tried this recipe. I didn't like the sugar in it at all, so I will leave out the sugar next time. Very easy to make. I cooked it for about 8 extra minutes, but it was a little runny. I'm not sure why. It seemed to be cooked all the way through.

We had this on Christmas Eve with Spinach Potato Soup and Italian Sausages and Crusty Bread.  It complemented it perfectly and wasn't difficult to make.  Everyone loved it!  It was rich so it made a nice accompaniment.  I also added some fresh chopped parsley and a few chopped green onions to my version.  Excellent!

This was easy and very tasty.  I used store bought, pre-cooked bacon to make it faster.  I used an extra 1/4 c swiss cheese and a small can of mushrooms.  Turned out great!

I didn't have light cream so I used half and half and some heaving whipping cream.  I put more cheese and less liquid and was happy with the result.  Next time I may put other ingredients like spinach.

Very yummy!  There were no leftovers.  Definately need to use a deep dish pie pan or cut back on the egg and milk mixture.  This is a keeper!

Didn't use a big enough pie crust so all my egg mixture didn't fit.  It made the quiche a little too cheesy.  Make sure you use a deep dish pie crust and next time I will add some cheddar cheese and a little swiss cheese too.

This recipe is great! 
I have never made quiche before. I tried this recipe, and I found it surprisingly easy to make.
However, I switched the bacon to turkey bacon to reduce the fat and used half & half since i couldn't find light whipping cream. 
It still turned out delicious!

When I first added this recipe to my box, it had no ratings.  I gave it a try with a few changes, no cayenne pepper and I cooked the onions first, and it came out wonderful.  I had to cook it longer than the recipe required, but my husband (who is not a quiche person, children, and brother-in-law loved it.  It was as tasty as it was easy thanks alot!

I skipped the sugar. Only put 1/4 tsp. of salt 1/4 tsp. black pepper.  Instead of light cream I used heavy cream.  Was great and will make again.  Oh, I made my own crust.

Whenever I make a quiche, I buy frozen pie shells and double the recipe so I can make two at once. With this recipe, I noticed that I only needed 1 cup of cream per quiche, I think you would end up with a soupy quiche if you used 2 cups of cream for a single quiche! Anyways, I've made a lot of quiches in my lifetime, and this was one of the best!

It was great and easy.  This is the first time I have ever made quiche and it turned out great.  I followed the suggestion of using only 1 and 1/2 cups of whipping cream instead of the 2 cups of light cream.  I sauted the onions first and I also added a 1/2 cup of grated Gruyere cheese to the 1 cup of Swiss.  I made a second quiche and left out the bacon and added chopped fresh spinach and chopped mushrooms for a slightly healthier alternative.  Also yummy!

It was VERY yummy, BUT I had to cook it at 300 for over an hour for it to firm, and that was after decreasing the liquid to 1.5 cups. My favorite recipe has been Basic Quiche by Shelly and I will be sticking with that recipe instead.

After reading the other reviews, I was skeptical about the timing.  I followed the directions exactly and it turned out beautifully.  Follow it and you'll be very happy.  My quiche could be a menu model!!  I don't know how it tastes yet.  I'm waiting for it to cool.

I now make this all of the time.  My family loves it.  I do an apple smoked bacon instead of reg bacon.  It just adds to the already deliciousness of the dish!

I made this pretty close to the recipe .. the egg to milk ratio is the same as I've used in the past, but I was looking for a quiche with a crust ... as I used to make mine crustless.
I only added a little more than 1/8 teasp of nutmeg, but I didn't add the sugar.  I had no problem fitting it all in a deep dish pie pan.
The only issue I had was that the crust was a little soggy ... I used the single crust recipe from this site.  I think the crust needs to be precooked.

It turned out beautiful, after the additional cooking recommended by other users, but I found the Swiss cheese to be a bit overwhelming. Next time I'd mix it with another cheese so my kids will enjoy it too.

This was absolutely wonderful!  I served it for my family and they all said it was one of the best quiches they've had.  My only comments are that all the egg mixture does not fit into a 9 inch pie pan with all the bacon and cheese, it was a little gooey after an extra 10 minutes in the oven and standing for 15 (although mine wasn't runny as some people said) so I think next time I'll cut down to 1 1/2 cups of cream.  Thank you for the recipe, it is wonderful!

This is the easiest, most delicious quiche I have ever had.  I just throw "whatever" in it---mushrooms, spinach--what's in the refridge and it always turns out great.  Everyone is asking for the recipe..

I made this today just because.  And it was very good.  I modified just a bit because I did not have onions and used shallots instead.  And I sautéed them in the bacon grease.  Thank you for the recipe.

I used Pilsbury sheet criossant dough for the pie shell. I also made a few modifications such as shredded pizza cheese and used chopped green onions as well as chopped regular onion. I poured some egg mixture on the bottom, then added some of the shredded cheese both types of onion (which I did not saute first - but it still turned out fine) then I added the remainder of the egg mixture. I topped it off with fried real bacon bits and I then sprinkled lightly with bread crumbs and parmesan cheese and a little more of the shredded cheddar. I was not able to mix all of the cream, but I think that worked out for the best anyway. First time I have made quiche and the first time I have ate quiche and I must say I was fantastic~! Very good - my daughter loved it so much she ate 3 pieces!! I would make this again and maybe try to add a little potato:-)

YUM. This is the first quiche I made and I was very pleased. I used the pilsbury refr. pie crust and on the box it said after the first 15 min. of baking the quiche cover the edges with foil, I am glad that I followed that advice because after the first 15 min. the edges were really brown close to burning. I think it needed to to sit a little longer because it was still kind of liquidy.

Made this for my family tonight. They couldn't stop raving..made my day! The only thing I changed was the cheese, as I didn't have swiss. I sauteed the onion in olive oil. I made my own crust and cooked in a quiche dish. Doing this, made for a thinner quiche, which allowed the quiche to set nicely. I'll certainly make this again. Thanks for sharing!

I made this quiche yesterday for a potluck and got rave reviews.  I made a couple of modifications.  I omitted salt and sugar and reduced cream to 1 cup (based on the reveiws) .  In retrospect, the next time I make this quiche, I will reduce the amount of bacon and keep the amount of cream at 2 cups.  I found that the flavor was very good but the amount of bacon was excessive.  It may very well be that because I used thick organic bacon I did not need to use as much.  This recipe is a keeper.  Thanks for sharing!

This was very good and rich.  It was a bit too fluffy for my taste, so will cut down on half and half next time.  Also made Clark's Quiche, which was a bigger hit.  Both made a delicious Christmas brunch.

It was great!  I took a couple of suggestions and traded the minced onions for green onions and baked the crust 7 minutes before assembling.  Not a bit left!  Next year I'll have to make two.

I did NOT like the fact that the onions were not cooked prior to adding it to the quiche.  Also 425 degrees is just way too high.  It came out very runny and knew that it would. I did fix it.   Eggs should be cooked low and slow (325) for like 45 minutes.  Would have been nice otherwise.  I gave this 3 stars based on the submitted recipe.

This was so light and so delicious, I will definitely make it again! I used spinach instead of bacon and half and half instead light cream. My crust was a store bought whole wheat which I prebaked for about 7 minutes at 425 degrees so I would not end up with a soggy bottom.

I've been making this quiche for over a year now and my family loves it.  It's the only way my 2-year old will eat eggs. I use veggie bacon instead.  I've had it come out runny too, but I figured that's because I'm at high altitude.  A few more minutes in the oven (at the higher temp) does the trick.  Thanks for a keeper!

I made this for dinner tonight and it was simply AMAZING!   I did the same as another person and only used 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream and I beat it until it was frothy.   It came out gooey, but only because I used a full bag of shredded swiss. This was easy to make and I will be enjoying it again and again for years to come.   Thank you for sharing this recipe!

I made this with some leftover bacon and Christmas ham.  It was the perfect consistency.  I cut the cream by half a cup because I like my quiche on the firm side.  I'm also a meat lover and next time I'll add more meat and mabye some green chiles.

this was the first quiche I've made and it turned out delicious.  it took me over an hour to cook ( we're at high altitude) i followed the recipe exactly except i used heavy whipping cream instead of light cream b/c it was all i had.  i think next time i will use a little less cream like others suggested so it's a little less runny.  otherwise it's perfect!

Yummy! The filling perfectly fills two of the frozen Pillsbury pie crusts. I used turkey bacon to cut down on the fat. It tastes pretty good, although the texture is not as nice and crispy as real bacon.

This was very yummy!  I think my pie plate might be a deep one, so I did 6 eggs and 1 1/2 cups of skim milk.  The texture was fine and no guilt with the cream.  I used microwave bacon, swiss cheese, pillsbury refrigerated pie crust and 1/2 of a chopped onion, sauteed.  This came together in 15 minutes. It was so good...I also used 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and cut the salt to 1/2 tsp because the bacon is salty.  I also baked it an extra few minutes.  Everyone gobbled it up!!

The first time I made this quiche, I pretty much stuck to the original recipe with the exception of a couple of things out of personal taste.  I'm not an onion person so I sprinkled dried minced onion over the bacon and cheese mixture.  I also used white sharp instead of swiss cheese.  The result was real good except the texture was really soft and not very 'quichelike'.  The second time, I used only one cup of cream and added two more eggs for a firmer texture.  Next time I will try just a cup of milk.  I also added 2 tsp of dried parsley for a little color.  Overall a very good recipe!

This was very good - I only used 7 slices of bacon (it seems to disappear in my house once cooked! :) ) used light cream, light cheese (but used 1.5 cups) and no sugar - everyone loved it. But... I'm on my way out for a run, LOTS of calories!

Really good recipe.  Next time I will probably cut back a little on the bacon.  But other than that it was great.  Followed over reviewers recommendation to use 5 eggs & less cream and it turned out perfect.  Everyone loved it.

I love this recipe. I have altered it a bit by using a frozen deep dish pie crust and omitting the onions and using a little less light cream. It is good to bring to someone's house. It's easy to whip up in a  pinch.

Delish!  Definitely saute the onion.  I also like to add nutmeg and halfway through cooking, I add thinly sliced red bell pepper on top.  Looks pretty and tastes great.  A keeper.

We used Turkey Bacon and only 3/4 cup cheese and one cup light cream. It tasted great without all that extra fat!

I made a double recipe for a brunch and followed pp's suggestions of increasing the eggs to 5/recipe and decreasing the cream to 1.5c/recipe. I also cooked the onions in the bacon grease. It made enough filling to fill 2 pre-made pie shells (9") and almost fill my 9" pie plate as well- I could've gotten 3 out of the double recipe, so use a deep dish pie plate if you only want one quiche. My only complaint is that it's a little greasy- I think that may come from the extra bacon grease from the onions. Next time, I think I'll dry off the bacon before putting it in the shell, and maybe reserve less grease for the onions to cook in. The flavor is outstanding and my husband loves it, even though he's generally anti-quiche. Keep an eye on it when it's baking, though. These were done a full 20 min early. This recipe is deffinately a keeper!

*edited to add:  With the egg/cream modifications and using a store-bought crust, my calorie count is under 300 cal/slice (1/8th of quiche). Not too bad.

Loved this quiche.  Like other reviewers I sauted the onions in bacon grease and I also added an extra 1/2 cup of cheese.  Yum.

I made individual quiches in small tart pans using a butter based crust. I added a pound of bacon, green onions and a little more cayenne. The filling makes exactly enough for 12 individual 4" quiches. Served at a luncheon with stuffed celery, savory topped grape tomatoes, asparagus and braided breadstick - GREAT reviews and requests for recipes! Thanks for this one!

Haven't made a quiche in years, but this came out perfect. I just used 1 1/2 cups fat free half and half instead of light cream, think I will try with eggbeaters also next time so not so decadent!

I made this for a birthday dinner and it was very good. The only thing I would change is to saute the onions first. I'm not wild about the onions still being rather strong even after baking. Although I like spinach and mushrooms as other reviewers have suggested, that's not a true "Lorraine" recipe. Cheese, cream, and bacon are the standard for a quiche lorraine.

Excellent!  Everyone INCLUDING my husband who thinks that Quiche isn’t “manly man food” loved it!!  He asked me what I wanted for mother’s day and I told him a quiche!!  He was floored at first and then said cool!  We had a tea party for my mum and we all had to make several comments about how good the flavor was.  My DH commented about how easy it was to make also! He said that he forgot the other half of the light cream by accident, but we would have never noticed! Thanks for sharing a great recipe!!  Can’t wait to have it again!

This was my 1st quiche!  It was easy tastes great and makes a beautiful presentation!  

As usual, I did make a few modifications.  I used a deep dish pie crust.  I used half & half ( I used 1 1/2 C. instead of 2 C.) I used 8 oz of swiss and 1 package of low sodium bacon.  I added a  well drained can of spinach.  I used dried chopped onions and 1/4 tsp. dried minced garlic.  I used 1/4 tsp. of McCormic Creole seasoning instead of cayenne pepper.  (It's not enough to make it spicy or alter the flavor much.)

i read through many reviews, both favorable & mixed, prior to attempting this recipe. what worked well for me was to substitute the 2 cups light cream with 1 1/2 cups half & half (first to cut calories, second to reduce the liquid content so the filling would fit into a standard pie dish). i also sprinkled in a 1/2 cup of well drained chopped spinach because we like it that way & spent the extra dollar for real emmenthaler swiss cheese. the baking method & time are right on target, delivering a gorgeous, very yummy quiche. thank you jennifer!

Even though I could feel my left ventricle squeezing shut with every bite, this stuff was wonderful! The flavors are so good together, and I didn't have any problem with it being too runny. (I even added extra cheese, and it was still set in the center.)

THIS WAS A DELICIOUS TASTING QUICHE.  I DID HAVE SOME DIFFICULTY BECAUSE I THINK THE INCREDIENTS SHOULD BE CHANGED TO READ ONE CUP OF LIGHT CREAM.  I JUST MADE THIS FOR THE SECOND TIME AND AGAIN FOUND THAT I HAD TOO MUCH LIQUID FOR THE 9" PIE SHELL. I DON'T THINK IT HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THE DEPTH OF THE PIE SHELL, AS I ORIGINALLY WROTE. ONCE AGAIN I HAD TO DO A LOT OF MOPPING UP AND ENDED UP THROWING OUT A LARGE AMOUNT OF THE EGG MILK MIXTURE. I DID A LOT OF MOPPING UP WHEN TRYING TO CARRY IT TO THE OVEN BECAUSE OF SPILLAGE. I HAD TO PUT THE PIE SHELL ON A COOKIE SHEET TO ENABLE ME TO GET IT INTO THE OVEN AND IT SPILLED ON THE COOKIE SHEET ALSO. I THINK I LEARNED FROM THIS TO USE MAYBE A 12" PIE PAN OR MAYBE ALL RECIPES SHOULD THINK ABOUT REVISING THE DIRECTIONS TO LESS LIGHT CREAM SO WE ALL WON'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THIS RECIPE. EVEN WITH ALL THE DIFFICULTY THE QUICHE WAS VERY TASTY,HOWEVER TOO MUCH MESS. THIS CAN BE RESOLVED. 
THANKS SO MUCH.....

I thought this quiche overall was pretty good.  I'd have to agree with some of the other reviews that suggest cutting out the salt and reducing the cream.  I had a hard time deciding if it was done after baking an additional ten minutes due to the 2 cups of cream.  Great taste though. With minimal changes it'll be perfect!

This quiche recipe was very yummy!  I used Cheddar cheese instead of swiss but it did take a bit longer to cook.  This was a big hit for Christmas Brunch.

This is a very delicious quiche. However, I recommend omitting the salt, because the bacon proides enough. I also used only 3/4 the recommended cream and baked it about 15 minutes longer. Sprinkle parsley on top and it looks professional!

A delicious and easy dish! I had left over egg mixture with the amounts given, so I made another. It was a little runny the first time I made it, so I added just a little flour to the egg mixture, which helped. I also put a little more cheese than called for. The results were even better with this slight modifications. Great for all meals!

Finally!  A woman I used to babysit for when I was a teenager made quiche just like this.  I've been on a mission to find a recipe like hers ever since and this was IT!!!  It was delicious.  Not runny like other recipes I've tried.  I will make this over and over.

I wish I read the reviews first.  I followed the recipe exactly and the crust started to burn when I had the oven at 425 even before 15 minutes.  When I took it out after another 30 minutes, it was mushy!   I also thought the flavor of raw onions was too strong and I do love onions.!  It just wasn't right for this dish.  Onions were overpowering.  IF I were to make it again, I wouldn't cook it at 425 for 15 minutes.  I would use less cream and I would sautee the onions before additing to the quiche and I would cook it longer!  Read the suggestions of the  satisfied users before making this!

Awesome recipe, however I don't see how 2 cups of cream will fit in any deep dish pie crust.  1.5 cups with 4 eggs fit perfectly and was delicious!  I used 1.5 cups half and half, because I could not find light cream.  I also used gruyere cheese since that's traditional, and I cooked the onions in the bacon grease.  I also used a dash of nutmeg instead of the cayenne pepper.  I used a deep dish frozen pie crust, and cooked the quiche 15 minutes on the higher heat and then 45 minutes on 350.  It turned out perfectly and the crust did not brown too much.  I did not have to cover the crust edges with foil!  With these changes the recipe is to die for, so I took away 1 star since I had to make changes.

This was DELICIOUS!
However, it was too salty, so next time I will not use the added salt.
I used 2% milk, only because I did not have the cream as was in ingredients list (less fat this way).
Also, added some spinach as we needed the greens.

I thought the four eggs and two cups of light cream was not a reasonable ratio so I adjusted to eight eggs and one cup half n half.  It turned out perfectly.  I added the salt as suggested but would not do so in the future because I think the bacon I used was salty enough for all.  I also added spinach and sautéed the onions.  Finally, I make my own crusts and have normal pie pans, but they are much deeper than store bought crusts already in pie pans.  With that info in mind - this quiche filled my pie pan perfectly.  For a store bought crust you may wind up with too much of everything.

9 INCH PIE PLATE! Those of you who are having trouble with too much liquid are probably using the wrong size pie plate.  I just made a double batch of this recipe and used two 9" Pyrex glass pie plates.  I made the recipe exactly as shown except I sauteed the onions.  There was no left over liquid and there was no liquid pooled in the bottom of the pie plate.   I expected them to take a little longer to bake because I was baking two quiche at once.  But, they did not take that much longer.  I think I would make this with green onions next tine or scallions.  Very tasty and I would make it again.  I took pictures, but can't figure out how to find them.  This recipe is not flawed at all.

I only used 7 strips of bacon and reduced to 1 and a half cup of whipping cream. Instead of mixing everything together, I first put crumbled bacon on first layer in the pie crust and then part of the cheese along with cooked onion.  Then again layer with bacon and then rest of the cheese so everyone can get even amount of filling each slice.  Oh my goodness, it was so delicious and even my brother likes it and he picked up another slice. Will make this again and again. Thank you sooooo much for sharing this recipe with us.

I followed the recipe exactly (as I do with ANY new recipe), and it tasted WONDERFUL!  I found the texture of the filling to be a bit looser than I expected....creamy, I guess is the word I want.  Different but not unpleasant.  It came as a bit of a surprise, based on my prior experiences with quiche. I knew it was fully cooked, because my tester came out clean.  Again, though, the taste was out of this world, and I finished every single bit of it.  Thanks for putting this recipe into my hands!  I do have to agree, though, with another reviewer, that unless you make the recipe the first time--AS DIRECTED--I'm hard-pressed to take a review seriously when it starts out with, "Great recipe, but here are the 95 ways I just changed it" and then rated their own version instead of yours.  Quiche is not--repeat NOT--supposed to be a "healthy" dish.  It is supposed to be eaten in small amounts BECAUSE it's rich.  After taking all the flavor out of it I wouldn't rate it highly either.  Most of us don't eat this kind of dish every night, but I'm glad I ate this one. I thought it was heavenly!  This one goes on the meal planner--thanks again!

It was okay... Too much cream. I used 6 eggs, 3/4 cup 2% milk, 6 slices of prosciutto, 1/2 cup sharp cheddar, 1/2 cup smoked gouda, half of an onion sauteed, scallions, and artichoke heheartsthe temperature and timing also didn't work because it was still not cooked so I had to increase it to 350 degrees for another 5 minutes and turned on the broiler for 1 minute. Sorry, I didn't follow the recipe at all but mine did turn out delicious if that helps... :)

This is my favorite quiche recipe currently and has been for quite awhile. The recipe has been requested several times when I've made it for other people (as have seconds). It's excellent exactly as written except for one detail: make sure to saute the onions first. Otherwise they turn out crunchy and throw off the texture of the whole quiche. As many other reviewers point out, it tends to need more time. I typically end up giving it an extra 10 minutes before the center is set enough when a knife is inserted. Though the recipe does not need any changes, there are some that I tend to make. I often add an extra dash of cayenne and I usually put in a bit extra onion and Swiss just because I tend to have extra. With some extra onion and Swiss, I can easily fill a 9.5 inch pie crust with the amount of egg/cream filling in the original recipe (making for a slightly larger quiche so we have more leftovers).

a little salty even when I cut the salt down to 1/2, will emove salt next time since bacon and cheese are already salty. Also I cut the cream to 1 cup instead of 2 cups, 1 cup is just enough to make the pie firm

I made this quiche and it was delicious! I modified the recipe to be for eight servings and used a 10 inch round cake pan.  I used a ready-made Kroger unroll and bake pie crust which came out perfect. I used one and three-quarter cup half and half instead of the 2 3/4 cups suggested when the recipe is changed to eight servings. The first time I tried the recipe I used the recommended amount of salt and it was way too salty with the bacon and cheese. This time I used about an eighth of a teaspoon of salt. I added chopped spinach, and also used a three cheese blend rather than just one type of cheese. Other than that I followed the directions and my family loved this quiche!

Love this recipe, kids love it too.  Prep time is a bit longer than 15 minutes as you have to cook and drain bacon.  Also I find two cups of cream usually won't fit, so I start with one and add until shell is full.

I think that the pie crust MUST be DEEP-dish. All the ingredients will not fit in a normal 9-inch crust. Rating is low because of that missing information.

Second time making it I made some changes - used left over ham diced small instead of bacon, 1 cup of 2% milk instead of cream, .5 to .75 cup of mexican cheese and saute a large shallot instead of the onion. First time it was too rich. I would even use it with fat free milk.

Very good, but had to add extra eggs to fill it out, and cut off the second cook-time to only 15 min instead of 30.

Simple, but amazing quiche. Very small "tweaks" were that I sauteed the onion and used heavy cream in place of the light cream (still used 2 cups and it was a perfect custard-style texture). After the initial 15 minutes @ 425, I covered the crust with foil to keep it from burning and I did bake it about 10 minutes longer than the recipe suggested. VERY IMPORTANT: After removing from oven, let the quiche sit for at least 30 minutes. Quiche is really best served slightly warm or at room temperature. I can think of many possible variations of this recipe, but I loved it "as is." A keeper, for certain.

Followed others suggestions and used 5 eggs and only 1 1/2 cup of coffee cream.  Also added some wilted spinach and sundried tomatoes on top with chives that I rolled in the oil of the tomatoes to prevent from turning brown.  The suggested time is perfect.  Serve this in the morning at my B&B and everyone loves it!

I loved this recipe it was like eating a custard pie but for dinner.  If you like custard you will love this. I used sliced swiss cheese and put it on the bottom of the crust as shown on a video showed on this website for making quiche. I also cooked it about 15 min longer for the top to firm up. I also added a little mixed shredded cheese about 1/2 cup it turned out beautiful.  I put all my ingredients on the bottom of the crust then poured the cream mixture over the top. When I took it out of the oven the cream mixture stayed on top and created this custard-like layer (heaven). Hubby did not care for it, too soft for him but I will surely make it for company.  Thank you

The BEST quiche I have ever tasted ..  it was divine!

I made quite a few changes by adding some of my favorite seasonings

I used 1 3/4 C Half N Half 

(I always use half n half instead of milk to cut down on the carbs, this makes the dish lo carb for those who are low carbing

I sauteed the yellow onions in bacon drippins and blotted

I added green onions white and green part (small amount) those were chopped and raw (not sauteed)

I mixed the bacon, onions with a teaspoon of garlic paste in a separate bowl

I added a pinch of cumin and a pinch of nutmeg in addition to the cayenne

I added a half teaspoon dill weed

I used store bought pie shell

I used a full cup grated fresh Swiss

The mixture was just the right amt to fill pan

This recipe is definitely five stars with a slight modification to the liquid portion.  If made as directed, it is just a tad too soft, as many have mentioned.  I first made the recipe exactly as specified.  It was delicious.

Absolutely perfect!  Thank you for a great recipe.

Outstanding! I made this exactly except using some other's suggestion to use 1 1/2 cups cream. Not sure it made that much difference with my pie plate but it was really wonderful! Made it Sunday morning with fresh fruit and hubby commented it was a perfect brunch menu! Thank you!

This is wonderful!! I have made this twice in the past week and plan on making it again! I did increase the eggs ny 2 because I used a larger sized pie pan and omitted the cayanne as we don't care for it. HIGHLY recommend this if you are a quiche lover!

this is a great recipe!  my husband (who is french) loved it and ate the whole thing for dinner!!! - NOT recommended by the way.  he did say that onions were not something he remembered being included.  so, probably i will not include the onions, or maybe just not as much, next time.  but there will definitely be a next time for this recipe!!!  absolutely wonderful.

I used half bacon and half ham so it wasn't so greasy--that's how we make it in Brazil. Also, I had to discard some of the cream because it did not fit the pan!

I thought this was quite good and easy to make as this was my fist attempt at making quiche.  I made mine into individual quiches and plan to use them for boxing day lunch but I wanted to do a test run prior.  I want to add some veggies and such but then it won't be quiche lorraine...lol.

This recipe was really nice. I made it and one of the only things that struck me was that my bacon was a little bit soggy. I will definitely crumble it up and put it on top the next time I make it. The sogginess might have occurred from the amount of time it sat, so I will have to cut down on that as well. Overall, great recipe, I'll try and make it again.

Very Good as is, only thing was I had to bake it for more like 50 mins once I turned it down, and I had cheddar cheese instead of swiss, I also fried up the onions w/ some garlic first as I like fried onions, is fantastic.  But for my husband's tastes it a little too soft, I think next time, I'll add more eggs less cream.

Delicious! I echo the other reviews and recommend less cream. I ended up baking for about 50 minutes and it still looked a little runny in the center.

Excellent!!  But I'm so glad other reviewers mentioned decreasing the amount of cream. I used 4 jumbo eggs & 1 cup cream and baked as directed and it came out perfectly in the time noted in the recipe.  I did have to cover the crust with foil about 15 minutes into baking.

I actually made this for my family about a month ago and they loved it! This was awesome. I did use half and half instead of cream , since that is what I had, and it was wonderful. I'm makingit again this Sunday for a Mother's Day brunch, can't wait!

My family was very happy with this quiche.  I used heavy cream because that's what I had, extra sharp cheddar (I'm not a fan of swiss), and left out the salt (too much in the bacon and cheese).  I will definitely make again.  Thanks!

Really Good! I too only used 1 1/2 cups of fat free half and half, and used one cup of swiss, and a half a cup of Munster cheese. I also used green onions indstead of regular onions because they have a more subtle flavor and it adds nice color too!

This was my first time to make a quiche and it came out perfect! The only problem I had was that it needed to be cooked longer than the recipe stated, I ended up leaving it in for 10 extra minutes and then it was done to perfection. My husband loved it and beleive it or not, we ate all but one peice for dinner! I can't wait to make it again with different ingredients, thanks sarah!

My naturopathic physician suggested that I try to eat quiche more often as a breakfast item. This recipe was a great help!  I pack two pieces of quiche with me in the morning and then eat them in the car after my morning workout. I found that this recipe has too many pieces of bacon, which I cut back about half, and also too much cream. I also substituted Silk soy cream, which has a very nice texture and taste.

I made this with cheese & garlic biscuits for supper and my husband and sons really liked it I will definitely make again. The only thing I changed was to halve the amount of cream, and I'm glad I did. Otherwise it would have been way too runny.

My first ever attemp at a quiche, and it turned out great!! The only changes I made were cooking the onions as others had suggested, and adding some spinach which I had to use up. I had enough for two 9-in pie crusts, so as I live alone I hope it freezes well!!!

This quiche was great ! As suggested by other reviewers, I reduced the amount of cream and used 1 cup of light cream (10%).  I also tried this recipe with ham instead of bacon and it was great. But I do prefer the version with the bacon.

Turned out pretty good- however the pie shell wasn't big enough, so I had leftover egg/cream mixture which I threw out. I made it at my boyfriend's house and they didn't have any tsp/tbsp so I just guessed on the amount. Made it so bacon was only on one side of the pie and used about 6 slices. Overall, he loved it and went back for seconds. Next time I will try a deeper dish and following the instructions. :)

Excellent! My partner and I both enjoyed it very much. It was very tasty, the mixture was just right for one tart and the cooking time stated gave me a wonderful result, not over or under-cooked. I bought rindless bacon bits, so guestimated the amount to use. I also used bought shortcut pastry sheets since they'd been languishing in my freezer for quite awhile. Next time I will reduce the salt, blind-bake the pastry shell first and perhaps try a homemade pastry. The egg mixture is excellent, and provides the perfect starting point for an endless variety of quiche fillings.

This quiche is excellent. I actually looked up this recipe for a friend who was wanting to make a quiche Lorraine and didn't know where to find a recipe. Then I got to craving a quiche! The whole family loved it; the flavor was excellent. I did cook it about 5 minutes longer the second time around because it wasn't completely set after 30 mins (even after waiting 10 mins to cut it). Enjoy!

I used finely chopped chives instead of onions for colour, white pepper instead of cayenne, omitted the sugar and added 2 tbsp of grated parmesan cheese. It won rave reviews! only thing was I ended up with too much filling even though I used only 3 eggs because I don't like too firm a quiche! I then baked the extra filling separately as a crustless quiche and that was gobbled up real quickly too. Think I'll use 3 eggs but maybe only 1 1/4 cups of cream next time. Overall - delicious!

Yum Yum Yum! I will also recommend a deeper pie shell. The store I was at only had the regular ones and the egg mix was too much for it. Next time I will try a different store to get a deeper shell. Very good though!

This was very good.  I altered it a little by using ham instead b/c it was easier for the baby to chew.  I did find that the egg/cream mixture was just too much for the quiche, so I used the leftovers in the Spinach quiche.  If I was only making one quiche, I might use a make a little less of the egg/cream mixture.

This was my first quiche and it was absolutely delicious. If you are planning using a store bought crust, be sure to use use the "deep dish" kind or else you won't be able to fit all that yummy filling into the dish.

I used skim milk instead of cream to reduce the calories and it still turned out delicious, though the baking time was a little bit longer than the recipe called for.  If you like quiche at all, you will also enjoy Easter Meat Pie on this website...I give both this recipe and Easter Meat Pie two thumbs up!

Great recipe! I made this for Christmas brunch and everyone loved it. It may sound difficult, but I stacked the bacon up and cut it into small pieces then fried it. it makes the pieces smaller and the texture of the quiche better.

I made it to bring to a shower, it came out great. I've made it again, tossing in some different cheeses (cheddars and the like) and they added some wonderful flavor to it. I also used 1 cup skim and 1 cup light cream just to cut the fat content and it came out just fine. It's a great recipe that you can play with and adjust to your tastes.

Wonderful, simple quiche recipie.  Rich enough to satisfy my "meat and potatoes" husband!  I used a mix for my pie crust, half and half for the cream shredded my own swiss cheese and it turned out wonderfully!

Turned out fabulously! I added a bit of shredded spinach, which gave it nice colour.  I will certainly make it again!

This was amazing! I'm not really great at cooking but this was so easy to make and quick that I wasn't intimidated. Actually had fun. Replaced onions with red bell peppers and celery. Everyone LOVED it. ^.^ It was the only dish on Thanksgiving that was completely gone in a flash. Made another one the next morning replacing bacon with honeyed ham and swiss with 3 cheese. Still delicious. Thank you so much!

This quiche was amazing!! I am on a diet, and miss cooking, so I made this for my friends at work.  They all raved about it, and it was gone momentarily! I used a great tart pan with the side that comes off.  It gave the crust that wrinkled look and made it appear like I had done it myself!  The crust turned out flaky and buttery.  It was a hit!  I followed other peoples suggestions to add more cheese (2/3c cheddar and 1/3c extra swiss) It made a little too much filling, so I just tossed it out.  No big deal.  This was a great recipe!  It was simpleand very professional looking!

Mine was a little underdone in the time suggested - would've given it an extra 5-10 minutes, but I assumed it would set-up a bit better during that last 10 minutes.  All in all, a good recipe - though I did add more cheese than it called for and split it 2/3 swiss and 1/3 cheddar.

I LIKED THIS RECIPE, BUT NEXT TIME I THINK I WILL TRY HALF AND HALF INSTEAD OF THE WHIPPING CREAM.  IT TASTED VERY RICH.  ALSO I HAD TO COOK MY QUICHE 15 MINUTES LONGER THAN SUGGESTED.  IT WAS GOOD.  I HOPE YOU TRY IT.

Here’s a concept...I made EXACTLY AS WRITTEN :) and it was wonderful! Light, not dense at all. Love this recipe. I’ve also made with diced ham...just as good. I was able to fit all into a 9” DEEP dish pie crust. It was to the top but it fit.

This quiche turned out great! I used 1 1/2 cups of cream after reading other reviews. I had leftover frozen easy pie crust dough which I used.  It turned out great. I had to cook for 15 minutes longer than recommended but I blame this on my putting the glass pie pan on top of a metal cookie sheet in the oven.  After removing the cookie sheet, the crust took the extra 15 min. to cook.

Great recipe.  I read some of the other reviews and am confused...  I have made this recipe many times and it turns out perfectly....  It all fits in the pie plate and sets up well. Be sure to let set for 10 to 15 minutes after taking out of the oven to allow the cheese to set... Also, I would expect it to be runny if adding mushrooms and / or spinach both are mostly water.

Excellent with modifications suggested by other reviewers. Also it is enough for close to 2 pie crusts (store bought).
Doubled the onions and sauteed with garlic. 
Doubled the cheese.
Used 14 strips of bacon instead of 12.
Required a smidge more cream. 
I make it frequently and freeze one fully baked quiche  for later.

I've made this twice and it's come out good both times. I reduced the cream by half and also added a quarter cup of chopped red bell pepper - mainly for the color and a little bit of texture.

I used heavy cream. I agree with some of the others. Too much for 1 pie crust. However, used deep dish crust and had to throw out a little bit of mix. Also had to cook it for an extra 1/2 hour. Still, delicious.

Thanks for the recipe Laundrie - my Quiche Lorraine turned out great!!  I did make a few changes:  as previously suggested I only used 1 1/2 c. of half-n-half (it would have overflowed if I used 2 c.), baked for 5-10 mins. longer, and I used more cheese and onion.  I also added 2 pinches of dry mustard to the wet mix.  The quiche consistency was a perfect creamy custard mixture.  The only thing I might do different next time is to mix the ingredients in the egg mix before pouring, that way it's part of the batter (my husband didn't like it only on the bottom).  This is also a great base for other types of quiches.  Thanks again for sharing!

I just couldn't help myself and added about 1 cup of fresh minced spinach to the pie. I love my veggies.

Best quiche I ever made, thanks to this recipe and getting the correct egg to cream ratio to make a creamy egg custard, instead of scrambled egg texture.

One thing I did differently was I added the bacon, cheese, and onion and baked with the shell for about 10 minutes; then I added the egg mixture.

The result was delicious, and the custard was pronounced.

Thank you.

I made this gluten free with a gluten free crust. Also used leftover ham rather than bacon.   It got raves from the family, regardless of whether they have celiac or not.  Will definitely make it again.

I made this today and made my own crust. I baked it exactly as directed and let it sit 10 minutes as directed before serving. Even the first slice came out perfectly and my husband loved it. This is definitely going to be my go recipe for quiche!

Like many who have commented, I had leftover mixture.  This could work in a deep-dish crust.  I also found it was not done in the amount of time suggested and needed to be firmer.  I used half and half so I don't know how much that affected the outcome.  Overall, it was still delicious.  I will make again with some of the adjustments others have suggested.

Simple enough recipe and I'll definitely make it again.  I followed the advice and only used 1 1/2 cups of light cream.  Since I over shredded the large block of Swiss cheese, I ended up putting in a rounded cup but I'm sure it didn't make a difference.  I also stuck the pie crust in the over for 6 minutes before adding everything in.  As others have said, there is no way another 1/2 cup of milk could have fit into the pie crust, especially since I think it could have used more bacon.  I also followed the advise and sautéed the onion with the bacon grease and since I don't have cayenne pepper, I used crushed garlic which I sautéed with the onion as well.  It turned out great for the brunch and there wasn't any of it left.

Very disappointed.  I followed the above recipe precisely, but the saltiness made it inedible by me and my guests. I even made another using spinach instead of bacon, and it was inedible as well.   I clearly remember adding the 3/4 teaspoon salt that the recipe called for.

Super tasty! I used Pillsbury crust and baked t before adding the mixture in. I used 1.5 cups of 10% cream and cooked it at 300 degrees for 50 minutes rather than 30 as the recipe suggests. Would make again!

The smell is the best thing I have ever smelt! I used a store bought crust and pre baked it. I quadrupled the recipe (I’m feeding a lot of people) and I only had five cups of cream instead of the recommended eight and it turned out well. It needed like 30 extra minutes but the top is nice and crispy. I absolutely love this recipe!!!

I only used 1 1/2 cups of cream as well, used 10 slices of bacon and added 1/3 cup of good medium cheddar to 1 1/4 cups of Swiss cheese and a pinch or two of nutmeg. It was delicious. It was a perfect consistency and got rave reviews.

Awesome recipe! Made a few changes, sautéed the bacon drained most of the grease and then sautéed the onions with the bacon and the remaining bacon grease.  Used 1 3/4 cup heavy cream and 1/2 cup milk, added 1/4 cup shredded cheddar cheese, did not add sugar.  Started layering the bacon/onion with the cheese, made four layers.  It was amazing, our daughter who cannot stands eggs liked it.  High recommended.

I followed the recipe but used leftover ham and used half heavy cream and milk because that's what I had on hand.  I did saute the onions beforehand in butter.  I found this recipe creamy and delicious and would make again.  While I understand the preference for a firmer quiche, this was a special treat and the creaminess made it special for us.  Would make again!

Made exactly as is.  The best quiche I’ve tasted. I bake then cut it into slices and freeze it.  When I want a quiche I take 1 slice out of the freezer heat it up and have it with a salad. Delicious

Good basic recipe but the 2 cups of  half and half is way too much!.  I use a deep dish crust and I add just one cup cream and 5 eggs instead of 4, comes out perfect every time!.

This recipe made the lightest quiche.  Guest who ate it asked if it was made with egg whites.  I mixed 1:1 ration of half and half and heavy whipping cream because I couldn't find light cream.  I also used pancetta instead of bacon.  Delicious!

Great recipe...I made one quiche with the ingredients listed and a second with Cougar Gold cheese and WSU Coug sausage (quiche laCoug). Both were a hit with my football crowd the morning after a win by the Cougs.

I scaled this down to 3 servings, using a small, round casserole dish that I lightly sprayed with cooking spray. I made this crustless (like a lot of quiches I make), and it came out great. I saw comments about the onions being crunchy, so I sauteed them in 1 tblsp of butter for about 5 min. I layered half bacon, half cheese and half onions, and repeated. I wanted to use up what I had on hand, using micro-bacon and 1/2 regular milk and 1/2 heavy whipping cream. Cooking times worked very well. I tried some after 10 min (couldn't wait!); a little loose at that time. Delicious tasting Quiche Lorraine; just how I remember it. Once it sets up in the fridge, the texture will surely improve. Thanks - great recipe! UPDATE 10/26/17: My hunch was right. Much better texture the next day, just delicious!

I sauteed ham, onion and green onion; layered it on top of the crust; added (de)frozen mixed vegetables and spinach; and after pouring on the egg mixture (made with sour cream),  decorated the top with cherry tomatoes that were drained earlier. I forgot about the cheese--but it was good!
The method of using a hotter oven at first and then lowering the temperature seems to make for a crunchier crust.

Very nice recipe, I always read other reviews where some ppl do adjustments I had a 10 inches store bought crust,I bought bacon bits and used green onions instead of regular onions,I also added spinach I cut the cream to 1 cup as some reviews suggested i follow the rest of the recipe it came out nice i thought it was actually dry not runny at all next time I might add more cream,and make sure you cover the edges with foil cuz it came out too dark lol but overall it's a keeper!

Perfect in every way. I had no problem fitting it into a 9in deep dish pie shell. I did leave out the sugar and I didn't think it would add anything. I've made it twice in the past 2 weeks. Yum

A family favorite--we have made this recipe many times.  I pre-chop the bacon while frozen and it cooks up nicely. We have tried ham, spinach and other leftover goodies as well.  Wonderful reheated too.

I have no idea what people are talking about with there being too much filling or it not cooking firmly enough. I made this just as the recipe states, except for sautéing the onions and had absolutely zero issue. It was perfect.

Definitely a do-over recipe. Quiche was light and fluffy. I always make my quiche 'crustless' to save on calories, as I'm not a big fan of piecrust. Great recipe. Thanks!

I liked this quiche okay except I think the crust should have been cooked before adding the egg mixture, to avoid the bottom becoming mushy, as it did with this one. Followed the recipe exactly as written. This quiche is a bit creamier than other quiches I've made.

This recipe, as is, makes an extremely runny quiche that is almost inedible.  2 cups of cream is too much.  I would add an egg, add an extra 1/2 C of cheese and decrease the cream by at least 1/2 C (maybe even by one whole cup).

I made it without a crust for my husband who is on the Atkins diet and he LOVED it!! Just pammed the pie dish and put in the ingredients as in the recipe. He cuts out a slice from the refrigerated pie in the morning and micros it got a quick, easy, delicious breakfast.

I use a Corningware 9" (not deep dish) pie plate.  All the ingredients fit perfectly.  I often "cheat" and buy a 9" deep dish pie shell and drop it into my pan. This is such a yummy recipe, everyone in my breakfast club loves it.  Have made it many times.  Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good.  I looked at other reviewers and used one 1 cup of heavy whipping cream and sauted the onions in bacon grease.  I also added some mushroom and spinach.  The pie shell was filled to the brim.  It was soooo good.  Next time i might make it with sausage and use the recomended amount of cream and fill two pie shells.

This is by far the best recipe I've ever had.  EVERYONE loves it and asks me to make it all the time.  I only do on special occasions because it is fairly labor intensive and expensive.  The only change I made is to cook the bacon in the microwave on paper towels.  I would think frying it would make it too greasy, but never tried.  10 stars!!!

I've made this a few times and it always comes out beautifully! I never have light cream on hand, only heavy and it makes it very creamy but not too rich (at least, not by _my_ standards...lol). I've also never had a problem getting it to fit in my pastry shell but then I use a fluted quiche dish and not a pie pan and that might be the difference. I also sautee the onions before adding them to the cheese & bacon. I subbed the cayenne with chipotle powder (same amount) and it was the perfect hint of ...something...that made the flavor end just right. This is our favorite quiche!

Like most others, I used 1/2 cup less of light cream (and substituted for whipping creme) to make less runny and a firmer consistency; I also added 1/2 Grueyere cheese to add on that texture and a little richer flavor.  I sautéed the onions in baconfat beforehand to soften just a bit.  I think it's important to mention that you should use a deep dish crust as well.  In assembling the bottom layer,  i spread a very thin layer of dijon butter and then baked the crust alone for 5 minutes just to crisp it.  Then I layered a thin layer of cheese, the bacon and onions, and the rest of cheese before pouring the egg mixture over making sure that it saturated well into the cheese and layers all the way to bottom by slightly patting it down.  I let the quiche settle and marinate like that for about 5 minutes before putting in the oven.  Cooking times and temperatures worked for me.  Very tasty and traditional quiche.  YUM.

I've been making this recipe for 35 years.   It's always perfect.   Sometimes I use whipping cream, and beat it  until it starts to thicken just slightly.   .   It makes the quiche really fluffy and light.   I have also substituted Mozzarella cheese for Swiss on occasion, and it tastes great.

The only change was that I didn't have the cayenne pepper but it didn't matter....my hubby absolutely loved it! It's been added to our regular routine of supper meals! Thanks for the great recipe! Oh yeah, it does need to be put in a deep dish pie crust...if not, decrease each ingrediant a little and your good!

It was delicious! Had an almost creamy consistency. I cut the bacon in half, otherwise the pie dish overflowed. Added an extra egg because one of my eggs was small'ish. Used leeks instead of onions because we like the favor better. I will definitely make this again!

Fantastic.  I added ham and tomato to the recipe, and it turned out perfectly - used 2 full cups of half and half milk, unlike some other folks who commented.  Cooked it at 350 for 50 minutes - used a pie shield for the first 35 minutes.  NOT runny at all.  So good, I savored every single bite.

I was so thrilled to make my first Quiche Lorraine.  Turned out great. I've made it twice now. I did alter a few things.  The first time was a little watery so I only used 1 1/2 cups whipping cream as Angelwings suggested.  Then I used more swiss cheese and instead of onions I minced 3 green onions.  Turned out perfect the second time around.

Excellent! I did take the advice of other reviewers and only used 1 1/2 cups of cream. Also sautéed the onion with a couple of mushrooms. One of the best quiches I have had in a long time. Definitely a keeper.

DELICIOUS!  I did bake it at least 20 minutes longer.  I prefer the texture to be more firm.   Also, I used Cheddar instead of Swiss (only because it was what I had on hand).  But, I would highly recommend this quiche and will tryi it with the Swiss next time!

Is a great recipe, I doubled and made two and used heavy cream for most of the light cream, with a little milk.  I used a mixer to whip up the eggs, cream and spices (made it super fluffy).  From there you can make any kind of quiche you want, used the pie shell, spread out extra cheese (added some gruyere), added onions, peppers, drained frozen spinach and even a few mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes.  I just cooked it until a knife inserted came out mostly clean, so no problem at all with it being runny.

Like I said you can do almost anything you want with this base recipe.

This is very good. I'm sure also very high in calories and fat, but go for it once in a while! I find that cooking the bacon in the oven in the morning or even the day before makes the prep time more reasonable since it's way easier to handle the bacon when it isn't searing hot! The family loves this and it is pretty easy to make.

Great recipe!!!  Everyone raved about it.  I used the fattening heavy cream (lol) and I think that is why mine came out perfectly cooked.  Other's had mention theirs was runny… mine was not.  I also sautéed onions and garlic in the bacon fat.  Additionally… steamed some fresh spinach… squeezed it dry and added just before adding the cheese.  
Definitely a bit fattening but great for a splurge!!!

Very good.   Sauté onions before adding.  Hubby loves mushrooms, so I usually saute a few with the onions to add.

This was my first attempt at making quiche, and my group of six 20-something friends *really* wished there was more! | Here are my adjustments: replaced bacon with Morningstar Facon strips with little noticeable difference (I'm not vegetarian.) Reduced whipping cream to slightly less than 1.5C. Used green onions, added fresh spinach. Cheese: 1C Swiss, 1/2C Gruyere (TIP: check the deli counter before you fork over for prepackaged gruyere; $4 worth from the deli was more than enough.) I used a standard shallow premade pie crust, so I had about 1/2C filling left over, and it was still a little messy. I ended up adding 3 more eggs to the remnant and using the leftover facon/cream/onions (which I mixed together rather than layering) to make another quiche, which also turned out great. ***Definitely cover the crust with foil after the first 15 min. I didn't for either quiche and the crust/cheese got a bit dark, but not burnt.*** 
Otherwise, I had no problems with setting; everything was firm and perfect straight out of the oven after the last 30 minutes. 
Total price for ingredients (I had nothing but salt, sugar and eggs in stock): $35

Very nice.  Next time I would cut the sugar in half. I also sauteed the onions in the bacon fat before adding them to the quiche.

Not the best. The best quiche Lorraine recipe is in the Betty Crocker book. I didn't realize it until I tried this one (I couldn't find my book). I would also recommend using proscuitto instead of bacon. It will make all the difference!!!

Came out perfectly. Used 1/2 & 1/2 instead of light cream and made crust of whole wheat flour and butter. Made it for men's breakfast at our house. They apparently liked it; not much left.

I wish I would have read the reviews first. The cook time is taking much longer! I'm pre-baking for morning, because I have an early morning and now it is already early morning and I still have a runny quiche.

I followed the recipe as written, except that I didn't have light cream so used 1-1/2 cups heavy cream and 1/2 cup whole milk.  It fit perfectly in my  9" pie crust and came out with a lovely custard consistency and very nice flavor.  In order to prevent the edges from burning, and to get the bottom of the crust non-soggy, I did bake it in the center of the oven.  I only needed to add a couple of minutes to the cooking time for it to be perfectly done.

I made this for a Christmas Eve dinner and it was delicious. My only changes were to substitute 1/2 of the cheese for grated gruyere and to add a tiny bit of freshly ground nutmeg. I also partiall prebaked the crust and brushed it with egg white so it would stay crisp and flaky. Rave reviews and second helpings all around!

This was fantastic!  A big hit!  Much richer than a normal Quiche Lorraine.

This was good but didn't set up as I had expected it to...although I really enjoyed it. I'll make it again, though...and it might just have been my oven as it is a bit temperamental at times.

Outstanding recipe!  My husband doesn't care for quiche, and he couldn't get enough of this!  I wouldn't have changed a thing, perfect the way it is!

My hubbie said this is the best quiche he's ever eaten. To make a really easy crust I just mixed bisquick with cold water a tablespoon at a time until it was the right consistency. Very easy and good. I also decreased the filling amount by half (perfect), sauteed the onion in some of the bacon grease until soft, and used cheddar instead of swiss (hate swiss). I also had trouble getting this to cook and set so I returned it to 425 for about 5 minutes extra and it was finally ready.

Excellent.  I made it for the family and my picky son had a second serving and then some more the next day.  I would definitely make again.

This is the first quiche I ever made and it is FABULOUS! I added some spinach for veggie value and it turned out perfect. Is on the rotating menu in our house!
