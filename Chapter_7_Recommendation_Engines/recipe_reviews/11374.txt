Great cookies with good chocolate flavor.  To slice, I used thread - wrap a length of thread around the roll, cross the ends, and just pull together - it slices the dough really neatly, and doesn't squish the cookies out of shape.

good concept. but let me ask you something, if you chill melted chocolate, what happens? oh, it turns into chocolate again. if you make this recipe, please substitute cocoa for the chips. if chips are used, the chocolate layer is far too brittle to roll and bakes too slowly in comparison to the white layer.

My cookies turned out tasting and looking great. They made for a very nice presentation. I noticed that the dough is perfect to slice when it has been in the fridge for about 20 min.. no more. The chocolate dough starts to harden too much and crack off if chilled too much. I was very happy with the outcome. Thank you for sharing the recipe.

Wow! Some people just don't understand that pinwheel cookies are not the easiest things to make... I do think that if you have time, and put some effort into it, these can be the most amazing!

I love these cookies.  I ate a lot of them before my brother could get to these.  The difficult part is getting the two parts even.  I prefer to use less chocolate chips to help with the flexibility of the dough.  But these always turn out wonderfully.

I am a cookie maker extraordinaire, but had never made pinwheels when my granddaughter asked me to make cookies with her.  She wanted half vanilla and half chocolate, so we started on these.  first it took ALL day.  Second, they were great.  the shortbread recipe  is perfect.  I had the same problems the others here had, the vanilla side is too soft and the chocolate is too hard.  I think cocoa would remedy this. We also use silicone baking sheets instead of wax paper and this helped a lot.  My suggestions are:  don't divide the dough exactly in half, when you add the chocolate chips, you are adding volume so you'll need to separate out a little bit more vanilla so they will come out equal in the end.  Don't worry about how they look before you cook them, they might not look like perfect pinwheels, but, cooked they will turn out fine as my picture show.

I always read the reviews before i use on of the recipes here. I followed the recipe exact for the most part. I used only half of the amount of chocolate and instead of leaving one half plain i mixed melted white chocolate in with it. The chocolate was a little thinner than the white chocolate so i rolled the white chocolate layer out and then spread the chocolate overtop and then rolled into a tube. After about 15 mins in the fridge they were ready to cut. And they baked perfectly. So to all those who said chocolate makes it too brittle you have to cut them right away.... they are not overnight cookies if they were they would say black and white overnight cookies. Everyone loved these cookies they didn't even make it to the next day!!!

Made these cookies for a party and used almond extract instead of vanilla and they were great. I did not refridgerate chocolate dough as long so it did not harden. They turned out good but I would double my recipe next time. Too much work and time to prepare for me.

I made a real mess of this recipe!!  After chilling, the chocolate dough was too hard, the light dough too soft, and I ended up with a marbley log...they taste good, but it was not the outcome that I expected.  I had better luck with a recipe with cocoa powder.

I loved these cookies, and so did my guests! To resolve the 'sticky dough' issue, I rolled each half of the dough in between 2 sheets of parchment paper to the desired thinness, then peeled one side of the parchment paper off, carefully layered the chocolate and white dough halves together.. and rolled my pinwheels out!  This is already a holiday tradition for me!  Thumbs up, and thanks for sharing the recipe!

Decent recipe of an old time favorite.  I like the melted choc. chips for the rich chocolate flavor.  Dough was not too difficult to work with when chilled enough.  For the 1/2 cup butter I did...1/4 cup butter and 1/4 cup shortening for a softer cookie. Good recipe!

These were so delicious and turned out beautifully because the dough was so simple to work with. Certainly using floss to cut the cookies is helpful. So is really chilling your dough so that it isn't sticky. It takes time and patience to roll these nicely.

One other suggestion: divide the dough into a third and two thirds. By the time you add the chocolate chips to the one part, you end up with so much more chocolate dough that you don't get as much vanilla flavor in the cookie.

I think it will taste fine, if I can ever make the cookies...  The dough was unmanageable.  It stuck so hard to the wax paper that I think I lost 1/4 of the dough.  I decided to chill more.  Didn't help.  I'm not hopeful for good looking cookies.

I've done this kind of two-toned, two-flavored fridge cookie before, so I knew making these would take a little more effort than usual. Part of the extra effort is having to melt chocolate rather than using cocoa, but that's also the recipe's saving grace. The chocolate dough is pretty good methinks. But the dough for these pinwheels was sticky and more trouble than most. So I too put the dough in the fridge to stiffen it up. But then I had a difficult time getting the dough to pinwheel. I ended up with striped cookies. There are worse things in the world certainly.

Dough is very difficult to work with. The white dough was too sticky to roll out, so I chilled both doughs-- after an hour, it was still sticky, and the chocolate dough had stiffened so that when I rolled it, it cracked. I ended up with cookies that looked like a mosaic, not a pinwheel. The flavor was not worth the trouble, the butter flavor was too strong and the chocolate didn't offset the oiliness enough. An okay cookie, but not worth the trouble. I'll stick to my peanut butter pinwheels from now on.

Very easy to make.  Cookie comes out a little on the dry side but the chocolate part is very flavorful.  Great for dipping in hot chocolate or a cold glass of milk!
