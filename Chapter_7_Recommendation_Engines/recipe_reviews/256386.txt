Creamy and delicious!  I used non-dairy coconut milk eggnog instead, and Silk Protein Nutmilk in place of Half-and-Half, as well as using about 1/2 the amount called for.  Tastes amazing.  Will make again.

Itâ€™s a good way to use leftover egg nog and I sprinkled cinnamon on the top but I will continue using my all milk recipe as a favourite!

Wonderful!  We had leftovers from the holidays and used them up to make this yummy treat.  Even my teens who said they did not like rice pudding liked it.  I added a little cinnamon too.
