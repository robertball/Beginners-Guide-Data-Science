Nice blend of flavors.  To reduce cooking time, I used canned black beans and cooked the sweet potatoes in the soup, instead of steaming seperately.  I've also made this with smoked sausage and prefer it over the Italian.

This recipe is absolutely delicious! I made this because it combines two of my favorite ingredients (black beans and sweet potatoes) - the sausage doesn't hurt either. I made mine extra thick by pureeing most of the beans; I also cooked my sweet potatoes in the microwave (just peel and stick them in for 7 minutes) before slicing them. I also added some sauteed onions and cayenne pepper for spice. Great recipe!

I know this sounds strange however, I, personally, don't care for soups that resemble pumpkin pie...  I don't care for sweet soups, I guess, and I prefer to not make sweet potatoes sweeter...  I took the premise of this recipe and, instead of Allspice, used Cajun spices in it's place (Morton & Bassett "Cajun Spice Blend", which is all natural, "salt free", no msg, etc.) as the bulk of my actual seasoning in this soup...  I also used Cajun Classiques Creole Seasoning (DOES have lots of salt) to taste...  I used 1/2 a healthier (lower fat) Kielbasa sausage vs. Italian or Smoked...  I cannot tell you how outstanding this soup is!  Essentially, I am TRYING to  cook Diabetic for myself, yet, my family keeps hounding me for this soup!  The hordes descend the second I make this!  Help!  LOL

Delicious. I used canned beans and cut back on the water. Also cooked the potatoes in the soup instead of steaming. Next time I will blend all the beans to make a thicker soup and add another can of a different type of beans to eat.

Very interesting flavours!  My husband loves sausage, so this soup was a hit with him.  It was also a good way to work black beans and sweet potato into a meal.  I forgot to puree 1 cup of the beans and liquid, so ours was quite liquidy, but very good nonetheless.  I also used canned beans, so I reduced the water and cooking time a bit.

This was a hit with the family.  I used smoked sausage the first time and the second I used Jimmy Dean hot sausage.  That was really good, hot and lightly sweet.  I also used roasted onions instead of using green onions. I wasn't sure how the black beans would look in the soup so first time I used navy beans.  Both beans were good in the soup.

This had a good flavor.  No rush, but I wouldn't mind making it again.  Changes are as follows:   1) Used 2 cans of black beans, rinsed. 2) Used 8 cups chicken broth. 3) Used 1 lb sausage. 4) Caraway instead of allspice. 5) Cut potatoes up into small pieces and cooked with everything else. 6) Did not use tomato paste because I didn't have it...didn't miss it.

This is a very good soup.  I have made this several times, and it never fails to please.  I always add random vegetables from the fridge/freezer, such as corn, beans, and carrots.  I always cut up the sweet potatoes (without peeling) and dump them in the soup to cook.  The Italian sausage is easier to cut into pieces if partially frozen.

This recipe is great! I live in Japan and could actually find almost all of the ingredients to make this soup. I substituted okonomiyaki sauce for the worcestshire sauce. The sweet potatoes and the sausauge created a sweet and spicy taste. I had no problems with my beans cooking in the 50 minutes. Just make sure to SOAK your beans overnight or for 8 hours before boiling.

It was okay but not really great. It's visually a little weird, but the flavors are good enough. It seemed to lack a bit of oomph.  The first word out of the family's mouth was, "It's missing something." Then my son put hot sauce on it to make it a bit better. With three teens I seldom have leftovers of anything, but this had plenty. And we all opted for PB&J rather than eat leftovers for lunch.

Used andouille cajun spiced sausage links.  Added one large russet potato and cooked potatoes in soup, rather than steaming separately.  Added cayenned red pepper too.

this recipe was good.  it requires fairly close monitoring though.  i kept having to add more water, as the soup was getting "sticky".  also, the italian sausage i purchased came in natural casing, so cutting it up was not really a feasible option, so i just squeezed it out of the casing and made tiny little meatballs out of it.  not as spicy as i had hoped for...

I thought this soup was delicious and very easy to make. I also used canned beans and I added the potatoes to the soup and simmered until they were soft. I waited until it was done simmering then put it all in the blended for a couple seconds to get a nice consistency. A little spicy for me since I did add extra sausage. My husband loved it. I will definitely make it again.

This soup is out of this world! I used canned beans (which I will put through the food processor first next time), and some hot Italian sausage that I had left-over, and it was delicious!  My whole family loved it.  I'll have to make double next time!

I was very disappointed in this.  We did not like it AT ALL so I'm sure I must have done something wrong.  It was really bland and very unappealing as it looked like black sludge.  I hate to waste anything, but I threw it out.

This would have been SO GOOD if I hadn't forgotten to lower the heat!  :-( !!  I used Italian turkey sausage and needed additional water and chicken broth (even before I semi-burned it).  I hope that the 8 servings was referring to a first-course soup; we had it as a meal and it served 4 very well.  We topped it up with low-fat sour cream and served with 9-grain bread.  I'll DEFINITELY make this again, but this time I WON'T BURN IT!

SO yummy!!  I love anything with sweet potato.  I used hot turkey sausage and took them out of the casing.  I rolled them into mini meatballs and cooked them in some olive oil in a pan separately.  I added them and the uncooked sweet potato at the end and cooked for about 20 minutes. I also used one can of black beans and one can of kidney beans.  SO SO SO GOOD!!!!

I also use canned beans to reduce the time and cook the sweet potatoes in the soup.  Instead of Italian sausage I use fat reduced Smokies.

Awesome.  I had everything except allspice, so i added a dash of cinnamon hoping it wouldn't ruin it, but it turned out great.  It ended up with a gravy-like consistency and taste, which is great when you know there's no gravy in it.  I used canned black beans. I cooked the cubed sweet potato in the microwave and added it close to the end.

We've made this soup many times and it's a hit with my family (including a picky husband and a three year old) every time.  We've even served it to company and received rave reviews.  The only change we make is to use smoked kielbasa instead of Italian sausage.  It's scrumptious!

I've made this a couple of times, this time I was out of Tomato Paste and used Chili Sauce...it worked out fine.  This is a soup that is always better the longer the flavors infuse. I always like it better the second (and the third!) day.

A delicious soup! I added 1.5 tsp. of cayenne pepper to give it some kick, which was perfect.  I also ended up adding almost a whole can (additional) of chicken broth throughout the cooking process in order to keep the soup from becoming too thick.  Even with the added broth, it was still pretty darn thick.  Even better over rice the next day, and kept for well over a week in the fridge.  A keeper!

I really love this soup. I'm a huge fan of black beans and sweet potatoes! I added crushed red pepper because I like a little spice w/ my black beans. The sweet potatoes with the spice were really good together. I also added a lot of chicken broth - maybe 2 cups because the soup was so thick. A little sour cream as a garnish and it was perfect! Thanks for the recipe!

We had to pressure cook the black beans since boiling them didn't soften them at all so the recipe was somewhat labor intensive. However, we were pleasantly surprised with the taste. Very tasty. Thanks for the recipe.

Delicious! I used canned black beans and the whole can of tomato paste, along with approx.1/3cup of lentils to thicken the broth.  I essentially added all ingredients to the one pot (tomato paste and cubed sweet potato).  I may add spinach next time!  My husband ranked it as one of the best soups I've made but he has said that for other soups too!  I wouldn't have ranked it a 5 star had I not slightly altered the recipe! It's a keeper!

I made this soup with only a few minor differences from the recipe- I used canned beans and omitted the green onions. I also used about 4 cups low-sodium chicken stock and just a couple cups of water. I was skeptical of the Italian sausage but actually liked the flavor with the allspice & blackbeans. I used hot sausage and the heat was a nice complement to the sweetness of the potatoes. I give it 4 stars because it did seem a bit flat, especially after sitting in the fridge for a day with the sweetness of the potato permeating and dominating the flavor. Next time I make this I will increase the seasonings and maybe add more worstershire to balance the sweetness. Overall though it's still a tasty soup and nice to have something different.

I used Chorizo Mexican sausage, cut it out of the casing, browned it.  Drained the grease and added canned black beans and 2 cups of chicken broth.  Diced the sweet potato and threw everything in the pot.  I did not use allspice since I used Mexican sausage, I opted for Cajun spice....awesome, awesome!!  Hubby LOVED it!!

Was out of black beans and scallions, so I made it anyways.  White northern beans, spicy Italian sausage, and a habanero pepper also, made for an amazing soup, tasty and crazy hot, just I like it.  Thank you for the recipe, and it is a keeper.  It did come out a little thick, but I add a little water every time I heat up a batch.

We like black beans, but my husband and I didn't care for this recipe.
Sweet potatoes and allspice did not seem to fit in with the beans and sausage.Won't make it again.

4 or 5 stars? I made some minor chaanges after reading reviews and checking my cupboards. I used 1/2# of uncooked cajin sausage.Sauteed it with 1/3 C diced onions, and 5 cloves of garlic. I cooked 3 sweet potatoes in the microwave (about 1#) until just barely done. Peeled and added to the pan with the sausage. Added 3-4 Cups of chicken stock and one can of white beans whole and one can of white beans mashed with the liquid from the can. I let this heat up well and then used some instant potatoes to thicken to my personal taste. This was a quick and easy recipe and made 6 servings. I used no other seasonings. This has a little bit of a kick, but we like spicy. I will make this again and may try black beans. We like black beans, but I was worried about the color of the soup with the black beans. I see greens in one of the picture and thought about adding kale or spinach, but had none in the house.

This was delicious! Everyone loved it. I also ate the leftovers the next day....tasted even better. The only thing I changed was instead of using allspice I added a pack of Sazon Goya since that's what I had on hand. I had some fresh parsley, basil and oregano and added some of that as well. Thanks for sharing your recipe.

This recipe is really good when tweaked. I sauteed an onion and celery added cumin and Italian seasoning along with the allspice and bay leaf, Used only chicken broth, added more garlic. Cooked beans with the sweet potato. Added a tomato instead of the paste while blended some. Used Lite smoked sausage. I think the dry black beans are key, tastes much better than can. Topped this off with fresh cilantro and parsley.

Tasty soup, and I used the dry beans, which cooked up just fine. I haven't usedsweet potatoes in soup before, and really liked it. It was quite filling; my problem is getting past the color black beans turn my soups (black- go figure); I believe I will try a different color bean next time - thus the reason for only 4 stars.

I was skeptical at first....but so glad I tried this recipe. I used 2 cans of black beans instead of dried and reduced water to 2 cups. Threw in a few Serrano peppers too. Awesome!

Good starter recipe. I didn't have chicken broth so substituted it with homemade veg. broth (7.5 cups)thus eliminating the needed for the 5 1/2 cups of water. Also, used ground pork sausage instead, sliced sausage would have been fine too.
The only vegetable I added was chopped celery to add a hint of tangy celery goodness.
It wasn't my goal to change this recipe but just adjusted based on what I had in my kitchen!

This was delicious, and my husband LOVED it! I did it my own way, though, because we wanted a "stoup" rather than a soup.  First I browned the italian sausage in the pot that everything would eventually go into, then drained the fat.  Instead of dry beans, I used two cans of black beans that I had in stock, drained, and sauteed them for about 20 minutes with the garlic, broth and spices in a different pot.  Only used about 2 cups of water since 5 1/2 wasn't needed. I pureed the entire pot of beans, liquid, and spices and it created a thicker soup.  After steaming the sweet potatoes, I added them into the pot with the sausage, puree mixture and worcestershire and 1 cup of chicken broth, and let it all simmer for about 15-20 minutes.  Garnished with scallions.  DELICIOUS, and so flavorful!

First off, hats off to the chef! This soup hits the spot. I made a few adjustments to cater to the flavors that my family is use to and to simplify. I sauteed a med. white onion in 1Tbsp EVOO then added garlic and 1/2llb keilbasa diced. I then added cumin, oregano and red pepper flakes. Next I added 2 cans of black beans and 3 cans of water, 2 chicken boulion cubes, 1/2 cup fresh cilantro and the sweet potato. Last but not least I diced fresh tomato and scallions and added those as garnish allong with a little mozzarella.Delicioso!!

I have made this for my family at least 30 times, we love it so much.  We use trader joe's spicy chicken italian sausage to give it a little kick.  Love, love love the flavor - I think cooking the beans from scratch in the bay leaf and garlic gives it flavor and steaming the sweet potatoes before adding to the soup, as the recipe suggests, keeps them from getting too soft and mushy.  Enjoy!

This soup is delicious! I omitted the sausage and honestly didn't miss it. The sweet potatoes are good because they're not too sweet, and they're a great alternative to white potatoes. I recently made this soup to take with me on the road. It travels great and lasts, especially if you put it over rice or grains. Enjoy :)

My husband lifted the lid and frowned. He really liked after eating.  Topped with sour cream. This was wonderful.  I cut the recipe in half, but it only made 2 servings really.

Okay ... so I'm not that impressed with this.  At first I thought it was really bad.  I went back to the reviews and noted that 1 member suggested adding cajun spices so I tried that and it helped.  (enough for us it eat it for dinner)  It took about an hour to cook the beans and that is WITH soaking them over night.  Sorry but the look is really bad and the taste is just OK.

We loved this soup.  It's become a new favorite at our house.  I used canned beans and ground sweet Italian sausage.

Very, very good.  I used canned beans and almost made it too soupy because I added too much broth.  I just pureed another can of beans and added that.  It was good the first night, but by the second day it had thickened up and was great.  We even used it as burrito filling for the kids and they loved it.
