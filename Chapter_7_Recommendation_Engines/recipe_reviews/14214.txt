It wasn't bad but I don't think adding the yogurt made it that much better than just using mayo.

My daughter needed to bring a salad to a potluck. We were low on ingredients to add to the salad. I came across this recipe and modified it somewhat. Instead of turkey she used ham. And she took a chance using vanilla yogurt instead of plain. The salad was a hit. The sweetness of the yogurt went well with the ham. Tomatoes were also added. Thanks for the recipe.

I make this with the mayo/yogurt combo and LOVE it.  I use Nancy's Organic Plain Honey Yogurt.  YUM!!!  It gives it a "fresh" taste.  For vegitarians, just substitute Turkey for veggies:  Bell Pepper, broccoli, peas...Its really pretty with orange/red/green bell peppers

Delicious!! I used a smoked turkey leg (which I diced), Wacky Mac spiral noodles, yellow onion, light mayo, and light sour cream instead of yogurt. I'm sure I'll make this again and often. Thanks for the great recipe!

Great recipe! I didn't have green onion, didn't even have a yellow onion, so I used1/4 cup French's onions crushed. I also added 1/4 cup milk to make the dressing creamier. Will be better prepared next time!

I thought this was okay, but it was nothing special. I liked the idea of using 1/2 yogurt and 1/2 mayo, though. I did make a few changes, but still this salad was missing seasonings and the added ingredients. I cut the dressing in half and it was plenty. I just added salt to taste, the turkey has plenty of saltiness. I also added tomatoes, peas, and some spices. As is, when I tried it, it was just really just mayo, noodles, and turkey.

I didn't care for the added yogurt. Next time I would leave that out all together.
