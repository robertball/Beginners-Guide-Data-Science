I made this for dinner tonight and I thought it was very good.  I made it according to the directions having to add in a bit more of everything because I had 5 boneless pork chops.  I used fresh thyme because I had it in my fridge and it was delicious.  Whaat I did a bit differently was after I prepared the chops in a separate skillet, I transferred them right into the skillet with the onions and apples, placing the chops underneath them. I covered the skillet with a piece of foil while I made a gravy/sauce out of the juices that remained from the pork chops.  I added in a bit of brown sugar, butter, and flour and cooked it for a few minutes before adding in about a cup of vegetable broth.  IT turned out silky and smooth.  I then poured the entire contents of the gravy up over the dish in the other skillet.  
Delicious and very pretty!  I will make this again, probably the exact same way I made this tonight :-)   Thank you for the recipe!

I made this tonight with thick cut boneless pork chops. Skipped the oil. Added a little pepper and allspice (on the pork and in the apple/onion  mixture). After browning the chops in a skillet, I transferred them to a casserole dish and covered them with the apples and onions and stuck them in the oven at about 385 until the pork was cooked in the center. Threw on a couple cardamom seeds too for extra flavor. Turned out pretty well. Finishing it in the oven allowed the juices from the apples and onions to really soak into the pirk and make it nice and juicy.

I cooked the chops separately as suggested by another cook in order to make a gravy.  I also cut back on the rosemary and thyme after reading the reviews.  It was delicious.  Will make again.

I'd rate 3.5 if we could give half-stars.  The thing is, if you were to use the full amount of rosemary and thyme, I don't think you'd be able to eat it!  I used 1 tsp rosemary and just 1/2 tsp thyme and it was just right for me.  Other than that, this was a nice dish.  I even forgot the brown sugar and didn't miss it.  I think it would also be good with white wine as opposed to the apple cider vinegar.  It didn't say to, but I used more oil when I added the pork to the skillet.  I used thin sliced pork loin, because that's what I had, and cooked it just a few minutes per side.  Would make again.

I've made baked chops with apple and onion, as well as in a skillet.  This recipe beats all mine.  It's the only one I'll be using from now on.

Great flavors!   I knocked off about 15 minutes by cooking the 
pork chops in a separate skillet simultaneously. I liked having the onions and apples hot and al dente. I will definitely prepare this dish again.  I used fresh rosemary.  Next time I will make sure to have fresh sage on hand to toss in as well.

I actually made the version I found in the Savory magazine that Giant Food puts out monthly.  It is very similar minus the apple cider and paprika.  It is so delicious I have made it twice now!

This was GOOD!  The only changes I made were to modify it for two people in stead of four and I used fresh rosemary.  We loved it!  Perfect balance of sweet and savory.

This is delicious. I used thicker pork chops and cooked for about 8 minutes on each side. I also used fresh herbs. This recipe is the first pork chop recipe my husband liked and continues to request. If you're not into the apples/onions mixture just don't spoon it on top.

My husband and I both thought this was a wonderful cold weather comfort dish. Served it with pierogies and a green salad.  Plan to make it many more times just as the recipe is presented.

It made the house smell wonderful and also reminded the family of sitting by a fire in the autumn time roasting marshmallows! The apple onion topping was great and the pork chops were yummy, too.

I enjoyed this dish. You must reduce the amount of rosemary  used at least  by 75%. I would  reduce the  amount of thyme by 50%. Otherwise  it was very tasty and easy to prepare.

Easy to make, quick except for my pork chops were thick so they took longer to cook.  My husband enjoyed it too.  Will make it again when I have apples to use up.

Very good, and pretty easy and quick to make.  The pork chops were tender and flavorful.  I used 4 chops and doubled everything, and the proportions seemed just right for us.  I also followed one user's suggestion and made gravy from the pork chop skillet by moving the chops to the apple pan and adding butter, flour, brown sugar, a bit of the sauce from the apple skillet, and broth to the pan the pork chops were cooked in.  Served with mashed potatoes.  Yum yum!  Will definitely make again.

I made this last night for supper.  I did use 1/2 of the thyme and rosemary as 2 teaspoons seemed like a lot for 3 pork chops.  I also added a little bit of water  (1 Tablespoon) to the pan at the end to get the brown bits into the dish.  My mom made something similar when I was a kid and eating this brought back good memories.

This was a very quick, easy recipe.  I added craisins to the apples for a little extra zing and cut back on the rosemary and thyme.  Turned out perfect.
