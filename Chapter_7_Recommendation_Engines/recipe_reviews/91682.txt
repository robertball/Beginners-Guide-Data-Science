This was simply the best!  I made it for guests last night and it was a rave.  My butcher (a first class cook) strongly advised me to use beef flap steak, which is already cut pretty thinly and has a lot more flavor.  The only other change I made was to add 2-3 whole spinach leaves, blanched, to each roll.  A bit more nutrition without affecting the flavor.

This recipe was a hit!  The sage really adds something special.  However, I have to agree with some of the other reviewers that the times were a bit off.  I think the stated times would work if you pan-seared the side of the steak flat before rolling... but the tradeoff there is that the steak shrinks a bit, and I don't necessarily think that is preferable.  So, I say all that to say that I left the rolls in the oven for 15-18 minutes, turning twice.  

And, although I'm sure that most of you experts will do this naturally, I felt lucky that someone suggested to me that I soak the toothpicks first so they did not burn.  I also used the 3-4 toothpicks, evenly spaced, in each roll so that I could easily cut them and put them on trays to serve.

Great recipe! I couldn't find skirt steak at our grocery store, so I also substituted top sirloin steak (thin sliced). Tasty, epecially with the crispy sauted fresh sage on top.

It was very good, however the steak itself did somewhat lack taste.  Next time I may try to marinate the steaks (not quite sure in what yet) before rolling them up.  The overall flavor was great though, very unique.  I will for sure make it again.  Also, the cooking time was a bit off.. we had ours in for over 15 minutes and it was still a bit rare.

I was first a little hesitant to make this dish because I thought 4 ingredients meant bland taste. But not so at all! I couldn't find prosciutto so I ended up using Canadian Bacon and it was amazing! The fresh sage adds so much depth of flavor to the dish. (And the fried leftover sage was a great garnish.) I used round steaks and pounded them to the appropriate thickness and they turned out great. Thanks so much for sharing this recipe!

Yummy! I used thinly sliced sirloin which I seasoned with Montreal Steak Seasoning before assembling. I baked mine for about 10 minutes and they were perfectly medium.

It is a very quick and easy recipe to make.  I made the mistake of not pounding the meet enough with the meet clever, but the meal was still great.  I had saut√©ed asparagus in butter and garlic as a side dish.  We had a Merlot to drink, and I think that they went good together.

This recipe is great!  It only took about 30-40 minutes total to make and was a big hit.  I substituted Top Sirloin for the steak.

This was perfect.  hubby gave it a 5.  He can't imagine anything better.  I used skirt steak, sprinkled it with onion powder and pepper after I pounded it(put in refrig for several hours).  I put one slice of proscuitto first, then one sage leaf and one piece of cheese, about one inch by 3, crumbled. Rolled up, used one toothpick.  Browned on all sides and then put in oven for 10 minutes.  Let rest 10 minutes.  Did not slice.  cooked  a bunch of sage in pan (used cast iron skillet) and pour everything on top of resting rolls

I have been making my version of this for several years.  I use swiss, fresh spinach and shaved VA ham from the deli.  I roll them up, sprinkle with McCormick's grill seasoning & then freeze till almost frozen and then slice thinly & pan fry the pinwheels till they are done and serve on top of prepared angle hair pasta and my most favorite side of roasted green beans.

A versatile recipe one can use pork or veal instead of beef if you can cut chicken breast very finely and very carefully roll out its also another variation.try with other cheeses.Italian Talleggio is superb when cooked.

Because I was preparing these for an event, I didn't brown them first, just baked them.  After a few tests, we all liked basil better than the sage, and I used cubed steak (pounded) instead of skirt - for easy portioning and cost.  I'm sure the recipe is great as is, just wanted everyone to know what changes also work.  We got rave reviews.

This had a very good flavor combination!  I read the reviews, and decided to add a little sauteed garlic to the insides of the steaks before rolling them with all the good stuff.  Make sure you get a nice sear on the outsides, and everything else will take care of itself.  For us, the cooking time was off as well...I'm not sure if it is my oven or not, but I love rare, and even 15 minutes was a little too rare...For the gf, I had to cook these 25 minutes to get a medium result.  Good eatin'!

I was surprised at how much I loved the fresh sage in this dish. It does mellow out when cooking. I could only find skirt steak and with it being so muscular I couldn't pound it into submission so I butterflied 1/2" thick strips and got the perfect size. It's amazing how much flavor the proscuitto gives every bite. It's one of those dishes that makes you look like a pro in the kitchen. Definitely comany-worthy.

Outstanding recipe!  I substituted top sirloin for the skirt steak, but otherwise followed the recipe exactly.  I think that this would be an easy recipe to modify to fit personal tastes.  Next time, I think I might add a few sauteed mushrooms to the stuffing.

I thought this was pretty awful, as did my wife. Just browning the outside of the rolls, the times are completely off as multiple people have mentioned (I use an actual oven thermometer, not the oven's built in one so I eliminated that possibility). I love beef, I enjoy skirt steak, this just didn't do it for me. My wife found the sage to be too overpowering, and I can see why. Everything is just competing for your palette, and there isn't any balance. I had higher hopes for the dish.

I was pressed for time so I took a couple of short cuts.  I didn't pound the skirt steak and I didn't make pinwheels.  I placed the prosciutto and provolone on one side of the steak and folded the bare side over to make a sandwich.  I browned them in the oil and then baked them in the oven for about 15 minutes.  I served the steak with a simple tomato sauce over pasta.  This was an easy and fast meal.

This was such an easy and fast dish to prepare. My husband looked for fresh sage leaves in the store but couldn't find any, so I used dried sage but went sparingly (sprinkled lightly) since I wasn't sure how much would be a good substitute. I should have been fairly generous though as these were a bit bland though. A good sprinkle of Season-All would help too. I used a cut of round steak that was super thin labeled "milanesa" on the package. This was a perfect cut for this recipe. Thanks Nikki, this made a nice dinner and seemed fancy but really wasn't.

Awesome!  I bought flank steak at Safeway and they put it through the tenderizer for me!  I also added 10 minutes to the cooking time (personal preference) and spinach for added nutrition.  I have never made anything so "gourmet".  Thanks for posting this great EASY recipe!

I needed slightly more than 8-10 minutes to cook. I like my food still mooing but my guests like theirs actually cooked. Still, this was a HUGE hit. Absolutely delicious, as were the leftovers. Which there were TONS of. I'm not quite sure how you reached 6 as a serving size for those ingredients but we had way more left over than was actually eaten. Also, the meal was very expensive to make. High class meat, expensive steak...worth it, but only for very special occasions!

I like to coat the beef with oregano, basil, onion powder and garlic powder on the inside and black pepper on the outside to give the meat more flavour. I served it with risotto and pan-fried asparagus at my last dinner party and everyone raved about how it tasted! Great tasting and looking and so easy to make!

very good, and so easy.  I didn't have sage leaves, so I just used dried sage.  Cooking time was a little tricky, we like med-rare, and cooked it about 10-12 min longer than stated on the recipe.

2nd time making it and it was great! i gave the sage a quick toss in some olive oil and crushed garlic before rolling it with comte cheese, because last time i made them i went on the rare side, and the leaves were a little to "sagie" for my taste.  served it with mashed celery root, and mushroom onion gravy.

This is a "gourmet" recipe!  Loved it.  The steaks turned out tender and the flavor was as promised.  I seared both sides of the steak before rolling and the cooking time worked for me, I like steak a little rare.  I did not use toothpicks, just rolled and put in the pan, but cooking string would also work with no fear of burning.   The taste is very distinctive, so it doesn't suprise me that some people don't care for it.  It would be a risk at a dinner party, but it's great for a restaurant quality meal at home.

My boyfriend liked this, so I'm going to try making this one more time, but I was disappointed with the first attempt.  Next time I'm going to use a different cut of meat, up the cooking time and track down fresh sage (my local grocer only had ground sage).

These were alright. I used some thin top round steaks that were probably 1/4" thick.  They were about 12" by 5" and I cut them in half to make 6" steaks (not sure what a 4oz. piece of meat looks like).  I marinated them in a london broil marinade that I got off this site.  This made them very flavorful.  I used canadian bacon instead of proscuitto (sp?), and ground sage instead of fresh.  I only had enuf Provolone for half, so used mozzerella for the other half.  My only gripe is that the cheese melted out of them, but that was probably my fault cuz I cooked them 17 min's in the oven after browning them.  They shrunk a LOT too.  I would recommend only cooking 10 or 12 min's.  They'll probably be a little pink, but mine were too done.  If you don't like rare to pink meat, I wouldn't make this.  All in all, it was just ok, too much work.  Don't think i'll be making them again.

Delicious!  The only problem was I didn't make enough.  Unfortunately I ouldn't find fresh sage or provolone, so I substituted for dried sage and swiss cheese.  My only  mistake was not cutting off the bit of fat on the edge of my beef.  I will be making this again on Sunday!

This recipe sounded easy to prepare, but actually takes more than it sounds.  All in all, I thought the steak was bland but then I had to substitute many ingredients so it could be my fault.  I used dried sage instead of fresh, and top sirloin instead of skirt.  However, the cheese didn't add any flavor what so ever, as well as the prosciutto.  I may try again, this time with some thinner cuts which cook faster- hence retain more flavor.

AWESOME!  My grocer's skirt steak looked a little iffy, so I just used top round and pounded it thin using a meat tenderizer.  As I am a south-Louisiana girl, I also added some seasoning to the steaks before searing.  Otherwise, this recipe is perfect just as it is.  Thanks!

My family loves this recipe, and I make it every time we have company over for dinner now.  The only change I made was to roll in some fresh spinach leaves.  I am making it right now for my in-laws, and tonight I am going to serve some sauteed mushrooms and salad on the side.  AWESOME!

This recipe turned out great. I read that some users had issues with the meat lacking  in flavor so I used a marsala marinade on the flank steak prior to cooking.

Very good recipe--my husband thought it was very tasty!  I thought the combination of flavors was really neat.  However I think next time I'll either choose a different type of meat or season the meat beforehand--the beef part didn't have as much flavor as I expected.  Also, I didn't pound the meat enough so it was a little difficult to roll.  Next time I'll really flatten that sucker : ).  I added a few extra minutes to the recipe and it came out medium rare, which is just how I like it.

I marinaded this using the Flank Steak Pinwheels recipe from this site for about 8 hours.  Ajusting the time is a must if you don't want really rare meat.   Lots of flavor going on!

This was fabulous!!! I cook ALOT and both I and hubby thought this was phenomenal! More than a keeper, this is very special fare...the reason we cook instead of eat out! You have to try this...I keep smelling the sage, etc on my hands, don't want to wash them :)! Honestly, do not skimp on fresh sage (we had some in garden, but would pay if necessary) or the cheese (we used fontina from deli section b/c I got confused w/ other recipe, but WOW!), we will always do this way...we were amazed at results and look forward to serving to friends...thank you so much, Nikki! Forever in your debt! Can't praise enough!

This recipe was very good. I made it for my husband on valentines day. The only thing was I had to cook it for a extra 10 minutes. It was too raw for our liking. I will make this again.

This is the same recipe that Michael Chiarello does on Food Network. Fantastic recipe. I didn't have sage so I just replaced it with basil which I love even more and it came out great.

This recipe was AWESOME!  I can't get skirt steak so I purchased Flank Steak and I don't care too much for sage so I used garlic powder, onion powder and pepper.  I will fix this dish.

So good and pretty easy too!  We used a only one slice of the proscuitto as some of the other reviewers recommended which was the perfect amount of salt.  Will be making again!

This dish was decent, though I don't think I will be making it again.  My boyfriend and I found it pretty salty.  We decided to call it "Salt-in-Boca" instead of Saltimbocca because that's what it was!  If I were to do it again I would definitely only use one slice of prociutto per roll.  The crispy sage leaves added a nice touch though!

OMG, yum!  I used the suggestion of adding basil, oregano, and garlic powder to the inside of the meat.  I also used havarti, just because I really like havarti.  Wow, this was good.  And I did cook it for about 20 minutes.  Definitely going in the rotation.

My provolone cheese all melted out while in the oven. Otherwise, this was an OK dish. My picky husband and 6 year old daughter both ate it up. Thanks for the recipe I am definately going to try it again and hopefully keep the provolone in this time. ***Second review: I really didn't like the sage flavor and can't find prosciutto. These were my changes that made it a 5 star meal. Fried 4 pieces of bacon in a skillet, sprinkled fresh chopped rosemary and fresh cracked pepper on the steak, added provolone then bacon. I left the steak whole and rolled it up and secured with toothpicks. Seared in the skillet with the bacon drippings, put it in the oven until done. This was so much better to me. The rosemary really complemented the taste of the steak, cheese and bacon much better than sage. Oh, and my provolone didn't melt out this time!!!

Everybody in the family liked this. Next time I make it though I will make each piece so that when wrapped up it only goes around once. Because my pieces ended up being wrapped up about 2 1/2 times. And so it took about half an hour in the oven. Also, I would use only one piece  of prociutto per serving because I thought it was just alittle too salty . I used mozzerella instead but I think any cheese would be good. I agree with other reviewers that it has a unique taste but a very good one!

This was very good!  I wasn't able to get skirt steak so I used some thin sliced top round and it was okay.  I know that skirt steak or flank steak are very flavorful meats and would be better suited for this.  Next time I will chop up the sage instead of using it whole.  I will cook this again!

Great meal for guests, though I was a bit embarassed when I had to put it back into the oven.  It said to cook it for 10minutes for medium, but it was more like 30-40 minutes.  Maybe my cut of meat was a differant thickness.

This was fantastic! Simple to prepare and amazing flavor - one of my new favorites. My fiance only had two complaints - he said it was a little underdone for his tastes, and there was a little too much sage. Now, I like my meat very rare, and sage is my favorite herb, so I of course thought it was perfect! Give this one a try!

The flavor was great -- we all really liked this dish.  It wasn't hard to make either.  Thanks for the recipe!

I left out the sage to make it more kid friendly. The flavor was still delicious. My only problem was getting the meat thin enough. My family loves skirt (flank) steak so I wanted to use that but next time I'd try what the others suggested and purchase a thinly sliced steak. That would also save a lot of time. I would try this again.

I add softened mushrooms and onions.  It was easy and came out awesome.   This is a definite keeper.

I use this recipe all the time for friends and my husband.  They love it but not the sage so I just use sage seasoning and put chopped spinach between the bacon and cheese.  It is always a hit and I get to sneak in vegetables with the kids.

I made this the other night.  I actually misread how much prosciutto to use and only used 1slice in each roll I made.  We liked it that way because it cut back on the super salty taste that too much prosciutto can leave.  I also needed to either cook it longer or pound it thinner.  It was still raw in the middle.  But overall, awesome AND easy!!

I wanted to make something different for my guests last night, and I wanted to be sure it paired nicely with my 2010 Daou Vineyards' Zin. So, I went searching on AllRecipes for something beef. I found this recipe and, with my Italian background, thought it sounded pretty good. So, I bought some beef shoulder (already pretty thin, but I pounded it a bit anyway) and decided to MARINATE it overnight. I was a little leery about this step since I hadn't even tried the original recipe yet before mixing it up, but something told me to do it anyway. I cooked everything according to Nikki's recipe, only I didn't have sage on hand, so I omitted that.

The results: My guests LOVED it and even went back for seconds! Thanks for this simple yet great recipe, Nikki! :)

(Elaine's marinade: balsamic vinegar, dried oregano, minced garlic, a dash of honey, a dash of olive oil, and salt and black pepper to taste. Marinade overnight.)

Hard to get a great cut of steak these days however, my husband gave it a 10.  I would rate it a 7.  I used basil out of my herb garden b/c I couldn't find sage in the store, great flavor.  Had salad and garlic lemon aspargus as well.

These tasted really good, even though I'm not a huge fan of sage.  I pounded the meat very thin, and it came out a little overdone.  Next time I will leave the meat a bit thicker or cook it for less time.

This was wonderful!  It truly only took 30 minutes from pounding the steaks out to pulling them out of the oven!  I used venison steaks, and could not find fresh sage leaves, so used rubbed sage instead, and beat it into the meat.  My husband loved it!  We will definitely make this again.

Very good recipe. The only thing I did different was add a little garlic powder when seasoning.  Will fix again...

This was so tasty.  Unfortunately I overcooked it a bit and will watch it more closely next time.  The combination of flavors really works.  Although I had my doubts about the fresh sage...I thought it was going to be too strong - but it was delicious.  I scrimped a bit on the prosciutto and I shouldn't have, be sure to use the full amount.

We made this for our gourmet club.  It was excellent.  Simple to make but with a lot of taste.  We did not stray from the recipe at all, and it came out perfect!

I wasn't crazy about this dish.  It needed more flavor, plus I didn't care for the sage..too strong!  I will try it again, but with a different grouping of spices and less proscuitto.  Thanks for the idea, though!

Great recipe certainly looks more impressive than the effort to cook it. I replaced the fresh sage with italian seasoning and it was delicious. Highly recommended.

Sorry to say that this recipe didn't do much for me.  Love prosciutto, love cheese, love meat.  But this recipe was just boring.  It was definitely missing something.  No pizazz, not something I'll make again.
