Pretty good. Next time I won't use my kitchenaid to mix - you could no longer see the little bits of cheddar suspended in cream cheese. Perhaps a bit of lemon juice or something tangy and a pinch of sugar would round out the flavors? Loved the chives, and would consider adding other herbs next time. Thanks for the recipe.

I just made this and it is very good. I would recommend using a high quality cheddar cheese.

I used mild cheddar cheese and this was pretty tasty. I am just not a Tabasco girl so the smell was a little off-putting. I'm sure it makes a ton if you follow the full recipe. I cut it down to two servings just to give it a try!
