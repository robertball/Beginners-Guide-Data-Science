Thank you so much for sharing this recipe. I had cleaned out my pantry today and found several large cans of peaches.  I seldom use canned peaches, but I wanted to use at least a can of them, so I turned to allrecipes.com to find a recipe for something quick and simple I could take to church tonight to share.  I knew I didn't have the time to make crust, and I needed to use ingredients I had on hand.  I have tasted other "cobblers" made with similar type toppings (not crust per se) and have usually found them just "okay."  I followed the recipe as written (exception -- only had reduced-fat Bisquick), baked it in a glass dish (still at 350), and for 50 minutes.  It turned out really well, and it was a genuine hit at church.  I found it very good -- not quite as good as a "real" cobbler with fresh peaches and home-made crust, but a very close second.  Taste alone might have earned it four stars, but the  ease of preparation earned it that fifth star.  (One note -- I was afraid I had done something wrong when the batter turned out quite thin -- but it worked really well.)  The dessert was also nice and golden brown and attractive to serve.  Thanks again!

This was a pretty good cobbler though not as good as my mom's. Make sure to drain most of the syrup from the caned peaches or you'll end up with too much liquid and not enough peaches. Next time I try this recipe, I will use an extra can of peaches and only half the syrup from one of the cans.

Pretty good, however mine was very runny/syrup-y.  I think next time I will bake it a little longer and put maybe only 1/2 of the syrup that the peaches came in. Also I used peaches in heavy syrup and used only half of the sugar instead of the 2/3 cup of sugar. Also I used regular milk instead of buttermilk and the crust portion turned out fine!  Overall pretty good. like I said it was a little runny, but good!

this is easy to do with any flavor of canned pie filling.  just jazz up the filling a bit (use 2 cans 14.5 oz) and make the bisquik mix and pour over.  i put a little cinnamon sugar and nutmeg on the top of the batter.  bake and serve with whipped cream or ice cream.  i have served this at several catering events, every one loves it.  and it is soooo easy!

Very good and very easy.  Next time I will drain half of the syrup off.  I also added a little cinnamon to the cobbler.

Way too much liquid in the recipe. The topping was good and quick to make but the juice from the canned fruit made the cobbler a sogggy mess. If I were to make this again, I would drain off most of the juice, and maybe increase the fruit so that the cobbler is sitting higher up off the juice. A dash of cinnamon is good too.

This is the best peach cobbler I have ever eaten.  It is so easy and very tasty.  I didn't have the big can of peaches, so I used 2 regular cans with 100% juice instead of the light syrup and it turned out really good.  It tastes the best when warmed.

I absolutely loved this cobbler! It was so good, especially the crust. I'm making it for my grandma's birthday party! But I'm draining half of the syrup, and putting a small can of peaches in it, and drain most of that. Well I got to go buy some things to make this delicious cobbler! Thanks so much!!!

Ok, a few changes were needed. There was too much syrup so I drained the syrup into a bowl, mixed in a teaspoon of cornstarch and a teaspoon of cinnamon and half a teaspoon of cloves as well as the sugar. I added it back to the peaches in the baking dish, making sure to stir them well. Then to the topping, I added 1/2 cup uncooked oatmeal, 1/2 cup chopped pecans,a half teaspoon of cinnamon and a tablespoon of brown sugar. I also used non-fat milk as I didn't have any buttermilk on hand. Bake as directed, adjusting cooking time for the type of pan used (glass dishes need more cooking time).

This is a really nice and quick dessert.  I doubled the amount of peaches and used only half the syrup, as suggested by other reviewers.  I also added a little macefor flavour.  My very picky husband would have licked out the dish if it wasn't for shame's sake.

I used home canned peaches, very little of their syrup, and cut back some on the sugar.  Sprinkled cinnamon and nutmeg on crust.  Tasted like peach pie.

Delicious, only four stars because it has no redeeming nutritional value.  But it's dessert, so maybe that's not fair :)

I made it just as written, except I had a can of peaches in heavy syrup, so I omitted the sugar.

This recipe was about a 1 or a 2 until I made some changes, then it was a 5!  So I split the difference and gave it a 3.  The crust part was fine, but the fruit part was really soupy.  The second time I made this, I drained most of the juice, omitted the butter, and added 1/4 cup of baking mix along with the sugar to the fruit.  I also baked it another 15 minutes or so because the first time it didn't get done in the middle.

I took others' recommendations and made some mistakes but it still came out great!  I used 2 29 oz cans of peach halves (they were in heavy syrup) and drained them.  I used 4 T butter and used non-fat milk.  I forgot to blend the milk with the Bisquick mixture and had to blend it together in the 9x13 (with the peaches and all).  It still came out fabulously!  I wish it had a little crunchier texture and a little more taste, but it's quick and easy...and tastes good!

tastes very good. we didn't have canned peaches; used fresh after macerating w/ sugar for juice. lined the bottom of dish w/ the peaches plus a little water so had plenty. if you like a spongy cake-like top this recipe is quick and easy.

4 stars b/c it definitely would have been too sweet for my taste if I hadn't changed the amount according to suggestions from previous reviewers.  
*used 1/3 cup white sugar
*used peaches in heavy syrup w/ 1/2 cup syrup mixed in instead of all of it

the one time I didn't read the reviews before I made something... I would have drained alot of the peach juice, it needed more brown sugar, some cinnamon, and maybe something else, I'm not a very experienced cook so I don't know what... I was sad that I didn't like it more, my husband didn't think it was too bad though!

This was just ok for us. Too much batter and not enough peaches for one and the taste of the dough just wasn't to our liking.

Very easy to make and good to eat. I used 3 15 oz. cans of peaches & drained most of the syrup out and  I thought it turned out good. I will probably make it again sometime.

Easy & delicious!  I only used 1/2 the juice from the peaches, but followed the rest of the recipe as written.
