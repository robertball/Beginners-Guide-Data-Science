Essanaye's Pizza Sauce Haiku: "Better than a jar. And not difficult to make. Still, needs something else." Sauce is never the thing on a pizza that makes my stomach sing; sauce is like crust lube to me - the equivalent of mayo or mustard to a sandwich. Still, I was making pizzas a couple nights ago and wanted to try a new sauce recipe out, so I gave this one a go, and followed it exactly, except halving it, which incidentally, just covered a single large pizza. I was perplexed at not first sauteeing the garlic (or, should I make it again, diced onions and bell peppers too) in olive oil first, rather than just dumping everything into a collective simmer. I also found it unusual to add all of those dried spices, along w/ Italian Seasoning, which, for the most part, is made up of said spices, but again, I followed the recipe to the letter. Gave it a lick after 30 min. and added (as the author suggested) a bit more brown sugar, along w/ some finely-chopped fresh rosemary. I left half my pizza plain cheese so I could get a taste for the sauce in its completed pizza glory, and the other half (*drool*), I piled w/ grilled chicken, spinach, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, carmelized onions, and leftover hunks of "Pinwheel Meatloaf" (AR) and, well, for me, pizza's all about the toppings; however, this sauce WAS a nice change from store-bought sauce, and I'd make it again w/ my proposed modifications.

I'm a pizza snob. Normally I go so far as to order my favorite brand of sauce from the Internet because the stores around here don't have it. 

I was fresh out of that sauce and decided to try making my own, using this recipe here. It was GREAT.

My changes were to add a tsp of honey, 2 tsp crushed fennel seeds, and to saute the garlic (and a little bit of the crushed red pepper) in the oil for a minute or two before adding the rest of the ingredients. 

Thank you so much for this recipe because it will save me hundreds in shipping costs alone :)

I cut this down to make enough sauce for 2 pizzas.  I actually made this a few days ago and had it sitting in the fridge to meld the flavors.  Paired this great sauce with the quick and easy pizza crust and the potato crust pizza both from this site.  I'm going to be making a large batch of this and canning it.

Wow!  This was delicious.  It is zesty and flavorful without overpowering the rest of the pizza.  Plus, it was very easy to make.  This will be our stand-by pizza sauce recipe.

I made pizza for our church youth group for super bowl party. This sauce was really good.  The only thing I changed was to add 2 teaspoons dried minced onion. Two important things.  Make sure you allow the sauce to set overnight and don't use too much, about 3/4 cup for a 12 inch pizza is enough. When 14 year old boys say thanks for the awesome pizza you know you have a great recipe.

finally! Even my husband liked it. The kids loved it. I actually had just used my last bit of tomato paste so I went to this recipe. So glad I did! I let the flavors marinate together for about a week, so I had it ready to go when I got around to making the dough. YUM!

This sauce was awesome!  I might try using fresh herbs next time just to see how it turns out.  But, even with the dried herbs (and some of mine are kinda old) it was an awesome sauce!  Definitely recommend!

Mmmm delicious! Tomatoey, full of herby goodness. This had just a little heat with the pepper but it wasn't too spicy. This was a rich sauce and is great for a plain pasta when you want a simple spaghetti dish or breadstick sauce. It is very rich in flavor though so it can easily take over as a dominant flavor though so it won't just go with everything. Great though overall. I simmered this on the stovetop for about an hour and served it with toasted ravioli as a dipping sauce.

I made this sauce and used it with in an hour.  It was great!  Half is in the fridge so I'm looking forward to it melding.  The slightest touch of fennel would be awsome!

I have  spent years looking for what I consider to be the perfect pizza sauce recipe. I have finally found it in this one. I make homemade pizza probably at least twice a week if not three times a week. Yes, my waistline is paying for it. This sauce has everything that I look for in a sauce: taste, texture and simple complexity if that makes sense. I absolutely recommend the sauce to anybody looking for something that can be made with ingredients you already have on hand yet tastes like a million!

I am new to cooking from scratch.  Have to say this is the best pizza sauce I have ever eaten.  I did use 2 tablespoons of brown sugar as some one else suggested.

Loved this recipe! doesn't make as much as said, I had enough to make one large pizza, a hot pizza dip, and have a dip for Cheeto covered mozzarella sticks.. I did make a fee changes, I added 2 Bay leafs, 1 tbls of honey and three table spoons of Sugar in the raw (instead of brown sugar), 2tsps of fennel seed, 1 extra tsp of Italian seasoning. I cut use of the red pepper, extra basil, and extra oregano. Turned out perfectly!! loved it!!

I made this recipe with a few modifications:  Used fresh beefsteak tomatoes (halved, drizzle with olive oil, season with salt/pepper) that I grilled along with the toppings I used.  I also used fresh herbs at the rate of 1t dry = 1T fresh and added about 2tsp fennel seeds.  I also used 2-3T brown sugar for a sweeter sauce.  Using the beefsteak tomatoes meant I had a lot of liquid, but, cooked it down to the consistency I was after.  Oh, and I skipped the Italian seasoning, it seemed redundant.  It was really good, I'll definitely make it again.

I wasn't a big fan of all the seasoning in this sauce.  I'd probably either 1/2 or 1/4 the added spices.  I personally like my pizza sauce on the mellow side so the tomato shines, but I figured I'd give it a shot.

I quadrupled this recipe and then froze it in 1/2 cup portions in small bags. Perfect, I now have sauce in my freezer that I can pull and make a quick pizza or use it for an appetizer dip (thaw the bad in very warm water). Best one I have tried...not bothering with any others. I couldn't help myself, I had to saute the garlic and peppers in the oil for 2 minutes before I added the rest of the ingredients. Maybe next I will try the fennel seed like others suggested.

I was looking for a good pizza sauce recipe & tried this one along with 2 others... The first two I tried tasted pretty good, but this one did not until the next day... It blew the other recipes out of the water!! It's now THE recipe I use. Thank you :)
