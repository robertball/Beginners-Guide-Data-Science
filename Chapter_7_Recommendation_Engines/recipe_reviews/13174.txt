I don't know what some of the reviewers did to make their recipes no good, because mine was delicious!! It was amazing! My whole family thought so.

Made some changes...Used 3 - 4 large red potatoes, either 2 qts of vegetable broth or 1 qt water & 1 qt veg. broth, use evaporated milk, and lots of fresh cracked pepper...We like it a little chunky so didn't blend smooth, and addded some fresh grated parmesean cheese right before serving, along with the chives...Can also add some fresh mushrooms for added flavor

LOVED IT! But I added more potatoes and instead of the heavy cream, I used sour cream. REALLY good. My husband's having me add it to my list of things-he-loves-me-to-make.

if you want to make the soup to a thicker consitentcy you can add a little bit of slurry wich is cornstarch and water or you can use a little bit of roux which is butter cooked into flour.

We loved this recipe.  I substituted low-fat half-and-half for the cream, and it didn't make any difference.

What a wonderful recipe!  It's easy to make and great to eat!  My husband and I made this together and it couldn't have been better!  Definitely restaurant quality!

The only changes we made were these...We added one more red potato (just to give it a little bit more potato flavor) And we only used 1 leek.  (Using only the green, and a little bit of the white, but not much)

This is definitely going to be recipe used regularly around our household!  Thank you so much Corwynn!

We love this soup. It was very easy to make. The next time I make this I might halve the amount of cream as we thought it was a bit rich. The flavour was great and very filling. Thanks for a great recipe.

1 tablespoon of salt is way too much.  I doubled the recipe and only used 11/2 teaspoons of salt.  It was very good. I didn't have leeks so I used 2 onlions.

This soup was awesome...like someone else mentioned I'm not sure what happened to others who attempted this one but it was great for me..I left out the leeks because I didn't have any and threw in a chunk of smoked sausage...I definitely didn't make enough myself, my husband and my 2 yr old devoured all of this.:)  Thanks for the recipe! (Potato Soup is one of my favorite soups)

Fantastic recipe.  I used olive oil and added a couple ground up turkey Italian sausages to the pot which added a nice bit of meaty flavor.

Very good.  I added a pepper, garlic salt and butter instead of margarine.  I didn't blend it either.

I just used butter, substituted 1/2 and 1/2 for the heavy whipping cream, and used scallions instead of leeks.  This was a very yummy dish (I did mix the second batch of butter with a few tablespoons of flower over heat first).  My kids devoured this meal.  Very tasty!!

This was very good but did have a couple of minor changes. I added a bag of frozen corn and used fat free 1/2 & 1/2. I also thickened it a little. Now if you want to thicken potato soup up some use instant potato flakes. Sort of a no brainer if you think about it.

It is very good. I made it with red (3 small) and one sweet potato. I also used milk instead of cream and added a bit of grated parmesan at the end. Lovely colour and combination of flavours.

Fantastic flavor.  I was concerned about the consistency (I was looking for something more like chowder) so I went with six medium sized red potatoes. It was still a little thin so before adding the cream I put it back up to boil... That was a mistake. I left for a few minutes and I had potato soup splattering all over my stove!  I actually ended up adding two cups of water to thin it out.  I'm going to have to play with it to get the consistency I want but overall a great recipe.  I did toss a clove of garlic in with the onions and I also added half a dozen strips of diced up, cooked bacon with the cream.  This will definitely be made again.  Thanks for sharing.

I configured this recipe for 12, made my "batch" of it before noon and served it (with fruit, bread and a green salad) as a quick dinner for my family of 4 (husband and late teens) and they absolutely DEVOURED it (I'm not sure how younger kids would respond). An anecdote: I had a 7:30 community meeting I had to attend, and when I returned around 10:00, what I assumed would be my next day luncheon leftovers were GONE! :) 

This is a GREAT soup that seems to be well suited to all seasons. The flavors blended beautifully (I credit that to the few hours I allowed between preparation and serving). 

I dropped in 3 chicken boullion cubes (because that's how I know I'm making soup) and I garnished it with sliced scallion tops rather  than chives (just a summertime preference). 

We're really big cheese people, so I think next time I make it, I'll adjust my liquids a bit so that I can melt some Velveeta into it. I'm also thinking that PepperJack or a few shakes of Cayenne Pepper may be just the additives that will get my kids to come home for dinner more often. 

Enjoy. :)

This recipe is fantastic. To cut on the calories, I substituted the cream for 2% milk and put less butter. I felt it needed a bit of flavor so I added some sage.

This came out great! I modified the recipe a bit, but this was an excellent base. Only 1/4 cup of butter and1/4 cup heavy cream, 2 quarts homemade veggie stock instead of water. 5 small yellow potatoes, 1 cup fresh corn, garlic, and I chopped up some giant scallions (1 cup) instead of leeks. It came out like a potato corn chowder!

Why use margarine in ANYTHING? Potato soup is rich & creamy because of butter! Margarine tastes terrible and is made of unhealthy oils. If you want to cut out a little fat, use whole milk, half & half, part evaporated milk, a little yogurt or sour cream, etc. in place of heavy whipping cream. You'll still get the creaminess, and much better flavor. And they must have used 2 REALLY GIANT RED POTATOES. No indication of size in this recipe. I found instructions in many recipes on this site lacking.
