It came out alright the first time, but for some reason (the recipe's fault) they didn't come out properly the second time after I added grated corn husk and watermelon instead of flour. The texture is exactly the same when fired in a kiln, and they should have risen instead of burned. Otherwise they smelled wonderful.

OK, I made a few changes to make them healthier for my picky 12 year old...I used mostly whole wheat flour, I added 1/4 cup of flax seed, used apple sauce in place of the oil, and chopped 1/2 cup of pecans up very small and added it into the batter.  These were delicious!  I only made 1/2 to the batter to try it because Chef John said he got 20 when he made them, and still got 11 nice sized muffins.  They came out of the oven about an hour and a 1/2 ago and already 5 are gone!  My picky eater approved!  So 2nd batch later on this week! Thanks for another great recipe Chef John!! :)

To make this gluten free friendly, I used Bob’s 1-1 flour. Also, I replaced the oil with applesauce, and added 1/4 cup of a flax/chia blend. They were absolutely delicious! I shared them with co-workers who absolutely loved them.  I will make these again, but with less sugar.

Stuck with the recipe, just added some allspice. Fantastic results - people voted with their mouths, the muffins disappeared quickly. Not satisfied to wait for leftover sweet potatoes, went out and got some just to make another batch of muffins. Slow baking the sweet potatoes (overnight in a 200 degree oven) seems to bring out more of the sugar and flavor.

Replaced the flour with Red Mills 1-1 gluten free flour. The muffins are oustanding, so light and full of flavor. A new favorite will be an easy staple this time of year.

Oh, wow! These were simply delicious: Moist, crunchy and just slightly sweet, the subtle flavors blended beautifully. Within hours of making 24 of them, they were gone. I shared them with friends, family and colleagues who seem to enjoy them.  Too bad I can't remember what type of sweet potato I used. All I remember is that they were on the smallish side, and the flesh was a light yellow. Once cooked, the skin was a medium purple color. Next time, I'll have to pay attention to what I'm purchasin

Did like some other reviewers mentioned and used home made applesauce (made in Vitamix) instead of the oil. I also used only 2 cups of brown sugar ( no white sugar at all)which is plenty sweet enough. Definitely no need to sprinkle with extra sugar. The freshly grated ginger as one reviewer pointed out is a plus.

These are great.  I thought of them as sweet potato cupcakes - dessert, not breakfast.  I topped them with cream cheese frosting, since my grandkids won't eat nuts.  At least I'm sneaking some sweet potatoes into them.  Very easy to make.  I made mini-cupcakes and full-sized ones.  Thank you Chef John.

I initially made only a half recipe and they were yummy. I added chocolate chips to the second batch that I made. A great way to use your leftover yams

I did make changes that another reviewer suggested.  I used applesauce in place of oil and reduced the amount of sugar.  It turned out great.  I will make it again.  Very moist and delicious.

OMG they were awesome no-one in my family liked sweet potatoes until I made those by surprise and now we all love to eat them made like that and asking when I'm gonna make them again. Thanks a bunch for the recipe next time I'll take pics.

These are  good muffins. I altered the recipe- used whole wheat flour, fresh grated ginger, substituted applesauce for oil. The muffins turned out perfectly flavored and moist. I made a tin of mini muffins for the kids and topped each muffin with 3 dark chocolate chips. My 4 year old son was my assistant. Throughout baking he would get really excited and yell "I want to eat these muffins!" Before bedtime he exclaimed that he had so much fun baking and even more fun eating. I will make these again for family, friends and coworkers.

My wife and I gave up sweets for lent so I used stevia for the white sugar and a little allspice instead of brown sugar. Like other reviews I used applesauce instead of oil. It was AMAZING!

I made these with a bag full of sweet potatoes that were about to turn. I omitted the nuts and sugar topping. Also instead of cooking spray, I coated the bottom of the muffin tins with butter then flour so they would come out easier.  They came out great!

I followed the recipe, but I added blueberries instead of pecans.  These muffins are so light, fluffy, and perfectly spiced.  I highly recommend adding tart fruit (blueberries, cranberries, raspberries), the contrast to the sweet, spiced muffin makes it even more delicious.

I made this recipe the day after Thanksgiving. It was an excellent use for my leftover sweet potato. The only changes I made was I used 1cup of coconut oil in place of vegetable oil, I cut the white sugar down to 1 cup, and I omitted the pecans. The muffins turned out moist and delicious. I highly recommend this recipe.

Nice recipe.  I made half and it made 12 muffins.  The only thing I changed was I used applesauce in place of oil,  just slightly less white sugar and whole wheat flour as that's what I had.  I would make again but would increase the spice amounts.

EXCELLENT way to use left-over sweet potatoes!  I had only 1 cup of sweet potatoes, so I made half the recipe, exactly as Chef John did.  They were DELICIOUS.   I got 12 muffins,  just right for us.  Next time, I'll make a half-batch again.  Quite tasty with soup and for breakfast the next day

Very good recipe.  I had 2 baked sweet potatoes in the fridge so I made half the recipe and was quite pleased. Instead of mashing the cold potatoes I used an immersion blender once all the wet ingredients were in the bowl. I will be making again!

I made these for a baby shower...followed Chef John's video instructions to a tee (including filling the muffin cups to the top.)  They were delicious and a big hit at the shower.

This is a very light, tender and incredibly flavourful muffin. I cut the oil down to 2/3 c. and had to bake them a bit longer but they were delicious.

Great flavor but there is no need for the amount of sugar and fat. Iwill make these muffins again with the changes I made to make it healthier. I basically followed another reviewer’s suggestions.
I added 1/4 c Bob’s Red Mill Flaxseed meal, substituted 1 cup whole wheat flour for 1 cup white flour, reduced the salt, reduced the white sugar to 1 cup and substituted 1/2 cup applesauce for 1/2 the oil. I also used only 1/2 cup pecans. My husband loved them and I’m sure they will disappear quickly at coffee hour after church.

This was a huge hit with my daughter.  The first thing she said was this is definitely five stars. and asked for the recipe.  I have to agree.  They were delicious.

I simmered the yam in fresh squeezed orange juice (pulp and all).  I added cloves,  and vanilla.  I think the muffins came out very good.

Moist and delicious. I did swap the oil for applesauce but, I think it might have made it too sweet. I'll try oil next time.

I think these are the BEST sweet potato muffins I've ever made!!  I made regular sized and mini muffins!  Family loves them.  I did decrease the white sugar and added vanilla to mine.

I used a 29 oz can of yams (drained and smashed) because that’s what I had. I only did 1 c of white sugar and 1/2 c brown sugar and thought it was sweet enough. I felt they were a little oily feeling so next time I will try with 1/2 c applesauce and 1/2 c veggie oil. I made these into mini muffins for my Little’s and they really enjoy them (bake 15-17 min). I’m going to freeze half of them (it made 62 mini’s) to enjoy later. Overall I thought it was a good recipe as is.

I made this as is minus the pecans because I didn't have any. These were perfect. Make sure to spray the muffin cup liners. Forget the substitutions as you will not get the same results.

These are excellent muffins! It makes a dozen large muffins. Would probably be tasty with some added raisins.

Cut the sugar down to 1/4 0f the amount suggested and added more spice ie cinammon, nutmeg and allspice; as well added a little lemon juice, it was delicious.

Made some changes to be a little healthier. Cut oil down to 3/4 cup, 3/4 cup white sugar and added 1 ripe banana. Used yams and added dried craisins. Delish!
