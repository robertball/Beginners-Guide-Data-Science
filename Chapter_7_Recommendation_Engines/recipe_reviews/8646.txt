I havent made this recipe yet but i think it sounds terrific! there should be more like this. I love dishes that can be made into many servings and made on a low budget. Sounds like a great dish to throw together! thanks! I will let you know how my family makes it when i get around to cooking it.

My husband loved this dish although I did a variation on it.  I added a can of cream of chicken soup to enhance the chicken flavor and used chicken breasts instead of a whole chicken since we like white meat only.

This dish was lacking alot of flavor. My family did not like it at all.
