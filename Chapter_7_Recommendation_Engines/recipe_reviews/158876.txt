A wonderful vegetarian main-course salad and a great cross-over dish for meat eaters.  I scaled it to one and the only thing I changed was using more oil to brown the tempeh.  I will definately make this again.

This is an excellent recipe.  Great way to use the tempeh.  The only thing I would change next time is to add less beans and onion and add more lettuce.  Everything else exactly the same!  Will definitely make this again.

This was a great salad!  Even my meat-eating husband enjoyed it and said I should make it again!  Next time I will cut back on the garbanzo beans, as I thought there was too much and I will add more lettuce for I was left with a lot of filling when I was finished.  Otherwise a great recipe!
