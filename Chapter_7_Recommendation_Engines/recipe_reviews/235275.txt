A very nice baguette recipe.  The dough was much looser (wetter) than I remember from culinary school, but it turned out great.  I doubled the yeast to half a teaspoon and got a nice rise in about 7 hours - still plenty of time to develop great flavor. I like the kind of baguette you almost break your teeth on with a thick hard crust - this recipe won't give you that but it's the best you'll get from a home oven.  Still a crisp and satisfying crust.  Don't trust any recipe with an egg wash if you want that crisp crust!
Helpful Tip:  If you don't have a silpat silicone sheet you can do what I did and nest one sheet pan inside another equal sized pan, and this will insulate against over-browning (aka burning) on the bottom of the loaf.  Parchment paper is always your friend.  Otherwise an excellent recipe from Chef John.  Don't forget your imported french butter!

Very easy and very tasty. Almost full proof. I used Bread Flour instead of all purpose flour and I think got better results.

I made this no-knead bread this weekend and it was delicious.  My husband and I ate all four loaves in two days.  I froze 2 loaves and let them thaw on the counter and then stuck them in a 350F oven for 5 minutes and they were just as good as the fresh baked ones.  The crust was crunchy and the inside was soft and full of holes for the butter to sink in.  This is now my go-to recipe for baguettes.  

I was worried about the texture (sticky), but it came together beautifully!  So easy and so good.  I started the bread the night before and we had fresh bread for lunch and dinner. FYI, I did use unbleached flour, and I put a cast iron skillet on the bottom rack of the oven and threw a glass of water in the skillet right before putting my bread in the oven (more steam)those were the only changes.

Excellent recipe!  

I have made this dozens of times and find it to be an excellent no-kneed French Bread recipe.  I typically make the dough into three small baguettes, but I've also used this method to make bread bowls and "Boule" loaves.  

Three quick tips: 

1.  Use about 1/2 tsp. of yeast, rather than 1/4 tsp.  I have found this is the best amount for me.

2.  I have found this works best if you can let this rest for at least 14 hours.  I really think this delivers the best result.

3.  PUT SOMETHING NON-STICK ON YOUR PAN.  I can't emphasize this enough.  You will need an uncoated steel or aluminum baking sheet, and it is absolutely critical that you cover it with a silicon mat, parchment paper, or non-stick foil.  If you don't, you will NOT be able to get the loaves off without tearing them apart.  You have been warned...

Excellent recipe and techniques. If making for bruschetta, I suggest rolling into logs about 3/4 of an inch thick and reduce cooking time by 2-3 minutes still allowing for 3 mistings. I also tried one loaf adding in some fresh roasted garlic and it was amazing.

My first attempt I must not have let the dough rise sufficiently because my bread was a bit too moist and underdone even though the crust browned perfectly.  My second attempt was much better. I let it rise for almost 14 hours and made one loaf.  It looks great and the bite I sliced off the end had good texture and taste.

This is an excellent recipe. Some reviewer said it turned out too dry at 4 cups. There's a chef's note that mentions the measurements in weight. If you're not going to use the weight, then you can't just assume 4 cups will be exactly right.

I didn't have a scale, so I started off with 3 cups, then gradually added a little at a time until the dough has the same consistency as what the video showed (very sticky, but still pulls away from the sides of a metal bowl). I ended up using a little under 3.5 cups.

The yeast can play a role in how much it rises. Since I only had active dry yeast at home, I had to proof the yeast. Since it was also a few years old, I  used a lot more of it.  I used 1 teaspoon of the old, active dry yeast. Then I added 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and allowed it to proof (i.e. once I see the yeast start to foam up, it's ready). Then I added the salt and flour.

Note: The dough didn't hold its shape much when I rolled it into a log and let it rise for the 1-1.5 hours. It was flatter than the video. But after baking it, the dough rose and formed a nice baguette shape. It turned out great and very tasty!

In the video chef John says to weigh ingredients but gives no amounts. In the actual recipe the amounts are given but the flour quantity is incorrect . It was way too dry before it got to 4 cups. It should only read 3 cups. Otherwise they tasted great!

Great recipe! Delicious bread and really simple to make. Another reviewer suggested using wax paper when you bake - do not do this. The paper baked on to the bottom of the bread and was impossible to get off. The second time that I made it, I baked them on a corn meal-dusted baking sheet. They turned out just fine! I will definitely use this recipe every time I make baguettes.

I decided to properly join the All Recipes community so I can tell Chef John how much I love his recipe. Making bread seems so daunting but this was easy and delicious. A pan of steaming water in the oven and spritzing the bread twice makes a huge difference, especially if your living in a fairly cook and dry area.

This was not only my first baguette, but my first yeast bread ever. I can't believe I actually made baguette! It was amazing, and so easy, I had no idea. My crust didn't get very crusty though. My oven only goes to 500, and not 550 or higher, maybe that was why. I left it in for an extra 5 minutes to get the crust "crustier", but didn't happen. Other than that, it was excellent! I will be making these again!

Boy this was a lot of work but well worth it when it was done!! I added a teaspoon of sugar (I was trying to replicate Panera's). And added an additional 5 minutes on the cook time. They turned out perfect.

Easiest and best tasting bread I've ever made! Used bread flour instead of all purpose flour. Plus used same flour instead of corn meal. Took about 17 minutes at 550 but that was no big deal. The 4 loaves - 2 at time - came out perfect!

I was tired of spending money on store bought baggettes, so I found this recipe and I love it!  I make them every three weeks, store them in the freezer because I live in a very isolated area. I will say, if you make a sandwich while they are warm, it reminds me of Paris! Thanks for the great recipe.

This was my first time baking bread. I have to say I have tasted homemade bread from other people and they were bad, really bad. So, I was very afraid to try this out. But this recipe is very good, it's amazing!! Thank you Chef John! I will be baking my banguettes from now on.

After living in Paris, I was longing  to find a recipe that was as close to the taste of the baguettes I had while living there. I’ve been on the hunt for a good French baguette recipe and this one is definitely my “winner”! Amazing! Easy recipes to follow. Yes it takes over night prep, but it’s worth every second. Have passed this one along to others and have gotten the same reviews!

I followed this exactly as shown in the video. I've never made bread before and it came out PERFECT and so delicious!! I made my own cheese and added garden basil and chives then topped it with roasted beets. Bread is a splurge for me so I wanted to make a special bread for all of my homegrown ingredients - and it was. Thank you Chef John! Yet again you've knocked out an amazing recipe and your videos always make me giggle!! Keep em coming

Turned out pretty good, but a few things I dealt with... My oven only goes to 525ºF, not 550ºF like in his video. Also, the recipe doesn't show weights like he mentions in the video. You can find them on the foodwishes.com website.  I'll definitely try again, as it tastes wonderful, but I'm trying to match a certain bakery that probably has a high end commercial oven.

Before I found this receipe. I have never had a success making a real baguette with oven rise that expands the razor stashes nicely.

To make it better in my case.
I added 1 Tbl Spoon of sugar. Can't really taste it, but it help with the yeast proofing.

I also "pulled and fold" the dough after the first 3 hours to activate the gluten.

Cutting with double-edge razor instead of scissors helps the look of it too.

Great flavour and texture. I left the dough  rise for the full 14 hours and didn't make any changes other than cooking it for 20 mins at 450º.

Love it; I need to do another batch to get it to perfection- but the breas tastes great. Is there a way to store some dough to bale it later on, can I simply keep it in the fridge for couple of or few days?

Crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside. I'll save a 5 star rating for the baguettes you get in France - but this was good, easy, and worth making again. (For the record, I make bread about once a year.)

I let the dough rise for 15 hours and then the second rise was about 2 hours.

I didn't follow the recipe in full because I part baked the baguettes (150ºC for 20 mins) and then finished them off at 200ºC for 20 mins when I wanted to use them.  Being plain flour (9.4% protein) I could have part baked for a bit longer to make sure the bread set a bit better.  When I thaw out and finish off the next one I will do it at a higher temperature (perhaps for less time).  I have found when you part bake bread it is best to thaw it out before finishing it off because you get more oven spring that way.

It came out OK but I prefer fully kneaded dough using strong bread flour (around 13.4% protein).  Having said that, thanks Chef John for an interesting recipe.

=== Edit ===
The part-baked baguette came out much better when finished off at 230ºC for 20 minutes rather than 200ºC.

I followed the recipe and video, including weighing ingredients .  The only thing I did differently was use a stand mixer  with a rough book instead of mixing in a bowl.  Very nice texture and flavor.  I let the dough stand for 8 hours until it doubled.  Good crunch, but tender inside.

This recipe produces a good French bread.  I’ve certainly had no complaints from those who’ve tasted the final product.  The next time I make this I’ll use the weight measurements as suggested rather than the volumes in the recipe.

I never thought it would be this easy to make beautiful, delicious,  and crusty French baguettes at home!  I've made a few different breads at home that my family has loved but this is by far my favorite!  Thanks Chef John!!!!!   If only it was this easy to make nice noodles!!!!!    ;)

This can be a very good recipe.  I made the full recipe and came out with 4 loaves that were not perfect but tasty.
The recommended temperature of 575 F does not exist on most ovens so there was a big compromise.  
My loaves were a little dense and took over 25 minutes to cook at 500 F.  Also I am away from grocery stores and only hard normal yeast and not rapid rise.  Once I get a chance with rapid rise and and oven that has a higher temperature setting I really believe i can make something to be proud of.

Great Baguette 
Easy and always turns out perfectly. Make sure you do not add too much flour or you make concrete. I usually hold out 1 cup of flour. I use a little less a little under 3 cups. Always turns out crisp outside and moist inside.

I made this great French Baguette and it was really a good close taste to the original one in France.  I can tell because I am a German and used to live 45 mins. away from France. The only mistake I had to make was to use Bred machine yeast instead of active dry yeast but I did not have it handy and continued ... the dough did not rise as much as I wanted it to see rising ... my mistake.   GOOD JOB  though with the recipe!

I made this 3 times. Each time a little better. I use cool water and double the yeast. Using weight is much better then cups etc.

The only change I’d make is to not dust the baking sheet with cornmeal, but would rather “dip” the loaves in the cornmeal then place on sheet.  I found that the excess cornmeal burnt very quickly in the 500 degree oven, causing lots of smoke.

Made this for dinner with my sister.  We had Mediterranean Artichoke dip and I sliced and toasted the baguette.  It turned out beautifully!  I've tried other recipes before and they never turn out, this was easy and tasted great!

I haven’t tried it yet but it looks impressive!! I’m making it to go with French onion soup! I found the dough wasn’t coming together so I added more water as needed and it turned out fine so don’t be afraid to add more water or flour cause you might have measured wrong!

Don’t have a scale so used the volume measurements, needed more water. Dough turned out well. I may have over-proofed the first rise, the second didn’t rise much. Make sure you make deep slits. The crust on this is amazing, but in my new oven 550 was WAY too hot. Almost burned first batch after only 9 min in. Lowered oven to 450 for second batch and it turned out much better. In addition to misting with water, I also dumped additional hot water into the water bath pan when first putting the bread in to create more steam. Will definitely make again!

This bread came out great. I took it to Thanksgiving dinner to accompany baked Brie with sautéed almonds in butter and honey. All four loafs were gone in such a short time, we were all amazed. I followed the directions exactly and it came out perfect. I did bake all four at the same time. Thank you for such a great recipe, I will definitely be making these again by popular demand.

Made per directions the first time. My dough seemed a bit dry and I added more water. It rose nicely and turned out pretty well. The next time I made it, I used bread flour and this seemed to work better. My oven was not hot enough and it took a while to get it to brown. I'll continue to play around with the recipe. The taste/texture is excellent.  And a no-knead bread is perfect for those whose hand strength is not what it used to be.

An excellent  btrad recipe. I made it  yesterday with my friends, and it's much better than the recipe I created by myself. The steps are simple and very easy to follow. The dough is soft and it's just to the point for me, and the result of the bread is pretty good, I think I will always use it in the future.
