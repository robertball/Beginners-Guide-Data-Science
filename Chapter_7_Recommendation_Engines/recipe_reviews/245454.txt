I've made this twice and it was great both times.  When you are cooking the butterscotch, make sure it boils nicely when you are cooking it for the five minutes.  Very easy and delicious.

It was very sweet and tasty, however it kept falling apart. Try putting it in the fridge for 30 minutes longer.
