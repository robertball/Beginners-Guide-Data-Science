My teenager and I loved these meatballs! I used dried parsley in place of fresh and added some pork as other reviewers have suggested. The Italian bread crumbs and spices add a nice flavor, plus I splurged on fresh Romano, yum. Bonus for us is no "icky bits"--i.e., little pieces of onion or pepper that my son's persnickety palate rejects. We didn't even add sauce or manage to get them onto rolls for sandwiches, just ate them straight from the oven. 10/10 will make again!

I really liked how quick and easy these meatballs were to make! A few ingredients, and you've got a delicious entree that you can serve as-is, with pasta, and with any sauce you want! I did use my own homemade Italian bread crumbs, and in the future, I think I'd use freshly minced garlic over garlic powder. I got 17 meatballs out of this (they were about 1 1/2" in size). I also didn't use the full 1/2 cup of water, because I think it would've been too wet with that amount. I'm not even sure it would be necessary to add in extra water at all. All-in-all though, great meatballs! Thank you!

This is my Mom’s basic recipe and it’s fantastic ( I did grow up eating these). I play a little with the recipe  now. I sometimes use a mixture of beef, veal and pork. Sometimes I use a mixture of basil and parsley. It’s all good! I actually like them better when they aren’t in the tomato sauce. Very tasty and addictive.

This was fabulous!  After baking the meatballs, I put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer for awhile. Excellent!

Really good! Would definitely made it again. 

I used italian seasoning  in lieu of parsley and parmesan instead of romano. 

Super easy and quick to make. Definitely going in the rotation.

I didn't have eggs. The eggs help these stick together better, but they worked fine without them. I didn't measure the spices exactly, but I think I would have liked them better if I double the spice.

I made it exactly as the recipe said ( I always do the first time). It was good not great. Next time I will probably double the spices, it was kind of bland for our taste.

Use the trinity of meats instead of just beef. a half pound each of ground pork, veal, and beef.  Will make them much more tender and tasty.
