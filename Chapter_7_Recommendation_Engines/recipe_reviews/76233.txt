I thought I did something wrong so I tried it again and the middle was raw. I will NEVER try this recipe again. What a waste of ingredients!

This bread was awesome.  I will only make this recipe from now on!  The texture was perfect, it rose above the pan, and it was gone in 1 day!

Should have listened to Ddrew02 - I even went on faith and doubled the recipe, only to get not one but two loaf pans full of unbakeable mush.  After removing the first loaf after an hour or so in the oven, I sliced it in half and discovered that the inside was still raw.  So I left the other loaf in for another 15 minutes, but that just gave it a burnt crust to go with its raw interior.  I triple-checked the recipe and I'm sure I did it right, so a word to the wise - stay away!!

I've been paying $2+ a slice for sugar free banana bread at *bucks. I doubled the recipe, used 1/2 wheat flour and added pecans instead of walnuts.  I had to cover the center with foil after 45 min. and bake an additional 10 minutes, as others had suggested.  Making my own coffee with this banana bread, I'll be able to take that cruise next year.  Thanks!

Moist and delicious.  Not greasy like some traditional banana breads.  Changes: doubled recipe, added 1 egg total, no nuts. Baked in one 5x9 pan and tray of mini loaf pans (9 mini loafs).  Baked 15min for little ones, 25 min for large one.  Yum!

This banana bread turned out great!  First time splenda baker and followed the directions to the "T" came out perfect.  And my family is excited since we are on Weight Watchers and the whole loaf is 33 points as opposed to other loafs were 50+ so now we can enjoy our favorite treat with less points :-).

Excellent! Just finished baking mine and it's wonderful! I doubled the recipe and halved my flour between white and wheat. I also added one scoop of protein powder. I was really nervous about trying this because I am a horrible bread baker and so many people said they had trouble getting this to rise, but I read on the Splenda box and it said to add 1/2 cp powder milk and an additional 1/2 tsp of baking soda to resolve this problem. Seemed to do the trick. Now, I did have a little trouble getting the middle to finish and my top was already browned but I just covered it with aluminum foil and this seemed to prevent over-browning while the middle finished cooking. Also, I made some up in a muffin pan...Fabulous! Cooked evenly and very very quickly! Also, I added diced apples to mine and for a truly decadent experience try  spreading some pineapple cream cheese on it...Uber Yummy! I think next time I will actually add pineapple to the batter and maybe some coconut too! Everyone should really try this, don't let the bad reviews scare you!

My first time baking with Splenda and I wasn't dissapointed.  I tweaked the recipe by subbing whole wheat flour and adding more wallnuts and a scoop of protien powder.  After reading reveiws of it being not done/soggy in the middle, I didn't check it after 40 minutes like I normally would have and I ended up baking it too long.  Add a little butter and yumm, I'll be making this again, thank you.

This bread was great for those of us who are looking for healthy alternatives.  I used whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose flour, and added a pint of raspberries instead of walnuts.  It was fully cooked through in 50 minutes.  I'll be making it again!

I love this recipe.  I found a little amaretto in the mix really accentuates the nutty goodness of the recipe.  Use really ripe bananas too.

This bread rose nicely and I did cover the top with foil after about an hour to maintain just the right browned color. After cooking for an additional 15 minutes, the inside was still too moist and chewy. The flavor, however is nice though a bit sweet, so I'll use less Splenda next try.

Instead of buttermilk i use 2 table spoon of dry nondairy creamer to a 1/4 cup of hot water

Made this over the weekend for a get together my husband was having with his friends . . . they ATE IT UP!!!  Tweeked the receipe a little but don't we all do that?  Covered the center to prevent overcooking the top and it came out perfect . . . added pecans and just watched it closely . . . They polished off three loaves in one evening!!!  I'd say that's a keeper and a pretty tasty recipe!!!  I didn't even spill the beans about it containing Splenda!!!

I don't understand how so many people can make the same recipe and get 2 results...1. perfect and 2. total FLOP.  I like others have made this 2 times, comes out of the oven perfect and within 3 minutes flat gooey mess that is uneatable.

It's a shame there isn't any rating button in the negative numbers.  I made two batches of this banana nut bread following the recipe exactly to the tee.  Both pans (in separtate ovens) fell when baked and ended up being only a gooey baked mess that never did firm up at all.  I feel the Spenda people owe me for the ingredients and my time.  What a waste.  I'm MAD as h***!!!

I've made this recipe twice now and both times the bread collapsed at the end of cooking becoming all gooey in the center. It isn't like a bread at all!

Delicious! I'll definitely make this recipe again. It’s the best thing I’ve had since being diagnosed with diabetes). I cut the loaf into serving sized pieces and froze some of them. I agree that this bread will be soggy in the middle if you're not careful. I baked it in a glass bread pan on top of a cookie sheet for exactly 45 minutes. I tested it with a toothpick and it came out clean but it needed 5 to 10 more minutes in the oven. Even with a small area of doughyness, it was wonderful.

The only thing I changed was to add more nuts and I baked it in muffin pans instead of bread pans.  They baked up nice and evenly without raw centers which can often happen with most banana bread recipes. This recipe will be replacing my old recipe because it is sugar-free and tasty!

I tried this recipe and thought it was great!! I did increase it by about 1/2 because I had more banana.  I added 1 egg, and replaced the buttermilk with cream and 1/2 tsp of lemon juice, did 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour, 1/2 white flour, and added almond slices instead of walnuts.  I did bake it about 1 hour 15 minutes total, but checked every 5 after 50 minutes. It is much healthier than my usual deliciously fat/sugar filled recipe.  I might suggest baking it at 325 and increasing the baking time to keep it from overbrowning.Yummy!

This was the first time I baked with Splenda and I was happy with the results. The cake is a bit heavy but is moist and delicious anyway. Baked it for the lowest amount of time suggested. Will make again when I have bananas to use up.

I have made some changes to the original recipe: instead of 1 1/3 cups all purpose flour: I used 3/4 cup flour and  1/4 all bran (pre-moisted, added 1 egg. We loved it. Thank you for the recipe!!!!

Unlike others, I didn't have a problem with the center of the cake being mushy.  I did,  however, think that:

1)  It was too sweet; and,
2)  It didn't rise enough

I'm not sure if #2 led to #1, but in the future, I think I'd reduce the amount of Splenda by half.

the recipe says to bake until center is set - use a toothpick to check for doneness, lower oven temp if too brown and cook longer. I decided to use the batter in an 8 inch pan, sprinkle with nuts and make bars!

I made this last night and it turned out perfectly.  I did have to bake it longer than instructed, or else the middle would have been raw and under cooked.  It smelled so good baking and was yummy still warm.  My kids loved it.

This bread is awesome, my kids love it!  I replaced half the white flour with wheat flour and it came out delicious!  I do not know what some people are doing wrong but this is one of the best banana recipies I have made.  It is not laden with sugar and fat and comes out soft and moist.

I read the reviews first.  Doubled the recipe, added cinnamon, and rasins.  This made 3 small loaf pans that were Great!

Even though I followed the recipe exactly, buying new baking powder to ensure that it would rise, the finished loaf was about 1 1/2 inches high and extremely crusty and dry.  What a disappointment.

This recipe turned out great!!  My husband loved it too! I added raisins because I didn't have nuts.  I also added a dash of cloves and cinnamon.  I cooked it for 48 minutes.

I tried this recipe, and it did not rise.  My husband decided to try it but cook it longer, and had the same dismal results.  We think this recipe omitted the eggs.  All of your other recipes have been great.

The bread has good flavor but the amount from the recipe should be doubled to make a bigger loaf. The amount made to thin of a loaf, otherwise it is a good recipe.

I wish I would have followed the other two reviewers who said the middle did not cook.

AWESOME! I didn't have any eggs, so I made this and it was great!  I didn't have buttermilk either, so I used my lactaid.  It was so moist and sweet.  Definitely a winner!  Surprise!

This recipe is great. Ten minutes prep, then pop it in the oven and forget about it for a little while...how could I not love it?? The bread is moist and tasty. I used soy flour in place of all-purpose for a lower carb, higher protein snack and it turned out wonderfully!!

I made this bread last night. The only change I made, was adding a cup of golden raisins.
I will bake it a few more minutes next time, the bottom was a little underdone...
I am glad I didn't read the reviews first, I may not have tried this recipe. As it stands, we LOVE IT!
WIll be making this for my Christmas give aways at work, fantastic! I think some of the bad reviews are because people expect this to taste like the sugar loaded variety. Sugar does more than just sweeten things, so there WILL be differences...I haven't had processed sugar in 5 years..and I for one, am absolutely THRILLED with Splenda and all the recipes here and ones I have tried on my own. This one is awesome!

My family loves banana bread, but I cringe whenever I see how much sugar and oil/butter called for in most recipes.  I didn't have buttermilk, so I added a splash of vinegar to my 1% milk before mixing with the other wet ingredients.  I also didn't have walnuts, but I did have semi sweet mini chocolate chips and added 2 T. of those.  For Weight Watchers, this recipe is 3 points per slice. My bread came out just right. A nice little treat.

This is a great recipe and the bonus is that it is low-fat/low-carb.  Made by the recipe except used no-fat buttermilk. Definitely a keeper.

I thought this was a great banana bread recipe (especially since it has about half the calories as other recipes). The only thing I changed was adding pecans instead of walnuts.
