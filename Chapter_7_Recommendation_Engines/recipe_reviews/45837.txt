Tracie B - your review on March 10, 2010 was completely off-base. You might know what Puerto Rican sofrito is but are obviously unaware of Cuban cooking and that version of sofrito. This recipe is very close to what could be called a standard recipe for CUBAN sofrito - as the recipe author stated.  True Cuban sofrito is cooked in extra virgon olive oil. Puerto Ricans tend to make sofrito like a salsa puree and then cook it later, Cubans tend to make it chunkier and cook it right when it is made.  Before you berate a recipe and its author you ought to be sure you know what you are talking about, and if you don't know for sure then keep quiet.

I HAVE BEEN USE THIS SITE FOR A LONG TIME BUT NEVER JOIN. I JOINED BECUASE I WAS VERY MAD ABOUT THIS RECIPE. I DON'T SEE HOW SOME PEOPLE HAVE THIS A 5 STAR FOR SOFRITO MAYBE A 3 STAR FOR SALSA BUT NOT SOFRITO. I DID NOT LIKE THIS. 1ST PEEL THE TOMATOES(IF YOU ARE USING REGULAR TOMATOES WHICH I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD FOR SOFRITO FROM WHAT I SEEN IN SOME LATIN CAFE).IT DOES REMIND ME OF MEXICAN SALSA WITH OUT A KIC(PUT HOT SAUCE THEN MAYBE). THE TASTE WAS NOT RIGHT FOR SOFRITO. GLAD I MADE IT FOR MY FAMILY ANF NOT FOR A DINNER PART. I WOULD HAVE BEEN RUNNING TO THE PHONE FOR TAKE OUT.I GUESS I'M STILL LOOKING FOR A GOOD CUBAN SOFRITO

I do not like this and is not a sofrito you  do not used tomatoes. You used onions, green, red or any other color pepper, garlic, culantro, cilantro and agi dulces if you like it with some kic. The tomatoes or tomato sauce you put it later with other seasoning.....

I dated a cuban man whose mother used to make a sauce like this (which was his favorite) and she would never give me the recipe.

I wasn't thrilled about the vague instructions.  I did get a "yummy" green paste after cooking the vegetables for quite a while.  I would suggest mincing the onion, garlic, and bell pepper as finely as possible.  I also I had to add water from time to time to keep the mixture from burning on my pan.   

If using fresh tomato, I would suggest peeling it first.  Turns out 3/4 cup of tomato sauce is pretty much one of the small 8oz cans.  

Again "really red" is a vague description of color.  I cooked the sauce until it was a rich red color with no more appearance of green.  In the process of doing this, I added about 2 tbs red wine and 1/4 beef bullion broth when the sauce got too thick.

I used this sauce to make a casserole using sliced red potatoes and ground pork.  The family loved it.  Next time, I'm putting it in the crock pot with pot roast and potatoes. 

Despite the hard to follow instructions, the flavors and spices of this sauce were very appealing.  It's a keeper.

Maybe the people reviewing are not Puerto Rican or Cuban because this is NOT sofrito! I tried it, was wondering about the ingredients, but I'm tired of using Goya frozen sofrito. Anyhow, this reminds me of a pico de gallo salsa mixture. Definately NOT an authentic sofrito :(

This is wonderful on everything we've eaten it with so far. A strong tomato flavor. Mine never made a "green paste" as referenced in the directions while cooking, it was starting to get dark and caramel colored and still really chunky. (no one else has mentioned this?) ...anyway, I went ahead and followed the directions. I did cook mine a lot longer than the given time adding water as needed...This stuff is amazing! I used it to top steamed calrose "sticky rice" and beans. Also used some of this to top fivebrig's Carne Guisada.  Delicious for dipping tortilla chips in too! Thank you for sharing this wonderful recipe!

An authentic Sofrito ONLY has Olive oil, Garlic, Onions, Bell Pepper, Salt and Pepper.  Depending on what you may be cooking that you would add Tomato, Bay leaves or Oregano.

This is a great sauce to add to various dishes. Made mine a few days ahead of the stew I was planning to make to give the sauce time for the flavors to mingle.

What have I been missing?!  This sauce is incredibly vibrant.  It's going to be a new staple in my refrigerator.  I put some  sofrito in boring old chicken salad sandwiches, and WOW.  I'm adding it to the beans and rice I'm going to serve to company tonight.  I know already it's going to be a hit.  This recipe is certainly a keeper!  Thanks for sharing.

This is very close to my Abuela's sofrito. For all you that say this isn't sofrito because of no cilantro - Cubans DO NOT USE cilantro in our sofrito. Instead we use oregano! I don't even like the taste of cilantro - yuck.

Sorry, this NOT Sofrito.   I don't know where this recipe came from, but it's missing Cilantro, Culantro and fresh tomato. Also, it has OIL?  It's not supposed to be cooked. this make make some tasty type of sauce, but this is NOT Sofrito.  Sofrito is a few basic, FRESH ingredients processed until smooth in a food processor. People, enjoy this as a sauce, but if you think this is authentic Sofrito, either Cuban OR Puerto Rican, you are mistaken.

This is authentic Cuban sofrito, no tomatillos, no hot peppers, no cilantro but of course, comino (cumin)! It's similar to Puerto Rican sofrito which would add acaparra (capers) and green olives and omit the cumin. It's all delicious, love both cuisines.

A bright hit of flavor to go with grilled flank steak in Mojo Grilling Marinade and Cuban Black Beans II (both from this site).

Thanks Margie.  This recipe is delicious and tasty.  My brother who has never tried cuban food tried it over some meat and black beans and couldn't stop raving about how good it was.  Said he never tasted anything like it before.  My husband loved it too.  Thanks again.

Both of my parents were from Cuba... not the Caribbean side where sofrito tends to be spicy... Cuban sofrito is made with olive oil for starters; this recipe is very similar to what my parents taught my sisters and I.

WOW! I just started a diet and I can eat all the vegi's I want, so I tried this! Sadlly since I have never been to either Cuba or Puerto Rico so I can't vouch for the authenticity of the dish, I do have a friend that is Puerto Rican and she adds tomato when cooking in a specific dish. I made this last night and added it to beans and rice, and I used some today on fish! Both were wonderful! The only thing I changed was to omit the oil and use olive oil cooking spray to omit the fat and can of diced tomato drained instead of fresh (didn't have any)I also added a bit of corriander to even out the cilantro vs oregano debate. I did forget the Bay leaf but I will use them when I make more tomorrow. This is staying in my fridge as long as I'm on this diet!!! And even After!!!!
UPDATE!!! I just returned from a vacation 5 days in Miami and 6 days in the Islands. This was almost dead on to the sofrito that was served with many of my meals!

I don't know about authentic Cuban dishes but I know this is a real keeper of a recipe. I made it just as written with the exception of not having any tomatoes so I left them out. The trick I think is to cook it for the full 30 minutes to blend the flavors. Meanwhile, I seasoned a pot roast with Everglades Seasoning and browned it in oil in a pressure cooker. Then I added two cups of liquid and cooked it 20 minutes. Both were done at the same time. I used the liquid from the pressure cooker to thin the sauce a little, added the cut up meat to the sauce and served it with black beans, yellow rice and cuban bread. YUM!

This was killer.  I will for sure be making this again.  It was so full of flavor.  I used red, yellow and orange mini peppers that I had in the house and some fresh tomatoes.  I am not sure how authentic this recipe is, and based on the other reviews, I would say it may not be but, I thought is was awesome.  I can think of so many different ways that I would use this.

This is an excellent sauce for many different recipes.  I make it exactly like the recipe calls for, but at the end I sometimes put it in the blender to make a smoother sauce.  It's great for shredded chicken or beef.  Excellent recipe!  Excellent flavor!

As it is, this is lovely - a great base for a beef stew.  But I have added chopped olives which really adds to the flavour. About 1 cup, but depends on how strong you like the flavour to be - a hint or a real taste. Good for a slow cooker.
