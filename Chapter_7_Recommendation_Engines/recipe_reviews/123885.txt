This is one of my favorite cold weather meals.  A nice change from the ordinary chili.  I omit the tomatoes and opt for tomato sauce and water for the picky eaters in my house

I really enjoyed this recipe which is very easy to put together.  I used Bratwurst Sausages which I sliced and did not brown first.  I couldn't find kidney beans so I used Baked Beans in tomato sauce.  For quickness I used frozen hash browns instead of potatoes and I didn't use thyme as I didn't have any.  Thank you for this recipe, yummy.  Irene

Very tasty and hearty.  I used bulk Ialian sausage, and so added some Italian seasoning.  Also added some carrot, celery, and shredded cabbage for more veggies.  So good on a cold night!

This is a great recipe. Inexpensive, quick, and easy. You can expand it by adding more of your favorite ingredient and some chicken or vegetable broth.  Great with cornbread.

I doubled the recipe and I used 1 pound of ground Sweet Italian sausage and 1 pound ground HOT italian sausage...It was spicy though. I simmered it for one hour also. I also added Taco seasoning packet

Fabulous chowder!! Only trade I made was the potato for chopped fresh cauliflower (I'm not allowed potatoes for health reasons). Worked perfectly. Such a great flavor combination. Thanks for sharing. Will make again and again and again....

Very good and simple! I only simmered mine for an hour and it was fine. I subbed red pepper for green pepper (hubby won't eat the green ones). I'll be making this again.

I've made this a few times and enjoyed it very much.  I sometimes add 1 tsp. of taco seasoning mix to give it a kick.  I've also added carrots, zucchini or red pepper.  When I want it thicker, I reduce the tomato juice and smash the kidney beans a bit to thicken it.  Very tasty.

This was needed a bit more taste to kick it up.  I added ground cayenne pepper.  I made another bean soup recipe on this site and it used fresh spinach so I added what I didn't use in that soup. At the last minute I realized I forgot to add in the chopped potatoes (glad I did) so I grabbed a handful of mini pasta and put in and let simmer about 10 more minutes.  Loved the way it turned out.

I did not have tomato juice, so I used two cans of V8; turned out quite well.
