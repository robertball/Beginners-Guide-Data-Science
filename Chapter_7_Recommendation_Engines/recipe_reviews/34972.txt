Great sauce! Vodka sauces are so easy, but taste like you spent hours. I cut the amount of pasta in half and sauteed three cloves of minced garlic along with about 1/4 cup of finely chopped onion in the olive oil. I added 1/4 tsp. of crushed red pepper flakes along with the vodka. Instead of the whole peeled tomatoes I used a 28 oz. can of chunky crushed tomatoes plus an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce. After adding the crushed tomatoes & sauce I added the fresh basil, 1/4 tsp. of oregano, 1 tsp. of parsley, 1/2 tsp. of salt and 2 tsp. of sugar. I used a good vodka and light cream. The grated parmesan made it extra creamy. Instead of the proscuitto, we grilled some chorizo sausage and sliced that up over the penne pasta - poured the sauce over top. Great with a side of garlic bread and a salad!

I can see myself making this dish on a regular basis; it so easy and the ingredients so simple.  My only problem with this dish was adding the cheese at the end before mixing with the pasta.  I found that the melting cheese made my toppings of proscuitto, basil, & mushrooms stick and clump together.  So I had clumps of delicious toppings tossed with my pasta.  Next time, I'll toss the pasta with the sauce and add the cheese while I'm tossing, so it melts onto the pasta, binding toppings with pasta, and not toppings with each other.

The whole family gobbled this up! I doubled the prosciutto (wanted to use it up), and omitted the red pepper flakes for fear it would be too spicy for the children. I reduced the tomato mixture quite a bit before adding the vodka and cream (used fat free 1/2&1/2)...probably 15-20 minutes. I also added 2 Tbsp capers and 1/4 frozen peas when I added the vodka and cream. I also made this with whole wheat penne. I did not add the basil as directed because of picky children, so I just topped the adults bowl with a few chopped basil leaves. A definite repeater in this house.

I really liked this recipe, although I modified it using what I had in the house.  I left out the heavy cream, used white wine instead of vodka, angel hair instead of penne, and added more italian spices (oregano, thyme, etc).  I liked it a lot... it turned out more like an arrabiata sauce, but it had a lot fewer calories, too!

THIS WAS VERY GOOD----A KEEPER. I HAVE MADE TOMATO/VODKA SAUCE BEFORE, BUT THIS IS THE BEST. I ALSO MUST ADD THAT I NEVER CHANGE A RECIPE THE FIRST TIME I TRY IT. I DID WITH THIS TO ADD SOME MEAT WITH IT. INSTEAD OF THE PROSCIUTTO, [WHICH WE REALLY DON'T LIKE] I BROWNED 6 WINE & CHEESE ITALIAN SAUSAGES & CONTINUED WITH THE SAME PAN, [DEGLAZING WHEN ADDING THE TOMATOES] & THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS. HOWEVER, I REMOVED THE SAUSAGES & SLICED THEM UP. WHEN ALL WAS DONE, I JUST TOSSED THEM INTO THE SAUCE BEFORE POURING OVER THE PENNE. DEEEEEEEELISH! PROBABLY NOT AS IMPRESSIVE LOOKING IF SERVING TO COMPANY, BUT TRY IT FOR THE FAMILY---VERY PLEASING!

This is a very good base.  My changes are; 2 slices off the end of a 1 lb. of bacon, omit the prosciutto (only because I didn't want to drive downtown to the Italian market), whole tomatoes, replace with 1 14oz.can diced tomatoes with garlic and oregano, 2 cups of contadina pizza sauce, 1/4 cup vodka...(I only had 100 proof on hand), 2 shakes oregano powder, 2 shakes dried parsley, 1 4oz. can drained mushroom slices, no added salt.  Unbelievable, and I have learned from some of the very best Italians out there.

Another winner from Marianne (try her Tropical Salad too, folks). Thank you Marianne! My Italian husband, who loves rich pasta dishes, swooned over this. I used cooked bacon for the proscuitto and reduced the amt. of cheese a little bit. This is a great "treat" recipe, definitely a keeper.

Incredible flavor and very easy to make, perfect for a crowd.  Everyone loved it.  I substituted half and half and cut down on the parmesan and it was still fantastic.  This one is going right into the surefire-hit file!

This recipe was excellent.  It tasted like something you order from a restaurant.  Adding chicken or shrimp makes this meal even better.

Great "company" meal!  Easy to make but tastes like you slaved all day.  I may replace the prociutto with shrimp or scallops next time, just for variety.

Delicious!  An easy dish to throw together quickly for guests, but tastier and more impressive than your standard tomato sauce.  This was my first time cooking with proscuitto, and though skeptical, it added a lot to the dish.

Fabulous flavours! We've made this many times now. The only change we make is to add more prosciutto and garlic. Quality parmigiano reggiano makes a huge difference. So easy and delicious.
Thanks Marianne!

I know this recipe has had great reviews so far but we did not like this at all.  I have never cooked with prosciutto before and maybe it was that flavor that we did not care for. I increased the prosciutto because my husband likes more meat in dishes like this.... I would not recommend doing that.

Oh my! This was so good. I followed the recipe exactly with the exception of accidentally using two LARGE 28 oz cans of tomatoes instead of the 16 oz cans. Instead of penne, I used mafalda pasta. In spite of the extra tomatoes, it was a delicious dish. I didn't drain the tomatoes and so allowed the sauce to simmer a little longer. The original recipe states that it makes four servings but we found it to be more like eight servings. If the calorie content is daunting, keep in mind that the serving size is huge as written. This is definitely something to keep in mind for a dinner party. Also, if you have a loved one who can't eat onions, this recipe is perfect.

Great pasta dish!  Only changed up a couple of things as other raters suggested:  Added sauted mushrooms & onions, Italian Seasoning, about 1/8 cup dried basil and petite diced tomatoes rather than whole peeled tomatoes.  I would definately recommend this recipe, but with a side salad and french bread it serves more like 6 plus.  I first made this and reviewed it in July above, I've now made this recipe at least 8 more times.  I have tried the Half & Half in place of the heavy cream, trying to cut the calories and after having it made with the heavy cream, the Half & Half just doesn't give it the same flavor or body.  I recommend sticking to the heavy cream if possible.  After making this so many times and trying different alterations, I now have it perfected to family & friends taste and have had to give the receipe to everyone that I've made it for.  Other than the above suggestions I have one more recommendation.  Either cut back on the amount of pasta or increase the amount of sauce.  I haven't been measuring the exact amount of pasta, but I leave about an 1 1/2 to 2" in the box and use the rest.  This is still a 5 star recipe and truly the best Italian pasta dish I have ever made - amazing!

This was a great and quick recipe but instead of using heavy cream, I used 1% milk and thickened it with cornstarch.  Came out delicous and a lot healthier!

I made this the other night for my family and we all LOVED LOVED LOVED it!!!  My six year old son also begged to take the leftovers to school in his lunchbox.  It was so so easy and very tasty.  The only thing I did any differently was to use four HUGE cloves of garlic (because we love garlic), and I do agree that the shredded parmesan cheese did clump up with the other ingredients, but even this we didn't mind because the taste was so wonderful.  It seemed at the time like a lot of vodka to use (especially for the kids), but it didn't have a vodka taste at all.  We all loved this and will be using this recipe over and over!  I can't get over how simple it was to make since it was so delicious, it tasted more complex.  Thanks so much for this great new recipe!

This recipe had good flavor.  My only concern was that the parmesan cheese did not melt in to the dish but rather clumped up.  I am not sure that I did everything right, but I thought I followed the recipe pretty well. It was still tasty thanks for the recipe.

I always cook a recipe as it is written the first time.  Although I cooked this as is and enjoyed it, I think I will make a few modifications next time.  I didn't like the flavor of the prosciutto at all.  I would substitute Italian sausage the next time. I also thought the whole tomatoes were rather a pain.  I had to use my potato masher to break them up as 18 minutes of cooking didn't do it.  We still ended up with some rather stringy chunks of tomato.  The next time I'll try crushed tomatoes.  Other than that it was very good.  Thanks for the recipe.

This recipe is AWESOME!! My 18 year old was looking for an easy Penne a la Vodka recipe and this was it!  The only substitution was dried basil instead of fresh, other than that followed the recipe exactly and it was really delicious!  The only recommendation for a new cook would be to make sure you add the parmesan cheese after you remove from the heat, my son didn't realize this but it was still great anyway. Highly recommend this recipe.

This dish was good and will definitely make it again.  Next time I will reduce the amount of Vodka requested (it was a little too strong for me) and add mushrooms and instead of whole peeled tomatoes, I will try the diced tomatoes with Italian seasonings.  Other than that, this recipe is definitely a keeper

Very good recipe. I thought the sauce would never thicken, but it did! We served it with our favourite "bucatini" pasta. We also made a simple ceasar salad to serve with it.
I think it will be very nice to add some shrimps!
A keeper, thanks.

this was completely delicious, but i did make a few changes because of what was in the house.  I used cayenne pepper instead of the pepper flakes, and i only used an 1/4 t (and boy was it spicy!) i used vanilla vodka, because it was all we had, and i used 3 oz of meat because that's the smallest package it came it at the store! I also used rigatoni pasta because we had it, and we thickened the sauce with a slurry of flour and water.  I will be making this one again, but next time i will also make it with rolls to sop up the delicious sauce!

Interesting flavor.  Used exact ingredients listed.  Would have like slightly thicker sauce, may try to reduce further next time -- was worried it would scorch this time.  Tip: remove pan from heat and sprinkle in a spoon full of parmesan at a time to prevent clumping.  Curious to see how leftovers reheat tomorrow.

Great recipe! I did a few changes... I didn't cook the whole box of pasta. 3/4 is enough for the sauce amount. I used (2) 14oz cans of crushed tomato and (1) 8 oz can of tomato sauce. 1 small onion. Added about 1/2 Tablespoon of sugar while simmering and used panchetta(available at publix or italian speciality stores) instead of prosciutto. Lastly, I fried about 3 chopped slices of panchetta till it was crispy and sprinkled on top of pasta when serving. DELICIOUS! will definitley make again, my fiance loved it. One other tip.. simmer for 15 minutes with all ingredients(including basil) and then add vodka, simmer 15 more min, then cream and parm cheese, simmer 10 min. PERFECTION!

I just made this and it's sooooo good! I was a little scared when I put in the vodka because I could really smell it (never cooked with it before), but it mixes in great and by the end there's no trace of it. The dish is delicious (not to mention ridiculously easy & fast - I'm e beginner cook)! I was looking for a change from the good old shrimp alfredo, and this is delicious! Thank you!!!   P.S.: I'm waiting for my boyfriend to come home, but I really just wana eat NOW! LoL

One of the best pastas I've ever made.  If anything, I'd do a little more sauce per pasta since it's a tiny bit dry on reheating.  Otherwise, the flavor is just amazing.

Loved this recipe! Quck, easy and tasty. I took this to a pot luck and everyone loved it. I would use chopped tomatoes the next time however as I ended up cutting up the whole tomatoes.

I didn't change anything. Only problem was I thought I had a little too much penne so I didn't use all of it with the sauce. I also thought the sauce could have been thicker, so maybe I'll add a little cornstarch next time. I was skeptical about the flavor with so few ingredients, but it turned out pretty good! I might add onions next time, or do half vodka, half white wine - just something to add more flavor. To really complete this dish, add chicken! I marinated some chicken strips in Italian salad dressing for 1-2 hours, put on the Foreman grill for 7 minutes, and placed the strips on top of the bowls of pasta. It was a great meal!

Made recipe exactly as called for, was pretty happy with the end results! I really don't understand how others can rate a recipe when they are "modifying" it. The only way to truly rate any recipe on this site is to make it the way it was submitted!

I made this tonight for my mother's birthday dinner and it was fantastic!
I tweaked the recipe a tiny bit, but I basically kept it all the same.
I cut about 5 chicken breasts in chunks, seasoned them with a tiny bit of salt, pepper, and garlic, heated up a bit of olive oil in the pan and added the chicken. I let the chicken brown on one side and just cooked it a tiny bit on the other. I removed the chicken from the pan and put it in a bowl covered with a plate to keep the steam in. Then I followed the recipe only I added half a medium onion to the garlic and prosciutto and I used a big can and small can of diced tomatoes... I used 1/2 cup of Grey Goose, instead of a full cup...It came out sooo GOOD!
The next time I make this I am going to do a big can of crushed tomatoes and a small can of diced to make the sauce a tiny bit thicker, but it should have the same taste and I might add a bit more proscutto the next time too...I will be making this again and again!

I love this recipe! It was different and upscale and great for company.  I made it with Abby's Chicken Rollatini as another poster recommended with great results.  I think next time I will use both recipes together but instead of penne pasta I will use spinach linguine for even more color and effect.

This is good enough to have been served in a restaurant.  Sooo easy and delicous.  I can't wait to serve this to company.  Only changes were diced instead of whole tomatoes and used more prosciutto.

Delicious! My husband and I felt like we were dining in Italy. I accidentally added an extra 1/4 cup of vodka, but it all turned out fine. The parmesan cheese and red peppers were divine. Make this recipe...tonight!

I substituted cooking sherry for vodka (we were out of vodka) and used light cream cheese instead of half and half. Then skipped the crushed pepper and parmesan cheese. Wonderful flavor!!! A great recipe!

This was my first time making Vodka sauce....Loved this recipe.....I didnt have prosciutto so i used bacon instead....i increased the garlic to 5 cloves (big garlic fans in my house) i used Absolut Vodka with mine.... i didnt have fresh basil which i think would have put this over the top. i used a Tsp and half italian herb seasoning. i also used diced tomatoes instead of stew tomatoes....also which i think is KEY is i let this simmer for about 45 minutes.....then let it cool for about 30 minutes and then placed it in the food processor and pulsed it!!!!  never put hot liquid in food processor!!!!! i did everything else the same with the recipe..... My daughter couldn't put the dish down! Loved it!!!!!

This was easy to make and tasty! We served with Abby's Chicken Rollatini (also good) as a side dish. This could be the main course though :)  I typically don't love cream-based sauces but this has a good flavor and just the right creaminess.

I mainly order vodka sauce in Italian restaurants for a while now, but I've had some that was terrific and some that was really terrible - this is as good as I've had.  I am so proud of myself!!  I used rotelle pasta- it's not an elegant presentation, but it holds on to the sauce extremely well.  Also used white wine - alas, no vodka on hand - I don't notice a difference..  Also used 2 large fresh tomatoes instead of canned, they didn't look promising at all, but they certainly went to good use!  I loved it, thanks, Marianne!  No more trips to the Italian market just for vodka sauce..

Ok, it's been a while since I made this, but, thank goodness I take good notes : ) Made this for myself one Friday evening (my bf had plans or else I wouldn't have made it - he doesn't care for vodka sauce). I thought this was "OK". Certainly not deserving of 5 stars IMHO. A good friend of mine (who is a GREAT Italian cook) makes her vodka sauce with crushed tomatoes (only change made), so I decided to make mine with crushed as well (28 oz. can). I think that may have ruined this recipe.... Regardless, I didn't care for the taste, but maybe it's just me (vodka sauce is not my favorite, but I DO enjoy it from time to time). I could barely taste the prosciutto or basil (which is unusual as basil imparts a strong flavor). After purchasing all of the ingredients, this turned out to be a very expensive meal for one, especially considering that I didn't eat the leftovers. Thank goodness I had vodka on hand (Smirnoff). My grocery bill would have doubled!!! Served with a Pepperidge Farms Artisan Rosemary olive oil mini loaf (found in my grocer's frozen section). Edible, but won't make again. Sorry!

This is just about the easiest thing in the world to make, and so good!! I didn't have any prosciutto, and so made this vegetarian. Instead of 2 cans whole peeled tomatoes, I used 1 can diced tomatoes and 1/2 a jar of spaghetti sauce, because that's what I had on hand. It was still absolutely delicious!!

Pasta had a great flavor, but will not add the prosciutto next time.  It seemed to toughen up too much and did not add to the flavor.  It would not be missed.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It's easy to make and extremely tasty.  

I didn't have the prosciutto so I substituted an equivalent amount of shaved ham - worked fine.  Just be sure to use EXACTLY the amount of red pepper flakes the recipe calls for, and be sure the sauce reduces to a point of thickness before mixing with the pasta.

My wife couldn't get enough of this.

I made this, along with Abby's Chicken Rollatini, for my boyfriend.  He loved it.  I followed the recipe, except I mixed the parm with the hot noodles instead of in the sauce, as suggested by other readers.  It was excellent!  I will definitely make this again.  Thanks!

Incredibly delicious!  I made this for dinner when friends stopped by - received rave reviews all the way around! The fresh basil adds a great flavor, as well as the prosciutto.  For sure my stand-by "grown up" way of serving pasta....no more boring spaghetti and sauce for us!!  Thanks so much for posting!

I absolutely love pasta dishes- they're my favorite- but this one just didn't really do it for me. I made this exactly as the recipe states except I used a lighter cream in an effort to keep the calories down. I like dishes with some spice/heat but I thought that this one relied to heavily on the red pepper flakes- that was all I could taste and not any of the other ingredients- especially the prosciutto (aside from the texture I couldn't even tell when I had some in my mouth!) All in all I probably won't make this again. I would've given it 3 stars but my boyfriend and my mom both loved it so I compromised with 4 stars. Also- I waited to write my review hoping that it would be good as leftovers but there wasn't much of a difference.

This was delicious. And an easy one pan recipe (except cooking the pasta seperately). I added 1 lb. small shrimp in with the tomatoes (I used diced tomatoes). It was great. Thank you.

This recipe went over very big in my picky household. It rivaled anything you could get in the best Italian restaurant. The only changes I made were to use dried basil because I didn't have fresh, and I added the parm cheese directly to the hot pasta before I added the sauce. My family actually begged for leftovers - which they never do!!

I will be making this recipe for a date this weekend...but I thought I remind all my fellow culinary friends that you can substitute bacon for the prosciutto.  The only difference is that it's not bacon is smoked.

We found this recipe to be quite delicious.

We used half and half instead of cream.

I would suggest however, to reduce the bacon first, then add the garlic and continue.  The bacon was not very crispy when done according the original recipe.

Other than that, very easy to make, not many dishes to clean up and very, very tasty.  We would recommend this recipe!

I’ve been making this recipe for almost 20 years now (or somewhere around there)! It’s so homey, easy breezy to make and the leftovers are even better the next day! So simple yet so delish! I sub 2 cans of fire roasted tomatoes and always add a little more cream for extra sauce! Love it!!!

This was very good. I made it a second time and added a 1/2 cup of the shredded four cheese (Mozzarella, Provolone, Parmesan and Romano) and 1/2 Tbl sugar. Turned out awesome. I made it a third time and substituted crushed tomatoes for the peeled and it still turned out great.

This was delicious but next time I will use pancetta. I don’t really like the smokiness of Prosciutto  but everyone loved it

Basic recipe is wonderful and a keeper.  I made this recipe as written and w/ two small modifications is a keeper for me.  Next time, however,  I'm going with 1/3 cup, not the recommended 1/2 cup of vodka, and will cook the penne about 2 minutes longer ( al dente is a must, but under done is under done).

I made this tonight and it definitely had a good flavor. I added extra red pepper flakes and a little bit of white onion. I will say that it only made enough sauce for about half the pasta so you will likely need to double your sauce recipe or half your pasta. I had already poured it over all the pasta when I realized it wasn't enough and I had to make a second batch of sauce. You should also add your parmesan after removing from the heat because the cheese clumped a bit. Will likely make again.

This was great tasting..until I added the called for cup of Parmesan cheese. It became extremely salty! If I make it again, I will only garnish with the cheese.

Made this last night for dinner and my fiance said it was a keeper, and I agree. My only problems with it were that O didn't quite understand using whole peeled tomatoes, it was unclear if I should just put them in as such, chop them, break then when they were in the sauce. In the end I left them whole in the sauce and then pulled them out at the end before tossing the pasta, which I used tortellini for. I think next time I'll buy crushed. Also I would cut the pepper flakes by half, it was a little spicey for my taste. I did some chicken breast in a cast iron and added slices of it on top after plating.

I looooooooved this recipe. for some reason or another I always fail miserably at making vodka sauce, but this was beyond delicious.  I added my own twist to it and used butter instead of oil. skipped the pepper flakes (children were going to eat this). I wanted it to be extra creamy so I added a little more heavy cream and also added cream cheese. I went a little overboard with the vodka, since I was making 3x the portion and it ended being on the stove for over 2 hours! BUT I think that brought out the flavors out even more... I was not happy with how watery it seemed so I did sift some flour into the sauce. in the end it came up great, there was an excellent balance of flavors, it tasted rich, creamy, and smooth. the sauce itself tasted great on its own!!!

I Followed this recipe and found it to be too watery and not very flavorful even when allowing to simmer 20 min after adding the cream sauce & vodka. Next time I'm straining off the canned tomatoes, removing the red pepper flake, reducing the basil and adding a touch of oregano.

The sauce tasted delicious, but was a little thin. Needs to be reduced longer than what the directions say. Other than that it was delicious and my family loved it.

This was so, so good. The only change I would make next time would be to omit the prosciutto. You can't taste it, and prosciutto is expensive. If I'm buying it, I want to taste it! Otherwise, a really yummy dinner.

I followed the recipe as is, using high quality ingredients and it was ABSOLUTELY delicious. . . The quality of the ingredients are especially important with this recipe. . . . The better your ingredients the better the flavor. . . .This is definitely my go-to Penne alla Vodka recipe from now on. . . .

Have been wanting to try this recipe for awhile, and finally did tonight. Oh. My. Goodness. Delicious!! And just in case anyone wonders whether or not roasted red peppers could substitute for the canned tomatoes (because that was all I had on hand, believe it or not), the answer is a resounding yes! Thanks so much for the recipe.

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  I substituted chorizo sausage for the prosciutto and I didn't have cream so I added some sun-dried tomato alfredo sauce.  Also added some red pepper flakes to the mix.  Great dish!

We really liked this as a hearty side dish.  Was even better as leftovers, like so many tomato based pasta dishes.  My husband doesn't eat pork, so I substituted the turkey bacon and was pleased with the results.  This will most likely make it on my dinner table again at some point in the future.

I've made this twice over the past few weeks.  Delicious!  The second time I used white wine instead of vodka, but I preferred the vodka.  I will add this to my "easy but good enough for company" list!

Made this recipe for my boyfriend for valentines day... needless to say he loved it and has told me he will never leave me. Only changes were that i added about a 500g (about a pound) of uncooked prawns(peeled and deveined) at the last minute and cooked until they were pink. Also used fettucine rather than penne, but thats just personal choice. A great base for a pasta sauce. Thanks!!!

Great! I keep kosher, so the prosciutto was out. Instead, I sauted an onion and 4 oz. of mushrooms before adding the rest of the ingredients. This recipe is simple and delicious and even the kids enjoyed it. Thanks

I used a little less vodka & cream, a little more than doubled the prosciutto & this turned out great!  My husband especially loved it & can not wait for me to make again.  I think the left-overs were even better the next day.  
Thanks for an easy recipe that turned out teriffic!!!

This recipe is fabulous! Easy and delicious.  Only thing I did different is I used a can of diced tomatoes as suggested in another review and when it was on the plate, I sprinkled parmesan cheese over top.  It was a hit with everyone.

My husband is not a big tomato fan..but this is one dish I will make for him again. Only thing I changed was I used a can of cherry tomatoes. Think I will use the recommended ingredients next time. But overall this was a great dish!

Having read past reviews before trying this recipe, I added extra garlic, doubled the proscuitto, and added a bit of extra basil and parmesan, but still think this dish is just lacking something. My family liked it, but I doubt I will make it again as it didn't thrill me at all.

It was ok, but definitely not great.  I felt the tomato flavor was too overwhelming and trying to mash the whole tomatoes was quite cumbersome. I also felt like the flavors never truly came all together and blended.  I could taste every ingredient, but it didn't mesh very well.  Perhaps with a few modifications this may be a winner.

We really liked the unique taste of this pasta dish.  Made a few changes because of what we had on hand but basically stuck to the original recipe, used 1/2 cup of half and half, Italian stewed tomatoes, whole wheat penne and spicy Italian sausage - will try a different sausage next time as well as more seasoning.
Thks for sharing.

This dish was excellent!!! It had the spicy kick that I love. I preferred smaller pieces of tomatoes. I did cut them up but, I will buy diced next time.

I made this per instructions.  However, it had a "sharp" dominate tomato flavor.  Maybe I should have added some sugar?  Also, I think I would saute the prosciutto longer...making it almost crisp...before adding the garlic and red pepper.  I think with a litte tweaking, this is a 5 star recipe.

This wasn't the best pasta sauce I've had, but it wasn't the worst.. the proscuitto was dry, and the parm cheese got chunky. Maybe I didn't make it right, maybe that's how it's supposed to be. Either way, I won't make it again.

Wonderful recipe, my husband loved it and my father in law who won't eat anything that has cream in it, asked for seconds!  The only thing I did was to use my immersion blender to smooth it out a bit.

Very good. The proscuitto adds a nice touch. It's good without it, but better with, I think.
