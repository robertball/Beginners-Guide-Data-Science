Hi, It's CJ McD, recipe author.  Just wanted to add an additional note and that is to "gently" break or smash the potatoes, just to break them open, but not to smash to pieces.  I will try to be more clear with the next recipe I submit.  This was my first attempt.  *learning*

I've rated lots of recipes on this site, (which I am addicted to by the way!), but I have never wanted more to have the option of rating higher than a 5.  How about a 10, a 20, or perhaps a 60.  I had no idea that potatoes could be this good.  I did follow some of the reviewers advice and tossed the potatoes with the butter and oil and then sprinkled the cheese and spices on and tossed the potatoes on the  cooking tray.  Worked great.  I did also turn the potatoes half way through the cook time.  Oh my, so good.  The crunchy bits left on the cooking pan were particularyl good.  Will make this often.  Thanks so much for the recipe!

We LOVED the flavor and crispness of these potatoes!!!  Definitely a recipe that will be repeated and soon!  Although we loved the taste of these, I did significantly change the process. For starters, when I mashed my potatoes they just fell apart into clumps, so I realized immediately that there would be no "tossing" of these or they would have completely fallen apart.  I also didn't like the idea of combining the oil, butter, parmesan and spices.  Instead I combined the oil and butter, and I separately combined the parmesan and spices.  I drizzled half the oil mixture over the potatoes and then sprinkled with half the parmesan mixture.  I carefully turned the potatoes over and repeated the drizzling and sprinkling.  I assembled this ahead, covered and refrigerated until I popped it in the oven.  After baking for 30 minutes I sprinkled the remaining parmesan cheese on top and broiled for about a minute, then added the parsley.  The potatoes were creamy on the inside and wonderfully crispy on the outside!  YUM!  Since my "mashing" skills are apparently not up to par, I will skip that entirely and just cut my potatoes into chunks.  Mashed or chunked give these a try!!!  UPDATE:  I made these again cutting my potatoes into chunks which was much easier for me.  Still tasted great!

This has got to be one of my top 3 recipes from this site. I LOVED these potatoes! I did not smash mine and used ground red pepper (cayanne) versus crushed due to preference in taste. They turned out FANTASTIC! I had scaled down the recipe because only 2 of us were going to eat these and I found myself wishing I would have just made the entire batch. OMG sooo Good! This would also be great as seasoned hashbrowns for breakfast.

A potential problem with this recipe is it's designed for 20 servings. I only wanted it for a simple weeknight meal to serve my family of four. I tried scaling it to 4 servings but that produced wonky measurements. 5 worked, though. I found that once I had smashed the potatoes, they fell apart, so tossing them in the cheese and spice mixture at that point was not going to work. I just  spread the mixture on the potatoes while they were on the baking sheet which was fiddly - it was hard to get it to do anything other than stay in little clumps. It would make more sense to me to just smash them, as indicated, on the baking sheet, drizzle the olive oil over (skipping the butter altogether), then sprinkle the cheese and spice mixture on top.

Absolutely Out-of-this-World Delicious! We had 10 for dinner this evening and every single person commented on how good these potatoes were! Followed the recipe with no alterations. These are so easy and extremely flavorful. Excellent. We will enjoy these again very soon. Thanks for sharing!!

Ok, first off I need to say I've made every recipe on the "Top 20" list...this deserves its place at the top! You can make the recipe as is, or follow the directions only adding whatever spices you want, just make sure you have enough to coat all the potatoes. I adjust the recipe according to how many potatoes I want to have, usually 1 pound. I didn't use the butter, just increased the olive oil. While my potatoes are boiling I mix up my olive oil and spices in a bowl. My favorite mix; basil, oregano, red pepper (or chili spice), tons of garlic and parmesan cheese. As another writer noted, I too, add some cheese on top at the very end and broil. When my potatoes are done parboiling (don't overcook-just enough to spear with a fork), I drain, smash slightly, and mix in a bowl with the olive oil mixture...spread on a cookie sheet, and bake. You can dress this recipe up by using white/red/purple small potatoes...BEAUTIFUL! THANKS for this recipe!!

My family loved these! Great aroma when baking and great flavor. I stuck to the recipe and had great results. I do agree with other reviewers to keep a light touch when flattening, my young daughter helped and my potatoes were really smooshed. I ended up pouring on the coating over the pieces that could not be tossed and even then still had great results.

These were so delicious and crispy, the smell when baking them in the oven really does make your mouth water. Before boiling, I cut the potatoes into cubes, lightly gave them a smash, coated them in the butter/oil and then added all the herbs. I only garnished with the parsley and left out the extra parm because I thought they were cheesy and awesome just how they were.

I made these potatoes last night for company. Everyone really liked them. I thought the seasoning might be too much, but it works really well with the Parmesan cheese. Everything crisps up nicely in the oven.  I did omit the rosemary for personal preference. My potatoes did seem to fall apart somewhat no matter how carefully I smashed them. I think next time I will quarter them and see how that works. Good, simple recipe.

I followed the recipe to the letter.  These were a huge hit with my kids.  This is a wonderful way to do new potatoes.  A hint:  Be gentle when smashing the potatoes.  I was overzealous and my potatoes fell apart.

Delicious!!!!  I made half the recipe and used 1 clove of fresh garlic as I didn't have any powdered. These potatoes turned out so good, can't wait to make them again.

I love make ahead recipes & this one is a real keeper. I mixed the cheese & spices the nigt before - in the morning, I boiled & smashed the potatoes so only had to cook for 30 min at dinnertime
I have to admit that I didn't get to taste these - they were all eaten by family members who raved over them! I had prepared a small amount without the cheese for my daughter who doesn't like Parmesan but she said "Next time, put it on everything. It's delicious" My grandkids loved the crunchies & the adults loved the entire recipe.

The best part of this is the burnt/encrusted parm cheese left on the bottom of the pannnnnn!! MMMMMMM.... greasy.


I used the bottom of the cup to "LIGHTLY" smash the potatoes. When I mixed in the butter mixture, some of the potatoes did mash together but I simply stuffed the rest of the slightly smashed potatoes with the really mashed ones... 

BADA BING, BADA BANG!

I didn't boil first. I baked, then flattened a bit and threw into the delicious mixture of spices. Put back into the oven for a few and bam. Great!

Used a mix. Smashed them gently after boiling and tossed in the olive oil mixture. Mixed the dry ingredients together and tossed with the potatoes. Sprinkled the excess over them before putting them in the oven. I turned them halfway through and they turned out very yummy. The secret is not to smash them flat, just enough for the oil and dry seasoning to get in the cracks and flavor the flesh of the potato.

UPDATE: MADE THESE AGAIN, AND THIS TIME I HAD NO PROBLEMS WHATSOEVER. I COOKED MY POTATOES FOR 20 MINUTES AND THEY WERE SOFT ENOUGH TO MASH (WITH THE BOTTOM OF A SMALL JUICE GLASS) WITHOUT TURNING TO MUSH. :) HAVING SAID THIS, I DID OPT TO NOT TOSS THEM FIRST. I JUST PLACED EACH POTATO ON MY BAKING SHEET AND GENTLY MASHED IT, THEN TOPPED WITH EVOO / BUTTER AND THEN WITH THE PARM AND SPICE BLEND. I DIDN'T FINISH WITH ADDITIONAL CHEESE AS I FELT IT WAS UNNECESSARY. WOW! SOOOOOO GOOD!!! These were alright. I'm not sure how much of my disappointment should be attributed to cook's error vs. poor instructions.... My potatoes were slightly tender / firm at the 15 minute mark, so I took them off the stove (I feared overcooking would turn them to mush as others have warned). BIG MISTAKE!!! I had to take my meat tenderizer (flat side) to mash my potatoes! This did the trick, but tore the skins right off! I didn't want to waste good ingredients (and needed a side to go with dinner), so I continued as directed. Not only were my potatoes very crisp, my skins burned! My observations are 3-fold: a) there is a FINE line between tender and firm - your potatoes will either be too firm to mash or so soft that they become mush, b) these need broth or water added during cooking to retain moisture and c) cooking for 30 minutes (at least without adding liquid) is FAR too long. These taste great (the spice blend is FABULOUS!), but the cooking method just doesn't work. Thanks anyways, CJ. :)

Oh my goodnes, these are WONDERFUL!  I made these for the second time last night and my family raved and raved about them.  My picky husband added them to his "favorites" list.  He asked me, "where does all that flavor come from?"  I like to smash them up really well so they get very crispy.  I followed the recipe except for adding a little less olive oil.  Yummy!  Thanks for posting!

These are definitely keepers.  My family loves PW's Crash Hot Potatoes, so when I saw these I knew I had to make them.  They are like PW's but with a kick.  These have the perfect amount of seasoning and spice.  I only made a half batch but should have made the whole recipe because the fam loved them.

These potatoes were fantastic! The smaller potatoes were easier to smash and were crunchier after they baked. Will definately being using this recipe often.

Very tasty potatoes, crispy crunchy on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside, it's a great side dish for a steak dinner.

These were DELICIOUS, and I made them in a lower-fat version, so I can only imagine how they would be full-fat! I cooked my potatoes and cut them into chunks (instead of smashing them) and placed them on a cookie sheet that was sprayed w/ non-stick spray. Then I drizzled over some EVOO and some light butter (maybe 1/4 cup total). I sprinkled on the spices and tossed to coat. I baked them, turning them every so often, until they were nice and crispy. They turned out great and my family raved over them~ a definate keeper! Thanks for sharing. :)

I try really hard to make as written, at least the first time, but I never have new potatoes but still wanted to make this.  So I used russets, peeled and cubed.  For smashing, I wasnt sure what to use.  I thought I had one of those flat round smasher things but I didnt see it, so I decided to go ahead and use a regular hand masher, I was just gentle.  I poured the mixture over the top and then stirred gently to coat.  The flavor was great.  I think they would be really yummy with bacon and sour cream or some sort of french onion dip all slathered around, don't ya think?  But I have been trying hard to not add all the extra stuff that drives up the calorie count and the cost.  I have been on a mission to see what the dishes cost me to make so I have been trying not to add all those other goodies.  And it is just fine without it also.  Thank you for sharing.

These were amazing. The only thing I did was cut the butter in half (my husband has a cholesterol issue) and cut the parmesan in half. Otherwise perfect.

Yum, yum and yum!  I loved these potatoes.  I only had about 4 pounds of potatoes, but made the same amount of coating.  Instead of smashing the potato, mixing into the coating and putting back onto the cookie sheet...I smashed them and then used my pastry brush to spread the coating over the potatoes.  I loved all the flavors and the red pepper flakes definitely add some heat.  I would suggest that if you aren't a big fan of heat, to decrease the amount of red pepper.  Loved roasting them, they were crispy on the outside and nice and soft in the inside.  I may also skip adding the additional parmesan cheese afterwards too, I think it had plenty in the coating.  Will definitely be making these again!

I cut the recipe in half; and I followed the recipe for seasonings. I didn't smash the potatoes. When I the potatoes were done I put them in the bowl I mixed the seasonings in and mixed all together and then spread them out on the baking sheet and baked until crispy! The smell was fabulous and the taste was great!

I saw potatoes made similar by Curtis Stone on take home chef so when I saw these I gave them a try. Let me just say they are excellent as is and if you're feeling a bit adventurous you can change them just about any way you want and they still came out wonderful!

Four and a half stars.  I made life a little easier by putting the olive oil and butter in a glass bowl, with 3 cloves diced garlic for flavor, and nuking until melted.  Then I gently lifted the smashed potatoes with a slotted spatula and dipped them in this mixture.  Once  on the lined and greased tray, I added the mixture of spices (good mix, only added fresh thyme as I happened to have some on hand).  I made these ahead for tonight's dinner, so I haven't yet tasted them (they smell divine), but I can tell they will be great.  Thanks for a great recipe, CJ.

I wasn't sure how to rate these potatoes. LOVE the method, but felt the seasonings just produced a mess, with no individual spices able to shine through. They just didn't sing. We had to stick them under the broiler for a few minutes to hurry them up, which turned out to be a good thing. Crispy outside, soft and tender inside, perfect texture. With fewer seasonings, this method will for sure replace my usual roasted potatoes, which sometimes come out too dry. Thanks for a great new way to roast potatoes!

One word summary: amazing. I used yukon gold potatoes and cut them into chunks instead of using baby reds. My entire family couldn't get enough of them. I'm glad I only cut it in half instead of down to 5 servings...we wouldn't have had enough! I used all olive oil instead of using butter. I also didn't put the parmesan on top before serving, just because I forgot. They were wonderfully crispy and flavorful. I WILL be making these again!

These are excellent! But not for the calorie-conscious! Used regular ole Idaho potatoes, because that's what I had on hand. Read through the reviews and, as suggested, combined all the seasoning and the oil and butter (more oil, less butter) first, then gently rolled the squished potatoes in this mixture before baking. I did oil my pan first, but truly I don't think you need to; it made the potatoes even "oilier" - however, they were nice and crispy on the bottom, probably because of the extra oil!

These are SOOOO GOOD!  I made them twice this weekend!  The first time, some of my potatoes came out overcooked and some came out undercooked, so the ones that came out undercooked ended up not "mashing" well, and the others were just falling apart.  We prefered the ones that were falling apart, they just seemed to soak up the flavors better.  Then Sunday I made them again, and instead of mashing I quartered the potatoes, and I think this works a bit better.  SO GOOD!  Will absolutely make again and again!

Loved these - so fun and different.  Very similar to the crash potato recipes I've tried, but so much better.  I minced probably 6-8 cloves of garlic and let it steep in the warm butter/olive oil while I boiled the potatoes.  Next time I will reduce the cooking time as they were almost too soft.  I used fresh basil and rosemary so upped those amounts.  Our company really enjoyed these with our grilled tri tip and wedge salads with blue cheese.  Will make often this summer -Thanks!!

came out perfect, I've seen some of the ppl had problems with the potatoes being too soft and falling apart after boiling so I cut the boiling time about 7 minutes, and it worked! Thank You for the recipe.

These were great.  The only thing was that we didn't think the spice mix was what it could be.  The potatoes were crispy outside and soft inside.  Presentation can't be faulted at all.  Will make these again, often, but will tweak the spices.  Maybe add some paprika and cayenne, up the garlic, drop the italian spices a bit.

These were absolutely awesome!  Made as stated.  The whole pan was gone in one meal.  Don't plan on leftovers unless it's just 2 people eating....::sigh:: Didn't even get the chance to take a picture.  Next time I will make these when no one is home so I can take a pic. - otherwise...they just don't have a chance of hanging around....

I didn't have new potatoes so just cubed some regular red potatoes and omitted the "smashing" part.  They turned out nice and crispy and flavourful.  It's a great blend of spices.  I made up extra to keep in the fridge.  It's good mixed with bread crumbs or for any recipe that calls for Parmesan cheese.  Very handy and delicious.  Thank you, CJ McD!

I loved these potatoes - I need to make them again soon.
they're fun to make and they come out crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  I used a mixture of red and white baby new potatoes.

While it may seem like a lot of seasoning, and it is, don’t skimp on any of the spices.  You’ll be rewarded with boldly flavored potatoes that are surprisingly scrumptious. These are one of my husband's favorites, garnering the coveted “It’s a Ten!” acclamation. Ok, I know the site only rates to 5 stars but he said what he said.  Be sure not to overcook the potatoes during the initial phase so they don't fall apart with gentle smashing.  To save on clean up, I put the potatoes in a casserole, pour the oil and butter mixture over the potatoes and turn to coat well before gently smashing.  I also used grated Parmesan from the plastic container for the spice mixture and added fresh grated Parmesan to the top of the potatoes during the last 5 minutes of baking.

Yummy! My daughter and I made these today for our husband's for Father's Day dinner. We had a toddler underfoot while the boys were out playing golf, so we didn't exactly measure everything out...but so simple and delicious! The Fathers were impressed. Will definitely make these often!

OMG I can't believe how good these potatoes are! I wish I could rate it higher than 5 stars. My husband couldn't get enough of them and my 2-year-old son who doesn't like potatoes ate them up! These will definitely be a favorite in my family. I followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't toss the potatoes with the spices. I did what other reviewers suggested and smashed the potatoes on the cookie sheet, then drizzled oil over them and sprinkled them with the spices, the turned them and sprinkled the spices on the other side. I turned them again half way through cooking. They turned out so nice! Crunchy on the outside and wonderfully creamy on the inside. They couldn't be more perfect.

Delicious! I used my crockpot and put the potatoes in water on HIGH for a couple hours until soft.  I then drained the potatoes and poured the butter/oil/spice sauce over and they were perfect!  I am going to heat them up for Easter dinner in my crockpot as well.

I thought these were great, just what I was looking for!  Everyone at the dinner party loved them.  I did end up broiling them at the end for a few minutes to make them just right crispy for serving. Other than that, followed the recipe to a T!  Great job on this mixture, thanks!

These were a nice change of pace and remind of The Pioneer Woman's Crash Hot Potatoes.  While I enjoyed the combination of herbs, I enjoy roasted potatoes just as much, w/out the extra step.  I apparently over boiled my potatoes and they mashed a bit as I was tossing them in the butter/EVOO/herbs (and I greatly decreased by butter and EVOO to reduce calories a bit).  While I will use this herb blend again, I probably will not use this preparation method again.  THANKS, CJ McD!

Pretty good, a bit much on the seasoning for my taste. If I make again, I'll probably leave out the oregano and rosemary at least. I used yellow potatoes, quartered, gently smashed them before tossing with the butter/olive oil/spice mixture, and it worked well.

These were OK but for me were too much work. It's just as easy to twice bake or mash them with the added seasonings and such.

These potatoes are fantastic.  I used the bottom of the pot I boiled these in to smash them.  Worked well!  I was worried that tossing these around in the oil mixture would make these fall apart so I arranged these on the baking sheet then carefully topped each one with some of the mixture.  This worked great!  We loved these!  Thanks ;)

I was so excited to try this after reading all of the rave reviews, but none of us really enjoyed it that much.  I did have to leave out the parmesan due to two family members with milk allergies, and I am sure that would have made it taste better, so I'm giving it 4 stars out of benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe as written and it was okay, but nowhere near the hit that oven baked fries or other similar dishes are with my family.  I'm glad I tried this, but I would not make it again.

yum! made half a recipe and it was really good. Used two bags of the "delicious white" potatoes that come in a bag (or whatever the white ones are called). had to split them between two pans to bake, but then we just got hot ones later in the meal so it worked well!

I left out the rosemary (personal preference) and used smaller amounts on some of the other spices.  I boiled my potatoes for 30 min and then brushed on the margarine and oil and mixed all the other spices together and sprinkled on top.  I put some foil down on my baking sheet and baked for 20 min flipping after 10.  After I added the parm and parsley I put it under the broiler for two min which I will not do the next time I make these.

A HUGE hit.  My husband kept popping these in his mouth before we sat down to eat and saying they were delicious.  I served these with "The Best Meatloaf" from this site.  He said it was awesome, a showing off good meal.  So this will definately go in our favorites recipe book and even use for guests.

I think mine needed more butter.  I substituted Italian seasoning packet and added mozzerella cheese right at the very end, it was good, but much better once I added a little butter.

AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!
I made these last night for dinner and they were a HUGE hit with the whole family. SO much flavor and so darn good! I followed the recipe as written except dipped in the oil/butter mix and then sprinkled with spices as some others suggested.
Will definately be making again, thanks!

I scaled this recipe to 5 servings and used dried parsley in lieu of fresh.  They were very, very good.  Next time I will try turning the potatoes halfway through baking, as my potatoes were barely brown on top but almost burnt on the bottom.  Easy, delicious recipe!  Thanks for sharing!

I scaled down this recipe for 4 but I should have doubled it! They were so good we were all fighting over the last of them. I didn't have any oregano so for the herbs I just used basil and italian seasoning because that what I had. I also didn't use the red pepper or the parsley but they were wonderful anyway!

I tweaked this recipe a bit.  I used red skin potatoes and cut them in fourths.  I followed the ingredient list however I used all fresh ingredients and cut the oil back to 1/4 cup.  It was more than enough.  I did sub soy Parmesan cheese for the dairy version.  I added some chopped jalapeno peppers and 3 rashers of diced bacon.  I roasted until potatoes were crispy.

My oh my oh my oh my!  These were delicious and will be served to my family with many meals to  come.  Made exactly as written with the exception of squooshing the potatoes. Instead, after 20 minutes in the boiling water, I let them cool a little and quartered them. Absolutely delicious! Thank you!

I struggled to cook the potatoes just right: they either wouldn't smash or were too mushy. But once you season them and stick them in the oven, it doesn't really matter. They still tasted great and made excellent leftovers

Excellent.  I had to use larger potatoes because that is all I had and they turned out great.  If you use larger potatoes, I recommend boiling them for an extra 5-10 minutes to make them easier to smash and then spooning the olive oil mixture onto the potatoes.

These are totally worth the work! I happened to have shaved parmesan instead of grated, and it made the most delicious little brown bits on the bottom of the pan. Our new favorite potato recipe!

What a tasty way to use little red potatoes.  Two things I have done after making this several times is..use a scraper such as Graham Kear's, it's the right size to smash the potatoes.....brush the spices and olive oil/butter mixture rather than disturbing them as they will keep their shape. Turn half-way through baking, and brush the other side, add extra cheese. They will brown and crisp nicely and are so delicious. Thank you for sharing this recipe.  Grandma Susie

I had am undetermined amount of cooked, cubed potatoes left over and this recipe happened to be in the Daily Dish email... LUCKY ME!... AND LUCKY MY FAMILY!... I estimated the potatoes I had to be a quarter of what I needed and 'eyeballed' the recipe down to a quarter of the original. I know I could have gotten 'exact' measurements if I changed the quantity of servings, but where's the fun in that ;) Put everything in a sealed container and shook. Eezy-peezy :) Even though my potatoes were cubed, even though I was out of both thyme and rosemary delicious, Delicious, DELICIOUS! Rave reviews from the husband and kids too :)

I use little miniature potatoes and cut them in half, did not have to mash them and it worked very well.  Awesome will make again.

These are a favorite of ours and I make them during the summer in a large, sealed,  foil pouch on the grill away from direct heat. Takes about 45 min. and gives them that campfire taste. Of course during the winter, it is in the oven for them. Very good eating.

My family loved this recipe! I made as directed, except I forgot thyme leaves. Next time I plan to cut the red pepper flakes to 1/2 tsp. The potatoes weren't spicy unless you bit into a piece that had a ton of seasoning on it... then it would set your mouth/esophagus on fire. These smell so delicious when baking as well! I also made about 4 lbs... still a TON of potatoes!

I will never make roasted potatoes any other way! These were great. I made as directed, and the only thing I would change is less crushed red pepper. It was a little spicy for me. I scaled the recipe down for 4 servings and it called for 1/8 teaspoon. Just a pinch next time should do it. Thanks for sharing an amazing recipe.

As my kids say "meh." These potatoes had the potential to be amazing, but just ended up being underseasoned, kind-of-roasted potatoes. Definitely needs more salt and the butter made them heavy without adding enough flavor to make it worth it. It's almost like these potatoes are trying too hard to be amazing--simple roasted potatoes would have been much more amazing without all the fuss.

These potatoes were delicious!   I only had baking potatoes so I cut them up before I cooked them.  Since I cut the potatoes I did not smash them.    Otherwise I followed the recipe.  Very tasty!

Freaking excellent.  I also divided everything by 4-5.  It turned out tasting fine.  I would leave it in the oven for slightly over 30 minutes so that all the potatos are crispy.

Made some changes since I didn't realize I had to boil the potatoes first. I just diced them and tossed them in the oil and seasonings and put them in the oven. SO GOOD! I eyeballed the seasonings since I didn't do a whole 5 lbs of potatoes. Great recipe though. Will try it again according to directions. Very yummy.

I guess I am in the minority here, but my family did not like this.  The parmesan cheese was extremely overwhelming.  Maybe if the parmesan was cut by 3/4th we would like it, but I probably won’t try it again to find out.

I have no idea what I did wrong but I had planned on grilling these but after boiling them they fell apart. I guess I boiled them too long! I ended up having to rough mash them and cooking in the oven. Best mess up ever! Even semi-mashed, they were crispy, excellent twist on potatoes!

Yummy potatoes. My son would not eat them this way, but he is picky. I keep on hand a dry spice mix from this site, Italian butter. Same spices minus the thyme so i used that. Thanks

Fantastic potatoes!!!  And I especially love the fact that I was able to scale this down to just 5 servings, and it still turned out delicious.  These may seem like they are time consuming or too much work, but they are actually very easy to make.  I only had large red potatoes, so I cut them up, boiled them, smashed them, added the seasonings and baked them.  My husband's first reaction was "these potatoes are awesome".  Will definately make many more times.  They were the perfect side dish to our hamburgers tonight, and would go so well with chicken, pork, or steak as well.  Thanks!!!

These were VERY good! I used baby red potatoes and used the bottom of a glass to smush them, they squished rather well.  Wasn't able to toss them with anything but took the advice of another reviewer and sprinkled on one side and then sprinkled on the other.  I also attempted to put them in the fridge over night and warm them when it was time to serve.  That would have worked if I had the for sight not to cook them on a foil lined pan!  They stuck to the foil! lol So these turned into more of a hash for me but everyone at the party I served them at, loved them and several asked for the recipe, so it worked out well! Thanks for the recipe... was tasty!

Yummy! My husband and kids loved them.  I didn't have baby potatoes so I used big ones cut into pieces, worked just fine.  I didn't have red pepper flakes so instead I omitted the garlic powder and used a garlic spice with dried peppers in it.  Didn't cut back on any spice, even though it seemed like a lot it was perfect once cooked.

I did quarter my potatoes since they were actually pretty large and only boiled them till fork tender, which only took 10 minutes. I'm glad I took the time to pre-boil and then bake because they are some of the best baked potatoes we've ever had. I eyeballed the spices and didn't use near the amount of cheese called for, just topped with the cheese the last five minutes of baking. My only complaint about this recipe it that I wished I'd tried it sooner.

Scaled it to 10 servings, and actually prepared the evening before and put them in the fridge until the next day. I then baked them at 400 for about an hour and they were excellent! Got rave reviews from our out of state visitors! Will definitely make again! !

TOO, TOO GOOD!!  Our adult children are all "foodies" and I used this recipe for a family celebration this evening (our youngest daughter was just promoted to weekend TV new anchor).  They were the guinea pigs and they took the bait, big-time.  All fresh herbs and fresh garlic were used (proportionally) rather than dried because the family prefers it.  Otherwise, the recipe was faithfully followed.  Simply delicious!  Wow, I've gotta rest now ... I ate waaaay too many of these wonderful potatoes.  Bada-Boom!

Great recipe! I used larger reds and boiled them a little longer. I used grated cheese in the sauce and topped the baked potatoes with shredded cheese. Instead of the individual herbs I used about 1 1/2 tablespoon of Italian seasoning. My husband loved these and hes not really into herbs. These are great and I will be adding this to my binder of recipes!

Made these for Easter dinner and what a perfect accompaniment to the ham!  Even those strange people who aren't big potato fans loved this.  Next time I will eliminate the red pepper (just my personal preference), but will certainly be making these again!

These were really stellar.  I used medium to med-large reds, because that is what I had on hand.  I may have cooked them a bit too long, because when I went to roll them in the butter sauce, they kind of broke apart.  But they were SO good and different and very flavorful!

Made these to go with steak and sauteed mushrooms. I didn't "squish" them enough so they didn't get as crispy as we would have liked but the flavor was spot on. Thank you for the recipe.

These potatoes were so good. My family and I really enjoyed these. Even my daughter who likes nothing loved these. The only thing I did different was microwave the potatoes instead of boiling them. I think next time I will flatten the potatoes out even more because we all seemed to go after the ones that were nice and crispy.

These have become my fam's favorite potato dish. I cut out a step and put them straight into the oven and they cook up just fine. Otherwise, I make exactly as stated in the recipe and the seasoning is great!

I made some potatoes similar to this, and my mom made these Bada Bing potatoes and told me to try them compared to my own. This recipe tastes AMAZING, however, I found some flavors to be a little too over powering and overall I found it to be too greasy as well as time consuming. I said before I had been making my own potatoes which I like to call Italian Scalloped Potatoes that taste almost exactly the same. Instead of boiling and then baking, the potatoes are thinly sliced and layered in a dish with sprinkled herbs and cheese between each layer, then drizzled the butter and oil mixture over the top. They only bake for about 40 minutes but are very well done and taste as far as I can tell, pretty much like this. Its our favorite dish to take to parties and potlucks! To see my version, just visit my profile.

I served this at a large family gathering to rave reviews.  A few modifications to make this easier, that may be helpful for others: I used a giant bulk-store can of white potatoes, 6.5 lbs, in place of new potatoes, and it worked great.  To even out the proportion of spices, I simply used rounded spoonfuls of the original specifications (tbsp, tsp, etc.) and kept the oil/butter/cheese constant -- even then, there was too much oil, I would reduce this next time.  After boiling the potatoes, I baked (instead of roasted) them in a metal disposable tin, which I prepared using layers of potatoes and spice/oil mixture. They turned out delicious, just too oily on the bottom -- the oiliness is what gives this recipe only 4 stars instead of 5!

This was very good and I will definitely make again!  I followed the recipe almost exactly, but cut down the thyme (personal preference) and also used cayenne instead of red pepper flakes.  It gave them a nice little zing.

We thought these were excellent. Use whatever method seems best to you of getting the butter and seasonings on. I do think that it's important to do the potatoes in this "shape" for best results though, having made several recipes like this I can honestly say that the way the smashed potato fries in its own oil all nice and flat like that is a vast improvement over cubed or french-fry cut potatoes. Thanks for sharing your recipe, I served this with t-bones and salads and not a bit left over.

Made these for the first time today.  Delicious!  Got rave reviews all around.  I didn't alter the recipe, but I did quarter the potatoes rather than smash them for ease of serving out of a sterno.  Will definitely make again.

I'm not sure how you can screw up this recipe.  Even cooking your potatoes a little too long does not ruin the flavor. Everyone loved them.  I think 15 minutes on the stove is long enough.  Although I did 20 and they were done and really didn't need any more time in the oven.  I did put them in the oven to see if they would crisp up a bit. I did 3 lbs of potatoes both new red and gold.  It served 10 people.  Cut the ing. a little to adjust to fewer potatoes. Really good...

My husband and I really liked these for a change of pace.  I followed the recipe with the exception of drizzling the olive oil, herb, cheese mixture over the potatoes instead of coating the potatoes in the mixture.  I will make these again.

very good!  Followed to a tee.  Second time, I was grilling outside and decided to finish them on the grill rather than in the oven.  I still kept them on the baking sheet with indirect heat.  They were great too -- no difference, other than it helped me keep an eye on them too.  Highly suggest trying this recipe for "something different" potato side dish.

My boyfriend refers to these as "The tasty smashed potatoes" and is always very pleased to see them on the dinner table. I've made them with parm and cheddar cheeses (depending on what I've got) and both were delicious.

Wow!  What a perfect name for these potatoes!  They are flavorful and spicy.  My sister loved these, I will make them again and serve them as a side.  What ever kind of potatoes you have on hand should work just fine.

Was very easy to make. I loved them, my husband not so much. I used could not find new potatoes so just bought the small red skinned ones and it turned out great.

This is a great cooking procedure that I'll be using again.The first time I made these, I followed the recipe except I did not use butter. The herb/cheese mixture closely resembled basil pesto which I like, but not on these potatoes, hence the three star. The second time, instead of using the herbs in the recipe, I used McCormack Italian Seasoning which is not overly heavy in any one herb. I didn't bother adding parsley or more cheese after cooking. 

I used a stainless dough scraper to smash the cooked potatoes which worked pretty well. They came out looking like Pac-Man characters.

These were simply delicious. Would not change a thing. I scaled the recipe down with no problems. My only problem will be not making these all the time and having the family get tired of eating them :)

Delish!  I sort of winged it with the seasoning I had on hand plus I had to scale it down quite a bit for just my mom and I.  When I tried to squash the potatoes they sort of fell apart so I just kind of broke them all up, stirred them all up with the other ingredients and then just made about 6 mounds on the baking sheet.  I sprayed them with PAM and baked as directed.  They were wonderful.  Easy to make, crispy and tasty.  Mom enjoyed them.

Maybe I made too many potatoes for the sauce, but the sauce should have been doubled with the potatoes I used which was 1/2 10 lb. bag. Had to add a lot of butter and much more cheese to get any flavor. Cute name though, but did not get my kids to like them. Hubby did, but he likes plain tasting potatoes.

These were good, but mine had a bit of an off taste to them ... could possibly have been potatoes or the fact that I made them early in the day and they sat in seasoning for a good 8 hours before cooking.  Will definately remake, but avoid letting marindae in mix so long.

These potatoes were great! They roasted up beautifully. In past reviews, there were complaints that smashing the potatoes and then mixing with the topping left a mess, but that was fine with me. It produced different sized pieces that cooked to different degrees. This is definitely a recipe that will be staying in my favourites folder!

Very flavorful!  I made these just as written except that I left out the olive oil and cooked and mashed the potatoes completely.  I felt that was easier than using the oven.

Pretty good!  I scaled the recipe down for 3 of us, only had Yukon gold potatoes, will try new potatoes next time.  Seemed like a lot of seasoning still, but came out just fine.  I cut the potatoes in large chunks because they were big.  But still boiled and lightly smashed them.  Also turned them all over about 20 mins through since the bottoms were browning faster than the tops.  Tasty!

These were so awesome.  Pretty much followed the recipe as written except I used fresh chopped garlic and sea salt.  Served with a dollop of sour cream which was a great compliment to all of the spices.  Can't wait to make them again!

I had purple new potatoes on hand and no shredded Parmesan cheese... just the grated stuff I usually put on pizza. Nonetheless, this recipe is AMAZING!  I was cooking for 2, thus I only used 2 pounds of potatoes. I added salt to the boiling water. So, they only took 10 minutes to soften. I baked them about 30 minutes, turning over at 15 minutes. My advice for the light potato mashing is to use a large spoon, but press gently, just till the skin splits open.  If you mess up, it’s ok. Toss it anyway with the rest!  Thanks for this wonderful recipe!  I love potatoes and this is a great way to enjoy them.

I made it with regular potatoes cut up, and did not ad the full complement of herbs because SOME picky person around my house said she could not eat all those herbs, and then loaded hers with onion and garlic and then STILL wouldn’t eat them.  I thought they were great, and next time I will make as listed (I loooove fresh herbs), and to heck with these other ‘s ‘food sensitivities ‘.  I’ll make what I like.  I thought these were cheesy delishousness .

I halved this recipe because there were only 7 people. The original recipient says 20 servings so I cut in half, it went so fast everyone loved it. The only thing I would change is maybe turning the potatoes half way through they were pretty well done on the bottom.

OH so good! I cut this recipe in half for six people and it was enough with leftovers for the next day. Followed the recipe to the T. This was a side dish, along with carrots, for Roast Pork Recipe by: Christine L. Will enjoy these again!

These are great. They are similar to a "smashed potato" dish served at a restaurant I like, but with more flavour. The squishing of the potatoes is key to the crispy texture.

This is the best potato recipe. My northern family loves it, my southern spouse and his family were skeptical, yet now request I make it for all gatherings. I find it takes awhile to get crispy I. The oven, so leave plenty of time. I also sometimes lessen the red pepper depending on who I'm serving. I don't always have new potatoes, but I've cut any potatoes I to chunks and it's been great all ways!

Just made for the 2nd time tonight...fresh herbs versus dried makes a world of difference! First time I used dried and they were still very good but this time even better.... Also the 1st time I made them I smashed a bit heavy handed but learned on the 2nd try not to smash so much but to crack the skin (using a spoon & lightly pushing down) enough to let all the goodness seep in. Smell and end result was great! Also on this go round I made the night before and covered in fridge and popped in oven next day and they were still perfect!

I made this recipe twice (once exactly as written & again last night using different potatoes). Both times I think this is a good recipe that's worth 4 out of 5 stars, meaning tasty in a basic I-have-all-the-ingredients-on-hand-&-it's-easy-enough-to-make kind of way. Yet it's not really spectacular enough to merit 5 stars for us (for us it's the kind of recipe where we'll devour the leftovers until we feel sick because it tastes so darn good we just gotta have more). Last night instead of using all new potatoes I used a medley of new potatoes along with mini red & purple potatoes because that's what I had on hand. I don't really think we can tell the difference by taste but visually the purple potatoes looked kinda strange & yucky in there so I'll stick to yellow/red only from now on. (I do like the look of the purple potatoes in potato salads, but not here.) I'll hang on to this recipe because I do like the seasonings & the amounts are spot on so I'll use it as an alternative to plain salted potatoes, tasty yet it didn't impress us enough to warrant more than 4 stars.

My guys love these potatoes. I always make sure to use freshly grated parmesan cheese. I steam the potatoes in the microwave for about 8 minutes to speed up the process, and then cook them at 425 for the 30 minutes. At our house, every minute counts. Regardless, great recipe. We use it often!

Amazingly good potatoes. Be careful not to smash them too far. It's easy to do that if they are still firm as the recipe calls for before smashing. I did not use the oregano, basil or parmesan just because of what I was making with them but this is a really fine recipe that could easily be amended with different herbs and cheeses. Heck even bacon bits or bits of onion would be really good.

Bada bing, indeed! These were very good! I ran out of evoo and ended up using butter. It was still good! I cut the boiling time by 7 minutes as suggested and they very soft. I cut the roast time by 9 minutes, when I took them out, they were too soft so I allowed them to roast for the remaining 9 minutes and they were great! So don't boil them for too long but roast them as written. Thanks for submitting!

Really loved these potatoes. I did cut the recipe to 8 servings and they were very flavorful. I had to use russet potatoes and they came out good, but next time I'll make sure to have the new potatoes.

I made this for a dinner with friends who had 4 kids. They loved this so much! I did smash them more than most, but the kids liked that. I did not include the rosemary as that can be overpowering. We used shredded parmasean instead of grated so it became a bit crispy which was wonderful. Will make this again.

These were amazing! I didn't parboil before, just cubed them and popped them in the oven to cook for about 40 min. They were so flavorful, and a recipe I will definitely repeat many times. Thanks for sharing.

These were really good. When making the olive oil mixture with all the seasonings I was really skeptical when I put the oregano in. It smelled way too strong and not a pleasant smell either. I even debated on whether or not to throw the whole mixture out and start over again without the oregano, but I didnt because of all the good reviews. And I was very pleased with how they turned out. Not too strong at all and the aroma when cooking was wonderful. I didn't have any rosemary on hand so I subbed that with some garlic powder. I also didn't have any Parmesan cheese, so I used shredded cheddar instead. I also cut the potatoes into round slices (like potato chips) and then dipped one by one in the olive oil mixture. Then I took a little of the cheese from the olive oil mixture and placed it on top of the potatoes before baking. I forgot to add the parsley but I'm sure it would have made them taste even better.

I made these tonight, very tasty!  I was hoping for a little more zing as I followed the recipe.. so I will alter it next time and add more cheese and garlic.  Very good with my quiche and salad tonight.  Thanks CJ!
