This recipe turned out terrific. It has a lot of depth, is savory and delicious! The whole family loved it. I fried everything in a pan and then transferred the ingredients in a slow cooker to finish. I used stewing beef. Instead of using five spice I used 1 teaspoon of a blend of 3 spices (star anise, fennel and coriander). I put the lemongrass in the food processor so it blended in with the stew and added mixed vegetables instead of just carrots. I did not add extra water since there was plenty from the canned tomato. I realized after we ate that I forgot to add ginger-which I will put into the stew next time I give this recipe a try. Thank you for sharing this recipe. It will be a new staple for our family.
