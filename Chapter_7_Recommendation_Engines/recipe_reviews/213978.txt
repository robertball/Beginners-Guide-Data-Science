I didn't find these to be anything special.  I thought they would be more caramel-y, but they basically tasted pretty much like classic rice krispie bars.

Good though I didn't find them to be much better than regular rice krispy treats.  I added about a half of a cup of M and M's and drizzled some extra caramel on the top.
