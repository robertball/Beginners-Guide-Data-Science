I didn't really understand this recipe. For example, I  didn't see the point of baking it in the oven -- the eggs are precooked, the tuna is canned, etc.  Why bake at 350?

I also think more effort should be made to thicken the sauce -- 2 cups of milk heated and stirred for 3 minutes gives 3 cups of hot milk.  The end result is a very hot, runny and fairly colorless liquid soup with tuna, eggs, etc.    

If I were to do this again, I'd begin with a bechamel sauce and add cream or whole milk a few tablespoons at a time if needed.  I'd also skip baking it in the oven.

I LOVED this recipe, not too hard to cook and tastes great. The kids and I could eat this seven nights a week.

This was absolutely not good.  It was OK, but far from being good.  I've made simular dishes like this one, but this one is at the bottom of those prior.

Great family filler.  Great for those of us that are conscious of needing one more fish meal per week.  I added spanish onion and fresh asparagus to the mix before putting in the oven and served with salad not pasta.

This was a great Sunday evening filler after a big lunch. The sauce did need more flour to thicken and I added more cheese and, it's probably sacriledge but I left out the egg. Both me and my husband really enjoyed it especially with the crunchy stringy top created by putting it in the oven.

This was okay, nothing "knock your socks off", or horrible.  Fairly bland and mushy.  Added mixed veggies for color and flavor/texture.  Don't really think it's worth the time or effort, but it was edible.  Probably won't make again.

Edible, but not great.
