Simple recipe to use up my chicken livers left over from processing our chickens.  My dogs will do anything for these treats.  High motivation treat for our foster dogs. Thanks for the recipe have made 3 batches and love healthy treats my dogs can have.

Didnâ€™t stink my kitchen up to much and all three of my dogs think they are AMAZING!!!  I cut them small and stuck them in the dehydrator for a small crunchy treat.
