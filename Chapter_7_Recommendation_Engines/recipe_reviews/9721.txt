I took an Italian cookie making class years ago, and the lady teaching it taught us to make the filling days ahead of the cookies.  Then, place the filling (half full) into zip top baggies, flatten, and freeze/refrigerate.  When you are ready to make the cookies, slice open the sides of the baggie, and cut strips of filling with a long straight knife.  It is then extremely easy to place the strips of filling on the rolled out dough that can be cut with a pizza cutter.

Very tasty. I was trying to replicate a family favorite with this recipe and although it wasn't the same I have to say I think it was better. The rum gave it a nice kick and my husband ate the whole batch in 2 days!!
I tried various ways of "stuffing" the cookie and found doing it as a pinwheel was the best (looks pretty too!). Roll out a rectangle of dough, spread fig mix over entire rectangle, roll into a log, put in fridge for 30 min, slice into 1/4" cookies. Bake at 400 until golden brown.

These cookies were amazing, one of the best stuffed cookies I`ve ever eaten. I didn`t use 1/2 cup rum, just a few tablespoons and I used 1/2 cup honey.

I make these every Christmas for my Italian in-laws. One year my mother in-law and sister in-law used recipes similar to this one, but ended up liking this recipe the best and asked for the recipe. :) I found that making the dough and filling a day before made it easier to form the cookies. I also add the filling in the middle of the whole strip of dough, pinch the edges together, and lightly roll it to smooth the pinched edges out.

I dont know why everyone gave this recipe a good rating, it calls for wayyyyyyyyy to much butter and when you eat them it tastes like your eating a bar of butter.

Very good! I added more milk and an egg to the breading mixture to firm it up more. I then refrigerated it for an hour and rolled it out before pouring the fig mixture onto it and putting half of the breading on the top and baking it as directed. They came out very well this way!

These cookies are terrific!  The only thing that I did differently was to leave out the rum and added a few T of water and milk instead.  They are delightful!

Christmas tradition, the only recipe I use!  I am not a fan of rum (except in a pina colada) so I don't add it.  I make sure to use every bit of the orange peel and squeeze the orange juice out. That hint of orange when you bite into it is just wonderful! I keep the fruit mixture in the fridge for a few days to let the flavor ripen!! It can be a little challenging to make but let me tell you, they are worth every minute of your time!! Who wants to pay over $19.00 plus in a bakery and you get a lot more!!! One year my heart wasn't in to making them, I bought them at an Italian specialty store, I paid $25.00 and ended throwing them out, they were awful. Now I make them every Christmas in honor of MY MOM!!!

Cookies are quite good but I used Crisco instead of butter to make them more like my grandma's. I thought there would be too much honey but the filling was a bit bitter after only 1/2 cup so I added the other half cup.  Only used a rounded cup of walnuts.  I had 1/2 cup of filling left after filling them as full as possible. Dough is very moist, I used some flour and rolled between wax paper.  I would suggest looking at the directions and rewriting because they are not clear regarding rolling and filling.  I would have been very confused if I hadn't help make them as a child.

My filling was way too runny, so I couldn't get the dough to form proper rectangles. So I made them into these mini-loaf shaped rolls. Am thinking about pouring the rest of the filling over them and freezing it into a dessert with ice cream. Update on 4/8/16: This time made the filling and dough a couple of days ahead. Didn't have a problem with consistency of filling. I followed the suggestion of one of the reviewers and shaped it into filled logs and cut out 1/2 inch thick pinwheels ... very pretty! Update on 29/8/16 - I love playing around with this recipe! used dates instead of figs, the filling was stickier and sweeter than earlier ones. shaped them into little logs this time. A five star result as always.

I enjoyed the cookies but they spread filling on the cookie sheets and were very messy to make.  The flavor was spectacular but they were not as pretty as the picture.  Intense to make.

The filling was great.  I added a small, chopped apple.  I did not care for the dough.   It wasn't like the traditional recipe that I am used to.  I also found the cook time & temperature and dough/filling ratio to be off.   The first batch burnt on bottom.  I bumped the temp down to 375 degrees for 12 minutes and they were a perfect golden brown.  I did run out of dough so I used my old dough recipe with the filling from this recipe and they were PERFECT! The dough/filling ratio may have been off a little bc I added the apple, but I had A LOT of filling left over.  Enough to make another 18 cookies.
