Exactly what I had hoped it would be, thank you! My only change (ingredient wise) was that the diced tomatos had basil, oregano and garlic already mixed in which added fantastic flavor! I opted to saute the garlic, a little more celery and little less onion, browned the beef and simmered all together on the stovetop. (My microwave tends to go on the fritz so I prefer the stovetop.) Before serving I sprinkled a bit of parmesan cheese on the top. Fabulous.

I"m giving this 5 stars because I, myself, made a couple of goofs. I did an "oops" with the cayenne pepper, which doesn't bother my family much, and the tomato sauce I had were 8oz cans so I felt like it could have been better with a little more tomato sauce. Oh, since I made it on my stove, I sauteed the onions & celery. Then browned the ground beef. Then added it all together in a large skillet and let it simmer a few minutes. It was good and I will be making it again . Thanks!

Great!  The only thing that was not so tasty was the caraway, which I will omit in the future.  The caraway overpowers the taste of the recipe.

Not the fanciest meal out there but very good nonetheless. I omitted the celery, sugar, paprika, caraway seed and cayenne and added in black pepper, tomato paste, garlic powder, extra can of tomatoes and basil. I had about 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef. I cooked this on the stovetop, not in the microwave.

Made this on the stovetop, and it was tasty--only omitted the caraway because my family doesn't like the taste.  I know microwaves are convenient, but cooking in them diminishes the nutritionial value of your foods.

Very good! I made it on the stove like other viewers and it was still just as easy. LOVE the paprika - it's what so many other recipes are missing. I also omitted the caraway seed - no one in our family is a fan. Can't wait to eat leftovers.

This was indeed the goulash I grew up with. My mother passed away, suddenly, 4 years ago and I have been trying to recreate this since then. The only thing I remember my mother adding was Worcestershire Sauce and instant beef bullion. THanks for all your work on this recipe I will treasure it forever.

This was delicious! The only change I made is that I could only find a 15 oz tomato sauce and that was fine because I had 1.1 lbs of ground beef. Turned out perfect in the microwave and I didn't change the seasonings at all.

This is good, basic comfort food. My husband inhaled it! I made it on the stovetop. My changes: green bell pepper instead of celery, no caraway or cayenne, a can of fire-roasted diced tomatoes instead of regular, 1/2 tsp of mexican oregano because its what I have on hand and its stronger in flavor. This is going into my regular recipe rotation.

I made this recipe last night and added fresh mushrooms that I needed to use before they went bad and instead of diced tomatoes I used crushed tomatoes because that's what I had in my pantry.  I was totally excited with the results!!  This is an easy, quick recipe.  I cook for 100 people several times a  year and I'm going to add this recipe!  Thank you for sharing!!

This is very good.  I omitted the caraway as well, halved the sugar, and added a can of rinsed kidney beans (old Weight Watchers habit). Also cooked it on the stovetop.

The recipe looked easy so I decided to try it.  I cooked it on the stove instead of the microwave because I am not a fan of foods cooked in the microwave.  I did away with the caraway seeds because I don't like the flavor.  Shells were used instead of elbows and added a little more bite with the cayenne pepper. I added a little more tomato sauce and I am glad I did since the shells drank it in.  It has a good taste.  My family loved it and I am sure that I will make it again soon.

This was really great and easy to put together!  I made it on the stove top b/c my microwave isn't the best, but it STILL turned out great!  Topped w/some mozzarella cheese - will definitely keep in my recipe rotation this fall/winter.

this was ok. i served it with homemade corn bread but my boyfriend thought it was terrible. it might be because he has always had authentic polish goulash his whole life and this is nothing like that. to make it more like a stew i added water, diced potatoes, and carrots. serving it with sour cream made me like it a lot more.

This was very tasty! This is the best tasting american/midwest goulash we've eaten. I browned the meat in a skillet and used dried minced onion (almost 2T worth) but did the rest in the microwave. Definitely a keeper. Thanks for sharing your recipe Terry!

This was a real hit with my family. The only thing is be careful with the pepper. A little goes a long way. We will probably take that part right out. So much better then my mom made growing up.

I have made this several times for my family and they love it. I have added and left out things and it always turns out great. I make the whole thing on the stove top instead of the microwave.

I was looking for the goulash that my mother made and this was close.  I made it without caraway seeds, added a small can of tomato paste.  I'm almost positive that my mother made it with brown sugar and only used tomato SOUP (Cambell's).  Next time, I'll make a few changes.  I also made it on the stove top because I had the time.

I've been trying to make goulash for years and it's always been bland.  This was yummy!  (cooked it on the stove vs mircowave and substituted ground cumin for caraway seed as I didn't have any on hand)

This is good but I would have left the caraway seeds out (personal preference). I made a few changes...I used 1/2 sirloin and 1/2 jimmy dean hot sausage. I increased the oregano to hide the taste of the caraway seed.  I cooked it on the stovetop also and used the whole can of tomato sauce. I also used 1 can of tomato's with green chili's instead of just tomato's

This is a really good recipe--it's simple, economical, and requires only a minimum of cookware to prepare.  It used basic ingredients I already had on hand, and the combination of spices made it very tasty.  I like the fact that it uses pasta to help stretch a pound of ground beef.  I think it would be very flexible, too--you could add a can of vegetables, or beans, or whatever you have on hand that strikes your fancy.  The only minor adjustments I made were the cooking times:  I cooked the ground beef and chopped veggies for a total of 8 minutes on High; the sauce for 15 minutes on power level 8; and after adding the macaroni, I heated it for 5 minutes on High.  I served it sprinkled with Parmesan and a side of garlic bread.

Delicious - My husband especially loves this.  We find it is even tastier when reheated the next day.  I, like other reviewers, don't use the microwave but make this on the stovetop.

Without the macaroni this also makes a delicious topping for baked potatoes.  Put a dollop of sour cream and some chopped parsley on top.

I made this on the stovetop instead of microwave. I did not have any caraway seed in my cabinet so that was left out. Regardless, this was a good tasty goulash...the comfort food recipe I was looking for. Thank you.

This was good, though more time consuming than I anticipated. I will make it again. It made way more than 6 servings, which was great for leftovers. The next day I added some garlic salt, grated parmesean and a little water (mine was not very saucy) before heating it all up over the stovetop.  This dressed up the flavor somewhat.

This recipe was a great, quick dinner for my daughter and I one random night. I did put it all together on my stove top, and as a vegetarian, I omitted the beef along with 1/2 can of tomato sauce. It bridged the gap that has always existed between my childhood ideals of my mom's salty goulash and my friend's mom's sweet goulash. And I might try to add a couple traditional goulash veggies--whatever those are--next time.

This was very good.  My husband even had seconds.  I used penne pasta and omitted the caraway seeds.  I add a can of kidney beans and chopped up some frozen mixed bell peppers that I had. When I served it, I added some Parmesan cheese.  I am looking forward to having the left overs for lunch this week.

Used fennel instead of caraway for a sausage flavor, and splenda instead of sugar.  Turned out a nice slightly sweet, spicy dish that will definitely become a regular.  served with saute'd zuchini and onions and a nice whole grain bread roll.

We enjoyed this item, but I cooked it on the stovetop and left out the caraway seeds because I didn't have any.  I used more tomatoes and sauce than asked because we like a saucy pasta.  I also used pennini pasta instead of macaroni for a change.  Enjoy!

Excellent quick-fix meal, with lots of leftovers.  Like most of the other reviewers, I made this on the stovetop and left out the caraway seeds.  I also substituted a can of tomato soup for the sauce because that was what was in the cupboard.  My husband loved it, but it was a little too sweet for me - next time I'll cut back on the sugar and use smoked paprika instead of sweet.  Yum!

Excellent dish!  I am not fond of microwave cooking, so I assembled the dish and popped it in the oven for 45 minutes at 350 degrees.

I left out the caraway seed and oregano, and used one can Rotel tomatoes (mexican flavor tomatoes with chilis) and one can fat free cream of mushroom soup instead of the tomato sauce.  I felt that much tomato would be a bit overwhelming.  Instead of the onions and celery, I substituted a bag of frozen "fajita blend" veggies (red & green bell pepper and onion), because that is what I had on hand. I quickly sauteed' these and poured off the residual fluid.  Worked out beautifully and gave it a really great flavor.  I also used whole wheat elbow macaroni instead of what was called for.

Before I put it in the oven, I sprinkled the top with low fat shredded cheese and covered with foil.  Super simple and super good!
