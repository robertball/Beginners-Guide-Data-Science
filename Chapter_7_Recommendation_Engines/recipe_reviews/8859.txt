Simmer all together, stirring regularly til thickened. Toss in with the noodles. Enjoy! It is wonderful!!

Absolutely wonderful.  My husband and I loved this!  Even while it was cooking, he danced around the kitchen in anticipation, b/c it smelled fabulous.  I added a bit more teriyaki sauce than the recipe called for - just to coat the noodles more thoroughly - and it was delicious.  Thanks so much for this recipe.  I will definitely make it again!

Very Nice! A simple basic chicken noodle stir fry, i cooked it for myself (1 serving) for lunch and it went down a treat. I think that with these adaptions, this would be perfect:  1. Use more oil, otherwise there is not enough oil to cook the chicken and vegetables properly  2. At stage 2, you should cook the vegetables for 5 minutes- not 2.! At 2 minutes, the onions and broccoli are still basically raw! You also do not have to cover the skillet/wok. If you use enough oil, and stir fry properly- you will get cooked, and flavourful meat and veg.  3. You can't add the noodles completely dried- They should be cooked or if using thin noodles- at least soaked. Otherwise the noodles will not cook correctly. You should add the partially cooked noodles, a little bit of water, DOUBLE the teriyaki sauce and stir fry for 2 more minutes, and then the dish is ready.  Some advice there. This is a lovely recipe enjoy!!!

If you want delicious Teriyaki, use Trader Joe's version--loaded with flavor (garlic, ginger, etc.).  The person who complained about this being spicy must have had a high salt teriyaki--there isn't any flavor of salt in the recipe, itself. What is missing is specific indication of what kind of "Chinese Noodles" to use.  Ramen is NOT, in my opinion, a good choice! I used 1/2 rice vermicelli & 1/2 bean vermicelli asian noodles--soaked briefly to soften & then let the steam cook them to clear.  Also, cut chix to long strips first (best for family).  VERY GOOD!

This is my favorite recipe.  I love pancit noodles.  Mine turned out ok but I think I should've let the noodles get softer.  I usually make enough to take left overs to work.

Yum!  I made this one vegetarian so I omitted the meat.  I also used the teriyaki sauce from the Baked Teriyaki recipe (doubled) on this site.  I used 5 packets of ramen noodles, cooked them and drained them.  I sauteed the snow peas, 2 cans of baby corn, and carrots. I threw the noodles in and added the sauce.  SOOOOOOO GOOOD!  thanks!

This recipe couldn't have been any easier or quicker with the help of frozen stir fry vegies and leftover barbeque. I actually cut the meat off of the spareribs we had Sunday night and it was great. I used the cheapy (20 cents a pack) Ramen noodles, boiled them up and then threw them into the mix. With the addition of garlic and onion powders, black pepper and a bit of red pepper flakes this dish was so very tasty. Wonderful hot summer evening dinner that my family practically inhaled. Thanks Sylvia!

My husband loved this so much he even ate the veggies and he's not a veggie eater!  so i was thrilled of course. my 3 yr old son loved it as well. I made my own teriyaki sauce (so simple).  The one thing, which isn't a complaint on the recipe itself, is this says it's only 4 serving but it's more like 8 or more.  I was eating this for lunch for days after I made it, so if you have a medium or small size family definitely cut the amounts down by about half.  Also, do yourself a favor and cook the noodles before adding it in

Quick, easy, healthy dish.  Lacking in flavor, but I would make it again as I really enjoy any kind of noodles or stir fry.  Might try a lot more teriyaki sauce next time or maybe even add some flour to thicken it.

This was horrible!  The noodles had a funny not quite cooked taste, the sauce was too salty and had hardly any flavour. There are too many good recipes on this site to bother trying to improve this one. Will not be making again.

Have made this several times now and even though I don't like it when someone modifies a recipe then posts a comment, I wanted to post my spin on this delish dish. The five star rating is because  I followed the recipe ALMOST as written... except...  I used chicken tenders and a ginger vinaigrette dressing I found on Epicurious instead of the teriyaki sauce.  A local pub in my hometown serves a warm asian noodle dish using the ginger vinaigrette and I was on a mission to replicate their dish.  I did pre-cook the noodles first then pan fried the chicken tenders in sesame oil, removed the chicken and cooked the broccoli, onion, snow pea pods, mushrooms and carrots for approx. 5 mins.  I did cover the skillet to steam the veggies then added back the chicken, noodles and dressing.  Stir all together and enjoy.  I recommend trying the ginger garlic vinaigrette dressing if you are not a teriyaki fan.  Great one-pan dish. Yummmm!

LOVED this recipe although I used only the vegetables that I had on hand.. green onions, mushrooms, green peppers, cabbage and carrots. I made the homemade teriyaki sauce the one reviewer gave. (It was fantastic!) I did add some chicken broth, garlic and ginger also. It was GREAT!

Mmm, this is so good. I prepared regular spaghetti (broken in half) instead of the recommended noodles. What really makes this recipe is the sauce -- I used the version suggested in the first review. Doubled the sauce recipe (I used more veggies than called for) and waited long enough for it to thicken, and it was delicious.

This was okay... I gave it 4 stars because I think a large part of the okay-ness was our brand of teriyaki sauce, so I'm going to have to try this again with a different sauce.

My dad made this for me and it was DELICIOUS! I'll definetely have him make it again. He ended up adding a little more teriyaki sauce and noodles- and it tasted great and as if it was from a chinese restaurant. You should really try this!

this tastes like moo goo gai pan.  It was quick to assemble and was flavorful.  I would make it again.

Update - I definitely would cook the noodles - it has been a long time since we made it last - but I think that is a key missing step (11/2009)

This was really good.  I made this as a side dish and left out the chicken.  I did use angel hair pasta and I made my own teriyaki sauce to use.  It was a great side dish served along with a asian/chinese meal.  It also would be good adding in some scrambled eggs.  Thanks for this great recipe!  I will for sure make again!

We live in a small town and finding some things, like chinese noodles, can be hit or miss depending on the grocery store at the time. Since we didnt have any I used wheat spaghetti instead. Broiled the chicken then added it to the veggies, it was delicious, so quick and easy. My 2 year old even ate the broccoli from this!

This was really good for such a simple dish. I used fresh broccoli carrots one onion and frozen peas. I added a can of bamboo shoots. I also added some green onion on top. I didn't buy the chinese noodles they were almost 3 dollars, so I just used spaghetti. Nice easy dish for a weeknight meal.

Not impressed with this recipe.  I kept adding teriyaki sauce to give the recipe some flavor.  I finally put in a cup!  It tastes pretty bland, but the veggies are good.  Just not very inspired.

This was great! I used ramen noodles and cooked them slightly but did not use the seasoning. I added minced garlic and fresh ginger and used the homemade teriyaki sauce another reader suggested. My kids loved it. Even my VERY picky 4 yr old tried the noodles and broccoli! I will make this again very soon.

Very good recipe although it lacked strong flavor.  I read a few of the reviews before I cooked it and I added 1/2 cup teriyaki instead of 1/4 cup and some 99% fat free chicken broth.  Still very bland.  I also added 1 cup mushrooms.  I would make this again with more teriyaki sauce and possibly some bouillon.

This was a great dish, I think next time  will try making my own sauce as the store bought was a little too sweet.  I also have already bought some stirfry beef and I am going to tr it with tha next.  I used all different kinds of veggies (broccoli, carrots, red&green peppers, pea pods, mushrooms) and found some stirfry noodles in the Oriental section of the grocery store.  Everyone liked it and it was quick and easy to make.

Very quick. Used the homemade sauce recipe from another reviewer, used preprepared frozen stir fry veggies and we had dinner in 15 minutes.

When I make this dish I use the teriyaki sauce from the Baked Teriyaki Chicken recipe on this site.  It turns out great!  The only issue is finding the "perfect" noodles to serve with it.  I'm still searching for my favorite.

Came out great! Better than I expected. Definitely recommend cooking your Chinese noodles about 2 minutes, to retain firmness. Combined Trader Joe's San Soyaki with a bit if sweet chilli sauce and a few touches of Sriracha.

Very simple and quick meal.   I steamed everything, chicken seperate from the vegatables and the flavor was wonderful.   I returned to the pan for a very quick brown and was able to get by with just a spray of Pam instead of the vegatable oil.   I skipped the Chinese noodles and served with Lo Mein instead.

My whole family loved this. I had to substitute frozen green beans for the broccoli and snow peas. I also had to make my own teriyaki sauce. Used 3T. soy sauce, 2T. rice oil and 1t. dried ginger. Turned out great with no leftovers even though I doubled everything.

If I ever make this again I will cook the noodles before I add them to the pot with everything else.  I had a terrible time getting the noodles to cook by following the recipe and I ended up adding a lot of different liquids which probably completely changed the intended flavor and it ended up horrible.

This was awesome! I would definatly make it again, but next time with a non-stick pan. I didnt have snow peas, so i used asparagus instead and it worked out great!  *The advice given from other reviews to use more teriyaki sauce was helpful.

My husband and I both loved this! He loves all asian-inspired food, so this was right up his ally. I'm a little harder to please. Needless to say, this one satisfied both of us. The only thing I'll do differently next time is to cook the noodles separately (I used Ramen noodles) to save time. I'm all about quick meals!

This was actually pretty good considering the simplicity of this recipe. I really thought i would have to add more than teriyaki sauce to it but i didnt. I used fresh chinese canton noodles which are really good. I will continue to look for other noodle recipes but keep this one in mind as well.

We liked this recipe quite a bit.  It wasn't awesome or anything, but I will make it again.  I used ramen noodles and cooked them first before adding them to the stir fry.  I also left out the carrot and added a can of baby corn.  Added some garlic and extra teriyaki sauce.  It's a keeper just for the simplicity and good (although not great) flavor.

I made the teriyaki sauce suggested by LINDSXLT4X4 and we totally enjoyed the vegetables and chicken with the sauce. But the noodles I prepared were a disaster. I soaked the noodles for 45 minutes in warm water (as directed on the package), drained them and added to the pan. The noodles never did soften up and were like eating plastic. We loved the flavor of the dish and I'll try again with a different noodle.

This was ok. Everyone ate it but I don't think I'll make it again. Maybe it's a personal preference not to have such a sweet sauce on my noodles with veggies. I did make the recommended homemade teriyaki sauce.

Easy and quick. Couldn't find dry Chinese noodles  so used pre-cooked/pre-packaged . I'm sure spaghetti would be just fine, too.

This recipe was very good and easy to make.  We added carrots, broccoli, snow peas, baby corn, and onions.  We also used the thin celaphane noodles and soaked them in water for 14 minutes and then mixed everything together as the recipe called for.

Ok, I thought the sauce was missing something.  I added several different vegetables, like cabbage and mushrooms.  It was bland and needed some extra zip.  I tried adding some oyster sauce, but it just didn't help that much.

I agree with "Shortcake" - easy to prepare but lacks flavor.  I didn't have any snow peas on hand and used linguine. Will add garlic next time.

Tasted great!!! I made this as is, except with low sodium teriyaki sauce, which still tasted great! I even mixed in the dry chinese noodles at the end as stated and it worked out really well.  My only complaint is that it wasnt till after i bought the noodles that i realized there was trans fat in the noodles!!!!!BIG NO NO. Next time ill try to find chinese noodles without trans fat, if i cant, then ill try soba noodles...love those!

Very good, but if using ramen noodles, cook them separately.  They won't cook up well mixed in the dish, and you'll overcook the chicken.

Fantastic family meal! My 3 year old said, "Now that's what I'm talking about!" I had to cook the noodles on the side and then add them in at the end, but other than that followed the recipe exactly.

Very easy and healthy recipe!  I used the sauce I had already made using the "Teriyaki Sauce and Marinade" recipe on this site.  (Great sauce!)  I diced the chicken and marinated it the sauce for about 1/2 hour.  Then I cooked the chicken, sauce and all, added some frozen stir-fry veggies, added the noodles and I was done!  I couldn't find Chinese noodles at my store, but I had some angel hair pasta in my pantry and used that instead (cooked then added to the chicken and veggies).  This would also be great served over rice.

This was absolutely delicious! I cooked ramen noodles in the mircrowave, then added them to the chicken and veggies when I poured in the teriyaki (used a little more than 1/4 cup too). I will definately be making this again! Yummy!

Absolutely sensational!  I used the veggies I had on-hand--squash, carrots, onions and broccoli--and narrow egg noodles (cooked before adding to pan)... I also added some seseme oil at the very end ... oh, and the homemade teryaki at the beginning of the reviews is marvelous ... it makes more than enough to have some left to use at the table, if you like ... absolutely wonderful!  Thanks to both!  :)

This was very good. I used oriental style frozen steamer vegetables. It helped to cut back on preparation time. I omitted the chinese noodles all together. I was afraid that they would not cook thoroughly. The outcome was wonderful. I then served chicken and vegtables on a bed of coconut rice.

This recipe was pretty good, though I did change a few things.  I only had onions, carrots, and green peppers in the house, so I used those.  I also used egg noodles and boiled them instead of doing it how the recipe said.  It turned out great.  No complaints from anyone!

We used different vegetables (broccoli, mushrooms, green beans & onions).  The only other deviation was 1/4tsp. chili garlic sauce for a little spice.  We used cellophane noodles – which weren’t mushy or underdone, as other reviews have mentioned.  Wegman’s has them in their Asian section. We followed the teriyaki sauce recipe from this site – also very good.

This was the first time I cooked noodles this way and they turned out a little sticky.  I would add a little more liquid next time.  I also threw in some celery and I used pre-cooked chicken from legs, because it was cheaper.  Very tasty and will definitely make it again!

How are you supposed to cook the noodles without liquid? I made this in my wok which does not have a lid and is very large. I ended up adding extra chicken broth and covering it with aluminum foil, which I hardly ever use because of its toxic potential.  It is still cooking and I just hope it will come out edible. If you are going to cook Chinese, think cooking in wok.

I've been doing Chinese style stir fry for a while...  and this is "essentially" how you do it...

But...  Once you have your sliced chicken breast...  give it a dusting of corn starch...  then add a little teriyaki to that...  let it soak for 10-20 mins...  THEN bring it to the wok or skillet...  This will give you that little salty coating you get at the Chinese place...  ( I also remove the chicken from the wok when I add the veggies and return at the end )

The amount of sauce on this might be a bit light too...  Consider adding a little chicken stock?  

( also consider using boneless chicken thighs...  I think a lot of Chinese restaurants use them in similar dishes. )

Personally, while I ate this I found it too salty for my tastes. With no flavour other than teriyaki, I’m not that surprised. My husband loved it and my 6 y.o. ate the noodle part, but my 2 y.o. barely touched it, hence the average rating of 3. I made Chinese the other week (using the Chicken and Chinese Vegetable Stir-Fry recipe on this site) which was received a lot better, so I’ll be sticking to that recipe in future.

This was tasty, however the recipe recommended a vermicelli type asian noodle.  It was way to flimsy, use a more substantial noodle.  I mixed my leftovers with a fried rice which was pretty good.

Not sure how this recipe got 4 1/2 stars.  The recipe itself was not very clear in that it didn't have any cooking temperatures and the finished dish in my opinion had no flavor.  I deleted this recipe from my recipe group.  I won't be making it again.

Great recipe. I diced the chicken before frying -- because Chinese food does not allow cooking the complete slabs of breast meat (chopsticks, hello?) I had some extra cabbage in the fridge, so I sliced and added it to the leftovers.

I like to cook a bag of chicken breast in the crock pot and then it's ready for recipes or quick snacks. I used about 2 cups of precooked chicken, frozen veggies and the homemade teriyaki sauce listed in another review. We like to serve it over cauliflower rice. It's ready in 10-15 minutes.

This is such a quick, easy and tasty dish.  I substituted Swiss Chard stems for the broccoli because I had so much of it in my garden.  In addition, I cooked Mi Vi Trung Dried Noodles in my homemade chicken broth before adding it to the chicken and veggies.  It was a little dry for us so I added some of the chicken broth to the dish.   It came out perfect and was a hit with the family.

I thought the quantity of this recipe was huge, so, I made some changes to that, and I added some additional veggies and used a homemade teriyaki sauce.  This recipe was a great starting point to make a delicious and quick Chinese dish that was healthy and satisfied a craving for Chinese takeout. I only used one chicken breast that I diced and I added diced red pepper, mushrooms and garlic in addition to the snow peas, carrots, and broccoli.  Yum.

this was such a nice simple dish.. i'm sure the teriyaki sauce will make or break the dish.. i just used kikkoman low sodium teriyaki.. probably double or triple the amount that was listed.. as always i use what i have on hand.. no onion but i had a leek.. no snow peas so i added half a bunch of asparagus.. no chinese noodles so i used linguine pasta instead (about 8 oz).. this totally worked for us and as bf says.. the moral of this story is embrace simplicity.. ty for the recipe

It was a delicious comfort meal, but the recipe doesn't specify which kind of noodles to use. I used ramen, but I think this could be a much better dish with buckwheat soba noodles, hokkien noodles, or even spaghetti. I cooked the noodles on the side, then mixed everything together at the end. 

The vegetables need to be steamed for at least 5 minutes, not 2 minutes. I used double the amount of teriyaki sauce. 

Great taste! My 7-year-old went back for seconds and thirds.
