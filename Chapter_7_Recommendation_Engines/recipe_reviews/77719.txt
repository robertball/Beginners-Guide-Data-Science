I wanted to make a different pasta dish for once, instead of making the same old noodles and sauce, and when I saw this, I knew I had to try it. I made it with a few modifications - instead of egg noodles I used Cellentani noodles (or spiraly elbows as I like to call them), instead of chopped onion I used onion powder, and I added garlic salt, pepper, and parsley flakes. I also only needed 14 slices of cheese instead of 16. All in all, I think this recipe is really great! It tastes great, I love the texture, and the cheese is a nice addition. Plus, you can be really flexible with the ingredients, so you don't end up making the same thing again and again. All of my friends asked me for a copy of the recipe and I'm sure they'll love it too!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I didn't have any Mexi-corn so I used regular corn instead.  I agree with DavidsMom about pre-cooking the onion, I think I will do that next time.  I also added a few things like Worcestershire sauce, chili powder, Louisiana Hot Sauce, garlic powder, salt & pepper.  All this added a little kick to it!

My husband prefers his onions pre-cooked, so I sauteed them in a little olive oil with some garlic; I also added some pre-blended Italian seasoning to the soup mixture before putting with the noodles. I also would agree to reduce the amount of cheese; overall the recipe was delicious!!

The name of this recipe intrigued me and the absence of meat made it even more appealing. A little penny-pinching goes a long way!  I must say that is is wonderful!  The creamy, tomatoey sauce combined with the crunchiness and flavorfulness of the Mexicorn was a pleasant surprise.  I have to say that I did not think that a medium onion was too much.  Our family loves onions, anyway.  I only topped the casserole with *8* slices of cheese and it was enough for me.  All in all it was a great dish and I would definitely make it again!

I made this dish for my vegetarian daughter and we were pleasantly surprised. She and I both thought it was very good. I made the full amount and froze 1/2 before adding the noodles and plan on reheating it again tonight. Thanks for an easy tasty veggie dish!

My family is made up a few vegetarians and this is a quick recipe everyone in the house loves!  I use soy crumbles in it instead of corn.  I have used onions and peppers, onions and corn.  This is a weekly staple in our menu now.

Yummy for all not just my vegetarian peeps!  I added fresh cilantro, green and white onion and Tabasco for an added kick.  I also used Chipotle White Corn from Green Giant.  What a terrific dish!

I decided to make this cause I had all the ingredients on hand, but I only ate it cause I didn't want to waste food. It's just bland, it needs more vegetables and spice of some kind.

This recipe ruined my dinner party!  An entire medium onion is WAY TOO MUCH!  All we could taste was onion, and we ended up ordering pizza.  I would reduce to two tsp. onion.  Good thing my guests kept good spirits!  I'll never live this flop down!

I made this because I had all the ingredients on hand, we found it bland. My kids didn't like it, and they usually like anything with noodles. They said it tasted wierd. I found it too "soupy tasting", I think the tomato soup in it made it taste funny. I think it would have been better with sour cream instead, I'll keep looking for a creamy noodle casserole recipe.

OK - added zucchini, yellow squash and doubled the corn. Changed cheese from Am to colby/mont. jack and gouda. Added garlic powder and SALT.  And pepper. Need spices.  Has promise, with your individual touches!

I have made this recipe for 30 years. The only difference is I add a pound of ground hamburger fried up with the onion. I can't imagine this dish without the hamburger in it.

I made this on a Friday during Lent because it doesn't use meat. I thought it was good but my husband just said it was ok. My kids ate it & it was simple to prepare so I thought it was a good recipe.
