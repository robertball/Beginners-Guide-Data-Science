My mother made a recipe very similar growing up and I always loved it. Great on a cold day. The addition of the cheese and chips on top give it a nice touch.  Serve over hot white rice and it is wonderful!

This casserole wasn't all to my taste, but I think it's a good base. I think it needs more seasonings, especially in the meat. My husband suggested using one can of cheddar cheese soup as well as cream of mushroom soup with shredded cheddar on top... I did like all the textures going on - the corn, beef, chips, etc. but for me it really needs a nice kick. Maybe southwest seasonings or something like that.

What a simple and delicious recipe.  I added habanero cheese dip (for a little kick), peas and substituted the potato chips with French's fried onions...as well as used low fat cream of mushroom soup in an attempt to lessen the fat.  For my leftovers the next day, I put it over rice, as previously suggested.  Yum!! This may just be on the table over the holidays due to the rave reviews.

I made a "basket" of cooked spaghetti on the bottom of my casserole dish and then followed the recipe exactly as posted. Simply delicious. Also excellent the next day in my lunch box.

I made this without the beef, and only one can of soup as a side dish.  It was very good and quite easy.

This recipe came out pretty good.  The only item that I may add is perhaps placing this on top of some noodles for some added flavor.

This recipe was not my cup of tea but my family liked it. I added more potato chips on top after it was done baking and served with garlic bread and caesar salad.

My husband thanked me and said it was good. That's why I gave it 4 stars. It wasn't for me I guess.

I changed the meat and the cheese in this dish and also added some spices and it was very yummy.  I would definately make this again.  It actually makes me want to eat my vegetables!
