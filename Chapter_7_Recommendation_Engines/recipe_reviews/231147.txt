Breakfast burritos are awesome and pretty much contain every food group! They can be made ahead of time and are perfect for "on the go". I swear you could put anything inside a warm tortilla and it's gonna taste good... You can add pretty much anything you want or have on hand because once you combine scrambled eggs, veggies, breakfast meat and cheese in a warm tortilla you're in breakfast heaven! All you need is a side of salsa, sour cream, a little tabaso or cholula and you're all set. Next time I think I'll opt for a lower fat version and use a combination of eggs and egg beaters, boca breakfast sausage links, and reduced fat cheddar.  Definitely hearty so make sure you're hungry!

I’m not sure how the recipe as written would make 4 burritos. Just doesn’t seem like enough filling.  I ended up using 3 bell peppers (diced, instead of in strips), 9 eggs, and a whole 12 oz package of sausage links. That definitely made enough for our family for breakfast for a couple days. Overall, it needed some additional seasoning, but it was a good base.
