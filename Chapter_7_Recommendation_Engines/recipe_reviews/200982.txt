The recipe is simple but there are a few extra things that can be done to turn this recipe to an easy 5-star. Instead of using one cup of water, I substituted one cup of (no sodium chicken) broth. I tossed the potato cubes/slices with seasoning and EVOO. I used skinless thighs for this and reckon the meat would have been a lot better with skin-on thighs that were marinated in the oil mixture. After the chicken was done, I covered it with potatoes, scooped juice over the pile and then sprinkled with Parmesan. I let that cook for another 5 minutes and then broiled between 5-10 minutes. Again, because I used skinless thighs on my first attempt, the potatoes were the star of the meal. However, I will make this again and use skin-on thighs. Thanks for sharing!!!

This is so easy to throw together and my family loves it. I added a few things; like others I used fat free chicken broth instead of water. I mixed the herbs with the EVOO and added 2 chopped cloves of garlic, 1/2 t. pepper, 1/2 t. salt; then coated the potatoes w/ the oil mixture before layering them on the chicken. I also added a thinly sliced onion on the chicken before putting on the potatoes. I used boneless chicken breast just because that's what I had- turned out great!

This was an excellent recipe.  It's easy to make ... the potatoes were smooth, the chicken was crispy and yet juicy on the inside and it took no time at all to make!

This was a very good recipe. I tweeked a few things by reading others reviews and adding a few things of my own. Season the chicken w/ Lawry's seasoned salt, garlic powder, onion powder and pepper. I cut the water by 1/2, added minced garlic and oregano to evoo mixture. Sprinkled additional Lawry's over entire dish. Covered w/ alum foil for the remaining 20 mins of cooking which allowed the potatoes to cook through. Removed the alum foil and broiled on high for 8 minutes to crisp the skin of chicken. This dish was a winner!! Check out the completed custom recipe on my channel. The recipe is titled delicious baked chicken and potatoes.

This is the perfect dinner.  It is easy, inexpensive, delicious and you dont have a lot of clean up! I made this for company and one of our guests said "you need to add this to your repeating recipes list."  I thought that was good compliment! I made some changes that other reviewers suggested.  I put the potatoes and large slices of onion in a bowl with the olive oil and seasoning (s+p, rosemary, thyme and garlic salt), and rolled it around to cover the vegetables.  Then in the baking dish I put chicken broth and my chicken (I used bone in split chicken breasts cause that is what I had). I put some salt, pepper and a touch of cayenne on the chicken directly, then placed the potatoes and onions covered in the rosemary/thyme mix around the chicken. I also added a few whole garlic cloves for a little extra something.  I cooked it uncovered, then added foil over top for the last 20 mins.  Once it was done I took off the foil, added shredded parmesan  and baked for another 5 mins.  All that to say, there were no leftovers.

Easy, tasty recipe. I used chicken thighs, left the skin on. Juicy chicken, the fat from the chicken made the potates crispy on the outside. Yum. I only used 1/2 cup water, was thinking about the chicken rendering as it cooked, which helped the potatoes flavor and tender but crisp texture. Loved the herbs!

As people have said, I used chicken broth in place of water & I made a delicious gravy with the drippings & more broth. Also added carrots.

This is a keeper :).

This was just okay. The chicken didn't brown up and get crispy and the amount of liquid was a little too much. Overall it was kinda bland, which is surprising considering I used chicken stock instead of water. The potatoes were pretty good with nice flavor (but not enough). Conclusion: I've had much better baked chicken.

This was easy to make and everyone loved it...I didn't have olive oil so I boiled chicken bullion cubes and made a broth for it instead of water. I also used Mrs. Dash Itallian seasoning for the chicken and potatoes ( I am staying with my mother and father in law and it was all I could find.) It was really good though everyone had leftovers and my husband and I made sandwhices out of some of the leftovers. This was one recipe that didn't go to waste. Thanks!!!

I only had chicken breasts and knew they wouldn't add as much flavor as the dark meat, so I threw in a bullion cube.  Everybody went back for seconds!!  Thanks!

Really yummy and easy. Only changes I made were I put celery leaves and ends in the cavity with a pat of butter. I mixed the oil with the thyme and rosemary, s&p and brushed it on though i used a little extra oil and seasonings since I brushed it on the chicken as it baked. I used a 6 pound whole chicken and it did absolutely fine.  I served this with pasta salad and baked beans.

Used chicken stock instead of water. Tossed potatoes in 2 tbl olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, salt and pepper before putting into the pan. Also added 1 sliced yellow onion on top of chicken, then placed potatoes over entire mixture. Used 3 lbs chicken because that is what I had and it just fit into the roasting pan perfectly.

I've made this dish for few years w/some changes. I use bonesless chicken breasts, a whole sliced spanish or yellow onion, red potatoes and season everything with olive oil, salt, black pepper, rosemary or thyme,3-4 cloves of minced garlic, add everything to roasting pan. I  then pour in some chicken broth and some white wine. Bake covered w/aluminum foil and remove foil apprx 10-15 min before done. Chicken and potatoes are delicious, tender and we pour some of the juice from the pan over the dish and serve with piece of fresh bread.

Yummy!!  Adding chicken broth is needed in this dish as other reviewer suggested.  I forgotten to add garlic, but still turns out great without it.  Definately will be my keeper.  Thanks for sharing the recipe Dana Michele.

I used some of the previous suggestions of adding onion, chicken broth and garlic. But my family likes lemon so I added some lemon juice to the broth and over the chicken with fresh thyme instead of dried. It was yummy.

I used rather large quarters and removed the skin. Also used poultry seasoning {sage, rosemary, and thyme} and added a little onion powder. It took much longer to bake, but my husband loved it. The chicken was very moist and tasty.  Will definitely make this again.

I reversed the process on this. I took the potatoes, placed in a bowl and added the olive oil and seasonings and tossed together. Put the chicken into a baking dish and spread the potatoes around. I seasoned the chicken with garlic powder, s & p, then drizzled the remaining oil from the potatoes over the chicken. I put enough chicken broth in just to cover the botom of the pan, turns out I didn't really need to as the fat from the chicken would have done the trick. The end result was crispy skin chicken and lovely roasted potatoes. Next time I will check after 30 minutes, some of the fat may need to be drained off. Clean up was a breeze! Will be making again. Update: Made this again and brushed chicken with BBQ sauce for an additional 10 mins. YUM.

Recipe was good, but only thing that lacked was its variety in flavor and the adding of additional ingredients could've done more to help the dish. More variety in veggies and àccent seasoning would be a good touch along with letting the chicken marinate in a preferred sauce overnight.

It was a little bland for my tastes.  But the kids had second helpings, and it was really easy to make, so I'm sure we'll make it again!

Very, very, good. I wasn't sure about this one, but my wife and I loved it. Very easy to make. Used chicken broth instead of water. Used seasoning salt, and added onion and garlic powder.

I found this recipe to be bland, even though I used chicken broth, garlic and lemon juice instead of just water. The chicken tasted boiled.  I appreciate that it was a healthier recipe that I could feel good about feeding to my 3 year old, but in terms of taste, it was just OK.

It was ok. My family said "eh...it's ok." The chicken didn't brown up so it wasn't a very pretty dish. There was a bit too much liquid..maybe cutting it back to 3/4 cup might help? I used chicken stock but that didn't seem to help with the flavor... A tad bland for our liking. The chicken was juicy but all in all it was just ok.

The name says it all!  I didn’t have fresh rosemary so I used fresh basal and oregano with the time and garlic.  I also used chicken broth instead of water and a good amount of salt and garlic pepper on top, coverd with foil for fall of the bone chicken.   The potatoes were amazing, especially with gravy made from the drippings.  The whole family loved this simple recipe so much I will be making it many more times.  Thank You.

I loved this recipe because it's very easy to prepare and I have the option of adding different spices each time. I followed the advice of a reviewer by adding spices to the potatoes before placing them on the chicken. Also placed the chicken in the grill for the last 10 minutes to make it browner and crispier.

I'm just not very sure what I did wrong.  I ended up cooking it for a lot longer in order for the chicken to be done, and even then the potatos were not completely cooked.  I don't know if I will even try this recipe again due to the first attempt.  I'm sure though, that if cooked properly this recipe would taste great!

Overall I thought this recipe was pretty good.  In addition to the rosemary, thyme, salt & pepper I used Lawry's seasoned salt.  Once completed I paired it with a salad.  I would make this again!
