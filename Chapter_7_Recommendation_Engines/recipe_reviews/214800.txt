Holy guacamole Batman!  This was a GREAT meal!  I actually followed the recipe to a "T" no substitutions (which I almost NEVER do) and this was AWESOME!  Got rave reviews from the finicky teenage boys-- apparently we will be eating this a lot more!!

GREAT recipe!  I couldnt' find flank steak at my grocery store so I used Chuck Eye Round Steak.  It worked out wonderfully.  The salsa this recipe makes is soooo good!  I was eating it by itself, then got the chips out to dip in it.  It makes quite a bit - good thing.  I served it with rice and salad but plan on making it for steak tacos next.  Great recipe!

This was very good!  I love flank steak and this was a pretty good rub.  I did think that the cinnamon seemed to stand out the most once it was cooked.  The avocado salsa was delicious and I will definitely make that again:)

We made this but turned it into steak tacos and topped them with the Avocado Salsa and some cheese.  They were sooooooo Good!  5 Stars!

I made this for dinner tonight, and it was SOO yummy! My boyfriend and I both love spicy, so I upped the amount of red pepper flakes in both the rub and the salsa.  We decided to make steak tacos out of this, and thinly sliced the steaks, and ate them on flour tortillas with the salsa on top, and fresh baby greens. This is a recipe I will totally make again!

This was very yummy! I did make a few changes to attempt to cut back a little fat I used 2 avocados and 1 tablespoon of oil. Will be making again!

Was not a fan of the cinnamon but it was still pretty good. Will make this recipe again with either less cinnamon or none at all and see how that is.

This was an absolutely great combination! Although I'm typically not a fan of grilling flank steak, this steak turned out wonderful! The spice rub was perfect and when cooked properly, even flank steak can be juicy and tender. The avocado salsa was equally great, although more of a side dish than a garnish. The recipe makes a ton of salsa. In the future, I'll probably cut the salsa ingredients in half and maybe quarter the amount on onion. Other than that, I wouldn't change a thing. As recommended, I served this dish with a side of cilantro-lime rice and I was very impressed with the overall results. Definately a keeper!!!

Great recipe. I was glad to find one for flank steak that didn't involve marinating, since I waited until the last minute for dinner preparations. The cinnamon was a nice addition, although my husband wasn't as crazy about it. I might halve it next time. I only used half the rub as I was leery of too much spice. Will make again!

Wow.... I have tried a lot of different ways to make steak and this is my favorite! I know my husband will love this! I did make one small change because I didn't have any chili powder, so I used Cajun Seasoning instead. This turned out wonderfully and I will make this over and over again!

This was amazing!!! One of the best meals I have ever made from this website... I made the recipe exactly as stated, but saved half the spice rub for next time.. Also, I have never done a dry rub before and was worried that the meat would be dry, but--no--- I needed multiple paper towels to catch the juice from the meat that ran off of the cutting board... Yummy!

AMAZING! This is one of the best (if not the best) recipes I have tried on this website. I did not change a thing. 
I will be making the avocado salsa one its own too.

WOW - this was awesome!  Followed the recipe exactly and the family loved it.  To serve, I made a bottom layer of rice, then black beans, then corn, then steak, then avacado salsa.  The kids ripped off warm pieces of tortilla, put a fork full of the mixture on it, and down the hatch it went.  YUM!!

This was delicious--loved the spicy bite of the rub contrasted with the cool avocado salsa. This will be a summer go-to meal for us, I'm sure.

This is one of the easiest and tastiest fajita recipes I have tried so far.  I didn't have any ground coriander on hand but the meat still came out delish. I thinnly sliced and chopped up my cut and stuffed it into warmed corn tortillas.  I have to say the Avocado Salsa was the BEST...YUM...Thank you for this ono-lishous recipe!

Great recipe.  I made it exactly as written and everyone enjoyed it.  Next time though, I'll 1/2 the cinnamon and the lime juice in the salsa (I used fresh lime and it was a bit strong).

This was excellent. I cut the recipe to serve 2. I didn't have ground coriander.It made more rub that I normally would have used. I used the extra on potatoes for the grill.
I couldn't find avocados, I used 1/2  jar guacamole, onion, cherry tomatoes, garlic cumin, ground red pepper, lime juice. 
The dry rub would be great sprinkled on rice.

I really enjoy at eating at critically acclaimed restaurants, and I often change recipes a little on this site.  This, however, was an amazing recipe.  Not only was it easy to make, but it blended together a variety of interesting flavors - albeit mostly Latin flavors.  The only change that I would consider in the future is swapping out the red pepper flakes for other peppers, which I may prefer due to my own personal preferences.  You may also consider cutting down on the pepper flakes because the dish is reasonably spicy.  But, if you don't like spicy dishes, you may find this too spicy.

Husband raved about this recipe! We don't have a grill so I had to broil instead. 5 Mins each side and it was perfectly med rare. Also I sprinkled with low sodium worcestershire before I added rub to meat. Followed recipe to a "T" otherwise. Thank you will be adding this recipe to monthly rotation. YUMM!!

This dish was amazing - I will be making again and again!  First the salsa - I made in advance leaving out the avocados until right before serving.  Left it on the counter for the flavors to meld - BOY did they ever! YUM! I could have eaten that plain with spoon.  The rub for the steak was also amazing.  I did leave the cinnamon out, really don't think it needed that and it wasn't missed.  The rest of the ingredients were loosely measured.  Rubbed it on the meat, wrapped in plastic wrap and stuck in the fridge for about 4-5 hours.  Absolutely the best flavor ever!  Served this all with lime cilantro rice and a chilled corn, tomato salad both from this site.
Not only delicious but very easy!

VERY tasty! The store didn't have flank steak, the butcher cut me a flat iron instead.  Very good!  The husband was not thrilled about the avocado salsa, but I loved it!

Amazing! Just like the top reviewer, I followed this recipe exactly to a T and it was so tasty. The rub had such a unique flavor to it that the whole family enjoyed! I think I might have been hogging the avocado salsa that's how tasty it was! Yum! Will definitely make again sometime soon.

We loved the flavor of the rub. Put it on a rib-eye we got on sale and it was fantastic. I am going to make a double batch and try it as seasoning on fish next time I make it.

The avocado salsa was wonderful and we used the leftover on omlettes the next morning.

I joined allrecipes because I wanted to rate this one.I loved the flavor and ease of making it even though it was winter. I grilled it with mesquite, made it super hot the smell of the spices searing was awesome.Instead of wine just went with corona and lime.I will be serving this on a regular basis.thank you p.s. even the dirty dishes are appetizing

This meal was such a hit with my family! I made it several times now. It makes for a very good summer time meal.  I added double the amount of lime juice to the salsa because I liked the tangy flavor.

This was good.  I halved the red pepper and the cinammon and cooked under the broiler in lieu of grilling.  My 3 y/o granddaughter absolutely LOVED the steak and it was plenty tender enough for her to enjoy.  I only used about 2/3 of the rub and wrapped in plastic to marinate for about 8 hours.  The salsa was very good and gets even better the longer it sits.  Thanks for sharing this recipe!

Delicious!!  I only wanted 2 steaks, but do NOT change the recipe amounts.  The guacamole doesn't taste as great when it's cut in half and the rub tastes a little off also.  Keep everything the way it is and bring some chips for the leftover salsa.

Very strong chili flavors, we ate it on a bed of spinach & it would probably taste better in a tortilla. The avocado mixture was a little bit aggressive in terms of the cilantro but in combination with the meat it was good.

Wow, this recipe was great!  Our avocados were very ripe so the salsa turned out to be more like guacamole, but the flavors were very good.  We served with warm corn tortillas as suggested. I'm so glad we have leftovers for lunch tomorrow!

OMG!!!! We loved this recipe! Made it with the Lime Cilantro Cauliflower "Rice"  and that was equally great. We saved leftovers for dinner tomorrow night and I can't wait for dinner already. Two amazingly good recipes!

This was amazing!  I actually didn't use the seasonings listed on the steak, I used a Chili Lime Rub instead that I had on hand.  But the end result was still phenomenal.  The Avocado Salsa is delicious!

This grilled Flank-Steak-with-Avocado-Salsa recipe was delicious. Who knew that such a thick spice rub on a steak would resemble a "shaked'n'baked steak" (with a "crumb coating" of spices)? What is not obvious from the recipe is that the avocado salsa is more like a reasonably-sized side salad than a relish topping. This is a very important detail indeed because it made my usual side dish (a large salad) a terrible choice: a baked potato and grilled vegetables would have been much, much better. As I also learned from experience, this is not the dish to serve with wine: the lime marinade on the salsa does not go very well with wine. My only change to the recipe was to marinate the minced onion and garlic in the fresh lime juice with a tad of honey for 15 minutes to take out any possible "skunky onion or garlic tastes" before mixing them with the rest of the salsa ingredients. Thank you jensenly for sharing your recipe.

I was unsure how it would turn out with the ingredients.  I'm not a big cinnamon fan.  And I'm used to marinating flank steak so it's tender.  But this turn out juicy, tender, and super delicious.  The first thing out my husbands mouth was "WOW!  What ingredients did you use?  I never could have made flank steak turn out so good!"  He loved it, I loved it!  It's a keeper!!

Followed the recipe exactly and it was absolutely delicious! After cutting up the meat I squirted it with lime juice and we had it on corn tortillas with the "best ever" guacamole.

YUMMY!!  I have to say I marinated instead of using the rub.  My kids don't do spicey so I just added the cumin, corriander, salt to EVOO, white balsamic vinegar, chopped garlic and cilantro and marinated for an hour.  Really great and married well with the avocado salsa.

I cut down the amount of cilantro in the salsa, and dropped the cinnamon from the rub (ISB and very reactive to cinnamon).  Turned out fantastic.  In fact, the salsa is now asked for lots of other dishes by the family.

I will use a little less cumin next time, but I think I just got a little crazy with the amount of rub more than anything. It was great! And I will eat that avocado salsa with every meal until I die I think.

This was delicious! My boyfriend loved it! The avocado salsa brought a wonderful balance to the seasoned steak. I paired the steak with cilantro-lime rice also found on this website.

I made this dish for a cooking club Mexican night. I'm not a very experienced chef, but this was such a great, easy recipe and everyone loved it! I ran out of chili powder so I tried replacing that with a few other things. But I imagine it would have tasted even better with the chili powder. I love the idea of throwing in red pepper flakes into the avocado salad.  It's just a bit spicy -- exactly the way I like it. 

I will definitely make this recipe again!

I love the way this recipe came out.  I marinated my steak over night and it was so juicy and tender. I had no left overs on this one and my family told me I should double the recipe.   I definitely will be making this again.

I would not change a thing.  I had extra salsa and used it the next day with crackers.  Will make this again!

It was divine! I made about 1 1/2 times the salsa and was glad because my whole family inhaled.

The seasoning rub made the flank steak yummy. The avocado salsa is optional.

Rub is great. Let the meat rest with rub on for two hours. Salsa excellent but I reduced the pepper flakes and added finely diced red bell pepper for color.

Made this recipe as written and wow was it a hit!  Everyone loved it, and sweetie actually was planning on having the steak and avocado on salad tomorrow as a left over.  That rarely happens!!  Great flavors.  We had a little rub left over, so we bagged it for another night.  Excellent.

This was so good!  The salsa is amazing and the meat had quite a spicy flavor to it.  We also made the cilantro lime rice and had a fantastic meal.   Even the "non avocado" people loved it.

This was really good.  I used all of the rub on a 1.8# flank steak and it completely covered it.  When I was slicing the flank steak, I tried a piece and thought, "way to much rub on the meat."  However, when I put it in a corn tortilla with the salsa, rice, and shredded cheese the rub wasn't as overpowering.  I will try less rub next time just to see.

Followed directions exactly except using a different cut of steak since I couldn't get flank.  But still, the salsa was just spicy but had no taste otherwise and the rub on the steak wasn't anything special either.  Won't be repeating this. For all the work it took to put together, it was a major disappointment. We threw most of it out.

Not sure what I did wrong. The meat was very tough and the flavor was ok but nothing to write home about. Will have go try making it again and see if I have a better result.

This was ok - the flavor combinations didn't work for me.  Seasoning was Indian/African flavor and salsa was Mexican/southwest.  I did reduce the amount cinnamon per the other reviews but it was still off.

Terrible,   I made it exactly as specified but made the mistake of putting the spice rub on the steak and then letting it sit in the fridge overnight instead of grilling it immediately.  BAD idea, don't let it sit or all the spices absorb into the meat, making it taste awful!

This is a delicious recipe! I was unable to cook the steaks on the grill, so instead I cooked them inside on a hot griddle with olive oil and they came out superr moist and delicious. This is not a recipe for oung kids or those who don't care for spicy foods though as it has a real bite to it.
