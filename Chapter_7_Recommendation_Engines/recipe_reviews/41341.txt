These were just ok.  I made them by hand.  I really liked all the ingredients, and they're things I use often, but I just didn't like the rolls very much.

Excellent and easy recipe, and very versatile too.  I've used up to 3 c. whole wheat flour (the "white" kind), added potato flour for moisture, substituted spelt for some of the whole wheat, and the results have always been delicious!  Try baking some on a sheet separated and some (8) in an 8" round cake pan and see if you notice a difference in texture like I did.

Absolutely delicious!  I followed the recipe to the tee, and the rolls came out perfectly!  So light, yet nutritious - a perfect compliment to soups and salads.  I'm a big fan of wheat/grain breads, and I really like this one because of the slight sweetness and ease of use with the bread machine.  With my picky family, you have to slip in the "health" factor via grains etc, wherever you can - and they adore these (even my 3 yr. old!)

These were good. I may or may not make them again.
