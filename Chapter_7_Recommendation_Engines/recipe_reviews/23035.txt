Very good recipe.  I did have to add extra broth though.  Also, I cut the carrots and celery into smaller pieces so that I could leave them in the broth and not discard them.

This was a pretty good soup - I made a few changes though. I also used chicken breasts and instead of using canned chicken broth I used home made chicken broth I had in the freezer and threw everything except the rice into the slow cooker. I made the rice separately in a rice cooker using chicken stock and then placed about a half cup of rice in the bowl topped with soup. I kept the rice and soup separate because I did not want the rice to stuck up too much stock when saved in the fridge - I've had this happen with other soups with rice and noodles. I think this recipe is a good start but needs some salt and maybe a some other herbs and spices to get it to a five star recipe.

I was craving chicken noodle soup, but had no noodles, so I decided to try this.  I took a short cut and used chicken breast so I didn't have to debone anything.  I also used more broth and less rice (about 3/4 cup) as some suggested.  I cut my veggies up small and left them in the soup.  I agree with other reviewers that this is a good start, but it will need some spices to perk it up a bit.

Perfect for what I was looking for.  It's a great, quick soup recipe.  I used brown rice so it needed extra cooking time.  I also added a boulion cube, 3/4 c frozen peas, and put the carrots back in when I returned the shredded chicken.  I love spicy but my family does not, this was great for them.  I sent a pot of it over to my father who is on a low sodium, low cholesterol diet.

When I saw the name of this soup I thought it might be what I am looking for, but alas it is just cooking chicken in chicken broth.  I want to make my own broth from a nice fat stewing hen which I cannot find any longer.  Anyone know where to find such a chicken any longer?

My whole family (all six of us!)got the stomach bug. This recipe was perfect. Good, old fashioned, simple-for-the-tummy soup. It tasted great and made us all feel better.

I give this recipe a 4-star rating only because of the slight tweaking I did. Great soup, but as MaMaw recommended, I used water and added Garlic herb soup mix, left the carrots and celery in. I also added brown minute rice. Excellent recipe for seasonal flu! Will be making again.

There is no reason to start with stock, unless you have some on hand. Water is fine, just retain the veggies. You'll get way more nutrition that way, less salt and save money.

Good basic recipe.  Needs spicing up a bit with salt, parsley or other herbs but it's a good start.

This was pretty good!  Followed almost exactly ~ just used brown rice instead of white and cooked it in my slow cooker.  My children gobbled it up.

I always make this after Thanksgiving and Christmas. With turkey. And freeze it to serve on cold nights when I don't really feel like cooking. You can dress it up with all kinds of stuff. Just use your imagination and tastse buds!

Good base for soup, but needs a bit more flavor. I kept veggies in the pot. For some reason my rice ended up absorbing all the soup and leftovers were more like a casserole. That was probably my fault!

I made this last evening to have a for a quick lunch today.  I left the vegetables in it and added the dripping from when I roasted the chicken.  Only to get up this morning to a pot of mush.  So before I can even eat this I have to add more broth or have a mushy casserole.  Not impressed!!!!!!!!!

While this soup was very tasty, it was a lot more labor intensive than I thought - specifically when it came to removing the chicken meat from the skin and bones.

This was an absolutely delicious soup! My roommate had three bowls and couldn't stop raving about it. I did make a couple changes. I added a little bit of chili powder (three pinches or so) for some excitement and then four bay leaves (which I let simmer) to pull the flavors together. But overall, an amazing recipe

Good recipe to change around to suit your taste. I cooked two large frozen chicken breats in three cans of broth and water to cover with lots of herbs. I then added celery, broccoli, a carrot, half an onion, and some potatoes. Turned out very well, not our favorite soup but an excellent staple to diversify dinners. Next time I'll try it with rice.

WOW! Super easy and super yummy.  The only things that I changed was that I used chicken/thigh quarters, salt & cracked pepper, and brown rice (my preference). I also did not discard the onions, carrots, or celery...too much flavor to let go of. This was a BIG HIT, especially with the cornbread!

I was very pleasantly surprised by this recipe.  It seemed too easy to be this good.  I had planned on roasting a chicken and then adding it to broth with veggies and rice, but this was so much simpler...and my picky five year old loved it!

While I modified this recipe significantly (added Mexican spices, spicy pork meatballs and shrimp) the one thing I stayed true to was the interesting rice idea.  However- this was WAY too much rice for the broth base and I had to add 2 more cans (beyone water and stock I had already added).  I would only add 1/2 C. rice next time.
