Moist and rich but could have been a bit sweeter and needs more spices.  I also used ginger which is not included in the original recipe.

The first time I made this, I didn't have enough flour even though I halved the recipe so I used a cup of complete buttermilk pancake mix. I also made a really big loaf because I don't have small pans. Also I substituted allspice for cloves because it's what I had. This bread was rich, delicious, and almost like cake. I just made another tonight because it was SO good!

The only issue I had with this recipe is how it fit into three loaf pans.  I prepared three pans but when I dumped the batter I realized I barely had enough for two.  So I baked it in two 9x5 metal bread pans.  The bread baked perfectly in the time alloted which is unusual for quick breads.  It is delicious especially with all the spices included.  Thanks!

I added my own stuff and burnt the bottom a bit. I cut that off and it went over very well with all my coworkers and fiends.

I made a different pumpkin bread yesterday but this one is better.  I did not have 3 cups of pumpkin so I used what I had (2) and added 1 cup homemade chunky applesauce.  I also added lots of spices-3 Tablespoons cinnamon, 1-1/2 T ground nutmeg, 2 t ground cloves and 1 t ground ginger.  AND 2 cups craisins Best of luck.  This turns this recipe into a 5 *

Tasted like pumpkin with a few spices that didn't overwhelm the overall taste. Thumbs up for Jim.

Really great! Nice soft and fluffy, I liked the fact that it uses up a lot of pumpkin compared to other recipes! I didn't have to change anything to the recipe!
