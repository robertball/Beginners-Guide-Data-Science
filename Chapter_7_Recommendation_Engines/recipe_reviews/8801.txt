This was very good, but I changed it a bit.  I bought stove top chicken stuffing and poured the entire box over the chicken.  Then I melted half a stick of butter and poured it over the top of that.  Even my very picky teen loved it!  I've made it at least 5 times already in the past three weeks!

Trust me, this recipe is good, but with the changes I made, it was great! I cut 4 chicken breasts into strips, topped it with a box of cornbread stuffing, and then poured a mixture of butter melted with 2 chicken buillion cubes and chopped onion on top. Baked for 45 minutes until chicken was juicy and stuffing had a little crunch. My hubby and two kids ate it ALL and my son said I was the "greatest mommy in the world" for making such good chicken. Definitely will make again.

I have made this recipe for chicken tenders at least once a week.  I also do the same thing with salmon fillets.  Tonight I'll make Pork chops the same way. The love of my life gives it a 2 thumbs up. Thank you so much.  Elly

This is very easy and the flavors are really nice (if you buy good stuffing). Because of that, I'll give it a high ranking. But, as the other comments said, the stuffing is really dry if you don't alter the recipe somewhat. I'd recommend putting in a little chicken stock or even cream of mushroom soup in addition to the butter to moisten it up.

I diced up about a 2/3 c total of fresh onion, celery, and grated carrots then sauteed them in the few T. of butter w/ some fresh rosemary I happened to have in the fridge before adding them to the boxed stuffing mix just to give it a little more of a homemade feel - Baked it covered for 20 min and uncovered for 10 and served it with some cranberry sauce from the pantry (probably leftover from last thanksgiving, lol) I have to agree that this was a wonderfully satisfying but simple homemade meal to have when I came home from work tired! and the best part was the leftovers! I honestly think it tasted better as dinner the next day =) not something I'd serve to company but great as a quick & easy after work 'comfort food' dish, thanks!

now this is amazing. who would have thought. the whole family loves it- and requests it often. a little more flavor if you shake the chicken in the stuffing first. i also wrap in aluminum foil for the majority of the baking time and open it the last 10-15 minutes.

We really enjoyed this recipe. I added approx. 1.5 cups of frozen mixed vegetables to the bottom of the dish first, then the chicken tenderloins, then I sprinkled them with garlic powder and Mrs. Dash Original. Finally, I sprinkled about 2 cups of stuffing mix over everything and put a 1/2 stick of butter (mixed with 1 tblsp. chicken boullion) and another 1/4 cup of water (mixed together) over all of the stuffing.  My six year old neice thought it was fantastic! Very kid friendly, especially with the mixed veggies added in.

This is a very easy and good recipe.  I used a whole box of Stove Top Stuffing and seasoned the chicken with a bit of lemon pepper seasoning.  I baked uncovered until I noticed the stuffing getting too brown, so I covered it and finished baking.

I used Stove Top stuffing (for pork).  I mixed in some of the seasoning with the butter as it was melting.  Very good and easy!!

I made this exactly as written and it was very tasty.  I am giving it 5 stars for ease and speed of preparation.  Sure, you could add spices, or dip each piece of chicken in butter and then the stuffing, but that is not the point of this recipe.  This recipe is for when you have no time to devote to dinner and still need to put something yummy on the table...and it accomplishes that very well.

I used 1.5 lbs frozen chicken tenderloins, one box  crushed stuffing mixed with 1 stick of butter, and sprinkled chopped onions over. Baked covered with foil for 40 min, then uncovered another 10. DELICIOUS!

That was AWESOME!!! I kind of doubled it... 10-12 chicken tenderloins placed in a 9x13 baking dish, topped with a box of Stove Top Chicken Stuffing mixed with one stick of melted butter... Baked at 350 for 40 minutes, and it came out perfect!! Another thanks for mentioning the cranberry sauce!!

Crushing the stuffing mix is a must. I used stove top with the herbs. Added the butter and some chicken broth to make the stuffing very moist. S&P the chicken and added some more broth on the bottom of the pan. The result was very moist. A quick go to dinner. Children would love this!! Thank You for Sharing

I am shocked that people have given this recipe such high ratings.  I guess the people who have rated/reviewed this recipe are easily impressed because while I found it to be edible, it was nothing spectacular.

I followed the suggestion by VirginiaJ and made the recipe a lil more homemade.  First, I sauteed chopped onion, celery, carrote and fresh sage in 3 tablespoons of butter.  Mixed in about 3/4 cup crushed stuffing.  Topped over chicken and added a lil extra drizzle of butter and a few leaves of sage to finish.  Baked at 350 (covered) for 20 minutes; then uncovered and let bake another 10 minutes.  The chicken was flavorful, moist and had a nice crunch on top.  Served with baked sweet potatoes, broccoli with cheese sauce and fresh cranberry sauce.  It was a really good mock Thanksgiving meal that came together quickly.  I'll be sure to make this again.  Thank you Lynne.

This is very good and very fast recipe.  It is an easy dish to make when I come home a bit late for dinner and need to prepare something that doesn't take a lot of preparation.  Thanks for posting.

Love this recipe as is but added parmesan cheese & drizzled sweet & spicy french dressing on top when serving-the extra punch of flavor from the french dressing takes this recipe over the top.

Using Chicken Tenders makes this a quick and easy meal.  I did add a little sage and McCormick's Perfect Pinch Savory to the chicken pieces before putting the dressing on top.  I served it with broccoli flowerettes, mashed potatoes & gravy, and with cranberries on the side.  Was almost like an "everyday Thanksgiving" dinner.  I'll certainly make this again.

Delicious.  I like more of a gravy on my chicken and may add cream of mushroom soup next time, but as is it was well received by my entire family.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  It was quick and very simple.  I used Stove Top stuffing and poured the melted margarine on top.  The chicken was tender and the stuffing had the right amount of crispness.  I would definitely make this again.

This recipe deserves 5 stars with a few changes. I used boneless/skinless chicken thigh (what I had on hand); chopped and cooked with some lemon pepper and garlic powder, then combined with 1 can cream of mushroom soup. Layered the dish first with a bag of frozen veggies, then the chicken/soup mixture, then a box of stuffing (mixed with water and butter) on top. Cooked covered for ~30 minutes, then uncovered for 10. Delish!

This was not good.  Yes, it was easy but the stuffing was really bad cook this way.  I would highly recommend just baking chicken by itself and cooking the stuffing separately.  I gave it a 2 star because the chicken was not dry.  The stuffing was.  :/

I thought this would come out being super flavored from the crushed stuffing mix, but I was disappointed.  I like the concept of a pre-crunchy coating....something needs to happen to the chicken prior to coating, salt, pepper, garlic salt...

Turned out perfect. My boyfriend loved them and he's such a picky eater.  Only change I made to the recipe is that I coated each piece on both sides and cooked them 35 minutes on one side and flipped and cooked an additional 10 minutes for crispness.  By the way, they're delicious with Ken's Honey Mustard and Sweet Baby Ray's Bbq Sauce. Hope everyone enjoys them as much as I did.

Very Easy and Tasty! Got it ready in minutes and my 9 yr old had alot of fun helping. With it being so easy I never thought it would come out so good. 
I did look at the reviews of others and added some of my own spices, alittle onion powder, garlic powder, and some italian seasoning and with the fear of what others said about the stuffing being crunchy I added about a half a stick of butter cut up on the top and it turned out wonderful! 
My husband and even the kids gave it a thumbs up! I will be making this again!

Very quick & easy.  I used the cornbread stuffing from Aldi or Pepperidge Farms & they have come out delicious each time.  Will make again this week.

I decided to make stuffing mix first using chicken broth instead of water. I placed 1 pkg. frozen brussel sprouts on bottom of pan followed by chicken and then mixed in one can of cream of chicken soup to the stuffing mix and topped the chicken with the mix. Removed foil 10 minutes before done. Baked for 50 minutes.

My 8 year old daughter is the hardest to cook for in the house and she gives it a 4, so, since that's who I cooked it for primarily...the four stays.  Good kids meal.  Doubt I'd make it again if it weren't for my picky daughter.  Served it as suggested with cranberry sauce, added a side salad and sauteed pasta with green beans.  Pounded stuffing mix in gallon-sized plastic bag to make into crumbs.  Too messy...bag developed many holes.  Will try using my food processor next time.

I can never count on my local grocery store to keep chicken tenderloins in stock. Rather than trying to split chicken breasts myself, I used boneless chicken thighs at the same cooking time and temperature (20 min covered in aluminum foil, 20 minutes uncovered) and they came out perfectly.

This recipe was good.  I thought it would taste a little better, but it was good.  I had some left over fried onions from the holidays, so I used those too, I ground the stuffing and the onions in the magic bullet.  This recipe needs garlic or something else to give it a bit more of a kick.  But, the kids ate it and like it,so that makes it a keeper. If you made mashed potatoes and had gravy with these, they would probably taste a bit better with a brown gravy on top.

I didn't read the part of the recipe that said finely crushed dry stuffing mix... This tasted ok, but I wouldn't make it again. It would have probably been better if I had finely crushed the stuffin mix.

This was just okay.  My son loved it but he likes very bland things.  I had to add bbq sauce and my husband used hot sauce.  Don't get me wrong, it wasn't horrible...just bland and needed "something".

I found this while looking for a recipe that would be a surefire hit with two sick kids.  Since I didn't have stuffing on hand, I coated the chicken with equal parts of breacrumbs and crushed French's Fried Onions together and then cooked as directed.  It was fantastically moist!  The melted butter was a great addition & the cooking time was prefect.  I've since tried it with stuffing and it works great that way too!

Very quick and easy.  I drizzled the butter over top, which worked okay, but you'd need more butter.  It didn't have as much browning as I would've liked, but was very tender and tasty - it just looked as though the stuffing crumbs weren't cooked enough this way.  I will try cooking as written next time for that reason.

This seemed so simply that I was worried. You will not believe how easy this is! It is wonderful. I put some stuffing mix on the bottom of the foil first and then put the chicken on top of it. Finally, I put the rest of the stuffing on top of the chicken. Don't go light on the butter!

Pretty easy to make and has a great flavor.  Took advice of others and tossed the chicken in the crushed stuffing mix first to coat the entire piece and then poured a mixture of 1/2 cup of melted butter, diced onion, and one chicken stock cube over the chicken.

This is an excellent recipe. Made it last night and it was a hit. I added some lemon juice on top while it was baking to make the chicken even more tender. Worked out great.

This was great! It is easy and is seasined well from the stuffing mix. It's an easy go to supper in the summer when it's hot out. My family always eats all of this including any  leftovers! (And it's pretty low carb for those watching that!) Thanks fro the great recipe.

I looked through other reader reviews and made some changes to this recipe:

- no foil in the pan (because I was out of foil...there was no other reason for that)
- poured some frozen mixed veggies as well as some frozen southern-style hash browns in the baking dish before putting in the chicken
- added a bit of chicken broth to the stuffing to moisten it up
- seasoned the chicken with paprika, pepper, onion powder, and garlic powder
- baked about 15 minutes longer than indicated because the chicken was still partially frozen when I put it in the oven

It turned out great. The chicken was tender and juicy, and the stuffing gave it a nice crunch in contrast. I think the veggies were a good idea and the seasonings pulled everything together nicely. My husband commented that he liked it, and my son, who said he didn't want the chicken "because it has brown things on it," ended up gobbling it down. I had seconds. Okay, I had thirds. And then I ate what my daughter didn't finish. It was really good!

This recipe was so simple! I did make some minor changes for our tastes...I added approximately 1 1/2 tsp. chicken boulion to the butter. I used a 1 1/4 sticks of butter (we like our stuffing on the moist side). I also added some frozen peas and carrots to the mix. I seasoned the chicken with some salt, pepper and garlic pepper. The taste was pretty good, though I think i'll cover it and then uncover 15 minutes before it's done. The stuffing needed to be just a little more moist.

I used 4 whole skinless, boneless chicken breasts.  Coated them liberally with garlic powder, onion powder, and paprika. Then layered onions on top. I added 1/4 cup of chicken stock (because I had it in my fridge...) and a stick of butter melted together over top of the stuffing.  It was okay but I definitely wouldn't use stuffing with rice(I had in my pantry).  It was good but still a little drier than I would have liked.  Be careful of what kind of boxed stuffing you use....

This was good, though the stuffing mix came out way too crunchy..though it was good.  I seasoned the chicken tenders with poultry seasoning first..it came out soo tender and juicy.  On the whole this was a very good recipe, just the stuffing could of been better.  Maybe I should cook it first next time??  Thanks soo much for sharing :>)

I liked this recipe more than my husband. It was a different way to prepare chicken. I didn't think the taste was that special but I will definitely be making it again because it was VERY easy and quick to make. I only had to bake mine 30 minutes. Maybe I'll play with the seasonings next time to try and improve on the taste.

Quick & easy but the chicken was too dry, maybe 40 min is too long.

It was a great base for what I wanted to do.  Yes, I changed it.

2.5 pounds of frozen tenderloins, thawed.
1 package of Trader Joes Gluten-free stuffing mix.
1 package of Trader Joes mirepoix.
5 cloves of garlic.
Olive oil - 2-3 Tbs
Butter, 6 Tbs.
I sauteed the garlic in the oil, then added the package of mirepoix, sauteed for about 5 min.  Added chicken broth, 3.5 cups.  Return to a boil then added the GF Stuffing mix.
placed the raw tenderloins in a casserole dish.  Bake at 350 for 40 min.

My family loved it! Chicken was moist and gave a nice flavor to the salad. The salad was romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, bacon bits, craisins, blue cheese, avocado, and red onion. Delicious!

I thought 40 minutes was too long to cook this dish. 25-30 would have left it more moist and tender.

This was very good and very easy. I used Bell stuffing and I seasoned the chicken tenders first. I think I'd maybe leave them unseasoned because it was a little too salty for me. I only cooked them for30 minutes and I think 25 minutes would have been fine. 40 minutes would have been too long.

I'm sure it wasn't the recipe, but my husband accidentally bought cornbread stuffing mix, so I gave that a try, although I don't like corn meal or any of its products.  Results were awful!  I'll try it again some day with regular stuffing mix

Made this chicken recipe for the first time tonight following the directions as written.  Checked chicken after 30 minutes and it was done.  Family thought meal was very good; we will be having these chicken tenders again.

This was so easy and so tasty!  I seasoned the chicken tenderloins with a lemon & garlic blend before topping with the butter/breadcrumb mix.  I only had Progresso unseasoned breadcrumbs so I did salt to taste.  This is a fantastic dish and I will make it again!

We loved this recipe!  Only a little change -- I added a small amount of dry Ranch dip mix with the crushed stuffing, then rolled each tenderloin in it rather than sprinkling it. Very simple to make!

It was good but a bit dry for my taste.  Next time, instead of using butter, I'll use chicken broth.

My family and I thought these were so-so. They could've used added seasonings (even a little cayenne) to make them more interesting. I liked them better the next day, when the coating was soft.

Very easy, very tasty!
I ended up using 6 boneless skinless chicken breasts, just about 1/2 to 3/4 of a stick of margarine, 1/2 box of stove-top stuffing, onion powder- turned out great, Yum!!!
