Wow! POTATOES! Who knew?  Thank you SO MUCH! This DEFINITELY made me stop going to the local restaurant where they ration how much garlic sauce you get with your pita bread! This definitely is BETTER too! Definitely keeping in my recipe box.  :-)

The garlic sauce was wonderful! Made chicken shawarmas for dinner and they were a hit!  The potato ingredient was brilliant!  Will use this recipe regularly in the future!  Thank you!

I grew up in an area with over one million Middle Eastern residents. Needless to say, I've eaten A LOT of garlic sauce. I just made this and can't stop eating it! This is absolutely restaurant quality, but without all the typical oil. It's going to be a constant in my house. Thank you!

I'm so glad I found this recipe!!! Never in a million years I would think that potatoes are incorporated in this garlic sauce.  I always ask for extra at restaurants and they give me 2 tiny containers.  Not any more, now I have my own in the fridge at all times.

This was very good.  I didn't have russet potato so I just used what I had.  I would add less lemon next time.  I think this would be fabulous with some blue cheese mixed in on top of a steak.  I also love it mixed with hummus.  Try it!

This is the best & by far the easiest recipe of homemade tomeya ever! It tastes exactly like the one I used to have back home & it's hassle-free. I would give this a hundred stars if I could.

It was amazing!! I had this a couple times in Hong Kong and have always wanted to make it. It was almost exactly the same but I would add more garlic and use less lemon to really get more garlic taste.

Very tasty and different. Word of advice; donâ€™t place the potatoes directly into the blender (I thought it would work). You just mash them first or the blender will have a hard time

This ended up having the texture of far too over-processed mashed potatoes...more gummy than the creamy, almost, fluffy, garlic sauce I've eaten in Lebanese restaurants.  That said, I am open to suggestions and it does successfully serve the purpose of an uber garlic condiment.  It also looked far less intimidating to make than toum.  I did add the oil SLOWLY and the mashed potatoes were well chilled when added.

Delicious! Used a bit more garlic, lemon, and salt than the recipe.

If you want garlic flavor, this is the way to do it.  So much flavor and the potato is a great thickening agent!  Great with our chicken souvlaki dinner.
