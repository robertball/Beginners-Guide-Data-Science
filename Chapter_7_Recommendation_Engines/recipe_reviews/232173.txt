I add reeses peanut butter cups instead of the chocolate chips.  About half marshmallows and half peanut butter cups.  Everyone loves it once there!  No cleanup or prep work while at the campsite!

These are good - I added more marshmallow and I actually wish I'd used more.  I didn't have a campfire handy, so I wrapped it in foil and put it in the toaster oven for a few minutes at 350 degrees and it came out great.

I made mine in a microwave and it was a hit.  Just constantly watch it -- as soon as the marshmallows puff up, take the cones out.

This is a basic start to a good idea. We've tried & I sent a couple of variations over to the neighbors & kids for some input. Everyone liked, but needed to tweek . Everyone liked the adding graham cracker, don't have marshmellow on top because it sticks to the foil. We just put in the oven, but would suggest a low temp like maybe 250 & maybe then the marshmellow wouldn't puff up & stick. Will make again.

We got the flat bottomed cake cones and the taste as part of the overall dessert was only ok.  Not too much fits into the cone but it was fun for the kids and easy to eat.

Not quite the same as the s'mores taste but love the no mess!  It contained the mess with the little, little ones and they can come back and eat it later too.  Next time I will try to add other things in as well.  Nuts, cookie pieces, other kinds of chocolate....  mmmm ~ Alex

Fun to do but it takes a long time so patience is required.
