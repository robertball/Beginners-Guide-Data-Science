Made a double batch of these. They were super easy. I was new at piping out dough in this fashion, so I want sure just how much to do. I could have made the bodies larger, but they worked out great still. I ended up with a lot of extra ganache and whipped cream, but that is likely because I didn't make big enough swans. I'd hardly call having extra chocolate and whipped cream in the house a problem, though. Assembly was simple and in the end made for a big hit at dessert. I will do again!

Also I don't have silicone mats, so used parchment and had no problems at all.

These were great. I filled them with a strawberry whipped cream—I ground up about 1/2 cup freeze-dried strawberries in the food processor with the sugar, adding it when the cream was softly whipped. Next time, I might make a 1.5x batch of the pate a choux, so that I’d have eight perfect swan bodies and enough for plain ol’ cream puffs. The swan bodies I piped were about the size of Italian plums; they do puff up nicely. I pricked the bodies at the head end with a skewer about three-quarters of the way through the bake time so the insides would dry out somewhat. Loved these! Really quite easy, once you get the piping down. Oh, and I made the swan components the night before, and filled right before serving so they didn’t get soggy.

Turned out great. We made 4 batches of these and they were a hit at our party.  Some people said the swans were too pretty to eat. Will make again.

I have to make it again. They collapsed on me. Let me first say that taste wise, they were great. Two things I should have done, I think are these:
1. mix the eggs and dough longer and 2. Lower the temperature to 350 after ten minutes for 20 more minutes. I took them out when 20 minutes passed because of the color; they looked great. I even pricked them with a toothpick (a clean one, thank you) to let the heat out, but they fell, as did my heart. But let me review the components I used:

the pate a chou was made exactly as Chef John (who I love) recommended. The filling was a simple custard package with cream and was lovely. And, the ganache was just as Chef John said. 

Now, I realize that no recipe will re create the joy that my hubby felt when his mom (now a celestial chef) made them for his birthday. Even if they are better, they aren't from his mom. So, to satisfy my chemistry perfectionistic compulsions and to try to create an 'almost' mom like puff, I shall try again. Hope springs eternal.

Wonderful, my heads looked more like dinosaurs, but it's a learning curve.  I used sweet German chocolate instead of dark, and I whisked it to thicken slightly.

My 10 year old made these into turkey's for Thanskgiving!  Lots of fun.  Had a bit of trouble with the dough - cook it a few minutes after you mix in the flour in one shot (not gradually).  And would probably do better with regular size eggs (we used large and the dough was runny).

I made these for Mother's Day. They were delicious. My necks were not as good as Chef Johns that was my error however. I had some butterscotch syrup on hand so I put that in on top of the chocolate ganache. Oh yeah Mom loved them.

Fun cream puff recipe to make. I used parchment paper to line the cookie sheet pans. And Pastry bag with tip #7 to pipe the swan necks; tip #10 for the swan bodies. Thank you Chef John. Love your videos.

5 stars for great swan directions and sticking to cream puff basics to make and bake. I made dozens of swans for my daughter’s 16th birthday/graduation party and everyone was wowed. With Chef John’s directions my next ones will look even better!

I have made this twice.  So much fun.  Turned out better than I expected, though the swan size varied quite a bit and the heads and necks got kind of dark on one side the first time around because I left them in the oven to cool as well.  I only made up about half of the chocolate ganache which seemed like the right ratio.   They still looked and tasted good on the second and third day!  Thanks Chef John!

I always love anything that Chef John makes and this was no exception. Mine aren't quite as pretty as his swans but they are delicious and pretty. Thank you for sharing.
