I thought this was very good and pretty easy . . .but I didn't do the last frosting topping; it just seemed sweet enough already.  Hubs agreed with me and does seem to like the cake.  I had to bake longer; about 15 minutes longer, but ended up with a nice coffee type cake that has good flavors, fruit, and plenty of sweetness.  I agree; this would be a good cake to take to a potluck.  thanks for the recipe!

My 10 year old daughter made this for a potluck dinner at church.  Everyone loved it!  It was very easy for her to make the cake.  I made the boiled icing to go on top.  This topping tastes like german chocolate cake icing without the nuts.  The cake is very moist, and freezes well.  We didn't change a thing.
