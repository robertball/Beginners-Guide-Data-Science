The flavors were good - lemon was prominent but not overpowering, and the seasoning tasted good with the lemon.  These came out moist and tender.  The only changes I made were to marinate it in a freezer ziplock bag, because I feel that coats the chicken better and to use garlic-infused grape seed oil in the marinade because I ran out of olive oil.  This is a simple recipe, perfect for a quick weeknight dinner.  I threw the chicken in the marinade before the gym and cooked chicken for 10 minutes after the gym.  I could have maybe cooked it another minute on each side for an even darker color, but it was still very tasty!  Served with a side of Thin Spaghetti with Garlic, Red Pepper, and Olive Oil (see other recipe from AR).  I will definitely make this chicken again soon!

Very flavorful!  I added a little basil but that was really the only change I made.  Leftovers were great on salad the next day.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed a recipe that called for no salt or pepper! After reading the other review by Jacolyn, I too used a Ziploc bag to marinate the chicken. The second time I made it, I did a variation by sprinkling lemon pepper on the chicken after removing it from the marinade.
