Awesome! I have been vegetarian for almost nine years, and tuna sandwiches/tuna melts and hamburgers are the only things I have missed. Well, this recipe has answered my tuna cravings. I made a number of taste changes, though....added much more mayo, red onion, sweet relish, pepper, powdered mustard to taste and the secret ingredient - sea salt. I tried it on crackers for a taste test, then refrigerated and made a "tuna melt" sandwich the following day. Yum! Who needs to eat a real fish? Thanks for the great idea!

I've made this a few times and really liked it, but last time made a couple of modifications.  First, as someone else mentioned in a review, I used lowfat plain yogurt instead of mayo.  I also added 1 tsp. of capers, and used india relish instead of sweet pickle relish (it's just a little spicier).  I had to go back and add about a teaspoon of mayo; the yogurt didn't do it for me.  But I guess it reduces the fat content significantly to use mostly yogurt and a little mayo.  Will definitely make it again!

I happen to love tuna salad sandwiches.  I'd say that the only thing reminiscent of tuna salad (or egg salad for that matter) are the condiments used to flavor this.  However, I love chickpeas/garbanzo beans.  I just made this recipe for lunch today and like it very much!  I'd suggest mashing it with a fork (or even a sturdy pastry cutter) if you like texture.   I didn't have green onions so took a little of a regular onion and minced it.  I also didn't have canned chick peas and so soaked the dried ones over night and cooked them this morning before making this.  That texture may possibly be different from canned.  Canned would save time!  I will definitely be making this from time to time.  It's a great change for lunch!  Thanks for submitting it.

Wow, I was very impressed with this! I have been wanting tuna salad for a long time (no fish!) and this totally hit the spot. I didn't rinse the garbanzo beans (reserved a lot of the flavor, I think) and I mashed them with a potato masher. Instead of using regular mayo, I used Nayasoya Nayonnaise (vegan soy mayo--has 35 calories instead of 100 like regular mayo) instead of the regular stuff. Tasted great! I think a little celery and cumin would also taste good in there. Will try that next time. And there will definately be a next time! Thanks Carole! ;-)

We had it in a sandwich and, while it certainly looks like tuna salad, and the consistency is pretty similar, it does not taste 'just like tuna.' Maybe it's because I eat canned tuna in sandwiches at least once a week, but I would never ever ever be fooled into thinking that this was real tuna!

So good!  How have I been vegetarian for 8 years, and never tried something so simple?  Like most people, I changed the recipe to accommodate my taste and what I had on hand.  I substituted sweet onion mustard and dill relish, left out the onions, and added a good dash of lemon juice, garlic salt, and Morton's Nature's Seasoning.  The lemon juice really adds some zip to it.  I don't think this is ever going to make it's way to a sandwich though...I'm eating it with a spoon!

It has its own unique flavor. The chickpeas need to really be mashed well, so use a blender. Add plenty of celery and onion, salt and pepper, and even sliced grapes and pecans, and it makes a nice summer sandwich.

It doesn't taste exactly like tuna salad but it sure kills the cravings! Actually, I even think I like this better than real tuna salad!

Though I don't think it really tastes like tuna salad, this is still an awesome recipe! It's soo simple, and tastes really good as a sandwich! I showed it to my mom a while back and I guess she must have loved how easy it was to make, because she started to make these sandwiches for us over and over and over...:), but I still like them a lot!

just tried it and it is a really simple and tasty replacement for tuna salad. as a vegetarian i don't eat fish and this is great for a nutritious and quick meal.i used nori seaweed crumpled up for a "fishy" taste and it worked very well.i had it on toast and it was excellent!

This was very good!  Before I became a vegetarian, a local restaurant served a blackened tuna melt that was awesome!  So, I tried to recreate this with the Mock Tuna Salad and it turned out great!  I made the recipe as directed, which tasted good as is, and then mixed in some shredded soy mozzarella.  I then spread it on one slice of tomato herb bread, sprinkled the mixture with cajun seasonings, covered it with soy cheddar, topped it with a another slice of bread and baked it in the oven.  It was awesome!  I could not keep my non-vegetarian husband away from them!  Thanks for a great, keeper recipe!

This is pretty close to a recipe from my diet page,(lost 55ibs. in 2 1/2 months), with the beans being mashed with a fork,  VERY little LF mayo, red onion, chopped cucumber, lemon juice, black pepper, & a bit of chopped flat-leaf parsley. The lemon juice help you to not need the salt. Really good stuff!

Just amazing.  What a great vegetarian meal.  You can also make it vegan by usin vegannaise.  I think it is essential to puree the chickpeas, and I added celery and subbed yellow onion for green onions becase it is what I had on hand.  Have been eating it all week and still love it!

Love this recipe!  Takes minutes to make and is so good on crackers, I could eat the whole batch in one sitting!  Doesn't taste like tuna salad to me, but since I don't like tuna salad all that much, that was not a bad thing!  I ran out of chick peas and tried with it white beans instead and it was good too.  Prefer the texture when I made with a potato masher as instead of in a food processor (and it was less clean up!)

This was pretty good and I can see how it resembles tuna.  When I first made it i tried mashing the beans with a potato masher to give a meatier texture.  That was kind of awful. The flavor was good, but it was very gritty.  I put the beans in a food processor next time and made it into a paste.  Then it was good! I added a little extra pickles and onions for texture and 2 boiled eggs! I really enjoyed it then! (P.S. I am not a vegetarian, I just try to not eat meat everyday)

It may have been some 14 years since I've had tuna salad, but I'm pretty sure it doesn't taste like this. Although, while I was making it, I had two cats sitting on the kitchen floor looking at me like they thought I was making something for them. Did my cats think it was tuna...?? Anyway, It LOOKS like tuna salad, tastes pretty good and is a great idea for lunches. I added some Old Bay and diced onion. If I make it again I will decrease the mustard a bit and try it with tangy mayo.

This was good! I used vegan mayo (Vegenaise) to make it vegan. I was quite surprised how similar in taste this was to tuna. It is very easy and quick to make so this will be on rotation throughout the week when I'm in a hurry. Even my omnivore boyfriend liked it too. Lastly, don't for once think it's going to taste EXACTLY like tuna it's just a subtle version. So don't be surprised when you make this and it doesn't taste just like tuna! It's made from beans!

I didn't have the highest of hopes when I made this...so I wasn't too disappointed after I tried it.  I made it according to the recipe, but mine came out rather dry and grainy.  It could have been the brand of chick peas I used.  I agree with another reviewer that this didn't taste like tuna.  I would rather put the tuna in here if I'm going to go through the process of making it. I guess for those who don't like "tuna" but like the other ingredients that go into a tuna salad..this is for you.  Thanks anyway.

It needed nori or Atlantic laver flakes (types of seaweed) to taste convincing.  Sometimes I use a little lemon juice instead of the mustard.  It's good either way.  I wonder if it would work using drained and crumbled tofu instead of chickpeas?

Homerun! I used non-fat plain greek yogurt instead of mayo, horseradish mustard instead of brown, and dill relish instead of sweet. The horseradish mustard adds a great little kick to this sandwich spread. I also added some finely diced carrots and celery for some added texture since I blended the chickpeas pretty smoothly. Served on a whole wheat bagel sandwich thin with some lettuce, tomato, red onion, and cucumber. I think that this one will become a lunchtime staple!

After being vegetarian for 11 years, one of the few things I still crave are tuna salad sandwiches!  Thanks for this great recipe.  It really hit the spot for me.  My husband didn't rate them as highly, but I loved them and will make them again the next time I get a craving for tuna salad! Thanks!

Quick, easy and very tasty.  I didn't have any spicy brown mustard, so I used
1 ts of dijon and 1 ts of yellow.   This recipe seems to be great base for creating
other recipes.  This is a keeper.

I'm not a chick pea fan, but this turned out pretty good (and it definitely does not taste like tuna!). I put the salad between two tortillas and heated it in the quesadilla maker. I found it to be a bit bland, but certainly easy and worth the trouble of trying.

Great recipe!  Gotta love mock tuna.  I microwave my drained chickpeas for 3 minutes first to make them easier to mash, and I add some Sriracha hotsauce to give it some bite.  I think the sweet pickle relish is a really important part of this... you could definitely add more or less mayo to your own tastes but the relish is what makes it taste like tuna.  Yum!  Thanks for the idea.

I can't believe how good this is!  I only added relish and mayo since that's all I had, and it was very much like tuna.  It will taste even better with the onion and lettuce on the sandwich.  This is my new favorite healthy meal!

I gave this to my meat eating boyfriend without telling him anything about it and he said. "Tastes like tuna. What is it?" Of course it doesn't taste "just like" tuna, but it does taste *like* tuna, and most importantly it just plain tastes good! One of my new favorite foods.

Awesome! Doesn't remind me of tuna, but it's sooooo good! I added minced garlic and lemon juice, used Miracle Whip instead of mayo...Great recipe idea!!

Made this several times served on toasted bread, also on Ritz Crackers. This does not taste anything like tuna, but after letting it chill overnight in the fridge, I found the next day, that this did smell a bit like tuna. When I assembled the ingredients together, first I used a potato masher to mash the chick peas, but I only used 1-(15.8 oz.) can of the chick peas. I then added 4 tablespoons of mayonnaise, 1-1/ 2 teaspoons of the spicy brown mustard, as I thought the 2 teaspoons was a bit too much, plus I added 3 tablespoons of the sweet pickle relish. I didn't have any green onions, so I just added 1 tablespoon of yellow minced onion, and I thought that was plenty of onion. I did add a dash of salt and pepper as well.  This a good replacement for tuna, and this does keep well for days in the refrigerator.

I just received this recipe in my email today and, since I had everything on hand to make it, mixed up a batch.  WOW, this is Great!!  Tuna Salad WITHOUT the "fishiness!"  Doesn't even taste "vegetarian" either!!  This is a keeper for sure!

I adore this recipe. As a fairly long time vegetarian, you occasionally get those cravings...
This one does very well for me as a base recipe.  Everybody will probably have their own preferences on spicing things, just like with potato salad.  the good news is that it's easy to tweak until you find what it is that YOU like. 
I prefer to just coarsely chop the chick peas to give it a little more body, and and also add some chopped celery for a little extra crunch.
I also mess around with spices a little here and there.  A little mustard seed, dill, cayanne pepper.
Good stuff.

I was surprised at how good this turned out.  A pastry blender/cutter makes mashing the beans a snap - much quicker than a fork.  The texture and color are close to tuna, if you don't look too closely.  The flavor is not exactly the same, but still pretty darn tasty.  What makes it taste like tuna is the combo of onion, pickle, mayo and mustard.  The chickpeas act as a vehicle for this flavor, so it works.  I only used part of one green onion, and it had plenty of onion flavor for me (I'm not a fan of onion breath, especially at work).  The spread was thick and held together really well - stayed in my sandwich neatly.  It is a little on the starchy side, but if you like hummus, this won't bother you.  If you start with dried chickpeas and soak/cook them first, this thing seriously costs just pennies.  But the canned beans are so convenient!  And you can't beat it for nutritional value.    I will make this again!

I'm not a vegetarian but I love garbanzo beans and I eat them all the time. Since I found this recipe I have been making this just like my tuna salad with mayo, celery, onion, a bit of relish, a squeeze of lemon, a little dry mustard, onion powder, salt and fresh ground pepper. It tastes even better if it sits overnight in the 'fridge. Today, I had some leftover chopped boiled eggs and I added those too...oh boy, is this good!! Thanks so much for the idea.

Mmm. I've been a vegetarian for four years and until now haven't found anything to substitute for tuna. The recipe is really adaptable- I make mine with dill pickles and celery, the way I had it growing up. My cat even likes it!

This was actually pretty good!  I found that it needed a bit more mayo.  I scooped the salad onto whole wheat english muffin halves, topped with sharp cheddar cheese, and placed under the broiler for a few minutes.  A delicious vegetarian "melt"!

Great tasting and inexpensive.  The only changes I made was to add pickle instead of the relish.  I also added a bit more mayo, and spiced it up with a bit of celery seed, dill, and garlic powder.  I would definately make this again.

LOVED IT! Can't remember what real tuna salad tastes like since I have been a vegetarian for so long, but this was really good.  You can have only so many veggie burgers and then want a change and this was it.  Very good!

Just got finished eating a sandwich made from this recipe. I agree that it doesn't really taste like tuna salad, but it IS reminiscent of tuna salad--however, I may try to work on the texture a little. I became a vegetarian over 5 years ago and earlier in my pregnancy I was REALLY craving tuna salad but did not give in. I feel like this recipe would have helped me out, but I didn't know it existed. I really liked it and will make it again. Thanks!  :)

It does have a taste and texture reminiscent of tuna salad if the beans are well mashed.   Not quite, but would make a fine substitute for a vegan.  In any case it makes a great sandwich spread, and a good way to put inexpensive, nutritious garbanzo beans to use.  4 stars, because 5 stars means it couldn't possibly be any better.

I've made it a few times since I first reviewed it.   I find it works out much better if you "hide" the beans a little more.  Not trying to fool anyone, but just to keep them from jumping out and announcing themselves.    Mash them very thoroughly, and then mash them some more.   Add a diced pickle, some onion powder, 1/2 tsp or so of curry and plenty of pepper.  Let the flavors marry for an hour or so if possible.

I'm a vegetarian too and was amazed at how good this is! I made a batch up, ate it as a sandwich and then used the rest  to make tuna noodle casserole the next night.  Great substitute! Although next time I wont add relish, that was a little strange in the casserole.    but this will be a new staple in the pantry! Very filling too.

WOW!! This was so yummy!! Just finished eating it for dinner. A great way to try chickpeas for the first time. I made it into a lettuce wrap with some tomato and red onion--perfect! I used plain yogurt in place of mayo,added some thai chiles,omitted the salt, and used dry chickpeas that I had cooked up instead of canned. Followed the recipe otherwise. You can pretty much do anything to it that you would normally do to tuna salad. Doesn't really taste like tuna but it definitely has the same consistency as tuna. Next time I will throw the chickpeas in my food processor instead of mashing. This was delicious, and I will keep chickpeas on hand all the time for a quick, yummy lunch. Thanks for sharing!!

Like others I agree this does not taste like tuna, but similar to tuna SALAD. I made it how I usually make tuna salad (no sweet pickle relish, but dill). I also put the cheakpeas in the blender and added a little water so it wasn't so dry. Overall a tasty sandwhich spread and a decent alternative to tuna SALAD.

I used dijon mustard instead of spicy and minced red onions instead of green ones. I also added 12-15 capers, chopped cilantro, and chopped dill pickle instead of the relish. It was fantastic! The flavor was very close to tuna fish... maybe even better. The texture was not quite right, although not unpleasant... maybe if the beans were pureed it would be closer? All the same, a great substitute or even replacement for tuna salad.

It's ok, I still would prefer tuna.  However, not bad, just quite bland, but here is a tip, double the salt, and add a few dashes of hot sauce.  I kept the left overs in the fridge and made a sandwich for my husband 2 days later, and he seemed to like it, (and he's pretty picky), so I tasted it again and you know what...it was better.  I think the flavors mix better if it is left overnight.  Good Luck!

Loved this recipe. It really does take an awful like tuna! It is also just as good using a light mayo., which decreases the calorie content down to 174 per serving. I like to add a little paprika also.

This recipe doesn't quite taste like tuna but it's close enough. Next time I'm going to take out the relish and add celery to it instead. It was hard to mash the chickpeas. I loved this recipe, though, and will make it again soon.

I thought this was absolutely delicious and very easy to make. I had it wrapped up in a tortilla for a nice 2 point snack (I had 2 the first time I made it, so it's good!) Wonderful and thank you for the recipe! A keeper for sure ;)

I tried this recipe today.  I really liked it but to my surprise my children loved it. They are 9&11 and both do not like egg salad or tuna salad sandwiches. I will definitely make this again.
I used Dijon mustard.

No, this doesn't replicate tuna like I remember it, but it'll do!  Very tasty, very quick.  I added garlic powder and used regular minced onions.  I'm not a garbanzo bean fan, and neither is my family.  Try making a Melted Mock Tuna, open face, with regular or soy cheese!

Oh!  It's good...and that's coming from someone who had Chick Peas on the list of DIS-likes.  LOVED it.  Actually, improvised on the recipe 'cause I couldn't find it to use, but was really, really good.  On a Kaiser with the "fixin's"...YUM!

VERY good mock tuna salad, I have made few iterations of mock tuna salad and this one tastes the closest to the real deal!  I also add black olives personally which adds a nice saltiness to this already perfect recipe.

AWesOme!! I added fresh dill, vegan mayo, fresh lemon juice, and some paprika. I'm so glad to have this now!! I also processed the beans really well until crumbly. The mixture consistency is similar to deviled egg filling or egg salad.

I used a pastry cutter to rough cut the garbanzo beans so they would still have some texture.   I left  out the mustard but will be trying different types in the future.  I did add my usual celery and white onion.  Served on Korean  Pop-Pan (spring onion flavor) crackers with red leaf lettuce  and garnished with green onion tops.  I'm thinking minced jalapeno sounds like a good addition. Edit: made with spicy deli mustard, added broiled Swiss cheese and half a diced avocado then drizzled with horseradish sauce.

Followed the recipe exactly and this is delicious!  I've been vegetarian for 15 years so I think this tastes like tuna salad.  My husband just converted a year ago and says it doesn't taste like tuna but we both agree this recipe is fantastic on toast or saltines.  Nice job - thanks for sharing!

WOW!!  I had an overabundance fo chickpeas in my pantry because I love to make homemade hummus.  I came across this & decided to try it and WOW!  It is awesome!  I increased mayo, mustard & such and used dill relish because I prefer it.  This is really delicious and goes together so quickly and easily!  ANd without the tuna "fishy" smell that I loathe.  Love, love, love this!!

Great!  I didn't have all the ingredients so used regular onion, honey mustard instead of spicy, light mayo and no relish.  I added a little garlic salt. It was extremely tasty -- I will have garbanzo beans on my weekly grocery list for this recipe.

This was fantastic.  Typically I don't like sweet pickle relish, but it tasted great in this recipe.  The mock tuna salad tasted like gas station tuna salad, which I am sorry to say, I actually used to enjoy on occasion.

I wish I could give this 10 stars. I love this recipe. I made a huge batch this time, using about 2/3 a pound of garbanzo beans. I soaked and cooked them myself. I put the garbanzo beans in the food processor first until they are very smooth, then I build the rest. I added 4 stalks of celery and half of a white onion instead of green onions. It did taste quite a bit like tuna salad and was as easy as it gets and super cheap!!!

i am vegetarian so i still use eggs and prepared this as i would have tuna salad with  miracle whip, eggs, relish, as my basics  i did experiment with the mustard, salt and seasoned salt - and will try green onions next time - my fam thought they were eating the real thing and thoroughly enjoyed it  Can be used as a dip or when eating as sandwich try placing a slice or two of tomato and yum yum  thank u  its pretty economical too better than buying meat substitutes for your childs lunch etc . . .

GET OUT!  What a wonderful surprise.  Just as flavorful and less expensive than tuna.  Used your favorite tuna salad mix-ins.  I used chopped celery and sweet pickle, grated white onion, honey dijon mustard, mayo, curry powder and dill weed.  Do microwave your beans briefly to warm.  This makes the beans easier to mash.  Then mix to your desired consistency.  Even my 13 year-old (who despises tuna/mayo) wants me to make more.  Such a great versatile recipe and can even be used as an extender for tuna salad if you really want the fish factor.

I followed the recipe making changes for ingredients I didn't have: dijon mustard for spicy brown and minced sweet pickles for sweet relish (which I haven't been able to find in Spain - sob!), and used low fat mayo for a lighter version.  I used fresh chickpeas rather than canned but I'm sure canned would be good too.  I put the chickpeas in my hand blender attachment for chopping and mixing.  Transferred to a bowl then mixed in all the other ingredients.  It's so simple, fast and tastes great.  I usually serve it inside a pita with lettuce, tomato and such.  Thank you so much for this recipe!  It deserves more than 5 stars!

Delicious! Easy! Healthy! What more could a person want. I use chap red onion because I love em. Also, Canola Mayo. I've been gradually switching to a Vegitarian diet and finding things to brown bag to work has been a challenge. This is perfect.

I don't care what you call this dip, it is just delicious. It does remind me of tuna and/or egg salad, both of which are great, but not always very healthy. But this dip is great on bread or as a dip. Right now I can't get enough of it and the best thing, it took less than 5 minutes to make.

YUM!  I made this as is the first time, but I think next time I might add some boiled eggs.  I love tuna salad, but sometimes the fishy-ness of it gets to me.  This is a great alternative.

This was really really descent. It was very very good. At 1st I was worried about the spicy brown mustard. But fear no more. Then I got to the part about sweet pickles...I didn't have any nor did I have sweet pickle relish. Since I normally do not use either in cooking, baking or mixing. I opted for dill pickle relish. I did use low fat Mayonnaise verses regular mayo. All in all great mix. Excellent alternative for tuna...I like tuna, but tend to get fuller faster when eating it. This was light and not a heavy dish. And is was also a great alternative to egg salad I thought. I could diffently see adding a ranch powder mix to it and or mix in some heat to it as well and also adding celery. I will make this again because of the simiplicity of the recipe, ingredients and time. I always have these ingredients on hand and this is a great lunch bag item. Thanks very much.

This was great! It's been so long, so I couldn't tell if it tasted more like egg salad or tuna salad. Either way it was very good. The only changes we made were to add some celery (threw half a stalk in the food processor, then mixed in), salt and ground black pepper. Made a sandwich with toasted bread, adding red onion & tomato slices.

Loved it.  Didn't have relish so I put in capers and a small amount of raw sugar and some red onion.  I loved it...thanks for the recipe.

This is good stuff but it does NOT taste like tuna salad - not any tuna salad that I've ever had or made at any rate.  That being said, I really do like this.  I finely chop the chickpeas in my food processor and then just start adding stuff.  I followed the directions the first time, but since then I usually add the stuff I use to make chicken salad - mayo, white pepper, celery seed, a squirt of lemon juice and sometimes walnuts and dried cranberries.  Really really good stuff.  Thanks for the recipe!

I had high hopes for this recipe because I love tuna salad, but this was rather bland. I followed directions exactly, and mine only tasted like mashed up chickpeas.

This tastes especially good on crackers.  I used a chopped yellow onion instead of the green, subbed miracle whip for the mayo, and added celery for some crunch with a splash of lemon juice and a bit of cajun seasoning to give it a little fishy flavor!

This is a 10 star rating, if we could rate it that high!  I can't believe how delicious this was.  It does have a tuna fish consistency and somewhat tastes like it, but it is 10 times better.  I love the fact that this is better for you and doesn't have the fishy taste to it that sometimes makes me not want to eat tuna, even though I like it.  Even my husband who isn't into my vegetarian recipes loved it.  The only slight differences I made were to leave out the green onion, because I don't like onion in my tuna, added celery and put the pickles on the sandwich instead of the relish, because that's what I had on hand.  I believe that I may never buy tuna again now that I found this recipe.

I made this recipe and stuffed it into pita pockets lined with green leaf lettuce and topped the "mock tuna" or garbonzo bean salad with tzatziki. It was delicious and moistened it up nicely and the garlic made it even better!

Amazing! It DOES taste much like the tuna salad I remember Mom making, but I've also been a vegetarian for 20 years, so perhaps taste memory has faded. However, the texture is definitely like tuna salad (I did mash the garbanzos with a fork a bit), and the flavor of the other ingredients pushes it to the top of my "repeat" file! My only addition to the recipe was another tablespoon of mayo and relish, for added smoothness and a little more crunch. Serve with Ritz crackers as a snack!

I must admit, I was VERY skeptical about trying this recipe, but I am so happy that I did. I didn't have green onions, so I used onion powder & it was fantastic. Shocking how it tastes like tuna. Thanks so much!

Fantastic; my boyfriend feels sorry for tuna and I just don't like it, but both of us adored this recipe.  I actually added flour (weird I know) at the end because it was awfully liquidy.  Cornstarch would work too, to make it spreadable on a sandwich.

This was absolutely superb!!! I simmered the chickpeas first in some chicken broth with some salt and pepper, for about 6-7 minutes, and then drained and mashed them.

I used a horseradish-based mustard and low-fat mayo and some chopped red onion. I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT HOW GOOD THIS WAS!!!

Incidentally, I felt like I was eating something more akin to egg salad or potato salad than tuna salad but who cares right?

YOU MUST GIVE THIS A TRY!!!

Really, really good.  Doesn't taste like tuna FISH per se, but tastes an awful lot like tuna SALAD as it's normally made; a point that seems to be lost in some reviews.

Made this twice this week; had to substitute yellow mustard for the brown and it was still fantastic.  A new regular in our rotation.  Thanks.

I'm a vegetarian so this was such a relief from my usual cheese sandwich. I don't know how much it tastes like tuna (it's been that long) but it definitly had a good flavor. I added one crushed garlic clove and a little chopped celery. I spread it onto a large whole wheat tortilla, added some baby romaine leaves and thinly sliced tomatoes, and then rolled it up and sliced it into 1 inch thick "Pinwheels".  After a little chilling in the fridge my "finger sandwiches" were ready to eat...and delicious!

DELICIOUS!!! One of the best and easiest vegetarian recipes ever. I use egg free mayonnaise. Awsome as a sandwich or bagel spread. It does not taste like tuna at all but if you want a fishy taste, you can add a little bit of kelp to it.

I like the taste of this recipe.  Also, someone mentioned that they used their blender or food processor to make it -- don't do that!  I tried it and all the blended chickpeas stuck to the bottom and blocked the blades from mixing anything else.  It was a real mess to clean up.  Next time I make it, I'm just going to mash the chickpeas like it says, and add more relish.  Other than that, it was very good.

This is a quick, easy, and filling sandwich.  I varied it to my own tastes (mayo only with chopped onion and dill pickle), and it was delicious!  I found the suggestion from another reviewer to use a potato masher to mash the chickpeas worked VERY well.   Even my tuna-hating boyfriend loved this.  It doesn't remind me a whole lot like what I remember tuna to taste like, but that is a good thing!!  :)

If you didn't know better, you'd swear that this was tuna fish.  It's even better after it's sat in the fridge overnight.  I followed the recipe exactly the first time and it was great, but the second time I made it, I followed my family recipe using the beans instead of the tuna and I could hardly tell the difference. It's great but make sure that you mash the beans really well.

This was absolutely yummy!  I agree that it's nothing like tuna.  It's delicious in its own right.  I made it for a party to have with crackers and pita bread and everyone raved about it and asked for the recipe.

Ewwwwwwww. I admitt I am not a vegetarian, but there are many meat-alternative foods that I totally dig. This was disgusting to me, two toddlers (who love broccoli), a nine year-old boy who eats ANYTHING and EVERYTHING! , and everybody else. People, if you think this taste like tuna, you have gone w/o the real thing for way too long!!! Gross is my oppinion. Sorry

I became a vegetarian seven years ago and still get a craving for tuna. The Mock Tuna Salad certainly did the trick in satisfying my craving. Not only does it taste GREAT, but it also quick and simple, which is always an added PLUS!

This was very delicious. A combination between "tuna" and "egg" salad. Yumm! One adjustment I made was to use 2 T of blended silken tofu in place of the mayo. Less fat and added protein :) My four year old daughter loves garbanzo beans, so she loved this. Will definitely make this one again!!

I agree that it's a lot like egg salad as well as tuna.  I loved it with dill pickle and celery!!  Even my sister who hates chickpeas loved it!!

This was great, a real keeper! When I first made it, it tasted like egg salad and then it did taste more like tuna.  Much better than tuna because you can keep it longer than a day without it smelling "fishy".

Very simple and tasty.  If you want a slight fishy flavor add dulse or kelp granules or crumble some nori into the mix.  I added dulse and it made it more reminiscent of tuna salad.  I'll be making it again.

I've been a vegetarian for about 20 years and did miss tuna melts and sandwiches.  I was skeptical of this recipe but am certainly glad I tried it!  It will not taste exactly like tuna salad if that is what you are looking for but is definitely a great replacement if you don't eat tuna or want to try something a little different.  I used my potato masher to mash up the chickpeas and that works pretty well.  Can add whatever ingredients you would normally add to tuna salad in the ratio you desire.  I've made twice in the last couple of weeks and it is great for lunch!

This is unbelievable.  I would never have thought that chick peas would taste like tuna fish.  It is incredible.  I'm new to the vegan world and have been so worried about how I would manage taking lunch to work, especially when you have to walk a mile to find a microwave.  Thank you so much.  I didn't make any changes to the recipe.  Next time, I will add some green peppers.  This is my go to from now on.

It's crazy how much this tastes exactly like tuna!  My BF who needs meat/protein at every meal is even a fan.  This is a weekly staple in our lunch menu.  Easy to make and transport to work without the fishy smell of tuna.

I've had this recipe bookmarked for ages, wanting to try it but afraid I'd end up with a pickle-y hummus.  Silly me!  There is something really remarkably like tuna salad to this concoction, even though I had to make some substitutions based on what I had on hand (diced dill pickle with a bit of honey for pickle relish, yellow onion for green).  I think next time I might add some diced celery.

Loved this, and it is very easy to modify depending on what you have/like. I added celery, green onion, dill pickles, dijon and vegeneaisse after mashing with potato masher. Perfect in a sandwich or wrap and by itself. yummy inexpensive healthy veggie recipe. THis definitely cures any tuna cravings I sometimes have.

I made this as written the first time, and it was really really good.  I think it is more reminiscent of egg salad than tuna salad, but it was delicious and gave me the protein I was craving.  I made it again a second time, and added some powdered ranch dressing, a little bit of cayenne pepper, some horseradish mustard and and it was still delicious.  I think you can add and take away whatever you want to make it "your own." Very forgiving recipe and super easy and yummy!

I agree with other comments that, while this a decent recipe it doesn't taste like tuna, so you might not want to have that expecation going in.  Maybe because it hasn't been all that long since I've been a vegetarian that I can still easily remember the taste of tuna? I dunno, either way it's still good though and made for a nice sandwich.  I followed the recipe almost exactly (except for the relish) and thoroughly mashed the beans with a fork which was easy enough for me (thought I might have to put in a food processor after reading other comments).  This made for a fairly good lunch and I might make it again.  I say might because I wasn't totally blown away by it.

I completely tweaked this recipe and it was pretty descent. There is a similar recipe on the site, but it uses lots of celery and onion and I was looking for one that didn't. I used only 1 Tblsp. of lite mayo, left out the mustard and relish, and used some minced red onion in place of the green onion. I also mashed in one avacado after seeing a recipe on-line that combined the two to stretch the recipe. I ate it on oatmeal bread. It was very filling.

This is SO tasty! I've been a vegetarian for 10 years and have never tried something like this. I blended it all in my food processor and it turned out great! I used dijon mustard because that's all I had...spicy and delish served on toast. This makes about 4 sandwhiches for me!

Fantastic.  My husband, the meat lover, loved this.  In my opinion it has 1 teaspoon too many of mustard, but otherwise, it's going to be a staple in our diet.  Thank you!!

This was good!  I get so tired of eating the same stuff for lunch all the time, so it was nice to see a healthy, meatless alternative that was a little different.  It was pretty tasty too--I'll definitely be making it again--I made a sandwich out of it with lettuce and tomato.

This is just amazing!  I was a bit sceptical at first, but I am a gluten free ovo-vegan and I was missing tuna so much!  I'm veggie by choice but dairy free gluten free by needs!  This was absolutely wonderful.  This will be my staple lunch from now on.  It was so easy, and I blended mine up in a food processor for good measure, plus that way you don't have to cut onion.  I used red onion instead of green since tuna salad isn't tuna salad without red onion for me, and I didn't have relish so I had to skip that, but it is just divine!  My mouth is salivating at the thought of the yummy sandwich I'll be munching on in a couple minutes!

Delicious! I love tuna salad, and this would never be a replacement for that, but it is super-tasty and a great new option for lunch. I tasted it after following the directions (using a potato masher for the beans as recommended by a few reviewers), and it was excellent. Then I decided to modify it a bit for my tastes. I added curry powder--probably 1/2 tsp or so--and some toasted sesame seeds and I am very happy with the results. Great recipe!

Wow!  I cannot believe how much I liked this.  I love tuna salad and am not vegetarian, but like some variety in foods.  I'm not a huge fan of chickpeas usually so I was wary.  I really enjoyed this on a toasted pita.  So good!

Great vegetarian lunch! Mashing all the beans with the fork was hard, but definitely worth the effort. (I probably burned off enough calories for what I was about to eat. Seriously.) I didn't use the sweet pickle relish because I'm not a fan of it, but other than that I followed the recipe to a tee. We had ours in lettuce wraps aside a bowl of cold cucumber soup. Delicious!

This dish wasn't bad but it was interesting. Very tangy and more of the consistency of potato salad than tuna. Not bad, but probably nothing I would crave again.

While this doesn't really taste like tuna salad to me, I do love it. Lots. Inexpensive and a decent source of protein. I mash the beans with a fork rather than using a blender because I enjoy the texture. Yummmmmm

I did not expect to like this, but I loved it!!  Had it for dinner last night and again for lunch today. 
I use low sodium chickpeas and I rinse them off before making the salad. I also used a garlic mustard. I intend to serve this to friends:)

Really love this recipe! I used a potato masher to get "tuna" consistency but a pastry cutter might work even better. The flavors make for just the right amount of tanginess. I definitely wouldn't leave out the green onions -- they give great flavor.

Amazing! I am not a vegetarian, but I love chick peas and this recipe intrigued me. I will definitely make again. My kids liked it as well. I substituted a 1/2 tsp. dry mustard for the spicy brown mustard and used a small white onion in place of the green onions. I also added two hard boiled eggs and some diced celery. Delicious! Thanks for sharing!

I am a new vegetarian and I was very skeptical about this recipe.  I followed recipe (except used  finely chopped white onion and some chopped celery) and it was fantastic.  I was truly amazed that even my picky husband liked it.  We put it on whole wheat sandwich rounds with lettuce and tomato, I will be making this many times in the future.

Good recipe - I have been vegetarian a long time so I don't know what tuna tastes like but it seemed similar to what I would guess.  I used light mayo and will put salt, pepper and powdered mustard next time.  Celery may give it a crispier texture and would probably be good too.

wow. This is so good! I can hardly believe it's as tasty as it is.  I highly recommend this recipe.  I added dill pickle relish, chopped celery heart and leaves, and some finely minced red onion instead of the green. Amazingly good, i'm so glad it made plenty, I'm looking forward to having this for lunch again tomorrow. p.s. my can was only 15 ounces.

wow -- who knew!!! i was skeptical this would truly remind me of tuna salad, but it DID! I occaisonally do a 21 day cleanse and don't eat any animal products, sugar, caffeine, alcohol, gluten (yeah, sounds fun!!!) so this satisfied my cravings on many levels...i've also tried the version made with tempeh as well...not sure which is my fave!

Pretty good :). I spread the mixture onto pieces of bread, covered them with cheese, and made a sort of "Mock Tuna Melt". I have been a vegetarian for 9 yrs and didn't think this tasted like the tuna I rememberd. However, I very much enjoyed the taste and will make it again.  I should probably say I used yellow mustard instead of spicy brown and I think that may have been a mistake. Next time I will use spicy brown mustard.

Wonderfully delicious and healthy! I did not expect a true tuna taste, but was surprised by the similarity (most likely from the relish). Tasty additions include garlic, white onion and green pepper.

Absolutely scrumptious!!! I've been vegetarian for 9 years and I sometimes craved tuna- this is so delicious and filling! I prepared it just as I would have prepared tuna in the past, with mayo, finely diced celery and tomato. It tastes so tuna-like that my fiance who hates tuna won't eat this.

This was good as far as texture goes, but has WAY too much mustard. I will try to make it again, but will leave out the mustard entirely. I also added a bunch of other veggies- but mostly it was to try to cut the mustard taste

Loved this!! I printed it out a year ago, but never actually tried it til now. The texture is a little different than real tuna, but other than that it was right on. I tweaked a little to suit my preferences - dill relish instead of sweet, onion powder instead of actual onion, added celery salt, etc - and you can definitely do the same. Very good and definitely worth trying, even if you're skeptical like I was.

I would call this more of a mock egg salad then a tuna salad. Took me a few to figure out what to use to mash the beans, ended up doing so with a pastry cutter. Added a bit of mayo, spicy mustard, pickle relish and red onion. Really enjoyed it and as cheap as I can get a can of Garbanzo beans at Wal Mart, think I'm be making this often. Thanks for the great recipe. Always nice to have something different for lunch!

I really enjoyed this dish.  I followed this recipe exactly except I used fat free sour cream instead of mayo.  This is just a trick I use to cut fat and calories in all recipes that call for mayo.

Love it!  (I agree that it doesn't taste like tuna - but who cares - it's Yummy!)  I  mashed the chickpeas with a fork for texture, added helman's olive oil mayo, dill, garlic powder, curry and a little bit of pickle juice (I don't like sweet relish).  Then I added a piece of cheddar and two pieces of bread and made a tuna melt on my George Forman grill - Yummmmm

I don't know that I would say that it's like tuna, I think it's better. Im not a big fan of tuna salad myself, but I do love chick peas. I drained the beans and mashed them with a potato ricer. They pop out of the skins and I thought about picking the skins out, but ended up leaving them in. I followed the rest of the recipe to a t-(almost- I don't like sweet pickles, so I ended up dicing a dill pickle)  and it's wonderful. I ate it plain with a sliced tomato and thought it was wonderful. Thanks for a healthy lunch/snack option.

It's not exactly like tuna salad, but it's very good, extremely easy and quick to make.  I make it and take it to work so I can make sandwiches the rest of the week with it.  A very economical lunch plan.

Hmmm. Well, I am not a vegetarian, but my sister is and I also passed this on to her. Now that we've both tried it, here's what I'd say. The texture is a little strange, but I think once you get used to it it's ok. I think next time I will do more of  puree to it. My sister felt like there was just something lacking, but overall we both thought it was ok. I think it reminded me more of egg salad than tuna but it is definitely a creative new idea for lunch with a different way to get my nutrients. Thanks for sharing!

Holy cow! This was totally freaking AMAZING! Thanks for the recipe NICE_GIRL1965!! I have not eaten meat in 6+ years but I used to *LOVE* tuna salad sandwiches. That's long enough time for my taste buds to be fooled because to me this tasted just like real tuna salad! I didn't change much in the recipe. I like a little crunch so I added chopped celery and in addition to the green onions I also used some little chopped pieces of white onions as well as replacing regular mayo with Vegenaise (tastes just the same as regular mayo). A previous reviewer mentioned using a potato masher instead of a blender if texture was desired, so I did. I really didn't want it to be smooth-ish. With the potato masher it had an awesome consistency. VERY tuna salad like! It was so easy and incredibly delicious. I'll be making it many, many times to come for sure!

Wow... I should have put the bean in a food processor. The beans were a pain to mash IMO. I also added more mayo, and relish. After those additions, this was a great recipe. I ate these on FlipSides cracker, and it was pure bliss.

While the taste does vaguely resemble tuna salad, it's certainly not a "mock" tuna salad. It is it's own entity, and a delicious one at that. I did not have onions on hand and had to omit them, but everything else was followed to a T. I'm sure it would be even better with the green onions incorporated. It's absolutely fantastic with bread, particularly hot homemade or bakery bread, but even the bagged loaf from the corner store is fine. This salad is also great on its own, eaten right from the bowl. You can't really go wrong here. Yum!

Oh my goodness!  I have to admit I was skeptical - but this is REALLY FANTASTIC! It tastes just like tuna salad! (and yes, I still eat real tuna salad - this isn't a strict vegetarian talking).  I'm so happy to have this recipe!  Thanks!

Amazing! And quite frankly, its a little creepy that chickpeas can be made to taste like tuna, but boy am I glad they can be! I skipped the mustard, added mayo to tasted an subbed about two dill pickle slices, chopped, for the sweet relish. Awesome recipe!

I really liked this mock tuna recipe. I made some chages to reflect what my normal tuna salad has in it, such as celery and chopped green olives.  Everyone has an idea of what tuna salad should taste like, so my advice is to incorperate your own personal tuna salad ingredients into this recipe.  Then it will taste more like the "real" thing to you.  I would have never thought of using garbanzo beans to replace tuna, but it is a healthy alternative, (no mercury), less expensive, and it works!!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I havent ate meat/fish in 22 years so I couldent tell you if this tastes like tuna but I can say this is better then other chick pea sandwitch spreads I have made.I added extra mayo and some sea salt.I also heat the chick peas for 45sec.to make it easyer to mash them,put it on toasted bread verry good sandwitch!

eh it was ok, by no means fantastic, but edible. I had to add more mayo, plus garlic powder and cumin to make it taste of something. If that isn't your thing, I would add more relish. It was a rather dry and tasteless mix.But would make good dip with a nice flavour crisps or tortilla chips.

This is the first time I've ever rated a recipe with 1 star!  This did not taste at all like tuna salad to me.  I did however leave out the relish and the green onion..but I doubt that it would have made any difference.  The consistency is more like that of Hummus..which I LOVEe..but it tastes nothing like Hummus..  I can't wait to have real tuna salad again after I have my baby!!  I won't make this again.

This recipe has been a staple of my vegetarian life for years.  I have recently started making it with low-fat plain yogurt instead of mayo.  I prefer the texture over  mayo now!  I also like to add celery to this.  And sometimes I put a dash of curry sauce in it for days when I am feeling like something spicey!  Great as a sandwich or spread on crackers, or even as a topper over a nice salad!

I was looking for new and different recipes. This isn't a bad recipe but I don't think it tasted like tuna and it was really gritty. I think I am going to saute it up like a potato pancake because I can't eat it on bread like I would tuna.

I thought this would make a good spread, so I was really surprised that it actually did taste very similar to a tuna salad.  The only change I made is that my can of chickpeas was only 12oz.  I served mine on wheat crackers with extra chopped scallions on top.  This is a great vegetarian alternative.  I will definitely make it again.

Great-tasting, quick, and inexpensive. I use a little more mayo and add extra things according to what I have on hand. Some off my favorite add-ins are diced bell peppers and chopped green olives. Wonderful on toast, in pita, or even with chips!

Chickpeas have always been a favorite of ours.  I only subbed Dijon for the Spicy Brown.  Other than that, I made it as per the recipe.  It didn't but it kind of did taste like tuna salad.  It's a good way to get more fiber.  We enjoyed this!

Very good.  It actually does taste like tuna salad to me (minus the fishy taste, of course!).  I used a couple pickle spears instead of sweat relish, and I didn't have green onions, so I added parsley, garlic and onion powders, and it was good.  Taking it to work on a sandwich tomorrow and I won't have to worry about the office smelling of tuna.  Thanks for this quick and easy recipe!

I have always loved cickpeas. I add them to my salads for extra fiber and taste. I made this with less mayo then called for and stuffed a pita along with lettuce and tomato. Very tasty, healthy, and fast.

The family was having tuna melts today and my vegetarian daughter was here so I whipped this up in a food prossesor for her.  She never liked tuna, but liked this, heated through with tomato and melted cheddar on whole wheat toast.  She is taking the leftover to work tomorrow with crackers.

This is great.  Trying to get more low fat alternatives into our diet.  Used low fat mayo and red instead of green onion.  Served open faced on english muffins. I can already see jazzing it up with sliced grapes and some chopped pecans.  Thanks for the recipe.  Oh...the food processor made quick work of the recipe.

I didn't think it tasted much like tuna salad (although my vegetarian sister, whom I made it for, said it did- then again, she's probably forgotten what tuna tastes like by now), but I thought it was pretty good anyway (and she loved it).

WOW! This recipe is very impressive. I've been a vegetarian for almost 3 years and I never would have thought garbanzo beans could taste like tuna! I drained and washed the beans before I mashed them.  This recipe is also great because it can be made vegan with ease. Next time, I may add celery to it too! I've actually had the ingredients to make this recipe for about a month now, but I've been too afraid to try it. I'm so glad I did! This recipe is going into my personal recipe book! Thank You for sharing this great recipe!

I love eating healthy so I gave this a try. I think the phrase "mock tuna" give the wrong impression since this tastes so different from tuna. I followed the recipe exactly and thought it came out a little dry. I have found I prefer other veggie sandwich options much more palatable.

I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this. It doesn't taste like tuna but it is full of protein and tastes good. Per previous reviewers, I let it sit overnight before eating. I enjoyed it as a sandwich and on a salad.

Much to my pleasure, this turned out very good.  I followed the recipe exactly.  And the addition of the sweet pickle relish, really DID give it a tuna salad like taste.  Although not exactly, I think it was just as good with a softer consistancy.  Great for a pita!

This was SO good! I can't wait for my vegetarian daughter to come home and try it!! I used lite mayo, a little bit of Miracle Whip, a small tsp. of horseradish in addition to the ingredients listed. I put in on a whole wheat english muffin with lettuce and thin sliced cucumber. (I would have added tomato but I didn't have any! I think regular onion would have worked just as well...or celery if you're not an onion person. You HAVE to try this!

This recipe was SO fantastic and so incredibly easy.  I can't even scramble eggs, but I finished this in about 10 minutes.  I haven't eaten tuna in 13 years so I have no idea what this is supposed to taste like.  However, I thought it was great, and I loved the texture (use a fork and some elbow grease).  Thank you for adding a new recipe to my weekly lunch menu!!!

Fast and easy to make with ingredients that are always on hand.  I've made a "tuna" melt every day since finding this recipe last week.  It does taste similar to tuna without the fishy smell and flavor.  Thanks for the recipe!

What a wonderful recipe. I hate tuna fish with a passion so I dont know how comparable it is with that. But the taste of this salad/spread is just amazing. And so quick and simple. I added a dash of paprika and used finely chopped red onions instead of the green onions.  I will try using a substitute for mayo next time to make this healthier. Great recipe!

This was great! I left it a little chucky and found it perfect this way. I thought it tasted a little like tuna at first but by the second bite it was just a good meal.

WOW.  This was the best sandwich spread I've had in the five years I've been a vegetarian.  I've tried making tuna salad with the soy tuna, and it was never bad but never really that good.  After I made a bowl of this stuff, I could hardly keep myself from eating it straight out of the bowl with a spoon.  I thought it really did taste a lot like tuna, without the fishy taste - but I haven't had tuna in five years, so I might be deceived,  No matter - it was good!  I did alter the recipe a little:
I used miracle whip instead of mayo, I left out the green onions, and I added one small apple diced which gives it a really great crunch.  This spread will be replacing hummus in my lunches!

The recipe doesn't mention it, but it should be pretty obvious that you have to mash up the chickpeas with a fork. That gives them a very similar texture to tuna. The color is comparable as well, although the taste isn't quite the same. I eat real tuna, but I've found this is a great way to use up leftover chickpeas after hummus or falafel gets old.

What a clever idea!!!  I'm pregnant, on a high protein diet, and I also can't eat tuna fish (due to mercury concerns) so this is a great, high-protein way to make a healthy sandwich!  It does taste just like tuna salad except without the "fishy" taste.  My kids love this too, and I imagine this would be great for kids who don't like tuna.

The texture is not quite tuna, but the taste is EXCELLENT.  I think I actually prefer this to tuna, it's low fat, low calorie, and doesn't make the whole kitchen reek of fish.  Thanks for sharing!

ohmigod.  who knew how *good* this could be?  it smelled more like tuna than it tastes, but that is fine, 'cause it tastes absolutely amazing.

i used another cook's suggestion of not rinsing the beans, and i also added a dash of lemon juice and was a bit heavy on the paprika.  as a side note, this is also good with a dash of cumin, but it changes the flavor significantly enough to be more hummus-like.

*thank you* for this recipe!  it will be my new staple!

Very yummy!!! Make sure you mash the garbanzos very well and get creative with what you add to it, if you want. I was very reserved on my first time, but will add more next time. And I agree with others, it's even better the next day. Very filling.

This reminds me of summer days, Lemonade stands and coming home with green knees.  It doesn't really taste like tuna per se, but since it has all the other ingredients in it, your mind can easily make the leap.  Fun and easy!

I thought this was great. It doesn't taste exactly like tuna, but that's good, because I don't love tuna. It does taste kind of reminiscent of tuna though. I used low fat mayo but otherwise followed the recipe exactly (though I added some garlic salt), and found it to be quite tasty on marble rye. A great way to get some beans into my diet, high in protein and fiber with alot of nutritional value, not alot of saturated fat! Yum.

I too love this recipe.  I first made it at home over the summer, and it's so simple I can make it in my dorm room at school.  The only thing that had me edgy was sodium content.  My problem was solved when I went to make it and found we had no relish (I'd been using dill, by the way), so I made it anyway and found that it still tastes great-- one less thing for me to keep in my tiny college-girl refrigerator!  My latest bravery involved relacing the light mayo I'd been using, with plain non-fat yogurt.  I thought sure this would 86 the taste but it doesn't!  That's right-- it's the chickpeas giving it all that flavor.  These alterations knock some of that unwanted salt and preservatives outta there.  I use honey mustard and a lot more green onions-- tastes great!!!

My kittens were meowing like crazy as soon as I opened the can of garbanzo beans.  I've never had them before and I'm pleasantly surprised at how much this recipe actaully tasted like tuna!  Even my husband liked it, and he's the pickiest vegetarian I've ever known!

I am someone who gags at the thought of eating any legume other than frenched green beans. This spread is awesome! I whipped it up in my mini food processor in a matter of seconds. It tastes more like egg salad than tuna salad but the flavor is unique (I don't like egg salad either but I loved this!) Skeptics must try this before passing judgement. Thanks for a great recipe, Carole!

A great recipe that's easy to adapt to individual tastes - I added chopped celery and jalepenos since I didn't have any relish on hand. It's great in sandwiches or on toast, I'll probably make it a lot.

A very delicious spread!  It looked more like "mock egg salad" than mock tuna salad, though.  It did not taste like tuna to me, but it was very good in its own way.  I added finely chopped celery for some crunch and substituted chives for green onions and classic yellow mustard for spicy mustard, and it turned out great.  I would definitely make this again, especially when I have a taste for an egg or tuna salad sandwich but do not want to feel guilty afterwards.

No, this did not taste like tuna, but it was good in its own right. Very easy to make, I stuffed it in a pita and topped with lettuce. It probaly is one of those make once but dont keep recipes.

The only bad thing is that if you don't use mayonnaise, it falls out of your sandwich.

This is great, because you can customize it for a variety of flavors. I made two versions. The first was this recipe exactly except a swap for vegan mayo and chow chow instead of sweet relish. I added some dill and a bit of juice from a jar of dill pickles to give enough moisture to cut back on amount of mayo and also some Dijon mustard on top of the spicy brown. It reminded me of a dressing I make to marinade chicken or salmon in. It was delicious! Also, made one swapping the relish with celery.. a bit of vegan mayo and lite ranch and a good pour of franks red hot sauce for a buffalo “chicken” wrap. SO good!

Good basic recipe. I enjoyed it more after a few enhancements: finely diced onion and celery, minced garlic, some fresh dill, and a splash of soy sauce. I opt for light mayo to cut calories, or Veganaise if making it vegan. Super good as a sandwich or on its own!

This is excellent!  I served on lettuce leaves, but you could use Hawaiian buns too.  I added the nori on the advice of another reviewer and it is a MUST.  I agree with most that it is closer to egg salad than tuna salad.

Added chopped red onions and chopped celery. Can't say it tastes like tuna, maybe more like egg salad but it will be in my regular rotation. Kid/teen approved also.

AMAZING. I've been vegetarian for the past seven years and although I have begun eating tuna again in the last month, this is quite comparable and (honestly) preferable to regular tuna fish!

Absolutely delicious! I just made a few minor adjustments. Substituted plain greek yogurt for the mayo, added a bit more relish, used finely chopped red onion instead of green, and added a little garlic powder & smoked paprika.

This is one of those recipes that, when you first taste it, it's really good!  But it's not so good later on.  can't explain why.  Just lost interest in it.

As a vegetarian, I really miss some of the comfort foods and quick lunches.  This REALLY hit the spot!  If you are expecting it to have a fishy-taste, it does not.  But it does have a slight flavor reminiscent of a tuna salad sandwich (due to the condiments) and great texture.  Yummy on warm, toasted bread!  You can easily adjust the condiments to your own preference.  GREAT recipe!

Love it!  I used a vegan mayo recipe to make it 100% vegan and it turned out very good.  This is my first time making anything like this.  I usually eat mayo, have it in the fridge, and canned tuna, have it on the shelf, but after watching Forks Over Knives and learning what I'm learning, I'm trying to convert to a plant based diet.  This is for SURE going to help me!
Thank you so much!

Here is the vegan mayo recipe I used;  
Ingredients:

1 cup grapeseed oil
1/2 cup soy milk (thick soy milk, or if using powder, use more powder to water than usual)
3/4 tsp salt (to taste)
1 - 1 1/2 tsp lemon juice (or apple cider vinegar)
Pinch ground mustard (optional, you could probably also use a 1/4 tsp prepared mustard)
Directions:

Combine all ingredients except lemon juice (or vinegar) in the food processor or blender, blending until smooth.
Slowly add the lemon juice or vinegar until the mixture thickens and tastes as desired. Add salt and mustard to taste.

Made the recipe as written but later went back and added more pickle relish and mayo.  Nice flavor but recommend mashing the chickpeas thoroughly or they won't stay in the sandwich!

Made this for 1st time tonite. The chickpeas are hard to mash & so I warmed them first & that seemed to help. May use less mayo next time & try some celery in it since I like celery in tuna. Not too bad tho - will make again.

I'm shocked at how great this tasted! It did not taste like tuna, but I actually prefer this to tuna! It was just as easy as making tuna as well. I'm very happy to find this alternative. I recently became a vegetarian and sandwiches are my favorite food, so it's been a little hard. I get tired of cucumber and tomato after awhile. I'll be making this weekly now, so thank you!

I had given up meat for Lent, so I decided to search for some veggie recipes that’d satisfy my cravings. I didn’t have any high expectations coming into this recipe, but I was pleasantly surprised! This Mock Tuna Salad was really delicious!! Totally reminded me the flavors of tuna salad. The texture is different though, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. 

I didn’t follow the recipe exactly but used most of the same ingredients. I used a 15oz can of garbanzo beans, 4 tbs.  of light mayo, 2 tbs. of light Greek yogurt, 2 stalks of celery (I like the crunch!), 3tbs. of  diced onion, 1 tbs. of relish and ½ tbs. of mustard, and salt and pepper to taste.

I drained the garbanzo beans and mashed them in a bowl with a fork. I think using a blender or a food processor would be too much; mashing them with a fork gave it a nice texture.

My dad thought it was awesome, and my little sister really liked it as well. She said it reminded her of egg salad. I might add in chopped hard boiled egg next time! Really great recipe.

Yum! I really liked this. I did add some garlic and some lemom juice. I omitted the green onion. I just didnt have any. I also used a blender, which did not work too well  bec this is sortof thick so it had a hard time blending. I had this with some whole wheat crackers. Next time I'll try this with greek yogurt to make this super healthy.

Not quite like tuna salad, but still so delicious! I made a few adjustments to suit my own tastes (left out the relish, added some Sriracha sauce), but all in all, it was great. I would suggest that one uses a food processor or a potato masher to mash the chickpeas. I tried it with a fork at first (silly me!) and, boy, was that tough!

This is great!! I have a mini processor and I just toss everything together in there and voila! I do add a pinch of hot sauce but that's just because I like most things to be a little spicy.

Absolutely delicious and healthy!  I have made this several times and change it up each time -- I like some crunch so I add chopped celery and sunflower seeds.  Dill weed is a nice spice to add.  My vegan BF loves this with vegan mayo!

I used organic garbanzo beans, olive oil mayonnaise, dijon mustard and one large garlic dill that I chopped fine as I do not care for sweet relish. I did add a half teaspoon each of garlic powder, onion powder and Frank's Hot Sauce. I spread this on cucumber slices and this made a filling late breakfast/early lunch for me. Next time, I might add one chopped organic hard boiled egg.

I give this 5 stars because it is so creative, easy, cheap, and delicious...and there are just as many variations on this as the classic tuna fish!  My upgrade to give it more of that under-the-sea flavor you might crave was a sprinkle of chopped, reconstituted dry algae (hydrated in the lemon juice); I keep algae on hand to make Asian style soups.  I had no relish, so I substituted fresh cucumber and vinegar, and it turned out great!

This is a wonderful lunch treat and I am amazed at how much it really tastes like tuna.  I am going to add kelp next time to give it more of a fish flavor and added nutrients.

I made this today, and it was absolutely amazing!  I used dried chickpeas and cooked them in the crockpot, drained then mashed them to a chunky consistency.    Then I just loosely followed the ingredients list, not really measuring, just as anyone would when making tuna salad.  It was fabulous!  I had this on Orowheat sandwich thins.  This will be heavy in my rotation.  I'm a returning, nontraditional college student, and I'm consistently appalled by the lack of healthy choices at school, and I think this would travel well as a lunch.  This would also be great used simply for dipping celery sticks.  *LOVE*  =)

This recipe is fabulous.  I can not believe how much it tastes like real tuna salad....maybe even better.  I am a new vegetarian and this will become one of my favorites.  I am not vegan, so next time I will add some chopped boiled egg.  FABULOUS!!!!!!!!

The longer this sits in the fridge the better it tastes. I add a touch more mayo and relish most times.

This was pretty good. I made it cause my husband doesn't like tuna, but I do, so I figured this would be a nice compromise. I'd probably would rather have tuna, but this is a nice 2nd.

I used another reviewer's suggestion of adding some bean juice from the can. I think I used too much because it got a little runny. But even though it was runny, it was still really good. Great on rice cakes with sliced tomatoes!

I thought this was really great. It's funny how all of the ingredients of tuna salad can make anything taste like tuna - without the fishy flavor that some people don't like. I always cut back on the mayo, but otherwise prepared as is. Spread on rice cakes for a great, light dinner.

I don't like tuna, but I wanted to try this anyway considering it had none. I love this recipe, though I did add a couple more spoonfuls of mayonnaise (mixed half cains and half cains light) than what it called for. I like my spreads to be creamy. I had it on whole wheat bread with romaine lettuce. Would defiitely make again.

I thought this tasted more like an egg salad than tuna but it was very good. I had a little issue w/the texture. Even tho I made it in my food processor, it was still kinda chewy.

This is a really great idea!  I made it with 1 tsp regular mustard since I don't have any spicy brown mustard and never heard of the thing.  I added celery instead of relish, since I didn't have any either.  Mashed garbanzo beans have a really creamy texture by themselves, so a low-fat mayo would be just as enjoyable.  I added a little cayenne pepper since I love spice.  It'll be my new go-to mid-week recipe for lunch!  So easy and healthy.  Also, I believe this recipe makes somewhere around 6-8 servings and not 4, since I am big on portion control.

Thank you for sharing this recipe!  I have been looking for a way to add more fiber from benas to my diet and this is a perfect recipe!  It's so simple and will become a staple for lunch!  I don't care for sweet relish so I left that out added lemon pepper and chopped celery and served on whole wheat toast!  Yummy!  Next time I am going to throw in some minced garlic as well!

I've been vegetarian now for six-plus years and tuna salad is the one food I miss most.  This recipe comes verrrry close to what I remembered and loved.  I used a combination of mayo and salad dressing in mine.  It's my new lunch favorite!

I'm really impressed with this one. Doesn't taste like tuna, but still really good. Its one of those that you can add to to suit your tastes. I added finely sliced celery, little bit of lemon juice, and it was a great medley of flavors. Surprisingly, hubby really liked it..but he still doesn't know what was in it ;) ;) I will absolutely be making this again.. and often!

Very good! I did modify this a little bit. I used regular yellow mustard, dill relish, and left out the green onions because I didn't have any on hand. I don't think I'd say this tastes like tuna salad, but that was actually really great for me because I don't like tuna, haha. :P I will probably make this again.

This recipe is a great start.  You need to add more of everything like one reader said.  I used yellow onion, but to really make this taste more like tuna. I omit the black pepper (you can add white pepper if you need it) and then I add ground kelp to taste.  It adds a fish taste without the fish.  My kids love this.  They would rather have this then actual tuna salad.

I love tuna salad too but I thought this was great. I just use it as a vegetable dip or spread for crackers. I used regular yellow onion and let sit overnight for flavors to enhance. Delish.

Delicious! A good alternative for tuna salad. I still eat tuna salad from time to time, but with the concerns about mercury levels in canned tuna, this will be a nice way to still get the taste and feel of eating it without the mercury levels.

My daughter is a vegetarian, so we decided to give this recipe a try, and we're glad we did.  I'm not a vegetarian, but don't care for tuna, so this is a great alternative.  This has become a staple in her school lunches.  Thanks for the recipe!

I enjoyed this; hubby thought it was just OK (but he'd eat it if I made it again). It tasted more like tuna salad before I put it on the bread, but it's still a great sandwich filling. I added some kelp flakes to give it a bit of a "sea" taste. I'll definitely keep this.

This was really good. I made it per the instructions but I put it inside a pita pocket with fresh spinach,thin slices of cucumber and red bell pepper cut pretty small. It added crunch and I will make this again!

Like others said, it didn't taste like tuna, but as long as you like garbanzo beans, you'll like this. A great idea with two thumbs up from me!

Well, I love chick peas, so I thought this was delicious.  I used dill pickle relish, as I usually put chopped dill pickles in my tuna salad.  I think I would have preferred using chopped sweet onion as opposed to the green onions, again, because that's what I usually put in my tuna salad, and a dash of hot sauce or hot pepper relish would perk this up nicely.  I don't think you could pass this off as actual tuna salad, but it's still a delicious sandwich filling, and would even make a nice snack on crackers.  Thanks for sharing!

This was really, really good! I was skeptical about it actually tasting like tuna salad but I was definitely proven wrong :) I didn't have green onions or spicy brown mustard, but I just omitted the onions and used dijon mustard in place of the brown mustard.  My favorite tuna salad recipe has white pepper in it, so I added some of that to this salad so it might taste a little closer :) Overall, really good and I will definitely make this again.

Very good.  Instead of regular mayo I used vegan mayo and I substituted regular salt for celery salt.  Will definitely make again.

This is pretty good for what it is. I put my garbanzos in the food processor instead of mashing them by hand. I skipped the green onion, but added some celery to replace the crunch. This makes a large amount, I'd say more like 6 servings. Pretty good, definitely didn't remind me of tuna salad, but it was a filling lunch. Thanks :)

My husband and I loved this recipe.  (It doesn't taste like tuna, but it doesn't need to.  It's delicious in its own right)  Our only change was that we added extra mustard because we love mustard.

Absolutely amazing! I did remedy the "no fish" taste problem by adding 1/4 sheet of sushi nori to the mix. I also increased the veganaise to 4 tablespoons, added a dash of garlic powder, decreased the mustard by half, as well as the onions to one. It didn't even need any salt or pepper. The most amazing vegan un-tuna recipe EVER!!! Thanks so much for the idea!

This one's definitely a keeper.  I didn't add onions, but I did throw in some Old Bay Seasoning (since I usually use that in tuna salad).  I used low-fat mayonnaise, regular yellow mustard (since that's all I had) and also added some celery, and a couple dashes of Tabasco sauce.  I found that it needed more seasoning than I'd usually use for tuna, but once I got that part right, it was excellent.  It's not exactly tuna salad, but is a very good substitute,  and since the price of tuna has just gone up, I'm glad to have this recipe.  With a few adjustments, it should make a good deviled egg salad substitute too.

Thanks for this great idea. I like it better than tuna salad and I love tuna salad. I think it is better to not expect it to taste like tuna.  It doesn't. I made it like I would make tuna salad which is very close to this recipe.  I used about 3 TBS. mayo and 1 TBS. sweet pickle juice.  No mustard. I added 2 short ribs of chopped celery and 2 chopped hard-boiled eggs along with 1 TBS. of chopped sweet pickle.  I grated in a bit of onion because I had no green onions. The best addition for me is 1/4 teaspoon of mild curry powder. YUM!  Try it in your tuna salad, too.  Great little flavor kick. I usually don't use onion or salt in tuna salad, but they were very good in this recipe.

Thank you for this idea.  We always have the condiments available and the garbanzo beans (for hummus or soup) but I never thought to put them together.  5 stars for idea, convenience, and taste.

MMM!!  The changes I made were: 2-3x the mayo called for, a 15.5oz can of chick peas, added 1 finely chopped celery stick.  I tried mashing with a potato masher, but found a fork worked better.  It was great!

I recommend putting the garbanzo beans in a food processor until it gets a bit mushy so that there aren't any big pieces of beans that ruins the texture. Diced raw onions give it a much better flavor.

Fantastic! This obviously doesn't taste exactly like tuna but it is very reminiscent of tuna/chicken/egg salad sandwiches, if you are a vegetarian craving any of those this is a great sandwich! I added one tbsp of mayo (will try the veganaise next time as other reviewers mentioned) + 1 tbsp of yogurt. Also only added in half a tsp each of the mustard and relish. Added in some finely diced red pepper and celery. Added paprika in addition to the salt & pep. In the sandwich I  just used this + a few leaves of spinach.

I really wanted to like this recipe and with all of the amazing reviews, I expected to love it.  However, I didn't care for it at all.  It did not taste like tuna, it was dry, and the combination of spicy mustard, sweet relish, and garbanzo beans was not a flavor that anyone in the family liked.

Regardless of wether you think this taste like tuna or not it is a delicious alternative and adaptle to your taste. The combination of ingredients does have a similar taste to tuna. You can add additionals (chop celery, carrots, celery seed, capers, more onion ...) but don't take away from the basic recipe. Flavors come together better after refridgeration.

I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this recipe, who would think to use garbanzo beans?  I will admit though, it is an excellent recipe, although I would refrigerate it for awhile before serving.  After refrigerating it overnight, the flavors really came together and it was excellent on sandwiches!  Can't wait to make it again!  Thanks for a great recipe!

I saved this recipe months ago but didn't try it because I wasn't sure how it would taste.  I have been craving a tuna sandwich so decided to give in and try it tonight.  I'm so glad I did!  It is similar to tuna salad without the "fishy" taste.  I'm going to try the leftovers tomorrow as a "tuna" melt.  This is definitely a keeper!

This stuff is amazing! I used vegannaise instead of mayonnaise, but other than that the recipe was the same. It's been a loooong time since I've eaten meat, but this reminds me more of salmon salad than tuna. Either way it's delicious.

I've been a vegetarian for a while and the only thing I really missed was tuna/chicken salad. This turned out GREAT! Took a while to mash up the chickpeas by hand (I only had a large silver spoon, whoops) but the relish, mustard and mayonnaise are excellent. Plus chickpeas are healthy for you and full of protein! :) Will definitely be making this again!

What a great idea! I would've never thought to make garbanzos into a sandwich spread, but it's really good. I don't know how much this tastes like tuna salad, but it is great as it is.

This is similar to another chickpea recipe on this site.  I changed the recipe a little bit- used light mayo, and added chopped celery and a sprinkle of garlic powder.  Very similar to tuna, without the gross fishy smell!  Not too shabby.  :)

I found the recipe after searching the kitchen in vain for lunch.  I found it after an ingredient search for garbanzo beans (the only benas left in the cubbard).  Totally delicious and definitely reminiscent of tuna salad.  Thanks!

WOW. SO GOOD. As a vegetarian, I must say this is one of the best "fake meat" recipes I've found. I actually like that it doesn't have the hardcore fishiness of real tuna, but has all of the other yummy elements! I chose to use chopped baby dill pickles instead of sweet relish, but otherwise, did the recipe exactly as stated. DELISH. Served it up tuna-melt style with cheese and tomato on an English muffin.

I had such a craving for tuna, but I'm a vegetarian and don't eat tuna.  I made this recipe thinking, "yeah right".  But it seriously smells and tastes like tuna!  Even my husband, who had just finished his own real tuna sandwich, said "man that smells like tuna!"  It is so yummy!  I didn't have the brown mustard.  I just used the garbanzo beans (a 15oz can was all I had), some mayo, some regular yellow mustard (just a squirt or two), and some relish.  SO good!

I like this recipe but I left out the onions due to food allergies and added 1 TBSP of dill pickle relish instead. It made it taste more like the tuna salad I normally make.  My daughter who loves tuna salad did not like this at all.

OK as a sandwich spread, but I probably won't make this again. The vegetarian husband didn't like this and I wasn't nuts about it. It would be better as a spread if you added other things to your sandwich.

I'm not a vegetarian, but I've been trying to add more beans to my diet.  This was really good!  I just did enough for one sandwich and used 1/2 cup beans, 1 Tbl mayo, 1 Tbl Dijonnaise and chopped dill pickle.  Who would have ever though to use garbanzo beans in a sandwich?!

I think this tastes better than tuna.  I make it just like I make tuna, adding chopped red onion, chopped green pepper, chopped dill pickle, chopped carrots and Miracle Whip and it is excellent as a sandwich or as a dip for Triscuits.

REALLY GOOD. and definitely a lot better than expected. i've never tried garbanzo beans before, and this was a great introduction. it doesn't really taste like tuna salad, but it does the tuna salad feel. instead of spicy brown mustard, i had a wasabi brown mustard. it gave it a good and interesting flavor.

Wow! I was a bit skeptical that this would really taste like tuna, and was shocked when it did! If I hadn't made it myself, I would've thought it was tuna (and therefore wouldn't have eaten it - I'm a vegetarian)! I did substitute chopped dill pickle for the relish, and added a bit more mayo (reduced fat). Delicious! Will definitely be making this again!

I was shocked by how similiar the taste was to tuna salad (from what I can remember).  I used chopped garlic dill pickle over the sweet pickle relish and used probably three times as much.  I also substituted lite mayo over the regular.  Very good.

this was pretty cool and really DID taste tuna-ish (and that comes from a tuna salad lover!)  i skipped the relish (hate it), but added cumin like some others and i think i would've liked it MUCH more (5-star quality) had i not done that.  it really WAS good though!

I can't believe how incredibly close this is to real tuna. My boyfriend grew up eating tuna with relish so I added that instead of dill pickles for him. I however grew up with dill so this was perfect.

This stuff is awesome, I do not think I would change a thing except to add some salt or pepper or maybe even a pinch of curry powder for extra kick.
Makes an awesome "tuna" melt w/ cheddar cheese on whole wheat bread!

I am not a fan of garbanzo beans but this spread is delicious.  My husband even liked it!  I'll definately make it again and will probably try adding some grated carrots and other veggies to kick up the nutritional value even more.  Thanks for sharing this one!
Yummy!

It has been over 15 years since I  had tuna, so it tasted somewhat like it. I added 1 celery stalk, finely chopped, and 1 shredded carrot. I left out the relish, will make again.

This recipe is pretty good, but I was expecting it to be a better replica of tuna salad. I know a sandwich shop where they make many authentic tasting 'fake meat' sandwiches, and this did not remind me of real meat the way theirs do. I still might make it again since it's tasty and healthy.

I thought this recipe was average.  Not good but not bad either.  Probably won't make again.

WOW! This stuff is awesome! I just made some and had it for dinner on a hamburger roll. It's super easy to make and very convenient since I am 14 and the only vegetarian in my family and have to make seperate dinners. Thanks so much for the recipe, it was delicious and actually tasted a lot like tuna fish!!!

Despite the fact that it doesn't taste like tuna, it is a good vegetarian sandwich spread. Very tasty.  It will be a new standby for me.

I made this with my typical cajun chicken salad dressing: mayo, sour cream, dijon, cajun seasoning blend (salt free), and fresh parsley.  It was sooo good.  I like the texture of tuna salad over chicken, but hate the fishy taste so this hit the spot.  Don't rinse the beans, it adds more flavor.

This is a great alternative to tuna!!  I substituted low fat miracle whip and sweet onion, added celery salt and made it ahead (2 hours) and wow, the flavors really came together.  I can't wait to use this for a summer potluck.

I just made this and it is really good. I used dijon mustard instead of brown, had no green onion so I used 2T of finly chopped red onion, also added some dill and lemon seasoning, and instead of regular mayo I used mayoli which is much better for you then regular mayo. Thanks for the great vegeterian recipe.

Wow! I can't believe how much this tastes like tuna salad! It really smells like it too, but I suppose that's part of the whole tuna experience. Anyhow, I had my grandmother try it without telling her what it was and she was so shocked that it wasn't tuna! The only changes I made to the recipe was not using green onions and using yellow mustard instead of brown. My 1 year old ate it all up! Thanks!

Not a bad sandwich spread.  The flavor's pretty strong, so I can only seem to eat it in small amounts.  I added some dill, cumin, and chili powder, and skipped the sweet relish.  Very quick with a food processor.  I do think it tastes like tuna salad, but I certainly appreciate that it doesn't smell quite like tuna salad.  Neat idea--thanks.

This was a very good recipe.  My brother said five stars, but i decided to give it four.  It was definitely a yummy recipe and I would make it again.  I ended up adding vegan cheese and grilling the sandwiches for a "tuna melt" effect, and they were very good. They didn't taste much like tuna, but that was fine with me.  Great recipe!

Before I became a vegetarian I was a huge Tuna Salad fan and this recipie really curbs my tuna salad cravings.  I could not believe how close this is to tasting like the real deal.  I added a little more mayo and onion, but that was just a taste preference.  Thanks for sharing this!  I'll be making this all the time!

WOW!  This is REALLY GOOD!  I could truly give up tuna and egg salad for this.  The only things that I changed was:  I used Nayonaise in place of mayo, sweet round onion in place of green onion, added celery and paprika.  This really is ono - broke da mouth!!!!!

I made it and it doesn't taste like tuna fish but I did like it.  I just became a Plant Based vegan and its a good substitute.   I used part vegan mayo and part avocado and cumin, onion, garlic salt and tahini in vitamix.

I made this a five star for myself. I suspect that the added ingredients as-is are better if you purée your beans. If you lightly mash them (like I did) I feel it needs more moisture and flavor. So I increased the dressing by 50% (3 TbSP of mayo for example). I also added 1/4 tsp of Old Bay (Chesapeake Bay) Seasoning because that just screams “seafood!” to my old taste buds.

Since becoming vegan about a year and a half ago I struggle with weekday lunches that I can bring to work with me.  This recipe is easy and quick and easy to modify depending on what I happen to have on hand.  I always add about a half teaspoon of roughly chopped capers to give it that salty “fishy” taste, and sometimes add chopped celery.  It even makes s great dip for crackers!

I love this. But actually make changes! I usually use vegan mayonnaise. No mustard but will try it. And don't like the relish. I just do celery and green onion. And yes, use the food processor. Its good on toasted english muffins. 
I have served it to people not telling them it is vegan. Just tea sandwiches. Some like it and some don't. No one asks what it is. And yes, my carnivore hubby loves it, thinks he's eating healthy to make up for all his bad habits.

Tastes incredible! I used Vegan ‘Just Mayo Garlic’  instead and  rolled it up on Flat Out Flatbread (ranch flavored)  along with sliced Persian cucumbers and sliced avacodo. Delicious!

This is delicious. I admit; instead of sweet pickle relish I went with a dill pickle, (I hate sweet pickles - yuck!), left out the shallots (subbed in onion powder instead), and used regular mustard instead of spicy (didn't have it to hand - otherwise would have loved to use spicy mustard). 

These came out tasting more like deviled eggs than tuna, but that actually works BETTER for me. This is going to be a diet staple for me;  thanks for the recipe!

I made this as a vegan alternative to egg salad, and my kids all started stealing my food out of the fridge and didn't leave me any.  I enjoyed it, and have made it  many times.  I did change the recipe a bit.  I added  mayo to taste instead of 2 tablespoons, because I don't like it too dry.   I prefer mine creamy and spreadable.  I hate relish, so I finely diced some dill pickles as a salty substitute.

Great tasting salad!  The only change I made was to substitute the mayo with vegan mayo.  Will definitely make again.

I've made this on multiple occasions (so much so that I've gotten sick of it). I simplify it now, just eyeballing the amount of mayo and mustard, adding some pepper, and then I add chopped celery (my mom always made tuna with celery).

I used chives in place of the green onions, diced dill pickles instead of the sweet relish and more than called for, and added a rib of diced celery.  I wasn't expecting this to taste exactly like tuna salad so I wasn't surprised it didn't.  That said, it is a decent options for those vegetarians in the family when the rest are having chicken or tuna salad.  Thanks for the idea.

I think this is a good vegetarian option for a sandwich filling, but I agree with several other reviewers that it doesn't really taste like tuna salad. I will probably try it with different types of beans to play with the texture a little.

This is a really good idea and really does satisfy the craving for those who don't want to use tuna. I add some different things in there to give it some more flavor. Try some finely chopped celery for crunch and finish it with some chopped parsley and a few squirts from a lemon to brighten it up.  Capers are good too. And if you're cooking your own chickpeas, make sure you do the mashing while they are still warm.

I am new to the vegetarian world- so I'm trying to experience new foods, or combinations of foods. I'm not sure if this was a mind of matter type thing - but it was GOOD! I added a slice if cheese and melted it on the toast a little (this was also my preference with tuna sammie's) and it turned out delish! Thanks for sharing- I can't wait for lunch tomorrow.

Great change from tuna or egg salad.  Very quick and super easy to make. I chopped up sugar free bread and butter pickles instead of adding sweet relish, and bumped up the flavor with some garlic powder and extra green onions and mustard. Let it sit in the fridge for 30 minutes so all the flavors melded together. Will make again often. Thanks Nice_Girl1965!

This was delicious! It doesn't taste like tuna salad, but that's OK, because it's good in its own right. Made exactly according to the recipe. The spicy brown mustard is really tasty in this. Next time, I may add some diced red pepper and some lemon juice to try another variation. Thanks!

This is great! It does rely on the favors of the condiments more tha the favors of the tuna. - obviously! - but if you're looking for a comforting, easy, vegetarian sandwich filling, this one is great! Will try it next with vegan mayo for a full-on veg experience.

It was great the first time I made it except I made some adjustments. I added the beans/ pickles/garlic clove to the food processor for maybe 90 seconds then I put it into a bowl and added veganese and green onions. along with yellow mustard and garlic seasoning salt, black pepper, and the secret ingredient to really make it taste like tuna, cayenne/kelp flakes about 1/2 tsp mix it together and it is GREAT!!!

Vegetarian or not, you're gonna love this!  It amazingly looks like tuna but has it's own distinct taste sure to please.  A quick and easy way to eat healthy chickpeas!   I prefer this with crackers rather than on a sandwich.

What a godsend for vegetarians. Like all mock meats it is reminiscent in many ways, but does not taste (nor should anyone expect it) to taste exactly like tuna. But as the other reviewers have noted it is  good. This will become a staple in my house for lunches and quick dinners. 
I made this exactly as stated in the recipe and it is fantastic. Next time I will follow some suggestions from other reviewers and add lemon juice, celery, capers, and a healthy dose of sea salt. 
Yum yum! Thanks  NICE_GIRL1965 for a great recipe!

This is amazing! I've been a vegetarian for almost 12 years and have always craved something like tuna for lunches. This is going to be a staple for sure.

I made mine into egg salad.  I put one hard cooked egg into it so I didn´t have to lie.  My husband asked why I can´t make it this good every time!  I seldom rate recipes, so U know this is really good.

I just throw everything in a food processor and pulse to the right consistency.....AWESOME!  Tastes just like tuna salad!  I even substitute red onion and yellow mustard and it is still perfect!  Thank you for this recipe!

Awesome thanks so much for the recipe. I eyeballed all the condiments and probably used more than two tbsp mayo if I measured. This is good! My husband is allergic to tuna and he was nervous that I was serving tuna to him until I explained what is in this.

This is great! Perfect “tuna” salad without fishy smell. I liked spicy food so I added spicy mayo, spicy relish and little bit of celery. Thanks for sharing this yummy recipe.

I thought that as a sandwich filling, it was very good. It would get 5 stars for taste if it was called "Yummy Sandwich Spread". As for tasting like tuna, no way.  I followed the recipe, cutting it in half as I only had a small can of chick peas. I used an equivalent amount of sweet onion instead of green onion, but that should not have changed the taste of the recipe. I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  I never knew that mashed chickpeas could replace tuna!  That's one of the only things I've missed in the 8 years of vegatarianism, and I know it's not the real thing, but after 8 years, you think I know the difference!? I made it how I used to make tuna salad - with chopped dill pickle rather than relish and MmmmmmHmmmmm.  It is GOOD!

This recipe was great! I used low fat mayo and added a few more spices. But all in all I would have never known I was eating garbanzo beans! Very good!

I've made this basic recipe before - actually found it in a kids' receipes book I have.  The addition of the spicy mustard from this recipe gives it a little more kick.  While this is a very good sandwich filler, I have to agree with the reviewers who said it really doesn't taste like tuna.  It's a very nice chickpea spread - great for vegetarians (which my husband is) - I use vegan mayo, generally a grapeseed oil variety - when I make it.

really tasty, although i find that when you mash the chickpeas, they have a lot of moisture already, so 1 tsp of light mayonnaise was more than enough to make this salad moist. next time i'll add raisins and maybe almonds!

Ya know, it's amazing that even after years and years of endless garbanzo bean consumption, I don't think to eat them like this. Now, I'm not sure I would call it "tuna" salad, but I thought it was better! I just used the stuff I have on hand...I abhor mayo, so I used the whipped salad dressing, which gave it that sweet relish flavor as well since I didn't have relish either. Next time, I would use half as much...it became a little too soupy and the taste of the beans was lost. I had to use what I had on hand, so I added a generous amount of minced dill pickle, jalapenos, and white onion. All good and I can eat it for a couple of days. Great with chips or crakers as a dip!

This is a good alternative.  It does not taste like tuna salad, but I dont think it should.  It is much more dry than tuna salad because of the lack of the tuna moisture, but that was not bad thing.  Followed the recipe as written.  Easy to make.  It was good on toast.  I wondered if other people thought about Hummus with a kick as they ate it?

This was very good. I agree that it doesn't taste exactly like tuna fish, but it has lots of similar flavors, and the added bonus of not giving you tuna breath!!! I used dill relish because that's what I prefer, added a dash of lemon juice, and used it to top Ritz crackers. Even my cat liked it!

I was very pleasantly surprised! I was skeptical until I tasted it. It looks like egg salad and tastes like tuna salad. I'm so happy to find a substitute like this! I didn't have spicy mustard so I used regular & only 1 tsp. I also only used one green onion because I don't usually put them in tuna.. it was good regardless. It's printed and in my recipe book!

This was great!  I've never been a fan of tuna, or any seafood for that matter, but for some reason I've been craving tuna salad (pregnant) but am not allowed to eat it because of the mercury.  This was a great alternative. I admit, I don't really think it tastes like tuna, but it's so much better for you, and tastes great on toasted bread!

This tasted more like egg salad than tuna. My boyfriend did not like garbanzo beans until I made this mock salad. He ate this with crackers and it was a perfect snack! I made this with garlic dill pickles, spicy mustard, mayo, and onions - like I make my tuna sandwich. Definately, you'll get a work out by smashing those garbanzo beans if you don't have a food processor. Pastry blender will do the job.

Good!  Like others have said, not "exactly" like tuna salad but good on its own.  I added extra relish and mustard for a little more zip.  Make sure you really mash up the chickpeas...I used a potato masher as another reviewer had recommended.

Holy Deliciousness! I've made chickpea dips a million times and never thought to put some mayo and mustard in it. It really is reminiscent of tuna salad. I substituted Miracle Whip for mayo and it was fab. Thanks so much!

This was pretty good. It reminded me more of egg salad than tuna salad. Since I wasn't sure about it I made a sampling using one cut of garbanzo beans (I cooked mine from dry) 1 tbsp of mayo (plus a little more to get the wetness I desired) Spicy brown mustard (to my taste) white onion, relish and a few bits of cilantro. Tasted pretty good on toasted wheat bread. I'll make again and perhaps add some apples. Quick,easy, yummy snack!

This was a good recipe, although like other reviewers have stated, it does not taste like tuna salad. I don't care for the taste of tuna anyway (been a vegetarian for 7 years), but the only problem I found was that it was a bit dry; I doubled the amount of mayonnaise (I used veganaisse, so the fat content was not increased) and mustard. I also recommend adding extra relish as well. I'll definitely be making this again...

I agree with some of the other reviewers in that I don't think that this tasted exactly like tuna.  It still tasted good, but wasn't exactly what I was hoping for (though I might combine this with my standard tuna recipe so that I get a good mix of carbs and protein).

I have to say, this really did taste like tuna fish. I've been concerned about the mercury in tuna, so this is a great alternative.

My family won't go near it, but I love it and am enjoying it right now on celery. It's filling and tastes, to me, like tuna.

I think the reason I eat tuna fish salad (as we Americans tend to eat it, slathered in mayonnaise) is for the texture and creaminess. These are recreated perfectly here with the garbanzo beans.

Delish! Will make again.

I was searching last night for a new vegetarian sandwich idea and came across this one, so I decided to try it. I made it for lunch today and I must say that I LOVE it! Being a vegetarian there are few sandwich ideas that really pop out at me and this one was FABULOUS! Thanks!

Delicious! I added grapes, apple, and red onion to mine. I spread it on a whole wheat tortilla, topped it w/ feta cheese, and popped it in the oven (at 350) for about 5 minutes. Awesome!

I might leave out most of the relish and the onion next time (something about that combo made this taste like potato salad to me), but otherwise, this works well on a sandwich with some tomato.

This was different.  I couldn't get past the bean texture, but it was a nice twist.  I'll probably make it again since hubby can't stand the smell of fish.  Thanks for the recipe.

Very good! 

I make this all of the time, family loves it. We spread it on toasted bread to cut down on the mushiness, we do the same with tuna salad, too. 

Mashing the beans is a hassle, though. ;)

This was very good. I just didn't expect it to make so much. I'd say this makes at least as much as 3 cans of tuna. I did add one hard boiled egg, and all I had was regular yellow mustard, but this was fabulous. The texture is very much like flakey tuna. Definately a keeper.

It is ok, but doesnt taste like tuna salad at all. It tastes a lot more like potato salad...just add hard boiled eggs.  I ate it by itself and it was ok, but I don't think it would be good on bread.  Just think of a potato salad sandwich; a little too starchy.

I've been a vegetarian for 16 years, so I can't say this tastes like tuna, because I really don't remember.  It is really, really good, though.  It's going to be made pretty often.

The texture of this kind of reminded me of potato salad.  It was yummy.  I used dill pickle relish instead of sweet.  That's the only thing I changed.

I was really excited to try this recipe. How could you really go wrong with chick peas?! Unfortunately I really did not care for it. I tried some of the suggestions (like adding cumin, which I love) but nothing really made this a tasty sandwich spread. Maybe cooking the chickpeas ahead of time would help? The texture was just a little off or something. Oh how I wish this would've been good. I'm happy other people like it.

Excellent substitute for chicken salad, too. (never liked tuna anyway!) I added a hard boiled egg the next day, loved the spicy mustard in it. Very good.

Not great. That's probably partly because I didn't add mustard or onions (I don't like them). I don't think it tastes like tuna.

lol...it does look just like tuna salad!  I don't think it tastes that much like it, but, it's not bad.  I ate it on a bun, but, next time I'll use it to make a lettuce roll.  As a healthy lunch alternative this is definitly a keeper.

Very yummy as sandwich spread or with crackers.  I use to make it vegan with nayonaisse...I still make it even though I'm not vegan anymore.  The pickles really do make it taste like tuna salad.  Great idea.

Hey, not bad!  Those garbanzo beans are the same color as tuna when they're all squashed up, so the appearance isn't bad either.  I had this on pita bread (whole wheat) with lettuce and tomatoes.  I also added cumin, chili powder and a pinch of cayenne to jazz it up a little.  Really yummy served in a warm pita:)  Thanks for a very good, easy recipe!

I'd definitely make this recipe again if I ever have a can of garbonzo beans lying around. It is reminiscent of tuna salad in terms of the same ingredients (minus the fish) but much blander (not that being bland is necessarily a bad thing). Add the usual suspects that you see in tuna for extra flavor (dill, egg, onion, etc).

I personally don't really think this tastes like egg salad or tuna salad, but it is easy to make and can be incredibly healthy.  I add red onion, celery, carrots, basically whatever I've got one hand to add flavor and make it less dry.  Really good in a pita or used as a dip for fresh veggies.

I was skeptical, but this is actually a pretty good substitute for tuna salad. I added a little more mayo and relish, substituted dijon mustard and red onion and added minced celery. It's great on toasted wheat bread or crackers. I will make it again to add more protein to my vegetarian lunches.

Very good.  Would make again.  Tastes a bit like tuna.  Followed recipe except I put the chic peas in a food processor.

I've been using this recipe a while now and just got around to rating it.  It's delicious!  Although I don't think there's anything wrong with regular tuna fish, this is an interesting change.  I whirl everything around in my "Oscar" and it's great.  Thanks, Caroline.

This is excellent. I add a bit of kelp (just a dash)to give it that "seafood" taste and some as i used to add curry to my tuna salad, I add a dash of curry too. I also like a little heat so use a habanero mustard in addition to regular spicy brown mustard. I have made it as written and give it 4 1/2 stars but with the added kept and heat, I give it a 5 but that is probably just personal preference. I also use a finely diced red onion as I LOVE onion. I make this at least once ever two weeks and sometimes I serve eat it on toast with lettuce and sometimes with curry or garlic crackers. It ALWAYS hits the spot!

My boyfriend is vegetarian and I'm not but I try to find recipes to make that I'll enjoy and that he can eat, too.  This DEFINITELY was one of them. Modified the recipe slightly based on what we had around...subbed sweet and tangy honey mustard and then to counter it threw in some dill pickle relish along with the sweet pickle relish as well as some fresh dill... the only thing not at all like tuna salad is the texture, otherwise, this is a great (and tasty!) replacement! :)

I made this once and thought I messed it up somehow because it wasn't good at all.  I made it again and it wasn't any better.  I didn't like it at all.  The flavors just don't mesh whatsoever.

Makes a nice sandwich spread.  Excellent for a light lunch.  I was out of mayo, so I used a thousand island dressing instead, and it was fine.  I'll definitely be making it again.  I think it would be good with more relish.  I also might try adding some garlic.

This chickpea spread is vaguely reminiscent of tuna salad - just be sure to mash the chickpeas well.  It's not a bad substitute for someone who can't have tuna salad, and aside from that it's pretty tasty, but although I'm vegetarian I think I would rather stick to egg salad and use my chickpeas in hummus where their flavour is accentuated instead of masked by mustard and green onions.

This was a delcious and easy spread that offers a new lunch option for us vegetarians.  I left out the green onions and used dijon mustard and it worked just as well.  I also added some hot sauce as it needs a good kick!  I think next time, I will play around with some more spices to make it a little more flavourful. I think the best results are when it is mashed manually not in a blender for a nice texture.  Overall, a great recipe that all vegetarians should try.

This was amazing.  I've been craving tuna, and this hit the spot.  It also reminds me of egg salad.  Very good.  I will make this again.  Thanks for sharing it.
