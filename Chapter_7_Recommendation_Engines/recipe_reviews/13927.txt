This recipe was very good, but I made several changes: I didn't use the bread per earlier reviews that indicated it would get mushy. I also used 1 Tbsp olive oil instead of the butter, used a mixture of zucchini & squash, and added 2 chopped green onions and 3 chopped artichoke hearts to the vegetable saute. I used lowfat cottage cheese, replaced the yogurt with fat-free sour cream, used Eggbeaters instead of the eggs, and added 1 Tbsp parsley to the cottage cheese mixture.  Baked at 400 degrees for 30 minutes; it turned out wonderfully! My husband and I almost polished it off just between the two of us.

I have tried this recipe several times and each time, the bread on the bottom of the pan stays mushy. Not a bad flavor, but soft bread doesnt seem to work for a crust.

After reading several other reviews, I was careful to follow the recipe exactly and stand my bread along the side of pie pan, not the bottom.  In this way, I avoided the bread turning mushy.  It was toasted nicely, and the cruchiness definitely balanced out the dish.  The quiche itself had a nice tangy flavor, although the cottage cheese mixture didn't set as well as a regular quiche.  Would make again.

In two words - too bland - to suit me. I made it without bread and I added a little bit of carrot and green pepper to the zucchini. Also added a few drops of hot sauce and some onion salt.  But it needs something else to liven it up.

I'm very pleased with this recipe even making it lower fat.  Followed others recommendations and used low carb bread, olive oil in place of butter, added 2 cloves garlic minced, 2 scallions chopped, 1 1/2 t. oregano, 4 egg whites instead of whole eggs, 2T. fresh parsley, 1/2 c. parmesan. I also did mix the veggies with the egg and cheese mixture and then poured into pie plate. I also baked it for 45 minutes cause it was just a little too loose for my liking at 30 minutes.  Good job and thanks for posting.

My husband and I loved this!  Others reviewed this as bland, but with a few minor changes/additions, it was very tasty and refreshing. I used 12-grain bread instead of wheat (tastier), 1/2 cup skim milk in place of yogurt, doubled the oregano, added 1 tsp. dried parsley, 1 cup shredded cheddar/mozzarella blend and salt/pepper to taste. Delicious (tasted a bit like pizza, but better)!

This was really good! Next time I'll make it in a bigger pie plate and add some more zucchini. More Parmesan on the top helps, too.

The changes I made to this recipe were minimal: I added a bit more zucchini, one red pepper and also used parmesan only for sprinkling (mature Cheddar in the quiche itself). Mine set fine, but they did take a bit longer than 30 mins (closer to 45). It even looked very pretty and appetising. However, I found it bland and flubbery, and didn't finish my slice. It tasted of something I couldn't quite put my finger on, but didn't really remind me of quiche. Sorry.

My family loved this recipe. It was low in fat and delicious. Next time I make it, I will probably leave out the bread, and mix the zucchini mixture with the egg mixture before I bake it. Great flavor!

I tried this recipe and it was mushy and not very tasteful.  Although, I didn't put bread on bottom of pan, just the sides and it made a beautiful star shape.  The toasted crusts were the best part, but I have a toater that can do that!

I used many of the ideas - toasting the bread and extra seasoning.  But my quiche trick is to put the cheese in on the crust to solve the soggy issue.  The cheese melts on the crust (bread in this case) and creates a barrier that keeps it from soaking up the moisture.  I used the parmesan to do that in this recipe.

This was really delicious. The bread served as a nice quick crust, but when one of your favorite things about quiches is the crust it just doesn't suffice.  I suggest either making crust or buying some ready-made.  Also, adding some cheddar to the quiche mix might add a little sharpness to the flavor.  All-in-all this was a very satisfying dish.

I used normal pie pastry for the crust - that turned out good. Just tasted a bit too yogurty for me.

I enjoyed this very much. Next time, I would omit the bread because it doesn't need to be in there (my opinion)...I didn't have any yogurt so I added 1/2 cup of 1% milk and also added double the oregano and some salt and pepper for my Italian taste buds...delicious!!!

I forgot to add the flour to the veggies, however my 2 and 1 year old just loved it.  I added mushrooms and garlic to the veggies, and also added some paprika to the egg and cheese mixture for added flavor.  It was a little watery, but I think with adding a little extra flour, would have helped.  We'll definitely be making this one again to use up all the garden delivers!!

We had a Christmas Brunch on Christmas Eve and made about 20 recipes from this site as main dishes. Although i was leary about a vegetarian dish, it was one of the two top hits! Everyone loved it. I stress to try it even if you are not vegetarian, and even with picky eaters.

I actually toasted the whole grain bread a little before putting it in the pan, and this solved the soggy bread issue!  Also added some extra onion & seasoning per other reviews.

Ok this is a great start, but needs changes:  I used the yogurt,but also added a little sour cream and white chedder and colby jack cheese, and added an extra egg.  Add more spices.  Mix the veggies and flour in with the egg mix.  Use whatever veggies you like.  I added some red pepper.  Put crusty, hearty bread slices along the sides of the pan (they kind of slide, but once you spoon egg mix along the bread pieces, they will stay put), then before you put in oven, SPRAY THE BREAD WITH OLIVE OIL SPRAY.  I used a thinner quiche pan, so it cooked in 30 mins.  terrific!!

I found this quiche very good after making some alterations as suggested by other members.  I used a store-bought crust to avoid the soggy bread and baked it for longer (about 45 minutes but probably should have gone even longer to bake the bottom.  For fear of blandness, I doubled the oregano and added a bunch (maybe two tbsp) of garlic pepper (a mixture of pepper, garlic, salt and other spices you can buy at the store).  I also threw a handful of cheddar into the cheese mixture.  I will probably make this recipe again and try adding some onion, mushrooms, or garlic.  Overall I was very satisfied with how it turned out.

I didn't listen to everyone about the bread, but it was still pretty good.  Anyone who doesn't like this recipe or variations of it, needs to go back to cooking 101!  It was a great way to use the zucchini.

I loved this recipe.  Low kid rating because I have to pickiest eaters on earth.  And now I have a great recipe for this years zuccini crop.
