This recipe was delicious.  It was easy to make too.  I couldn't find the hickory flavored tofu so I just used plain and it tasted fine.  The dish really take the flavor of the salad dressing.  I used low fat ranch to make it even more healthy!

This was really good for such a quick and simple recipe.  I used plain tofu because I didn't have the flavored variety and I spiced it up by adding cumin and garlic powder. I didn't have any ranch dressing either so I used soy sauce and italian dressing.  To keep the tortilla from cracking I followed one of the other reviewers advice and lightly cooked it in a pan before cooking in the microwave.  Thanks for the recipe!

I just want to say that to make wraps easier you should warm them quickly(a few seconds on each side) in hot skillet to keep them from breaking.

Interesting recipe. Had plain tofu, so I baked it after pressing & removing water from it. Used a marinade of minced garlic, ginger, onion with sesame oil, vinegar, white wine and soy sauce. I used silver chard cut into very thin ribbons instead of spinach. Tasted pretty good. Thank You.

This is a really easy and fast lunch. To make it a bit healthier I eliminated the ranch dressing and smeared a thick layer of roasted red pepper hummus on the tortilla. Really good.

I actually didnt put them in the microwave. I steamed them to melt the cheese. Turned out gorgeously...Im always paranoid that the tortillas will get too hard. I prefer ceasar dressing, so that is what I used, with some extra garlic (just me). Great recipe!

This was freakin' good!! I only gave it 4 stars because I cound't find baked tofu in the grocery so I made it myself...it took a little longer but it came out really well...I used a marinade of about 1/8 c. of Soy Sauce and 1 tsp. of Sesame Oil brushed on the sliced pieces and then baked for 30-40 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Oh and if you use a damp paper towel on the bottom while microwaving it makes the tortilla stay soft :)

quick and good. I substituted hummus for the dressing to make it a little healthier but it kept a strong flavor.

Very tasty. It was very simple and fairly healthy. I had to make sure to slice my tofu thin otherwise it tasted not done, and to really limit the dressing or else it can overpower the wrap.

this was delicious AND easy to make! I didn't have some of the specific ingredients, so i used regular tofu instead of hickory flavored and mozzeralla cheese. REALLY REALLY GOOD!

Fabulous. I had never tried smoked tofu before and it was really wonderful. The combo with cheese, spinach and ranch dressing was terrific. I'm making it for some work lunches again next week.

Pretty tasty... I used oriental-flavored baked tofu and low-fat ranch and low-carb whole wheat tortillas.  Definitely made for a great lunch!  It was a little messy though... I'm not sure how to keep the tortilla from breaking in the middle.

These wraps had a great taste and were extremely easy/quick to make! Very healthy and tasty eats if you're on the go. There's not a lot of wrap sandwich recipes for us vegetarians so this was much appreciated.

I served this with another recipe found on this site--vegetarian tortilla soup, and we absolutely loved it! One of the tastiest meals I've had, and the hubby and even the kids loved it, which is amazing! I couldn't find the hickory tofu anywhere so I made it myself with plain tofu. Just cover the tofu with hickory flavored bbq sauce and bake at 375 for 40 min. Thank you!

This was indeed really good!  I took the advice of another reviewer and baked my own tofu with a marinade of soy sauce and a bit of sesame oil.  I placed damp paper towel under and over the tortillas while microwaving and the pitas stayed nice and soft.  A quick and easy weeknight meal!  I thought it may also be good with some sauteed mushrooms and/or bell peppers tossed in...might try that next time.

This was awful. Unless you're a health nut, you won't lke this. It is very bland. Because you have to melt the cheese onto the tortilla, the tortilla becomes hard. I will not be making this again.

The "hickory smoked" tofu I used was not found in the deli area. It was where the regular tofu is and it is like a sliced deli turkey, but of course made with tofu. My husband loved this and did not believe it was tofu. Nice quick recipe and healthy with the fresh spinach.
