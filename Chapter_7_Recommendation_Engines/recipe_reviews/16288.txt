I added maple syrup instead of vanilla to the frosting!  My family went crazy.

My family really liked these bars.  They were very moist and easy to make.  I made a couple of minor changes by substituting half of the sugar with Splenda and substituting the vanilla with maple syrup in the frosting.  I'll make these again.

These bars are the best pumpkin bar. I always get complements when ever I bring them to a gathering. Light and moist. I put chopped walnuts on top of the frosting. These are soooo good!

These are very good. Super easy to put together. I left out the raisins since my family doesn't like them next time I will add walnuts. I did think that the frosting was a bit to sweet. I think I'll double the cream cheese next time. Thanks for the recipe.

These bars were EXTREMELY messy to take out of the jelly roll pan and also fell apart easily too. I followed the directions to the T for thanksgiving and it did NOT work out as I had planned.

Also the frosting tasted bitter and it did NOT suit the pumpkin bars at all! This will NOT see the family table

These bars are AMAZING!  Here are the changes I made that were suggested by another reviewer: #1 use 3 eggs instead of 4. #2 Add 1 29oz. can of Libby's Pumpkin pie mix instead of the 15oz. #3 Add 1 tsp of pumpkin pie spice in addition to the 2 tsp of cinnamon. 

For the frosting: add 1 8oz. cream cheese, then I doubled the rest of the ingredients. This is always a big hit! People just LOVE these bars! Happy baking! :)

Three suggestions to start with:  I used about 2 tbsp less oil than specified, I added 2 tsp. vanilla and 1 tsp. maple flavoring, and I used pumpkin pie spice + some fresh ground nutmeg in place of the cinnamon  To jazz this up: I added some chopped pecans and 1/4 cup caramel bits, and 1/4 cup shredded coconut!!!!    I suggest leaving off the icing - it really doesn't need it - and is great plain with milk or coffee - and if you need it sweeter - then zap it in the microwave for ten seconds - then top it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream.  I wanted a quick and easy pumpkin dessert - that could be dessert or breakfast - thanks - will use again!.
