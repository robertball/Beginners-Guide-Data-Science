This salad is a real crowd pleaser.  The first time I made this salad, I didn't read that it served 20 until I was 3/4 through preparation.  I felt pretty silly makeing the whole recipe for 8 people, but I am glad I did because there was hardly any left!  The sauce is fantasitic, and versitile - it would make a great dipping sauce for chicken, shrimp or pork.

Makes a ton!! Although it states this is a "quick" recipe, it is time-consuming: make dressing, cook noodles, chop or shred lots of vegetables.  Not as flavorful as other Thai noodle salads I've eaten as the sauce was on the mild side.  It was o.k., but it didn't receive much response from my guests, and only 1 (out of 11) asked for the recipe.

I substituted Thai rice noodles for the pasta. A little cilantro goes a long way. The recipe divides easily. Tasty sauce. My preteen daughter helped with all of the "chopping" and enjoyed the dish, especially the sauce.

I used whole wheat linguine instead of angel hair, cucumber and scallions instead of carrot, lime juice, olive oil and fresh ginger in place of peanut butter and tahini.  Also, didn't use shrimp but wish I had...grilled chicken would be nice as well.
I will make this again and again.  It's addictive, healthy and beautiful to look at.  A real keeper, thanks!!

This is so good. My husband is from Laos and i love Thai and Laos food, I thought it sounded weird to use speghetti noodles, but it was actually tasted VERY yummy! I would have given 5 stars, but there was just that LITTLE SOMETHING missing in the sauce???? I'll have to play with it next time, my husband LOVED this!! :)

I thought the sauce was fantastic. To cut down on prep, I used a bagged shredded cabbage, same for the shredded carrots. Also, I left out the green onion and shrimp  (food allergies). I will make this again.

This is incredible! Fresh tasting and so good for you, all the elements work well in this one. Tahini is expensive, but now I've got it and will make good use of it!
Thanks so much!

This was okay, but I would want to tweak the sauce if I ever made this again.  As it was, I cut the salt in half and even with that it was way too salty.  I think the rice vinegar would need to be reduced as well.  Bottom line, too salty and not spicy enough, but it was a nice texture and a nice crunch with the fresh veggies, just needs a tweak.

Takes a fair amount of prep time, but it comes together quickly after that. I love the peanut dressing with the pasta, the crunch of the veggies, and fresh cilantro. I had large shrimp that I marinated and stir fried with lime and ginger--my modification. We loved this salad!

Very good flavors! I made exactly as directed, except omitting green pepper because I didn't have any. The dressing is a little too thick and strong for me. I diluted and thinned mine with chicken broth - perfect. Thanks for the recipe!

This was very good, although I cut the recipe in half it still makes HUGE amount.  I also doubled the cilantro and the sweet chili sauce.  In addition I added about 2tbsp of honey to the sauce.  This will be a long time favorite for us!

Love the salad....great for gatherings! When I made the peanut butter dressing the first time, I found the peanut butter/tahini a bit too overpowering and the sauce a bit off. I've since modified it and use a bit less tahini and added a bit of lime juice and coriander and I noticed it made a big difference and brought out the fresh cilantro flavor. Also I used sriracha chili sauce found in most asian store or ethnic aisles of grocery stores.

It's a great salad to bring to a potluck, or make ahead of time for dinner guests.  It's colorful from the red, green, and yellow peppers and grated carrots, crunchy from the napa cabbage, and finished with chopped cilantro and green onions.  The sauce is delicious.  Toss to coat the noodles, and you have a very impressive salad.  People will be asking you for this recipe!  I didn't have sweet chili sauce so I combined ketchup and shirrachi sauce until it felt like the right taste.

Thank you! This is very similar to a recipe in the Neiman Marcus cookbook (that I couldn't find when I needed it!). I omitted the toasted sesame seeds and just eyeballed the dressing ingredients. Next time, I'll add more cabbage cuz I love it!

We LOVED this recipe!!!!! Used chicken breast instead of shrimp, subbed almond butter for tahini because this was all I had, used whole wheat spaghetti, and julienned all the veggies. It was amazing, I ate it all the next day for leftovers!!!!  Thank you!

AWESOME!!!!!
I used rice stick noodles and didn't have any sesame seeds or peanuts (which would have made it even better). Added about 2 lbs of shrimp to make it more of a meal. Hubby LOVED it and gobbled up all the leftovers too :)

This was very good. Forgot the sesame seeds and the peanuts but I don't think they were missed. I did tweak the sauce to what I had on hand and to taste, no tahini, added some srirrachi and more chili sauce. Served with Thai Style BBQ Chicken. Will make again. Thanks

Absolutely excellent sauce.  I turned out surprisingly well. I am sure the recipe was great as written but did some subs to use what I had on hand and turned out great.   Instead of shrimp, I used my microwave pressure cooker on chicken 6 minutes in a teaspoon each of soy sauce, rice wine vinegar and sesame oil and thinly sliced and then cut into bite size lengths.   Since I had "Excellent Flour Stick" - a quick boil noodle from the Philipines I picked up in a previous asian market spree - I used that.  The "noodle" has coconut oil in complimenting the sauce.  I used Mann Broccoli slaw instead of napa cabbage and mini salad multicollar peppers.  I also used a teaspoon of sabal oelek instead of a sweet chili sauce and upped the brown sugar to a tablespoon and a half.

I really enjoyed this dish.  My husband did not, but he doesn't really like the flavors in Thai dishes.  I used all red bell pepper because that is what I had on had and chicken instead of shrimp.  I also added extra Thai chili sauce - I love that stuff!  It was better after sitting for a couple of days.

Shockingly good.  Instead of angel hair pasta, I used rice vermicelli, and I omitted the shrimp and peanuts (made up for these by using crunchy peanut butter).  Otherwise, made the recipe exactly as listed.  Great way to get some veggies!

Flavorful and easy! It's a recipe that is better the next day, when all the ingredients are the same temperature. --Shortcut: I used a bagged cabbage/carrot mix. I was making 1/2 recipe so I didn't want the HUGE napa cabbage. It worked really well and cut the prep time down. Also, I used mini sweet peppers because they were cheaper than the bell peppers. I sprinkled with chopped cashews...this really was a great recipe! Pretty easy too, if you keep your pantry stocked with Asian ingredients & spices.

Tahini was too hard to find so I used Pad Thai sauce which was available at our grocery.  I also used crunchy LaChoy Rice Noodles over the top for a bit more crunch and texture.

The dressing was pretty tasty, but the pasta salad was only OK. If I make it again, I'll probably use chicken instead of shrimp and add more veggies. Also, I highly recommend tasting the dressing before adding salt. For my taste buds, there was plenty of salty flavor from the soy sauce. I didn't add any salt at all. If you like spice, adding a teaspoon or two of sriracha to the dressing added a nice kick.

Delicious!  I added more shrimp (halved the recipe, doubled the shrimp) to make it more of a main course salad.  The sauce was perfect - flavorful without being too spicy.  It is very easy to prepare this recipe ahead of time and throw it all together before serving.

Only thing I would change is a little less vinegar in the dressing and maybe more tahini than peanut butter as it was quite peanuty.

I used sunflower nut butter instead of peanut butter to make it allergy friendly.  Tasted great!

Ok, so as written, I gave the recipe 4 stars. With the changes I made the second go-round it got 5 stars. This was very mild to be a thai salad but had great flavor. SO, the second time I doubled the sauce, added more chili sauce as well as some crushed red pepper and a little sriracha chili sauce (the stuff with the rooster on the bottle). It got rave reviews. Thanks for the recipe!

I made this for a cookout.  I didn't add the shrimp and only had one yellow pepper at home and a few heads of broccoli.  So I put the one pepper in and lightly cooked the broccoli instead.  I also used chives from my garden instead of green onions.  AMAZING.  It was gone so quickly that I didn't even get to have any.

This recipe was quite yummy! I followed the directions plus added some mushrooms and some zucchini b/c I happened to have it handy and love it! :) My whole family really liked the outcome! I might add a little extra soy sauce next time though.

This was good. Even though I cut the pasta in half and kept the same amount of sauce, the peanut butter flavor wasn't strong enough for me. I added more peanut butter and used whole wheat noodles. It was also too salty for me, so the added salt was definitely not needed.

Very flexible recipe!  Made ahead for weekday work lunches.  I know people get annoyed with too many substitutions but with this kind of salad I think it's okay - the dressing is the real recipe!    Used wholewheat spaghettini, omitted the cabbage and replaced it with corn, red pepper and sprouts.  Subbed shrimp for chicken.  Packs and keeps well for bag lunches, better than if I ran out to the deli!

We made this to pack for lunches.  I mixed the noodles with half the sauce and the fresh veggies with the other half the sauce.  I put the noodles in the tupperware topped with the veggies then the peanuts and sesame seeds on top.  (This was to keep the veggies from getting limp and ugly and the seeds from getting soggy.)  Yum!  We had people eyeing our lunch and wishing it was theirs. :)  Unfortunately, as another reviewer commented, it is a not a 'quick' recipe, but worth the work.

This is a great recipe.  I did not add the shrimp and I also could not find tahini sauce so I didn't use that either.  Very tasty!

Awesome. Delicious. Used peanut butter only instead of the tahini because I didn't have any. Skipped cilantro, but still many complex flavours.

This is pretty good, my first attempt at Thai food.  It was way too salty for my tastes.  I didn't use tahini, sweet chili sauce, or black sesame seeds because I couldn't find them.  I also just now realized that I forgot to add the cabbage, darn it!  It made a ton.  I'll probably make it again.

This is a great go-to recipe and can be modified any number of ways to suit your taste. I added a tsp of Sriracha sauce but Thai garlic chile would be the same thing. Doubled the dressing per other suggestions - good call!  Note: I make my own Tahini and it's super inexpensive. I buy sesame seeds from a bulk grocer for a few dollars a pound and toast in a cast iron skillet over low heat. Then into the food processor and grind away. Sometimes I add a few drops of sesame oil then store in a jelly jar in the fridge.

The peanut butter/ tahini combo with the chili sauce really makes this dish.  I used imitation crab due to allergies, thai rice noodles instead of pasta, and added a healthy dose of siracha becuase we like things spicy.

Nice recipe, I didn't add salt, followed other reviewers and added lime juice and extra sugar, I also replaced half the soy sauce with fish sauce, and tossed on some toasted coconut with the peanuts and sesame seeds. Made with vegetables and rice noodles to go under some sweet barbeque ribs and it was fab.

Very tasty,  I didn't use tahini because I don't like it.  I upped the Peanut Butter and rice vinager to 1/3 cup each and added at least 1/2 cup of sweet chili sauce to taste, I also added a bit of curry.  I used seitan and marinated tofu and it was awesome!  Oh, I also only used one large red pepper because I hate green peppers.

Good and a great make-ahead lunch option

Subbed rice noodles and used sesame flavored chilli oil rather than sesame oil.  Kinda forgot the soy and like it w/o

This is such a great salad!!! Very healthy and everyone, even my husband loved it. This is a keeper. I didn't have any Tahini but used oyster sauce instead. Don't know if that made a difference but I know oyster is really good in oriental cooking. Yum you want to try this recipe!

Really quite good!  Restaurant quality even.  I have 2 suggestions:  don't add the salt to the dressing, as it is plenty salty already.  (And if you taste the dressing before you put it on the salad, don't be scared off by the saltiness of it - once it is on the salad, the veggies soak up the dressing and "cut" the salt taste).  Also, if you like ginger, I suggest grating about 1 tbsp. into the dressing, as ginger tends to flavour Asian/fusion recipes well.  One last comment:  it does take quite a bit of time to chop all the veggies, using a pre-packaged mix as one reviewer suggested is a fantastic idea!  A great recipe, thanks for submitting!

This was very tasty. I made two slight changes. First, I didn't have any cooked shrimp on hand so I used raw shrimp and lightly seasoned it with Chinese Five Spice and grilled it up.  Secondly, I added a bit of fresh ginger to the dressing.  This would be a great dish for a potluck.   I highly recommend it!

There are such great, bold, fresh flavors in this recipe; we loved it!!  I did substitute dried, crushed red pepper flakes for the black pepper, but other than that I made this exactly as written, and it was outstanding!!  We're looking forward to the leftovers tomorrow.  I think this would also work well with chicken instead of shrimp.  Thanks so much for sharing this great recipe!!  The only trick to this recipe is finding a store that carries Tahini; the end result is definitely worth the effort!

I made this tonight for me and my wife, and it was delicious!  I loved it, and I followed the recipe almost exactly.  I adjusted the recipe for a 16 oz box of pasta, b/c that is what I had and I didn't want to have 4 oz of dry angel hair hanging out in the pantry.  Because I'm lazy, I nuked a frozen "fajita" mix of peppers and onions and substituted that instead of slicing a bunch of peppers, and I used pre-shredded carrots.  These convenience products made this a fairly quick and easy dish to throw together, and I loved it.  My wife ate it heartily as well, and she's not really a fan of Thai food.  Next time I might try adding some fresh basil and ginger, and maybe some lime juice as well, just b/c those are flavors I love in Thai food, but really I think this is a great recipe!  Anyone who thinks this is bland must have been stingy with the chili sauce!  (The 16 oz. box yielded a lot of leftovers, so I'm already looking forward to lunch tomorrow!)

Loved this recipe, esp the sauce. Very similar to Pad Thai. Used cole slaw mix instead of the napa and slice carrots. Cilantro as garnish (like pad thai) Use "normal" onions sliced thin. Sauce could, possible use a little spicing up. The only thing I will do different the NEXT time I make this is a little less peanut butter. I love peanut butter but the suggested amount makes the sauce a little too thick for me. But, for me and DH, seriously great recipe. Maybe Mung Bean Sprouts if you've got some handy.

This was fantastic! I used chicken instead of shrimp (I had one of those ready to eat roasted chickens in the fridge from the night before, so I just chopped the leftovers up, I didn't use tahini, I used apple cider vinegar, cuz that's what I had, and olive oil instead of sesame oil. I also cut the recipe in half. It turned out great! Don't skimp on the peanuts! They really make the salad!

This was great!  We used rice noodles instead and coleslaw mix (as one of the other reviewers suggested) in place of the shredded cabbage and carrot.  Easy!  We also sauteed the veggies to soften them a bit and make this more of a stir fry than salad.  The sauce has incredible flavor!  It might be a bit strong for some but can easily be diluted with broth or coconut milk.  This is a keeper!

I love this salad, it was huge hit at my dinner party!!! I did change somethings and added a bit as well. Instead of using napa cabbage I used Bok Choy, I also added a cup of chopped Cucumber and used 1/2 cup of sweet chilli rather then just a 1/4 cup!!! Love this recipe...looking forwarded to using it as a meal with grilled chicken on top!!!!

The dressing for this is amazing. I used three ingredients for the salad itself-matchstick carrots, chickpeas, then cilantro at the very end atfer adding the dressing. I did add 2 Tablespoons of honey, as did another reviewer. It does in my opinion need a bit of spice but I am not sure what-salt, or something with a kick like hot pepper?? Great nonetheless!!! Everybody loved it.

Really good. But had WAY TOO MUCH black sesame seeds.  I actually like sesame seeds, but couldn't tolerate this much.  Recipe calls for 2 CUPS as a garnish.  I would reduce it to t TABLESPOONS.  My guess is that was a mistake or typo.

My 15 guests and I thought this was a wonderful salad.  In spite of second/third helpings, we had leftovers! I used chicken instead of shrimp and about half the cilantro. It needed salt & I added extra dressing.  The dressing is good for other purposes, e.g. a Thai wrap dip, similar to those made at Good Earth restaurants. (Just wrap favorite ingredients, like couscous, green onions, chicken, etc.) Thank you!

I really liked the dressing and would even use that for another recipe! The salad was very generous. I substituted Chicken for the shrimp and that was still very tasty. I would use fewer Black sesame seeds, but they add a nice flavor and visual presentation

One of our all-time favorites! We don’t do the sesame seeds or the shrimp, and we add crushed red pepper flakes. It’s well worth the chopping and mixing effort

Excellent dish! Ended up subsituted the Napa cabbage for bok choy due to availability at the local store. Also if you are looking to make it spicy it pairs well with either chili paste or Sriracha. Will definitely make again!

I first made this salad for a potluck while I was living in Hawaii. The generous amount made it a perfect fit for a crowd.  I tasted the sauce while I was making it and thought it seemed powerful but it’s perfect for all the noodles and veggies.  I couldn’t do gluten at that time so I used bean threads instead and cut them, after soaking, with kitchen shears to manageable lengths.  Everyone absolutely raved over this salad!  Since then I’ve made it probably about 20 times for various groups and parties.  I’ve had to vary the sauce ingredients a little sometimes because I haven’t had something on hand and it’s never gone wrong because I’ve kept those incredible flavors top of mind.  The tahini is a must—fish sauce and lime can be a great addition as well as some lemongrass. YUM!  Perfect summer salad!

This recipe was really bland did not taste anything like a Thai dish. The sauce was quite thick and the tahini overpowered the peanut and other Asian staple flavors.  I wish that I would have halved the recipe the first time I made it - now we have so much left over!  I would not make it again.

Delicious!!! Made it without shrimp and with rice noodles instead of angel hair pasta.  The delicious sauce was reminiscent of pad Thai.  Will make again.

Insanely delicious! I'd give it more stars if I could, & so would our group of cabin guests that scarfed down this noodley-goodness. Makes a HUGE bowl. Took 7 adults 2 days to finish this off! One guy ate it for breakfast! I did some things differently, because of convenience & what I had on hand & also personal preference. I used thin spaghetti noodles, broken into thirds. I think angel hair would be too wimpy for this sauce. Rice/cellophane noodles would work nicely,too. I used pre-packaged shredded cabbage, saves time. I grated my own carrots, easy & I think the pre-shredded ones are nasty tasting. I used two big carrots & discovered that was plenty. No need to peel them! Couldn't find blk. sesame seeds & was planning to use regular, toasted sesame seeds but forgot! Didn't miss 'em, either! I shredded 2 leftover lrg. grilled chix breasts instead of shrimp. I love shrimp but prefer chicken in this dish. Grilled shrimp would be tasty in here, though. I also added about 1 1/2 cups of pea pods, cut into thirds & microwaved for about 30 sec. w/ 2  TB.of water to take some of the "rawness" out, but still had some crunch. Yummy! Didn't have tahini, so skipped it & used 2 extra TB. of peanut butter. Also used about 1 cup of the sweet chili sauce. It's in the Asian section of your grocery store. Added 1/2 can of cream of coconut. Coconut milk works, too. WARNING: SKIP the 1 TB of salt! Soy sauce is enough salt! I used juice of 1 lime to fix it, but loved the lime in this!

This one's a keeper!  Made it "as is " the first time, and it was a hit.  Subsequent times, I skipped the salt (lots in the soya sauce and peanut butter already), and added a bit of lime juice. Even better!  Gluten-free spaghetti noodles hold up just fine in this recipe, and leftovers keep well. (Because unless you're feeding a small army, plan on leftovers. This recipe makes a ton. Use the biggest bowl you've got!)

Make the dressing the day before to avoid that "it's missing something" feeling.  Definitely use lite or low-sodium soy sauce.  Makes a ton even using 1/2 box of angle hair pasta.  Doesn't really need the shrimp but I love it, so in it went!  Would be great with chicken, tofu, or left vegetarian.  I didn't have tahini and avoided the mistake I've made in the past of adding more peanut butter.  Just use the amount of pb stated and ignore the need to substitute anything for the tahini.  Otherwise the pb flavor can be overwhelming.  So good!

Fast and yummy. I didn't have cabbage, tahini or black toasted sesame seeds so I skipped those and added more carrots. I did at lime and a mint garnish and both were a great improvement!

Love it! We have this once a week! The sauce amazing!  I double the noodles, sauce, and use 2lbs of medium sized shrimp.  Use fresh garlic, cut the soy sauce by just a bit, and squeeze with fresh lime just before serving.  Sub different veggies depending on what you have.  yum yum yum!

My sister and I don't eat shrimp, so instead I used pork cut in small pieces, and fried with som soysauce :)
I also fried the vegetables in a fryingpan lightly, to make the dish a bit warmer :)
Family loved it!

This was very yummy.  I didn't use the tahini because I couldn't find it in any store near me, but it didn't taste like it was missing anything.  Using all the fresh veggies makes it very yummy.  Next time I will use less noodles to try to make it healthier.

This was a nice enough salad, but just didn't taste authentic. Had some great ideas, but also a couple of odd ones. Probably wouldn't make this particular dish again, even though everyone ate it.

To coat all of the noodles and vegetables completely, the sauce recipe needs to be doubled.

This rating is for the sauce. I liked this sauce better than another recipe i have tried here in AR. The only thing I changed is omitting the tahini. Ive never tried tahini before so I browsed the internet looking for an alternative and a few have suggested to use peanut butter and sesame oil to it. The ingredients already have pb and sesame so i thought omitting would be ok. Mind you, this is not for everyone's taste.

I thought this was pretty good but for my taste I would add more dressing. I doubled the shrimp but also couldn't find sweet chili sauce so I used a regular chili sauce. Left out the tahini since I didn't have any. Had to add some water to think out the very thick dressing. Tasty and it make a HUGE bowl.

Excellent, easy recipe!  I skipped the sesame seeds & chopped peanuts, since my teens with braces get annoyed with those.  I couldn't find "sweet chili sauce", but I found a Thai Sweet Red Pepper sauce instead.  It turned out pretty spicy for my kid's tastes though, so I threw in a can of coconut milk to soften it up a bit.  YUMMY!!!!

This is definitely a recipe you can play around with, adding whatever veggies and/or meats to suit your taste.  

I used chicken (cooked in oven with some salt & pepper, butter & soy sauce), red peppers, shredded carrots, snow pea pods (lightly steamed), cucumbers, napa cabbage, green onions and cilantro.

Adding this one to our regular meal list - thank you!!!

This salad is so good! I make it at least once a month and have it for lunch and dinner the next day. 
I usually double the dressing, I like a little more sauce. And it's good hot or cold!

This was great.  I didn't follow the recipe exactly, left out the meat because we're vegetarians, and substituted here and there with the vegetables I had on hand. I mixed everything together an hour or so before we ate and let it marinate in the frig.  The leftovers the next day were very good too, it didn't get mushy.  I spent a summer in Taiwan in college, and this reminds me of noodle dishes I used to find at a vegetarian restaurant in Taipei.  Very light and summery, not like the heavy food I find in local Asian restaurants.  Thanks for the recipe.

Good, a nice change of pace for a bag lunch.  I omitted the shrimp and sesame seeds and used different noodles.  Took it to work with the sauce separate and added it right before eating.  A nice kick, filling, and something I can feel good about eating.  Thanks
