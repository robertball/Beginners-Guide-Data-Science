Very nice as written.  I have also made it with half the kielbasa, chicken broth for all the liquid, and no thickener; and have also been very happy with the result.  Thank you for the recipe.

The smokiness of the onions and sausage really come through in this soup. I was amazed at how flavorful it was with such few ingredients. I only let my potatoes simmer for 30 minutes because I wanted the texture and also I prefer my soups thinner. It needed more than just a pinch of salt but other than that I have no complaints. I do think celery would be a nice addition the next time I make this. Thanks for the great recipe!

This was an ok rainy day meal. I will say it was extremely thick as written. I ended up using twice the water suggested and it was still very thick. Next time I will add celery and red pepper, for flavour and colour.

Oh, yum!  I made this as written, with one small change:  I added two chicken bouillon cubes to the soup, because I thought it might need a little "something extra."  This was really great soup, and it was exceptionally easy.  Everyone in the family, including my "I don't like soup" son, loved it.  Next time, I may add chopped celery and carrot, but really, it doesn't need a thing.  Thanks for a great recipe.

I was looking for a way to use elk cheddar sausage. My husband smoked the sausage on the grill and added just before adding the water. I also saut√©ed 2 garlic cloves with onions and included diced celery and a handful of chopped carrots for color. I only cooked the soup for 40 minutes. I topped it off with shredded Colby jack cheese before serving. Be sure to add a little milk when reheating to thin it out. My husband loved this soup! Definitely a keeper!

All I had was a pound of fresh ground sausage and frozen red potatoes. I usually just look for recipes for ideas anyways as I rarely follow a recipe exact. This was really good. I think I added more chicken broth than called for. I'm making it again tonight.

I added a full bunch of shredded fresh spinach, for color and vitamins, used turkey sausage and a pinch of red pepper. Fantastic soup.

This soup was excellent.  I like thick soups, especially potato soup.  I used fresh potatoes and shredded them with a food processor.  I used more than 20 oz (almost 2 lbs) since the water content is higher than it is in frozen hash browns.  Also added chicken bouillon and bok choy ribs (since I saw people recommend celery and I had bok choy, but not celery.)

I really was not expecting much and just was trying to get rid of too much Kielbasa (dang you Costco!!). This soup was simple, forgiving and delicious! I opted to use butter instead of olive oil (mmmm, potatoes, onions and butter), used only Kielbasa and added red chili flakes for a little bit of heat. Garnished with sharp cheddar and green onion. This soup is perfect for a rainy or cold day!

The first time, I followed the recipe and found that it was easy to make and quite tasty, hence the 4 rating.   And the use of the Simply Potatoes product was brilliant.  But the real beauty of this soup is that you can do lots of things with it to suit your tastes.  
  The second time I made this soup I made some small changes based on other suggestions, and I liked it even better.  I used chicken broth rather than water, I used only 12oz of smoked sausage and no other protein, a pinch of ground red pepper, and just 1/8c flour and 1/8cbutter rather than 1/4 c of flour and 1/4c butter.  (This made it a bit less thick.)  Best change of all was my own:  to serve it with a bit of sauerkraut in each bowl.  So good!
  Thanks so much for posting this really great, basic recipe.

I used two cartons of low sodium chicken broth instead of water. I used 4 cups of frozen shredded potatoes.  Added two stalks of celery diced small and a hefty tablespoon of diced garlic. My kids sprinkled bacon bits and cheese on top.  We ate it with crescent rolls and even my super picky husband loved it. Definitely will make again!

This soup didn't have any taste to it at all. After I added a lot of salt it tasted better. I also do not like how greasy it is, I would suggest draining the grease after cooking the sausages. I will not be making this again

Awesome soup!  My husband & I love this.  I added spicy smoked sausage because we both like spicy foods & a bag of the diced Simply potatoes. It's such an easy delicious recipe.
