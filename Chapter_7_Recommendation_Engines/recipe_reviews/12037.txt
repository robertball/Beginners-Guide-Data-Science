This recipe works for a crowd. Use defrosted frozen peas (very tasty) and add some chopped celery if you have it. Make a dressing of milk, light mayo, a bit of cole slaw dressing if you like for added creaminess and sweetness, and a bit of dill relish or chopped dills with some of the juice.  You can also throw in a can of potato sticks to add some crunch. This should be served chilled.

i made this recipe for my food technology assignment at school. It tasted great and looked good too! i added kidney beans as well, which added some extra colour and increased the fibre content.
Thanks for the recipe!

I wasn't too sure about the peas, so I used a can of corn (I love tuna and corn). I wasn't crazy about the lettuce, but I guess I'm not used to having it in pasta salad. This made a nice light lunch. Thanks!

This is the best tuna pasta salad I've ever had. I made it for my family and they absolutely love it! It's a perfect salad for a hot day!

I used spinach, broccoli, onion, and mushroom with rotini pasta and italian dressing. Also my hubby likes his meat, so I used 2 cans of tuna and served cold. Yum!

Great basic recipe my entire family enjoys.  (Note:  I don't add cheese and I use frozen peas instead of what recipe calls for.)

This was pretty good we just weren't too crazy about the peas so next time I am going to take a chance with rinsed black beans--I know, sounds a little weird but worth a try!

this recipe says it's 6 servings. only if it's being served as a side dish ... i'd say this is 3 servings, tops. the only thing i did differently was adding red onion. i used lite italian dressing.

The whole family scarfed it down. Perfect quick dinner on t-ball night!

I used greek dressing instead because that's what I had, but otherwise stuck to the recipe.

Very filling and light. Perfect for a hot day. I omitted the dressing and didn't fully drain my tuna (in oil). Just add salt and pepper to taste.

Tasty and easy to make! I prefer balsamic dressing, but this would be good even without any dressing at all!

I added capers to the salad for a pop of flavor. It is super easy to make and kept well in the fridge for 3 days of meals.
