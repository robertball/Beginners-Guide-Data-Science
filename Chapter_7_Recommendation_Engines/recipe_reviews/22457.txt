I am always glad to get recipes using fresh pears, as I have an abundant of them this time of year. This was very good, especially the crust. I dotted the top of mine with butter because I thought that topping needed some help. It appeared very dry. Maybe next time I will cut some butter in with the topping mix. I also had to cook it about 40 minutes, and the pears were still a little bit crisp, but it was delicious. I will use this recipe again and again. Thanks for sharing it.

Went together fast and got rave reviews from my coworkers, esp. the pecan crust. I threw in some extra spices, like nutmeg, allspice and sloves, to the sugar mixture sprinkled over the pears.

what a pain in the neck.  maybe this was due to the 4 different pies i was making that day -- but the ripe pears were hard to peel and slice beautifully.  this did NOT come out looking like the picture.  i won't be fooling with this one again.
