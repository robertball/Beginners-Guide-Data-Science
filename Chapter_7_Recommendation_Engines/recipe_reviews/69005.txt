This was so good!  The first time I made it the sauce didn't quite coat all the noodles so we added some extra butter to them.  After making this recipe again, I doubled the sauce and it was more than enough to cover all the noodles.  1.5 servings of the sauce may be more appropriate, but it was better to have extra than not enough.

This is a simple, flavorful chicken. I used two shortcuts. I skipped the roasted garlic step and just used crushed garlic and I used soup chicken rather than chicken breasts. I would recommend the first shortcut but not the second.

This was great.  I put it over brown rice instead of noodles.  I would also recommend doubling the sauce.  It was the best part.

Yummy, but not over the top amazing.  

I wanted to try this recipe as written so I could tailor it to our tastes.  Having now tried it as written, I would definitely double the sauce (as said in previous reviews).  I will also cut the chicken into strips, as I think it would really add to the dish.  My favorite bites were those with chicken and noodles.  Egg noodles weren't necessary.  Use any noodle on hand.  I will also thicken the sauce a little next time.

Overall, a very enjoyable meal, and I will definitely make this again.

This was one of the best chicken dishes I've had in a while, and I'm giving this the full 5 stars, but only after my adjustments, which were not major.  Most importantly, I used half the amount of chicken, so if you're following the recipe as written, double everything but the chicken, or the sauce will not be sufficient.  I cut the raw chicken into bite sized pieces before tossing in flour, and deep fried it until light brown.  Everything else I did the same, except I fried the chives in the sauce for a few minutes at the end.  This was devoured!

I just made this for the second time, using the 4 person recipe. It turned out MUCH better using the original quantities than scaling down. If you're cooking for two, just make fewer noodles and only cook 2 chicken breasts. I wish I had taken a picture before we ate because it was really pretty this time, too. Just make sure to plan ahead for the 30 minutes to roast the garlic! Otherwise, the recipe doesn't take long to make at all.

This was incredible.  The key to this recipe is roasting the garlic.  You will not achieve the appropriate flavor without that step.

absolutely fantastic!! the flavors are beautiful together and quite light! I only made a few small additions - I used a dry white wine to deglaze the pan before adding my garlic/juice mixture...and I also added a little cornstarch at the end to thicken the sauce - doubling the sauce ingredients also helps for better outcome :) Enjoy!

Fabulous and light!  We made two changes:  only 2 chicken breasts (since it was dinner for 2) and we used angel hair pasta since that was what we had.  We will DEFINITELY be making this again.  If you're in a pinch for time, I agree with the other reviewers -- skip the roasted garlic (which is delicious) and use minced garlic packed in oil.  Thanks for a great dinner!

I was searching for a dairy free recipe with chicken & egg noodles and came across this one. I subbed olive oil for the butter & it was great! I'm sure it would be fantastic with butter, but my son can't have it, so olive oil it is.  I did double the sauce recipe- definitely a must! There was barely enough sauce even with doubling it! I also used 2 chicken breasts to stretch it and cut it into strips and tossed into the pasta.

We found this absolutely delicous!  The sauce is just right; light and buttery, the chicken tender and moist. Quick and easy to throw together anytime.

I found this recipe while searching for ways to use up a bunch of fresh chives I had-- this was a perfect way to use them. Everyone was right about the sauce-- make extra or the noodles will just suck it up.  I loved the light flavor and it was very filling.

This was delicious!! This was better than any food I've had in a restaurant in a long time. I had to make a couple of changes though, so I may not be rating this recipe exactly. I prefer turkey to chicken so I used turkey breast. I also forgot to pick up chicken broth so I used white wine instead.

This was a simple but delicious meal! I only used 2 chicken breasts and cut them up into strips. But I almost doubled the sauce after reading reviews. It ended up being a little more sauce than needed, but a little more is better than not enough! I also added some cornstarch and about 1/4 cup or so of white wine to the sauce. Yummm. I'll going to try this again!

I followed the recipe to the T but doubled the sauce per reviews and so glad I did....I didnt want to like this when I took my first bite - it was a bit too lemony for me and I would have liked a more garlic kick (roasting the garlic makes the flavor more subtle - but I love roasted garlic) so next time I think I will cut back on the lemon and add some minced garlic along with the roasted.  With all that being said I ended up eating two servings of this and licking my plate - It was very delicious and the more I ate it the more I wanted to eat - LOL
EDIT:  Made this for the whole family and used a lemon grown by a friend (and cut back a little this time)  It was just about perfect!!  Everyone liked it alot - Thank you

mmm I made this on a whim for dinner tonight and very tasty! I did not have  a whole lemon so just used lemon juice, as well as crushed garlic instead of roasting it. I agree with other posts, if you like sauce, be sure to make extra!

This is really good. I gave it 4 stars becauase I don't think it's "the best" but definitely good enough to put into our rotation. I cut up the chix into bite-sized pieces and mixed everything together

I made this with one chicken breast but kept the sauce amount the same. I heeded other reviews and used the juice and zest of half a lemon; Also added a small pinch of lemon pepper. Despite using a really large bulb of garlic (roasted), I didn't think it was nearly garlicky enough. Next time I will make it with two. This was good but with a couple of tweaks, it could be really amazing. Thanks!

One word - lemony!  The chicken was good, but the sauce, in particular the garlic, was SOUR!  A whole lemon's worth of juice was too much.

I agree with other reviewers about the sauce.  We doubled it, and were glad we did.  I think I'll try adding cream instead of butter next time... just curious.
My sister was over, and said she wished we had made broccoli, and I think that would have been perfect.

I made the recipe as directed and my family loved it.  I didn't change a thing except I pounded the chicken breasts with a meat tenderizer mallot before cooking.  It helped make the chicken more tender and moist.  I will definitely make this dish again!

Tasted fantastic. I used a garlic egg noodle and added 1/3 of dry white wine. It was just enough to add some flavor without overpowering the other flavors.

Awesome flavors!!! I only used two chicken breasts rather than four, eliminated the noodles, and served it over wild rice. The only other cooking method I changed was after lightly browning the floured chicken in a CAST IRON pan, I added the rest of the ingredients, placed the cast iron (and lightly placed foil over it) directly in a preheated 425 oven, and in 8 mins, 165 chicken temp check,  added butter and chives!

This dish is incredible! The only two things I did differently were to cut the boneless chicken into 1-2" cubes so they would cook faster and served it over rigatoni instead of noodles -- we like pasta better than egg noodles.  I will definitely be making this again! YUM!!

Delicious! I used spaghetti pasta and 5 chicken breast tenders (which is more like 1/2 the amount of chicken the recipe calls for). With less meat, the amount of sauce was sufficient. I will make it again, though I will add some seasoning on the chicken next time to give it a little more taste.

I was looking for something different to do with chicken tonight and came across this recipe. I followed it pretty much the way it was written except I added another 2 cups of chicken stock, and I didn't add the lemon zest. I was worried about it being too lemony. I also didn't add the total amount of chive, I just sprinkled some. I ended up adding a couple of tablespoons of flour to thicken up the sauce. I also sprinkled salt/pepper/garlic powder on my chicken before flouring.  I thought the recipe was great and will make it again.

This tasted really good, but my "sauce" thickened so much trying to finish cooking the chicken it wasn't a sauce anymore! Maybe that's why some reviewers said they made double! Anyway, my hubby liked it and I did too...I even roasted the garlic...that was really easy! I will try it again and add more "sauce".

I cheated and just used minced garlic instead of roasting it.  This was partly because I didn't feel like taking the extra time, and partly because I don't really care whether it's roasted or not.    I thought it was a bit time-consuming even without that extra time.  It was fairly good but would've been much better if the flavor of the sauce could come out more.  But rather than doubling the sauce, I'd prefer halving the noodles.  That's just a LOT of noodles and I think totally unnecessary.  (Or maybe halve the noodles *and* double the sauce. :-))  I did not think it too lemony at all, which is a little strange, because I prefer lemon to be subtle and usually would be the first to say it's too much.  Dunno.

I can barely cook toast and I was able to make this easily and it tasted like I knew what I was doing. The 2 year old loved it and he won't eat anything but gummy bears! I'll be adding it to my "staples"! Agree with others to double the sauce. Thanks!

I loved this recipe. So simple and quick! The sauce is just perfect as is, very light and I love the lemon, garlic flavor. My son is my toughest critic and he loved it.

This was very delicious and simple to make, but I did make a couple of changes. I didn't have chives or fresh lemons so I did some improvising. I threw some frozen broccoli in with the noodles to add some greenery.  Instead of the fresh lemon, I used bottled. Also I added some pinot grigio to the sauce. The only thing I would do differently next time would be to double the delicious sauce.

This recipe was simple and so tasty it all got eaten so I had no leftovers for lunch. I added a couple teaspoons of cornstarch to thicken the sauce, and chunked the chicken into pieces.

OMG, this is the world's best recipe that i've tried. i love it, but i made simple moderation. people said it was to lemony so i didn't add lemon zest. and when the chicken and garlic sauce was in the pan i added marinara sauce. this recipe was DELICIOUS. i'm gonna make it again.

I used one lemon, per reviews, and freeze-dried chives, and scaled the sauce 1.5x more. The sauce was barely adequate for the amount of pasta I made, but tasty all the same. I'll double the sauce next time and try fresh chives.

Try this recipe with lime rather than lemon juice and zest. It turns out a lot more citric and festive.

Pretty good but nothing special.  I just used chopped garlic instead of roasted because I was short on time.
