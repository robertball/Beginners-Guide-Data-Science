I absolutely love this recipe!  I found it on here a few years ago, and with a few minor tweaks it is the best pfefferneusse I've ever had (the closest to my grandmother's recipe I've been able to find)  The changes I made:  increase the butter and molasses to 1/2 cup each, and double the cinnamon and nutmeg.  Do not, under any circumstances, increase the ginger as it will make your cookies taste soapy.  This cookie is great to give away and I get begged for the recipe every year.

They're awesome! This recipe is very good and accurate even if it's short. I think these peppernuts are excellent also with teas and herbal infusions. My mother, who is a conservative of the Italian cuisine found them fantastic. Just, if you can, make them all of the same dimension. Scarlet from Italy

These are such cute little cookies. Unfortunately, I didn't really care for them. I followed the recipe exactly as far as the ingredients are concerned. The only exception I was forced to make was the fructose - I couldn't find it anywhere in my area. I used confectioner's sugar. These basically tast like flour - with and without the sugar coating. I rolled some into balls as suggested in the recipe, but chose to make the little "pillows" by rolling a rope and cutting that into small pieces. Sorry, but we just didn't enjoy them.

I kinda went off the guidlines with this one, and made them with rolled oats. They are awesome! Like soft ginger snaps or oatmeal ginger bread. Also, I used on;y slenda for baking and no molasses. Still, these are great!

Just like my grandmother used to bake - served them at our Christmas Tree Trimming party and they were a hit.

I started by following the basic recipe. The dough looked a little dry, so I went with the other reviewer's instructions to raise the molasses and butter to 1/2 c and double the cinnamon and nutmeg. NEXT time, though, I will also reduce the flour, maybe by 2 tablespoons. But the flavor is great--THIS is a keeper!
