This is a delicious way to get children to eat CORN!!! I made this a while ago and was a bit shocked that it wasn't the usual type of corn pudding. Since I love corn bread, it's like another version of it. DELICIOUS!
I had to double it though because I always cook for over 15 people.

The flavor was ok, nothing amazing.  The texture, however, I had problems with.  After reading the previous review and seeing that this was supposed to be turned out onto a wire rack to finish cooling I was expecting more of a cornbread consistency, but I got something in between a pudding and a bread.  Definitely too loose to dump out onto a wire rack even though the toothpick came out clean when tested in several spots after baking for the full hour.  Will definitely not make again.

This was fabulous! I made it into muffins by skipping the milk and cream of corn. The seasoning and moisture was fabulous. I put it in the oven at 375 for 11 minutes.

I added a little more cinnamon and a dash of ginger to mine.  It was ever so tasty!

Super easy to make. The house smells amazing and the dish is so tasty. I followed the recipe exactly and it came out great. No need to make any changes or worry about taste or consistency. I was nervous about the amount of cloves but it wasnâ€™t overpowering at all!!! Highly recommended!!! This ones going to make the holiday list from now on.
