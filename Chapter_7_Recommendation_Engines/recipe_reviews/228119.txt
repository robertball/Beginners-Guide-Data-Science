This was surprisingly good. We were missing more ingredients than i thought before i started but we made it anyway. It still turned out great. My casserole with just had tater tots, taco seasoned ground beef cooked with diced onion, and shredded cheese. Sprinkle fresh diced tomato (post bake) and a sour cream mixed with taco sauce. It was delicious! We will definitely make again. Maybe next time with more ingredients.

Yummy! I kept the lettuce and sour cream off the top so that it could be added by the eater and it could easily be reheated without wilting lettuce. I added bacon on top just for a little extra flavor. Turned out great even though I reversed the order of the tomatoes and cheese sauce. I also mixed the tomatoes and olives before putting it on so that they were better spread over the entire thing.

This recipe is packed with flavor. My family loved it!!! My 7 yr old son gave it Two overall excited thumbs up. The only  thing I changed was instead of black olives I used a can of black bean since this is what I had on hand. One of the most flavorful Casseroles I've made. YUMMY:]

It was alright.  My kids and hubby didn't dig it.  I'm thinking the tater tots threw them off a little.  I was missing sour cream but I don't think that would have changed opinions.  Won't be making this again. It was easy and it was tonight's dinner.

The first time I made this for a big family get together (which for us are always potluck) I had no leftovers. I've made it for almost every get together ever since. My family loves it, and I almost never have any leftovers.

I made this not to long ago and everyone loved it, which means there wasn't any leftovers. I did add crunched up tortilla chips to the top, which was a great idea. Although, next time I make this I'm going to add Mexican rice in the mix.

Very good.  Just spicy enough for me.  It was easy to prepare and I served it with shredded lettuce, chopped onions and sour cream.

Tasty and the family ate it up. Only request from hubby was to not use the cheese dip the next time, but I don't know what I'd sub it with, unless I make my own from scratch...ugh.

Made this for supper tonight and even my picky eater husband loved it and requested leftovers for his lunch pail!  Very tasty and easy to make.  My husband isn't fond of black olives so I did as another reviewer mentioned and substituted a can of drained black beans.  I like black olives myself so I'm going to make it with those for a holiday luncheon with the girls. Thanks for the awesome recipe!

This was very good! The only thing that I did differently was use 2# of tater tots (instead of 1#) and I added onions to the ground beef before cooking. Next time I will add crushed Doritos to the top after baking. Thank you for this recipe.

Good flavors. Wish the tots were crispier.  Didn't like it with lettuce (Lettuce got hot and limp) so ate it without.

My family loved this dinner. Used  2 lb ground  turkey and added more taco sauce. They were fighting over the leftovers. Served it atop lettuce but garnished with taco chips.

I didn't see on the recipe what size pan to use so I guessed and used a square glass dish.  That worked fine.  My taco seasoning and water never did thicken up and the tater tots did not bake crisp at only 350 degrees.  I thought the nacho cheese sauce was too much and I didn't use quite a full jar.   took too long to make in my opinion.

Everyone liked it. Didn't have nacho cheese dip so I used a can of Fiesta Nacho Cheese soup instead. Also just used plain diced tomatoes instead of the green chili ones to cut down on the spicy factor for my not so spicy loving family.

I really liked this dish, yummy and great leftover. My husband wasn't as crazy about it as me since he wasn't a big fan of the tater tots. I've done it a couple times though since it's a good weeknight meal.

It's was an easy, quick recipe.  I wasn't sure what size glass dish to use, it turns out a 9" glass pie plate works well.  I couldn't find plain nacho cheese, so salsa &queso works well.  I will definitely make this again for the family.

My son is a very picky eater and he gave this 2 thumbs up!! Will definitely be making this casserole again! The only adjustment I made was using Mexican blend shredded cheese and only 8 ounces of nacho cheese sauce. I added additional Mexican blend cheese to compensate for using less nacho cheese sauce.

Tried this recipe tonight. The flavor was just hot, that's all. It needs a flavor of Mexico, such as tortilla chips, cumin or chili powder.  Might try again but, add some extra flavoring.

I made this for my husband and 5 children.
They all LOVED this recipe so it's a keeper.
To save a couple dollars I used Campbell's Nacho Cheese Soup mixed with 1/2 c. milk for a doubled recipe.  I froze the extra dish.  I also added a can of corn because it was in the pantry.
Easy, no fuss meal.

Three generations with this .  Changed tomatoes and pepper can for all taco sauce to cut down on "spicy " for grands.  Then offered spicier salsa.  The 5 YO even took the left overs to lunch the next day. !
