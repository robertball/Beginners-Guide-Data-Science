Hello All. I submitted this recipe and wanted to make a comment about the vegetables. I suggested the boiling method because the veggies will cook much faster, but in fact, I prefer to stir-fry my veggies as opposed to boiling. Please do which ever you prefer and feel free to add or take away ingredients at your leisure, this recipe is very forgiving. Also, use as much or as little garlic oil as you desire to toss your noodles in. I will sometimes add some salt and soy sauce to toss my noodles in along with the oil to add some extra flavor. If your not a cilantro lover, I recommend tossing in some extra chopped green onions. Happy Cooking.

What a nice surprise this dish is. On the surface it really doesn't look like anything too special, but it's flavorful and delicious. No one flavor overpowers the other. Tossing the noodles with the garlic oil is a must! I doubled the veggie amounts,used olive oil instead of the veg oil, omitted the cilantro and squeezed a little lime juice over the dish when it was done. Fantastic! I would also recommend using a good quality soy sauce (like Kikkoman) instead of the thick cheap salty stuff. Thank you, this is definitely a keeper.

Fabulous!  Became member just to rate this recipe.  All 3 kids had 3rds.  I doubled veggies and just threw them in with the boiling noodles during the last 30 seconds of cooking time.  This is a new family favorite.  Thanks JOSIE!

Very good.  I lightly browned the garlic in olive oil -- a little more than 1/4 Cup and then removed it from the heat.  I did use the pasta water as it was still hot to quickly cook my chopped veggies.  I used a pasta spoon to get the linguine out of the pot and then threw my chopped veggies in the water.  I served it on a large meat platter, and it was beautiful.  I topped it with freshly grated parmesean cheese.  I used the soy sauce and the lime juice but no cilantro.  Great recipe that makes a lot of food and looks great!

This dish turned out very well and I was happy with it. It had good, if subtle, flavors. I followed the recipe almost to the "T" except that I used a little less oil (and Olive instead of vegetable oil). In the future I would not heat the oil as long before I added the garlic. The problem I had is once they turned "golden brown" I removed the pan from the heat as specified - but the oil was still hot enough that the garlic continued to cook, going into the very dark brown range. Other than that, everything went very well and I would make this again.

This was a fantastic recipe however, I did not use as much oil.  I added frozen stir-fry vegetables that saved a bit of time too.  I also used the juice of a fresh lemon as I didn't have any limes and this added a fantastic fresh taste!  I would certainly make this recipe again...even the kids loved it!

This was a lot tastier than I had expected and the sauce was really nice. The lime gave it a nice kick and I enjoyed the linguine. The cabbage added something a little different to my usual stir-fry mixes so I will be trying this again, and I can see how versatile it will be depending on what vegetables I have on hand.

This was a tasty recipe. I used a bit more garlic then called for just because I love garlic. I also added celery and I had some balsamic vingar oil that I added. I would add more veggies next time too. I will be adding this to my favorite list!!!!!! Oh so good.

This was sooooo good! My husband and I loved it! I honestly thought the garlic and cilantro was going to be too much, but it all worked out perfectly. I didn't have cabbage, so I didn't add the cabbage. I also used frozen veggies along with the fresh green onions and cilantro(being 8 months pregnant, I didn't feel like standing there for an hour chopping up a bunch of veggies!!) and it came out fine. I like that you can mix up the type of pasta (I used rotini noodles) and veggies to your liking and the recipe will still be awesome! Other than the veggies, don't change anything!

I just made this for Sunday lunch for my husband and myself. It was wonderful! I'll certainly be making this again. I used broccoli, carrot, fresh mushrooms, and onion for my veggies, as I didn't have any cauliflower or cabbage. The cilantro is essential- it gives it such a delightful flavor! I highly recommend this dish.

Thank you Josie for sharing this recipe. It has to be the best recipe I have found!! It does take some time to prepare but it is worth every minute!! I used a half of 12oz box of linguine. We like more veggies and less pasta. I did add about twice as much veggies (broccoli carrots, asparagus) which I put in the boiling water for about 60 seconds. After I added these to the chicken I added my mushrooms, green onions, about 1 tsp. lime juice and 1/2 cup of cilantro. Cooked veggies until just crisp. I had so much I had to mix it in a large pop corn bowl. With 4 adults eating there was very little left. I think the garlic (which I used more) in the oil is what really makes it. THANKS AGAIN!!

This  was simple and easily adaptable to what is on hand in the kitchen.  I boiled my vegetables as stated in the recipe, however, a little longer.  Definitely would taste better saut√©ed but not as healthy!

I love this recipe and have made it several times.  I just bought some garlic olive oil and used that.  I also change the vegetables depending on what I have on hand.

Excellent!  This is probably one of my favorite pasta dishes.  It taste like a dish from a fine italian restaurant.  And it;s so easy to make! The presentation is also beautiful and would look lovely for guest! My husband had it for dinner and called it "a home run!"

Fabulous!! This was great! Even the kids liked it!! I love the fact that you can use any vegetables that your family likes. Next time, I think I will add some crushed red pepper flakes to spice if up a bit....So good! One of the better ones I have made from this website. THANKS...
*One thing to think of: I used a ton of pots/pans including a strainer for noodles, and food processor for shredding veggies.

With a little tweaking, this dish is very good.  Changes I made: 1)Omitted the cilantro, 2)Used olive oil instead of vegetable, 3)Added extra broccoli, carrots & cauliflower, 4)Instead of boiling, stir-fried the vegetables after the chicken was cooked, 5)Used angel hair pasta instead of linguine. Although the dish smelled great, the pasta was dry and didn't have enough flavor. 6)I threw in some oyster sauce & a little more soy sauce and it made a world of difference. My husband went back for thirds!

This was ok.  I think I expected a milder taste from the cilantro but it ended up being quite strong.  Maybe I added too much.

Surprisingly good! I cooked the veggies with the chicken, and ommitted the cabbage and cauliflower. I think I'd double the vegetables next time. I also used half the soy sauce (not a huge fun), and omitted the lime and cilantro completely. This will be a regular dish!

I didn't have the linguine though so I used spaghetti.  Thanks for the yummy recipe!

This was excellent.  I did double the vegetables to make it healthier and only used a 1/4 cup oil by mistake, but that was definitely enough and made it even healthier.  This is going in my favorites file.

Wow-wheeee.. Amazing!  I used whole wheat pasta and skipped the chicken.  I made a whole pound and it was gone in one sitting.  The garlic olive oil really did the trick.  And the kitchen smelled heavenly!

Very good. I make it with 3 cups of Costco's frozen stir-fry veggies and only 1/4 cup of olive oil (rather than 1/2 cup).

This recipe surprised me by how much I liked it!  I left out the cilantro and lime.  To make it easier I used a bag of frozen brocolli/cauliflower mix, and a bag of pre-shredded coleslaw mix.  I really like it!

Wow this is amazing! I made only necessary changes. I used white onion because that's what I had on hand, along with broccoli and carrots. I boiled my veggies for about 2 minutes just to fit my personal taste. But other than those minor changes, I followed the recipe. I cannot even tell you how good this is...it's a must try! And the addition of squeezed lime makes this dish even more incredible. Thanks so much I will make this very often!!

This was awesome!  Definitely in my top 10 meals to make!  My family loved it and I will be making it again for guests soon!  I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg. oil.  I only used carrots and broccoli as my veggies and also cut out the cilantro.  I added scrambled egg to my pasta and it was delicious!  Thanks for the recipe!

Love the lime touch!  Used a package garden frozen vegetables cooked in the microwave and turned out great.  I used 6 chicken tenders and half box of linguine so I could have used less oil.

Delicious, but a bit time consuming.  Next time I think I'm going to stick my veggies in the pot with the pasta.  It was delicious!  Add crushed red pepper for a little kick.  Yum.

This was very easy to make and I am so not comfortable in the kitchen. I used extra virgin olive oil instead of veg oil and I used fresh broccoli, carrot chips, sugar snap peas and mushrooms because I found a bag of these already chopped at the grocery store. I also used jarred minced garlic because I have no idea how to use raw garlic. I also did not know if I was supposed to remove the garlic pieces from the oil but I think I slightly burned them anyway, so I scooped them out. They sort of clumped up anyway so removing them wasn't hard to do. I did not add cilantro but definitely use the fresh lime. It adds such a wonderful dynamic to the soy/garlic flavor. My 10 year old couldn't get enough of this dish and asked if I would make it once a week. I did use a little more soy sauce simply because I love the flavor and I bought Kikkoman brand because it was recommended by another reviewer. Out of all of the recipes that I have made from this site, this was by far my favorite. I have been let down by other recipes but this one exceeded my expectations.

This is one of my most favorite recipes!  I love that I can use any veggies I have on hand, BUT the cilantro and lime juice are A MUST!!!!!  They just add that fresh twist!  So yummy!  This will for sure become a staple meal. I like to drain my pasta then reheat the water to boil the veggies.  Just saves time and less dishes to wash.

WOW, just WOW!  I made this per the recipe - but I did follow other comments and made the pasta, and reused the water to blanch the veggies. I can not say how great this is!  I love the fact that I can throw in whatever veggies I have on hand into this dish!  I have made it numerous times and it is great everytime. One thing, as a garlic loving family - we doubled the garlic and add a little more low sodium soy....so delicious! The other bonus with this recipe, it tastes amazing cold the next day. My daughters who are 9 and 11 love getting this in their lunch box the next day - and I have handed out the recipe to many of their teachers. I highly recommend this recipe to all of those moms who want a great healthy dinner - and healthy leftovers the next day. Plus, you can make this ahead and reheat it if you want to....great recipe!  Thanks!

LOVE THIS!!  I have made this many times, always follow the garlic recipe to a tee...even decreasing a bit if you have little eaters.  I over did the garlic once and my kid's requested it to be "normal".  I love that this recipe can be used with a variety of veggies.  I like to throw in some peas and even some bean sprouts.  YOU have to try this, it is a keeper!

YUMMY! I added more of the veggies listed in the recipe and used half olive oil and half canola oil with a little more garlic and soy sauce. I substituted boneless, skinless chicken thighs for the chicken tenders. My hubby, who usually doesn't compliment me on new recipes, liked it too. Lots of leftovers to take to the adult children.  This one is definitely a keeper.  Thank you for sharing!

Love this recipe! Our grocery store sells a fresh pre-chopped assortment of stir-fry veggies, and any time it's on sale I make this dish. If I use canned chicken it's even faster.

I had to run to the store for ingredients. I forgot to buy cabbage, so I used kale instead. The lime was sublime. I made this exactly except for the kale. Highly recommend.

This recipe is awesome. I love the fact that you can play with it so much! I added different veggies and used olive oil. It turned out great, I can not wait until I make it again!

This was good, but just a little plain. I had a pork tenderloin that I had marinated for a week that had to be cooked up stat, so I used it instead of chicken. Well it ended up being a good flavor addition from using the Best Steak Marinade in Existence, on this site. I skipped the noodles, added 1/2 bag peas and carrots in lieu of shredded carrot, used a bag of broccoli and cauliflower, and followed the rest of the recipe as is. I also used dried cilantro (a few healthy shakes, not a big fan). I think the garlic and soy sauce shine here, but for an extra punch, I added a couple tsp of black bean sauce, because I had it on hand. I realize it could've been my huge amount of veggies that took away from the flavor, but I'll adjust for that next time. Gotta have the veggies! Thanks for the recipe.

I thought this was great I sauteed an onion and a zuchini and added that to the veggies. I also didn't have fresh garlic so I used minced which worked just as well. I was afraid it was going to be garlicy or salty with 10 cloves plus the soy but it was a very mild taste I liked it alot as did my husband and asked if I would make it again before he was finished eating. I left out the lime, cilantro and the green onion as I didn't have them on hand.

This recipe was awesome. I had so much fun making it.I did leave out the lime and cilantro and added more soy sauce and seseme oil.  Try adding any of your families favorite veggies. This has become a regular meal at our house and my friends beg me to make it when I visit.

Very good!  This is a great way to get the veggies in.  My husband, who hates pasta dishes, said "it's good - tastes like something you'd get at a restaurant".  I added more than was called for with all the veggies.

Amazing! I used chicken that I already had pre-cooked from the night before and heated it up in the pan with some soy sauce. I also added onions and omitted the cauliflower. Me and my husband went back for seconds and he's having it for lunch tomorrow. This is definitely one for the recipe box!

My husband and I loved this recipe and he doesn't eat veggies!  He was able to work around them and I was more than happy to eat them all up!  It was a nice variation from the "meat and potatoes" type meals we usually resort to.

I made this with rice noodles instead of linguine.  I also added zucchini to the mix.  My husband said he could eat it all day!  Very tasty - and reheats well.

Great dish!  I used fresh veggies instead of frozen, and doubled the amount called for. Also used whole wheat linguini and olive oil.  Don't skimp on the cilantro or the garlic, as it adds tons of flavor to this simple, yet delicious dish.

I thought this recipe was very quick and easy to make. It didn't have any special ingredients that I had to run out and buy either. I don't like cauliflower so I used 1 full cup of broccoli and left out the cilantro since the hubby is not a fan. I also did not add the salt and it still had plenty of flavor. It was great! Will make it again but next time will add a bit more cabbage and green onions.

I really enjoyed this recipe.  I, like everyone else, made a few adjustments due to budget restraints and availability.  I used homemade pasta which makes it a "lighter" dish. I also used frozen veggies rather than fresh which worked great.  I also added a little corn starch to thicken the gravy a tad bit.  Overall, excellent flavor.

I LOVE this recipe!!! It is also one of my husbands favorite. I did make a few changes. I left out the cabbage, limes, and celantro and then I added 1 c. shredded parm. cheese at the end. I also added a little more chicken and veggies.

Thanks to Allrecipes, I plugged in the ingredients that I had on hand and I chose this recipe out of the 5 results that displayed.  I followed the recipe, but only used broccoli and carrots as my vegetables and penne pasta instead of linguine because it was all I had. I also only used 3 Tbsp of soy sauce instead of 3.5. The recipe was very simple and delicious.  I didn't toss the pasta in the garlic oil because of lack of another large dish or pot, so I bet it would have been even tastier if I had been able to. Thanks for a great recipe that I will make again and that my husband appreciated.

This rates as THE best healthy, family friendly recipe I have found in years.  I reduced the oil to 1/3 cup and added chilli to taste.  The whole family loved it and it is a new feature of our meal planner.  Thankyou for posting.

This was very tasty. I doubled the veges, as suggested, and I added another tsp of oil. It was too oily! Next time I'll keep the oil the same. And after I chopped the cilantro I thought it would be too much, but I ended up using all of it. Flavors blended well. Next time I'll mix the onions in raw instead of blanched with the other veges.

This is a very good recipe.  I found the ratio of linguini to vegies too low - will add 1 cup of each next time.  Also, I'm a cilantro lover but didn't think it blended with the more Italian taste of this dish. I used olive oil instead of veg. oil, and garnished with Italian parsley and lemon.  Fabulous!

This was so fantastic, I can't wait to make it again! The chicken had such good flavor, and everything together was perfection. The only change I made was to omit the cilantro (personal preferance). I was unsure about the amounts of soy sauce, but it turned out just right. YUM!

Really delicious. I did, however, make several changes. I marinated my chicken in a mixture of hoisin sauce, peanut butter, lime juice, and brown sugar. I tossed it with some leftover chimichurri sauce (cilantro, garlic, EVOO, salt and pepper) right before serving.

OMG! Just- wow! I always read through the comments before making something to see the real world applications, and I was intrigued by the ‚Äú...this recipe is very forgiving‚Äù comment. It was a perfect jumping off point for chicken, broccoli, soy sauce, and then.....  I don‚Äôt usually like to specify my exact moderations (I mean, just submit a new recipe right?) but maybe someone will be inspired by my ‚Äúwhat do we even have?‚Äù mentality.  I didn‚Äôt have cilantro; don‚Äôt care for it. I had spaghetti, not fettuccini. I had lemon pepper. I had parsley. I had baby carrots that are impossible to shred, but I managed. A can of mushrooms and a bag of onions. Way more oil, soy sauce, and garlic than needed but the flavor was AMAZING! And I put parm on it when serving. Love it- love it- love it! Thanks!

I didn't like it at all. It was dry and it made a lot of leftovers I won't be eating. My husband liked it a lot though. He likes garlic more than I do.

Great flavor!! Made it with rice instead of pasta and its like a stir fry on steroids. Love Love the garlic flavor. This is definitely going on the regular rotation for dinner

The garlic was way too overpowering and I didn't even use the total amount the recipe recommends, and I love garlic so that's saying something! I think it is going in the right direction but needs some small tweaks. Maybe half the garlic and adding some Parmesan after it's all said and done would be nice.

Flavours didn't work for us.  The line and cilantro stood out as separate flavours rather than enhancing the dish.  Other than the lime and cilantro, the dish  was extremely bland.

This was delicious!  I'm not sure what makes it so tasty but it is!  I did add a little additional soy sauce to taste. Also used gluten free, brown rice pasta. It didn't change the dish and my mother in law was able to enjoy it.  The cilantro and lime definitely adds something!

I have been craving this recipe ever since I made it! I was a little worried it would be bland or boring and was surprised how good it was! Lots of flavor! I followed some of the suggestions and added a bit more soy sauce. Delicious!

Great flavor.  I conveniently used a bag of California blend frozen vegetables which had the cauliflower, carrots and broccoli.   I omitted the cilantro and lime.

We tried this recipe last night. But I would say that at least 15 minutes have to be added to the time since I had to clean and shred the carrots along with longer boiling times at higher elevations.
We cut down the amount of garlic and the taste was better for us using half garlic. 
Also, it should be noted that a skillet of 12" would be a minimum.

This is an excellent recipe!  Easily changed to suit your taste.  I followed other reviewers' suggestion to double the vegetables and it turned out great.  I think next time I will use a little less oil and throw in some mushrooms and toasted almond slivers.

This was so good! Followed the recipe exactly, except I didn't use chicken. The only thing I would change is definitely double the veggies. I felt like there was barely any in the dish. Otherwise, two thumbs up and will be making again for sure!

Really good! We're vegan so I didn't use any chicken, and I varied the veggies to our own taste: broccoli, savoy cabbage, sliced red pepper, and grated carrots. Didn't boil, just sauteed everything! My family devoured it, and my husband has been repeatedly asking for me to make it weekly for the past month!

This really is a delicious dish.  I'm only cooking for two now so we usually have some sort of stir fry at least once a week.  It's fun to experiment with various veggies or even some good wine, which I add after I saute the chicken and reduce.  I scale down the recipe using only one large chicken breast, thinly sliced (freeze for 10 min. for easier slicing), the veggies here plus pea pods, fresh mushrooms, thinly sliced celery, and Japanese rice noodles.  We had enough for dinner and two lunches, however, my husband decided to have a second plate.  This is a great recipe to use up the remaining produce in the refrigerator before a grocery shopping trip.  Thanks for sharing, Josie.

This was easy & tasty.  I used a suggestion from other reviewer to add my veggies at the end of the cooking time for my noodles.  I used veggies I had & I didn't have the lime or cilantro.  I chose to add some oyster sauce that I had in the fridge, about 1 Tbsp. to the meat after I browned it.  I also added Sirachi (sp) to my plate but I tasted it beforehand and it was good that way as well.  I just chose to make it spicy.  Soo easy to throw together!

Oil was not enough to coat all of the pasta. Did not taste like anything. Would have done better with less pasta and a real sauce maybe mushroom sauce which would have made more hearty and tasty.

This was great!  My boyfriend doesn't like pasta and I (the cook) LOVE pasta.  He said this was the best pasta ever.  He isn't into gravy or sauces so this was perfect with the garlic oil coating the pasta.  I used fettucini because I had it on hand but you can really use any pasta and any vegetables. Very versatile recipe but the garlic oil and soy sauce make this recipe very delicious.  I can't wait to make it for my friends and family.  The leftovers were very tasty even cold.  THANKS FOR THIS RECIPE JOSIE!!!!

This has been a big hit with my family. I took the recipe and made it for my mom and step-dad. They like things to have a little kick so I added a hot pepper to the oil with the garlic and then added a second to the veggies.  The recipe is so flexible.

I was surprised at how delicious this was, with such few seasonings. It is a great way to use up any veggies you have, with or without meat. I added red pepper flake, and didn't use as much oil, but in general, it's great!

1.  I used spaghetti noodles 2.  I used only 3 TBSP olive oil 3.  I used only 2 cloves of garlic.... TEN cloves is crazy-talk! 4.  Mine was vegetarian 5.  I didn't use cilantro or lime (actually I forgot it) I think I can get away with even less oil.   After I boiled the spaghetti & removed it to the serving dish, I poured all the oil with garlic in with the noodles, then I dropped my chopped up veggies in the hot noodle water for a couple of minutes, then drained it & put the veggies in my frying pan & added the soy sauce.  You don't need to add any salt at all since soy sauce is basically its own salt. We LOVED this dish!  Next time I'm going to try it with sunomono noodles for an even healthier option, plus less oil.

I really enjoyed this recipe. Very flexible and giving. I tend to use a little less pasta so I can enjoy more veggies but that's a personal taste. I also use low-sodium soy sauce so it's not so salty. As written, very good!

I liked this a lot. I sauteed the veggies as the recipe title implies. Great flavor and so versatile. I used broccoli instead of cauliflower and 1/2 the cilantro.

This was another one of the best recipes I've tried at Allrecipes. It was easy to make and delicious. My husband thought it was great and has asked me to make it again.  I did use the low sodium soy sauce and it tasted great.

Very good.  I doubled the vegies, and I will add even more next time.  I also added 2 extra tablespoons of soy sauce, and will add more next time.  This is very good.

My boyfriend thought it was the best thing I ever made!  However, I did not think it was as impressive.  I think next time I will add more garlic and use fresh veggies, as I just used a bag of frozen veggies this time.

This was a GREAT recipe!  As the author of this recipe said that one could use whichever vegetables one wanted, I did.  I used 1 cup of broccoli, 2 cups of Napa Cabbage, and 1/2 grated carrot.  I microwaved the broccoli for 2 minutes first (in lieu of boiling it), and just added the carrot and cabbage directly to the skillet.  I followed the rest of the recipe exactly.  My husband and kids loved it.  It was very easy to do;  I will be making it again.

At first, I wasn't sure all of the veggie/seasoning combinations would work well together, but it turned out so tasty.  I did as suggested in other reviews and doubled the veggies.  Also used wheat pasta for an extra health kick.

Ditto all the raves above.  I also doubled the veggies, using Chinese cabbage, mushrooms and celery.  Also added some shrimp...fantastic dish.

I'm not sure about this dish.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either.  It was just OK.  I may try making it again, but this time I'll use a little less oil and cabbage (I think I used too much), and maybe a bit more of the other veggies, and more soy and lime.  I'll have to keep playing with it until I get it to my liking, although I'm just not sure if it's worth the effort.  My hubby and oldest son liked it.  My 15 year old did not like it at all, and I just thought it was mediocre.  Sorry!

LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!  Followed it almost exactly, but used olive oil instead of vegetable oil, and it was wonderful.  As another reviewer said and I agree, adding the garlic oil to the linguine is key.  I couldn't get enough of this, and couldn't wait to heat it up for lunch the next day.  My only suggestion is to cut veggies up pretty large otherwise they get lost in the linguine.  Great recipe!!

This recipe was easy and delicious.  I took the advice, and used vegetables that I had on hand: Bell pepper, celery, and a leek.  Also, instead of doing the garlic oil, I just minced 2 cloves of garlic and sauteed them with the chicken and veggies.  I highly recommend this dish!

The whole family enjoyed this -- even the picky 4 yr old!  Next time I will only use 1/4 cup of olive oil as I thought it was a bit oily.  I used broccoli, carrots and onions and put them in my metal steamer which I submerged in the pasta water for 45 seconds and removed before I cooked the noodles.  Then while the noodles cooked, I fried the chicken, then added the veggies, then tossed it all together in a bowl and it looked great.  This will be a regular for us!  Thanks for sharing!

YUM..YUM..YUM..  Ok this one just plain made me curious.  I followed the driections with just a little change.  I used more soy than called for.  I acutally forgot the broccoli at the end.  It did not make a difference.  This was a great dish for a quick healthy dinner.  I think I may just make this as a vegeterian dish next time and add even more cabbage.  Either way it is a definite KEEPER!!!!

I make something almost exactly like this! I use mushrooms and onion too, less garlic. You can use tofu instead of chicken, or in addition, less chicken, some tofu. Don't brown tofu with chicken. I like to add a bit of Hoisin sauce and less soy. I sometimes and no tofu or chicken and use some scrambled eggs, my wife and I ate a lot of this in Art School. We made it with Ramen noodles....student budget meal! Endlessly addaptive!

This dish was fabulous, both tasty and beautiful. Made almost exactly like recipe Everyone loved it. I have the worlds pickiest kids three of them loved it..the fourth didn't like the fact it taste like shrimp. I think thats because it looks like a shrimp dish, and the dish would taste great with shrimp next time i will add both chicken and shrimp. Thank you for our new family favorite.

This was excellent!  I used about 1/3 cup olive oil instead of vegetable oil, a small zucchini for the cauliflower, and rice noodles for the pasta.  Definitely something I will make often and it's great left over!

We were not that crazy about this.  I think my family likes more flavor because we thought this was bland, and I added extra garlic.  The chicken pieces had the most flavor with the soy sauce, but the pasta and vegetables tasted like oil.

I skipped the cabbage and bumped up the quantities of the other vegetables when making this.  The garlic oil really makes this stir-fry special.

I really loved the flavor in this recipe and followed it exacty with exception of the cabbage. We didn't have any so I left it out. My kids didn't really care for it though. My 10 year old thought the pasta had no flavor. I loved it!

I have to laugh at my end result - it was good but as I reread the recipe, I realize I did it all wrong! I didn't even notice the limes at the end which probably would've been tasty! I only had carrots, celery, onion, mushrooms and snow peas for veggies and I ended up doing it like a stir-fry. Since the soy didn't really flavor it enough, I started adding mirin, hoisin and sesame oil to up the taste. Loved the cilantro - wish I would've had some roasted peanuts to sprinkle on with the sesame seeds. So - even though I didn't follow instructions, it turned out great - the whole family liked it. Next time, I'll write it down though!

This was great, my husband loved it.  Though we have been married seven years, we met and married in Germany, we do not like the fast foods of America.  We prefer fresh vegetables and meats, well he prefers meat over me.  Thank you to my sister-in-law that has helped out with recipes and had me look at this site.
