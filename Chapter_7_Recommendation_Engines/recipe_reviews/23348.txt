I followed the directions exactly as written and ended up with a sour, flavorless pie that seperated into a layer of liquid on the bottom and a fluffy layer on the top.  It didn't set correctly for some reason (I suspect the acid from the lemon) and it had needed more sugar and flavor.  My nephew, who loves anything lemon (including the actual, unadulterated fruit) hated this pie.  I ended up throwing the entire thing out.

After reading the "it didn't work" review I decided to play it safe. I followed the recipe, but was sure to cool the gelatin/juice before adding the whipped topping. In light of the "sour" comment I added about 1/3c sugar before adding the topping. It set up wonderfully and has a nice sweet/sour balance. Nice dessert for days too hot to bake.
