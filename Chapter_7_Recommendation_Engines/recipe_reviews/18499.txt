Rather than being concerned about the calories, beware of the cost to make this dish. I went to the store to purchase just these items and my bill came to $29.11! Ouch! 

But it was completely worth it when I showed up for my friends' "Sex & the City" Potluck Night and they all raved about how great it was.

Medium was the largest size of Starkist canned shrimp that my grocery carries and they turned out to be a pretty good size. To cut down on calories, I used fat-free cream cheese which definitely helped cos the french fried onions had more than 100g of fat in the one can. Yikes. So if I could think of a way to use just 1/2 a can and mix it with something else to sprinkle on top then it would be absolutely perfect.

Oh yes, one final thing: when I make this again I'll cut up the asparagus into bite-sized pieces. The long strands of soft asparagus were just too hard to eat (and serve).

Even people who say they don't like asparagus admit that they like it when it's prepared this way!  Like other reviewers, I, too, cut the asparagus into pieces rather than leaving in stalks and used fat-free cream cheese to cut down on calories.  The canned shrimp seemed rather expensive so I purchased shrimp from the grocery's seafood/deli area, which was cheaper and doubled the amount used (to 16oz).  

It's a fabulous recipe and it's quickly becoming one that I'm known for bringing to events. Thanks Erin for posting it!

This recipe was a big hit for our Thanksgiving Dinner. It was GREAT! Everyone wanted the recipe. I too used a pound of fresh shrimp instead of the canned. I also used the already cut asparagus. This will be the dish I bring to all my family gatherings.

My grandmother asks for this recipe every time I serve it!  I use fresh asparagus and shrimp.  It makes the texture and flavor sooo much better, without jacking up the price too much.

Everyone loved it, I thought it was okay. I will do it again, but next time I definatly will cut the asparagus in half or thirds.. was a little messy to serve.

SO GOOD!  My three-year-old even ate this and he won't go near green vegetables.  We can't eat shrimp because of seafood allergies so I omitted the shrimp and added crumbled bacon.  YUM!

This was SO GOOD!!  Fed a housefull of guests on Easter and it was a huge hit.  Very rich, I didn't find it to be bland at all.  I used large frozen tailless shrimp.  Not an everyday recipe due to the cost and richness, but exquisite for special occasions.

Wasn't sure if I would like this, but, I really did enjoy it and my husband loved this. It got 4 stars because it is very rich. I did use reduced fat cream cheese and fresh shrimp and fresh asparagus. Next time I will use more shrimp. I didn't add the fried onions but I did sprinkle bread crumbs on it.

I gave it 4 stars because there's nothing healthy about this recipe. I didn't even know canned asparagus existed!! Eww! I bought fresh shrimp and asparagus. I also bought fat-free cream cheese (Weight Watchers brand) and I substituted the cheese soup for condensed shrimp soup. So yummy!

I was very hesitant about this dish - BUT - this was SO AMAZING!  I would probably use fresh asparagus next time - but canned was fine (long day!).  Served as a main dish over rice.  10 minutes is almost TOO long - the onions were starting to burn.  Yummy!!!!

I made this dish for Thanksgiving, and I had mixed reviews from family. Some absolutely loved it, and some thought it tasted like melted processed cheese slices. I thought that the asparagus was way too mushy...maybe next time I will try fresh asparagus.

This was a good recipe. It definitely needed some spice. I added pepper, seasoning salt and garlic salt. Just a little, but think it helps.

Did not change a thing! It was great as is, but I wonder how good it would be if you used fresh asparagus and fresh shrimp? A good quick side dish that I will definately make again.

As usual I modified the recipe a bit since I rarely have all of the exact ingredients.  However, I think these helped.  Used only one 8 oz pkg of cream cheese (low fat) and used about 10 oz frozen shrimp, thawed, shelled, seasoned with salt, ground pepper, and ground red pepper, tossed with 1 tsp olive oil and refrigerated for 1 hour, then sautéed in another tsp olive oil and two cloves of chopped garlic for about 5 minutes, then mixed into the cheese mixture per the recipe.  Otherwise, followed the recipe and it really turned out well.  Somewhat rich but not as much as it would have been with more cream cheese of the non-low-fat variety.

I tried this very recipe about 15 years ago.  It was the first time I'd ever eaten asparagus and I just had to have the recipe.  I've made it ever since.  Absolutely delicious...(and this is being written by someone who is NOT a fan of shrimp).  You've got to try it.

This is wonderful! I used fresh asparagus, cut in 2" pieces, steamed prior to covering with sauce.  Instead of canned, definately use larger cooked shrimp. It was a hit at my Thanksgiving dinner!

Easy, delish, everyone loved it.  I bought canned shrimp and ended up using some frozen shrimp.  Next time no tails on.  I'd like to try with fresh asparagus too.

I made this recipe for Thanksgiving Dinner this year.  It was okay, but I thought that it was a bit on the "saucy" side and that dominated over the mild taste of the asparagus.

This was a big hit for Thanksgiving! Taste was a little bland. I didn't care for the canned shrimp next time I will use the small salad shrimp and add a little garlic salt to add flavor. I will make again...............

Just ok, the taste was alright, but the cost was substantial.  Beware the price, especially when making for a large crowd.

This is a great recipe, aside from the cost. There are ways to cut down on the calories, so improvise, don't let that keep you from trying it.  Just a word of advise: be sure to mention to your guests that the recipe includes shrimp.  One of my guests turned out to be allergic, lucky for me I had mentioned it before it was eaten.  Thank you for this recipe Erin!

Oh my. I trusted all the stars, but ewww. WAY too rich, and I only used half of the cream cheese. I also used fresh asparagus and frozen shrimp, assuming that would be all the much better. Many healthier and less expensive recipes to try instead.

This was wonderful!  I made it on Thanksgiving for my family and they all raved about it.  It's certainly not great on the waist line, but it is very tastey and a great once in a while side dish.  And very easy too.

This recipe was very, very delicious.  My only problem was that I used generic french fried onions and they burnt a little leaving them in the oven for 10 minutes, but was still yummy.  Everyone raved about this casserole and begged for the recipe!

This will be our second Thanksgiving to serve this wonderful dish.  The only change that I made is to use cut asparagus rather than spears.  Makes serving and eating much easier.  This one really is a winner.

This came out great. My husband thought it was tasty too. As others suggested I steamed fresh asparagus and omitted the shrimp. Next time I make this this I am going to try it with green beans instead of asparagus.

My husband loved this recipe!  Since I can't eat shrimp, I left them out, and it still came out well.  I also used fresh asparagus, which I steamed a bit first.  This is a "keeper".

Well, we finally hit something I didn't like.  I used fresh asparagus instead, that may have not helped.  This was the first time I had steamed the veggie, it turned out stringy.  You couldn't cut it and it came out of the casserole in huge lumpy clumps.  Maybe not try this again.

THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU.  THIS WAS A DELICIOUS RECIPE AND A BIG HIT WITH MY FAMILY.  THE FIRST TIME I MADE IT WAS FOR THANKSGIVING A YEAR AGO AND EVERYBODY JUST LOVED IT.  HOWEVER MY DAUGHTER -IN- LAW IS A STRICT VEGETARIAN AND THEREFORE DID NOT EAT IT BECAUSE IT HAD SHRIMP IN IT.  EVERYBODY ELSE SAID IT WAS SO GOOD, IT WOULD BE JUST AS TASTY WITHOUT THE SHRIMP. SO THIS THANKSGIVING, I MADE IT AGAIN WITHOUT THE SHRIMP AND SURE ENOUGH IT WAS A HIT AGAIN -- UNANIMOUSLY.

THANK YOU ERIN FOR SHARIN.

I prepared this for a community Thanksgiving Potluck. Everyone was asking for the recipe! I doubled the shrimp as another reviewer suggested, but I did not cut up the asparagus. Next time I will cut it up to make serving and eating easier. Overall the dish was a delightful change of pace from normal Holiday fare. It will be a regular appearer at my house from now on.

I really didn't like this recipe.  Maybe it just wasnt my taste.  I took it for thanksgiving and good responses.  The asparagus flavor was overwhelmingly strong....maybe because it was canned?

Cut asparagus worked well, although not as elegant.  Will probably use larger cooked shrimp next time instead of canned salad shrimp.  The salad shrimp got a little hard during cooking.

Made this for Thanksgiving without the shrimp.  It was a big hit!  Everyone loved it! My brother-in-law's father (pickiest eater ever) even said he enjoyed the dish.  I will definately make it again.

This was great! It's definitely a rich dish. I used 3 cans cut asparagus and only one can of salad shrimp. I didn't have any French fried onions so I used crushed potato chips. YUM! Thanks for a new Easter fav!

Passable.  Way too much cream cheese/soup for the amount of asparagus.  Bland at best.  Needed some "zing" to it.  Might do again with half the amount of cream cheese and spice it up a lot.  Not going to be a favorite.

Ok, I love asparagus, and I love cheese, and I love the onion topping...but mixed together, this recipe was very bland and I  just did not care for the taste...However, everyone at the party that I served this dish at said that they loved it. So take that as you may, but I would not recommend you take this to a party without trying it at home first. That's all I have to say about it, oh and all of it was eaten at the party too...

The recipe turned out great!  I added an extra can of asparagus and used fresh cooked shrimp instead of canned.  I did follow the advise of other "recipe raters" and cut the asparagus in half.  I shared the dish with my family for Thanksgiving 2003 and it was a hit.

OK. Too rich for a single meal. If using as a side dish, use half the ingredients unless taking this to a dinner party.

I rarely adjust recipes without trying the original version but I only eat fresh asparagus and shrimp.  I cut up the asparagus into bite size pieces and steamed. Next time I will just add to the cream cheese mixture raw as I like a little crunch to my veggies.  I pan seared the shrimp in olive oil and fresh garlic, and would do again as the shrimp were wonderful. Next time I plan to cut the cream cheese/cheese soup mixture in half, it was a bit rich for us. I baked the dish for 30 minutes covered and 7 minutes uncovered.  This was the perfect amount of time for my oven.  I plan to make again with my adjustments above.  Thanks for the recipe, love easy to make meals and this is definitely a change from the norm for my family.

This is pretty good. The only thing I did not care for was how messy it is to serve.  But my kid didn't even notice the shrimp- he's not a seafood kinda guy.

I made this for thanksgiving and everyone loved it!  I used 1 lb of fresh shrimp and 2 bags of steamed asparagus which I cut into pieces.  I will definitely be making this again!

Well I must say that I really enjoy making this dish!!! It was my first time ever making a asparagus casserole,I use fresh asparagus, large shrimps, and I add 1/2 cup of milk to the cream cheese and cheese soup to loosen it up a little,I also use ritz crackers,fresh green beens!! My husband love it and my picky 6 year old ate 2 plates, I will make this dish again.
