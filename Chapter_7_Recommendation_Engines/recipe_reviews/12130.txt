I needed a quick dessert for an impromptu dinner and decided to try this recipe.  It was absolutely delicious and a big hit.  I did make a few minor adjustments based on feedback from a friend of mine who made it.  I cheated and used a Keebler chocolate crumb crust (something I rarely do but was pressed for time).  I decreased the sugar to 3/4 c and increased the whipping cream to 1.5 c to make it a little fluffier.  I also popped it in the freezer for a few hours before serving.  Wow!!!  I'll certainly be making this again and again and again....well, you get the picture! :-)

Awesome pie!  I did it a little differently though.  I used a deep dish pie crust, baked it, let it cool, then applied melted chocolate chips to the crust.  I put the crust in the refrigerator so the chocolate would solidify.  Then added the peanut butter pie filling.  

It was a huge hit with everyone.  Thank you for sharing this one. :)

I just won 1st place (and $50!) at the company's pie baking contest with this recipe.  The only alteration I made was to double the cookie crust (that's the best part in my opinion).  And I decorated the top with reeses peanutbutter cups.  Yee haw!  Thanks for the recipe!

Half an hour after he was done eating it, Hubs was still talking about how “D” good this pie was.  There are a lot of similar peanut butter pie recipes, but the differences in this one pay off in a big way – a homemade rather than purchased cookie crust and real, fresh whipped cream rather than “frozen whipped topping.”  All are easy to make but the couple of extra steps it takes to use these higher quality ingredients are worth it.  This is a dessert for serious dessert and/or peanut butter lovers.  Thick and rich (but not overly sweet), a little goes a long way.  Yet no sooner do you finish it and you’re already thinking about your next piece!  A garnish is pretty – chopped peanuts perhaps, mini chocolate chips, crushed cookie crumbs or, as I did, a drizzle of chocolate syrup and some chopped peanut butter cups. Be careful not to overdo it, however!  The pie is so rich that any more than a sprinkle to dress each slice up would be serious overkill!  Because you’ll cut the slices small, one pie will serve quite a few people! Hubs and I only have two more days in Naples to eat this before we head back home, but I know my plan to have the remaining pie waiting for us in the freezer when we return in a couple of weeks will work out very nicely. Note: For those familiar with the famous peanut butter pie from the Old Ebbitt Grill in Washington D.C. - Hubs said this is "unequivocally better."

Wow...wow. This was so incredible! It was so tasty and just like light, rich silk on the tongue. This is the PERFECT peanut butter pie. I followed directions except for using half brown sugar and a tad more vanilla. I whipped the cream in my stand mixer, put it onto a different bowl,  the heck out of the cream cheese/butter/sugar/PB mixture until it was incredibly light and fluffy, then folded in the whipped cream. It was SO light. 

I can think of all kinds of things to do with this. Adding some melted chocolate or white chocolate chips and folding them in, or a tablespoon of chocolate syrup. Or better yet, swirling in some chocolate syrup with a butter knife to create pretty patterns. Adding a tablespoon of chocolate liqeur, chopping up some peanuts and adding them to the crust, using crushed peanut butter cookie crumbs along with the chocolate ones (or doing a layer of each) ... and so on. 

This is going into my "favourites" recipe box for sure.

This pie was excellent!! I used a premade graham cracker crust also. I made it the day before and used a tub of cool whip instead of heavy cream, I also added a bag of semi-sweet chocolate chips and crumbled reeses peanut butter cups to top, I left in freezer over night and then took out and put in fridge until serving that afternoon. It was creamy and decadent. I will be making this one again!

I found that the instructions were not well written.  Being an experienced baker, I should have seen this before I started mixing - but it was late and I wasn't really thinking clearly.  Instead, I ended up with a greasy mess.  You can't just throw the filling ingredients in a bowl at once and expect it to come out right.  First of all, the butter is completely unnecessary. The cream cheese & sugar should be beaten together first, then the peanut butter gradually incorporated.  Even at that, I think this would turn out better using at least baker's sugar - which is a much finer grain - if not confectioners sugar.    That is exactly what I ended up doing after trashing the first attempt and starting over.  It came out very smooth and creamy. For poorly written directions, I can give it only three stars instead of the 4 or 5 that it might otherwise deserve.

HEAVENLY......thank you so much for sharing this with me.  I made minor changes.  Store bought crust and instead of heavy cream, I used cool whip. I put this is the fridge and not the freezer and topped with crushed Reese's peanut butter cups. This was so creamy and so rich.  A small slice goes a long way, but this was so easy and presented beautifully!

OH MY GOSH! What a pie.  This pie will make a puppy pull a train it's that good.  I used an Oreo pie crust and put a layer of milk chocolate on the bottom of the crust then put the filling on top of that.  I topped with chocolate syrup in lattice pattern.  I make 2 pies for a church dinner and got rave reviews.

I can't figure out why some reviews don't show 5 stars! I would give this 10 if I could. EASY, not too rich (we substituted cool whip topping) with a fresh peanut butter taste. Delicious! We like to freeze & just thaw for 15 minutes and serve with a drizzle of caramel, chocolate syrup and whipped cream (or Cool Whip)on top. My favorite dessert! Note: I had a piece of this leftover from yesterday, but it was thawed. I thought it was too sweet and didn't really love it. So... in my opinion this should be eaten as a FROZEN PIE and topped with chocolate syrup to really enjoy.

this was terrific! my boyfriend loves peanut butter cup sundaes, so i figured this pie would be perfect for him, and i was right! i melted some white chocolate and put a layer of it on the bottom of the chocolate crust (which i cheated and bought an oreo pre-made crust).  I also put a border or crushed oreos around the edge and marbled chocolate syrup along the top.  it looked great, smelled great, and tasted great! 5 stars!

I have been making a pie like this for about ten years...almost identical to this recipe.  It is very, very rich but it is one of the best pies that I have tasted.  Tastes even better after a day or two in the fridge.   I am not a peanut butter fiend...I imagine that my rating would be off the chart if I was.  Sinful!

I made mini versions of these for a potluck and they disappeared in minutes.  I made a double recipe of the cookie crust and pressed it into non-stick mini muffin tins, then baked at 350 for 7 min (made about 35). My mini crusts popped right out after cooling for a few minutes.  I then made 1 1/2 times the recipe of filling and used a piping tip in a ziploc bag to pipe filling into each shell.  I finished by sprinkling each mini pie with mini chocolate chips.   I ended up with a LOT of filling left over and no energy to make more crust, so I took a few leftover chocolate wafers and set them in regular size muffin tins, filled with remaining topping and stuck in the freezer - those turned out fabulous, too and we are still eating them. I like a really dense and peanut-buttery pie, so when I make these again, I'll try using 2/3rds to 1/2 the amount of whipped cream and maybe a little less sugar.  So yummy and so simple!  Thanks Stephanie!

I put Reese's peanut butter cups in the pie and over the top. I took 2 to a thanksgiving dinner and I have the host and his daughter fight about who was going to eat the last slice. This recipe is so quick and easy and yet sooo good

This is wonderfully good! I have tried the kind with Cool Whip before and hated those, the heavy cream in this sets it apart from the nasty Cool Whip ones. I did use less sugar in the filling because I tend to like things a touch less sweet -- I used 3/4 cup white sugar instead of a full cup. Thanks for the recipe, I had several requests from guests!

This pie is amazing. I've made it at least 10 times now with great results each time. Our guests rave about this pie! You can use reduced fat cream cheese, but the pie will set up a bit softer than if you use regular cream cheese. I like to make it using 3/4 cup sugar (my husband and I can't taste the difference). Thank you for the recipe!

This is a wonderful peanut butter pie recipe. I added just a splash of milk to the peanut butter mixture, since it was very thick and might have been too much for my hand mixer to handle. I also used a store-bought crust, since I was pressed for time, but I'm anxious to try it with the homemade crust.  It had a creamy texture (frozen or just chilled) and a robust peanut butter flavor (I used all natural unsweetened peanut butter). This one's a keeper!

I LOVE this pie!!!  The filling is light, fluffy and doesn't run.  I made it at my restaurant and it's now one of the most loved pies.  I loved that it was quick and easy and will be making it again.

This is the first time I have ever made peanut butter pie.  I made two, one for a friend and one for us.  I chose this recipe because it uses real whipping cream, had good reviews, and seemed like a 'quickie'.   I just tried a slice - it is dangerously good.  ;)  I put cut up Reeses PB Cups on top of the pie I am gifting.  All in all, excellent recipe with amazing results, easy to make, presents beautifully.  Thank you for the recipe.

I made two of these pies: one for my parents and one for my boyfriend's parents for Easter.  The reception I got was pretty positive. My mom compared it to eating a peanut butter cup, which is  a popular response I guess! I love the texture, the taste... everything about the pie. Because of how rich it is though, I would suggest doing as others did and increase the amount of cool whip used.  I meant to but forgot.  
As for other changes to the recipe, I used a chocolate cookie pie crust (from natural foods department), natural peanut butter (sugar free), and neufchatel cheese in place of cream cheese (makes a great, lower in fat substitute!).  I sprinked crushed Newman's organic peanut butter cups over the top of the pie.  Yum! My peanut butter had no sweetener (used Smuckers Natural) so reducing the sugar wasn't really necessary. Also, I left out the unsalted butter that was called for.  
I will definitely make this pie again.  It's great for all those peanut butter lovers out there!

I have made this pie, exactly according to the directions, 3 times now and it is now my family's favorite dessert! My husband asks for it all the time. It is the perfect mixture of chocolate and peanut butter. My advice to everyone is to take the time to make the Oreo crust from scratch, and top the pie off with crushed Reese's cups. Be sure to let your crust cool before putting the filling on it. Heaven in a pie plate! If you like peanut butter, you won't be disappointed! Oh, and I freeze it before serving the first time, allowing about 30 minutes to thaw. So good!

Saturated fat heaven! ;) This is a very good peanut butter pie. I used a crust made with peanut butter Oreos. I would say as-is, this pie definitely needs a garnish to liven things up...piped whipped cream stars along the edge of the crust and generous milk chocolate drizzles would fit the bill nicely.

The family loves this desert. I found it simple and fast to prepare, especially using the pre-made crust. The suggestion, however, to melt chocolate chips and line the crust did not turn out so well because the crust was very difficult to cut. I also added about 1/4 c. white chocolate chips to the batter.That made for a nice surprise. yummy

This was definitely not the best peanut butter pie. After chewing it a few times it just tasted like a spoonful of peanut butter with a bunch of sugar on top. My husband is obsessed with peanut butter and even he didn't like it.

Oh man this was good... it should be called "Peanut Butter Cheesecake"- that's what it tasted like to me but I still loved it!  I did cheat and use a premade chocolate cookie crust.  I used Reduced Fat Peanut Butter, Fat-Free cream cheese, splenda, and 1 tub of French Vanilla Cool Whip instead of heavy cream and it all came out fabulous!

This is the best Peanut Butter Pie ever.  I've tried many trying to find the "best" and this is it.  Easy to make.   I took a sample pie to a local upscale restaurant.  The owner and chef loved it and they are now selling the pie slices for $5 each.

The crust definitely needs to be doubled, or plus a half may be enough.  I followed others' advice and added an extra 1/2 c of whipping cream & a touch more vanilla.  This is very rich and tasty.  Needs to go in freezer a couple hours before serving.

Sinful! Rich, sufficiently dense, creamy, relatively easy to make. Next time I'll forego the pie pan and serve the filling in parfait glasses with alternating layers of crushed chocolate graham crackers!

Great peanut-butter pie. I whipped the whipping cream first, set it aside, then used the same beaters to whip the cream cheese with sugar, then added the peanut butter a few tablespoons at a time. Then I folded in the whipped cream. I am not a huge fan of Oreo cookie crusts, preferring a graham cracker crust or a combination of graham crackers and crushed peanut butter cookies. I garnish each slice with a dollop of sweetened whipped cream and one Hershey kiss or Reese's peanut butter cup.

The 4 is more for the directions than the recipe.  Especially when using white sugar, you have to cream the cream cheese and sugar (don't know why it needs the butter).  Let that turn into fluffy goodness, then add the peanut butter and vanilla.  No doubt homemade whipped cream is better, but Cool Whip works great on this one.  An 8oz tub will make it smooth, but about 3/4 of a 16oz tub makes this a cloud of greatness.  Because Cool Whip is alread sweet, I reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup and it was plenty sweet.  For me, I didn't want to conflict with the peanut butter, so I used a store bought 2 extra slice graham cracker crust.  Fit perfect.  Also, this pie is plenty sweet all by itself.  I can't imagine adding a bunch of peanut butter cups or caramel to the top.  Some homemade whipped cream on top just adds to the greatness.  Easy recipe to work with, and it's wonderful.

Loved this, I used natural peanut butter so it didn't end up being too sweet in my opinion. If you use one of those peanut butters with added sugar you may want to cut back the sugar in the crust and or/filling to your preference.

This is a good recipe but way to rich for my taste. I will make it again but put half as much peanut butter. cut sugar back to 3/4 of a cup and put more whipped cream as suggested in other reviews. I used graham cracker crust and topped it with crushed butterfinger which turned out really good on it.

This recipe makes a pretty darn good pie!  I wasn't crazy about the oreo cookie crust that I used.  I was so glad this didn't have that fake junk, cool whip, in it!  But I was a little sad after I whipped the cream, even added powder sugar to get the cream to hold better/longer.  Didn't firm as much as I would have liked... but very tasty!

My husband said this was the best dessert that I have ever made. Turned out really good, and was easy to make. My only suggestion would be less time for baking the crust- it was a little hard when I baked it for 10 minutes.

Yummy!! There is an old restaurant a few miles up the road that makes the BEST Peanut butter Mousse Pie - and this is the closest recipe to it I have yet to find!! I had another that was similar, but a lot more work.  Save yourself some time - used store bought Oreo Crust, fold cool-whip into peanut butter mix, then put a layer of hot fudge on the bottom prior to added mixture.  Crushed oreos for the topping and it was sooo good.  BEWARE this is a very rich dessert, but oh so worth it! Thanks for sharing!!

I've been making this recipe for years! It's my favorite peanut butter pie recipe and I always have requests for this. I buy a pre-made oreo crust to save time.  I also garnish the pie with freshly grated chocolate and small slices of peanut butter cups. I recently discovered how to make this as bite sizes since it's so rich (less guilt).  For mini's, I sprinkle ground up oreo's into the bottom of a mini muffin pan liners (placed on a cookie sheet), I then put the filling into a pastry bag or plastic bag with a whole cut out and I fill each cup with the filling, garnish and chill. The filling will stick to the crust when you take it out. Keep it refrigerated until it's ready to be served. If you have larger mini muffin liners you could use one side of an oreo with the frosting scraped off and it would hold together even better.

Very good and super easy!  I didn't include the butter in the filling and to be honest, it didn't make much difference.  I added an additional 1/4 cup of whipping cream to increase the fluffiness of the filling.  I will put in the freezer next time, as I thought it was too soft.

So good that we made and ate two pies in two days.  I added melted chocolate chips to the bottom of the pie as other reviewers suggested, but despite the extra sugar rush, it only made it difficult to cut the pie in even slices so I won't do that next time. I did however drizzle chocolate syrup on top for visual appeal and will continue to do so - very pretty. Two thumbs up!

To cut fat, I used fat free cream cheese and 
 whipped topping. Since my husband is diabetic
 I sweetened with artificial sweetner in the     
 filling. To serve, top with sliced bananas with
 a drizzle of chocolate syrup. It was satisfying
 and guilt free.  I'll make it again.  Thanks

Ooouch. If you love PB and don't have lots of time to waste on baking a pie, this one is the pie you need. One of my favorite, even though the filling tends to be too sweet (I think I'm gonna decrease sugar to 3/4 cup).

OMG. Made this for Easter dinner at a friend's house and it was amazing! Old and young alike loved it. No one had issue with the richness or texture. It was smooth and just rich enough without the feeling you needed to wash it down with something to dilute it. I followed the direction to the tee in terms of the filling but cheated and used prepared crust due to time issues as I was making two other desserts. Highly recommend!!

So easy and so good. All I needed to buy for this was the chocolate cookie crust. Like other people, I used cool whip instead of whipped cream. I just wanted to save time and have one less bowl to clean. I liked the suggested of melting chocolate in the bottom of the crust before putting in the filling. Will try that next time!

Quick, easy and delicious! Very rich! I would recommend leaving in the refrigerator over night before serving. I let it chill 3 hours and when I cut into it, it oozed out and didn't keep it's shape. It was much better (and firmer) the next day).

I made three different pies for a holiday gathering; this peanut butter pie was the star of the show. It was so creamy and decadent, that no one could stop raving about it. The pie was so easy to make, and I love that it doesn't require any oven time. As per the recommendations of another rater, I increased the whipping cream to 1 1/2 cups so the pie would come out creamier. Seriously, this pie is irresistible.

Wow wow wow! I'm in England and used regular choc chip cookies. The filling was so good that after I made it I sat and scrapped the bowl round for the scraps like a little kid! I do like peanut butter but sometimes find it a bit too much, however this is so light and silky it was just perfection - a new favourite!

I've been making this pie for years now, and every time it comes out delicious!  It always gets great reviews from anyone who eats it.  I follow the recipe, except usually just end up buying a pre-made chocolate or oreo cookie crust.  Sometimes, I like to make a chocolate ganache topping to go on top as well, but it is really a great pie just by itself.  I definitely suggest letting it chill for a few hours, or overnight before serving it so it hardens up a bit!  If you like peanut butter, you will love this :)

This pie turned out phenomenal. I actually made this with nutella and natural peanut butter. I did a layer of each and used a graham crust.
I also cut the sugar in half, which worked out fine. I had so much left over I made several little pies also. Would say that it is very rich and decadent. Would reccommend cutting very small pieces it is that rich and filling. Last thing I garnished with fine chocolate shavings.

Oh my goodness!!  This is heavenly.  I bought a Keebler chocolate crust just because I like to make everything easier.  The pie is like a cheesecake.  It is so good!  I definitely will be making this for many years to come.  Thanks for a great recipe!!

I have made this at least five times.  My family loves it.  It is good with a store bought Graham cracker crust if you're in a hurry.  I also like to add chopped Reeces peanut butter cups  for a topping.  I've also doubled it and made it in a 9 by 11 cake pan and it turned out grat.

This was a favorite recipe until we started trying to eat healthier, but I did a remake. I replaced the sugar with 1/2 cup of agave and 1/4 raw sugar. I used natural organic peanut butter and skipped the butter (never did use that, don't know what the point of it was) , and I used Luckywhip and mixed it with almond milk. It didn't get very stiff, but that didn't matter with this recipe. I still used the Oreo cookie pre-made crust. I really didn't notice the changes in eating it. It was still delicious!

My first pie at age 72, so I think that means I can use a 'store boughtened' crust.  This was quick, easy and very tasty. Thanks Stephanie.

Used a prepared graham cracker crust and put some Hershey's chocolate syrup in the bottom then made the pie as directed. I did use a small container of Cool Whip instead of whipping cream just because I was in a hurry. Still came out great.

Delicious! I loved the texture and the cream cheese flavor was incredible with the PB and chocolate. Reduced sugar to 3/4 cup and increased whipping cream to 1 1/2 cups. This fits well in my 9.5 inch pie pan.

I tried this recipe for the first time today. I was afraid it would be too heavy, so I only added 6 oz of cream cheese instead of 8 oz, and I also added added a couple of whipped egg whites. I also added some gelatin to stabilize it.  I made my own chocolate graham cracker crust and drizzled some melted semi-sweet chocolate over the top when it was fully chilled.  The result was spectacular and everyone loved it. This one is going into my recipe book!

This is truly  a great recipe. I used an old fashion pie crust for my base.. and if you don't want it to taste too sweet I used confectioners sugar instead of white sugar. My mom has been making this in the restaurant for 10+ yrs and it's a number 1 seller.

This was pretty good, but it was not a recipe that people went crazy about at the party.

This was so delicious and so easy to make! I used sugar substitute (the kind for baking) and fat free cream cheese to cut some calories, and it was still so great! Highly recommend.

Delish...I have only licked the batter off the spoon and can't wait to take it out of the fridge.  I too > used a store bought crust, and cool whip instead of whip cream...my husband loves chocolate pudding cake with peanut butter frosting, I'm hoping this will get to be a MEGA quick substitute!  The white sugar made it a little grainy on the spoon, waiting to see the consistency after it sits a bit!  THANKS!!

This is the go-to recipe for Peanut Butter Pie.  My family loves it.  I used 'walmart' twist and shout chocolate cookies and omit the 1/4 sugar because the cream filling was already sweet.

This is by far the winner of the pies I made for Thanksgiving dinner!  It truly, truly was!  While at the store, my guy called to ask what kind of peanut butter I wanted since we usually buy honey roasted.  On a whim, I told him to pick that up instead of regular peanut butter.  Since I used peanut butter with a bit of honey in it, I cut back on the sugar by 1/4 c - 1/2 c.  So I had to taste it to make sure that it was sweet enough.  Oh my!  It was all I could do to keep myself from plopping down in the middle of the kitchen and just eat the whole bowl!  I did use a store bought graham cracker crust though.  Everyone raved about it at dinner.  It's very, very rich so just a sliver is enough to satiate.  If you like peanut butter and sweet things, this is absolutely a must to make.  Prep was fairly simple, too.  No baking involved which is always welcome.

This has been my standard peanut butter pie recipe for about 15 years. It is the most decadent one I know of. Sometimes I cheat and use an already made Oreo crust and sprinkle mini chocolate chips on top before chilling. It is always requested by my niece at Christmas. Now if I can't find my copy of this recipe I know where I can get it. Thanks!

A quick, easy and tasty pie to make when you need to impress or just feel like some comfort food. The person I made this for isn't a huge fan of peanut butter, so I was a little worried that it was going to be slightly overpowering in taste. I needn't have worried however, the peanut butter flavour was mild enough for novices, but being a true peanut butter lover I found it just right as well. Give it a go!

Five stars for ease of the recipe and a tasty, pretty pie.  Even my mom, who doesn't like cream cheese, enjoyed it.  I used a store bought chocolate graham cracker crust, coated the bottom with a layer of melted white chocolate and refrigerated to harden while preparing the filling.  For the filling, I cut the sugar to 1/2 cup and used lite Cool Whip instead of cream, and I increased the Cool Whip to 1 and 1/2 cups.  (These changes were based on previous reviews.) To garnish, I made a criss-cross pattern with chocolate syrup, and I made a border out of crushed Reese's miniatures.  The pie stayed in the fridge overnight, and I popped it in the freezer a few hours before taking it to a party. Excellent recipe... thanks!

This is an excellent recipe. I only have one small complaint: It is rich. I found myself wishing it was just a little lighter and fluffier. If you serve it with coffee and haven't had sweets in a while, it would be perfect. Just a tad heavy and rich. Maybe 1/4 the peanut butter and add more whipped cream to the mix to fix.

very good! I used a choc graham crust, but oreo would be better, I think. Pretty quick - put in freezer for just over an hour. Grated some unsweetened choc on top to make it look nice.

I love this pie!  I made it bite size for a party by using the 100 calorie snack oreos in a mini muffin paper liner then I piped the filling on using a cake decorator.  I topped it with a sprinkle of very fine oreo crumbs.  It's best when made the night before.

This recipe is the best.  Put chocolate shavings on top and served it with a spoon full of fresh whipped cream on top.  There wasn't a crumb left.  Will be making this often.

To save time I also bought an oreo cookie crust.  I whipped the heavy whipping cream first with my KitchenAid and then in another bowl mixed the other ingredients.  Folded in the heavy whipping cream and garnished with chopped pb cups.  Very tasty refrigerated or frozen.

For the crust, I had a chocolate graham cracker, 4 Tbsp sugar and 1/4 cup butter. Rest of it is same as recipe. I had pieces of Reese's on top of pie. It is a best Peanut butter pie ever!

This recipe is DELICIOUS!  I make it exactly as specified. I usually chop  up some peanut butter cups for the top. I've had a ton of great comments on this. I'm not a big peanut butter pie fan but this one I do love!

GREAT! The only thing I changed was to use powdered sugar instead of white sugar. This is the same recipe (with the powdered sugar) that we used in our family restaurant and everyone loved it. My husband even took it to work with him to share with the guys.

Made this for my peanut-butter-addicted fiance, and I wish I had come across this recipe a long time ago!  It was so simple, and looked and tasted really impressive.  I used chocolate-filled Oreo's for the crust, and since the Oreo filling was more than sweet enough, I omitted the 1/4 c. sugar.  Out of sheer laziness, I used a container of whipped topping instead of whipping heavy cream myself.  Heavenly!

This is a great receipe....easy and relatively quick (if you buy a premade Oreo crust...but I made my own by doubling the suggested amounts as suggested by other reviewers). Everyone thought it was great, even people who are not big fans of peanut butter! Will make again! Thanks for sharing!

I brought this in for a coworker's birthday because he is a peanut butter freak.  I have never had PB pie, let alone made it, but I doubled the recipe and made 2 of them to bring in.  Let me tell you, I have had comments like "to die for", "awesome", "excellent", etc., and I have not even tried it myself yet!  I did cheat and used Oreo pie crusts and Cool Whip instead of the whipping cream (8 oz container for 2 pies).  I also cut back on the sugar.  But I will definitely be making this again!  I think there is a mistake in the recipe comment where it refers to "eggs"--there are no eggs in this recipe.

This is really good.  If you don't want it overly sweet make sure to use unsweetened peanut butter and don't add sugar to the heavy cream.  I wanted to make this cheesecake style so I used a 10 inch cheesecake pan.  At first I was disappointed because it came out really thin but even after cutting it into 16 pieces, everyone's serving was just right.  (This is a rich dessert.)  Shaved dark chocolate on top was the perfect garnish.  Thanks for the excellent recipe, I'll be making it again soon!

YUM! This recipe is SO easy and fast (especially if you use a ready-made crust)and everybody loves it. I added 50% more whipped cream the second time I made it, which made it lighter and fluffier, and slightly less sweet. Perfect!

I made this for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I saved myself some time and bought a already made crust. I also put the cream cheese in the microwave to soften it up a little… This one is a keeper!

other reviewer : I just won 1st place (and $50!) at the company's pie baking contest with this recipe. The only alteration I made was to double the cookie crust (that's the best part in my opinion). And I decorated the top with reeses peanutbutter cups.

This is a wonderful pie. I made it for my sister's b-day. To lighten up a bit, i didn't use butter and replaced the whipping cream with light cool whip. I mixed pb cups in the pie and decorated the top with them as well.

Tasty but SUPER RICH... would be good if you could lighten the filling a bit, maybe by whipping??

This peanut butter pie recipe was out of this world! We have had the real thing at Poogans Porch Restaurant in Charleston, SC and this recipe tastes authentic. We could not have enough... What a treat!

This is a wonderful, easy recipe.  I served this to a group of friends who all said it tasted like a giant peanut butter cup.  It's recipes like this that help keep my waistline expanding and my reputation of being a good cook intact!

I used the less sugar that people sugested, as well as the pre-made orea crust. Also, drizled UBET syrup on top, and decorated with chocolate leaves. It was a huge hit- none left, and got RAVE reviews, Thanks for the GREAT and SIMPLE recipe!!

Wonderful! I used a pre-made chocolate crust and garnished the finished product with a layer of chopped Reese's peanut butter cups drizzled in hot fudge. So divine.

So simple - and delicious, and convenient as most of the ingredients are kept in your cupboard.  To serve for guests, definitely spruce it up with some sort of topping/garnish.

Excellent. Going to replace my current peanut butter pie with this one. Sets up solid. Only change made was substitute 8 ounce container of cool whip for heavy cream.

Made this with a Gluten Free crust ( chocolate cream filled cookies ground with butter and sugar as the recipe directs)
Used my Pampered Chef Whip Cream Maker to whip the heavy whipping cream since I had already used my Kitchen Aid to beat the peanut butter and cream cheese. This was the best plan! Worked great! turned out amazing! Had to adjust the baking of the crust a bit though

I would give this recipe 10 stars if I could. I  made the recipe exactly as written then, I placed a dark chocolate candy bar in my food processor and sprinkled the crumbles on top for a garnish. This recipe is definitely a keeper.

Delicious. I tried to replicate the Perkins Peanut butter pie I love so much... so I used vanilla cookies for the crumb crust, baked as directed and cooled; then I put a thin layer of fudge sauce on the crust before adding the prepared peanut butter pie filling. Garnished with the extra whipped cream I’d made, topped each slice with a mini-Reece’s Cup .... and it was Peanut Heaven on a plate.

I made this and used a pretzel crust. I reduced the sugar as many suggested and am glad I did. I may even reduce it a bit more next time. I did slightly less than 3/4 cup instead of 1 cup. I definitely liked it better after freezing and that did make cutting more precise. It took longer than the 15-30 mins someone said it would to be able to cut it though. I'd say more like an hour, I suppose that depends on one's freezer.

5 stars with the changes I made! The crust does not need any added sugar at all. The cookie crumbs are sweet enough. On the pie filling, omit butter and use powdered sugar instead of granulated. I had some peanut butter chips and melted about 1/2 cup mixed wit some heavy whipping cream to make a ganache. I spread a layer of that in the bottom of the crust before adding the filling. I also made some homemade chocolate sauce to garnish. No wonder I didn't need added sugar in the crust with all of that. Also topped with fresh whipped cream and chopped peanuts. Yep ***** 5 STARS!!

It was okay. I put a couple chocolate chips on top to make it look prettier. I think it may need more chocolate. It was not too peanut buttery.

This was just slightly sweet for my liking. If I made it again I would try cutting the sugar in half. Also, you really need to cream the sugar, butter, cream cheese and vanilla together before adding the peanut butter because it's super thick and might give your beaters a workout.

Everyone loved this pie and asked for the recipe. I used a store bought  chocolate  cookie crust instead of the one included in the recipe. It made it a little quicker to make, but was still just as delicious. I will make this pie again. Very smooth and not too sweet.

I used the crust recipe I have for ice cream pie, which is 24 cookies, crushed & 1/4 c unsalted butter - cook for 15 minutes @ 350.  I also followed another reviewers advice to reduce sugar and increase heavy cream to make the filling fluffier.  The pie turned out VERY good and I received multiple compliments on it from co-workers; however, my personal opinion is the pie tasted a bit too buttery. even though there's only 1 Tbsp of butter.  Not sure what would cause this, but due to amazing taste anyway - I gave the pie 4 stars.

I made a few tweaks that I think improved the recipe and served this up for Pi Day. People were raving about it! First, I used confectioners (powdered) sugar to keep the filling smooth.  I didn’t feel like the peanut butter taste was very strong, so I added about 1/2 cup more (at least!). I left the added sugar out of the crust (which I doubled because I love me some Oreo crust); it was fine but I might try with it next time to see if there’s a discernible difference. I finished it off with a drizzle of fudge sauce, crushed Oreos and swirls of whipped cream. I’d make it again.

A nice dessert that is easy to make. I must confess that instead of whipping my cream I used Cool Whip

I made this pie for my 90 year old dad who loves peanut butter but now has problems swallowing. I didn't make any changes and it was fantastic! Oh, and yes, my dad loves it!

I would make this again with minor adjustments. For the crust it would be better with less butter, I also added Reeses pieces to the filling and Reeses mini cups to the top. I would definitely make this again!

I reduced the sugar to 1/2 cup and used icing sugar instead of granulated as I find for no bake desserts it creams/dissolves better. Purchased an Oreo crust. Used light cream cheese. Omitted the 1 tbsp butter, it was not needed. Topped with mini pb cups and crushed salted peanuts. Garnished with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. My son was very, very happy with this pie, it was delicious.

This is a great recipe without fake ingredients (like frozen whipped topping).  Yes, it is fattening.  Yes, it is rich.   And yes, that means your slice can be smaller!  I've made this about 5 times now.  This recipe is not overly sweet and I have cut the sugar down to 3/4 cup without noticing a difference.  I also sometimes cheat and purchase a pre-made oreo crust, which makes for a really quick recipe.  Topping the pie with 3 or 4 chopped mini-dark chocolate peanut butter cups (from TJ's) and a cross-hatched drizzle of chocolate syrup tops it off nicely.  Thanks for a keeper recipe!

This was incredible. Highly recommended. I used a different crust recipe using graham crackers, and I also added a chocolate ganache drizzled on top. It was gone so quickly!

First time making this and it was a winner.  The only change I made was that I used crushed chocolate graham crackers for the crust instead of chocolate cookies (it was what I had on hand).  Crust was crumbly but still very good.  All 5 of us liked it, and one teen commented that he didn't know people could make homemade peanut butter pie!

Ick. It sure made a pretty pie but was so sweet that I am throwing it in the trash. I followed the recipe exactly (for once) and what a mistake. Why add 1/4 sugar to the crust? After mixing the crust I could see all the sugar and I just knew something wasn't right. But I plugged along. But after trying it I knew my intuition was correct. I looked up several other recipes with Oreo crust and they didn't have any sugar, so a whole quarter cup is insane. The peanut butter part was too sweet too. I thought about remaking this with a better crust but on second thought I am sure I can find a much better recipe.

Excellent flavor. I beat the sugar and cream cheese first, added the peanut butter and then mixed with the whipped cream. I didn't use any butter in the mixture.

Pretty good although pretty sweet for my liking - would probably cut the sugar in the filling down by 1/3-1/2 cup. The crust took about 24 cookies and I omitted the sugar in the crust. Also, if you taste the filling it will be grainy - this goes away after it cools in the fridge.

I've made this many times for family Thanksgiving. and Christmas. I have two nephews who are allergic to peanuts. So I had the thought of trying pumpkin. It was a hit, very delish! Kids loved it.

This pie turned out delicious. I followed the recipe but added a little extra cream (extra 1/4 cup) to make it lighter and it came out perfect. I used shortbread cookies  crushed up as the piecrust with the butter and did not add the sugar into crust. Cookies had enough sugar. Everything else stayed the same. Love this recipe because its got no artificial whipped topping in it!

Use one box cookies for crust and increase butter by just a bit. Reduce the sugar in cream cheese mix to 3/4 cup. Whip cr cheese and sugar first, make sure it's smooth!! Then add peanut butter. No need for unsalted butter!
Increased cream to 1.5 cup. Added 1 tsp extra vanilla. 

Freeze and serve cold.

I followed the recipe almost exactly except I used a chocolate pre made crust, and I added the cream cheese and sugar together and blended them first before adding the peanut butter. Tastes and looks amazing, I will definitely make this again!

I made mine with little over half cup of peanut butter, half cup sugar, 8 oz cream cheese, mixed that.. Fold in half 16 oz whipped cream on to chocolate crust.. Smooth over the last 8 oz of whipped cream and let it set for couple hrs.. I'm sure it's gonna be awesome!!! Thanks again for idea!   :)

When I mixed the first few ingredients I thought the pie would be too heavy but thankfully the whipped cream still combined normally. It has the texture of a peanut butter cheesecake. Very tasty and also pretty heavy and very rich. Good in small slices!

Decadent. Huge hit.  Added ganache (1/2 cup heavy cream brought to rolling simmer added to 2 Tbsp peanut butter and 1 cup chocolate chips - stirred) on top of cooled peanut butter center. Whip topping on top of that. Crushed mini Reese's PB cups on top. Recipe from a friend.

I made the crust with pb oreos. I also added a thin layer of melted pb kisses to the bottom of the crust b4 adding the filling.  I added an egg & sour cream & baked this pie. It was a hit. I took it 2 a friend's house & everyone really enjoyed it.  Even with the added sweetness I didn't over do it. I will definitely be making this again

Excellent! I took it to a faculty potluck today and I should have made at least 3 pies! Next time I'll try putting a layer of chocolate ganache between the crust and the peanut butter filling or a thin layer on top of the filling. And no "whipped topping"  in this pie - I love that real whipped cream is used. I'll make it often. Thanks for a delicious recipe.

Unusual to find a recipe barely changed in the comments! This was great!  Used Oreos for the crust. I used chocolate chips-just a little-on top, and when I cut a piece drizzled caramel sauce (not the squirts stuff). Oh, and a previous was correct--cream chees MUST be mixed well w sugar first before anything else is mixed in.

Only two things I did different: 1. Bought a ready-made Oreo pie crust. 2. Cut the sugar to 3/4 cup. My husband and I both loved it. Next time, I will cut the sugar to 1/2 cup.

Terrific!  I substituted 2 cups of confectionery sugar instead of 1 cup of white, and I left out the butter.  Wonderful!  Don't over-whip the whipped cream--stop just past soft peaks.  Be prepared, folding in the whip cream is a much bigger chore than usual--it took a lot of folding. This dessert matches  best selling dessert at my favorite fancy restaurant!

I cheated and used a store-bought chocolate cookie crust. The peanut butter portion of my filling didn't get smooth even after 5-7 minutes in the stand mixer. Adding the whipped cream helped even out the texture. Filling tastes great! I garnished it with mini peanut butter cups cut in half.

Used a pretzel crust and subbed stevia for the sugar and reduced fat cream cheese for the regular.  I was craving a peanut butter pie flavored dip to eat with pretzels, then decided I wanted pie.  This is rich and creamy and sets up like a dream.  I had to add a bit more liquid to the peanut butter and cream cheese due to my sugar free option, but tasty.  Thanks for sharing.

WAY TOO RICH.  It tasted good.  Way too rich and too sweet for our tastes. It would be good as fudge.  Also my cookie crust didn't come out of the bottom because I froze it...I should have dipped it in shallow hot water first but that was my error.

My husband has always loved Peanut Butter Pie but I have never made one till now.  It was easy and delicious!  I did bake a pie shell so it is in a standard pre baked shell and topped with fresh whipped cream.  Delicious!

I made it exactly as called for, except that I used a store bought crust.  The pie was delicious!  I was pretty nervous when I saw the texture of the peanut butter, butter, sugar, and cream cheese once I mixed them.  They didn't seem "smooth" at all.  However, once I folded in the whipped cream, it ended up perfectly smooth and light.  I chose this recipe rather than one of the many other peanut butter pie recipes on this site because it called for real whipped cream rather than cool whip.  My husband was initially not all that excited about the idea of this pie, but once he had a piece he went back for more!  Easy to whip up, and a crowd pleaser!  I will definitely make this again.

This was amazing! I made it for my husband for valentines day. It was super simple to make,  I did buy a premade Oreo cookie crust and melted chocolate chips to coat the pie crust (refrigerate to harden chocolate) before adding the filling. Next time I think I will add more peanut butter though.

This was very easy to make, but the cream cheese gave it a slightly sour taste (and I used good cream cheese), which I did not care for.  Be sure to beat both the peanut butter mixture and cream very well. This will ensure a fluffy, silky texture.

It's easy, it looks creamy, BUT the filling is gritty with granules of sugar. Next time I will convert the granulated sugar to powdered sugar.

This was a big hit with my family. I followed the recipe substituting graham cracker crust for the cookie crust. I didn't have time to run to the store :-) thank you for sharing. I will be making this again. Hint the peanut butter I used was low in sugar some peanut butters have a higher sugar. Something to consider when some reviewers commented on the amount of sugar. We thought the original recipe was perfect.

Amazing, rich, and creamy! I skipped the crumb crust just because I don't care for it and used a regular pastry crust instead. I put down about half a cup of chocolate chips when the crust came out of the oven and let them melt to spread around to kind of make up for the lack of chocolate from the crumb crust. This pie was excellent the day I made it but I honestly think it was even better the next day. When I make this again I'm going to make it a day ahead. Thanks for the great submission.

This recipe was absolutely wonderful...loved the richness of the pie. I did not bake the crust and doubled the crust recipe as I most always do for cream pies...I love the texture of the pie accompanying the crust. I prepared a grape jelly sauce and drizzled the top. Well, I can say it went together like peanut butter and jelly.

I made this for a pre-Easter family gathering. I wish now I had made 2! Omgosh, yumm! I filled others suggestions with the recipe; doubled the crust, spread melted choc chips over the crust, cut the sugar to 3/4c, & increased the cream as recommended. Garnished w/mini Pb cups. Can't tell you how much I/we love this pie! Amazing!

I guess it's just a matter of taste, but I cannot for the life of me see how this got any bad ratings? I've baked at 2 restaurants now...at the last one this was the signature dessert.  It sold like wildfire and no one ever complained about it!!  Yes it is rich, but that's the way it's supposed to be!! I always dumped everything together (except the cream) and just mixed away, then folded in the whipped cream.  It NEVER came out less than wonderful!!

This was a rich, delicious dessert.  I used chunky PB as a personal preference and reduced the sugar to 3/4 cup. To make it creamier increase the heavy cream to 1.5 cups.  Definitely a keeper.

I made this for my husband for his birthday. He loves anything peanut butter flavored and was very satisfied and excited when he got to dig in. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is because of how STRONG the peanut butter flavor was. However, it is called peanut butter pie, not peanut butter cheesecake. I would have preferred a little more cream cheese flavor so next time I will add more cream cheese and a little less peanut butter. This is a great recipe, though, and I do recommend it to anyone who is or knows a peanut butter fanatic. Thanks so much for sharing!

This is delicious. It's also easy to make dairy-free for an allergy. Instead of butter I use unsalted Fleishman's sticks and for the whipping cream, I use Rich Whip. Great recipe and easy to make!

This was the thanksgiving hit! It went the fastest (I made 8 other pies). I used chocolate creme filled Oreos for the crust (crushed in the food processor, and mixed with melted butter, but left out the sugar). After I made the pie, I mixed peanut butter and warm cream to make a drizzle for the top, as well as a chocolate cream to drizzle the other way. I piped whipped cream around the edge and added chopped peanut butter cups. It was pretty and YUMMY!!!! make this pie and everyone will sing your praises!!!

OMG. This was FANTASTIC! So rich you only need a small piece. I'm drooling just thinking about it. I made it exactly as stated except I used low fat cream cheese, just to cut the fat a little bit. Best peanut butter desert I've ever had.

I think my family loved me a little more after I brought this to memorial day dinner. I cut the sugar to 3/4 cup and used 1 1/2 cup cool whip. It was amazing. For the top I just bought a reeces peanut butter cup and broke it into tiny pieces over the pie. SO GOOD!

This pie should be outlawed.  It was sooooo good, and I can't even imagine how much fat and calories it has in it.  Very very rich.  The only change I made was not planned--I didn't know I was almost out of sugar, so I had to use 1/2 cup regular sugar and 1/2 cup powdered sugar.  I doubt it made much difference.  This pie was seriously awesome.  I drizzled hot fudge sauce all over the pie, then topped it with whipped cream.

This pie is easy and delicious.  The cream cheese balances out the peanut butter, and the combination of the velvety filling and the cookie crust is divine.  Your guests will think you worked for hours on this one!

I made the recipe as written.  I probably will add less sugar next time and none in the crust.  When I asked my family how many stars should I give it, they said "10"!  I said no, from 1 to 5 and they said "we still say 10"!!  It was very good but rich.  And don't spoil the taste by looking at the calories like I did!

I used a store bought oreo crust as I was pressed for time and it turned out great! It got better the longer it sat and it was really the best the next day. I thought this was excellent but my family wasnt as excited about it as I was. It is really rich and heavy on the peanut flavor. I loved it.

this is tasty and good texture. Instead of the cookie crumb crust I tried this with the chocolate rice crispy crust and excellent flavor everyone at the party wanted the recipe.

Exactly the peanut butter pie I was looking for!  I chose to use a large, premade graham cracker crust- I was in a hurry.  Will definitely try the chocolate crust next time!

This was an easy and delicious recipe.  I purchased a 16 oz. carton of heavy whipping cream for the recipe and used what was left to make a whip cream topper. (I whipped the cream and added 2 tbs. sugar and 1/2 tsp vanilla.  I topped that with shaved Hershey bar pieces.

Great job Stephanie! I also needed a dessert for the church's annual Jamaica cake walk.  I didn't want to go to the store to get ingredients for another dssert I had planned on making so I scrounged around to see what I had on hand. I had a graham cracker crust and used that.  I had some pure peanut butter without added sugar or other additives so I used what I had on hand.  The whippng cream gave it richness without being too sweet.  It was fast and easy.  I added milk chocolate chips on top to give it a little extra look. yum. I will definitely make this again.

I've been making a pie similar to this for about 10 years, but I think mine is even simpler. Crust is the same. Mine has peanut butter, cream cheese, powdered sugar and Whipped topping (like cool whip). I will try this one and see if it is much different. I like using real whipping cream/

This was so easy to make. I used my Kitchen Aid to whip the cream, if I didn't it would have been a lot more work (but worth it) by hand. I used a store bought chocolate crumb pie crust which saved me time and no baking (nice for the summer months). I can't wait to eat this tomorrow at my neighborhood cookout. The filling tasted so good from the dab I tasted off my finger. I might not even garnish with chocolate, it doesn't need it. I also love the fact that it isn't overwhelmingly sweet. I will be adding this to my recipe box and I will use this recipe many times in the future.

This recipe ROCKS!! If you like peanut butter, this is the recipe for you! I made it exactly by the recipe, and topped with chopped peanut butter cups, a drizzle of homemade hot fudge sauce, and whipped cream. YUM! Thanks for an excellent recipe. It is rich and over the top, but what the heck!

Rich and addictive. I don't make this often. Not because I don't love it, because I do, but because I could eat the whole pie myself!

Okay I cheated and took a few shortcuts being pressed for time. I bought a premade oreo crust (which can be found in the baking aisle) and used and 2 cups cool whip instead of whipping my own. 45 minutes in the freezer had it chilled perfectly. This pie was nothing short of heavenly! Everyone loved it! Its super rich so served with a tall glass of milk and keep in mind a little slice goes a LONG way!

To rich and sweet for me.  Looked beautiful but way to much rich ingredients combined together.  Almost like a peanut butter fudge.  A little piece goes a long way.

Thanks for the receipe.  I do like to experiment.

When I made this, I was sure it wouldn't turn out. The peanut butter mixture looked so thick, like cookie batter, but when I put in the whipped heavy cream it really mixed in well. It was so light, and I topped it with chopped up mini peanut butter cups. It does get warm really quick though, so next time I might pop it in the freezer for an hour beforehand.

I made this pie for Thanksgiving dinner and it was a hit.  I did not try it because I am not a sweet eater but I rated it at 5 because of the comments I received.  I did use a pre made chocolate crumb crust and used Cool Whip vice heavy whipping cream.  I also garnished with Reece's Peanut Butter cups.  Very eye appealing.  Will make again.

This pie has been such a huge hit, I have to make 2 more for this weekend, just to take to work! I substituted 1/4 cup sugar for 1/2 cup of heavy cream. I also made a regular graham cracker crust instead of chocolate cookie crust, which I've been told is a good move because it would have made the pie a little too rich with the chocolate cookie. Overall, I will use this recipe everytime!

OMG I was in pie heaven when I ate this.  I cheated and used a pre-made Oreo crust, but other than that, I followed this recipe to a tee.  The only issue I had was that it was a little too sweet for my taste.  But it still deserves 5 stars :)  Thanks!

Fantastic change to the traditional whipped creme pies! I made a few changes and used one container cool whip, prepared oreo cookie pie crust and cut the sugar down to half a cup. I made the pie the night and drizzled choco syrup on the side of pie plate instead of on top. Also, the pie tasted much better slightly frozen! Yum.

Very tasty! I will definitely make this again except I don't think I will take the advice of others and double the crust.  I do agree this is the best part but maybe it was my own error of not pressing the crust out evenly since some parts were hard to get my fork through though I used a bigger pan than suggested :(  Also, others suggest freezing it a couple hours before serving but I kept the pie in the fridge for 24 hrs before slicing and thought the consistency was great, not too soft not too firm.

Next time I will buy a pre-made crust to save time.  To me they taste just as good and less work.

I did sprinkle the top with cookie crumbs and I had some peanut butter chips on hand so I slightly chopped a hand full and sprinkle that on top as well.

Good, but not outstanding.  Added LOTS of cut up Reese's Peanutbutter Cups to one attempt, still not out of this world.

this is good just a little sweet and I used dream whip instead of heavy whipping cream and cut the sugar some but still needed to cut more.

Awesome! One of the best pies I've ever eaten. The key to this pie is allowing enough time for the flavors to meld together. I made this pie on Thanksgiving day. (Forgot to make a desert for my husband who is picky about sweets.) On Thanksgiving the pie was good, something different. But the next day...Oh My! The flavor was extraordinary! The only alteration made was in the crust. I didn't have chocolate cookie crumbs, but substituted with graham crackers. TY so much for sharing your recipe with us Stephanie. This has become a keeper for my family.

This is delicious.  The filling is so smooth, rich and peanut buttery.  I had to use half regular peanut butter and half unsweetened and it came out perfectly.  I froze it for a little while too so it would be a little more set and topped it with whipped cream.  Thanks for the recipe.

My family thought it tasted like a Reese's peanut butter cup.  I used about 1 3/4 cup of the whipping cream and mixed in 1/2 cup of mini-chocolate chips.  I also used the store bought pie shell.  Excellent!!

Wow!  This was very rich!  Which is a good thing with desserts in my opinion.  I used a store bought cookie crust and added chopped peanut butter cups to the top.

I used a ready made chocolate crust and added some mini chocolate chips.  It was very tasty and quick and easy to make for when you need something sweet, but not an overly impressive dessert.  Nothing people at my gathering raved about.

This is exactly what I was looking for.  Sometimes I like to add the mini chocolate chips into the peanut butter mixture before putting it into the crust.  Thanks for the recipe.

This is my husband's new favorite desert!  It is not too sweet and has a great flavor.  I used crunchy peanut butter because I like the texture that it adds, so I mounded my measuring cup to make sure I had enough peanut butter :)  Also, my husband doesn't like chocolate, so I make one with chocolate cookie crumbs for the rest of us and one with graham cracker crumbs for him.  I garnish that one with cinnamon to give it some color.  They are both very tasty.

This pie was awesome!  I liked it better out of the refrigerator, rather than the freezer...more creamy.  I also recommend a homemade crust rather than store-bought to make it absolutely perfect.  I can't wait to bring this pie to future parties!!

We LOVE this recipe. It's quite rich so sometimes I cut the peanut butter and cream cheese, just a little. I also find any mixer is easier than trying to stir peanut butter and cream cheese together manually. ... But LOVE this recipe!

I've started making this recipe with several alterations and it always turns out great!! Beat together 1 c. confectioner’s sugar, 1 c. creamy peanut butter, 1-8 oz. Pkg. cream cheese. Beat in 1-14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk, then fold in 1-12 oz. container of Cool Whip, thawed. Line a graham cracker crust with sliced banana and fill with the peanut butter mixture. Chill for 8 hours then drizzle Hershey’s chocolate syrup over the top. This recipe makes 2-9 in. pies and it ALWAYS gets rave reviews.

This pie is great!  Instead of making a crust, I buy the Oreo chocolate cookie crust and it's wonderful.  The only thing I do differently is to stir in 1/2 c. of Nestle Toll House MINI chocolate chips before folding in the cream.  We like it with plenty of Hershey's chocolate syrup and a big spoonful of Cool Whip....as if it needed anything, lol.  I beat the mixture for about 5 mins. and didn't have a problem with the sugar making it grainy.  I serve it from and store it in the FREEZER (let it sit out 5-10 mins. before cutting) and it's much better than simply refrigerated.  This is the exact recipe I have been searching for.  It's just like the Peanut Butter Pie that used to be served at "Cracker Barrel" resturants.  Thank you!

I made a few modifications: I just bought a pre-made oreo pie crust so that I didn't have to make one. Also, I didn't have whipping cream so I used an 8 oz. tub of cool whip. Since it is sweetened already (unlike making your own from whipping cream), I left out about 1/2 of the sugar.

The pie was good but VERY VERY rich. It was difficult to finish a whole slice in one sitting. Still good, though.
