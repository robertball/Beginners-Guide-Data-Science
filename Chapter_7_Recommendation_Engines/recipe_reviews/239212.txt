I needed a cobbler recipe for my son's homecoming...I loved the sound of this one.  And now we all the love taste of it.  I used blueberries from our garden...and then topped it with a streusel and nuts.  It was exceptional with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream!!!!

I made this cobbler with the only addition being some blue berries along with the peaches. The fruit part was good,but the dough on the bottom was just plain awful. I thought about adding some vanilla or something, but didn't. I don't think it would have helped. It was heavy and tasteless. I won't try this one again.

Did not look like the photo. Batter could not be poured it was dough that I globbed onto the butter. Something was not right with this recipe. I cooked it double the amount of time and it's swimming in butter and the dough looks awful

No didn't make any changes. We thought it was too grease so probably should  have only used half the amount of butter.

The taste was there but very tough edges by the time it was done in the middle.  It did not rise, and was kind of flat in taste.  Must be something lacking in this recipe.  I will not make it again, wasted my hand picked blueberries and blackberries.  Very disappointing.
