My husband really liked this but the kids weren't too wild about the spicy part but next time I will make some peices without the pepper just for them.  I liked the idea of crunchy fillets without frying.  All in all an easy family pleaser

Close to 5 stars, very good recipe.  One of the few where the cornflake crumbs don't just make the meal taste like soggy cereal!  The texture of the fish is great (except for the bottom getting a little soggy - cooking on a rack would probably solve that problem).  I did run out of eggs and had to use milk to hold the coating on, which didn't seem to cause any problems (except maybe the soggy bottom!).  These weren't really very spicy, and we doubled the red pepper, but they had just enough flavor to be interesting.  These made the house smell like fish sticks while cooking, which made everyone hungry!

I thought this was great!  I used bread crumbs instead of the cornflakes, and added lemon seasoning and a pinch of Old Bay spice to the coating.  This turned out excellent - very crispy and yet still healthy.

This recipe is mediocre. I really wasn't that impressed. There are much better fish recipes like the Fisherman's Quick Fish.

Just delicious!  I used flounder fillets and the coating was delicate and crispy - just right!  I will definitely make this again.

Another good recipe.  Only thing I did different was instead of ground red pepper, I used creole seasoning and some lemon pepper in the corn flake crumbs.  I also put the corn flakes in the blender to get them fine enough before mixing with the spices.

used crushed fiberone and organic multigrain flakes.. and milk to put it on. Just made the one serving.used about 1/6 of a cup of each, parmesan and crushed cereal. was very good, will make again. Probably add more spices of some sort... found it kind of plain :)but still good way to use up some cereal and adds vitamins to your meal if you used fortified cereal :)

This was just Ok for us.  Maybe it's just that cod is kindof a bland fish, but we weren't that impressed by it.  I used bread crumbs and doubled the amount of red pepper.  Serving it with tartar sauce made it a little more interesting.

Easy and very yummy! I use this recipe all the time, on various types of fish. I substituted bread crumbs for the corn flakes and it comes out terrific.

This was really good - tasted just like boughten fish sticks to my kids.  A great alternative for those of us who are on a gluten-free diet due to Celiac disease.!

This is a wonderful recipe!  I used tilapia and left out the red pepper and added lemon pepper.  It was absolutely delicious!  I will be making this one A LOT!  Turned out really crunchy and had lots of flavor.

My wife, brother in law and I all loved this recipe.  My brother in law's actual words were "You could make that again anytime!".  I added a few teaspoons of cajun seasoning rather than red pepper and it turned out great.  The nice thing is, it's fast.  Preparation time is maybe 15 minutes and the cook time is even less.  Try it out, you won't be disappointed!

Not having corn flake crumbs I crushed spiced croutons. We liked this so much I will keep making it this way. This is the best way to cook sole. 
Ijust used this recipe on cod so we could once again fish and chips and it was awesome! We can't eat fried foods and this worked out well. I did use less parmeasan cheese and will try using a rack on top of the baking sheet so the bottom of the fish gets crisp also.

My family really liked this recipe.  I will definitely use it again.  I added some additional spices and used A LOT of grated cheese because we can't get enough of it and the fish tasted great.  Thanks for the recipe!

My boyfriend enjoyed this.  I am not a huge fan of Parmesan cheese so it was not one of my favorites.  I used cod and it worked very well.

My family enjoyed this recipe.  I used perch marinated in sweet vinegar and olive oil first.  The parmesan cheese in the breading gave it a nice tangy taste.  Will definitely use this recipe again!

I substituted the corn flakes and pepper with crushed spicy pork rinds for lower carbs. We loved it! Real colorful too.
