I was dubious about a recipe with only 1 review, but I tried it anyway. Doubled the recipe. Put sliced yukon potatoes on the bottom of a roasting pan together with a package of mini carrots.  Chicken on top and then sauce.  Used boneless thighs and drumsticks (15 pieces). Baked 45 minutes at 400 F.  The meat broke apart with a fork. My son said I should post a review.  My only complaint was that the wasn't enough sauce, I will increase that next time.

This is nice. I recommend trying it. However, I think the balsamic vinegar masks the dill pickle flavor. Next time, I will use the dill pickle brine in place of the vinegar. The amount of sauce is fantastic. I will add potatoes to it next time, too.
