Yes indeed, Sara. This salad recipe is very different, but amazingly tasty, too. It was a hit at my ladies luncheon! But I had to add...you guessed it......2/3 cup CELERY! My celery fetish is well known with my friends. Plain or stuffed with peanut butter, cheese, tuna,or whatever! I love celery!! It must go in most of my fruit salads, all my green salads and all my vegetable and potato salads.I am never without celery. LOL Thanks for sharing this unique recipe.

I LOVED this recipe because it was different. Definately not your traditional chicken salad.

This was my first time having curry.  I did not like the salad at all!  My husband and sister did however like it alot.  16 potatoes is WAY too much...I used 13 and it was still overwhelming.  Also, adding a bit of fresh chopped parsely added some color and a fresh flavor.

This was really good but I tweaked it a bit. My husband is not an artichoke fan and the potatoes didnt seem right so I used 1 peeled granny smith apple, chopped. I toasted chopped walnuts and added those too. I also added cayenne and a little more curry. It has become a favorite salad. Great in pita bread!

Several things: way too many potatoes, I ended up cutting the amounts in half and omitting the lettuce (we're just two people) also, I added 1 stick of chopped celery and some leftover bell pepper. This is one really yummy salad. Great texture and variety of flavors and it's filled with vitamins. Thanks for the recipe, it was absolutely DIVINE!!!!

This recipe tasted ok.  It seems like it is missing something though.  Maybe i'm just used to typical chicken salad recipes...but it seems like it needed almond slices or grapes or some other flavor to add.  Just ideas.   We are a huge fan of recipes with chicken and artichokes, however this one was just ok.

This is wonderful base for this specific chicken salad. I brined my chicken over night in apple juice. I eliminated the red onion, using sweet onion and minced both the onion and the celery. Added pistachios, sweet relish, and cayenne pepper for a kick.
