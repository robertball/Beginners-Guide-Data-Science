These have the most original taste of anything I have ever made!  I did put the "dough" in the fridge for 1/2 hr before I made it into balls.  Kept my hands coated with 10x sugar while I rolled them.  I also double coated with 10x sugar.

A bit time consuming to make.  I found it difficult to roll them into balls, and hold the shape.  But the taste after setting for a day or two is great.

These are delicious! Very moist, and I love the flavor! I wonder if they can be baked without ruining them? As is, it seems kind of like eating dough.

Good flavor but I diliked the texture so much that I did not serve them.  Since it was the holidays I didn't have time to experiment. Maybe using this mix as a baked pie crust would be good.

EASY  to prepare.  I think frozen lemonade could be used also.  Still undecided if I like them or not.  very different flavor.  Great to make with kids as they require no cooking.

This recipe is one of our favorites for Christmas. We give holiday gift baskets to friends and family, and this cookie is always included. It is easy to make and not too sweet, so it is easily my husband's favorite as he doesn't like sweets all that much. Thanks so much for the recipe!

This probably comes from a bias of baked goods but I wanted a quick no-bake after another holiday recipe fell through.  Also wasn't certain about 4 cups of grahams so I went through a full box which still did not amount to 4 cups.  At a late hour, had to grab a pre-made Graham Crust (chocolate) and threw into the batter.  Sort of a orange chocolate thing going-on!  Used walnuts instead of pecans. After a quick mix as (near) described, I found the consistency too wet ; pasty, and unable to set for shape.  Had to throw in fridge overnight. 
After the refrigeration it was more workable but still fudge-like in consistency and taste. Since I had to "sell" these at a Christmas function, I renamed it as Chocolate Snowball Fudge... and they did well !

The taste is good, but they wouldn't set up. Even after being in the freezer they were mooshy.  Not sure what I did wrong.
