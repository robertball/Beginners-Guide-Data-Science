Yummy! My husband loved these.The only thing I would do different when making these again is to add garlic. I did fry in olive oil instead of the oil/butter mix.

Good, but I had problems with the patties breaking up.  I added 2 more egg whites and chilled for twenty minutes before frying.

I had never tasted or made zucchini cakes before.  EVER.  I used this recipe as a jumping off start.  I made some changes according to my family's likes while keeping the balance of the original recipe in mind.  I'm sure it would have been good just as it is however if you like a little more zing, this recipe is easy to customize.  Enjoy!-- 

BTW,I doubled the original recipe then added another 2 eggs, another cup of bread crumbs, 1 ear of fresh corn blanched and cut off the cob, three chopped green onions, a tsp more of old bay, 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper, the juice of half a lemon and a 1/2 tsp of salt.  I came out with 12 patties a little smaller then an english muffin. I browned in a little bit of bacon drippings from breakfast and a pat of butter.  I served with a big wedge salad for a hot summer day supper.  I had lemon wedges, Tabasco, cocktail sauce ketchup and salt/pepper on the table.  My family devoured!!

I was fooled. Taste like crab cakes. I did not have some of the  ingredients so i substituted onion for green onions,  green pepper for red, cajun seasoning for seafood seasoning.  Also added 1 egg white.  Omitted the red pepper flakes and mayo. Mixed in the bread crumbs last, adding just enough to keep the mixture moist to make the patties.

Made these today and they're ok, not as great as the previous reviews. I'll keep looking for other versions of this.

Will try again but won't salt zucchinis, rather treat them like spinach and squeeze extra moisture out. I may have over salted but the cakes were way too salty. I like that this recipe doesn't call for dairy like others.

I took the suggestion and used Greek plain yogurt instead of mayo. The chef was not exaggerating when she said these cakes will fool crab cake lovers. I lived in Maryland crab cake country and these are just as tasty. To get as much liquid out of the zucchini, I used a clean kitchen towel. Cooked the cakes in a cast iron skillet with coconut oil and served them with a lemon wedge. Yummmmm!!!

These were good - chose to use up some shredded zucchini in my freezer.  I didn't have green onions or red bell peppers, so threw in some onion powder and some dried peppers.  Otherwise stayed mostly true to the recipe except for 1/2 cup of the bread crumbs - this was good.  I overcooked them a bit on the stove and they needed a bit of salt, but were otherwise fine.

I simply made as written and they turned out very well. For those who had issues with breakage, the key is being gentle. Lift your raw cakes with a spatula and lay them in the skillet gently. Let them cook longer than you think they might need on the first side, then swiftly turn them.

If I was going to change anything,  it would be brightening them with fresh parsley or cilantro.

No need to post this as a vegan alternative to crab cakes. 
I was looking for a recipe for shredded zucchini I had in the freezer from last season. Substitute rosemary/thyme (or any combination of spices you normally use with meat) for the seafood seasoning and you'll have a fabulous side for any meat dish . . . mine was beef stroganoff.
I chose this recipe from all the others out there, as with one egg (and 2 cups of zucchini squashed down to a heavy hand full), I could use less breadcrumbs.

Tasty.  The addition of the seafood seasoning really makes the flavor great.  I had more zucchini and adjusted the recipe accordingly and it still came out great.  I added 1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend to give some chewiness and stability to the patties.
