I enjoyed making the dough and filling! I used honeycrisp apples since I couldn't find yellow. It did take mine 30 minutes to brown. This worked great for my lactose intolerant son. Next time I will put this in a baking dish and add extra sugar. I wouldn't mind it a rich sweeter.. Maybe even a few tablespoons of extra brown sugar.
