Awesome!!  I marinated the pork (butt) overnight, then made it in a slow cooker (low for 10 hours).  Perfect!  For stovetop gravy, I took 3/4 cup of juices and added cornstarch, then a pinch of salt, pepper, savory, ginger, and parsley.  Great!  Thanks for the recipe!

This is a great recipe that I recommend to everyone. On my second attempt I pricked the meat before marinating and the flavour was too intense.

Too much soy sauce!  The taste was too overwhelming.  My husband politely scraped the sauce off the pork.  I didn't see what the others saw in this dish!

This was the best pork roast we had in a long time.  Only one change, I slow-cooked the roast in the oven on 250 degrees for 3 hours and then raised the heat to 300 degrees and removed the lid so the pork could get nice and brown.

This was really good. I added a little chinese five spice powder (maybe about 1/8 tsp)and let it marinade overnight. This was a cheap roast that came out very tender. I did have a problem with the marinad burning on the bottom of the pan (maybe add a little water). Leftovers are great diced up in fried rice.

I am picky, but this deserves 5 stars! Great in the crock pot, as one reviewer tipped me, and just like my oriental friends make their roast marinade. Served with rice and vegetables it is a delicious meal! Yes, the flavor is STRONG, so people who do not care for strong flavor might choose something else. But for taste it is just like in a resteraunt!

Was this ever good! Made it for New Year's Day & was a hit. I only had 2 TBL. honey left but it still came out good. I also surrounded roast with quartered potatoes. Roast was absolutely so moist & tender. Thanks!

My family loved this and ate well tonight.  I think it could use some spice though.  Next time I'll add a little hoisin sauce to the marinade.  It was cooked perfectly, moist on the inside and browned on the outside (I didn't tent it).

I used a 3 pound boneless pork loin instead of the bone-in roast and it was wonderful! My husband and teenage son just devoured it! In fact, I served  myself a small portion before running an errand and when I got home, IT WAS GONE! Served along side an Asian chopped salad and oven roasted green beans, it makes a wonderful meal suitable for guests.

Ok, so, I forgot to get the roast out of the freezer, and it was on the menu, so I decided to throw it all in the crock pot.  It was wonderful.  Oh and I didnt have soy sauce either, so I used teriyaki.  Very good, will make again.  Thank you for sharing.

I used pork loin medallions.. This is a perfect recipe.  I have made it several times, and when there is left overs, I chiffonade the meat and use it in Pork Fried Rice...

The flavor, mostly the soy sauce, was too strong and overpowering.  This does not seem like an authentic Chinese dish.

I made this with a pork tenderloin that I marinaded overnight. The flavor was good but it was missing something, and I'm not sure what. I plan on using the leftovers to make egg rolls tomorrow. Thanks!

This was not good. Too much sherry.  Leave it out! I wasted a very expensive cut of meat. the taste was overwhelmingly bad.  Note: I did the recipe as indicated.

Amazing!  This was the best pork roast I have ever made.  Because I only had a 2 lb roast I decreased the cooking time to about 2 hours total.  
Also, I am nervous about basting meat in marinade used for raw meat, so I boiled the marinade before using to baste.  
The roast was moist, juicy and the outside with the glaze was to die for.  My husband who usually likes the inside pieces fought with me over the ends.

Let me start off by saying that while this was in the oven cooking, the smell was fantastic!  We enjoyed very much and I think the leftovers will be great in a fried rice dish.  (See photo)  I agree with another reviewer that you better like soy sauce when you make this because it is strong tasting.  Thanks Christine

This was fantastic! My husband and our company raved about it!  This sauce would be good with chicken as well!  The only problem I had was the roast took about 45 min longer than supposed to.  Not too big of a deal and it was well worth the wait!

A all day slow cooker pork roast as is.  I usually use a shoulder roast, with or without the bone, depending on price and what I can find, and follow the directions exactly.  Easy to throw together in the morning before you head out the door or the night before and let it marinate in the fridge over night.

This was pretty good; good enough I will make it again.  I used low sodium soy sauce and followed the recipe except I didn't make the extra sauce.  I just couldn't bring myself to use the liquid the meat had been marinating in!  I marinated overnight but I didn't think the flavor got all through the meat.  I probably should have pierced it a little better.

I prepared this in my "slow cooker."  The cooker is a newer model and cooks things super quickly.  I used the "high" setting and my five pound roast was perfectly done in 1 1/2 hours.  The aroma was wonderful and the meat was a perfect compliment to the dressing, Bavarian sauerkraut, and gravy that I prepared.  In a word; awesome!

There was too much sauce in this pork. It was good without the extra marinade that you thicken. We all tried to get it off the meat. It was too strong. If I make it again I will omit this.

This was INCREDIBLE! I didn't boil down the rest of the marinade to serve with the roast, but it was great, just the same. A friend of ours had dinner with us last night and he praised the roast on how tender it was and said it was hard to get roasts so tender and moist.  Thanks for sharing your great recipe with us, Christine!

This was wonderful!  Our favorite meat is pork, so I have quite a few recipes (several from this great recipe site). The roast was tender and the marinade which then became the sauce was out of this world!  Although it didn't affect the roast any, I would spray with Pam next time for easier clean-up.  I used a glass casserole dish and the marinade would roll down the roast and burn at the bottom, don't know how to prevent that but it won't stop me from making this different pork roast again.

This is an excellent recipe!  I have made it twice.  The second time I double wrapped it in foil and bbq'd it for 2 hrs.  (2lb roast)  It was so tender!

Absolutely perfect! Rich, deep, and authentically Chinese flavor.  The only substitute I made when originally making this was using 2 tablespoons of fresh ginger (I use the paste in a tube sold in my produce section).  The fresh ginger has a brighter flavor than dried and is perfect for something like this.  It was a massive hit, and I made again a few days later with the addition of 1 teaspoon of Chinese five spice powder mixed into the marinade. Even better!!

Yes, the flavor is strong, it's a highly reduced sauce! Don't pour it all over the slices until you've tasted it!  A little drizzle is more than enough for a slice.  I serve this with steamed rice and steamed bok choy.

I was a little nervous at all the reviews saying the flavor was overwhelming. I marinated this overnight and the flavor was great and definitely not overwhelming. Only issue I had was my oven doesn't heat correctly at 325 so I had to cook at 350 and I left it a little too long so some parts dried a little. Great recipe full of flavor. I will definitely make this again and try in a slow cooker.

I used a very lean boneless pork sirloin roast -- the meat came out very juicy and not at all dry.  One note, I did not pierce the meat.  I marinated overnight and substituted pineapple juice for the sherry.  One word of caution, marinade was very good but as a gravy a little goes a very long way!  I served it with a fried rice recipe found on this site.  Thanks for the recipe, everyone enjoyed it.

I made this in the crock pot and cooked it for about 7 hours on low.  It came out very tasty but just a little dry.  I think I must have cooked it a little too long.  I made it for company and it got great reviews.  It was also very easy to make since I used the crock pot.

Did this with a small pork tenderloin in the crock pot. Delicious! Serve with the sauce as a gravy. I cut up the leftovers and used it in the "lo mein noodles" recipe I found on here. This recipe is a keeper.

Have made this recipe several times making adjustments with what I had on hand. Substituting apple juice for honey, garlic powder for fresh, etc. and every time this comes out perfect.  Roast can be used as an addition to many asian dishes as well as a stand alone! Thanks for posting!

Marinaded overnight and cooked in slow cooker on medium for 6 hours.  I only used 1/2 cup of soy sauce cause it was all I had (I think 3/4 would have been too much).  Family enjoyed the pork (wasn't dry) and we were split on the marinade sauce.  Some thought it was too strong but others thought it was good and a nice break from our usual ketchup on pork.

Awesome!  I did not have any honey or dry sherry, used a sweet wine instead.  I also smoked it slow for about 10 hrs.  Meat was not dry, very tender and delicious!  Will make again.

This was a great recipe for it's short list of ingredients and flavor.  I used a 2.5 lb boneless pork roast & cooked it for about 2 hours.  I can see where you might not like it if heavy soy flavor isn't your thing, but my husband and I both enjoyed it.

I loved this roast.  My husband is a great sport but does not dole out compliments unless he's really liked something I make and he loved this.

Very good.  I think I would have preferred to use low-sodium soy sauce.  It was quite salty, but tasty.  My kids ate a lot of it.  The sauce thickened beautifully.  I would make it again.

This was greatI  Easy to prepare and cook.  Since it was about 85 degrees, I decided to cook outside.  It takes a while to cook but it is so tender.  I didn't even marinate it.
Left overs? great in sandwhiches.

This was a wonderful recipe - followed it exactly, though I had a 9 lb bone in roast so I had to cook it longer... WONDERFUL! When my son-in-law took his first bite, he said, "This is awesome!" Everyone else around the table loved it too.  Definitely a do-over!

I've made this twice now, once without the sherry and once with. I followed the recipe precisely, and I just do not see what others do in this recipe. I'm aiming to reproduce the roast pork I get in Chinese restaurants in the northeast US, and this is nowhere close. The roast itself came out somehow a mix of bland and bitter, and the sauce was not something I've ever had at a Chinese restaurant. Can't recommend as written.

OK, but disappointing. The pork didn't have much of the marinade flavor throughout the meat. When combining the cornstarch, water & remaining marinade to cook & serve over the pork, we thought it was very salty tasting. Did everything according to directions except we used a pork loin instead of a pork roast. We had 1 1/4 lb loin but did size everything accordingly & the bake time. I think if we'd used a roast maybe the flavor would've been more throughout the meat, but the saltiness would've still been a problem for us.

I made no changes except to cook it in a crock pot, then use the marinade and juices  to make the gravy as directed. Served over rice. Delicious!

This was great! I followed the recipe word for word, except it was cooked through  in only 1 1/2 hours. Everyone loved it! 
The loin had ribs attached, and people dipped them in the gravy.

Have actually made this several times according to the recipe and it returns a nice, flavorful, moist roast.  I have made it with both bone-in and using a boneless pork loin.  I believe the bone-in is better but the boneless gives you a wonderful start to pork medallions that really works well with the gravy. Thanks for the recipe.

Marinated the roast for 2 days and then cooked it in the slow cooker. We found it very dry and way to salty.

Before I even cook this bad boy! I know it's going to be a HIT! I have used the seasonings mentioned which make for an excellent flavor and glaze. This will be this Sunday's Main Course Meat.
