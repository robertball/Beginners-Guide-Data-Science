I used sliced Baby Bella mushrooms, chopped red bell peppers instead of green and I used what I call "a mess" of fresh garlic (and what I mean is instead of measuring out a tablespoon, I just chopped up a handful of fresh cloves). Instead of using water, I used organic beef broth. This is very, very good. I had a cup and a half for lunch today and I'm thinking about going back for more. What I love most about this is it's filling without going overboard and you can indulge and half a little more without feeling guilty. GREAT recipe--a snap to prepare.

I made chili the other day--almost exactly like this--and it was delicious!  Some people don't like chili minus the "beef" component, so I take some wheat berries and quinoa and cook in some veggie "beef" broth by Better Than Bullion and it gives a great flavor, and texture to the chili that satisfies my non-veggie friends.  Additionally, the grains give a lot of nutritional value in an almost non-fat medium.

Hope you enjoy it if you give it a try, and thanks for a great recipe!

This is such a great vegetarian chili recipe! Next time I would use diced tomatoes instead of the whole ones though (just a personal preference). Also, I used a quarter cup of coffee instead of red wine since I didn't have any around- worked great! I also drained my beans instead of using the juices. 

Sure to be a hit!

We make this chili every week!  It's incredible.  We've only made a few changes over the months- instead of all black beans, we use a can of each black, kidney, garbanzo beans, we throw in a few handfuls of chopped kale, and we use heaping portions of the spices (and fresh basil/oregano).  

This chili is incredible on the first night with sweet potato biscuits, but the leftovers are amazing as chili eggs (scramble eggs/egg-whites/tofu, when eggs are 80% done stir in a few spoonfuls of chili, cook together. lately we've been eating with toasted whole grain pitas but anything would work!)

Delicious. I've found it difficult to get a good rich chili flavor with vegetarian chilis before, but this recipe has a REALLY great flavor. I did add meatless crumbles for texture and had to leave out mushrooms because I didn't have any, but I basically did everything else as directed and the results were AWESOME. Thank you for the recipe!! This will be my go-to vegetarian chili recipe now.

Amazing! I made a version with zucchini instead of mushrooms (for friends who don't like mushrooms) and a version that followed the recipe exactly. Both were delicious, but the mushroom version was heartier and more chili like. Easy and will definitely make again!

Added zuchini rather than celery and also mixed in ground turkey.  One of the best chili recipes we have tried!

Our family all ate this!  The only thing I would change next time is less chili powder.  I used 1 Tablespoon and it ended up being too spicy for me to really enjoy the flavors of the other ingredients.  However, my husband LOVED it!

Yummy! Great chili and chock full of veggies...loved the mushrooms in this. I also added a chopped red pepper and used a can of dark red kidney beans and a can of black beans which I did drain and rinse. Otherwise this was very good and filling, Nice one Sanzoe! Thanks!

VERY good! I left out the mushrooms because I did not have any. I used one can of diced tomatoes, 1 can of rotel tomatoes, and a shiraz for the wine. I reduced the water to 1 cup and added a can of tomato sauce. I also added about a teaspoon of coco powder during the simmer. I did increase the chili powder by 2 tsp because we like spice. Served over brown rice. This smelled fantastic while cooking!

I sub'd chopped zucchini in place of mushrooms but was faithful to all other ingredients.  LOVE this chili!  The one thing I did do differently is cook it longer, and with the lid off.  The first 30 minutes I simmer with the lid on and then give it another 40-60 minutes with the lid off to evaporate off some of that water content so the *sauce* is thicker.  Thrown a lit of grated cheese on the top of each serving and we're good to go.

This recipe is deelicious.  Next time I am going to use crushed tomatoes rather than whole peeled tomatoes, which I think will make this recipe just perfect for my palate.

Thanks for a great dinner!

We've been making this chili for years. This is our go to meal when we don't have much time, but want a rich, flavorful meal.  So many veggies- very hearty! We usually double the recipe so it will last for lunches and dinners the rest of the week.  We add a little more hot sauce as we like our chili kicked up a notch.  Like most soups and chili, always better made a day or two prior, but just as delicious straight off the stove.

My mother, a fan of chili, has me make this about every other week. I found a chocolate wine for the red wine (wine with chocolate in it, not to be consumed with chocolate) and she'll eat this chili for days straight as long as there are leftovers. The only problem we have is the whole tomatoes, which must be cut with the spoon. We'll be replacing them with diced, I believe.

DELICIOUS! My vegetarian daughter was visiting, so I wanted to find something without meat that ALL of my family would love. This was it! Used half black beans and half dark red kidney beans, and added some chocolate (5 mini semi- sweet chocolate chips)as several reviewers suggested. I think the chocolate gives it a more full-bodied taste and texture. None of us missed the meat, and it was great by itself or with added cheddar or Parmesan cheese. By the way, instead of adding the hot sauce to the chili, I just placed it on the table, but none of us used it as the chili had just the right kick to it. I'll definitely make this again.

Why are there only 5 stars available?  This chili is the best!  Didn't have any Tabasco so I sprinkled in some crushed red pepper at the simmering stage.  Holy Mother of Pearl this is good.  My husband and son are 'afraid' of anything meatless, which in this case, is perfectly fine with me because I get to eat the WHOLE POT!  I can't wait to see how good it is as leftovers!  Thanks for sharing!!  
My red wine of choice is a Virginia State Wine, by Cooper Vineyards, NOCHE... it is a chocolate infused red and boy did it add to the chili.

I live with several carnivores (husband and three sons) and have been trying to convince them to eat less meat. This recipe was a hit for most of us (one sick one wasn't willing to try it). I did made several changes because of food allergies and what I had on hand and it still turned out really well (no mushrooms, celery, red wine or black beans). I also had some yellow squash that needed to be used up so I chopped it up and threw it in too (the kids never knew). In place of the black beans, I threw in dark red kidney and great northern and I just used vegetable brother in place of the wine and water. I also added a bit of molasses and pumpkin pie spice to satisfy my sweet tooth. It turned out really well! My husband said that it's a keeper and that he didn't miss the meat!

I love that this flavorful chili is packed with fresh vegetables! What a healthy alternative for lunch or dinner. So filling and tasty! Each serving is four PointsPlus on Weight Watchers. It is also quick to put together.

This is good stuff! I made it a day ahead of time and reheated it the next day and it was outstanding. We ate it with some prepared quinoa stirred in and served it with saltines. My son who hates mushrooms loved it (they were chopped and he didn't notice them). My husband loves my ground round chili, and he loved this. I used my pampered chef chopper to rough chop all of the vegetables so that when cooked it looked like chili and not vegetable soup. Here are the small adjustments I made: hate bell peppers and chunks of tomatoes, so I puréed stewed tomatoes, added a bit more chili powder, tsp or so of oregano, 1 or 2 tsp cocoa, red pepper flakes, and tabasco sauce. Very aromatic and delicious. Thank you!

I mostly followed the recipe and it turned out great! I didn't measure the veggies or spices, I added a big handful of chopped kale and a heaping tablespoon of crunchy peanut butter! I used cashews in a chili recipe once and loved it so I thought I'd try peanut butter since I had some. I also used one can of kidney and one can of black beans and topped it with cheddar cheese, green onions and a bit of low fat plain yogurt. It was yummy.

I changed a few things, and it was great.  I used 1 1/2c dried kidney beans, and 1c dried chickpeas instead of any canned beans, and I used the quick soak method and then boiled them with the onions and spices and a piece of kombu.  Then I added the tomatoes and paste at the end.  I also left out the mushrooms, wine, and pepper sauce, and it was still pretty good.

I never follow recipes to the T, but use them as guidelines. This is a great one! I put in less beans (I only had one can on hand), and added a lot more hot sauce, plus potatoes and fake sausage meat from Trader Joes. I think it's called GimmeLean. I also didn't use the tomato paste or wine, and it turned out fine. Better than fine! Going to make it again today!

Loved it. My BF didn't even miss the meat. Not enough beans. I used 3 cans (not cups). One each of black, pinto and kidney with the juices. It was just right. And next time  I will double up on veggies. Otherwise this is my new go to warm my belly quick dinner choice.

It's a good veggie-heavy and healthy chili.  I think the mushrooms are key here - not necessarily for flavor, but for the meaty texture and nutrition.  My main criticism is that I don't understand why the recipe calls for whole peeled tomatoes - next time I will definitely use a 28 oz. can of crushed tomatoes instead.  I will also probably simmer for 30-40 minutes, since the carrots were not as tender as I prefer.

This is one of our favorite recipes that we make frequently in the winter. We double the spices, use three kinds of canned beans (kidney, black, and garbanzo), and sometimes add textured vegetable protein for a little more texture. The red wine does make a difference in the flavor and we prefer it in the mix. With a sprinkling of cheddar cheese and avocado at the end. . .delicious!

I made this for a chili cook-off, and no one noticed there was no meat in it. All positive comments! I didn't win, but everyone loved it, so that's  a win in my book! No alterations, followed the recipe exactly.

This chili has been a staple in our house since the first time we tried the recipe.  It's great as written but also very forgiving allowing you to use what you have on hand.  Many of the variations we use include: mixing kidney beans with the black beans, using different types of bell peppers, more or less of any veggie based on taste and what we have on hand, canned mushrooms in a pinch, a whole can of tomato paste (because what are you going to do with half a can?) a little extra wine, always use diced tomatoes instead of whole and started using chicken broth instead of water.  To keep it vegan you can use  "Not So Chick'n" bouillon.   Economical, healthy, freezes great!

Made this for NY day, and used 1 can black beans (drained!) and about a cup or so of black-eyed peas, to meet my southern tradition for New Year's.   I think it's delicious, and very filling, but I found it to be too spicy, and I even cut down on some of the spices.  I only used 1 tsp of cumin, not a tablespoon, and didn't have chili powder on hand so used a tsp. of paprika and tsp. of cayenne pepper instead.  I only used a tsp. of salt, and one cup of water, because I like really chunky chili, not "soup" chili, plus the extra sodium is not needed!  The consistency was perfect.  Added a Tsp. of cocoa powder.  Next time, I will just leave out the hot sauce to see if that fixes the slightly "too spicy" taste.  I know some people really love spicy though!  I also used red pepper, instead of green, as I don't care for green peppers. I garnished with some fresh sliced avocado and non-fat plain yogurt.  Overall this is a great recipe and I will enjoy tweaking it.

Best vegetarian chili I've ever found. Very hearty and full of flavour. If you're new to vegetarian foods then I would try adding some meatless ground round into it. Not necessary for flavor, but it adds a good meat-texture.

Very good - a little time consuming to chop the veggies but it was worth it. I didn't have mushrooms so left that out. I cut the garlic back a bit - glad i did. I did not saute any of the veggies - just threw everything in my crockpot on low for several hours. Turned out perfect. I also just used the whole can of tomato paste, a part of a can of pizza sauce and then a quart of home-canned tomatoes. Will make again - will definitely use mushrooms next time. :)

I made this recipe as written, except I let it simmer for about 1 1/2. Not only is this the best veggie chili recipe I have ever made, it is one of the best chili recipes period! A hearty, excellent, filling chili. It is an easy recipe and it will become a staple soup in my kitchen.

This is the best vegetarian chili ever!  I may have used a tad more wine & added the tsp of cocoa powder but otherwise, followed recipe.  Topped with a dollop of sour cream & sprinkle of parm.  Yummo!

Very good! Followed the recipe and didn't drain the beans, and used two cans of beans - one can red kidney beans and one can black beans - which was slightly more than 3 cups. Also used one 14 oz can of diced tomatoes and one 14 oz can of crushed to use up what I had on hand. Plus, I did everything in the Instant Pot® using the Sauté function for the first step, and the Bean/Chili function for the rest. That left a little more liquid than stove top, but we didn't care, it was so full of flavour. Great meatless recipe!

This is my new favorite  veggie chili.  I used all the ingredients listed.  However, I used less olive oil, and cut the spices since I can't  tolerate spicy foods. I did use the suggested amounts for oregano and basil and I used the full can of tomato paste.  Instead of 3 cups of black beans, I used 2 cans of rinsed black beans and 1 can of  rinsed northern beans. I like the addition of the white beans because it adds some color contrast to an otherwise dark and rather monochrome looking dish. I only buy diced canned tomatoes so that is what I used. The only change I will make next time is to at least double the mushrooms.  I did make it the day before serving, as I usually do with chilis, so the flavors meld nicely. I am so happy I found this recipe!  Delicious and nutritious!

Even the meat eaters LOVE this recipe.  Eliminated the mushrooms and added more squash.  Also eliminated the water because it was way too runny the first time I made it.  I put in the juice from the beans but no other fluids.  If you feel the recipe is too spicy add brown sugar.  It is really delicious that way.

Made the recipe as written except for the mushrooms (due to a strong dislike of them) and rinsing the black beans (personal preference).  The flavor was really good.  Next time I will follow suggestions from other reviewers and sub 2 cups of zucchini for mushrooms.

I used a mixture of  beans- white kidney beans, red kidney beans and black beans. I used a mixture of chili powder, chipottle chili powder and cayenne pepper as well as the other spices. it was very colorful and tasted really good.  My husband said it was the best veggie chili yet.

This is a great vegetarian chili.  The only thing I recommend is only using about half the water (use all the wine ;  )   )  That way the chili won't be too thin. You can always add more water. You can't take it out.

Takes a bit of work to get all the veggies chopped, but it makes an amazing meal! I usually serve it with cheese, sour cream and avocado on top with Premium saltine crackers or cornbread (or both!) on the side. Healthy and delicious dish!

So good over cornbread topped with avocado, sour cream & cheddar! We didn't have wine, so I used a tablespoon of baking chocolate. Great as a leftover days later.

I followed recipe to a T, but did a test taste before serving and found it to be somewhat bland.  I added two tsp of Better than Bouillon and some smoked paprika.  I cooked it a bit longer, and ladled it up with a bit of sour cream and cheddar cheese.  It was then pretty tasty.

This chili is so good, you don't even miss the meat. It's the only vegetarian dish, in fact, that my boyfriend ever specifically requests and he's named this the second best chili he's ever tried (losing only to his brother's famous - and secret - meat-heavy chili).

The only things I do differently was omit the celery (I'm not a fan of celery) and add a can of kidney beans. I've also tried it with dark beer instead of wine and it's just as good.

This was delicious!
I made this recipe with what I had on hand, and I am sure it would have been just as good has I followed the recipe exactly.  I used 1/2 the oil it called for; a yellow bell pepper instead of green; didn't add the red wine; two 14 oz. cans of diced tomatoes instead of the 28 oz. whole; added 1/2 tsp. of red pepper flakes instead of the hot sauce; added an extra 1/4 tsp. sea salt. I used two cans of black beans (drained and rinsed) and it was very close to 3 cups. Everything else was the same.  It was a thinner chili, so I simmered it for 45 minutes to reduce the liquid. We dipped corn tortilla chips in it and it was fabulous!
Made a second time and we decided the celery is not needed.  I would also like to try it without the tomato paste next time. I added some rice and ground beef and it was fabulous!

As someone with both vegetarian and omnivorous housemates, I'm always on the lookout for hearty, but meatless recipes that the whole household can enjoy. This fit the bill perfectly. I made it according to the recipe, and indeed no one missed the meat (one of the meat-eaters even went back for seconds). It's a filling, spicy chili that's perfect for warming up on cold days. You can also make it the night before and store in the fridge, then toss it back into the pot and rewarm it when ready to eat.

I recently cooked for a community kitchen and used this recipe for the vegetarian main-dish.  It was an absolute hit served with "homesteader cornbread".  However, I was sure to cook this one time before I served it to a large group of people.  I found that I needed to decrease the chili powder, add a tsp of sweet paprika and ~2 tsp of sugar, and double the basil and oregano to suit my tastes. With those minor changes, this recipe is absolutely phenomenal.  Thank you so much for sharing!

This is truly amazing!! You honestly do not miss or even realize there is no meat! Great as written but I used vegetable broth in place of water. No tomato paste. Added extra chili powder and cumin for my taste. Chopoed up one jalapeño. Used kidney, pinto and black beans. Also used red and green pepper. Threw everything in crockpot all at once.

YES YES YES!!!! I am a meat eater and I did NOT miss the meat at all. This recipe ROCKS! Thank you for sharing. It will definitely go into my collection of recipes that will be repeated! I followed the recipe as written (except I used portobella mushrooms). This was so good.

The only 2 changes I made was using 2 cans of roasted diced tomatoes and no wine since I didn't have any. I made it for a pot-luck at work and everyone loved it! I have ingrediants in fridge again and will be adding spinach and 3 cans of different kinds of beans.

Amazingly delicious!  Throwing out my old chile recipes.  This one is better.  I used vegetable broth instead of water and served it over rice, topped with chopped red onion and shredded sharp cheddar cheese.

I made this yesterday, it turned out absolutely fantastic!  I used pinto beans and chick peas from dried beans instead of black beans, also used fresh basil and tomatoes from my garden.  I left out the carrots and celery, but pretty much everything else the same.  Served it with homemade corn bread made with pecans and fresh cranberries.  Will definitely be making this again!  oh, and I skipped the sauteing step, just added everything at once and cooked for about 1-1/2 hours till it thickened up nicely.

beautiful dish, I tweaked some of the ingredients for consistency and to make the chili a little thicker. When my teenagers ask for thirds I call that a winning dish!

woohoo!!! homerun! my family has just started the vegetarian journey and when I heard "you know what would be really good? chili!" I came here, selected this recipe and wow, it is fabulous!!! followed along pretty well-added TVP rehydrated in beef broth and used beef broth instead of water (only 1 cup instead of 2), skipped the wine and rinsed my beans. I also used one can of tomato sauce (15 oz) instead of the whole tomatoes. IT SMELLS AWESOME AND TASTES EVEN BETTER!!! so thankful for good food that's really, really good for our bodies! it's been almost a month and I DON'T MISS MEAT AT ALL!!!

AWESOME FOR LARGE CROWDS!  I made this recipe for 40 servings (so 5x the original recipe).  Instead of fresh green peppers, onions, carrots, celery - I used prechopped/frozen bags of green peppers and mirepoix mix (nine 10oz. bags total).  This was a good idea!  I did use fresh mushrooms.  I sauteed the veggies in a large electric skillet (in batches) with a generous amount olive oil and garlic.  I used three 6-quart crockpots to divvy the sauteed veggies and canned tomatoes/beans/wine.  The spices were mixed all together in a glass pint jar.  I divvyed the mixed spices between the three crockpots.  Cooked over night and it turned out great!  It was a huge hit (made for contestants at a ski race) and many came back for 2nds and 3rds!

Fantastic recipe, just what I was looking for.  Thick, rich, complex.  My kids devoured it, then were shocked to learn it was meatless.  I wasn't extremely precise with the veggies, so probably went heavy on mushrooms, onions, carrots, celery.  Will make this one again!

Loved this recipe.  Didn't use mushrooms but added red kidney beans and white beans.  Even my husband, who usually only likes chili with meat in it, said he'd like to have this again.

I made this for dinner tonight and it is the best chili I've ever had! I have been interested in pursuing a vegan lifestyle and thought this would be a great start to having a meatless version of a popular food. I left out mushrooms since I don't like them and I increased the celery to 1 cup. I didn't have red wine so that was left out as well.  The spices were perfect and you don't miss the meat at all. In fact this beats out any traditional meat chili that I've ever had! And my kids really loved it and that was a surprise.

I don't write reviews... but this is worth it! This recipe was AMAZING!! I added zucchini, kidney beans and a teaspoon of cocoa powder and let me tell you this was a HIT! My husband doesn't eat veggies, yet said this was the BEST chili he has EVER had! Can't wait to make it again. I had no problem eating this everyday (twice) until it was gone. Can't wait to enter it into a chili contest!!!

This is excellent, Chili and perfectly spiced. I served it at a ski weekend and it went over amazingly. I added fresh tomatoes I was keen to get rid of. You could add any vegetables.

I made this for a party and it’s was a hit.  I added 1/3 cup of quinoa for protein and thickness, increased the chili powder and used a whole can of tomato paste, again to thicken.   The mushrooms give it a nice texture, like a meat substitute.   It’s good over rice.   This will become a staple in my house!

This was the best soup that I have ever made! I just put it all in the crock pot, and it was SUPERB! I don’t even like vegetables that much, so I didn’t think I would like it at all. WRONG! I may never make regular chili again.

I definitely added more salt. About a tablespoon total. It’s a large pot of chili so it isn’t as much as it looks. I liked it over all but I felt like it was missing something. I added corn and if I were to make it again I’ll add cubes potatoes and probably leave out the green peppers or up the spice (maybe a tablespoon of tobasco)

Best chili -- meat or meatless -- ever!  Wonderful combination of flavors.  Easy.  Freezes well.  Ingredient changes/additions, though certainly not necessary, are customizable according to your personal tastes  or based on what's in your pantry.   Enjoy!

This was easy to make, didn't take a ton of time and was delicious for a chili without meat!  I didn't have mushrooms so I skipped those.  I also used two full cans of black beans which is about 4 cups in total.  I skipped the water as well because I thought there was enough liquid in the pot and I was right.  I also like things on the spicier side so I added some jalapeno and red chili powder.  Will definitely make again.

omg this is so yummy. I omitted the mushrooms since my guys won't eat them. I used half black beans/half red beans, the rest as written. I too did not miss the meat. A keeper for sure! Also, I threw it all in the crock pot instead of  the stove top.

The best vegetarian chili recipe I have found over the years. You can sub in other vegetables and it’s still great. I do suggest cooking the onion celery portion a bit longer, but I’m not sure if this is personal preference because I can’t stand crispy onions. I also double the simmer time. The wine is crucial. Easy to freeze and warm up for

Very tasty.  Satisfied both meat and non meat eaters.
Just had to remove the lid to allow the sauce to reduce and thicken up.
Served with salad and garlic bread.

This is my “go to” recipe for chili. It can be made as is...or put your own spin on it. Either way, it’ll be great! I was short on black beans, so I added pinto beans and corn. YUM!

Delicious staple in our house. We like to use broth instead of water, and we double the tomato paste. We also let it simmer for 40mins or longer to reduce liquid.

Outstanding!!!! I went heavy on the mushrooms,  and it was so good! Just a little kick to it.
I topped it off with some cheddar cheese.  
Thank you for sharing

I'll make it again. My vegetarian family members loved it. It does make a lot of chili using this recipe. I used just two cans of beans. Red and pinto. A very mild tasty dish.

This was really good. I like a soupier chili. I wish I could give 4.5 stars because the only thing I didn't like about this recipe was the cooking time/specificity of vegetable cut/size. My vegetables came out a bit firm for a chili, which I don't mind but my family doesn't like. I cut my veggies pretty small, but guess smaller would have been better.  The only change I made was to omit the mushrooms, since they are not everyone's favorite in my household. I am glad I did because I really dislike under-cooked mushrooms.

Very happy with this recipe! It is quite hearty and delicious. I added 2 bird's eye chilis chopped up for some added spice. I will definitely be making this again.

This recipe is a keeper for my collection. Very hearty and packed full of vegetables. A few adjustments I made and will keep are, I had fresh garlic on hand so I used 2 cloves and instead of whole peeled tomatoes, I used one can of diced tomatoes.  As suggested by another user, I subbed the red wine for vegetable broth, and even added a little extra because I like a good amount of liquid. The recipe calls for sliced mushrooms, but next time I would cut them into smaller pieces. I will also start by sauteing the carrots first so they can get extra time before I throw in the rest of the vegetables because they certainly to firm. Can't wait to make this again!

Great hearty recipe! I always like a hint of sweet to my chili’s so I did add a tablespoon of real maple syrup and a teaspoon of raw honey with a dash of cinnamon, turmeric, and ginger. Delicious!!! The recipe as stated is delicious and if you want to add a hint of sweetness add these few items, either way, both are delicious!!

It was really good and I'm not even the vegetarian in the house.  I will either chop up the tomatoes or use diced next time.  I also added some extra chili powder and cumin.
Put it over rice and of course crumble up some cornbread in it and thank me later. 
 I am stuffed from a veggie dish.....never thought I would say that.

Really excellent chilli. Everyone loved it. I made only a few changes. I used black beans and red beans. I was skeptical about not rinsing the beans 1st but followed the recipe and it was great. I also added 1 bag of frozen corn. I wanted more variety then just black beans. I followed the amount of spice the recipe called for and it was perfect (definitely had a kick but wasn’t too much). I also used diced tomatoes instead of the whole pealed tomatoes. I let everyone add their own  shredded cheddar  and sour cream. Will definitely make again.

This was our first time having vegetarian chili and it was a great place to start. Spicy,hearty, and easy to make.
I did leave out the mushrooms in exchange for 2 golden potatoes cubed (my husband "won't even" with the mushrooms).
It was wonderful. Thank you for the recipe.

My first time making a vegetarian chili as I am attempting to gradually cut meat out of my diet.  It was delicious and I did not miss the meat.  I did add a little can of tomato paste as the sauce seemed runny and I added 4 bay leaves as I always do to chili.  Also added 1/2 cup of whole wheat berries as another review suggested and substituted coffee for the wine as I did not have wine.  Not too spicy, I will add a bit more next time as I like it hot.  And so filling!

This is fantastic! I used white wine instead of red, omitted the cumin because husband does not like it and used white, navy and kidney beans instead of black because they have less calories. I also used a yellow pepper and canned diced beans.  I put a little less chilli powder than called for.We will make this again and again. Thank you for the recipe!

I used a bit more chili powder, garlic & Tobasco sause than called for plus added corn. I also use flour as a thickener. Side w/organic blue corn chips.

I have actually added beef on one occasion with good results.

This was very good.  The only thing I did different was use 1 can black beans and 1 can chili beans, and omitted the hot sauce and also omitted the wine because I don't consume alcohol.  Will definitely make this again when I want to make something my vegetarian daughter will eat.  I also added a couple handfuls of elbow macaroni (cooked) just because that is the way I have always made my chili.  Very good with some shredded Sharp cheese sprinkled on top.

We cooked it using a crock pot, and just cooked on high for about 7 hours (and didn't even soak the beans!). This was a very good recipe and it even smelled like a meaty chili. We don't like mushrooms, so for a meaty substitute we just put in a half cup of brown rice (but remember to add extra water for the brown rice). It has a similar flavor to other vegetarian chili recipes on this site, but it's definitely a keeper.

I make this about once a month. I have varied ingredients based on what was in my pantry but it never disappoints.  I used to make chili in the slow cooker but this tastes like it's been simmering all day.

great recipe! Only small changes were made - white cooking wine instead of red, no beans on hand so I left them out ( however I would alternate for kidney) - also I shredded the carrots as opposed to chopping.  yum!

I made this chili recipe for dinner recently and it was very flavorful. My daughter and husband also enjoyed it and the leftovers were eaten up the following day. I will definitely make this again. Note that the only changes that I made was that I substituted the wine with grape juice, and I pureed the whole tomatoes in the blender.

I really enjoyed it! I made several changes that were mentioned in the comments. Used a medley of beans, (Kidney, Garbanzo, Black) Added a whole package of fresh basil, tripled the garlic (I'm a fiend), chili flakes, and added a package of spicy veggie tofu.  It was a major hit. No one could tell it was vegetarian chili. I would probably add more celery, spicy tofu and mushrooms next time. Mushrooms turned out to be the best part. My boyfriend made the same chili but added meat and followed it to a T however he said it turned out super bland so I would definitely make the substitutions.  Serve with avocado and corn bread!

This was delicious and easy to make. I made this in the crockpot with dried beans. I let them soak over night and added them "raw" into the pot with the rest of the ingredients. I also used diced tomatoes because that's what I had. It cooked on high for 6 hours and was perfection! I didn't tell my husband it was vegetarian and he didn't miss the meat ?? my two year old asked for seconds so I would consider this a success. I topped with guacamole (I didn't have any ripe avocados), sour cream and a jalapeño cheese.

Used baby bella mushrooms, also added a small can of Rotelle tomatoes in addition to the 28 oz can crushed tomatoes, one can black beans, one can red beans in chilli sauce.  Substituted mixed peppers rather than just green.  Did not need the Tabasco with these additions/substitutions.  Hard to believe this was vegetarian. Served with tortilla chips, shredded cheese, Greek yogurt. Delicious!!

I am obsessed with this chili.  It is so good.  I add a little cocoa as suggested and prefer it with diced tomatoes.  I cook the veggies on the stove top as directed and then cook it all together in the crock pot on low for several hours.  It is always delicious!!!

Really the most perfect recipe! I add plant-based protein for that ground meat texture and reduced the 2 cups of water to 1.

This recipe is great.

I used crushed tomatoes instead of  whole.
I did not add water as I wanted the chile thicker
Finally I started the carrots abut 5-10 mins earlier than all the other veggies because they need more time to soften up.

I made this with black, kidney and pinto beans rather than all black beans.

I exchanged the water for reduced sodium vegetable broth.

I added 4 fire roasted jalapenos (no seeds), 1 teaspoon of crushed toasted Coriander seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon of crushed toasted cumin seeds.  I added all the other ingredients the recipe called for, and I am sure I over measured on the spices. 

I made two pots, one with basic white mushrooms and the other with crimini mushrooms (baby bellas).  I found the crimini mushrooms to be much tastiter.

I will definitely make this recipe again.

Was out of mushrooms and carrots. Skipped the mushrooms and used 1/2 cup veggies from a bag of pre-cut "sunrise slaw" which has carrots and more. All other ingredients were the same except I made only 1/3 of the recipe. Used water as listed instead of the chicken broth suggestion. It was delicious. Might have added extra spices because I love a lot of spice and I didn't use a measuring spoon (I never do). Loved this recipe, and will make it again :)

This is the best chili I have ever had, a little spicy for some but I like it that way.  Will make this from now on but will make a batch for those who can't take the heat.

I  was concerned about the oregano, red wine and basil in a chili recipe.  It sounded like an Italian bean soup.  I just couldn't"t accept the Basil so I left it out.  I also used a poblano pepper instead of a green bell pepper and one can of black and one can of red beans.  As another reviewer suggested, I replaced half of the mushrooms with vegetarian burger crumbles.  Well..it looks like I changed this pretty much from the original,  but this recipe lends itself to use as a base recipe to take liberties with.

Super recipe! really delicious flavour and amenable to various subs -- e.g., I used red instead of green bell pepper, a mix of garbanzo and black beans, chipotle chili powder, sriracha instead of Tabasco, and coffee instead of wine. So so yummy. Leftovers were great reheated and topped with a fried egg and cheese. Next time I might try this in the slow cooker -- seems to taste even better with a longer simmering time.

Really good. Made it for a vegetarian friend and we both loved it. Used diced tomatoes and didn't have red wine (sadly). Amount of Tabasco was just right as I like chili medium spicy. I would definitely recommend including the mushrooms as they really make it hearty and "meaty". Will make again!

We all loved this recipe it was delicious. The only changes I made was I used one can of back beans and one can of dark red kidney beans, I also did not add the water as it would have made it like soup. Will definitely make this again.

Great flavor and really hardy. Quick and easy to make, definitely a winner as far a vegetarian chilli is concerned. I'm thinking of cubing up an eggplant next time to give it a chunkier texture.

Just made this for a halloween get together. Everyone raved about it! Even the meat eaters! Skipped the mushrooms, used all black beans and used 2 cups sauce vs paste and water. Also added some fresh hot peppers. Was even better after it sat for 2 days. Excellent and hearty!

My 3 and 6 year old will eat this up and if it's a little too spicy put on a little sour cream and throw in some fishy crackers.   My husband goes back for seconds and thirds and he swore he would never like veggie chili.   Love this recipe exactly as it is.

OMG! This chili is fantastic! I usually include meat, but didn't miss it in the least. I swapped some frozen corn for the mushrooms. I also used pinto beans, red kidney beans and the black beans. The chili is very colorful and oh, so tasty!

This is the chili recipe of my dreams. I found this recipe when trying to decide what to make for vegetarian friends for dinner. They ended up not coming, and my carnivorous husband and I ate almost all of this ourselves! I skipped the mushrooms, 'cause I'm not a fungi fan. I also used maybe a tablespoon of olive oil at the beginning. I didn't add any water. After I sauteed the vegetables in the EVOO, I threw everything in the crockpot and left it alone. My husband actually forgot this was meatless. This is my go-to chili recipe from now on!

This is a  very good chili with lots of of yummies veggies.  I reduced the water to one cup, left out the mushrooms due to personal preference and added a can of chili  beans to compensate.  Thanks for sharing your recipe, sanzoe

I made this for a Super Bowl party and it was a big hit, even amongst meat lovers!  Next time I make it, I think I will break the whole tomatoes up a little bit.  Some of the chunks were too large to eat in a bite.

Loved it! Added extra celery and carrots in place of mushrooms, and used two 28oz cans of crushed tomatoes in place of whole tomatoes, tomato paste and water since I had the crushed tomatoes. Also added 2tsp. cocoa as others suggested. Will make again - my husband was a big fan, too :)

This was a very flavourful chili! I served it at a community lunch program to rave reviews.  One downside, I found it to be very thin so I added cornstarch to thicken, and increased to spices to compensate for that.

Great recipe.  I never thought I would try something different from my standard chili recipe I've been using for years, but when I found this one, I was happily surprised.  I am not a big fan of tomato chunks, so I used one can of stewed tomatoes and one can of tomato sauce.  I also added an extra can of chili beans, and chopped up a couple jalapeno peppers.  The chili is so hearty, my husband doesn't even miss the meat! As others have said, I drained the liquid from the beans before adding them.  I have made this twice in 2 weeks!

Great. I've been looking for a good standard vegetarian chili and this will do me fine. I only made few alterations: less water (1 cup), less oil (3T), more celery (3 sticks), mixed the beans (a 14oz can each of black, pinto & kidney) and added one Thai green chili. Other than that I think it was as writ. I did use the bean liquid, which I think helps with the thickening. The chili powder I was using was quite powerful, so this came out plenty hot for me, but I'm about a 3/10 on the hotness ladder so chili-heads could use a bit more.

I loved this!! If you want make the texture a little thicker, drain the black beans and it's amazingly like chili. My whole family (even those who aren't vegetarian) loved this. I'll definitely be making it again.

Awesome chili recipe!  I didn't have mushrooms so I used extra carrots, red, yellow, and green peppers.  I also used both red and black beans.  I love the Boil Maker chili recipe with the meat, but you will not miss the meat in this recipe.  It was delicious!

This is my go-to recipe, I finally decided to review it.  It is awesome.  My only comments/changes...I use bella mushrooms, I use fresh tomatoes instead of canned (I take off the skins and throw them in my blender).  I substitute one can of black beans & one can of kidney beans for the 3 cups(because its easier). I don't add wine, pepper sauce or the water (we like thick chili that can be scooped on a chip).   My prep time seems to be a lot longer than 30 minutes with chopping up the vegetables so a suggestion would be to chop them up, add the spices and put everything in a big bowl ahead of time (keeping the tomatoes separate, of course).  Then when your ready to cook, it's all prepared.  So yummy!!

I made it for a small (very) un-snobby art opening - I was surprised how good it was; the canned potatoes thickened the it and it really is more than the sum of its parts.

Great Chili. My Meat eating parents loved it, as did I. I used sliced portabella mushrooms instead of the sliced white, doubled the garlic and chili powder, added 1 tbs of dark honey, and a small sqaure of hershey's chocolate. Garnished with green onions, sour cream and tortilla chips...AWESOME!!!!! As A vegetarian, i have been looking for a hearty chili recipe and this exceeded my expectations....not to mention it is EASY!!

This came out amazing! Even my husband liked it and he's not keen on chili that doesn't involve meat.  I will make this again and again.

Loved this! I did not add the hot pepper sauce but it was great anyway.  We don't eat spicy food regularly so it was great for us without it.  I will certainly make this again.  The flavor was full and it felt like a hearty meal even without meat.

I just made it for the second time, and I added jalapenos. Taking this to a chili cook off tomorrow, we shall see how those "meat-eaters" react. Not expecting to win, but this chili is sooo amazing (I followed the recipe exactly, well, minus the jalapenos)DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!

I've tried a lot of veggie chili recipes and this was just ok. The pot I used wasn't large enough to hold the third can of beans so I added less water. It was better the next day but not good enough to make again.

I discovered this recipe about a year ago and have made it many times..   It is foolproof! This is my "go to" meal when I do not know what to make.  It also freezes very well.  The previous version did not have the added water in it, and I make it without the added water.  I add red kidney beans & Chick peas (with their liquids)and recently cut-up broccoli florets - tastes great!    My sister makes it for her sons' families.  Has anyone tried this in a slow cooker (after sauteeing)??  A BIG THANKS!

Very tasty! Omitted the 2 cups water to yield a thicker chili. Also substituted 2 cans petite diced tomatoes for the large can of peeled tomatoes. Even my mushroom-hating husband loved it!

Delicious. I had no tomato paste or wine. Like one reviewer I  added  1/4 cup coffee in place of the wine, and used about a can of tomato sauce.I added 2 beef bouillon cubes for some flavor (since we are not strict vegetarians) All seasonings are as is in the recipe. I think it tastes delicious and you would never know it was a vegetarian version with all the yummy beans and veggies. Has a nice kick, but not overbearing. Going to make some cornbread to go with it.

Really liked this recipe. It's tough to cook for me (non-vegetarian) and my wife (vegetarian), but this is one of those recipes we both like. Plus, it's hearty for a cold day and actually does taste like the kind of chili you would get in a pub.

Used diced tomatoes rather than whole and beef broth rather than wine. Fantastic. Doubled and froze half, still had plenty for weekday lunches. Next time I'll add some cocoa and maybe coffee in place of the wine.

This was delicious!!! I omitted the mushrooms but other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The only thing I may change is adding a little bit of diced tomatoes in addition to the whole tomatoes.

Just made this tonight in my brand new dutch oven. I did not have canned black beans on hand so I did a half and half mix using dried black and red beans that I soaked overnight. Other than the bean substitution I followed the recipe to a tee and it came out fantastic! I made this ahead of time for the big Vikings playoff game on Saturday so hoping that, like most chili, this tastes even better in 2 days. Will DEFINITELY make again.

I did change the beans....I used a can each of light kidney, pinto, and black bean instead of all black beans and the combination was really good. I also used petite diced tomatoes and baby bella mushrooms. I'll never eat chili with meat in it again!

I made this for a work potluck and again for the family, I dropped the mushrooms and added red kidney beans and corn. I also used a couple packs of taco seasoning. Also, I'm pretty sure you can use half the water it calls for.

Their opinions were that it was so good it didn't even need meat. Some didn't even realize there wasn't any. And this is men we're talking about.

Made this recipe for my vegetarian family and it was a thumbs up! I added zuchini, red peppers and used some tomato sauce from the heirloom tomatoes in my garden. It was perfect with just black beans and all the veggies.

Wow! This is a great recipie. I was looking for a diet friendly soup/stew. I cut way back on oil-sauteed everything in 1 TBSP of olive oil and added a small zucchini. Otherwise, followed the recipie exactly. I served it with a little shredded cheese and crushed tortilla chips-Fantastic and low-cal!

Yum! I can't speak to the proportions as I didn't really pay attention to them, but this combination of ingredients makes a hearty chili. Substituted a bouillon cube for the salt and threw in some leftover quinoa just because but it definitely wasn't necessary. Will make again.
