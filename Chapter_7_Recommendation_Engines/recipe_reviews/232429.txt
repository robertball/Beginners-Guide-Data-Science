Yum!  My kids made this as the appetizer for our Mother's Day dinner.  We enjoy poppers made on the grill so the boys chose to grill the peppers for a few minutes to give them that cooked and roasted flavor.  Once cooled they removed the skins and seeds and chopped 'em up.  We followed the recipe exactly other than that step.  Everyone's first remark was "Wow" followed by "This is great (delicious, awesome, fantastic,) and some other comments that were garbled by mouths being full. :)  One of the other boys commented that he was glad we planted Jalapenos in the garden because we're gonna need 'em to make more of this dip. Our peppers were very hot - possibly more so because of the grilling- but it was perfect for our taste.  Just wonderful.  Thanks, Cat, for sharing your recipe! **Update** It was requested I make this for an afternoon by the pool. I had a container (8 oz) of sour cream that needed using up so I added it to the ingredients.  The result was a creamier dip and easier to scoop without breaking the chips.  I plan on making part of the ingredients as it was enjoyed so much.

I made two small changes--I used a good amount of homemade roasted sweet onion and one four ounce can of diced mild green chilies instead of the fresh diced jalapeno peppers. (My apologies to the recipe submitter, I honestly don't think she would mind). My family INHALED this dip. In fifteen minutes. Seriously. They ate the whole serving bowl full. Everyone adored it.

All I have to say is YUM! I made this for #1 Son's Birthday (keeping in the theme of favorite dishes of Sons) and it was completely wiped out in a very short time. I put in only 5 Jalapenos because the ones I purchased were big. However, next time I will put in 7 or 8 and work my way up to 10. It was so tasty and not hot at all. Just good! The bacon and onions and garlic only add to this super delicious dip. I already know I'll be making this again and again. Thank you Cathill for creating such a wonderful and EASY dish that will be on the DECKER menu from now on for our family gatherings.

I'm the submitter of this recipe and AR fixed the first oops with the directions but I have noticed some having difficulty with the cook & prep time, the original recipe has differing times from what AR posted in the submitted recipe.  Not creamy enough or all you taste is bacon & cream cheese, know what you mean.  This is best hot for sure.  And I had no idea cream cheese and jalapenos varied so widely in flavor, texture or heat so that could certainly affect the outcome of this recipe for you.

I think I'm the only person I know who has never had jalapeño poppers. They never appealed to me as I was intimidated by putting a hot pepper in my mouth. (weird, I know).  This dip is a fantastic alternative to that. I used eight jalapenos as my were a medium size. It was just the right amount of spiciness. I was going to increase the bacon because my family loves bacon. I didn't and I'm glad I stuck to the recipe because it was just the right amount. This will be great for football season. Thanks Cat!

Recipe Group Selection:  27, April 2013 ~ I am late in making the group selection, but soooo glad I finally got it made.  Cat-Hill, your recipe is absolutely wonderful and so much easier to make than stuffed poppers.  I made a half batch to take in to school.  Five of us wasted no time polishing off the dip and all four of them wanted the recipe.  I let the mini-chopper take care of jalapeños for me.  It did a great job and I didn’t have to worry about the oils from the peppers.  I baked for 30 minutes in the toaster oven and then reheated it in the microwave when we enjoyed it with our lunch.  I added fresh diced tomatoes on top before serving with tortilla chips.  Thanks for sharing a winner, Cat-Hill.

This is so flavorful!  It is rich and creamy and slightly spicy.  Absolutely decadent, but actually rather figure friendly.  Thanks, Cat, this was worth waiting for!

DELICIOUS! This is great with crackers or nachos and was a huge hit with everyone. I eyeballed the peppers, then added more:) I chopped the bacon, fried it crisp, drained and used.  I divided the dish, made 1/2 as is and added some chopped chipotle peppers with adobo(?) sauce, I had some roasted jalapeno peppers, so I added them in as well.  Both dishes were cleaned in no time. Some people used it as a veggie dip for carrots, broccoli and cauliflower. KEEPER, thanks Cat. Quicker and less fuss than stuffing and roasting the peppers.

I made this for a BBQ last night and people simply couldn't get enough of it. I followed the recipe exactly (although using full fat cheddar cheese) - and it was perfect - but will make it without the bread crumbs next time because I have a number of gluten-free friends (and don't think I'll sacrifice any flavor by doing so). I brought tortilla chips to dip, but one party-goer even slathered it on his hot dog as a topping. He said it was delicious that way.

Just a couple cooking notes: It took me a bit longer to bake it (maybe closer to 30 minutes) and using my stand mixer was a life-saver. It's really, really thick.

Made for Recipe Group. Loved it! I erred on the side of spicy and didn't put all the jalapenos in, then regretted it and added some more! Tasty!! Thanks Cat for the recipe!

made this last night,I just love it. I did use a full pound od bacon, I didn't want to put the other few pieces in the freezer. We really like jalapeno poppers and this is just as easy to make. I do have some left over, but plan on putting it on my pizza tonight.
I will be making this at least once a week, it reheats very well. Thank you so much for sharing this great recipe.

This is so wonderfully flavorful! I made it for Memorial Day Picnic and it was gone very quickly! I found it to be less labor intensive than making the actual poppers and the taste was moderately spicy and so delicious! Thanks so much, Cat Hill for sharing as we will be making this a lot!

YUMMYLICIOUS - This is really, really good! This was the Cinco de Mayo recipe selection for the AR  Recipe Group.  I veered from the directions in that  I threw everything into my KA food processor and pulsed until completely combined, then placed in my baking dish and baked.  I sprinkled some sweet red and yellow peppers on top after I removed from oven just for appearance.  Thank you Cat Hill for sharing your 5 star recipe!

Made this for recipe group.  My family loved this!  My son was counting down the minutes until it came out of the oven and it was gone in less than 30 minutes.  It had just the perfect amount of kick...not too hot and not too mild.  Will definitely keep this handy for parties.  Thanks for a winner recipe!

OMG, you want to feed a bunch of Hungry young adults Fast?? This comes together in a snap! I made it with shredded mozzarella cheese and actually forgot some of the spices, although I did fry the bacon with chorizo since I was making cowboy beans and used the same mass of cooked bacon for both dishes. The crowd INHALED this recipe!! All I saw the next morning was the bottom of the loaf pan! LOL Thank You Cat !!! Keeper for Sure:):)

I made this for Recipe Group a few weeks ago. I used regular cream cheese. WOW! Very, very good. My son practically inhaled it. I plan to take this to the next pot luck I go to. Thanks for an excellent dip recipe Cat Hill!

One of the best party dips I have made.  The only thing different I did was add some diced chilies I had left from another recipe.  I made this a day in advance and turned out better than cooking it right away.

Made this recipe last night, only change was I made half instead of the full recipe.  We ate it out of the oven on tortilla chips.  I didn't modify anything in the recipe, but I did put ranch dressing on top of it when I put it on the tortilla chips because I like to dip my jalapeno poppers in a ranch dressing.  Very good with the ranch.  My husband used it as a baked potato topper today and it was awesome!  Very versatile dip!

Excellent, excellent dip.  I used fresh breadcrumbs from a stale baguette I had on hand (they were pretty dry) but stuck to the recipe otherwise (a major feat for me, lol!).  Hands down, the best popper dip I've tried.  Thanks, Cat Hill...this one's going into the keeper pile, and I can't wait to make it with my fresh peppers!  Really, any pepper would be good, and I'll try a mixture this summer.

Made this last night, took Shearone's idea and put all in my KA, till combined, I used cream cheese, as i could not find Neufchatel cheese.
The smell as it was baking was wonderful. Everyone loved it, it was gone in no time. Alas, I could not partake in this wonderful smelling dip, but the minute I can find lactose free cream cheese and cheddar cheese, I will make it just for me. Cat Hill thank you for sharing this.

I used cream cheese, turkey bacon and habanero cheese blend as substitutes and it was fabulous!  Got many compliments at the Derby party we attended!  Will definitely make again and maybe even double for larger groups (only filled an 8" square baking dish)!

Made this for Recipe Group...This was AWESOME! I halved the recipe and used regular cream cheese and regular cheddar cheese b/c I already had those on hand. I only had one fresh jalapeno, so I also added in some pickled, diced jalapeno form a jar and that worked out very well. Topped w/ seasoned panko crumbs for a bit more texture. This had a great flavor, and we all enjoyed this VERY much...a definite keeper~YUM! Thanks for sharing. :)

I used 1/2 jalapenos and 1/2 green chilies to make it a bit milder (I'm a spice wimp) and used some toasted rye bread for the bread crumbs because that's what I had on hand. Made this for a potluck and it was GONE in minutes. Will definitely be making this again and again and again. Thanks for this excellent recipe!

Just made this dip for get  together  this evening.  Was great alternative to poppers. I'm not crazy about poppers because of all the breading, so this worked well.  I gave  4 stars because prep did take a bit more time.  I took a couple  short cuts and reduced clean up by just mixing manually with spoon and I used a small can of diced jalapenos.   I also did add about 1/2 cup sour cream for a creamery dip.

This dip is unbelievable! Having said that - the 'prep time' is way off - this entire recipe from start to finish took me almost 2 hours. Between chopping the ingredients, cooking the bacon, and mixing everything together, I had already put an hour of prep time in. 

I didn't change any ingredients, except I used panko instead of bread crumbs for more of a crunch. I sauteed the onion & garlic in a tiny bit of leftover bacon grease (I fried the bacon instead of baking it). I used 9 jalapenos, and left the seeds in 4 of them - if you like it HOT, go with that ratio! Thanks for the great recipe - I'll be making this often!

This made a great dip for our mother's day gathering. I added more onion and garlic and used fresh bread crumbs. I was afraid it might be too spicy so I scaled back the jalepenos to six. To me the spice level was perfect but all the teens who devoured this said it could have been hotter. Next time I won't hold back! Thanks for sharing your recipe Cat Hill :)

Love the concept of this--so much easier than individual poppers!  I didn't know what to do with the onion/garlic--I just mixed in with the panko and bacon.  I have another recipe for poppers from this site that I may like a little more--dry ranch dressing is mixed in--but this technique is great, and it makes a really tasty dish.

This was very good. It wasn't very jalapeno-y for us but that probably has a lot to do with the jalapenos you use. Mine were probably not very hot to start with. Thanks for sharing!

So easy and delicious. I cheat and use pre-cooked bacon. I also microwave the dip instead of baking in the oven. I was afraid that it was going to be really spicy with all those jalapeños but it’s awesome. It’s a crowd favorite!

Absolutely perfect dip. I used crumbled bacon (pre cooked) and jarred diced jalapenos to save time and it was fabulous.

I made this for a small family get together over the summer and it was a huge hit. There was lots of other food, including an actual meal, but hat didn't stop anyone from getting into this pretty seriously. Next time I might add a little seasoning to the cream cheese, but that's mostly personal preference, it's still great as is

So I've been making this for years! It's always a hit! I sub out onions for onion powder and sub garlic salt/powder instead of minced...gives a little more flavor....I buy pickled diced jalapeños in a jar and use them...easier on the eyes....:-) I also add some of the juice from the jar for a little more heat. I add herdez salsa verde in it as well. Gives an extra flavor. I skip the bread crumbs and just add more cheddar cheese on top as well as cheese mixed in and let it bake until it's bubbly and slightly browned! Good recipe!

I made it because I had a bunch of Jalapenos that I needed to do something with.  I used cream cheese & used a half an onion... it was pretty darn good right out of the oven!  Can't wait to try it a day after it sits in the fridge.  It's a labor intensive recipe, especially for someone OCD like me!

Made for a pool party - was gobbled up almost instantly!  Used the food chopper to avoid the pepper oil on my hands, baked for 30 minutes and served with tortilla chips.  Probably used 8 jalapenos from last summer's garden crop, had a nice spice but not overwhelming.

I was really glad to find this recipe since making poppers has never been one of my favorite things to do.  This dip has been declared perfect by my family and friends.  It's now our "go to" dip for game day!  And we never have leftovers!

I was so excited to make this, but for some reason, didnt like it as much as I thought I would.  It must have been me, b/c it was the fist dish gone at the party.  It didn't seem to be as creamy as I wanted.

I don't know....this was just OK for me.  I really wanted to love it - it sounded so good.  Hate to be a downer to all the positive reviews but all I tasted was cream cheese and bacon.  Not worth the effort to make again.  So sorry - thanks for sharing.

Wow! This is a fantastic dip! A great alternative to a popper. My husband and I both like the pre-made kind (I know ; )and occasionally making our own, but this dip has spot on flavor. What a creative dip that I can't wait to share at parties, thanks!

This was pretty good.  I cut the peppers in half, as DBF doesn't have a high spice tolerance, but he said it could use more.

Mods: 5 peppers, no bacon (DBF is vegetarian), added 1/4 cup little sour cream, less cheddar (ran out), no onion, threw two cloves garlic in the food processor along with the peppers and sour cream (didn't fry anything).  (Baked in largest red-topped glass dish.)

Next time, add at least three more peppers and something to chew on.  Maybe lightly fried mushrooms? Large chunks of bell peppers?

Very tasty, stuck to the recipe as stated except I used reg. cream cheese. It did take just a little longer in the oven to heat throughout.  The heat was very nice, just right.  I might add a little sour cream as another stated they did just to make a little creamer and not so thick, but really it isn't necessary.

This is the recipe to use! I've tried others that have mayo, canned chilis, etc., but none of them compare to this one.  It's perfect!  It's fresh, simple, and great flavor.  I took the seeds out of my jalepenos because I was bringing the dish to a party, but it wasn't hot at all, just had a nice flavor.  Next time, I'll leave some of the seeds in and see how that is.

This one was "Gone in 60 Seconds"... I did make a few changes because I didn't have any bacon.  Fried up some hot Louisiana sausage and added 1/2 Smoked Gouda as I halved the cheddar.
