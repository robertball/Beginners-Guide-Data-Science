Wow! Very easy to make and it was a hit with my husband! I baked the salmon for about 15 minutes in the marinade and then removed the salmon from the marinade and baked it another 10 minutes on a baking sheet.

I made the vinaigrette part for a salad.  I didn't use the sun-dried tomatoes, but added some parmesan and a little splenda to taste.  Pretty good for a lo-cal salad dressing.  Next time I think I will omit the lemon juice though, because it was a bit tart (hense the splenda), but then again it wasn't meant to be a salad dressing.  Also, rinse the capers!  They are very briny!

I made this for a dinner party the other night and everyone loved it.  It is incredibly easy to make and flexible - I added more olives and tomatoes

A really good recipe and easy to make.  You can prepare the marinade ahead of time and it makes the evening cooking easy.

The vinegar was over powering. Be careful with the type and amount of vinegar.

Hmmm. I think this marinade is delicious. I think it is better suited, though, for a white fish like Grouper. I would def. make it again on another fish... just not Salmon.. (I buy Wild Caught Sockeye... maybe farm raised would have been better..) Thanks for the recipe. I will try it again.

I think the recipe is totally out of balance. Way too much vinegar and acidic items. I cut the vinegar amount in half and it was still too much.

I loved this!!!! I used red wine vinegar, instead if white wine vinegar and used Olive Garden Italian dressing with the vinegar and lemon juice for the marinade. It turned our exceptionally well! I will make it again.
