I like to add a little bit of rice. But other than that...it is a perfect recipe.

Is this really only for one squash?  I have enough stuffing for at least 3, and the picture shows 8.

I followed this recipe to get the general cooking instructions, but added my own ingredients. I put apple sausage, bell peppers, and onions in as the "stuffing". It was delicious. First time eating this kind of squash and I really liked it. It tasted a little like potato to me. Thanks for getting me started. I have four of these plants in my garden and it's about to start raining squash.

delicious squash recipe, I left the crust on the bread it made up for some extra crunch.
