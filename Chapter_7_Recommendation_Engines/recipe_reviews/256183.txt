1.6.17   I rehydrated the cranberries in hot water for about 5 minutes and toasted the almonds.  This is easy enough for a weeknight dinner, but tasty enough to serve to company.  Nice recipe.

Made it exactly as written,  but I recommend cooking the green beans at least partially before adding them to the butter.

so much yum! i needed a quick veggie dish, had some french beans on hand and made this in about 7 minutes. i loved it! didn't have any orange juice so i skipped it, but the craisins provided just the right tiny bit of sweetness! love the flavor and how fast/easy it was to make!

Since I was making this for a crowd, I adjusted the ingredients as I had at least four times the amount of green beans. I only used about 2/3 of the garlic powder and reduced the butter to  two tablespoons.  It still turned out great and I came home with an empty bowl.  Will definitely make it again.

Green beans are not my husband's favorite veggie - until now! I use defrosted frozen petite beans, followed the recipe exactly, and he loves them! I may have gotten my husband to eat and enjoy roasted Brussel sprouts, but Chef Bill got him to eat and enjoy Green Beans Almandine! Thanks, Chef Bill!

This was fantastic!  The best green beans ever and will be perfect for company. I made enough to have leftovers but my husband finished them all that night. The only change I made was to double the orange juice. Thanks for a keeper

I made it for Thanksgiving, and unfortunately used frozen green beans that were kind of mushy and flavorless. Next time I'll use fresh green beans and steam them until they're almost done before adding them to this recipe. The recipe itself is tasty; it's a lighter and fresher taste than the traditional green bean mushroom soup casserole. The orange juice and cranberries add a nice tart/sweet complement to the dish. I also added a little bacon to the dish which was good, but not necessary. I might add a little corn starch to the liquid in the pan so that the sauce clings to the beans more, sort of a glaze.

Great recipe. I used lime  juice rather than orange juice.  It worked fine.  I think any citrus would work well. I also added some mushrooms and fresh garlic but otherwise followed the recipe.  Served with baked wahoo and mashed potatoes. Itâ€™s easy and yummy.

Made this last night and it was a hit! These beans finished ahead of the rest of the meal, so I popped on a lid and let the cranberries absorb the OJ fully. Delish!
