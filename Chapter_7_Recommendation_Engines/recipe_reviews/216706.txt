Do not use salt, the soups should have enough salt and if you've used a chicken that was well seasoned with salt when boiled or cooked, just omit the extra salt!  I cut my corn tortillas into triangle small pie shapes.  I don't use the reduced-fat soups either, I just use the regular full force soups.  You can use cream of mushroom in this instead of cream of celery.

Really tasty and a keeper recipe in our house.  I had a slight chili powder oops so I added another can of cream of chicken soup, a bit more broth and extra chicken to compensate.  Note to self - be careful with the chili powder.  We're not big salt eaters so this was a little bit salty for us.  Next time I make it I will be sure I use low sodium soups and chicken broth.  Because I hate to debone, I also used the rotisserie chicken breast that's already been deboned from warehouse big box store.  I find this to be a good recipe as is and also a good base for any personal preference you would like to incorporate.

Absolutely delicious!  A hit with everyone at dinner.  I've always been ambivalent about King Ranch Casserole, but the addition of roasted peppers really took it over the top!

This was good. It had just enough heat that my hubby and I liked it but it wasn't too spicy for my 3 year old. I skipped the salt, and substituted the pablanos for Anaheim peppers and jack cheese for Kroger hot pepper cheese. Next time I make this I will also skip the celery, we didn't like the random crunch. Not really a weeknight meal considering all the prep between shredding the chicken and baking the peppers, but if you're looking for a tasty Sunday night dinner, this is it.
