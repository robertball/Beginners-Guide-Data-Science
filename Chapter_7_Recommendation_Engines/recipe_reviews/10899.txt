The cookies turned out good.  They don’t taste like sugar cookies though, more like shortbread.  My chocolate chips started to cool before I got all the cookies dipped and then the cookie would break when I tried to pull it out f the chocolate.  I would suggest adding something like butter to the chocolate chips to thin it out.

This recipe is excellent!  I got a lot of compliments.  I used a cookie press and they looked like store-bought cookies.  Caution if you use a press add flour.  A pastry brush helps apply the chocolate.  This recipe is quick and easy.

Very easy recipe. I decided not to dip them in chocolate because I prefer a less rich cookie. They are perfect with espresso - French, of course :)

These cookies were great! They were quick and easy to make and they look fantastic if you use a cookie press. I did dip them in chocolate, but the only thing was that the actual cookie part was a little lacking in flavor. I would suggest to others to add a bit more vanilla or something when you make them.  But, overall, a great recipe!

I've gotten many compliments on this cookie.  Instead of vanilla extract, I used maple flavoring.  It's been a hit so far.

I typically make these without the chocolate, but I like them both ways. My boyfriend absolutely adores these. He thinks they taste like Nilla wafers, but to be honest, I like these cookies more. Everyone I've made these for has liked them so far. This recipe is a winner as far as I'm concerned.

I enjoyed this recipe and so did my family. I drizzled chocolate instead of dipping, and I created a variation using lemon extract and lemon icing for the drizzle. They were a huge hit! I love this recipe but, I did find that the cookies became spongy after only one night! Any Tips?

I made a few changes that worked out nicely, I added 1/3 cup of white sugar and brown sugar (lightly packed) and used 10 tbsp of butter, I also used 1 cup of flour instead, the cookies spread out more and were a lot more crisp with this ratio, its also a little less chalky.

Tasted good but didn’t spread out very wide. They looked like flat lady fingers but overall were good. Tasted better the first day than the second.

These came out just I had hoped they would! I added a little bit of matcha green tea to mine. You can dip them in chocolate afterward.
