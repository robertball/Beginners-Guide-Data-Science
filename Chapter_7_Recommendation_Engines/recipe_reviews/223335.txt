This was easy, and I could see it being part of a burrito wrap with lettuce, tomatoes, sour cream, and maybe shredded cheese.  As a dip, not bad but a little bland, it needs to be accompanied with additional ingredients to be a WOW.  4 stars for ease and healthfulness!

It is okay, I added a 1/4 tsp of cayenne pepper and 1/2 tbls of Mild Sauce from Taco Bell.  This helped spice up the recipe a bit.

I saw this recipe and immediately made it. Its fabulous!! took me less than 5 min to whip up and it tastes amazing!! instead of lemon juice, I used lime juice since that's all I had on hand. With pretzels, this is a wonderful homework SNACK :3

This made a nice thick dip, but I didn't like the basil in it. Next time I'll try a different spice combination.

The first time I made this I followed the directions to the letter. I tasted it and found it very bland and dry. I decided to take it in a southwestern direction. I added the juice of a lime, more basil, granulated garlic (much more flavorful than garlic powder), a dash of fresh cilantro and cumin. All were added to taste. Once my guests overcame the odd color, they were hooked. It's become a requested dish at parties and potluck dinners. I've used pita bread, pita chips, tortilla chips and crostini to dip. The best pita chips were the best.

It wasn't really like hummus, but it was very good.  I ate it on bread.

This was really great. I made few changes because I didn't have dried basil or garlic powder. Instead I used one clove fresh garlic and about a teaspoon of chili powder. Also, I think this could benefit from a little EVOO to make it creamier. This is delicious!

Editing...a few days later and I threw it out. Just not good. Original ......I tried to make it in a blender. That was a mistake so I moved it to a food processor. That worked better but way too thick. I added about another 2 tsp of lemon juice. I agree with another that I did not care for the basil flavor. I will try another recipe or do like others and completely modify this one. I do think this would be good in a wrap or sandwich. BTW folks, don't give 5 stars to a recipe that you modify with many different ingredients. I can't read all the reviews to figure out how to get the high rating.

This is really good. I use it as the base layer for 7 layer dip instead of retried beans. Great with nacho chips

I make this all the time and love it! It's so inexpensive and easy! My neighbour constantly brings over beans asking for a quick batch. I kick everything up with a little cayenne otherwise as is is delicious!

Four stars because we needed some adjustments. I used 2 tsp garlic powder and added 1/4 tsp cayenne and 1/8 tsp paprika. I also added extra lemon juice and oil to get it to blend more smoothly. My son loved it.

Easy recipe! I would however not use as much basil in it next time.
