I marinated the roast for only 24 hours; I think it might need at least 48. Also, it was not as flavorful as it could have been, (despite using a total of 16 cloves of garlic) so next time I will definitely salt and pepper the roast before cooking it. Otherwise, the marinade made it pretty good!

I belong to a group that meets every 6 weeks for dinner and converstation.  I served this dish.  Everyone loved it from the man who likes things with a lot of flavor(the garlic) to a older woman who tends toward very mild tastes.  The only thing I did differently is that I cooked the roast in an oven bag and I think that helped keep it juicy

I used a pork shoulder roast.
Was hesitant to use so much garlic, even though we love garlic. Use the suggested amount.
The house smells wonderful. I just took it out of the oven and UUUM its delicious.
GAve the bone to the dog, Mr. Magoo, I think he likes it also.
I marinated the roast for 2 days.
2 THUMBS UP !!!!!

Taste was good.  I added cornstarch to pan drippings for a tasty gravy when reheating leftovers and liked it even better.  Overall the roast was juicy and flavorful without a great deal of effort.

I really didn't like the flavor of the marinade.  I didn't like the rosemary.

This was very yummy.  I only used a 2lb roast, tripled the rosemary (I LOVE rosemary) and left out the dill.  It only took 45 minutes to cook at 325, but I do 20 minutes per pound because I like my pork to be medium, not well done.  Very good recipe; will definately be making again.

My husband and I both agree, we prefer our normal method of cooking pork roast - plop it in the oven with some carrots and potatoes, a little bit of soy sauce, seasoned with garlic poweder, salt, pepper and paprika. No fuss, no marinating. I wasn't fond of the wine taste this recipe gave the meat, and the garlic stuffed in it had an odd texture I didn't like. FWIW, I used a 2-lb roast, used the called-for amounts of spice but halved the amount of wine and marinated for about 24 hours. On the upside, this did prompt me to get out my old dutch oven and re-season it. I'll be using it now for all my roasts!

Really good and tasty!  I used 2 1/2 pounds of pork tenderloin which worked really well.

Good - I took previous advise and marinated for 48 hours.  The roast turned out a bit dry.  I think next time I may shred the roast after cooking and simmer in it's juices to moisten it up. I used the leftovers (as 5 lbs. is quite a bit) to make "Pork Tamale Pie" - very good!

The flavor on this was ok, but it wasn't anything great.  I was expecting a much stronger flavor for how much garlic and spice was in it but the meat didn't seem to absorb much of the flavor.  Next time I'd probably make the juice into a sauce to serve with the meat to get more of the spice flavor.

So, I baked this substituting the apple cider vinegar for the dry red wine, and IT WAS GOOD!!!  I have a finicky teenager who couldn't wait to polish off the leftovers.  We had enough to get 10 servings.  I didn't marinate it as long as requested.  I will next time.  But, it was so good this time, I can't imagine how good it would be with more time.  Just in case it isn't clear, I'll be using this recipe again.  Finger-lickin'-good!!!

Had a 2-1/2 lb. roast, so cut everything in half.  Did marinate overnight.  We used a sirloin roast and it was tough.  Did make a gravy from the drippings which was terrific.  Would suggest a roast with more fat.

The meat was very tender, but the flavor of the marinade was so off-putting.  Was it an aftertaste left behind; pungent, but not in a good way?  I won't make again.

I ended up leaving this in the marinade in the fridge for 4 days - just didn't get around to it! Then I decided to crock pot the meat instead of using the oven, it was absolutely FABULOUS. The meat was super tender (of course - I did 8 hours on low), and the flavor was wonderful. Both of my boys LOVED this meal. Served with cheesy mashed potatoes and steamed mixed veggies.

Not sure how rosemary, dill, and oregano equate to Cuban style flavors. Maybe this needs to just be in a just "roast pork" category.
