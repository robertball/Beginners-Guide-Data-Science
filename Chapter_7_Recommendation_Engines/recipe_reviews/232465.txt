I do love a good vegetable lasagna and roasting the vegetables instead of cooking on a stove top gives them a nice rich earthy flavor. It is still pretty hot here in Florida so we used our gas grill to roast the vegetables, I used the exact amount called for and tossed in a bowl in olive oil and seasonings called for, but also shook in some dried parsley too. They roasted to perfection in 25 minutes, make sure you keep them spaced on the pan and don't pile on top of each other.
I had some of my homemade Marinara sauce that I used for the sauce instead of store bought, and actually had about 8 ounces more, was glad I did, just enough for the top cover of sauce. I did use the oven ready noodles so I didn't have to boil my noodles and took four to cover each layer, used the whole 12 oz. box. As long as you have a layer of sauce next to those noodles they turn out just like they were boiled. I did miss having ricotta cheese in my lasagna, but heck who needs the extra calories and we all really enjoyed this lasagna. I wasn't sure if the baking temp was supposed to be the same as the veggie roasting temp, but to be safe I baked at 375Â°, was bubbling in 30 min.

Throw all the vegies in a plastic bag with the garlic, salt n pepper to mix it all up easily before putting on your tray. Include sliced eggplant (don't forget to salt and drain it first) it fits in perfectly with all the flavours going on in this recipe. Put the eggplant and zucchini on a separate tray to the rest of the vegies cos they'll need to be cooked longer. The prep time of this recipe is lengthy, but it's really worth it. You can also mix in some ricotta cheese into the cheese mix layer for some extra depth and moisture! Love it. Thanks for the recipe.

I omitted the bell pepper and onion in favor of fresh broccoli and baby spinach.  All other ingredients remained the same.  It was the best lasagna I've ever made.

This is a great base recipe.  You can easily vary the vegetables to suit your tastes and to make it your own.  I use orange bell peppers, onions, cauliflower, fennel, artichoke hearts, and zucchini.  I also add ricotta cheese (to me it's not lasagne without it) and some fresh spinach to the layers.  This is a rich and decadent dish that can easily be served for a holiday meal or when you have guests.  A definite keeper.

Added fresh chopped jalapeno pepper and about 1 extra cup of marinara sauce. Next time, the amount of green bell pepper will be reduced at least in half so that it acts to enhance the flavor rather than dominate it. We might also add different veggies as other reviewers say they did, and some fresh herb(s) would perk up the taste. Those are easy adjustments to make and reflect individual taste preferences rather than anything wrong with the recipe. This lasagna is very similar to Hearty Vegetable Lasagna from this site, and either one makes a yummy meatless meal. Thank you cookntraveler.

The key to the extraordinary taste of this vegetable lasagna is roasting the vegetables first. It was delicious! Everybody went back for 2nd's & 3rd's!

so yummy! i used Nadia Porceddu's plastic bag trick to get the veggies well coated in the seasonings.. it took longer than 25 mins to get them to roast and we ended up putting them in the broiler.. but everything was perfect after that.. we used a generic jarred meat sauce so we didn't miss the meat being inside the lasagna itself.. and since i'm lactose intolerant i was worried about using riccota anyway.. ty for a simple lasagna recipe with tons of flavor

This was the best lasagna my husband and I have ever tasted.   I just made a few minor changes, I used marinara sauce instead of pasta sauce and minus the Parmesan cheese.

I made the sauce and  sauteed the mushrooms and onions on the stove, but roasted red/orange bell peppers, zuc and yellow squash in oven.  Added spinach and shredded carrots while layering, but otherwise followed the recipe.  I did take the advice to use olive oil with the seasonings in a bag to coat them.  It was amazing!!

This was very good. My meat loving family said they didn't miss the meat at all. Followed the directions to the T and it was perfect. My 3 year old daughter was a clean plater and asked for more. Pureed some of it up and feed it to my 8 month old who also seemed to really like it. Leftovers reheated great, maybe even better.

Wow, after all the great reviews I thought this would be great!  It was pretty terrible the first night, but leftovers were admittedly good.  We prefer the vegetable lasagna with spinach and think it would be better with cottage cheese or ricotta cheese...maybe next time.

Loved this recipe! I also added eggplant since it came from my garden and didn't want to waste it. Even my roommate who is very anti- vegetable liked it!

Made this lasagna for a large group at Christmastime, one of two pans and this one won the critical review against a recipe by Ina Garten! Of course, hers contained goat cheese which was not to everyone's taste. But by far everyone enjoyed the lighter fare and tastiness of this dish. It was so good I have made it again and will be keeping it in my "favorite Italian dish" repertoire!

We adjusted the recipe by adding broccoli fleurettes, sliced carrots and used green and yellow bell peppers.  We also added 1 12oz package of Tofurky Ground Beef substitute to the sauce and 1/4 of a 15oz Ricotta cheese over each noodle layer. YUM!!  Everyone went back for seconds.

I used a smaller pan,  halved the recipe (except the mushrooms) and used 3 layers of 3 noodles each (cut off about 1 inch) and put all the veggies in the first and second layer. It was perfect.  I can see adding different veggies in the future. I think yellow squash, spinach, broccoli, carrots, and/or cauliflower would be good. I liked the idea of putting the spinach and shredded carrots into a layer without roasting. Will try that next time.

We loved it! A little doctoring to add the ricotta that others have mentioned. We also added broccoli and carrots. Yummy - might be our new Christmas tradition meal.

Delicious! Used a layer of spinach too. 4 stars only because it was a little watery, will drain the roasted veggies better next time.

This was an excellent dish for vegetarian family members. I used mozzarella and cheddar cheese instead of Parmesan, and l roasted and purÃ©ed Roma tomatoes to add to the sauce. It was a thumbs up from everyone, including the carnivores.

this was fantastic! wish I could give it more stars. I used all the veggies but cut onions and peppers in smaller pieces. I added chili flakes to add a good kick. my Indian bf even liked it. next time I'll add the same veggies but also different ones. (I didn't miss the ricotta cheese nor the meat. growing up in an Italian family where sauce is the king it says a lot about this recipe) great great recipe. definitely making this again!!

Was delicious. Made for a group of friends on a Sunday. Made a few modifications. Just added a few more veggies and used small curd cottage cheese to the mozzarella with chopped parsley.

Roasting the vegetables added incredible, rich flavor.  I added in a layer of ricotta cheese (mixed with minced garlic  and about 1/4 c. parmesan) and it was delicious.

I've made this dish for the fifth time and it always get finished without going to leftovers.  A great meal for the family without a lot of effort.  Added squash and red bell pepper.  Also mixed colby jack cheese and Italian blend cheese along with cheddar.  Garlic bread tops off a satisfying meal for the start of fall.

I can't eat gluten and was looking for a recipe to make zucchini lasagne with our homegrown zucchini. I used this recipe and oh my gawd....it was perfection and without noodles!!!! I can't stop going in for another piece. Whether you are gluten intolerant or not.....this is how lasagne should be made! Thanks for the recipe!

Excellent! I tried roasting the garlic cloves whole and then chopping and adding to the vegetable mix, which gave great roasted garlic flavor to the whole dish!

This was easy and delicious!  Rather than roast, I sauteed the veggies, which included red, yellow, orange peppers, mushroom, and zucchini.  I drained them, so they would not be "soupy."   (I skipped the onion)  I also added a layer of "classic" lasagna cheese mix of ricotta, one egg, shredded parm and Italian spices.   Other than that, I followed the recipe.  My family LOVED it!  It also reheats very well, even in the microwave.  Thanks for this great recipe!  (PS: I also cheated and for the first time, used oven ready noodles.  I don't think I'll ever  boil lasagna noodles again!)

I followed all the instructions and even added two extra ingredients..... spinach and celery. I was a bit wary at first as I have always made a meat lasagne. It was absolutely gorgeous, full of flavour .... better than the meat ones I have cooked before. I will definitely be cooking this again. Thank you for the recipe.

Delicious. I added purreed carrots and canned diced tomatoes to the sauce we bought. And instead of mushrooms (not a huge fan), I added spinach but didnt roast them...just added it before baking. Not too watery...I had to baste some of the water out but it was fine. Definitely a keeper!

I will definitely make it again but I will probably make my own sauce.  The jars of pasta sauce tasted fine but I think it would be even more amazing with a homemade sauce.

This turned out sooo good! Instead of bell peppers I used broccoli and spinach. I used a lot of veggies and did two layers. Roasting the  veggetables with herbs gave it a very rich flavor.  I also used Rao's pasta sauce, which is absolutely delish. My family LOVED it.

I made this for New Year's Eve and followed the recipe exactly.  Both the vegetarians and non-vegetarians enjoyed it. I gave it a 5 star because it's a good solid recipe and easy to follow. And, next time I will change up the vegetables slightly to suit my personal preference. I think carrots or squash as some people have suggested would be very good in it.

I added 500 g of ground beef/pork and swapped 200 g of the mozzarella for 200 g gouda. I also did 2 layers instead of 3 because I only had a larger pan and used pre-cooked lasagna noodles.

I also used good olive oil instead of non-stick spray and placed the vegetables on baking paper (I'm NOT a fan of spray anything). 

I used powdered garlic and basel.

It came out great and the pre-cooked lasagna noodles saved me a lot of time.

I'm with the other reviewers, this is a full
5 star recipe! A great tasting healthier lasagna loaded with vegetables and not too much cheese.  We used shredded cheeses, broccoli, onion, and zucchini and fresh basil.

I used fiesta blend cheese instead of mozerella since I did t have that and it turned out very good. My daughter didn't like zucchini so next time I'll try different veggies. Also instead of baking the veggies I sautÃ©ed in a cast iron skillet with olive oil.  This is excellent to remember as well. I like that you don't have to worry about an egg or ricotta cheese. I also used meat sauce.

This was very good.  I loosely followed the recipe, using a slightly different combination of veggies.  I did add a layer of ricotta cheese, since some reviewers said they missed it, and I knew we would like it in there.  Roasting the veggies was a delicious way to do this, although I did saute the mushrooms and onions instead of roasting them.  Everything else was roasted.
