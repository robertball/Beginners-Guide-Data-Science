Either there was a serious misprint on this recipe, or I was naive enough to fall for a joke.
This gives new meaning to "Thats-a spicey sauce!"
Even though I kept the teaspoons of pepper very scant, the recipe ended up totally inedible.

Ok, I got rid of the tomato sauce altogether and used double the tomato paste.  I used 1 tablespoon of Italian Seasoning and 1 tablespoon of Oregano in place of all the other seasonings (too much spice otherwise).  To give it more of a "rich" flavor I added one cup of red wine (Merlot, Cab, whatever you got).  This removes a lot of the tomato-y (sp?) taste and gives the sauce a deep rich flavor and taste.  The end result is a sauce that will go well on any pasta.  No disrespect to the writer, I just put my .02 in the recipe.

I learned this recipe long ago from my Best friend's mother who is Italian, it has exactly the same ingredients but as many of reviewers mentioned, my original recipe uses 1/3 of the spices. I have to add that this is one of my husband's favorites.

in reading the other reviews there seems an issue with the amount of pepper used. well... if you use that stuff from your supermarket that is already pre-ground you can put that much in and more because that stuff even fresh out of a new container is stale -lifeless  with no real bite  you MUST use fresh ground from you own ppr grinder    you see pepper once ground loses it life shortly after being ground    IF you use fresh grnd ppr   then and only then can one speak to the issue of too much or too little ppr

Pretty good. Made as specified except cut down on all the spices by about 1/2, then adjusted at the end (also added 1 tsp or so of sugar at this point).  This made a very thick sauce, needed a little more "sauce" in my opinion.  Ended up adding about 1/2 cup of water or so before storing the leftover sauce.  I would definitely make this again but would add some addt'l tomato sauce, water or wine to the sauce as it cooks. Thanks!

I just made this sauce for the first time.  It is excellent.  I followed the recipe to the letter, however was somewhat short on onion.  The first person who rated this must have done something wrong as I have had no complaints what so ever.

Very Very delicious!  It's slightly spicy but nothing my 3 and 6 year old can't handle and they don't like spicy dishes at all.

This recipe was very quick! And very tasty! It can be made vegetarian too. I added an extra clove or two of garlic and a 1/4 cup of red wine. But use your best judgement on the amount of pepper and/or herbs added. I halved the amount and added more to taste. Delish!

You might be inclined to pass on this recipe after seeing thyme, rosemary, and marjoram in the ingrediants. After all, these are earthy, pungent ingrediants that have big flavors and may not sound appealing in a spaghetti sauce, especially if you're used to the typical garlic/basil/tomato fare. I confess that I probably would've passed this one by. Fortunately, my husband didn't. He found it and made the recipe exactly as written. And I'm so glad he did! It makes a bold and fragrant pasta sauce...that's very, very tasty indeed. Did I mention fragrant? I was surprised at the balance of flavors and how well they work together to make a big, hearty sauce. So make this one with an open mind. If you do and the flavor is not for you, then it's not for you. You didn't do anything wrong and neither did the person who wrote the recipe. I believe this one is written exactly as it should be. And don't tweak it to make it something it's not. This is not meant to be a typical middle of the road, Americanized sauce. If it's too strong for you, try to *proportionately* reduce the rosemary, thyme, marjoram and pepper and see if that helps. That said, this is one recipe where I think tweaking it misses the whole point. While this won't be our "go to" sauce for every day, it's definitely a keeper and one we'll use when we want something different and exciting!

The individuals that said this recipe was inedible etc. are definitely not Italian, nor do they know Italian food. My mother-in-law (from Italy) passed a recipe similar to this on to me thirty years ago - and believe me it's as authentic as can be. If you don't want something to be very spicy, cut back on the spices - It's called adapting the recipe to your own taste.

This is a good sauce.  I have a similar recipe that my dad got from an old Italain lady way back in the 50's.  Note:  Several reviewers ought to get their terminology corrected.  There is ONLY one SPICE in this recipe - pepper.  The others are HERBS.

Funny...lots of reviews saying how "unauthentically Italian" this recipe is.  Does the title or the description of the recipe say "The Worlds Most Authentic Italian" spaghetti"?  Unless I've gone completely blind, it makes no metion whatsoever regarding it being "authentically Italian" so lighten up and review the RECIPE, don't compare it to something it isn't even TRYING to be.  It was a good base recipe, exactly as written.

This sounds like my own recipe but the Italian Mother of my daughter's godfather helped me fine-tune it by adding just a shake of powdered cloves and about 2 shakes of cinnamon. My ex always said it was the best he'd ever tasted - even asked me to teach the recipe to his latest wife! No way, Jose!

This was definitely spicy --but not hot...so it'll satisfy anyone who likes a lot of zip without a lot of heat.  I thought it was great.

After reading all the reviews I prepared the recipe...adding an extra 28 oz can of tomatoes and cutting the spices in half.  Upon completion, I threw the entire pot of sauce out!  While eating a bowl of linguine using the prepared sauce, the odor and taste of the spices was so overpowering, the dish was really inedible!

The only thing I can think of is that you people who said it was too spicy put in 3 TBS of pepper instead of 3 teaspoons.  It's a great recipe in my humble opinion, although I prefer to simmer it longer than 30 minutes.

I loved the consistency of this sauce, however I felt there was just too much rosemary and thyme for my taste.  I will make this again but I will decrease those two spices and maybe increase the basil.

Very good!  I didn't realy measure out the spices as written--I just put in amounts that made sense to me.  I also left out the tomato paste, although I love a thicker sauce so I'm sure I would've liked it that way.  I cooked off the liquid from the tomatoes before adding the sauce to the meat mixture.  Very delicious, and quite quick and easy.  I served over spaghetti and with garlic toast.  A nice weeknight dinner; thanks for the recipe!

this is a great recipe...but be careful.  the canned tomatos and sauce are the LARGE cans....not the regular sizes.  It's an easy detail to miss and i think it's what ruined the first reviewers effort.  Follow the recipe and you won't be disappointed.

Actually, this recipe should be given a BIG thumbs down.Even 1 star is too generous. The previous reviewers discussions about the herbs and spices are spot on. Lesson to be learned: Read the entire recipe before attempting.

This recipe is okay, but can be improved upon. You can also saute along with onions, celery, garlic, and parsley. Spice up your beef as you brown, add seasonings that you like,(seasonall,garlic powder, pepper, basil etc.) Also add wine to the sauce for a mellowed out flavor. You can also add mild baked italian sausage to simmer in the sauce for a great flavor for 2 to 3 hours. Then enjoy!

The recipe is perfect the way it is.  If you need to cut down on the pepper, you must not be able to handle spicier food.  Anyone who can, would like it the way it is. :P

This recipe would have been terrible if I would have put all the spices that it called for in. So I halved the spices and made it vegetarian to make it less expensive and it turned out fabulous. I made it for the whole office and all 12 people said it was the best sauce they ever had

I didn't have marjarom, but so far it tastes pretty good. It's still on the stove simmering right now.

This is a great recipe! I am vegetarian so just skipped the meat-cooking portion of the recipe. Instead, I cooked the onions & garlic in olive oil until the onions began to get soft, added the tomato paste & stirred for a few minutes. Then added about 1/3 cup of white wine to clean the bottom of the pan. After that, went back to recipe directions, added the rest of the ingredients PLUS I added mushrooms & black olives. Simmered for at least an hour, which made the house smell great! MMM!

This sauce is perfect! I usually put all the spices in a bowl together and add a portion at a time, I put about half in and tasted, it was good but I figured I should add the rest and it really made the sauce perfect. I don't know why people have a problem with the amount of spice, tastes good to me. If you like things simple add less of the spices I think it just depends on your tastes.

Good sauce but I will change some things if I make again. I cut the spices in half which left a nice flavorful sauce, but something was too strong, maybe thyme or marjoram, will do less of each next time. I added tablespoon of sugar at the end, but may add 2 next time. I also added 1/2 cup wine. Was perfect consistency. Definitely not a sweet sauce.

I made this and used 1/2 the salt and pepper called for but the stated quantities for the other spices. I didn't have canned diced tomatoes so used a second can of tomato sauce. It was excellent. Will try next time with italian sausage and red pepper added and will definitely make again. The tomato paste gives it a nice, rich colour and the taste is a bit spicey but not overly so. Thanks Chizi.

Marjoram, rosemary and thyme? I want to taste tomatoes in my sauce.  I'm sorry my daughter decided to try it and waste all those ingredients.  She read the reviews and made suggested adjustments didn't save this sauce.  We're sticking to our basic tomato/garlic/basil/red pepper flakes sauce from now on.

This recipe was just ok for me.  I am 100% Italian, and the sauce I make is similar to this.  Italians do not add ground beef to the sauce, usually pork or Italian sausage.  I use two cans of tomato paste, one big(28oz) can of crushed tomatoes and one big (28oz) can of tomato puree. As for the herbs, the measurements were in the ballpark MINUS the rosemary and maybe 2tsp pepper.  I eye all of my add-ins, so when I measured these last night, they seemed about right.  This sauce was good if you dont have the time to throw meatballs together and have to get the kids fed.

The title is correct, this is 'tasty'.  Next time I'll probably use sweet italian sausage.  As for the debate on whether it's 'authentic' Italian or not, who cares?!  The title is tasty, not authentic and I think people need to see it as just another variation on a pasta sauce.  I also, as another reviewer stated, like to simmer my sauce longer, so I did.

The recipe would make a good start for Ragu alla bolognese a specialty of Bologna. All you would need to add would be 1 stick of celery chopped;1 carrot chopped;1/2 cup red wine and 1/2 cup milk. 2 tbsp pancetta would enhance it if you have it. I would also substitute red pepper flakes to taste instead of the black pepper.

Waay too much thyme. 4 teaspoons?? It was hardly edible. If I made this again I would put about 1 teaspoon, then season to taste.

This was okay with a few adjustments. I took the advice of others and decreased the spices. 1 t. salt, 1/4 t. pepper, 1/2 t. each of the thyme, basil, rosemary, and marjoram. Husband and kids liked it; would have been too spicy for us otherwise.

I will make this adding sm cubes of yellow and zucchinis squash extra onion to taste & fresh mushrooms and 1/2 -1 C red wine. Simmer 2 hours. I feel confidant this is a good recipe. I frequently make vegetarian sauce using purchased sauce and adding the above. Loved by everyone. PJ

I'm glad I read the reviews before I made this.  I also halved the spices, and the pepper I kept to 1 tsp.  Otherwise this was a great recipe, and would probably work very well as the sauce for a meatball sub.  I liked that it was fast, simple, and tasty.

I really liked this sauce.  I didn't use all the pepper, just to taste.  But I don't really like pepper so that was the only reason.  I used all the other seasonings exactly how it was written and my whole family liked it. Awesome.

Awesome! I substituted the ground beef with Italian sausage (bulk) and it turned out great! My family finished all I made during one meal! Very good 'base' recipe. There are lots of ways this can be modified for different flavor experiences! Thanks!!

Excellent sauce. I followed it to the letter, and had it with garlic bread and a glass of muscat canelli. The only change I would make in the future is less pepper, but I love the spices and the smell of it simmering was delicious!!!

This was a great recipe, although I adjusted it a little.  Instead of just using ground beef, I used half ground beef and half ground pork.  Instead of dried thyme I used fresh and also added fresh oregano and did not crush the bay leaf but instead removed it before serving.  Lastly, when I was browning the meat, I deglazed the pan with some red wine.  Delicious!

This recipe was easy,but the amounts of spices for the amount of meat was not good. There was way too much salt for only 1lb. of meat. I would suggest ctting way back on the amounts of salt and spices given. Start with half the amount of each,and then add more if needed.

Followed the recipe except used ground turkey instead of beef, but it was still excellent.  I will always use this recipe for spaghetti sauce from now on... Thanks

I omitted the pepper, added a tablespoon of brown sugar and simmered on low in the crock pot for 8 hours. It was so easy, especially since you can brown the meat the night before. Sometimes I use boneless chicken instead of the ground beef. That's even simpler, no need to brown the chicken in the skillet!

I've been looking for a sauce just like this. Of course, like all recipes, one tends to tweek to one's taste. I reduced the pepper just a wee bit.   As for the first review, I've made hot wings where one person will say, TOO SPICY and another said it needed more.   That's the point of reviews.

The folks who cut down on the herbs & pepper must only use commerical/bottled sauce. This is a perfect recipe. I admit the hambuger is not authentic. I use pork or sausage as the Italians do. Thanks for the recipe.

This is very similar to my own spaghetti sauce recipe. I use only oregano and bay leaf, and add basil just before serving. Tip; add red wine to the meat/onion mixture and reduce for a wonderful flavor.

It was a little off on the amounts. I increased the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes and did the seasonings like this but added shredded carrots, red wine and extra garlic salt. It was amazing and the sauce can be used with many recipes. You can even add veggies for a vegetarian version. I plan on using this one a lot. I can't wait to do meatballs with it!! A lil crused red pepper for a kick and omg!!

This is an excellent sauce. My husband is Turkish and dislikes the sauces from a jar that I will grab to make a fast meal. In Turkey they "cook by the season" so sauces are freshly made and prepared at home most of the time. 

The other day I got a great find at the farmer's market;a whole box of just past ripe tomatoes for only $3. They were at the point that they were juicy but would not be good in a salad or for slicing so I peeled, seeded and chopped what came to a full gallon bag of fresh tomatoes. I used two large onions, extra garlic, added some fresh oregano that the owner of the market threw in and a tbsp of thyme (my hubby's favorite herb). I also kept the tomato paste, but that was the only thing canned. At the end we added two pounds of lean ground beef. It fed us all and left two quarts for freezing the next time we have spaghetti. 

I will definitely be making this again and using canned tomatoes in a pinch, but I truly recommend using fresh tomatoes if you can. It is so worth the effort for the amazing flavor! (For this recipe I'd guess 6-8 tomatoes would do the trick!)

This was a tasty sauce.  I did follow GFELAN's post and eliminated the sauce and doubled the paste.  I think next time I will keep the sauce.  It was WAY to thick.  I had to add quite a bit of water and it was still much thicker than jarred sauce.  I also did 1TBSP ital. seasoning, and 1TBSP oregano.  I also added a tablespoon or two of sugar, because the tomato flavor was very strong.  I will make this again, with adjustments.

This is my new sauce, I to added all the pepper the first time and ended up cutting it with some vinegar and sugar.  The second time I made it only used 1 teaspoon which worked out for me,  and still added sugar to my taste.  Did not cut any other of the other spices down and the family loved it.  Liked the idea of adding the red wine to it thanks for the idea.

I found the recipe quite tasty, spices were fine, per other reviews I use less fresh ground pepper. This is the second time I have made it. This time I had leftover wine I added and now will continue to do so.Just gave it the extra yum!

Easy to make but I personally thought it calls for too many spices and too much pepper!If you like it with a kick this is the one for you. I didnt read the reviews before making it so that was my mistake.To tone it down a bit,  I recommend 1 tsp of S & P, 4 tsp of italian seasoning and a Tbs of sugar or splenda.
