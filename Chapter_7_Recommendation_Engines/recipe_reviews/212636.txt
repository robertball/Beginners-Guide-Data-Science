Outside of adding some fresh minced garlic, I prepared this following the recipe closely.  And we enjoyed the heck out of it.  Sometimes things don't need a whole lot of explanation or analysis. This is one of those times.  It works.  (I used No Name Sirloin Steaks, baby bok choy and basmati rice. Hubs made "Cucumber Sunomono" to go with - delicious )

Perfect for weekdays. Prepare night before so all you have to do next day is cook it. A few things I did other than recipe called for: 1) Marinate Beef overnight in salt, pepper, minced ginger. 2) Cut up all veggies night before. Placed all veggies together in ziplock bag in fridge. 3) Mixed sauce night before and added red pepper flakes to add spice.  I browned the beef with the ginger that I marinated with.  It added that "japanese" flavor that I was looking for.  Enjoy!

Fabulous! Even my pickiest child loved it! Marinated the meat in 1cup soy, 2TBS chopped garlic, and 1/4cup lemon juice. Tenderizes the meat nicely.

It looked very nice. It wasn't an overly exciting flavor, but the sauce was pretty strong/salty. I should have followed some of the other suggestions to cut down the soy sauce and add some ginger.

I found this recipe looking up healthier beef recipes on Allrecipes. It tasted pretty good, but boy was it time consuming! I actually cut up all the vegetables and sliced the meat earlier in the day because I was going to be busy in the evening. Half the meat and vegetables had to be cooked at a time, as suggested, which made it a little messy and dirtied more dishes than necessary. The end result strangely reminded me a little bit of the flavor of chop suey. I definitely will try buying the sirloin as suggested. I thought it was way more tender than round steak. I also don't ever use bok choy so that was an interesting addition I had not thought of. Overall it was just too much time in the kitchen, for my normal quick stir fry recipes, but it surprisingly was much better than what I would expect from a healthier beef dish.

Lovely recipe. Very easy to do. All I would change, possibly, is the Beef broth to oxtail soul and maybe add a tablespoon of oyster sauce. Hat's off to Campbell kitchen for this dish!!

Wow!  I've had a lot of home made stir-fries in my day, and all were okay, but never anything impressive.  But THIS recipe is amazing!  Even my husband who really isn't much of an Asian food fan went back for seconds!
    I made the recipe as Directed except: I used marinated tofu in place of beef to make it vegan (my god was it yummy), and i added 2 cloves of galic and a 1" finely chopped piece of finer right before I sautéed the veggies.  

It was quite saucy, but I'm a saucy lady so it didn't bother me any :D

This was a nice stir fry.  I prepped all of the ingredients the day before (thawed/sliced/marinated beef and chopped all of the veggies) so it was a much smoother weeknight meal.  Following the advice of fellow reviewers, I marinated the beef in a soy/lemon juice/garlic marinade to ensure the meat would be tender and it really added a nice flavor to the beef.  I followed the rest of the recipe, save two ingredients:  our local grocery store doesn't carry bok choy, so I used green cabbage and I DETEST celery, so I left that out.  I'm lazy, so I added all of the beef at once, then removed it and took care of the veggies.  I didn't feel like removing the veggies, so I removed the pan from the heat and heated the sauce in the small saucepan, then added the sauce/meat to the veggies and stirred.  I served this over brown rice.  4 stars because this is crazy salty, and I used reduced sodium soy sauce.  And I love salt.  Oh yeah, I also added a bit of sesame oil to the oil (and I reduced it to 1T) to give it a bit more of an Asian flair than just the name :)

we really enjoyed this dish. I didn't have as much meat or mushrooms as it called, or all the red peppers.  Used a green and red pepper instead, also it seemed that the whole bok choy was too much, but in the end it was definately worth it.  Very yummy and flavorful

I thought the sauce was a little strong and would cut back some on the soy sauce.  I added a frozen bag of stir fry veggies and it was nice.

Recipe is easy to make. I personally used half ingredients but sauce amount was used as instructed. I ended up using a little more sauce than half. It was good but, for my taste buds sauce was a bit strong on the soy part. However my husband loved it said, "that's the way it's supposed to taste".  I will definitely save recipe just make some adjustments next time.

This was good, but the prep was a solid 45 minutes. For that much work, I was bummed that it ended up tasting like good Chinese takeout in brown sauce, and this costs a lot more. I definitely didn't slice the beef thin enough, but otherwise followed the recipe to a T. May or may not make again.

Awesome!  It needs/needed something more with seasonings.  I cooked the meat in two cloves of garlic.  I also added sesame seeds and garlic and onion powder at the end.  Would have loved to add some fresh or powdered ginger, but could'nt find any. :(  Great recipe! Family loved it!  Thanks so much for sharing!

This was so delicious, fun and easy to make. My boyfriend is vegetarian, so we stir fried diced tofu and used vegetable broth. We also used about double the garlic (we're garlic fiends), and sushi rice instead of regular long grain. The stickiness of the rice mixed with the sauce and shiitake mushrooms completely made the dish; we will definitely be making this again!

This was a great recipe! I did add some garlic and a little red pepper to spice it up a bit.  This will become part of our monthly rotation. Easy and flavorful.

I made this last night.  I did use different veggies (broccali, carrots, and snow peas due to preference) but I kept everything else the same.  I also seasoning the beef with garlic power and black pepper.  Wonderful.  My husband and grown kids loved it and it made a great portion.  I'm looking forward to the leftovers.  Thanks for sharing.

This is SOOOO delicious! I've made it with both steak and chicken and much prefer the chicken. I add garlic, use a bag of frozen stir fry veggies in addition to the mushrooms and bok choy, and omit the celery and green onions. The sauce is perfect - don't change a thing! I don't bother removing the meat/veggies from the pan between steps or work in batches. It's not necessary if you have a large enough pot.

Very tasty, and we liked the bok choy!  I will say that I didn't have any condensed beef broth on hand, and have never even seen it, so I added double the bullion to the broth I made.  It was a little too heavy on the salt.  I don't recommend it.  Despite that, it was still really tasty.

Very tasty. Beef should be cut thinner, and could use a little less soy sauce.

Really delicious! My husband raved about it. I made it without all the vegetables because it seemed like there was going to be too many as I was chopping them up. After all was said and done, however, I regretted it because there seemed to be too few. So my advice would be to follow the recipe as is. You won't regret it!

Loved this recipe! We ran out of soy says so we used teriyaki sauce instead and we didn't use onions. It was perfect and the kids even begged for seconds!!

This was easy and delicious. I switched up the veggies a bit and used thin cut carrots, and a green pepper instead of the mushrooms and celery. My husband and I loved it but my 5 year olds were not thrilled with it, although they did eat it at least!

Wish I would have marinated my meat beforehand, but WOW was this tasty! My kitchen smelled like a Japanese steakhouse! I didn't have beef broth, so I used chicken broth instead. Added minced garlic and a splash or two of lemon juice to the meat as it was cooking. Also used the veggies I had on hand: Green cabbage, celery, green peppers, and zucchini. This is definitely a recipe that can be altered to fit your tastes!

This was surprisingly easy to make and very good too.  All my picky's ate this dish, so I know I will make it again.  I was fresh out of Chinese cabbage, so I substituted broccoli for a delicious dinner.

Used 3.6 pounds of thin-sliced flank steak, 2 cups of beef stock made with Better than Boullion, 1 cup of soy sauce, 2 onions, 2 cloves of garlic, a whole red pepper, and @ 6 oz. sliced button mushrooms.  It was amazing, and made enough for dinner for 3 nights.

Great dinner for the whole family. Took time to prep, but worth it to me, who LOVES asian foods. We have found ourselves ordering in a lot on Friday nights lately, which is fine, but why not make it a home cooked meal once in a while that we all can help out with? 
~ I added a dash of fresh pressed ginger to the pork (we used pork since it was what we had on hand) and it was great. Will make again.

The flavor was great.  But it was very saucy as written.  Next time I will make 1/3 the sauce.  I marinated the beef for 8 hours in soy sauce, lemon juice and garlic.  I also froze the beef for an hour before cutting in to make it easier to slice thin.

Very good! Even our picky toddler liked it. I added 2T chopped garlic and 1T fresh grated ginger, right before the sauce is added (cooked them about 2min)
and added extra veggies (snap peas were a great addition) 
Next time I'll try a reduced beef stock or bouillon though as I didn't like the canned taste.

Not a big stir fry fan" but had a record Bok Choy crop coming out of the garden so decided to give it a try.  Hubby and daughter love stir fry!  WOW!  I loved it!  I cut recipe down to 4 servings as there are only 3 in the family.  We ate it and the daughter finished the leftovers  the next day.  The crew did have one comment other then, WOW!  Next time, don't half the recipe.  We need more leftovers!

I really enjoyed this recipe. The sauce was flavorful and easy to make and it incorporated a ton of great healthy vegetables. The recipe is extremely versatile to allow for adding whatever you've got in your veggie drawer.

Excellent dish. Taste like an authentic Japanese meal that I have at a restaurant only this one is better. I omitted the mushrooms and celery and used a bit less soy sauce. It's important to follow the instructions correctly and it will be amazing.

I had some bok choy that I got in my Bountiful Basket and me nor my family had ever eaten it. I found this recipe and decided to try it and we loved it so much that we made it again and again and again. We now bok choy regularly. It's really delicious. It's a little time consuming chopping all those veggies (I chop by hand. My Grandma taught me food only taste better if you put your blood, sweat, and tears in it.) but well worth it.

This was very good!  Next time I will marinade the beef over night & it will probably be 6 stars.  I'll also try adding a little ginger.  Will definitely make again.

I only used the broth recipe, and used chicken broth instead of beef, but it was really good.  Nice consistency and it gave the extra flavor/sauce needed with my chicken and veggie stir fry over white rice.

This was a great stir-fry, what really made it was the combination of veggies!!  In the grocery, I noticed there was bok choy and Chinese cabbage, two different kinds of vegetables.  I used the bok choy, and it was wonderful.  I would suggest using low-sodium beef broth and low sodium soy sauce because the sauce was very salty so I ended up not using as much as the recipe called for since I didn't have the low sodium versions.

Doesn't smell stir-fry until its done, but it taste great!  we just used normal mushrooms and normal cabbage.  This recipe makes a LOT more than we expected, they must be feeding football players or something.  Definitely add the garlic!

This was so good!!  I used sesame oil, and left out the veggies we don't like.  I usually make a dish, and then immediately start making plans for what I'll change next time.  With this, I had no changes for next time.  And next time will be soon!

Just. The. Best. Ever. I use this recipe A Lot. Use up veggies before they turn is one of the many uses for this recipe. I do use sesame oil and fresh ginger with a smattering of ground ginger flakes and it makes the dish! You won’t be disappointed!

Yum ! Easy and efficient way to make stir fry ! I’ve made this a few times and substituted the beef broth for chicken or  miso. Also used celery ,broccoli ,carrots,white onion and added snow peas after taking the wok off the heat and letting it rest for 5 min . Delicious and no lunch leftovers :(

Very good! I was afraid it would be too salty with the soy sauce but it was perfect. Skipped mushrooms and used 1 green pepper instead. Sautéd the beef in some minced ginger. Used baby bok choy instead of bok choy. Served with cucumber sunomono as a side dish (also on All Recipes). Make sure you constantly stir the sauce like the recipe suggests.

this was excellent!  I marinated the beef for about 45 mins.  I didn't use all of the sauce because I didn't want a soggy dish.  When I cooked the beef, it left quite a bit of liquid, so I used that to saute the garlic and onions, then as I stir fried the rest of the veggies, I only used about 1/4-1/2 cup of the sauce. ..I've made several beef stir fry before...but I think this was one of the best!

It’s all about the sauce! I didn’t have any of the veggies on hand so I improvised with carrots and frozen green beans, it was great. I also added cubed tofu and it was really good. Will definitely be making this again! :)

Was good, my girlfriend liked it more than me. Personally I think the sauce was just a bit too thick, but I ate the leftovers the day after and it was just about perfect then. It could use broccoli.
I would like to add that it took up a ton of dishes, needed space to hold things.

Fast and easy to make!  I used broccoli and cauliflower and carrots because I had them on hand, but you really could use a variety of vegetables.   I served with brown rice and it was very good (and healthy!).

This was a very good stir fry.  I did not make any changes and will definitely make it again.  Sliced the beef when partially frozen which works well.  I served it with rice and a cucumber salad.  My husband and son thought it was great.  I did too!
Happy Granny

First attempt (as written) came out way too salty. Switched to low sodium soy sauce and decreased the quantity from 4 ounces to 3. Much better, and I'll definitely be making this again.

My wife and I really enjoyed this.  Stuck to the recipe except we marinated the beef in soy, ginger, garlic and omitted the celery, simply because we didn’t have any. With the boc choy I don’t think it needed it anyway.    It’s  really tasty give it a try

Like some of the others here I marinated the beef for several hours in 1/4 cup of Tamari, fresh garlic and ginger root. I used Tri-tip roast (which I use for all my beef stir fry). I followed the instructions except I substituted the Campbell's condensed soup for Better Than Bouillon Beef Base. The Campbell's has MSG. The dish smelled heavenly and tasted good except that it was way too salty for our tastes. I'll definitely try it again but next time with low sodium Tamari or Soy Sauce. I may look for a low sodium beef or oxtail broth as well.

Oh my gosh! Sooooo good. I used broccoli instead of bok choy, regular white button mushroom instead of shiitake and I added a thinly sliced carrot! So delicious over white rice. It makes a good amount of sauce to pour extra on top of your stir fry and rice. I will definitely do this again!

I used a flank steak and only had mushrooms on hand.  Also did not have beef broth but instead just used a beef bouillon cube dissolved in a cup of hot water.  This was very good!  This made plenty of sauce.  In fact, could probably use less soy sauce next time.

The first time I made this recipe, my family thought it was ok but could use more flavor. The next time, I added some minced garlic along with ginger (the kind that comes in a tube--easy!), and it was a huge hit! I use only 1 pound beef and add 1 pound chicken, leave out the mushrooms, and add green peppers, pea pods, or whatever fresh vegetables we have on hand. It has become one of my go-to recipes. My son requested this as his "last" home-cooked meal before heading off to college!

This was really good. Husband who rarely compliments even said something. I used fresh garden veggies (green beans, corn, and carrots) because that's what I had on hand. I had to add a fair bit of broth to the veggies to help "steam" them. I thought the sauce was amazing although maybe just a touch salty. Might try reducing soy a little next time. Thanks for sharing.

I gave this five stars. However, I made this with chicken broth, chicken breast and even threw in some shrimp I had on hand. Everybody loved it. I also made rice and put this on top of it. I will definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.

Great recipe! Really easy, and good for a home-y weekday dinner. Added garlic, and switched the celery to snow peas, but really you can use any veggies. It's nice to have a quick sauce that you can easily remember for next time!

Made this for my hubby and I and it was absolutely delicious.  I made only two mods to it that's it. Instead of beef I used chicken and instead of condensed beef broth I used mushroom base (to me it just tastes so much better) and then followed the recipe as written. There was no need for me to add any salt and pepper as the mushroom base and soy did the job. I never ever hear anything from my hubby when he's eating dinner with me (in terms of taste) so when I heard "Mmmm, this is a good dinner" it was adamant I leave a great review for the owner of this recipe (not to mention that I felt fabulous for making something he liked!!)  Thank you so much for sharing. I'm definitely making this again and again and again. Awesome!

I was seriously disappointed in this sauce. I cut soy in half, replaced the condensed soup with low-sodium beef broth and increased it to 14oz...I then also added a teaspoon of minced garlic and a teaspoon of ginger.

First time making stir fry and it turned out great! I marinated the beef with teriyaki sauce, salt, pepper, Worcestershire sauce, and ginger sauce while I'm cutting all the veggies. I also added broccoli. I set aside half a cup of the stir fry sauce for serving.

My husband said this meal was better than eating out! We didn't have all the vegetables, so we used some others, and we used chicken instead of steak. As long as you use the sauce, you can basically add whatever you like in stir fry. So good!

Loved this! Restaurant quality meal. However,  I added a few extra veggies though: broccoli,  baby corn, carrots slices, bamboo chutes,   green bell pepper, orange bell pepper, and yellow onions.  I also substituted brown rice for white rice and only used the bell peppers instead of red peppers. Also added 3 tablespoons of freshly minced ginger to the sauce. So fabulous.

Taste better than most restaurant beef stir fry. I've been following this recipe for over 1 year. I never use mushrooms or bok choy and it's still flavorful.

I just used frozen veggies to make a simple stir fry, added a spoonful of minced garlic and a shake of ginger and it turned out delicious!!  I fried the beef and made the sauce according to the recipe and will definitely be making this again.

I should've marinated the meat but I was looking for a low calorie stir fry that was quick. This has good flavor and is very easy to make even though the meat could be softer.

Easy to make on weeknights if you're in the mood for stir-fry! The recipe is very versatile; you can sub the meat for tofu (or get rid of it entirely if you want) and sub the veggies for any that you have. The sauce is very easy to make and even better the next day. Highly recommend if you're in the mood to make something quick.

Excellent recipe and good directions overall, but I feel like more inexperienced cookers would benefit from knowing about how long to cook the ingredient to make them "crispy". Great flavor, sauce was a hit!

I made this last night and it was delicious!   I used sirloin steak sliced thin and did a 30 minute marinade with soy sauce, minced garlic and fresh lemon juice. The meat was very tender!  I also added minced garlic as I was sautéing the veggies.  Once it was finished, I sprinkled sesame seeds and mustard powder on top (as suggested from viewing another recipe).  It added a nice zing to the dish.

NO NEED FOR CHINESE TAKE OUT!!  I have made this recipe 3 times now and each time it gets better and better!  I add water chestnuts and broccoli and a teaspoon of minced garlic.  I also use low-sodium soy sauce. I eliminate the celery and the cabbage for personal taste preference.  I love how the sauce thickens up at the end.  I would strongly recommend using a good quality meat and when you brown it do not cook it thru, otherwise by the time you serve the meal the meat will be too dry and lose its taste.  So fast and easy to make even the kids clean their plates!

This recipe was delicious. It was a great hit with my husband. I followed the sauce recipe as stated except for using low sodium broth and low sodium soy sauce. I used ground turkey instead of beef. I also used veggies of my choice: broccoli, carrots, bell peppers and one Serrano pepper. Great recipe. I recommend to try it out!!!

Pretty great! Easy to make, and family loved it. Way to much sauce for me, and pretty sweet. I added fresh garlic, and water chestnuts which were welcome additions. Not authentic at all bit yummy none the less. Needs more bok choy.

This recipe was a hit in my family. My youngest ate it all up and he is very picky when it comes to vegetables. Will definitely be making it again.

A fantastic base. I have made this several times and I don't like to use all the broth or soy sauce and I add some hoisin and a few splashes of siracha. Restaurant grade!!!

Used 16oz bag of frozen 'asian mix veggies', about one cup of frozen chopped onions, and one cup of frozen chopped bell peppers. Also substituted beef with chicken breast cut into thin strips, and chicken broth (made from a bouillon cube). Didnt have cornstarch, so based on the internet - I substituted with double flour. Everything came out fantastic! I loved it! But it did make a *lot* of sauce and it was pretty salty (I love salt, so I dont mind really). In the future Ill probably use less soy sauce. Made a good amount too! Ill likely freeze into smaller portions since Im just myself. :)

Great recipe - just tweak it to your preferance. It was a bit bland for us, so I added garlic powder, onion powder and some red pepper flakes. DH doesn't like mushrooms, so I added zucchini instead. He thought I was the greatest chef in the world! I love it when that happens. :)

this was a huge hit with my family including children under 12.  I used a little less soy sauce that required and followed advice from others re marinating meat with soy sauce, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) it was awesome :)

This recipe is awesome!  My son who is not a fan of veggies had three helpings!  Only different things I did was to add garlic to the meat prior to cooking and I added two sliced carrots to the veggies.  Makes loads with enough for two of us to take leftovers to work tomorrow!

This recipe was simple and easy to customize.  I normally screw up the recipes here as I have to omit mostly all veggies (we are picky eaters and veggies are our biggest issue).  We halved the soy sauce as recommended, used sirloin steak with Yellow Onions and Green bell peppers for the veggies.  Since my husband won't eat the veggies I used I mixed them in last and on one side of the pan.  This recipe was AMAZING!  One pan and two small bowls is all it took.  I did add some garlic to the veggies and Adobo on the beef for an extra kick. Tossed over some white rice with a side salad (that my husband would eat for his "veggie.")  Will make again!

We could eat this meal once, but it is not worth all the work. Not a whole lot of flavor, and a lot of work. I will not be cooking this again!!

This was a delicious recipe! I used chicken instead of beef, and it worked out perfectly. The only thing I felt was lacking was something crunchy; peanuts or water chestnuts might be a good addition.

I have made this several times now. My family loves this recipe. I do leave out the celery as my family is not a fan of cooked celery. I add thin sliced carrots instead. Sometimes I used spaghetti squash instead of rice. Delicious!

This is a keeper in my house.  Such a good flavor, even the kids loved it.  Just a little warning, you will not need to add salt to your plate just a little pepper for seasoning.

This recipe was amazing. However substituting the rice with rice noodles made it even better. Also shiitake mushrooms are unavailable where I live for the most part, but regular mushrooms did just fine. A hint of fresh garlic and just a pinch of ginger made this a favorite for me.

It was alright.  I marinated the meat using the Beef Bulgogi recipe on this site.  Plus, I added fresh ginger to that.  I couldn't find the Campbell's beef product mentioned so I used a good quality beef broth.  I think this is where I went wrong.  It lacked a richness.  My husband said it needed hoisin sauce.  I used a can of straw mushrooms to keep the cost down.  I also added a small splash of sesame oil.  It would have been really bland without my ginger, sesame oil and fresh chopped cilantro.  I will make it again though, and tweak again.  If I can't find the campbells, I will try beef consume next time.

I tried this for the first time..but only had a handful of veggies on hand. Green, red and yellow peppers. Cremini mushrooms, and onions. Instead of beef I used thinly sliced pork chops..cooked ahead of time and sliced into strips. The sauce is amazing! My son loved it, as did I. I will definitely make this again..changing it up a bit with different, healthier options. Might even try throwing in a bit of quinio for something different. 
For the rice, I used pre flavoured rice, which added a little bit of a kick.

This recipe is absolutely flawless! I took the advice of @flymoma42 and marinated the meat before cooking it in soy sauce, lemon juice and minced garlic. My fiance has been begging me to cook him something "asian" but after previous disasters I steered clear until this recipe came along, it was easy to make and a huge hit!! I will be making this again!! Thank you!!

Love the brown sugar addition in this recipe. Adds the extra flavor, my beef stir-fry was missing that makes it taste like all the ones at good oriental restaurants!

All four of our kids actually liked this! I used a bag of frozen stir fry veggies for convenience. The only change I would make is to reduce the sugar. It was a little bit sweet for our taste.
