I thought this was delightful, and so good for you!  I did use the quinoa.  It was very simple to put together and kept well as leftovers.

Perfect salad.  Light and refreshing.  The tuna and beans add just the right amount of protein for a perfect meal.  The only change I made was adding some pepper. My daughter and I both loved this. Thank you Marcia for sharing.

More salt.  Needs some crunch: pickles or cukes.

I used red kidney beans in this.  The flavors somewhat compete for attention, maybe the vinegar or the mustard should be reduced.  More onion might have made this better.  Overall, the taste was fine, but this didn't have a WOW factor.

This was so good and so easy to make. I omitted the quinoa simply because I donâ€™t like it, and used fresh mozzarella balls instead of Parmesan. The dressing is fantastic and the whole thing is very filling. Makes a great lunch
