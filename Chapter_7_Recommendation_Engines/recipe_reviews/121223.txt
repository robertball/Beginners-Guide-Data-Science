I found this to be a very tasty recipe. I did substitute fresh asparagus for the frozen and it is definately a recipe I will make again.

I used skim milk instead of 2% and added 1.5 lbs shrimp to the mix before baking and it turned out great!  Definitely will make again!

This was edible and the asparagus had a nice flavor.  Even so, It's was more trouble to put together than is warranted to produce a dish that's only edible. I wont be making this one again.

Very good and easy.  Asparagus is not a favorite in my house, but this was a hit!

Used fresh instead of frozen asparagus which, to my thinking, should have made it better.   It's an "okay" dish but not one I will make again.

This was very good! I wanted to try something different with fresh aspargus and this fit the bill. I did not have pimentos and used limes instead of the lemons. Delish!

It's not that this recipe was inedible; it was just very, very unremarkable. The heavy sauce masked the taste of asparagus and offered nothing interesting on its own. I made it as a side for Christmas dinner and tossed the leftovers. Won't make again...

I, too, replaced the frozen asparagus for fresh asparagus. And, used my favorite Baby Portabella mushrooms.  Together with our Salmon dish, this was perfect!  Can't wait to make it again.
