These were very cute and tasty cupcakes. I made them for the Sunday School class I was teaching; all the kids loved them! The only chocolate cake mix I had was German Chocolate, but I thought this would work better because it has a lighter, milk-chocolate flavor that tastes more like hot cocoa.I also used powdered hot cocoa mix instead of cocoa powder, because I didn't have any. The cupcake frosting is so good; it is light and fluffy and tastes just like hot chocolate!

I used actual hot cocoa mix packets in the marshmallow, and piped in a small amount of chocolate pudding into the top of the baked cupcake. These were fantastic!  Served them at a bonfire. Everyone loved them!

the frosting is very light and airy, and fluffy.  i guess it kinda taste like hot cocoa... but a very plain and boring hot cocoa - hot water and a little sweetened cocoa powder.

These were a cute idea.  But I wasn't super impressed with the flavor ... probably mostly b/c of the boxed mix.

Super yum! Followed recipe exactly. Loved how chocolatey but light this icing was. Dusted with cocoa powder....pretty presentation on top of the mini marshmallows.  Thanks!

Made as directed and it was great.  I'm only basing this review on the frosting since, well, the cake is a mix.  The frosting is delicious and has a hot cocoa flavor when alone, but the cake covers that up so you can't really tell when they're together.  If the cake also had a flavor closer to hot cocoa then I think it would work.  Oh, I also didn't put the marshmallows on top as I only had large ones.
