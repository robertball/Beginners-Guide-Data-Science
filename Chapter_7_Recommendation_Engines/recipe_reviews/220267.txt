I will admit that I changed a couple of things in this recipe. For starters I chose to use fresh broccoli over frozen because all of the other veggies were fresh and it just made sense to me. I have been trying to watch my sodium intake and so I chose to sub the 7 bouillon cubes/3 cups of water for 3 cups of low sodium chicken broth. The directions did not say to peel the russet potato but red potatoes are the only ones that I leave the skin on so I did that out of personal preference. The cayenne was a nice touch and added to the overall flavor. All in all this is an excellent recipe and one I will make again but I will stick with the changes I made.

I love this soup!!!  I did change two things regarding the ingredients:  I used fresh broccoli (although I am sure frozen would work just fine), and I also used a quart of turkey broth I had canned after Thanksgiving in place of the bouillon.  I also changed the order in which I added some of the ingredients.  I added the garlic at the same time as the onion.  I also added the bay leaf at the same time I tossed in the carrots and potato.  I cooked the carrots and potato in the broth for quite a bit longer than 4 minutes- I wasn't timing it, but it was at least a half and hour, probably longer.  The carrots were still firm, not at all mushy, at the end.  I can only imagine they would be pretty raw and crunchy if not cooked longer!  I still cooked it the additional 15 minutes after adding the Velveeta, and the veggies were very much to my liking that way.  I added a very healthy pinch of cayenne, and it really added a wonderful kick and flavor to the finished product.  I was going to make a Rotel dip with the other half of my 2 pound Velveeta block, but I would much rather make this soup again- it is THAT good!  Thank you for this easy and delicious recipe crystal0!  I will be making this frequently!  :)

This recipe is great, everyone liked it and someone even said it turned out better than Panera's soup. I added cubed, grilled chicken breast. It was very tasty!

Have made this twice. Made as specified the first time and added some leftover Easter ham the second. Easy to make and tasted great both times.

Excellent soup!  I live in the country, don't always have all ingredients on hand and am used to substituting.  I had cream on hand so used it instead of milk, no Velvetta so used shredded cheddar cheese.  I'm not a fan of bouillon cubes, had both cubes and stock on hand, but tried cubes and water and was really happy the way it turned out!  I cut my frozen broccoli into smaller pieces... next time I'll cut them even smaller and possibly blend 1/2 of the cooked broccoli and add it back to the soup.  Will definitely make again, THANKS for sharing your Christmas Eve tradition with us!

I haven't bought Velveeta since it was about $5.  Not a big fan.  Not sure why I even bothered to try this recipe, but am so glad I did.  Very great soup. I had to modify the vegetables a little based on what I had on hand, but the veggies don't make the difference in this soup.  Adjust to what you like/have.  The broth is wonderful just as it is written.  Very much enjoyed this and will make again.

used turkey both because that's what I had. best soup I've ever had. My husband agrees. Warmed some at work & my co-workers had to try some because it smelled so good. They agree also that it is fantastic. Still have some left and I want to make it again.

Made this last night for 5 people, and it was a hit. I did add some bacon, because I love bacon, but it tasted fabulous. I also used fresh broccoli, and i think next time i'll try a different cheese to see what it does to the flavor, but overall, this is a fantastic recipe.

It's a great recipe! I also made it with fresh broccoli, however it was too salty, so I had to throw in some large chunks of potatoes (that I removed at the same time I took the bay leaf out) to absorb the salt!  From now on I will always read the reviews before I make a recipe!!  Also next time I will definitely only use 3-4 cubes of the bouillon or the the low sodium broth as suggested in one of the reviews!;)

Excellent soup.  Easy and quick to make.  Thank you for sharing.  I did make 2 changes.  Used white pepper instead of cayenne; and used Cabot cheese.  Definitely will make again.
