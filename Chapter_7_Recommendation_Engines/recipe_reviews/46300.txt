I used double brewed coffee & added 2 heaping tbp. of instant coffee. I also increased the sugar to 1 full cup. The coffee flavor was a bit strong...next time I will only add one tbp. of instant coffee. I poured this into an 8 by 12 pan & then cut it into small squares. I layered the squares of gelatin in a parfait glass w/ spoonfuls of whipped cream (one dollop is not going to be enough) & drizzled chocolate syrup & caramel syrup over the layers. Wsa refreshingly different...thanks Mardee!

with some alterations i made, this recipe reminded me of all the coffee parfaits in hawaii[there's a lot of japanese restaurants here ^-^] instead of 3/4 cups sugar i used 1/2 cup and didn't add the lemon juice. when it was set i cut the gelatin into cubes and drizzled some sweetened condensed milk over the top, then served with some softened vanilla ice cream. yum! also, you could drizzle with chocolate sauce instead of the condensed milk, but condensed milk is so popular in japan so it seems more becoming of the dessert :D

Great recipe, I'd been looking for it... useful tip: Use vanilla icecream instead of whipped cream serve some coffee liquor, then the gelatin in cubes, and finally a ball of vanilla ice cream... Try it...

I ate a coffee gelatin dessert at a sushi bar and was looking for a recipe for it.  Found it at your website.  However, I deleted the lemon juice because when I first tried it, it was a bit sour.  Also, as a variation, you could use half-and-half rather than whipped cream.  Thank you for sharing.

It is what it is.  Coffee flavored gelatin.  Easy, fast, an adult taste.  Will have to tinker with the creame drizzle to sweeten it a bit  This recipe is yummy with flavored coffees too.  I recommend pumpkin spice flavored coffee in the autumn!

I knew this was going to be outside the box, but this was a disappointment.  I like gelatin and I love coffee, but there's just not enough coffee flavor.  It almost tasted like sweetened unflavored gelatin.  I did use Splenda in place of the sugar, but the problem wasn't the sweetness, it was the lack of coffee flavor.  This well could be remedied by using extra strong coffee or espresso, but I doubt I'll be making this one again.  Sorry, Mardee, hate to give a bad review, but this just didn't work for us.  In all fairness, it could just be a personal taste preference issue.

I always thought coffee jello was a New England dessert since my mother made it all of the time. It's funny to hear I could have some after my yakisoba. I made this recipe but cut the sugar down to 1/4 cup - 3/4 cup seemed to much.

I served the jello, cut up in squares with choc sauces drizzled across the plate, strawberries and a dab of whip cream on some pieces.  Great light dessert..I did include the lemon and increased the sugar to 1 cup.

This tasted a lot like what you would get in Chinatown.  But next time I make this, I will try using coconut milk in lieu of the water.

This was good.  I wasn't wowed, but it was alright. It was something different to try. Just make sure you have alot of whipped cream on hand.

I subbed 1/2 tsp almond extract for the lemon juice and it was delicious! My son, a coffe drinker who doesn't like sweets, even enjoyed this dessert. Thanks for a great Recipe!

I really didn't think this was anything special. The coffee flavor wasn't strong enough for me, nor was it sweet enough. After a day in the fridge the mixture separated and just was no longer even visually appealing so we tossed it.
