I thought it was very, very good. It is simple and very different. I was a little bit concerned about the sauce at first. It doesn't taste all that great prior to cooking; however the way the sauce bakes into the meat is fantastic. I will make this again without a doubt.

This was very good, but too oily.  I will definitely make it again but cut the oil at least in half.

It was hit! 
I did make one change, and that is I didn't add the oil at all, seeing as I don't think its necessary and it tasted just fine! I had rice on the side with it so that I could eat some of the meat and sauce with the rice....sssooooo good! This will be in my dinner rotation!

I made little meatballs and put them in the oven covered in the sauce from the start.  Served with rice.  Raves from all the fam.  My 6 year old was in anguish when she saw very few were left in the pan. They were licking their plates!  I also used 1/2 the oil, will eliminate next time.  No other changes.

Great recipe - thanks for posting.  1. I followed previous advice and used less oil - no huge loss of flavour and much healthier.  2. I accidentally left the pan in the oven while preheating...worked out great because the turkey patties ended up perfectly browned on BOTH sides...no need to flip and cuts down baking time.  Yummy and husband repeated requesting it now :-)

This was very good. I doubled the sauce so we could spoon it over white rice. Also reduced the amount of oil. My family really enjoyed it. Thanks for sharing.

These are really really good! I was hesitate to try these because I wasn't sure I would like them, but I'm glad I did. I'm always looking for new ways to use  ground turkey meat, and now I have another! The only things I changed was I added 1/4 tsp. of onion powder, instead of 1/2 of a chopped one. And I only used 2 tablespoons of oil. Thanks for the recipe!

It wasn't bad but it tasted like ketchup and we are not ketchup people. I didn't us any oil, I think it should be omitted all together. Next time I'll just make my own sauce from a sauce recipe.

Easy and flavorful, turkey can be dry and the sauce really makes this recipe. A good use for maple syrup too.

I loved these!  Even the next day warmed up they were still very good.  I just served it with green beans.  I followed the directions but used a little less oil like others recommended.  Tasted great!

OMG! This was GREAT!  I was a little concerned after reading a negative review, but it just piqued my interest...the pkg. of turkey was a little larger than 1 lb., but I didn't change the ingredient amounts, except for the salt (I added 1/2 t. kosher salt.)  I did however, change the oil amount to 2 T. instead of the 8 T. I couldn't stand the idea of all that oil, but it was absolutely delicious.  Next time, I'll try it with none. Lower the calories, the better. My husband loved it from first bite. THIS WAS PERFECT and SO EASY! Thanks!

These were excellent. As someone else suggested, I cut the oil in half. Next time I make them, I will eliminate it entirely, because it's just not necessary. Personally, we are not big mustard fans at our house, but I used it anyway. I will be eliminating that as well next time. All in all, a nice, healthier alternative to a beef meatloaf.

This was a good recipe to use as a starting point. After reading the other comments, I left out the oil. Maybe the oil was so the sauce would stick better to the meat? I used a cup of rolled oats instead of bread crumbs and balsamic vinegar. Those were because I didn't have the listed ingredients. I did these as meat balls. I had to make them big to fit in the pan. Next time, I will use two pans to have room for 1 inch meatballs. Ketchup and mustard were just a squirt each so maybe 1T each and 2T of Worchester sauce, just because we like it . I will increase the sauce by 20% next time to have a little more for pouring on the rice. I used unpolished Jasmine rice with good results. The times listed worked perfectly! My wife liked it a lot, wants it again so it worked!

I made this recipe tonight for dinner. I used some of the tips from other reviews. (I made meatballs like someone suggested). I made my own changes as well: I used Jennie - O brand Italian seasoned ground turkey. I seasoned the turkey meat with parsley flakes, cracked black pepper, no salt & a pinch of red pepper flakes. For the sauce: I used apple cider vinegar (instead of white vinegar) & I used 1/2 a tbsp of light tasting extra virgin olive oil. 
I served it with mac n' cheese & corn. Delicious! Next time I would not grease the baking dish, Maybe make a slurry with tbsp of flour or cornstarch to thicken the sauce. Definitely use less bread crumbs. Those will be the only changes I would make. Great recipe and wonderfully creative use of ground turkey

I made it just as recipe was written, I love sweet an sour recipes!  Next time I would use less oil, maybe a bit shy of a 1/4 cup.  I think the turkey would have been dry without so much sauce, my picky non ground turkey loving husband enjoyed this dish!

This was yummy. I did switch out the ketchup for tomato sauce and used less than 1/4 cup of oil. I doubled the sauce which I am glad I did. I served it with brown rice and peas. The kids liked it too.

Wow, these turned out great.  My picky son who has autism spectrum disorder at these without complaining about them being yucky.  I made some modifications to make it gluten free  by replacing the bread crumbs with almond meal.  Will definitely make these again.

This recipe was great! Some times turkey is a little bland the sauce made all the difference. I also cut the oil back to 1/4 cup worked fine. Served patty on top of a bed of rice with some of the sauce spooned over it.  Recipe is a keeper!!

Just ok for me.  Sorry :(   The recipe for the sauce made far too much sauce.  I made it exactly as the recipe stated.  It was ok,but probably won't make again.

VERY tasty, though too oily as others commented. I will eliminate the oil all together. This time, I'm serving as sweet/sour turkey meatballs. My kids and I loved it!

These are absolutely fantastic. I didn't change anything about the patty itself. The only things I did change was I didn't add any oil to the sauce. I lightly coated the pan that the patties were being cooked in so they wouldn't stick. I also substituted sugar free syrup for the maple syrup because I can't have to much sugar due to health reasons. I combined all the sauce ingredients. The sauce was a little thick so I added about 3 tbsp of water to thin it out just a little bit. These patties with the sauce came out amazing. They taste like something that is extremely naughty when in fact they are good for you. I used 93% lean ground turkey. I served this with creamed cauliflower to further make it a healthier alternative. This is a definate keeper!!!

This was simple to make and even easier to eat! I substituted BBQ sauce for ketchup and didn't use any oil. Bake the meatballs 25 minutes the second time, they don't need the 45 since they're smaller than patties. Served over a bed of white rice like others suggested... this was so tasty, I'll be making this again for sure!

At first I was kinda skeptical about this recipe but I went ahead and tried it. I must say this was DELICIOUS my kids loved it so much that my daughter requested to take to lunch the next day. The only thing I didn't add was the oil but other then that it was awesome and next time I will try with bacon and bbq sauce.

I absolutely loved this! I did do some things different. I didn't have an onion on hand, so I used onion powder. I had regular syrup not maple, so I used regular. I also did not use the oil or salt, and I added cornstarch to thicken the sauce! It came out delicious! My husband and my kiddies loooooved it!!

Delicious! I followed the recipe mostly, but decided to make large meatballs out of it. I used 2.5 lb. lean ground turkey, 1 1/4 cups bread crumbs, 1 large diced onion, 3 eggs, and added about 1/4 cup milk to the mixture. Seasoned with salt and pepper. I doubled all the sauce ingredients, completely omitting the oil. I made 1/4 cup size meatballs and placed them into two greased 9 x 13 dishes, divided the sauce and covered with aluminum foil. Baked at 350 for 30 minutes covered and 20 minutes uncovered. So delicious and moist, leftovers were delicious for days and we even had some to freeze. YUM!

Very easy recipe that changed our whole family's opinion about ground turkey.   Not anything gourmet but a great weeknight dish.

This was okay, but not my favorite. I found the sauce to be overwhelming. Really sweet and tangy. The first bites were good, but by the end of the meal I didn't want to finish. I think these would be great as an appetizer, but not for a whole meal.

This was awesome. Made according to recipe but added extra garlic and only used a tablespoon or so of oil as many others suggested. My husband and I loved it. Will make again but double the sauce!

We did meatballs and left out the oil like suggested. Our 5-year-old was plugging her nose and would not even try them. As they cooked, the vinegar smell filled the house. It was too much for her...and now we are airing out the house. The sauce is VERY sweet. My 10-year old had seconds...so there's that.

After reading some reviews I only put half of the called amount of oil.  Yummy recipe, my toddler ate all of it on her plate.  Will make again!

Oh my goodness! The sauce is very tasty! I didn't have pure maple syrup so I used regular pancake syrup and added a little honey.  It turned out wonderful, I will definitely make this again.

I just put the patties in the oven. As I mixed up the sauce I made some changes to it. I used Olive Oil (same amount), Red Wine Vinegar, REAL VT maple syrup, & a local chunky mustard. I am a fan of using local when I can. So far it tastes unbelievable and I can't wait to serve this to my family!

Followed recipe aside from cutting oil by half and using apple cider vinegar.  Very good. Patties never really "browned" once the sauce was added and I don't see how you can "drizzle" the sauce on the patties without having most of it just left sitting in the pan. Tasty and texture was good, but would taste better if it were a little more 'browned'.

I think this is a great meal for kids but as for adults it should be served as an hors d'oeuvre not as a main. I removed the vegetable oil like others recommended and agree that it's not needed. I added one habanero pepper, which gave it some nice heat and toned down the sweetness. It's an interesting idea that introduced me to sweet & sour sauce. Thanks!
