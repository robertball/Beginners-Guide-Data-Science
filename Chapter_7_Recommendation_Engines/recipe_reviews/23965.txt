This was delicious BUT I made a lot of modifications. 

Following other reviews, I doubled the sauce part and tripled the cheese. I even had to take out some of the macaroni because there wasn't enough sauce to make it as cheese as I like. 

I used some chedder, pepper jack & gorgonzola. I mixed it all together instead of layering. I mixed in breadcrumbs with the parmesean cheese. I added white pepper, garlic powder & onion powder. I also mixed in a lot of jalapeno peppers & a little bit of juice. My boyfriend is a jalapeno fiend.

The result is delicious! If you're expecting stovetop mac & cheese w/ processed cheese...this isn't the recipe for you! This is BAKED mac & cheese! 

I will add this to my notebook of recipes to make again!

I made this for my in-laws for our Christmas Eve dinner and everyone loved it! I read some of the reviews beforehand (which I highly recommend) and decided based on those to use a smaller pan so that it would not dry out (I used a Corningware 2.8 liter dish). I didn't really measure the cheese but used I'm sure more than the original recipe called for. I also added bread crumbs to the top for a twist. I followed all the other measurements exactly. The sour cream component makes the difference I think. What I like about this dish is that it's more than just a cheese sauce you melt and pour over pasta as if it were from a box. It's a real old fashioned mac and cheese bake like the ones I grew up with--very cheesy, moist. And it didn't take that long to make. I highly recommend this recipe.

I added a full can of the evaporated milk and added a healthy slab of Velveeta after reading other reviews of this recipe. On it's own it's a good recipe, with a bit of tweaking it's a very good recipe.

My hubby and I just loved this recipe. It's quick and easy to make and very tasty. I think maybe the people that complained about it being too dry may have used a 9x13 pan. The recipe doesn't state what size to use so I made it in a 8x8 pan. I think a larger pan would cause the pasta to cook too quickly and become very dry.

I love this recipe.  Very tasty and not alot of work!  I made it for a family pot luck and I have been asked for the recipe many times, there is also a request for it at the next Baby shower coming up.  I did make one change, when I double the recipe, I used 3 eggs instead of 4 and added an extra cup of milk to make it a little creamier, Where it is such a large amount I found it needed the little extra

After reading the reviews, I double the sauce but not the eggs & it was fabulous! I made enough for 40 people (using 2 large pans) & it was easy to make the entire batch at one time. There would not have been enough sauce if I had not doubled it.

As suggested by many others, I doubled the ingredients for the milk mixure as well as the cheeses.  My whole family loved it.  I'm already being hounded for another batch!

My family loves this recipe and I have made it numerous times.  My friends always ask me to make it for get togethers too. I dont change much - I just leave out the butter on top (dont need any more fat for such a high calorie recipe).   Thanks for sharing!

I made a lot of changes, but it turned out to be the best Macaroni and cheese I have ever had! Used 1 cup of milk instead of the evaporated, a 500ml tub of sour cream, and 3 cups of cheese. I used half extra old white cheddar, and for the other half I used a leftover bag of Kraft Italiano cheese. (mozzarella, emmental, parmesan and provolone.) I also added added a pinch or two of garlic powder and a very very finely chopped jalapeno pepper. After topping it with the cheese and melted butter I put a good layer of panko crumbs. The jalapeno (which was well cleaned, I used it for flavour not spice) and panko crust made it amazing! There was plenty of sauce for the noodles. This has gone into my 'favourites' book!!!

Well as I write this review, I am sitting at my desk at work actually having leftovers from Thanksgiving. I was somewhat please with this recipe. I followed the advise from some of the other reviews and I do agree that you WILL NEED more sauce. I also suggest that you do not use the whole package of noodles unless you 2 1/2 the sauce. I was pretty satified with my macaroni but if I would have put more sauce in I would be extremely happy. It was ok, and the sour cream makes it taste better. I did not use any butter in my recipe, I do not think it is needed. Other than that it was a good recipe.

I have made this three times now, and each time did something different but each time was delicious in different ways!

The first time I used Reduced fat Cheddar cheese, Fat free milk instead of evaporated milk, and whole wheat elbows. This was a little bit healthier then the original recipe but still delicious!

The second time, I made it for a Work Holiday party and I doubled the Sour Cream mixture and added extra Cheddar Cheese. Then I accidently added "Sweetened Condensed milk" instead of Evaporated. Most of my co-workers loved the sweet twist! I didn't though, I don't like sweet food.

Then for Thanksgiving I made it again, used Evaporated milk, Doubled the Cheese, doubled the sour cream mixture, and added extra Seasoned salt, & pepper but only used 3 eggs instead of doubling! This was absoultely delicious and now my family wants this for every get together!

One more tip... I always add a layer of bread crumbs to the top along with the parmesan cheese! This makes it crispy and makes it have a great presentation!

This is an absolutely delicious dish! Thanks!

Wow-- it was so easy!  Condensed milk comes in 12 ounce cans, and I didn't want to have a partial can sitting in the fridge, so I used the whole thing.  Turned out great!  We also added seasoned bread crumbs to the top, and it added a nice texture!  Forgot the butter-- no one missed it.  A 2.5-quart (80-ounce) chafing dish was the perfect size.

The people who gave this a bad review doesn't know how to cook. It was good and creamy. of course I made some minor changes. I didn't follow the directions to the exact amount. That's where everyone that gave it a bad review went wrong. I just added everything to the pan and mixed it all together. I didn't add egg. Just a lot of sour cream, butter, and a little regular milk. I added a ton of cheese. I used shredded sharp cheddar, shredded monterey jack, and some mozzarella. it turned out creamy. I just added enough stuff to where it looked right for the amount I was making.

I was skeptical to make this just because the reviews were mixed, but I took a lot of the reviewers advice. I used 12 oz of evaporated milk, one egg, and not quite double but more cheese and it was fantastic!! We loved it.

This Mac n cheese was amazing! As others reviewers said DOUBLE THE SAUCE! I actually had to double the recipe and triple the sauce because it was for more people. Don't be afraid to be as generous as you want with the cheese. I added loads of cheddar, and about a cup of grated Parmesan. Instead of layering, I mixed the sauce in a bowl, then stirred in the cheese and Mac in the same bowl. Then pored in the dish and voila, it was perfect. I also added white pepper (instead of black) and garlic powder. Next time I will try to with more cheeses. This is definitely a keeper!

I didn't read the other reviews until AFTER I'd made this and it came out AWESOME!  VERY minor changes .. no evap'd milk so I used reg milk same amount, and did not add seasoning salt.  I eyeballed the cheese using both Cheddar and Mozarella - almost a full bag of each using layering technique. This was DELISH and super cheesy .. my son came back for 2nds and then asked if he could have for breakfast the next day!! THANK YOU!!! Saved this for another day!!!

Very good, followed other users advise like add a whole can of evaporated milk, add more cheese and use a smaller pan.  It turned out excellent and my two daughters (the critics here) loved it and ate their meals in record time.

I halved the package of pasta but kept everything else the same. I am glad I did because reviewers said it was dry with the whole amount of macaroni. I used a Tarragon Cheddar and a Lionza Swiss from Fiscalani cheese. I baked mine covered for 30 mins and topped with bread crumbs and baked an additional 10 mins. This was really good and I will make again.

I really liked this recipe.  The changes I made were:  I used 1 12oz can of evaporated milk, and doubled the cheeses.  I mixed it altogether instead of layering, with the exception of the fresh paremesan cheese that went on top.  Thank you for sharing your recipe!

Good flavor but a little on the dry side even though I used only half of the macaroni. Thought it would be much creamier.

This is a good start for a recipe. I made it with twice the amount of the milk mixture, and i think almost three cups of cheddar. I also stirred the pasta with the milk mixture and poured that into the 8x8 dish, and then layered cheese, rather than layering the pasta and milk mixture seperatly. I recommend adding some of your own spices to the mixture - i used some white pepper and onion powder to give it a little more of a bite. I also topped it with bread crumbs to give some mixed textures. It turned out wonderfully, the most important thing to remember is you need LOTS of the milk mixture, twice as much as recommended, and LOTS and LOTS of cheese.

I picked this recipe because it looked super quick and easy with minimal ingredients and didn't recquire the need to make a white sauce. The flavor is way too bland. It needs spices; garlic, onion, dry mustard and maybe a pinch of cayenne. I followed the advice of other reviews and used the sauce on only 8 oz of pasta shells.Which was good, since 16 oz would have made it too dry. I did not layer the ingredients. I stirred them all together and  poured into a 8x8 pan. I used fat free sour cream and 2 % sharp cheddar. Instead of butter I drizzled with roasted garlic olive oil. I went ahead and added the whole 5 oz can of evaporated milk. Couldn't see throwing away that last ounce of milk. Has potential but as, flavorless.

I've made this a few times; I used mozzarella instead of parmesan once, but both taste wonderful.
Always a great hit! ;)

This is really good! I will make this again! I will leave the butter out next time because as the cheese cooks, it seems to make its own "grease". I may leave out 1 egg next time too. How can this be creamier? Maybe adding more sour cream? I did add extra cheese too. Pretty good! Ive never used Parmesean in Mac & Cheese, what a great surprise! Great Job!  :O)

This recipe makes a lot!  I changed things a little, as do most people.  I used an 8 ounce block of chedder and an 8 ounce block of swiss.  I omitted the parmesean since I didn't have any.  I didn't have all the sour cream either, so I only used 4 ounces.  To make this not so dry, as others have complained it was, I added an entire stick of melted margarine, rather then the 1 tablespoon it called for.  This helped the "dryness" factor and improved the taste a lot.  I used italian bread crumbs on the top.  The whole family loved this one!  Next time, I think I'll make a cassarole out of it with added meat and veggies!  YUMMY!

This recipe is a keeper for me :).  I've been looking for a good Mac & Cheese recipe for months.  After watching a few of the videos on the site, I decided to give this recipe a try.  I did double the sauce receipe (minus the eggs).  I mixed in 1 cup of sharp shredded cheddar cheese into the cheese sauce, and I also mixed in the Parmesean cheese into the cheese sauce, as well.  Mixed my noodles into the cheese mixture.  I sprayed my pan with Pam, poured half of the mixture into the pan, topped it with about a cup of sharp cheddar cheese, poured the rest of the mixture into the pan, and topped that off with enough sharp cheddar cheese to cover the mixture.  Sprinkled some seasoned bread crumbs across the top, and poured the melted butter on.  Cooked for 20 minutes at 350 degrees.  Turned out pretty tasty!

My  kids watch this cook in the oven like they might watch their favorite movie. A slight addition is that I combine rice crispies, shredded cheese, and butter, and then use this as the topping. It gives it a nice crunchy texture, and prevents the top noodles from getting overcooked.

I used Trader Joes brand fat free greek yogurt instead of sour cream.  This was very good, creamy, and delicious.  I did add more salt than it called for.

Very good and cheesy.  I listened to the reviews and doubled the sauce mixture.  And, I added some extra seasonings (cayenne, garlic powder, seasoned salt, etc.)

This was quite a yummy baked mac and cheese!  After reading other reviews, I cut the pasta down (used about 2 cups of whole wheat elbow) and kept the sauce ingredients as is except only used 1 egg.  I think even doing this, I could have either used a bit less pasta or increased the sauce a bit.  I ended up mixing fresh parm with fresh bread crumbs to the top and baked it covered for 30 min and then uncovered for 10-15, also omitting the butter.  Great recipe, will try again with more sauce or less pasta!

I thought this recipe was terrible.  You think mac and cheese is good comfort food, but I really didn't like this recipe.  I added italian bread crumbs on top, and my family said that was the best part.  I don't plan to make this again.

I have made this about 3 times and everytime I do I have done things a little different.  I have always used more of what it calls for, doubled or almost doubled it.  It comes out great everytime!  If you use this recipe as a guide you cant go wrong.  Easy and yummy!  Everyone that has tried it wants to know the recipe.  Thanks so much for this, have been looking for a good recipe for about 10yrs or more.

Yes, this is a good base recipe.  But I followed some advice from other reviewers.  You  definitely need 2 cans of evaporated milk.  I just used my own judgement with the cheese and also added velveeta.  The only thing I forgot to do was add the season salt and pepper.  However, the mac and cheese came out great.  I will definitely make this again with the modifications.

My husband and I loved it!  I added the  breadcrumb  topping from John Thorne's mac & cheese recipe (Toasted Bread Crumbs, 1 cup fresh bread crumbs, 1 pinch salt, 1 1/2 tbsp unsalted butter -- melted) and it was absolutely delicious.  Definitely a keeper!

This is a good mac and cheese but not the best.. I was out of shredded cheddar cheese so I used deli sliced cheese that I tore up into pieces!! I used regular milk in place of the evaporated milk and left out the eggs well because I was out of them.

Kids loved it!  Used 1 cup evap. milk, 3/4 stick of butter and reduced fat sour cream; didn't layer as recipe calls, but  mixed milk mixture all together  then poured over the hot pasta, stirred in cheese and butter and sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  Baked in covered round casserole for 20 minutes and baked uncovered for an additional 10 minutes.  Very easy.  This is not a Velveeta type mac and cheese, but really very moist.

Delicious, Fast & Easy Recipe!   This was very good!  I did throw in a little Fancy Shredded Parmesan cheese in with the cheddar and then used that to sprinkle on the top and everyone loved it.

Hmmm...I have made this recipe twice now.  The first time it turned out wonderfully.  The second time it didn't turn out so good.  I'm thinking that it was probably an error on my part, although I'm not sure what was different.  I think I will make this again though, because the first time was so wonderful.

I made this as a side dish for Thanksgiving dinner. The flavor is there, but I should have read through the reviews before attempting. This version lacked moisture and the 'creamy' factor. If I had to redo it, I would definitely add more evap milk and some Velveeta. I reheated the macaroni in the oven which dried it out even more. My brother-in-law even teased me about it and dubbed it Macaroni Meatloaf, yet he had two servings. Not bad but could be better.

Like others, I thought this recipe is a good start but needs help. I added more a little more cheese and some chopped onion and it still was a little bland. Next time I will add much more cheddar same amount of parmesan, more milk, 1 less egg, more salt and possibly some ground beef, stewed tomatoes and more onion. Thanks Daphanie for getting me started.

I baked this in a 9x13 inch pan and it came out very dry.  It seemed too dry even before I baked it.  I think it needs more milk and a lot more cheese. I used Sargento mild cheddar cheese and the whole thing tasted bland.  If you like your macaroni and cheese rich, moist and cheesy, then this recipe is not for you.

I have made this a few times. Comes out great  everytime! I do double/triple the amount of cheese and I use a whole can of milk. I don't layer mine either, I just mix everything together then put an extra layer of cheese on top. My hubby loves it!

I tried this version of baked mac & cheese and it turned out well. I made a small adjustment and added more cheese. The next time I will try more of the milk mixture as well. I am satisfied and will try it again.

This is the one and only mac and cheese I have ever enjoyed (seriously!).  I recommend using an 8x8 pan to avoid the drying out issue.

I doubled the cheese sauce (not the eggs) and didn't add butter and it still tasted great.  I sliced strips of colby jack from a block and placed it on the botton with a *little* bit of velveeta, muenster and shredded cheese.   Then I poured 1/2 the cheese sauce in the bottom. I placed the noodles on top of this, then added the rest of the sauce on top and added more cheese.  I took it out after 10 minutes and stirred everything together and baked it for the remainder of the time. Everything turned out great and cheesy!

I used double the milk and sour cream and it was really good.  I just wish that it was creamier.  I don't think I had enough cheese, cheddar or monetary jack.  We threw out our cheese grater and I had to cut the cheese in small thin slices to give the texture of the shredded cheese which took a long time to do.  I also cooked it longer because it seemed not cooked in the middle, that may have caused the lack of creaminess.

Really yummy, rich, filling.  I made some modifications - doubled the evaporated milk, used cavatappi noodles, added more cheese and put the parm exclusively on top.  I didn't use butter and put in a lot of garlic salt.  Sometimes I add a package of thawed frozen spinach.  Sometimes I substitute plain whole milk yogurt for sour creme.  It is a winning casserole!

This was easy to make but it was super bland.  I even doubled the sauce mix, doubled the amount of cheese, added onion powder, garlic and cayenne and it still didn't taste like anything.  The sauce was never "done" (and it curdled) while the noodles overcooked.  It needs a lot more salt and butter.

This was wonderful. I added some Velveta just to give it a slight creamy texture but still the dish came out very homstyle baked mac. I also used rice pasta because we eat wheat free. Most rice pastas can get a bit mushy with mac & cheese but with baking it, it came out tasting just the same as regular noodles. My whole family loved it and I'll be sure to make this again and again.

Best homemade mac n' cheese I've ever made!  I think it's the sour cream that gives it the extra creaminess the other recipes had been missing.  Very good!

It turned out really eggy. The texture was disappointing when I was expecting creamy and got chunky. Ususally my husband wolfs down whatever I make, but for this he didn't. It was a little bland too.

My wife enjoyed this quite a bit, but I did not.  Sour cream is not a subtle flavor, and its way too strong for me personally to enjoy.  I guess if you like sour cream flavored mac and cheese thats really easy to make, this is for you.  If you don't care for a sour cream flavor in your mac and cheese, this probably isn't the recipe for you.

Very dry, although flavor good, no one liked it. Had read the reviews & doubled the milk, sour cream & parmesan.  More than doubled cheddar and added 1 1/2c Velveeta.I took this to a cookout & it sat for about 1 hour before we ate so maybe that was problem but kept it warm with towels not in oven.

Not a bad recipe ... made it for Thanksgiving, and while everyone liked it, nobody went back for seconds. I would have given it 4 stars if it wasn't such an expensive dish to prepare.

I've used this recipe a few times now with great results each time. I adjust it slightly but overall this is a great base to use and a wonderful starter. I add Velveeta as a previous review suggested and I scale it down a bit because it's just my husband and I, but I use the same amount of evaporated milk and sour cream.

This was very strong tasting.  I added extra cheese and only 12 ounces of macaroni.  I served it as a main dish, but would serve it as a side dish next time.  I loved it, but husband didn't mind it.

Yeah - 5 stars from me! After reading your reviews, I added 1/2 onion and microwaved it with the 2 tbsp butter. I added dry mustard, a touch of cayenne pepper. As some of you suggested, I added a whole can of milk and doubled the cheese. I served 50 servings of this at our soup kitchen. They loved it and no one said "where's the meat?"  
Thanks for everyone's help in taking a good recipe and making it awesome!

This recipe was great. I increased the sauce because it didn't look like enough. I added an extra egg, used a whole can (12 oz) of evaporated milk, and a 16 oz container of sour cream. I also threw in a tsp of garlic powder and lots of extra cheese. It was huge hit.

Having never made macaroni and cheese from scratch before, I wanted to try a recipe that was relatively easy to make.  This one hit the mark, and it was very tastey.  A great recipe to make if you're looking for a traditional dish without a lot of extras.

If you are looking for a creamy, cheesy macaroni and cheese, this is NOT it.  This was very dry and too flavorless, even after adding more milk.  I've tried many kinds of macaroni and cheese and this was my least favorite.

I thought this recipe was great because I had most of the ingredients in my kitchen.  There were a couple things that I changed: I covered the whole dish with cheddar cheese since 1 1/2 cups didn't seem like enough.  Also, I decided not to pour melted butter on the top.  This was definetly a crowd pleaser!

I added a full can of fat free evaporated milk, replaced the sour cream with 2 single serve plain greek yogurts, and used 1 package of fat free cheddar cheese and 1 package of reduced fat cheddar cheese. I topped this with panko bread crumbs and it turned out great and is low fat!

This. Is. Delicious. I halved the recipe because it was just for me and my toddler's lunch. Super easy to throw together with whatever type of pasta you have sitting in the pantry (in my case it was a combo of shells and orzo). I did follow the suggestions of others and added extra cheese and bread crumbs to the top. Amazing. Toddler Approved. Oh and the leftovers are great reheated the next day too!

I was asked to bring Macaroni and Cheese to a pot-luck dinner. When I found this recipe I made it one weekend for my grandson and me to try, followed the recipe exactly. There was hardly any leftovers. Now for the pot-luck I boiled more macaroni so I added 1 extra egg, more cheddar cheese and more sour cream. All the ladies (there was 8) asked for the recipe. A keeper for sure!

Not bad. Ended up putting a full can of milk and extra cheese after reading the reviews, as well as chopped up left over ham from Easter dinner (boiled it in with the pasta in order to reduce the saltiness), and used penne as I didn't have macaroni. Also threw in a pinch of cayenne as I think it goes great with old cheddar. Lots of leftovers as it made so much. Will be making it again.

The cheese part was clumpy / did not turn into a sauce. Maybe I did something wrong for the cheese. This recipe would probably be a lot better with half as much pasta as called for.

I was more interested in the Southern Mac & Cheese that was highlighted in the video and talked about "stirred, custard-like sauce" that is poured over the top of the cooked macaroni. 
I did not care for this version.

With a few changes this recipe is a great start for awesome baked mac-n-chez. I started with a 12oz. box of pasta. I doubled the cheese mixture except for the eggs and substituted swiss for parmesan. I also added a little cumin and brown mustard to the mix like my mom does. I then added frozen peas, topped it off w/ crushed bbq potato chips, and omitted the butter. Amazing! My fiancee says its the way mac-n-chez should taste :). The sour cream is the winning ingredient. Next time I'll try more sour cream and monteray jack cheese.

A wonderful recipe.  I gave it 4 stars because it could have been a little bit moister even though I took it out of the oven just as the top was browning.  Next time I will make more of the milk mixture.  Also, this would be great with chicken or tuna added.  The egg in the recipe makes the dish satisfying.  Husband liked it, I will make it again.

This was good! I had some bacon in the fridge that I needed to use, so I cooked it up and used it in the recipe.  I also added a little bit of red pepper flakes to  the milk mixture to add more flavor.  I have tried many different macaroni and cheese recipes, and my husband said this one was the best so far.

It is the only Baked Macaroni and Cheese I have tried so I don't have much to compare it to... all I can say is everyone that tried it really loved it and asked when I was going to make it again... easy enough to make... and tasted great... I put this in a 9x13 pan and doubled the evaporated milk and added about another 4 ounce or so of sour cream.... i also didn't measure my shredded chedder cheese I just put on enough to cover with a good layer...

I just made this for dinner and was skeptical after reading other reviews.  I have to say this was very good and will make again.  This was my first time making Mac and Cheese and will use this recipe from now on.  Will add more cheese next time and top with bread crumbs but other than that wouldn't change a thing.  It's a keeper!  Thanks

I made this last year for a cub scout banquet for my son's troop. It was a big hit and there weren't any leftovers. I made another batch a few days later because I loved it so much. Making it again this year for banquet, and for thanksgiving. Make sure and double the sauce mixture except for the eggs. Also if your someone who wants a creamy macaroni this probably won't be the recipe for you. Use a smaller pan then the 9x13. I personally always use a 3qt casserole dish, it seems to keep the macaroni moist. This is a great recipe for the people who like their macaroni and cheese to be thicker.

Ok, so I've reviewed this before but brought it back out and made some changes. Here's what I did: I used shells instead of elbow noodles because it's what I had on hand. I used 1/2 c. of coffee creamer, instead of evaporated milk; like half n' half only richer. I used half cheddar cheese, half colby jack cheese. Rather than just salt and pepper, I added 1/2 tsp. chili powder, 1/2 tsp. onion powder, and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder. Again, as I stated in my previous review, I used about 4 T. of butter. Except for the Parmesan and butter, I mixed everything together in a big bowl THEN put it in the greased baking dish. I sprinkled oodles of Parmesan cheese on top, then poured my butter over that. Also, I covered the dish with aluminum foil before putting it in the oven. This keeps it from drying out. Maybe this is a given but the recipe doesn't say to do that.

I loved the recipe.  I did make a few modifications to it. First of all I doubled the cheese and milk and used 3 eggs.  I also fresh jalapenos and chicken breast. It turned out great and filling.  we had leftovers for a couple nights.

Easy and tasty but would have preferred cheesier/creamier -- even tho added more based on other recipes.  I used the entire can (12oz) of reduced fat 2% condensed milk and 2 cups to shredded mild cheddar.  I mixed all ingredients instead of layering.

I really liked that this recipe didn't have Velveeta in it and yet still tasted great. I would say definitely use sharp Cheddar cheese...also, I didn't have a 16 oz pkg of macaroni, only an 8 oz, but only slightly decreased the rest of the ingredients. So essentially by default I doubled the sauce part like others suggested.

This is a good base for beginners but most definatly needs some tweeking! Then again some may like a less moist Macaroni and cheese. Love the overall flavor just needs more creamy consitency.

I thought this was really good - a tangier spin on regular baked macaroni and cheese.  I was out of evaporated milk so I used extra regular milk which made the sauce runnier than I think it would've been if I had followed the recipe exactly.  I did use a little extra cheese on top.  Will definitely make this again.

I have to say I was disappointed in this recipe. I don't know if it was something that I did to make it turn out wrong or what. I halfed the recipe (since its just me and my husband)and it seemed to taste like scrambled eggs and cheese with noodles.

This was ok, but kind of bland and messy in my opinion.  Lots of leftovers.

My whole family loved this recipe.  It wasn't dry at all and had a great flavor.  I did add about a cup more grated cheese, though, because the one and half cups just didn't seem like enough.

This recipie was very bland and dry and the milk mixture curdled after the macaroni and cheese was baked. I was disappointed because I served this with my Easter Meal. Not recommended.

I loved this mac and cheese. My whole family loved it, even my very picky mother who usually only like her own cooking..This is a great compliment coming from her.My husband had me add some bacon bits to it.  He is from South Africa and they like things a little different.

I've been searching for a new macaroni and cheese recipe after using the same one for years.  I found the best one I've ever tasted.  The sour cream really puts an extra tang in the cheese sauce.  Just pouring the sauce mixture over the macaroni, instead of making a white sauce like I've done in other recipes, makes this a quick and easy meal accompaniment.  It's a permanent fixture at our house now.

This is not a saucy type Mac n Cheese. It is old school.  I made it as is, though I  wasn't sure if there was enough sauce. But I wanted to make it like the recipe said (for the most part) When I put the mac in the pan I put the sauce on top, then stirred it around to cover all the mac. I did layer the cheese and added extra. There can never be enough cheese. I also topped it with the french fried onions (in the can) crushed. This was delicious!

Came out great for me. Added extra 1/4 cup of evaporated milk, 14 oz of sour cream instead of 8oz, regular salt instead of seasoning salt, and used 8oz of extra sharp cheddar with 8oz of pepper jack cheese for more kick. Came out delicious and the sour cream balanced out any spicy-heat from pepper jack cheese.

I was looking for a mac and cheese that didn't require a million ingredients and a lot of time.Being native to the south, my family and I are pretty picky about our baked mac & cheese. This is the first one that I've made myself and actually liked. I didn't expect this recipe to turn out badly, but I also didn't expect it to be SO good. I had to use Rotelle pasta, because that's just what I had laying around. I also doubled the cheese sauce (I used Sargento's Four State Chef's Blend)  and tweaked the seasonings a bit. (Tony Chachare's "More Spice", and a few pinches each of cayenne, ground mustard, and white pepper.) I topped it with cheese, and then topped that with a Panko/butter mixture. Thank you so much for sharing!

Wonderful flavor! I didn't have evaporated milk so used 2% and a little too much of it because it was slightly soupy. My mistake. I added a dash of cayenne and garlic powder and more cheese. I had to mix together after cooking to better blend the ingredients, but the taste can't be beat! Next time I will use the evaporated milk and mix everything before it cooks, but there WILL be a next time!

I made this for a work Potluck, I used some creative "Fall Leaves" pasta that I had purchased at Home Goods.  It was very simple and a huge success.  I did add a full can of evap milk, also a slab of velvetta, like another reviewer suggested.  I will make this again and again on cold days!  Delicious

Excellent recipe! Reminds me of the kind of macaroni and cheese that my mom used to make. I made a few modifications and my finance loved it! I think it doesn't call for enough cheese though. I tripled the cheese, but used fat free cheddar cheese to make it healthier. I also substituted the evaporated milk for almond milk and left out the sour cream. I instead added some garlic and herb salt free seasoning and it came out fantastic! Very versatile recipe and easy to make!

Hubby doesn't like macaroni & cheese, but he liked this one. I used Greek yogurt (plain) and nonfat milk instead of sour cream and evaporated milk, because that's what I had on hand. Instead of doubling the sauce as recommended by some, I halved the macaroni. Delicious.

Very nice recipe!  Loved the crust!  I did use a little less pasta and juiced it up by using 1.5 cups milk, .5 cup sour cream and 1 cup of heavy cream in place of just milk.  (I was craving rich comfort food).  My husband who is not a mac and cheese lover told me three times how good this was!  The spices are perfect.  Lovely.

Oh yes!!!!!!! Just what I've been looking for! Will try Gouda next time. Definitely use Panko crumbs on top & then top that with butter & grated Parmesan. OH SO GOOD! As others stated, double the cheese amount.

I don't enjoy macaroni and cheese made with processed cheese and was so happy to find a simple recipe with solid, "real" ingredients. I made it the way it was suggested and enjoyed it, but for the future I would probably add more cheese, maybe sharp cheddar, and will probably try it with more evaporated milk as others have suggested. My 1 and 2 years are somewhat picky eaters and they both gobbled this up and asked for more. This reminds me of a recipe an old friend used to make - I was in heaven :)

I was so upset with this recipe.  My husband and kids who love Mac n Cheese refused to eat this.  I did not blame them.  I followed this recipe exactly the way it was stated and it was so dry and lacked the creamy texture and flavor.    Others who reviewed this had great things to say about this recipe but it did not work out that way for me.  It was so embarassing.  My husband ended up making Kraft mac n cheese to please them.

Very versitile recipe. Very close to the classic mac and cheese i have been looking for. I chose this recipe due to the very small amount of butter used..which I believe could be omitted completely. Initially, I did not add the full amount of seasoning salt..seemed like a lot..but allowed peeps to season their own individual servings..worked out great that way. I used a variety of cheeses..just what I had left over  ..italian..provolone....cheddar...worked great. I could add a little more milk and egg next time..we'll see how it turns out. Might add some scallions next time. Overall, Its a keeper! :) Everyone loved it.

This recipe was fine, especially since I already had all of the ingredients. I would not call this a crowd favorite, but It pretty good. I added a little bit of italian bread crumbs onto the top for additional flavor, which really helped. I would say that this dish could have used more sauce.

Delicious just the way it is!  I doubled the recipe, added extra cheese, skipped the butter & actually didn't have enough parmesan cheese so I only used a very small amount.   Loved it!

This is a very good recipe! I did make some changes though. I used 12 oz of evaporated milk (the 1/2 wasn't enough for me). I also added 1 tablespoon of nutmeg and added more parm cheese. This was my first time every making real macaroni and cheese & I will use the recipe again.

This was not very good.  It was extremely dry and not cheesy at all.  I honestly think it is a horrible mac n cheese recipe...such a disappointment.

I didn't really care for this recipe. It was easy to make, but very dry and too sweet. There was more macaroni than there was sauce, and it wasn't cheesy enough. I won't be making it again.

I made this and I'll never make it from the box again!  Soooo tasty.  When you eat it the next day, just add some condensed milk, 1/2 & 1/2, or whatever, stir while heating and it's even better the next time around!  Heck, add more cheese if you want - there are no rules!

Wow, this is the closest Mac & Cheese recipe to my grandmother's I've come across yet.  I did omit the sour cream and parmesan cheese--just because she never made it that way, and I added more evaporated milk (to nearly cover in pan) and shredded cheddar cheese (2 cups).  Yummy!

I have NEVER liked macaroni/cheese, being from the south everyone thinks you must, I usually make it from the box and add extra with it for my family, this Thanksgiving my dtr and I were looking for something different to make along with our traditional dinner and I came across this recipe, it had sour cream in it so I tried it out, and OH! boy I ate some two days in a row. I was COMPLETELY surprised that I ate it. So now this and only this macaroni/cheese recipe is in my recipe box. Thanks to whomever sent it in.

My 4 year old Mac and cheese addict LOVES this recipe! I did alter it just a a bit. I didnt quite use the whole 1 lb box of noodles and I more than doubled the amount of cheese. I was out of evaporated milk, so I used about 3/4 cup of regular milk. Also, I added in about 1 cup of cottage cheese and some garlic powder. My husband hasn't tasted it yet- but if my picky kid will eat it then I'll absolutely make it again!!

I tweaked too.  I added more cheese and blobbed on some cheese whiz. I stirred well (not layered) and topped with cheddar and parm.  Great recipe, kids loved.  I will make again but maybe add a few dashes of hot sauce.

This is a good basic recipe.  I took the advice of others and spiced it up with a half of a sauted onion, garlic powder and a pinch of cayenne.  I also added more cheese, about a cup of swiss, to the cheddar.

Quite bland. Used much less macaroni then recipe called for and added more milk as suggested which helped. Also added more cheese. Following the original recipe would not have been a good idea. But is a good place to start from.

I followed the recipe exactly, except that I put in 2 cups of cheddar, and added some other cheese that I grated.  I still think there could have been more cheese in it.  HOWEVER, it was still very delicious, not bland as some complained of.  I will definitely make it again, but add more cheese next time.  Thanks for a quick and easy receipt!

This recipe was easy to make, however was not as creamy and cheesy as I would have liked.  Also, the combo of cheeses and sour cream seemed to 'curdle' in the recipe.  The taste was good, but if I was to make again, I would certainly double the cheeses.  Thanks for the recipe.

served it to 25 people at Christmas & they all wanted more, more, more. It must have been the sour cream? Thank you Daphanie.

Yum! Perfect comfort food for a cold afternoon. I had thirds. For company, I'd probably stick with the "Allie's" Mac & Cheese recipe on this site (it's more time consuming though).

This was my first attempt at homemade macaroni and cheese. I was not sure of the size pan I should use, but chose 9x13. After adding the ingredients together, I could see that the sauce was not covering the macaroni, which did not seem right AT ALL! So, seeing this problem I created & added another sauce mix(sourcream,milk,egg,etc..)
After mixing this, i got back on line to read the reviews... my recommendation is to always read reveiws first! then add ingredients! It is currently baking.. i will write tomorrow to tell you how it tastes.

This macaroni and cheese is soooo yummy.  I prepare it often as a side dish but it also makes a great main course served with vegetables and cornbread.  My five year old and three year old twins can't get enough of it.  Plus, it's simple enough to make for lunch too.

this recipe came out a little bland and a little .... chunky. I went into this recipe very optimistically b/c i was searching for a mac and cheese recipe that included sour cream. I cooked in an 8x8 pan as suggested to keep it from drying out, but it came out lumpy, and with no distinguishable flavor... Add more cheese people if you want to make this work... a lot more cheese!

This has become my standard mac 'n cheese recipe. And since we have a toddler, I make a LOT of it. Put more cheese in  it though...otherwise it IS a little dry. I add an additional cup of grated cheddar. Yummy!

i was very dissapointed with this recipe, it is very dry and very bland, also the milk mixture coagulated after it was cooked, maybe that was because i used a light sour cream... i wont make it again.

Excellent Mac and cheese recipe. The first time I made it I misread the instructions, and made a topping mixture of parm cheese and butter that I spread over the top, came out great anyway. This is my families prefered macaroni and cheese dish now, and is usually requested when we have company.

This completely satisfied my adult craving for a comfort food fix tonight. It's just enough cheese. Not gooey, not dry. The only thing I substituted was 1/4 tsp white pepper instead of the 1/2 tsp black pepper. The sour cream, as well as the parmesan, gave this dish a nice sharp offset to the cheddar. Way to go Daphanie!

As time went by, I tweaked it a little:  instead of layering, I added all ingredients into a large mixing bowl...mixing gently before putting it in a baking dish.  Still top with Parmesan and butter.

I made this for the first time recently with minor changes. Like many reviewers suggested, I used more evaporated milk than the recipe called for. I poured in the entire 12 oz can. I used three cups of sharp cheddar rather than two cups. I added 1/2 tsp of dried mustard and sprinkled panko crumbs on top rather than parmesan cheese. I didn’t pour melted butter over the top as it didn’t seem necessary. The sour cream gave this dish a good flavor but it still needs something more for a little zip. The next time I make it I will add onion powder, about 1/2 tsp. I would also mix all ingredients but the topping together. Layering the cheese made it more crusty than creamy. I would also mix parmesan cheese with the panko crumbs. I started to use a 2 quart dish as the video showed but it was too small. I managed to get it all into a 2-1/2 quart dish but it almost overflowed. I will try this at least one more time.

I made some slight changes based on other reviews. I added extra evaporated milk (used a whole large can but doubled the recipe so this was not a whole lot extra) and added extra sour cream and slightly more seasonings. I baked in two casserole dishes, 1 large and 1 medium. This was a very delicious mac and cheese! Some friends who ate it, commented that they loved it and went back for seconds. I had mixed reviews from my kids, however. Two of my kids loved it and two did not care for it. When I make it again, I will add some additional spices instead of just salt and pepper.

Had a great experience with this recipe. Used only 12 oz. of macaroni and added extra sour cream. Baked it till cooked 25-30 minutes and broiled top at the end to crisp/golden it up. AMAZING.

So close to a real conch recipe.  Do everything the same way except cheese,  2 cups cheddar and 1 cup mozzarella.  Do the layers at the end add evaporated milk until everything is soupy. No crumbs on top.  Bake until tooth pick comes out clean.  Anybody have more conch recipes handed down they would like to share?  A true conch is a cracker born and raised in the keys.  I'm a real cracker and I have truly only really known one real conch.

This was good mac and cheese!  I baked it 30 minutes covered with foil, and 15 minutes uncovered to toast the cheese.  I made it as written, with no changes, and it was tasty but dry.  Next time I make it, I will use a 10 oz can of evaporated milk, instead of 4 oz, as our family likes our mac and cheese a little soupy.

If you're debating on whether or not to make this... Stop debating, and make it! I took this dish to a family gathering and my aunt, who is not a huge fan of macaroni and cheese to begin with, asked if she could take the leftovers. It was a huge hit with everyone! I took the advice of some of the other reviews and added more condensed milk than the recipe calls for. This recipe is definitely being saved!

I loved this recipe, with a few modifications of my own. I cut it in half, took out the seasoning salt and added evaporated milk and bread crumbs. It was delicious, just enough for my small family.

I like my Mac and cheese a bit creamer.  I will go back to the one with a creamy cheese sauce made with milk, butter and flour... and lots of cheese, of course!

Great easy homemade Mac and cheese. I used half and half instead of evaporated milk. I used panko and mixed in the butter till it was moistened put it on the last 5 mins. I also used extra cheese (2cups) in the beginning and stirred it before adding the panko and added a little salt at this point too, and another layer of cheese before the panko topping.  We all love cheese so why not.. Plus it looked like it needed it. Cooked it an extra 10 mins longer than called for. 15 mins total with the panko topping cook time.

I added garlic powder and onion powder to the milk mixture.  I also crumble one sleeve of ritz crackers and put them on top before adding the Parmesan cheese and butter.  Awesome dish!!

This recipe was super easy. I used both cheeses recommended and since I didn't have seasoning salt I used reg salt. I mixed in butter and cheese first then mixed in the egg, milk, and sour cream mixture, I skipped the layering process. Lastly I  sprinkled the leftover cheese on top. It came out pretty good. I was quite pleased.

Excellent recipe!  I don't like Swiss cheese personally so the times I've made it I have substituted other types of cheese like Gouda, or a Colby-Monterey Jack mix.  It's great because as long as you have the cheddar you can feel free to use other cheeses that you may have on hand.
I also add panko bread crumbs, and a tiny bit of extra cheese to the top and dot with butter while baking it... Kids liked the extra crunch. :)

I followed your recipe for the most part with just a few tweaks like using cheddar and mozzarella cheese along with a topping of parmesan and romano which worked to our flavor liking. Either way, your recipe was fantastic and came out delicious this Thanksgiving. Btw, I hope you and everyone here had a Happy Thanksgiving! ~Pete

I used plain Greek yogurt instead of sour cream. I also added a cup and a half of finely chopped cauliflower. I doubled the cheese, egg, yogurt/sour cream, and evaporator milk mixture. I still could've used less  pasta. Lastly, I sprinkled Italian breadcrumbs on the top with Parmesan cheese.

I had to tweak this recipe some because the first time i made it came out dry. So added more evaporated milk more sour cream and extra shape cheese to it, plus some cayenne pepper for some extra kick.

This was very good. I always have to make do with what I have on hand.
It's just me and hubby so, I cooked up only half a box of macaroni. Used 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, 1/2 stick of butter, 1/2 cup of sour cream, 1/2 cup of parmesan cheese, a few shakes of garlic salt, and a teaspoon of flour. I mixed this cup then added about 2 1/2cups of cheddar cheese. Then I topped it with panko crumbs mixed with parmesan cheese dotted with butter. I baked for 35 mins. Hubby loved it!!

I tried this at a friend's house and loved it!  So the next day I made the same recipe.  My whole family loved it and kept going back for more (2nd's, 3rd's, 4th's!).  So yummy! :) I personally recommend only using cheddar cheese.  I used half cheddar and half italian blend and didn't love it as much as I had at my friend's house.  I also doubled the sauce because 16oz of noodles can make quite a bit. :)  My family of 6 had two-meal's worth!

This is an awesome recipe.  I did add more cheese because well,  who doesn't like extra cheese?  My brother in law said it was the best mac and cheese he's ever had and to invite him over every time I made it. This is also the only Mac and cheese my 2 year old will eat

Made it pretty much exactly as specified. I think it's silly to rate a recipe after making it barely recognizable. However, I was going from memory after reading the recipe and I accidentally doubled the evap milk. I also just went by looks for the cheese. It was good. It turned out creamy and cheesy. I took one bite (I can't spare the calories) but the kids liked it. :)  I really liked the bite I had but feel like maybe the sour cream leaves a bit of aftertaste. I don't know if it's too much sour cream.. or maybe it's just not my thing. I think I'll make it again with maybe 1/2 container? I also used light sour cream so that could maybe partially be my fault. Definitely a keeper though. I also liked that it's easy. Since you don't have to cook the sauce first on the stove before baking.

Good but definitely needed the modifications I made. I used probably double the cheese (white cheddar and monterey jack), the entire 12 oz can of evaporated milk, 3 eggs (I was going to use 4 but only had 3), 16 oz of sour cream, added spices, and topped it with butter and breadcrumbs. I also raised the oven temp to 375.  It was delicious with the changes.

Delicious!  We all had seconds!  Definitely a keeper.  I only had two cups shredded cheddar available, so I threw in a couple of slices of Velveeta.  I also sprinkled breadcrumbs on top in addition to the parmesan cheese.

The success of this recipe is dependent on the size of the dish used. From what I gather from the other reviews it should be 8 x 8. I used an odd size like 8 x 5 and the bottome layers were uncooked.  I kept taking it out and stirring. Also, use Velveeta.  It's not just hype when they say nothing melts like Velveeta. I gave it 3 stars because it should specify those 2 things and it's a little too rich for my taste.

My husband and I made Mac & Cheese together for the first time. Sorry to say we were disappointed with this choice. It was bland and dry. Our dish was a perfect size for ingredients and we doubled the first 6 ingredients . So it was not that. I would not try this again, I'll just keep looking.

I made this for Sunday lunch using gluten free noodles, and it was very good. The noodles were very creamy and tender and it was not as greasy as some recipes that I have tried.  I will make this again.

I got up early this morning to make this for our office Christmas party. I have made mac n cheese many times but still have not found the kind that browns on top and is creamy. This one was a little dry and bland. It was something I did, I'm sure. I started throwing it together and realized it didn't call for making a rue. I hadn't seen that before, but it didn't seem to matter, it thickened up, I wish I had put more milk in it. I used carnation and milk. I also used some gouda with the sharp cheddar. I put crushed ritz on top with melted butter. I also put some minced garlic and dry mustard in it.

I loved this recipe. I rated it a four because I had read the suggestions and increased the sauce and also added more cheese.  I mixed the parmesan cheese in with the cheddar and put buttered bread cubes on top the last 15 minutes. I also ended up baking for 45 minutes total.

I wish I would have read the reviews first. It's dry and, yes I used a 9x13 which was a mistake. I used about 3 cups of cheddar and put parmesan on each layer but really needed more of the milk mixture. The taste is good and I will make it again with double the milk mixture.

This is a very good tasting recipe. I made it according to the recipe and it did come out very dry. I added a white sauce and cheese which took care of the dryness.  They should amend the recipe so it doesn't come out so dry.

I cut down the macaroni to 6 cups cooked and added more cheese,bread crumbs and didn't melt the butter, just put cubes on top of the bread crumbs. Good base recipe, definatly use a smaller pan as well.

As is I only give it 3 stars.  I added extra evaporated milk, parm and smoked gouda to the cheddar, extra sour cream, chicken broth, onionpowder, garlic powder and white pepper. Mix it all in a large bowl and placed it in a 9 x 13. Topped it with panko crumbs and sprinkled with more shredded parm, garlic pepper and paprika and dash of salt.  I didn't expect the recipe to be creamy, not what I was looking for anyway.  I was looking more for a southern homemade which is what I had when I was done modifying the recipe.

This is a great recipe! My kids loved it! I definitely added extra cheese and used sharp, mild and colby jack. You have to at least double the sauce as well. Will definitely use this one again. So easy!

I always believe in following a recipe exactly as printed before rating it.  Besides following the recipe, I also viewed the video that accompanies this recipe.  The recipe does not state what size pan to bake it in, but the video does say an 8 x 8 pan, which I think is crucial. While the recipe does have good flavor, I did find it to be a bit dry, and when I think of mac 'n cheese, I think of it being wonderfully creamy.  I'm still searching for that perfect recipe.

I would've liked a little more tangy cheese I think, some swiss mixed in maybe.  Overall, tasted fine.  A little bland.

The taste was good, but it was extremely dry.  I thought I'd done something wrong.  I may try it again with 1/2 the noodles and more cheese.

This had an odd taste, I think it may have been the cheddar as opposed to american, and it was very very dry...I'm going to look around for a better mac n cheese recipe with maybe american cheese since it gives off a creamier consistency..my fiance said it was really good but, there's definitely better out there

Great recipe that my picky family loved!  I didn't have parmesan cheese, so I used Monteray Jack and Sharp Cheddar.  Also used about 1&3/4 cups of each cheese.  I followed other reviewer's suggestions and sprinkled bread crumbs on top.  This is a keeper for sure!

This recipe is like soul food to me. I made it and all my roommates loved it...it didn't last very long! It may seem kind of bland to some, but I find it quite delicious with some season/spiced salt thrown on top of individual servings. I've made it several times and will continue to do so!

Thank you for this recipe! Except for measuring the cheese, I made it just the way you indicated and it turned out great.  I made it for a family member, for whom I did not learn until dinner was served, that doesn't care for mac n cheese.  Not only did she enjoy it at dinner, she took some home for lunch the following day! She is now a fan of the mac n cheese!

Good, quick, basic recipe.  I doubled the sauce as per other reviews, but used regular milk not condensed.  I added cheese by eye and threw in some blue cheese crumbles.  Topped it with seasoned bread crumbs.  Very quick to put together.  Great comfort food!  Super easy to adapt to personal taste.

I made this dish last night for me and my son, husbands on the carb diet, boo- anywho my attempt on this turned out okay. It was a little bit dry for my taste. My son on the other hand loved it. I will try and add more cheese next time in hopes that it will be more creamy. Overall good tasting recipe...

I just made this recipe, and I loved it. I halved the recipe because it was just my boyfriend and I eating it. I also added bread crumbs to each layer. I also didn't measure the cheese, I just put as much cheese that would cover the noodles on each layer. I also added more seasoned salt to add more flavor. An excellent dish. I will definitely make it again.

This was okay. It was a little bland, and not quite creamy enough for my taste.  I think it would be great with some tweaking... but as it is, it's just an average Mac+Cheese.

I tried this recipe twice and it was dry and tasteless.  I really wanted to like it because it was easy.  The first time I followed the recipe exactly, the second time I took someone's advice to mix all the ingedients with the macaroni and it came out worse!  I think the proportions are off.  Maybe this recipe should call for 8 oz of macaroni.

I made this receipe for thanksgiving and it was a hit. everyone loved it. next time I would just add a bit more sour cream and milk to make the sauce creamier, and I didn't add the melted butter on top. other than that it was a great receipe and i will be making it more often

Pretty good mac and cheese recipe.  The changes I made were I halved the recipe since it's only my husband and I.  I doubled the sauce and cheese and added about 2 Tablespoons of panko bread crumbs on top and a dash of paprica.  Served with fish and cheddar garlic biscuits!!!

Coming from a person who never salts anything but boiling water, I found this a little bland and so did my husband. I followed the recipe in it's original form and even with the cheeses having so much salt it just didn't have much flavour. I am a mother of a newborn so I suppose it is possible that I left something out, but I really can't think of what would have went wrong. I will try this one more time with a few of the suggested alterations though!

I added additional milk, cheese and diced onion and the dish was still dry and tasteless.  Won't make this again.

Awesome!  I also tweaked it a bit.  I doubled the condensed milk and sour cream.  I used fat free versions of both.  I uses 2 1/2 cups of sharp cheddar and topped with breadcrumbs and parmesan.  I alos omitted the butter. My family loved it.  Thanks!

This recipe is really great! My husband and I really enjoyed it. Like everyone else has said, using a smaller pan rather than a bigger one is definitely a better idea. I used an 8x11 and it came out just fine. However, if you're from a higher altitude like Denver cook this baby for about 10-15 minutes longer than the recipe asks for. Our first go at it was a little mushier than we would have liked, but definitely more than edible.

I followed the recipe except I used about 3/4 of the pasta. I think most people expect it to be a cheesey sauce but it really is a baked dish so it's not going to be exactly like a traditional mac n' cheese. The left overs were great reheated!

This was great!  We added some half and half and blue cheese crumbles (sharper flavor) and it came out awesome!

Good recipe. I used angel hair pasta instead of the elbow macaroni. My family and I enjoyed it.

I agree with many of you, this is a great recipe to build on. I gave this dish a bit of a casserole spin. I used only as much milk as required, and added small bits of ham, and a bread crumb top. We loved it and ate it for a week.

I agree with many of the other reviewers who felt there was not enough cheese and/or sauce.  I would recommend either using half the amount of macaroni this recipe calls for or doubling all the other ingredients.  When doing this, I give the recipe a higher **** rating.

Was disappointed in this recipe.  There wasn't enough cream & cheese for the amount of pasta.  Taste wise it was OK.

What a differ from the same old, same old mac and cheese.  This was a very quick and easy to prepare recipe.  I made it for a friend that loves cheese, and he almost ate all of it by himself. Because of the sour cream I would recommend you try it first before giving it to the kids.

This was an excellent recipe.  I added some bread crumbs on top for texture.  I did find it a little dry and I might add some more milk next time.  VERY YUMMY!
