I was a little weirded out by the milk in this recipe.  I was afraid it would taste like the buttermilk substitute.  However, since the reviews we so good I went for it.  We love it!  The lemonade does seperate in your glass, but nothing a stir with teaspoon can't fix.

This is quite possibly the best lemonade I or my husband have ever tasted. I skipped the straining step and wish I hadn't--apparently, something happens to the milk to cause the cream in your milk to rise to the top of the lemonade and makes it look odd and frothy and then it has chunky bits. It still tastes amazing though!

Very, very good! I took a short cut, instead of cutting away the membrane and adding the pulp, I just added some extra lemon juice. A little on the sweet side, so I will add less sugar next time. I will be making this all summer long :) Thanks for the great recipe Erin!

Excellent recipe! However, it does need to be served IMMEDIATELY or else it will curdle a little bit. Very,very good, pretty simple, and everyone loves it!

There is one thing I have to say and that is, it DELLLLLLICIOOOOOOOUSSSSSS! What I  think will be really good is if you turn the lemonade into an icy. I bet that whould be good! I look foward to making it again.

Very yummy.  I didn't notice any curdling as another reviewer stated.  I don't think it is necessary to use the entire lemon peel, maybe I just left it in the blender too long.  Keeper.

I liked this sooo much, but a small glass was enough. I got a tummy ache from drinking too much! But really, a wonderful concoction in moderation :)

I am a lemonade fanatic and I thought that this was a very bitter lemonade.  I wouldn't make it again.

This is a great drink! But you need to add the milk last, after the club soda and lemon mixture have mixed... Or else the milk will separate. I've already made and enjoyed it several times, and I know that if you're making a single serving you can substitute 1 tablespoon of lemon juice for the partial lemon... A single lemon approximately equals 4 tablespoons or 1/4 cup of lemon juice.

I was also unsure about the whole milk with lemon idea, but the way it is made, you don't have to worry about it becoming buttermilk substitute. 

I subbed Splenda for sugar and only used about a cup. I didn't feel like the lemon flavor was very prominent because I only let it sit for about 10 minutes...Next time, I will let the mixture sit for at least 30 minutes and add more of the peel. Make sure you DON'T put a lot of the white "pith" in the lemonade because that's what can make it very bitter.  Straining is a must and a drop of yellow food coloring gets you a very special lemonade!

I love this lemonade! I didn't put as much sugar as the recipe called for, and it was still sweet enough. Also, if it's too sweet for you, you can add more club soda to your cup.  Thanks for sharing!

Once this recipe was finished it tasted really good but... needed to be strained again before drinking.  Took too long for the end result.

Excellent flavour!  Used my juicer instead of blender which was handy (for those out there with juicers) but you Must strain it.  Also it's best served fresh to enjoy the carbonation of the club soda.  While the liquid sits for a half hour I would chill it next time in the fridge to make a colder drink without having to add ice.

Unusual but got rave reviews from family and guests! My food processor couldn't chop the peel with just the pulp; adding a half cup of the sugar did the trick.

We loved this lemonade. It has such a wonderful flavor. My daughter strongly dislikes lemonade and thought she'd humor us and try it. She now loves lemonade! Thanks a bunch!

Definitely a different type of lemonade..I'm not really a fan of the club soda, but it didn't taste half bad. If you're curious about this recipe like I was I think its definitely worth a try.

Great proportions. My boyfriend loved it, but I thought it was a bit too sweet, and would have added more lemon.
