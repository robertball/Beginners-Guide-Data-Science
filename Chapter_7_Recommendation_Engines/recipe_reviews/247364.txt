Rich. Tasty. This is the real deal unlike many so-called "short cut" recipes. You're still whipping the yolks for fifteen minutes as they thicken -- sans the double-broiler and butter prep. But, I took the day off . Followed this recipe as written, and it came out perfectly.  

Saved me a few pans and a few minutes of prep time. And we ended up with restaurant-quality eggs Benedict for a fraction of the price.

Excellent  for use on 2 generous servings of Benedicts. I always add a few drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire to my sauce. Use lowest flame possible and continually move and adjust the height of the pan over the flame, wisking constantly.  DO NOT place pan directly down on the stove. Watch very carefully because it thickens quickly once up to temp. See Chef John's video on this open flame method on this site.  I personally like to use just one teaspoon of lemon juice.
    For a quick béarnaise sauce try adding a few drops of balsamic or red wine vinegar along with some tarragon, parsley, onion powder and fresh ground pepper.

The recipe as directed works fine.  In fact you don't even need cold butter, room-temperature is fine.  When you start to whisk you'll get a million lumps of butter but as soon as they melt, just keep going and you're good.

The main criticism I'd give is that "low heat" could mean anything.  Depending on your temperature, this might take 15 minutes.  IF IT "DOESN'T THICKEN," it will.  Just keep going.  If it's still as juicy as at the start at the five minute mark, increase the heat just a tick, but not much.  And once it's thick, it won't separate.

"Real" Hollandaise has bay, mince shallot, maybe parsley and thyme, and 50/50 mix of vinegar and water.  I actually like a "fast" way to make it as well.  But why not tear up a bay leaf and add it to the mix, along with some onion powder and white pepper if you have it.

One more egg yolk and less  lemon made this sauce perfect. I hovered my metal mixing bowl over a saucepan of boiling water.

This was the easiest, best hollandaise I've ever made. I doubled the recipe because it was for three people, and it was the perfect amount.

I was skeptical at first but decided to try this.  I used ground white pepper instead of the others to keep the color and I doubled the batch.  Turned out amazing!  No more worrying about it breaking, though that wasn't a problem for me anymore anyway.  This just made the process much simpler with the same results.

Excellent sauce.  Much better than the pre-made stuff in the jar.  I added an extra egg yolk to thicken it.

I made it the first time just as written. The second time I wanted half of it, so I made the sauce the same up to before putting it into the butter. I measured the amount of the sauce and took half of it and used 2T of butter and it worked great! I also found the first time I had the heat too low since it didn't thicken enough in the time frame given.  I'm happy to have an easy and very good way to make this! My dad always made this for us on special occasions.

This method was very easy. I have an electric stove and I used the setting right between low and medium.  It was very quick and tangy, unlike flavorless sauces you get at some dinners that make it from a powder.

This recipe was just as easy as Chef John claimed.  All you need is patience and a strong right arm.  The stuff is delicious--better than I have had in really good restaurants.  And, it DID NOT BREAK!  Life is good and then you learn to make a foolproof hollandaise.

I don’t know what happened but the sauce did not thicken even after 20 minutes. It had a metallic taste to it. I couldn’t eat it.

How do I put this... I hated Hollandaise Sauce prior to making this, now I'm in love with it! This recipe was so flavourful and easy to follow. I poached a dozen eggs and fried bacon while making this sauce, its foolproof. 

Thank you Chef John!

this worked like a charm, but took time! I was worried (bordering on weirded-out) by the amount of water added and the thinness of the mixture .. but it came together beautifully over a double boiler. Just take your time and WHISK!
My only criticism is that I found the amount of lemon to be a tad overbearing in the final product, so from now on I’ll simply ½ that amount.

Chef John is a genius! This is the first Hollandaise I've made out of many which never even threatened to separate and turned out smooth and rich.  I cooked it down a lot for the Eggs Benedict since it was really thin after whisking in the second 1/4 c of butter, but it was perfect then!

First attempt at a hollandaise sauce using this method and the results were almost perfect. The sauce was creamy, tangy, and smooth that I served over eggs Benedict with salmon. Unfortunately the lemon I used wasn't as fresh as it should be so the flavor was a little off, but this cooking method is spot on. Warning to those with carpel tunnel problems or arthritis, holding the mixing bowl for 10-15 minutes will be a pain and your hands will cramp up.

I've been making hollandaise like this with cold butter cubes for years. I can't remember where I first saw it but I think it was French cooking programme with a chef in the background just chucking the cubes in.
But it works! It really works!
Never failed me, never split on me this way. Not once!
 Tried the melted clarified or whole butter with less consistenct results.
With the cold butter version the gentler heat is the key I find. I prefer the extra hint of butterryness and the more vivid colour this way.
Top recipe as ususal from Chef John!

I hate to give this low stars because I am not sure what went wrong. At the end, it looked like creamed butter. When I put it on the hot eggs, it melted like butter; it never looked like a sauce. I took the advice of some reviewers and only added two teaspoons of lemon; I should have added the full tablespoon. I have only attempted Hollandaise twice in my entire life. The first time was probably thirty years ago (or more); it turned into scrambled eggs. I was so disheartened, I never tried it again until today. I'll keep trying with different recipes; I am determined to make this work.

Thanks Chef John!  This was perfect and easy! I held back on the lemon juice a tad and will add a bit more cayenne next time! I don’t know why there are so many alternative technics in the micro and blender when this was so simple, only a whisk and bowl to be cleaned after and it heated while I made the rest of the Benedict.

Although it was much better than packaged Hollandaise, I thought the lemon in my batch  was too strong.  It could have been the lemon I used.  I will definitely try this again with a tad less lemon than the recipe recommended.

It was really, really lemony, so I had to season it to offset, with a pinch of sugar, more salt than I was hoping for and nutritional yeast. It took longer to thicken than I expected but I didn't use direct heat. It did not separate, which is the main reason this got 4 stars from me.

The mixture separated right before serving over poached eggs. Added a tsp of blending flour to bring it back together, this worked.

Started out so promising, then it turned on me. I did exactly as instructed, using  a large metal mixing bowl, I held it with a towel over the gas burner and at three minutes of whisking it was perfection. It needed to be thicker, so I continued to whisk but it started to break and I never got it to recover and ended up with a melted butter mess. I had already made prosciutto wrapped asparagus so used it anyway, but it was not as I planned. I love chef John’s recipes, so will try it again before going back to buying the premade packet. UPDATE: I made this again and this time it turned out perfectly! Don’t know if the heat was up too high the first time? It took about 3 minutes to start looking like hollandaise sauce then another 3 minutes to thicken to where I wanted it. Yum!

The recipe works folks. No skimping on the time though. 
It takes a minimum of 10 minutes of whisking.  I made this recipe x4 and now I have a thick fluffy lemony hollandaise for my grilled asparagus later today.

This is delicious! I put it on asparagus and carrots. I used a medium sized sauce pan instead of bowl and doubled the recipe.

I followed the recipe exactly.  The sauce would not thicken and when I turned off the burner, the butter separated.

Easy and delicious! Added a couple drops of hot sauce and Worcestershire sauce. Really good and only needed 1 bowl! Will make again for sure.

This is the way I've been making hollandaise for years from Madame Benoît.  No double boiler, fast, easy and tastier than I've ever had at top restaurants for eggs benedict. Proof for me, my kids are always calling me for the technique!  Please remember, if you cook your children will probably do as well.

This was my first Hollandaise sauce and I made no changes, it was awesome!  I used lemon concentrate and didn't add enough but that's on me. Will definitely make it again.
