I don't know what to think about this cake. I made it because I like that it fit in a 9x9 pan and I didn't have to scale it down. The cake part had a nice and perfectly seasoned flavor. The only change I made was using 1/4 tsp. of pumpkin pie spice for the allspice. The texture of the cake was a just a tad rubbery and both crispy on the bottom and sides. the center pieces were good. The sugar topping was kind of odd to me though. It melts into the cake and is gooey, really sweet, and the color somewhat of chocolate. I think I would have preferred this with a crumb topping for appearance sake and it would probably be a little less sweet too.

This cake looks pretty but is very dry.  There is no oil in the recipe, so I added some but was still dry.

This recipe was weird.  Made me think of bread pudding instead of cake.  Was disappointed

I made this with two changes.  I used white sugar in the batter and I used 2/3's cup of whole wheat flour in place of part of the white flour.  The rest I did exactly as written.  I baked it in a clear glass pan and it was interesting to see what the brown sugar topping would do while baking.  It did bubble up and coat the sides of the cake.  The cake came out well.  Tastes great warm,  not as great when cool.  Although it is ok, I would probably not make it again, it isn't particularly special.The cake part is heavy, and the brown sugar part is very sweet.

This turned out really well -  served it to friends who loved it too.  

One change I made was I used half white flour and half whole wheat flour when mixing.

it was terrible rubbery, way to much butter I had to spoon it off.  I would never make it again, it wasn't even caky.

I don't know if I did anything wrong.  I followed the recipe, except baked it in a 9" round spring form pan (could that have made a difference?)  The cake turned out very dense and rubbery, almost tastes uncooked.  I actually made 2 for my son to take to school.  He said no thank you.

Made this last night. Everyone loved it and can't wait to have it again.  I used a rectangular pan instead of square only because that is what I had available- ill continue to use it from now on.
