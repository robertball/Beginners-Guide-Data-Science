Really wonderful pudding!  I had a DRY loaf of french bread, soaked it overnight in the mixture and then cooked it in the morning for breakfast.  OH YUMMY!

I found the Bread Pudding too sweet tasting and too much cinnamon for our family's taste.  I am going to make it again, but will lower amounts of the items above.

Unbelievably easy.  Taste is supreme!  Can actually whip up in one pan.  Used a nice marble boule in place of the french bread and it still came out wonderful.
