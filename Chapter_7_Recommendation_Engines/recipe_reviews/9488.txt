I was disappointed with this punch.  The taste was so-so, but I would NOT reccommend using lime sherbert because it gives the punch a murky green color when mixed with the other ingredients.  I used ginger ale but would probably go with Sprite next time.  I'll try it again with raspberry sherbet.

I made this for my sisters shower and everyone enjoyed it. I used rainbow sherbet. Next time I will use only raspberry and throw in some frozen raspberries to make it a little more elegant. You can't get muche easier.

I made this for our poker night and this did not go over as well as I would have liked. In fact, I was slightly embarrassed by some of the jokes that were made about its taste. I'm giving it 3 stars because I think it has hope...I'll use a better champagne next time and also, instead of ginger ale, I'll try Sprite. ALSO, I'll try another kind of sherbert...orange or raspberry? I'll change my rating if the second go-around works much better.

I used the Sprite, champagne & raspberry sherbet and it was great. Very nice how it bubbles as you add the champagne. None was left at the end of the party. Will definitely make again.

I made this for a cookie exchange with 14 people. It was almost completely gone by the end of the night, and a couple people mentioned how much they liked it. I made the recipe exactly as is: Ginger Ale and a bottle of Andre, except I used raspberry sherbet. I wish I would have done the lime sherbet instead. The raspberry didn't give it the "kick" it needed. I ended up adding about a 1/4 of a 2 liter bottle of Sierra Mist. It tasted much better after that. I think the citrus taste is much needed with this punch. I also threw in some frozen strawberries for garnish and to help keep it cold.

I have made this for several parties, and it's always is a hit.  It'll go faster than you think, so bring more supplies to replenish during the event!  I used raspberry sherbet, left out the champagne (let people add their own booze), and tossed in some frozen raspberries to pretty it up.  I also made an ice ring with some raspberries in it to keep it cool throughout the party.
