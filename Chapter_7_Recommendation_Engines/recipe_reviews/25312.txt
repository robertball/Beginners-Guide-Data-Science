Excellent!! However, I took the advise of others and pan fried the tofu in garlic, ginger, and oil first, increased the veggies a bit, and used natural (unsweetened) peanut butter to make it less sweet. FANTASTIC! Also added crushed peanuts on top and served over angel pasta. Everyone wanted thirds!!

Deliciously addictive.  I didn't actually try the recipe strictly as written, but followed some of the advice from other posters.  I fried the tofu first so it got a crispy exterior (I then removed it and added it back in during the final cooking stages).  I also sauteed a tablespoon each of minced garlic and ginger in the center of the pan immediately before adding the sauce mixture to the vegetables.  Rather than add cayenne I put a spoonful of Hunan red chile sauce in the sauce mixture.  Finally, I stirred in some chopped green onions and sesame oil and squeezed on some lime juice immediately before serving.  Oh, and (as others have suggested) crunchy all-natural peanut butter adds great texture to this dish.  The final product had plenty of spicy-tangy-garlicky-peanutty sauce to coat all the tofu and vegetables and flavor the rice.  The vegetables were nicely crisp-tender when I stir-fried them on high heat for the recommended time.  Pretty quick and simple -- I'll definitely make this again.

I had good results with this. I have a good trick for cooking with tofu, though. I freeze tofu first, then thaw it out and squeeze it gently to get as much fluid out as possible. THEN I dice it up. This process gives tofu a much more cohesive and "meaty" texture, and also causes it to marinate and brown more effectively. Try this recipe again and see how it comes out. Also, if molasses doesn't suit you, try honey, or even add some ginger.

Pretty good. It is peanuty, and I used natural peanut butter. I also browned the tofu (with some fresh grated ginger and minced garlic) before adding the rest of the veggies. Other than that, I followed the recipe almost exactly, adding some crushed red pepper to the sauce. 

Next time, I will also brown some onions along with the tofu, and I will probably use only 1/4 cup of peanut butter. I will add some vegetable broth as well so the sauce isn't quite as thick. I think it's a keeper with just a few tweaks. I served over brown rice, which was good.

Thanks for the yummy recipe, Anne.  I love peanut butter, so I didn't think that it was too much.  I changed the recipe a bit though.  I fried the tofu in garlic and ginger first, then removed the tofu and added it with the sauce at the end.  I also added green onions.  Delicious!  I will definately make this again.  It was my first time cooking tofu.  Thanks.

This is a very tasty dish, and quite easy considering the amount of flavor you end up with. I followed some advice and fried the tofu in garlic and ginger, along with some chicken breast (sorry vegetarians!).  That was great, and so was adding some green onion.  Also, we prefer using chunky peanut butter as the peanuts add a nice crunch and texture.  This recipe is a definite keeper.  And for you carnivores, the chicken is great in it.

Loved it!  Will make this again.  I also took the advice of previous reviewers and added garlic, ginger to the oil, and used more veggies like carrots and snap peas.  I did not have cayenne, so used crushed red pepper flakes in the sauce and also to season the tofu as it cooked.  I was skeptical about the sauce - it seemed thin - but it thickened up nicely when I added it to the hot wok.  I finished with a squeeze of lime juice (had seen that in a peanut sauce recipe on this website) and thought it added a real nice touch to this dish.  Overall an excellent dish and one that I will definitely make again!

Very tasty recipe. I enjoyed the sauce. The first time I made it, I sauteed the veggies and tofu together, and added the sauce in the pan. I found that it made the sauce too thick, and my tofu never got browned.

The second time, I cooked the tofu separately in a little vegetable oil, so it got nice and golden and a little crispy. I then sauteed the vegetables separately so they were crisp tender, and combined everything in a bowl -- with whole wheat rotini -- and ladled the sauce on top.

That was great. I also used chili sauce instead of the cayenne and added a little sesame oil to give it an even nuttier flavor.

Great recipe, though. I will be making it again. I particularly like the addition of the molasses.

this recipe was really easy to make. i found a lot of useful hints in the reveiws before me. especially in browning the tofu and adding it back in at the last minute w/ veggies and peanut sauce. i did not add in the molasses or honey as suggested, i really dont have a sweet tooth. and it wasnt missed at all. thanks for a great peanut sauce!

I have loved this website for years and have never written a review until now.  This recipe was just that good.  I highly recommend doing what other reviewers said and frying up the tofu separately, it will just fall apart if you cook it with the veggies.  I followed the recipe pretty much exactly as far as measurements, but I did use honey instead of molasses, red pepper flakes instead of cayenne and I added an extra tblspn of Sesame Oil with the Peanut Oil because I love the flavor.  For the peanut butter, I HIGHLY recommend All Natural Chunky.  It was still sweet enough and the peanuts in it were a nice touch.  Oh and I also added green onions at the end and fresh squeezed lime gave it a nice touch as did fresh chopped garlic to the veggies, but I do that with every dish :)  Enjoy!

I just loved this recipe. I used lemon juice instead of vinegar in the sauce, and fried the 'steak' variety of tofu on both sides without any flour coating before I added it to the veggies. This is super-yummy!!!

This has become a staple in our house. Like others, we like the tofu better if pan-fried first -- we let it fry while chopping up the veggies. The recipe is very flexible for any veggies you want -- my preference is broccoli, onion, bamboo shoots and mushrooms. I also add some spicy chili paste to the sauce, which adds a bit more texture than just cayenne. Super yummy!

This was fantastic! I marinated the tofu in olive oil, sesame oil, light soy, star anise (you can use 5 spice) fresh garlic and fresh ginger then browned it first. Used Organic Spelt udon noodles. 
I also added about a tsp sesame oil to the peanut sauce.  Top this with lightly toasted sesame seeds. It's marvelous! Thanks!

Excellent! I cubed the tofu, and baked it in 350 degree oven for about 25 minutes to get it nice and firm. I then followed the directions, substituting rice wine vinegar, and chunky peanut butter. I served it over angel hair pasta, and it was delicious. I would make again.

This is a great dish!  Took everyone's advice: cooking the tofu first in a bit of oil, garlic, & ginger is a must!  We used peanut and sesame oil; added sesame seeds to the tofu & then the veggies as they cooked.  We used natural peanut butter, and put over wheat noodles, sprinkled with some sesame seeds.  Delicious! I made this for my dad and brother, who were skeptical of the tofu, but my dad had seconds :-).  Really great recipe!  Thanks for sharing! (Note: doesn't re-heat as well as when freshly cooked.)

Made as written (with the exception of adding extra veggies & crisp frying the tofu) and wasn't entirely impressed. My sauce was runny and not very flavorful. I think the brand of peanut butter you use changes how much water you need.I use natural (with the oil drained off). I had to add double the peanut butter , vinegar, & soy. I highly suggest only using 2 Tbls H20 to start & thinning as needed. But with a thicker sauce, some cilantro, and chili sauce it's really good.

this was pretty yummy!
changes i made: i used rice vinegar, i omitted the mushrooms and added a sweet onion, i used pure peanutbutter (no salt or sugar added), i added the juice of a lime, i added 1 tbsp of ginger, i sauteed the tofu in the oil first until browned then added the veggies, i added 1/2 cup of crushed peanuts at the end, i served this with white rice and added some salt, next time i would add some fresh cilantro.  since my peanutbutter didnt have any sugar in it, i added the full amount of molasses and it was not too sweet.  Thanks for this scrumptious and easy recipe!

This has become a staple in my household! It's a very versatile recipe, so this is a great way to use up those veggies -- I love throwing in carrots, water chestnuts, and anything else I've got on hand. Unfortunately, my husband doesn't like tofu nearly as much as I do, so I generally make it with chicken instead.

Very good comfort, stick to your ribs sort of meal-scaled for 2.  I did as others, drained tofu well then put in freezer 30 min., cooked w/ garlic (spray olive oil), removed cooked the random veggies I had on hand, peanuts for crunch, added sauce and served over brown rice.  Sauce - used brown sugar/honey, rice vinegar, lots of cy. pepper., low fat PB. and added some lime juice.  I think I used a total of 5 cloves of garlic between tofu and veggies so it was VERY garlicky.  Next time I would add more pepper and maybe use crunchy PB and add water chestnuts for crunch to cut down on some calories. Very easy and good thanks!

I am currently trying to eat vegan so this recipe caught my attention.  The only thing I changed was I swapped out the agave for two packets of stevia, and since the recipe didn't specify vinegar, I used rice vinegar to stay with that "asian" theme.  The recipe was absolutely wonderful.

I used almond butter thinking I would enjoy this recipe change.  I felt the sauce was too thick and over powering.  I would try to fry the tofu first, before other veggies,  and substitute molasses with honey or brown sugar, as other reviewers suggested. I might try this recipe one more time with changes.

This is a great recipe. Easy to make. I recommend using natural peanut butter - easy to work with and better for you. Great stuff!

This was just OK. I am not a big tofu eater and neither is my fiance but we wanted to try something new. The sauce to us was very heavy and oily. I had that feeling in my stomach like I ate a big oily meal. We won't do this one again.

Really good and with lots of sauce to spare - just the way I like it! I also pan-fried first in sesame rather than peanut oil because that's what I had on hand. I did not have red peppers but I added chopped red onion, snow beas and broccoli instead.

Hate to give this a poor rating because I had high hopes.  Unfortunately, the sauce turned out too thick and too peanut-buttery.  I took a few bites and stopped.  My husband, who doesn't let leftovers go to waste, ate the whole thing over the course of 3 days, bless his heart.  If I try it again, I'll use less PB (and I used natural PB), more water and more molasses/honey.

This was so easy to make and absolutely delicious.  I was craving a great peanut sauce, and I found one!  I even added just a little more peanut butter and found that it was perfect.  I didn't have peanut oil, but canola worked just fine.  Try it- it's a great recipe!

My family liked this recipe. I didn't have the exact ingredients so I substituted a little. Frozen veggies for fresh came out very mushy and pasty. Next time, I will try to use fresh veggies. Also I overcooked after adding the molasses sauce so it got a little dry and thick. Taste was still good. BEWARE Very peanut buttery!

My husband is a huge meat lover. HUGE. When I took some reviewers' advice and fried the tofu before making the rest of the dish, he thought it was chicken. Even told me he'd happily pay for it in a restaurant. Btw, that's his highest compliment :) You can use 3/4 c of brown sugar in place of molasses. And make more sauce to serve it all over rice!! Thank you for this!

I make this all the time and we love it!  To make it even easier, I use frozen stir-fry vegetables, which I saute on their own with oil and ground ginger, and then I saute the cubed tofu on its own before putting everything together and adding the peanut sauce (which is so good with chunky peanut butter, and I love that you can adjust the spiciness with the cayenne pepper to taste).  I serve it over lo mein noodles.  Yum!!

Very tasty stir fry with a sauce/flavoring that is unlike most Asian dishes I have eaten. I made two modifications in the I omitted the vinegar and added a good douse of Sriracha sauce to the peanut butter sauce. It has a very interesting sweet,  yet spicy taste to it that I and my husband liked. Next time, we will probably cut the tofu into small pieces so that there are more tough/browned edges and less soft/squishy insides. Overall, a very good recipe asides from the vinegar, but probably one that caters to a particular taste in food.

Delicious meal!  Made a mix of garlic powder, corn starch, and a bit of salt to coat the tofu (make sure you press out the water) and fried the tofu in peanut oil for about 8 minutes before adding it in with the rest of the veggies and peanut sauce.  I used honey instead of molasses, and the sauce was delicious.  Served with coconut rice.

Omigosh! The ony change I made was to omit the molasses and sub Chinese rice wine for the vinegar.  Pre-browned the tofu, stir fried it with the veggies, and served on brown rice topped with a little of the peanut sauce.  This will be a definite repeat!

I took some other reviewer's suggestions and fried the tofu with garlic and ginger first and added a splash of lime juice to the sauce. I was generous with the cayenne, even adding a bit more while cooking. After all this the dish was still mostly peanut butter to me. Not bad, but not what I was hoping for.

This was so good.  What a great night to come home after a long day and throw this together--so easy and yum!  I did not have molasses on hand so subbed one tbsp brown and one tbsp white sugar.  I served mine on a bed of rice.  Thanks for sharing the recipe.

The peanut butter taste was way too overwhelming. Eating it with brown rice made it somewhat bearable but ended up throwing away the majority of it. Will not be making this dish again.

Man I hate giving bad reviews but my family and I REALLY did not care for this one. I love peanut sauces, but this one is just not very good. I agree with the reviewer who said this tasted like tofu swimming in peanut butter. As written, this just didn't do it for me. Perhaps if the PB was reduced by AT LEAST half?

Yummy and quick, perfect for a week night! The sauce seemed to lack a little zing so I used more soy sauce and vinegar. Prior pan-frying the tofu is a must!

I was actually surprised at how good this was.  I really enjoyed it.  I did make a few alterations though (I usually don't like to change anything the first time I make it because I don't feel as thought it is really a fair rating but I didn't have all the ingredients on hand).  I used honey instead of molasses, sesame oil instead of peanut oil, and rice vinegar instead fo regular.  It turned out wonderful.  It was also very simple to prepare.  I will definitely make this again.

I wasen't very impressed with this recipe.  I don't know if I didn't follow the directions right, but this was not so good.  The sauce was thick, with the look and consistancy of brown gravy and I wasen't fond of the sweet and peanut buttery taste.

Used rice vinegar and tamari (for soy sauce).  Also added 1 tsp crushed ginger & 1 tbsp garlic.  Stirred in lo mein noodles once the sauce & veggie mixture thickened.  Delish!

Really good - I did as other reviewers suggested and sauted fresh ginger and garlic in the oil before adding the broccoli and other vegetables, and also added 1 tsp dried chilli flakes to the sauce.  I left out the molasses, it seemed unnecessary.  Husband loved it too.

This was quite tasty!  After reading other reviews, I used 1/3 cup peanut butter & 1 tablespoon honey.  Also cooked the tofu with some ginger & garlic.  Yummy!

This was a very good start and with some additions and changes has become a staple.      I added about 2 tsp each fresh,minced ginger and curry powder,a clove of garlic minced and a couple Tb of minced onion.I used about twice the soy sauce and brown sugar(which I used instead of the molasses),and a little less of the rice vinegar.

We could eat it, but we won't make it again, sorry... We like all the ingredients this recipe calls for, but we thought the peanut butter was a bit out of place... Maybe we're just not used to recipes like this one?

I wish I had read the reviews before wasting time and money making this recipe. I love peanut butter and hated this. My husband who will eat anything I put down in front of him took one bite when I told him I wouldn'r be offended if he didn't eat it. What a waste of good food. It seems that people either love or hate this recipe- sorry, but I didn't like it.

25% still came out great.  Hosted a 12 person party and this is the entree they wanted seconds of!

I followed the recipe plus the review suggestions and still thought this was just ok. The favors tasted muddled to me. And I just didn’t enjoy eating it. Not even sure what to suggest to improve. I do think that honey might be better than molasses. Anyhow, it looked good but wasn’t one of my favorites. M

As I have never used this recipe before, I followed it to the "T". While it was not bad by any means, I definitely agree with the comments saying that it is too sweet. Next time I will try natural, unsweetened peanut butter. In addition, I can definitely see why others pan-fried their tofu first; it is far too soggy for my liking as is. Other than these things, I definitely recommend giving this recipe a try! It went very well with Jasmine rice.

I would definitely sear/fry the tofu before placing it in with the veggies. Otherwise, it's just a mushy addition. Flavor was delicious overall.

Way too peanut buttery.  I would maybe do the peanut butter mixture (with much less peanut butter) with the tofu, then mix the rest of the veggies in afterwards with a simpler sauce, like a soy sauce.

I LOVE a meal where you start the rice before you start prepping anything else. This was a delicious and super fast meal for Meatless Monday. I would imagine you could change this up to include any veggies you have on hand and it would still be great.

I didn't read the reviews of others before making it and I made it just as the recipe is and it was really good. However, the tofu was a little tasteless so I would definitely try what others are saying to do next time.

In an effort to start doing "Meatless Monday", I tried this recipe. I scaled it down for the two of us, but kept the sauce amount about the same (actually increased liquid slightly).  I subbed chicken stock for the water (I know, not really meatless), didn't use molasses, and stirred in about 3/4 cup of thawed, frozen petite peas, since I didn't feel like doing the other veggies. I followed other reviewers' suggestion to fry the tofu ahead with garlic and ginger, to make it nice and crispy. My husband said this was delicious and asked me to make it again!  Thanks for posting.

This is addicting. It is SO good. The only thing I did differently is that I dipped the tofu in cornstarch and lightly fried it first - made it crispy without adding too many calories and carbs. I also just threw in whatever additional veggies I had on hand and wanted to use.

At first, my husband and 6 year old son were a little bit skeptical about this dish because we have never tried cooking tofu at home. In fact, we almost never ever tofu, period. I thought I would give it a try. My husband and son ended up asking for seconds!!! I used coconut oil instead of peanut oil. I also fried the tofu with some minced garlic and minced ginger first, before adding it to the veggies. I added a bit more hot water to the peanut sauce mixture, to make it more saucier. Squeezed lime over it in the end and served on white rice. Yuuuummmmyyy!

I made some tweaks, but it turned out to be the best peanut sauce dish I've ever had (including restaurants), I pre-sauteed the tofu by itself until it was just past golden brown, then I put the veggies in. At the point where they were tender-firm, I mixed in the sauce. It's worth mentioning that for the sauce I used natural chunky peanut butter (don't use Jif!), and I skipped the molasses. Your peanut sauce should be very runny, no more viscous than oil. It firms up when you pour it over the vegetables. Also, instead of cayenne pepper I used Tabasco sauce, which gave it a very interesting flavor, I would recommend it. Definitely play with different amounts of vinegar, water, peanut butter, and Tabasco sauce until you get the taste you are looking for, it took me a bit of experimentation to make it work. On a side note I skipped the red bell pepper, and used julienned carrots snow peapods instead.

I made this exactly as written except for the cayenne which I did not have on hand. I substituted sambal olleek in it's place. I did crisp up the drained and pressed tofu first and then added it back in at the end. I love peanut butter but it seemed to me that the proportions were off. It felt like the sauce was too peanutty and too thick. I used a natural peanut butter. The sauce felt heavy and rather than coat the tofu and veggies I felt like it drowned them. I ate it but I haven't even decided whether I'll use the leftovers. I don't think I'll make this again

I made this last night for dinner and really liked it.  The peanut sauce was easy and delicious.  The combination of flavors was very good, though I think when I make it again (and I will!) I will pan fry the tofu first as others have suggested.  Thanks for the great and easy recipe!

I tried this and agree with those who say the tofu should be fried first, then the veggies. I tried it as recommended and overcooked the veggies, which were soggy and limp by the time the tofu was ready.

I agree with Susan that extra firm tofu is not firm enough. You can get a more "meaty" texture by squeezing some water out of the tofu first.

Also, I think the peanut flavor is a little too strong. I am going to try using half the recommended peanut butter, next time. 

But a nice vegetarian dish, all things considered.

I did not care for this recipe. I followed the recipe step by step (w/ the exception of only a little less peanut butter).

This was my first time ever making tofu at home and it was delicious!!!!  My husband was literally scared to eat it when I told him I was making a tofu dish.  He took one bite then proceeded to clean his plate.  I did the same.  Peanut sauce was to die for and I will be using that in other dishes too!  Thanks for the recipe!!!!!

Great easy recipe. I will say that no vegetable will cook in 5 minutes though, so figure in about 10 for them plus another few once you add the sauce. I skipped the molasses because I was using Jif (plenty of sugar in there) and we topped it with Siracha instead of using cayenne so my 2 year old would eat. He loved it though, so we'll definitely have it again soon!

This was really good. I sauteed the veggies and tofu and added onion, garlic and a little sesame oil. At the end I added chopped green onion, basil and cilantro. Yum!!!

Simple perfection! Very quick and delicious. I first fried some garlic, ginger and sesame seeds, and added chili powder, sugar and balsamic vinegar to the mixture. I also used shiitake which I had at hand. Instead of PB, I used soaked cashews and peanuts, part of which I crushed. I let them burn a bit because that makes them taste divine. I also added some noodles at the end. Deliciousness.

Coming from a college student, I absolutely LOVE this recipe, and it's quickly becoming a staple. I don't consider myself particularly creative when it comes to cooking, but this recipe is so versatile, I can add pretty much anything I want and it will still be delicious! (When made as directed, I got all of the ingredients--I didn't already have most of them like sesame oil--for around $20, and got 8 meals out of it.. not too bad for something this good and relatively healthy!)

The second time around I played around with the sauce by adding coconut milk and ginger. I also cooked the tofu in the oven with garlic and some more ginger. I also bought all of the veggies I could get my hands on (within reason of course) and had extra ginger, so I thought "what the heck" and threw that in too. The result was a TON of peanutty gingery delicious food. My 3 roommates and I have all had GENEROUS portions over angel hair pasta and there is still a ton left! Lucky me!

This was my first adventure into vegan cooking and this was amazing!  I used the advice of some of the other users and did the tofu first with garlic and ginger and then the veggies and combined it all before adding the sauce.  This is definitely going to be a go-to recipe in the future!

I tried this, and thought it was delicious. I did not brown the tofu like other reviewers, but I didn't mind it at all! The only thing I didn't care fore was the strong taste of molasses. Other than that, I thought this was perfect. I will definitely be making again!

No a big fan.  The consistancy of the sauce was off and had to "doctor" it up too much (added garlic, ginger, et al).

This was excellent. I am a newb to tofu so I mistakenly used medium-firm- since there was no firm at my store. It turned out alright but I will remember not to do it again. I love peanut butter and this had just the right amount. I will be making this again for sure! Thanks!

We love peanut sauces and we love all the ingredients, but it was so peanut buttery that we couldn't even stomach it.  If we were to try again, we would use far less peanut butter, more soy sauce, and perhaps some vegetable stock.

It needs more veggies in the mix.  I followed it pretty close, and had way more tofu than veggies.

WOW! I have limited experience with tofu, but this  recipe will make me come back for more! I used the recommendation to stir fry tofu and garlic first and the rest pretty much followed.  Quick and easy, and delicious!!

This was pretty good. I pan fried the tofu with peanut oil, garlic, freshly grated ginger and onions before adding it to the wok with the other veggies. I replaced the red pepper with carrots and also substituted honey for molasses. It turned out good, but my boyfriend and I felt that that was something missing. Perhaps more garlic or more soy sauce. I also used crunchy peanut butter which adds great texture. Overall, pretty good.

This reminded me of a dish my grandma & mom make from our country. Followed the recipe exactly, but substituted brown sugar for molasses since I didn't have any on hand. It was a bit to peanuty for us so I will use less peanut butter next time. Also fried the tofu until golden brown before tossing in with the veggies so it didn't fall apart. Thanks for sharing!

This is a great recipe! Very flexible and quick - ready in 20 minutes max. It can be made gluten-free or can be changed up depending on what you have available. It makes a delicious sauce over the stir fry, and can be served over rice. I used broccoli slaw, sliced mushrooms, omitted soy sauce (gluten), and peppers (because I don't like them).  My husband added soy sauce to his - and he said it was a "5/5"...quite a complement for someone who doesn't really care for tofu.

This has become a weekly staple in my house!   I never have molasses on hand though, so I just substitute honey and it tastes great!  Oh it's sooo good it's become one of my favorite dishes!  I do a little more prep work to the tofu first though since I'm a vegetarian and hubby isn't - so the 'meatier' the texture the better for him.    I get extra firm tofu on grocery day and freeze it first.  Then defrost, wrap in paper towels and press between two plates with a heavy weight on top.  Then slice and 'dry fry' the tofu first - nonstick pan on  medium heat, no oil, pressing all the water out with a spatula as it cooks.  Then I just toss in the tofu slices after the veggies are cooked!    It IS a bit more time-consuming but if you're new to tofu or just prefer that dense, chewy texture it's worth it!  I prepare ALL of my tofu dishes this way now and hubby no longer complains!  ;)

This was a great recipe; my husband and I really enjoyed it. I crisped the tofu in a little oil, then added it at the end per other reviews. It will definitely be a staple tofu recipe in our household.

Wow this was tasty!    The sauce gets better as you cook it,  and even after you let it sit for a couple of minutes.   The best time to tweak ingredients is after a minute or 2 of simmering, so if you doubt any of the amounts and don't want to overcook the veggies, get it started in a separate saucepan and add it to the veggies and pre fried tofu   when the taste is to your liking.  My subs were: 1tbsp dark soy for the 2 regular and molasses to taste (for me was only one tbsp).  I topped it with peanuts and spring onions and served it with a brown rice, barley and cilantro pilaf with lime wedges on the side. This is a keeper!

Nice peanut sauce. I added a bit of onions, garlic, jalepeno, and cilantro when I fried up the tofu first and then added the veggies and mushrooms and let them steam on top before adding the peanut sauce. Would definitely make again although I definitely wouldn't add the molasses.

I love cooking, and I usually love peanut sauces for stir frys, but this was just bad.  It tasted like vegetables and tofu swimming in peanut butter.  I even reduced the peanut butter to about 1/3 cup and tried adding more soy sauce and vinegar to fix it, but it just tasted like peanut butter.

I just made this and it was very easy and so good! I cooked the tofu in garlic and powdered ginger (that is all I had) and that really added to the flavor. I also added tablespoon of duck sauce to the peanut butter sauce.

Sauce was too thick.  Even when I added more water it would thicken immediately. Will use less peanut butter next time if I make it again.

I added green onions and carrots to the vegetable medley. I sauteed a clove of garlic, some grated ginger in the peanut oil... and then added the tofu. Over all it was great. I would have made brown rice to go with it to soak up the peanut sauce. :) Next time I make this I will experiment with the peanut sauce.

Very good, and very easy if you buy vegetables that are pre-cut/chopped/shredded.  I doubled the sauce and added a package of angel hair pasta because I was feeding a hungry crowd.  The only negative for this recipe was that the sauce was a little too bland.  I added fresh ginger (and would have added some crushed red pepper flakes if I had had any!) and it helped a lot.  Very easy, healthy and tasty...this is a keeper!

this is really good.  however, maybe i'm just an amateur cook, but the quantity of broccoli and mushroom to me was very vague.  what kind of mushroom, etc.?  but i've since tweekeed it my own way.  :)

Very nice recipe as-is. With modifications, definitely a 5 star recipe! I sauteed the tofu in ginger and garlic first, as others suggested, omitted molasses and used 1 Tbsp honey instead, and used 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup ground peanuts (done in food processor). I also added sugar snap peas and a jalapeno pepper for heat. It's excellent served over jasmine rice.

I cooked this for a friend and we both loved it. I had been looking for a good peanut curry recipe like one of my favorite entrees at our Indian restaraunt. I used this as the base. I sauteed the tofu with garlic and ginger first until brown, I like it crispy outside. I left out the molasses and I didn't want to use regular peanut butter because of the sweetness so I threw 1/2 cup of peanuts in my food processor and used the powder to make the sauce. I also added 2 tbsp curry powder and extra cayenne to make it spicy. Thank you, I will be making this frequently.

I added carrots and ate this with buckwheat soba noodles and enjoyed it immensely. The only reason I gave four stars was that my dinner companion said that it was bland. Next time I will not share!

this is a great template to work with.  the sauce is really good and you can tweak to add more or less of the veggies you like.  i like to thin the sauce with a little light coconut milk (just to get it the consistency you like).  also, marinating and baking tofu makes it much more flavorful.  marinate it in sauce overnight after seueezing and chopping it.  then bake on a greased baking sheet at 300 for 1-2 hours, turning periodically.  it is a lot of work, but SO much more flavorful.

Delilcious but didn't have quite the intensity of flavor I was expecting. I would make it again but add more chiles/hot pepper.

This is very good, but slightly bland.  I started frying the veggies first (I used the bagged, chopped broccoli from Costco, carrots, and zucchini) and cooked the tofu in another pan with some ginger and garlic powder.  In the future, I will add a handful of fresh garlic. I use natural peanut butter, no salt or sugar added, so I needed a little more soy sauce (I used Bragg's Liquid Aminos), but the sweetness was just right. Thanks for the recipe, Anne!

My husband just asked for this recipe for his birthday dinner.  I followed the other reviewers' advice to cut out molasses and the peanut butter in half.  Instead of peppers and mushrooms, I use broccoli, carrots, and onions, and I use chicken broth instead of hot water.  We also like to put in peanuts to add crunch and hot pepper flakes for added spice.

I love this!  Quick, easy, and delicious.  I did follow the tip of grilling my tofu first -- I think next time I will try to press it first.  Also -- it will seem like the sauce is too thin but it did thicken up nicely after I poured it over the tofu & veggies and heated it.  GREAT RECIPE!

I made several modifications from suggestions of previous ratings. I used half sesame oil & half vegetable oil instead of peanut oil, a frozen bag of mix veggies (carrots, broccoli, zucchini, snap peas, green beans & lima beans), chicken instead of tofu (boyfriend's request), brown sugar & honey instead of molasses & lots of garlic & chili pepper sauce (Chinese, found in any asian grocery store) instead of cayenne pepper. I whisked the peanut sauce to make sure it was smooth since my peanut butter had been in the fridge.

I thought the peanut butter was a bit strong in this flavor and might cut down to 1/3 cup but my boyfriend loved it & gobbled it up and I found my bowl completely empty. 

I served over brown rice. 

Great recipe! Love peanut butter!!!!!

This is a great recipe.  I did what other reviewers suggested and cooked the tofu first with a little garlic and ginger.  I also added lots more veggies including carrots and snap peas and served it on a bed of brown rice.  My husband and 3 year old gobbled this up especially the tofu.  I did cook up some chicken as well for my hubby and the peanut sauce was great on there too.  Next time I will add more cayenne to spice it up a bit.

I had hoped this would be like the peanut satay's that you get in restaurants...either I did something wrong (I used organic peanut butter) or it just tastes like peanut butter coated veggies. I don't think I added enough spice either.

This sauce was very good. I made this two days in a row.The first batch turned out excellent, I added peanuts. 2nd time, made only with broccoli which started to burn, too little oil? Unfortunately I may have added too much more because this batch tasted oily.

I combined a lot of changes other people made. I froze the tofu first, steamed the broccoli separately and added garlic, ginger and sesame oil. Just great! I made a quadruple recipe for a potluck and there was none left at all.

Wonderful recipe - so easy to make and so utterly delicious! My boyfriend and I make this regularly now but often with a whole load of spinach instead of the other veggies. Wa also add a touch more molasses (2 tbsp instead of 1 1/2) and a pretty generous pinch of cayanne!

Very yummy.  I used red bell pepper and a small onion for the veggies, and about 1/4 to 1/3 cup of extra chunky peanut butter.  SO good over Jasmine Rice.  Definitely a keeper.

This went over really well with my husband.  I followed advice from previous reviews and cut the amount of peanut butter a little and also fried the tofu with ginger and garlic.  I then steamed the broccoli with my rice so I didn't need to simmer everything together for very long.

i liked the taste of this but it was too rich, my brother hated it, my mom thought the idea of a peanut sauce was ridiculous, but my sister really liked it. i was hoping i'd like this recipe becuase i'm a peanut butter fanatic. but i'll have to stick with vegies and tofu plain for now.

I suppose I am one of the few who neither loved nor hated this recipe.  It was very simple to make, and was good but got old quickly.  I'm a big peanut butter fan, but it did seem to be a bit too much.  It was ok, and I look forward to the leftovers, but I doubt I would make it again.

I made this for a vegetarian friend who devoured it. Next time I make this for myself it will be with chicken or shrimp, I think the flavor of the tofu overpowered the peanut sauce. But overall it was quite good, and the colors of the vegetables were very pretty. Oh, I also added about 1/2 c. of chopped peanuts. Thanks for the recipe!

This was a great recipe.  I changed the ingredients a bit to suit my preferences.  I added noodles, zucchini, carrots and red pepper flakes.  With the added red pepper flakes the sauce was a great combination of peanut and spice!

Tasted good, but the molasses resulted in a very thick sauce which wasn't appealing.

Would have been a five for a side dish when you are going to be eating a larger plate of vegetables!  But this recipe was wonderful! Better than a restaurant!

We eat tofu every week. My older daugther usually loves tofu but she didn't like that one. My husband didn't like it either. I think it's because of the peanut butter (even if I use half of it) I thought it was fine but I will not make this again as I would be the only one to eat it :(

This was good balance of peanuty-sweet-sour-salty and bitter.  When I mixed the sauce in the bowl, it was thicker than I expected so I added an extra 1/2 cup warm water, then another 1/4 cup cold water mixed with 1 Tbsp corn starch, brought the sauce to a boil in a separate pan and the result was exactly as I had expected.  I threw in a minced shallot too.  I did the veggies and tofu separately so I could better control their texture.  Just poured the sauce over at the end and it was fantastic.  With the modifications, it made more like 6-8 servings.  Very much like "Swimming Angel" at Thai restaurants in my area.

This was the first time I've tried cooking with tofu, and it was really easy and yummy! I took suggestions from other reviews and first sauteed the tofu with some garlic, ginger and oil for about 4 minutes, I also doubled the amount of broccoli and mushrooms. I used fresh ground peanut butter, and didn't have molasses, so I added a little bit of honey. You only need a LITTLE bit or it gets too sweet. My husband added more spice to his, but we both loved it! We'll definitely be making it again!

I thought this was very good.  It did get a bit too peanut buttery after the first few bites though.  However, I didn't have the soy sauce, and I still thought it was good- a keeper in my book.

My husband surprisingly loved this recipe, I thought it was okay.  We only changed one thing which was leaving out the molasses and adding a bit of splenda to make it low carb.  It was good, with a slight peanut flavor.  I think next time I might make a little more sauce to go over it or try to add a little more peanut butter. We will make it again!

I personally felt that this recipe was not peanut buttery enough.  i added garlic and scallions too.  My lunch guest enjoyed it and said it was the right amount of flavor. (She's not too into strong peanut sauce.) We did add extra hot sauce, instead of cayenne.  Thank you for sharing.

This was a great and easy recipe.  I used more veggies-two heads of broccoli, a large pepper, 8 oz. of sliced mushrooms, and a can of green peas  and sauteed garlic with the tofu.  I doubled the sauce and it was the perfect amount.  Thanks for a tasty recipe!

This was good. I had to use different vegetables (frozen peas and cauliflower) and walnut oil, and it still turned out fairly well. The only problem I had was that the leftover oil made the peanut sauce a little lumpy. With some experimentation, I would make this again.

My family loves this recipe! It's very similar to what we order from a local Thai restaurant. True, it's pretty peanut buttery and sweet - so if you're looking for something savory or dislike PB you might want to try something else. I cut back a little on the vinegar and wilted fresh spinach over the sauce during the last couple minutes of cooking. This gets my husband to eat veggies, thanks for posting! :-)

A bit too heavy on the peanut butter for adult tastes.  May be better with a bit of ginger and white wine.

FOR A CRISPIER, BETTER TASTING TOFU:
I personnally hate mushy and distasteful tofu, so here is what I do in any tofu recipes:
I would encourage draining the water from the tofu block by wraping it in a towel and putting it undersomething heavy like a cast-iron pan, for 30 minutes. Cutting it. Then, mixing it up with a tbsp of cornstarn, 1bsp any spice that you like (1tbsp turmeric or paprika, for me), frying it first, alone, with peanut oil and ginger, setting it aside, then putting it back with the other legumes just before the peanut sauce!

I made this with chicken breast instead of tofu and it turned out fabulous!  I added whatever veggies I had and it all worked  well. You can be creative with the ingredients with any mixture of tofu, meat and/or veggies.  Just make the sauce and pour it over!  I also made some asian style noodles with this and my husband loved it. I will make this again.

Like others advised, I pre-fried the cubes of tofu in ginger, garlic, salt, pepper, and oil until it was nice and crunchy. Otherwise I followed the recipe and served it with jasmine rice. Yum!

The sauce was tasty but I would add a hot pepper or two next time for a little more  zing. We found the firm tofu a little too firm, next time I would use softer tofu and cut it into smaller pieces. I would make it again.

I followed suggestions of reviewers & sautéed the tofu with some fresh ginger & garlic in peanut oil, removed it from the pan & added it back near the end. I used natural peanut butter, so I enjoyed the addition of the molasses. I used extra veggies, too. I added onions first, substituted fresh squeezed lime juice in place of the vinegar & sprinkled green onions on top. Very good recipe!

I did not have the veggies on hand to make with fresh so I used a bag of Stir Fry frozen veggies. I was afraid this would make everything runny and I actually ended up with the opposite. The sauce I made exactly as written it was way to thick for the veggies for me. I plan to make again and cook the sauce in a saute pan so it's hot and use less peanut butter OR more veggies. That way I could put on the sauce to match my tastes. The overall flavor of the sauce was good, it was just to thick for me.

Rich and can be high in fat, so try to make lo-fat/fat-free if you can. But it's delicious.

I use this recipe for the sauce more than anything. Like other reviews I pan fry the tofu to make it crispy, adding garlic and ginger about halfway through so it doesn't burn. Remove the tofu, then I stir fry a bag of mixed frozen stir fry veggies and a bag of broccoli. I add the tofu back in just before adding the sauce. Serve over glass noodles and it's great!

It's a winner!  Very easy to make.  Followed the tip of frying the tofu first.  Also added carrots and edamame to the mix.  Lovely taste :)

This was good until the point where I added the peanut butter.  
I first fried the tofu, then sauteed defrosted frozen veggies with onion and garlic.  Added the tofu back in with the sauce (used a touch of honey, no molasses), but it tasted quite bland and prominently of peanut butter flavor.  I served over rice but had to keep adding soy sauce and fish sauce for flavor.  I really didn't like the peanut butter in it even though I'm usually a fan.  Will go back to my basic recipe and not make this again.

I love this easy tofu recipe! However, I have to brown the tofu first with garlic or the textures not as tasty. I also use olive oil instead of peanut oil and I don't like peppers so I don't add those. I like to serve it on top of rice, so yummy!

Really tasty, only thing was my sauce didn't thicken up as much as i would have liked - easy fix though, in a small seperate bowl i mixed up about 2 tsp. water and a 2 tsp. cornstarch and added it in, worked like a charm! :) And i should add that i too fried up the tofu before hand ;) delicious and i'll totally make it again :)

I would give it five stars if the instructions included what other cooks have done, and that's to saute the tofu beforehand with soy sauce, garlic, and ginger. I also added the molasses at this point and a spoonful of chicken base to the mixture because I'm not vegetarian. It was delicious. Also, I didn't have any broccoli on hand, but I did have fresh string beans, so I used those instead. My family loved it, so it will definitely go into rotation. Thanks for a great recipe!!

This was a first for me not liking a popularly rated recipe on here. The flavoring wasn't just my thing. I guess I'm not into peanut butter sauce. :(  maybe if I was to make it next time I'm going to reduce the peanut butter. However, my fiancé finished his plate with a smile. :D

I fried the Tofu in peanut oil first before stir frying the veggies,  to make it more firm and crunchy. Made this for dinner guests that are vegans, myself a vegetarian and 2 toddlers and everyone loved it!

My meat-loving, tofu-hating, foodie bff ate the heck out of this. He even asked how to make it so he could recreate it at home. He doesn't even cook. I've had lots of various peanut sauce stirfries however, and this one was solidly average-- good, but not mindblowing.

I made two mistakes. I used medium firm tofu, and I didn't press the water out. There was a ton of water in the tofu, peppers, and mushrooms, so I let it boil away for twenty minutes  while sautéing so it wouldn't dilute the sauce. The tofu broke up, but that didn't really bother me. The pan was a little crowded, so next time I'll fry the tofu separately.

Thr sauce was great! I used natural crunchy peanut butter, which gave a nice crunch. The cayene pepper goes great with the peanut butter. I found the sweetness and acidity just right.

I made this and it was alright, but the peanut butter taste was overwhelming. I added garlic and snap peas. Next time I think I will add some ginger as well, cut the peanut butter in half and add a little sesame oil.

Very tasty recipe!  Definitely press the to tofu first (wrap in two paper towels-place a plate on top and put a heavy can on top of that for fifteen minutes) then pan-fry until a golden brown.  I use low-sodium soy sauce and crunchy peanut butter.

I too followed the advice of others and pan fried my tofu first. (I do this for all my tofu dishes, as it really adds a nice crispy exterior with a creamy interior.)  Yes, it's an extra step but very well worth it!! Swapped out some of the veggies for others and used a no-sugar added peanut butter.  

This was really good and pretty easy to make. I will be making this again.

Really liked it.  I used rice wine vinegar and replaced the mushrooms with bok choy.  In the future, I'd add a little more sauce as it thickened too fast, but that is all.  Great flavor!

Fried tofu in garlic and ginger as others mentioned (1 clove and 1 1/2 inch section of ginger).  Very good but as others mentioned too peanut buttery, next time reduce peanut butter by 1/2

Didn't care for it. The sauce was too heavy and rich for our taste buds. Liked the tofu and veggie combo though.

I suggest pan frying the tofu separately. Against my better judgment, I tried stir frying it all together- it was an aweful mess. Flavors are great, but the tofu sucks.

The only thing I would change is cutting the amount of peanut sauce just a bit .... Just like a bit more veggie flavor and a bit less peanut butter.

Wonderful, balanced flavor.  I would just make more sauce next time as I served it over rice, and it became a bit dry with the rice soaking up the sauce.  Also, don't forget to drain the tofu.

Spectacular and so quick!  I added a bit of garlic powder and made everything else as written.  Wasn't sure what kind of vinegar to use so just went with regular white and that was fine.  Topped with chopped peanuts.  Really, really delicious!

This is seriously delicious and easy to make - thank you! I followed other reviewers' suggestions of using half the amount of peanut butter and stir-frying the tofu (or whatever meat you're using) with ginger and garlic first. Instead of cayenne, I used chili garlic sauce for the spice.

Yum! I really just used the base and Tofu. I had sweet potatoes that I cut them into sticks, added some mushrooms and a chow mein noodle, with frozen brocli. My husband had three helping. Wow there are so many things you can do with this peanut base I am excited to do more experiments.

This was quick, tasty & satisfying!  Next time I'll fry the tofu first because mine came apart a little bit with the other veggies (but I didn't use a nonstick pan).  And I will be having my leftovers over brown rice or noodles, since there was a lot of sauce.  Will def make again!

I just LOVED the taste of this. As a personal preference, I omitted the red pepper and added a bunch more mushrooms. My 9yr old just loved it and has requested this again. I'm also going to be making this with chicken instead of tofu for my husband while I make this recipe again for myself. I fried my tofu prior and then added to the sauce/veggies towards the end, otherwise, I can imagine the tofu just crumbling. Great easy, tasty recipe! Thank you!

Really great.  Took other's advise and fried tofu in garlic and ginger first so it got brown and crispy.  Great dish for vegitarians and meat loves alike.

Not a fan. I fried the tofu before, and the sauce didn't meld with the veggie choices. The sauce alone (with my modifications) was awesome though; it was too sweet and bland as written. Needless to say, won't be making this one again.

Yummy!  I double the sauces and added onions and thai hot sauce instead of cayenne - at first.  It wasn't spicy enough for my taste so I went ahead and added the cayenne.  A remarkably simple but DELICIOUS meal! Very filling too! Highly recommended!

I really enjoyed this a lot.  I plan to make it again!  My husband thought it was just okay.  We both like tofu and vegetarian meals on a regular basis.    I tried to follow the recipe as closely as possible...I did use portobello mushrooms and natural crunchy peanut butter.  I like my tofu browned and so I sauteed it by itself in the peanut oil for about 5 minutes and then added the veggies for about 4 minutes.  Once I added the PB mixture, it only took 1 minute to finish.  I served it with mango on the side.  We tried sprinkling it with rice crispies, ritz crackers, and no topping...I like it each way.  Thanks for this recipe! ********************************** If you have PICKY KIDS like mine (4 yrs and 16 mos), I'm happy to report that I scooped out some tofu from the finished dish and rolled it in rice crispy cereal and that's what I served to them.  They refused to touch it at first, until I required my son to eat 2 bites before he could have something else.  I suggested he pretend he really liked it...to my surprise he was a great actor.  He ate his two bites with great "enthusiasm" and then my 16 month old girl proceeded to try hers and said "nummy" and ate 6 tofu/rc cubes.  I was so proud.

I followed the advice of the previous reviewer because that was mostly what I had on hand.  I used natural cashew butter instead of peanut butter because that's all I had.  It made for a very mild tasting sauce.  Because I didn't have rice vinegar, I used 2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar and 2 Tbsp Mirin.  I then added 4 Tbsp soy sauce, about 1 Tbsp lemon juice, pepper, cayenne pepper, some olive oil and a half a cup of water.  I sauteed garlic and ground ginger and then added a bag of pre-chopped stir-fry veggies (broccoli, carrots, snow peas, and bok choy) and sauteed those.  I then added pre-marinated seitan.  When the veggies and seitan were tender, I poured the sauce over and heated.  I cooked some brown rice and served the sauce and veggies over the rice.  I'm a vegan, but my meat-eating husband really enjoyed this recipe, too.  I will make this again for sure!

Dangerously addictive. I kept eating even though I was full because it was that yummy! Here are my modifications (thanks reviewers!): pan fried tofu with minced garlic and ground ginger before adding red pepper, snap peas, water chestnut and broccoli. For the sauce, I used 2 heap table spoon of natural peanut butter, 2 tablespoon rice vinegar, 2 tablespoon soy sauce, dash of salt, pepper,  cayenne pepper, lemon juice, sesame oil, and 1/2 cup water. As soon as I poured the sauce over the veggies, I turned off the heat. Served over brown/wild rice.

Great sauce for the stir fry!  We froze, thawed, pressed, crumbled and marinated the tofu in some garlic and vegi broth before tossing the recipie together.  It needed a little more spice, and I ended up adding Siracha chili sauce to my taste.  We will eat this often.

Love this recipe!  My husband hates tofu, but actually loves it when I make it like this!  He even did the 'old school down on one knee arm pump "YES!"' when I told him we were having it for dinner tonight.

This is a good recipe, but the sauce came out a little thick and gummy for my liking.  Next time, I'll keep the sauce separate and pour it over the tofu and veggies right before serving, or just heat it in the skillet for a minute.  I kept the veggies separately steamed, so the sauce is way too much for just tofu.  But otherwise, very tasty!

I got my husband to make this for me when I was busy writing one evening--turned out awesome!  A little heavy on the peanut butter, but you have to get your protein somehow, right?

Fantastic! I sautéed ginger, garlic, & tofu in olive oil for a good 15 mins before adding extra veggies to the recipe. I used a bit less molasses as mentioned it may be sweet. I served the dish on a bed of quinoa, a perfectly light accompaniment. I would recommend serving this on quinoa or brown rice. This will definitely be a regular meal in our house!

I found the sauce too thick and heavy. But it was yummy nonetheless. I added way more veggies than the recipe called for and also introduced some new ones like onions and carrots. I fried the tofu first with garlic and ginger but the garlic ended up burning. So next time I'll fry the tofu first by itself and fry the garlic and ginger with the veggies. Also, I'm going to try honey instead of molasses. I think with tweaking this recipe could deserve 5 stars.

I originally gave this 4 stars because I didn't like how the tofu turned out.  After freezing and thawing the tofu, on the other hand, the tofu is much better and meatier.  I have to switch my rating to 5 stars because I gave it 4 stars 2 years ago and since then I make this recipe ALL the time and love it...so I think it deserves 5.  I make it with whatever vegies I have on hand though, which usually ends up just being broccoli.  Freezing the tofu first is a must though.

The peanut sauce was a nice change from the ordinary, however I found it to be a little too overpowering. Not bad though, and would try it again.

We enjoyed the flavor of this recipe, but there was entirely too much sauce on the veggies. I guess everyones idea of "small" is different ('small head of broccoli', 'small red bell pepper') but I really wish I had added a little sauce at a time instead of dumping it all in at once. My boyfriend made rice to serve it over after I realized there was too much sauce, and that solved the problem. I didn't have molasses so I used honey with good results.

I made this recipe last night.  It was exceptionally quick and easy to prepare.  I gave it a four because although it was easy and everything worked out well, the flavor just wasn't that great. I'm not sure that I would make it again.

This recipe was quite good, though I didn't add the molasses and took the advice of others to use natural peanut butter. I also made some rice noodles and tossed them in the sauce prior to pouring over veggies.

A very easy dish to prepare. I substituted and used canola oil and honey. Also pan-fried the tofu in advance with some chopped onions and added garlic in the last minute or so. The family liked this dish a lot!

Yummy! We love Thai food and this hit the spot! I had a bag of frozen veggies handy, so I used those instead. I cooked them for about 10 minutes before adding the tofu. My hubby loved it. This recipes is a keeper and we will probably have it on a weekly basis!

I really enjoyed this recipe!  However, my family isn't wild about the "texture" of tofu, and there was a lot of it in the recipe.  If you're the same way, add more vegetables and cut back on tofu, but it's an excellent vegan recipe that I'll use over and over again.

An excellent meal that is easy to make. The vegetables give the meal a fresh quality, and the sauce makes it hearty. Next time, I will use less molasses and a bit more cayenne pepper.

A good, healthy, and balanced recipe, but a little heavy on the peanut butter (I used natural peanut butter).  The tofu was a bit bland, but the vegetables were great.  I enjoyed the leftovers more actually! Overall, it was a fun dish to try, but I don't think I will make it again.

Wow, this was delicious!
Next time I make it, I will definitely add water chestnuts and more broccoli. I'll probably also try sautéing my tofu with the ginger and garlic and serve it over white rice.
Regardless, following the recipe verbatim is definitely wonderful!

Very quick, I would suggest using the molasses because I didn't and I thought that might help.

The sauce was really good.  I would recommend a bit less tofu though...a pound is a lot of tofu, and it was a bit much for me.  Otherwise, great stuff.

Very tasty.  Best if tofu is fried in garlic and ginger.  Not perfect for tofu (I don't like to mix tofu with sweet), though it's a great peanut sauce for chicken.
I served it over rice stick.

This was just great! I did cook the tofu first and set it aside, then sauteed the broccoli for about 3 minutes, then added mushrooms for 2 minutes, then added the sauce for another 3 minutes. Added tofu on top last. Others noted this as being too sweet, but I did not have this problem. If you are using already sweetened peanut butter like Jif, or Peter Pan, than yes it might be too sweet. I used natural peanut butter and it was delicious.

I normally am not a fan of the texture of tofu but this wasn't too bad at all.  I cut the tofu up into small cubes and fried it in a bit of olive oil to make it nice and crispy on the outside and set it aside while cooking up the veggies.  I only added the tofu at the last minute so it didn't have a chance to get soggy again and that really helped.  Even my mom who is NOT a fan of tofu ate this without any complaints.  Only problem is the sauce is a little thick but that is an easy problem to fix.

I just loved this recipe. I left out the red pepper and added water chesnuts instead. I used rice wine vinegar and honey instead of the molasses. Wonderful meal. It tasted even better the next day. I also cooked the tofu alone first to give it a bit more firmness. I'll make this again.
