I added a few spices to make it a little more personal to our family (onion powder, garlic powder, little dijon mustard, little Frank's Hot Sauce, fresh ground pepper) but other than that, I kept to the recipe. I did not try this myself but I was told by my husband that the kids really liked it. They both had seconds. My husband said it was good but a little thick for him.

I loved how easy this was. My daughter and husband loved it. It turned out creamy and yummy. They don't like cottage cheese, so I substituted plain yogurt. I really liked the fact that I didn't have to use flour and butter to make a roux. Not having to do that step saved me time in the kitchen. Great recipe! I will definitely make this again!

Usually I make mac & cheese using a roux and then adding the cheese to that before mixing in with the macaroni.  This recipe caught my eye because it is different and easier in that it isn't necessary to cook the sauce.  Also, I had a container of sour cream that needed to be used. So, it was the perfect recipe.  We loved this -- I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised the way it turned out as I was sceptical of no roux/cheese sauce.  I followed the recipe for the most part, although I sautéed diced onion and a red bell pepper, also diced, to add to the mixture.  I had some tomatoes that needed to be used so I chopped those roughly and included them (peeled them first).  I did not have cottage cheese so I used plain yoghurt as another person did. We loved the flavour of the sour cream and yoghurt.  It gave it a very subtle tang, not overpowering, but just so that you were like, mmmm, what is this I'm tasting? Very, very good.  I used about the amount of cheese called for, maybe a little more.  I did sprinkle some on top as called for in the recipe.  I also sprinkled paprika all over the top.  Not only did the dish taste really good, it looked terrific when I took it out of the oven.  Because I made it ahead and had it in the refrigerator, before I put it in the oven, I put about a half a cup or more of milk in.  I just poured some slowly over the top of the casserole.  It worked perfectly and the macaroni and cheese was moist, not dry at all.  Recommend this.

12/29/2015, This recipe is a good starting point.  One of the problems is that the dish ends up being a little dry and bland with taste.  I added over 1 1/2 cups of milk to this recipe, chopped up 1/3 onion and sautéed it.  I also added Japanese Panko Bread Crumbs by sprinkling it on top.  Cover dish while baking for the 25 minutes and uncover during the last 15 minutes.  These added ingredients made this recipe taste better.

This was really good stuff. Very very rich, however, so don't think you'll be able to eat a ton of this at one sitting. (Which is really good because as good as it is just from the oven, it's BETTER the next day.) Anyway, I made a half recipe, using GF pasta (Tinkyada penne since that's what I had). I subbed ricotta for the cottage cheese (what I had.) Used to much ricotta, but had already added half the sour cream. Used a whole egg (not half.) It worked fine! Then, for the cheese, I used a scale and started with 1/2 cup grated parmesan then added a mexican mix to the 16 oz mark (then removed about 1/2+ cup mexican mix for the topping.) I had to mix this with my hands, it was so thick! Then, putting the pasta in was difficult. However, SO WORTH IT. Very forgiving recipe, as you can see. I'll definitely make it again.

This dish was very easy to make and everyone seemed to enjoy it.  I did add a little bit of half and half because the cheese mixture is very thick.  Turned out great though.

I liked it OK, but next time I'd add all med. or sharp cheese, one more egg and a half cup of milk.

This is one of the best Mac & cheese I have ever had! I changed it a little by using a cup of cottage cheese instead of 3/4, In order to use it up. I added 3 hot Italian sausages cooked and sliced up. Then I topped it off with crushed ritz crackers on top!!! Very yummy!!!

I used this as a base recipe. I did 1 pkg cream cheese instead of cottage cheese, I bag of mild cheddar instead of 2, and approx 1 cup heavy whipping cream. I melted all of it in a pot then added in the pasta. I used mini shells. Mixed well then put in a dish and topped with 1/3 pkg mild and 1/3pkg sharp cheddar. Baked at 350° for about 30 min then broiled at 500° for 2 min to brown. It was amazing. There were no left overs!

Tastes yummy!!! I didn't really measure all the cheese - just kinda added what I thought looked right. Also added Parmesan cheese for an even cheesier flavor ??

My husband really loves this recipe. It's very easy to make and you can add more seasonings to make it better. I even add a splash of white zinfandel wine.

This was quite tasty, actually, though I did add some onion powder, a bit of garlic power, some cayenne, and about a cup of milk. 

One thing: though the flavor and overall texture was lovely, the curds of the cottage cheese made the macaroni and cheese look a little . . . lumpish and weird, somehow. Next time, I think I'll whirl the cottage cheese and the sour cream in the food processor for a few seconds, for a more smooth consistency and a nicer look.

Lovely cheesey flavour. I used Gluten Free pasta and a combination of Gouda, marble, and old cheddar cheeses. Not as creamy as the roux variety but a lot simpler to put together.

Been looking for a Mac and cheese recipe that I’d love and this is the one! So good and easy! Didn’t have sour cream so sub for milk and forgot the egg but still so good! Also, used pepper jack and a little velveeta as my cheeses, and added garlic, onion, mustard powders and a pinch of nutmeg. Definitely will be my keeper! Can’t wait to make again and I’ll make sure to have sour cream on hand.

Loved the combination but a lil to dry so I added more sour cream before baking.

This makes the best mac and cheese!  The sour cream adds a very nice brightness.  Used small curd, 4% fat cottage cheese, made nice, creamy sauce.

Fantastic Cheesy Mac and Cheese Recipe.  I've made it about a half dozen times so far.  Sometimes I add some slices smoked sausage or Kielbasa sausage to it or at lease grill it and have it on the side.

Used Mozzarella and Colby/Jack mix, since that is the cheeses I had in the refrigerator and was incredible.  I also used a little garlic salt, instead of the salt/pepper.  The cottage cheese with the sour cream is what just puts  this one to the top favorites!  Will definitely make again!

This was a wonderful meal !  Used all farm market fresh ingredients, subbed cream cheese b/c we had no sour cream. Had some smoked bacon ends on hand so I chopped that up and added.  Glad I doubled it so I could enjoy for breakfast too.

This is great! I had a lot of gouda so I used that instead and it was still delicious. I love spices so I added a few. But this is one of those recipes where it's simple so you can make it your own!

My daughter was at a friends house when her mother made this Mac and cheese. She, and all her friends raved about it so I got the recipe, then found it here on AR. Made it exactly as stated in the recipe and everyone loved it! If my daughter will let me, I'd like to add some garlic and onion sometime.  Great recipe, thank you for sharing!
