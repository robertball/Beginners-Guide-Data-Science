These were okay. Actually, I'm not sure how I feel about these...3 or 4 stars. It didn't seem like there was enough seasoning in the meatballs so I did half per the directions and the other half I added a few basic things to...garlic powder, pepper, a bit of cajun seasoning.  I preferred the meatballs with the additional seasoning.  The sauce was good and easy.  I doubled the recipe for the sauce because it didn't seem like there would be enough as indicated in the recipe. Maybe a little too saucy for only 1 pound of meat. I will make again with 1 1/2 pounds of burger meat (with additional seasonings), double the sauce recipe and see what I think then.

One "indulgence" I have allowed for in my monthly food budget is prepared meatballs. I used them in this recipe. It was surprising how only two ingredients could make such a flavorful sauce! I doubled the sauce ingredients, as I was using a full bag of meatballs. I heated everything in the microwave, about 4 min. on hig temp. (1100 watts). My husband and I really enjoyed this dish, and my grandson thought it was delicious--he ate ten meatballs! This recipe was super-easy to prepare--I will definitely make it again. This would be a good for buffets and potlucks as well. Thanks, Lorenda!

My husband and I both loved this recipe. It wasn't too "saucy", I didn't think. I was short on time, so I browned the meatballs in 2 pans until almost cooked all the way, then baked for 15 minutes. They were perfect! Great and simple recipe, very tasty, even cold on day 2. I served with white rice, and will try with spaetzle next time!

I made this, but used my standard meatball recipe.  I made the meatballs ahead of time and baked them without the sauce.  Just before serving I warmed the preserves and barbecue sauce on the stovetop and added the cooked meatballs to heat through.  I also added some steamed bell peppers (red, green, yellow and orange) that needed to be used and served this over basmati rice.  These were very good and wonderfully colorful!

This rating is for the sauce. Very nice! One thing I would like to see when people use prepared products from the store, is to mention the brand they use, since not all are created equal. I used Smuckers Apricot preserves with Stubbs original BBQ sauce. Stubbs has a smidge of heat to it that works well with the sweet. this is a vinegar base BBQ sauce, however the vinegar does not come thru the preserves, giving it almost a chutney-like flavor with heat. very nice indeed

These got the thumbs up. They used ingredients I already had on hand, and took very little time to prepare. I did add in some garlic powder and pepper, but otherwise followed the recipe. Served over onion rice. Thanks for sharing!

Very tasty.  I doubled the sauce and added some garlic powder and pepper to the meatball mixture.
