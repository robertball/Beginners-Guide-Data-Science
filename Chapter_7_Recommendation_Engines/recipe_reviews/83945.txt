As a person from the U.S. I've recently discovered the wonders of Marmite. This recipe is quite tasty. I followed the recipe pretty closely, but had to add more butter because mine didn't pool in the bottom like it was supposed to. I will definitely make this again.  Thanks for the recipe!

Mum used to make this all the time when I was a kid. I follow this recipe but add peas like she used to, and I also omit the paprika. Husband can't stand Marmite, but I love it. The gravy is delicious, and goes great with carrots and mashed potatoes. This is wonderful comfort food; quick, easy and inexpensive too. Thanks!

I couldn't stand Vegemite alone on toast, but my husband loves it so I thought I'd see if there was another way to eat it that would suit both of our tastes.  With this recipe, I'd eat the stuff regularly.    My husband and I LOVED this - we served it with mashed potatoes and sweet peas, and mixed everything together a bit on our plates.  Wish I'd have thought to make bread to go with it - a crunchy French bread would have been fantastic.

Really simple and soooooooo good.  I had my mince over mashed potatoes.  I had seconds and one of my sisters had "fourths".  I love Marmite and have been looking for recipes, this one is definitely a keeper.

My British friend introduced me to marmite and I love it! I'm going to try this using Morningstar meatless crumbles or veggie burgers, and mushroom bouillon and veggie gravy mix. I'll let you all know how it turns out.  I'm so glad to see a recipe using marmite here. I always just have it on a bagel with butter, but I'm sure there's plenty more I can do with it.

I love marmite so decided to look for some recipes I could use it in.  I liked this, but it was a bit bland...I think next time I will use more marmite and see if that makes a difference.  I will definitely make it again though.

Really liked the sound of this but I found it extremely salty (I used marmite, I don't know if it would have been the same if I'd used vegemite).  Might try it again with less marmite but doubtful.

I enjoyed making this recipe. Great idea.  I made a healthier version using ground chicken instead of beef.  For the gravy I used beef Bisto so one would think they are eating beef ;). I also served it on Acorn Squash instead of mashed potatoes (halved and baked at 350F for 1 hour). My grumpy husband didn't miss the mashed potatoes - too much. I also topped it with mozzarella cheese and broiled for 5 minutes at the end. Note, I added diced carrots, onions, garlic, and mushrooms in with the chicken for added flavour and nutrition.  See photo - you've got your vegetables and protein all in one serving!

I love to cook, but I normally I like to stick to recipes I know, I took a chance on this recipe and it was a fantastic choice, everyone in my family went back for seconds , now it is our family secret when we take it to friends party's , everyone asks me to make it for them! It's a great winter recipe!
