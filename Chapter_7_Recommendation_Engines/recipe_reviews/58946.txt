Tastes excellent!!  Highly recommended!!  We used bbq sauce instead of hot sauce, so we added a little extra...it was terrific!

Jerky Marinade Haiku: "Hmm what's it missing? It was a good marinade. Perhaps some all-spice?" I marinated several chicken tenderloins in this for a little over a day, and it was quite tasty. I know that the intention of the recipe was for a beef jerky, and not "Jerk" as in "Jamaican Jerk", but I'm still thinking if I used this marinade again, I would add 1/2 tsp. all-spice, and maybe fresh green onion and minced garlic, instead of the powders. I served the chicken perched atop fluffy coconut rice w/ green peas and lime wedges for a tropical flair in the midst of a chilly winter's night.

I wanted to find a good marinade to add to some meat I was feeding some men who came over to help with my yard.  I didn't have the hot or liquid it called for, but used everything else.  I added A1 NY Steak marinade and let it sit for 2 hours.  It made me happy when they all went..mmmmmmmmm, all together.  So good!

This marinade was pretty good, but just a little too salty for me. I will use less soy sauce next time, but other than that, it was very tasty and I will use it for my jerky again.

This recipe was great! We made deer jerky. We soaked the meat for to days in the fridge, then dried it in our American Harvest dehydrated for 10 hours. Perfection!

This is a great recipe for deer jerky. I also added about 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce to mine and sprinkled cayenne on before I dehydrated. I’ve made a lot of deer jerky and this was definitely some of the best

Modified using
4 tsp of homemade pepper sauce
2/12 tsp of liquid smoke
2 tsp of pepper
Also ground peppercorn on top when put into dehydrator

Would make again, but add more hot sauce.

Excellent marinade.  Doubled the hot sauce (Cholula) and added some dashes of Maggi seasoning.  I don’t really think the additional hot sauce or the addition of the Maggi was necessary, just small tweaks for my taste.

I make jerky a lot and this is a very good standard marinade  and I use it often.   If you want a teriyaki version, which I like at times, decrease soy sauce to 1/4 cup and add 1/4 cup teriyaki sauce.  Decrease brown sugar to 1/4 cup.  Decrease onion powder and garlic powder and hot sauce to 1/2 teaspoon.  Add 1/2 bottle of a good beer, such as a bock.

This is the best Beef Jerky ever. My coworkers loved it. My wife ate it for dinner. The smell is fantastic. The taste exceptional. 

I used a London broil for the meat. The recipe would probably accomodate 4 lbs of that (i made two 2-pound batches) as opposed to the one lb that was called for. 

By all means, make this and enjoy it. You’ll find it’s too good not to share!

I like the recipe overall but for my taste, on round two, I have cut the Tabasco in half, doubled the black pepper, and reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup. I'll rate this modification as well once I've tried it.

Made it this weekend. It's a good basic marinade, but lacks what I was looking for, a little more salty taste and some heat. 

I'll reduce the brown sugar next time, and use  more hot sauce and add more cayenne and black pepper too.

This is absolutely delicious.  It’s my go-to for beef jerky for the gals in our family!  From 4 years old to 60!  Great flavor, and eye round is THE best cut for jerky!

I tried this recipe exactly as written, using 1 lb of thin sliced top round beef.  Delicious!  Has a salty, tangy profile with just the slightest kick of heat underneath.  I'll definitely be using this one again!

I used wild duck meat and added red chili flakes because we really like that on our jerky and it also helps with any gamey taste from the duck. This was a good basic recipe for jerky and it would work nicely with venison too for all of you hunters. This one is a keeper!

I used one of the McCormick Grill Mate marinades as a base, then followed the recipe; it still seemed a little bland so in went a bit of red wine vinegar, cajun spice, ground garlic, red pepper flakes, and a lovely lemon lime spice blend. Awesome!

I thoroughly enjoyed the recipe. Also It was a fantastic recipe with deer meat really really good.  The guys at work went nuts and I had to hide it.  Enjoy.

Really good recipe for my first time to make Jerky!  Marinated for a week (got Lazy) and the flavor was great.  Going to try a second batch and see if 1 day (24 hours) of marinating gives me the same results.
