I just want to point out that spelt is actually wheat. From about.com: celiac disease: "Spelt is a species of wheat and is NOT gluten-free. People who believe that spelt (scientifically known as Triticum spelta) is gluten-free and safe for people with celiac disease are mistaken. According to the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act of 2004, foods that contain spelt or kamut cannot carry "wheat-free" or "wheat-alternative" labels." So if gluten is the reason for being on a wheat-free diet, spelt is not the answer.

So few ingredients however, getting the right cut and not overcooking was a challenge. First time cooking noodles with spelt. Keeping this one on file for future use. Thanks

I have used spelt exclusively for over a decade. I consider wheat to be unfit to eat due to the many health issues associated with a toxic protein found in wheat called a lectin. This pasta recipe is one that I have used since I permanently stopped using wheat.

The dough mixed really well in my kitchenaid mixer.  It's much more sticky compared to semolina and wheat so I had to dust it with lots of flour while I rolled it out.  I used the pasta roller attatchment and it worked just fine.  It's sweeter than the other pastas I've made so adding salt is a good idea.  I'm making it again soon.
