Couldn't get enough of this...we loved it! I used frozen cooked cocktail shrimp & a can of fancy white crab meat (finally found a recipe that the cheaper stuff is good in!). I used lite ranch dressing instead of mayo & I used Old Bay instead of salt. And I probably used an extra tbp. of cucumber (I wouldn't suggest leaving it out...it adds a lot to the dish). The filling was really, really good w/ the avocado!

I added onion/garlic powders, dill weed and minced red onion. I couldn't see the purpose of wasting a perfectly wonderful avacado just to use the shell as a bowl, so I chopped the avacado meat and added it into the mix. This made a great lunch Annie and thanks!

This was a hit as the second course of my Valentine's dinner. Like other's have said already, I saw no point in wasting a perfectly good avocado, so decided to make it part of the meal. I actually did not stuff them at all. I sliced the avocado, squeezed a lime over it(both for flavor and to prevent browning), and used it as a bed for the filling. For the filling, my valentine is allergic to shrimp, so I used premium crab to make up for the lack of shrimp - the jumbo lump crab -, I also put a little extra cucumber (someone here already said it, but it bears saying again, the cucumber really makes the dish, so don't leave it out),some fresh dill, and although it was valentine's day, I couldnt help adding a few dashes of garlic powder - it was the perfect touch. I served it on top of the lime-soaked avocado slices - DELICIOUS! So good in fact, my valentine was hesitant to move on to the next course!

Didn't want to waste avocado by scraping out the flesh so I t sliced the peeled avocado and served with the shrimp/ crab filling.  I also added a little salsa sauce to he mixture.  Made a great starter to Christmas lunch.

One word: YUMMY! I followed on reviewer's advice and used Ranch dressing in lieu of the mayo. I used fat free Ranch dressing, and it gave it an extra kick. I also left a lot of the avocoado mixture in and smushed the crab/shrimp mixture into the halves. I would just have to go back to replace the filling I ate. I love avocado and didn't want to waste it. Leaving the avocado gave it an extra boost to the texture and made it more hearty. I also doubled the amount of cucumber, which gave it an extra crunch. I ended up eating both halves of the avocado! YUMMY! The mixture is also good on top of crackers and toast! This is an excellent recipe and will become a staple in my cookbook!

From some of the reviews the instructions must have confused some of the cooks.   Having had stuffed Avocados often previously,  I sliced the avocado in half, removed the seed and PEELED the skin off.  Using the flesh as a "boat" placed it on top of lettuce on the plate and filled the halves with seafood mixture. Recommend using the recipe as a guide for your own favorite mixture. Use just enough mayo or cream cheese mixture to hold together but not soupy. Also  very good using a tuna or chicken mixture. 
Add fresh fruit to the plate, maybe sliced tomato and a mini muffin or crackers  to complete the meal.  
Often both avocado halves are used per serving with stuffing mix overflowing the avocado haves onto the lettuce on plate.  Nice for a luncheon meal.  I cook by guess and by golly as my mother would say.  Add & leave out as suits you.
5 stars when made as stated in my comments

After one bite of this, it was requested again for dinner tonight, so i think it's a winner. I used shrimp only, added the avocado back in, and tomatoes/red onions per another reviewer. I also added a splash of lime juice because I love lime on avocado and shrimp. I doubt I'll make it again tonight, but I will make this again!

I added the avocado also and didn't use the shell.  I served it on lettuce leaves.  It was an interesting dish but I thought it was a bit bland.  Maybe I didn't add enough pepper or I just prefer things with alot of pepper.  I'm not sure.  I didn't use cucumber so perhaps that's why.  Next time, I'll cut back on the mayo and add more fresh ground pepper and perhaps a little cayenne.  Overall, it was good, quick and easy.  I threw it together in under 5 minutes which is a major plus for me.

These are really good for a light lunch.  I omitted the cucumber, used cilantro instead of parsley, and added the chopped avocado in the mixture. I also added some spices to jazz things up a little because otherwise it's fairly bland.  By experimenting with my ingredients and seasonings I've discovered a mixture that I really like.  I've made these many times now!

Thanks for a delicious recipe!  I left out the cucumber and the parsley (I didn't have any) and substituted dill weed for the parsley.  It was delicious, and also taste good on top of a salad.
It was ready in less than 30 minutes, which makes it a keeper in my book!

This was pretty good! I used everything that the recipie calls for but added some other things. First, more cucumber, 3 tbsp red onion (I think it needed more than that too), added cayanne, and I used light ranch and mayo. Also I used the alvacado. I put one lemon on it to make sure it didnt brown. I would have put the lemon on the whole mixture but my husband hates lemonly stuff so I only put it on the alvacado. Also I used fresh dill, I think it really helped. My husband and I loved it.

This is really simple and pure tasting. I added a bit of garlic powder and just a pinch of cayenne and a few splashes of lemon juice. I also added the avocado chopped up..... Yum! Try it. I also used imitation lobster and it worked amazingly well.... Would be even better with the real thing- lobster or crab.

4 *s as written. I cubed 3 avocados and added it to the mixture and added more cucumber and it became 5 *s! I made this for a party and served it with wheat crackers. Sadly, there were no left overs to take home.

Wonderful!  Refreshing and just delicious.  We chopped the avocado and put it in the mix and spooned it back into the avocado shell.  We substituted cilantro for the parsley and added a little chopped red onion as well.  Making it for our 4th of July picnic today.  Can't wait to dig in again.  YUM!!  Thank you.

I was quite skeptical of this recipe at first...but it had so many good reviews that I couldn't resist. I'm glad I didn't! I turned out wonderfully. I followed some of the reader comments and I tossed in the avocado in the mix. I also added a dash or two of garlic powder. I will definitely be making this again!

Just like I've had in Mexico. Delicious! Definitely don't waste the avocado. I stuffed the avocados with the rest of the avocado and didn't have any crab so just used shrimp, but it would probably be even better with crab.

This was a great starting point for me but I made some changes according to other reviews and my own tastes. I used sushi-grade crab sticks (7 or 8), 6 jumbo shrimp, a shallot, cucumber and an avocado and finely chopped everything. Then, I mixed in some dill weed, cayenne, garlic powder, a little bit of light mayo, and ground black pepper. I also added a splash of light soy sauce and dill pickle juice. After mixing everything, I served it over a bed of chopped romaine lettuce and it was amazing!

This was fantastic!  I used ranch instead of the mayo, added dill weed and garlic powder, chopped the avocado, mised all together and served over roman lettuce. For the seafood I used frozen cocktail shrimp and REAL crabmeat allready flaked from the deli. Very easy to put together and serve.

When I tasted just the seafood salad, I thought something wasn't quite right and probably wouldn't be making again; however, the avacado put all of the flavors in perfect order. Used fake crab only but otherwise made recipe as is.  Served with "Easy Asparagus" and a thick steak au poivre.  My husband actually requested that we invite company for dinner just so I can make it all again.

Very, very good recipe.

Don't be shy to omit the crab. It's not really essential to the recipe and you can save lots of $ by not using it ;)

Use the fresh "dungeness" crab if you can get it and/or blue if you can't. Turns this recipe of mediocrate into food fit for a California King!

This is similar to a combination that we often make (salad shrimp on avocado with seafood cocktail sauce), but this is, oh, so much better. Not only does it include crab (I used fresh dungeness), but the cucumber adds a fresh touch that's great.

I used shrimp only, miracle whip and no cucumber and dried parsley, only because that's what I had to work with.  I tossed the shrimp in a little old bay first then added the dressing.  I put this on top of the halved avocados with a little lime juice and without removing any of the flesh.  I was really hesitant about using the miracle whip with this recipe because of its tang, however it really worked with the avocado.  It was delicious and super fast, I will make it again.

I first had this delicious appetizer on a cruise - and fell in love with the mixture of tastes and textures. 

I used this recipe for this years Valentines Day dinner at home - hubby LOVED it, and said it was just as good as the cruise. :)

TIP!! After you've sliced the avocado lengthwise, turn the avocado over and trim off the very "bottom" - the flat surface will keep your 'cado's from rolling around on the plate, and makes it easier to fill.  I also took a spoon, and scooped out the sliver of 'cado meat, then used that as a garnish on the top of the crabmeat mixture.

I didnt use any crabmeat, only shrimp. Used goat cheese, pine nuts and some parmasean cheese, lemon juice and everything else on the list.. FANTASTIC!

the second time i made this small plate it was tasty and fresh! I used half a cucumber (diced) lots of crab meat - no shrimp, i also kept the cravings of the avocado and added salt, lemon and peper to taste along with a sprinkle of garlic powder! it was amazingly fresh and  my boyfriend AND my 18 month old son DEVOURED IT!

These made a great, refreshing lunch!  I used ranch dressing instead of mayo, and didn't add any shrimp.  The cucumbers are a definite must, as well as mixing in the scooped out avocado.  Thanks!

This recipe is awesome! I had some grilled shrimp left over and used that instead of the canned kind. I also took the avocado that I scooped out and chopped it up and tossed it with the rest of the ingredients. Nice and refreshing, this one is a keeper!

I made this for my parents 30th anniversary meal (along w/crab stuffed manicotti & crusty french bread both from allrecipes). The only change I made was using the avacado I scraped out to make guacamole & put a layer of that in the avacado before I added the seafood mixture. It turned out great! Everyone loved it!

Hmmm...I struggled with this rating.  My only problem with this recipe is that the avocado is pretty unneccessary.  I guess it makes for an unusual presentation but you waste an awful lot of avocado.  The seafood salad (which is what this tastes like) was very good.  I think I may have added a little salt/pepper to taste but it was very good.  I actually diced up the avocado and threw it in the salad but I still wasted a lot.  I will forgo the whole avocado part the next time I make it unless I plan to make guacamole at the same time and can use that extra avocado for something.

Overall this was a yummy appetizer and very light.

These were just ok.  I liked everything that was in them, but, apparently not mixed all together.  Will try again though with different spices.

I used ranch dressing in place of the mayonnaise mixture and used only shrimp. I simply put a dollop of dressing on the avocado halves where I removed the pit and then put some of the small canned salad shrimp on top of that. It was an easy and impressive appetizer.

the most important comment i can contribute is to give a squeeze of LIME over the top. i helped my mom prepare this as an Easter appetizer. it was delicious. she used super lump canned crab, one pound for 8 advocado halves. we scooped out some of the advocado and left enough so that if you scrape with your fork with each bite of crab you got enough. but we did let people know to do so. also i think you should scoop out the cucumber seeds so it does not get watery if making ahead. we made the night before to make sure the flavors meld. so good!

Wonderful fresh take on healthy! I ate a ton of this in Mexico a few months ago and found this recipe to be a close second to their take on it. Such a fresh and amazing taste. Made exactly as written except used all shrimp, no crab. Perfect!

Soooo so good! Made it for dinner with baked potatoes for something a little bit more filling. Still had some filling left over dinner I doubled the recipe. Made sandwiches with it for lunch the next day. Took some advice and used some lemon juice and a little different seasoning. Turned it great!

Followed the recipe but also added tomatoes, cilantro, onions and replaced the mayo with ranch. Added extra cucumber as well.  Instead of stuffing the avacado, I sliced. The presentation was awesome but eating it was AMAZING. Delicious! It's a good thing I tripled the recipe! I might add fresh jalapenos next time. I served with home made Tostadas. My boyfriend couldnt get enough of it. Already planning to make again for Labor Day!

Pretty good. I omitted the shrimp and just used good lump crab, along with the scooped out avocado. I did add some garlic powder (next time would use minced garlic for better flavor), dill and a splash of lemon juice. We ate this with tortilla chips.

I followed this recipe exactly----I even did keep the avacado in---just some of it.  It truly was not the best use of good avacado and good shrimp and good crabmeat.  I don't know what I could have done differently to make it better.  It was bland, at best.

For me this was just an average recipe.   I found it to be very bland.  I added my favorite seafood seasoning and it still didn't do much for me.  It isn't a bad recipe, just not a real flavorful recipe.

Like most of the other reviewers, I couldn't waste the avocado and I cut it up and used it in the filling. I left a little layer of avocado though which was nice. I made this for a fancy appetizer for eight people and had forgotten to get more of the shrimp and crab meat, but my husband brought me a couple of cans of the shrimp, which I added to the filling right before I needed to fill and serve them. I agree with another user that the crab meat can be left out altogether. I didn't like the texture of it-fresh crab probably would've been better. I also added a little horseradish and some red onion, but not too much to overpower the other flavors. Overall a great recipe, one that I hope to make again.

This was probably one of the best seafood appetizers I have ever had! I can't wait to buy more avacados and make some more!

These were so good! Also very easy.  I used canned crab (to cut cost). Also frozen shrimp ranch instead of mayo and I also cut up the avadado flesh and threw it in

I added an extra cucumber and substituted old bay for the other spices. If you made this recipe w/out cucumber I suggest you try it again, Makes a world of difference.

Very nice - a great first course.  I used a bit of a chopped red hot cherry pepper & some chili powder - it was very nice, just a little heat. I scooped out the avocados and chopped them up and put in the mixture.  Will definitely make this again.

This was one of my favorite things to make last summer and it's finally warm enough to start making them again. I don't scoop out any of the avocado. I just spoon the mixture on top. A little sour cream or cream cheese mixed in makes it even better. I use the leftover mix to make sandwiches. Just spread on bread and toast in the oven. So good!

I made this as a started for our Valentine's dinner. It tasted great and was very easy. I prepared the filling ahead of time. The cucumber gave it such a clean, fresh taste. I used season salt to add some extra flavor. This is a keeper! My husband loved it and was bummed that I only made 4!

I loved this.  Made it last night as an appetizer for Valentines Day.  I used imitation crab because my son is allergic to real crab.  I added chopped avocado and used ranch instead of mayo.  I also squirted a little fresh lime juice in it.  The cucumbers really made this recipe.  It was light and fresh and I will definately make this again!  Thanks for sharing.

Well, Im guessing on the rating because you definatley need fresh real crab in this. With fresh it probably would have been better. I had some canned crabmeat in the cupboard that Ive been trying to find recipes that it's good in! This was not one of them, and have yet to find one. I ended up throwing it away. Boyfriend ate one but I think he was just being nice since I made them for the appetizer for our Valentine's Day dinner. I wish I wouldn't have waster my avocado on that "canned experiment." Oh well! I will try again with real fresh crabmeat after our trip to the coast this weekend. With all the rave reviews, it's got to be good right??

I scooped out the entire avocado, mostly because I think it gave a better presentation.  My entire family loved this recipe exactly as is, but I didn't really care for the sweetness, so I will try making this again without the cucumber.  Also, I used fake crab meat, which I won't do again because it also has a very sweet taste.

We added a little cayenne.  But other than that did what the recipe called for and it was a hit.  We just ate it like a "seafood salad" out of the avacado shell.  Very good.  nice start to a seafood meal....

These were very easy to prepare and were tasty, but I did feel they were missing *something*.  I will be making them again, but adding some lemon/lime juice and more of the scraped out avacado mixture.  I might even add some fresh dill the next time around.
