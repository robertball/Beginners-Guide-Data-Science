I added some spicy sausage to the mix when I made these. They had some kick to them but were  still really good. The BBQ sauce tamed the spicy a little bit. Sure didn’t have the kick when they were cold but still good. Definitely a big hit the first time around. Can’t wait to make them again but might use honey garlic sausage instead for a different flavour.

I did make some changes, used Mixed Italian cheese. Added a teaspoon of teriyaki and a teaspoon of soy sauce. Had no bread crumbs so used oatmeal and crackers . Came out great, will make again. I make my own Italian sausage and am going to give that a try instead of beef. I think it's going to be great!

I made it exactly as given. It was a great hit at my Scout's potlock. I gave the recipe to several people who asked for it.
