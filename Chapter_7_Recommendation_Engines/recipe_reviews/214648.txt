This is excellent! We just loved it! I followed the recipe adding a few things-a diced zucchini, 4 cloves garlic instead of one, 1 can (14 1/2 ounces) of stewed Italian seasoned tomatoes, chopped ,in addition to the crushed tomatoes (the ones i had weren't Italian-style), 1/4 cup dry red wine, 2 teaspoons sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes. Followed the directions and served it over thin spaghetti with garlic bread. Thank you so much for sharing! I will make this again and the bonus is that it is healthy and very low in fat, but it doesn't taste like it Yum! Also, I think olive oil should be used instead of vegetable, the olive oil gives it a wonderful flavor! Eating the leftovers and they are fantastic!

Oh man....this stuff is seriously good!!!!!  I followed the recipe, except I think I put in two cloves of garlic because we love it.  Just a great recipe.  And it can be made ahead of time and frozen!  THANK YOU SCARLETT!

This is one of those recipes I didn't have much time to dedicate myself into and it turned out so delicious! First, I browned the chicken in a pan with lots of onions, garlic and green pepper. Once ready, I transferred to the crockpot with the remaining ingredients and cooked on low for probably 4 hours. I didn't have any mushrooms, I didn't cube the chicken and at the end I forgot to add Parmesan, but even then was very flavorful. Next time I will make sure to have everything. Served over whole wheat egg noodles with steamed broccoli and cauliflower.

this is very good! However, I did follow another reviewers recommendation and floured the chicken before browning, added a 14 1/2 oz can of diced tomatoes in addition to the 28 oz crushed tomatoes, used red pepper instead of green, used 4 cloves of garlic and sauteed sliced mushrooms, and diced zucchini. When I turned it down to simmer, I added 1/4 cup dry red wine, a packet of Splenda and a pinch of red pepper flakes. THAT made it 5 star awesome!!! Without these changes, i feel that it would have just been OK.

This was great!  Added extra diced green/red peppers, zucchini, grated carrots (slide those veggies in where you can), 1/4 cup shakey parmesan cheese, used regular crushed tomatoes so added extra dried basil and oregano and a little brown sugar.  Threw it all in the slow cooker, served over WW egg noodles with a sprinkle of real parmesan on top.  Thanks for sharing your recipe!

Yummy, yummy, yummy!  Easy and quick to prepare.  I bumped up the garlic to 3 cloves and increased the Italian seasoning and basil. Over whole wheat pasta, this was flavorful and filling.

I made this recipe exactly as it is written, except added one extra bottle of Emeril's Marinara Sauce, as we like lots of sauce. It was easy & so delicious! It looked pretty too. Nice to dip garlic bread into. Served it with lightly buttered green beans on the side & the garlic toast. I highly recommend this recipe! Five Stars!

We really liked this recipe. We left out the green pepper because we do not care for it. It was a simple meal, great for a weeknight. The leftovers were great, too.

While I was frantically looking for the spelling of "Cacciatore"  I came across yours.  Since my darling boyfriend let me use his kitchen while he mowed . . .I had to hurry and prepare this before he re-entered "his space".   I like the simple, up-front ingredients that give it all the "American" italian bold flavors.  And, I had the kitchen tidy and the Merlot open when he returned exclaiming at the tangy fragrance pouring from the kitchen, his kitchen!   Loved the recipe! Thanks from Wiscony . . .

I appreciate how easy this recipe is and if you wanted, you could really jazz it up with more veggies, spices, ect., but I believe in rating the recipe "as is" and as is, it gets a high 3!

Excellent!!  I browned the chicken and then I removed it, sauted the onion & peppers first then added the mushrooms for a couple of minutes.  Next I added the crushed tomatoes and simmered.
I added the chicken while cooking the pasta so it wouldn't be over cooked.
I only used a couple of shakes of Italian seasoning.

Scarlett's Chicken Cacciatore Haiku: "Simple to prepare. I thought this was just okay, but husband loved it." I followed the recipe to the letter, (although I served over penne as I didn't have egg noodles), and I just didn't like how the sauce slid off the pasta and didn't provide any tasty "coat." But my husband adored it, and I did appreciate its simplicity, but I think if I make it again, I'll add some tomato paste or something to thicken it up.

EXCELLENT! Used more peppers (a variety of colors), onions and garlic than called for. Also added in some crushed pepper flakes for a little kick. While it was simmering, I noticed it was a little thick, so I just added in a little water and that made it the perfect consistancy. I could'nt find the 'Italian-style crushed tomatoes', so I just used crushed tomatoes w/ basil. I used less Italian seasoning and no dried basil (personal preference). This smelled amazing while it was cooking and made for an easy and delicious dinner. Will def be using this recipe again and again! Thanks for sharing. :)

Oh yeah this is really good. I was looking for something easy for dinner and found this. I did have to change it a bit. Hubby hates mushrooms (yes feel sorry for me) so I had to leave them out. I added extra garlic and seasonings and used spaghetti for the pasta since that is what I had on hand. Will make this again.

I too left out the green peppers as my hubby is very picky.  The only thing I changed was I used less onion and served it over spaghetti instead of egg noodles. Great one dish meal, just serve with garlic bread and you're good to go.

WOW!  This was a wonderful dish! My husband said that he's had cacciatore before in restaurants and homemade, but it's never been something that he specifically looks for on a menu, but this recipe completely changed his view of the meal. If we could give it 10 stars we would, it's delicious!!    Used left-over sauteed onions and chicken thigh meat, but other than that everything was just as printed and it was scrumptious!  Thank you Scarlett!

Really good! I made it according to the recipe except added two cloves of garlic. Next time I'll add some wine and a little sugar and maybe some additional green pepper.

I made this for dinner. Instead of the boneless chicken breasts, I used chicken that has already been cut up and cooked. It saved some time. Instead up cooking the egg noodles, I substituted my wife's Mediterranean Pasta entree, which had black olives, penne pasta and goat cheese. It was a hit.

This recipe was family approved.  I used 4 boneless chicken breast, red peppers instead of green because of what I had on hand, 28oz can of crushed tomatoes with basil, lots of garlic at least a heaping tablespoon of the minced from a jar, a med onion, and no mushrooms because my family doesn't like them... I kept the other seasonings the same and followed the cooking instructions.  I served over a box of linguini and it was delicious!!! Thank you for the recipe

Solid recipe, turned out great. Probably don't need to cook the chicken, etc quite as long as 15 minutes (10 min or less will do).

Easy enough to make.  I used chicken thighs  - they have more flavor & don’t tend to dry out.  I would add a few more spices.

I am vegetarian, so I used tofu instead of chicken. I added a splash of red wine (my signature sauce flavoring) and this dish was so tasty! My non veggie family members loved it as well. Great recipe! I will def make this again

I sort of used this as a base recipe since I was trying to use things out of my garden but it was delicious.  I used half a red pepper and half a yellow pepper, a red onion and fresh basil.  Left out the mushrooms since my kids don't like them.  Also didn't have italian flavored crushed tomatoes so I just added a bit of thyme along with some extra basil.  Turned our fantastic and is very easy to make.

I added mushrooms and a zucchini but basically followed the recipe as written.  When it was finished cooking it was very acidic so I added a tsp of sugar to cut.  Much better.

Very good flavor but thought the chicken was dried out a little.  We are going to try it with chicken tights instead.

I added 1/2 small can of sliced black olives and OMG!!!!  This was just too yummy for words. What's better is that it was super easy to make.

This was really easy to make and very tasty. My husband loves bell peppers so I added half a red pepper. I also used two small yellow onions instead of one and an extra clove of garlic. I'm not a fan of parsley so I omitted that. I used a little more black pepper to give it a little more bite, but think this would still be delicious even without the changes. Great recipe!

One of the best dishes I've tried. I added a small can of diced tomatoes just because. This dish was full of flavor and easy to prepare!

I made this very similar to the original recipe and it was fantastic. Very flavorful but not overwhelming! I didn't use mushrooms because I don't like them, I added additional garlic (3 small cloves total), and added diced red pepper in addition to the green pepper to up the veggies. I also didn't have parsley so I didn't use any. It got the seal of approval from my husband although I think he would prefer whole wheat spaghetti noodles over egg noodles. I will definitely make this again though and may add zucchini like another reviewer or even grated carrots just to get more veggies in!

I really liked this recipe! I used a little bit more garlic and added some tomato paste to thicken it up. Will definitely make again!

Used a little more garlic and added a half-cup of red wine. Used a mix of red and green pepper (just because I had it). Floured the chicken before searing, too. Very good, and leftovers freeze well.

My hubby made this dish on a night when I was just out of ideas and had no desire to cook. He follows recipes exactly so I know that he did nothing to alter this one except he used diced tomatoes rather than the crushed Italian style tomatoes - that's all we had on hand. It was so delicious that we decided that we can serve this to our very "discerning" guests as well. With hubby cooking and not totally acquainted with the kitchen, he started from scratch and we had dinner 1 1/2 hrs later!!! Great!

I just made this recipe tonight and followed the recipe exactly except I used linguine noodles instead of egg as I was out of those. While the flavor was good, the dish came out much too watery. Perhaps drained tomatoes would have been better or maybe adding some tomato paste? I did simmer the sauce longer trying to get it to thicken a bit, but it did not. I will fix this again but will have to make some modifications.
