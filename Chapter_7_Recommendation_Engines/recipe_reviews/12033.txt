A new family favorite. I adjusted the recipe just a bit. I added some heavy cream to the sauce to make a cream sauce and also some parmesan cheese
and left out the wine. It is absolutley delicious. My husband loved it.

All things considered, this turned out to be pretty tasty. I made a lot of substitutions (sake instead of wine, green peppers instead of red and yellow, and canned mushrooms) and a few omissions (didn't have any crushed red pepper, left out the salt.) One change I would make to the recipe is to wait to boil the pasta until you are simmering the rest of the mixture. I underestimated the time it would take to get to that step. Also, the sauce never thickened so I added a bit of corn starch towards the end.

Wish I could give 4.5 stars, almost perfect. Was looking for a recipe to use some fresh zucchini and pork sausage given to us and this did the trick! I  modified some things due to what I had on hand. Used bow tie pasta instead of penne (prettier than penne), a whole yellow onion, doubled all spices except salt (was a little bland before). Omitted the wine, peas, and parmesan. Only used one green pepper. Used chicken bullion instead of stock. Also had to add corn starch to thicken at the end. Next time I will be prepared and have the colored peppers on hand to improve the presentation. Deffinately a keeper for the recipe box.

Great recipe!  I think my husband could have eaten the whole dish by himself.  The sauce is very light and tasty as is, but I added 1/2 cup of heavy cream to thicken it up a bit. Next time I'll try adding cornstarch to thicken even more. I used sweet italian sausage instead of spicy and it was delicious! I'm sure I'll be making this often!

We all love this recipe.  Great weeknight dinner.  I cook the sausages seperately from the vegetables to reduce the cooking time.

This dish tasted good but I prefer my vegetables almost al dente and by sautéing them and then pretty much boiling them for another 20 minutes in the stock they turned out too mushy for my liking. I think next time I will skip the sautéing, boil in wine & stock for only 15 minutes and cut the stock down to 1-1/2 cups as I too needed to use cornstarch to thicken.

Yum!  I doubled this, so that there would be plenty to feed a family of four and produce leftovers for my hubby!  I made a couple minor changes:  First, I used Chardonnay instead of the Marsala wine because it is what I had.  Second, I left out the peas since my hubby is allergic.  We loved this!  Great recipe!

My husband and I felt like pasta but didn't want a heavy sauce. This recipe was just what we wanted. I omitted the zucchini and the peas. I used a whole yellow onion instead. We added a cubed chicken breast.We also added a chopped fresh tomato at the very end. It was really good and we'll definitely make it again!

A little time-consuming, but delicious. I used chardonnay instead of marsala (what exactly IS marsala wine??) and sweet Italian sausage and it was just fine, still plenty spicy.Thanks for another great recipe for my recipe box!!

This was great!  I added spaghetti sauce and reduced the liquid.  The veggies "hid"  in the sauce and were very tasty!  Great flavor.  I also sauteed the veggies in a little of the grease from the sausage instead of using olive oil. We are dairy free, so didn't use parmesan cheese or wine.  We used gluten free noodles and it was great. YUM!

Great dish!  I reserved some of the pasta water and added a little of that to thicken it up.

this was really good!  i was looking for a flavorful pasta and sausage dish without tomatoes, and this did the trick.  i used red cooking wine because that was all i had, and only used about half of the chicken stock. even so, the "sauce" never thickened, but i didn't think it mattered.  very good dinner!

Tastes great and light.  Only change I would make is reducing the stock to one cup.  The sauce never thickened, even after sitting.

Thought this came together very quickly. This rates closer to a 3.5 for me instead of four because of the spiciness (and we love spicy). Using mild sausage would yield a better end result or leave out the cayenne. Used a great deal more marsala and left out the peas because I didn't have any.

Great recipe!! Not difficult at all! I used Madeira wine instead (because it was what I had on hand). Lots of flavor and relatively quick considering all the sauteing you're doing.

this was very good.  i grilled my sausages, and lightly pan fried my veggies.  i removed the veggies from the pan and added the marsala wine and some softened cream cheese.  i did not use the chicken broth.  didn't measure the wine; just used what i had on hand.  it made a nice sauce.  i tightened it up a bit with a slurry.  and no peas. i forgot.  thanks for the recipe Nancy and Terry!

Delicious!  My whole family enjoyed this.  I substituted sweet Italian sausage for the spicy to make it more kid-friendly.  We'll be making this again!

This is a fabulous meal! It takes me
a couple hours to prepare this one,
albeit I'm not a gourmet chef. I
leave out the wine and peas, but add
a green bell pepper for even more color.
I like using multi-colored rotini as
the pasta.

Fantastic..., only thing I changed was the use of White cooking wine intead of marsala and the absence of mushrooms. Totally restaurant quality and a meal I would definitely serve to company.

This dish is a genuine restaurant-quality meal, not meant for a quick Tuesday-night dinner, more for an early Sunday dinner.  Absolutely outstanding!
