Great Cake. The directions fail to tell you where & when to do the vodka. Mix the vodka with your 3/4 cup of orange juice & rest of ingred. I only had French vanilla Instant pudding on hand......Turned out Fantastic!

I made this for a superbowl party and everyone loved it.  The glaze did absorb into the cake so I made another batch of glaze reducing the orange juice to two tablespoons and regalzed after it completely cooled.  I also added fresh orange zest to the glaze.  My husdand is a chef and loved this cake.

What a great idea! I could only find a red velvet cake mix and that seemed to work. My BF tasted the batter and said he couldn't taste the vodka, so I put an extra 1/4 cup - wooooh! I juiced an orange and added zest for the glaze but it was pretty runny; needs more powdered sugar. Also, step 2 forgets to list the addition of vodka, but that's when it goes in.

Everyone that tried this cake just loved it! I plan to make it often. I adjusted the glaze by using less orange juice so the glaze would be thicker and added a bit of orange flavoring to help mask the taste of powdered sugar.

It doesn't mention it, but you put the vodka in with the juice.  My friend and I made this together and brought it to a bunch of friends.  It was a hit...almost couldn't save any for later!!  I used the Cake Mixes from Scratch with Variations recipe's dry ingredients instead of a cake mix too.

I added orange zest to the cake batter and it made it even more delicious! The glaze was really good too. I added a teaspoon of vodka to the glaze as well, just add more 10x sugar to compensate for the extra liquid

Excellent and easy!  I didn't have a cake mix so I just used a basic scratch yellow cake and added a teaspoon of vanilla extract...then followed the screwdriver cake directions.  Next time I will add a 2nd layer of glaze and some orange zest to it, as suggested by others. Will make again soon!

This cake was good but it didn't have much flavor.  It was very moist but didn't have much orange flavor.  I had people ask me why it was called screwdriver cake.  If I make it again I will add extra orange flavor and do a different topping since this one just soaked in.

I love elevating cake mixes, so I thought this recipe was great.  I zested and orange and added to batter and glaze.  I also added a tsp of orange extract because I had it.  It was very moist and had great orange flavor.  I really do not think it would have had I not added the extra ingredients.

I made this with a gluten free cake mix and gf pudding mix.  It came out great and I got rave reviews.  I poked holes in the top prior to pouring the glace over it and love the orange flavoring.

Very easy, moist and deliciuos, but was not distinctive in flavor.  Tried to make alterations to help, even made it once with a strawberry cake mix, strawberry flavored vodka, and strawberry jam and strawberry vodka in the glaze (which was the best part), but still not anything to write home about.  If you are looking for a good, moist, cake, this is it.  If you are looking for show stopper cake with a different flavor...keep looking.

I made this for a party I was having a work.  Wow!  Everyone loved it! The only thing I did was added about 1 tsp. grated orange peel to the batter and did not make the glaze, just because I forgot to buy my confectioners sugar, and it was still wonderful.  Ratings were off the charts!

This cake is fabulous! I am eating a piece now (still warm from the oven). Great flavor and I don't even like the mixed drink screwdriver but this cake rocks! Thank you for sharing it.
