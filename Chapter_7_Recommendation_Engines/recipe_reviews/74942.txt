Even better if you quick saute the zucchini in a little olive oil/butter over medium high heat until they get a little caramelization, but still firm.  Then toss with pesto (preferably homemade) and a little parmesan.

As if this wasn't quick and easy enough, microwaving made it even more so. I used both zucchini and yellow squash and  homemade pesto I had frozen during the summer. The homemade stuff can't be beat!  When I mixed it in with the zucchini it looked like pesto overload but it turned out to be just the right amount. Something so delicious in under 5 minutes - unbelievable.

Is it OK to give something so simple 5 stars? I had a leftover zucchini and just wanted a new idea for seasoning it simply. I peeled and cut the zucchini into chunks, then put it in my steamer for about 10 minutes - still had some nice firmness. 
The pesto and fresh grated parmesan gave it a nice flavor. Will definitely be remembering this idea for the future. Thanks!

Even as I was mixing this, I thought "Zucchini, pesto, really?  Is this gonna be any good?"  Well, it is.  The other raters are right.  Zucchini and pesto definitely go together, and whoever figured that out is a genius.  The only thing I did differently was increase the parmesan to about 1/4 cup.  Four tablespoons of cheese just won't cut it for this girl.

This was great, I added some extra olive oil at the end and served it over spinach linguine as a main dish...  Everyone loved it, and it was filling!

Really yummy side dish! I never would have though to put pesto with zuccini, but it goes really well. The nice bit of parm. goes really well too :)

This was quite good. I kept the calories down by making a quick pesto of steamed broccoli, fresh basil, a little low fat tofu, a tablespoon of pine nuts and a dash of olive oil and seasonings.

This was a very fast side dish to make. I added a dash of garlic and pepper to kick it up a notch. This is a great recipe for that leftover garden squash. Easy and delicious.

Serviceable, but pesto deserves better. Use it on the Spinach and Feta Pita Bake instead.

If you like all the items individually this will be one of your favorites.  I was hoping something more would come out of the combination!  I think I'll just have to accept the fact that I'm not a huge squash fan and endure the endless amounts I get through my CSA : )

If you're a pesto person, as far as I'm concerned, anything you put it on will taste great and this was no exception. Thank you!

My husband and I loved this. I didn't steam our zucchini we sauteed it in a little olive oil and butter but I think next time we are going to try sauteing it in a little of the pesto. Just sprinkled the cheese over the top before eating totally awesome! :-)

I followed directions to the "T" and put on linguine for a complete meal. This will become a summer staple.

It really is as good as everyone says.  I used zucchini & yellow squash.  It gave it more color as well as working nicely together.
