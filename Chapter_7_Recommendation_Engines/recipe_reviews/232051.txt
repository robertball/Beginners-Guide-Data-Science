I tried this recipe for a pool party/ cookout.  It was eaten up before we even served desert. I also like to use this recipe substituting reese cups for the butterfingers.  I cut up 8-10 fun size reeses and then top the pie with Reese miniatures.  So yummy, always a crowd pleaser.

Very easy to make.  Turned out smooth and creamy!  Next time I think I will use my own graham cracker crust, but other then that great recipe.

I used a chocolate crust and just sprinkled the candy on top. It taste like a standard peanut butter pie or like the store bought frozen cream pies. I prefer using real whipped cream, but have had these pies with pb cups and peanuts which seemed a little less sweet than this one. I was testing recipes from the Halloween collection. This was fine, but I am still on the hunt.

Made it this weekend and everyone loved it! I used 5 Reese cups with Reese pieces for the batter and topped with Reese miniatures. I will try with the butter finger next time.

I made this exactly as stated. It was good, but it was too sweet. Instead of a creamy peanut butter taste, I was just hit with sugar. I will keep looking.
