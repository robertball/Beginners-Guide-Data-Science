I failed to buy the candy caoting and thought the sticky sauce would hold it all together.  I was way wrong!  Don't leave that part out!  The eyeballs were left sitting in the bottom of the bowl in the end.  I also left out the candy corn because I'm not a fan and that was not missed :)

I gave it 5 stars because I have been asked to share the recipe!

People seemed to like it, but I didn't care for the Cheez-Its. Store was out of eyeballs,  so I skipped that part.

Delicious snack. I left out the cheezits as I was doubtful of how the cheese snacks would go with the caramel coating.

Tasty and festive treat! Easy to make...I was going to double the batch, but the recipe alone was PLENTY!
