I have some extra acorn squash laying around so I decided to try your soup. Very very delicious. I like this type of a fall/winter harvest type of soup. Thankfully it is very forgiving as I needed to substitute buckwheat for the barley and spinach for the kale and didn't use any Thyme (wife dislikes it). All in all pretty close to the original recipe.Thanks Cynthia!

Tasty Healthy but a lot of work! Acorn Squash is a son of gun trying to peel and chop! I recommend prepping the squash the night before. Either way good recipe thanks:-)

I was looking for some healthy dinner options and came across this recipe. I thought it sounded good, but I never imagined how much I would love, love, love this soup! It's super easy to make and tastes even better than it sounds! My husband said it was one of his favorite meals that I've cooked for him and we've been married 4 years! It's a must try!

Made a couple of substitutions based on what I had on hand delicata squash basmati rice. Soup was delicious! We had a lot of leftovers. We shared it with a couple from our church and they loved it and asked for the recipe:)

Clean simple and easy! I m not a fan of pumpkin squash so I used crookneck squash and think it was just as good. I m in the learning phases of cooking and this was definitely tasty and healthy and not intimidating for someone learning like me.
