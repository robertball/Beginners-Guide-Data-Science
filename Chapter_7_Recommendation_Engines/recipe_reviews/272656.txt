Recipe creator here! Just a note: these are not intended to be a dupe of Starbucks Sous Vide Egg Bites. That would require different ingredients and a much different cooking method (either using a sous vide immersion circulator or a pressure cooker). Instead, I was looking to create a low fat breakfast option that was both portable and easy to reheat during the week.  Feel free to swap out the veggies, cheese and herbs for different flavor combinations. Enjoy!

These are really good and smell amazing when cooking. Such unassuming ingredients and tastes great. I'm going to tinker with seasonings and ingredients for next just to suit my personal taste, but great base recipe. Very filling as well. Thanks for the recipe!

Love this and the recipe is very flexible! I made with sundried tomatoes instead of red peppers. These are a hit EVERY TIME! Skipped the cottage cheese but plan on trying at some point.

Loved these!  The cottage cheese mixed in makes all the difference from other egg white muffins I’ve made before.  I used fresh red pepper instead of roasted. Pretty easy to mix in different veggies depending on what you have available!

Great breakfast treat! I added some chopped ham and onions and put them in the freezer to heat and eat later.

I skipped the spinach and used regular peppers but still very tasty and filling.  I really liked the creamy consistency too. My only issue is that the peppers rose to the top and therefore were not spread out evenly.

I used a mini muffin tin and Monterey Jack instead of feta but otherwise left the recipe alone.  It was tasty and I think they will freeze well.  Since so many of the copy cat recipes I’ve a seen for my beloved Starbucks  egg white bites use cottage cheese I was hoping these would give me the consistency I was looking for, but these are a little more loose in consistency than their commercial twin- that’s fine!  Just a thought for others who maybe be looking for the same.  These are a great base and would stand up to a variety of cheeses and fillings.

What a quick and easy option for a low carb breakfast!  I just made a dozen of these and they are very good!.  This is on par with Starbucks' sous vide egg bites.  I didn't have spinach today, so I substituted kale and chopped up  fresh red pepper in place of roasted jarred, although I think the roasted would've added another layer of flavor.  Use your imagination!  Add bacon or ham - it's all good!  And a great option for a bariatric pouch, too!
