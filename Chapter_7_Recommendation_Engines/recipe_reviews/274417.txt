This was SO good! It tasted like we were at the beach - which was the perfect escape for this dreary day. The only thing I would change would be to cut the mayonnaise in half. We prefer more crab and less mayo for our aioli.

I love spicy food and can take a lot of heat. This was just the right amount of spice and flavor. I wouldnâ€™t be afraid to try it if spicy food is not your thing. The absolute star of the show is the crab aioli. Man oh man is it delicious and soooo simple to make. I did not alter the recipe one bit and this will be a staple recipe in my house.
