As the writer of this recipe, I just want to point out some errors in the editing. 6 inches from the heat source is WAY too close and that's why people are getting burnt coconut! I'd say 12-15 inches, depending on your oven. Also, the vanilla ice cream is a key ingredient that got bumped into the description. It's not the same without it!

Really good.  I'm not sure I would like to have this for a dessert, though.  It just seems like a really quick, tasty snack.  My 4 year old loved it.  He doesn't usually eat pineapple, but had quite a few slices of this.  This really hits the spot if you are wanting something sweet, but don't really want to bake anything.

The coconut burnt well before 5min was up, so I pulled it out early.  I was expecting the brown sugar to crisp up...no such luck.  I won't make it again.  The fresh pineapple was better with it's natural sweetness.

Nice easy sweet dessert, if you have problems with the coconut burning, best to put it in with just the brown sugar first, once it starts to bubble, add the coconut, doing it this way, you have control of how brown it gets.   Be warned, coconut browns very quickly!

Delicious -- I found that less than half the sugar and the coconut was a good amount for us.

I'm making it tonight for myself, but I recently had it at a New Years Eve party and it was incredible!  My friend told me the exact way as the author (with the corrected 12") to make it.

The coconut burned before the sugar and pineapple were even warm.  We picked off the burnt coconut and put it back in a 350 degree oven for about 10 minutes.  My daughter loved it; my husband and I thought it was okay. Liked the flavors, but won't be making it again.

Mmmmmm. I can see how this would be absolutely delicious with Vanilla ice cream on the side, but it is fabulous just on it's own. A quick easy treat to satisfy a sweet tooth. Love it. I didn't get fancy with presentation. I cut up a fresh pineapple into a small baking pan and then sprinkled with the brown sugar and coconut. Easy to scoop out as an ice cream sundae topping....though Ive just been eating it out of the pan. lol

Had some crushed pineapple along with 2 slices of pineapple leftover from an upside down pineapple cake I made. I didn't want to throw it away so I found this instead.  Anyways I did mine with a twist on the stove and added some butter and corn starch to thicken it. I kind of want to add some bread to it now  and make it into something like a cobbler  =)
