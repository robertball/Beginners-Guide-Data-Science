Biscuits that make you go “mmmmm” when you eat them!  I have made these 3 times, and each time my family just inhales them.  They have been made with cheddar cheese, pepper jack cheese and Swiss cheese.  I love that they are very versatile and can be made with whatever cheese you have on hand.   The biscuits pare well with soups, meatloaf, steaks, chicken, casseroles, etc.  Thanks arich01 for the most delicious biscuit recipe in my recipe box!

Arich01, I cannot thank you enough for this keeper.  DH was amazed and said this was in his top ten favorite recipes, and that is quite a compliment - which I echo!

These were very easy to make, followed the recipe using baby grands biscuits. Cooking time was 15 plus minutes for me. Thanks for the recipe will definately make again.

These tasted good but we could not get them to cook thru! Ended up pulling them apart and spreading out on a baking sheet to finish cooking. We were pretty disappointed after all the awesome reviews.

We loved this! I used garlic powder instead of garlic salt, but that's the only change. I would probably use less butter next time, but my guys thought this was excellent.

I just happened to stumble upon this today when I was searching for some type of bread item to serve w/ our soup for dinner, and I'm so glad I did...This is AMAZING!!!!!! I had 2 cans of Grand's Jr.'s biscuits, so I just went w/ those. I don't keep garlic salt on hand, so I used garlic powder and added a quick shake or 2 of salt, which worked perfectly, and dried chives for the fresh, which I mixed into the butter mixture to re-hydrate them. I seriously could've just eaten this as the meal, lol,  that's how good it was...so buttery, cheesy, garlicky, and just all around delicious, oh, and so simple to make too! I will def be using this recipe often, as it has become a new favorite~YUM! Thanks, Arich01 for sharing this awesome recipe. :)

I made these biscuits for Easter and the family RAVED about them.  One note, though.  They were not cooked in the middle after 15-18 minutes.  I had to cut them into individual biscuits and put them back in the oven to finish.  But now that I know that, I'll be better prepared the next time I make them.  Yes, there will be a next time based on the way my family inhaled these biscuits.  (I used the Jr. buttermilk biscuits and they were the perfect size)

I almost wish I never found this recipe because of its nutritional value but it is amazing.  My husband asks for this at least once a week and it's so good I generally make it. Love the recipe!

I anticipated this would be phenomenal, but I was disappointed.  It took much longer than indicated to bake through properly and by that point the cheese was not cheesy anymore.  Also I would use half the garlic salt as it was too salty for my liking.  Otherwise, they tasted pretty good.  I may try again with just one can instead of two in the future.

These were really delicious; however, the baking time was several minutes longer than the recipe instructed. Bake them until you can see that they are no longer doughy in between each biscuit. Totally worth the wait! :)

These little gems are terrific!  Made them twice this weekend.  My three grandsons went wild for them.  The first time I used cheddar, and the second time used a Mexican blend.  Both were equally good.  Buttery, cheesy, garlicky, and easy.  Had to use dried chives, but I'm sure fresh would be even better.  Thanks, arich....a great contribution!!

Was checking out the buzz one day and everyone was talking about this recipe. I usually don't have biscuits in the frig. I happened to have some of the grands, just had 1 pack since they are bigger I did separate them just a bit more so they would bake completely. They turned out great Thanks arich01.

So simple & really very good! My can of biscuits was only 7 oz(I halved the recipe) & then eyeballed the butter/garlic salt. I didn't do a very good job eyeballing because it was super salty but we won't talk about that :)

These were o.k. but nothing I will make again. Still tasted too much like canned biscuits. Not sure what I was expecting but I didn't find it. I followed the recipe exactly.

The flavor was great, but I had to rebake it 3 times to get the bread to cook through. I was very embarrassed as I took it to a party.

This didn't turn out as well as I hoped. The biscuits didn't get done in the center. However, I'll try again. I like the idea of this.

I made this and it was good but parts of the biscuit dough wasn't done. I even cooked it longer than the directions said to. The parts that  were done were very tasty, maybe worth another try.

I didn't pay attention to the fact that the recipe calls for the 10 oz size bicuits, I used grands and that can is 16.3 oz so needless to say they didn't cook right But that is my fault, not the recipe and I suspect other folks have made the same mistake since others complained about the biscuits still being doughy. Will try again using correct size biscuits. The taste was good and I liked how easy they were to make.

Tried this tonight. Enjoyed the flavors. I cut back on the garlic salt as many suggested and found it suitable to our taste buds. When putting garlic butter on biscuit, must make certain garlicsalt is well blended in the butter otherwise you will have a biscuit or two with extra garlic salt on it and the saltiness is not pleasant. I think I will try this with garlic powder instead next time.  Baked these for 18 minutes and came out just right. Thank you, will do these again.
