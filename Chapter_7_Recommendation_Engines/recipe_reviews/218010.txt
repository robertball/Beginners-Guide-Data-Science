Tried it twice.  Too runny, doesn't set up.  Too much water.  Why are you boiling the blackberries?  Too hot of an oven.  I would change, make the simple syrup and pour over the uncooked blackberries, don't add the milk to the topping, just crumble it together with the butter, and turn down the heat!!!!  350 is correct temperature.

I think this was overly sweet and I cut down the sugar in the berries.  Maybe that would be a function of the berries.  This isn't my favorite blackberry cobbler but not the worst.  I think using juice instead of water and cutting down the sugar would help tremendously.

This was very good.  I followed the directions exactly as written, other than accidentally boiling the berries a little to long because I got busy!!!  I think they were boiling for 11 minutes instead of the 5...  It was perfect!!  I don't see why anyone would say different..  :)  Thank you!!!

This was a hit with my family... I used a pound cake recipe for the topping because that's how my Great Aunt made hers.... The berry syrup mix was awesome... Thanks to Mellissa and her Grandmother!

I tried this recipe, 1/2 blackberries 1/2 apples. Had only rave reviews. Did not have any problem with it setting, it sets as it cools. I actually had to make a second batch, since I didn't get a taste of the first!

I agree, the water is too much.  It would have come out really runny but I almost doubled the topping and it came out really good.  I also added a squeeze of lemon and orange juice to the fruit.

I made this with black raspberries and it turned out really well. I got scared because when it came out of the oven it looked runny and I had seen other reviews saying theirs was runny. But when I cut into it, it was perfectly fine. Black raspberries aren’t very sweet at all and have a lot of seeds but it turned out great, it wasn’t seedy and it wasn’t too sweet. I boiled the berries a little longer because I thought it looked a little runny when I was making it.

It turned out great I did make a few changes instead of using all purpose flour I used the sled rising one and it had a very fluffy top the only thing I recommend with this variation is to add a cup too 2 cups of more blackberries and I used a 24in pan.

Easy Peasy to make and it's beautiful too!
Just sweet enough with my rather tart blackberries.
I feel quite sure that I will be making this again!

Delicious and easy.  I do mix the cornstarch with the sugar and water first to insure it dissolves and I put dry ingredients in food processor and blend then add butter and blend again then add the milk and it forms a nice dough ball.  Great stuff!

This was my first attempt at making a homemade cobbler with a homemade crust.  I found this recipe to be exceptional.  I followed it as written - it made sense to me, it was quick and easy, and it turned out exactly as I anticipated.  I was just a little concerned about it setting up once it was baked, but the final result was spectacular.  I will definitely keep this recipe in my regulars, and would definitely substitute other fruits.

Almost exactly the cobbler my grandmother made and I've been looking for since I started cooking myself.  Loved it.

I did add way more cornstarch than the recipe called for like 5 tablespoons before I quit counting, good thing I did too because it was still pretty runny. I also added cinnamon, I just sprinkled it on the top to taste. Very very good

Love this recipe!  I tweaked it a little and did two cuts of blackberries and 2 cups of raspberries. It changes the flavor up a bit, which I like.

I used confectioners sugar, which made the it light and sweet. I also put a little butter in the baking dish and put in the oven while it was preheating. I reduced the butter by 1/2 cup. It was delicious. I will definitely make it again.

I have not tried this yet but it looks and reads exactly like my step-father-in-law's blackberry cobbler and peach cobbler recipe.  We liked it a bit runny so as to scoop warm juice over the vanilla ice cream.  He would boil the filling and put in bits and strips of crust so they were like sweet dumplings. Looking at yours makes my mouth water...Kudos!

It tastes really good but it does not set even though I kept adding cornstarch.
