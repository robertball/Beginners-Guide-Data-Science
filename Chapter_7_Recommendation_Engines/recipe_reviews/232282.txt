While the flavors on the glaze over the squash was excellent in flavor, its consistency was extremely viscous and unappealing once cooked. Because of the amount of dry ingredients in the honey, I was unable to drizzle it because it was just a sticky paste in the bowl, so added a little warm water to it. While trying to serve the squash, the glaze could be stretched a foot or longer!  If I made this again, the glaze would need some major tweaking.

Very good flavor. I recommend adding a small amount of water to the glaze mixture. Otherwise, it will be too paste-like for drizzling.

Heat the sauce on the stove, drizzles perfectly. After done, toss to coat.

super tasty. Instead of adding water like others say to avoid paste consistency, I used 3 tbsp melted butter in the mix and stirred it on low on the stove top. I didn't like the idea of ginger, so I swapped it with 1 tbsp chilli powder to even out the sweetness.

I read the other comments about the glaze and added a little water to the glaze. We had friends and family over for dinner and everyone loved it! I will be trolling my local farmers market in hopes of finding some more of this awesome squash.
