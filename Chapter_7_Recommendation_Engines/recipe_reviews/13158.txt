I could not find the crab roe and, we live in a town nicknamed "the seafood capitol".  I went without the roe and this was still a very tasty recipe for she-crab soup!  My husband wanted me to make more right away.

I found this recipe kind of bland. Perhaps with more Worcestershire or onion, it might be better.
