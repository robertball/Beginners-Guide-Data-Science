I came here looking to find my lost Italian Cream Cake recipe, this is it! I use Pecans instead of Walnuts, they are sweeter, and a touch of almond extract 1/4 tsp. But the special extra here is the butter instead of shortening called for in the other receipies. MMMMMM and better for you! I beat my egg whites until firm but not dry and fold carefully into batter. I probably use a full 1/2 cup of pecans also. Keep this refrigerated after baking or it will just literally melt in your mouth. Soften that butter before mixing too. You can use low fat cream cheese if you are cutting a few calories although you really won't notice them much. This one is a diet killer.

Chantel I think I love you! This is the absolute best recipe in the world. I always try tons of recipes till I find the perfect one, this is it, follow the recipe add a little less powdered sugar if you want. Another member said hers was a flop, you need to grease and flour your pan, never rely on only spray, let em cool quite a bit before you dump them out, and you have to wait until the cake is completley cooled to frost it, the icing is butter and cream cheese (and to die for) it will melt right off if the cake is not cool. I doubled the icing recipe, pile that stuff on there, ice all of it, that's the best part! Throw in lots of pecans (In love with nuts)unbelievable!!!

This was an addictive cake.  It got more moist the next cake.  I used less sugar and put toasted coconuts on top of the frosting.  Double maybe even triple the cream cheese but no need to double on the butter or sugar in the frosting recipe.  Highly recommend.

This is a great recipe, but be sure to beat the egg whites TO STIFF PEAKS! I made two cakes for my parents' 40th anniversary party--the first one was great but the second I got yolk mixed in with the whites, they didn't form peaks and the texture was markedly doughy. Luckily, I only needed one piece from the second cake! Also, I doubled the frosting as others did so the sides would be frosted, too.

Fantastic!!! I doubled the frosting, I added pecans to the frostings and decorated with some on the outside.  I made this for my aunts birthday, she loves Italian cream cake, they ordered one from her favorite bakery and I made one too, mine put the bakery cake to shame, I even got emails telling me how good this cake was, excellent, the frosting makes it so don't use any other kind of frosting on this cake or it will not be as good. Super!! Oh yeah I cut down the powdered sugar, I put in a cup "less" than called for in the frosting, it was plenty sweet.

I have made this recipe many times and most recently for an "end of class, we made it to graduation" celebration. Everyone just raved over it and I've had many people want to pay me to make them for anniversary, wedding, and birthday celebrations as well. This is the best recipe I have ever used. I do not use walnuts but use pecans (chopped) and stirred into both the batter and the frosting. Use less powdered sugar and I toast the coconut before using it in the batter and sprinkle the top. Yummers!!!

Delicious and different from the norm, at least for me.  The cake came out perfect - the first time.  It was moist and perfectly sweet.  If you're considering this as I was, I would highly recommend trying it.

The recipe sounded interesting so I thought I would try it.  It was VERY good! I took it to work and my co-workers loved it.  It was even better after a couple to days. I will definately make it again.

I first made this for a dinner party and everyone raved about how delicious it was and have been making it for Birthday's, Baby Showers, etc. ever since. For those who don't like it too sweet, it's also great with less confectioners's sugar in the frosting.

This cake is delicious. My family gobbled it all up. The only thing I will change next time is to toast the coconut before using it - the raw coconut gave the cake a funny taste/texture. But anyways this recipe is definitely a keeper.
**Update** I made this cake for Mother's Day, but I used a lighter frosting and put fresh strawberries between the layers and on top, and it was great! I love this cake recipe, it is very versitile.

I've made this cake 3 times now, and it is fantastic.  I add 1 tsp Almond Extract for a flavor boost.  I omitted it one time and did not enjoy it as much. Also, I whip the egg whites to stiff peaks and although it says fold in, its much more of a hand-mix-in to me.  Once I did not mix the egg whites well enough with the batter, and the texture of the cake came out odd, and there were little burnt peaks on the top of the cakes.  I also add 1 pkg cream cheese to the frosting and I frost the sides of the cake.  I top with coconut and nuts.

I love to bake and never made this type of cake before. I followed recipe with exception of using pecans instead of walnuts (personal preference) and omitted coconut (because I don't care for taste of it).  I don't know if it made a difference (may have with the lack of rising) but I reversed the egg whites/yolks in recipe by mistake.  Still got rave reviews from everyone who tried them at my party.  I made this cake into cupcakes. They did not rise like cupcakes usually do, they looked more like muffins--but they were very moist!  Made the frosting exactly as stated.  Found it to be a bit runnier than normal frosting.  It had good flavor but never hardened for me.  Didn't pose a problem with cupcakes.  Recipe made 30 cupcakes???  Would have made more but I filled the cups up 3/4th full.  If you make cupcakes, you could probably halve the icing recipe.  I had a lot left over.  Will make again.

Very, very rich and oh so buttery, or so I've heard. I haven't actually tried this cake (becuase I wanted to make it perfect which meant including every piece of dairy I can't eat in it) but I got a thumbs up from the parents.   Though I don't think I'll make it for awhile becuase It's so rich my parents are actually taking their sweet time with it, meaning it will probably be in the world for a long time. Also meaning I won't have chances to bake for a long time.   I baked it 10 minutes extra and instead of regular cream cheese I had berry so the frosting came out a odd purple color but still no complaints from the parents. All in all 4 stars.

Best cake I've ever made, both taste-wise and visual-wise. I made it for a baby shower and got rave reviews, very moist and good.  Made is exactly as the recipe but: instead of walnuts I put five gerber daisies in the middle and surrounded the top edge of the cake with blueberries,the bottom with blueberries and raspberries. It went well with the cream cheese frosting. This cake could be decorated differently for various occasions and seasons.  This is the only cake I'll make from now on!

This was EXCELLENT.  I made this for a Christmas Evening dinner party.  Risky move, since I had never made it before.  Everyone went nuts over it!  The only thing I did was double the frosting recipe so I could frost the entire cake and decorated the top of the cake with toasted coconut.  YUMMO!  Thank you Chantal.

I made this cake for my boyfriend's birthday. It was kinda labor intensive, but good. I tweaked the icing a little bit: made more so that I could frost the whole cake, but made it not quite so sweet. Bonus- it makes three layers, so if you mess one up like I did, you can just throw one away and no one has to know! Hahaha.

this is the best cake recipe ever!!!! the butter in the recipe is better than the shortening in the others.  I bake this for every special occassion or b-day.  it gets devoured!  ummm...tips? get the wilton cake pans, soften the butter & the cream cheese and i dont like to use so much confectioners sugar in the icing. its not necessary, plus it starts to get a funny taste.  but you can double up on the cream cheese vanilla and butter if u like a lot of icing between the layers... make sure when doubling up u add the confectioners sugar to taste...like i said u dont need all that sugar!  It is deeeelicious

Absolutely Delicious! I don't have 3 round cake pans so I made this in a Wilton Decorative pan (the large Heart)- I changed the baking time to 35 minutes at the same temp. It turned out great! I will say next time I may lower temp to 325 degrees and bake to 40 -45 minutes just because my edges did start to pull away from the pan before the center was completely done but no worries, the consistency and texture was the same all around. I also did cheat a bit... I used store bought cream cheese frosting and mixed in finely chopped pecans (I used pecans instead of walnuts in the mix because our family likes the flavor better)- After icing, I added a bit of chopped pecans as garnish w/ toasted coconut. Again, Delicious!- and we will definitely make this again!

This was a delicious finish to Easter dinner. My family RAVED, and my sister-in-law, a professional chef, requested it for her birthday! I took the leftovers to work, and made some lucky co-workers very happy. Thanks for a new favorite recipe!

I baked it in a 9x13 for about 30 - 35 minutes (non-stick pan) at 325.  I added coconut to the top (no more nuts).  I used walnuts instead of pecans.  Disolve the baking soda in the buttermilk.  Best cake ever!

I tried to find a recipe to mimic my wedding cake.  This is it!  Very moist and sweet.  I especially like that the recipe uses butter.  As with other reviews I went light on the powder sugar- (to taste) and added add'l 1/2 tsp. almond extract (careful not to use too much extract)-great cake!

I made this cake for Thanksgiving and everyone loved it. I made the layers ahead of time and froze them. I used pecans and also put pecans in the frosting instead of sprinkling on top. A wonderfully rich treat!!!

I made this cake for my wife & she/we LOVED it!  It is DELICIOUS!  So moist!!  Reminded us of consistency of really good & heavy banana bread. I'm a rookie baking so I followed the much appreciated  tips other reviewers submitted.  Here's what I did.  I followed the recipe & measurements except as follows:  I used 2 cups of cake flour (can't find any?? find recipe for it on side of a Argo corn starch container), 1 cup of pecans in batter rather than walnuts, no coconut in batter.  For the icing I doubled the amount of cream cheese (16 oz total) & left the sugar & butter measurements the same (totally sweet enough still).  Then I put the one cup of coconut & 1/4 cup of pecans on a flat pan on top rack of oven @ 400 degrees for less than 4 min (til the coconut JUST starts to brown).  Then I put this on JUST the top of the icing on top of the cake only.  I had the pure cream cheese icing on the sides of the cake.  Beautiful, delicious!  (I'm not a fan of coconut, but toasted I think it has a good flavor, esp w the pecans!)
I baked the cake for 25 min in 3- 9 inch pans sprayed w baking spray, then floured.  I did toss the cakes in the freezer for 20 min to cool em down so I could hurry up & put icing on them. 
 My wife is a expert cook & I blew her socks off with this recipe!  ;)

This recipe makes a very large cake, but I'm not complaining.  Every crumb was enjoyable.

OMG! This cake is awesome & very addictive.  It came out very moist and delicious.  I was worried at first because I didnt have 2 of my 9 inch pans so I used a 10 inch pan but it still came out great.

OMG!  WONDERFUL!  This cake was an absolute hit with my family and co-workers.  It was easy to make and the only ingredient that I didn't have on hand was buttermilk.  A quick trip to the store and I was ready.  My mother doesn't like coconut, but when she tasted the cake she was an instant fan.  This recipe is a keeper!

This was so moist and light. You have to really fold the whites in well or it won't bake evenly. I doubled the icing to frost the sides. I also toasted coconut and candied some walnuts to put on top. Beautiful on a cake pedestal!

I made this for a work lunch and everyone LOVED it!  I used two 8" square cake pans and I was able to get 16 slices (sliced cake in half then each half into 8) which is plenty for such a rich cake....could have made even thinner slices to equal 18 or 20.  I was lazy and didn't beat the whites (just mixed in the whole eggs) and that made a more dense cake but it was still sooo good.  I took another suggestion and used toasted coconut for the outside edges and lightly toasted walnuts for the top; very pretty.  Note - coconut toast very quicky in the oven!

I am the baker at an Italian restaurant, and I made this cake for my chef and coworkers. It got rave reviews. It was moist, tender, and delicious. I did leave out the walnuts per one cook's request, but most of us thought it would be even better with them. I also added toasted coconut to the top for a prettier presentation. We thought that added great flavor to the cake.

I did not have buttermilk, so I used heavy cream as suggested by other reviewers.  The cake turned out good and moist, however my husband and kids did not care for the coconut in the cake.  I did have to double the frosting to ice entire cake.  No need to double the sugar in the frosting though.  It is very sweet without adding double the sugar.

I made this cake for my mom's 74th birthday party, and everyone loved it! It turned out very moist and was a big hit! I added a bit of vanilla to the cake batter, and it tasted great. The cake itself is not very sweet, but the icing more than makes up for it. They complement each other very well. My egg whites never stiffened up, so I was a bit worried about how the cake would turn out, but everyone raved. I would definitely make this one again.

This cake is fabulous!!!  My children loved it.  I used 1 1/2 cups pecans and 2 cups coconut.  We like a nuttier cake.  I made this cake for the 4th and had to make a 2nd cake because it went so fast the first time.

BEST Italian Cream Cake Recipe - tried other recipes but this on is THE Best (has less oil & more buttermilk, creamier, not as oily). 

FOR CHRISTMAS--
This is a versatile recipe - great like it is with the nuts and coconut.  However, the 2nd time I made it, I  added to the batter (instead of pecans & coconut): 
1/2 cup chopped maraschino cherries, 1/2 cup chopped toasted almonds, 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips (Combine in a small bowl with a little flour to help distribute evenly & add to batter after folding in the stiff egg whites). 

Sprinkle more on top of cake for garnish.  This tastes like Cannolis with the cream cheese frosting.  I also added 1 tsp. almond flavor to the batter.  Superb!

I can't say that I'd had italian cream cake before now so maybe I just don't like this type of cake but I did not care for the spongy texture of the cake and the flavor was just okay for me. Thank you for the recipe but I won't take the time to try this one again.

I don't really like coconut flakes in a cake too much, but I baked it for some other people and they loved and raved about it, so if they're happy, then I'm even happier. (I tasted it and it was good, but it's just not my style. It was moist and everything was perfectly balanced without any alterations to it besides a little bit less walnuts.)

For years I've struggled to make a tasty, moist cake from scratch without success.   Until today that is.   This cake is fantastic, moist, flavorful and delicious. I will definitely make it again and again.   Thank you for sharing this.

I love this recipe!!! It has been a huge hit at family gatherings. I also use pecans and I double the frosting(cream cheese only) to ice the entire cake. I don't use as much confectioners sugar because I like to taste more of the cream cheese. I also decorate with extra coconut and pecans. But follow the directions and you will have an excellent cake also.

Something went wrong. While this cake turned out with a good texture and beautiful appearance, It simply did not taste too good. There's something missing. Could it be vanilla flavoring? It's like eating cream cheese on cornbread- yuck!

I halved the recipe which made it 12 cupcakes instead of 6 slices  of cake. I personally don't like the fact that it contains so many calories. I also think the cream cheese frosting is a bit sweet for my liking.

I didn't have buttermilk, so used heavy cream instead and increased that to about 2 to 2-1/2 C.  It turned out super moist and absolutely delish!  Even the cake batter was incredible.  Thank you for great recipe -- and my co-workers thank you, as well!

This was a very good cake, but I don't think I beat my egg whites long enough.  The reecipe didn't specify how long or to what consistency.

Great sandwich and soo easy. MAke sure skillet/griddle is at a low enough temperature so you don't burn the bread but still melt the cheese.

I could never understand why people raved about Italian cream cake until I made this one.  Now I get it!  Absolutely delicious.  I used 8" pans instead of 9", (didn't have 9" and did not want to spend the money or have to find a place for 3 more cake pans). It came out fine, just need to check it for time like you normally would. Next time I will add some almond extract as one reviewer suggested.  That would be awesome!  You can't go wrong with this recipe.

So delicious!!! My family devoured this cake. Followed cake recipe exactly. It turned out perfectly. On frosting I doubled the cream cheese as some others did, and used 3 cups of powdered sugar. Just right.  This cake was heavenly.  Will make again and again!

This cake is very moist and the icing is delicious!  The only thing I did differently (which was an error on my part and not intentional) was to add the baking soda to the flour and sift it.  My mom and I really like this recipe; thank you for sharing it!

Fabulous and delicious.  I only did two layers and kept the third layer separate, but still wonderful. And I did not have to make any additional frosting, there was plenty for those of us who aren't sugar fanatics.  Thanks for sharing this great recipe.

This cake was a disaster on so many levels. I admit I don't know what Italian Cream Cake ought to taste like, but surely it should taste better than this...? I followed the recipe, beat the egg whites to stiff peaks, used Wilton pans, didn't add any funny stuff to the batter, and my layers got stuck to the pans, the frosting doesn't stick to the cake, and the cake itself is like a cocnut version of carrot cake, except with next to no coconut flavor. This was a waste of time and money.

excellent recipe.  I used pecans instead of walnuts and put pecans in the frosting instead of just sprinkling on top.  It was definitely a hit.  I also think it tastes better after 1-days of making it.  Will definitely make this again!!

Very nice and moist cake. A big hit at the party I took it to.

Made a couple of changes:  decreased sugar in the cake to  1 1/2 cups.  Also used 2 pkg of Neufchatel cream cheese for the frosting in addition to decreasing the confectioner's sugar to 2 1/4 cup and adding 2 tsp of lemon juice.  The frosting was very light, not too sweet with just a hint of lemon that complemented the walnuts and coconut.  Also using fresh raspberries, blueberries or sliced strawberries between the layers and on the top added a whole new dimension.

This was delicious!  I made it for a birthday cake so I doubled the recipe and made a half sheet cake. I added a bit of almond flavoring (about 1/2 t) to the icing after reading that suggestion from another reviewer. The cake was a huge hit and was delicious. I baked the cake a day before and refrigerated it overnight then added frosting about an hour before I served it. The icing was super easy to work with and held up well for decorating!

This was soo good! Be sure to take it out of the oven while before toothpick comes out clean! A few moist pieces on toothpick is perfect. Had it with friends on Valentines Day. We all agreed it was wonderful! Toasted pecans instead of walnuts was only change.

This is an excellent recipe. I was concerned upon tasting the batter, but after it came out of the oven and was frosted, fantastic balance all the way around. I used recipe as is and subbed walnuts for pecans (allergies).

This Italian cream cake is what I've been looking for because, it included walnuts instead of pecans !!  I only used 1/2 cup of coconut.  I used 2 pkgs of cream cheese and 2 1/4 cups of confectioner's sugar for the icing.  I toasted coconut and sprinkled it on top of the cake for decoration.  Next time I will use 3 pkgs of cream cheese to have enough to pipe around cake border.

I made this. I used pecans instead of waknuts. I used some milk in the icing so it would not be to thick. Used 2 layers instead of 3. I did not have buttetmilk, so I put 2 teaspoon of vinegar in regular milk. It worked great. My family of 7 loved it. My husband is hard to please and he loved it. thanks for the recipe.

LOVE this recipe! As many others mentioned, I substituted pecans instead of the walnuts; I also used 1/2 c butter, 1/2 c oil and also added 1 t vanilla to the batter. This is a delicious, moist cake - and the cream cheese frosting is so creamy! Highly recommend it!!

I use pecans instead of walnuts, and I personally like a lot of frosting so I make more than the recipe calls for. If you double the frosting, you'll have plenty for the cake and a little extra. The cake recipe itself is spot-on. I've made this for birthdays, holidays, etc. and it always gets rave reviews.

I've made this recipe several times and it's fantastic! I usually use pecans instead of walnuts, definitely double the frosting although I used about half the powdered sugar and it's plenty sweet. Another tip- carefully blend in the egg whites. Don't over-mix them in. This cake is to die-for and always gets rave reviews when I take it places.

This cake was good but not great.  I even doubled the vanilla and added a tsp of almond extract to give it some flavor, but it just didn't taste like much of anything.  Even the frosting seemed a bit bland--although pleasantly bland.  Part of the issue might be that I had to leave out the nuts.  I didn't have three cake pans, so I made this in a bundt pan.  I cooked it for forty-five minutes and it came out great--very moist.  I know some other reviewers said they didn't have enough frosting, but with a bundt pan, I had plenty.  I topped it with more shredded coconut.

This is Emeril Lagassee Recipe right down to the pic, it is a great recipe though.I prefer this one over the II one it is about the same as Trisha Yearwoods funny how all these recipes are from "my Grandma" or someone. Really we all make it about the same. I never use more than 2 1/2 cups powdered sugar in frosting, a box is WAY to much and makes it feel gritty but I like the Italian Buttercream with regular sugar and egg whites for a smooth fantastic frosting try those!! The french bakers don't use powdered sugar and they do have a point it is great. See if you like it!
