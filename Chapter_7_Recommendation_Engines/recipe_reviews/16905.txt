Wonderful, Wonderful!!!! This was a great recipe! I have never made this type of dish before and it turned out great! I used a London broil as my meat; it was a very nice cut I might add! I did not use fresh parsley, all I had on had was dried, but it didn't matter, it was still great! I have put this in my personal cookbook! I just want to add to anyone who wants to try this, please remember this and make it a rule of thumb, my mother always told me, never cook with a wine that you wouldn't drink, because when the alcohol cooks off, all you have left is the flavor, so please, make sure you use a good wine. I recommend CK Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon. It is a great wine and reasonably priced.

This is very, very good! Be sure to deglaze your pan with about 1/2 cup of red or white wine after browning the meat and the veggies. You want every little bit of flavour! The house smelled amazing :)

I have made this twice and it is wonderful!  It is very easy to prepare and actually better than the same dish at our local French restaurant.  I have seen several comments about adding beef broth to replace some of the time wine.  Although, that may not be a bad idea I think it is important what type of red wine you use.  This recipe originally in France calls for a dark burgandy wine which cooks away nicely.  I love the deep rich flavor and would not advise a Chianti for instance or Zinfindel.

This was very good. After the initial 21/2 hours there was virtually no liquid left I had to add more wine. I also covered it the whole time. I would make this again.

Oh wow was this ever great! I omitted the mushrooms (don't like) and the canned onions (didn't have) and served with garlic butter crescent rolls. I used a fantastic French burgundy (Louis Jadot, for those who care), which I'm sure made all the difference. I never cook with a wine that I won't also have a glass of while cooking. My non-drinking, wine-hating fiancee loved this meal, and I loved that it was easy and made the house smell AMAZING. I would recommend going a little easy on the butter though, especially if you have really good non-stick cookware and don't need it, since the fat and the wine separated and was a tiny bit yucky to look at. Fantastic meal though, and one I'll be making again and again. It's probably best saved for a weekend when you have lots of time for it to cook though. I made mine on a Tuesday night after work and we didn't eat dinner until 9 o'clock - oops!

I have been looking for an easy Beef Bourguignon recipe for a while, and I think I'll stick with this one! I used fresh mushrooms and onions and cut the butter in half. I also put in whole cloves of garlic.

I disagree with everyone that replaced the red wine with beef broth.  That defeats the whole point of this classic dish!  It originated with a type of burgundy wine, hence the name!  However, I do think 2 cups red wine is a little much, so I used 1 cup red wine and 1 can beef broth with mine.  I also seasoned the beef with a little salt and pepper before adding the flour mixture to it.  And also, I didn't have canned onions, so I just omitted it.  It came out amazing!  Love this recipe!

Excellent dish! Easy to put together and then do something else while baking.  I will increase the initial cooking time from 2.5 hours to 3.0 hours to make the stew meat more tender.  The flavor and aroma were outstanding.  My grandchildren (3 and 10) asked for seconds!  I used 1 cup of wine and 1 cup of beef broth.  Don't be afraid of using the onions with children - they add flavor, but are not bitter nor hot!  This is definitely one of the best I have tried on this site.  Marty

This is definitely worth trying.  The meat comes out soooo tender and it's great served over egg noodles along with green peas. I chop regular onions into large peices and use this instead of the canned.  Hubby loved this one. I'm planning on making this for my family when I go on vacation (if I have time!).  I used 1 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth.  Excellent recipe Teri!

This one is easy to put together but somewhat time-consuming, but I think it's worth the effort. It came out delicious, and the pasta I served it over complemented it very nicely.

I love dishes like this that are almost like a comfort food.  This recipe is so easy to put together and the end result is an incredible surprise.  I have made this several times and always get rave reviews about it.  For those wishing to save a little bit of time, I can make a couple of suggestions.  First off, I would cut the stew meat into smaller pieces.  I do this anyways to remove a lot of the fat/gristle and make the bites much easier for the kids to handle.  I NEVER use the stew meat as it comes in the package.  The other thing is I made this completely on the stove and simmered it instead of doing the multiple steps of putting the beef in a pan, cooking it, putting it into a casserole dish and then cooking the veggies/wine mixture and baking.  I just put the coated beef into the pan with butter, add the onions, garlic, cook for a bit, add the mushrooms, carrots, herbs, and then add the wine.  Bring it to a boil, cover and lower it to simmer.  This usually cooks in about 1-1 1/2 hours or so.  The meat is nicely tender.  We like to serve it over mashed potatoes!

Wonderful depth of flavour. Be sure to use a good wine. We used one from the Annapolis Highlands Vineyard, very close to where we live. I cooked it for 75 people and at the end of the night there was about a teaspoon left for me. Perfect.

Four stars after much tweaking of the recipe. I used a top round london broil cut into 1" cubes. Browned the meat  in oil with out flour. Deglazed the pan with wine. Cooked one large onion in oil and a little butter. Degalzed again. Browned 1 lb. fresh mushrooms in 2 tbl butter, then added 5 cloves minced garlic. Cooked 2 minutes. Put meat and onions back in the pan. 2 cups red wine, 1 cup beef broth, bay leaf, pepper, 8 oz. baby carrots, 2 tbl tomato paste and a slurry of flour with a little water. Covered pan and put in the oven. Tasted after an hour. Added 1 tsp beef base (Better Than Boullion). An hour later I added 1 cup minced parsley. Half an hour later it was done. It came out delish. I would add frozen pearled onions next time. Not canned!

I loved this recipe. After browning the meat I cooked it in the slow cooker instead. I still sauted the veggies in the pan and degalzed with the wine, but hten added the whole mess to the slow cooker and mmmmm! tenderest, juiciest ever!

This was really outstanding and the whole family loved it.  The only changes I would make next time would be to add more carrots.  They tasted great and wish there would have been more.  Also, I used fresh quartered mushrooms instead of canned and I will not use the canned onions.  The canned onions didn't add anything to the dish and the pickled taste of them didn't go with the rest of the rich flavors.

The meat was amazingly tender and flavorful. I sauted fresh mushrooms with the onions and carrots. Didn't have the canned onions, so just left them out. I used 1 cup red wine, 1 can beef broth and cooked for 3 1/2 hours.  This dish was one of the best I've made.  My husband was very impressed!

This is a very good recipe that's easy to cook in the crockpot too.  I followed the recipe and let it simmer in my crockpot for 7-8 hours and it came out wonderfully!

With a couple minor changes, this recipe was awesome!! I used fresh sliced sweet onion and fresh mushrooms. I sauteed the mushrooms and onion in the butter after the meat and added to the pot. I also added 1 cup of beef broth after reducing the wine. One last and important step was that I marinated the meat for 24 hours in the wine with 2 tbsp of brandy, (from another recipe on this site). This was absolutely the most amazing dish! I didn't think it would be fair to write my own recipe for this, (because I made several changes). I absolutely think this cook needs this credit!! Thank you for sharing.

I read over 100 reviews of this before I made it.  As stew meat was $3.99 a pound, I chose a sirloin that was on sale for $2.99.  I left out the canned onions, and used dried parsley.  I watched it carefully and added more beef broth after about an hour.  I also used one cup wine and one cup beef broth.  Everyone loved it, but I will have to use more broth as it didn't have as much of the yummy gravy as we wanted.  I served it over noodles, but with more gravy, it would be great over mashed potatoes.     Next time I will use more mushrooms, fresh rather than canned, and saute with the onions and carrots.  I will use two cans beef broth, and one cup wine, and I will cut the beef into smaller pieces.     Check after the first hour, and about 45 minutes after that until done. Don't let it cook dry!

I used fresh mushrooms and sauteed them.  Really enjoyed this recipe but next time I will omit the canned onions.  I didn't feel they added anything.

I am not a 'beef stew' eater by any stretch, but this sounded like something my husband would enjoy.  We all raved about this dish!  I used half wine and half beef broth instead of all wine, omitted the canned onions and doubled the mushrooms instead.  I served it over large egg noodle dumplings, and we could not stop eating it!  My husband insisted I make this again, as it was by far the best stew dish he had tasted, and that's saying something as he is an excellent cook, and handles 75% of the 'chefing' in our home!  Thank you for sharing this, Teri!

This was a great recipe. I used a crockpot after browning the beef and cook it on high for 5 hours and i also used 1 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth and added baby carrots. I will be making this recipe many times. Thank you

Good basic recipe. Instead of using stew meat, I buy a rump roast or a chuck roast and cut it into 2" cubes. In addition, I cut salt pork into strips, brown it, and add that to the mixture (per Julia Child's version). Also, I add a tablespoon or two of tomato paste. Be sure to pat the meat dry with paper towels before flouring, or the meat will not brown properly. I use baby carrots rather than big sliced ones, also. Finally, do not skimp on the wine. Buy the best you can afford, and DO NOT hesitate to add more as the dish cooks if you find that it is drying out. Do this dish the justice it deserves by taking the time and care involved to do it properly.

I "reshaped" the recipe to items I had on hand but used most of the same indgredients. In addition to the chopped onion, I  used a box of Knorrs french onion soup mix, a cup of water along with the 2 cups of wine (Burgundy is the ONLY wine that should be used for a true "Bourguignon"). I used 1/2 pound of sliced fresh mushrooms, mixed into the onion/carrot in skillet. I seasoned the meat with garlic salt and pepper, then tossed in baggie with about a cup of flour. I had no canned onions, will next time. I used whole baby carrots for their appearance. I will definitely make this again using these minor changes..really done in 2 1/2 hours!! Fabulous with fluffy Jasmine rice!

Very good and easy, I just used baby carrots and left them whole for a fancy presentation.  I also used fresh mushrooms(hand on hand) and added them with the onions and carrots and skipped the ones at the end--delicous!!

I was really impressed on how easy this dish was to prepare and even more so on how amazing it turned out. Like many others I used 1c of wine and 1 cup of beef broth. The wonderful scent fills up the whole house and the gravy thickens quite nicely without the help of cornstarch. I used fresh mushrooms and onions and added them right from the begining. To compensate for the lack of canned mushroom water I just used the water I soaked the mushrooms in (about a 1/3 cup). I highly reccomend this recipe if you want to impress!

I think this turns out tasting like all five stars.  I've made it several times and it's definitely worth the effort.  I found that if it gets too thick or dryer than I would like, I just add milk to give it a slight creamy taste.  I would NOT add more wine.  Sometimes I also cut the burgundy wine back to 1 1/2 cups as it has a very distinct taste and sometimes I don't want that taste as strong.  You can also add diced potatoes after the first hour (about 1/2 inch cubes) and that makes a complete meal out of the dish.  This recipe is definitely the best I've found in awhile.  Thanks, Teri!

I made this for dinner last night and I have to say the house smelled wonderful all afternoon!  I did this on the stovetop, rather than in the oven.  I started by skipping the flour and browning the meat in butter, which I did in two batches in order to get a nice sear.  After browning, I removed it from the pan and added the onions (I used frozen pearl onions, unthawed, and no canned onions), carrots and garlic and sautéed for just 3-4 minutes.  I then added all of the remaining ingredients including the mushrooms (fresh).  I thought it needed more liquid, so I added 1 cup of beef broth.  I cooked this covered over a low simmer for 2 1/2 hours.  When reheating for dinner I made a roux of 3 T. softened butter and 3 T. flour, added some of the hot broth from the pot to temper it, and then added it all to the pot to thicken.  Worked perfectly.  This has a deep, rich flavor from the wine and we both enjoyed this one!  I’ll definitely make it again.

Wow!!!  So impressive!  We loved it, the meat was soooooo tender and tasty!  I used burgundy cooking wine, and it was totally fine.  Also used an extra onion, instead of the canned, and eliminated the mushrooms (yuck).  Added more carrots, since it is the only way my family will eat veggies, and substituted 6 oz beef broth for the mushroom liquid.  Cooked about 2 cups of wide egg noodles, and stirred them into the mixture for the last half hour.  Will definitely make this again.... Thanks!

One word...YUMMY! I browned the meat & threw the whole thing into a crock pot. The house smelled great for hours & the meat was SO tender! My family loved it and asked for more. The leftovers never made it past lunch the next day! 
I will make this a lot!

I have cooked this 5 or 6 times now and each time everyone compliments me!! So thank you Teri.  I followed the advice in reviews and used half measure of wine and used additional beef stock to compensate.  Changed canned mushrooms for fresh mushrooms and left out canned onions. Great, easy recipe.

I seldom do a recipe for guests the first time I make something but in reading this one felt the ingredience made good culinary sense.

The next time I prepare this I'll use a different kind of onion. I used the pickled ones in error I think. I'll also do this in the slow cooker. That's a no brainer as far as I can tell. Also I may add a cup of sour cream just before serving. I'd imagine that will blow my guests away! It was perfect over noodles with a loaf of hot Italian bread.

Pretty good.  My meat ended up drying out pretty badly, even with adding about an additional cup of beef broth.  The red wine "gravy" was good over butter noodles but we kind of ate around the meat.  Thanks for the recipe!  Just not for us.

Eh. This was allright.... My hubs treated me to a Valentine's dinner at Gibson's Steakhouse & I made this for him him. While this wasn't "terrible," it wasn't what I hoped for either. This is certainly less time consuming than Julia Child's recipe, but as I have discovered, there's no substitute for the "real" thing. I pretty much followed Teri's directions to the letter w/ the exception of a few (minor) changes. While sautéing my veggies, I added a few strips of (cut-up) bacon. I also subbed seasoned salt for plain table salt & doubled the amount of carrots called for (mine were sm.). I too had to add extra liquid (during the final 1/2 hr. of cooking). Not wanting my broth to taste too "winey," I switched to beef stock. I ended up adding ~ 1/2 c. worth. I used my lg. Le Creuset Dutch oven for everything, but still had to remove my meat in order to make room to cook my veggies. My choice of wine was Louis Jadot's  Pinor noir, 2006, Burgundy, France. NOTE: You will find canned pearl onions in your grocer's veggie aisle. DO NOT look for them next to the olives as that variety is marinated in vinegar & best suited for cocktails or the like, NOT for cooking! I'm surprised how many reviewers didn't add onions... they make the dish, IMHO. Served over egg noodles w/ a spinach salad (spinach salad I) & French baguettes on the side, this was an "OK" meal. Thanks for sharing, Teri! :)

I used round-steak cut in cubes.  Browned in olive oil.  I used an electric fry pan.  Removed.  Added 2 tbsp of butter then sauteed fresh, sliced onions & carrots.  After onions were caramelized a bit, I added fresh mushrooms & garlic.  Once the mushrooms had softened, I put meat back in and added 2 1/2 cups of cabernet sauvignon.  Simmered for 1 hours very low, added some salt & 1/2 tsp. of worcestershire sauce.  Simmered until butter noodles were done.  Then added 1/8 cup of sour cream to beef right before serving.  There was plenty of sauce!!  We loved it!

This was absolutely fantastic. I saw the movie Julie and Julia and was inspired to make something a tad more simple than the exact Beef Bourguignon recipe by Julia Child. This was VERY simple actually. I have one regret with mine and that is that I did not use fresh mushrooms. I should know better. I just don't like the way canned mushrooms taste. I can't say it ruined the recipe though. I pretty much followed the recipe to the letter but, like others, I wasn't able to find canned onions either. I used two cups of Louis Jadot Beaujolais-Villages 2009 for my wine. My boyfriend loved it. We can't stop talking about how fantastic it turned out. The meat was like butter under your fork and it was very filling. We ate it by itself with a salad and snow peas. A+ Recipe.

I don't know what I could have possibly done wrong with this, but I didn't like it much at all. I thought the flavor was way too potent. Now, that's not to say noone liked it. The men thought is was great, but I probably wont make it again...

This is so very delicious and robust with flavor! I served this over egg noodles, and everyone really enjoyed this. I did use 1 cup red wine and 1 cup beef broth, used 1 cup diced onions (instead of jarred), and 1 cup sliced mushrooms (instead of canned). I let the mushrooms and onions cook the entire time, I did not add them in later. Very rich and filling, I would definitley make this dish again! Thanks for sharing :)

This is one of my families favorite dishes! Some reviewers have said they feel the wine is over powering. I do not agree but I use a wine that I would also drink (cabernets). I sauté fresh mushrooms and add them the last 30 minutes (don't used canned).  I also omit the canned onions.  Serve with lightly buttered egg noodles.  So easy too, just has a long cooking time.  Great dish to serve guests.  The meat just falls apart.

This is absolutely delicious and the smell is making my mouth water!  My few changes only made this good recipe better:  fresh mushrooms, fresh pearl onions, baby fingerling carrots.  I cooked the mushrooms, onions and carrots until glazed in the same skillet as the meat, added all to a slow cooker, de-glazed the skillet with wine and added it to the slow cooker, along with the thyme and bay leaf.  I added a cup of water during cooking and it's beautiful!  Thank you for a wonderful recipe.

My finished product was really wonderful, but I'm only rating this recipe 4 stars because I think the changes are what made it exceptional! 1 cup cab and 1 cup beef broth, then I deglazed the pan with 1/4 cup cognac before putting the entire thing in my cast iron French Oven for 3 hours at 300* I sauteed fresh sliced mushrooms in butter and garlic before adding them to the dish the last 30 minutes of cook time, and served over egg noodles. Amazing!

I like the rich flavor of this dish, great with dry wine.  I had fully cooked the meat before baking and it was too tough. Next time I make this I will try fresh mushrooms, the canned ones were too slimy. I don't think this dish reheats well though.

I made this last night and it came out very well. I did make the following minor modifications:
-used 1c beef broth and 1 1/4 c red wine
-once I added the wine and spices to the onions, carrots and garlic, I heated for a  bit and tasted for flavoring.
-I added a touch of balsamic vinegar and dried fines herbes to the wine/broth mixture BEFORE pouring over the meat.
-I used fresh mushrooms and a handful (about a dozen) pearl onions. I boiled the pearl onions for about 3-4 minutes and peeled before adding and then baking the final 30 minutes. 
-I reduced the heat on my oven to 335 degrees for the final 30 minutes.
-I served over wide egg noodles and with salad and pistolettes. 
-The quality of the red wine is important. I suggest a hearty red. I used a merlot/cabernet blend.

This was a wonderful stew. I missed the other reviewers suggestions to add less wine, and made it with all the wine. To my surprise (and delight) my 1 and 3 year olds (and my husband) all loved it. It did have a VERY strong red wine flavor, though, so next time I may cut the wine by 1/2 cup.

I skipped the mushrooms (due to personal preference) and also didn't add the canned onions at the end -- I thought it already had enough onions with the fresh one.

Also, I browned everything in the pan, and then let it cook in the crockpot for 3 hours. The meat was very tender, and the house smelled wonderful. I served it over buttered egg noodles.

Thanks for a great recipe. I will make this again.

I made beef bourguignon once before and I swear it took me 5 hours (from Joy of Cooking) but this one...amazingly easy and the house smelled wonderful.  I couldn't find canned onions so I bought the large ones in a jar and YUM!!!  Served over wide noodles with peas on the side.  Real "comfort food" while enjoying our coldest winter in years!

We were alittle leary of trying this but are very glad we did. Only thing I did different was use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. We really liked this over rice with a spinach salad.

Oh! This was so wonderful! The aroma alone drove my family mad, so it didn't stay in the oven the full time. I didn't have any wine, so I used beef broth instead. I served it over mashed potatoes with a side salad. This was a definite hit, I will be making this often!

An incredible beef stew!  I've tried lots of them on AR, and I must say this is in the top three.  Why four stars?  The cooking teperature is way off.  I was really leary when I saw 350 for 3 hours, so I adjusted to 300*, so glad I did.  When I checked this at 2 hours most of the liquid was gone, so I added a cup of beef broth and put the temperature down to 250*.  I added some beautiful french green beans, and sauteed everything in the same pot.  I also added the mushrooms and onions at the start.  I added some extra thyme and some crushed rosemary, too.  I added a slurry of beef broth and cornstarch the last 15 minutes to thicken the gravy, too.  Delicious and plenty of leftovers went in the freezer.  Thanks for sharing, Teri.

So many wonderful flavors in this bourguignon!  I served it over red skinned garlic mashed potatoes and it really pulled out the minced garlic in the recipe.  Thanks for a great recipe!

Absolutely amazing! I'm not much of a cook (think grilled cheese...) and this was so easy, the house smelled amazing, and my husband was so impressed! I used 2 cloves of garlic, omitted the canned onions, substituted fresh mushrooms for the canned and added them with the onions and carrots. I also used wine to deglaze the pan and scrape up all the little yummy bits before sauteing the veggies. Will definitely make this again, thanks for the recipe!

We are trying to watch calories so I cut back on the butter, used lean beef and served over spaghetti squash(a surprisingly good sub for pasta).

Tasty, but why use canned ingredients when you can add fresh ones? I diced carrots, sliced onions and mushrooms, and added some peas (only thing that was not fresh). I really do think it makes all the difference.  I also subbed olive oil instead of butter -- it's just what I cook with and I think it's better for you and tastes better :).

I thought this recipe was a real winner and I'll make it again and again.  One Question.   What are mushroom crowns?  The ingredients list calls for a six ounce can of sliced mushrooms, but step 4 of the directions says to add mushroom crowns to the  other ingredients.  Are mushroom crowns the same as mushroom caps?  Are the canned sliced mushrooms cut from the cap.  The ones I bought looked like sliced pieces of both the cap and the stems.

Excellent!  I browned the meat and then put it in the crockpot with the rest of the ingredients, without sauteeing the veggies, for 8 hours and it was melt in your mouth delicious!  I did end up using all red wine, canned mushrooms and canned onions.  Great served with a nice glass of red wine and crusty French bread to soak up the juices.

This was amazing!  I replaced half the salt with some onion and garlic salt, halved the butter, doubled all the vegetables, added two potatoes and celery stalks, used 10 oz of fresh mushrooms, and skipped the canned onions.  I also added 1/2 cup of vegetable broth in lieu of canned mushroom liquid.  I used a quality bordeaux wine, and it came out just delicious - the beef was incredibly tender, there was plenty of gravy, and it smelled incredible.  I think reviewers who complained that it was too dry must have forgotten to cook it covered, and those who said it was too "winey" likely used a poor quality or inappropriate type of wine.  According to Julia Child's recipe, you should only use a Beaujolais, Cote du Rhone, Bordeaux-St. Emilion, Burgundy, or Chianti.

This recipe was worth every bit of effort, time and gathering of ingredients! 10 STARS if you ask me. I couldn't find any jarred, canned, or frozen pearl onions so I bought the fresh ones and peeled them. THIS TOOK FOREVER but was sooooooo worth it. Also I used venison (deer) chunks instead of beef and it was absolutley gourmet!!!!!! Perfect!

Very good recipe. Easy to make. I did everything in one pan that could go from the cooktop to the oven in an effort to reduce clean up. I just removed the beef to a plate once it was browned, and then added it back in after the onions had softened. Like others, I made mine with half the wine (I am not a big wine fan) and half beef stock. I had to adda bit more beef stock as it cooked to have a nice amount of sauce at the end. I'm also hopelessly addicted to a bit of sweet in my meal, so I added less than a Tbsp, of brown sugar to the sauce. I suppose this will make Beef Bourguignon purests cringe, but I liked that slight sweeting it gave the sauce. The sauce thickened up very nicely in the oven and really clung to the meart. Instead of canned mushrooms, I sauted sliced mushrooms and added those. Served with noodles. It was a very nice meal for our family.

This was a big hit!  Prepared in the morning (using only fresh ingredients) and add them all to the crockpot and cooked on low for the day.  Was ready for the noodles by the time everyone arrived home for dinner.  Will be making again!!

Because of a busy schedule I cooked this in my slow cooker and it turned out very tender and tasty. I dredged the meat in flour and browned it in the a.m., put meat in the slow cooker with all ingredients except for the canned onions and then added 2 beef boullion for more flavor.  I added the canned onion 1 hour before serving. I cooked on low for a total of 7 hours and it turned out well. The only thing I would do different next time is that I would add a little cornstarch as a thickener, we prefer a stew like consistency. Served over buttered egg noodles with Merlot, very good.

Everyone served adored this meal.
However, I must challenge the advertisement that this yields four servings. Two pounds of meat yields quite a bit more than four servings unless you're feeding hungry teenaged boys. 
For what its worth this comes out more like a casserole and although moist and tender I prefer my Beef Bourguinon to be more of a stew.

I used Yellowtail Merlot.

Very good!  Meat was delicious - I'm sure the red wine was the 'key'.  I served this over kluski noodles, my husband loved it!  Next time I will not add the canned onions; with onions already in the recipe, it's just not necessary.

Loved it.  Couldn't use red wine because not prepared, but if it was this good with chicken stock substitute, I can't wait to try with red wine.  Served it with potatoes, french bread, and salad.  Will make again.

This had a good flavor - I made it exactly as the recipe instructed - but it was very rich and will serve at least 6 people.  Next time I will serve it over rice or noodles and add more liquid.

This is a very good recipe. I didnt add the canned onions (didnt have), just added more chopped to compensate. Be sure to deglaze the pan after browning your meat with some of the red wine to get all the bits up. Will definately make again. Thanks!

Great recipe! The recipe as written is excellent and does not need tinkered with! That said, I tried this the original way first and then tinkered. :-)

My personal recommendation will sound weird. Use fresh mushrooms and add them at the beginning (not the weird part). Instead of 2 cups of wine, use 1 1/4 cup of wine and (this is the weird part) 3/4 cup of strong black coffee. Also add 1/4 teaspoon of chopped rosemary.

I followed the recipe for the most part. I used 1 1/2 cups wine & 1 1/2 cup beef broth. Used just a tad of Thyme (not my favorite). I did not have canned onions so I sliced an onion. I put it over egg noodles. This was very good, but I was not sure I would make it again,  untill I ate the left overs the next day. That was awesome! .

Rather bland and boring, I'm afraid.  The recipe as written doesn't have enough liquid and I nearly burnt it before I realized something was wrong and added water.

This turned out great.  Following the advice of other reviewers, I checked on this to make sure too much liquid didn't evaporate and added beef broth as needed.  I also covered my glass baking dish with aluminum foil plus the glass lid just to keep as much liquid from escaping as possible.  I used 1 1/2 onions plus 6 oz. fresh sliced mushrooms (sauteed all the veggies at once in step 2) instead of adding the canned vegetables near the end.  I was able to decrease the butter to 3 T. total for the sauteing steps.  I tasted the recipe and thought it needed just a little more herb flavor...so I added a 1/2 tsp. oregano.

This was delicious and my house smelled wonderful. A few suggestions: use the "big chunk" stew meat as it is easier to manouver; i added additional butter when sauteing the vegetables (there was no butter left on the skillet after browining the meat). I added cellery chuncks along with the canned onions and mushrooms, I also added some extra wine for the veggies to cook in as it looked a little dry. I used  Carmenere wine, which is a dryer version of the Malbec...it is important to use a wine that you like, as you can taste it in the sauce. I cooked this for 3 hours however it seems like it was done after 2, and It looked over cooked by the time it was done. Still good though, I served the bourguignon over a bed of egg noodle. We'll make again, thanks for sharing!

This is the first time I have ever made Beef Bourguignon.  It turned out great and looked fantastic!!  I used fresh mushrooms as canned have no flavor and too much sodium.  I substituted half of the wine with beef broth as I had read in previous reviews.  Next time I will use both cups of red wine as called for to enhance the wine flavor.  Better the next day.

Like a couple of other reviewers, I found that all of the liquid was pretty much gone by the end of the first 2.5 hour cooking period. I added a little more wine (making sure to save some for sipping!), and a little beef broth. That kept everything bubbling away when I put in the mushrooms and pearl onions. All in all, this had some good flavor, and came out very tender.

only ok as written. I think it should more appropriately be called beef with wine stew. canned mushrooms and onions? I don't understand using canned ingredients especially ones so tasteless.

My husband and I though this recipe was okay, I did not use all the wine recommended, I used 1 and a half cups, and a half cup beef broth.  My father in law loved the dish and couldn't get enough of it.

Superb!! The tough part was smelling the aroma from the oven while it was simmering away and not be tempted to mop up some sauce with whatever piece of bread around the kitchen. Now I know why this classic recipe was featured in Julie and Julia. Note: added bacon at the beginning to get some bacon fat to brown the meat; added 2 Tbs. of tomato paste; used fresh mushrooms, quartered and sauteed in butter; parsley was only for garnishing; used Rioja red wine because it´s readily available here.

This was AWESOME!!!  I made it for my in-laws and they were super impressed!  I did add a touch more wine after the 2½ hour mark and it seemed to need something so I added approx. 2T sugar.  Turned out so, so, so yummy!  I used Robert Mandovi Cabernet Sauvignon (pardon me if I spelled any of that wrong).  Thank you Teri, I will be making this again!!!!!

This was quite good.  I ended up using a cheap Lambrusco wine b/c I read you should only cook with what you like to drink and I prefer sweeter wines.  The flavor was very good a little sweetness to it.  Maybe next time I will try a burgundy wine and see how that changes it.  I also used fresh mushrooms and sauted them with the onion and carrots which I think really made it great.  I did not add the canned onion at the end b/c I really don't like canned vegetables.  Probably could cut back on the salt for our taste and I used 2 cloves of garlic.  Like other reviews you need to keep an eye on it in the oven b/c even covered mine started to get really brown after 1 1/2 hrs.  So, I added beef broth to keep it from burning.  Total cook time was about 2 1/2 hrs v/s 3 and it was plenty done and browning again.

A tolerable Bourgugnon, certainly not noteworthy.  Should you use this recipe, check the dish in the oven regularly to see if (probably will) the liquid evaporates.  This is not mentioned in the recipe. When this happens the food will both dry out & burn.     Adding fresh mushrooms in place of the canned will improve flavour.

I have been looking for a good beef bourguignon recipe ever since my husband and I first tried it in a little cafe near Notre Dame in Paris..... and this one comes pretty darn close!  Very good and very tasty.  Makes the whole house smell nice while cooking too, perfect for a chilly fall or winter day where you crave some comfort food.  I followed the recipe to the letter, and the beef came out very tender, juicy and flavorful.  Next time I will decrease the canned onions by about 1/2 (a bit too many for my taste), and maybe add some small potatoes to cook along with everything else and soak up that delicious sauce.  Will definitely make this one again.  Thanks, Teri!  :)

No doubt a five star dish.  I made EXACTLY as called for using Holland House Red Cooking Wine.  I was leary of this dish since I do not enjoy drinking red wine, but much to my surprise the meat had a wonderful flavor.  It was perfectly tender and there was just enough sauce.  Next time I will make slightly more sauce, use extra carrots (which took on the flavor beautifully) and use fresh mushrooms instead of canned. YUM YUM YUM!

This was really good.  I had to take a picture, because the picture that was on the recipe didn't look anything like my results.  I used fresh mushrooms and frozen pearl onions, but not as much onion as called for; I just eyeballed the amount.  I did everything else the way the recipe instructed.

Very good recipe. I halved the recipe, and therefore shortened the baking time by half an hour. If I ever half it again (which I won't, because it's a great recipe and I would want to make a big portion), I would decrease it by a further half an hour, just so it would stay moist. It tasted very good and homey, and I would definitely make this again and again. Unlike another user, I didn't find this time consuming cooking-wise, it was pretty simple. I made it for dinner with my boyfriend, and when he came back for seconds, the portion was bigger than the first one! We also drank the wine I used for the cooking. I highly recommend this, and thank you for sharing!

We really liked this meal. I served it over rice but think next time I will serve with roast potatoes (yum). I did take some short cuts by buying shredded carrots and pre diced onions. I added the mushroom juice as per recipe but did not add them at the end because I am not fond of the mushroom texture. I also did not add the canned onions since it already had onions in it. My husband ate this 3 times (twice for leftovers!).

This was amazing!  I used the full 2c called for in the recipe and I though the end result was amazing--and not really "winey" tasting.  I cooked in the oven in a large rectangular pan--the meat was alsmost glazed with vegetables and sauce.  A real winner with everyone who tried it.

You won't regret making this recipe!SO, SO DELICIOUS!  I used 3 1/2 lbs. of boneless round steak, 2 onions and 12 oz. fresh mushrooms, sliced.  Also, 1 can beef broth and 1 1/2 cups wine due to more meat (I still had to add about 1 more cup of beef broth at the end of cooking to give some gravy).  My 1 year old ate it up and we thought it was delectable!! One of the best recipes I have tried on this site!

What a treat! We were pleasantly surprised at the great flavor of this dish! I purchased tenderized stew meat which proved to be a good idea! I used about 1 cup of oat flour (due to wheat allergy) and tossed the flour, salt and pepper in a plastic bag with the meat - it worked out GREAT and all the meat was nicely coated! I also used 2 bay leaves to boost the flavor. I substituted white wine for red because I didn't have any on hand, and it really didn't detract from the flavor at all. I skipped adding the canned mushrooms and onions at the end (I forgot!) and LOVED it just the same! Served over rice.

Excellent recipe, easy to prepare, tasted great, meat was very tender, my whole family loved it! I made it with 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup burgundy wine as others suggested. It had just a hint of wine flavor, which was good because I have a two year old. However, if I were making for just adults, I would cut the broth and add more wine to get the true burgundy flavor.

Made this for a dinner party and all the guests really loved it.  I used the suggestions from other raters and used half the wine with 1 cup of beef broth and served it over a bed of egg noodles.  It tasted awesome!  My husband was hoping for leftovers and wants me to make it again next week when his mother visits!  The smell in the house was incredible too. This recipe was so easy too.  I will definitely be making this time and time again.

Absolutely delicious.  I used a chuck roast cut up and added a cup of beef broth to the 2 cups of wine.  The meat melted in your mouth.

Delicious!  Used one can beef broth and the rest merlot.  Next time I'll try with a different cut of beef besides "stew meat".   My husband thought it was stringy tasting although tender.  Both loved the flavor.  Had it over rotini noodles.  We both wanted more vegetables and sauce with it... will work on that.  Will add potatoes as well next time.
Also added half a can of evaporated milk at the end because my husband likes things creamy.  I would have been happy without it but we both thought it was better with the milk.  I did not put in the canned onions, didn't feel like I was missing anything but next time I'll buy it to be complete.

Well, I doubled the recipe thinking I was having more guests.  Turned out it was only 4 of us and there were no leftovers!!  I served it over wide egg noodles with a caesar salad and crusty French bread.  It did come out drier than I expected so I may add more liquid next time.  I used 1 cup beef broth and 1 cup wine.  Also, could not find "canned" onions anywhere but found pearl onions in a jar.  Don't know if that's the same thing but it's what I used.  Would definately make this again.

This was a delicious recipe! I used fresh mushrooms and small pearl onions at the end... but sauteed them a bit before adding. Also instead of the juice from the canned mushrooms, I added 1/2c. beef broth.
It is a meal I will make again!

Very easy and straight forward to understand- could not believe how tender it stayed even through reheating.  Make sure when reheating to remove any congealed fat before reheating in oven. Soo yummy!!

Delicious! My carrots were small so I used 4 and I didn't used canned mushrooms or onions (I did throw in a few of the real thing). Surprisingly the wine was gone after 2 1/2 hours so I had to add some water and a bullion cube (and a bit more flour) but it still came out wonderful.

Very good and authentic flavor as written (my husband is French and loved it).  In future, I would add more liquid to have more of the delicious sauce to sop up with some crusty bread.  Thanks for the recipe, this one's a keeper!

I don't usually write a review for the recipes that I get, but this one is amazing.  I worked at a restaurant that served this dish and I loved it then, so I decided to try it.  It surpassed my expectations.  I followed the recipe to the t.  Great stuff, thanks Teri.

Very good, solid recipe, except it really was dry the next day.  I'd recommend doubling the amount of butter and adding 1 cup of beef broth, in addition to the 2 cups of a full-bodied red wine.  Other than that, it's a straightforward, classic recipe that works!  I really do think that the only reason that I took away a star is that my left overs needed lots of doctoring.  But the food right out of the oven was perfect.

Yummy. I followed the directions exactly and it was very good. However, the red wine I used was a store brand and although added flavor wasn't strong enough so I probably will use 1 cup beef stock and 1 cup red wine next time or just buy a darker red.

This is a great comforting meal! I used a burgundy wine, and fresh onions & mushrooms (I didn't have the canned). I served it with egg noodles, but will probably do mashed potatoes next time! Thanks for such an easy & delicious meal!

Would loved to have given this more than 3 stars, but can't.  Here's why..after the first 2 1/2 hours cooking, and I followed the directions to a T, it was already so dry and burned on the top.  I had to literally scrape it off the bottom and sides to even be able to finish preparing per the directions.  I added the remaining ingredients and then turned the oven down to 300 to spare any more drying.  After it was all said and done, I had to make a rue of beef broth, flour and water just so we could eat it.  With that, it was tolerable, but barely. Sadly, I don't think this is a recipe I will ever make again.

This was ok. I served it with egg noodles but what would have been MUCH better is if I were to serve with mashed potatoes. Smelled great. I also wished that I would have cut the roast up in smaller cubes.

Wonderful!  I followed the recipe pretty close, except I didn't use stew beef.  I cut up a chuck roast.  I used 2 cups of red wine (per recipe) and it was a wonderfully rich and smooth sauce.  My daughter who is 12 liked it a lot, and she is picky.  I also decided on fresh mushrooms instead of canned per my preference.  I just lightly sauteed them and added to the dish about 30 minutes prior to ready to serve time.  Served over egg noodles.  Very filling.  I was amazed at how easy this was, just need a bit of time to cook it, that's all.

It was better than average. Made as written. Overall, well.....I guess the best way to describe it is - We enjoyed it, smelled wonderful cooking, but when it came time to wrap up the leftovers, no one was interested.

I tried this a couple ways. The first time I made it as written . It was good but for me the wine overwhelmed the beef flavor a bit. The next time I made it with 1 cup of wine and 
1cup of beef broth. Personally I liked it better the 2nd way better.Like the other posters I only used fresh onion and mushrooms and nothing canned.Fwiw I used merlot. Interestingly a previous poster that used merlot said it had too much wine taste...so maybe it's a merlot issue

Your house will smell amazing as this cooks! I've made it three times, and each time it's received rave reviews from my guests. 

It's worth using the freshest ingredients possible for the best results (the first time I used dried garlic, and it wasn't as good). I also throw in a handful of low-fat bacon bits and half teaspoon of beef soup base; otherwise it comes out a little too sweet for my taste.

I use a Louis Jadot Pinot Noir (a true burgundy wine), and it carmelizes everything beautifully. When I add the mushrooms for the last 30 min of cooking, I also add a cup of chopped celery, just because I like it. 

This is a perfect dish for entertaining, as it can bake away while you socialize with your guests. Great, solid recipe, well worth the time.

Don't be intimidated!  You can make the famous Beef Bourguignon!  Follow these directions and it's sure to turn out right.
Can someone please suggest a good cut of meat?  I just guessed when I got to the store and lucked out.  
The canned onions are optional, in my opinion.

This recipe is amazing. The only change I made was to add fresh mushrooms instead of canned ones (I always think that fresh mushrooms taste incredibly better). It turned out great and it is definitely a keeper. Thanks.

Loved it!  I used a Cabernet Sauvignon, only 1 cup though as we are not wine drinkers.  Made up the liquid difference with beef stock.  Also didn't have canned (or pearl) onions, so I just added more largely chopped onion in the beginning.  I served this with mashed potatoes tonight, but want to try it over egg noodles next time.  Think it will need more gravy for that, so I will increase both the wine and stock.  Oh, I did add a few slices of crumbled bacon, but not sure it would be missed.  Time consuming when you factor in the oven stint, but not difficult.  Definitely worth it! (Update: definitely add crumbled bacon, it IS missed; use 3-4 largely chopped carrots, great served with roasted potatoes.)  Remains one of my fave meals found here.

Amazing. I've made Julia Child's recipe before but its a litte complicated to follow. This was just like hers. I used 1/2 a yellow onoin instead of canned and fresh mushrooms. I like to use pinot nior wine. I find a merlot of chianti leaves too much of a wine taste.  I serve in a bowl on top of mashed potatoes.

Wonderful!  Made this exactly according to recipe.  Not a wine person, so didn't exactly know what to get, but ended up with a Dornfelder.  Great taste!  Was a little time consuming, but cannot wait to make this for hubby when he returns for R & R.  Thanks for sharing!

Beef Bourguignon II Haiku: "What are canned onions? (I used frozen pearl onions.) Elegant, great dish!" My only regret w/ this meal was that I didn't have any egg noodles to serve it over, so instead, we licked our bowls and spoons clean and obliterated the whole thing. I'm anxious to make it again, although probably not on a 99 degree afternoon, since it goes from hot stovetop to hot oven for several hours, but holllly cow, this rocked! Oh and what in the heck are canned onions, b/c I know that it's not those little fried onion-ey things that folks use for casseroles. I used frozen pearl onions to absolutely fantastic results. DINNER WIN!

This was very good! I browned the meat using olive oil only and used 4 medium sized fresh mushrooms (sliced) and 1/2 of a large fresh white onion chopped. I didn't need to bake it anywhere near as long as called for. I think that would have definitely overcooked the beef.

I have mixed feelings about this recipe so I'm giving a neutral rating.    The flavor was really nice but I felt it needed something.  Not salt type seasonings....I think more in the line of herbs.  If I made again I would add Herbs de Provence.  I would also up the wine to 3 cups and add 1 cup of beef stock.  The liquid ratio is way off, as written, for extended cooking.  I was using a cast iron dutch oven w/ a cast iron lid in the oven....and that is super resistant to evaporation and I was still adding liquid which isn't ideal.  I would prefer to have added it all at the beginning so the flavors could have that time to develop.    All that said, the meat was extremely tender and my family was overall happy with the outcome.  (I served with homemade egg noodles and quick sauteed crisp haricots verts.)  Basically, as written, the recipe would not be extremely successful.  However, it has 5 star potential with very little tweaking!  Thanks for sharing!!

having just made this for the first time i am happy to say that this recipe, while time-consuming, is pretty goof-proof. i'm a hopeless meddler, though, so i made a few changes. not a mushroom person, so during the final half hour i added a can of whole new potatoes and a can of diced new potatoes. additionally i wanted a beef bourguignon that was more stew than casserole so i initially used two cups of beef stock and one cup of pinot noir, and added one more cup of stock and a half cup more wine when preparing it for the last 30-40 minutes of cooking. that's about 2x the liquid recommended but it reduced so steadily that when it came out of the oven i was left with about seven servings. to thicken it without having to add a roux i stirred into the initial wine and vegetables an 8 oz can of tomato paste. if you're the kind of cook who works on instinct, feel free to mess around with this recipe. fancy name, fancy reputation... but beef stew is what you make it. purists may balk, but your guests will line up for seconds.

This  was wonderful! I have never made something like this so I didn't know what to expect. I followed the recipe as written and it was delicious! I served it with mashed potatoes, yum!!  I will say this is something kids may not like because of the flavor the wine gives, which just made more for adults!  ***Just a note..make sure you cook with a red wine you would drink, I'm not a red wine person, but thankfully my husband is and had some on hand.

This was fabulous. My husband who NEVER eats leftovers actually said he would eat it the next night for dinner. Wow! I took the advice from others and used a good wine, I do need to put it in a larger dish next time, I had a problem with spillage. Thank you for a great recipe.

This is fantastic. I made it last night with a Cabernet, I think a burgundy will add more balance. Real onions instead of canned and added fresh mushroom caps for last 30 minutes. Mushrooms held texture. I will be making it for our tailgate at the Packer Game on Sunday after Christmas.

I made this recipe just the way it is here without the thyme cause I was out of it. I used goya cooking wine(red) and along with the salt and pepper I spinkled the meat with adobe.(goya) This was really a great meal. I had it with potatos but the next time I'm going to put it over buttered noodles. Thanks alot for the recipe Teri.

I have to go with three stars because when I checked the flavour toward the end of cooking it was rather bland and tasteless.  I used my favourite wine too. I added some beef stock to amp up the flavour.  With this addition, it was 4 stars and the family seemed to enjoy it.

Really enjoyed this easy to make recipe.  Followed the recipe except for the pearl onions and used fresh mushrooms. Used chuck roast meat and two small  bottles of cabernet Sauvignon ( each bottle was one cup). For anyone who thought this was dried out, make sure to use the right size casserole dish so the liquid doesn't dry out too fast.

This dish was a big hit at my house.  I did take the other reviewers advice and replace one cup of read wine with one cup of beef broth.  I omitted the canned onions because I didn't have any on hand.  I also added a little tomato paste to brighten the flavor. Over all great dish will make again.

Yum!  I did have a problem with keeping sauce in the pan.  I checked after about 40 minutes in the oven to see if it needed to be stirred and all the wine sauce had been soaked up!  I only had chicken stock on hand so I added about half a can then after 40 more minutes it was pretty much soaked all up again.  Ended up adding the rest of the can of broth and cooking the rest of the time and it was perfect.  Instead of canned mushrooms I used fresh and sauteed them with the onions, carrots and garlic.  The last thirty minutes of cook time I threw in some pearl onions instead of the canned and they made a great addition.  Served over extra thick egg noodles!

My sister makes this stew all the time and I just had to try this one. I had the same problem as MOLSON7...After 2.5 hours it was really dried out.  I had to add a can of chicken broth (all I had on hand) and some more wine. I don't think that effected the flavor of the stew.  I NEVER cook with canned veggies and now I know why.  That part alone was not appealing to me in this stew. I have made much better stew! The meat in this turned out dry.  I even had my butcher cut me a fatty roast for my stew meat to make more tender and less dry. My kids(which are not picky eaters) would not eat this.  I hate giving bad reviews but I had to on this one. Sorry

This recipe was delicious!  I left out the canned mushrooms and onions due to personal preference but that was the only change I made.  The meat was so tender and I loved the red wine sauce.  We served over mashed potatoes.  I will be making this again!  Thank you.

This was good, but a little too oily for my taste so next time I will be sure to cut down the butter. I will also cut down the flour a little. One note that changed the outcome drastically, I'm under 21 and had to substitute beef broth for the wine which is a shame since I feel like that's what it was missing. I'll have to make it again when I'm legal!

Rarely give so-so reviews, but this time it is not more then 3 stars. The only thing I changed - was emitting the canned onions. The rest - followed the recipe to a T. The house smelled absolutely wonderful all the time during cooking. My husband and I were anticipating a great dinner. Turned out - not really.Canned mushrooms tasted pretty bad - sour (definitely use fresh ones if you this recipe). The meat was on the dry side. Very dissapointed...

I made this tonight and got only so so reviews from my family. The one thing that they ALL complained about was the pearl onions! I followed the recipe very closely, only using fresh sauteed mushrooms in place of the canned ones, and cutting the red wine down to 1 cup with 1 cup of beef stock as suggested by another reviewer. My husband rated this only 2.5 stars, but I thought it was really good, so I am giving it 4. Perhaps next time I will used chopped onions in place of the whole pearl onions. This did make my house smell wonderful while it was in the oven! I will make this again, adjusting the ingredients to my family's liking.

My husband, a hige fan of my all recipes meals, said to rate this one with 5 stars! Smelled SO good cooking all day and was pretty easy - something I could get together and into the oven during my 16 month old's naptime! Like others, I substituted 1 cup of wine with beef broth - I used Merlot as that was all I had. I used jarred onions - not sure if they are different from canned onions, but turned out delish! No need to add any other liquids at the end - there was plenty of "gravy", and I had to let it cook an extra half an hour at 200*. A keeper!

This was a very good recipe. I used boneless  short ribs instead of stew meat, and omitted the canned onions and mushrooms (dinner companion does'nt care for either) I left everything else the same, and the meal turned out wonderful I served this over rice and it made a wonderful gravy. Thanks much for sharing.

Excellent dish.  I doubled and used equal parts beef broth and wine.  Also added some celery with the carrots.  Used some diced salt pork (per more traditional recipes)- brown that then use the drippings to brown your vegetables.  Also added a tablespoon of tomato paste per many other recipes.  Finally, managed to make this a one pot dish in my dutch oven- did everything in there.  Also, cooked at 300 for three hours, removed meat and simmered on top of stove until reduced a bit.  Very very good dish.  Very rich. Served on extra wide egg noodles.

Wow, yannow when even after you've read a ton of reviews you are skeptical about trying recipe? Well I was worried to death that I had wasted 3 1/2 pounds of beef roast all the way up until we pulled it out of the oven. It was divine! Everyone had seconds. Smelled so cook when cooking. We used a cut up top round roast and it was tender, flavorful, and hearty. I was worried it was going to boil in the wine and be tough but whatever it did in there is fine with me! We used a roaster and covered with foil We'll be making again and again. We didn't use canned onions because we didn't have any. And we added a little garlic powder and garlic salt to the dish before it went into the oven. Kudos to the chef!

Fairly easy, tasty and a good party dish.  I doubled the recipe portions to serve 8 people.  I served this dish with rosemary roasted potatos, a green salad with sugared pecans, and a crusty baguette.  I made a few modifications: 1) I added a 14 oz can of chicken stock during cooking since fluid reduces rapidly (but next time I will substitute additional wine instead of stock for a more "french" flavor), 2) I doubled the amount of garlic, and I added a small can of tomato paste.  I cooked everything in a Le Creuset casserole dish, including the initial browning of meat, so minimal clean up and no lost flavor.  I cooked COVERED for the last hour so I didn't lose too much fluid from the sauce.  Make sure you have a spatula handy to scrape all the great stuff off your cooking pot... you don't want to lose those scrumptious flavors. My friends told me they could smell the delicious aroma all the way down the block!

This is my first time making something like this and I will make it again! I followed the recipe the best I could, I didn't find canned onions (I don't think they exist in my part of the world) and I had a little less than 2lbs of meat. So I added more raw onions, another can of mushrooms and one more carrot. The wine I chose was a reasonably priced real Burgundy. I also served the stew over whole wheat egg noodles. It came out so good, the meat was tender and the gravy was so yummy, I can't wait to have the leftovers.

This made my house smell so savory-flavory good! My whole family loved it and I recommend using fresh mushrooms.  I checked my liquid at the end of the covered bake time and had to add about a half cup of beef boullion because I had forgotten that I had only added one and a half cups of the red wine, (didn't want it to be too "winey" for a first attempt) and that worked out perfectly!  Also, I only had to bake it uncovered for about 15 minutes.  I also used the meat from two T-bone steaks I had in the freezer instead of the stew meat and it was still delicious and tender. Thank you Teri for a great recipe!

This recipe was good but not great. It did heat up well the next day. I have only two suggestions. 1) I did not care for the canned pearl onions. I plan on omitting them next time. 2) I did use halp beef stock and wine as other reviewers suggested. 3) I added a couple dashes of worchestershire sauce for an extra zang, as I thought the finished product needed something else.

Made yesterday for lunch. 

What I changed: 
I subbed whole wheat flour instead of white and added 1/2 teaspoon of powdered onion into the flour mix for extra flavour to the meat.
Used cut 1 slice of thick sliced maple smoked bacon and 2 Tbl. of butter instead of 4 Tbl. of butter.
Didn't have any can of onion, so I cut 3 medium size onions into cubes which turned out just fine. 
Used 2.5 quart casserole dish. 
Added 1 more carrot and bay leaf.
Added 8 baby potatoes with skin on.
Used 1 cup of chicken stock and 1 cup of wine instead of 2 c of wine.
Ended up cooking for less than 2 hours.

What I would do differently next time:

Use fresh mushrooms even without cutting,
so I wouldn't also add the liquid from a can of mushroom.
Cut beef into bite size before mixing in with flour mixture since smaller pieces tends to be more flavourful and juicy.

This was incredible!  And it was pretty easy to make.  I will cut back on the amount of canned onions next time though.  My husband loved it, too, and it presents itself as a classy dish.

My goodness this was great.  I was scared to use all of the wine recommended, so I used half beef broth.  I will follow the recipe as written next time and add the total amount of wine.  Both my boys are telling me that I am becoming a great chef.  So thank you all for the reviews.

This is a real good recipe for company. It's rich with flavor and great over rice. Don't use some old bottle of bad wine, though. I also used fresh mushrooms and large carrot chunks.  NOTE: This recipe does have a wine taste to it, so kids might not take to it so well.

This was very good.  I halved the recipe and it was more than enough for 2 people.  I changed a few things based on other reviewers’ suggestions.  I used 1c wine (a very good cabernet) plus 1c beef broth, boiled 6 pearl onions for a couple minutes, pealed them, then added with the ½ can mushrooms for the last 30 minutes of cooking.  I used more salt and pepper than was called for, but it still wasn’t quite enough.  I guess that’s why we keep a salt and pepper shaker on our table.  No problem.  Next time I will add a little more garlic, maybe half a can of cream of mushroom soup, and maybe a little extra thyme or some other herbs.  It smells delicious during the (very) long 2+ hours while it’s cooking!  I served it over steamed rice, with a garden salad with balsamic vinaigrette dressing on the side.  Excellent!

TEN STARS!!!!  Wow!  My whole family enjoyed this! I  used 1 cup wine and 1 cup chicken broth instead of all wine...then i added 1/2 can mushroom soup with roasted garlic and 1/2 can of evaporated milk in the final 30 minutes!  It was wonderfully creamy and just right!!!!  I served it over wheat noodles...a healthy choice!  Yum!!!!!  My husband insisted I SAVE the leftovers!  Thanks for a great recipe!  Now I'm cooking the cheesecake brownies (recipe on this site) for dessert!  mmmmmmmm!

This was excellent.  I used fresh onions and mushrooms, not canned, and it worked very well. I made it Christmas Day and everyone loved it.  I wouldn't change anything else the flavor was fantastic. Thank you for the recipe, I plan to make it often.

We LOVE this recipe! Although many reviewers thought up yummy alterations to this recipe, it was still wonderful by following it exactly the first time. The second time though, I added an additional can of mushrooms, but that's what we like.

I LOVE this recipe served over egg noodles!  My husband, who is not a big fan of red meat, only gets happy when I make it because the next day I make meat pie with the leftovers.  It's his favorite dish then!  
I add cooked cubed potatoes, cooked celery and mushrooms and cream or heavy milk and bake it in a double crust. Even I have to admit, it tastes fabulous in a pie crust, although it seems almost sacrilegious!
BTW, the pearl onions are GREAT if you buy a quality brand.

Thanks to reviewers "atomiclush" with the wine/broth advice and "Janine Perkins" with the spice/onion soup advice - this turned out fabulous!! Never had (and never will have) canned onions, so they were omitted but we didn't notice them - this dish stood tall without them. My boyfriend raved about this allllllll night! A+ in my book Teri - Thanks!

There was only 2 things that was good about this recipe was the meat was tender and when cooking it made the whole house smell good.  I don't understand what I did wrong but I was sad it did not turn out the way it smelled.

Wasn't to impressed with this recipie.  Didn't use wine. Used the beef broth as another review suggested.  It cooked up good and was just right on thickness when done, but didn't like the thyme in it.  Perhaps to much of it.  My boyfriend wanted to know what the weed in it was. Was much like plain beef stew. I added potatoes also.  SHYPURPLE

Excellent enough to serve to guests and very economical. I added extra garlic, cut the butter to 1 tbl and added 3 tbl olive oil, I used fresh mushrooms which I also sauteed.  I used 1 cup of wine and 1 1/2 cup of beef broth, turned down the heat to 300 degrees for the last hour, I kept the cover on throughout.Served with a sides of lemon broccoli and whipped potatoes, a green salad and crusty bread. The gravy was delicious. Thank you Terri Smith.

Have always wanted to make this but was intimidated... Read this recipe and it seemed simple enough. Followed the recipe almost exactly.. The only changes I made was using fresh mushrooms, which I sauteed with the onions and carrots, and I did not add canned onions at the end. It was SO good! The only cut of beef I had that was big enough to use was a tri tip roast but it turned out so tasty and tender! I served it over egg noodles, with sauteed cauliflower as a side. Will definitely be making this again...

This is my go you to recipe. The only change I made was to add more carrots because the flavors are melded together at the end. So scrumptious and hearty.

This could be a five star.  I think.  The flavor was there but the beef cubes were way over cooked.  Tender......well yes ....but very dry!  It smelled amazing cooking.  The flavor was there but it wasn't a "WOW" flavor for me.  My family liked it even after agreeing it was a little over cooked.  I tried the recipe because I had half a bottle of wine leftover from making Chef John's Coq au vin (which I make all the time) and didn't want it to go to waste.  I'm not sure if I will try this again but I'm giving it a 4 based on what it could be and that my family enjoyed it.

REALLY good! I used 1 C of wine and 1 Can of broth as suggested. NO jarred onions. Added some fresh Rosemary and Parsley from my herb garden. Cooked at 225 covered in the oven for 3 hours. Then added fresh mushrooms and an additional 1/2 C of wine. Cooked uncovered for additional 30 minutes. Used top round as it was the least expensive cut of meat available.......sigh. Made with homemade French onion soup and French bread. I will make this again!

No, this is definitely not your average casserole. I made half of this recipe as there are just the two of us and used sirloin strip steaks as I wanted a better cut of meat to go with that expensive wine. As written it's a 4 but with the addition of an extra 1 1/2 cups of liquids it a solid 5. I cooked this at the recommended 350 for the first 1 1/2 hours then decreased the temp to 300 as it seemed to be drying out. I kept as close to the recipe as possible with the exception of using Earth Balance instead of butter, dietary restraints, and fresh cremini mushrooms instead of caned. I also added extra carrots as they needed to be used. When I took the cover off the dutch oven for the final 30 minutes it looked really dry so I added 1 cup of beef broth and an additional 1/2 cup of wine. This dish comes together really quickly but taste like you spent the day making it. Definitely company worthy and it will be going into my favourites file. I served this with a loaf of crusty 
rye bread to soak up the last dredges. Thanks Teri for the super recipe.

This is an excellent recipe! I will say that I altered it a bit due to ingredient availability and because I read over some other boeuf bourguinion recipes. In addition to the wine that was called for, I read several recipes that recommended that the liquid be 1/3 above the beef. Based on that, the wine wasn't enough alone, so I added a cup (or so) of water and another half cup of Pinot Noir. I also made do without pearl onions and fresh parsley, as I didn't have any. I added an extra bay leaf and reduced the thyme by a pinch. Due to the additional liquid, my cook time was extended by an extra half hour covered and an extra hour uncovered. The wine reduced beautifully and the meat is falling-apart-tender. The dish is delicious; hearty, aromatic, and classical! Next time, I won't concern myself with extra water, although I may use the extra half cup of wine. If I had the ingredients for a fresh herb bouquet, I would include that also. I'm very pleased with this recipe and highly recommend it.

I made this dish for dinner last evening, followed the recipe as directed, and it was delicious.  The meat was tender and tasty, and the house smelled delicious as well!  I will definitely use this recipe in the future.

Delicious, Easy to make and the house smelled wonderful all day. This recipe does not include beef broth which is unusual, but the wine cooks down into a fantastic sauce that needs to broth to be delicious.

I made this tonight with chicken. It was great! The chicken was tender and moist. I am living in Korea right now and so not everything is available here.  Beef is $20 per pound.  Chicken breasts worked great.  I have no oven, not Korean lifestyle, so I cooked it at medium in the microwave for 1 hour.

Very good and easy.  I used CK Mondavi Cabernet Sauvignon as recommended by another reviewer.  Perfect!  Followed the recipe, but tripled it for a party (baking it in two different casserole dishes for the time and temperature suggested.)  I didn't know what was meant by canned onions, so I just added additional chopped onions.  Will make again and is great for feeding a crowd.

Easy to make, tastes great. Lends itself to substitution. In my case, I have a lot of canned vension from last year. I´ve been looking for recipes to use it in. Was able to substitute this for the beef. Cooked all the rest of the ítems in butter and added the flour to it and poured the mixture over the canned meat. Baked it for an hour to allow the flavors to mix. Voila, Venison Bourguinon.

Outstanding! Everyone in every age group loved it.  Rich flavor, great texture.  I used rib meat and 1/2 beef broth 1/2 chianti.  I tripled the recipe and made 2 13x9 pans of it to feed a crowd of 12. Very easy to double or triple this recipe.

I loved it but found it a bit a bit too dry. Next time I make it, I'm going to add one or two more cups of wine and maybe some beef broth. I also loved the mushroom and onions so maybe I'll add more of those. Still, very delicious.

Last night I made this recipe for my family.  They all loved it!  I am always leary of using canned anything, for fear of that dreadful "tinny taste", so I used a fresh onion and a large package of fresh mushrooms (we love mushrooms).  I did as the other reviewers suggested and used 1C of beef stock to give it a more beefy flavor (I actually think it could have still used a little more of something to enhance the beef taste, but I don't know what to use - suggestions??).  My only recommendation would be to add salt. Otherwise, delish!!  I'll be making it again - probably even this week!  ;)

I didn't' use canned anything, used fresh.  Maybe that accounted for the dryness, but I read others had the same problem.  My son compared the result to eating beef jerky.  Got burned, tough, and resulted in a  sad cook who spent a long time on this.

???Made this and love it???. My biggest fear was the kids not liking it. I love different types of foods but its hard to please children. However they LOVED IT. . . Only thing I would do next time Is make extra sauce using the same ingredients. We're a saucy bunch!.. thanks again!

Used fresh mushrooms and onion rather than canned, I have a ton of liquid!  Will thicken and make into "gravy" or save for stock.  Can't believe some had to add liquid!?  Delicious.  First time ever having or making this dish.  Am thinking I will try using venison too.

This was easy and delicious.  I found a pot roast on sale that I cubed and used in place of the stew meat... it was very tender and flavorful.  I plan on making it again next week.  I think this would be a good way to cook chicken, using white wine instead of the red

Very very tasty, I loved it. I think it needs a bit more mushrooms, and I think I will try fresh ones next time. Will definitely make this again.

I thought this tasted pretty good. Although, it is a little time consuming with 3 hours of baking. Plus, the end product doesn't have the most fresh looking appearance. I think this dish is really best for its taste. I followed the recipe exactly except I only had about 1.25 lbs of stew meat. I was lucky enough to find 90% lean cut. I thought the pieces were kind of big and cut them in half. I wish I wouldn't have because of the long time cooking they do break down some on their own. I couldn't find canned onions so I got the same size in a jar. They were packed in water, but I still could taste a slight vinegar taste to them for some reason. I think frozen defrosted pearl onions would probably have been best choice. The mushrooms come in 4oz cans and not 6oz so I used the juice from one but the mushrooms from 2. Everything else I kept the same. This recipe truly only make about 4 servings. I was short on the meat, but with the full amount it still would have been about 4 regular servings.

Easy to make, and taste great. I only cokked it for 2 hours. I added fresh mushroom to the (added with onions and garlic) and omitted the canned onions. It was so good my family asked for it to be on the "every day menue".

I made this recipe as written. I agree with all the other comments that the house smells INCREDIBLE! Now my dish for all of the smell, had very little flavor. Truth be told, I didn't have the right size pan. I can't find a good pan here in Bolivia. That being said, mine boiled over and I lost a lot of my liquid. Also, I don't actually drink wine, so I don't know if I had a quality wine for the dish. They are mostly Bolivian wines here and I have NO idea what one would yield me the best tasting meal. I will definitely try this one again . . . but I'll be looking for more flavor next time!

We had some mixed reviews.  I followed this recipe to exactly and I used a Merlot as my wine of choice.  I thought it was okay, my mom liked it but felt like it was missing something, and my step-dad said it was unbelievably delicious and had seconds.  I've wanted to make Boeuf Bourguignon since seeing Julie & Julia, and I'm glad I did.  I can cros it off the bucket list, but I probably won't be making it again.  For those who said this took a long time to make, I disagree.  It cooks for a long time, but it doesn't actually take a long time to put together.  The prep work is fairly easy, and it all cooks on its own in the oven.

Very tasty, and fancy. I used illinois cellars sweet red wine. Did not use canned onions but added a little more regular yellow onion. Next time I will make with fresh parsley

OMG this was good- and after reading the reviews I was unsure as to the tweaking that would be required. I used slightly less beef  because that is what I bought (1.6 lb) browned it well (but I did add some oil to the butter to raise the temp). I salt and peppered every step of the way. I didnt put the fresh parsley in until the end and I used frozen pearl onions. I did not  find it dry or needing extra liquid at all (like i read in the reviews) but I did watch it and turned it down to 325 when I thought the 350 was boiling it in the oven rather than doing the gentle simmering thing. The sauce (Just red wine- no beef broth) was wonderful. added 2 extra bay leaves, thats all. This was just a really nice easy recipe. If you are a newer cook I think you will be happy to just follow the recipe. If you have been cooking for a while you will, naturally, do your own thing with GREAT results. THX for the recipe!

I found this recipe to be under-seasoned, but maybe because I made it in the slow-cooker instead of oven, or maybe because I omitted the canned onions at the end.  Anyway, I added 2 more bay leaves, and some beef "Better Than Bullion" and cooked it again for another hour, and it was better.

This dish was amazing! My hubby hates wine but loved this dish! The reason I gave it a 4 star instead of a 5 star rating was because I had to add quite a bit more red wine and beef broth half way through cooking, if i wasn't paying attention as well as i was then it would of been ruined so keep a good eye on it while it's cooking.

I made this for a large crowd at Christmas.  I prepared as directed and let it sit in a crock pot for a buffet style.  Served in large mugs w/ a pile of mashed potatoes underneath was outstanding!  This is a simple recipe to follow and extremely tasty.  All my guests were very impressed;)

This showed up in my inbox a while back and I decided to make it for Christmas dinner.  I've never had it before but it was fantastic- everyone loved it. The meat was so tender, the flavor amazing.  I'll definitely make this again. I used dry spices except for the garlic because fresh are expensive when you don't use the whole thing.

This was a really great recipe and the beef just fell apart, very tender!  I did have to add about 1 cup of beef broth about 2 or so hours into it.  Everyone loved it!  I think next time I will add some additional veggies to round it out a little more, but this is a keeper!

Delicious and easy to make ahead. Great for company. My husband said it was one of the tastiest meals I've ever cooked. That says a lot because I cook a LOT and always try new things. I had no trouble with dryness...in fact it dripped over my 2 qt. dish. Next I'll try Julia Child's original classic and compare results. :)

The sauce and flavor of this dish was great!  The whole kitchen smelled wonderful and the recipe was easy to put together. My one complaint about this recipe is related to the cut of meat it calls for. I found the stew meat to be a little chewy and tough and I don't think it absorbed the flavor as well as it should have. Next time, I may use a different cut, maybe a chuck roast.

I made this recipe last night to mixed reviews from my family. My daughter said it was very tastily, and my husband said it was different, I though it tasted very good. The only problem I found was, it was little on the dry side, if you bake it for 2 ½ hrs.

You can cook this, pot roast or brisket ahead of time.  In fact it tastes even better the second or third day.  And it's easier to skim the hardened fat off the top then.  Just be sure to use or freeze the meat by the third day for safety sake. I'm giving it 3 stars because, like other reviewers, I'd rather add fresh rather than canned ingredients when I make it.

It was very tender. I'm surprised the kids ate it up, I was worried with the red wine taste.

The flavor in this meal was marvelous. The meat and vegetables were tender and perfectly cooked. I used sherry cooking wine for the wine and served the meal over egg noodles (as seen in the photo). I loved how the dish had loads of flavor but was not heavy. Perfect; I wouldn't change a thing!

This is my 2nd, updated review.  The mistake I made the first time was I stirred all ingredients before putting in the oven.  Do not do this! Just prepare exactly as directed and it will not dry up. When I added the onions and mushrooms, I added about 1/4 cup of extra wine, and it was great!

My changes were in the amounts: 3/4 tsp. salt, 1 cup water + 1/2 beef bouillon cube, 1 cup of baby carrots, and 1/2 TBL of dried parsley. I browned the beef after step 1 and put it on top of the onions and carrots in the slow cooker. Stirred everything else together and poured it in. I had it in the slow cooker  on high for 6 hours. Wine taste was subtle, but good. Next time I made it in the oven and I was very disappointed. Other then less meat , all other ingredients were the same amount. But after 2 hours, the meal was burnt. I had to pick out the meat that wasn't black (about half) and then scrub the dish and put on the fan so the house wasn't too bad. Good thing I didn't have company.

Wow this was a great way to serve a cheap cut of meat.    I followed the recipe for the most part.    I added about 1/3 cup of sour cream the last 20  minutes to thicken the liquid and make a creamy sauce.   It was delicious over noodles.    Loved it!

Made this in the slow cooker and it was delicious! Used pearl onions, fresh mushrooms, and a bottle of pinot noir. Served with side of mashed potatoes and asparagus. It was very easy to make and resulted in a great rich flavor. This was something my husband has always wanted to make and was very pleased with it. It was a melt in your mouth experience. This dish was such a treat, we will definitely be making this again!

I made this last Sunday, it was a gloomy day , perfect for having the house smell so good while it cooked. The beef was tender and was even good as leftovers. I used 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth, served over noodles, perfect!. I plan to make it again today, definitely a keeper. Thanks !

Absolutely wonderful!  I used 2 Tbsp. butter and 2 Tbsp. olive oil.  I deglazed the pan with a little wine before adding the veggies.  This way the veggies had a little liquid to cook in.  I doubled the mushrooms and did add the can (in my case, jar) of onions.  We didn't care for the jar of onions, so will probably leave those out next time.  And there will be a next time!  ***UPDATE 10/24/2010:  I made this again, and it was just as wonderful as the first time!  This time I left out the canned onions and used fresh mushrooms.  Serve with crusty bread, a salad and a glass of red wine.  Eat your heart out Julia Child!

Excellent dish that everyone liked. Some changes I made were to use fresh pearl onions. They are easy to prepare - drop them as they come at the store into boiling water, boil for 3 minutes and then put in cold water for a few minutes. Cut off the root end and squeeze the onion out. I also used fresh brown mushrooms instead of canned. I sateed the pearl onions and the sliced mushrooms with the rest of the vegetables and added them to the casserole for the entire cooking time. Cooked for 2 1/2 hours total and it was perfect. Thanks!

Excellent recipe.  I only added an additional carrot.  The rest of the recipe was followed exactly.  The whole family loved the meal.  I even took two plates to grandma's house.  Next time I will also add egg shell noodles to the plate.  I will definitely make this again.

I absolutely loved this meal! I used about 1 1/2 pounds of stew meat, and used half burgundy wine, half beef broth. Ended up adding an additional cup of beef broth for the last half hour of cooking, with the mushrooms and onion. I used sliced fresh onion at the end since I couldn't find canned onions. Also only used about 2 tbsp. of butter to brown the meat. This was awesome over rotini pasta (the sauce soaked into the grooves of the pasta which was DELICIOUS) and with steamed asparagus on the side. I will be happily making this again for dinner. I loved it and so did my husband!

This is a great recipe.  Kinda high maintenance, and the flavor largely depends on the quality of wine you use.  The better the wine- closer to a 5 star.  Cheaper wine- a strong 4 star.

This is a delicious, easy recipe. I didn't change much, I omitted the canned onions because it didn't appeal to me, and used a frozen baby peas and carrots mix instead of adding carrots. I used buffalo steak cut into cubes and it came out perfectly tender. I served this with the crescent rolls from this site: blue ribbon overnight rolls. This is the ultimate comfort food, yet fancy enough to serve at a nice dinner. I'm making it again for the family Christmas dinner.

Truly delicious! I used fresh local mushrooms and onions rather than those slimy canned things and doubled the number of both. This begs to be served with a nice crusty bread to sop up the wonderful broth.

I did not care for this recipe. The cooking time was too long and not worth the wait.  Also, I think fresh mushrooms would have given this recipes a better flavor.

I made this yesterday for my hubby for Bastille day since he's from France, he said it tasted the way it's supposed to. I made the following changes: Used slightly more wine than called for (Pinot Noir), Used 1/2 can of tomato paste, used about a can of beef broth. Omitted the frozen onion and canned mushroom. Instead, I sauteed mushrooms and added them at the end. I also did not cook this uncovered in the oven. It tasted amazing and the wine flavor was very mild, which is a good thing. I will make this again, maybe next time in the slow cooker.

I made this dish for the first time when my husband family from London was in town.  It is a great meal to make for a group of guests or dinner party as it smells up the house with a delicious aroma and also serves plenty.  Saves well for left overs.  If you have extra try heating up the next day for lunch and adding a little beef stock and cream to make a nice soup with some french breads.  I just dished it out in to a deep dish plate with no rice and then served a spinach salad with a raspberry dressing.  Excellent with wine and chocolate truffles for dessert.  Thank you!

Fabulous.  I served it with buttered egg noodles and I poured some more wine over at the end.  I agree that you should use a good wine.

Really good but next time I think I'll put 1 cup of red wine & 1 cup of port. I don't think the recipe was clear on the "can of onions" so I just used french fried onions from the can.  It turned out looking terrible, I wouldn't serve it to guests, but the flavor was great.  Served it over rice with a nice salad and french bread and it was well received by my picky husband.

I cooked it in my crock pot.  I was not overly impressed with this dish.  I may keep it in the line up as a crockpot dish.  Because it is one that I can prepare ahead, freeze and use when my schedule get hectic.

This recipe is tasty.  However, I wasn't over the moon for it.  It could just be personal taste and the amount of time the recipe takes.

This was horrible.  Even my husband, who is very tolerant, did not like it.  I threw it down the disposal.  Maybe it was the red wine.  I am not a fan of wine, but I usually like it in stews.  I would not recommend this recipe.

eh.... I wasn't too impressed.  I feel like I wasted a good part of a really good bottle of Merlot on this.  My husband said it was good, but he said he wouldn't want me to make it again.
I followed the recipe almost exactly, the only exception being that I used fresh mushrooms.  This won't be on my menu again any time soon...

This dish was OK, I used cooking wine, which may have been a mistake since it did have salt added, and the end result was a VERY salty meal.  My husband liked it, so if I make it again I would find another wine to use.

This got RAVES at dinner last night!  It smelled sooo good while in the oven and they couldn't wait to taste -- and they were not disappointed!!  I used one cup wine and one cup beef broth and didn't add the canned onions.  Thanks for a great recipe!!!

My dad makes a fabulous beef burgundy, and I could not for the life of me find his recipe, so I punched in the ingredients on this site.  Low and behold, this appeared.  It is almost identical to my dad's and has always been a great comfort meal for me.  The only things I did differently are, used 1 cup of beef broth and 1 cup of wine, and did not add extra onion for the last half hour.  I grew up with this served over rice, so that is what I did.  Fabulous!

Great flavor. I didn't read the other reviews before making this dish and found out that I needed to add some beef broth. I used red wine vinegar but it still was wonderful. I also preferred to use fresh mushrooms and I added frozen baby onions at the end. I also noticed that the cook time could have been shorter for me - but it came out very tender. Loved it and will make again. YUM! Thanks for sharing!

This is an awesome recipe and I have made it several times now with great success!  I followed some of the other suggestions, though, by using a little less wine (1 1/2 cups), omitting the onions, and adding a can of beef broth.  I also added a can of creamy mushroom soup at the end and baked it for 30 more minutes.  The aroma it makes while cooking is wonderful and I have used different cuts of meat and they have all turned out tender and tasty. We absolutely love this dish and I will make it again and again!  Thank you for the recipe!

Just cooked this recipe and I found it to be very good.  I followed some of the suggestions on this site and added less wine (1 1/2 cups), and a couple of tablespoons of Heinz Cream of Mushroom soup.  I also used lean steak cubes as opposed to stewing steak which made the meat melt-in-the-mouth tender.

However, when I cook this recipe again I would add more wine as opposed to less,as I found that the taste of the burgendy was drowned somewhat.  I would also not add the mushroom soup as this made the sauce too rich for my liking.

The only change I would suggest making to the original recipe is that less butter is needed when browning the meat as such a large amount is not needed with a non-stick pan.  

All in all a fab recipe that is best left unchanged IMHO.

This recipe was delicious.  I took advice from other reviews and used a cup of wine and beef broth.  However, tasting it as it cooked, I probably would have added about another 3/4 cup of wine.  Perhaps it depends on what wine you use - I used Merlot.  Using almost 2 cups of wine and one cup of beef broth - it made plenty of thick gravy!
Will definately make this one again.  Left overs are perfect for lunch.

Sometimes red wine seems to over power beef stew recipes and I took another reviewer's advice and added
one cup wine and one cup beef broth. I also  had to reduce the total cooking time to 2 hours. Any longer and it would have been
shreadded beef. I guess it depends on the beef but I used pre-packaged stew beef. GREAT recipe and I will definitely use it again!

Wonderful!  My daughter doesn't like onions and muchrooms much so I used pearl onions and cooked the entire time (easier for her to pick out) and then added whole mushrooms (also easier to pick out) for the last half hour.  They both added great flavor to the dish still.  This recipe is easy to "play" around with different variations.  GREAT recipe, and very tasty!!

This was good, but the next time I make it, I will try it with beef broth instead of wine as my toddler was not crazy about the taste.  The meat comes out very tender and I like the flavor.

Instead of using stewing meat, I used chuck steak and the meat was fork tender.  My husband absolutely loved this.  Make sure you have a lot of bread on hand for the sauce.  This receipe has now become a family favorite.

The red wine and herbs give this recipe a wonderful flavor, unlike ordinary stew.  My husband simply loved it and asked that I make when his mother comes to visit.

My husband really enjoyed this dish.
Though it does require a long cook
time, the preparation is very easy.
It makes the house smell wonderful
as it cooks!  I served it with Roasted
Potato Medley and Broccoli With Lemon
Almond Butter.  It was a great meal for
a cold fall evening.

Even cooked covered (unlike the recipe states), I found it overcooked despite cutting the cook time short.  Would definitely watch closely in your oven and not overcook.

This dish is very easy to make.  The extra cooking time makes the beef tender; it flakes apart.  I used beef broth rather than wine.  I served over mashed potatoes and everyone loved it!

I was really looking forward to this! When I try new recipes, I like to make them as written & if necessary, make my tweaks the next time. The whole house smelled fantastic for the first 2 1/2 hours. I have never used canned onions before & couldn't find them, so I asked at the store & was directed to the Cocktail Onions in the pickle/olive section (obviously an error on my part). The directions didn't say to drain the onions & a lot of the liquid had cooked away, so I poured in the whole jar with liquid. Completely ruined it! The delicious smell went away & the final taste was off (pickled, maybe). Very disappointing, but I know it was the Cocktail Onions. I will definitely be trying this again....without those! Honestly, with the whole onion added in the beginning, any onions added in the last 30 minutes are unnecessary (especially 16 ozs...it was nothing but onions)! I used 2 cups of Apothic Red wine (which I like, but may use a Pinot Noir next time).  It's a Bourguignon, so I agree with others that say use the wine, not the beef broth. Will probably use seasoned salt in place of the salt (personal preference) & fresh mushrooms instead of canned. This recipe is definitely worth trying....but if you can't find canned onions....stay away from the Cocktail Onions!

I keep thinking it should have potatoes in it, but I know traditionally it does not.  Noticed some recipes serve this on a bed of noodles, may try this next time.  The flavor was excellent.  I would use this recipe again.

WTF  is up with these directions???  I made this like it was written AND also added extra beef broth since a lot of people said it was dry, and at the end of the 2. 5 hours  the meat was almost welded to my beloved Dutch Oven.  I panicked and put in some water, a little more wine and the mushrooms and the pearl onions per the recipe, then put it back in the oven for 30 minutes.  That seemed to rescue it, but !  I should not have to rescue a dish I followed exactly.  IF I made this again, I would cook it on the stove for the initial 2.5 hours and keep checking it for too much reduction.    But I probably will look for other recipes.  I love my Dutch Oven too much to subject it to this one again!

I followed the recipe carefully. It turned out to be most disappointing.  The flavour was great but was much too dry.  Where was the sauce that one could use for dipping French bread in?  There was no sauce, but I used all the liquid the recipe indicated.  If I make it again I will add stock or more wine to the recipe.

I have made this a few times now and each time it is delicious. If you follow this recipe strict to the letter, it will be tasty but maybe my modifications will be worth a try. The few modifications I now make after having made this specific recipe for many years are - I up the garlic to a few cloves, I primarily use red wine but I add a little beef broth as it cooks and the liquid starts to cook down. I started cutting the pearl onions in half and adding them much earlier so they can get more infused with the meat/wine juices. Prior to that I found them to be more of a distraction in the dish. I used to omit the mushrooms bc I'm not a fan but now include them, just without liquid. We eat this over egg noodles (my preference), salad greens or quinoa. Enjoy!

Great recipe. Turned out delicious - I didn’t change a thing! I served with mashed potatoes - and while it was a good side, pasta may be better or some crunchy bread for texture.

Absolutely DELICIOUS, made exactly as directed with no changes. Nice enough for ‘company’ (with the 4 cups of wine) or equally good for a weeknight family dinner made with consommé or broth. I cannot recommend this recipe highly enough! Served with green peas and bread, it is a satisfying, homey, simple winter dinner. Love it 100%.

Turned out so good. I did modify a bit because I’m GF so I used corn starch instead of flour. I also used fresh mushrooms instead of canned because I happened to have them on hand. Lastly I added a cup of beef broth to make extra “gravy” since I was putting it on top of mashed potatoes and my SO is obsessed with gravy. I will be making this again. Thank you!

I would give it a 5 for ease of recipe and taste of meat and vegetables, but I’d give the “sauce/gravy” a 3 based off my taste buds only because I wasn’t a fan at all of its flavor. I’m not a wine drinker and don’t usually use it with any cooking with such a large amount. I followed recipe. It was the first time I made it and every ate it. Meat was very tender. Vegetables soft but not mush. The sauce was just odd to me, but mostly and or probably because I’m not a fan of red wine. I recommend this to anyone who likes red wine and likes this particular meal. Otherwise I won’t make again simply based off of not a a fan of the sauce/gravy.

I followed the recipe exactly. I found the flavor very bland. Then again, I am not a wine drinker so I left picking out the wine to the salesman. Dinner guests enjoyed it, but as I said I found it dull. Would not make it again

I have made this dish so many times and it is perfect. I cannot find canned onions so I just defrost pearl onions and it still turns out delicious. This is by far one of my favorite dishes and the kids will stay up to have some.  Everyone who comes in the house knows what I am making by the wonderful aroma.

This is a good and really simple recipe. I read the reviews and would make a few changes the next time I make this recipe. Instead of using the canned mushrooms, I would prefer to use fresh. I would brown the fresh mushrooms along with the onions and carrots. Season this with salt and pepper to taste. I found that it was very bland without adding additional salt and pepper.  Add the wine to the pan, which will help with deglazing it to get all the good flavours, then transfer it into a casserole dish to bake.  Instead of the canned onions at the end, add fresh onions.  I also read some reviews where people used 1/2 beef broth and 1/2 wine, I'm going to try this next time to see how it changes the flavor profile.  But all in all, it was good, really simple to make, just allow for the time to cook.

I doubled the recipe for 6 people. Good thing I did! It was well received. I used 4 onions and 6 carrots for the double recipe. I eliminated the canned onions and the canned mushrooms and added a large container of baby bella fresh mushrooms 30 minutes before serving. I also cooked the beef stew on top of the stove, simmered slowly for about 4 hours. I used 4 cups of Pinot Noir. No beef broth. It was amazing!

I made this for  a dinner party of ten with rave reviews.  They couldn't get enough of it!  Very easy and the only changes I made were that I omitted the canned onions (Couldn't find) and used fresh mushrooms.

I liked this recipe. It requires a bit of work but it is worth the try. I added the bacon and used bouquet garni (fresh thyme,rosemary,and sage sprigs tied with cooking thread). I would recommend using the garni as it is aromatic and gives that little warming flavor to the dish. As I said, I think this is a good start up recipe it short cuts a bit but the result is as good as trying the longer version.

My family enjoyed this dish, but I found it just so-so.  I modified it and cooked it all in the crock pot.  Nice for a winter's day.

We loved this. I accidentally skipped the step to dust the meat with flour, salt, and pepper, so I added some cornstarch in while the meat was cooking half way through. It still turned out great!

Very Good.   I used fresh mushrooms that I sauteed a bit and added at the end so I replaced canned mushroom liquid in the recipe with beef broth.  I also used jarred pearl onions added in the end.  Wonderful flavor.

This turned out to be a really good and very easy recipe to make.  Hubby really liked it.  Definitely use a red wine that you would like to also drink with it.  Otherwise, I followed the recipe and found it to be really, really good.

This is delicious!  I made some minor changes based on what I had on hand at the time.  Instead of canned mushrooms, I sautéed fresh sliced mushrooms along with the onions, garlic and carrots. Instead of diced carrots, I used baby carrots. I omitted the baby onions because I didn't have any at the time.  It's a keeper!

I liked it but, my family thought the wine was a little strong.... Although the 2 cups of wine is a bit much... Maybe 1 cup of wine and 1 cup beef stock (My opinion)... The meat was VERY tasty (That is what they liked the most)..

Really delish. I cooked it in my Pampered Chef Stoneware casserole for 2 1/2 hours and it was tender and flavorful.  Did not have parsley, and used fresh mushrooms and frozen pearl onions because that is what I had...Used just a touch of olive oil instead of butter to make it a bit more healthy. Served over a baked potato. Filling and hearty on a cold winter's night.

I used 2 onions, a bag of baby carrots, sautéed fresh sliced mushrooms and dried parsley.  Cooked at 300 for around 3 hours. Will definitely make again.

Very Good! Definetly recommend. It is worth the 3 hour wait. I used a merlot wine that wasn't bad on price. I didn't use carrots because the other half isn't a fan but would of be wonderful either way! In my top 5 for sure!

I am rating this a one star, not for flavor because I actually never got to eat it...I followed the directions and after the initial 2 1/2 hours were over, I took it out of the oven and all I had was dried out beef and burnt carrots and onions.  What did I do wrong?  I am a seasoned cook and know how to follow a recipe so I have no idea.  And I used a good bottle of red wine too :(

Fantastic! Minor modifications: replaced butter with olive oil and carrots with celery. Since I only had 1.3 lbs beef, 1 cup wine was enough. I skipped canned onions thus I baked it covered at 350 F for a little under 2 hours and served over mashed potatoes. It turned out perfect! Ideas for next time? Add another can of mushrooms, add cubed potatoes... Maybe red bell peppers...

Very good. My kids do not eat mushrooms so I did not use those, and I used more carrots, onions and potatoes.
Needs more fluid than the wine, and I added 1 cup beef broth. I also had to turn down to 300 for the last hour.
It was gone in an instant - the family loved it!

I upped the  carrots to 1 lb 
 and used 8 Juniper berrys rather than a boquet garin which was not mentioned
Also 3/4 cup of coniac..flamed off  was missing and critical
Marinate the meat for 18 hours before cooking thats missing and critical

This was delicious. It's one I will keep in my recipe box and make again.  I cut up a chuck roast instead of using stew meat and added four carrots and sliced them instead of chopping them.  The meat was tender and the sauce was rich with flavor.

I didn't have canned mushrooms/onions or the herbs at hand so I used shiitake mushrooms and added some potatoes. I also added 1T of Worcestershire sauce to the beef, halved the red wine, and used chicken stock (would have used beef but I forgot to buy it!).  The flavors blended extremely nicely and the starch from the potatoes made the resulting sauce thicker (I love the slight graininess).

This recipe was pretty good.  I followed it very closely, just added some celery and used fresh vegetables.  My gravy was evaporating quickly so I turned the oven down and added probably about a cup and a half of beef broth to keep it moist.  Cooked for a little under three hours and served with steamed green beans and egg noodles.  It was good, but it felt like there was something missing.  It was a little bland.  A good meal though, thanks!

This was a very nice meal. I used Cabernet Sovignon for the red wine and didn't have a bay leaf or the parsley, so I used italian herbs instead. Be sure to use the pearl onions and the mushrooms, they add texture and color as well as flavor. This recipe will be added to my family favorites. I prepared and baked it in a dutch oven.

Oh wow this was fantastic! I followed the recipe really close - I used fresh mushrooms & omitted the canned onions; I added 1/4c beef broth to make up for not having the liquid from the canned onions.  The meat was so tender and everything was just so delicious - everyone loved it - and the best part is that it was so easy!

Easy to make. Does well with additional ingredients... and alterations in fresh versus canned. It is a great use for wine I tried but did not love too! A big hit with my family.

Fantastic.   Easy to do and has a very red, full flavor. I made this as post-ski-coma comfort food, and it was very, very, very satisfying. Highly recommend!

This was fantastic.  The meat came out sooo tender it was ridiculous.  I followed some recommendations to substitute beef broth for a cup of wine but I think that is a mistake.  I think it would be better as is stated in the recipe.  Either way it was a hit with my family!

I really enjoyed this dish and am glad that I tried it!  I followed some of the changes made by others and I thought it turned out great!  I did use 1 cup wine and 1 cup beef broth when I first put this dish together.  Then when I removed it from the oven to add the mushrooms, I added about another cup of each to make more of the sauce!  It was awesome served over egg noodles!

I was expecting a lot out of this dish.  It took a long time to make and smelled wonderful, but the taste was blah.  I'm a pretty good cook, so I don't think it was a mistake on my part.  I will NOT make this again.

This came out great.  I pulled it out of the oven maybe 15 minutes ago and my boyfriend is ready for a second plate.  I made a few changes though.  I used two cups of Parducci petite syrah and about a cup of beef broth so I could have extra sauce.  I also used fresh cremini mushrooms and pearl onions, and increased the initial bake time to 3 hours like others had recommended.  Served it over mashed potatoes with a side of braised fennel.  I will definitely make this again.

Didn't really care for.  Maybe it was the wine.  I don't really care for red wine (even "good" red wine) so that was probably the problem.  So if you are a red wine lover, go for it.

Fantastic recipe! Absolutely delicious!!! I couldn't find canned onions, so I omitted it completely. I could only find marinated mushrooms in a jar, which weren't nice, so next time I'd omit them too (maybe just use fresh mushrooms). In terms of onion, carrot, bay leaf, thyme, and garlic, I used more than the recipe called for - 2 onions, 4 carrots, 2 bay leaves, 2 garlic cloves and just poured in the thyme from the packet - probably about 3/4 tbls.

UPDATE: I managed to find the canned onions and mushrooms. Don't understand the point of the onions as they seem to overpower everything..? I say leave them out! Still an absolutely brilliant recipe.

This is a really good recipe. I served it on top of frozen egg noodles. I had to add nearly a full 15 oz can of beef broth 1/2 hour before it was done. Virtually all of the wine had evaporated. I didn't want to add more wine since it had little time to distill. I used fresh mushrooms, which are quite worth the slightly added expense. We loved the onions (some reviewers haven't). The long cooking time certainly makes the meat tender, but the taste of the meat--though very good--reminded me of something closer to slightly overcooked pot roast, rather than steak, which is what it tasted like right after browing. This is my first stab at beef Bourguignon and it was very good. I look forward to trying other versions down the road.

Mmmm, I thought this dish was wonderful!  I followed the recipe as written for the most part, BUT, I used dried parsley instead of fresh.  Fresh would make it even better.  I also could not find the canned onions--I found some in a jar, but they ended up tasting pretty yucky in this dish.  Can someone give me an idea of where to find the canned onions?  If not, I'll use all chopped onions next time (although I liked the look of having the whole petite onions in the dish!).  Thanks for a great recipe that we will enjoy again soon!

GREAT, I used half wine half broth, just browned the meat with flour  in a non stick skillet and dumped everything else on top since I was short of time. Simmered for about 2 hours.

This recipe smelled great while cooking and turned out beautiful.  I used the two cups of red wine (a cheap pinot I had on hand) and I didn't think the sauce was overpowering at all, just delicious. I only gave it four stars, though, because my husband wasn't too impressed - he thought it tasted just a lot like normal pot roast.  I used fresh mushrooms and pearl onions.  Served over mashed potatoed and with pulled bread to dip in the sauce. Yum!  Thanks for this recipe - I'm sure I will make it again!

Delicious meal!  If you use fresh mushrooms and onions instead of canned, add them after 2 hours of cooking.  30 mins. is not enough to blend the flavors.

Use a decent cut of meat for this recipe what I would reccomend.  The sauce turns out very flavorful.  I don't know if you need the canned onions or mushrooms.  For better flavor, use fresh.  It doesn't cost all that much more, and the recipe will thank you for it.  I served over mashed taters.  It was very good.

This was good but not great.  However, it does have the potential to be better with a really great wine. Seems to me that a crockpot version would be eaiser, and maybe throw in a few more veggies.  I might try it again...

Wonderful! I too was leery about adding so much wine, but the result was fantastic! I reduced the cooking time by an hour due to time constraints and the meat was still tender as butter.

Great recipe. I don't add the can onion or mushroom...I add fresh mushrooms at the begining. Could use more salt. I served it for 23 people for xmas and everyone LOVED it.

Very good. Much like a meaty beef stew. Make sure to use a "heavy" red wine for more taste.

Wish I would have read the other reviews the wine was really overpowering.  Don't know if I would make again.  I might try it again with the beef broth and 1 C Wine.  I did use fresh mushrooms and fresh onions.

This was very good except for being a tad bit salty. The only changes I made were to use one can of beef broth and 1 and 1/4 cup of wine. I should have known to eliminate the salt in the flour mixture since I was using broth. Duh. I used baby carrots. I also used dried parsley instead of fresh. Hubby didn't like the canned pearl onions. We would make again but this isn't one of our favorite dishes. Served over noodles. Thanks for the post.

I wish I had followed other's suggestions and used 1 cup wine and 1 cup broth as the wine flavor was overpowering.  The meat just soaked it up.  It is important to check before the 2.5 hours are up as well, because you may need to add fluid.  I used fresh mushrooms and skipped the canned onions. Overall this was a really tasty and impressive casserole that I will make again with the modifications.  Thank you!

Really, really good!  I used fresh mushrooms and didn't add more onions at the end.  Compensated for the liquid that would have come from canned mushrooms, and the result was perfect! Tender, moist and delicious!

great recipe which i modified slightly, adding leek (because i had some kicking around) and using fresh brown mushrooms and 250mls beef stock. also used a bouquet garni as the casserole save-all. i can strongly recommend the cokking times and volumes used, produced a great gravy!

Loved this dish. I made for 6, using 2 cups wine & 1 cup beef broth. Needed to add a little more broth during cooking. Used fresh mushrooms and no added onions, since I didn't have any. Using top round, this cooked in 2 1/2 hours total.

The first time I made it was 2 years ago and it is still one of my favourite recipes! ( I use 1 cup wine+ 1 cup broth + lots of garlic sliced carrots, chopped fresh onion+ mushroom and potatoes at the end of baking..super tender meat and vegetables) VERY VERY GOOD!!!!!!

My husband loved this one, I was so-so.  Added a packet of onion soup mix and made the whole thing in the slow cooker.  After I browned the meat I put everything in and cooked it on low for 7-8 hours.  I also reduced the cup to 1 cup and used 1 cup beef broth.

This casserole was very tasty but the wine flavour was a little strong.  Just personal taste, but when I make it again I'll reduce the wine to 1 cup and add 1 cup beef stock.

Very easy recipe with fabulous gourmet results.  I added some whole carrots on top during baking which added to the final presentation.  The family loved it and I can’t wait to serve this for a dinner party.

I couldn't even find canned onions at the grocery store so I didn't bother adding those in, but did use all the wine the recipe called for (some leftover shiraz) and LOVED it! Served it over egg noodles and it was a big hit - the beef was so tender. I thickened the sauce with water/cornstarch and loved the subtle wine notes leftover in it. This was an amazing dish that I'll make again and again especially for company!

The meat cooked nicely and was very tender.  My kids were not fond of the canned onions.  I'm going to skip the extra onions next time.  I used the full addition of a nice Merlot.  I served this with au gratin potatoes (this site by Jennifer Bopp)which was a nice side dish.

We all really liked the flavor of this, but it dried out.  Maybe I cooked it too long, I didn't watch that, and maybe my pot lid didn't seal well enough so the steam escaped.  I used all the red wine plus a can of beef broth, to make sure it didn't cook dry, so I was surprised when it did.  Whatever, we loved the taste and I'd make it again.  Next time I'll put foil over the top under the lid to make a good seal and check it more frequently.

It's okay.  I may try it again, but substitute 1 cup of chicken broth for wine as others have suggested.  It also needs more depth to it...I don't know what though.

I took the advice of previous reviews and used half the red wine.  I did not add the canned onions at the end but doubled the mushrooms. It had mixed reviews with my family. The children did not care for it and my husband thought it was good. Thanks Teri.

This is soooo good.  I made it one other time and it turned out wonderful - I thought it was just beginner's luck, but I made it again today for Sunday dinner and it again it turned out great. I was wondering if anyone had added potatoes to it, at what time during the cooking process would you add them?

Good. But I suggest adding chicken broth and cutting down on the wine. I also didn't add the canned onions at the end, instead I put in 2 red onions with the others.

Nice flavor but the meat came out too dry.

Excellant.  My husband loved it and sid it was even better the next day reheated.  I followed advice and used wine and beef broth with fresh mushrooms and onions.  I will make this again.

I found this recipe to be wonderful and very easy to make. I have tried to figure out a way to make it a crock pot dish. Regardless, the meat is so tender it melts in your mouth. I make this at least once a month, more often twice though.

This was quite good....however, the meat wasn't as tender as I thought it would be and I ended up adding cornstarch+water to thicken the sauce.  But the taste was good and I served it over noodles.  It could've been eaten as a soup or stew too!  Thanks!

In spite of the cooking time, the meat was still tough and the liquid (gravy) lacked taste

Yummy!  Didn't used the canned onions and followed the advice of others using 1c of wine (merlot) and 1c of beef broth.  Added a can of cream of mushroom soup in the last 1/2 hour to thicken up the sauce and about 9 oz of sliced mushrooms.  Also, added some garlic salt when browning the meat.  Will definitely make again.

Followed others suggestions...I made it with 3lbs of chuck steak, added a box of onion soup mix, 2 1/2 cups of burgundy, 14oz of beef broth, and a little water cause I needed more gravy!  I used a can of mushrooms, didn't use the canned onions, or the carrots...it was great!  I served it over rice, but I think it would be great over egg noodles as well!  Fed three hungry boys and me!

YUMMY!  Oh this was very good!  I added some left over gravy I had, and I think it made it a bit drier than intended. And I think maybe I'll double the recipe next time because it was so good!  I used button mushrooms!  Because it was a tad bit too dry, I just added some water and it came to life like a trooper!  Thanks so much, a new family favourite!

This was so good.  The house smelled wonderful while it was cooking.  My husband and I loved it.  I think this would be great for an adult get-together.  Don't think my 4 and 2 year old cared for it as much, especially with the mushrooms!  But will definately make this again.  Thanks!

This was pretty good.  You may want to cut down on the wine a bit.  A little overpowering, otherwise made for a hearty meal and tasty leftovers.

My family did not enjoy the texture of the meat, and thought the flavor was a bit bland.
