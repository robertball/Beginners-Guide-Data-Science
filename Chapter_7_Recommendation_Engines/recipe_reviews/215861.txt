This is an excellent recipe! Reminds me a lot of when I was a child and my mother made it. There was only a few tiny changes I made. First I used a bag of the Italian Blend Shredded Cheese (leftover from a cocktail party) for meats and cheese mixture and added one 4oz can of olives! It was so divine my toddler (who is picky) asked for THIRDS! Thanks a bunch for this recipe!

This is very good but instead of ground beef used Italian sausage for extra flavor and topped off with 1 cup of mozzorella cheese

Very Good! Didn't have enough sauce so I added a can of diced tomatoes and tomato sauce. Of course I had to throw in some garlic and italian seasoning. Before going in the oven I topped it with parmesan. Everyone had seconds. Can't wait to try the leftovers for lunch tomorrow

just delicious and so easy to make.  I sauteed some garlic with the onions and used mozzarella and provolone cheese.

This is a good pasta bake recipe. You definitely need to add some italian seasoning to the sauce and top it with parmesan before baking.

I love mushrooms and used fresh mushrooms which I sauted with the onion and some garlic.  I browned the meat separately with some minced garlic and added some Creole seasoning and Italian seasoning and mixed everything together.  I split it into two 8 X 8 pans and froze one for later.  I sprinkled Parmesan cheese over the tops of both.  Yum...at least a 4.5 rating!

Easy and delicious.  I used vegetarian meat crumbles in place of beef and it was great.

I give this recipe 5 stars because it is quick and easy to make AND my very picky toddler loved it!
I did use the 32 oz (Costco) size sauce and it was the perfect amount of sauce for my family.
