This cake should have 10 stars!!!  I made it for my husband's birthday last night.  I used a bundt pan (dusting with cocoa powder in lieu of flour) which required about an 20 minutes extra baking time.  I then let the cake cool for a few minutes in the pan, and then took it out of the pan to finish cooling while I made the frosting.  After the frosting was done, I put the cake back into the bundt pan and then poked holes in the bottom of the cake with a wooden spoon and a fork.  I then poured about half the frosting into the holes.  I would have let it sit like that for awhile but my husband was coming home so almost immediately I put the cake on the serving plate and then using a basting brush, painted the rest of the frosting onto the top of the cake.  Gobs of frosting still pooled into the "hole" of the bundt cake.  When my husband took the first bite, he exclaimed - "Oh My God!  It's filled with chocolate!"  I ***strongly*** recommend using the highest quality of cocoa powder available as it is the only chocolate in the cake.  I used Ghiradelli.  Also, the batter was quite runny when I poured it into the pan but it cooked up just fine.  I also "made" my own buttermilk by adding 1 T. apple cider vinegar to 1 c. milk and letting it set for a few minutes.  I also used 1/4 c. cocoa powder in the cake as opposed to just 3 T..  Amazing recipe!

I've never made the cake, but I have made the fudge icing and used it on other cakes.  It is delicious and truly tastes like fudge.  I would caution, however, that you do not beat it for the full 3 minutes if you intend to pour it over your cake (I like it poured over bundt cake).  It will not flow down the sides but rather sit on the top in more of a clump.  Stop beating when it looks a little thinner than what you want because it will set very fast.

After reading the reviews I decided to make a few small changes and made this a 5 star recipe (well at least to me).  I added 1/4 cup of cocoa powder instead of the 3T and an extra tsp of vanilla.  Also I didn't have buttermilk so I added a tsp of vinegar to a cup of regular milk.  The icing was very yummy even though I burnt it while boiling.  I saved it by just pouring off the good stuff and not scaping the bottom of the pot.  Also I only beat it for 2 min and didn't have any problems with it being too thick.  SUPER DUPER and very moist!

This cake is divine! So moist and tasty.  Do not skip the frosting step, it compliments the cake perfectly - it is just not the same cake without it.  I have made this cake several times and it has been consistently successful. Just a couple of suggestions:
I use a little over 1/4 cup of cocoa powder, instead of 3 tbls.
Do not burn your frosting.
Properly butter and flour your pan beforehand (I use a 9X13 pan).
Do NOT overbake. Take out while still slightly moist on the toothpick (not clean like the recipe says). I shut off oven and let the cake sit in for 5 min max after the slighly moist point.

and ENJOY!!!

The cake wasn't horrible but it wasn't the best that I've had. It was moist as other users have said but you would definitely want to add more cocoa..I used 1/4 cup..I would also recommend sifting the flour before use or use cake flour.

Flavor is excellent.  I only gave it 4 stars however, because I want more frosting.  I took a photo, which shows how the frosting doesn't cover the entire cake.  Sure, it is rich, and sweet... but I *like* chocolate cake that way!  The more the better!!  I did follow someone else's suggestion of using 1/4 Cup of Cocoa for the cake batter, and am glad I did.  Now I'm off to make another batch of frosting - yum! -

This recipe is fantastic!  Every chocolate cake I've ever made has come out dry but this one was perfect! and so easy!  I beat it by hand not with a mixer and used a chocolate buttercream frosting.  Ummmm! good!  But beware, you'll be coming back for 2nds and 3rds and it is sinfully rich and so delicious!

I haven't made the cake but I LOVE LOVE LOVE the icing.  It's a great way to make a boxed cake mix taste homemade!  My family (4boys + hubby) eat it all in one sitting.  Thanks!!

I bake A LOT and I followed this recipe exactly, but I will not make this cake again. I'm unsure why it has gotten such good reviews. Perhaps people have never had a really good piece of chocolate cake before. I'll give it 2 stars because it didn't taste "bad", but I think there are things wrong with the recipes for both the cake and the frosting. The cake definitely needed more cocoa powder. Also, the texture was strange when it had finished baking. Part of the problem may lie with the method in which it is mixed and it that it is a fairly runny batter. By itself, I didn't care for the cake at all. The fudge topping has a good flavor, but unless you like to crunch on granules of sugar, it should be cooked differently. The sugar needs a chance to dissolve. Fudge should be smooth, not crystallized. I think the problem may be that it needs more liquid, perhaps some corn syrup. I am going to look for another chocolate cake recipe. In all seriousness, the ones out of the box are better. Sorry, but this one is definitely not worth the time.

I made this cake and it is absolutely delicious.  I followed directions exactly.  I did use chocolate buttercream for frosting, recipe found on this site.  I baked in a 9x13, very moist, no issues.

Excellent. Very moist and nice flavour. I did find the fudge icing a bit too rich (but a friend found it perfect). Also, the batter is quite runny, if baking in springform, stick a pan underneath!

I read through the reviews before I made this cake just so I could make the best cake for the ingredients I had on hand. Money's tight and I really don't have money to waste when I mess up something like this. For the cake, I cut the sugar back by a cup and I used butter instead of vegetable oil. For the frosting, I used powdered sugar instead of regular white sugar (I had some powdered sugar I had to use up) and I doubled all the ingredients for the frosting because there were quite a few reviewers who said there wasn't enough frosting. This turned out great--almost like a cake of my own that's quite similar. I'm really glad I cut back the sugar in the cake as it would have been too sweet if I hadn't. Also, the frosting really does need to be doubled for an 9x13 cake. This made a quick dessert for us tonight with basic pantry ingredients. Don't worry about adding more chocolate to the cake. The frosting is rich and fudgy enough that it totally works with the cake and it works together. Trust me.

FABULOUS!  My 2.5 year old and I made this together for my husband's birthday.  It was easy and delicious.  We added slices strawberries on top.  My husband thought the strawerries added great flavor.

I'm munching on a piece right now and feeling mighty glad about it! It's like a good, old-fashioned, home-style chocolate cake that begs to be eaten with a glass of milk, and a cozy quilt (for your lap, that is!). I used my own favorite chocolate buttermilk frosting and they go nicely together. At some of the other reviewers' suggestions, I increased the cocoa to 1/4 cup and was glad I did. This isn't the darkest chocolate cake, so I can see why some of the reviewers were expecting more, especially since in the picture the cake looked very dark. It's not like the rich and dense chocolate cakes you might find in a restaurant. It's more light and fluffy, and very, very moist, which I love in a cake. A nice recipe using ingredients you will likely have on hand, and it's easy to whip up at the last minute for company or a mad-chocolate craving! Thanks for sharing, Sandy!

I didn't try the cake but the icing was the best.  Sets really quick so you have to work fast.  It smooths its self so if you are like me and not very good at frosting a cake it was great

The first few times I made this we thought it was great, but then we realized it had a noticeable "eggy" flavor.  I am going to give it one more try substituting cool water for the boiling water--I am afraid that is cooking the eggs!  Anyone else had that problem?
Note on 12/21/01--tried again, but still tasted eggy, won't make again

I did not make the cake but have used the icing over a store bought cake mix.  It was delicious!!  And very easy--  There's no way to tell you didn't do it all from scratch.  Thank you for such a delicious icing recipe. I will use it again and again!

this for the fudge icing only...haven't tried the cake. i made the icing with the "black magic cake." DELICIOUS icing!!! foolproof recipe!! and the consistency can be manipulated a little depending on how long you beat it for. TIP: spread the icing slightly warm..it'll be much easier to work with.

I made this exactly as the recipe showed. Normally I make a few changes but wanted to really try the way it was written. It was like eating air; no flavor in the cake at all. I have made the icing many times before and is the best frosting I have ever had, but the cake.....no way. I won't ever make it again with the given recipe. This is the first time I have ever given a 1 star on this site.

I didn't make the cake, only the frosting.  I made a box mix sheet cake, left it in the pan and poured this over it.  FABULOUS!  As suggested by other reviewers, I doubled the recipe and I let it cook on low for a few minutes to melt the sugar.  The consistency is PERFECT, not gritty at all.  Definitely will be using this in the future.

Really, really good and turned out not nearly as rich as I thought it was going to be.  It was surprising light tasting.  Made as directed except I used half oil half apple sauce instead of the full amount of oil.  Also baked in a bundt tin which was greased and dusted with cocoa powder (as per a previous reviewer).  Baked for a total of 50mins.   Made an excellent birthday cake :)

I absolutely love this cake! and honestly im not a huge chocolate cake fan but this one made a fan out of me. I make a peanut butter chocolate ganache instead of frosting and the flavors blend so well together.

Made this the other night, but instead of making a cake I made cupcakes. They looked wonderful with the shiny smooth frosting poured onto the tops. Taste= 2 star warm, but jumps to four stars once refridgerated and served cold.

I made this cake with half sugar and half Splenda for my diabetic husband and mother-in-law.
When their portions were cut, I made the frosting, which didn't thicken.  I didn't panic, but beat 1 cup of confectioners sugar and 1/2 cup of peanut butter into the frosting, which made it spreadable and delicious.  I will definitely make this cake again.

Very easy to make. Extremely moist and the icing recipe offered is perfect for it. I've made it twice. I've noticed it's one of those cakes that gets better over the days. I don't know why. It gets moister and richer. I think it is the perfect amount of chocolate flavor, especially with the icing. The icing never gets spreadable like frosting, though. Just pour it on the cake. It's icing, not frosting.

The cake does not have enough chocolate.  It had a very bland taste.  You need a lot of chocolate icing!  I did not try this fudge icing.

The pastry part was amazing BUT the icing turned out too thick, I had to add extra milk to it. :/  Overall though it turned out to be a good cake though.

This cake itself was moist, however, was not chocolatey enough for me at all.  I even used 1/4 cup cocoa powder.  The icing was very good tho.

I have seriously had box mixes that were better than this. Hardly any chocolate flavor without the frosting; the cake simply does not stand up on its own. Bland, boring, and a not to my liking.

A very delicious cake. I have made it twice. once making my own buttermilk with milk and vinegar and once with real buttermilk. I preferred the one with real buttermilk. I also added 3/4 tsp of salt the second time I made it and I think it made the flavour even better. Need to make a little more frosting next time when making a layer cake ( 3 layers) so I have enough to cover all the sides.

I made this in a rice cooker with additions mentioned in other reviews- around half a cup of cocoa powder in the cake and a little extra powdered sugar in the icing.  It was dense and rich- a friend said that it was just like cake from a restaurant.  I thought that the cake itself was a tad on the sweet side, so next time I make it (and I know I will!) I'll cut a bit of the sugar.  Mixing the baking soda with the buttermilk was a nice trick, too.

Disclaimer:  cake just made, I haven't yet tasted it.  I'm giving it 3 stars because it took sooo long for the center of the cake to set that the edges got a bit crispy. Also, despite reducing both the boiling and the beating time for the icing, it still got firm immediately and I could not even spread it to the edges of my 9 x 13 cake.  It might taste good, but it's not pretty.  Update:  Cake was pretty tasteless, even after increasing the cocoa as other readers suggested.  Icing was more like a chocolate crust.  Won't be making this again.

I made the Icing only, not the cake. The icing was so easy to make! And it tasted absolutely DELICIOUS. I will definitely use this icing recipe again.  Do not beat it for 3 minutes and don't let it cool for too long! (2 minutes or 1.5 is good enough) - it will be way too thick to spread and it will not pour out of the saucepan.

I would have given this 5 stars but I altered the recipe slightly.  3 TBSPs cocoa is not enough, I used almost 1/2 cup and it came out wonderfully.  I made a layer cake and used the fudge frosting for between the layers and made a chocolate buttercream frosting for the rest.  The cake was very moist and stayed that way for the couple days it lasted.

I didn't bake the cake but just used the icing on my own 13x9 chocolate cake. It was amazing! I wasn't able to get it over the entire cake because it set so quickly, but I'm a slow icer so that's not a surprise.

followed to the letter, very good but 2nd time I made it I used a smaller pan, 8 x 11 and it turned out even better. Icing worked better too as the 9 x 13 was too big to barely cover. I baked 35 mins instead of 30.

This is more like a soggy steamed pudding than a cake, even after baking 40 minutes. I notice that the pictured cake shrank from the edges, as did mine. It had a bland flavor. The icing was sugary but slightly bitter.

I have made this recipes 5 times now....it is really a cake for chocolate lovers. I have been allergic to chocolate for years...but I can eat recipes made with Chocolate powder instead of the rich Chocolates you have to meat first. The Icing should not be mixed as long as stated in the recipe...just enough to thicken just a little and thin enough to still pour on cake..Enjoy!

The cake turned out okay, not the best. I was expecting the cake to have soft crumbs which crumble easily, but this cake was chewy. Not the one I expected, so I won't make again.

it was a very moist chocolate cake, and the buttermilk smells really good when you are baking it. But I wasn't that impressed with the cake overall. I probably wouldn't make it again.

I absolutely LOVE this cake!! I will be using it as my go-to chocolate cake from now on, it also works well as cupcakes :) Bake about 18-20 mins a batch
I added a 1/4 cup, plus a tablespoon, of dutch cocoa power (because I love a rich chocolate flavor).
I also used 3 tablespoons vanilla as suggested.
I did not make the fudge icing, I made a simple buttercream frosting and it tasted wonderful. The longer the cake sat, the better it became...just ate the last slice on day 5 after baking...such a moist and fluffy crumb...

I was looking for a recipe that used Buttermilk as I had purchased it for another recipe. This is great recipe and it sounded familiar to me. I compared this with my Mom's recipe and she has been making this for years. The only change I made was low fat Buttermilk and 4 tablespoons for cocoa. I did make the fristing that was in included in this recipe and it was good, however I prefer my Mom's buttercream! Yummy cake!

The cake turned out very well. Since we dont get butter milk here so I added 1 tsp white vinegar in ordinary milk as a substitute. The receipe doesnt mention at which step should we add baking soda. 
Cake was a bit dry from inside despite the fact that I added a layer of icing in between.

I made this tonight and it was okay. The only change I made was to add a little extra cocoa and I am glad I did, this cake by itself was not very flavorful. The frosting is very much like hot fudge and together they make an okay cake. I made it into cupcakes and baked for 15 minutes.  I poked a hole in the center so some of the icing would get into the cupcake and hopefully add some chocolately flavor. I will probably not make this again.

5 stars for the fudge icing! I havent tried the cake but the icing is so incredible.  I used it on cupcakes and poked holes in them with a toothpick. The fudge saturated these cupcakes and made them irrestible.  Also saved left over fudge for hot fudge sundaes.  Incredible recipe! Thanks again Sandy.

Needs more cocoa powder! I gave it a 4 for moistness and for the frosting. I put 6 tablespoons. (Didn't read the reviews. Just out of instinct, knew it needed more.) Wasn't as chocolatly as I wanted it be. We are eating it though, almost gone.

Just ate my first piece and it was HEAVENLY!! I couldnt find my electric mixer so I had a difficult time with little flour balls in the batter ( if anyone can offer some tips to avoid that, I would really be greatful). The cake was exceptionaly moist and the frosting was the perfect touch. Had a similar flavor to molten lava cakes. Will definately put this one in my frequent/favorite cake rotations.

This cake is icky. Weak chocolate taste and bilge water coloring. Anyone with decent tastebuds should try the "Dark Chocolate Cake 1" recipe submitted by Carol. Better taste, color, texture...etc.

I'm sorry, but this cake did not work for me. It came out bland and spongy. I even added more cocoa powder as people suggested. Won't make again.

I tripled this recipe and made a huge multi-layer version as my wedding cake.  It was a great success, and i had to print out the recipe 14 times for some of my guests!

This cake is delicious. I used close to a half cup of cocoa powder and it was perfect. Very moist and full of chocolate flavor. The icing really is the perfect compliment to this cake. Great recipe, thanks.

The reviews on this cake are so overrated(in my opinion). This cake is brown, but a chocolate cake...I don't think so. I searched for a cake recipe using buttermilk because I had some left over from making pancakes. I should have saved the buttermilk for biscuits. None of the reviews mentioned that this batter is extremely loose(runny)so that was a shock to me. I am a heck of a cook and have catered many events and sold many home baked goodies, so I do not lack the skill. This is a terrible cake and the icing is not even an icing....it's more like a coco spread. The overly chocolate-tasting icing had to have been created to make up for the lack of flavor this dense (and more dense as it cools) cake. I can't see this recipe being made to taste better. I'll just stick with the cake recipes I know in the future. A tiny slice is all I needed and will never want more of this cake.

This absolutely the best recipe for chocolate cake I have ever baked. Most of my past attempts resulted in a dry, bland, cake. Not this one! This cake is beyond moist and has a light texture. This will be my go to recipe from now on.

This cake turned out absolutely amazing, it didn't last three days in our house.  Even my husband, who complained the entire time I was making it because he doesn't care for chocolate, helped himself to half of the cake.

I dont know what I did wrong. I think it was the type of cocoa I used. When I finished the cake, I cut myself a slice, it looked delicuos! It looked like a brownie or something like that, but when I bit into it it was tasteless. :(  Next time Ill try a different kind of cocoa.

Chocolate cake is my favorite and this cake was delicious... the best chocolate cake I've ever made.  My husband loved it.  It was perfectly moist and I really liked the fudge icing.  I prefer regular sugar over confectioners for making chocolate icing now that I've made this icing, it is not as super-sweet...very good.  I did use 1/4 cup cocoa instead of 3T for the batter. I would definitely recommend this recipe.

This didn't turn out for me. I'll admit, I didn't have Buttermilk. I used Milk and vinegar instead. It took twice as long to bake and the icing didn't set up right. It's okay for the chocolate craving, but I won't be making this again...

The only thing saving this cake is the fudge icing.  While the cake was moist, it tasted light and oily rather than rich and chocolatey.

Good chocolate cake and icing.  However, I think it should be 1/2 cup cocoa for the cake and probably 3 T cocoa for the icing.  I added more cocoa to the cake, but did not catch the mistake in the icing recipe...followed icing recipe to the T, except I used Splenda as I was out of white sugar.  Icing was not sweet enough!

Wonderful cake recipe. After reading some of the reviews, I decided to increase the amount of cocoa powder. But alas, I was running out and thus ended up only using the 3 tablespoons it says to in the recipe. Unfortunately, the cake did not have as much chocolate flavor as I had hoped it would; however it did have a great texture. Very pleased with the results! I only wish I could have made the icing, but after mixing the cake batter I found I was out of white sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder. Will make this again, hopefully with the icing too!

Flavor was amazing, though I anticipated a bit different texture.  The family loved this.  I just liked it.  I did, however, LOVE the glaze.  I used a whisk throughout cooking instead of the beaters and it was fine.  Really nice in a bundt pan, just be sure to add 10 minutes or so to cooking time.

Just made the ganache type icing. It was quite good. Really, really watch the timing when beating the icing mixture after the 1 minute boil. Time too short- a runny mess. Time too long - a thick blob.

I am back for my second baking of this recipe.  YUMMY.....ONE THING....everyone who said add MORE cocoa?  They are SPOT ON.  With added cocoa and cutting the recipe in half because there are only 2 of us....it's a KEEPER and a WINNER.  By the way....1/2 a recipe makes a dozen cupcakes and may I suggest ganache for frosting?  YUMMY GOOD!  THANKS for posting this.

This was the best chocolate cake I have ever made.  The changes I made was that I added like a 1/2 of cup of cocoa and sifted the flour.  The cake was very very moist and delicious.  I used a cream cheese frosting instead of the chocolate frosting.

I think this cake was so easy to make and looks fantasitc.  I love the mild flavor of the cake and think the icing is over the moon good.  Made it in a bunt cake and poored warm icing over cake before it was too thick.  I am always looking for not to sweet cakes and this is it.  I cant wait till the morning to enjoy this with coffee.

If you like chocolate then this is the cake for you.  I love chocolate and this might just be a little too much for me.  The icing is delicious but very rich.  I baked the cake in a bundt pan like one of the reviewers did and it turned out great.  It does require more backing time.  I just poured the icing over it more like a glaze than frosting.  Very good but very rich almost like a chocolate cake you would have at a nice restraurant.

Good recipe, flavorful - but maybe that's because I added 1/2 c semi-sweet chips to the boiling water until mostly melted.  I boosted the cocoa powder, too, according to the previous reviews.  I doubled the recipe thinking it would be the right amount for 1/2 sheet pan.  Probably could have just done 1.5 recipe.  Doubling made a lot!  I always taste the batter and learned that if the batter tastes good, so will the cake.  My version tasted great.  For frosting I made it as is but when beating with a mixer I added 1 cup powdered sugar.  Nice texture and easily spreadable if you don't wait too long.

The cake batter was very liquidity, and mine seemed to rise too quickly, so the middle sunk a bit. Also, took longer to cook, which could be my altitude (3000). The cake was delicious but I did a 1/2 cup of cocoa as others suggested. I frosted with chocolate buttercream frosting, no complaints here!

This recipe makes a decent chocolate cake. I reduced sugar in both the cake and icing because I love the bitterness in dark chocolate. And, this cake is incomplete without the fudge icing--it is a must! Fortunately, I read others' reviews. I used a hand whisk to beat the icing mixture, and stopped once it started to thicken up. Otherwise, it'd thicken up so fast that you couldn't pour it onto the cake. And, the best part was that the icing set up really fast. But I do agree with other reviewers: The icing couldn't completely cover up the cake. So, I'll double the icing next time around. With these adjustments, this recipe isn't too bad at all.

Overall a very rich and moist cake.  I recommend increasing the cocoa powder to at least 1/4 cup, and double the frosting recipe.  I also poked holes in cake and frosted while warm (not hot).  This cake only gets better as it sets, so make a day ahead of time if possible!  Also keep an eye on the time.  Mine was done about 5 min before recommended time.  
Thanks for the great recipe!

Yum!  So moist & fudgey!  I didn't have buttermilk so I used milk, a blob of sour cream & a teaspoon of vinegar in place of it.  I also upped the coco powder in the cake to 1/4 cup.  I'm glad I did.  To avoid the burnt frosting that some complained of, I microwaved it about 2 minutes, stirring a couple of times, instead of on the stove-top.  You also could use the double boiler method.  I topped mine with nuts because I like nuts.  Oh, so YUMMY!

Everyone loved the cake.  I would've liked it to be more chocolatey.  I will add even more cocoa than I did this time the next time I make.  It was more of a spongy almost brownie like consistency...not sure if making the conversion for an 18x24 cake worked as it was supposed to or not.

Delicious! I made this for a friend's birthday and it was gone within minutes.  The frosting I added a bit of icing sugar and real chocolate to which made it even more desirable. I would make this if I were you.

**When you mix the buttermilk and soda make sure you have it in a large enough container or it will overflow because it expands** This cake is good, just not great. The fudge icing is really good. It seems that it wont be enough to frost the cake, but it is. Like others have stated it sets up fast. I made the frosting again for another cake and added 1 cup small marshmallows after I took it off the burner. Mixed as directed. Yum!!

This was good.  Not 5-stars good, but good.  I would not classify this as easy to make as is indicated in the recipe.  I couldnt imagine a "child" making this.  It has a lot of steps to it, but it is worth the effort.  I rarely look for easy in a recipe, more concerned with quality and taste.

I made this cake and it's FANTASTIC!  So moist.  Since I'm an experienced cook I didn't worry about the boiling water and just used warm tap water and that worked out fine.  I also don't usually have buttermilk on hand but I do have the powdered buttermilk that you mix with water for baking.  (4tbs. powder + 1 cup water = 1 cup buttermilk)   It works  great and did work well for this cake.  I didn't make the icing since I have my own icing recipe I like to use. My husband is not a huge fan of sweets but he loved this cake.

This cake and frosting were quite good. As suggested by others I added extra cocoa to the cake. The cake itself isn't the best but the frosting is especially delicious. I actually used it as a filling for my cake and then put ganache on top. It was very popular. I did have a little trouble with the frosting though. I tried to make 1 1/2 batches and it sugared on me so stick with the original recipe. I made the first batch of frosting( filling for me) as per the recipe and it turned out beautifully but I tried to make another 1 1/2 batch and it sugared. My next single batch was again delicious. Go figure. Definitely try this recipe.

I made this exactly as they stated....except I didn't make icing.
The cake has a weird texture and kind of like stretchy candy and unfortunately I won't be eating this. But I'm sure my teenage boys will eat it!
Disappointed wasted ingredients and time!!

This was so moist and decandant! We cannot stop eating it. I did had some expresso powder to the cake mix though, to help bring out that chocolate flavor. The icing was still a bit gritty but I think it was because I didn't cook it long enough. And I ran out of vanilla lol. But the cake by itself is enough to keep us coming back! I will definitely be making this cake again, and maybe just do a simple peanut buttercream icing on it. Or fresh berries.  Baked in a 9x13 pan, and it came out perfect.

We absolutely loved it! Followed exact ingredients. Only thing I did different was sifting the flour, used a Bundt pan, and drizzled the fudge icing before it thickened up. Will definitely be making this again!

This is not a good cake. I ran out of ingredients for my go-to chocolate cake and whipped this up in about 8 minutes. I increased the cocoa powder and added much-needed salt and it was still one of the blandest cakes I've ever had. Texture and moisture were great, but it had next to no flavor and is unusually eggy in an unpleasant way.

I baked in a bundt pan and did use 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. The cake was moist and yummy! Not too sweet or 'rich', which was what I was looking for. The batter is 'runny'. I thought maybe I didn't put enough flour (my son had distracted me for a minute and I lost count of how much flour I had already scooped in). However, a quick read of the reviews and I read the batter is runny. I made it for someone's birthday at work. Everyone loved it. Only thing I didn't do was beat the frosting with a mixer. And I cooked it on medium instead of letting it boil. For these reasons, my frosting was somewhat grainy (from sugar crystals). Not a super big deal but next time I'll make sure it breaks down. Also, I used buttermilk in the frosting since I didn't have regular milk. YUMMMMMMY!

My wife and I love this recipe so much, my wife begs me to bake one _every_ time she's in the mood for a chocolate cake.

She even prefers it over her traditional, family recipe Sour Cream Chocolate Cake! (And that's saying a LOT!) In fact, the only time she bakes her family recipe cake is when she invites her mother over for cake.

No changes to the recipe necessary. I use a heavy cast aluminum Bundt pan, and cocoa vs flour when greasing the pan for fantastic results every time.

I made this with the additional cocoa and instead of a cup of boiling water, I used a cup of coffee. The batter was runny as others have said.  I cooked it for 5 extra minutes as it wasn't quite done.  Delicious!!  The frosting turned out fine. I doubled the recipe. I did not have time to cool it so I poked holes in the cake and poured the frosting on top.   Excellent.

I took the advice of another reviewer and made it in a bundt pan. I also injected some of the frosting into the cake. It was fantastic!! My family loved it. It was gone in about 18 hours. I shared with some coworkers who all demanded the recipe. One suggested that next time I inject it with some homemade marshmallow or Ho Ho type of filling. I will try that for sure. But I kept all of the ingredients the same and it was awesome. My dad said the only problem he had with it was that I didn't give him a big enough piece lol.

easy, light and yum. I made this for my bday and it was a hit.
I aslo made the icing yum, a really delish cake - I ate half of the cake on my own. With a culpa yum.
Can not make this cake again as I have put on weight as it was in my fridge and I picked at it until it was all gone.

It came out incredibly spongy (in a bad way) and dense, not light at ALL. I cooked it for the correct time, yet in the middle it was even worse. It was like a sponge that was flavorless. I followed the directions 100% the exact same way, didn't even make any alterations. I would not recommend this recipe at all.

This recipe is perfect exactly how it is. My only complaint is that I will be gaining 5lbs this weekend because it is so addictive. The cake is moist and amazing, but not too too sweet. The icing is fudgy and fantastic.

Cake came out great. After reading reviews, I was concerned I would not have enough fudge frosting, so I added some leftover buttercream frosting I had in the fridge from Christmas cookie baking. Made the perfect amount. Got rave reviews. Thanks for sharing

I made this for my boyfriend's birthday. I added raspberries on top for decoration and to add a fruity flavor. Everyone at the dinner party loved it. Even someone who doesn't do a lot of sugar asked for an extra piece to enjoy the next day.

I only made the frosting, but it was GREAT! I didn't realize the frosting would still be runny sort of even after 3 mins of beating. I beat the frosting for WAY too long. But, I didn't care, it was still wonderful.

Cake itself was amazing, very moist!  However the icing was a bit bitter, perhaps too much cocoa, I would half the amount next time.

Have made this cake 3 times now and each time it turned out sucessful.  I personally made the cake just in a 9 x 13 pan... just due to face that is what worked for my crowd.  I did not use the icing though, I didn't think it would be well recipe, so I  used a butter icing with cocoa in it... that was great on the cake.....  naturally sprinkles for the kids!

This review is actually for the Fudge Icing only- I made a cake from cake-mix and poured this fudge icing over the top before the cake cooled (this was a great time saver, and ensured that the icing went on smooth and glossy.  It was awesome!  Tastes so good, and even though a few reviewers complained that the frosting didn't make a lot, it seems you don't need a thick layer of frosting because of the richness/sweetness.

ehh. This cake wasn't too good. It was more mos than it should have been, and since there was too less sugar the cake turned out bland. Terrible. Too squishy and I will not save this recipe.

I've only used the recipe for this icing, not made the cake so that's what my rating is for. Only thing I did have to do differently was use the electric mixer on it for 10 min. to get it to thicken up like I wanted. Poured it on the recipe from this site for one bowl brownies and let it sit a couple of hours. Fantastic!! Thanks for the recipe.

We love this cake!!  It is so good. The frosting is very good, too.  Simple and satisfying!
I just made the cake again and it is still my favorite simple chocolate cake recipe.  It seems pretty wholsome, too-not too sweet.  I used evaporated cane sugar instead of white sugar in both the cake and the frosting and it tastes just the same.  Great recipe!

Made the icing and not the cake. The icing is amazing! I beat it for about two minutes and it was starting to thicken a lot, DO NOT do three! Other than that it's perfect!

Delicious.  An old friend gave me this recipe and I lost it.  I have searched for some time.  The frosting is prepared a little different; 

1 st. butter
2 Tbs. cocoa
6 T. milk

1 lb. pdr. sugar
1 tsp. vanilla
1 c. chopped nuts, walnuts preferred.

Put butter, cocoa, and milk in same small pan and bring to boil. Gradually beat in powdered sugar, nuts, and vanilla. Pour over hot cake, spread and cool.  Spread warm on warm cake.

This was an average cake. Better than store bought, but I probably won't make it again.

It was ok, worked out well and everyone ate it but not the best chocolate cake I've ever tasted so 4/5 - Just not chocolately enough for me I'm afraid!

I did not like this recipe - just personal taste.  My 3 year old ate it, probably because it's sweet with the frosting. My 2 year old did not like it.

The cake was good, but not the best i could have. Somehow the cake didn't turn out spongey enough, and was a little soggy (but not very noticable unless you're the baker ;p). It could have been the water cos i'm not familliar wih cakes with hot water in the batter. But the fudge was delicious. I'll definitely use the fudge with another chocolate cake recipe i work well with.

absolutely fabulous. i added another tbs of cocoa. sooo dense and chocolatey. LDSGirl suggested that you put vinegar into milk to make a buttermilky-type deal, but mama always taught me to squeeze some lemon juice into milk to make it curdle. just make sure not to let any seeds pop in!!

I used the icing on a different cake. It was good, not perfect but good. I actually liked the icing better the next day.

easy recipe, but like others, i found the cake part to be way too bland. needs more cocoa, a pinch of cinnamon and a dash of salt. the icing was not very fudgelike, either. it's ok. i might make it again w/ the above changes.

So Chocolaty and moist - we had to eat little pieces at a time!  My neighbors (whom I shared it with) are still raving about it.  I changed cocoa to 1/4 cup also (maybe a tad more...)

This cake is awesome! Not a very strong chocolate flavour, but really really moist.
I didn't try the icing though, I didn't use any icing at all on this cake.
Will make this one again and again.

I really liked this recipe--however, I substituted Splenda for the sugar in the fudge icing--BIG MISTAKE!!  Follow the recipe to the letter and don't use sugar substitute...you'll be pleased with the results!
