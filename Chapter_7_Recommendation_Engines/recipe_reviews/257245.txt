Loved it!  I tried to make as exact to recipe as I could but didn't have the Portuguese chili sauce so substituted chili garlic sauce that I had on hand. Spicy good! I originally thought 15-20 min sounded long for shrimp as well but actually ended up cooking even a bit longer for the liquids to absorb and the sauce to thicken up. I used 21-26 count raw shrimp that I did shell just because I didn't want to shell after cooking. I imagine the flavor would have been even better had I left them on. Will have a loaf of French bread for next time to get every drop of sauce. I am definitely going to hunt down the Pimenta and try it with cod too!!! Thanks so much for a great recipe!!!

Oh yes!!!!!   From southeastern MA, you grow up on this or close variations.   This is outstanding.   Made it your way and it is excellent.   My grandmother made the same basic thing with hearty fish (Cod).  Also fantastic.   Thank you for the recipe.

15-20 minutes is too much cook time for the shrimp in my opinion but other than that this recipe is great. The flavors really come together nicely and me and my husband both give this recipe two thumbs up. The recipe didn't specify but be sure to use raw shrimp and not the already cooked kind. Great recipe!

Next time I will double the sauce! This was delicious even with a few substitutions, like basil for the parsley, Srirchoa hot chili sauce for the Portuguese sauce, and soy sauce and white wine for the chicken bouillon.  I served this over rice with zucchini and yellow squash.

Delicious. Used Amore Chili Pepper Paste in tube in place Portuguese hot pepper sauce.  Let sauce cook down before adding shrimp so they do not over cook.  Thanks for the recipe.

Excellent! Had to make a few changes. Can’t really get Portuguese hot sauce in Alaska, and we don’t really like spicy, so used Pico Pica taco sauce. For the ale used Guinness Extra stout and it added a bold, savory flavor. Serving over a bed of Farro!

It was delicious!! Made the shrimp exactly as the recipe stated, and it turned out wonderfully. I served it over a bed of Jasmine rice and a seven superfood salad. It was the perfect dinner!!

Sorry I didn’t take picture. Everyone loved it including my mom who usually doesn’t like anything I make. She went for seconds. Everyone wanted more next time I’ll double it. I made it for 8 people

So delicious! Reminded me of a dish that I had in the Azores and I’m happy to be able to recreate it.

This was very good and I will make it again. I didn't have tomato paste and used some spaghetti sauce I had...and used sriracha sauce for the hot pepper sauce. The shrimp only took half the time to cook, and was great with rice.
