Let me tell you, as a college student looking for quick and tasty meals this was simply amazing. I bought about a pound of boneless top sirloin and adjusted everything so that it would fit with a pound of meat. I didn't really make any changes to add my own flavor to the recipe but I did use garlic powder with some herbs mixed in, and I used a George Foreman Grill. 5 minutes in the good ol' GF Grill and they were done to my liking. Quite possibly some of the best tasting steak I have ever had and it only took about 15-20 minutes from fridge to my stomach. As a side note I'd like to recommend a good Fat Tire beer to go along with it, simply tasty!

This was very good.  We don't have a grill yet so I seared these on the stove-top with the lid.  Got a good crust on the steak and the garlic was tasty.  To save on fat I used low-fat marg.  I will definitely make this again.

Wow!  This is restaurant quality.  We used NY strips that came out great.  For the butter I used about 1/3 c. with 1 & 1/2 tsp. of minced garlic in the jar, 1/2 tsp. of garlic powder, and 1/4 tsp. dried parsley.  I let it get to room temp. and made a paste.  I put it back in the fridge while the steaks were on the grill.  Once they came off, I let the butter melt over them.

Our local grocery store had sirloin steaks on sale for $2.99 a pound, so I got two good steaks for $2.12 and they were as tender as any more expensive steaks I've ever fixed! I rubbed them with meat tenderizer and cracked black pepper, and let them rest on the counter for about an hour. Then heated a cast-iron skillet and threw a little salt in the pan, seared the steaks about 4 or 5 minutes per side until they released from the pan. This gave them a nice browned crust while the inside remained fork-tender. Didn't change a thing about the sauce, these steaks were awesome!

I love steak. Love it with garlic and I love it with butter too. This recipe caught my eye with its addition of  garlic powder, and while I kind of knew this would be over the top garlic for me I figured 200+ reviewers who loved it couldn't be wrong, so I was willing to give it a try. Turns out I was right. Should have used a more reasonable amount of fresh garlic, cooked it a little to take the raw garlic taste out of it, and left it at that! Better yet, I should have had my husband's wonderful, perfectly grilled steak just as is. The taste of raw fresh garlic and the strong taste of the garlic powder was just unpleasant. More often than not, it's best to trust your instincts.

I'm giving this 3 stars because the ingredients work but the preparation does not.

If you check out the low reviews, you'll see many indicate that the garlic was overpowering.  This is because the directions say to simply toss in the butter, powder and raw minced garlic, then melt it.

What it should say is to saute finely minced garlic in just a small amount of butter until it begins to caramelize, then remove it from the heat and add the remainder of butter, stirring as it melts in.  This will give you a rich but not overpowering garlic butter.

Adding garlic powder at that point is optional, it depends on how strong of a flavor you'd like.

Thank you for posting this recipe. My hubby and I found it to be wonderful. I used it on filet mignon for a special occasion and not a morsel was to be found afterwards. I also added chopped fresh chives and parsley to the butter. Just a little tip: During the holiday season, I used a recipe very similar to yours to make refrigerated crescent rolls. After unrolling the crescent rolls flat on a baking sheet, I brushed on a little of a mixture similar to this, and everyone went wild. Of course we had turkey and ham (no need for garlic), and the cresent rolls were a lively surprise & hit. I also tried this on broccoli and it was lucious.

Try brushing the garlic butter onto the steaks the entire time they are grilling.  Great on any kind of steak.  Grew up grilling steaks this way.

Delicious! The only thing I would do differently is use less butter to give it a thicker consistency, about a third of a cup instead of half of a cup. When I made it the second time I did that and it turned out great. Much better than when I used the original recipe.

We are strictly a "tenderloin" steak family, but my sister bought us a bunch of sirloin steaks that I had no idea what I was going to do with.  I tried this recipe (I tenderized the steaks first though) & we could not believe the results.  Even my husband agreed that we have had some tenderloin that was not this good!

Awesome! I didn't grill but pan seared, sauteed an onion and then made a gravy as suggested by another reviewer by adding butter, milk and Worcestershire sauce. Then I poured it all (including garlic butter) into a casserole dish, topped with some chopped mushrooms, covered with foil and baked for about 25 minutes at 350º (don't like rare steak). Very tender, didn't even need a knife.

This is just a variation of the German "Krauter Butter" or herbed butter.  Soften a stick of butter and add the garlic, freshly ground pepper, and combination of herbs that you like (thyme, rosemary, parsley, etc).  Place the butter on foil and roll up.  Let it harden in the fridge and just slice off a pat to put on grilled food.  Everytime I've ordered a beefsteak in Germany, it comes with a piece of this melting "Krauter Butter" on it.

WARNING!: Very unhealthy! But fine to eat once in awhile ...  This made my house smell AMAZING! My fiance absolutely loved it. We do not have a grill so what I did was sprinkle sea salt and pepper on both sides of the steak, placed on a cookie sheet, place baby bella mushrooms all around then covered it all in the garlic butter sauce. I then covered it with tinfoil and baked at 425 for 25 minutes, then 5 min. on broil. The whole thing was amazing! Served with homemade mashed potatoes and garlic/mushroom sauteed green beans (my own Recipe!) Delicious

OMG! Simple and Fantastic. Preheated pan to 450 in oven, placed on high burner and seared 45 sec to a min on each side seasoned with pepper and salt. Placed back in over for 2:30 each side, let rest for a few perfect med rare steaks with RAVE REVIEWS. I'm a STUD again in the house! LOL. Thanks great recipe.

As a carnivore AND garlic loving family, this recipe was OH MY GOODNESS good!  HELPFUL HINT:  I sautéed the garlic for a few minutes before adding the butter. This helps to dispel the garlic's raw bitterness.  Absolutely superb.  Family gave thumbs up to add to the favorites file.  Thank you Solana for the recipe!

Very flavorful!  No need for steak sauce prepared this way.  I used 1/3 cup butter, garlic salt instead of powder (just ran out of powder) and bottled garlic instead of fresh.  It was delicious!  Thanks for a great EASY recipe!

Delicious! I marinated my steaks in Dale's Seasoning first, seared on the stove top in an iron skillet for 2 minutes on each side over high heat. Then, transferred the steaks to a very hot oven for 6 minutes. Poured the garlic butter over the steaks, wrapped in foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Will make over and over again!

What I did was cooked my steak in a skillet a few min. on each side then put in a baking dish in the oven around 425 for maybe 15-20 min. then used the broiler maybe 2 min per side...the meat was nicley cooked, wasnt dried out but i may have cooked it a bit to long in the skillet..im sure the grill would have been better as the recipe says to do..with the butter what i did was put some butter in a skillet, added onions and cooked til soft and lightly browned, then added a bit more butter and some garlic powder, didnt have garlic cloves..this all came out good..a bit on the unhealthy side though, so not something id make weekly, but once in a while is ok.

What's even easier than this method is to make a compound butter using the ingredients. Use room temp butter and blend all ingredients into it; then roll it up in waxed paper and chill or freeze.  You will always have it on hand for whenever you want it--for steak, potatoes, veggies, etc...just cut off a pat of butter and dollop on top.  It will melt on its own.

I honestly don't like a lot of "gunk" covering my steak. I like to taste the steak. This recipe let me taste the steak and not gunk it all up. The first time I made it exactly the way the recipe read and it was excellent. The next time I made it I added a teeny bit of horseradish to the butter and it was excellent as well. Even picky hubby who isn't a big fan of garlic thought it was good. Very nice recipe for those of us who like to taste the meat and not have it over seasoned the way so many make it nowadays!

After reading all of the positive reviews this got, I made it for my fiancees birthday dinner. We were disappointed! This sounds so good but the cut of meat is the wrong cut to use. It just didn't taste like anything even slightly special. I have had much better luck buttering filet mignon in the last minute of cooking and adding a dash of parsley or chives. Much better than this!!

Searing the steak in a nice hot pan with some butter when you don't have a grill handy works well also.

Very good, but I didn't find it to be quite garlic-y enough.  I also will add a little red pepper next time, it needs a little zing.  Thanks for a great recipe!

A very tasty, garlicky steak! In preparing the garlic butter I decided to soften the butter at room temperature last night. I did not use the 1/4 cup called for in the recipe, thought it was too much butter. After reading other reviews of this recipe I decided not to use fresh garlic so I would not be surprised by the unpleasant taste of uncooked RAW garlic in the butter. I had a jar of garlic on hand so I figured I could use a little of that. Once the butter softened to room temperature I added a little minced garlic from a jar, chopped, fresh chives, italian flat leaf parsley, salt, pepper and put it back in the refrigerator to let the flavors build up. One hour before making the steak I seasoned it with hawaiian salt, black pepper, put it back in the fridge. I grilled the steak and when it was done I placed the steak on a plate and added a dollop of the butter on top and let it slowly melt. The steaks were nice and hot, juicy, tender and garlicky.  Steaks melted in my mouth and I am glad that I did not use a lot of butter, it was just the right amount for the two of us. I served this with rice and salad. everything was wiped out in a minute!! My other half said it was a 5 stars plus plus and soooo ONO! (Very delicious!) He added that the steaks taste like it came from a restaurant. also liked the presentation with the butter melting on top of the steak. I will be making this again.

We just finished eating this & I couldn't wait to send in a review!  Oh my, was this delicious!  I made the garlic butter just as posted & it really made the steak!  The butter was so good in fact, we poured the remainder over our baked potatoes!  Try it, you will not be dissapointed!

This is the best steak we have ever had. I did make a few changes and it came out perfectly. I marinated the steak with chopped garlic, salt, and pepper, and then refrigerated for an hour prior to cooking. Instead of grilling, I baked the steak in the oven for approximately 30 minutes and 350 degrees. When cooked to a medium temp, i took them out and brushed them with the garlic butter. My boyfriend and I both said we could eat this every night. Thank you!!!

We didn't care for this in the slightest. The overwhelming taste of fake garlic from the garlic powder ruined a perfectly good strip steak. Why not use just fresh garlic for the whole thing, since you're using that ingredient anyway? Dehydrated, polyester ingredient=polyester taste. Never again.

This recipe is amazing on the grill or in a cast iron.  I preheated my pan at 475 for a few minutes (had sliced potatoes roasting) and then put it on the stoptop on high for a few minutes before putting the steak in.  put the steak on 30 seconds without touching, then flipped for another 30 seconds and finished in the same 475 deg oven for 2 more minutes on each side (med rare).  let it rest for a few minutes and it was amazing!!

Butter, garlic, steak?  Could it get any better?  This was soooo good, why haven't I heard of this before?  I heated the butter with the garlic to the point of boiling and removed from heat and let it sit there while the steaks cooked.  The flavors melded perfectly and the garlic wasn't raw.  I don't think I'll be able to make a steak any other way now.

OMG!! I can't believe I never thought of this.  I am a huge garlic lover; I put it in everything except dessert and coffee.  This was fantastic!  I seared a top sirloin, let it rest, then sliced it and poured the garlic butter over the slices.  It was like I died and went to garlic heaven.  Wonderful recipe!  I can't thank you enough! (to other reviewers:  this is not a marinade, it's a sauce.  Read the recipe!)

My new fave way to cook my steak!  I seasoned steak with garlic salt and black pepper, added some worchestire sauce and poured garlic butter mixture over top, wrapped in foil and baked at 400 for 20 mins or so.  Next time will use a better cut of meat, as it wasn't super flavorful...but overall a keeper!

I don't usually use this cut of meat, so I needed a recipe because I bought some on sale and didn't know what to do with it. Unfortunately the garlic butter did nothing to tenderize the meat and even though I exactly followed the instructions it was tough. I plan to see if a recipe that calls for marinating the meat helps. The garlic butter whould probably taste ok on a better cut of steak.

Great simple way to jazz up steak!  I cut the recipe in half and still used 4 cloves of garlic.  I also basted while on the grill with the butter mixture.  Yum!

Great recipe! I made a few changes though. I evenly rubbed approximately 1/2 tsp of rosemary powder and 1/2 tsp of dried rosemary needles on each steak (fresh rosemary needles are the way to go but I didn't have any on hand). I then let the steaks age for about 30 minutes at room temperature before grilling. For the glaze, I used Smart Balance rather than butter. I also brushed the steaks with the Smart Balance/garlic glaze several times on both sides during the grilling process. Absolutely delicious!

The weather was just too good - I had to dust down the barbecue and start cooking on it again! Glad i did - these were a great start. I don't like to marinade my steaks so the garlic butter just added flavour without ruining the meat.

Great steaks!! Made these for my girlfriend and family for mothers day. I got my butcher to cut some 2" thick New York strip. Everyone that had one (6 of us,all adults) said it was the best steak they have ever had. To be fair the best steak house in a 30 mi radius is Outback. The taste of the meat, not the marinade comes through. I have been told that we WILL be having these again.

Sorry, didn't like this at all. Was hoping this simple flavouring would liven up the steak but the combination of fresh garlic, garlic powder and greasy butter just didn't work for us. Won't be trying again.

You may as well save yourself the time, effort, and extra calories.  Just put some garlic powder on the steak along with the salt and pepper.  This wasn't anything amazing.

Omg, this is so delicious! I had 2 rather thin looking N.Y. strip steaks and was looking for a recipe to make them taste good. Intead of the grill I just cooked them under the broiler, in the stove, on a pan lined with greased foil. I changed the calculate button to 2 servings and then further cut the garlic butter in half again, because of their size. Yum!

I have made this same type of butter garlic sauce for years.  I have never really measured it out, just make it as garlic tasting as you like. I make enough to brush over the steaks while cooking.  Sometimes I even saute some mushrooms in the garlic butter and pour that combination over the finished steak.  This is good with just about any type of steak.

Actually, you don't even need the butter.  Just rub the steaks with the garlic and then grill.  These taste  better than SteakHouse steaks!  The garlic actually brings out the steak taste.  Amazing!  Everyone wants to know the 'secret' to our steaks.  It's all about the garlic.  :-)

Great recipe! For those using a George Foreman grill, definitely cook only for 5 minutes for a medium steak. I cooked it for a little too long, making it a little chewy. The garlic butter is fantastic! My fiance ate everything! Made it with garlic mashed potatoes. Plan to try it on grilled salmon.

This is great and love the flavor. For years I have used garlic and rosemary  butter to season my steaks whether I grill, fry, broil, or bake them.The only thing I do differently is I prefer ribeye or filet migon instead of sirloin.

Nixe finishing touch for a grilled sirloin.  Yes it's extra fat, but if I'm going to buy a good sirloin, I'm not going to worry about that! Really enjoyed it and my guests raved about my steaks.

We had a bit of a heat wave here in Ohio a few days ago.  With the temps reaching 58 degrees (almost unheard of in Ohio in January), we jumped at the chance to grill out.  I ran to the store and bought two beautiful filet mignons.  I tied them individually with cooking string, using slipknots to secure them into beautiful, perfectly round steaks.  I seasoned the steaks as I normally would and made this garlic butter.  After Hubs grilled these to perfection, I allowed them to rest, topped them with the garlic butter and served. Even though I scaled this recipe to two servings, there was a little garlic butter leftover, but Hubs eagerly polished that off while devouring his steak.  I will make this again, but I may try it next time without the garlic powder.  I thought it may have contributed a slightly artificial taste.  Next time I’ll just add another clove of minced garlic.  Thanks for the recipe!

My guys thought this was just "ok".  Even though I followed the directions as written, they said it didn't have much of a garlic flavor.  I'm thinking it should marinade first

FINALLY! Although it was on the tough side, This had the best flavor!! I took the advice of another commenter and used the side of my knife and made a paste with the garlic, added it and the garlic powder to my butter. I cooked them on the grill and when they were about finished I turned the grill off,  put the butter on, closed the lid came in and finished making my salad so they could rest. Thank-you Solana for an AWESOME recipe!

I avoid barbeques, specially with good cuts, but I did it this time for this recipe which I followed to the letter. I used my standard thickness of sirloin (11/2" - 2') for I prefer bleu to rare and for this I assure that meat already has an internal heat before grilling. The texture of the steak was not as I wished but that accounted for the fact that in following this recipe I salted while cooking (something I never do). The meal was nevertheless entertained by my family. I used ghee instead of butter.

Very awesome...I was weary the first few bites with the garlic butter, unsure if I liked it, my hubby too, but after that, we were pouring it on every bite!  The only thing I changed is I always add Lawry's Season Salt on my steak with the salt and pepper.  That's it and it was great!

So sorry to give this a bad review, based upon all the wonderful ones it has received.  We really looked forward to trying this, but there was not much flavor and the greasiness of the butter put us off.

5 stars for the sauce, mainly cause it can be used on anything you want the great taste of butter and garlic on.
3 stars for the steak choice.
top sirloin has alot of waste on it, only part of it is truely a great cut of meat, which around here is cut away and sold as top of Iowa sirloin. And to keep it great we cut it 1 1 1/4 inch thick, when cooking, cook to med rare.
You want a great tender steak with out the price tag use chuck eye steaks. They are cut of the chuck when we make the roast for the counter. You will have to ask your butcher for them in most places it usually a secret cut, how do i know i work in a full service meat dept.

I changed this recipe somewhat, but it was the best steak I've ever barbequed.I used about 1 1/2 lb of top sirloin to which I added a small amount of salt and pepper to both sides , seared it on both sides at high heat and then cooked it on the grill for about 8 to 10 mins. I roasted a whole head of garlic in the oven at 350 for about 20 to 30 mins. I added roasted garlic to approx. 1/4 cup of butter and when the steak was done I transfered it to a platter and spread the butter mixture on it and let it sit for a few minutes. My niece was visiting for dinner and she said it was the best steak she'd ever had. This is how I'll cook my steak from now on.

I think, just fix your steak the way you like it and put a pat of butter on top to melt.

My husband is on the Atkins diet. I am tired of the same old meats with slightly different flavor. This was very good! My husband (a meat lover, especially fond of filet mignon)loved it. This recipe is a definate keeper. Thanks for sharing!

When they said "melt in your mouth" they meant it!  Our family loves steak and this one just tasted fantastic.  For quite a while at the dinner table, all you could here was "Mmm,Mmm"!  Thanks for the recipe!  We used ribeyes, by the way (that's our favorite cut of steak).

WINNER!  Something as simple as garlic and butter makes such a nice touch to an ordinary steak.  I used my microwave to melt the butter and garlic.  It was much easier than having to dirty a saucepan.  A very basic recipe but a WINNER nevertheless!  Thank you Solana for sharing!

This is the best steak recipe I have ever made!  I don't even care for steak that much and this just moved steak to the top of my "like" list.  I used 24 oz of steak and cut the recipe in half and it was just the right amount.  My husband suggested that next time, I make the whole amount and in half of it put sauteed mushrooms to serve on the steak also.  I am going to do that.  Thank you for the most wonderfully simple recipe.

Sooo good! Made exactly as written, but let it refrigerate while steaks were on the grill to form a paste.  When the ribeyes were done, I scooped the "paste" on top of each steak to let it melt on top.  Looked so pretty!

Yum! Cooked 3 NY Strip steaks and used the first one sliced over a spinach, red onion and blue cheese salad. Hubby LOVED it, and the best part, there are still 2 steaks left over to have for lunch tomorrow...hmmm...what to use them with next?

This a great idea with definite restaurant quality results.  The only change we made was to the garlic butter recipe.  We melted a stick of butter in a sauce pan with minced garlic, pepper, a little Parmesan cheese and some paprika and had fantastic results!  Make sure you serve the butter warm and it also works great on corn on the cob!!

This was good but not great.  It didn't do anything spectacular to the meat--the fact is you can slather almost anything in garlic butter and make it taste better.

Fantastically yummy. Spring for a good center cut sirloin and don't skimp on the garlic. This steak was really good. Even my five-year-old agreed to put the ketchup away--it was that good.

This steak was wonderful!! The only thing I did differently was rub it with some meat tenderizer seasoning and let it sit out for about a half hour. Other than that, I just scaled it down to 4 servings and put it on the George Foreman Grill because we don't have an outdoor one. Cooked it for 5 minutes and it was perfect! Great flavor, thanks for recipe!

OMG, finger licking good.  I use kosher salt and salt my steak for about 20 mins (depending on thickness) before I grill.  Right before grilling I wash it off well so it is not too salty.  I read this on a website which said it would tenderize the steak and it has not let me down yet.  I know some people say it will make the steak dry but it has always turned out tender and juicy for me.  This garlic butter was the icing on the cake.  Delish!!!

Let me start by saying that I do not usually eat steak. I normally don't like it at all. The men in my family love steak so I decided to cook this for them. I have to say, it smelled so good after I put the garlic butter on it, I had to try a piece. I am hooked! Very tasty! We ALL enjoyed it. Definitely a keeper!

Ummm...  okay.  For me, the flavor was just ok.  I basted it with the garlic butter while grilling and then did a final brushing of it when it was done.  Tender, juicy... no real "flavor", though.  My husband LOVED it because he prefers his meat "natural", without marinades or too much seasoning, so the taste was exactly what he was looking for.  If you're a "Traditional" steak eater, this is the way to go!

Loved this!  I made with filet mignon.  Instead of brushing the tops when ready to serve with the butter mixture, I basted the filets with the butter mixture while they were on the grill.  Thank you Solana!

We thought this was good.  It didn't wow me, but the butter and the garlic really did taste very good with the meat.  I will most probably be making this again.  Thanks for posting this.

This was very good.  You must be a garlic lover though.  I served it with mashed potatoes and broccoli.  My husband and daughter couldn't get enough.

Rather than grilling, I broiled the steaks.  I may not have put enough of the sauce on the steaks, but they were DELICIOUS anyway.  My husband claimed it was better than any steak he had eaten in a restaurant.  I will definitely make this again.

Yummy!  Really yummy tasting sauce.  Added garlic powder and minced garlic and unsalted butter to pan. Then put salted n peppered petite sirloin steak in pan. Added a shake of Olde's Thompson Steak & Burger Seasoning and a shake of McCormick's Grill Mates Montreal Steak on steak.  Cooked on medium for five minutes each side.  So delicious, moist & juicy!

I rarely rate recipes because I usually change things in them and I don't feel that it is fair to rate it if I change something.  I made this exactly like the recipe says and it was amazing and simple.

I loved this recipe! When the weather is bad we cook our steaks in the oven on broil for 8 to 10 minutes on each side, depending on how thick the steak is.Love the butter/garlic taste! Fran From Spain.

Pretty darn tasty! Usually I cook sirloins for my family and they end up kinda bland! Even when I put spices and such on them! Usually I sprinkle some garlic salt on the steaks and then cook, but I have grown tired of the bland taste, so I googled how to make a better steak and found this! The one difference is that I broiled the steaks, but they turned out great!

Tremendous steakhouse restaurant taste. I'm an outdoor grilling junkie but when the snow hits, I'm inside and this is a great indoor substitute. I followed the ingredients to a T but I took some of the preparation suggestions I saw in reviews. #1 I caramelized the fresh garlic clove in a pat of butter. This smoothed out the garlic taste overall. #2 I allowed the butter to cool into a paste and smoothed it on the warm steak after. It kept it on the steak where it belongs instead of hot on hot which puts it on the plate. I should add that I used a cast iron grill on the stove for these 1.5" top sirloin filets and it took me closer to 5-6 minutes per side and I covered it for the final minutes to get a beautiful med-rare. It's not a healthy recipe but it's a very good one. I'll use it on occasion for sure.

I don't usually buy sirloin steak, but my local warehouse store had fresh bulk packages on sale for a really good price, so I went ahead and got some. This recipe is really great. I did take the suggestion that another reviewer made, and I sauteed the minced garlic in about 2 Tbsp of butter just until caramelized, then I removed from head and added the additional butter and stirred until it was all melted together. I also decreased the garlic powder by half and just added in an additional clove of fresh. I served these with broccoli and some awesome Ore-Ida Simply Wedges Garlic & Herb potatoes and it made a wonderful dinner that I will definitely make again.

Used this tonight with tenderloin steaks.  Some lessons here.  Many recipes advise against using salt before cooking - worked just fine thanks.  I've always done steaks 2 1/2 minutes per side and then 2 1/2 minutes per side again.  The idea of a 1/4 turn for the nice grilling cross sears was simple yet effective.  Only change to the recipe was a missing ingredient - garlic powder - so I substituted Club House Garlic Plus seasoning (from Costco) and it turned out great!

There was one small problem.  I'm trying to eat less these days and the temptation to re-light the grill was almost irresistible.  :-)

The only change I made was to cook under the broiler.  Love the garlic and butter.  Served with Grilled Romaine on this site.  Very easy to prepare for one or as many as you need.

I made the entire butter sauce for 8 servings but only had a 1# sirloin...wanted some leftover butter sauce for some hamburger steaks tonight.  It was delicious.  Also added some well drained canned mushrooms to make it go further and that was good too.  I thought it would be too garlicky but it wasn't.  First class!!!  Update: made the hamburger steaks last night and hubby and I devoured!  He said I'd made those hamburger steaks taste like prime rib.  This recipe for the garlic butter wil become a frequent flyer in our kitchen!!!

The garlic butter was excellent. I grated the garlic cloves with a fine mesh grater for better consistency and more pronounced flavor. I used my own grilling method for grilling the steaks.

this was wll liked. I made it into a marinade by subsituting veggie oil for the butter and just doing it on the grill after marinating in the garlic oil. I was kinda afraid of using THIS much garlic....but it was fine in the end.

Delicious!
My modifications included baking instead of grilling, and during the last 10 minutes or so, I tossed in a handful of frozen veggies. This ones a keeper!

Sooo good and easy. We actually seasoned with seasoned salt and loved it. Letting it cook slow on the grill and rest is the most important step.

well I don't know if I would call this amazing.... I think this recipe is a really good fix if you over grill a steak and start to dry it out.... but I made mine medium so it was still juicey... the garlic flavor was good but too much unneeded butter... definately think it would work well saving a dried out steak though

very, very good :) my boyfriend works in a steakhouse and he was very impressed with this when I made it. I served mine with the oven roasted potatoes recipe on this site and a Greek salad :) it gave the whole meal a kind of Mediterranean feel! Will definitely make again!

Really jazzed up a lower cut of meat. Found out that we were out of steak sauce...didn't miss it a bit.  Will be putting this on my rib eyes, and T-bones.

I have to say that I was expecting a stronger taste and was disappointed when it wasn't there.  I made it for my boyfriends family and they all said they liked it...not sure if they were telling the truth though.  I would dial up the flavor by maybe adding some scallions, extra garlis, a little extra butter and a touch of heavy creme.

I made a ground chuck hamburger steak using the garlic butter sauce  adding a little dried chopped parsley to the mix for a little extra flavor and color but stayed the course on all measurements. This sauce was outstanding!!! I would and will use it on any cut of beef and am curious to try it on chicken. I pity the fool that doesn't give this a try!

I also loved this steak and to the Garlic and Butter I added some Braggs liquid amino. (you could also add soy sauce) thus cutting out salting the meat!

This recipe sounded scrumptious especially since I love butter and garlic.  I was a bit disappointed that I wasn't blown away at all.  Guess it's just not my cup of tea.

Very good! I didn't have time to fire up the grill so I cooked these in a pan (instead of my grill pan) in order to create the sauce in the same pan that the steaks cooked in. Tasted amazing! Thanks for the recipe. ETA: I have been cooking this steak for awhile now. It is great in a pan, on the grill and even in an oven bag cooked with the garlic butter in with the steak.

Very good for something quick to fix. I prepped my butter mixture early and chilled it in the fridge. I also pan fried mine with a little drizzle of evoo since the grill was out of gas and broiler wasn't working right. After pan frying, I left the steak in the pan and topped it with the chilled butter and rested.

Mmmm.... Garlic. I made a bit extra of the garlic butter to pour over broccoli & my 4 year old son actually asked for more broccoli! And the steak was excellent! Yum, yum, yum! I think I might lick the dishes clean tonight.... Tempted.

An instant classic!! Then with a little bernaise sauce, baked potato, salad and bread, sit back cause your in heaven! I used two T-Bones, and since we don't have a grill, I broiled them on HI for about 4 min on each side. Even the Bone was devoured by my boxer! Such a  Great recipe! my wonderful boyfriend loved it so much he had me share it with his grandmother & mother, I can't wait to make it again!!!

Absolutely delicious!!! I recommend the folling cooking instructions: 1- Tenderize the meat(use a press or a mallet and just pound it evenly) 2- cook/grill the steaks on a low heat (225-250 degrees) for 30 min to 2 hours depending on how you like your steak ( 30 min for rare, 2 hrs for well done). Finally, if you prefer a crispy texture on the outside, broil each side of your steak for 5 minutes or until crispy! If you are grilling with charcoal, be sure to have a section on the grill with a higher intensity heat, somewhere are the 550 degree mark. trust me when i say, this well be the most tender cut you have ever eaten!

We couldn't really tell the difference in taste. Maybe we were just expecting too much- plus it didn't help that I'd chosen tough steaks- I guess they were on sale for a reason!

I didn't see the big deal about this one. The butter mixture was great, but the steak just did not have enough flavor. Next time maybe I'll try doubling the sauce and baste during cooking...

We had a 2 lb top sirloin steak (salt and peppered it) that I grilled on the cast iron grill on the stove top.  Ten minutes each side, then let sit for 15 minutes (prior to cooking, left meat out for 45 minutes to bring to room temperature).  Cut the meat and then pour the butter sauce over.  Served with horseradish sauce and a Roquefort/butter chilled mixture.  People said the meat was good but needed the side sauces to add more flavor

THIS WAS AMAZING...I REALLY DIDN'T THINK THIS RECIPE WAS A BIG DEAL-I MEAN A LITTLE BUTTER AND GARLIC-I USE THAT ALL THE TIME, BUT OH MY GOODNESS, WAS I WRONG!!! AND DON'T CHANGE A THING IF YOU LIKE A NICE, SIMPLE STEAK. FABULOUS. WHO WOULD THINK BUTTER ON A STEAK? IT WAS WORTH THE EXTRA CALORIES!!MY KIDS GOBBLED IT UP! AND I'LL JUST RUN A FEW MORE MINUTES TOMORROW!!! DIDN'T EVEN NEED MY A1 STEAK SAUCE THAT I LOVE. A WONDERFUL CREATION!! AND IT COOKED A BEAUTIFUL, MED RARE ON THE GEORGE FOREMAN.

Delicious!Followed the recipe exactly except for 3 servings. Grilled medium -rare. Had enough leftover for next days Po-Boy sandwiches! UPDATE: Anyone who doesn't try this wonderful recipe is really missing a delicious dish! This marinade would probably be great on any kind of beef..maybe other meats, also.

Maybe I did something wrong?!  We usually love garlic, but it totally overpowered the meat in this recipe.  I will try again w/ a different cut of meat.  The sirloin I used last night wasn't the greatest....

I've made this SEVERAL times and it's a huge hit.  My friend tried and loved too.  It's so simple, it's ridiculous, but it makes us realize we've been over seasoning all these years.  This is very impressive and would serve this to company.  Just don't overcook!  Also, Sam's Wholesale Club has the awesome sirloin steak and it melts in your mouth with this recipe.  I did make it once with garlic that was rancid not knowing and of course, it was horrid.  Make sure your garlic is very fresh and you can also use Smart Balance butter and it's great.

Very, very tastey.  I was only doing 2 small steaks so I cut the recipe in half and added mushrooms to the mix.  It was very tastey.  Thanks for the recipe, Solana.  Oh, I used it on rib eyes.

Superb!! My hubby basted the grill pan with the garlic butter BEFORE cooking steaks...and also brushed them liberally with the garlic butter while cooking, then basted again with remaining butter sauce upon serving. They were moist and very flavorful. Thanks so much for this!!

This is a great dish. Sooo simple, Quick and Easy. With 3 children I dont have a lot of time to spend making food dishes, so Im always looking for ideas like this. I simply added a side salad with some red onions, and a drizzle of the Garlic Butter. Mwah, Excellent.

Nice recipe..I don't eat alot of Red Meat these days but have now collected 2-recipes that have steak as the main-ingredient..I think the garlic powder is a good idea/I usually just saute' 6-8 gloves until tender and smash them with a wooden utensil(into the butter)while still in the saute' pan..I might add the Butter/Garlic to some StringBeans/instead of brushing the steak..and pile the StringBeans atop the steak..try a cast iron fry pan for stove top searing(also)I use an old Pressure Cooker Pot for larger poultry searing..useing a Glass cover from some other pot I discarded long ago/I removed its handle so as to place in a 375-degree oven.

I used filet mignon with this recipe.  I seared it on a grill and then finished in the oven (10 minutes for medium).  The garlic butter sauce added a nice flavor.

We had boneless sirloin strips that had been in the fridge dusted with McCormicks Montreal Steak Seasoning overnight. After throwing them on the grill, I whipped up the garlic butter on a whim and spread it over the steaks during the 10 minute re-distribution time. Pretty good on the popovers I made to go with the steaks..will make again and again!

For some reason this recipe did not work for me. It just wound up to be a buttery steak with no real flavor. It's kind of like someone left out a really important element of this recipe. Oh well.

My husband complains constantly that he is not a "meat" person.  Last evening I prepared Sirloin with this recipe.  My two granddaughters were our guests.  They all raved about this steak including my hubby.  He even had a second helping.
The only comment I have is that it was too salty for my taste and that was probably because I used tenderizer on the steak and added salt.  Next time I will omit the salt before cooking.

This is great. Easy and delicious. We made steak
sandwiches using french bread that my husband
toasted on the grill while the meat was resting
for 3 minutes. Our 8 year old thought it was
good.The meat was so tender.

The garlic butter was such a nice way to finish off this steak.   I zapped my garlic butter in the microwave.....just enough to melt the butter and to bring out the garlic flavor.

Super duper easy to make.....but doesn't taste like it.   I made it on the stove top.....I didn't even use the type of pan that leaves grill marks, but it still looked great and tasted even better.

My family loves this recipe, I'm making it again for the 2nd time tonight. I put under a low broiler for 4-5 minutes each side and add sliced onions underneath the steaks.  I baste a couple times with the garlic butter. As someone else suggested, you do need to saute the garlic in a little butter until it's soft and cooked, then add in the remaining butter.  Delicious!

This was my first attempt at steak and it came out delicious! The butter was really easy to make (made ahead of time based on other reviews, with cooked gatlic, butter and parsley) and tastes soooo good on the steak and everything I served with it! definitely going to make this one again!

Instead of grilling, I pan fried the T-bone steaks in a little butter, also added mushrooms to the pan when the steak was almost done. Once both the mushrooms and steak  were cooked to the desired temp that is when I brushed the butter/ mixture to both. Nice change from just a steak with the ordinary steak sauce one might use.

It was delicious! I didn't have a grill, so I baked the steak in the oven instead and brushed with garlic butter when done. Served it with sautéed onions and cubed potatoes tossed in olive oil and baked with a sprinkle of salt and pepper. Family loved it, and I received lots of compliments. Will have to make again. :-)

Absolutely incredible.Made this with the Hasselback Potatoes and a vegetable medley.My wife and kids thought they were at a restaurant.Will do this again with friends!Only thing I did different was to use small ladle to cover the steak with the garlic butter mixture so to get more of the minced garlic on the steak,amazing!

It's always the easy ones that amaze me! I cut the recipe down to two servings and used a pestal and mortar to crush garlic with a big pinch of salt. Added the butter and garlic powder and crushed it all until it was well combined. Grilled my steaks as shown in the video (cross pattern and all), then smeared the butter on them while they rested. Great simple recipe for delicious sirloin.

Fairly straight forward recipe.  I used Ribeye rather than Sirloin, so I'm not sure the garlic butter was as appropriate.  Next time I will try the Sirloin.

Delicious. The garlic and butter gave a great flavour to the steak. Cooked and served exactly as written.

Cook your steak like you normally do. Simply add this at the end. I will definitely be using this in their future.

I have basically done this for years - but I add Worcester to it.  You can always adjust amount of ingredients to personal taste if this is too much garlic for you - it would be for me.

Add MORE minced garlic, and saute it SLOWLY to prevent it from burning. Add minced fresh parsley after taking it off the heat for a true French flair! Save any leftover (or make more) in ice cube trays or any other small container to have available as needed. It's Classic for the french to serve a pat of this butter on top of a steak in bistro's. eat and enjoy!

I'm not a chef by any stretch of the imagination and was looking for a recipe with ingredients I already had. This one was simple and looked tasty. I was a little worried about the amount of butter and garlic but once it was all done, it tasted amazing!! The only thing I did differently was I added salt and pepper to the garlic butter as well as using it to season the steaks. Great tasting, easy to make and quick!

Eh.  I normally love garlic, but this was too much.  I thought the garlic powder would enhance the garlicy flavor, but instead it gave it an off taste.  Would maybe make again, but minus the garlic powder.

This was delicious! We were arguing over who got to have the leftovers - which I took and they were still tender. ;)  However, though I rather rate a recipe on it's own merit, I have to say I did combine this with  Best Steak Marinade in Existence
Best Steak Marinade in Existence here on AR. Great combination.

Used this more as "inspiration". Finely chopped about 10 cloves of garlic, added a few sprigs of thyme, and a stick of organic butter before I simmered on medium low for a bit. Seared some sirloins in a super hot pan and then let rest, sliced, and simmered in the garlic butter until medium. Added some steamed broccoli and served over boiled red potatoes. Amazing!!!

This was good. We put salt and pepper on the steaks and let them sit at room temperature for about an hour, then cooked them in a cast iron pan. I might make double the sauce next time to get a little more flavor, but it was easy and tasty.

This steak was awesome.  I am a garlic lover and this was one of the best steaks I have ever tasted.
I used " I Cant Believe It's Not Butter" as I didn't have any butter on hand and this was still delicious.

I made this just as the recipe is written, except I grilled it in a grill pan on the stove instead of a BBQ outstide.  I just didn't really like it...I love butter and garlic, but this didn't work for me.  I will save the butter and garlic for shrimp or crab.

Very good, I would cut back one or two garlic cloves though.

I made this the other night and I thought it tasted good. The Garlic butter sauce was really good so I doubled it. I think it would be much better if the garlic butter was made into scoops to be placed on the meat rather than melted.

I have been making this recipe for years. The only difference is I grill a London Broil and slice it really thin. I then put the slices over a piece of toasted french and top with some of the garlic butter. So yummy!

Yum-O! Made this tonight per the instructions. It made our home-cooked steaks taste outstanding... and all I cooked them on was an indoor grill. It couldnt be any easier to make. This is definite keeper.

I use a compound garlic butter for just about everything. My wife and I love garlic, this garlic butter not only is good on steaks, pasta, vegtables, garlic bread. It is so versatile, use one stick of butter (non salted) with five galic cloves crushed in a garlic press, some kosher salt,chopped parsley, pepper and you have a wonderful spread.

These steaks turned out delicious!!  I softened the butter and mixed the garlic into it.  Then I put a small scoop of garlic butter on top of each steak after removing them from the grill and let it melt in.  Yummy!!  My kids loved it too!  Definitely try this recipe!  You won't be disappointed!

I followed the recipe exactly and I have to say that I'm not sure why people raved about it so much. I didn't find it very flavorful or delicious. It wasn't the worst thing I've ever made, but I won't be trying it again.

This was good.  To jazz up my steak even more I sprinkled parmesan cheese to the top of my steak after the butter had melted.  Then I cooked two mushrooms in about a tbsp of the butter to eat with the steak.  YUMMY!

I made this after school for my family. It was too cold outside so i used a George foreman grill. The steaks turned out really tender and juicy. Also i added some grated parmesan cheese to the butter sauce.

Excellent recipe!  It was rather cold today, so I scored the steaks in a criss-cross pattern and cooked them in a skillet on the range.  Rather than melt the butter, I used Parkay and mixed the garlic powder and minced cloves at room temperature.  As soon as the steaks came off the range, I put a dollop of butter on each one and let the butter melt.  It was WONDERFUL!!!  I also kept one steak in reserve and put in a oven-safe dish, placed a dollop the butter mixture on top, then covered the dish w/ heavy duty aluminum foil.  I placed it on the bottom rack in the oven, then broiled it for about 10 minutes (less if you like it less done).  The butter has soaked into the scores and throughout the steak.  I liked it better in the oven than the other way...

Very good. I wound up cooking it for over 20 minutes. Since my oven is brand new I doubt it's the source of the problem. Put the meat on the second level from the heating element, any higher and it would have been right into the element itself (I checked). But all in all a decent recipe that qualifies as a keeper.

Great recipe! Will make again! So juicy and succulent! My husband loved it, he couldn't eat it fast enough. We love garlic and butter so it was perfect. I usually can't finish a whole steak but OMG I killed the whole thing! Will make again! Thanks for sharing.

It was raining, so I decided to broil my steak instead of grilling it.    I did one steak at 5 minutes per side and it came out medium.  The steak was about 12oz and I trimmed most of the fat off before cooking it as I was worried about this being too rich with all he butter.    Used 2 tbsp butter, about 2 tsp of garlic salt and 2 large cloves of garlic.  I didn't use any additional salt because of the garlic salt and forgot to add pepper until I had eaten half of the steak.  The pepper helped a bit.  It turned out decent.  I should have cooked the steak a little longer.  The butter/garlic was a bit bland, but I should point out that I'm a garlic nut and usually overdo it.  Next time, I plan to try some additional seasoning like Montreal Steak, which I should state that I also have a tendency to overdo.  Overall, this recipe is quick and tasty.  I have two more steaks in the fridge and I'll definitely be giving this another shot soon...

Cooked as instructed, but only had 3 lbs of top sirloin.  Grandson and hubby both ate it up - hubby without his usual A-1 and that says a lot.  Thanks for sharing.

I was not impressed with this recipe at all.  The butter really wasn't that noticeable on the meat and the garlic was much too pungent to be on the meat alone.

Simply Amazing. A wonderful way to start Fathers day this year. Suggestion- chop one whole green onion and stir in with butter and garlic over low heat. I thought the garlic serving was perfect, some may find it a little strong, just adjust it!

I give this 3 stars due to the cut of meat wasn't the best. This may be much better on say a strip steak or a nicer cut of meat other than sirloin steak. The garlic butter topping was good. I love love love garlic but this was even a bit much for my taste.

I fried the garlic in the butter for a little while, stirring constantly, because I like that flavor. This was excellent, not at all like the way we usually eat steak (covered in A-1, as a general rule), and super simple to do. The leftover butter was great to dip our asparagus in! Thanks, we'll make this one again :)

I thought this was just OK...nothing special. I cooked my steak on our outdoor gas grill, let it rest and then poured the butter/garlic mixture on top. It was hard for me to taste the butter sauce. Not sure what I did wrong? I've tried it twice with same results both time.

This recipe is awesom.  We have a hard time grilling steaks without overcooking.  This seems almost fool proof that it will   Still be tender.  I tenderized the meat with Montreal seasoning before grilling .

No need for plain old steak when you're in a hurry. Got some cheap steaks on special at the grocery, and this recipe seriously improved them. Since I live in an NYC apartment, no grill, so I put them under the broiler. The scampi sauce is terrific.

I haven't cooked much steak for my family.  I decided to try this because it sounded easy and good. This was fantastic! When your in the mood for beef this is a quick and easy way to make it. I pan fryed it instead of grilling but it was still very good. Sirloin has some chew but we love it!

Very simple and decadent flavors! It's only good to eat right off the grill while the sauce is warm. It feels a little different as leftovers but still good flavors.

This was really yummy!  I added a few of the French's Fried Onions to the top of each filet, and that was a really nice touch.  I broiled my steak, and it came out really tasty with the butter.  Enjoy!

The garlic butter sauce was perfect and so easy to get a steak house dish in a short time with a lot less money and I think more, better taste.

We have made this a few times now and the steaks are always awesome this way! Just be cautious, if you decide to try basting the steaks with the sauce while grilling watch out for flare ups!!!

Oh. My. God. Hands down, the best steak I've ever made myself, and definitely up there with the best steaks I've had. I only had garlic salt on hand, so it was a bit salty, but I know it will be killer with garlic powder instead. I scaled down the recipe for 2 steaks (petite filets, but they were seriously on sale!) and used 1/4 c. butter and 3-4 cloves of garlic finely crushed. I sprinkled some pepper and garlic salt on the steaks before putting them on the grill, and grilled them to about medium. Definitely give them some time to rest and soak up the yummy garlicky flavor! Served with baked potatoes and green beans... yummmmmm!

This was awesome!  I seasoned the steaks with Kansas City Steak Company Steak and Prime Rib seasoning before grilling.  I basted the steaks while grilling with part of the butter mixture (to which I added fresh parsley).  The remaining butter I melted on the steaks when they were done cooking.

So good!!! I used both ribeye and bone-in ribeye steaks. The extra marbling is wonderful with garlic butter. Have cooked on mesquite coals and sautéed in the stove both methods work well. Of course grilling outside is preferred. Pool party guest never complain getting this awesome meal. "Hot in Vegas"

I followed other reviewers suggestions, but all in all there weren't a lot of changes made.  I rubbed the steaks with rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper, and let them sit for a bit.  I also brushed the steaks with the butter mix while grilling, I followed the recipes directions for applying as well after they were done grilling.  Honestly I didn't taste much flavor of anything on the steaks, they were just greasy from the butter, though they looked good.  I wasn't impressed with the flavor and will stick to lemon pepper and garlic salt on my steaks after that bland meal.

I made this tonight for dinner and it turned out great!! I seared as someone else suggested (husband wasnt home to cook on the grill lol) then I added my own touch and took out the steaks leaving drippings in pan, added a little flour and butter, milk, water and a bit of worchestire sauce to make yummy gravy (add ingredients slowly and a little at a time simmering and stirring the whole time) then threw the steaks back in, this tendered them up (sirloin is usually tough) and everyone LOVED!!

Loved it.  I had to cook it in two batches and the first batch was gone before I finished the second batch.  Didn't use garlic powder.  Just added extra garlic.

Not too bad. I melted the butter in a pan then added the minced garlic and then added the steaks. I turned them over once to coat both sides of the steaks. Then I added garlic powder onion powder salt and pepper. Thanks for the great recipe!

Wow - I was surprised that something so simple could be so tastey.  But then you could problably add a pat of butter to just about anything and have it taste better!

I can't bleive how far I had drifted from the basic process of grilling a steak.  This brought me back.  No more rubs and special seasoning for me.  I cooked one 8 oz sirloin filet 5 minutes per side - excellent!

The garlic butter was very delicous. Except, I seared the steaks on the stove, but they still came out quite juicey. Instead of plain garlic powder, I used Garlic salt because I love salt. i know it's not healthy but I put less on the steaks and more garlic salt in the butter mixture. And instead of finely chopped garlic, I grated the garlic cloves. It lets out a bit more garlic juice. My husband loved the garlic and steak combo. YUMO!

This didn't have a lot of butter or garlic flavor.  Just a greasier piece of meat.  My husband was disappointed because he got so excited over the amount of garlic and than it became just another piece of meat.

Very good! This gave our cheap steak great flavor.  I broiled our steaks on HI in the oven and was really concerned about them drying out, which I tend to do. This garlic butter gave them great taste and made them nice and juicy.  I will use this recipe quite often when I grill/broil steaks.  Thanks!

Nice flavor, fairly tender and super simple. I was looking for something not too complicated for steak since for some reason I always overcook it and it turns out dry and tough. Since I don't have a grill I just used my broiler. I cooked them a little longer because we don't care for much red in our meat but I managed to not overcook! I'm making it again tonight!

This was the best steak we have ever cooked at home. I used t-bones and (real)salted butter (Sshhh, don't tell my hubby, he doesn't like real butter)and minced garlic instead of powdered. Mouthwatering! I served this with strawberry-romaine salad and baked asparagus with balsalmic butter. Delish! We ate til we were stuffed and then kept eating, it was sooooo good.

Was NOT impressed!  I wonder what restaurants some of the others have eaten at to say that this recipe is "as great as" because it was nothing but buttery steak and garlic....?  No where near enough flavor for me.  Was toooo boring.

I am not a red meat fan (except for ground beef).  Given that, I think I am biased.  I was expecting a "melt in your mouth" flavor, but didn't experience that at all.  In my opinion, these steaks were not seasoned well enough (kinda bland).  I don't think I'll make these again, but will definitely prepare the garlic butter mixture to pour on fresh steamed broccoli. Thanks.

Excellent!  Really gave a great flavor to the steak!  I broiled them and they were wonderful!  I have also used this recipe for pork steak and it comes out just as good--we didn't even need a knife to cut the pork, it was so tender!  Great recipe!!

I made these last night and oh yummy yummy. I know there are a lot of extra calories with the butter but when you taste these you don't care. This would be could on a filet mignon or a ribeye!

Good steak, would like to try on filet. Boyfriend said it was better than any steak he's had in a restaurant lately. Did them on my Foreman, topped 'em with Pat's Mushroom Saute from this site, very tasty!

Very good. Used it on ribeyes, but DH thinks it will work better on sirlion. It kind of changed the taste of the ribeye.

A very fine recipe!  I was thinking at first that the sauce didn't compare to A-1.  But the more I ate of it, and I put more of it on the second piece, the better it tasted.  A worthy competitor to A-1.

I used this as an additional flavor after marinating the steaks in some gourmet sauce.  It turned out wonderful.  The garlic butter was a great addition and made the steaks melt in your mouth wonderful.

This definitely made a cheap cut of meat much tastier but I have to go against the grain and give it a 3 - taste like garlic and butter on a steak.  Guess my expectation was made very high by the number of five star ratings.

This was wonderful.  I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it was so tasty.  I have never cooked sirloin steak before and found this recipe and decided to give it a try.  This steak was gone ~ not even a chance for leftovers!  Bravo!  Excellent job!

I can't say that this steak turned out as well as I had hoped it would. It wasn't as tender as I had expected. But my neighbor was here for dinner with his two sons and he certainly liked it and even went back for second and third helpings. And all 3 of the boys ate it. My husband doesn't care for steak and wouldn't even try it.

Very easy to make and a delicious finisher for steaks.  I made sure to put some on each side prior (a couple minutes) to taking it off of the grill, which aided in sealing in the flavor and juices.

I made it and we loved it! We used petite sirloin steaks because they were the perfect serving size for 2. Grilled on both sides for ~5 mins on just half of our grill. Quick and easy!

I caramelized the garlic in the butter and it ended up as tasty crunchy bits.  It was a nice change from what we normally do with steak.

I don't review recipes,  but this was so good I thought I would. I let the steaks sit out for a little while. I salted, peppered, and added Food City (store brand) steak/ burger seasoning. I grilled them. Spooned some garlic butter over them and let them rest a few minutes. They tasted like a $20 restaurant steak. I did use New York Strip  in place or sirloin.

this was wonderful... although I since I don't have a grill, I used the broiler on my oven.  My roommate enjoyed them as much as he did the one we had in a restaurant... actually said that he could have it more often now that we have a way of making it at home.

Enjoyed the meal, the recipe was changed a bit because I didn't have some ingredents, but I stuck to the recipe on the most part, just add a bit too much garlic. But it was a good meal for dinnertime.

This was a great recipe. The flavor was good and probably have been even better if I would have added the garlic powder, I forgot it. My steak was a little tough but I think it was because I cooked it a little to long. I used an indoor grill. I will try it again and see if I can get it right the next time. Quick and easy though.

This marinade & butter recipe ruined my steak.  Ugh!  The apple cider vinegar marinade was awful.  Ever heard of clarified butter?  That's what should have been done instead of simply melting butter so you could drip fat onto an already horribly marinated steak.  Never again!

This recipe makes steaks so good. It's one you want to follow exactly. Many times  I have left a part out and it did not turn out as good as it is when everything is followed exactly. Great flavor. Tastes like a restaurant steak and is my go-to when making steaks now.

I followed the recipe to the dot and it was surprising how good it turned out! Next time I think adding an ounce of lemon juice will really top it off.

Great flavor and easy to do. Next time, though, I'll simmer the garlic and butter longer - I didn't let it go long enough to get the full flavor, but it was sure good!

I pan fried to medium rare after 8 min on each side in an 250!degree oven, sautéed the garlic (I use jarred fresh minced), and sprinkled some Montreal steak seasoning into the garlic butter - YUM!

I absolutely loved it and so did my family. I fried the steak in a cast iron skillet five minutes each side and based the steak with the butter & garlic sauce. Also had mashed potatoes which my husband used the sauce left in the skillet from frying the steak to go over the potatoes. Great  recipe and easy to do.

This was an excellent recipe! I didn't use the grill, instead I seared the steak on the stove top in a little olive oil and finished it in the oven wrapped in foil. The only change I will make next time is use a little less butter (and not for vanity purposes) only because I had a lot of butter that I poured out after the steak was finished cooking. I have no complaints about this recipe, it was delicious!

It was delicious! I baked the steak instead and added frozen broccoli to the pan. The broccoli also had a nice garlic-y flavor as well. Two mins before it was done baking, I added Parmesan cheese and let it bake to make a crust-

My family loved it and it brought amazing flavor to the steak how ever I did add some things to the recipe such as red pepper flakes, thyme, parsley  and fresh ground black pepper and allowed the spices and butter to sit at room temp for three hours to blend the flavors.

I seared the steak on stove top. It would probably be better to season with salt, pepper and garlic powder and then finish with the butter mixed with minced garlic.

This recipe was simple and delicious.  I will definitely make it again however, I will reduce the time on the grill.  4 minutes each side was medium well done and we like a good steak medium rare.  I'm sure each grill cooks differently and the thickness of the steaks would factor in as well.  YUMMY!

This was a little bland for my taste.  I changed it a bit. I marinated it in Dells seasoning and then gave it a good sprinkling of Everglades Seasoning  before  hit the charcoal with it. ... It was nice.

I've been making this for years. The only difference is that I place the steak on toast points. Fantastic!

It was so good! I cook my steaks inside in cast iron. The second time I decided to add a couple table spoons of Worcestershire sauce and a teaspoon of liquid smoke.

I pan fried instead of grilled, tastey but a bit heavy in the butter probably becuase I didnt adjust it down for 2 pounds. This is great for a quick quality entree on a weeknight.

This was wonderful, better than going out to eat and much less expensive. I used two ribeyes about 1 1/4 inch thick. Sprinkled with kosher salt and black pepper then grilled to medium rare. Spooned the garlic butter over them and let rest for a few minutes. OMG is all I can say. Also, used a little of the garlic butter to saute some fresh yellow squash and zuccini for a yummy side. Will be making again. Thanks !!

This really isn't my favorite steak recipe at all.  I think the raw garlic is too much for my palette. I wasn't able to use my grill so I had to broil the steak and this may have definitely changed the flavor, but you still use the raw garlic butter no matter how you prepare the steaks.  I don't think we'll make this one again.

WOW! I'd like to start this off by saying...this is the first steak that I have ever grilled in my life, but I got a perfectly cooked steak that everyone loved. My sister who hates steak had seconds, and my father-in-law, (who usually eats my food without saying much)said it was one of the best steaks that he had ever had.

Kinda boring but if you are going with a minimal flavor sauce that doesn't over power the meat than this will work. Again though, kinda boring. Coming out of my recipe box.

This was so simple and delicious! Followed kitchen notes in magazine to season w/ 1/4 tsp. each salt and pepper per steak, grilled on high 4 min. per side, poured all that lovely garlic butter over it all, and yum!

I didn't like the garlic powder in it. The garlic powder gives it a odd taste and WAY too strong. I ended up just leaving it out and using a couple more cloves of fresh garlic. My family loves it and I also put the garlic butter on grilled corn and mashed potatoes.

Made exactly as directed, but added a pinch of salt since I used unsalted butter.  Strong garlic flavor, but I really like garlic.  Will make this again!

I tried this recipe tonight for dinner.  I don't have a B.B.Q either so I coated the steaks with the garlic butter and seared it for about 2 min. per side for a thinner steak. I also added lots of fresh parsley to the garlic butter. Yum!

I used filet mignon (I had it on hand) and maybe I'm a purist, but it was just too much garlic.  My husband liked it, though.

Thanks for sharing this recipe. My family loved it so much that we had it for dinner two nights in a row! It felt like we were eating a restaurant meal. The garlic butter sauce was amazing. Packed with so much flavor yet so simple.

Very good, I was a little worried about 1/2 a cup of butter, but it was the right proportions for us. Buttery, garlicly, flavorful but not too overpowering. Even put some of the garlic butter on the baked potatoes we made, delicious. Thanks!

We really enjoyed these. They were super easy and tasted like restaurant quality to me. I served mine with the Grilled Shrimp Scampi and a baked potato for a nice surf n' turf style dinner. I even put the garlic butter on my baked potato...talk about decadent! I would definitely give these a try if you are looking for a great steak that's easy and affordable to put  together.

I have to start with, I'm a huge garlic and butter fan, who isn't?  I have a stand up freezer devoted to a full cow that we buy annually and another freezer for venison, hence, I like meat.   I made this meal last night for my family using, T-bone, ribeye, and a butterflied venison strap.  To myself and my family, we felt that is was overkill with garlic and could have used a little something like fresh ginger or sage to go with the sauce.

We have cooked steaks on the grill like this since I was a kid. Only difference is we do not use a pan, and we put the butter sauce on the steak while it's cooking. Ribeye steaks are wonderful using the butter sauce on the grill.

The garlic butter is so easy and tastes terrific, and would be great on any steak! We had corn on the cob and used it on the corn as well, and it was scrumptious! I'll surely be making this again and again.

Liked it, but the garlic took over the steak.  Next time less garlic.  It did make the steak taste great.

This is the best steak I've ever had (even including some steaks I've ordered at restaurants). It's also a real life saver when you have a steak that needs some kind of marinade or seasoning to really pop, but you haven't planned ahead and need something fast and flavorful.

I have made this recipe several times, the only difference was that I sliced the steak in thin strips and served over a slice of toasted French bread drizzled with the garlic butter. I also used minced garlic. For the side dishes I made roasted garlic mashed potato's and some grilled asparagus. A home run every time. If the sirloin is not on sale, a London Broil will work as well. I marinate my London broil for 4 days in the frig with minced garlic and Worcestershire. So yummy.

We enjoyed this recipe. I cooked in cast iron on the stove top... it wasn't quite "garlicky" enough for me. I thought it needed a little more seasoning and not quite so much butter. (I used frozen whole garlic cloves and not fresh, and am sure that impacted the garlic "bite" though!)

I made this last night and my husband and I both loved it!  I cooked mine on the stove in a cast iron pan and it came out perfect! When he saw what I was doing cause usually I do use the BBQ, he told me to stick with what you know.  After he tasted it he said, dang you can step out of the box anytime:)

This was 5 star delicious.  I used filet mignon, 350' grill, lightly brushed with olive oil and a little Goode's Mesquite rub, three minutes on each side. Melted about a tbls. of the chilled butter mixture over each resting steak.  I did not used the garlic powder, just minced garlic and added a little chopped cilantro.
 The remaining butter mixture was then melted down and used for a dipping sauce with added grilled shrimp.
You've got to try this one, it pays off!

I cooked this recipe in the oven as I didn't have a grill. Reading the other comments I altered the recipe by seasoning my 1 pound steak with salt & pepper. Searing it in a pan on a stove to give it some color. I popped the steak in the oven with the garlic butter and some mushroom & covered it in foil & baked at 425 for 25 min. My steak turned out dry and tasteless. The garlic butter in the deep baking pan was a soup (also not very tasty). So, I took the steak out and prepared some more garlic butter to pour on top. The garlic butter filled the house with a lovely smell, but I really couldn't taste the garlic on the steak. If I had grilled the steak, it probably would have tasted better, but I still didn't care for the sauce.

You definately need to use a good cut of beef and while this is not for those of us who are watching our calories it is still very tasty.

Good dish. It was too cold to grill outside so I did everything to the T accept ad adobo and bake it in the oven. I'm sure grilled it will be waaay better. I will rate again when I do so. Over all still good!

Tasted good! The steak didn't have much flavor with just salt and pepper. My husband and I loved the the garlic sauce, but my kids didn't like it.

I used a ribeye as I'm not a big fan of sirloin because of the lack of flavor.  Maybe I will try it with this sauce though because it was great.  You have to love garlic (which I do).  Make sure to get a good cut of meat as it doesnt do anything to flavor the actual meat.

This recipe was so easy and delicious.  I was very surprised the steaks were super juicy.... I will make them again for sure! I used garlic butter that you buy already made because I had some in the fridge  but added some chopped garlic from the jar. YUMMY

This was delicious. The only change I made was I had to broil it indoors rather than on a grill but it turned out perfectly fine which is good to know since grilling isn't always a first choice if the weather is against you! It got two thumbs up from every single picky eater including one who won't generally touch a steak because of 'how boring, tough, chewy, dry...' or put in any other negative word often associated with poorly done steak here. So...yum!

Very quick and easy! We ate it nearly as soon as it came off the grill instead of letting it sit haha. Very tender and nice flavor, will probably add a little more pepper to give it more of a kick next time.

This is the best steak I have ever had.  It was so tender and juicy!  Made it rare in our toaster oven in substitution of grilling.  I will make this every time I have steak available!

Lovely recipe. I used a Angus strip lion, sprinkled it with a generous amount of sea salt and a pinch of fresh ground black pepper. I let the steak sit for an hour to reach room temperature. I made the garlic butter as directed. I Threw the steak on the grill and used my I-steak application. The steak came out perfect. I brushed the steak with the garlic butter and let it stand for approx 5 minutes. Every bite was delicious.      This recipe has quickly became on of our family's faves. Thank you so much for posting this. :)

I really enjoyed the steak. I used the garlic in the jar, I think it tastes better than the fresh garlic.. seems more marinated. It was really good.I pan fried think T-bone steaks for 2-3 mins on both sides.  I tried cooking it in the garlic butter sauce also. That was good, not a significant difference,  but make sure you dont burn the garlic.  I have cooked it twice last week and I am going to the store for more steaks!!!

OMG! I made this today for my husbands birthday dinner and he couldn't stop complimenting me about the 'cut of meat'.  It was the same T bone we always have. lol.  He was surprised to find out about the garlic butter!   I also made roasted broccoli and roasted yukon gold potatoes and drizzled the garlic butter on those and finished with some grated fresh parmesean!  It was an awesome meal with an ice cream cake for dessert. This is definitely my new 'go to' way of grilling steak!

Tasted like garlic powder.  I would cut out the garlic powder and cost go with just the minced garlic next time and allow some of the butter taste to come through.

I'm not a fan of sirloin steak, but still made this for my husband...he said he would give it five stars after the first bite.  I will definitely be trying out with new york strips soon!

The steak was nice and juicy, although I don't think it's a meal that I will make again.

Very good. I hadn't really done much grilling with sirloin steak before but this was tasty. Made it several times this summer.

My husband and I love this recipe!  We like the outside of our steak a little on the black side, so the butter adds a nice moisture to it.

This was a good garlic butter, but maybe try it with a different cut of steak next time.

I picked up the top sirloin from Costco they were almost 2" inches thick. I found this to be too thick when other guests requested well done, no matter how charred the outside was, inside it was still bloody runny. I think this will work a lot better next time when I use thinner cut top sirlons.  Also I find that if I didn't marinate it with sprite at least overnight it wasn't tender. I will try dr. pepper overnight marination next time to make it tender.

I added a tiny bit of parsley for color. This was so good. It actually brought out more steak flavor than just plain. Excellent. I think I'll do this now every time we have steak.

We used this with some nice ribeye's we got for Father's Day. It was such a treat and My dad said it was his favorite steak he'd eaten! We also use a little bit of sea salt and pepper.

This was very good on sirloin steak. I found the topping perfect for corn on the cob and the baked potatoes as well.

Simple and delicious! I don't have a grill, so I used a broiler pan in the oven. It took just a minute or two more on each side. I left out the garlic powder as I used 4 LARGE cloves of fresh garlic. After the 3 minutes, I brushed off most of the garlic and the flavor was still plentiful. I don't eat much red meat, but I will use this again. Thanks!

This was good,I used a Eye of Round thin steak and I didn't put as much garlic cloves as suggessted so it wasn't a strong garlic taste. But it was still a good steak. Thanks.

Nice and easy and good - I was using the broiler and I was afraid the steak might get a bit dry while cooking so I let it marinate in Worcestershire Sauce for 20 minutes before cooking it and then applied the Garlic Butter as recipe suggested.  It was delicious.  Thanks submitter.

I may have done something wrong because when I melted the butter and added the garlic it seemed a bit watery. It might have been the type of butter I used. STill, the steaks turned out very tender and a mild but good flavor.

Bland.  Okay if you don't want much flavoring to your steak (or if you have a very tender cut of steak).

I was a great concept and may have been better to make the garlic butter and put it in the fridge and then cut it to melt back on the steaks while still hot.  This just didnt have a good flavor for us.  Will not be making again.

Was excellent a big hit with the family.  Need to keep the garlic butter sauce on the stove at all times on low heat to keep the garlic powder from coagulating in the pan.  Will make this again for sure.

I've tried this recipe 2x and both times was disappointed.  There wasn't much flavor which was surprising because it sounded good.  It ruined good sirloin steaks.  I won't try this again.

This was just average. That being said, I feel this recipe has a lot of potential. It just needs a little something more...maybe some thyme or province de herbs. I'm not quite sure - I would have to experiment a little more with it.

I just use whatever cut of steak and marinade at least one day (I use tenderizer, worcestershire, and garlic powder).  I make the butter just as the recipe reads and let sit, etc.  It makes your steak so tender you don't even really need a knife.  Absolutely fantastic!!

this was good, but not extravagant per other reviews. my steak was a little dry, and i was expecting juicy. i even basted the steak with the garlic butter while it was cooking and poured it over the top. good recipe my steak was just a little tough.

This was very easy and tasty. I cooked it on a griddle and it turned out great! The only thing I would change is to put a little less garlic and a little more butter in the sauce.

Extremely tasty! I wasn't a huge fan of brushing melted butter all over the steaks, but they were definitely worth it! I loved the garlic flavor. We had to use an indoor grill because it was snowing outside, but I'm sure they would taste even better on an outdoor grill.

I use this recipe alot. I baste my sirlion steaks on the grill. The meat stays moist and the taste is excellent. I will continue to use this recipe over and over.. To add a little more flavor I grill my onions and peppers with the butter mixture in aluminum foil and put on top of steak when finished.

I really liked the flavor. It wasn't "too" much. I thought it was great. I also sprinkled garlic powder on before I grilled. I only used 1/4C butter and just eyed the garlic. We really liked it a bunch. Thanks for the keeper!!

I thought this turned out great.  I did omit the fresh garlic and heated butter, garlic powder, onion powder mixed with a little steak seasoning in microwave, then poured over steak when it was done.  Turned out very good and very fattening.  Thanks for the post.

I have always preferred my steaks cooked in butter (people used to think I was weird...good to see it's spreading  ;o) ). Hubby cooked these inside on a grill pan starting w/ frozen steaks to help keep them juicy.

This is our favorite new grilled steak recipe.  The butter was sooo decadent, but, oh gosh, it made our dinner!  I ran out of real garlic while preparing the potato side, so I sprinkled the steaks with creole seasoning and added it to the butter and garlic powder (and microwaved to melt!).

Great recipe...we ate with Garlic Linguine and Asparagus, yummy!  Steaks got a little crispy due to higher heat and pepper...but even with that the garlicky-butter made up for it.  Highly recommend.

What's not to like? Garlic, butter, and good steak.
We enjoyed this recipe.

This was a winner for everyone at our house.  I was a bit leery using butter, it's just not common, but it worked well with the garlic.  I served it with a potato casserole from this site and green beans.  Good eats!

This is OK if you're cooking in a hurry and don't have time to marinate, but I didn't find it all that spectacular.  And if you've built up a tolerance to spicy food, it's not strong at all.  Maybe if the meat were scored before putting the sauce on, it would be more flavorful?  Anway, it's not bad, just nothing to write home about.

I really liked the flavor of the steak so I'll give it 5 stars for the recipe but my steak turned out somewhat tough.  I have never been an expert steak griller so I won't hold it against this recipe.  I didn't find the sauce too overpowering like some of the other reviews.

I made this with the Cheddar and Bacon Mashed Potatoes recipe and poured a little of the prepared juice into the potatoes and it really added a little kick.
