I make this recipe every Christmas and everyone loves it.  I do something SLIGHTLY different though -I drain the pineapple and mash the bananas with the pineapple.  The gelatin will congeal better that way.  Pecans are really good in it too!

If you're a "jello salad person", you will love this.  I was short on time and ingredients, but you can't go wrong with the"banana split" flavors here.  I used 7 Up instead of cold water in the gelatin for extra oomph since I didn't have sweetened strawberries in the freezer.  I simply quartered fresh strawberries, sliced the bananas very thinly and combined all the fruits and the nuts with the gelatin, pouring the mixture into a 13 x 9.  When set, instead of using the vanilla and sugar, I just mixed the sour cream with an equal amount of Cool Whip and spread all over the casserole, making swirls with the back of a large spoon.  Looked inviting and tasted delicious.   Thank you for a new "old favorite"!

My great-aunt used to make something similar and I was trying to find one just like hers.  My sister has the recipe but all the meausurements are "large of this" or "small of that" not in ounces.  After a lengthy discussion with her I've come to the conclusion that my aunt's used 1 1/2 C boiling water, only 1 10 oz. pkg. of strawberries, and 8 oz. can of pineapple and 3 mashed bananas.  This recipe, as written, didn't set up as much as I would have liked and it was a bit tart.  It was still good but I really like my aunts.

For some reason it's just not a Christmas table without some sort of Jello salad.  This was this year's choice.  I followed the recipe exactly.  The combination of flavors is fantastic.  I have to agree with others, though, about too much liquid.  Next time I make this, I will drain the pineapple juice into a measuring cup and add enough water to it to equal one cup.  I think that might do the trick.  Everyone loved this and went back for more.

My family's absolute favorite.  A must-have for Thanksgiving & Christmas.  I do mine a little different - I leave out the sugar & vanilla and use 1 cup of pecans instead of walnuts.  I've been making it for 35 years, so it's definitely a keeper

This was good but wasn't the best jello salad I've ever eaten. I think I would have preferred it without the banana but that is just my personal preference.

My family loves strawberry pretzel salad so thought I would try this. It is similar in taste without the pretzels and a little easier to make. Not to good as a left-over since the bananas get soggy but is great to take to a big family gathering. Thanks for sharing.

This is pretty good. I made this a day in advance so I left out the bananas since I find they tend to get mushy real fast. I used more pineapple instead. I also substituted the sour cream and vanilla with vanilla soy pudding since I needed this to be milk-free, but I'm sure with sour cream it would be better. It sure is simple.

This is a fantastic! It is my absolute favorite. This is always on the table for Thanksgiving and Christmas made either by my mother or me.  The only difference is that we use pecans rather than walnuts.  Either way, it is a very tasty salad or even could be served as a dessert.

I've been making this recipe for years and it is fabulous.  Like others I just use the sour cream without adding sugar or vanilla - also have not used nuts which I may try.  When making for company or bringing to an event I make it in a mold (the tupperware one that has been around for years) and it is a nice presentation.

Love this jello! My husband asks for it every year around the holidays. We use just sour cream in the middle  (no vanilla or sugar) and it's great!. I also leave out the nuts.

This is very much like a traditional salad my mother used to make every holiday - now I do.  I use Cool Whip for the filling instead of the sour cream mixture.   I have not used the nuts before, but it is quite good and I will add nuts in the future.  Turns out great everytime!

I use the same ingrediants that you used except for the vanilla flavoring. I also do something different to mine. I mix all of the ingrediants togather and then refrigrate it.
