I thought this was a great autumn treat. As I am trying to keep my sodium and sugar intake to an all time low, I made a couple substitutions. Instead of sugar, I used 2 Tbsp of molasses, and a quarter cup of honey. I also added a quarter cup of whole wheat flour to the filling as well as 2 small eggs. I ended up having to bake it for 40 minutes total but it turned out great. My 4 year old asked for more pumplin pie with ice cream!

This was very easy and fun to make with a group of teenagers for English club at my school in Japan. (We used the school kitchen, and I substitute other plain cookies for the graham crackers, which we do not have in Japan.) However, I agree with the other review that said the crust is too dry. I have made this pie three times now, over the past few years, and although the crust eventually turns out fine, it's not a very good dough if you follow the recipe exactly. We usually end up adding more milk, but there must be another way!

The proportions for the crust seems off. It was too dry to form any kind of dough. The addition of the spices drowned out the taste of the squash which was disappointing.
