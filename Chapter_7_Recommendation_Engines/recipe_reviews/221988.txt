I loved the concept, but please make your own hollandaise.  I've never tried the powdered mix, and whipped it up and it was not good to me--I couldn't bear pouring it over my hard work!  Use 'Blender Hollandaise' from this site and you'll get much better results and taste.  The casserole was okay, I guess I just like a lot more 'stuff' in my egg casseroles.  Maybe some hot pepper sauce in the egg mixture along with some kind of cheese.  I love regular eggs Benedict, and the right hollandaise makes this recipe.

Delicious. I used egg beaters, skim milk, 100 calorie english muffins and used butter buds instead of margarine. It puffed up nicely and tasted great

This recipe is very easy and good.  I had ham instead of canadian bacon, cut to 1/2 inch dice.  I think I would use regular onion next time, the green onion was a little over powering for my taste.

I have made the recipe many times for very large groups of people. Everyone always loves it. The only thing I changes was the layering. I did layer of all the english muffins, all the Canadian bacon then poured custard mixture over. This recipe also freezes (after baked) and reheats well.

had overnight guests and they loved it! We have learned that we detest all packaged hollandaise sauces EXCEPT Knorr Brand Hollandaise and we usually add a teaspoon or two of fresh lemon juice to it if we have lemons in the house. (I tried making hollandaise from scratch and actually PREFER the Knorr stuff. Crazy huh?) One thing we always include in our eggs benedict is steamed broccoli florets. Steamed the broccoli for about 5 minutes, sprinkled it with a little garlic salt and lemon pepper before adding to the casserole. Served that yummy sauce on the side. I must not have done a very good job with the cooking spray because I did have some trouble with sticking. So it isn't our beloved eggs benedict that we will always consider quite special but what it is we enjoyed very much and it freed me up to relax and visit with our guests! Tasty with hash browns, chilled canned pears and maybe even a bloody mary! YUM!

Just served this for Christmas morning breakfast.  The immediate comments were that it looked so beautiful.  Someone said it looked like a picture out of a magazine.  I made it exactly as stated in the recipe.  I would not "ruin" it by adding cheese to it, as some reviewers have suggested.  Let the hollandaise sauce shine thru, for something special and different.  The ONLY suggestion I would make for improving it would be to make homemade hollandaise sauce---it is just that much better than the packaged variety and is not much more difficult than making the packaged kind (both you have to whisk it and watch it carefully on the stove as it thickens).  So, the packaged variety doesn't really save you that much work.

5 stars for the idea alone (for anyone that loves eggs bene)!  I added some diced potato/onion, used diced deli ham (always on hand), added garlic salt and shredded cheese blend before pouring on the eggs.  Note that after adding the eggs....proportions didn't look right and I was worried I'd have a top-half crunchy casserole, but after baking, it was perfect.  Then discovered....and couldn't believe....that my hollandaise sauce was gone!  Had to whip up a country gravy...thereby ruining the benedict effect...but next time...hollandaise all around please!  Good with the changes I had to make...good place to start with ANY of your breakfast-favorite add-ins.  I'm sure it'll be even better with the right sauce!

Made this for Christmas breakfast buffet, and everyone enjoyed it as written.  Then for Christmas breakfast at home, changed it up a bit.  Used a pound of bacon, fried, and chopped in place of the Canadian bacon.  Used 5 green onions, replaced onion powder and salt with 1-1/2 tsp of onion salt, and added fairly generous dashes of black pepper.  When finishing, used real butter instead of margarine, and added 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of lemon juice to the hollandaise sauce before pouring it over the casserole.  We liked it even better this way, and hash browns and orange juice made this complete.  Another tip for leftovers - serve hollandaise sauce on the side so everyone can add the amount they want, and then put remainder in frig with main casserole leftovers.  When reheating, heat separately, and both will seem fresher than if refrigerated and heated as one dish.

My family loved this recipe!  I did not buy enough canadian bacon so I used left over deli ham.  It would be good with any leftover ham! I also used 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt instead of the onion powder and salt. I also sprinkled shredded cheese over the top. It came out great and will be making it again!

Made this for Christmas morning.  We loved it.  I omitted the onion powder and increased the green onion(doubled it). I also just followed the directions on the back of our favorite packaged hollandaise sauce.  This recipe went into my recipe box!

Four stars because while the dish was very good, I made my own hollandaise. I'd rather set myself on fire than choke down hollandaise from a packet.

This was tasty - but then again, just about anything is with hollandaise sauce.  For those who expected this to be exactly like eggs benedict, what did you expect?  It is a casserole!  If you are expecting an easy, overnight breakfast casserole for a crowd, this will be just that.  Much better than standing at the stove all morning poaching eggs!  We served our sauce on the side.  Enjoy!

Greatly exceeded expectations.  While it can't compete with the real thing, it was a perfect addition to our Easter Brunch.  Made homemade hollandaise which I recommend.  

I used smoked salmon instead of Canadian bacon, because I was also serving ham with the meal.  This worked well.

Made this twice huge hits both times. I think making real hollindaise is worth the time. Second time I fried up the diced Canadian bacon before assembling.  The scallion adds a nice layer to the dish. 
Served this w Gilda's French toast bake with blueberries great combo for all.

Good recipe, except you cannot reduce the recipe for one or two people because of the number of large eggs.

We didn't love it; it was mediocre.  It mostly tasted like English muffin and hollandaise sauce.

AWESOME!!  So easy to throw together and we all really enjoyed it.  As per another reviewer, I made my own Hollandaise using the "Blender Hollandaise" recipe on this site, which was excellent.  Will definitely make this recipe again.  Thanks!!

I was really hopeful about this recipe because we adore Eggs Benedict..and for a crowd, the idea of a casserole sounded sublime. It was super easy to prepare this casserole, which is a huge plus. It certainly tasted fine....just not like traditional Eggs Benedict. Not bad...just not quite the same.

Made according to the recipe. Next time I think I would add a hint of dry mustard to the egg mixture, for just a bit of zip. Good company casserole.

04-02-16 ~ Great recipe to use up extra English muffins. I had everything on hand and made it up the night before and popped it in the oven the following morning. I made 'Quick & Easy Hollandaise Sauce in the Microwave' to go on the top. Great casserole, and this recipe will come in handy at the lake, this summer.

Easy and delicious.  It has the classic Eggs Benedict flavors.  I would suggest either homemade or Knorr’s Hollandaise sauce.  I’ve made it same day and like it that way.

I love this casserole!! It is so easy and delicious. We love eggs Benedict and this recipe makes it easy to serve a large crowd. I follow the recipe exactly expect I toast my English muffins before cutting them up. I also just assemble the whole thing and put it in the oven right away. This way the bread isn’t as “mushy”. It turns out fantastic and as another reviewer posted Knorr hollandaise sauce is the BEST, we have been using it for years. I think it is better than homemade. Thank you for sharing!!

This recipe is very good and very easy.  I tried it as is and really enjoyed it.  Then I did it again with one modification.  Whether I make Hollandaise from scratch or a package, I add a little lemon juice.  (Typically about 1/2 tsp for a relatively small batch.) It gives it just a little kick.

I didn't like the texture of this.  Sounded great, but the English muffins were too soggy for my taste.  My dogs loved it though.  :-)

Yum! I had a LOT of extra ham so used that, I did use 2 deep foil pans so when I took it out, was not quite set.  Put the pans back in the onen covered at 400 and it took another 15 min... basically would leave it in covered for 45 min if you use the foil pans (costco). Omitted the green onions, added fresh lemon juice to the hollandaise, and sprinked the smoked paprika on top... but fed the footbal crew and even the picky guys loved it...thanks!

I thought I used a good Hollandaise sauce (McCormick), but it was seriously lacking.  Just another egg casserole dish; far removed from what would be considered Eggs Benedict as the eggs are not poached.

FYI:

Classic (original) Hollandaise Sauce:

3 egg yokes (slightly beat with whisk)
1 stick butter
1/2 tea. lemon juice (or to taste)
dash cayenne pepper

use double boiler to warm butter to melting, NOT HOT.

With whisk, SLOWLY add egg yolks & cayenne pepper, whisking constantly until thickened. (but still pourable)

Take off heat & whisk in lemon juice.

Ready to use.

Not heart-healthy, but ooooooh so good. 

If for some reason your egg yolks curdle (usually do to heat being to hot)), keep on warm & wisk in hot water, 1 teaspoon at a time until smooth. (really, it works)

Made this for the first time Christmas morning and it got rave reviews from my guests.  With apologies to the original ‘author’,  I made a few changes simply because I always adapt a basic recipe to our taste.  First, I cubed the muffins and spread them on a baking sheet to air dry the day before.  I used whole milk, real butter (a holiday splurge) omitted the green onion but used onion powder and chives.  Also added S&P, Colmans powdered mustard, and a dash of cayenne pepper.
I did use pkg. Hollandaise, but again used real butter, and seasoned with a dash of cayenne and the juice from 1/2 lemon.  It was delicious!  Served with hash browns and fresh fruit salad, and, of course, Bloody Marys!

While this does not replace traditional Eggs Benedict it’s not bad when you want the basic flavors of EB but don’t want to go thru the effort of making it from scratch, especially when serving a group of people. There is definitely a place for this in my life. It is nice to be able to plop a casserole like this down on the table so you can enjoy eating with your guests instead of standing over the stove preparing each dish individually. By the time you sit down to eat everyone else is done. 
The first time I made it I followed the recipe as written, using Knorr package mix with fresh lemon juice added.  MUST have fresh lemon juice in Hollandaise! Also used real butter, not margarine. It really was not bad. The Knorr mix is much better than I anticipated, actually rivaling many made from scratch hollandaise sauces I’ve had. 
The second time I made it I toasted the English muffins first and used thicker slices of a good baked ham cut into cubes which I sautéed in a little bit of butter for more flavor and made my own hollandaise and again, real butter. I also used chopped chives instead of green onions and seasoned the egg mixture with sea salt and fresh cracked black pepper. I made it the morning I served it which helped it not be so soggy, one of the things the Family didn’t like about it the first time I made it. It was even better. Truth be told tho, the difference in the hollandaise sauces was not that great and I would definitely use Knorrs again in a pinch. Overall a goo

I made a couple of changes... I only used 4 1/2 muffins ... Also I added 3/4 cup od shredded cheddar cheese before I poured the egg mixture... It was wonderful.  I also made my own Hollaindaise sauce!

We made this the night before, for Easter morning Brunch!  DELISH!!!  Ours cooked a little too brown on the bottom, my hint is to check it around 22-25 min, if it's pulling away from the sides and the top is crispy brown then it's done!  We used Knorr packaged Hollandaise, it was a perfect!

This was disappointing. No flavor of English muffins and no piquant tang you usually get from the Hollandaise. Recommendations to make your own Hollandaise would certainly make it better but if I'm going to do that, I might as well make real Eggs Benedict. This was my first Allrecipes flop.

This was a huge hit Christmas morning!  I did a little less English Muffin, and added some dijon and lemon to the hollandaise mix.  Couldn't even tell it was from a package.  We also used some delicious locally raised ham.  Got several compliments it was the best breakfast casserole they've ever had!

You could always make mock hollandaise sauce if you didn't have a package... look it up online or here is a link... delicious. I'm going to make this Sunday for a gathering we are hosting.  Sounds delicious.

Made this for Christmas morning, scaled down to 2/3. It was nice being able to make it ahead and just pop it in the oven in the morning, but it wasn't amazingly good or anything, just ok. I don't think I'd go out of my way to make this again.

I might increase the ham and or the egg mixture next time just because it seemed more bready than necessary.  We also doubled the sauce and that was a wise decision.  It was really great!

I've made this several times for large gatherings. Everyone always raves about how good it is! Make real hollandaise sauce from scratch, it's SOOO much better than the packaged kind. Also, I have found that using Canadian bacon, it kind of dries out and gets extra chewy. I like to use whole ham that I dice up. Last time I made it, I cut up asparagus and added it to the casserole.   great recipe!!!

Really tasty, served on New Year Day with the Blender hollandaise Sauce.  I liked how the top parts of the English muffins got crunchy.  I made this about 5pm New Years Eve and threw in Fridge until about 11am NY Day.

Butter the pan instead of cooking spray.  Use Knorr Hollandaise Sauce mix and make with butter.  Sauce can be done in microwave, and add a few drops lemon juice to sauce.

This recipe turned out great and was well received! I made a double recipe for a large brunch and used prosciutto instead of the Canadian bacon in one. The prosciutto casserole turned out better with more flavor.

I made this for a brunch that I had the in laws over for the first time.  Fantastic!  I did cut back a little on the green onion so i could garnish with some when it was done.  Other than that I followed the recipe exactly. The in laws even asked for the recipe,

We had this on Christmas Morning.  I didn't have Canadian Bacon, so I just used ham left over from a spiral cut honey ham.  Everyone loved it; it's our new Christmas Morning Breakfast Casserole.

I made this recipe for Christmas breakfast 2013 after seeing it in the current AR magazine.  This was a real hit!  I would definitely make this again.  I think I probably used a pound of Canadian bacon because I had 2 small packages in the freezer and used what I had on hand.  I'm sure a fresh made Hollandaise would be better, but there was nothing wrong with the packaged mix I used and I'd definitely use it again.  Super easy to prep when you have limited time on hand!

Deeeelicious! I used sourdough English muffins and it turned out perfect. I made this for my family for Christmas breakfast potluck and got a few requests for the recipe.  They ate the whole thing! Definitely will be making this again.

I used 1/2 heavy cream and 1/2 whole milk. I added grated havarti or baby swiss cheese into egg mixture. Make sure you cooked Canada Bacons or use already cooked ham. I used Knorr hollandaise package. My family & friends love it.

This is always a big hit at brunch. I make it just as the recipe calls for, but I usually make my own hollandaise and let guests spoon it on themselves.

I was really hoping this would be great . . . but, I was very disappointed.  It is more like a bread pudding and I will not make this recipe again.

I don't think there is a good substitute for the real deal when it comes to Eggs Benedict.

I made it exactly like the recipe said.  My son suggested that it would be better if it had crispy bacon instead of the Canadian bacon.  It would add more texture.  .

I wouldn't change a thing. I made this for brunch and am usually a little concerned using a recipe that I haven't tried before in front of company.  We all loved it with the blender hollandaise sauce. It's very filling.

I did not have any milk left so I used half and half. I am sure whichever you use will taste great. Everyone at work loved it and asked for the reciepe. My husband said it was awesome and wish I had made more. It is so easy to make and good to make the night before or made right away. The only thing I forgot to do was to cover the first half hour in foil. Still tasted great!

I made this for Christmas brunch. I also used packaged hollandaise sauce. I had to leave mine in the oven a little longer than stated because it wasn't done in the middle but that could have been my oven too. Everyone said it was good and they are a lot of it but it seems that there was a lot left over.  I will make this again if I'm going to a brunch with a lot of people. It has good flavor, it's easy to put tighter and easy clean up. Make sure you oil the pan very good before adding ingredients as it does Sri k to the pan.

I made this for a brunch.  I am vegetarian, so I didn't try it, but everyone gave me rave reviews. I use the blender hollandaise recipe as well.  I followed the recipe to the letter. It was very nice to be able to make this the night before and then just pop it in the oven.

I've made this several times when we've had our large family together.  It's easy and a favorite of three generations.  Putting it together the night before makes for a simple finish in the morning.  Good stuff!

Very easy to make the night before. I don't consume pork, so I used turkey bacon. Still worked well. Make your own Hollandaise sauce. They are a few easy ones on this site. It makes a difference.

I made this recipe as written with 2 modifications. I omitted the onion powder and added extra green onion. I used whole wheat english muffins.  I found this dish has far too much bread. Everyone at our brunch felt the same way. If I make it again I will use half the english muffins.

This was delicious!  I used diced ham instead of Canadian bacon, and followed another reviewer's advice to make the blender hollandaise sauce (also on this site) instead of using packaged.  There was very little left over, which was just as good reheated the next morning.  I will definitely make this again.

Super good and way easier than Eggs Benedict (although you can't replace eggs Benedict). This is a keeper for sure! Seems fancy and difficult when it is very easy! I only had half the amount of Canadian bacon it called for so I added some cooked regular bacon. I think it needs the Canadian bacon, for sure, but this was also good!

I made this casserole for Christmas Day breakfast.  It was a huge hit and everyone was in favor of having it again!  I substituted pre-cooked cubed ham, however, for the Canadian bacon, which worked very well and was very convenient.

I've also made it with homemade hollandaise and that's my favorite!  But the packet kind is easy enough for my kids to make.  In the morning - easy is sometimes best.  Happy Brunches!

My sister who "can't stand" Eggs Benedict liked this! Personally, I think this casserole is good but not exactly eggs bene in casserole form. I also used the blender holladaise recipe from this site instead of a mix

We loved it. I made it as written, since I think it is unfair to rate a recipe if you never even tried it as written. 

That being said, I made it on Christmas Eve afternoon and popped it in the oven Christmas day. It was so easy and a big hit. It was actually better after it cooled off and the eggs had a chance to rest with the Hollandaise. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for sharing!

Loved it! Omg best and easiest casserole ever.BUT you must use blender hollandaise sauce recipe. Dont use the prepackaged mix. Freaked over that much milk versus eggs but kept it very moist. Will make again and either add chipotle and jalapeños or with asparagus.

I was reluctant because I usually like my eggs runny but I was VERY pleasantly surprised! This was delicious and I will definitely make it again. I cut up my leftover ham roast from the night before and it was incredible!

This was delicious and I made it as stated in the recipe.  I did used multi-grain light English muffins and I substituted yogurt for the butter in the hollandaise sauce mix.  Served it at Christmas breakfast for the family gathering and it disappeared!  That says it all right there.

I always make some sort of egg casserole for Christmas brunch. This was the first time my family asked for seconds. I think we found a new family favorite. Easy & yummy!

This is an amazing casserole.  I followed the recipe with a few additions, but I believe even if I had followed the recipe exactly it would have been good. I made blender hollandaise from scratch and I toasted the English muffins first and then buttered them before cutting them. I believe toasting and buttering the muffins first added a new dimension of texture and flavor to the casserole.

This was a hit at a breakfast themed dinner party, I received rave reviews from everyone. I did not use packet hollandaise sauce but made my own with 6 egg yolks,  1/2 C butter 1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice and salt to taste, added a little milk to get a thinner consistency since it sat for 40 minutes before I used it.

Was good.  A bit bland without some tweaks.  Put a pinch of cayenne or pepper flakes, mustard if you like a kick in the egg mix.  I also like to brown the ham for a fuller bodied flavor.
For gal who called margarine  hydrogenated...check labels. I use Becel olive oil margarine which is non-hydrogenated and for those of us concerned about out cholesterol I think it is an ok choice.
I have tried all the packaged hollandaises available in my large grocery stores and my choice is International brand. I use less marg/butter, add a good squeeze of fresh lemon and a little hot sauce to taste.  To make the sauce thinner and make up for cutting the fat, thin with hot water.  My family loves it made this way.

I have made this several times.   One time I even served it for a dinner to a group of friends with a salad.  Everyone raves about!  I have made it with cubed ham and that was great.   Also, I bought two packages of Knorr's hollandaise sauce mixes for anyone who wanted to add more.  Next time I will make my own sauce as it's easy enough.

PS... use butter!

Made this for our Christmas brunch, along with another casserole recipe from this site. Really wasn't very impressed....tasted OK. I think if I would make it again, I would use several more eggs. It just didn't puff up like I would have liked.

This was amazing!  By far the best and most moist Christmas casserole I’ve ever made.  Will definitely make again.  I added spinach leaves because I love them in casseroles with eggs.  Also added garlic, cumin, and celery salt.  Definitely recommend making your own hollandaise from this website.  It really is better than the packages.  A keeper.  Thanks for the recipe!

A tasty and "easy to make" substitute for the real deal--the only thing missing is the runny yoke, which would have earned  it 5 stars.

this is the second Christmas in a row I've made this. I do extra Hollandaise sauce on the side( 2 people who won't eat it) so you can add as much as you want. I am definitely doing this again.. maybe I will remember pictures the next time.

My family loved it and asked that this become our new holiday breakfast casserole.  Instead of Canadian bacon I used regular bacon, crumbled. Also, I added 2 eggs and a little more milk, and 2 cups of shredded mild cheddar on the top.

Tried this for Christmas morning casserole as something different than in the past. It was a big hit. Easy to make and flavor was tasty. I made a homemade hollandaise sauce from this site as topping. I will definitely make again.

I made this for a Christmas potluck breakfast at work.  Instead of using a baking dish, I put the ingredients in the crock pot 'insert' and then baked it in that the following morning (45 minutes covered and it was perfectly done).  I brought the crock pot to work and kept in on warm until we started.  Everyone raved about it and several asked for the recipe.  Will make this for Christmas breakfast instead of traditional eggs benedict - so much easier and all the same great tastes!
UPDATE:  I just made this for Easter breakfast tomorrow (going to bake it the traditional way) and recommend adding another 3-4 eggs with a bit more milk and onion powder.

Loved this recipe! Really hit the spot.

I ALWAYS make a new to me recipe AS PRESENTED.  This is a GREAT recipe.  I made it as presented twice.  After the trial run, I made the following changes:

Add garlic (fresh OR powdered) and WHITE PEPPER  to the eggs and use a blender to scramble the eggs.  Use UNCURED ham or bacon.

After the cooking process, sprinkle sharp white cheddar cheese, THEN add the green onion.  (I like the crunch and freshness of the green onion).

Cover the Casserole EVENLY with the hollandaise sauce and serve. 

YUMMY.

THIS IS NOT A HEALTH FOOD, however, if one does not eat like this everyday, it makes a really nice treat to greet a weekend morning.

Try some green chile or a dash of cayenne pepper sauce and be keen not to overpower the dish with the spice of your choosing.

Try it my way.  You will NOT be disappointed.

Too much bread and not enough egg for my husband and myself.  I had to throw some away.  Agree with the packaged hollandaise sauce comments too.  From scratch is better.  The packaged sauce had an odd smell that was hard to get passed.  I wish this recipe would have turned out, I really liked the concept

The casserole was ok but unimpressive.  The packaged Hollandaise sauce ruined it.  the sauce only had a hint of lemon, but the worst part was it had sugar in it, totally ruining it for me.

Delicious!  If you choose to make your own Hollandaise, remember that you’ll be adding a LOT more fat and calories.  I’ve used packaged Hollandaise on eggs and veggies for several years and no one complains at all.  Yes, slightly different flavor, but very good!

I can't rate this, because I haven't made it yet.....but I am going to!  I have a question to all who HAVE made it:  did anyone add asparagus?  My typical Eggs Benedict is ONLY proper with asparagus atop the eggs, with the Hollandaise sauce over that.

Great base recipe that you can switch up depending on what you got in the fridge as far as the meats go. Definitely needs potatoes on the side to help soak up the delicious richness.

I didn't not see it up the night before so I sliced the English muffins (like you would to toast them) and only used the 1/2s. I also didn't have green onion so I used a handful of chopped onion and garnished with fresh chives. 

We loved this dish! I see a lot of remakes in our future!

This is a wonderful recipe. We have it every Christmas morning with a fruit salad.  I have used both the green onions as well as sweet onions and it’s good both ways.  I use the Knorr hollandaise mix and add some fresh lemon juice and fresh ground pepper when I don’t have time to make my own hollandaise sauce.

I have made this a few times now and everyone has liked it as an easy alternative to eggs Benedict .  One important detail is to cut the English muffins into small pieces.  Otherwise the egg  mixture doesn’t seem to have the proper consistency after baking.  I have used Canadian pea meal bacon and also leftover ham on 2 other occasions.   Will continue to make this for brunch.  Delicious and easy

I would make it, as a Canadian, use real Canadian bacon which is Pea-meal bacon, not ham which is what is used in this recipe.  Pea-meal is much better tasting, slices it thick and then cube it. Very tasty, too bad it can't be purchased in the U.S. I would also make my own hollandaise sauce, I have a recipe for microwave sauce and it is very good.

We had a lot of company for Thanksgiving. The flavor was really good but the presentation not so much. Were I to make it again I'd cut up the Canadian bacon and stir it into the bread.

I got up early, 2am, to make casseroles, for an oven time of 10:30am.  I was reluctant to do it much before that.  I used flat pepperoni sized Canadian bacon, and a good quality English muffin.  I made this for my Dad's surprise 80th Birthday party.  I had doubled the recipe, so I was hoping this turned out.  I followed the suggestions and made the blender hollandaise sauce.  The whole thing was perfect!  Not a spec left.  The hollandaise sauce was wonderful as well.  Many of my relatives want me to send the recipe.

I really liked this - in some ways better than my traditional egg casserole. The muffins held up better than white bread. The onions also elevated the flavor. The only pain is having to make the hollandaise, it honestly doesn't need it. I made blender hollandaise.

This was a great recipe! We loved it and it also made terrific leftovers-- no lie. 

The only changes I made to this was to add ground mustard and some cayenne to the spices and I doubled the hollandaise  sauce. I was happy with the spice additions, and the doubled sauce was okay the night we ate it (breakfast for dinner) but it didn't need two. However, if you are going to eat leftovers (it was lunch for both of us that week) the extra kept it nice and moist and yummy. 

Definitely will make again!

I added 2 eggs because I used a lasagna pan.  Perfect.  Also-to put it over the top I used 2 pkgs of Hollandaise.  Everyone raved and 2 requested the recipe!

Fantastic and super easy - served it with hash browns & a fruit salad and had an impressive brunch! I agree about powdered hollandaise though - I used a mix and it wasn't so great - don't really need it but does give the true impression of "eggs Benedict" with the sauce - you could serve it on the side & let people decide themselves...

A very tasty recipe indeed, and extremely easy to make. A couple of mild variations: I added a little fresh lemon juice while making the hollandaise sauce. Also, I realized on the verge of putting it in the oven that we were out of paprika. Instead, I decided to go with Lawry's seasoned pepper. I thought it was delicious, and the others to edit thought so too. Next time, and I'm fairly sure there will be a next time, I would make it with the paprika to see if it makes any difference.

I  substituted thin-sliced country ham for the Canadian bacon.  I'm giving it four stars for the suggestion to use packaged hollandaise sauce mix. It's really not difficult to make great hollandaise sauce. Look up Julia Child's recipe...it's  practically fool proof .

This delicious breakfast casserole is a hit every time!   The easiest dish to prepare, although I use less of the English muffins to get more egg flavor.  Blender hollandaise works well but the package kind is fine in a pinch.   Serve with fruit salad to add a nice treat to your brunch.  Leftovers are great!

I did as another reviewer suggested and just layered the muffins, bacon (I precooked the bacon a little bit) and egg mixture.  I used packaged hollandaise sauce (International brand) and it was delicious. It was a huge hit.   Will definitely be making again.

Pretty good! I used garlic powder instead of onion powder, as it was all I had on hand.

I did try the packaged hollandaise sauce (McCormick). Prepared as suggested, it was rather flavorless, but a quarter of fresh lemon juice spruced it up. In the end, I liked it, but my boyfriend didn't seem to care for it. Next time, maybe I will try homemade. 

We did both enjoy the rest of the casserole. My only criticism is that the Canadian bacon, which was already fully cooked before going in to the casserole, tasted a little tough.

Wow. How great is this! I've always loved eggs Benedict and this is a fantastic way to serve it to a group. I did not make it in advance, just baked it after letting the egg mixture soak into the bread for a few minutes. I also made my own hollandaise sauce, since it's easier and tastes better than a dry mix. I'm blown away by this recipe! It's a keeper for sure.

OK. My family doesn't care for a lot of milk in the eggs, and I made this same day so I changed a few things. I used a tad bit smaller casserole dish and used only 2 English muffins. I decreased milk to around a cup. On top of the second layer of ham, I added about 1/3 cup Hatch hot chilies. After I poured on the egg mixture, I added about 1/2 - 1 cup shredded cheese. After baking the 30 minutes, I uncovered the eggs and turned off the oven. After the eggs were completely set, I poured the Holllandaise on top and cut it into 6 pieces. It was delicious.

I left out the scallions and didn't have any onion powder, so substituted garlic powder.  I also didn't need all of the English muffins; 4 filled the bottom of the dish, and I used ham instead of Canadian bacon. To the sauce I added 1 tablespoon of lemon juice and a dash of cayenne.  I did not refrigerate it overnight either. This was so good my husband and I ate the entire casserole in one  night.

My mom made this for New Year's Day breakfast and it was almost gone!!! I was convinced it was another dish she had concocted. It's amazing!! I think the touch was putting the sauce on the side. The dish itself was very moist, so it was nice that everyone could add their own amount of hollendaise. She served it with cut fruit and it was a lighter breakfast that had NO leftovers!! Love this!!

I gave this recipe four stars, mainly for how easy it was to put together and that it could be made the night before. We used regular bacon because we like it better than Canadian. The taste did not have a "Wow!" factor, but it was good and enjoyed by all. I simply added fruit and juice and felt that a full breakfast was provided!

I made 3 of these for Christmas morning brunch. I used the blender hollendaise recipe on this site as we had someone with allergies that couldn't have the pre-packaged. One dish I made exactly as called for. One I made vegetarian and left out the Canadian Bacon and tripled the egg/milk mixture. And one I made regular but increased the egg/milk mixture. All three dishes were OVERPOWERED by onion flavor. If I try it again I'll use about 1/3 the green onion called for.

I will make it again. I did not think it tasted like eggs benedict; perhahs the texture. Next time I would layer halves of English muffins ( not cut into 1" pieces.) Then I would layer Canadian bacon ( not chopped)and repeat this at least twice. Then the egg mixture and set overnight...I would bake and then top with scrambled eggs or shredded cheese and hollandaise sauce. Perhaps this would have the texture of eggs benedict and appearance. boots

Used sliced ham instead of back bacon (less costly and it was available in the fridge!).  Turned out great and the family was looking forward to having it again.  Great recipe!

Delicious -- have a vegetarian daughter-in-law -- layered a portion with veggie burger -- all worked out just fine ! I do not understand why BACK BACON is called Canadian bacon ! American pigs have back bacon too ( not just our Canadian pigs) !!

Meh... still tasted like just another egg casserole. I am glad that I read all of the user reviews to pick up pointers. Used 10 eggs instead of 8. Milk mixed with half and half. Roasted a red bell pepper diced and folded into the beaten mixture along with the minced scallions. Also, a pinch of cayenne and dry mustard. Increased the salt and little. Toasted and buttered the muffins. Bake time took longer than what is defined in the recipe. One person at our family Christmas brunch loved it.  Another asked for my recipe. All in all, I quess it was ok for some.

I will make this again but with some changes. The casserole itself was a little bland. I think I might add more Canadian bacon and maybe some vegetables like mushrooms and asparagus. I will make my own sauce.  Making it from scratch may be extra work but well worth the effort.

great recipe. most breakfast casseroles have cheese. This is a wonderful casserole that has none. Served the casserole without the hollandaise sauce and let everyone serve themselves with or without. Great breakfast for picky eaters!!

I worked with what I had in the house.  I had sausage links from Costco.  I slow cooked the sausage in a crockpot.  I had hollandaise sauce from Trader Joes.  It's delicious!  I omitted the green onions.   Absolutely DELISH!  Big Hit!

I didn't do it overnight but loved the idea of Eggs Benedict Casserole. Followed the recipe and yumm!!  Next time I will tear up all the Canadian Bacon and mix with the English Muffins. The bottom layer got a little tough. Also added some asparagus. Thanks for a good one!!! Delish on Xmas morning!

Made reduced version overnight. 4 mini eng muffins, 3 eggs, 3/4 c milk in 9" pan. Great. Could up to 5 *4*1.
