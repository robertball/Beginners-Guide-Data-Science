This was amazing! So flavorful!  I used a yellow onion (because I didn’t have a red one on hand).  I’ll try the red next time.  The Mexican spice I used was the taco seasoning from Trader Joe’s because it’s gluten free.  Everything else I followed exactly like the recipe called for. Definitely be patient and let the onions and peppers cook thoroughly until slightly charred. It’s worth it!

I don't usually do an all-pork taco, but the salsa and lime crema made me want to try this recipe. I followed it with the following exceptions: 
I used Anaheim pepper, and liked that it was sauteed with the onion before adding the meat. I used some crushed tomatoes, chicken stock & some flour at the end to coat and thicken it up.
I also pretty much doubled the salsa recipe and added a mango (finely chopped) and a touch of sugar & white wine vinegar. We added remaining chopped Anaheim peppers, scallion and shredded lettuce on top. The salsa also went really well with green Tabasco (my favorite).
It was phenomenal! With a pound of pork and doubling the salsa, it was just the right amount for our hungry family of 4. 
We'll be making this again for sure.

Followed the meat  & crema recipe exactly, doubled the salsa and added mango.  We used crumbled queso fresco as a topping, my husband and I also used a dash of Jalapeno/Poblano Choulula on ours.  It's going into our family rotation, and has landed on the list of football party foods.  Total winner here folks.

These were so good, will definitely make them again. I added some of the cilantro and extra lime juice to the crema for extra and put some shredded cotija cheese on top.

Qwick and tasty dish.  Didn't have ground pork so used lean pork chops cut into strips.  Great on corn tortillas!

I have no idea why this recipe doesn't have more reviews! I never write reviews, but I feel like I should with this one. I've done this more then 5 times already and it ALWAYS comes out tasting amazing. It's easy, but it does take a few extra steps like when making the salsa and crema, but it's always worth it! One thing though is I prefer the salsa with MANGO instead of kiwi. And I use CUBANELLE peppers instead of poblano. Everything else stays the same. Lastly, I assume the Mexican seasoning is like taco seasoning? So I just use a packet of taco seasoning. Sooooo delicious!
