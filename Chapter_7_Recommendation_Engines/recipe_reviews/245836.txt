Turned out great.  I used northern pike for the fish.  Will become a regular for me.

Great chowder! I still don’t like Lima beans (sorry mom) so I added a red pepper in the beginning and peas at the end. The reason I only gave 4 stars is that I felt like it could’ve had a little more seasoning. But yum!
