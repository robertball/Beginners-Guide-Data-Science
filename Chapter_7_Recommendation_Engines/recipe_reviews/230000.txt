Excellent! I used Hawaiian Bread and followed the directions just as written. I assembled it the night before and baked it off in the morning.  Delicious.

I made this for a party of 16 for Christmas brunch. I used homemade french bread and turkey bacon, and scaled up by about 25%. I made the whole thing the night before, saving the egg/milk mix to dump in, in the morning. I cooked it at the same time as the ham, which called for 275 F, so I cooked it about an hour and a half, cranking it up to 350 F for about 20 minutes at the end.  Main point: everyone loved it! I will definitely make it again, as it was easy to prepare ahead of time, and quite yummy.

I LOVED This recipe! I hate reading how every one changes the recipes. Well, I didn't change anything, Except: I didn't have some things So, I tried other stuff in the place of it. Not much though! I kept the recipe the same but, I didn't have the loaf bread. (I used 2 gigantic homemade stale biscuits I had made)in place of the Italian bread and I didn't have bacon, so I used 1lb. of R.B. Rice hot sausage in the place of it. Oh my goodness was it good! I am a big cheese person, but hate cottage cheese, and it was sooooooo good in this casserole. My son stays here one day a week because of his job and he lives out of town and can't wait for him to have this for his breakfast at 7 a. m. This Tuesday! I may have to make an extra casserole just to send home to the family! I think it would make a good supper food! (maybe a new tradition)MMMMM

I made this for Christmas morning brunch and it was a great hit! I did make some minor adjustments: I used non-fat cottage cheese, lowfat mozzarella, half the onion amount because my kids can be a bit finicky. I cooked the onions with olive oil instead because I chose to use lowfat Hormel Real Bacon Pieces for faster prep and less clean up. I served it with pancakes and maple syrup for that sweet and salty flavor. I do suggest prepping the night before so you only need to pop in the oven the next day. This dish will definitely be added to my family's recipe book and Christmas brunch tradition from now on.

This recipe is excellent.  I have made it several times now.  It keeps well, and refreezes in a snap!  I just cut in portions, put it in zip top freezer bags and throw it in the freezer.  I thaw and rewarm in the microwave.   I make it just as the recipe describes.  My son requested it for supper this week!!!  :)

This is awesome! I make a breakfast casserole every year on Christmas Eve night to eat on Christmas day. I have tried many recipes but this is definately one if the best. I added a little more egg/milk mixture before I put it in the oven so it wouldn't be too dry. My Italian bread cubes were pretty big. It was crispy on top, moist in the middle, had an awesome flavor and the cottage cheese middle was a nice addition. The only thing I might change is using a little less onion, especially if you have little kids. But I will definately make this next year.

Super easy and very tasty!  I would love to try it with crumbled cooked breakfast sausage too.  I was surprised at how yummy the cottage cheese was in this dish.   My only tweak would be more bacon and less onion.  Seasoning was spot on for me!

I made this in the morning, but instead of bacon I used Jimmy Deans Hot Sausage. It turned out great and I'll make it again, but next time I'll use less nutmeg. It was a little too nutmegy for my taste.

Pretty good recipe. Next time I think I will try it with some chorizo sausage. I added two more eggs as five was not going to be enough.

Very good! I did add 4 more eggs and 1 cup of milk. Without this, the egg mixture only filled the dish half full. Next time I will add a little bit more bacon or I eill just add some sausage.

Kind of like a breakfast lasagna!  I made 2/3 of this size , but still w/5 eggs, added some scallions on top.  Next time I would add crumbled breakfast sausage, too.

This has the consistency of bread pudding, which I like.  I didn't like the nutmeg.  The dish is savory, but the nutmeg makes me feel like I should be eating a dessert.  Okay, but will not make again

I changed it up a bit using stuffing mix instead of bread and sour cream instead of cottage cheese and milk.

I made this on a whim this morning and as my husband remarked, "this is definitely a keeper"!    Followed the recipe exactly as written other than halving the ingredients for only two of us.  Made it in an 8x8 square Pyrex and the pieces were very generous and easily could feed 4 people.  Decreased baking time to 30 minutes.

I made this for Thanksgiving Brunch. Delicious! Mixed up all ingredients last night , but kept separate until putting together this morning. Added 2 eggs, used 1/2 and 1/2, and used bakery fresh garlic bread. This was a hit and so easy!

Very simple to make and as the other reviews have said "everyone loves it".

Definitely my go to when guests stay over. Gives you plenty of time to sit and visit.

Excellent with one minor adjustment.  I would use half as much nutmeg next time.  This recipe could easily be customized to include other ingredients like spinach.

This was really good!  Loved the addition of cottage cheese and I did use no fat and it worked just fine.  I did use turkey sausage but that was the only change in the ingredients.  I also cut the recipe in half and did have to "fiddle" with the amounts a little to get the bread all soaked.  Had some girl friends in for brunch and everyone liked it.

Just served this for brunch.  Everyone loved it.  I added about a teaspoon of crushed red pepper,  1 extra egg & extra 1/2 cup milk.  Next time I might add more bacon or try sausage.

Used a Dry Jack bread instead of italian and 15" skillet instead and ended up with a crispy toasted bread topping with cheesy gooey filling beneath. For us it covered all of the different wants for brunch with the family. Great recipe!
