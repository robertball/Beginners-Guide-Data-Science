Made for Recipe Group--yummy is an understatement. This is the best ice cream I have ever made. (And I've made a lot.) DH loves peanut butter and Reese's ice cream, and this is SO much better than the store bought brand. It's very rich and creamy. Thanks Chloe!

I think I wish I never found it. Good bye diet! If you love peanut butter (like we do), you will love this ice cream. Very creamy and rich. We will be making it a lot! Thank you for the recipe!

Followed steps 1 and 2 using whole milk. Cooled 15-20 min (not completely cool), whisked in heavy cream. Refrigerated 6 hours.  Stirred in ice cream maker 20 minutes.  Cut 8-9 refrigerated pb cups into 1/8ths and mixed in by hand once in bowl.  Froze a few hours then stirred again. Good with complete brownie mix.

Outstanding! I've made it twice now, the first time exactly as written, and we loved it. The second time. I used brown sugar in place of the white, which underscored the peanut butter flavor even better, added the chopped peanut butter cups at the end of the freezing and folded them in gently. This made them stay much chunkier. Also, I swirled in some chocolate syrup in at the end, just for additional chocolate flavor. We felt these measures made  an already-great recipe even more decadent. Any way you choose to do it, however, this ice cream is extraordinary. Outrageously smooth, with a velvety creaminess, even when frozen for hours. Easy to scoop, too. Maybe it's all the egg yolks. Maybe it's the peanut butter. Who knows? Who CARES? I make all the ice cream that comes into this house, have been making sorbets, gelato and ice cream for decades, and it's no exaggeration to say that this recipe is a major standout.

NOTE TO KA ICE CREAM MAKERS - remember to follow the instructions for making ice cream.  Which includes cooling the ice cream mixture for several hours.  If I could give this recipe more than 5 stars I would.  The peanut butter flavour was perfect and did not over power.  Will be making again.  Thank you RG for pointing recipe out and thank you Chloe for sharing this recipe.

YUM!  I made this for the recipe group and was not disappointed.  I followed the recipe to a "T", setting timers with no changes made.  Perfect peanut butter taste and I am happy the egg yolks are cooked as the peanut butter melts into the milk mixture.  I love the chopped peanut butter cups in it.  Next time I will double the recipe.   Thank you Chloe Marie for sharing your recipe!
